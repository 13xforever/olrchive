1930	8934	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10514	15557	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19222	22124	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22464	25666	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26226	28948	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29488	32390	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33170	33590	Just kidding.
33790	35391	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35611	42775	In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?
42795	45797	That's the biggest bear you ever seen, Jingleberry.
45897	47018	What's your favorite sex?
49036	49636	Showgirls.
50517	51697	Absolutely frightful.
51917	52737	What's yours?
52757	55218	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55278	56659	Don't torture yourself.
57179	58019	That's my job.
58119	59920	Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!
59980	64602	I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.
65002	65822	I know Kung Fu.
66282	68883	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
68943	70784	Why did they have to take the word gang?
71604	75065	Nobody expects a Spanish exposition!
75325	76126	It's Kendo.
76186	76686	Kendo!
78991	81053	DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,
97640	102582	We are live and this is episode number 23 for December the 8th of 2002.
102962	110005	But actually, we're taping the show a day early on December 7th of 2002 because we've all decided to go out and get a life this Sunday night.
110225	110985	Because we can.
111285	112266	Because we can.
112306	112946	We have to clean.
113666	114366	You get to clean.
114386	115067	Joy, joy.
116693	117414	Thank you for watching!
141656	143056	You know we're better as DarkSakura.
143556	145737	And in that corner, it is our tech massa, Loki.
145757	146817	Hey, everybody.
147777	150678	And we have with us tonight in the studio, nobody else.
150838	153419	There's nobody else here because... They're playing Animal Crossing like addicts.
153439	156259	Brad and Irene are out in the front, but they're playing Animal Crossing because they suck.
157380	157900	Yeah.
158460	160100	Quit hitting people with thug nets and get in here.
160120	160720	We're doing a show.
161061	161461	Pitfalls.
161481	164861	Don't forget the pitfalls.
164921	166782	We'll be talking to everybody a bit more later.
167634	168796	First, we're going to take a quick break.
168816	171139	We're going to do a bunch of poppin' music songs this break.
171159	171940	Won't that be fun?
172621	173902	Any other opening thoughts from you kids?
174123	176426	I just made a treble clef with a microphone cord.
177707	178428	That's special.
178549	178909	Thank you.
181647	186630	Also on tonight's show, the usual talk of nothing, and a new game.
186910	187870	We'll be doing a new game tonight.
187890	188430	That'll be fun.
189251	190391	And I don't know what else.
190611	193053	So enjoy this opening.
193233	195734	I have no idea how we're going to go three hours tonight, but we'll make it.
196154	196894	We'll manage somehow.
197855	198735	Thank you guys for listening.
198775	201717	We're going to do some pop-up music stuff, and we'll be right back.
201737	202817	This is all from Pop-Up Music 6.
203237	209360	So especially the pop-up music club that wrote us a letter a couple weeks back saying we need to play more pop-up music.
209380	210001	That'll make a Matthew.
210061	210801	Oh, hello, Irene.
214758	217780	If anyone wants to go Rocky, maybe even in SoCal.
219620	220041	Tonight.
220801	221922	How can we get there tonight?
222642	223562	That would be fun.
229686	230966	I'm sorry, I'm being talked to on the phone.
231286	232747	I think now is a very good time to go to break.
232767	233267	What do you guys think?
233287	233487	Yes.
233628	234248	Alright, break!
242984	243586	Thanks for watching!
283380	284700	Thanks for watching!
387406	388709	Thanks for watching!
562782	571347	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
571387	577331	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
578152	580073	Hello, boys and girls, you're...
581565	582065	Hello!
582325	583966	No, we don't want another song yet.
584026	585826	Oh, that's what I get for having the thing on repeat.
585846	586747	My bad, my bad.
587927	593789	But I hope you enjoyed the pre-show that we did tonight of all the Beatmania 6th mix music.
595089	595749	It was super.
598530	600051	So, how you kids doing tonight?
601537	602118	I'm fine.
602438	606741	Yes, we're extra special on a Saturday tonight for no real good reason.
606961	610384	No, I mean, we're not going to be here tomorrow night, so we had to do the show sometime.
611025	615949	And when we tend to pre-tape the shows at another location, well, that's just too much work for me.
615989	616849	This is much easier.
618290	622153	I'd have been stupid on a Saturday night like anywhere, like Golfland or Scandi.
622193	623154	You have all these kids around.
623194	624735	Oh my God, it would have been nuts.
624755	625636	What are you doing?
625716	626617	What are you doing?
626817	627858	Why do you have the microphone?
627898	628659	What are you doing?
629199	630320	It's like, go away.
631443	632164	I hate kids.
632404	632964	I really do.
633404	635165	We should sacrifice them to the Dark Lord.
638007	639528	Jamie's especially evil tonight.
643090	651976	Yeah, I went over to Golfland the other day to play some games and there really wasn't anything to play because 5Key was broken, Guitar Freaks was broken, 4th Plus was broken.
651996	655758	This is the sound of me putting my finger down my throat in honor of RVGL.
659437	669046	Yes, but of course, those of you out there listening that aren't from this area have no idea what we're talking about, but it just gets really frustrating when you have all these Bomani games at your local arcade and none of them work.
670748	671228	None of them.
672389	677574	We should send copies of the show to Steve and say, this is the bad press that we're giving you.
678475	678895	Fix it.
680497	682499	He'd probably just ignore it like everything else we've given him.
684989	686830	I'm going to go improve the laser tag.
688871	689732	Okay, let's see.
689932	696135	First, start by making the guns not look like a giant wad of crap wrapped around with electrical tape a thousand times.
697796	699317	They can improve it by making it a QZAR.
700698	701639	Damn right they could.
702239	703460	I'd play it if it was QZAR.
704140	707402	But it's not, so I don't touch it, or go near it, or even think about it.
708703	712505	QZAR is kind of like the supreme of laser tag guns.
712545	713245	There is no other.
713265	714106	There can be only one.
714844	717947	There is only one, because they keep closing the fucking centers down.
719348	719828	I don't know.
720208	722550	There's like one in Concord, and that was like the closest one.
722610	725233	Then there's one in San Fran, I think, and then there's some down south.
725273	725633	Pleasanton?
725713	726594	Oh, Pleasanton.
726634	727735	Yeah, Pleasanton, you know.
728095	728876	They've got one.
728896	730557	I haven't been there in a while.
732018	733319	So, how was your week?
733479	734640	What did you do this week, Jamie?
735581	736121	I worked.
737102	737463	Yay.
737523	738023	And then what?
738063	738964	What did you do in the night time?
740216	741616	I sat in front of my computer.
741756	745877	Oh, we're going to get to that with part of my fight for the week.
747598	749038	I didn't do crap all weekend.
749078	749998	I hung out with people.
750378	751078	Which you did today.
751218	752419	You went and saw Harry Potter again.
752439	753959	I went and saw Harry Potter for the fourth time.
755459	756219	Yes, indeed.
756320	757980	And was it just as good as it was the first time?
758460	758860	Oh, yes.
759080	760981	I need to see it again four more times.
762421	767542	Seriously, I will go see that movie as often as I can before it's out of the theater.
768669	776893	The only movie I ever saw more than twice in the theater, well, besides Rocky Horror, because you see that every week, Moulin Rouge, I saw three times.
776953	778914	I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles four times.
781375	782076	Yes, indeed.
782356	782896	That's so old.
782996	784137	I need to get that on DVD.
784457	785617	I saw Bill and Ted twice.
785837	787438	Well, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.
787458	789319	I saw that twice.
789779	790420	Cool.
790960	793561	And I saw Wrath of Khan twice during its original run in the theater.
793941	794382	Wow.
795642	795882	Neat.
796162	797083	At a theater that burned down.
799651	800372	Smells like burning.
802154	803136	And how was your week, Loki?
803676	804477	Um, I worked.
805138	806660	Well, I guess you could call it working.
807321	810465	I was on the computer downloading shit, as usual.
810705	812087	But this time I was downloading places.
812107	813869	What the hell's that noise?
815331	816873	I don't know, my computer farted, just ignore it.
818049	818770	Thanks for watching!
834887	841031	So I was downloading PlayStation Utilities to attempt to hack a DDR Max 2 disc.
841832	851038	This was a short-lived attempt, seeing as I... This is the one you yacked about a couple weeks ago, about how you're going to have the ultimate DDR mix, but no... Too tough.
851727	854230	It wasn't too tough as I know jack about programming.
854550	858916	Kind of you need to know how to hack something to be able to hack a DDR Max 2 machine.
859637	862460	But since I don't know how to do that, that's obviously not going to work.
863161	865724	All I have to say is there's some weird shit in there.
865864	869368	I mean, the way they do things on the Max 2 disks doesn't make any sense.
870209	876735	and I don't know why they do it because they have like for instance the banners for the songs and everything.
876916	878357	They have them stored in there three times.
878617	886785	They have the executable for Max 2 stored in there about 19 times and then they have like a copy of the actual card that it flashes once.
888268	890329	I was like, why store all this excess data?
890389	891610	I can't find the backgrounds.
891830	893851	I'm not even going to look anymore because I'm just fed up with it.
894171	894532	I'm tired.
894872	896493	Not worth it.
896553	898114	The videos, I know where the videos are.
898134	900095	I know where the music is.
900495	904477	I can't decode it worth shit, so I said forget it.
904698	905298	I just don't care.
905740	907821	No illegal mixes from Loki.
908001	908721	No, nothing.
908761	912582	You know, if it's going to ever come down to it, I'll just buy a machine and run my sim on it.
912722	916603	It's going to be a hundred times easier to maintain and work.
916863	920103	You're just going to have to buy the giant metal pads and just do it that way.
920123	929926	Because really, actually, I was looking at it, there is a limit to how many songs you can put on there because it actually stores a lot of the data on the flash card itself, and the flash card is only 32 megs.
932707	937389	I'm sure you could probably cram more stuff on there, but it looked pretty full as it was.
938549	951655	That's why I'm thinking after Xtreme comes out, they're going to do something else the way they store stuff on there, because there's no way that they're going to be able to fit anything else on Xtreme, because it's all stuck on that stupid flashcard.
953656	956117	It's pretty dumb, because all the graphics are on that stupid flashcard.
956357	963462	Yeah, I'm in the chat room right now, and EOSFBB agrees that you should just put a computer with a SIM inside a DDR cabinet.
964402	972648	If you do want to join our chat room, by the way, just go to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx, and then click on chat, and it tells you how to do it right there.
973048	981694	Of course, since we're taping a day early this week, if you go in there on Sunday night, well, there's still quite a few people in there listening to this for the first time on Sunday night, because people are just used to that.
982631	983572	Brad, tell me about your week.
983592	984452	You're over there in the corner.
984872	985332	What's going on?
985432	985913	What's up?
986413	987093	What's up, my brother?
987233	988334	I have a job now.
988354	989034	You have a job now.
989074	989735	Congratulations.
989775	990175	Yay.
990595	991435	Isn't that fun?
991896	993176	Everybody enjoys that.
993877	995457	No, but I get money now, so that's always good.
995778	996258	Money's good.
996278	997238	What do you spend all your money on?
998279	999359	Rent, bills.
1001720	1003801	I saw you digging through the couch for tokens the other day.
1003821	1004562	That was pretty sad.
1004582	1006243	Fuck you.
1008044	1009266	No, I gamble for tokens.
1010688	1013292	We play poker for tokens.
1015728	1016749	What else did you do this week?
1016769	1018550	Did you do anything fun?
1018930	1019630	See any good movies?
1019670	1020671	Go out and do anything fun?
1020691	1021751	Go play any DDR?
1022572	1024512	No, I played Guitar Freaks.
1024873	1026213	Guitar Freaks is broken now, I hear.
1028654	1030255	No, but I just saw Harry Potter, too.
1030295	1030935	That was pretty good.
1031056	1031756	Harry Potter!
1031876	1033437	I played Metroid Prime yesterday.
1033477	1033917	That was good.
1035798	1036358	Nothing really.
1036398	1037138	See, I have no life.
1037158	1038179	I just work.
1038664	1041025	I wanted to buy Metroid Prime today, but I'm holding off.
1041065	1042186	You should buy it.
1042226	1046467	Well, I have a gift card at Target that'll give me money off, so I figured I'll just use my gift card.
1046507	1049388	Yeah, that's the next best GameCube game you should get.
1050169	1051930	I want games.
1053890	1054391	I give you games.
1054411	1056171	Now that I have some money, I can go buy games.
1056671	1057772	Jamie's reaching for my mic.
1059494	1060435	I can lend you games.
1061415	1061776	Ooh!
1061796	1062256	Definitely.
1062276	1062356	Cool.
1062416	1064077	You can borrow Luigi's Banshan.
1064818	1065298	Hooray.
1065498	1066619	I heard that game sucks.
1066939	1067960	It's actually kind of neat.
1068140	1070522	If you like puzzling, you know, little puzzles to solve.
1070682	1073524	I wish they put out a version of DDR on the GameCube, actually.
1073584	1075866	I kind of have this secret desire for DDR on the GameCube.
1075886	1076566	I don't know why.
1076967	1079048	I just think it would be, like, overly cutesy and fun.
1079469	1080649	Like, oha, but cool.
1081670	1084851	Well, Oha's cool, but Oha only has like seven songs on it.
1085892	1090174	So they need to do like a 70 song DDR Oha for GameCube.
1091294	1092174	You and that damn parrot!
1096716	1098777	Um, I can lend you monkey ball.
1099697	1100758	You can lend me monkey balls?
1100838	1101218	Yeah.
1102238	1103719	That's okay, I was in here eating nuts.
1105900	1108461	This conversation has turned dreadfully perverted.
1108863	1110524	We have no idea what we're going to be talking about tonight.
1110584	1111885	So wait, I came in late.
1111945	1113346	I know this is going to be boring for everybody else.
1113366	1113746	That's alright.
1113906	1117168	Did Matt get a, he got the flashcard finally, or what?
1117909	1118889	You were looking at the flashcard?
1118929	1120510	He's basically given up on the sim.
1120590	1123973	He got, he obtained super secret copies of the Max 2 discs.
1124433	1124553	Oh.
1124853	1129056	and was able to look at them and then thought, God, this really sucks.
1129136	1130818	This is hard to hack, so fuck it.
1131238	1137443	Maybe we should enlist a certain person whose name starts with R-I and ends with a C-K.
1137943	1140685	He's good with programming and coding, and you can look at it.
1142106	1143307	Yeah, I'm serious.
1144517	1145157	What do you think, Matt?
1145617	1146598	Did you give it a try?
1146818	1147838	I don't care whatever.
1149159	1149839	He just gave up.
1149899	1153360	I just don't give a crap anymore.
1153420	1156061	I mean, I did get something good out of it that I already kind of had.
1156422	1159003	I got high-res banners for everything that's in Max 2.
1159583	1162244	I mean, Max 2 and all the old songs.
1162264	1164845	So I have super high-res banners now for that, which is kind of cool.
1165545	1170809	And, um, I did find out a little bit how Max 2 works, but I really just don't care.
1171950	1180456	Now, the person that gave me the disc said he had some friends in places that know how to do this kind of cracking stuff and said he was going to give it to them and let them, you know, go at it.
1180516	1183698	But, I mean, I haven't heard of anything.
1183718	1185699	I'll have to ask him and see if he's going to do that.
1185739	1188621	Because if he did that and they figured it out, then yeah, I could go ahead and do it.
1188681	1192664	But, right now... Stop it.
1196465	1197987	Oops.
1198007	1198968	Stop that.
1199308	1199709	Just now.
1202432	1209560	Anyways, aside from trying to get that thing to work, I was watching Taken all week long.
1212043	1213565	I'm talking into a squirrel's penis.
1218135	1220056	That was not in studio right now, which is everybody.
1220076	1229360	The bush baby has a big black... Jamie's playing with a microphone to make it look like the ferret has a penis, and it's really wrong, and it's just kind of sitting there limp.
1230041	1232542	And Jamie's screaming, oh my god, it has a big black penis.
1235483	1236424	You guys are weird.
1237424	1240926	This is an interesting episode of Orange Lounge already, I can tell.
1241300	1244081	It's just as much of a train wreck as our other pre-taped shows, what can you say?
1245462	1247863	We just don't have the magic when it's not Sunday.
1248284	1250885	It's not my fault they didn't do anything to the Monty community.
1251065	1253546	Everyone's freaking lazy and shopping instead.
1253826	1254907	Oh yeah, out shopping.
1254947	1255587	All their fault.
1256468	1259069	Which, by the way, is going to tie into our listless topic tonight.
1259609	1264052	But, uh, yeah, stuff did happen, it's just, you know, minor stuff.
1265573	1266333	What, stupid stuff?
1266949	1267950	Yeah, stupid stuff.
1269851	1272853	Some stupid news that doesn't apply to anyone here in the United States.
1273193	1281438	Euromix2, they finally figured out the speed modifier code because the retards at Konami of Europe or whatever decided, hey, you know what?
1281758	1285881	Putting in a menu where you can select options is so not European.
1286261	1292385	Let's just have it where you just do the nice little arrow combinations on the pad and that way you can get codes that way.
1292685	1295487	So they didn't really tell them what the codes were, you know, for speed modifiers.
1295548	1297829	They knew they were there, they just couldn't access them.
1298150	1304795	And finally someone figured out what it is, and now they have, like, you know, 1.5 speed and 2 speed like we have over here, which is retarded.
1306497	1308439	Stupid Europeans, you know, what can I say?
1308459	1310760	Hey now, be nice.
1311561	1314864	A rogue was just going to tell you the same thing, they figured out the Euromix speed codes today.
1315364	1318207	So, almost beat you to it if there wasn't that delay.
1320857	1322738	Oh my gosh, Jamie has a hole in her crotch.
1324700	1328824	No, I think it happened when I got snagged when I was getting out of the car.
1329705	1330065	My car.
1331086	1332247	Think of it this way, easy access.
1333889	1336651	Okay, it's on the front by the zipper, okay?
1337332	1339013	Not anywhere near low enough.
1340475	1342016	This means that I gotta go buy new jeans.
1342857	1343598	People give me money.
1345894	1346575	I got a penny.
1348096	1349197	So do I. That's it.
1349538	1350919	What was I taking up a collection for?
1350939	1355904	We were at a party, a small little party last night, and I remember I was taking up a collection for something, and I got a penny.
1355924	1357205	We need the dead baby fund.
1357225	1357485	What?
1357665	1358526	Dead baby fund?
1358566	1358806	What?
1358846	1359347	You're gross.
1359827	1362490	Like Kobe, it is... Never mind.
1362530	1365292	You're... Oh my god, you are awful.
1367254	1368936	That's an inside joke we're going to tell off there.
1371238	1371839	No, I'm sorry.
1371879	1375102	I'm in a semi-foul mood.
1376303	1377244	Which is perfect for radio.
1377264	1377724	Why is this?
1378325	1379246	Why are you in a foul mood?
1379906	1380927	None of anyone's business.
1380987	1381468	I'm allowed.
1381488	1381968	I'm a chick.
1382028	1382929	Are you PMSing?
1383069	1383349	No.
1385371	1386052	Are you pregnant?
1386192	1386732	No!
1386752	1388935	Oh, thank God.
1389815	1390896	I got the ferret thrown at me.
1392598	1392798	No.
1398305	1399086	Well, I can understand.
1399126	1402868	She's got a hole in her jeans, pretty soon to be bigger, you know, you never know.
1406070	1407391	Are you building an interocitor in there?
1407631	1408051	No!
1410833	1411894	I don't know that reference.
1413595	1416277	I didn't see it.
1417578	1418838	Are you boys playing nice in there?
1419019	1419339	No!
1419519	1420460	Are you building an interocitor?
1420600	1420840	No!
1424786	1425286	Let's see.
1425406	1427447	Let's go to the mailbag.
1429108	1429668	Why don't I do that?
1429708	1430848	Let's open up the mailbag.
1430908	1431988	Hello, kitty.
1432609	1433589	Hello, kitty.
1433809	1437470	I'm going to play some moha next break because the chatroom demands it.
1437890	1438390	Hi.
1441431	1442512	And now the ferret will entertain.
1442532	1442992	Hold on.
1443232	1444232	I'm going to our mailbag.
1445353	1446353	Stop looking at DDR Freak.
1448411	1449772	I don't go to that noob site.
1449832	1450973	What are you talking about?
1451293	1455276	There's a couple FUs in here.
1455296	1456196	We'll do those later.
1456336	1456937	Oh, here's one.
1457517	1458838	Oh, I do have an email to read.
1458858	1459278	What do you know?
1459318	1461000	Let's get the email reading music, shall we?
1463321	1464142	Hunting for music.
1464162	1464882	Hunting for music.
1464922	1468365	Here, I will read a page out of Harry Potter.
1468405	1469145	Hunting for music.
1477106	1478807	I will read a page out of this book.
1480648	1482429	Oh, are you going to read a page out of Harry Potter?
1482489	1482870	Not really.
1483170	1483550	Oh, okay.
1483610	1487052	Because seeing as how I sat here during the pre-show and read the whole book.
1487152	1489334	Alright, here we go, here we go.
1491275	1492275	We've got an email.
1494837	1500540	And it's from the OMGPMTHPSOGTHP Network.
1501741	1502081	Word.
1502181	1503122	And it reads as follows.
1504477	1507882	Loki should have his own show where he sets fire to the French.
1508683	1509605	Damn those French.
1510005	1512489	They annoy me so with their Frenchness.
1513030	1513991	Your show rocks.
1514111	1519559	We here at the OMG PMT HPS OGTHP Network are very pleased.
1520180	1527744	We will continue to show support to your show and we'll sacrifice one virgin every week so that we may hear you play Instant Love again.
1527845	1529145	Play Instant Love, you must.
1529606	1531847	We demand it or Kung Fu Squirrels will rain upon you.
1532227	1532627	Thank you.
1532927	1538150	The preceded message was brought to you by the Oh My God, Please Make the Horrible Pain Stop, Oh God, the Horrible Pain Network.
1539391	1540652	I think we should give in to their demands.
1540672	1541252	That was beautiful.
1541512	1542913	Well, we just played Instant Love last week.
1542933	1543514	We know what we should do.
1543534	1543774	I don't care.
1543794	1544174	We'll play it again.
1544194	1544714	You know what we should do?
1544734	1547016	Why don't we put Instant Love in the normal rotation?
1547216	1548637	The music rotation for when we're not here.
1548657	1549337	Instant Love is special.
1549961	1552202	Are you saying that our music show's not special?
1553322	1556263	No wonder no one listens to it, because you told them that it's not special.
1556283	1557563	Special enough for the Olympics.
1557943	1558183	Hey!
1559344	1561924	Our show is special, but Instant Love is special.
1561944	1563365	Fine, we'll play Instant Love.
1563465	1563785	God.
1564305	1564965	Goddamn.
1566545	1567606	You guys are such bitches.
1569066	1570627	And that's all the email we got.
1570827	1573429	So, that's all I'm reading for you.
1573449	1576250	That's, of course, one more email than we got last week.
1576330	1577571	So, actually, no, it's not.
1577611	1578351	We did get an email.
1578452	1584635	But if you want to send us an email, go ahead and send us an email to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
1584835	1586336	And sign up for our LiveJournal community.
1586356	1587917	And then sign up for the LiveJournal community.
1588077	1591039	And, like, sacrifice your balls to...
1592685	1594486	We like to be nosy and read all your journals.
1595026	1599187	Were you just strangling the squirrel-ferret thing with the mic cord?
1599928	1601448	No, the squirrel was doing it itself.
1601528	1603149	It was auto-erotic asphyxiation.
1604909	1605309	Oh my!
1605570	1606350	Excuse me!
1606550	1607570	I'm still breathing!
1608631	1609111	Okay!
1609311	1610491	That's just a nice term.
1610611	1612732	It just rolls off the tongue to say.
1616296	1623240	We're going to take a really quick break at this point and we're going to come back and we're going to play a brand new game.
1623541	1624761	You guys are weird.
1624781	1629224	Okay, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to play a brand new game.
1629285	1631846	However, I need two contestants for this game.
1631886	1633748	So we're going to take contestants from the chat room.
1634088	1635509	We're going to all be the celebrities.
1635689	1636850	Loki, you get to be a celebrity tonight.
1637330	1638691	You don't get to be a contestant, you're a celebrity.
1639577	1640598	Yay, does that mean I get here?
1640698	1643681	Okay, so, this is the question.
1643721	1650706	Okay, the first two people to private message me with the right answer to this question will get to play our new game, our new secret game.
1652628	1654450	Who was, this is going to be easy, it's easy.
1654850	1660014	Who was the artist that did the song Young Forever?
1660595	1662917	Who was the artist that did that song in 4th Mix?
1663457	1665599	First two people to PM me the answer, get to play.
1667020	1669962	Alright, so that's it, and we will be right back.
1669982	1671043	Who PM'd me the correct answer?
1671483	1671683	Huh?
1671943	1673364	Yeah, you have to PM me the correct answer.
1673885	1674605	It's a game show.
1674645	1675105	Just not an answer.
1675125	1678448	So the first two people that... Like, you can't, you know, PM... Oh, it was Bob!
1679308	1679969	And expect to play.
1680449	1682290	Yes, you have to PM me the correct answer.
1682350	1684812	Who was the artist that did Young Forever?
1684872	1689035	Because a lot of people forget some of the Dance Mania artists sometimes, so I figured that's a good one to ask you guys.
1689055	1690295	Okay, I'm going to take a quick break.
1690395	1693077	As requested by the chat room, the chat room demands it.
1694338	1695499	We're going to hear some oha.
1697421	1697901	We'll be back.
1726696	1727156	Oha!
1727196	1727436	Oha!

2175231	2176632	One of our contestants ran away.
2177152	2177772	That's scary.
2178613	2185076	So we're going to have to take the next person that clocked in, which I don't know now because I closed out all the windows.
2187825	2194547	Okay, I'm taking, I believe the next person who logged in with the answer was 23rd Magus, so we're going to take him instead.

2211331	2211851	Okay, here we go.
2214452	2215292	The first question.
2216843	2219444	Does everybody in the room have a pen?
2221025	2221265	Okay.
2223546	2223847	Here we go.
2223887	2225267	This is the first one.
2227308	2232691	Nelson the Newbie was so excited to be playing Dance Dance Revolution for the very first time.
2233371	2238554	He had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it was really blank.
2241460	2246143	Nelson the Newbie was so excited to be playing Dance Dance Revolution for the very first time.
2246804	2251787	He had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it was really blank.
2258852	2259633	Everybody's thinking.
2268960	2270801	I still need answers from both contestants.
2277890	2278970	Yo, answer now.
2280330	2281710	Before I poke your eye out with a spoon.
2284271	2284571	Okay.
2285771	2287051	Let's give him a little more thinking time.
2287311	2288171	No, I'm still missing one.
2290532	2291992	He's probably trying to come up with something clever.
2295973	2296933	Okay, he's clocked in.
2299393	2300574	Okay.
2300594	2302594	He had quite a little bit of an answer there.
2302634	2302874	Okay.
2305012	2306853	So let's see what the answers were.
2307373	2315416	Our contestant said, EOSVB says, Nelson the newbie was so excited to be playing Dance Dance Revolution for the very first time.
2315476	2324940	He had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it was really thin, almost to the point where they looked like they were strung out on heroin, but it was from all the cardio.
2326000	2326421	Wow.
2326441	2328301	All right.
2328421	2329802	23rd Magus' answer is...

2337000	2337460	Popular.
2337520	2341302	Okay, so we have popular and looked like they were strung out on heroin.

2375052	2375572	No, just kidding.
2375592	2376152	That's not my answer.
2376512	2376972	Greasy.
2377472	2378753	Was really greasy.
2380353	2382334	I'm sorry, that doesn't match either.

2383575	2388818	Okay, and my answer was, he had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it was really gay.
2388878	2389998	I did put gay, actually.
2393060	2395721	So, that means it's all tied up at 0-0.
2395821	2397002	You all loser!
2397362	2399323	They're both losers so far, but that's okay.

3001166	3002927	Yeah, I mean, it would have almost been a match.
3003547	3003847	Alright.

3028308	3030649	So I suggest you get this one right.
3030729	3031069	Okay.
3032130	3032971	I'm getting mean now.
3033671	3034692	Let's go back to the first music.

3145148	3145488	What? !
3147734	3149174	Well, he said he was trying to match you.
3151235	3151555	All right.
3152896	3157557	23rd Magus says, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a fag.
3159778	3160498	Heaven forbid.
3161678	3162359	All right, Jamie.
3162959	3165740	Let's see if VO said VB got that match he was hoping for.
3166180	3171921	Bradley the Bully was the best beatmania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a... Propel, wow.

3187735	3188436	All right, next.
3190437	3194799	He would call him a cab so he'd have a chance to get away before he beats his ass.
3195259	3196420	Ah, call him a cab.
3196840	3198081	I'm sorry, that doesn't match.
3199441	3199821	All right.
3200202	3201762	We have some funny answers from the chat room.
3201782	3204484	Jabberwocky says he'd call you later that night for a date.
3205652	3208433	or he'd call you a Michael Jackson wannabe with a nose and no baby.
3210834	3217237	And he'd call you a cheese, windmill, Carl Sagan pocket watch, ass blaster.
3220739	3222340	What an ass bandit.
3222440	3223940	A pansy ass stupid fuck.
3224020	3224361	Okay.
3225421	3226161	Let's moving on.
3226201	3226522	Moving on.
3226562	3227642	Trying to match our contestants.
3227702	3231024	We have a propel and we have a fag.
3231304	3231584	I did?
3231704	3232464	Let's moving on.
3232584	3233345	Let's moving on.
3235461	3236561	Let's moving on!
3237922	3238222	Moving on.
3238742	3246925	Okay, if you distracted him to talk about DDR, Loki, he'd call you a... Well, you know, I had two, but this was my first answer, was Fag.
3247706	3247906	Oh!
3248626	3252227	My second answer was Fiery Monkey Pirate, but... Which one are you going to go with?
3252428	3253168	I'm going with Fag.
3253208	3253968	You're going with Fag?
3253988	3254608	That was my first one.
3254668	3256049	Oh my gosh, we have a match!
3256389	3259770	Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding!
3259790	3259850	Yay!
3259970	3261791	Okay, 23rd Magus is ahead by one.
3261871	3262751	He did get a match.
3263512	3263812	So...
3264705	3267947	Somebody had to have said Propel for EOSVB to win.
3268928	3269288	Lead me.
3269728	3270048	Okay.
3270088	3270629	Lead me out.
3270889	3273491	He'd call you a... Propel.
3273591	3274051	No, just kidding.
3276332	3278934	I, Bradley, would call him a cock-smoking clerk.
3279174	3280695	A cock-smoking clerk.
3280795	3281636	I'm sorry.
3282256	3283177	That isn't a match.
3286039	3287760	And Brad gets the Kevin Smith Award.
3287820	3290541	EOSVB wants to change his answer to Animal Crossing.
3290561	3290722	Too late.
3290742	3291562	I was about to say that, too.
3291662	3292983	I was about to say that.
3293653	3294553	Okay, my answer.
3295473	3303475	Bradley the Bully was the best Beatmania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a sacramental.
3307716	3309397	No, that's more the chibi mental.
3316278	3318379	Wow, this game was a blank.
3318619	3318899	Wow.
3320552	3325156	Alright, so our winner was 23rd Magus with a score of 0-1.
3325236	3326277	Yay!
3326357	3326917	Yay!
3327057	3327738	Congratulations.
3328218	3329059	You know what that means?
3329919	3331521	He gets to play the bonus round.
3334043	3334523	Yay!
3334583	3337185	Okay, so 23rd Magus gets to play the bonus round.
3338126	3341529	I'll be taking only 23rd Magus' question on this question.
3341569	3341949	Here we go.
3344511	3347733	This segment on Orange Lounge was really, really blank.
3351480	3354261	This segment on Orange Lounge was really, really blank.
3355321	3357722	23rd Magus gets to play the bonus round on this one.
3361103	3364664	This segment on Orange Lounge was really, really blank.
3371906	3372566	Everybody have an answer?
3374507	3375867	Okay, everybody's got an answer?
3376707	3377968	I'm just waiting for our contestant.
3378788	3379268	Okay, here we go.
3382388	3383009	The bonus round.
3383049	3387732	This segment on Orange Lounge, according to 23rd Magus, was really, really random.
3389353	3389854	Good answer.
3389934	3390934	Good logical answer.
3391034	3392215	You will probably lose.
3392435	3392716	All right.
3392976	3396879	Jamie, this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really... Random.
3397279	3397819	Random!
3397839	3399060	A match!
3399240	3399861	Very good.
3399921	3400361	Very good.
3400401	3400781	All right.
3400842	3401902	Logic prevails.
3401922	3403503	23rd Magus gets a point.
3403523	3404364	That's $100 of Monopoly money.
3409435	3410575	That you're not going to get.
3410595	3411536	That you're not going to get.
3411937	3416120	Okay, this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really... Ooh, Animal Crossing.
3416820	3418082	Ooh, Animal Crossing.
3418702	3423146	All right, Loki, this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really... A complete waste of my time.
3423166	3425067	A complete waste... It did take up a good half an hour.
3426328	3428550	It was really, really fiery-ass Monkey Pirate.
3428570	3430391	It was really fiery-ass Monkey Pirate.
3430411	3430752	Beautiful.
3432659	3439102	Brad, this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really... Cunt shit, colic balls, ass dick, fucker... Colic balls?
3440642	3443504	This segment on Orange Lounge was really, really colic balls.
3444904	3446465	I have colitis.
3447805	3451547	And my answer was, this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really propel.
3453388	3454748	Some people in the chatroom got it.
3455609	3455849	Oh, well.
3456554	3459955	So 23rd Magus won $100 of Monopoly money.
3460615	3461316	I'll buy him some Propel.
3461336	3462556	So congratulations.
3462896	3463956	Oh, he's going to get some Propel.
3463996	3465217	And I'll beat him with the variant.
3465297	3465637	All right.
3467578	3468538	Congratulations.
3468658	3469798	Thank you, you guys.
3470198	3475600	We're going to take a quick break, and we'll come back to talk about some more Beemani stuff.
3476540	3478181	In the meantime, you demanded it.
3478281	3479521	The chat room demanded it.
3480522	3482662	The studio demanded it by request.
3482722	3483282	Colic Balls?
3483723	3484623	No, not Colic Balls.
3485269	3491415	Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.
3492537	3497161	I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.
3497802	3500384	Listen carefully and try to follow.
3501285	3504929	The objects will come down from the top when it hits the red line.
3510881	3511684	and The Table!
3512246	3513029	You get it?
3513411	3515118	Alright, let's practice!
3542093	3544438	are both white and blackies.
3569531	3572973	Now it's all the keys and the turntable.
3573033	3573874	It's hard, but you can do it!
3661650	3664431	All right, Loki, please introduce this next song, because it's kind of weird.
3664591	3668612	Okay, before I came over today, I found one of the strangest Paranoia remixes ever.
3668832	3675574	It's the first, probably only, all-Spanish, Latin Paranoia remix.
3675674	3679054	It's Paranoia Acueca, or whatever that means, I don't know.
3679694	3680115	All right.
3680635	3681895	And there's a DWI for it, too.
3681935	3682335	Enjoy.
3683195	3683935	All right.
3725836	3727838	Take it baby Bring it on down
3819918	3821585	Thanks for watching!
3965271	3965812	Thanks for watching!
4015598	4021361	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry
4025976	4032159	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio semi-live for December the 8th.
4032519	4034300	We're actually taping on December the 7th.
4035301	4038122	So some of you are already tuned in right now here on Saturday night.
4038383	4041564	But it will be rebroadcast in its entirety on Sunday night at the normal time.
4042225	4043605	Just so people don't get too confused.
4044005	4044206	Right.
4044686	4048968	But if you're in the chat room wondering why you can't really participate live with the show tonight, that's why.
4048988	4050129	Because we tape today early.
4050709	4051309	We're on Saturday.
4052390	4052570	So...
4054147	4059288	We're back and don't have a lot to talk about, so this is the point where we usually would let Loki do a sim update.
4059308	4059509	So!
4060754	4062595	Loki, what's going on in the sim world this week?
4063696	4064236	Not too much.
4064256	4067958	They're wrapping up with the submissions for Attorney Mix 3.
4068278	4069879	Those are due next Sunday.
4070499	4072640	That will be, I believe, the 15th.
4072780	4077462	So make sure they have your stuff in by, I would say, by 9 p.m.
4077502	4078163	at the latest.
4078983	4080324	Definitely way before that, though.
4080384	4083045	But try to get your stuff in for Attorney Mix 3.
4083706	4086347	And then, I believe, a week after that,
4086827	4089888	They will be having actual submissions up on the web.
4089968	4091929	They should be up for about one whole week.
4091989	4094589	So you want to get them then while you still can.
4095790	4098090	Aside from that, there's a few other things to know.
4098450	4107253	In DDR Mania X, they've got in their user submitted files for them, they have a nice little list of every single site that has DWIs on it.
4107533	4113895	And that's where actually that Paranoia Remix came from because there is a DWI out there for that Paranoia Remix.
4114895	4118618	So check that out, and you can always increase your collection that way.
4119298	4123461	And just do watch that forum, they have some pretty good files that have come out recently.
4123521	4126463	I just got one for Baby Got Back, you gotta love that song.
4126563	4128844	So definitely keep an eye on that.
4129285	4132667	And also, nothing really new with Stepmania.
4133527	4141373	I have checked their site, and it looks like they are in preparations for starting betas for version 4, but...
4142902	4144523	Nothing really announced yet.
4144883	4147104	And DWI, I don't really care about them.
4147624	4150645	But they are actually updating now and trying to play catch-up.
4150745	4152406	So I've got to give them credit for that.
4152486	4154667	But aside from that, not too much going on.
4154787	4155528	Oh, wait.
4156828	4162691	Also, this week happened to be a week that we saw brand new DDRPC characters.
4163051	4163491	Woo-hoo!
4164211	4166512	Reggie and some chick.
4166612	4167493	I don't know what her name was.
4167533	4167853	Sabrina.
4167973	4168953	Sabrina, whatever.
4170174	4170274	Um...
4171317	4173580	I don't really know what these are.
4173980	4176724	I mean, Reggie looks like he's got this giant dunce hat on.
4176744	4177825	He's holding a dog with a bow.
4178566	4182070	And then there's Sabrina who's in a bunny costume.
4183035	4185916	Didn't they figure out, aren't they on their way to hacking the PC characters?
4186456	4186916	Just about?
4187597	4196540	You were referencing something like on one of the boards that they found a way somehow to hack the PC characters or you can load them in a program or something?
4196980	4197640	No, they're full of shit.
4198300	4200201	So I did look at that.
4200681	4207644	All that you get from looking at the one file they were talking about, the bin file I believe, is you just get a nice little shot of their face.
4208204	4208564	That's it.
4209244	4210685	Sabrina the Teenage Bitch.
4211109	4215853	Yes, so you've got this dog fucker and you've got some vampire bunny.
4216113	4219255	That's what your characters are this week, dog fucker and vampire bunny.
4219576	4221117	Nothing compares to Mr. Spanky.
4221197	4223459	Maybe we should have Mr. Spanky back on the show.
4225360	4225761	Why not?
4226661	4228623	I think we'll have Mr. Spanky back on the show a little later.
4230020	4244075	Yeah, so if you're still playing DDRPC, and to be honest I don't know why you would, do check those out because really I think DDRPC lost its, I don't know, interest a couple days after it came out.
4245677	4247279	Oh, I've played all these songs before.
4247990	4250111	Yeah, it's like, oh, wait, this was fourth mix.
4250211	4253092	I'll wait until we can hack this and put new songs in.
4253412	4260955	Other things that should be noted is there was, I guess you could call them preview versions of Bag and Paranoia Survivor on the net.
4261295	4267398	Actually, I should say really ass copies of Bag and Paranoia Survivor that were on Bimani style.
4267958	4269559	They were, hey, guess what, Loki?
4269899	4270699	I've got them right here.
4270779	4272200	Want to hear a little bit of Bag?
4272240	4273040	Yeah, let's hear it.
4273120	4275161	All right, here's a little bit of Bag, if you guys haven't heard it yet.
4275181	4276902	Now, it's really, really quiet, so bear with us.
4276942	4277262	Here it is.
4289665	4290646	You can kind of hear the bagpipe.
4290726	4291587	It's Riverdance!
4327051	4327791	Yeah, woohoo.
4328492	4328932	What do you think?
4329653	4330633	I think it's crap.
4330673	4336417	What it sounds like, it sounds like it's going to be like Orion 78, except it's going to be with bagpipes.
4336777	4342100	It's pretty much half the speed, you know, down to 65 for, you know, the steps to be really close together.
4342180	4343040	It's just going to be Orion.
4343141	4344201	That's all it is.
4345482	4350545	It's actually the kind of music I listen to when I'm trying to relax and calm down, so I like it.
4352446	4355708	I have all kinds of CDs like that at home, so it's right up my alley.
4358343	4361007	Okay, want to hear Paranoia Survivor?
4361047	4363750	I don't even think you can really hear this one, but I'll play a little bit of it.
4363770	4365412	It's a whole thing, but you can barely hear it.
4365633	4366554	It's a lot better in the video.
4366574	4370138	If you watch the videos, definitely listen to it there.
4370659	4371580	You can barely hear it.
4372041	4373423	It's not even really worth playing to you guys.
4381084	4381825	I can't even really hear it.
4381925	4388010	So, yeah, I would get the videos, but I can't play videos over the air because we get a lot of droppage.
4388531	4390773	So, that was a little bit.
4391233	4395877	It was, I mean, from what I've gathered from the videos, it was a pretty cool sounding song.
4397198	4403884	It's just, you know, you can't really listen to it on the videos because they don't have, you know, anyone that can rip it yet.
4404285	4407287	Because, you know, the Konami stuff's like, no, don't do that.
4407307	4408028	Yeah.
4408368	4411871	So, yeah, not too much to see there either.
4413592	4416454	Yeah, really been kind of a slow week in the whole Bomani community.
4416474	4417995	It's just nothing going on.
4418015	4419196	Yeah, it's just kind of that time of year.
4419236	4423298	There's really not anything to really do between Thanksgiving and Christmas except shop.
4423398	4428242	So, there's probably not going to be... I mean, DDR Max USA came out for the holiday season.
4428282	4429022	That was really the last thing.
4429042	4431364	We're probably not going to see anything until the beginning of the new year.
4431404	4435307	Unless, you know, you got Beatmania 7th Mix that's coming out for PlayStation on Christmas Eve.
4436067	4464400	but that's about the only Bomani release coming up and then in the new year we're going to see Max 2 for Japanese Playstation 2 and what the hell 2DX7 style, yes probably next year and probably also Max 2 USA at some point but I don't know I don't even know what I haven't heard anything as far as how well Max USA actually sold I think we probably won't get any numbers until actually after the holidays we can look into that
4465600	4468902	I don't know too much about that, unfortunately
4488191	4503196	Yeah, I did notice that they have, you know, like DDR, they have the $2,000 metal pads, which are kind of a rip-off, but they also have, you know, as people are aware of, the 2DX arcade controllers, and they also have a pop music arcade controller, too.
4503336	4503556	Yes.
4504156	4505096	Question from chat room.
4505356	4507457	When is DDR Extreme going to be released?
4507557	4509097	Ooh, Brad brings back toys for us.
4509137	4509437	Yay.
4510038	4513159	Propel and food and drinks.
4513239	4513519	Anyway.
4517160	4517700	That's our...
4518482	4519042	Yeah.
4519983	4520103	Oh.
4520323	4520523	Yeah?
4520984	4521204	Yeah.
4521644	4522425	I said root beer.
4523666	4523826	Yeah.
4524546	4524807	Cool.
4524827	4525347	I got root beer.
4525627	4525847	Okay.
4526408	4526688	I'm sorry.
4526728	4526868	Yes.
4527268	4528089	Loki, you want to answer that?
4528129	4529130	When's Extreme going to be released?
4529310	4529990	Early next year.
4530090	4531972	Probably, they're saying January.
4534153	4536615	I would say probably the first three months of next year.
4537295	4538656	So, first quarter next year.
4539897	4558201	Rumor is it's going to debut at some tournament, but I don't possibly see how that could be the case because it's a Japanese game, so if it's going to debut anywhere, it's going to debut somewhere in Japan, and places in America will just get it whenever their distributors get it, so I don't think there's any particular way that you can debut a game.
4558501	4564983	Now, that particular arcade might debut their game at the tournament, but you really can't control the rest of the U.S.
4565023	4565303	that way.
4567984	4568324	I got it.
4568605	4568885	Alright.
4570126	4571927	So that's hopefully answers about Extreme.
4572348	4578252	Well, also right now the betas are only up to like 55 or 60% done.
4578312	4580594	Probably because they don't have many of the Dance Media tracks in them.
4580614	4582096	They have some, but not many.
4582276	4588040	Yes, I mean, we've still got plenty of songs that they have to add and test first before that even happens.
4589261	4591023	So, it's still a ways away.
4595216	4595777	Okay.
4597080	4599907	Chatroom's been talking a lot about this, and I thought maybe we would too.
4599987	4600809	Upcoming tournaments.
4600909	4602453	There are a few tournaments coming up.
4603054	4604417	I thought I'd mention a few of them.
4605444	4612611	This Friday, if I'm not mistaken, yes, this Friday, is the Miguel Milpitas Golf Land Evil Tournament Part 2, the Aftermath.
4612631	4615074	Yes, the arcade that just got Derby's Owners Club this week.
4615614	4619198	They're doing a tournament, and that should be a lot of fun.
4619679	4623182	It's on a Friday night, so it's kind of like a big giant Friday night party.
4623883	4627206	And they're doing the typical Perfect Attack and...
4629068	4630909	Freestyle competitions.
4630969	4632990	However, they're trying some new things with both of them.
4633911	4637273	So there's some new things that they're doing.
4637293	4640975	And if you want to visit their website, it's www.monkeysfly.net.
4642977	4644578	If you can at all make it, please go to that one.
4645431	4654216	and Perfect Attack Rules, let's see, they're going to announce the qualifying song that day and they're going to be doing the brackets a little bit of a different way.
4654697	4657678	Freestyle is going to be doing this tower system.
4657939	4660240	It's a brand new way of judging freestyle, so that should be interesting.
4660260	4665283	They're going to be doing some new innovative judging and ranking of that tournament, so check it out.
4667250	4674675	Also coming up, we've got the Cyber Beat Nation Tournament in LA.
4674935	4677496	That's going to be February 14th through the 16th.
4677836	4681098	That's a Thursday through a Saturday, if I'm not mistaken.
4682119	4684961	Orange Lounge Radio will be covering this tournament, for sure.
4685041	4688663	Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to make it to Milpitas on Friday.
4688763	4690704	Jamie, I don't think you're going to be able to go because you've got work.
4690764	4691545	You've got the work thing.
4691885	4692806	Loki, you too, right?
4694156	4696018	We all work, unfortunately, so we can't get there in time.
4697320	4698702	So we're not going to be able to cover Milpitas.
4698742	4707635	But if any of you fans out there listening to the show got yourself a tape recorder and a microphone, go talk to some people for us and send me stuff.
4707695	4708136	That would be fun.
4709346	4712788	Cyber Beat Nation in L.A., February 14th through 16th.
4712868	4713848	Huge, huge tournament.
4714249	4716450	They're giving away a Max 2 machine in freestyle.
4716830	4718631	They are giving away a Max 2 machine in freestyle.
4718651	4720052	A couple rounds of freestyle they'll be doing.
4720592	4724274	It might be on a DDR Extreme machine, the competition, if it's out by them.
4725094	4729717	Perfect Attack, they're going to give away a Beatmania 2DX arcade-style controller for the winner of Perfect Attack.
4730437	4731919	I'm sorry, but they're not calling it Perfect Attack.
4731939	4736765	They're calling it Stepping Category or Stepping Challenge.
4737525	4739087	Stepping Attack, Step Attack, I don't know.
4739528	4740449	Sorry, I'm messing it up.
4741190	4742791	I'm running through these very quickly.
4742811	4743712	I don't really have a lot of time to...
4745334	4746375	Read into detail on this tournament.
4746395	4751278	But if you want more information on that tournament, it will be coming to DDRspot.com in the next few days.
4751318	4754240	They're going to take some pre-registration there, so keep an eye on that.
4754821	4760185	Or there is a thread in the DDR Freak Torny forum.
4761485	4767229	Early next year in Fremont, there's going to be a competition at a pizza joint and that's run by one of our fans, DCB.
4767689	4771552	He's a cool guy, so I'm sure that's going to be a kick-butt tourney.
4771772	4776055	Outside of California, I'm trying to find some well-responded-to threads.
4776075	4781058	There's going to be a tournament on December 21st in Baltimore, the town that doesn't listen to Orange Lounge.
4782054	4789199	According to our rankings, but there is going to be a tournament at East Point Mall on December 21st in Baltimore, so if you're in that area, you should check it out.
4790400	4795203	December 7th, I know I shouldn't promote that because I don't listen to the show, but you know, you never know.
4796864	4802127	Springfield has a tournament the other day, so that's already done.
4802628	4804369	We don't have results for that yet, my bad.
4805330	4805750	My bad.
4808180	4813484	Um... There's a dancing stage tournament in Sweden coming up.
4813544	4813884	Yay!
4814204	4814905	That should be fun.
4815425	4816986	That should be a fun tournament.
4817687	4818747	Let's go to Sweden.
4818787	4819688	That should be good.
4819708	4822830	Of course, there's no location.
4823050	4825512	All I gotta say is Swedish chicks and DDR.
4825772	4827513	Swedish chicks and DDR.
4827733	4828334	Amen to that.
4828694	4829194	You know what?
4829995	4830475	This, um...
4832676	4833396	Hey, you know what?
4833536	4835417	I still like watching... Can I get a hallelujah?
4835757	4836577	Hallelujah.
4836637	4837618	You know what I will give you?
4838318	4841158	Since we're talking about DDR tournaments in Sweden, this is what I will give you.
4844980	4852362	What does that have to do with that?
4852762	4853122	Oh.
4856043	4856243	Yes.
4857063	4857683	Sweetest chef.
4858143	4859464	Yes, I can squawk like a chicken.
4860264	4860644	Also...
4861849	4866470	There's going to be a tournament on the 14th of December in Wales, in England.
4866550	4868110	It's going to be an English tournament.
4868770	4869971	That's my horrible, horrible English accent.
4869991	4871691	No, Welsh accent is a good bit different.
4871791	4872151	My bad.
4874612	4875072	My bad.
4875112	4876712	Welsh accents are funny to listen to.
4877732	4881433	If anyone wants a good example of a Welsh accent, listen to the parrot sketch.
4882393	4884174	John Cleese's character in the parrot sketch.
4884514	4885994	He is doing a Welsh accent.
4887586	4888908	All right.
4890890	4898861	It's on the other side of the ocean.
4900803	4904608	Somebody just posted in the chat room, really huge, Jabberwocky says, Abba.
4906910	4908251	That'll be a cool Swedish term.
4908271	4908632	You know what?
4908752	4911414	We should probably play some of the erotic ABBA.
4911734	4913155	I think that's a damn good idea.
4913175	4916658	In the next break, we're going to do a tribute to ABBA and Swedish chicks in DDR.
4918640	4925585	In Roanoke Park on December 21st, they're going to be doing a winter charity Perfect Attack tournament for a Red Octane 2 mat.
4926426	4926686	Word.
4927186	4928728	Yes, bring canned goods.
4928928	4931089	The charity is for a Red Octane 2 mat.
4931950	4933932	Buy me a Red Octane 2 mat.
4935262	4937183	No, it's called the Winter Charity Tournament.
4937223	4939564	I don't know... I don't know.
4939724	4943666	I'm assuming that part of the money goes to buy the mat, and the other part goes to charity.
4943886	4944506	That's how it works.
4944526	4944846	Wow.
4945026	4945487	Gasp.
4948508	4949308	Gosh, you guys.
4949368	4950929	Well, maybe... That is another thing.
4950949	4963735	Maybe it's another tournament that's Red Octane sponsored, because Red Octane owns your soul if you play DDR, and they sponsor every tournament except the ones... From what I heard is Red Octane is actually going to be selling some of their products, like their ignition pads, in GameStops now.
4964155	4964395	Ooh!
4967193	4969536	I can get confirmation on that, hello.
4970877	4975962	By the way, nothing like that's been told to me, and I'm always told everything that happens for bad money in relation to GameStop.
4980979	4983200	I don't care, I have Metal Stages, so there!
4984261	4986122	So those were some upcoming tournaments, enjoy.
4987462	4988783	I would love to go to the Swedish one.
4990263	4994245	I want to go... Yeah, I know, Bikini Babes, yeah.
4994705	4995126	Big boner.
4996726	5000808	First of all, playing DDR with no chess support sucks.
5001668	5003849	I can say this safely as the resolution now.
5004069	5005750	Let's ask a girl about their boobs.
5006130	5006471	Jamie!
5006731	5007031	No!
5008155	5008355	Ow!
5008515	5011637	Does it, like, if you were to DDR in the nude, would that really hurt?
5011897	5012998	Would you get slapped in the face?
5013078	5015939	Well, first of all, I haven't, but I have played in my pajamas.
5016059	5016840	Just imagine it.
5019041	5028987	No, it's, imagine having large amounts of your skin pulled away from your flesh and stuffed, and then, imagine jumping up and down like that.
5029847	5030067	Ouch!
5030828	5032208	Come on, every boy wants to know this.
5032248	5033589	What's DDR with boobies like?
5033909	5034470	Painful!
5036285	5039346	What is the best way to... Do you like having your boobs restrained when you play DDR?
5039367	5041207	It's like, you want to tie them down?
5043428	5043768	Shush.
5044869	5046169	No, I have to do the quote.
5046630	5047150	Penfold.
5047710	5048050	Shush.
5049431	5050531	Anyone who gets that is cool.
5052892	5054373	What have we reduced ourselves to?
5057532	5058312	I tried, ladies and gentlemen.
5058332	5060573	I don't know, does it hurt being able to play DDR naked?
5060633	5063073	Do you, like, your balls pop around or something?
5063133	5063413	No.
5063874	5064114	No.
5064774	5067854	Well, actually... No.
5069235	5070115	I don't know what you're talking about.
5071715	5074036	Yeah, my balls aren't D-sized, though, so I would know.
5074056	5076937	They're not even C or B. You need a ball, brah.
5083247	5085288	Who's got the biggest balls of them all?
5085328	5087168	Only a coconut ball bra.
5090689	5091429	Yeah.
5091509	5093249	So nobody in the studio will admit to playing DDR in the nude.
5093269	5095170	Remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an athletic supporter.
5095830	5097790	Nobody in the studio is going to admit to playing DDR in the nude.
5097850	5099130	Hell, I don't play DDR at home.
5099691	5103591	That involves pulling out 45-pound stages, setting them on the ground.
5104051	5104532	Yeah, what?
5104612	5108192	I'm going to take the extra time to strip down naked to play DDR in my front room.
5108552	5109673	Why the hell do they do that?
5109693	5110773	That's stupid.
5113493	5116175	Not to mention that that room is actually kind of small.
5116435	5117516	You've got furniture in there.
5118477	5123100	Yeah, the dogs running around, you know, you're stepping on the fucking chihuahua.
5123500	5125502	I mean, it's just, it's not a pretty picture.
5125542	5126402	Oh, Brad's back in the room.
5126422	5127723	Brad, have you ever played DDR in the nude?
5129605	5131086	That's for me to know and you to find out.
5133648	5135329	Um, actually, honestly, no, I haven't.
5135389	5136150	I've thought about it.
5136710	5138811	I thought about doing intercourse while playing DDR, too.
5139572	5140493	That would be interesting.
5142239	5144540	It's a whole new meaning to the couple dance.
5144620	5147403	Oh, we had somebody in the chatroom admit to doing it at home.
5148383	5150025	Bombay plays DDR in the nude at home.
5150205	5153688	Okay, I definitely can believe that, yeah.
5154468	5156069	Why am I not surprised?
5157411	5158571	Why am I scared?
5160093	5162354	Ow, my freaking ears!
5165657	5167999	Is anybody else admitting to playing DDR in the nude?
5168059	5168659	No, nobody else.
5168820	5169040	Okay.
5171230	5172892	I've played DDR in my pajamas before, though.
5173412	5173893	How was that?
5174634	5175034	Painful.
5175855	5176435	Was it breezy?
5177957	5185504	Well, seeing as how my pajamas usually consist of big flannel pants and a tank top, then no, not very.
5186645	5187066	Okay.
5188107	5189928	Alright, we're going to stop being perverted now.
5190409	5191430	In my old house in the hood.
5192515	5193696	Oh, it's your old house in the hood.
5193936	5194996	Your house in the hood was cool.
5196457	5196697	Okay.
5197918	5199659	Uh... Oh, yes.
5199999	5200819	I need to make the announcement.
5200839	5210744	We're not going to be doing the cage match tonight because last week's song didn't get in until very late in the week and we have the marathon going on all weekend long so it's not hardly getting played at all.
5210784	5212585	Plus, we don't have all of our regular listeners.
5213505	5215506	So tonight's cage match is postponed.
5215526	5219648	Well, can we put both in the rotation?
5219668	5219948	Oh!
5223194	5223355	Yes!
5224295	5224835	No, we can't.
5224895	5225215	You lose.
5225995	5231417	Okay, so, let's see, I'm trying to find my ABBA covers, and I think I only have one.
5232578	5234539	But it's a good one, so we will play that one.
5236419	5237099	If I can find it.
5239440	5241301	However, when we do come back from this break...
5242230	5245193	We are going to do the FUs of the week.
5245313	5248516	So send those to me over private message in the channel right now.
5248636	5249177	Or email them.
5249437	5252120	Or email them to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
5252160	5256164	We're going to do all of your FUs of the week right after this break.
5310298	5324205	It was my only fight Now it isn't true Now everything is new And all I've learned has overturned I lack of you Don't go wasting your emotion
5337443	5338988	Play on your love

5681939	5683559	Thank you for watching!
5708547	5713850	Welcome, welcome, good evening From morning to night
5741432	5742173	S, Actdeft,
5760803	5762684	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5832972	5835454	Bitch, get a new song.
5835674	5839277	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
5860689	5864832	That's right, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, a special taped edition.
5865632	5873497	Tonight, we are taping on Saturday, but we've got a lot of people, a lot of our regulars are joining us here on Saturday night, but if unfortunately you weren't able to listen until Sunday night, that's okay too.
5873617	5874237	We forgive you.
5875278	5878660	We're all going out and getting a life this week, so we had to change a few things.
5879780	5883062	Now comes that part of the show that's everybody's favorite.
5883583	5887465	Jamie, please explain the FU of the week, why it was created, what it's here for.
5888007	5889868	We're pissed and we're not going to take it anymore.
5890088	5891849	We're not going to take it.
5893390	5893910	No!
5895991	5896331	You know what?
5896351	5897171	That's what my new F.U.
5897211	5897852	song is going to be.
5897872	5898412	I don't give a shit.
5898472	5899692	It has nothing to do with Bomani.
5899712	5900573	That's the song I want.
5901593	5901934	Okay.
5902634	5902974	Alright.
5903814	5904395	Here we go.
5904555	5907776	Jamie's going to start it off because she's the most angsty.
5908617	5909097	Yay.
5909517	5910097	So here we go.
5910197	5911378	The F.U.s of the week.
5913724	5917767	Okay, the first thing that gets the big fuck you is my computer.
5918668	5919748	My hard drive died.
5920369	5921269	As in, broken.
5922250	5924131	As in, it wouldn't even reformat.
5925312	5934358	Um, my computer wouldn't boot one morning, so as Dan was off work, so he was gonna put the restore disk in and fix everything and make it happy again, and it did make it happy.
5934799	5936800	It said, C drive is damaged.
5937180	5937421	What? !
5938603	5941190	So I'm sitting here going, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, all day at work.
5942634	5945402	Basically, as it turned out, I did have to buy a new hard drive.
5946607	5954731	Although, the good thing that came out of this is I now have a 120GB hard drive with the 8MB cache, so it's pretty cool.
5956011	5964915	But still, I lost about 60GB worth of information and some photographs that I can't get replaced because my mom's ex-husband destroyed them.
5965675	5966356	Fuck you, Michael.
5967116	5970598	Anyway, not her current husband, Michael, but her ex-husband, Michael.
5970898	5971738	Her current husband's cool.
5971878	5972758	Anyway, that's the best point.
5973659	5973739	Um...
5975561	5980484	It's just distressing because I have, like I said, a lot of stuff on there that I just can't get again.
5982205	5985246	And the ironic thing is that I was going to be backing everything up today.
5986047	5987508	So, that sucks.
5989149	5991590	That's about it.
5991630	5993371	That's your only... Is that an RO again?
5993391	5993431	Oh.
5994812	5995592	Minecraft Online.
5997113	5997493	Alright.
5998154	6000695	Dad, there's nobody for me to play Phantasy Star Online with.
6000775	6001816	As soon as I can, I will.
6001856	6003136	I'm buying that game as soon as it comes out.
6003216	6004057	Or as soon as I can get it.
6005751	6005971	All right?
6006472	6006712	Cool.
6006772	6007252	All right, Matt.
6007533	6007993	Matt's turn.
6011776	6026208	My first idea goes to the creators of DDR Max 2 and the fact that they have to program it so complexly that a simple peon like myself, who has no programming knowledge whatsoever, can't hack it.
6026268	6026508	Why?
6027714	6030395	Why won't you let me mess with it like everyone else does?
6031575	6037036	Anyway, so, yeah, FU to the stupid Max2Discs, because, uh, suck, and I can't do anything with them.
6037816	6044317	Um, FU to Subsplash, even though I'm going there tonight, um, for having all their games broken, because they don't give a damn.
6044437	6054679	And FU the fucking kid who was playing Speed Demon all night on Thursday, because they couldn't play Speed Demon because a fucker was taking it over to kick his ass.
6055680	6057000	FU that stupid kid with Speed Demon.
6057820	6070609	And, um, aside from that, you know, not too much, uh, stuff I'm mad at, other than, you know, stupid people, stupid drivers, uh, people who ask dumb questions, that kind of thing.
6072150	6073271	So, that's all.
6075452	6077354	Alright, thank you for that angsty little rant.
6082237	6087578	My FU of the week goes out to people that you go out on dates with that don't return your phone calls.
6088638	6089559	How fucked up is that?
6089619	6090079	I hate you.
6093480	6097621	My other FU of the week... I don't know if I want to get into it.
6098641	6101001	I have another pretty long FU to leave.
6101241	6103022	My other FU of the week goes to immaturity.
6106067	6116953	and people that try to send cryptic little messages that are really stupid and immature and try to make things into contests that aren't contests, that are much more than contests.
6120015	6122076	F you to stupid boys.
6124458	6126059	I will second your F you.
6126139	6127980	I will support you in your F you.
6128240	6129661	My F you goes to stupid boys.
6129801	6130161	Alright.
6131522	6135084	Let's take the chatroom's F you's, shall we?
6139093	6143016	Rogue says, Fuck Euromix 2 for having Steps songs.
6143997	6144977	Hey, you know what?
6145358	6146438	Steps did tragedy.
6146478	6147599	That song is fucking rad.
6148600	6149380	I don't care what you say.
6149901	6153664	Any song that has a groovy little dance to go with it, rules.
6153744	6155385	But those other Steps songs, yeah, they all suck.
6155425	6155745	I'm sorry.
6156686	6158027	USFVB says,
6159671	6166254	F you to traffic and to people with microwaves creating interference which disabled my telepathic waves from reaching Jamie to answer Propel.
6166974	6169915	And fuck you to all those people now trying to use Propel as an adjective.
6171836	6175397	And fuck you to Orange Lounge for what seems to be porn talk prohibition.
6176217	6178038	When do we ever stop talking about porn on here?
6178778	6180179	In fact, I think we've had an increase in it.
6180419	6184280	Actually, I've got more I can talk to you about that later.
6184660	6185361	No, you're banned.
6189703	6194245	OrangeBeanie says, F you to Naoki for getting to spend so much time for Politary.
6194906	6197487	OrangeBeanie, by the way, actually being a Politary fan.
6198868	6201549	And F you to The Point for making my 5th mix streams dead.
6201610	6202290	Dead, I tell you.
6202930	6203611	F you to The Point.
6204971	6205852	Go to Crestview, they have to...
6208357	6208937	Oh my lord.
6209377	6211678	23rd Magus says, I have a continued FU to Nori Nori Nori.
6211738	6216119	As usual, a big FU to being broke, which eliminates my chances of going to Scandi RVGL until January.
6216179	6218059	Cough, donate to the United Magus College Fund.
6218559	6220519	And a family-sized FU to Nero's Interface.
6220579	6224400	I accidentally moved a folder while making a CD and produced five coasters until I found out what happened.
6224480	6225420	Fuck you ahead.
6225780	6227441	Your program sucks, you bitches.
6227801	6229141	Go learn English, you fuckers.
6230141	6232902	I'm punishing you with those FUs for not agreeing with me in the match game.
6232942	6233562	Blah, suffer.
6239900	6245588	Brack2000 says F you to Captain Jack for not doing a cover of Oh Nick Please Not So Quick I agree, I agree
6247745	6249806	Dang, lots of FUs from Stresa.
6250186	6250686	FU'd who?
6250866	6251387	His ex.
6251527	6253307	She dumped me the day after my 20th birthday.
6253347	6255408	But we're still so hung up on each other and she's killing me.
6255809	6256589	But I'll survive.
6257109	6259730	And I'd also like to throw an FU at my parents.
6260090	6262552	They've been plotting against me to kick out since June.
6262652	6265433	And I'd like to shove a horse-sized FU in my mommy's booty.
6266593	6269174	Why does my mom deserve a horse-sized FU, especially in the booty?
6269334	6272176	For finding ways to throw my flaws back in my face for childish reasons.
6272256	6272496	Oh my.
6274153	6278717	Too bad Sally Jessie's not still around, because that would sound like something you need to go talk to Sally Jessie about.
6278737	6281840	Maybe you could go to Dr. Phil.
6285163	6292649	Twen says, F you, within 30 minutes I found out the girl I love got into a major car accident and is engaged and has a two-year-old and a six-month son.
6293999	6295340	Let's check the old mailbag.
6315987	6319009	because some people sent in their FUs because they knew we wouldn't be on on Sunday.
6320370	6323872	VidPower says, For the third week in a row, my main FU still goes to germs.
6323953	6326514	My cough has gotten worse this week and my throat is sore because of it.
6326915	6331077	Also, FU to reading boring school books and FU to the dark environments in Metroid Prime.
6331137	6333819	I literally can't see a wall that's a few inches away from my face.
6334220	6335120	But a very fun game on this.
6335240	6336701	You know what that cough is?
6336761	6337442	It's the Ebola.
6337582	6338122	You're going to die.
6338382	6338583	Bye.
6341385	6341785	F-Ebola.
6343914	6373383	Dave wrote us a lengthy email well it's the last day of Hanukkah and I'm sorry I'm not at the show tonight but I wasn't able to go to RVGL last night so I don't want to not play for two weeks I finished my edit for Loki's contest for I like to move it move it it kicks ass anyways the major reason I'm at RVGL is so that I can try to take on the top spot on the early 130 only which Tigger has a score of 98.3 on I can't let an outsider beat us on our home turf so I'm representing FU goes to my mom for not letting me go to RVGL on Friday night just because I threw up
6374003	6374723	Thank you for sharing.
6375224	6380747	To my mom again for getting me a FUBU sweatshirt for Hanukkah, not knowing what FUBU meant.
6382507	6383528	What does FUBU mean?
6383828	6384769	For us by us.
6385929	6386149	Huh.
6387050	6387330	Okay.
6388030	6396655	And a probably F you to my mom again for probably not wanting to take me to tourney next Friday, but it's not a definite F you yet because I don't know for sure.
6396755	6397735	Okay, see you guys next Sunday.
6399356	6399896	That was from Dave.
6400557	6400957	Beautiful.
6401157	6401657	Ass.
6403294	6403694	What song?
6404055	6405536	Speed Over Beethoven?
6405897	6408479	God, I always give the chatroom shitty songs to their FUs.
6409100	6410581	Oh, EOSFBB sent us one more.
6410601	6415306	Fuck you to VidPower for being conscious of the fact that he is sick, yet still serving food in his restaurant.
6416727	6417608	Ooh, yikes.
6418889	6419430	That's not good.
6420030	6420651	Okay, kill the song.
6422580	6424301	That was our lovely F-Use of the Week.
6424321	6425582	Thank you everybody for participating.
6425622	6426382	We do appreciate it.
6426582	6427403	That reminds me.
6427743	6428163	Yes.
6428503	6431245	Yes, we do have dates now for Make Edit Get Porn.
6431745	6432325	Oh, cool.
6432385	6433966	Yes, let's talk about Make Edit Get Porn.
6435167	6435527	Let's see.
6435747	6440549	The only problem is I don't remember what the dates are right now because I can't remember what I type on these boards.
6441330	6443351	I look at so many of them every week.
6444059	6452483	But yeah, MakeEditGetPorn, we've got the dates set for it, I believe, if I remember correctly.
6456265	6460147	I am going to announce the winners on the show, so that's going to be happening.
6463008	6464108	What did I set the dates at?
6464168	6464789	Okay.
6467367	6471510	If I missed your FU of the week, it's because I didn't get it over private message, and I missed things.
6471791	6471891	Oh.
6472371	6472831	Oh, here it is.
6472931	6473972	Okay, I see it.
6474052	6475994	It says, uh, Jabberwocky says, Fuck you, Rob.
6476314	6477675	Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
6477755	6478256	Um, fuck you?
6478416	6479036	Fuck you?
6479397	6479917	Um, no, really.
6479977	6480938	Fuck, fuckity, fuck, fuck you.
6481218	6481498	Wee!
6481598	6481979	Fuck you.
6482079	6483340	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck you, babe.
6483360	6483860	You're beautiful.
6483960	6484661	Fucking beautiful.
6484961	6486202	A big FU to you, Rob.
6489024	6489765	Dot, dot, dot.
6491566	6493187	Oh, I'm sorry, you were talking about pornography.
6494368	6500974	Okay, all the entries are due by Sunday, December 22nd at midnight.
6501675	6502595	And where must they submit them?
6502916	6507840	They must send them to my email or give them to me in person.
6508784	6517573	and they can be in any format as long as there's some way I can see the step file or step chart or have an edit file for it, you know, that's all I really need.
6517673	6532547	So, my email, I should probably give it over the air, I guess, nightmare underscore hunter and so it's nightmarehunter at yahoo.com Make sure you put the nice little underscore there between nightmare and hunter.
6533252	6538477	and other than that, you know, if you're local, you know, give it to me in person.
6538757	6542801	And all entries will be judged on January the 5th.
6543402	6544483	So, that's a Sunday.
6544923	6547445	And they're going to be announced right here on Orange Islands Radio, the winners, right?
6547465	6547665	Yes.
6547826	6548246	Cool.
6548807	6556694	And I have quite a bit of porn to go around, so there might actually be... Now, very briefly, for those new to the show, what is Make Edit Get Porned?
6556994	6557274	Pornography
6573195	6575257	Pornotapes Yay!
6575477	6602359	So we have make, edit, get porn Just like the title says And you'll get a big box of, you know, pornotapes Pretty much it consists of mostly Playboy movies I mean, I don't really consider them porn They're kind of Skinamax, they're prawn They're kind of porn, but they're not, I don't know It's hard to say But, you know, you'll get those And, I mean, those are pretty expensive, actually They're about $22.98 a piece So you are saving quite a bit of money To go out and buy those tapes and find out that they're crap
6604128	6607111	DarkTetsuya is wondering if you ever did get any boy-on-boy mix porn.
6608612	6610394	I have not myself, no.
6612896	6613477	Sorry about that.
6613677	6615439	Not that he's interested, he just wants to know.
6617701	6619262	Boy-on-boy porn, Jamie.
6619663	6620804	Oh, that made her wake up for a minute.
6621264	6623967	Yes, what happens if a woman who wins may get to get porn?
6627153	6631857	If a woman wins Make It or Get Porn, then we'll just have to find some boy porn to throw in the box.
6632378	6634720	So, pun intended.
6636481	6643146	Anyways, that's going on, and like I said, you've got no time to do it.
6644107	6649512	So get your Trinity Mix 3 stuff done this week, and then get your Make It or Get Porn stuff done next week.
6650908	6652249	Alright, that was Make It or Get Porn.

6746354	6749336	This is a Beethoven song, so let's hear this clip of Ode to Joy.
6749836	6750817	Everybody knows this song.
6750837	6753519	Everybody who ever took piano had to play this song at one point or another.
6754020	6754240	Another?
6754280	6754840	Let's hear this one.
6754860	6756522	This is the very last track on the album, by the way.
6756542	6759464	Ode to Joy
6769711	6770192	Very nice.
6770212	6775996	Somebody in the chatroom says, oh, that's kind of like End of the Century.
6776016	6776176	Woo!
6791201	6791481	Yes.
6792982	6796043	First of all, End of the Century is kind of like Ode to Joy, get it right.
6796123	6797663	It's a little bit similar, yes.
6798323	6801144	There's a brand new Captain Jack album coming out.
6801464	6802745	Rock the fuck on.
6802805	6804145	It's called Party Warriors.
6805126	6806866	Fucking rock, that's all I had to say.
6807226	6810848	We only have a clip of one song, but it's got a great name, so I'm sure it's awesome.
6811268	6813148	This is a song called Centerfold.
6813469	6816129	And actually, it looks like this album is just a bunch of remixes.
6816390	6820551	So we got Hey Ya, Iko Iko, Party Warriors, and this one, Centerfold.

6871838	6872918	Let's hear how awful it is.
6897398	6904183	I could be on a Speed album, Jesus.
6904203	6908086	Oh, the OSFVB wants a cover of Dirty on Speed 10.
6908146	6909507	No, unfortunately that's not going to happen.

6911228	6912789	We have a Little Less Conversation.
6912809	6915771	That was the Elvis song that made a big comeback.
6915811	6916552	We have a clip of that.
6916872	6918193	That's the second track on the album.
6918493	6919334	Done by CJ Crew.
6919374	6920855	Done by the CJ Crew, who did some...
6924121	6932626	All this aggravation and satisfaction A little fight, a little less fun A little less fun and a little more snot Put your mouth in the oven of your heart That is fun, that is fun, baby, baby

6985163	6985743	Love the name!
6985763	6987924	That song is as lovely as DJ Mangu.
6995107	6995767	I know this song.
6995787	7000989	This is probably going to be a big PDR.
7001049	7003150	This is like totally BDM.
7003170	7005230	Yeah, this is total PDR song right here.
7009912	7022931	Look at that, Love Unlimited, Candy Plants Yes, and another remix of Candy, just what the fucking world needed Get up and move, speed mix Love Sex on the Beach, I love Erotic
7023678	7029162	So those are some new things that we can look forward to from the Toshiba EMI series.
7029182	7030343	It's coming out very soon.
7031023	7035787	And since we never really talked about it, let's talk about some other things that we've had come out recently.
7035847	7038489	Dance Mania EX1 just came out not too long ago.
7038569	7039469	Had some good stuff on it.
7041891	7045454	The Return of Smile DK, Captain Jack, and Erotic all on a Dance Mania album.
7045494	7046054	That was pretty cool.
7046435	7047255	And Lollipop.
7047515	7050558	Actually, I do have Lollipop on my CD that I brought today.
7050578	7051818	I want to listen to that.
7052739	7056362	I'll be perfectly happy if I don't have to hear that song, thank you.
7056382	7057202	That sounds scary.
7069168	7071090	Weird, I didn't realize people left the house here.
7071710	7074172	I just had somebody come online who I thought was here at the house.
7074412	7080696	Anyway, let's... I guess we're going to go to a break, and when we come back, we're going to do a list list.
7081317	7082798	I don't know if we have enough people to do a list list.
7082818	7083699	Do we still have one person here?
7083719	7084779	Do we still have anybody here?
7084999	7088082	I think she's still playing... Animal Crossing?
7088542	7090003	We'll see if we have enough people to do a list list.
7091864	7092645	We'll try to do that.
7092965	7093866	If not, we'll think of something.
7094026	7095887	We'll just do a three-person list list if we have to.
7097348	7098850	We'll do a three-person list list if we have to.
7098950	7099190	Fine.
7099951	7104435	In the meantime, we're going to take a break, and I had a request for something, and I don't even remember what it was.
7104796	7106538	I could talk about new tech porn.
7106598	7107518	Who wants to play Holic?
7108439	7110742	Okay, talk about what you wanted to talk about.
7111122	7116367	Hold on, I'm going to go see if we have anybody else in the front room to do... I get the chair.
7116808	7117488	No, you don't.
7117548	7118089	I get the chair.
7119741	7120381	Thank you for watching.
7121142	7121762	See you next time.
7147389	7148349	He's telling us about his porn.
7148369	7148770	That's right.
7175225	7177646	Okay, reviewing anime porn here, Rob.
7178527	7184130	DNA Hunter, it's basically about, there's this woman, her husband dies, and she really wants to have a baby.
7184450	7186631	And the problem is, she wants to have her husband's baby.
7186711	7190053	So, in order to do that, she has to kind of clone his DNA or something like that.
7190173	7193975	Anyways, so in order to get the money to do this, she has to become a DNA Hunter.
7194055	7198938	Now, what DNA Hunter is, is basically, it's a woman, women come to this company,
7199318	7201520	and they say, I want this man's baby.
7201880	7207304	So in order to do that, they have to have these women that work for this company go and have sex with these people.
7207885	7216531	And then they collect the DNA, or semen, from these people and then turn cell to the women that want to have those, you know, celebrities' babies.
7217552	7218693	Thus, DNA Hunter.
7219474	7221876	I have to say that this was an utter disappointment.
7222216	7223317	Title sucked ass.
7223837	7224277	Leatherman Vol. 3
7247896	7251578	Pretty interesting title since I had to start watching it in the middle.
7253139	7255781	It's basically this guy carrying around a sack of money.
7256541	7260203	I don't know why he's carrying around a sack of money because obviously I haven't seen the first episode so I don't really know.
7261064	7262885	And he's going around and
7263545	7266346	People just start having sex with them for no apparent reason whatsoever.
7266386	7271907	They're trying to steal the money, and it's kind of like Golden Boy, but X-rated.
7272367	7277368	You've got the guy, he's making women feel better about themselves, giving them more confidence and stuff.
7277408	7280129	Yeah, he has sex with them and stuff like that.
7280369	7282249	I don't know, it's pretty good.
7282549	7284750	No real plot to get in the way, lots of sex.
7284890	7286310	Fun, fun, fun.
7287683	7292506	The other one, I believe it was called Katie, I can't remember what the actual name was.
7293406	7313316	It's about this kind of cheerleader, not really a cheerleader, but she's like the head of the kind of the pep team or whatever, and she is being blackmailed by the rest of her team to do all these things like, you know, do cheers with like a vibrator strapped in her and stuff, and
7314216	7325827	kind of stuff like that she ends up at the very end turning into a slut so you get to watch this cute girl get transformed into a slut at the end of the movie so of course everyone likes that that's it, that's all I've got
7327250	7327650	Beautiful.
7327891	7331373	We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back to talk about something Bomani related.
7331834	7332234	Eh, maybe.
7332855	7334256	Actually, we're going to do a list list when we come back.
7334676	7338039	By request, this break, this is the only song we're going to play this break because it's kind of long.
7338099	7339660	It's six minutes long, but it's very cool.
7340000	7342823	It's Outphase doing .59 live.
7343443	7346746	So it starts off a little bit quiet, though, so don't think that we dropped or anything.
7346766	7347666	It just has a quiet intro.
7347706	7349748	It's got one of those windy noises things.
7349828	7351970	So enjoy this song and we'll be back.
7356826	7357967	Thanks for watching!
7368192	7369352	Thanks for watching!
7393872	7394512	Thank you for watching!
7501036	7502018	Thanks for watching!
7639699	7640503	Thank you for watching!

7736034	7737896	No!

7778044	7784405	Tonight's topic is the top three things I hate about Christmas.
7785965	7789006	Yes, it's the top things that we hate about Christmas.
7793139	7798040	The way the list works, the list list segment works is that we're going to compile a list.
7798120	7805322	Our fabulous in-studio celebrities will compile a list of their top things that they hate about Christmas.
7805802	7812283	And then one by one we will each eliminate something that we hate about Christmas or that we might actually like about Christmas that someone else hates.
7812343	7813523	Things that should not be on the list.
7814064	7819605	And then the chat room will vote on the ultimate list of things that they hate about Christmas.
7821586	7822047	Let's start off.
7822087	7822948	Who started last time?
7822968	7824050	Jamie, did you start last week?
7824470	7824931	I don't remember.
7824991	7826553	Let's start with Loki.
7827154	7830459	Loki, what is the number three thing that you hate about Christmas?
7831300	7832923	Goddy Christmas decorations.
7835595	7840439	Basically, you know, the white trash light setups, you know, in front of people's houses.
7841100	7846104	Gaudy Christmas Decorations is number three on... Doesn't it look like Christmas threw up all over the houses?
7847645	7848165	Exactly.
7848486	7853430	We were just driving down the street the other day, and Jamie said, Christmas barfed on that house.
7853530	7855251	Christmas barfed on that house.
7856412	7859214	So, Gaudy Christmas Decorations is Loki's number three answer.
7859254	7860495	We have the Rice Princess in the studio.
7860535	7861856	She's helping us out tonight with listless...
7863017	7866960	Irene, what is your number three pick for thing you hate about Christmas?
7867660	7871842	Well, you have to say dumb, nosy relatives.
7872803	7877706	You know, when you have to see those relatives you never see but Christmas time, and they always want to know what you're doing.
7877746	7879707	It's like, well, if I wanted you to know, I would have told you.
7879727	7882289	I would have sent you a letter or called you or something.
7882489	7885070	Dumb, nosy relatives, Irene's number three answer.
7885370	7886151	Very nice, very nice.
7886171	7886411	Thank you.
7886931	7889253	My number three answer would be parking lots.
7891750	7896351	I hate parking lots normally, and around Christmas time, it gets ten times as worse.
7896471	7907094	People cannot drive in a parking lot, they are cutthroat going for each other's spaces, they stay and they park their car in the middle of the aisle, so when you're trying to go around to get a spot, you're trapped there.
7907414	7909855	That shit pisses me off more than anything else in the whole world.
7912696	7915657	Jamie, your number three pick for something you hate about Christmas.
7915957	7917417	Decorations going up before Halloween.
7918137	7920398	Oh, decorations that go up before Halloween.
7920478	7920898	Very nice.
7925373	7928497	What about decorations that stay up after Valentine's Day?
7928517	7932301	I don't know what to feel about that.
7932321	7934083	I just don't like them going up before my favorite holiday.
7935084	7935365	All right.
7935445	7936646	What if there are orange lights, though?
7938088	7939530	If it's for Halloween, then sure.
7940322	7940542	Cool.
7941643	7942003	Alright.
7943444	7947105	Loki, your number two answer for thing that pisses you off about Christmas.
7947486	7948666	Christmas music.
7949887	7950367	All of it.
7950607	7951628	All of it must go.
7952468	7954289	Don't change your music programming.
7955069	7956310	Kill the artists that made it.
7956590	7957511	Hunt them down.
7957831	7959192	I will pay ransom.
7960572	7961353	Actually, bounty.
7961373	7964014	A bounty for everybody that makes Christmas music.
7964654	7965475	I want them all dead.
7966955	7967195	Okay.
7968296	7969256	Alright, Christmas music.
7970356	7971317	Irene, your number two answer.
7971957	7975458	Having no money or resources to buy or make gifts.
7977799	7977979	Yep.
7979359	7979579	Sucks.
7981700	7982940	Anything else you want to elaborate on there?
7984241	7985321	Well, no.
7986201	7986561	Alright.
7988442	7991423	My number two answer is political correctness.
7995464	8002310	Because somewhere right now there's probably somebody that would be whining about how we shouldn't say Christmas because it's the winter holiday season.
8002690	8004191	And everybody celebrates something different.
8004231	8004752	But you know what?
8005072	8007474	There's some people out there that don't even celebrate holidays.
8007954	8008975	So, you know what?
8009516	8013779	Just Christmas, for all practical purposes, means everything, okay?
8013980	8016982	I'm not like a Bible-thumper religious person, but I just say Christmas.
8017382	8018503	It's presents, you get stuff.
8018603	8022627	I don't care what other people celebrate, but don't freaking get all huffy and puffy when...
8023442	8031347	somebody else, you know, celebrate something you don't you don't have to try so damn hard to be different just go with it I hate political correctness
8034067	8048591	The thing that kind of triggered this was that we have this thing at work that we do every winter and we're not even allowed to call it, we can't call it a Christmas party, we can't call it a Hanukkah party, we can't call it a Kwanzaa party, we can't even call it a holiday party because not everyone celebrates holidays.
8049031	8052091	We have to call it a winter appreciation party.
8053672	8055152	That is so stupid.
8056072	8058133	Jamie, your number two thing that you hate about Christmas.
8062436	8065859	I have one that's more personal, so I'm not going to say that one.
8066140	8066420	Okay.
8067681	8068442	I'll mention it.
8068502	8073867	I don't like being away from my family for the fourth Christmas in a row, since they're all out in Alabama.
8073987	8075428	So I'll put it this way.
8076129	8083736	I think that what I don't like about the whole holiday season is just how over-commercialized it is.
8084557	8085798	Over-commercialized, all right.
8088991	8100601	It's always buy, buy, buy, buy and people don't seem to realize that there's supposed to be more meaning to the season than just... I mean, I like shopping for gifts and I like giving them because that's just how I am.
8101342	8108068	But when it's being used as an excuse for more people to put money in their pockets, I don't like that.
8110711	8113172	Alright, that's a very good rant, I like that.
8113492	8126196	Alright, Loki, number one thing that pisses you off about Christmas, those people dressed up like Santa Claus outside of grocery stores, outside of malls, everything, working for the Salvation Army.
8127036	8128617	F you to the Salvation Army.
8129277	8133979	They don't need my money any time of the year, nor during Christmas, and they aren't getting a penny of it.
8136639	8137820	Thank you, Mr. Grinch.
8139451	8140372	Gosh, Scrooge.
8140392	8143557	I hope you see the three ghosts.
8143938	8147342	Irene, the number one thing you hate about Christmas?
8148224	8150988	Not knowing what to get people for Christmas.
8151168	8151569	I hate it.
8152463	8153484	Just tell me what you want.
8153764	8154865	What you really, really want.
8155685	8156366	And I'll get it for you.
8156826	8157847	Not knowing what to get people.
8157987	8158307	Alright.
8158887	8159328	Good answer.
8159808	8162630	My number one answer is already on the list.
8163090	8164311	But I'll just say it anyway.
8164351	8165332	We'll just have a duplicate.
8165712	8168133	My number one thing I hate about Christmas is Christmas carols.
8168614	8171035	So that goes right along with Christmas music.
8171095	8173397	You can pick something other than Christmas carols.
8173437	8174157	How about Christmas carolers?
8174257	8174478	Okay.
8181710	8183792	Like the beginning of the Addams Family movie.
8184112	8184972	That's the best thing ever.
8186373	8189476	I hate... Okay, I was going to say you could have used this one.
8189796	8191977	Christmas TV specials.
8192998	8194419	No, because the Grinch is cool.
8195040	8195440	No, no, no.
8195500	8197141	I'm not talking about the Grinch.
8197181	8197902	Grinch is cool.
8198342	8199043	Keep the Grinch.
8199063	8201444	If I'm talking about like they have this one here, it's a musical special.
8201584	8203045	John Ritter hosting.
8203726	8205547	John Ritter should not be on TV.
8207168	8208449	Not since Three's Company anyway.
8209570	8210531	Yeah, Three's Company was cool.
8214633	8216254	Jamie, the number one answer.
8216955	8218696	Misinterpretation of the holiday.
8218876	8222299	I have to give background.
8222359	8224040	I was born Southern Baptist.
8224100	8230445	I still believe in God in general, but I lean more toward the pagan side of my beliefs.
8231085	8234608	And I love it when people go, oh, Jesus was born on Christmas Day.
8234908	8235849	That's bullshit!
8235869	8238011	He was born in like June, okay?
8238031	8238111	Yeah.
8238982	8241642	Christmas is a pagan holiday, okay?
8242203	8248144	The Yule Tree, the log, you know, the candles, all of it is a pagan holiday.
8248684	8249424	Get it right.
8250384	8256305	If you want dates and proof and everything, I can go grab all of my college books and pull that right up where that tradition started.
8256365	8260266	I actually think that somebody posted a link in the chat room if you want more information on that.
8260286	8262086	Thank you.
8262106	8262306	I think.
8262326	8263586	I am so sick of this.
8264246	8267327	And that's part of the reason why I stopped going to the specials at church.
8268067	8268947	was because of this.
8269707	8271128	Oh, Christmas Day, blah, blah, blah.
8271208	8271548	No!
8271888	8272308	You're wrong.
8272348	8272868	You're stupid.
8273368	8277389	You're buying into what you've been fed all of your life.
8277589	8279490	Try thinking for yourself.
8280230	8280990	I don't like that.
8281210	8283090	No, that's my number one pet peeve about Christmas.
8283410	8283770	Alright.
8284911	8288031	I just stopped going to church because it was damn boring and I didn't really care.
8288772	8295013	Except there was this one priest that looked like Weirdo Yankovich and that entertained myself enough to stay away for about half of it.
8295908	8296188	All right.
8296928	8299229	Boy, not a single Bomani-related thing on this list.
8299249	8300230	I'm really proud of you guys.
8300330	8301570	Okay.
8302671	8303051	You know what?
8304471	8304731	I don't know.
8304771	8307473	I'm going to entertain something here in the studio here.
8307653	8312154	I don't think I feel comfortable eliminating any of these because they're all things that really suck about Christmas.
8312474	8315656	So I think as a Christmas present, we should let our chat room pick from all of these options.
8315676	8316196	What do you guys think?
8316216	8316296	Sure.
8317657	8317957	All right.
8318337	8319558	So we're not going to eliminate anything.
8319598	8321259	You guys can pick anything from this list.
8321320	8325202	Because I don't know about the others, but I don't... We're extra bitter today.
8325563	8329946	I don't see anything on this list that I really feel comfortable getting rid of.
8330166	8331847	I can't even add to the list.
8331907	8334870	I hate the stupid people that come around working... No, no adding.
8335830	8338032	The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts wanting me to buy shit.
8339093	8340414	Are they made from real Girl Scouts?
8340434	8340474	No.
8342941	8343301	I love it.
8343381	8344382	I want a cookie.
8345203	8347125	The Addams Family is like the best Christmas movie.
8347785	8348426	I want a cookie.
8350488	8352689	Some things that the chatroom... Make a real Girl Scouts.
8352709	8354671	Chatroom suggestions that we missed.
8354771	8355692	Blood chip flavor.
8355872	8357373	Things in the chatroom that we missed.
8357834	8358354	Eggnog.
8358895	8359395	I like eggnog.
8359415	8360496	I know, I like eggnog too.
8361117	8362918	I like alcoholic eggnog.
8363639	8364880	Getting socks and underwear.
8365987	8367908	Hey, I could use that, okay?
8369108	8371049	My socks and underwear just disappeared.
8371189	8373049	They just like, whoa!
8373109	8374370	Damn underpants gnomes.
8376130	8377190	Underpants gnomes.
8377771	8380451	And let's see, what else did they say?
8381872	8383072	They were saying Silent Hill owns you.
8383092	8383592	I guess that's it.
8384573	8385313	Those are the only two things.
8385773	8388514	Okay, so sending your votes now over private message in the channel.
8389134	8391875	And to celebrate, how about a little Christmas cheer for all of you?

8823035	8824275	We indeed do have a list.
8824956	8825216	We.
8825876	8826056	We.
8826737	8826997	We!
8828438	8828978	I have Propel.
8830333	8830673	Awesome.
8830833	8831133	Barry?
8832133	8832474	Of course.
8832514	8833174	Is it Barry good?
8833854	8835014	Very, very, very, very good.
8835234	8835554	All right.
8836295	8840095	Here is the final list of the top three things you all hate about Christmas.
8840175	8840676	We helped.
8840836	8841316	You voted.
8841496	8841956	Here it is.
8842496	8847817	The number three thing that you hate about Christmas is Christmas carolers.
8848718	8849478	God, they suck.
8849498	8850978	Ba-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.
8850998	8851398	Bang!
8853999	8857900	The number two thing you hate about Christmas is that it's over-commercialized.
8859457	8860938	with Hallmark stamped on the back.
8862559	8870385	And the number one thing that everybody in the chat room and we all hate about Christmas is political correctness.
8871286	8871586	Yeah.
8872364	8874706	And that's correct, spelled with one R. Shut up.
8875506	8876006	Shut up.
8877127	8877888	Just shut up.
8877908	8878548	Correct.
8879809	8883191	They're saying I should use the movie phone voice.

8904974	8905835	Some people might do that.
8906376	8906756	Wee!
8907737	8908378	Talk to me!
8910160	8912003	Let's just ask Mr. Spanky about that.
8913766	8915887	Oh yes, we haven't heard from Mr. Spanky yet tonight.
8916427	8919188	I do believe we're going to do a Mr. Spanky update a little later.
8920689	8921569	Oh, now you're not so sure?
8921709	8922710	We need good porn tips.
8922930	8923830	We need good porn tips?
8924611	8928092	Okay, well we'll get Mr. Spanky back on the show right before it's over.
8928312	8928732	How's that sound?
8928872	8929373	Alright, cool.
8930213	8933954	Jamie, you've got to explain, I noticed one FU you left out.
8934035	8936035	I don't remember if you talked about it last week.
8936396	8939697	But you've got these Leet Max 2 shoes, and they're breaking.
8940337	8941438	I bought these vans.
8941458	8943699	They're black and they have flames going up the sides.
8944659	8946500	And they're already starting to tear up.
8946600	8948861	My last pair of vans lasted me like a whole freaking year.
8949521	8951382	And these are just falling to bits.
8951642	8954304	So I gotta get new man shoes.
8956124	8957885	But I'm gonna wear these until they die, dammit.
8958425	8965389	Okay, I'm being asked to read a paper that 23rd Magus wrote that he got an A on.
8965429	8967570	It better be Bimani related or I'm not gonna do it.
8967850	8968170	Yeah.
8975172	8976533	Oh yeah, there's an article in the paper.
8976574	8977474	Tell us about that, Matt.
8978415	8979736	Fuck if I know, I haven't read it.
8979897	8988805	Anyways, my friend Eric, also known as Punkknight, he wrote an article in... I don't remember what the magazine is.
8989245	8990726	Oh, it's a local paper here.
8993376	8996697	Help me!
8996817	8997877	WiredHead, I bet.
8998478	8999858	Yeah, something like that.
8999958	9002459	Anyways, WiredHead Magazine.
9002919	9003739	It's about DDR.
9004219	9006180	I think Rob gets quoted on it.
9006680	9007160	Yeah, apparently.
9007180	9007840	I haven't even seen it yet.
9007860	9008741	I need to find a copy of it.
9009741	9015843	I know that there's a few down where my friend works, if you're local, down in Folsom at...
9017993	9021555	at, um, shit, Pizza Place, um, Ciro's.
9021755	9028198	Ciro's Pizza Place at, um, Blue Ravine and Prairie City Road.
9028899	9031860	So, if you're local in Folsom, you can check it out there.
9032441	9034382	Otherwise, wherever Wirehead's at.
9034502	9036683	So, find it, like it, enjoy it.
9036923	9037123	There.
9039044	9046128	I'm sorry, while Matt was talking about Wirehead, Jamie is noticing that if you shake a bottle or propel, like, a lot, and then let it sit there, it looks like cum.
9046148	9046188	Ha!
9051334	9051954	Tasty!
9054075	9057957	This looks like it could do a lot of damage to some sort of bodily orifice, this Propel bottle.
9058217	9061398	And Jamie, what was your comment as soon as you took a sip of that shaken water?
9061818	9062458	It ain't salty.
9062658	9063759	That's right, it ain't salty.
9065308	9066769	All right.
9068730	9070191	Your HP tastes good.
9070771	9071632	Okay, here we go.
9072412	9073593	We're going to talk now.
9073873	9078496	We're going to read this paper, and it is Bimani-related because it's about Shaft and that tournament.
9078876	9084399	So 23rd Magus wrote this paper for one of his classes, so I thought we'd read it, and I'll give our little smart-ass comments on it.
9084419	9084979	How's that sound?
9085820	9086280	Here we go.
9088842	9089662	Yes, that's right.
9090022	9091063	Reading the paper, reading the paper.
9092028	9092948	Stand by to win.
9093869	9097210	I went to Shaft and all I got was this lousy roast beef.
9098571	9105973	One of my favorite and strangest hobbies is playing Dance Dance Revolution, an arcade game in which you must step on arrow panels in time to the music.
9106674	9112336	Many people, such as myself, go further than the game requires, working the arrows into a dance routine.
9112436	9114577	In other words, we freestyle.
9115637	9118058	Recently... Not if you're white.
9119739	9119999	What?
9122594	9123114	Keep reading.
9123214	9124215	What are you laughing at?
9125135	9130797	Recently, Scandia Fun Center hosted a DDR tournament for those playing accuracy at what?
9131638	9132038	Read.
9133018	9134539	No, I want to know what the joke is.
9134579	9134959	Read.
9136760	9137400	Here, you tell them.
9138135	9138655	All right.
9139355	9139655	Okay.
9140496	9140856	Okay.
9141336	9141796	Can I finish?
9142296	9142716	Can I finish?
9142836	9143216	Can I finish?
9143936	9144457	Can I finish?
9144477	9144677	Thank you.
9145637	9145857	Yes.
9146197	9146597	Okay.
9146637	9148318	Moving on with 23 Magazine's paper.
9148618	9153699	Recently, Scandia Fun Center hosted a DDR tournament for those playing accuracy and freestyles.
9153719	9154719	It's freestylers.
9155959	9158100	The organizers decided to call it Shaft.
9158660	9161241	Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.
9161321	9161961	Sacramento.
9162992	9165133	Oh yeah, oh yeah, Sackbomani hosts another titles tournament.
9165173	9166754	Oh, you get docked three points for that.
9168214	9171156	He said Sacramento, not Sackbomani, so he gets docked three points.
9172396	9174577	It was quite witty, if I do say so myself.
9175918	9176298	Thank you.
9176398	9181080	I suppose I should go into detail about the three types of competition and exactly why they are important.
9181500	9186322	I've never seen anyone talk in an English paper, well, I suppose I ought to talk about this.
9188103	9189683	I suppose I ought to do my assignment.
9192024	9197126	Alright, that way I don't leave non-DDR players, you unfortunate souls, you, in the dust.
9198546	9200927	Accuracy attack is your standard play of DDR.
9201387	9204668	The object of the game is to hit every arrow step with the right timing.
9205208	9210030	I was not present during this competition, so you, dear reader, will be spared the agonizing details.
9210110	9211330	Consider yourself lucky.
9213451	9214191	You did really good on that.
9214531	9215532	Yeah, I was kick-ass.
9215992	9216572	Not your problem.
9218544	9220205	Oh, 23... Well, I'll say it after.
9220725	9225168	Regular freestyle players take the steps for a song and work them into a dance routine.
9225528	9228930	The routine always varies depending on the song and freestyler.
9229351	9235815	Some amazing feats have taken place in this competition, and their excitement levels rivals that of any extreme sport.
9236195	9237216	Nice use of the word extreme.
9240750	9251398	18 Freestyle, also known as Old School Freestyle, is a demonstration of freestyling techniques from several years back.
9251859	9261466	These routines utilize the safety bars at the back of the arcade machine and incorporate moves such as hand plants, hitting an arrow with hands instead of feet, and knee drops, landing on an arrow with knees.
9261806	9263928	These often cause great pain to the performer.
9264869	9265509	Performer.
9266931	9270679	Nowadays, A-Team routines are generally considered childish and not cool anymore.
9271160	9276351	Personally, I think that A-Team routines have the biggest wow factor, but many don't share my opinion.
9277873	9280856	Now that we're done with the background, let's get into the real meat of this.
9281317	9284199	I am, of course, talking about how I fit into this whole picture.
9284720	9289164	Through a little negotiating, green whining, I managed to get into Shaft as an observer.
9289505	9291687	So I thought, or so I thought.
9292267	9298334	Instead, I participated in the most embarrassing and the most fun activity of my life, competing in freestyles.
9301946	9303167	Uh, here's the rundown.
9303767	9310613	Midway through the freestyle competition, Rob and Janie, the MC and tournament organizer, noticed that not enough people had signed up for competition.
9311173	9317839	They then decided to make an improvisational freestyle category, which was one-third of the normal $15 entry fee.
9318259	9320781	Having only $10 on me, I decided to go for it.
9321261	9322042	Here was the catch.
9322543	9326526	Since it was improv, the machine was set to roulette mode, which selects a song at random.
9327319	9330983	If I had been able to pick my own song, things would have been monumentally different.
9331203	9332444	Monumentally different.
9333645	9335467	Momentally, monumentally different.
9336068	9336848	Damn you, big words.
9337469	9341012	Namely, I probably would have had a routine set up, which defeats the purpose of improv.
9341813	9345857	As it was, I embarrassed myself royally, doing rave moves to a bubblegum pop song.
9346238	9350141	It was entertaining in its incognuity, but it was not a winner.
9352708	9353248	Not a winner.
9353268	9354930	Stand by to lose.
9355890	9357091	Stand by to lose.
9357291	9357572	Boom.
9358692	9363135	Anyway, the wild part of my experience was not in my improv entry, but in what happened while waiting.
9363516	9364636	It was chaos incarnate.
9365017	9369340	My good friend Justin was going crazy with the deep fryer, dropping in everything he thought he could get away with.
9369940	9373022	I still remember stuffing my face with deep fried Twinkies and candy corn.
9373082	9374684	It was fun, albeit messy.
9376024	9381686	Much of the time I was in the party room slash broadcast booth, talking with my friends and helping out with the Orange Lounge radio broadcast.
9381726	9382327	Yay!
9383127	9387289	The broadcast was full of inside jokes, all of which were too rude and obscure to mention.
9387729	9392951	I do remember Justin taking over the airwaves, telling me to stop hitting him, although I was doing no such thing.
9392971	9394231	It was still moderately funny.
9395952	9396312	Okay.
9396332	9398013	Sounds like a live journal post.
9398073	9399934	I know, this totally sounds like a live journal post.
9401034	9401834	It's quite amusing.
9402355	9402955	Please continue.
9404508	9405289	We have a loser!
9405429	9405849	No, I'm just kidding.
9406209	9410272	A few times I came out of the party room to watch the freestylers work their magic on the stage.
9410632	9413253	It is from one of the routines that my story gets its name.
9413674	9419457	Mr. Wendell, a popular freestyler, was doing a comedy routine to Orion 7-8, one of the more annoying songs.
9420097	9424060	One of his friends was holding up a hot roast beef sandwich, playing keep away with poor Wendell.
9424440	9428082	At certain points in the song, the crowd, spoofing the song lyrics, chanted, Roast beef!
9428582	9429103	Roast beef!
9429323	9429623	Hot!
9429823	9430103	Hot!
9430284	9430504	Hot!
9431244	9431464	Hot.
9432405	9442412	The whole routine had me literally on the floor laughing, especially at the end, where Wendell finally snatched the sandwich, took a bite, then backhanded his buddy, who was sneaking up behind him.
9442432	9443473	That was Holland, wasn't it?
9444273	9444694	Yes, it was.
9445658	9446118	Applause.
9446498	9450919	Rob, always the charmer, stood on stage and declared, I love stories with happy endings, don't you?
9451439	9460782	More applause accompanied by laughter and wolf whistles, a few of which I must admit were mine.
9462042	9463662	Aw, that was a beautiful paper.
9463742	9464803	Thank you for sharing that with us.
9464823	9465603	That was the end, right?
9466203	9468984	Oops, I did it again.
9469044	9469764	I closed the window.
9470764	9472405	Oh, well, I'm assuming that was the end of the paper.
9472665	9473045	Oh, here it is.
9474605	9475646	Yes, that was the end of the paper.
9477188	9478129	Very well written.
9478169	9479370	How do you guys think he did on that?
9479390	9480091	What kind of grade?
9480191	9481973	It was out of 36 points, I'll tell you that.
9482033	9482954	What do you think he got?
9483295	9483916	I give it 34.
9484676	9483916	34.
9484837	9486599	Out of 36 points.
9487079	9487680	What would you give it, Loki?
9487700	9488721	It was grammatically correct.
9489021	9491144	Yes.
9491704	9492345	What grade is he in?
9493847	9494247	I don't know.
9494527	9495048	In high school.
9498584	9500025	I think he's freshman or sophomore.
9500526	9502227	That's a guess.
9502848	9503749	I guess it was alright.
9503769	9507452	It started going off topic towards the end.
9507552	9515179	You were explaining the different categories in DDR and then all of a sudden it's all something else.
9515799	9516139	I don't know.
9519616	9521898	It sounds a lot like my senior project.
9523138	9523358	No.
9524479	9530022	See, what happens, I think what happens is you procrastinate and you wait until the last minute to write your paper and it ends up coming out like this.
9531343	9532123	So what do you think, Rob?
9532904	9533944	You guys got to give me grades.
9533984	9534164	Grades?
9534204	9534605	Hold on, Matt.
9534625	9536105	What did you get out of 36 points?
9542645	9544325	34.0596 All right, very nice.
9544725	9548146	For grammatical correctness, yes, I guess I'll give it... Oh, my bad.
9548646	9549326	He's a senior.
9549426	9549826	My bad.
9550026	9550966	He's a senior in high school.
9551606	9552006	My bad.
9552106	9552746	He's getting pissed.
9553107	9556847	In that case, F. In that case, F. You should know better.
9556947	9561108	There's not much difference between freshmen and seniors when it comes to, like, curriculum when I was in high school.
9562468	9563108	Your grade, Brad?
9564028	9564269	I'd say 31.
9564309	9564269	31?
9564329	9565509	Oh, you give him a B.
9568869	9569289	I give him 59.
9569829	9571329	I give him 59 points for that.
9571350	9572310	That was beautiful.
9572370	9574191	There is no 59, you fuckhead.
9575011	9575971	No, but this is what's funny.
9576271	9577492	You know how many points he did get?
9578372	9577492	33.
9578452	9579773	He got 33 points.
9580333	9583834	Minus 3 points for missing the Sakpamani thing, just like we said.
9585635	9586195	You know what?
9587796	9590137	I only learned two things in high school.
9590357	9590757	What's that?
9591037	9593878	How to avoid people, and then a mole of 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.
9597461	9600265	I'm doing the way over my head thing right now where I put my hand in.
9600686	9601647	I took AP Chemistry.
9605232	9609318	Orange Beanie gave that paper a double S. That was winner.
9609738	9610279	That's winner.
9610519	9612021	I'm five rating.
9614522	9615283	Rob's vibrating.
9615323	9618285	It's vibrating, but it's a restricted vibrate, so I don't answer restricted numbers.
9618866	9619266	Okay.
9620667	9621488	Um, wow.
9622048	9624570	We've still got about a good 15 minutes to fill in the show.
9624590	9625411	You can fill it up with a ferret.
9625731	9626652	No, no ferret filling.
9628333	9629194	What else can we talk about?
9629795	9630775	Brad, do you want to rant about something?
9630996	9631776	Hey, fucking guy.
9633778	9634559	This is for Paul.
9636320	9638862	Your daughter, she come to my house, and she kick my dog.
9638882	9641184	I want to tell a joke.
9641264	9641845	I want to tell a joke.
9642245	9642645	Okay.
9642665	9643406	I need joke music.
9646261	9647602	You guys all bidded over.
9648083	9650145	You guys all bidded over on the thing.
9650185	9651526	Hey, I'm talking to you.
9651586	9654009	Play me something from Keyboard Mania.
9654249	9654850	Something happy.
9655470	9656251	No keyboard for you.
9658834	9660616	A monkey for coffee in my boots.
9663894	9665296	Okay, that kind of fits.
9665416	9670563	Anyway, a guy was walking in the woods, and he was lost and lost and lost for days.
9671323	9682417	So he chances upon this house, and he notices that there are telephone wires coming out of the house, so he knocks on the door, and this ancient old man answers the phone, answers the phone, answers the door.
9683720	9685643	Please sir, please, can I use your telephone?
9685683	9686565	I'm lost in the woods.
9686966	9691895	Guy goes, sure, you can use my telephone and you can stay at my house too until someone can come get you.
9692336	9694560	But my one rule is that you cannot sleep with my daughter.
9695485	9706627	Okay, so he goes in the house, uses the telephone, has dinner with the family, and, well, the guy's daughter was really hot, and he couldn't help it, she just went mad, and placed it at the end of the table.
9707087	9713149	So, late at night, the guy sneaks out of his room, and goes and, you know, has his way with her, and goes to bed.
9713809	9718930	He wakes up in the morning with a gigantic rock on his chest, and there's a note attached to it.
9719770	9722951	First greatest of all tortures, a gigantic rock stuck on your chest.
9723311	9724271	And he goes, well, shit, you
9725049	9725129	Ouch.
9746832	9747572	Isn't that a nice joke?
9747592	9747952	Yeah.
9748152	9752813	Being a girl, I don't think you can completely appreciate the pain that I just felt right there.
9752833	9754774	What do you think, Matt?
9755194	9755674	I don't care.
9755954	9758494	I heard that one like, fifth grade.
9758514	9759354	Well, fuck you then.
9761655	9762955	Is there any... I have another one.
9762995	9763575	Another joke?
9763875	9764175	Yep.
9766296	9767456	This guy was in jail.
9768916	9771277	He had been in jail for so long and hadn't gotten laid.
9771637	9772837	He hadn't even been anyone's bitch.
9773741	9777883	So he gets out of jail, and they give him his suit of clothing and 20 bucks.
9778343	9781124	First thing he wants to do is get laid.
9781685	9782685	So he goes to a brothel.
9784406	9789628	And he talks to the madam there, and she's like, well, our women are at least 120 and up.
9789828	9793550	He's like, do you have anyone that I can get for 20 bucks?
9793570	9795431	She's like, well, we can give you to Bertha.
9796171	9798452	So he goes to Bertha, and Bertha's this woman with one leg.
9798532	9799452	She has a peg leg.
9800053	9802734	She's missing one arm, and she's got a glass eye.
9803676	9808300	So the guy is trying his hardest and he just can't get anything with Bertha.
9808740	9810482	She's like, look, why don't we do this?
9810522	9813204	So she takes out her glass eye and says, try this one.
9814125	9816767	So he goes at her eye, her eye socket.
9817248	9819770	It has been the best play he ever had in his life.
9820650	9824374	Then he tells her, next time I need to get something, I'm coming to you.
9824394	9826215	You were the best ever.
9826475	9828357	She's like, okay, honey, I'll keep an eye out for you.
9828377	9829358	Okay.
9832779	9833479	Ha ha ha ha.
9834460	9835400	Oh dear good lord.
9835560	9840243	Okay, on that note, I think we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.
9840883	9841523	Sound good to you guys?
9842764	9842984	Yes?
9843484	9844525	We can wrap it up in ribbons and bows.
9844585	9845265	Oh, you want booty music?
9845285	9845605	I'm sorry.
9845625	9847446	Well, I have this request though, so I've got to play this first.
9847866	9849387	Alright, I'm going to play this and then we'll do something booty.
9849607	9850067	Okay, here we go.
9850447	9851228	We'll be right back.
9856150	9857731	It's a long way to go, honey.
9858998	9861043	I know, but I'm afraid.
9861424	9862568	Where are we going?
9863972	9866579	Into the Dark Black Forest.
9942031	9944671	Into the Dark Black Forest
9949913	9953755	Hello everybody, it's Mr. Spanky.
9954656	9957837	As promised, I'm here on the air to give you some tips.
9958678	9962339	Tonight, I'm going to read you a letter, because I don't know much about it.
9962359	9965041	Well, I do know a thing or two about it, I have to admit, you guys.
9965361	9966702	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
9966922	9970463	But today, we're going to be talking about fellatio tips.
9971124	9973025	So I'm going to read a letter for you guys.
9973285	9975226	You might need a translation of that, Mr. Spanky.
9975996	9976577	I'm sorry.
9976757	9977418	Oh, fellatio.
9977699	9978980	That's a blowjob.
9979401	9979822	Okay.
9980042	9981724	Fellatio means a blowjob.
9982626	9983006	All right.
9984428	9987032	This letter comes to us from a girl named Emmy.
9988613	9995555	She says, My husband and I have been married 10 years, and during this time, my enjoyment for giving head has increased tremendously.
9996055	9999196	I have found the more I turn him on, the more it turns me off.
10000016	10001177	I'm sorry, the more it turns me on.
10001217	10001977	I can't read today.
10002777	10009539	I start off by teasing him a little, licking the head with my tongue, and licking the underside slowly from bottom to top.
10010299	10013700	I have also learned he likes me to seductively look at him while I'm doing this.
10014080	10015461	It adds to the teasing.
10016201	10023350	One problem I had was taking his cock all the way, because I enjoy giving pleasure to him so much I wanted to be able to deep throat.
10023911	10027075	I could do it once in a while, but most of the time I would gag.
10028564	10032645	So I thought that if I could just numb my throat somehow, I would stop gagging.
10033245	10034365	That's when I figured it out.
10034705	10038446	I bought some chloroceptive throat spray and put it in my nightstand.
10038806	10042967	The next time I gave him head, I had no problem swallowing his entire cock.
10044067	10047528	I can't tell you how turned on he was, and how turned on I was.
10048008	10053449	You can also use children's teething cream, but it doesn't have a pleasant taste and it's harder to apply.
10054409	10055230	That's my tip.
10055370	10056370	It works great for us.
10056751	10062635	There is nothing that you can do which more clearly shows your love for him than adoring his cock.
10062935	10064857	Well, thank you.
10065197	10067479	That was Mr. Spanky's next tip of the week.
10067899	10069000	You guys should look for me.
10069160	10070621	I'm in DDRPC.
10070781	10072782	I'm in a character expansion pack.
10073183	10074784	Bye, everybody.
10075104	10076085	See you next time.
10079299	10079900	Outro Music
10176578	10200908	Fly, fly, fly with it, back it up one more time Walk, walk, walk with it, stop, walk, stop with it Fly, fly, fly with it, bring them out of jail and break down Throw the ball up, swing that bat, turn your back, everywhere's bad Throw the ball up, swing that bat, turn your back, everywhere's bad Palm Beach, peanut butter, Dane County, jailed Orlando, peanut butter, Tallahassee, jailed
10214414	10215135	Man, shit, man.
10215355	10216415	What time is it, dawg?
10216475	10217957	I don't know what time it is, Raylo!
10218097	10219878	It's peanut butter jelly time!
10236750	10240032	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
10240052	10241373	Orange Lounge Radio.
10242825	10248347	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we're here to wrap up tonight's show because we're just about at the end.
10248447	10250147	We're going to wrap it up in cellophane.
10250168	10252428	We're going to wrap it up in a nice little bowl.
10252468	10253549	And sell it on eBay.
10253669	10255249	And give it to somebody for Christmas.
10259111	10262392	So anything else you guys want to talk about on the show tonight that we haven't gotten out yet?
10264212	10264872	Bree South.
10265113	10266113	I've mentioned it before.
10266413	10267073	Funny show.
10267573	10268134	Gotta love it.
10268914	10269274	On MTV.
10271897	10273118	Any more rants in you, Jamie?
10275280	10275880	Are you barking?
10277201	10282205	I'm wanting to... I'm feeling restless now.
10282486	10283346	You're feeling restless?
10283366	10284087	Yes.
10284447	10285788	You need to go out and play some DDR?
10285828	10287189	I'm feeling boar, yes.
10287470	10287890	Boar?
10294295	10296016	I'm going to Sunsplash tonight.
10296076	10297338	I'll be there until close.
10297618	10298018	Yes?
10298839	10299860	You can come with me, Jamie.
10301241	10301541	Cool.
10302819	10304000	So what are you guys going to play?
10304020	10308841	Because everything there is... You know what this town needs?
10308861	10309822	We need a Parapara team.
10311623	10311843	No.
10312363	10313363	Come on!
10313924	10314904	I am no Paralist.
10314944	10318165	I know maybe six of them and I only do four regularly.
10318185	10319246	You know what pisses me off?
10319826	10322847	And I'm pretty sure... No, this isn't just specific to Roseville Golf Land.
10323087	10324548	I know most golf lands have this problem.
10325008	10326909	The kids that tease people playing Parapara...
10327569	10329150	I mean, fucking... I had one of them kicked out.
10329290	10331030	God, I fucking hate those kids.
10331090	10333311	I hate kids that think they're better than everybody else.
10333791	10334631	That shit pisses me off.
10334651	10334931	You know what?
10334971	10338112	It's like, you know, at least we can memorize something.
10338172	10344914	You can memorize maybe, like, what beer tastes good or whatever, but it's just like, God, kids who think they're better than everybody else just really piss me off.
10344934	10346395	I want to kick so much ass.
10346435	10347435	You've seen me go off on them.
10347475	10350256	I had one of them kicked out, and the other one I said, okay, I'll pay for you to play.
10350296	10350556	Do it.
10350916	10351136	Dance.
10351156	10351456	Now.
10351616	10352157	Yeah, I know.
10352537	10355398	That was like the one that, uh, we had that on DDR once, too.
10355418	10355778	I remember that.
10355798	10356338	That was pretty cool.
10356378	10356538	Yeah?
10358606	10359407	Uh, I'm just looking.
10361128	10364110	And no, Orange Beanie, I'm not picking you up because you're in the other direction.
10364470	10364710	Sorry.
10366431	10367072	Aw, I'm sorry.
10367092	10371295	Oh, oh, oh, and don't forget Initial D. Oh, Initial D is cool.
10371395	10377539	Initial D. But yeah, kids piss me off, and there's a lot of them at Golf Land, and they're all rich and snobby, and they think they're better than everyone else.
10377559	10377879	They suck.
10377899	10378699	They piss me off, they suck.
10378799	10379360	And they suck.
10379500	10379980	They suck.
10380220	10380861	No, they don't suck.
10381901	10382862	No, because... They blow.
10385444	10389027	They can't even, no, no, they don't suck, they don't blow.
10389568	10391249	The fact that they exist is worse enough.
10391389	10396774	Oh God, I think I actually might have just created a pair of Parasak stars with my statement.
10397174	10397675	God.
10398215	10399897	My bad, my bad, sorry guys, my bad.
10399917	10402559	Oh, for the four that I know, or for six that I know.
10402699	10404060	Yeah, I'll join for the three that I know.
10404360	10406162	I'll join just so that we have a big group of people.
10406182	10407883	You have to teach me Like a Virgin correctly.
10407943	10409624	We need to do trick... Okay, I'll teach you how to do Like a Virgin.
10409644	10411726	And I'll teach you... You can teach me the one you know that I don't.
10411886	10414608	Okay, I do know Ashimatsu, but you know what I need to brush up on?
10414968	10417230	I need to brush up on Night of Fire.
10417430	10417610	Okay.
10418171	10419232	I need to remember how to do Eurobeat.
10419932	10420853	Yeah, teach me Eurobeat.
10420873	10421854	Learn to Eurobeat and then teach me.
10422994	10427018	So, uh... I'll get you my, uh, max 300 para-para going here.
10427418	10428919	No, I'll tell you what would be great about a para-team.
10428939	10430921	The next one that I want to learn, though, is O Sole Mio.
10431741	10436864	For that one day that I do feel like playing Parapara, what we need to do, we need to trick the assholes.
10437104	10447529	We'll just have everybody on the Parapara team sitting in the little booths, and like one person up on the machine, and then when somebody starts teasing them, just get everybody to get up and surround them and just start glaring, and then like Parapara in their face or something.
10448009	10448989	Everyone get up there and mirror.
10449189	10449630	That's right.
10449870	10450790	Everyone get up there and mirror.
10451210	10452111	Wow, that's so 80s.
10452251	10453031	Kick kids in the butt.
10453872	10455732	How about I just inject them with the AIDS virus?
10458514	10459194	Try Drano.
10459234	10460295	It kills them more painfully.
10462279	10464980	Imagine being injected with something that starts eating at your insides.
10465040	10466501	Or you just inject somebody with air.
10466781	10468722	Hey, I eat McDonald's too, okay?
10470483	10471203	I don't.
10471363	10472344	My point stays.
10472564	10474965	Okay, so I think that we should just go.
10475745	10477146	You think we're going to end this show now?
10477806	10478887	You want to end this show now?
10480087	10481088	No, we have three minutes.
10481548	10483069	We have enough time to do final thoughts.
10483249	10484449	You guys want to give your final thoughts?
10484469	10485790	Jamie, what is your final thought of today?
10488471	10488811	That's it?
10490982	10491422	Where's Brad?
10491442	10492163	Get Brad back in here.
10492283	10493123	He needs to do a final thought.
10494624	10498526	My final thought is I need more man porn.
10498626	10499466	I need man sex.
10500607	10500947	Thank you.
10501447	10502248	You need man sex.
10502508	10503589	Brad, do you have a final thought for today?
10503609	10504329	I need man sex.
10507471	10508051	Well now.
10508651	10509972	And we have that on tape now.
10510252	10510752	Yes, we do.
10510772	10512353	Hey, I'm going to play that last week.
10512453	10513634	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
10513814	10514574	I need man sex.
10515175	10516035	Tune in every Sunday night.
10518271	10520412	Hello to those people listening to us in Japan.
10520572	10524713	I whored out our station to people listening in Japan that were Orange Lounge fans.
10525033	10526573	Orange Lounge the group, not the radio.
10526873	10529554	So, their trick, haha, now we got you.
10529774	10530174	Yeah.
10530334	10531375	We got you good.
10532735	10535576	Um, well, I don't know, maybe we should...
10536889	10541250	Offer them something a little bit different than just saying, ha ha, we tricked you.
10541730	10542150	Okay, what?
10542330	10543450	Say, arigato gozaimasu.
10543890	10544330	What's that mean?
10544470	10545331	Thank you very much.
10545351	10545631	Oh, okay.
10545651	10546531	You should know what that means.
10546551	10547131	No, I don't.
10547291	10547891	I'm too white.
10548271	10558513	We also have those four Orange Lounge songs that we can't, no, I'm not sure if you have them in rotation, the stuff from Poppin' Music, Guitar Freak 2nd, 3rd, and... No, but I'll get them very soon.
10558593	10559033	Yes, very soon.
10559053	10561253	Four more Orange Lounge tracks for the rotation.
10561734	10564134	What do the kids have to look forward to next week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10566722	10569844	We're going to sacrifice Loki to the gods live on air.
10571626	10573007	Hey, Loki is a god.
10573067	10574508	He's the Riddler god, okay?
10575989	10577350	That means you're played by Jim Carrey.
10578892	10579953	In a bad movie!
10580573	10581814	Hey, I like Jim Carrey, okay?
10582134	10582855	That'd be an honor.
10583756	10586378	Dude, then you should, like, watch The Mask at my place on Laserdisc.
10587219	10588160	I have The Mask on DVD.
10589040	10590682	I have it on Laserdisc, and Laserdiscs are cooler.
10591682	10593284	They're big CD coasters.
10594212	10594632	They're not.
10595434	10597298	Oh, oh, oh.
10597398	10599763	My half.com thing is going to arrive sometime next week.
10599783	10600083	What's that?
10600364	10603671	I ordered Sense and Sensibility on widescreen Laserdiscs so I can watch more Alan Rickman.
10604984	10605925	You're a hopeless case.
10606745	10615608	If you go to Jamie's friends page now, it is filled up with the Slytherin community, the Draco community, the Alan Rickman community.
10615668	10623671	I'm in the Alan Rickman community, the Slytherin community, the Professor Snape community, and I'm in the Animal Crossing community.
10623971	10625771	And the Potter Draco boy part.
10625791	10627692	No, I am not.
10628012	10628492	Just kidding.
10629273	10630693	Although I've read some pretty good things.
10631353	10632374	Ah, I didn't mean to hear that.
10633712	10635954	I'm not into the teeny boy stuff, though.
10636055	10636575	Okay, good.
10637056	10637236	Good.
10637276	10637917	You're okay.
10637937	10638697	You're still sane, then.
10639398	10641420	But yet, she still hasn't joined the Animal Crossing group.
10641460	10641921	What's up with that?
10641941	10642321	Yes, I did.
10642361	10643562	I joined it here at your place.
10643763	10644123	My bad.
10644163	10644443	My bad.
10644483	10644764	I'm sorry.
10644984	10645284	My bad.
10646746	10647847	This is for me from Jamie.
10652685	10655948	Uh, my final thought is, uh, I hate boys!
10656149	10656649	I hate boys!
10657751	10658051	I hate them.
10658231	10659513	Well, then we'll get you some pussy.
10662116	10662937	I'm confused.
10662977	10663297	Tuna.
10663998	10664479	Red Bull.
10665199	10666621	Now all I need is two turntables.
10666821	10667662	I have the microphone.
10667682	10669505	Two turntables and a microphone.
10669545	10670886	We'll get you a fish taco!
10672308	10677192	Jamie actually had fish tacos the other week, or the other day, and I was laughing at her because she was eating fish tacos.
10677212	10678873	I actually won an eBay auction.
10679013	10682456	I got a second 5-key controller now for Beatmania, and it's a lot better than the other one.
10682856	10688981	And I'm gonna, I'm gonna, yeah, no, I have the old ASCII pad, I have the, it's the Beatcon, whatever that is.
10689822	10691283	It's, it's better than the other one.
10691383	10691943	Ew, gross.
10691963	10692664	But I'm modding them.
10692684	10696087	I don't know.
10696107	10697528	They're all like that, they're all like that.
10699432	10702335	There's one with piano keys, which is somewhat decent.
10702476	10705919	I have the official ASCII one, which sucks ass.
10707722	10711626	But I've been hearing that NCSX was dropping their 2DX controllers to $50.
10713188	10714810	So, I'm checking that out.
10715922	10721544	Well, I'm doing a mod on mine that actually, I'm making one, I'm making a brand new mod for 5-key.
10721804	10725725	I'm going to actually put ball bearings underneath the turntable to make it spin better.
10726305	10733967	Because it has room for it, and they have these two really crappy plastic things that it spins on, but there's room for ball bearings inside there, so I'm going to put that on there.
10734127	10738168	And maybe a glue rubber mat on top of it so that you have grip on the turntable.
10738188	10741669	Because the keys and everything is fine, but yeah, just the turntable sucks.
10742269	10743349	Make me a 2DX controller.
10746519	10746639	No.
10747280	10747480	Okay.
10747660	10748120	I'll pay you.
10749221	10749481	Maybe.
10750522	10750842	One more.
10751162	10751763	One more thought.
10752243	10754645	Which dysfunctional Sesame Street character are you?
10756146	10758828	I got Bert and Ernie's gay relationship.
10759708	10765572	Surprisingly enough, I got Grover on E. I'm Grouch's heroin addiction.
10767614	10768334	And what about you, Brad?
10768614	10770536	I didn't participate in this dorky thing.
10770556	10772257	Then you're transsexual Elmo.
10773562	10775443	Alright, I have a thought, actually.
10775503	10779666	I thought it was kind of weird how... Hey, Jamie, yes I can think.
10780266	10786069	Anyway, I thought it was kind of weird how Rob disappeared from our studio when Mr. Spanky came in.
10786830	10787690	Yeah, that's amazing.
10787750	10791392	And why did Mr. Spanky sound like he was related to Triumph the Insult Comic Dog?
10794254	10795114	Maybe they are related.
10795134	10797035	That sexual tip was good.
10797135	10799317	I hate you.
10799557	10800337	He was scaring me, though.
10800357	10801378	He kept grabbing my ass.
10802682	10803543	Mr. Spanky, that was.
10804663	10805784	Oh, I thought he was talking about me.
10805824	10806825	I guess he doesn't mind when I do it.
10809387	10810508	All right, we're running over.
10810548	10811088	We've got to go.
10811388	10812129	Take care, you guys.
10812149	10812589	Have a great night.
10812609	10813590	Yeah, we're running over the show.
10813610	10816592	Thanks for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
10817012	10817653	We love you.
10818053	10818593	My bad.
10818793	10819154	Bye.
10819194	10819434	Bye.

10840309	10843751	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
10844311	10848233	And now, a buffoon's meeting with the dean of admissions at a prestigious college.
10849813	10857278	Well, Michael, I'd like to extend my warmest congratulations on your upcoming graduation, and I understand you're interested in matriculating here in the fall.
10858619	10860160	I got a snake, man!
10860680	10866384	Yes, pets are welcome here on campus, be it the traditional dog or cat, or even the occasional reptile.
10867945	10869866	One time I fed it some beer, man!
10870726	10872668	It was slithering this way and that!
10873168	10874709	It was all fucked up!
10875527	10876367	I'm sure it was.
10877008	10880989	Well, we discourage inappropriate drinking among both students and pets here on campus.
10882229	10883410	Fucking shit!
10884290	10887071	Yes, that's a not uncommon reaction to this policy.
10887771	10889712	So tell me a little bit more about your background.
10891052	10893553	My father's a fucking asshole, man!
10893893	10894713	Hmm, I see.
10895414	10897975	Your feelings of rebellion are not unusual at your age, son.
10899635	10901876	My mother's a piece of shit, too!
10902839	10905660	Well, I hope you can find an outlet for your hostility over the summer.
10905941	10908442	So you can come to school in the fall relaxed and ready to learn.
10909542	10912844	My teacher in high school was a stupid bitch, man!
10913645	10916086	She had her head way up her ass!
10917166	10921769	Well, the quality of the faculty at a university such as ours far exceeds that of a local public high school.
10923109	10926211	Your secretary's a real fat bitch, man!
10926831	10930033	Yes, she's tried many diets over the years with minimal success.
10931980	10933681	I had diarrhea last month.
10934602	10937003	I had to shit all fucking day.
10938064	10938424	Uh-huh.
10938964	10940785	Well, we all get the occasional stomach bug.
10941105	10942266	Never a pleasurable experience.
10943026	10945448	So, have you given any thought to your choice of major?
10947289	10949690	I've got a big fucking boner right now.
10951091	10951491	I see.
10952071	10955133	Well, sexual arousal is not uncommon during periods of nervous tension.
10955313	10956194	I do not take offense.
10958015	10960116	One time I ate my neighbor's shit.
10961658	10962558	That's understandable.
10963118	10966620	Well, I enjoyed meeting you, and we'll be sending you our decision by the end of the month.
10968520	10970861	I bet you got really hairy balls.
10971621	10973382	Yes, it's a veritable force down there.
10974222	10974582	Bye-bye.
10976403	10980104	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
