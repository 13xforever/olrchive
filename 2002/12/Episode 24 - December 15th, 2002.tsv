3588	4529	Attention!
5450	9313	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10954	15998	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19631	22554	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22874	26057	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26637	29340	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29880	32783	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33563	33984	Just kidding.
34184	35765	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35985	36646	In this episode...
42185	45326	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
45466	47627	Why did they have to take the word gay?
73381	75402	We are live and this is episode number 24.
101829	109893	For December the 15th of 2002, you're tuned into the money scene's most hilarious radio station of all things be money.
110853	112994	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
113434	118497	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
119417	120037	Burr, burr.
120057	121278	Burr, burr is the word.
122158	124740	I'm freezing.
125740	126380	I'm freezing.
130931	132672	Y'all know her better as DarkSakura.
132732	136153	In that corner, say hello to our tech massa, Loki!
136433	137173	Hello, everybody.
138394	142255	And also in studio with us tonight, nobody!
144096	144796	Dead air.
145416	146437	It's just the three of us.
146677	152259	We're just feeling the love here tonight between the three of us.
152559	154199	Oh, they're telling me they can't hear us.
154279	155180	I don't have my mic around.
155360	156100	Oh, boy.
158314	162697	Hello, hi, our mics weren't loud enough during that whole intro, my bad, you wanna say hello again, Jamie?
163897	167580	I said I was cold, dammit And Loki, you wanna say hello again?
168080	186031	Yeah, sure, whatever Sorry about that, we're still new at this, 24 episodes into this and we still don't know what the fuck we're doing Uh, anyway, we got a whole bunch of fun things to talk about tonight, but we'll get to that pretty soon Actually, I don't know what the hell we're gonna talk about tonight, I think it's just, uh, the holidays kill everything, don't they?
188778	189338	Uh, sure.
189398	192999	Loki's kind of panicking right now, by the way.
194279	194819	What's the matter?
195920	198180	Okay, uh, my Tourney Mix 3 entry.
198220	198820	It's all done.
199280	200181	I just need to upload it.
200661	207282	My dial-up doesn't want to upload it, and I have to upload it here, but we can't because the stream, you know, might get cut out, so I'm stuck.
207342	208123	I have it on a CD.
208163	208663	It's all done.
209043	209743	I just can't get to it.
212699	215708	Alright, well, we'll panic about Loki's situation a little bit.
215728	219199	In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break, and we will be right back.
219580	219941	Enjoy.
243113	264964	VitoZone Nothing can be forgiven I want to be free I don't care about the shape I don't care even if I break it I'm always strong and fierce My feelings are just one I don't believe in an end I'll search for the real tomorrow until the end Breakdown The music that sounds like a sound The tension that rises I'll stay by your side until the end
280209	281651	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
317728	321494	Alright, here's something being brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.
322175	326381	It's some tracks from the new Good Cool compilation that was just recently released.
326401	328063	We're going to play a couple tracks here for you.
328524	334052	We're going to play Spooky and Shake It Down back to back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
524577	529763	I just wanna show you now That's all you need to set my body free I just wanna say
620240	621480	Orange Lounge Radio.
621820	623961	We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.
630082	633243	Hello, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
633263	634563	That was horrible.
635143	636263	I told you you'd hate it.
636463	637664	It's kind of funny.
637684	638724	Haven't you ever heard that song?
638884	639784	That Missy Elliott song?
640104	640644	Do I listen to that?
640664	642825	Yeah, I know you don't listen to pop music, but whatever.
643605	645405	Just because I have taste.
646545	647546	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
648586	648946	Anyway...
649793	656301	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio And that was some stuff from the Good Cool CD, by the way
658524	660085	Spooky, and Shake It Down.
660165	661625	Those were the two songs you heard back to back.
662025	663386	Before that, Blake Down.
664266	667107	A song that I just pulled out of my ass because I didn't have anything else queued up.
668388	671749	Oh, the chat room seemed to enjoy that promo, so they got the joke.
672549	672930	That's good.
673670	674210	How you doing?
674410	675731	Loki, you still over there panicking?
676331	676591	Yeah.
676771	684934	Twin tried to get you a... Twin couldn't shut his big fat mouth and try to get you a waiver or something, but now they said, no, you gotta get it in by midnight.
686255	686595	Eastern?
688641	693807	This guy said Eastern, but if you notice, their webpage doesn't say anything, so I don't know.
694147	694848	You could sue.
695288	696370	You should take him to Judge Judy.
697250	698111	I don't give a crap.
700074	703257	That's okay, because the only one that matters is MakeEditGetPorn, right?
703878	704098	Yeah.
706397	708238	That's okay, because we have a backup plan.
708298	709119	So Loki's okay.
709159	713222	It's just my roommate's got to get home in enough time for us to, you know, get into a system and upload something.
713522	713903	Break it.
714123	715564	Oh, hey, good suggestion.
716124	717806	Instead of Judge Judy, Judge Jamie.
721489	722189	You need a bookmark?
722289	723110	Yeah, use that.
723530	723950	All right, hey.
725011	725532	So how was your week?
725552	727113	I spent reading Harry Potter during the break.
728874	732297	You're wearing this lovely new Slytherin scarf to go with your new obsession.
733291	734212	New Obsession.
734712	735673	Well, somewhat.
736374	737915	It's out of this year though, isn't it?
737935	747503	I'm very happy because this, it's not like the official one because the official ones are made really cheaply and kind of look stupid because they have like the house logo on them.
747563	748424	I think they look stupid.
749085	752067	But this is a handmade scarf in green and gray.
752427	757452	It's the Slytherin color so I wear it and it's made to look like the ones in the movies and it's warm and comfy.
758957	761540	Some folks in the chat room are indicating they've read all four books.
761580	763323	Which one's your favorite out of all the four books?
763403	764384	Oh, Goblet of Fire.
765405	766587	Goblet of Fire was the best.
767048	767608	Alright, cool.
767729	769331	Just because of the whole ending.
769491	770632	My god, that was beautiful.
773596	775797	Okay, so did anyone do anything?
775817	779199	Oh, we have a special, special guest tonight in the chatroom.
779219	779980	This makes me happy.
780020	781881	This makes me moist as a snack cake, ladies and gentlemen.
782241	786884	DJ Morpheus, my old buddy from Under Tradition Live, Travis, in the chatroom tonight.
786944	792147	And he's saying, oh, that reminds me, I need to send Jamie a pic of the Sakura Japanese restaurant sign out here.
792327	792667	Yes.
793848	795469	I want to see signs with my name on them.
795729	800593	And he's saying, by the way, he also said that Understation Live 3.0 is going to be debuting in January.
801153	801674	Exciting!
802174	804476	Stay tuned to UnderstationLive.org for all the details.
805016	808599	If you enjoyed last week's match game segment, we totally ripped that off of Understation Live.
808759	810661	It was a tribute, not a rip-off.
810981	811902	Oh yes, a tribute.
812162	815605	But that was in turn a tribute to the classic game show, because it rules.
815645	818127	I actually was just watching that the other day.
819027	819608	My favorite.
819648	820829	Charles Nelson Reilly!
823257	828060	Biggest flaming homosexual in the 70s.
829161	837366	Yes, my Mr. Spanky voice is inspired by Charles Nelson Reilly.
838347	841268	Ah, yes, Black Lab says, Game Show Network rules.
841408	843230	Game Show Network does rule.
843990	845531	I love the Game Show Network.
846212	847212	Except Wintuition.
847232	847953	What the fuck is Wintuition?
847973	848333	That show sucks.
852623	855066	Mark Summers is cool!
855907	857869	Mark Summers is cool, but not on that show.
857909	859350	Do you know who produces that show?
859390	860171	Who?
860431	862173	Is it a Mark Goodson television production?
862313	865417	No, it's Henry Winkler or whatever.
865917	866618	The Fonz.
866878	867619	Oh, The Fonz?
867659	868380	The Fonz.
868800	869261	No way.
869861	871363	Because The Fonz is cool.
872584	874466	Oh, we actually have the Monty News to report.
874526	875007	Go figure.
876204	878006	We actually have some things going on in the Bomani community.
878186	880208	There was a big tournament on Friday in the Bay.
880329	883312	There was the Miggle Evil Tournament 2, I believe it was called.
883332	884073	Am I right?
884173	884633	Evil Tournament 2?
884693	885074	I wanted to go.
885474	889178	I wanted to go too, but that whole Friday thing meant, you know, we'd have to drive.
889198	897487	I didn't get anything out of work until 6.30, and I only, you know, didn't, I got off work at 5.30 and was there until nearly 6.30 because Dan wasn't off work yet.
897587	897828	Nope.
899068	900829	I just didn't want to drive out there in the rain.
900849	901210	I'm sorry.
901250	907593	I probably could have... Hearing that the whole damn thing started late, I probably could have made it in time, but I just didn't want to drive in the rain.
907693	913316	My apologies to the folks there, but, you know, I just... I get all freaked out driving in storms.
914076	914617	I would have cried.
916798	921960	Anyway, oh yeah, we wanted to... We wanted to read the results to you from the tournament.
922021	926343	So, in Perfect Attack, fourth place went to Emphasis.
927651	928592	Nice job, Emphasis.
929053	930575	Third place went to Virtu.
931917	934540	Don't call him the Max 300 King, or he'll kick your ass.
935081	936543	Second place went to Chubbs.
938112	938412	Word.
938872	939412	Congratulations.
939533	942473	And first place, this is the hugest surprise of the century, Tigger.
943834	944174	Really?
944314	944714	Gasp.
945054	945875	Oh my god.
946175	946535	Gasp.
946575	949656	They did this whole new little bracket thing though that was kind of cool.
950776	956078	What they do, and this is kind of cool, we should talk about this, kind of different ideas, ways to run a tournament.
956558	957599	They took a bracket of 16.
959360	974637	and what they did, you know, just like normal except instead of the person losing the last match just automatically getting second place what they did is they removed Tigger out of the bracket and replayed all the matches that would have been affected by his presence, basically.
975397	977419	and so they determined a second place that way.
977679	982144	It's kind of interesting the way it works, but it sounded very cool and I guess it worked out pretty well.
982244	982804	Sounds neat.
983004	984926	So, that was pretty cool.
986067	989731	Freestyle, third place, went to a fellow called Hamsterhead.
991532	991873	Yummy.
992053	993034	Does he do the hamster dance?
993494	994875	Um, what?
996176	997658	Yeah, worst joke ever, sorry.
998832	1013372	2nd place went to 001 I thought it was 007 00 something got 2nd place DCB here typed all these results to me I thought it was 007 It could have been 001, I don't know In 1st place
1014734	1014994	Word.
1015014	1015115	Word.
1041781	1044342	I don't know, what else is there to talk about, but Monty News.
1044522	1048583	There are rumors saying that DDR Extreme is going to be released on Christmas.
1049343	1050543	Do you guys think there's any truth to that?
1050983	1052883	That sounds kind of early to me.
1053284	1055204	Christmas is a commercial holiday in Japan.
1055704	1063626	Of course, that's not far off from here, but even so, I don't think that they would put a significance in that date for the release of the game.
1064736	1069540	I know, it sounds more like somebody's little fantasy than reality news, but who knows?
1069680	1073442	That's coming from a fairly reputable source, so we shall see.
1076344	1078486	I think it's an early release date.
1078506	1083029	I remembered hearing that the official release date was sometime in early January, so that's what I'm going to stick with.
1083049	1084951	That's my story and I'm sticking to it, right?
1085011	1090915	Until I see something in Naoki's journal or something, which doesn't exist anymore.
1091380	1091940	Nope, it's gone.
1092640	1092780	Yay!
1092860	1093361	Good!
1094021	1095241	But we lost our favorite joke.
1095261	1096261	Maybe we should start one.
1096982	1098702	We should do a journal on behalf of Naoki.
1099322	1100063	Yeah, we should.
1100343	1101943	You know, I've got an extra live journal code.
1102683	1104624	The lost deep thoughts of Naoki.
1105764	1106284	I'll do that.
1106344	1107085	I'll set that up.
1107965	1108785	Alright, let's do it.
1108865	1111326	We'll make a Naoki live journal or something.
1112246	1115467	Now don't go getting ideas and taking the name before we can get to it or we'll kick your ass.
1115487	1116087	Yeah, that's ours.
1116147	1117027	I'll set you on fire.
1117268	1117868	We claim it.
1118328	1118688	Dibs!
1122389	1123730	I'm not cold anymore, Emily.
1123911	1124591	You're not cold anymore?
1124611	1128014	Well, because that's because we've got the lights in here that make everything hot.
1130137	1131578	I went shopping this week.
1132339	1132919	What'd you buy?
1133860	1133980	Oh!
1134721	1136122	You've got a present for Jamie, don't you?
1136202	1137524	I bought Christmas gifts.
1137584	1139646	Let's have Jamie open her Christmas present live on air.
1139666	1140246	This will be fun.
1140406	1143409	Let's play some Christmas-y music to celebrate.
1144550	1145852	You can't open it until I play music.
1147694	1152017	Well, now that I've got bills paid, I can go out and buy the rest of the presents that I need to.
1153658	1158001	Yeah, it's kind of scary when you get down to $200 in your bank account and you've got bills due.
1159302	1159522	Ah!
1160743	1163244	There we go, some nice Christmas music for you to be opening presents to.
1166327	1167627	Goddamn, what'd you tape this with?
1168508	1169228	Use packing tape.
1173482	1174945	It looks like me to you.
1175487	1176248	Oh my god!
1176268	1178252	You're quite astute, aren't you?
1179515	1181239	I am going to be an Albrecht Van Heuven.
1184051	1195295	I have Quigley Down Under, Die Hard, Galaxy Quest, Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, and Dogma Special Edition.
1195435	1196235	I'm a happy girl.
1196315	1198856	I'm drooled for hours.
1199496	1202897	Would you like to explain the Alan Rickman fetish to anybody that's new to our show?
1203877	1206218	He's hot, and I don't care how old he is, I love him.
1208539	1210099	I didn't know he was in Quigley Down Under.
1210139	1211400	Wasn't this movie really bad?
1212481	1213662	I don't know.
1213702	1215142	I've got Tom Selleck in it.
1216143	1219585	Yeah, but, like, ever since Magnum P.I., Tom Selleck, like, sucks.
1219905	1221025	There's a few I miss, though.
1221165	1221906	Like, Blow Dry.
1222026	1222926	I couldn't find that one.
1224447	1224987	That's okay.
1225027	1226808	Something tells me Jamie's going to be busy for a little while.
1227289	1230950	Well, no, what I just picked up on Laserdisc was Sense and Sensibility.
1233392	1235733	If that isn't a foofy chick flick, I don't know what is.
1239415	1240615	I can go squee now.
1241416	1241696	Squee!
1243567	1244047	Very cool.
1244787	1249509	Aw, feeling the love here on Orange Laundry Radio.
1249569	1251169	I'm getting such great use out of my GameCube.
1251189	1252389	I love that thing more than anything.
1252469	1253890	I play Phantasy Star Online now.
1253910	1256951	I went out and bought Phantasy Star Online and that game just takes so much ass.
1258131	1261312	I'm just trying to get some DDR people going in on that.
1261752	1266533	There's a little thread over on DDR Freak if you check the other games for them.
1266553	1268594	There's a whole little thread on Phantasy Star Online.
1268614	1272055	So you should check that out because they're trying to form a block and ship.
1273901	1275582	I forgot, I love Christian Slater too
1303720	1304381	Why are you tired?
1304401	1309027	I was working on my website until 6 in the morning.
1321351	1321871	What the hell?
1321911	1322692	I went to bed early.
1336349	1341612	Good Buddy Jabberwocky, who we did a fuck-off show with before Rocky yesterday.
1341772	1343573	No, it was Friday night that we did the fuck-off show.
1343994	1352098	We did a little fuck-off show, and then we decided to go to Rocky last night with another friend of ours, Neil Bugt, who gives the web space, by the way.
1352438	1355380	He is my Sky.cx webmaster.
1356541	1359903	We all decided to go to Rocky in the Bay Area, because we don't have it here in SAC anymore.
1360783	1361363	and we had fun.
1361403	1365645	It was the second week in a row actually that I'd been because we all went the week before with Jabberwocky.
1365685	1366065	It was fun.
1366725	1367385	Good times.
1367685	1376108	But we don't get out of there until damn near 3 in the morning and then we had to go looking for diesel because Neil's car runs off of diesel fuel.
1376528	1377648	Does he have a Mercedes?
1377709	1380870	No, he has a Jetta, but it's one of those special ones that runs off of diesel fuel.
1380890	1384451	So we had to drive for like 45 minutes to find a place open 24 hours that had diesel.
1384871	1388052	Finally found one and then we stopped at Denny's on the way back.
1388872	1392195	and Jabberwocky got into an argument with a waitress over covered and smothered.
1392975	1394056	Well, it wasn't really an argument.
1394096	1395597	It was more of a discussion.
1397699	1399180	Sounds fascinating.
1400561	1400942	Not really.
1400982	1401582	This is crappy radio.
1401602	1402623	I went to bed.
1402643	1403624	Just kidding.
1403644	1404104	You went to bed?
1404144	1404865	What time did you go to bed?
1409921	1417764	I stayed up looking for this one picture that I could not find.
1417844	1424026	It was from, for anyone who's seen Chamber of Secrets, it was the scene with Snape dueling.
1424706	1431569	And I wanted to find him dueling and I couldn't find it until like 4.30am I found it.
1431889	1434270	I did a post at the time that I found it.
1435170	1436951	And then I finally finished my new icon set.
1437011	1439513	And that was on your own personal live journal.
1439593	1443215	Yeah, my own live journal, which if you want to know what it is, then go to the Orange Lounge community.
1443235	1444636	Yes, go to the Orange Lounge live journal.
1445656	1447878	And look on the friends list there and you'll find me.
1450039	1455642	I did a post on there about something that we're going to play on the show tonight for all the Animal Crossing addicts.
1456643	1458164	You want to give an Animal Crossing update?
1458184	1459785	What's new in the world of Animal Crossing?
1460705	1461626	I want Olivia back.
1462911	1465833	We hung a sign out front of her house that calls her a bitch, because she is a bitch.
1466633	1467454	Ooh, we have a visitor!
1467494	1467834	Doorbell!
1467894	1468735	Hooray, doorbell!
1469535	1470636	We have another person.
1470656	1471877	Who's gonna walk through the door?
1471997	1478642	I have, for anyone who plays Animal Crossing, I'm sure you all go talk to KK, or Tote KK, as his name is.
1479883	1489490	And you can get a song from him, and he sings a little song and plays his little guitar, so I have one of his songs that, uh, I won't tell you what it is until right before we play it, unless you feel like playing it?
1489798	1492762	We will go to break very soon and we'll play that.
1493743	1495885	This break is going to be interesting because I'm actually going to leave.
1497467	1498268	We're kicking Rob out.
1498548	1500330	I'm going to be gone for a little bit.
1500350	1501972	We're making him get us caffeine.
1502052	1502833	You know what we'll do though?
1503374	1507799	We'll let Dave live out a little fantasy of his and we'll let him sit in the chair.
1510106	1510486	No!
1510906	1511447	No, no, no.
1511547	1512687	Dave has to sit on the floor.
1512747	1514828	Okay, so Dave can sit on the floor and Loki can sit in the chair then.
1514928	1516468	I'm going to sit in the big chair.
1516508	1518049	You're going to sit in the chair?
1518069	1518189	Fine.
1518209	1519630	You can sit in the big chair.
1519670	1520890	He gets to sit in this chair.
1521590	1522571	Hey, Dave, what's up?
1523331	1524051	Screw you, Rob.
1524091	1524371	Hi, Dave.
1524391	1526292	The big chair is mine.
1526872	1527492	Hi, Dave.
1527512	1528853	Hi.
1529602	1530342	So what's new, Dave?
1530362	1532984	You're the only one that's actually gone out and played any Bimani this week.
1533024	1534265	What do you want to say?
1534305	1535065	Oh, you did, Loki?
1535825	1537246	Saturday sucked ass.
1537506	1537766	Why?
1538347	1541528	Well, Friday was cool because I went to Golf Land and everyone was there.
1541568	1543249	And it was like, happy good time.
1543910	1546851	I know, but everyone that normally goes there is there.
1547572	1550053	And then... What I said is I wasn't there, so it didn't count.
1551024	1551244	Yeah.
1552225	1558591	And so then that was cool, and I said, well, Saturday is probably going to be the same because everyone goes that day too.
1559331	1563755	And I went there, and Will and Cedric were there for a little bit, and then they left, and I was all alone.
1564416	1567538	I played so much Initial D. All by yourself.
1568359	1569900	I was dancing all alone.
1572182	1574064	Were you dancing all alone in a kimono?
1575993	1576233	Yes.
1577454	1578594	In the middle of Golfland.
1580115	1580355	Yes.
1581316	1584297	I actually did the nicest thing I've ever done in DDR.
1584657	1587339	Some guy offered to pay, you know, to see me play.
1587359	1588379	He's like, oh, you're so good.
1588680	1589000	Wow.
1589400	1590661	You know how that happens sometimes.
1590701	1591421	Was he hitting on you?
1591761	1593942	No, he was like 50 with his family.
1593982	1595063	He's like, oh, you have to see this guy.
1595323	1596083	I don't mean nothing.
1596503	1597484	I was like, no, I'll pay for it.
1597504	1597964	It's okay.
1598364	1600165	And I did that, and I was like, wow.
1601146	1601746	I'm so nice.
1603667	1607488	Wait, so like, you're nice because somebody gave you money to dance?
1607768	1608848	Dance, monkey, dance!
1609068	1610408	No, but see, I didn't accept the money.
1611269	1612189	Oh.
1612369	1615110	And I was like, damn, I'm so nice, and I'm so modest.
1617770	1620391	The last time somebody offered me tokens like that, I took them.
1620611	1622631	What in the hell is our chatroom doing right now?
1623071	1624191	They're just typing dots.
1624251	1625112	They're on drugs.
1625172	1627352	I'm going to kick the next person who types dots.
1627832	1628552	It's Twin.
1628632	1629593	Oh, it's Twin, yay.
1629713	1630153	Kick him.
1630913	1631433	Good seed.
1634822	1635863	Oh, there's 23rd Magus.
1638205	1639386	We're having a kickfest.
1642308	1644629	See, it's funny because the lag... Yeah, I know.
1644890	1645630	The lag didn't know.
1647631	1648892	So they didn't even know about it.
1650233	1651014	Oh, he did it again.
1652295	1654016	See, that's just... Oh, no.
1654036	1655977	Joe Mama's playing cop for me.
1656018	1656358	That's good.
1657890	1671476	If you'd want to join our chatroom and join in the fun of getting booted repeatedly when you do bad things, just go to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx.
1672036	1672837	It's just that simple.
1672857	1675798	And then click on chat, and all of the rules you need are right there.
1676899	1677339	And then...
1679274	1683297	God, our chat room is just... They're all on PMS tonight or something.
1683317	1684238	No, everyone's on Happy Crack.
1685399	1687040	Speaking of Happy Crack, I need Twinkies.
1687321	1689782	Speaking of Happy Crack, I'm going to make a run right now.
1689882	1690983	So we're going to take a quick break.
1691284	1694546	We'll be back, and when we come back, I'm not going to be here.
1694666	1698689	So you'll get your sim update, and who knows what's going to happen while I'm not here.
1699270	1699630	I don't know.
1699670	1700170	I'm scared.
1700391	1704734	During this break, though, we are going to give everyone a little taste of Animal Crossing.
1704814	1708277	Yes, we will have you enter that just one minute.
1709297	1711479	DJ KK, if ever you're interested in pulling it up
1737956	1740497	and go ahead and give a listen.
1740517	1743299	This is actually the one with him singing it, so enjoy.
1743699	1748741	And also during this break, we'll play one more track from the Good Cool CD and some other random crap.
1748781	1749001	Enjoy!
1765555	1774082	Quack, quack, me, oh, me, me, oh, oh, me, oh Me, me, quack, quack, oh, oh, oh Quack, la, me, quack, oh

1883219	1889521	Oh, what a groove!
1889961	1895982	A groove, groove, groove like this makes your body move, move, move!
1896002	1903084	You've got to feel the music, feel the way it flows, feel the vibrations from your head down to your toes!
2043502	2045304	I am DJ Sender!
2046024	2049727	Right now, in the club in Shibuya, the most popular DJ is me!
2049807	2050148	Shut up!
2050188	2050748	Get out of here!
2051088	2053250	I'm not just a swimmer.
2053330	2056012	I'm the most groovy DJ right now.
2056213	2057414	I'm Pani Kei!
2057434	2058054	Let's have a cool play!
2058094	2058755	Let's have a cool play!
2078155	2078775	Can you hear me?
2078795	2079276	This is Trombone!
2127375	2127736	Thank you.
2193061	2195024	Come on baby, won't you be my girl?
2195224	2198970	Come on girl, let me rock your world Come on baby, won't you be my girl?
2199190	2200973	Come on girl, let me rock your world
2235499	2236980	Hey, we're back and stuff.
2237080	2238460	I have the chair.
2253666	2255067	Yay!
2255507	2255887	Chair!
2256107	2256407	Chair!
2256668	2256908	Chair!
2256968	2257448	Chair!
2257688	2257968	Chair!
2258188	2258448	Chair!
2258889	2259729	That's old.
2260309	2260670	That's like AX2000.
2260850	2263351	And I have nothing.
2264231	2264772	Yay.
2264792	2265512	Damn, you suck.
2266432	2266873	I do.
2267533	2268513	I love that scarf.
2268553	2269254	That's so cool.
2269274	2270675	Dude, he's checking out my scarf.
2270695	2272616	I can get you a Ravenclaw one.
2273636	2274476	If you want.
2274637	2276878	Rob didn't leave fast enough, so we had to kill him.
2277318	2278298	I buried his body.
2278579	2279719	Well, I didn't really bury it yet.
2279739	2281980	No, Rob's getting me chocolate, so I'm happy.
2282180	2283361	And then we're getting boba later.
2284644	2286289	We're going to Tapioca Express afterwards.
2289042	2291643	Play the Max 2 that's been recently installed.
2291683	2292444	Hey, that's local news.
2292944	2301348	The Max 2 supposedly has been upgraded over at Tapioca Express in Davis, so we're going to go check out that action.
2301628	2302529	How far away is that?
2303109	2305170	It's like a 30 minute drive from here.
2305750	2306351	Something like that.
2306531	2307091	Not too far away.
2307731	2310313	Anyway, we need our update, our sim update thingy.
2311173	2314235	Once I get out of school and college...
2315015	2315475	and like 8 years.
2315515	2316176	Eventually.
2317036	2319238	And like, call me in 8 years.
2319258	2320639	You'll be 20 with the cane.
2321559	2321919	I'll be like 22.
2321979	2322880	Yeah.
2326602	2327423	Sim update time.
2327463	2327723	Whee!
2328403	2329264	Okay.
2329464	2333527	Obviously the most important thing that's going on right now is Tourney Mix 3.
2334087	2335328	Deadline is today.
2335868	2337109	Actually, deadline is in.
2338442	2341204	Oh, I'm like about an hour and 45.
2341524	2341865	Cool.
2343626	2344387	Stupid dial-up.
2344687	2354694	Anyways, so there's going to be, next week is going to be the official judging of it, and then you'll see on the 22nd, actual submissions come online for you to check out.
2354814	2357236	So look for that.
2358037	2360759	Aside from that, not too much going on.
2361179	2367464	They finished the Parapar graphics for Stepmania, so you'll see that in a new update probably soon.
2368404	2369505	and DWI.
2369525	2373227	I haven't really been paying attention to what kind of updates are going on there, so no big deal.
2374348	2383253	DDRUK finally finished updating all their booster packs, so you've got full sets of pretty much all the official files with the official graphics for the most part.
2384974	2386314	So go check those out for sure.
2387815	2389896	And aside from that, not too much else.
2390956	2396337	Just, you know, more files on DDR Maniacs, so go check those out, some pretty cool ones.
2396557	2398658	And I'm redoing my entire site.
2398698	2401078	Well, not my entire site, but the download section of it.
2401399	2406580	I've got, I'm sorting them all into, you know, 2DX style categories.
2407040	2410141	And I'm actually going to be doing a mass upload of a bunch of different files.
2410161	2412441	So you'll see a bunch of those coming soon.
2412821	2414062	Right now I only have a few of them done.
2415682	2417483	and David is trying to pretend he's so sweet.
2417703	2418104	Oh, what?
2418264	2418784	He sucks.
2419384	2419725	Okay.
2421105	2422966	We don't snore when you talk.
2423967	2425468	So don't snore when Loki talks.
2425548	2426548	Not out loud, at least.
2426669	2429930	Are you saying that you snore when I talk?
2430170	2430891	When he talks.
2431131	2432132	Oh, it's because you're boring.
2433452	2434453	You don't get a scarf then.
2435692	2436372	I am boring.
2437333	2444336	And then, of course, you know, deadline for my make etiquette porn contest, if I remember correctly, is next Sunday.
2445437	2448258	So, get your edits in, if you haven't yet.
2448638	2452620	Dave has entered, and if no one else enters, he will sweep the whole competition.
2454441	2455602	Has anyone else entered yet?
2456502	2456682	No.
2457903	2460564	I will win, and all the porn will be mine!
2461144	2461965	Hey, I'll enter.
2462285	2462705	Why not?
2462725	2464886	I want porn.
2465684	2468005	I want man porn, but I want porn.
2469146	2472248	If I get boob porn, then I can give it to people.
2473268	2475289	Dave, you don't get any porn.
2475329	2475829	Sorry, Dave.
2477390	2478091	No porn for you.
2478671	2479371	No porn for you!
2480532	2481813	I'm not entering for the porn.
2481853	2483433	I'm entering for the recognition of winning.
2483473	2485094	No, you can't have the chair back.
2485174	2486355	The porn is a bonus.
2486915	2488276	Holy crap, that was fast.
2490082	2491243	Where's my cupcakes?
2491844	2500591	I would have been back before the break was even finished if that stupid bitch in front of me in line knew how to use her goddamn ATM card in the little slider.
2501331	2502973	My preemptive FU of the week.
2503013	2505014	No, you need to save it for the FUs of the week.
2505675	2507656	Fine, I'll save it, but oh man, what a bitch.
2507877	2509238	Maybe we should just do the FUs of the week.
2509258	2510639	Well, we've got to wait for the chat room to submit theirs.
2510659	2511680	We've got to give them time to send theirs.
2512240	2513341	You want to do the FUs of the week right now?
2514588	2516710	We can do them in a minute, but Matt's still finishing.
2516770	2517811	Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
2517851	2518752	Yeah, Rob!
2518812	2522535	Chatroom, send me your FUs of the week over private message, or send them to Jamie's name right now.
2524276	2525898	Actually, okay, yeah, change your nick back to Sky.
2525938	2529421	Okay, Chatroom, send me your FUs of the week to Sky, and we'll get to those right after Loki finishes.
2530022	2532083	Yeah, um... But I get the chair again.
2532744	2534385	Okay, I guess I get the floor again.
2536107	2537108	Hey, the floor is cool.
2537408	2538389	Word up for the floor.
2539195	2539695	Go Floor!
2539955	2540535	Okay, no.
2541476	2542016	Let's see.
2542956	2545097	Um, yeah, so you'll probably see some more stuff on there.
2545137	2550219	I know for a fact that I'm going to have Alien World, um, the DWI for that coming up on my site.
2550519	2556141	Also, I'm supposed to be getting some DWIs for, um, Starry Eye Surprise and, um, a few other songs.
2556601	2558822	So you'll be seeing those also hosted on my site.
2558882	2560982	So just check for that, and that's it.
2563603	2564944	And we're ready to go.
2564984	2565704	Whoa, food!
2566900	2567460	I got food.
2567701	2568701	Dude, this is awesome.
2568941	2574164	Rob came back with chocolate cupcakes for me, and now my scarf is being worn by Dave.
2574624	2576946	But you're not Slytherin, yo.
2577206	2578767	And guess what I brought back for Dave?
2579487	2580007	Nothing!
2580348	2580848	Ha!
2582649	2583049	Yeah?
2583289	2583850	Give me my scarf.
2583870	2584970	I don't need anything.
2585731	2588392	I'm content with sitting here on the floor.
2588432	2589293	Wearing my scarf.
2589513	2589793	Yeah.
2589973	2591494	Hey, it matches my sweatshirt.
2592254	2592895	Yeah.
2592935	2595196	But you're one of those boring old Ravenclaws.
2595771	2596752	Ravenclaw are tight.
2596952	2597452	No, they're not.
2597492	2598012	They're nerds.
2598192	2599073	Cho Chang, like what?
2599553	2600393	They're nerds.
2601834	2603035	And now in Harry Potter talk.
2603555	2605316	They better have a hot person play her.
2605336	2607097	Dude, Rob got fluffy balls.
2608377	2609898	Ball, ball, ball.
2610498	2612419	And Propel, because Propel is the drink of the gods.
2613460	2615741	I've only had it once, and that was when I had some of yours.
2616365	2617366	Do you want some Propel?
2617886	2618106	Okay.
2618506	2618686	No.
2621868	2623269	Everyone's being mean to me tonight.
2623289	2624310	Have my other bottle of Propel.
2625050	2625631	Okay, anyway.
2626611	2631174	One thing that somebody in the chat room wanted to mention in your sim update, I believe this was sent to me by Twen.
2632115	2634897	Feet of Fury got an update to it, and this is really interesting.
2635217	2639299	Actually, no update has been released, but there was some news on it.
2639379	2641281	So let me see if I can load up that news.
2641301	2642842	I've got to go to one of my websites here so I can get the...
2643542	2645382	The quote on that, because this is going to be interesting.
2645402	2648563	This is something that begs being talked about here before we get into the FUs of the week.
2648623	2650264	It's begging with a cup and everything.
2650724	2652244	Yes, it's begging for your dollars.
2652944	2654264	Literally, it's begging for a dollar.
2655565	2661526	Okay, so this is what the latest update was posted over at CAgames.com, I believe is the site, correct?
2661726	2662926	Yes, CAgames.com.
2663287	2665007	These are the folks that make Feet of Fury.
2665047	2669168	This is a DDR emulator for the Dreamcast, and we talked about this a couple weeks ago on the big program.
2669928	2673331	And I think our consensus was most of the people didn't particularly care for it.
2673731	2677654	I thought for a first mix it was okay, but it had a long way to go.
2677714	2679075	But most people here didn't care for it.
2679115	2682078	DDR's kind of surpassed that right now, but I don't know.
2682578	2687061	I think homegrown Dreamcast stuff is just cool to begin with.
2687462	2690584	It's like trying to play SSR on Happy Craft, because everything's flat.
2691485	2692405	And I'm being corrected.
2692485	2694987	It's not an emulator, it's a simulator.
2695568	2696208	Get over it.
2696348	2696849	I don't care.
2697049	2697509	Same thing.
2698910	2700531	It emulates the style of DDR.
2723846	2727669	The bigger news is that the finished Feet of Fury game will be sold rather than posted online.
2740798	2746160	They may do another preview version at that time with more bug fixes, better hardware support, better swap CD options.
2746560	2753983	But if you get the real press CD, the sold one, you're going to be treated to a lot more songs, more gameplay modes, and etc.
2754043	2756384	I think they're looking for a lawsuit.
2757885	2762167	I think that's kind of... They're begging to get a lawsuit, I agree.
2762447	2764868	I don't know, unless it's radically different from DDR.
2764948	2766448	They might be in some trouble for doing that.
2766508	2770030	Then again, Pump It Up survived this whole time, who knows.
2771917	2777103	There's also all the other clones out there that no one hears about that lurk around on eBay.
2778364	2780807	There's Technomotion, Easy To Dancer.
2780827	2782809	Yes, but they're not trying to sell Step Mania.
2784210	2786573	Yeah, and I mean, this is really the same.
2786993	2788715	I mean, pump it up at least at different notes.
2788735	2790337	This is still up, down, left, right.
2790397	2791198	It's the same thing.
2792403	2796625	Well, okay, remember though, Feedy Fury, the first thing it was, it didn't even have normal DDR mode.
2796645	2800227	All it was was a Dance Magic-like mode, which had different things.
2800647	2814114	And it looked different, but, I mean, at its concept, if Konami wanted to proceed with, you know, trying to get something against them, it probably could do it, because it is very similar to Dance Magic, which was in Disney's mix that they released here in the U.S.
2814174	2814434	already.
2815335	2816375	Let's hear it for Disney's Rave.
2817676	2819096	Oh, in the U.S., it's Mix.
2820017	2822098	I happen to have Disney's Rave, so... I know, I know.
2822628	2824029	I have a Disney mix as well.
2824849	2827290	I actually come to think of it, I got my Disneys right from you, didn't I?
2828330	2828550	Yes.
2829751	2833212	Regardless of whether they're going to get busted or not, we will be looking forward to that release.
2834072	2838114	We will, I'm sure, get a copy of A Feet of Fury and talk about it.
2838874	2839395	Rob will.
2839935	2840575	We will not.
2841255	2842816	The rest of us are not going to get it.
2843056	2844757	I will stay on top of it and look at it.
2846690	2848591	Maybe, because I don't use my Dreamcast for anything.
2849831	2852112	I use my Dreamcast to play Rainbow Cotton.
2852132	2853453	You know what I use my Dreamcast for?
2854633	2856254	No, I use it to play Nintendo games.
2856494	2858675	For Nester DC, that's all I use my Dreamcast for.
2858695	2859416	Oh, and Soul Calibur.
2859436	2860296	I play Puyo Da.
2861216	2861797	Puyo Da's cool.
2861817	2862517	Puyo Da's awesome.
2865338	2869180	Well, I had some questions in the chatroom wanting me to ask Loki about this, if you've seen this.
2869280	2870160	Actually, all of us, really.
2870640	2872601	The Flash Flash Revolution, have you seen that?
2872961	2873322	Yeah.
2873542	2874002	What do you think?
2874833	2877055	I don't like flash games, especially on dial-up.
2878937	2881859	Flash games all suck, and the same with the DDR.
2881959	2883861	I played it, and I was like, eh, whatever.
2884221	2886624	It took forever to load, and it wasn't that impressive.
2886664	2896653	Okay, I mean, I saw it, and it was basically, like, there's nothing special about it, it's just downloaded...
2897333	2901437	Choppie, DDR, Emulator, Simulator, whatever it's called.
2902638	2909205	And it has less songs, less variety than something like Styliania, so I don't see why you would play that.
2909325	2912068	Is that like that Delight Delight reduplication, that old, old one?
2912088	2913989	No, no, it's just like you download...
2915671	2916892	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
2935770	2937731	That was like, I don't know, a couple years ago.
2938432	2941854	So go check that out if you really want to play this stupid Flash crap.
2942354	2944555	I mean, there's nothing really special about it.
2944575	2945896	You can play Dance Dance Karnov.
2946416	2949998	And it's really choppy, and I don't think it would sync too well.
2950999	2951579	So, no.
2952380	2954201	How many people remember Dance Dance Karnov?
2955301	2955782	I have it.
2956502	2959584	Karnov was an old Nintendo game that really sucked.
2960655	2964140	And so they did like a DDR flash simulator with Carnov.
2964380	2965422	Yeah, but do you know what's cool?
2965902	2970889	Last week, I saw DDR on the graphing calculator, which I'd never seen before.
2971049	2972771	Okay, that's like really retarded.
2973012	2975175	That's the funniest thing I've heard in my entire life.
2975555	2976235	You know it was funny, though.
2976255	2982679	At least with pole position, you could, like, play it and it had made sense, but DDR, no music, hello, what's it gonna do, click at you?
2983039	2986381	DDR, no music, no flashing, just the arrow scrolled to the screen.
2986702	2988723	There's one BPM for all four songs.
2989283	2990424	It's just the notes on basic.
2990484	2991564	Actually, you're incorrect.
2991905	2997548	You can do sound with the calculator, but you have to build your own... I have a message.
2997568	3001350	I have a message for the person that created DDR for the graphing calculator.
3001450	3001850	Nerd!
3002210	3002911	Get a life!
3003311	3004411	Get a fucking life.
3004972	3005812	Go outdoors.
3005912	3007373	Smell a flower or something.
3007433	3008553	Get a girlfriend.
3008593	3009293	A boyfriend.
3009333	3009934	Who cares?
3010414	3011414	Go out and get laid.
3013255	3014575	Somebody got bored in calculus.
3016136	3016936	I'll say Jesus.
3017917	3018657	I want a pretzel.
3020698	3021078	Thank you.
3021318	3023099	Although, yeah, secretly I'll admit, yeah, it's kind of cool.
3023139	3023559	It's kind of funny.
3025475	3028718	I hope that God didn't leave the window on when I left.
3029239	3031080	No, I closed it.
3031120	3032422	I think I closed it.
3032562	3034504	I used to sit... Otherwise they're going, oh my god.
3035124	3036926	Okay, I'm not even going to say it just in case.
3037427	3042532	I used to sit in chemistry class and play pole position on a graphing calculator.
3043132	3043693	That was cool.
3044133	3048898	I used to sit there and calculus and copy all the formulas that we were supposed to memorize for the test onto the calculator.
3048938	3049959	I had them memorized anyway.
3051368	3055632	To this day, I still remember that a mole is 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.
3056412	3058194	That is astonishing.
3058214	3058194	6.022.
3058794	3059395	Astonishing.
3059575	3059935	Oh, yeah.
3060796	3061837	They've been talking in the chat room.
3061857	3064639	It has come up lately, but when I was in school, we learned it was just 6.02.
3065901	3069784	When we were talking about Flash, Last Revolution, somebody brought up Black Lab Invoke This.
3069824	3074868	He said, Flash ruined the Internet, which kind of goes back to what we were talking about a couple nights ago on the Fuck Off show.
3075329	3076670	What ruined the Internet?
3077030	3078571	Actually, actually, I was just...
3080288	3082030	Pop-up ads ruin the internet, yes.
3082570	3088436	I posted some links actually on our website about stupid knock-off DDR things.
3089056	3097804	Someone actually came up with a full-body DDR thing with motion-captured sensors on his body for DDR.
3099265	3099766	It's called...
3101618	3103721	They're making obscene shapes out of pretzels.
3103761	3104762	They've got boobs and penises.
3104802	3105563	Just ignore them, Loki.
3105603	3105983	Continue.
3106364	3106624	Continue.
3107425	3108166	I don't get it.
3108286	3109628	It's... What?
3111630	3112411	It's a pretzel.
3113853	3114173	Anyway, so...
3115899	3122843	Basically, it's like almost if you cross DDR with, like, say... Actually, it was more like Samba de Amigo.
3124384	3125265	It was very much like that.
3125345	3127606	You know how you have to strike poses and stuff with that?
3128006	3128647	Pretty much like that.
3128667	3130348	You have to match poses, that thing did.
3130388	3134010	So it's like a music game like that that someone is supposed to develop.
3134190	3135651	Also, I read there was another thing.
3136091	3141374	I found that someone's developing a DDR sim for PS2 Linux.
3143055	3143436	Nerd!
3143456	3143576	Nerd!
3146124	3146404	Sorry, Konami.
3174574	3180555	I've been given a flash that we have to play over the internet because it'll make us cool or something like that.
3181155	3189577	It's called Spider-Man, and if this is that Spider-Man's gay thing, I'm going to start punching people randomly in the chat room because that thing's stupid.
3189817	3191058	That's right, you're getting banned.
3192178	3199680	If this is that stupid Spider-Man is gay thing... We're waiting for this to load here.
3202385	3207227	83, 86, 88, 94 Hey, shut up, I'm doing a show here.
3210768	3211549	What the fuck?
3212089	3213309	It's in a foreign language.
3220732	3221433	I hate you.
3222873	3225894	This is the worst flash I've ever seen.
3227815	3229016	Alright, wait, hold on, hold on.
3229256	3229976	That's getting a kick.
3231812	3234434	You know what the best flash was, though, that was along those lines?
3235094	3238937	It was the Mega Man one where he danced to Twinby from 2DX.
3240478	3244300	I just, I kicked EOSFVB for that worst flash ever.
3244620	3246041	That was so funny.
3248643	3250264	Oh, Rob, I actually learned the whole dance now.
3251284	3255107	I know the whole dance, so you'll have to play that intro, or that promo when we come back.
3255287	3256508	Alright, maybe we will, maybe we will.
3256868	3257408	Okay, FUs.
3257949	3259630	Alright, yes, let's do the FUs of the week.
3261063	3262644	Well, do I have FUs today?
3262664	3274710	If you want to join our chatroom, by the way, just head over to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx And then, like, bomb rob with many PMs about what you'd like to fuck.
3275130	3276791	Yes, tell us what you'd like to fuck.
3277051	3278472	I don't know what a fuck it is.
3279492	3281813	I'm going back to the old school schlagwerk this week, just because.
3283814	3285055	I'll have a new song after that, by the way.
3285075	3285775	Ooh, cool.
3286356	3286996	Okay, here we go.
3289028	3291830	Okay, my first FU of the week is Writer's Block.
3293591	3296774	Okay, actually, this sort of links back to my old one about my hard drive.
3297714	3299196	For people who don't know, my hard drive died.
3299376	3300376	I mean, completely died.
3300436	3300977	It broke.
3302404	3331094	and I lost chapter 5 actually I lost every fanfic I'd ever written but really importantly I lost the 5th chapter of the one I'm currently working on I was like 2500 words yeah 2500 words into it which for me that's you know a good bit that's actually a third of the fanfic of the chapter right there because the last few chapters I've written ended up topping over 6000 words a piece Marin's in the chat room right now and says you need to write more
3331872	3334434	Yes, I'm sorry, Maren John.
3335074	3335994	Oh, my bad, Maren.
3336555	3337475	My bad.
3337775	3346581	Who, by the way, for anybody who remembers the DVR Freak moderator strip, she's my friend that I went to lunch with when we were there and hung out with.
3347341	3349702	She got to see me incredibly drunk at Star Trek Experience.
3349722	3349983	Sorry.
3351543	3357427	Anyway, I was really, really pissed off about it and didn't want to write anything for a week or so.
3357947	3359148	And I started writing on it again.
3359648	3360389	And wouldn't you know it...
3361784	3362464	I get started on it.
3362484	3363145	I'm on a roll.
3363725	3365566	Dan's like, hey, you want to go get food?
3365586	3366226	Let's go get food.
3366246	3370809	So I went out and had some lovely French toast, and then came back, and I couldn't write.
3371909	3373450	I really couldn't think of anything.
3373510	3374490	I was like, well, what the hell?
3374510	3377752	The thing is, I had it really dark before.
3377772	3379993	I mean, really, like, disgustingly dark.
3381014	3387197	And I decided to take it a little bit lighter and do the really dark stuff on the last few chapters, and then I just blanked.
3388297	3389698	So, that's that.
3391656	3392217	That's it?
3392557	3392677	Oh.
3393438	3398422	If you go to fanfiction.net, look up DarkSakura, my fanfics there, it's a Digimon fic.
3399183	3399983	Like all my other ones there.
3400003	3401485	And if you read it, leave me reviews.
3402105	3403827	Reviews are special and they make me happy.
3405188	3407650	Yeah, fuck people who don't leave me reviews, because you suck.
3408791	3409292	Um, okay.
3409752	3413355	My other question of the week is, um... Okay.
3413496	3413756	Okay.
3415089	3418110	I can't really blame him for this, but, you know, fuck losing my cable.
3418370	3421690	Because even though I don't watch TV, I occasionally like the option of watching it.
3422391	3423251	So I can see Buffy.
3423391	3423931	Iron Chef.
3425471	3428532	No, we didn't even... I didn't even like watching that.
3428772	3431833	But, um... Well, I liked watching it when I'm with other people, but not by myself.
3432313	3433933	Because all it does is make me want to start cooking.
3435554	3441975	And, um... But what got me is that I wake up and, like... I canceled the cable!
3442890	3443250	Why?
3443891	3444732	Because you don't watch it.
3445072	3445993	How am I going to watch Buffy?
3446013	3447554	Because I get crappy reception without the cable.
3448495	3450997	So I guess I get to download episodes of Buffy.
3451037	3455280	So if anyone watches Buffy, take the episodes for me because I need to see James Foster's apps.
3455320	3457802	Thank you.
3457842	3460465	Oh, by the way, I'm going to go see him next month.
3461045	3462146	Are you going to BuffyCon?
3462686	3463967	It's not a BuffyCon.
3464047	3466790	It's like a sci-fi con, but I'm going to go see my man.
3467951	3469152	Buffy ruined the internet.
3469472	3469932	No!
3470373	3471714	No, pop-ups ruin the internet.
3472571	3474513	We're going to do a list list on what ruined the internet.
3474533	3476034	I think maybe that should be our topic for tonight.
3476835	3477135	Okay.
3477175	3477615	You want to do that?
3477855	3479837	Okay, we're going to do a list list tonight, and that'll be the topic.
3480758	3481859	What ruined the internet?
3482059	3482339	Alright.
3483500	3483820	Okay.
3484501	3487283	Um, but, uh... These things are salty.
3487824	3490206	Fuck these pretzels, but I'll leave it to you.
3491266	3492327	Yeah, that's it.
3493809	3494909	Rob, stop eating your balls.
3496010	3497692	I like my balls, they're big and fluffy.
3499813	3501294	I think we need to go to the next step, you.
3502155	3503136	Loki, let's hear from you.
3505698	3507639	I have no saliva because these pretzels.
3508560	3509461	Neat Zalavex.
3509981	3511362	No French kissing for you!
3513404	3514205	Anyways, ugh.
3516072	3519636	First FU, especially with this weather, has to be stupid drivers.
3520537	3521618	I hate stupid drivers.
3521658	3523539	I hate stupid drivers that try to pull out in front of me.
3523559	3526922	I hate stupid drivers that drive 40 miles under the speed limit.
3528324	3528704	I hate them.
3529225	3529845	They're stupid.
3530466	3535210	Especially this old bitch that was behind yesterday, going down South Watt.
3536111	3538213	She's going 25 miles an hour, there's 20 cars behind her.
3539611	3546277	It's like, fuck you, so I went around her and everyone honked at her and flipped her off and tried to beat her off the road, but that didn't work.
3548399	3551322	Um, I'd up you to dial up email.
3552884	3559750	Fucking A, I have my Turning Mystery thing done and I can't submit it because it's like, no, I want a timeout.
3560270	3560531	Sorry.
3561791	3566273	So, I can't... One way or another, my secret file is coming online tonight.
3566833	3570914	Whether it be in the official judging for Tournament Mix 3 or on my website.
3571074	3572255	One way or another, it's up there.
3573875	3575396	And, yeah.
3576116	3576476	I don't know.
3576536	3581238	I don't have too much to go with right now because I'm happy with pretzels.
3582338	3585019	So, I'll think of something later, I'm sure.
3585379	3585679	Alright.
3586140	3586960	In the meantime, my turn.
3588231	3588571	All right.
3589291	3591272	First of all, F you to the rain.
3591712	3594393	I know it's needed and all, but fuck, I hate driving in it.
3594553	3595113	It's the worst.
3595193	3596833	It makes everybody drive like an ass.
3597573	3599954	And I have this intense fear of hydroplaning.
3599994	3602315	Every time I kick up a puddle, I think I'm going to die.
3602375	3602775	I hate it.
3602855	3603855	I want a hydroplane.
3603895	3604835	I've never done it before.
3604855	3605375	No, it sucks.
3605415	3605936	It's awful.
3605956	3606296	Go to hell.
3606316	3609997	I want a hydroplane, but when no one else is around, so I can do a 720 and keep going.
3611897	3614299	You're a scary man and I hope they never give you a license.
3616040	3620723	My other FU of the week goes to that stupid bitch at Walgreens who didn't know how to use her ATM card thing.
3621063	3621683	Here's a hint.
3622964	3628067	If you don't know how to use your ATM card to pay for your food, you need to fucking just go get cash.
3629235	3629956	and do it that way.
3630056	3633278	God, I hate people that hold up the line because they're retarded.
3634779	3635839	Get a life, you stupid bitch.
3636380	3636680	Okay.
3636800	3636980	Anyway.
3637000	3637540	Yeah, that's it.
3638081	3638341	I think.
3638581	3639722	I don't think I have any other Refuge League.
3639742	3640882	I thought I had other Refuge League.
3641203	3642964	F you to Christmas Carols.
3643084	3643824	I can't get away from them.
3645225	3645545	Okay.
3646626	3647347	Now it's my turn.
3647547	3647987	Yes, it is.
3648848	3650989	And then, first of all...
3652720	3653781	Oh my God, you are so cool.
3653801	3654881	You're playing this song.
3655382	3656262	Shut up and give us your FUs.
3656482	3657563	Okay.
3657863	3664647	My first FU goes to all the people who give me sympathy because my birthday is the day after Christmas.
3664968	3667609	And they say, oh, that sucks because you get all your presents at the same time.
3667649	3668270	Wait a minute.
3668490	3669150	No, you don't.
3669210	3669791	You're a Jew.
3669951	3673213	I know, but they're all like, oh, that sucks so bad because you get all your presents at the same time.
3673233	3674193	I'm like, no, I'm Jewish.
3674313	3675214	This year's weird.
3675274	3677155	They put Hanukkah at a weird time this year.
3677195	3678176	Yeah, it was so early.
3679229	3680430	HANUKA'S LONG OVER
3694978	3699461	Secondly... Oh, Christmas is just that day you don't have to go to school or you get off work randomly.
3699481	3701942	Christmas is fun because it's the day before my birthday.
3703022	3708265	I get to go skiing because everyone else is going fucking eating, you know, turkey and shit.
3708746	3709046	Okay.
3709766	3713788	Anyway, my second nephew goes to my stupid, fat, fucking bitch Spanish teacher.
3714168	3714929	Oh my god.
3715329	3718091	She must weigh, like, 500 pounds.
3718591	3724074	If you've ever seen the movie Hercules, the animated one, like, she looks like the titan
3724834	3727055	Who's the, like, the Earth Titan or whatever?
3727415	3730517	Who's just a giant blob of mush, except the female version.
3730757	3732578	Her ankle is bigger than my neck.
3733218	3733978	I kid you not.
3734679	3740802	And she's so fat, and she speaks in an Italian accent for Spanish, so you can't understand a fucking word.
3741142	3743803	And she's like, okay, kiddos, remember the test today?
3743883	3744463	What test?
3744603	3744824	What?
3744944	3745704	Okay, project?
3745844	3746084	What?
3746204	3747025	And then we all fail.
3747505	3752867	I have a D right now, and that's keeping me from doing shit that I want to do in my mom moment.
3753287	3754328	Okay, I'm done.
3756925	3759146	Alright, let's hear from the chatroom then.
3761687	3763048	First I'm going to open up the email bag.
3763108	3768410	I'm going to open up the email bag because we have some FUs that came over email.
3768530	3771251	We have some late FUs from last week.
3771351	3781355	These come from Muheimer who sent these in last week for last week's show except he must not have been in on Saturday when we were actually taping the show.
3781375	3783056	So he sent these in on Sunday and we weren't here.
3783396	3784677	We were running a tape.
3785957	3790338	He says, as much as he enjoys hearing things that piss Jamie off the whole show, he needs to contribute his own stuff.
3790358	3796140	So fuck non-individualistic people who are too worried what other people will think of them.
3796340	3797040	Fuck, fuck them.
3797820	3801842	Fuck my so-called friends for not going to the movies with me because it was a whole ten minutes out of the way.
3801942	3803282	They have a DDR machine there, yay.
3804182	3807703	So I had to go with only two people instead of who I wanted to go with.
3807803	3814085	Fuck that DDR machine at the movies because it didn't have a good screen quality and it made me look suckier than I really am, which is pretty sucky anyway.
3815083	3818685	Fuck Pierce Brosnan for getting to make Sweet Love Into Halle Berry instead of me.
3820565	3825768	Don't forget that Billy Bob Thornton also got to make Sweet Love Into Halle Berry in that movie, and she was all topless and stuff, too.
3826008	3826648	Monster's Ball.
3827148	3829349	That movie's fucked up, though.
3829669	3833691	I've never seen a movie that made me want to kill myself, but Monster's Ball just makes you want to die.
3834291	3835132	Don't rent it, it's awful.
3838604	3845988	Don't rent the whole movie.
3847628	3848549	Did she show her titties?
3848649	3851570	Did she show her titties to Die Another Day or something?
3852391	3853011	I didn't think so.
3853431	3854191	In Monster's Ball.
3854211	3854832	Yeah, I knew that.
3855872	3859534	I just found a picture of my man and I'm staring at him and ignoring the naked Halle's ball.
3860214	3860494	Oh.
3860554	3861415	Women are pigs.
3861675	3862595	Women are pigs.
3862655	3864636	All you do is sit there and oogle Alan Rickman.
3864696	3865677	Play my fucking music.
3867287	3870611	Fuck you to Halle Berry for ruining the character of Storm in X-Men.
3870671	3871071	Thank you.
3872593	3874696	She fucked up the accent and fucked up the whole movie.
3874716	3876398	Are you saying Halle Berry ruined the internet?
3876878	3878440	No, I'm saying she ruined X-Men.
3878840	3881243	By the way, the trailer is out for X2.
3882945	3885108	It's looking to be good, but the bitch is still in it.
3886029	3887010	So fuck her for existing.
3887944	3890706	Are there snowboarders or extreme sports in that movie?
3891466	3894448	A third one, they can just call it Triple X. Whoa.
3896149	3899090	I was very disappointed that that movie has no porn in it whatsoever.
3899250	3900291	What a misleading title.
3900371	3904974	Triple X, you'd expect booby shot, something like that, but no.
3907853	3915758	I don't know if it's Matt Hoffman or... But whatever that one was, that one was better than Triple X. I mean, fuck Propel.
3915778	3917279	Propel just spit up in my face.
3917959	3922482	It's called BMXXX, and I got a copy for free on Xbox.
3923743	3924483	Well, Dan did.
3928158	3929999	I'm sorry, thanks.
3930019	3931960	I'm going to tell you what ruined X-Men.
3932080	3933980	I'm going to tell you right here what ruined X-Men.
3935381	3937002	On that note, here, this is what ruined X-Men.
3938102	3940523	Do you know what happens when lightning hits a toad?
3941683	3943344	Same thing that happens to everything else.
3944364	3945245	Gosh, he sucks.
3945565	3947886	Who let that get in the script?
3947926	3950627	That was the stupidest thing I've heard in my entire life.
3950667	3952188	Delivered by the stupidest person.
3952408	3952948	God!
3953468	3957350	It was for all the eight-year-old little kids who watch the little TV show.
3957751	3961312	And so they can go and, like, go repeat that line over and over again.
3961513	3962433	Well, fuck kids!
3962633	3965595	They'd be like, no, what happens when lightning hits the toe?
3965815	3967816	Well, um, I don't know.
3968256	3968997	Sounded cool, though.
3970658	3971758	No, it was dumb.
3971778	3972539	That's kind of neat.
3972759	3973019	Anyway.
3973559	3974580	Oh, yes, we still have fuck yous.
3974760	3975681	Yeah.
3975801	3978082	And now we have Mooheimers this week's fuck yous.
3979562	3982226	Fuck my swim coaches for being lazy and dumb and whatnot.
3982606	3986271	Fuck lame projects and fuck the crazy DDR machine that poor Loki couldn't hack.
3986692	3987233	Poor Loki.
3987573	3990397	And he spells Loki L-O-K-I-E, which I think is really cute.
3992063	3996626	Actually, I demand that we start calling you Loki.
3996786	3998707	I got some more stuff out of there.
3998927	4005691	I got all the samples, including the... What's kind of funny is they actually have all the sound samples from all the mixes on the machine.
4006711	4006971	Huh.
4007272	4007832	From all the mixes.
4008072	4010974	Even the DDR second mix battle samples.
4011054	4011614	Dude, I want those.
4011654	4012535	I've got all those.
4012775	4013195	Yeah.
4013335	4014976	So it's like the old announcer and everything?
4015524	4017845	All the old announcers from first all the way up to max two.
4017865	4018625	Even Tin Can Lady?
4019085	4023526	Um, no, no solo stuff, because I say solo is its own breed, but it's, um... Dude, I want those.
4024426	4025486	I've got all the samples for that.
4025506	4025706	That's it.
4025846	4027527	My AOL theme is going to be all DDR.
4029667	4030668	Yes, I still have AOL.
4030728	4031828	Fuck AOL, by the way.
4032968	4034348	You know, fuck this one, AOL.
4034368	4035089	Where's my music?
4037532	4045379	Okay, fuck AOL, because, alright, I'm using 8.0, and I have this neat little Slytherin background, and the logo, the actual Slytherin logo is gone.
4045459	4046440	My background's just grey.
4047161	4047801	So fuck AOL.
4049342	4050423	Can I finish with the chatroom now?
4050584	4050804	No.
4051304	4051604	Okay.
4054387	4055047	Wackwab!
4056309	4059050	says, oh my god, he's got a lot here.
4060671	4062631	FU, fuck finals, I hate finals.
4062731	4067773	Fuck the rain for starting on Friday instead of Saturday because I had to ride my bike in the rain to both my finals on Friday.
4068234	4072235	Fuck the owner of Tap Express for not unlocking the Max 2 machine after it was installed.
4072295	4073235	God knows why he didn't do it.
4073756	4075556	Fuck the 49ers for not winning today.
4075696	4076437	Fuck allergies.
4076497	4077117	Just fuck them.
4077317	4080218	I missed all my classes this week before finals because I was sick.
4080678	4081679	And fuck Hugh Grant.
4082099	4085520	He needs to die so I can move up one rung on my girlfriend's ladder of love.
4088103	4090925	Wait a minute, why aren't you number one on your girlfriend's ladder of love?
4090985	4093126	That's fucked up right there.
4093767	4094467	He's hot.
4095468	4097989	Why is there a ladder that you need to move up rungs on?
4098069	4100671	I mean, if you're not one... You need a promotion?
4101191	4104453	If you're not one, then you should at least be number two or three, I'm thinking.
4105114	4107815	I mean, you sound like you're number 18 or 19 right now.
4110999	4111299	All right.
4111880	4118328	We're going to get our butt kicked by Black Lab in about five seconds as soon as the buffer gets to them.
4118548	4119068	You know what?
4119949	4121812	I have another actress I'd like to say fuck you to.
4122593	4122993	All righty.
4123634	4124294	Linda Fiorentino.
4128228	4130130	That part was written for Alanis.
4130670	4131771	And Alanis declined it.
4131891	4134352	But then came back and said, no, I guess I'll be in the movie.
4134833	4137655	And Kevin Smith said, oh, well, I have a better part for you anyway.
4137855	4138675	So that's why she's gone.
4138695	4141077	Do you think Garofalo should have had it?
4141197	4142218	Who, God?
4142238	4142658	No.
4142678	4143458	Oh, that would have been cool.
4143478	4144479	I think Garofalo should have had it.
4144499	4145320	Oh, that would have been cool.
4145360	4147421	And they actually went back and said they should have given it to her.
4149703	4150883	But no, Linda Fiorentino.
4150903	4152544	Keep going with Chet Room.
4152604	4152885	Okay, yes.
4152905	4153325	Chet Room.
4153525	4154686	They can use my music if they want to.
4155785	4156665	Moving on to Twin.
4157965	4159726	Fuck us for dissing Feet of Fury.
4160566	4161626	He wants to fuck the ferret.
4161646	4162686	Feet of Fury sucks.
4163266	4164467	He wants to fuck a tree.
4164827	4166087	He wants to fuck anything here.
4166707	4168347	Fuck not owning an ignition pad.
4169007	4170548	Fuck not playing his promo.
4171028	4172968	Fuck Christmas for being too far away.
4173768	4177609	And fuck Twin for ruining the internet and MIRC.
4177649	4178169	Well, that's cool.
4178309	4178849	Amen to that.
4178969	4183050	And he would like to point out that Halle Berry's tits are shown for 10 seconds in Swordfish.
4183930	4186132	And what glorious ten seconds they were.
4187293	4188373	Actually, only like three and a half.
4188393	4189654	And this is for people who can't get laid.
4190015	4192516	Actually, only like four or five.
4192997	4193757	Maybe six.
4194297	4194678	Maybe.
4195819	4197580	It's just like, I'm reading a book.
4198160	4199921	Whoa, I don't have clothes on.
4199941	4203944	That was kind of like, what's her name in the Thomas Crown Affair?
4203984	4208988	She's kind of an older lady, but she's still, you know, considering her age, she still has some very nice looking titties.
4209895	4211677	It's like that old chick in the beach.
4213038	4215740	I don't watch Leonardo DiCaprio movies.
4217321	4218242	Alright, moving on.
4219102	4219843	I have Propel.
4220263	4220764	It's tasty.
4221484	4228630	SoCalKicks says, fuck you to Owen and Mike for both cancelling on me this weekend, resulting in shit getting done on SoCalKicks.
4229571	4231592	Well, wait, isn't that a good thing if you get work done?
4232393	4233734	I think he meant like jack shit.
4233754	4234735	You confused me, sir.
4234915	4236056	Oh, resulting in jack shit?
4236076	4237457	Well, he said resulting in shit.
4239063	4240444	Give me that in the negative fashion.
4240504	4241024	Yeah, we'll see.
4241064	4242945	I'm sure we will get a clarification.
4243005	4245186	Dave's head's on the floor and I can totally kick him in the head now.
4245286	4245587	Cool.
4245967	4247588	DCB says, F you to the rain.
4248708	4252410	And he wants me to hold off playing some originals towards the end of the show.
4252430	4252810	That's funny.
4254391	4256113	And by the way, to your last thing, the answer is no.
4276963	4277544	Not just no, but hell no.
4277564	4279265	When you decide, let me know and I'll still tell you no.
4279285	4279926	Here, here!
4304893	4307834	I haven't seen her in the chat room in a long time.
4307874	4311876	She's always idling and then somehow gets disconnected.
4312056	4316718	And F you to the fact that they tried to contact you multiple times after you've broken up, asking to get back together with you.
4322220	4327323	I'm just laughing because Black Lab's telling off Twen in the chat room, going, please, go get laid, please.
4329664	4329964	Again?
4331465	4332585	This is like a daily occurrence.
4332885	4333165	Anyway.
4335246	4337386	Oh, by the way, Stresa says it's okay.
4337826	4340247	He cries and you laughing is cool.
4340607	4341947	Oh yeah, I have another F you.
4342187	4342988	I just remembered now.
4343088	4344628	No, I just think that Dan would kick his ass.
4346568	4347969	I have an F you to my camera.
4348169	4349229	The camera I just bought.
4349729	4352029	Because all the pictures it takes are way too dark.
4352310	4352610	That's it.
4352630	4354910	I didn't even have time to change the music.
4356450	4358611	Maybe we should give you a flashlight to carry around with it.
4359116	4359617	It doesn't matter.
4359657	4361980	You can have the sun behind you and it wouldn't matter.
4362420	4364002	I still got a million FUs to get through here.
4364703	4367246	Brack2000 says, FlashFlash... Oh, whoops.
4367607	4370210	That was another FU for... That was a hint for earlier in the show.
4370590	4373514	FU to EOSFVB for making him hear the catch-up song.
4373594	4373975	And he cried.
4376315	4377896	I thought my ears were going to bleed.
4377996	4383580	The background song, by the way, is Cheer Train from 2DX7Style, for those that were inquiring.
4384000	4388403	23rd Magus says, F you to Skrull for delaying his work on his Tournament Mix entry.
4388904	4389924	It was a good one, too.
4390044	4391405	Invasion of the Gabba Robots.
4391505	4392086	All your base.
4392686	4393707	I'm sure that would have been beautiful.
4394107	4396168	I should put a page on my website.
4396268	4402072	It's the Tournament Mix 3 entries that would have been in there, but we got lazy and didn't finish it in time.
4402092	4403273	Oh, I could put mine in there, too.
4403894	4405835	Because I never finish mine, either.
4406916	4411379	Blah, I also have an FU to my menu script for not working with Mozilla, which is the browser of the gods.
4411660	4412020	Here, here.
4412741	4414662	Fuck Skrull and fuck bad Javascripts.
4415203	4418926	Fuck Mother Nature, you do not make me walk home four blocks in horizontal rain, bitch.
4421391	4427695	EOSFVB says, fuck you to Dave, he didn't get anything for the Mystical Rob Epic Quest, so he at least deserves an FU.
4428435	4428935	Um, what?
4430516	4431497	I have no idea what they're talking about.
4431517	4433578	I have no fucking idea what he's talking about.
4433638	4435819	What the hell are you talking about?
4436340	4446566	Uh, fuck you to Bobby Flay for crying like a bitch to get his rematch against Morimoto and then winning a couple years ago.
4446586	4448727	Dude, that was such bullshit.
4449067	4450608	Okay, he got up, he like,
4451124	4453264	He stood up on his little chopping board.
4453284	4455145	He's like, yeah, I'm gonna win.
4455185	4456365	And then he got his ass beat.
4456725	4457826	And then he all came back.
4458386	4460806	Morimoto's like, no, he doesn't deserve to win.
4460846	4464227	He disgraces himself as a chef because he stands on his equipment.
4464267	4465047	He can still do that.
4465527	4466527	And then he gets back later.
4466587	4467468	They go to Japan.
4468168	4470908	And he takes off the chopping board.
4471188	4471989	And he puts it aside.
4472029	4473249	And then he stands on the table.
4473769	4476230	And it's like, okay, you're still a jackass.
4476670	4477630	You're just an idiot.
4478050	4480813	And then, I don't know, they said that he won, but that was such bullshit.
4481013	4482795	They must have rigged some shit.
4483696	4485417	Because Morimoto is the king.
4485758	4486198	Oh, I see.
4486278	4487900	Okay, EOSFVB clarified here.
4488460	4497329	He's saying, when I left somewhere, and I brought back stuff for everybody except for Dave, that means you deserve an FU, because you must have done something to not get anything.
4497349	4502254	Um... No...
4504762	4506424	We have to finish.
4506664	4506884	Alright.
4507565	4509687	This segment always runs way too long, but oh well.
4510028	4511049	We're just angsty.
4511089	4514472	The DDR community and Bomani community in general is just angsty little people.
4516735	4523642	F you to Starbucks on Broadway for being so slow, says SkylineDC505, and it said it made them late to zero period.
4524563	4525864	That'll teach you to go to Starbucks.
4529496	4533439	Midpower says, F you to Sleep, because his sleeping schedule is all screwed up.
4533579	4537782	F you to his floppy drive, since he has to run in safe mode whenever he wants to put a file on a floppy disk.
4538723	4548229	And also F you to Hugh Grant, because the pig... Oh, I'm sorry, I thought he said Hugh Grant, but he's just saying F you to Hugh, the pig in his Animal Crossing game.
4549390	4551793	Because he magically changed his roof color to yellow.
4552254	4554997	And it's been red since he started his game and now it's fucking yellow.
4555658	4561344	And also an FU to EOSFVB since he said an FU to VidPower last week when VidPower wasn't here.
4561404	4561705	So ha!
4565754	4567815	Yeah, I had two people paint my roof in my town.
4567835	4568876	That pissed me the fuck off.
4568896	4570857	Dude, they painted mine Pepto-Bismol pink.
4571178	4571258	Ew.
4571278	4571778	I hate Ed.
4571958	4574039	Olivia painted mine like baby boy blue.
4574380	4574880	Bitch.
4574980	4576201	Send Olivia back to my village.
4576281	4576981	You can take her.
4577262	4579583	Put her in a big burlap bag and take her back.
4580003	4581064	I don't want her back.
4581164	4582325	We got our lesbian back, though.
4582725	4583186	That's cool.
4583226	4583786	We got Dina.
4584407	4585569	Anyway, back to the fuckies.
4585969	4586730	Yes, back to the fuckies.
4587611	4590855	Um, Muhimer says, oh, he would like to apologize.
4590875	4595301	With the whole Loki thing, he figured out Loki was just L-O-K-I instead of L-O-K-I-E.
4595681	4596602	That was like two hours ago.
4596622	4597363	He was like, what the fuck?
4597383	4598064	He says, sorry.
4598585	4600647	Do we all get paid for this little show?
4601528	4606091	Oh, that's a good... Oh, God, my side hurts.
4606111	4606511	That was good.
4606831	4607291	No, we don't.
4608092	4609232	In fact, we pay to do it.
4609372	4610293	That's the sad part.
4610613	4611854	Send your checks.
4612174	4615936	Yeah, if you want to pay us.
4615956	4617477	Send it, you know, to me.
4617817	4622219	No, the best way you could pay us is to whore this station out to all your friends and listen all the time.
4622459	4623540	We need to break our limit.
4623660	4624660	Yeah, we need to break our limit.
4624700	4625901	I wanted to get... Is that a limit breaker?
4628922	4629662	Jamie is loose.
4630782	4632243	Just kidding.
4632443	4636484	They're offering... They said we should set up a PayPal account.
4636504	4639025	Well, we didn't do that because we don't think people would actually donate to that.
4639065	4644127	Well, if you want to pay me, it would be NightmareHunter at Yahoo.com.
4644187	4647588	I have a PayPal account set up to send money, and I'll be appreciative.
4647608	4650089	That was immediately followed by PayPal ruined the internet.
4652006	4654268	PayPal ruined my bank account when I had PayPal.
4654748	4659691	Because we were like, oh, let's buy Neo Geo cartridges at $300 a piece.
4660091	4661052	We can pay with PayPal.
4661112	4662352	It's easy and convenient.
4663853	4666475	However, it did facilitate me getting Mega Man X4 on Saturn.
4666615	4667816	Or Rockman X4.
4669035	4670735	Best way you could show us some lovin'.
4671576	4673316	Get all your friends to listen to the station.
4673536	4674356	And take us out for dinner.
4674476	4675117	And take us out for dinner.
4675577	4685799	And also, if you want to go to live365.com and play around on their website, what you can do, you can set Orange Lounge Radio to your very favorite radio station.
4686259	4690160	And if enough people do that, then we start getting discounts from Live365.
4690280	4696822	So if you want to kind of inadvertently give us money without giving us money, go set Orange Lounge Radio as your favorite station on Live365.
4696862	4698062	Just go into your presets.
4698482	4703510	You just have to add Orange Lounge Radio as a preset and then you're going to say which one of your presets do you want to make your favorite station.
4703931	4706755	Select Orange Lounge Radio and we're all happy campers.
4707516	4708718	And I also do appearances.
4708858	4711683	I don't charge that much by hour, so look me up.
4713982	4721024	Yes, that's great if Orange Lounge Radio is already in your presets, but if you want to make it your favorite preset, that's even better.
4721884	4722745	And we love you lots for that.
4722765	4723145	And it helps us.
4723605	4723965	That's right.
4724345	4725125	Helps us pay bills.
4725506	4732988	See, I don't need to do that because I just have a link or a shortcut to my desktop, so I don't even need to go on there.
4733949	4737033	I realized that most people don't do that.
4737373	4738134	But do it anyway.
4738174	4739536	If you want to make us happy, do it anyway.
4739576	4740957	Go to the website for once.
4742199	4743020	Get a free account.
4744502	4747766	Use a fake email address or whatever so all the spam goes there.
4748186	4748447	And then...
4749768	4752872	You know, tell them that you love Orange Lounge Radio more than anything.
4753913	4754214	Alright.
4754534	4759560	It sucks having a screen name for like eight years because I get so much junk mail on it now.
4760401	4763025	On my DarkSakura thing.
4763065	4763846	By the way... Yes?
4763866	4764046	Yes?
4765413	4771655	You know, I have to say something that I'm going to actually retract one of my old FUs.
4772216	4772376	Oh!
4773196	4773336	Oh!
4773796	4775957	Jamie is going to retract an old FU, so what do I do?
4775977	4777498	Do I play Sligwork backwards?
4777538	4778498	Do I play a happy song?
4778518	4779158	What do I play?
4779579	4779799	Okay.
4781239	4785321	Another FU to Pepsi and pretzels because I feel like I'm going to explode.
4786283	4787263	Dude, cool, do it.
4788604	4790504	No, play something happy.
4790644	4791725	Play something happy.
4792025	4794345	Play the Changma song.
4795286	4796106	The Changma song?
4796246	4796546	Yeah.
4797926	4799927	You know what, I don't think I have Changma queued up.
4799967	4800427	I'm sorry.
4802328	4805489	How about we can play... We're playing old.
4805989	4806149	Old?
4806349	4806669	Boys?
4807209	4807589	No.
4807609	4808210	Boom Boom Dollar?
4808810	4809470	My Fire?
4809510	4810150	Bad Girls?
4810250	4810550	Let's Get Down.
4810610	4811010	Let's Get Down.
4811030	4811991	Okay, this is a happy song.
4812371	4812631	Alright.
4814941	4841808	I'm retracting my FU about the people who send me instant messages because now I couldn't hop on my DJ Celica I'm going to go ahead and say it I have a username now I'm not going to give the full one out but it's primarily DJ Celica that's one of my AIM names that is not the full AIM name by the way because I'm not going to say the whole thing on the air I would sign on that and get no less than 17 IMs in one sitting
4842828	4845309	You should have seen it during the time that Shaft was going on.
4845710	4849852	Because I counted it during my first five minutes of being online without an away message.
4850292	4851252	I had 30 IMs.
4851813	4851252	30.
4853113	4854714	13.
4854134	4854714	I counted them.
4854794	4855514	You're so popular.
4856435	4862458	So, I'm actually happy to say that I was on my name for a little while yesterday.
4863018	4865579	I had the thing on for 10 minutes without an away message.
4866020	4867841	And I didn't get a single message.
4867881	4868681	So, thank you.
4869862	4870322	However...
4871511	4875538	One of my other, my AOL name that used to go on all the time.
4876339	4877080	That one's gotten better.
4877120	4881828	There's people who are not randomly IMing me when I haven't given them the permission to IM me.
4882643	4907342	and although I have to say I took one of my names off of hiding and lo and behold even after 8 years I'm still getting like 20 million messages on that name so I put it back on hiding so I'm going to go and be more specific with who I see that way and the people by the way who I don't mind messaging me you know who you are and I never care
4908346	4914248	But for all those random people who, like, I barely know or maybe see, like, you know, once.
4914488	4916409	I've seen you at, like, a tournament or something.
4916949	4920670	Or I haven't known you for longer than at least two years, you know.
4921230	4925672	You know, give me a few minutes to sit on line and just be here for a while.
4926352	4929853	Before you decide, oh my god, I have to talk to Jamie right now!
4931374	4932454	Unless your house is burning.
4932814	4934695	Unless your house is burning and then call a fire department.
4937349	4938511	I am your fire department.
4939032	4940756	I ain't your fire department, I'm sorry.
4943342	4943623	Alright.
4944210	4952074	I accept IMs, but unfortunately I'm... Well, anyways, my AOL Instant Messenger thing is SacramentoLoki0.
4953115	4956957	So if you happen to be on there, go ahead and IM me.
4957277	4958317	Oh, wait, I'm never on there.
4958357	4960018	Yeah, I know, that's what I do.
4960058	4961459	I just don't use Instant Messenger.
4962279	4965801	Speaking of things online, though, I actually, if we're done with RFUs of the week... Yeah.
4966221	4967582	Okay, I actually have an announcement.
4968162	4969643	Announcement, announcement, announcement.
4969703	4970444	I made this announcement.
4970464	4973265	A horrible way to die, a horrible way to die, a horrible way to die.
4975034	4975955	Rob, I'm going to hit you with a ferret.
4977215	4977335	Ow!
4980257	4980557	Anyway.
4981618	4985280	I want a pretzel.
4987401	4988301	I got a pretzel smush, haha.
4988662	4997947	Anyway, this announcement, I don't know if anyone remembers me mentioning the thing based off a radio drama based off of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.
4999648	5001671	There's one position left open.
5001711	5004774	We need your audition reel.
5005895	5012523	So the position left open, if I remember correctly, is the drunken zombie date.
5013684	5014585	DarkSakura at AOL.com
5034148	5038751	That which is, by the way, the name that's hidden from anybody ever knowing that I'm online.
5039191	5039752	So go ahead.
5040072	5042233	You can buddy list that all you want to because you'll never see it.
5043734	5051359	But go ahead and email me your voice acting reel, your audition to DarkSakura at AOL.com.
5051559	5052519	What kind of voice would that be?
5052560	5054381	Is it a whiny goth boy voice?
5054481	5055601	Drunken zombie date.
5055701	5056442	Drunken zombie date.
5056462	5056882	I think it's drunk.
5056902	5057142	I don't know.
5057182	5057423	All right.
5057443	5059784	So you have to be a drunken zombie.
5061705	5062306	Very good.
5062366	5062766	Very good.
5063473	5064793	And where's your audition reel?
5064833	5065653	You said you were interested.
5065673	5067734	Ugh, I got lazy.
5071174	5073255	Just send them to me.
5073555	5080956	But we're hoping to get underway with the recording soon, and it will be broadcast on this very radio station once we get a first episode out.
5081916	5083837	And give that email address out one more time.
5084217	5086817	DarkSakura at ALL.com Beautiful.
5087237	5090338	Which is funny, because I had that name before there was a Dark Sakura.
5091358	5091518	Cool.
5092148	5093489	DarkSakura
5118518	5119480	Yeah, that's because I'm neat.
5119701	5124192	So that's the whole history of why I have that name now, but send me auditions.
5125069	5130651	All right, we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back and do the cage match for this week.
5130671	5131031	Uh-oh.
5131071	5133692	Because we didn't do a cage match last week, so we're going to do tonight's cage match.
5134372	5136753	And then we'll do some more fun stuff.
5136773	5141195	We've got a list list to get to at some point tonight, so we'll do all that in a little bit.
5141215	5144396	This will be a short break, because we're going to be doing more music during the cage match.
5145156	5148057	But we just want to get up and stretch and pee.
5148217	5148798	And eat pretzels.
5149058	5149598	And eat pretzels.
5150778	5151419	All right, we'll be back.
5151699	5151959	See you.
5152079	5152559	Orange on Radio.
5215976	5217858	DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5255770	5283947	He knew that his heart was feeling He'd been hurt too much to try again But when she caught his eye Ain't no man could fight the feeling He knew he had to try to let go of it Mother let him know She was in the mood for talking So when he began to play the game Before he knew it He had told her how much he'd been hurting How he was hoping she was not the same Would you see the kinds of ladies that are
5290687	5295429	Don't have to look no more, I'll give the love you need, Do you holler enough?
5295449	5296390	Guaranteed!
5296490	5301452	I'm like a red boy, I'm a fine lady, You've been hurt, but see, so what?

5309855	5311276	You've been hurt, but see, so what?
5311356	5313317	I am the cure, And when you wake up late,
5498035	5499856	So, you think this is the end?
5500776	5502296	No, it's not the end.
5502537	5504677	It's the beginning of your next journey.
5505077	5509199	The Good Pool Journey Part 2.
5519202	5522503	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
5523023	5523804	Orange Lounge Radio.
5526881	5527922	Dave's doing the dance.
5530345	5531226	Dave is doing the dance.
5531246	5533269	Wait, I've got to play that one more time just so Dave can do the dance.
5535872	5538335	Okay, here we go, here we go.
5539376	5542640	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
5543200	5544762	Orange Lounge Radio.
5546116	5548819	That's the best part, because that looks like Ricky Martin right there.
5548839	5552983	It's like he's doing the Latino pata pata.
5554404	5558929	Later on, even though you can't see it, I'm just going to do it anyway, so screw you.
5558969	5560110	You can't even see what I'm doing.
5560350	5561431	Oh, I like that.
5561512	5563313	EOSFBB, Spider-Man does the dance.
5563934	5567257	That looks stupid, though.
5567397	5569600	Later on, all the girls go like this.
5570360	5574882	I'm pretty much good in C. He just shook his hips in rhythm.
5575762	5577722	Hey, Loki's having problems here.
5577743	5578163	What's going on?
5578723	5580603	Loki's flipping off my roommate's computer.
5580643	5581444	What's your problem?
5583084	5583865	Net zero.
5583925	5585185	Do you want me to submit it for you?
5585725	5586885	Oh, okay, Jamie's going to do it.
5586946	5589166	We're trying to submit Loki.
5589246	5589986	Oh, I just burped.
5590087	5590627	That was gross.
5590947	5591147	Burp.
5591747	5594209	We're trying to submit Loki's Tourney Mix 3 entry right now.
5594229	5599393	Continue to FU to net zero because they suck ass and their servers are slow as ass.
5600654	5602616	I'm going to use ass as an adjective for now.
5604741	5605262	All right, that's it.
5605542	5606383	Everybody's having issues.
5606823	5607184	Okay.
5608545	5613951	I suppose this is the portion of the show where we should get into another little thing that we do here every week.
5614892	5617835	And that is... Let me clear my throat.
5617875	5620978	No, it is the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
5621018	5621338	Everybody...
5622672	5629855	Last week in the cage match, actually two weeks ago, we didn't do it last week, because we did a pre-tape show.
5630655	5637218	So last week's winner of the cage match, a couple weeks ago, was... I'm trying to find it, I can't find it.
5637898	5639339	It was the Knight Rider theme.
5640579	5641900	I love the chair, it's so beautiful
5686587	5688708	Thank you for watching!
5702338	5704959	The Knight Rider theme, done all, redone.
5705119	5705900	I have one more F you.
5706840	5707361	Yes, Dave.
5708001	5708701	You're a little late.
5709262	5709902	I know, I know.
5710282	5710942	I forgot about it.
5711062	5713464	I had thought about it, like, on Wednesday.
5713484	5715125	I was like, damn, I need to, okay.
5716125	5717846	I got kicked out of Jamie's chair.
5718650	5720112	Technically, it's Brian's chair, but I claim it.
5720953	5721173	Yep.
5722255	5723897	You don't have to get music or whatever.
5723917	5726240	No, I'm queuing up the first contender.
5726641	5727682	So good, I'm wasting time.
5728123	5736413	Okay, F you to all the people who think that everyone who goes to the gym is just compensating for a small penis, because that's not true.
5738479	5739640	Where does that come from?
5740000	5741521	Because I like going to the gym.
5742021	5742922	Because I am weak.
5743743	5749927	But lots of people who don't go to the gym, it's like, oh, you stupid people just go to the gym because you have penis envy or whatever.
5751368	5753169	Rob's looking at me like a madman.
5754250	5755170	I'm just confused.
5755330	5757192	I don't like the gym, but I don't think it's a penis thing.
5768969	5775395	I don't think you would get a date, especially if they saw you doing your little ketchup chicken dance.
5779580	5782002	Sorry about this, I'm trying to find a particular part of this song.
5784019	5785740	No, don't pose, please, don't pose.
5786360	5786700	Okay.
5788962	5789782	Posing is fun.
5790643	5791323	Anyway, yes.
5793064	5799487	The cage match, the way the cage match works, we're going to play two new songs for you that are contenders for the title of the cage match champion.
5799967	5806551	You can vote for either one of the two new songs, or you can vote for last week's winner, the Knight Rider theme that we just played for you.
5807011	5812214	And the winning song will be put into rotation all week long on our Bimani Music and More program, which plays...
5813214	5815435	All the time on this station when we're not live.
5815835	5819477	So you can vote for the Knight Rider theme or you can vote for this one, the first contender.
5820037	5822478	This is a band that I've fucking fallen in love with lately.
5822538	5823458	I love this band.
5823478	5826920	They're a band called Frow Frow and this song is called Breathe In.
5826940	5827900	Don't laugh, it's cool.
5828020	5828501	They're cool.
5828681	5829601	Frow Frow.
5830001	5831162	Frow Frow rules.
5831282	5831862	And this song...
5832182	5834203	Breathe In The Beginning of a Song by Bush
5860090	5888369	Breathe In, Breathe Out, Breathe In, Gotta Mushy Head Okay, okay, here we go This is the first contender, you can vote for it But we will not accept any votes until both songs have completely played So you can vote for either the Knight Rider theme or you can vote for this This is Frow Frow with the DJ Encore mix of Breathe In here on Orange Lounge Radio I'm sorry, that's not where it's supposed to start It's supposed to start right in here Here we go This is it, Frow Frow
5897667	5899633	I need you.
5900656	5901719	God, I'm good at it.
5902301	5903123	I'm so spotted.
6009474	6010815	Thanks for watching!
6169213	6174099	Alright, that was Frow Frow with the DJ Encore remix of Breathe In in the cage match.
6174620	6179165	So, next question we gotta ask is, what did you guys think of that one?
6180246	6181327	Well... Dave?
6182028	6184131	I thought that it was pretty good, but...
6184671	6187612	It was kind of long, I mean, almost.
6188453	6190294	It is six minutes, but I cut out the first minute.
6190474	6190754	I know.
6190774	6191514	That's why I started a little there.
6191554	6204040	I mean, it's still a little long, but I really think that it would go much better without the lyrics, because they just kind of brought it down and made it sound corny, in my opinion.
6204800	6205560	All right, that's fine.
6206461	6207461	Jamie, what did you think of Prowl Prowl?
6207701	6209962	It reminded me of Forest.
6211243	6211543	Cool.
6211563	6212564	I wanted to take a nap.
6212584	6213404	Cool.
6214286	6215627	Loki, what'd you think of Frow Frow?
6216208	6217489	Uh, the voice was annoying.
6218570	6220091	Hey, I love Imogen Heath, she rules.
6220151	6220812	Inya does dance.
6221012	6221613	She's not Inya!
6222273	6225136	I had to go to the bathroom during it, so I thought I had to be Inya.
6225697	6226818	And of course, I loved it.
6226878	6228459	Love, love, loved it, because I love Frow Frow.
6228639	6229380	Alright, scale of 1 to 10.
6230061	6230341	Jamie?
6230361	6230341	6.
6232563	6233243	Matt, Loki?
6233444	6233864	I'll go for 6.
6234685	6234985	Dave?
6235846	6234985	7.
6236466	6237828	I give it a 10, it's perfect.
6239389	6239749	D.Va.
6239769	6240050	Alright.
6241920	6245642	This is another overclocked remix done by Final Fantasy Music DJ
6259128	6267679	Now, okay, I have to warn you guys, it does have a really strange intro and ending to it, just because this is a birthday gift to someone.
6268200	6273887	So, it'll get into the song, but just don't be thrown off by the annoying voices in the very beginning of it.
6274328	6277252	But it's an awesome remix of the Airship theme from Final Fantasy VII.
6277745	6278746	Alright, so here it is.
6278886	6280207	Another Final Fantasy remix.
6280267	6282828	We had one win the cage match about three weeks ago, and here's another one.
6283328	6286570	This is the remix of the Airship theme from... Who does this?
6286670	6288151	Oh, it's the same guy who did the other one.
6288632	6290393	So it's the FF Music DJ, I'm sorry.
6291273	6293054	I was only half paying attention because I was trying to queue it up.
6293494	6294095	Alright, here we go.
6299018	6300619	It's spinning the CD and going.
6300679	6301059	Here we go.
6302820	6303760	Hey, boy!
6304801	6306142	Happy birthday!
6307119	6307839	Guess what?
6308499	6309940	I made you a remix!
6310880	6312681	Of Sam's theme!
6313521	6323303	Let me sing it for you!
6330605	6332866	Sounds like someone's, like, pleasuring themselves.
6334590	6335633	Thank you for watching!
6405257	6405817	Thanks for watching!
6433713	6434457	Thanks for watching!
6526914	6527755	Thank you for watching!
6597940	6599101	All righty, that was it.
6599141	6605404	That was the FF Music DJ with the Final Fantasy VII Airship theme remix.
6605464	6607245	It's got a little funky name to it here.
6607285	6609906	It's Otan Jubi.
6611487	6612447	That's the real name of it.
6612927	6615068	But that's your other entrant in the cage match.
6615108	6616089	So vote now.
6616169	6617749	Just send me a private message in the chat room.
6618190	6621191	You can vote for... Oh yeah, sorry, we can do our opinions too.
6621591	6622031	My bad.
6623092	6624773	Dave said he liked it and gives it a 9.
6626611	6627784	I'd say I like it and give it a 9.
6630703	6633245	I liked it, so I give it a 9 too, I guess.
6634186	6637509	I liked it, but not as much as Frow Frow, but I gave Frow Frow a 10, so I can give that a 9.
6637569	6641793	So we all gave that a 9.
6642613	6642994	Pretty good.
6644135	6646356	Alright, so, oh, did your entry get in?
6646517	6652482	I'd like to announce that my entry has actually finally attached itself to the mail, and we are pushing send right now.
6653142	6653963	Watch it bounce.
6654123	6654904	Watch it bounce.

6682085	6687911	Please vote next week for the name of the game, Hybrid LA Blackout Remix.
6688352	6694117	We'll talk more about whoring out your Tourney Mix 3 entries for Orange Lounge listeners next week when they're all in.
6694858	6696140	Okay, so the votes are coming in.
6696180	6697981	We will tally those up during the next break.
6698082	6698502	Thank you.
6699063	6699843	Keep sending those to me.
6699863	6703087	You can send those over vote in the chat room or you can send them to our email bag.
6703627	6708549	OrangeLoungeRadio.com And you can send us just about anything to the Orange Lounge Radio email bag.
6708569	6717954	You can send us love letters, marriage proposals, comments, questions, hate mail, flame wars, whatever you want to send to OrangeLoungeRadio.com We love getting mail, don't we all?
6718599	6719239	Um, no.
6719640	6720820	Because I get nothing but spam.
6721200	6722161	Well, don't, yeah, don't send spam.
6722181	6722881	I like good mail.
6722901	6724642	If you send spam, fuck you.
6724802	6725202	Send money.
6725442	6725722	Alright.
6726703	6728624	Oh, we had somebody vote for the Animal Crossing theme.
6728644	6733526	That's not one of your choices in today's... Maybe next week's Cage Match, but not tonight.
6733546	6735007	Maybe we should play that once more tonight.
6735047	6736707	We have another Animal Crossing song.
6736947	6737308	We can do that.
6737328	6739188	We'll close... Oh, okay.
6739589	6740729	We'll save it for later.
6741109	6744251	Do Animal Crossing music Cage Match.
6744391	6745091	Dude, K.K.
6745131	6746772	Cospo would win, because that's my favorite.
6747853	6749395	No, it's all about Lucky KK.
6749835	6752097	You know, Riverdance and Animal Crossing.
6754379	6758083	SkylineDC505 says, isn't it too late to enter TourneyMix 3?
6759384	6762627	No, I just missed the deadline by a half an hour.
6762667	6763508	You mean you got the deadline?
6763528	6764930	I got the deadline by just a half an hour.
6765150	6765830	So, half an hour.
6767572	6768413	Very good, very good.
6768433	6772417	So what kind of things were you considering when you made your DWI?
6773086	6774406	What kind of things was considered?
6774546	6775186	What went into it?
6775226	6776427	How did you pick the song?
6776487	6778007	How did you design the steps?
6778347	6779907	How did you do the background?
6780168	6783088	Okay, the song I picked actually was my second choice.
6783368	6787229	Because I had a first choice, which is Alien World from 8Style.
6787829	6789130	I still have that halfway done.
6789350	6791190	I just decided, no, I like the song better.
6791550	6792510	So I picked that song.
6792930	6799932	It's a bit succinct because the second part of the song... The whole song kind of slows down as it's going through gradually, but...
6800852	6810538	I had to edit it down, and the second half of the song, or second third of the song, last third of the song, there we go, is 128.036 BPM.
6811878	6812519	It's exact.
6812639	6823065	The problem is, though, is Stepmania and DWI don't do three digit BPMs, at least not without editing the file itself.
6823525	6830729	So I finally got it synced, except there's like one step that's not synced, which I don't really give a crap, because it's one step and no one's going to notice.
6831149	6834871	It's off by like 1 64th of a note, so I really don't care.
6835393	6841698	But, um, the background took me, uh, maybe 10, 15 minutes to do.
6842098	6843700	I did it all in Photoshop, looks pretty.
6844641	6848744	And, um, the steps I finished just before I got here for the show.
6848864	6850926	I finished the heavy step stairs.
6851246	6857671	A part in it where it's, it goes kind of, it's, I think it starts off at like 135, goes down to this, oh wait, what is it?
6857691	6859673	It's, um, one...
6861314	6865357	I don't remember, it goes down to half speed in the middle, and then it comes back up to 128.
6866558	6873903	And during the half speed part, there's a 30 second note thing going on there, so it's kind of hard to read, but it's all synced.
6875083	6877005	And, I don't know, they're pretty fun.
6877345	6881548	It kind of plays like Era, but a little bit more complicated.
6881848	6883309	So, just try it out.
6883949	6884350	It'll be fun.
6884370	6886311	That's about it.
6886923	6887243	Word.
6887964	6896029	What do you think are going to be the big sim files to watch out for, the big artists, or the big creators out there that are going to have some good stuff?
6896129	6910579	Well, I don't think BimaniRuler is putting anything in this time, so they'll probably just have CMCM do something, then KamenKey makes a lot of stuff, VitaX, whatever, does a lot of stuff.
6911658	6912178	I don't really know.
6912218	6913438	There's a lot of people that know.
6913679	6917339	Or DDR Master F, you know, might see something from him.
6917460	6918700	Moogle Hunter, definitely.
6920840	6927102	Just, I don't know, it's always surprising because you'll see people that you've never heard of and then just all of a sudden they'll come out with something pretty cool.
6927142	6928622	So it's really hard to tell.
6929503	6932023	I can't wait until they have an actual list of what's on there.
6932043	6934584	Then you'll kind of see what they try out.
6936610	6940792	I was going to enter, but I got lazy, so I'll enter MakeEditGetPorn instead or something.
6941092	6943534	Even though I don't want any of the porn that Loki's given away.
6943574	6949697	He had a really cool, you know, well, I made a really cool background for his song.
6949757	6954939	I finished the basic and trick steps, I just only got about three measures into the maniac steps, so whatever.
6956280	6958621	Eh, fuck contests, fuck them right in the ear.
6958641	6960542	I'll just release it because I'm cool.
6961503	6964084	It doesn't have to be, I don't have to whore it out under any contest.
6964704	6965465	I'm me, dammit.
6967608	6968910	We'll have a special contest.
6968990	6973378	It's called the Sky Owns You at SimFiles, so nobody wins except Sky.
6973658	6976242	I could run a tourney mix, but I just don't have the web space.
6977585	6979408	Well, yeah, but you wouldn't want to rip off a big idea anyway.
6979969	6981191	Make it at GetPorn's cooler anyway.
6982404	6983285	But see, here's the thing.
6983525	6986786	You know how they were going to have a special category where you actually had to pay to get in?
6986826	6988227	They were going to have prizes?
6988707	6989828	They aren't having that no more.
6989928	6990408	Oh, that's a bummer.
6990428	6990868	No one entered.
6991248	6991868	No one entered.
6992048	6992449	Surprise!
6992489	6993569	Nobody wants to pay money.
6993909	6994409	Go figure.
6994630	6995470	Well, anyways.
6995870	6997651	So, that fell through.
6997711	7000772	But I can always do mine where I give out anime DVDs.
7000892	7001272	Woohoo!
7001312	7001753	DVDs!
7002213	7003013	So, I don't know.
7003593	7003934	Alright.
7005074	7007935	We're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back.
7007975	7008596	And guess what?
7008716	7009376	In this break...
7010450	7011110	Orange Lounge Radio at Yahoo.com
7038627	7043608	So we're going to start off with the Freshness in India Amazing Mix.
7043668	7047068	This is from DCB, and his remixes are always very interesting.
7047929	7050109	DCB had a very cool one the other day.
7050169	7054030	He had a remix of Happy Meal that we played on a fuck-off that ended with the theme to Hey Dude.
7056370	7059091	Which was like the coolest Nickelodeon show ever.
7059171	7060411	Hey Dude.
7060451	7061551	Wait, let me see if I can find it.
7061591	7062511	Hold on, hold on.
7063011	7065772	I'm going to go to the end of the Happy Meal Evil Mix here, just so I can play this.
7068399	7068759	Wait, wait.
7068780	7069981	This is the end of here.
7070001	7071823	That show was the shit.
7087848	7091370	Loki's turning this shade of red I've never seen before from laughing so hard at that.
7091910	7094031	Dude, okay, DCB, I've got a challenge for you.
7094532	7100335	Okay, DCB, if you do this, I swear to God, we'll put it in a cage match, we will get it in rotation somehow.
7100815	7106878	I want you to do a remix that somehow involves the old school, you can't do that on television theme.
7108379	7109220	If you can do that...
7110465	7112386	I'll, like, give Sweet Lovin' to you or something.
7112406	7113187	That would be just awesome.
7113227	7113587	That would be rad.
7113607	7116389	And you have to have samples from... You have to have samples.
7117069	7117970	Shit, what's that guy?
7121792	7122492	Alistair?
7124614	7124874	J.D.
7124914	7125174	Ross?
7125194	7125514	J.D.
7125554	7125734	Ross.
7125754	7126435	You need J.D.
7126495	7128096	Ross clips in that song.
7128916	7131638	No, I want someone to do a remix of the She-Ra theme.
7134139	7135340	I can even send you the song.
7137144	7138745	DCB says this before his time.
7138825	7139285	Shit.
7140446	7141346	It doesn't care.
7141426	7142027	Just find it.
7142307	7145268	Find an old episode of Kazan, watch it, because it was the fucking shit.
7145689	7153833	Alright, we're going to play a DCB remix, Freshness in India, and then we're going to play something from Joe Mama called... I don't have my files queued up.
7153893	7154253	Let me look.
7154453	7155554	Wow, that's a cool song.
7156554	7158455	No, it's called Messy Closet.
7158475	7160196	That's what we're going to play from Joe Mama.
7160536	7161877	And then we'll play something from Loki.
7162477	7163778	I don't even know what Loki songs I have.
7163838	7164198	Let's see.
7164578	7166139	Is any of these yours, Loki?
7167404	7167644	ShadowStyle
7197704	7198485	Okay, so here we go.
7198765	7200006	We'll be back on Orange Lounge Radio.
7253755	7257139	Thank you for watching!
7314551	7315432	Thanks for watching!
7358204	7361126	Alright, that was Freshness in India by DCB.
7361146	7364149	Here comes Joe Mama with Messy Closet.
7398657	7400283	Thanks for watching!
7510849	7514994	All right, that was Joe Mama with Messy Closet.
7515034	7516595	And now we're going to do a Loki original.
7516635	7517897	This is Shadow Style.
7659571	7664474	Hey there, it's your point of Megaskin, warning you to listen to Orange Wild every Sunday.
7672058	7682463	Not just because it's the best eeeee money radio out there, but because if you don't, I will personally come to your house and do a nori nori nori routine.
7682823	7685685	And believe me, nobody wants to see that.
7690086	7702795	So remember, listen to Orange Lounge, because I don't want to have to have anyone suffer through this.
7702895	7712062	Hi, yes, we're back.
7712702	7713783	Nobody wants to suffer through that.
7714163	7714723	There, I did it.
7714783	7718486	I was able to make the promo play loud enough so we could all actually hear it, so I hope you enjoyed that.
7718526	7718886	Squee.
7719367	7719627	Squee.
7721998	7722518	Let's see.
7723979	7726540	We're going to do a list list soon, but we've got to prepare our list.
7726580	7729060	So we've got to hold off on that for a little bit.
7729601	7732221	But it will be the top three things that ruined the internet.
7732381	7733902	So we'll be talking about that later.
7735802	7736943	But now, let's see.
7736983	7737863	Do I have any other topics?
7738143	7739964	Oh, we need to announce the cage match winner.
7740004	7741004	That's one thing we need to talk about.
7742604	7743185	That's right.
7744025	7744865	Orange Lounge Cage Match.
7745345	7748286	The song that will be in rotation all next week.
7748366	7750387	The winner, ladies and gentlemen...
7751696	7759819	Two weeks in a row, the Knight Rider theme has won the Orange Lounge game match.
7761580	7764081	I will knock the Knight Rider theme down next week.
7765402	7767403	Mark my words, it'll be gone.
7767423	7770804	You wish.
7773112	7775694	Now, we do have a rule, though, that how many weeks do we say?
7775875	7776395	Four weeks?
7776915	7777156	Month.
7777476	7777876	Oh, a month.
7778177	7780599	Okay, so the song can't be in for more than a month, or it's gone.
7780619	7781319	We retire it.
7781680	7787345	We get Carson Daly out here to retire your song from Total Orange Request Live.
7791255	7794419	Next week it'll be Tom Green's Piggy Hill.
7795180	7797843	I'm gonna throw the piggy down the hill.
7798644	7800286	I'm gonna throw the piggy down.
7800366	7801948	I'm gonna throw the piggy down.
7802028	7803510	I'm gonna throw the piggy down the hill.
7803810	7804751	That for about five minutes.
7805492	7808135	I'm just gonna trump all you fuckers and put in the legend.
7810598	7811598	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7840276	7840877	Skillfully done.
7841257	7842298	I'm no match for Brad.
7844499	7847302	Are you preparing your list for listless now while I'm just sitting here ranting?
7847382	7847622	Yes.
7847862	7848603	Okay, great.
7848623	7850464	Then we won't have to take another break.
7850504	7851905	We'll just be able to go right into lists.
7851945	7852886	I have to think about mine.
7853306	7857029	So let's play one song while we prepare our list, shall we?
7858130	7859211	We'll play one quick song.
7859751	7861433	It's got to be something fun.
7861513	7861993	Let's see.
7863194	7864155	Instant love.
7864775	7866537	Okay, everybody loves instant love.
7868720	7869800	That's a good idea.
7870721	7872802	Alright, we'll be right back with the list list.
7872842	7874983	Top three things that ruined the internet right after this.
7878885	7881827	Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.
7882948	7887570	I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.
7888211	7890792	Listen carefully and try to follow.
7891693	7893734	The objects will come down from the top.
7894094	7895315	When it hits the red line,
7901191	7902034	Turn the table!
7902656	7903419	You get it?
7903800	7905526	Alright, let's practice!
7936138	7936398	Easy, huh?
7936418	7938740	Alright, let's go on to the scratch stage.
7938760	7941262	When the objects reach the red line, scratch!
7941362	7944143	With a fast note, the technique is to scratch fast.
7973130	7974112	DarkSakura.com
8045047	8050368	Orange Lounge Radio We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it Hello, we're back
8072253	8073093	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8103189	8104030	Let's see, we shall see.
8104450	8105071	Matt, go get the door.
8105091	8106732	I bought some fun music.
8106772	8107353	Yeah, I know you did.
8107633	8108814	I saw some things that we could do.
8108934	8110295	Oh, wait, am I looking in the cookie?
8110355	8111416	No, I'm looking in the wrong directory.
8112857	8118222	I thought you had... Oh, Dave's parents are here already, I guess.
8118242	8119242	Uh-oh.
8121724	8122665	Oh, they're pulling Dave away from us.
8122685	8123586	Oh, no, they're pulling Dave away.
8123606	8124667	What are we going to do about Listless?
8127749	8128050	Really?
8128070	8128190	Really?
8129721	8131883	Tell him to leave his list here, because we've got to do his list.
8132203	8132783	His list is here.
8133143	8133904	Is his list still here?
8135405	8137146	His list is here.
8137506	8140548	We'll have a person from our chatroom vote for our song.
8141448	8143409	Okay, we'll have a person from the chatroom vote for the song.
8143469	8146331	Or maybe we'll just all pile together and see which one we all agree on.
8146351	8147912	We could have a person... No, he's still here.
8148092	8148632	Oh, he's still here.
8152935	8154436	Can I just read my top three real quick?
8155576	8156657	Who's going to eliminate one?
8157284	8157584	Chainletters
8183811	8185335	and points I should say.
8186879	8187400	I can't say that.
8188964	8189766	I'll say it later.
8189846	8190688	Okay.
8192152	8192914	And I gotta go.
8195989	8196369	Bye!
8196469	8200011	Dude, he took one of mine.
8203213	8203693	Later, Dave.
8204033	8209816	We're gonna make a special surprise phone call to one of our listeners to have them pick something to eliminate off the list.
8209836	8210436	We'll do that later.
8211076	8212857	Don't start sending me your phone numbers.
8212877	8215378	I already have the person picked out that we're gonna call, so just shut up.
8215799	8218300	I still have to think of the number, too, because he took mine.
8219545	8221907	Alright, we'll read those again.
8221927	8226730	Is Dave's parents gone so I can read some of these?
8226750	8228891	Would you poke your head out the door please real fast, Matt?
8229151	8229692	They're gone.
8231213	8232714	Those top three once again from Dave.
8232834	8241139	Random people who instant message you, chain letters, and porn sites that say that they're free but they really aren't.
8242300	8243141	Just in case you missed those.
8243201	8246523	Okay, so now let's get back to the three of us here.
8247484	8248845	Boots my inserts on, my bad.
8252555	8253696	All right, Jamie.
8254236	8254637	Number three.
8254697	8256458	Your number three choice, please.
8256698	8257279	Microsoft.
8258360	8260341	Microsoft ruined the Internet.
8260461	8269649	Yeah, because of all their, you know, the MSM you can't delete from your computer and all of their little sending them all your crap.
8270630	8271891	I guess I should say spyware.
8273372	8274713	But Microsoft in particular.
8275293	8275654	All right.
8276875	8279297	Microsoft in particular ruined the Internet.
8279397	8280117	Next, Loki.
8280438	8281378	What ruined the Internet?
8281538	8281979	Number three.
8283446	8287008	40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women.
8288489	8295312	Could I have a funny story about... 40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women.
8295372	8296793	Yes, please tell your story.
8297093	8298214	Okay.
8298414	8300595	This is when my fiancé had just gotten online.
8300615	8302916	He was using my friend Julie's account, and she had a catwoman name.
8304617	8310020	And this guy propositioned him, thinking it was a woman for sex.
8310500	8311261	You know, like cyber...
8312034	8317396	So what they did is they ended up taking him into the IM and talking about power tools the whole time.
8317856	8319897	The guy's like, so what do you want to do first?
8320097	8324138	And Dan replies, I have a circular saw.
8324219	8325259	Do you like jigsaws?
8326459	8327820	I have a reciprocating saw.
8329260	8329841	The whole time.
8331141	8332842	Did he ever saw that he was being duped?
8333882	8336743	Cybersex is funny because it's so pointless.
8337884	8338384	Yeah.
8339818	8340118	All right.
8342260	8342580	All right.
8343041	8343441	My turn.
8344842	8345283	I'm eating.
8346183	8351588	My number three choice, as tempting as it was to put some popular websites, you know, DDR Freak, things like that.
8351748	8352168	I'm just teasing.
8352188	8352569	I'm just teasing.
8354170	8360055	My number three pick was another website that I believe ruined the Internet, and that website is GeoCities.
8362576	8367120	I believe that Geocities ruined the internet by allowing any dumb fuck to have a homepage.
8367940	8369642	Some people should not have webpages.
8370082	8372524	Some Geocities pages are cool, admittedly.
8372924	8377187	Although the banners fucked them up, you know, their little pop-up thing that they have on the right.
8377287	8378188	DJ Bads?
8379429	8380290	Yeah, I know, I know.
8380450	8381911	There's some cool things on Geocities.
8382872	8383492	But 98% of it is shit.
8386155	8392722	It's fuckin' sorority girls that put up pretty pink webpages with dancing pictures of doggies and pictures of their cat.
8392782	8393583	Nobody gives a shit.
8393643	8400030	Like my other website, uh, Loki's Insan- or was it, uh, uh, Sensory Deprivation.
8400130	8400510	That's it.
8401131	8402072	A site I don't update.
8402512	8402773	Fuck it.
8402793	8403413	Find it if you can.
8403634	8404034	I don't care.
8404114	8405275	GeoCity's ruined the internet.
8407017	8407377	Jamie!
8408717	8409777	Your number two pick, please.
8410117	8410897	Bad fandom.
8411878	8417879	As in people who write fanfics and do fanart that I don't agree with.
8417919	8419779	For lack of a better description.
8421140	8425580	Like people who do crossover fanfics.
8425760	8430962	And I'm not talking about good crossovers, but people who do really bad ones.
8431342	8433962	Like things that could not ever happen.
8435202	8437943	Again, I write fanfiction, that's fine.
8440202	8442584	The Internet is a haven for bad writers.
8443464	8447067	It's a haven for good writers, too, but you really have to look through a lot of shit to find it.
8447327	8453592	And then there's people who put up their art, and they obviously haven't spent any time practicing.
8453772	8460717	And I understand if maybe you're learning and you're improving, but I've seen slides of people whose art gets continuously worse.
8461177	8462598	And then they IM me.
8463619	8465260	Thank you for watching!
8480810	8485054	Going back to GeoCities, because DarkTetsuya wanted to point out that his website's on GeoCities.
8486175	8487576	Again, you're part of that cool 2%.
8488337	8488797	Don't worry.
8489438	8492340	I'm just saying 98% of the GeoCities webpages, they're ass.
8492360	8494222	But compared to what you have now, was it ass?
8500667	8502788	It was actually decent for... For it's time.
8502828	8503709	It was ahead of it's time.
8503749	8505730	For a HTML done in WordPad.
8506130	8506430	Alright.
8506610	8506910	Fair enough.
8506970	8507231	Okay.
8507491	8509112	As long as you didn't use that auto-generator.
8509132	8509972	Yeah, alright.
8510212	8510732	You're cool then.
8511113	8511913	That is bullshit.
8511933	8513014	I either use that or Dreamweaver.
8513154	8513414	Alright.
8513454	8513654	Good.
8514014	8514394	Good girl.
8514534	8514834	Alright.
8515675	8516956	Then we had Bad Fandom.
8518857	8520197	And now Loki's number two pit.
8520237	8520697	What is that?
8521778	8525040	Um... I guess I can go with... Okay, fine.
8525060	8525340	Whatever.
8525640	8527201	The lack of e-prostitutes.
8527721	8529262	You can buy everything online but women.
8532082	8534872	you can buy a wife you can buy a wife
8535933	8536734	I don't want a wife.
8536954	8537814	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
8538455	8539275	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
8539716	8540876	We have to research this now.
8546120	8550062	Seriously, you can get a mail order bride.
8551103	8556146	I'm looking up our old friends from, oh, I guess, is this it?
8556447	8557147	I think this is it.
8557587	8560469	I'm looking up our old friends at the Bunny Ranch from Under Sedation Live.
8560509	8561790	I'm trying to find their website.
8562551	8565813	And I'm trying to see if we can see, ah, easy online reservations.
8566493	8567834	You can get a prostitute online.
8567854	8570655	You can reserve a prostitute on the internet.
8571776	8572616	That's different.
8572636	8574657	That's just like making a reservation at a hotel.
8574677	8577519	You're not buying the friggin' hotel and having that hotel shipped to your house.
8577599	8578779	Alright, alright, alright, alright.
8579360	8581701	So you want a site that's actually going to ship a woman to your house?
8581721	8583562	Goddammit, I'm getting all these pop-up ads.
8583862	8585643	Those bastards.
8585683	8587444	No, like, you know, something like, um...
8587924	8591105	I don't know, um, like, uh, Red Octane, you know?
8591385	8596227	You pay... Are you comparing Red Octane to prostitution?
8596627	8597888	Hey, it could be, okay?
8598268	8605291	You pay a certain amount of money for, like, a monthly fee, they send a woman to your house with a shipping label, you know, when you're down a third and then you ship her off back.
8606151	8612674	The site you're looking for is called realdolls.com Oh my god.
8613809	8615893	I actually sit in the same room with you every Sunday.
8616975	8619960	Alright, my number two pick for thing that ruined the internet.
8620361	8621423	Oh god, this is a good one.
8623086	8624809	Number two thing that ruined the internet.
8625650	8626131	ICQ.
8630985	8634746	I... ICQ back in the day was alright.
8634826	8639748	I mean, it was one of the first instant messaging programs before, like, cool ones like Yahoo showed up.
8639788	8645591	And AOL, even though AOL's kind of crappy now, AOL Instant Messenger's still cool.
8647291	8650713	But ICQ is like the shithole of IMs.
8650773	8651093	It's like...
8652196	8656860	It's like the program that people who don't know how to use any other instant messenger program use.
8656920	8658421	I cannot stand ICQ.
8658881	8659962	I get the weirdest...
8660994	8662495	messages from people on ICQ.
8662595	8666076	I don't use ICQ anymore because of random people on ICQ.
8666576	8675999	Like, if I have one more, like, 16-year-old woman from Brazil emailing me over ICQ wanting me to go to some website to see her boobs, I'm gonna scream.
8676019	8677519	Dude, I need to get on ICQ.
8679160	8685361	I mean, ICQ constantly sends you ads, and now it's all, like, added out and stuff, and they sold it out to the man.
8687282	8689463	Ever since ICQ sold out, they've sucked.
8689603	8691143	ICQ ruined the internet.
8692304	8693924	Well, I have my number one.
8694044	8698345	Alright, let's hear DarkSakura's number one thing that ruined the internet.
8698525	8699386	Lazy typing.
8700166	8703367	As in people who use the letter U instead of writing Y-O-U.
8704487	8705848	Lazy typing.
8705868	8707648	Or P-L-Z for please.
8708969	8710309	Or, you know...
8711678	8716839	I don't mind Lee, but I've also put for the lazy writing too, I want to add in Asian typing too.
8717800	8723501	I don't mind Lee, but I really, really hate all the rest of it.
8723821	8725702	Because it makes people look ignorant, okay?
8726242	8730803	There are people who, they start typing that way to me, I'll be like, type English, you know?
8732605	8733746	I will completely ignore them.
8733926	8738047	I'll be like, I'm sorry, but I wasn't aware that the letter U stands alone as its own word.
8738887	8742709	You know, I'll go check it on dictionary.com and post them a link and everything.
8742869	8743709	So, I hate it.
8745430	8748031	Alright, so lazy and Asian typing.
8748951	8752652	You know that's funny because it's very similar to my number one, but I think my number one's a little different.
8752712	8753433	It's different enough.
8754293	8757354	Alright, Loki, your number one thing that ruined the internet.
8757374	8758254	He's already laughing.
8759555	8760275	Mac users.
8762847	8763767	Don't leave it at that.
8765388	8766148	Oh, shit.
8769289	8770589	You care to back that up?
8770629	8773149	Because I think somebody's going to have a severe problem with this.
8773270	8775130	Actually, I kind of wanted to change one of mine on there.
8776110	8777370	Okay, we can go back in a little bit.
8778191	8778591	All right.
8778611	8781732	Loki, you want to kind of back up your answer a little bit here?
8781792	8783532	Why Mac users ruin the Internet?
8784062	8784542	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8806374	8808037	I actually rethought my Bad Fandom one.
8808057	8808578	Oh, okay.
8808598	8809119	You want to change that?
8809139	8810782	Because everyone has to start somewhere.
8811623	8814207	And Bad Fandom just encourages people to go look for the good stuff.
8814247	8814448	Alright.
8814508	8815329	And you know what?
8815409	8817232	I was actually going to take that off the list anyway.
8817272	8818835	So I'm going to change it to Pop-Up Ads.
8819055	8819616	Pop-Up Ads.
8819676	8819917	Alright.
8822426	8824007	Because pop-up ads need to be on there.
8824067	8825508	So we're getting rid of bad fandom and putting on pop-up ads.
8825528	8828209	You're going to need the negative to encourage people to look for the positive.
8828349	8829630	And everybody had to start somewhere.
8829930	8831791	So I retract it and apologize.
8832311	8832732	Okay.
8833812	8835793	Black Lab's having a fit in the chat room.
8835813	8836214	This is great.
8836354	8836734	I know.
8836814	8837774	I did that on purpose.
8837794	8839976	Oh, you did it on purpose just to piss them off?
8841196	8841476	You go.
8841496	8842117	You ass.
8843678	8844238	You're cool.
8844738	8845939	I just didn't have a third one.
8846179	8849621	You know, by the way, we might have a special in-studio guest Black Lab here next week.
8850146	8851466	I was just kidding, Black Lab.
8851486	8854407	I'm taking it off as my pick to remove from the list.
8854427	8855427	Alright, alright, alright.
8855487	8856027	Don't worry.
8856047	8857167	We'll get to that later.
8857187	8857847	We'll get to that later.
8857887	8858847	We'll get to that later.
8859068	8859888	Can I read number one?
8860088	8861308	Can I do my number one thing now?
8861528	8861828	Alright.
8862328	8864708	Number one thing that ruined the internet, in my opinion.
8865249	8866309	The caps lock key.
8868129	8869129	God, yes.
8871730	8872710	I'm sorry, where's my music?
8873370	8873690	Thank you.
8874730	8876610	The caps lock key ruined the internet.
8877611	8879071	Don't ever use it.
8879511	8879731	Ever.
8880515	8883779	The only time you can use it is if you're me and you're doing the listless segment.
8884440	8885521	Like I'm doing right now.
8886102	8888685	That's the only time you can ever use the cap slot key.
8889947	8891328	Otherwise, use shift.
8891589	8893571	That way you don't type in all caps.
8893952	8894712	You know what I hate?
8894732	8899038	If I see one more person at my work typing caps, I'm gonna cry.
8899751	8904573	You can change mine if you want for Mac users to MIDI music that plays when you go to webpages.
8905353	8907074	Alright, so we're changing Mac users now?
8907134	8907454	Jeez.
8907674	8913676	Except my old DarkSakura page has MIDI's that play, but that was because at the time I thought it was cool.
8913696	8916257	GeoCities, by the way, will not let me take down that page.
8918018	8919699	It's still up there, my old DarkSakura page.
8920039	8920540	That's cool.
8920580	8921561	Why won't they let you take it down?
8921881	8922701	I have no idea.
8922721	8923322	I can't.
8923762	8930147	It was actually after GeoCities and Yahoo did their little, you know, they screwed and, you know, spawned something.
8931008	8932689	So I haven't been able to log into my old accounts.
8933493	8936095	I mean, notice all the commercials for Yahoo.
8936395	8941518	Like, they promote Yahoo as a meeting place for, like, the scum of the earth.
8942078	8946981	You've got, like, the dating ad with people with big hands and that really ugly chick that's an astronaut.
8947001	8950503	I mean, they just show ugly, nasty people that are on Yahoo.
8950803	8952545	Who'd want to be on Yahoo with all these freaks?
8953485	8954866	So you're saying Yahoo ruined the internet?
8956266	8960371	Yahoo... Internet commercials ruin the internet, okay?
8961112	8962093	Too late, we have our list.
8962174	8962874	Let's read the list.
8962915	8963315	Here we go.
8963976	8965698	This is the list as it stands currently.
8965818	8967340	Random people who IM you.
8967821	8968522	Chain letters.
8969182	8971265	Porn sites that say they're free but really not.
8971806	8972507	Microsoft.
8972807	8986814	40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women, GeoCities, pop-up ads, lack of e-prostitutes, ICQ, lazy typing or Asian typing, MIDI music that plays when you go to websites, and the caps lock key.
8987315	8991997	So, that all being said, Jamie, what is coming off this list?
8992037	8992918	What ain't so bad?
8993078	8994278	Lack of e-prostitutes.
8994499	8996059	Lack of e-prostitutes.
8996199	8998461	Because I don't really give a care about sluts.
9001101	9004483	Alright, anything else you want to say with that, or just, you don't like sluts?
9005464	9006264	I don't like sluts.
9006764	9009826	Okay, I'm getting an early vote already, it is not time to vote.
9010326	9011867	DCB, your vote doesn't count.
9013348	9016490	You have to wait, because that thing you voted for might come up.
9016870	9018071	You get smacked with the ferret.
9020512	9021173	The ferret's over here.
9021593	9022814	Oh, you're doing a slash me.
9026468	9028409	Forget it.
9028769	9029570	She took the keyboard.
9029850	9034413	Now we have to wait for Jamie to... Alright, I can do mine because I already... Oh, you already know what it is?
9034653	9035393	Yeah.
9036074	9043278	Mine has to go... I'm going to take off the porn sites that say they're free but really aren't because free porn sites are like the Fountain of Youth.
9043298	9043999	They don't exist.
9050002	9051223	You just don't know where to look.
9052657	9054317	There's no such thing as free porn sites.
9054417	9056878	There are back doors to porn sites, which are awesome.
9056918	9057578	Oh, back doors.
9058539	9059779	HappyHacker.com.
9059859	9062060	Happy-Hacker.com.
9062260	9063420	PersianKitty.com.
9065160	9065500	I believe.
9065801	9067721	DoubleXPassword.com.
9067841	9068881	Anyway, this isn't that good.
9068901	9070022	Find me some boy porn, man porn.
9070962	9071802	Find me man porn.
9073383	9073763	Is it free?
9073943	9074143	Yes.
9079844	9081885	It's all boys and boys, though, but anyway.
9083470	9087092	I used to have a DVD, but I got rid of it pretty quickly once I got it.
9087332	9089453	It was one of those free Vivid DVDs that they gave me.
9092094	9095136	I don't get them anymore, but... Alright.
9095876	9096957	Oh, I'm sorry, back to listless.
9096997	9097857	Oh yeah, I gotta take that off.
9097877	9099278	Porn sites say they're free, but really not.
9100999	9101659	That comes off the list.
9102940	9104261	My turn to take something off the list.
9105321	9108343	I'm going to take off, um... Hmm...
9111351	9113573	I'm going to take off MIDI music that plays when you go to websites.
9114053	9116575	Because one of my old websites also had a MIDI song to play in the background.
9116615	9117435	Fuck you, they're cool.
9118236	9119757	Mine played Street Fighter MIDI.
9119857	9120977	Mine played Tori Amos.
9122739	9124800	Alright, fine, I should just reiterate.
9125220	9126921	Actually, MIDI music's not that bad.
9127462	9132165	I don't like it, it's annoying, but I hate the sites that make you download MP3s to get into the site.
9132285	9133166	Yeah, I agree.
9133186	9133966	That's stupid.
9133986	9136388	What, is that like a porn thing?
9136408	9140230	A lot of times when someone tries to play MIDI music, all you have to do is hit stop, and it, you know.
9141511	9142832	Actually, that's Good Cool's site.
9143633	9144193	That does that.
9144293	9144674	Really?
9144974	9145795	Bad Good Cool.
9145855	9146335	Bad.
9147016	9147296	No, no.
9147416	9147996	Not Good Cool.
9148076	9149157	It was Ryo Nagumi.
9149538	9150058	Or Nagumu.
9150638	9150919	All right.
9151059	9152140	Nagu something.
9152620	9160947	Now, I'm going to try this phone thing, and we've all had really bad experiences with this in the past, so I'm going to call someone who I'm pretty confident is listening to the show.
9162028	9168653	And I'm a little upset that Loki took the Mac users thing off the list, because this would have been an exciting telephone conversation if that were the case.
9169053	9177497	Rob, why don't you get one of those car hookups for your phone, and then you can plug it into the microphone thing here, and then everyone can hear it.
9178017	9179218	Because that's too easy!
9180459	9182339	Julie's going to be giving us a real phone hookup.
9182359	9183680	Actually, that's a really good idea.
9183700	9186261	Yeah, we're going to be looking into the phone hookup thing, don't worry about it.
9186802	9189283	But for now, we don't have that, so here we go.
9191824	9193325	Let me place that phone call here.
9203726	9208048	That was a lovely building.
9209008	9210108	Hello, Black Lab.
9210869	9211349	Hello?
9211689	9212469	Can you hear us fine?
9213510	9213950	Yeah.
9213970	9216351	Do you have anything you want to say to Loki first off?
9217711	9220172	Yeah, Loki, screw you, man.
9222453	9229895	If I were there right now, I'd whip out a whole sheet of information that I could shove in your face and prove you wrong.
9230176	9231156	I was going to defend you.
9232040	9238585	The cell phone thing sounds like crap, so we can't stay on this too long, but... Do you need me to read the list for you?
9238625	9240546	Do you already have something that you want to come off the list?
9244209	9244869	Alright, here it is.
9245470	9247271	Random people who instant message you.
9248052	9248792	Chain letters.
9249593	9251414	Microsoft.
9251434	9253035	40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women.
9254486	9262671	GeoCities, PopUp Ads, ICQ, Lazy or Asian Typing, and CapsLockKey.
9264372	9268315	So you're saying people should stop being lazy and set up an email filter?
9268335	9268515	Yeah.
9285500	9287280	All right, thanks for participating, Black Lab.
9288261	9288581	All right.
9288821	9289361	See you next week.
9289461	9289741	Bye.
9291242	9293002	Wow, Orange Haunts Radio phone call like wood.
9293022	9296423	I'm surprised you didn't take off 40-year-old women pretending to be men just to piss me off.
9296763	9298824	Because everyone else has already eliminated my stuff.
9298844	9300104	Oh, already taken off your choices?
9300144	9300544	I'm sorry.
9301305	9304786	That seems to be a popular thing around here is people eliminating your picks.
9304846	9305326	Go figure.
9307605	9310607	I just pick random shit, I don't actually answer seriously.
9312369	9313950	Oh, I see, are you mocking this segment?
9313990	9314711	Is that what you're doing?
9315391	9323357	No, it's just I think it's more entertaining to pick really weird shit instead of actual serious answers because everyone else has the same answers I would have used, so there.
9324278	9324558	Alright.
9325319	9328041	Okay, you can vote now during our listless segment.
9328061	9329302	We're going to take one last break.
9330194	9331295	Read off the list one more time.
9331395	9331715	Oh, yes.
9331875	9333215	Of course we're going to read off the list one more time.
9333235	9334436	I just got to post it in the chat room.
9334456	9334776	Here it is.
9334796	9335536	Okay, here's what we have.
9335556	9335877	You ready?
9336197	9336417	Yes.
9336957	9350343	Random people who I MU, which I hate, Microsoft, 40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women, GeoCities, pop-up ads, ICQ, lazy typing or Asian typing, and a caps lock key.
9352355	9352776	So vote!

9369528	9370408	I hope that's not for me.
9370428	9372069	I don't think so.
9372449	9375370	We had one come from somebody else listening to the show.
9375630	9376851	I forgot to read it, but we'll get to it.
9377411	9383674	So, top three things that ruin the internet when we come back from this break featuring some Beatmania final music.
9383994	9384274	Enjoy.
9600157	9602377	S, Actdeft, S, Actdeft

9694770	9696671	We're wrapping it up in the last segment here.
9697231	9697672	I'm sorry, Jamie?
9697792	9698392	Because we're special.
9698612	9699192	We're special.
9699653	9700313	Special Ed.
9700893	9701834	Special enough for the Olympics.
9702534	9704595	Jamie and I are planning on some late night boba, too.
9704615	9705215	That should be fun.
9705375	9705616	Yes.
9705936	9706816	Boba's always a winner.
9706896	9709017	Anyone in the Davis area, come hang out with us.
9709137	9711959	Black Lab already went home, so he can't join us.
9712759	9714320	That's right, he gets to join us via phone tonight.
9714640	9716121	He'll be here in person next week, maybe.
9716961	9717441	That's a maybe.
9717481	9720283	Next week, by the way, is going to be the big year-end show.
9721587	9722748	I didn't lose that much.
9722828	9724751	I still have about two liters of Pepsi in me.
9736690	9739232	Maybe another one for best... For any song that's been released.
9739432	9740453	In 2002, yes.
9741054	9743095	Any Bomani song that's been released in 2002.
9743676	9747659	And we might also do one if we've got time for, like, best thing in the Bomani world for 2002.
9747699	9756306	I'm also going to do a special pre-show of stuff that was either... Assuming that I have all the files for stuff that was in Second Mix or Beatmania Substream.
9757067	9757807	Or 2DX Substream.
9759208	9759569	Cool.
9760129	9760569	Old stuff.
9761230	9761830	Old school stuff.
9761850	9763792	You know, maybe go up as far as Second Style.
9764713	9764973	Ooh.
9765353	9766014	So it's going to be old.
9766610	9766950	Old school.
9768011	9771415	Okay, let's reveal the winners of this week's listless segment.
9771615	9772536	Ferret roll, please.
9775779	9778822	The top three things that ruined the internet.
9779943	9782726	Alright, number three, Jamie, what ruined the internet?
9782966	9783647	Microsoft.
9784788	9787351	Microsoft is a loser.
9788129	9790813	Jamie, what is the number two thing that ruined the internet?
9790893	9791594	Pop-up ads.
9792975	9794217	Pop-up ads suck.
9794658	9795078	Go to hell.
9795859	9798543	And the number one thing that ruined the internet?
9799036	9800877	Lazy typing or AZN typing.
9801917	9804178	Which I find incredibly funny because they were all my picks.
9804998	9805758	Were they really?
9805918	9806158	Yes.
9808639	9810660	Shit, Jamie is the winner today.
9811480	9813060	Although there's some other things to get a vote.
9813701	9816301	And some interesting things that were said in the chat room.
9816361	9818282	Things we didn't put on the list at all.
9818722	9822283	EOSFVB suggested that Orange Lounge in fact ruined the internet.
9823244	9824364	Harry Potter websites.
9828592	9834117	Excuse me, wait a minute, you gave me Alan Rickman movies, so I'm not going to kick you, but I'll hit you with a ferret.
9837740	9840162	Dark Tetsuya says the ferret ruined the internet.
9845286	9846807	What else ruined the internet here?
9846847	9847227	I don't know.
9847968	9852672	Suggestions, chat room, give me your suggestions for what other things ruined the internet that we forgot to say.
9854389	9855350	Target.com?
9855530	9855910	eBay.
9856551	9857071	eBay.
9857451	9858772	Why did eBay ruin the internet?
9858792	9860474	Because it makes me spend all my money.
9861715	9865918	Actually, Half.com has been taking up more of my money lately because I've been finding laser discs.
9866358	9868880	I think a good one would be LiveJournal ruined the internet.
9868980	9869981	No, I like LiveJournal.
9870001	9876426	You know what sucks is I have the money and I have the actual, I just don't have the space.
9876746	9879008	I could have bought a Beatmania Complete Mixer 500.
9881450	9881670	Dang.
9881710	9882571	I would have stored it for you.
9884915	9885876	That's a little late now, though.
9886096	9886957	I'll wait when I move out.
9887897	9890119	We had another vote that Twen ruined the internet.

9916004	9916984	Just kidding.
9917104	9917865	I know you're a mod there.
9918906	9919826	Damn straight.
9919866	9920327	Damn skippy.
9922788	9924249	Yeah, shouldn't that be damn poopy?
9924409	9925070	Damn poopy.
9927011	9928652	No, that would be darn poopy.
9929433	9929693	Frick.
9930033	9930834	This is a good one.
9930874	9931554	This is a good one.
9931874	9933395	Neopets ruin the internet.
9933435	9935116	Hey!
9935217	9943102	By the way, if Maple's listening, check your Neopets account and add me as your friend, or I won't send you any dung.
9947247	9948569	Yes, I have Neopets.
9948669	9950671	I'm on there as DJ underscore Celica.

9968161	9969242	Ultima Online.
9970383	9971664	Oh, fucking EverQuest.
9972365	9974546	How did we leave EverQuest off of our list?
9974566	9975867	I'm still pissed at Ragnarok.
9975967	9978169	EverQuest completely ruined the internet.
9978209	9980471	It not only ruined the internet, it ruined real life.
9980491	9980631	Fuck.
9982136	9989557	I'm still mad, though, at Gravity for Ride and Rock Online and making it where I can't play anymore.
9990457	9996218	If they were reliable, maybe I could play again and get my goggles back.
9996338	9997719	Flash ruined the internet?
9998619	10000019	Shockwave.com!
10002139	10007180	I still think that... No, Shockwave is good because... I can't believe I left that off my list.
10008160	10010881	Because of Shockwave, we have Rattuskull and Devildoll.
10012122	10018146	Just go to JoeSparks.com I'll bring an mp3 for that next week.
10019707	10023750	It's, I think, JoeSparks.com And then watch Rat-A-Skull and Devil Doll.
10025567	10027548	SomethingAwful.com ruined the internet.

10054078	10055818	Stupid people.
10057099	10059820	Which, by the way, stupid people ruin everything.
10060882	10069609	And you know, I find it very funny for those people who, when you're going on fan art sites, trying to download fan art, and you right-click to save the picture, and they go, Oh, you can't do that, blah, blah.
10069869	10071150	So I just save page.
10071471	10071951	Yeah, I know.
10072231	10073292	Stupid people.
10073412	10075174	Or if they have it where you can't save the pages.
10075194	10076194	You go to view their web source.
10076415	10076895	You know what?
10077015	10082780	Anybody who has any knowledge of how to use their computer in a graphics editor, it's called print screen.
10084861	10085262	That works.
10086461	10093066	I wanted to end it on that note that people ruin the internet, but there's just too many good ones that are still coming in.
10093306	10095808	Final Fantasy Online is going to ruin the internet.
10096689	10098610	Are they doing that on... No.
10099090	10100151	Yes, Final Fantasy Online.
10100171	10100611	You know what?
10100671	10104014	PSO is going on... It's already out in Japan on PC.
10105475	10107156	Xbox Live will ruin the internet.
10108437	10110839	Okay, Xbox Live has ruined my life.
10111539	10111919	Okay?
10112640	10114041	I'm trying to sleep...
10114793	10124335	and Dan's playing freaking that mecha assault game and I'm here about to drift off and say EAT IT MOTHERFUCKER just like that and I'm like, Dan!
10124955	10125855	I'm trying to sleep!
10126635	10130636	You know, at least he doesn't do that when I'm on the floor with my grandmother in Alabama but you know what?
10131716	10135777	Just wait for that day.
10135857	10137258	Metallica ruined the internet?
10137378	10138998	No, Metallica ruined file sharing.
10139617	10141918	and LeechFromLoki.tk ruined the internet.
10143158	10144098	Damn straight.
10144578	10146318	Under Station Live ruined the internet.
10147199	10150019	Under Station Live was one of the best things to happen to the internet.
10150359	10150779	I agree.
10150819	10152580	Under Station Live is the best thing to ever happen to the internet.
10152600	10153580	You're just saying that because you were a host.
10153600	10154000	Yeah, I know.
10154400	10156421	Well, I'm just saying that because I was the number one guest.
10156721	10160181	I know what it's like to be the number one guest.
10160682	10162482	College cams ruined the internet.
10163382	10165683	And DDR Maniacs.
10165703	10166603	Yeah, Bitmoney cams.
10167563	10167903	D.D.R.
10167943	10195144	Epsker, alright, that's enough ruin the internet talk everything ruined the internet, shut up, I don't care anymore uh, Naoki's Diary ruined the internet, that's a good one alright, that's it, alright, that's it that was it, last one yeah, that was an alternate on my list next time we'll talk about what ruined your life and I believe number one on everybody's list will be Bomani no way, Bomani improved my life stupid people yes, stupid people
10197931	10202955	SoCalKicks wants us to get on a positive note here and talk about what improved the internet.
10203155	10203496	Porn.
10206838	10208439	Killing stupid people.
10209320	10209840	I mean porn.
10210321	10212322	Google improved the internet?
10212362	10215044	Yes, Google, the only unbiased search engine.
10216725	10221589	What did they refuse to take to put people higher who pay them more?
10222766	10224666	They are an unbiased search engine.
10224906	10225527	They're funny.
10225567	10227947	They have their search engine in Klingon, okay?
10228627	10229687	And Swedish Chef.
10230527	10233408	Seriously, go under the language preferences and look at the list of languages.
10233648	10235328	You can browse in Esperanto.
10236448	10237129	That's brilliant.
10239669	10242049	So, I would say Google improved the internet.
10242149	10244730	Web.archive.org, I believe it's called.
10244750	10245610	Yahoo email is good.
10246110	10247290	The archiver thing.
10247330	10249071	The web archiver improved the internet.
10249091	10249571	The anonymizer.
10250351	10251011	Anonymizer.
10251533	10254916	But Yahoo Email is pretty good because they've built in a spam filter.
10255836	10256957	PopUpKiller.
10257978	10258839	Save the internet.
10258879	10259299	AdAware.
10260560	10262461	AdAware improved the internet completely.
10262502	10263142	Kazalite.
10263923	10265184	File sharing with no adware.
10265364	10265524	WinMX.
10265564	10265844	WinMX.
10266425	10266845	Napster.
10268734	10275817	Back to the Day, Back to the Day, Audio Galaxy, because people told Audio Galaxy to take it down, and Audio Galaxy said, hey, fuck you.
10275857	10278378	PHPBB2 is being suggested by SoCalCase.
10278398	10281579	Yes.
10283080	10284200	Wasn't there an email to read?
10284300	10285000	Oh, thank you.
10285401	10286421	Oh, Black Lab's my hero.
10286461	10287922	He reminded me that we had email in the box here.
10287982	10290263	Easyboard.com ruined the internet.
10290283	10291583	Oh, God, that's beautiful.
10291643	10291903	Yes.
10292403	10293884	Sakbemani has salvaged the internet.
10294838	10297921	Sakmamani completely improved the internet as did Orange Lounge Radio.
10298261	10299422	And of course, DDR Freak.
10302544	10304566	Hey, stop looking at me!
10306507	10310250	Alright, I had one more FU, we never got to read.
10311431	10315594	So, shit, where's that FU music I had earlier for our chat room?
10315995	10316375	Here we go.
10317336	10317716	I had it.
10319177	10320418	Stand by to bitch.
10320919	10321239	Yay.
10321259	10321319	Yay.
10324968	10335492	F, persons from Hicktown I don't know that made me 4-1, screwing me out of a medal at my wrestling tournament, and my Mac, my dad gave me an early Christmas present, and I book WooFuckingWho.
10335892	10337173	That's exactly what the email says.
10337193	10339293	That came from Martin Tan.
10339353	10339714	Thank you.
10342314	10345536	I've decided something that I want the chat room to do for me, or all of our listeners.
10345696	10346757	Oh, you have a command.
10347057	10347297	Yes.
10349259	10351260	Especially people in the LiveJournal community or whatever.
10352160	10354402	Do you still have the link to that sorting quiz that I gave you?
10355729	10359613	Ooh, if you can remember the first few... It was at Virtual Hogwarts.
10361535	10363197	No, just do a search for it on Google.
10363898	10368002	But I'm rather curious because I'm still in my little fan phase right now.
10368503	10372106	I want to see where everybody in the chat room would find themselves sorted.
10373007	10376211	So I want them to take the sorting quiz that is like the best one ever.
10376676	10378697	Is it Hogwarts?
10378757	10379338	Oh, is it this one?
10379538	10380679	Hogwarts?
10380699	10380979	This one?
10381399	10381680	This one?
10382160	10382640	Seven Dragons?
10382660	10382920	That one?
10382980	10383361	Okay.
10383461	10385742	We're going to post a link in the chat room, and I want everyone to take it.
10385782	10389225	And when it asks you to pick your preference for a house, pick no preference.
10389705	10389785	Yeah.
10389805	10390926	Because I want to see where it puts you.
10391166	10392267	So, you're going to do this.
10392287	10395089	You're going to say, there's a little link on there that says...
10395589	10396089	Get sorted.
10396450	10397070	Get sorted.
10397130	10398551	Click here to be sorted.
10398571	10399952	It's on the left column.
10400492	10404415	At the very end of the quiz, it'll ask you if you have a preference for a house.
10404515	10405816	Click no preference.
10406156	10411100	It's right underneath the... Because if you've seen the recent movies, you'll know that if you have a preference, that's what you're going to get.
10411420	10412501	By the way, twins, shut up.
10415022	10420186	So... You wonder why you're on my... I got Slytherin, by the way.
10420206	10421627	I took this test and I sorted into Slytherin.
10421647	10422548	I always get Slytherin.
10423917	10426158	Black Lep says he already took it and he's in Ravenclaw.
10426559	10427339	You're a nerd.
10429960	10433442	But yeah, make sure it's this test that you took.
10433683	10437164	So take this test and find out where you get sorted.
10437505	10438965	Don't tell us in the chat room.
10439005	10440146	We're not going to tell you there.
10441527	10445389	Email it to the Orange Lounge Radio and we'll make a tally.
10445509	10446710	Or post it in the Live Journal community.
10446730	10448671	When we get back from Bobo, I'll put up a link in the...
10449275	10451876	SoCalKicks wants you to know he loves you, by the way, DarkSakura.
10452276	10453516	Aww, I love you too.
10454296	10462839	Alright, so go take that test, email orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and let us know where you were sorted, because Jamie is that big of a Harry Potter nerd that she has to know.
10462859	10464599	Maybe we should start the personality quiz of the week.
10465219	10466340	The personality quiz of the week?
10467980	10469240	Okay, somebody quit the twin.
10469620	10469901	Okay.
10474648	10475449	I'm going to kick him again.
10475809	10476709	Okay, you want to kick him again?
10476729	10477530	Go ahead and take the keyboard.
10477810	10481112	In the meantime, I'm going to ask Loki, what's your final thought of the day?
10481672	10485795	My final thought of the day is I'm going home and working my website.
10486355	10489297	Because, I don't know, I have nothing better to do.
10490718	10491618	I did my work for the week.
10495100	10496521	Jamie's furiously trying to kick.
10499261	10500562	I don't know.
10500762	10502063	I know you're waiting for your edits.
10502624	10504485	I just haven't gotten around to it.
10509269	10510350	Alright, now that that's over.
10511951	10513932	Good luck with the site.
10514012	10515634	I'll finish my thing.
10516374	10521218	I don't have the edits yet because I'm lazy and haven't made them yet.
10521838	10522359	Sorry.
10523300	10523720	That's it.
10524500	10528984	And Loki, SoCalKicks is waiting for the MaxUSA edits for his site.
10531089	10536994	By the way, if you still want to host the edits that I've made for you, by the way, I'll go ahead and send them to you again, but be forewarned.
10537414	10539876	My DexDrive died.
10540216	10544740	By the way, if anyone happens to find a DexDrive anywhere in their town... I have a spare.
10545620	10546321	Okay, I want it.
10546661	10547602	I'll pay you five bucks for it.
10548322	10552566	Jamie had that look on her face when Loki took the mic away, like, you asshole!
10552646	10555148	And then all of a sudden when Loki said that, she was like, oh, never mind.
10556889	10557830	You live for now.
10560070	10561371	DarkSakura, he has them.
10561431	10561872	They're up.
10561892	10562552	They're just not linked.
10562913	10563473	I have new ones.
10563773	10564013	Cool.
10564654	10565635	We can get some of mine up there, too.
10565655	10566215	Wouldn't that be neat?
10566715	10567796	Squeak.
10568297	10574221	My final thought of the week is I hate people that I go out on dates with.
10574281	10574962	I hate them all.
10575362	10582007	And besides, you can have the results or the winners from my MakeEditGetPorn contest.
10582027	10583528	They're all MaxUSA edits.
10583869	10584689	Whee!
10585390	10585950	Oh, okay.
10587011	10588472	I should enter that just for the hell of it.
10589133	10589493	You should.
10591997	10592438	Thanks for watching!
10606818	10607278	Interesting.
10608679	10609780	Okay, I guess that's it.
10610301	10613823	You have to point out... Oh, there's the fortune cookie in the directory all by itself, Jamie?
10613963	10615704	Okay, then we'll have that all taken care of.
10616565	10617205	I guess that's it.
10617225	10619527	We'll see you next week when we're going to do our holiday wrap-up.
10620748	10621728	And... This one?
10622349	10622529	Okay.
10623109	10625891	And... That'll be it?
10627352	10628813	And then we're going to do a tape show on the 29th?
10628833	10630274	I didn't do my final thought!
10630354	10630995	I thought you did.
10631235	10632056	Oh, my bad, Jamie.
10632116	10632996	I was kicking twins.
10633036	10633737	Oh, okay, sorry.
10634197	10635278	Jamie, yes, your final thought?
10639742	10640806	Thank you, that was riveting.
10640827	10642854	I'm going to go and watch all of these Alan Rickman movies.
10644542	10647663	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10648223	10651563	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
10652164	10657365	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
10657605	10668087	If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
