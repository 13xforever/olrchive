00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
In this episode...

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Hey, are any girls down there?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
That's the biggest parry you've ever seen, Dingleberry.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
What's your favorite security movie?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Showgirls.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Absolutely frightful.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
What's yours?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Don't torture yourself.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
That's my job.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Now's the time when sprockets pay me dogs!

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I know comfort.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
No! What I expect from Spanish exposure is gentle.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Hey!

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Dark Sakura.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000

01:27.000 --> 01:27.500
Loki

01:27.500 --> 01:31.000
I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.500
What kind of war human being would find that funny?

01:33.500 --> 01:35.500
Orange Lounge Radio

05:03.500 --> 05:33.340
This is a microphone check and apparently the microphone is finally working.

05:33.340 --> 05:36.160
think we had it plugged into the wrong place anyway sorry about the dead air

05:36.160 --> 05:42.580

05:42.580 --> 05:47.900

Two-thirds of our little group is sort of not here.

06:04.840 --> 06:09.820
Rob and Matt, sorry, Skye and Loki, they are currently in the car on the way back from

06:09.820 --> 06:13.780
Southern California because they went and didn't bring me while I was working.

06:13.780 --> 06:15.380
You know, kind of need to make money.

06:15.380 --> 06:21.900
So they might have a little bit of a dedication during the FUs of the week.

06:21.900 --> 06:26.960
I've got two special guests with me in the studio, I guess, today.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.940
Let me go ahead and do a little introduction again.

06:30.940 --> 06:35.400
We have with us in studio Jessica and Ross, also known as Iguana Girl and Islander.

06:35.400 --> 06:40.440

06:40.440 --> 06:45.520

09:12.400 --> 09:14.400
I'm making them wet, that's what I'm giving them now

09:14.400 --> 09:17.400
They know you're rockin' out the game when you're talkin' bout a show that's tight

09:17.400 --> 09:20.400
And tight, say you're about to go to a bath with my wife or a take

09:20.400 --> 09:22.400
What's it gonna take when the night is too bright?

09:22.400 --> 09:25.400
A little charge, a little tip, if you pass out, you might as well quit

09:25.400 --> 09:27.400
That's word because you know

09:27.400 --> 09:29.400
We can't touch this

09:30.400 --> 09:32.400
We can't touch this

10:02.400 --> 10:02.900
Here we go!

15:33.780 --> 15:35.820
You can go home to the next stage now!

15:35.820 --> 15:36.820
YAAHOO!

15:36.820 --> 15:38.820
All right!

16:00.820 --> 16:04.820
We are back from our little break and what you heard was...

16:04.820 --> 16:05.820
Yes.

16:05.820 --> 16:06.820
Bach.

16:06.820 --> 16:10.860
No, not Bach, Beethoven.

16:10.860 --> 16:14.540
What we had playing there is, to go ahead and clarify what I said, I said we were going

16:14.540 --> 16:22.380
to play a song from Dance Mania Base, and then a song from DVR Extreme, which I actually

16:22.380 --> 16:26.180
even said the name, it was Speed Over Beethoven, but the first one we played was You Can't

16:26.180 --> 16:31.540
Touch This, so it was the bass mix from Dance Mania Base 10, and then the last one we heard

16:31.540 --> 16:33.020
is Chop Chop Master Onions Rap.

16:33.020 --> 16:37.980
The first level of rapper, yay.

16:37.980 --> 16:44.820
Anyway, I'm sure that about everybody is familiar with DDR Extreme being released on Christmas

16:44.820 --> 16:45.820
Day.

16:45.820 --> 16:50.220
And we even said that we didn't think it would be, because who would have thought that it

16:50.220 --> 16:56.780
would have been so important in Japan to release a game on a holiday that's basically just

16:56.780 --> 16:59.380
a commercial holiday there, but apparently it was released.

16:59.380 --> 17:04.160
And hopefully we'll be seeing that stateside, of course, whenever we get an update of what

17:04.160 --> 17:07.560
locations have that, we'll be letting everyone know.

17:07.560 --> 17:11.680
Unfortunately, there's no official update yet.

17:11.680 --> 17:19.280
Anyway, but we've got some information on DDR Extreme, actually taken directly from

17:19.280 --> 17:20.500
a Konami site.

17:20.500 --> 17:29.420
You can find the information at www.konami.co.jp slash am slash ddr slash extreme.

17:29.420 --> 17:36.020
The new songs that are going to be in DDR Extreme, we have Cartoon Heroes Speedy Mix,

17:36.020 --> 17:43.420
I Do, I Do, I Do, Erasistabliment.

17:43.420 --> 17:44.420
It's Erasistabliment.

17:44.420 --> 17:53.060
Irresistible mint, what, okay, I, it's irresistible mint, kind of.

17:53.060 --> 17:56.260
At least the group spelled their name right, you know, wild side.

17:56.260 --> 17:57.260
Yeah, wild side, yeah.

17:57.260 --> 18:05.020
Next we have, La Copa, The Cup of Life, oh, yeah, The Cup of Life, La Copa de la Vida.

18:05.020 --> 18:09.300
Then we have Speed Over Beethoven, which I just played, Scenery to Speedy Mix, Genuom,

18:09.300 --> 18:12.380
which should make JB very, very happy.

18:12.380 --> 18:14.260
We are the champions, Factory Team Remix.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.420
I'm hoping that they didn't redo Queen.

18:16.420 --> 18:22.420
We are the champions, my friend.

18:22.420 --> 18:24.380
And then we have We Will Rock You.

18:24.380 --> 18:26.180
I guess they are going for a queen theme.

18:26.180 --> 18:27.300
I didn't think they could.

18:27.300 --> 18:33.420
And we keep on fighting to the end.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.820
Anyway, you know, I thought that it

18:35.820 --> 18:38.240
would be bad enough after that horrible version of Killer

18:38.240 --> 18:38.660
Queen.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.500
I mean, at least the music part was right,

18:40.500 --> 18:43.220
but whoever they had singing that just

18:43.220 --> 18:46.380
needed to be shot and fried or something i don't know

18:46.380 --> 18:47.500
you know

18:47.500 --> 18:51.860
no shot and then after bleeding to death at a Friday said that they believe

18:51.860 --> 18:55.580
fast-to-deep right deep fried and so that you can like even like a twenty

18:55.580 --> 18:58.840
yeah we did in the batter and then put powdered sugar on them when they're done

18:58.840 --> 19:00.180
yeah i think that's in

19:00.180 --> 19:02.140
there you go

19:02.140 --> 19:03.860
i'm sorry i don't think that's good

19:03.860 --> 19:05.700
phone record

19:05.700 --> 19:11.740
anyway and another and thing we have we had nineteen eighty eight now he uh...

19:11.740 --> 19:13.320
I don't know if anyone's seen it.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.820
There actually has been a picture floating around of a,

19:15.820 --> 19:18.960
there's a desktop available for people who have seen it

19:18.960 --> 19:20.980
of the Mecca from Brilliant to You.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.020
I actually know who happens to read my live journal.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.220
You see a picture of that Mecca that was taken

19:27.220 --> 19:29.360
from a background that was made for 1998.

19:29.740 --> 19:33.980
And then we have Bag by Revenge, Graduation.

19:34.500 --> 19:40.320
I'm not even going to bother to try reading the Hidagana

19:40.320 --> 19:42.880
because right now i can't make my brain thing in japanese

19:42.880 --> 19:45.120
but it's b for you so it's gotta suck

19:45.120 --> 19:47.400
uh...

19:47.400 --> 19:51.520
then we have hyper eurobeat and naki featuring ddr all-stars hey it's not

19:51.520 --> 19:54.840
paula terry rejoice

19:54.840 --> 19:58.500
then we have love shine um...

19:58.500 --> 20:00.280
paranoia survivor

20:00.280 --> 20:03.240
tears which is naki underground i've noticed naki underground stuff is a

20:03.240 --> 20:04.320
little bit better than

20:04.320 --> 20:05.920
the usual stuff

20:05.920 --> 20:09.840
uh... the legend of max by zz trip machine survivor

20:09.840 --> 20:11.140
more trip machine

20:11.140 --> 20:12.600
uh... yay

20:12.600 --> 20:16.540
uh... crash mister brian in the final band

20:16.540 --> 20:19.120
what happened to the band before

20:19.120 --> 20:20.140
i think they had

20:20.140 --> 20:21.380
i think they were sacked

20:21.380 --> 20:23.260
they were deep fried

20:23.260 --> 20:28.540
they were deep fried like a twinkie and eaten by cannibals

20:28.540 --> 20:31.580
just another great treat from orange land radio

20:31.580 --> 20:35.640
they were taken to the island of eyeball eating cannibals like the one who

20:35.640 --> 20:39.160
stole my animal crossings in a character's eyes.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.160
But that was last week.

20:41.160 --> 20:45.320
Um, we have, ah, sorry.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.400
Paul Terry.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.920
Mesa Comeback.

20:47.920 --> 20:50.320
At least Memories isn't a bad song, and she sort of holds

20:50.320 --> 20:51.400
the key there.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.760
She usually doesn't.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.800
Then we have Vanity Angel, which we've, uh, probably

20:54.800 --> 20:55.720
played on here before.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.760
If not, I'll see if I can sneak that in later.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.880
AM3P303 bass mix, which we've all heard if we bought

21:01.880 --> 21:03.240
economics.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.000
Cutie Chaser morning mix.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
And it's the good one. This is the one from Ohasta.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
Do It Right.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
We have a Do It Right harmonized two-step mix.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
From the American Max.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Yes, from the American Max.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
We have Drop The Bomb System SF mix.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Pretty cool that we got these songs before Japan did, don't you think?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Yeah, actually, that's really cool.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
It's because we kick ass.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
That's fucking right.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.840
But then again, you know, they had everything first and we had to wait.

21:36.840 --> 21:41.160
It's about time. It's about time we got something. It's kind of like the Bay Area versus Sacramento.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.320
Yeah, we have Apestyle now, we're happy, and we have it on a nice

21:44.320 --> 21:46.640
plasma screen.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.800
Were the videos actually work? Yes, the videos work too.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.820
I was rather enjoying looking at some of those videos, weren't you?

21:52.820 --> 21:56.240
Oh yes, yes, the videos were quite enjoyable, except for

21:56.240 --> 21:59.280
like Dancer. No one to Barbie. Yeah.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.400
Anyways.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.480
Back to the list.

22:01.480 --> 22:07.340
We have Kind Lady, which was the bonus song in DDR Max for Japanese PS2.

22:07.340 --> 22:11.680
Of course, it was one of the standard songs in DDR Max US.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.200
We have So In Love, which is the other one.

22:14.200 --> 22:20.000
We have, from 2DX, we have A, Colors for Extreme.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.480
I guess that's probably a redone version just for DDR.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.960
We have Happy Wedding, which makes me happy.

22:23.960 --> 22:27.480
All of that song's balls can die for all I care.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.480
What, Happy Wedding?

22:28.480 --> 22:29.480
Yes.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.480
Why?

22:30.480 --> 22:37.480
letting me die happy

22:37.480 --> 22:40.340
has a problem with that for a different reason uh...

22:40.340 --> 22:44.000
let me actually pass off the mic for a second

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
going on with the list we have uh...

22:46.000 --> 22:48.080
the more and i live but uh...

22:48.080 --> 22:52.440
which uh... is actually a d r version of uh...

22:52.440 --> 22:57.380
it's a a d r version of the two d x song that was on seven style

22:57.380 --> 23:01.040
and then we have stoic extreme version currently they're doing a whole new

23:01.040 --> 23:04.220
version again that's another 2dx song

23:04.220 --> 23:06.600
there's V for extreme

23:06.600 --> 23:08.480
uh... V

23:08.480 --> 23:10.260
most people know what V is

23:10.260 --> 23:13.680
uh... that's coming from 5th style

23:13.680 --> 23:15.840
and I have no idea what that song is

23:15.840 --> 23:20.080
I have no idea cause it's in the...

23:20.080 --> 23:24.120
Go translate that for me Jamie

23:24.120 --> 23:26.380
you know what we're going to do something here it's going to take us

23:26.380 --> 23:29.420
just a minute to go ahead and act

23:29.420 --> 23:31.740
no better fish something better

23:31.740 --> 23:34.700
i'm sorry for whoever just dropped my bad

23:34.700 --> 23:35.360
uh...

23:35.360 --> 23:39.160
the

23:39.160 --> 23:41.060
it

23:41.060 --> 23:42.820
we love you anyway

23:42.820 --> 23:44.940
we're going to a little fight called a

23:44.940 --> 23:45.820
uh...

23:45.820 --> 23:49.940
at nifty global gates and this is a really good little translation site

23:49.940 --> 23:54.720
We're going to do this to translate all of that lovely kanji that, you know, I can't

23:54.720 --> 23:56.920
read because I can only read five kanji.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.520
No, I read about 40 kanji, maybe.

24:00.520 --> 24:03.560
Anyway, back to, was this the one?

24:03.560 --> 24:04.560
Yeah.

24:04.560 --> 24:08.260
Okay, it's a Naoki song featuring Yuki and, by the way, Chat Room, I'm not really paying

24:08.260 --> 24:14.560
attention because I sort of have to manage the show, my bad.

24:14.560 --> 24:15.560
And that's incorrect.

24:15.560 --> 24:16.560
But that's not a URL.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.560
No, it's not a URL.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.560
God damn.

24:18.560 --> 24:22.980
Damn. Okay, this is lovely radio.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.200
Okay, it means a blue impulse.

24:26.700 --> 24:31.060
A blue impulse, it's better than, you know, like a white, creamy one.

24:31.420 --> 24:34.020
Thank you, Nostellan, for announcing your bathroom break, by the way.

24:34.480 --> 24:45.260

kanji as being a three but we're gonna go ahead and run that through translator

24:59.620 --> 25:11.660
as well cuz we have tortoise shell cat lock which tortoise shell cat lock this

25:11.660 --> 25:16.020
That's what it translates to.

25:16.020 --> 25:21.380
And then the group that does it is called Subtropical Muzzy Ska Bomb.

25:21.380 --> 25:25.920

25:25.920 --> 25:30.860
The next songs that we have on the list, we have from Mamba A Go Go, we have Gamelan

28:42.540 --> 28:45.020
And you haven't seen anything that's on a you know

28:45.940 --> 28:47.820
DDR max so

28:47.820 --> 28:49.980
Enjoy your little box there anyway

28:49.980 --> 28:57.040
We're posting this in the in the chat room for everybody to see and there you go. There's the link so uh

28:57.040 --> 29:06.040
So, uh, what's new, uh, new outs in the Bemani world? Anybody wanna have a go?

29:06.040 --> 29:07.040
Don't look at me.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.040
I need to...

29:09.040 --> 29:11.040
Talk about the tournament.

29:11.040 --> 29:23.040
Oh, talk about the tournament. Okay, um, I guess there's a tournament and, um, it's the 11th of January. There's a tournament at Fremont. Was it Ardenwood?

29:23.040 --> 29:24.040
Funtime Pizza.

29:24.040 --> 29:28.240
It's Funtime Pizza in Fremont and if you're, you know, in the Bay Area or in

29:28.240 --> 29:33.500
Sacramento area or anywhere in NorCal you probably know where it is. I believe

29:33.500 --> 29:40.560
it's around, I believe it starts around 11 or noon. You can check out the details.

29:40.560 --> 29:49.040
There's a thread on it on ddrfreak.com and you can get linked to the Killer

29:49.040 --> 29:52.160
pals site which is who is putting this on.

29:52.160 --> 30:00.920
So it's looking like it's going to have perfect attack and freestyle and then also freshness

30:00.920 --> 30:07.920
freestyle which is basically something kind of from the shaft A-team freestyle type of

30:07.920 --> 30:08.920
thing.

30:08.920 --> 30:12.000
So it should be a good time on that.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.840
I would imagine that your best bet though would be to get the information from the site

30:15.840 --> 30:20.660
because I'm just remembering what I can remember off the top of my head but

30:20.660 --> 30:27.600
Jamie is getting us set for our next break and she's trying to find some neat

30:27.600 --> 30:33.920
stuff we're actually taking over taking over the airwaves because we've decided

30:33.920 --> 30:40.040
that you know there's just not enough Korean stuff in this world seriously

30:40.040 --> 30:44.000
there's just not enough good Korean stuff in this world so we're gonna force

30:44.000 --> 30:47.600
you to sit there and suffer through some Korean stuff.

30:47.600 --> 30:50.520
So we present to you, Korean Time.

30:50.520 --> 30:56.280
Yes, it's big booty fun here on our results radio.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.120
I'm going to play what I have immediately available, but you never know.

30:59.120 --> 31:04.860
I might be playing, you know, even more bootylicious stuff here during one of our upcoming breaks.

31:04.860 --> 31:07.660
So we're going to get a break to gather ourselves.

31:07.660 --> 31:12.600
So the first thing you get is Tashani with Gungo, also known as Caution, and please don't

31:12.600 --> 31:18.900
Caution drop in your chair because you could break it it would hurt a lot. So here goes

32:12.600 --> 32:22.600

35:53.600 --> 35:55.600

35:55.600 --> 35:56.600
Gotta drop that

35:56.600 --> 35:58.600
In the bowl with your name in the back

35:58.600 --> 35:59.600
You can say what for?

35:59.600 --> 36:01.600

36:01.600 --> 36:03.600

43:06.440 --> 43:08.440
You're cool and I'm trying to stay away

Stay away from me

43:10.440 --> 43:12.440
Time for me to work

43:13.440 --> 43:15.440
Don't hesitate anyway

43:15.440 --> 43:16.440
Thanks

43:16.440 --> 43:17.440
Oh

43:17.440 --> 43:18.440
Oh

43:18.440 --> 43:19.440
Oh

43:19.440 --> 43:20.440
Oh

44:20.440 --> 44:27.440
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join

44:30.740 --> 44:35.460
us on all the fun together. Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come

44:35.460 --> 44:39.860
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to, and still the fun is just as great.

44:39.860 --> 44:44.700
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me, and you just might realize the

44:44.700 --> 44:46.700
the best things in life are free.

45:14.700 --> 45:17.500
and also going to be in the extreme vanity angel

45:17.500 --> 45:21.100
and then, just for the hell of it, Erotic with

45:21.100 --> 45:27.220
Naxx don't have sex with your ex. So, that was it. We went ahead and did a little bit of

45:27.220 --> 45:31.000
research on new releases in the Vemani world. We also have the release of

45:31.000 --> 45:32.180
Papa Music 9

45:32.180 --> 45:35.260
which I actually can't exactly find a date on but there

45:35.260 --> 45:39.300
is some new stuff being incorporated into that game.

45:39.300 --> 45:44.620
According to the official Konami Papa Music 9, there's a

45:44.620 --> 45:49.900
a few new modes introduced. I actually just posted a link to that page in the chat, though.

45:49.900 --> 45:53.700
Unless you're fluent in Japanese or have a good translation program, you won't be able

45:53.700 --> 45:58.940
to really make any understanding of it. But one of the things that they mentioned in there

45:58.940 --> 46:06.100
is called Osasume Mode, which is basically easy mode. You're given an option when you

46:06.100 --> 46:13.100
start the game to say yes or no, and you can basically play the first level as bad as you

46:13.100 --> 46:16.860
want to without failing, which is good for the newbies, I guess.

46:16.860 --> 46:21.940
And then another neat thing, and they've actually got a few of the cards shown on the site,

46:21.940 --> 46:23.740
memory cards for pop and music.

46:23.740 --> 46:28.380
I guess it works similar to the ones in the initial deracing game in Derby Owners Club

46:28.380 --> 46:33.500
for all the crack, sorry, horse addicts, I should say.

46:33.500 --> 46:40.780
Like somebody in this room that I'm not looking directly at and pointing to, and another person.

46:40.780 --> 46:47.180
But apparently you can save your settings or game data on the card.

46:47.180 --> 46:51.300
I could read this in the really bad Engrish that my translator put it.

46:51.300 --> 46:57.180
Well, just to give this a skim over, it basically says that you can save an expert course, the

46:57.180 --> 46:59.620
one that you design yourself.

46:59.620 --> 47:04.300
And it says that it is convenient and the game becomes pleasant further, even if it

47:04.300 --> 47:09.760
takes right or wrong an entry card using playing.

47:09.760 --> 47:14.540
What automatic registration will be made to the Internet ranking if it plays using a pop

47:14.540 --> 47:17.080
and music nine entry card?

47:17.080 --> 47:18.080
And.

47:18.080 --> 47:22.480
Yes, I am reading.

47:22.480 --> 47:26.080
I am reading directly from the page here.

47:26.080 --> 47:29.120
Actually, it says, uh, hata, and.

47:29.120 --> 47:31.800
Anyway, so, uh, there's some new options.

47:31.800 --> 47:35.700
You know, wouldn't it be cool if they did that for DDR, or, you know, let you program

47:35.700 --> 47:41.320
your own Oni courses at home and then bring your card in and play it on the

47:41.320 --> 47:42.320
machine?

47:42.320 --> 47:45.880
I mean what type of stuff would you pick?

47:45.880 --> 47:50.540
Well I'm thinking it might be even better because we already have memory card slots

47:50.540 --> 47:55.920
that we use regularly that we have to actually pay for ourselves.

47:55.920 --> 48:00.980
It would just be this great technology out there right now with this type of card system

48:00.980 --> 48:04.440
that they're just now starting to get into with Konami.

48:04.440 --> 48:10.220
It's cheap, you just toss in a buck or whatever and it pays for the card and it saves everything

48:10.220 --> 48:11.220
for you.

48:11.220 --> 48:14.000
I mean, why the heck not use it?

48:14.000 --> 48:18.280
Saves from having to have big huge expensive memory card slots, instead you just have a

48:18.280 --> 48:21.840
card reader and that's it.

48:21.840 --> 48:24.600
What they used to have though, back in the day, I don't know if anyone ever watched the

48:24.600 --> 48:25.600
old game...

48:25.600 --> 48:30.920
I think it was the Game Pro show they used to call on that had that guy hosting, anyway.

48:30.920 --> 48:36.880
They had, when they were showing the Neo Geo system, way back when, the cartridge system,

48:36.880 --> 48:41.600
which you see those big things, those are Neo Geo cartridges, they're huge.

48:41.600 --> 48:47.340
They're basically the arcade game, and they had a card that you could take and put in

48:47.340 --> 48:54.880
on the Neo Geo arcade system, come home and play the same game on your AES, and you could

48:54.880 --> 49:00.240
start from where you left off in theory, but it's hard to find any of those that still

49:00.240 --> 49:04.440
occasionally if you look at the... are you okay?

49:04.440 --> 49:05.920
I'm sorry about the chair

49:05.920 --> 49:08.920
I have a chair in here that's trying to systematically kill Ross

49:08.920 --> 49:12.760
my bad

49:12.760 --> 49:14.560
are you... are you...

49:14.560 --> 49:17.200
he's straddling the chair

49:17.200 --> 49:23.080
no this isn't liked by his girlfriend's suggestion

49:23.080 --> 49:25.440
anyway um...

49:25.440 --> 49:29.420
I was suggesting you know keep an eye open for those Neo Geo machines and you can see

49:29.420 --> 49:33.520
this card slots on them but you know they could do that same thing it's like

49:33.520 --> 49:37.580
you were saying if they're cheap if they brought out a new a home system that

49:37.580 --> 49:41.640
incorporated those little cards you could save your data that way too yeah

49:41.640 --> 49:48.720
JD Roth thank you that's who it was no he was he did fun house yeah yeah he

49:48.720 --> 49:57.560
was jd watch it fun house no it was another guy who went on to do other

49:57.560 --> 50:03.600
stuff but anyway um excuse me but no um you know this cards they've been using

50:03.600 --> 50:07.520
them for a while it's just no one has made real use of them until you know

50:07.520 --> 50:14.680
just recently with uh you know again no not in sex wars initial D JD Roth in sex

50:14.680 --> 50:22.800
wars according to a vidpower anyway uh no we're not having mr. spanky's

50:22.800 --> 50:33.560
masturbation party anyway uh no miss okay mr. spanky if I mentioned what mr.

50:33.560 --> 50:42.000
spanky is mr. spanky comes on and gives sex tips on our show oh yeah he told us

50:42.000 --> 50:48.680
how to have a masturbation party make sure you have plenty of latex that earned

50:48.680 --> 50:55.940
to burp from Jessica yeah the neo2 also has an outlet that you can plug your

50:55.940 --> 51:02.540
headphones in that that burp was brought to brought to us uh just for Travis from

51:02.540 --> 51:15.140
Jessica as a token of her extreme belching anyway Oh heaven forbid that I

51:15.140 --> 51:23.900
I make anybody think about anything, but back to the subject at hand, Konami is finally

51:23.900 --> 51:24.900
incorporating this.

51:24.900 --> 51:29.060
What if they start doing this for 2DX?

51:29.060 --> 51:34.900
I don't see how any way there is right now for them to be able to do that with the PS2

51:34.900 --> 51:37.340
unless they made a separate reader.

51:37.340 --> 51:40.660
Then again, the GameCube technically uses those cards too because they have the e-card

51:40.660 --> 51:44.740
reader that you use for Animal Crossing.

51:44.740 --> 51:49.900
You buy the pack of e-cards, and you hook up your Game Boy Advance to your GameCube,

51:49.900 --> 51:55.780
and inside of the little bank post office place, you go up to the e-reader and talk

51:55.780 --> 51:59.260
to it, and you can slide the cards across, and they'll send you items.

51:59.260 --> 52:02.940
So technically, the GameCube has a way to read those cards.

52:02.940 --> 52:10.580
And if they could do it that way, there's no reason that Konami should be able to do

52:10.580 --> 52:11.580
that.

52:11.580 --> 52:17.420
for the Wonderswan and have the Wonderswan compatible with the PS2, that would make them

52:17.420 --> 52:18.700
some money right there.

52:18.700 --> 52:23.900
But it's a thought, think about it Konami, and then again like anyone in Konami is actually

52:23.900 --> 52:32.500
listening to us right now, well let's go ahead and get on to everyone's favorite part of

52:32.500 --> 52:36.880
the show, we'll get along to the Fuck You's of the Week, unfortunately I can't play any

52:36.880 --> 52:41.100
happy music while we're doing this just because of how my mixer is, which is going to probably

52:41.100 --> 52:46.820
So we're going to go to a little break right now.

52:46.820 --> 52:53.340
So go ahead and send me a PM with what your, you know, suggestions for things that need

52:53.340 --> 52:57.100
to be fucked are.

52:57.100 --> 53:01.300
And remember, I'm not going to read anything unless it's over a private message, and go

53:01.300 --> 53:09.340
ahead and you can email that to orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com, which is all up and ready for me to check on.

53:09.340 --> 53:16.340
So, I'll tell you what. Even though, um, I can't, you know, play it while we're actually

53:16.580 --> 53:23.580
doing the, uh, the Fuck You's of the Week, we're gonna pick songs for everyone's Fuck

53:24.340 --> 53:28.320
You's of the Week, but because I'm special, I'm gonna go ahead and pick mine, because

53:28.320 --> 53:32.260
I always use the same song every week. Um, we'll go ahead and get this started, and the

53:32.260 --> 53:38.020
next song we're gonna pick is Jessica's song. It's a surprise, though. She gets a song,

53:38.020 --> 53:42.580
then we'll have Ross's pick and then we'll come back so everybody starts sending me the

53:42.580 --> 53:46.660
FUs of the week and if you don't send them I don't read them because I can't read something

53:46.660 --> 53:49.900
that doesn't exist.

53:49.900 --> 53:50.900
You can make it up.

53:50.900 --> 53:51.900
You can make one up though.

53:51.900 --> 53:56.340
Well I can make one up but anyway let's go ahead and get this started so send them now

53:56.340 --> 54:00.680
Yes now now now now now now now now five minutes ago

54:26.340 --> 54:33.340
This is the end of the video, thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

57:56.340 --> 57:57.340
Die

57:59.340 --> 58:04.340
Die

58:04.340 --> 58:07.340
When you say it's true, say it's me, I love you

58:07.340 --> 58:09.340
I just can't resist

58:10.340 --> 58:13.340
Looking in the eyes, knowing you're not blind

58:13.340 --> 58:18.340
I am a secret law

58:19.340 --> 58:22.340
There is no one else who gives you a touch

58:22.340 --> 58:24.840
I've come back to be with you

58:25.840 --> 58:27.340
Can you please come back, baby?

58:27.340 --> 58:28.340
Come back, baby

58:28.340 --> 58:30.840
Remember all that I can do

58:30.840 --> 58:33.840
When I go out into the night

58:33.840 --> 58:36.840
Everything seems to go right

58:36.840 --> 58:38.840
Oh, you're in my arms

58:38.840 --> 58:40.340
Fill me with the truth

58:40.340 --> 58:41.840
I can't stand on you now

58:41.840 --> 58:44.340
Oh, forevermore

58:44.340 --> 58:46.840
Diva Diva, can't stop the feeling

58:46.840 --> 58:49.840
Baby, when we're making sweet dreams

58:49.840 --> 58:53.840
Deep or deep, then we flew apart

58:53.840 --> 58:56.840
A time that hits your heart

58:57.840 --> 58:58.840
I die

58:58.840 --> 59:00.840
In here

59:00.840 --> 59:01.840
In here

59:01.840 --> 59:03.840
In here

59:03.840 --> 59:08.840
Ah

59:10.840 --> 59:12.840
Taking on, then

59:12.840 --> 59:15.840
Tell me once again

59:15.840 --> 59:20.840
We will sail away

59:20.840 --> 59:25.840
Even deeper emotions flowing like an arrow falling

59:25.840 --> 59:28.840
Stay still, deeper, deeper, deeper

59:28.840 --> 59:31.840
Running in your bones

59:31.840 --> 59:33.840
Even deeper, deeper, deeper

59:33.840 --> 59:34.840
Even deeper, deeper, deeper

59:34.840 --> 59:37.840
My heart is turning with no tension

59:37.840 --> 59:39.840
Making no moment

59:39.840 --> 59:43.840
Even deeper, slowly, how I feel

59:43.840 --> 59:45.840
I've never been to your home

59:45.840 --> 59:50.840
I can't break into your heart

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.160
We will make it through the day

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.600
What we gotta do is build more momentum

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.360
If you need the right tools and best of pride

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.160
The way it's not countin' the rhythm of the market

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.160
It's just we got to get with it

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.680
We're made in the center of your almighty mind

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.520
We can do it now, you're not just mango power

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.080
Yeah, it's all ready to kick that ball

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.400
You can make me call to drop the ball

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.640
Yeah, yeah, drop the ball

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.880
To drop the ball

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.040
Let me see that ball

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:55.800
If you need a right to a plan, then to the right, the way to spend time, see the rhythm, the mark, the system, don't get with it

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.920
The way to consider it, all by your heart, if you do it now, you're less than time, don't follow

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.200
Yeah, the rage to take that fall, and it's up to you to make that call

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:36.600
I'm a

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.600
I'm

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.600
I'm

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.600
I'm

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.600
I'm

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.600
I'm

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.600
I'm

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:05.600
...

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.600
...

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.600
...

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.600
...

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:25.600
...

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.600
uh...

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:35.600
uh...

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:40.600
uh...

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.600
uh...

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:44.200
Yes, this break was brought to you by The Swedish Chef.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.140
of course that

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:47.340
tack with the fact that children

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:52.680
and do that make we played my uh... the music shlug work cuz this is fucked up

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.720
and then uh...

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.720
justice requested that

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.400
trace

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.480
the traces

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.960
yeah i was attacked attack

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.320
and then um... even the policy areas officially banned from orange and radio

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.400
until you know they're on the poetry

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.040
i love all three you girl

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.440
even though she can't hold hold it in the favor life

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.340
Go ahead, marry her, see if I care.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.840
Why would anybody want to?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.040
She's actually a, she looks anorexic and can't sing.

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.540
But we've gone off on Polteri before.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.460
This is not the fuck you Polteri show.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:27.640
No.

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:28.120
Good.

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:34.320
We also had the remix from DDR USA, Drop the Bomb.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.060
We had Tack with QQQ, again, the psycho duck children.

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:44.300
Anyway, we are, you know, because for some reason I can't play music in the background

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:51.620
of my, of my show, yeah, while we're using the microphone because of the mixer on here.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.540
Yeah, don't Mary Polteri, she's ugly.

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:55.540
Mary?

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.540
Any...

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.540
She's not very Mary.

01:04:58.540 --> 01:04:59.540
Maple?

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.540
M-A-R-R-Y.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:05.960
Yeah, she's unhappy.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:13.320
unhappy because we hate her. Um, sorry. Um, anyway, but I can't really play the music

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:18.580
over, you know, with the microphone, so we get the silent fuck-yous of the week. They're

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:24.300
a moment of silence in honor of being angsty. Anyway, my, um, my fuck-yous of the week,

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:28.920
you know, I don't really feel very bad. I mean, true, the other host went to SoCal without

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:37.060
But that's okay, even though I had work and I was bored, it's okay.

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:47.540
I was just really, really alone, and I got peanuts for Christmas, which were nice peanuts,

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:48.540
they were quite tasty.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.540
And I got lots of chocolate.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.540
I got peanuts.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.540
I got nuts too.

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.540
You got nuts?

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.540
I got nuts.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:54.540
Were your nuts salty?

01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:55.540
Actually, yeah.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.540
Actually, they were fancy.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:04.140
they're fancy yeah fancy nuts mm-hmm anyway um other than that you know

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:11.500
there's not really you know I'm pretty pretty happy I think oh oh fuck you to

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:16.020
the eight-star machine for breaking my nail but it's sort of a not really

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:25.340
because I got to play it and we have ours yes I have a I have had a cry but

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:29.500
But it was actually pretty nice to have that.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:33.220
I'll also fuck you to cheese.

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:38.880
We went to Old Spaghetti Factory, and they put a lot of cheese on their food.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.820
This is what I had.

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:44.820
I had garlic cheese bread with cheese.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.180
I had butter on my bread.

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:53.020
I had cheese and spinach ravioli with Alfredo sauce covered in cheese, but mithril cheese,

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.020
by the way.

01:06:54.020 --> 01:07:04.320
But first time I saw it, I read it as mithril cheese, made by the elves, who'd pawned their

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.660
own mother to have it themselves.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:14.140
And then I had ice cream and the cream soda.

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:19.380
We were in the freeway going to Scandia when I realized that I really had to go to the

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.380
bathroom.

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:27.380
Fuck you to lactose intolerance.

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:32.700
Which then spawned fun parappa. Which then had us going into the parappa funky flow.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:38.460
Anyway, let's uh, how about your FUs of the week?

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:41.660
I'm actually very

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:44.660
like normal this week so, um,

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:49.180
I have an FU from last week,

01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:52.980
maybe I could do that one. F.U. to everybody

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:56.100
who waits until the last fucking minute to do their

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:59.500
their Christmas shopping because they make

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:03.220
people who are in retail's lives hell

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:08.980
not to mention, I have a resounding yay from downstairs

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:12.660
not to mention when poor people are working in phone centers

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:16.580
and having to deal with fucking FedEx to get the packages out

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:20.980
I have a massive f-you to FedEx for the fact that they completely and totally

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.700
understaffed themselves

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:25.900
for the entire holiday season. They're stupid asses.

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.700
Fuck them in their stupid asses, big piles of feces, TM.

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:33.060
And all that fun crap.

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:36.340
Um, and f-you to the coin slot on 8th style,

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:40.300
but it's not really a nephew because I love the machine and it's pretty and it's

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.860
five minutes from my house, so meh!

01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:46.460
Um, Ross? No, none. You're boring.

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:51.460
I can't think of anything. No, I love everybody really you're full of shit

01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:56.880
Just guess just ask maple. Isn't that right? Maple's full of shit, too

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.740
Whatever

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:07.660
We can have Jessica step on your toe. Yeah, then I could say I have an F you yeah

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:11.980
then you could say you're sleeping on the couch

01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:19.060
do we have a moment of silence

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:23.260
in honor of that phrase

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:27.260
I think we've gotten most of the crap out of our system let's go ahead

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:31.460
I think you got props

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:35.140
anyway let's go ahead and

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:40.220
We actually have a new person in our chat room, but we'll go ahead and give a shout

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:41.140
to our new person in a minute.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:46.260
Let's go ahead and read the FUs of the week from our lovely,

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:48.280
lovely and talented listeners.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:54.140
First one we have Dark Tetsuya, FU to not having FUs.

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:58.580
That was eloquent.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.300
Next we have DVR Angel.

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.340
My F.U. this week goes to DVRMax2Machine at Rohnert Park.

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:09.820
Scandia, again, we're not taking tokens and the people that work there that are too lazy

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:14.300
to fix it and say they're technicians that come in at 5pm need to fix it and not them.

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.100
Didn't I get that from RVGL?

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.580
That was my F.U. of the week last week, which I'm not even going to get into because they're

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:23.180
still pissing me off.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:28.100
Next we have 23Rangas who says, big if you to my bed, or his bed, not my bed.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.100
My bed's cool.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.100
I have a California king.

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:35.420
Anyway, F you to his bed for causing great neck pain while still looking so fluffy and

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.780
squishy and super sleepy time-ish.

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:43.460
F you to learning pada-pada because damn I can't learn a pada while I'll glean the all-stars.

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:47.540
F you to met commander 2 for being too easy and a giant F you to a CD clock radio for

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:51.820
not wanting to read my Beeeemani CD out.

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:54.740
And that was it from him.

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:59.980
By the way, we now have people in here doing pada-pada in their chair, you know, just doing

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:01.580
uh... yesterday

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:04.620
now we're doing boom and fire

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:06.020

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.300
tuning in um...

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.180
i feed the people who hog new ddr machines and refuse to give others a try

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:19.640
who go out of their way just to see it god that's true

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.380
we didn't do that today

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:23.980
we waited our turn

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.080
even though

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.220
it was 2dx and i wanted to hug it and kiss it and love it and take it home and call it george

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:38.220
But, no. People need to wait in line, and, you know, have you noticed, is it just me, or have people just learned, you know, forgotten what a coin line is?

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:39.220
You know?

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:42.220
Mm-hmm. Oh, I know. Ugh, it's so nice.

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:52.220
Um, we have, uh, vidpower next. Um, F.U. to Free Time, because I need more of it. F.U. to Classical Speed for only being 30 minutes, because it's got such great songs, there needs to be more of it.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.220
Classical speed was interesting.

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:59.220
Um, FU to not being able to pick out more happy hardcore CDs because I can't find any at the music store.

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:05.220
Oh, and FU to Rob's OL auto-schedule since it won't play the OL rewind on Thursday afternoons.

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:47.260
I have a special F.U. of the Week from Sharks Girl.

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:52.440
Actually, it's an F.U. from her and Mel B.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.160
It's for Jingle from Animal Crossing.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.820
He is such a bitch to find.

01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:57.700
And then you go and try to find a present for him.

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:00.700
And Mel's only got one present in the hour and a half he's

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.620
been trying.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.020
Friggin' punk ass reindeer.

01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:06.260
He gets a F.U. of the Week.

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:09.780
Mel says he wishes Grandma would run over Jingle.

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:13.600
So, that's from Sharkshkurl who, you know, both of them have been,

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.520
I guess, on the show before, a couple of times.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:28.580
The other one we have is from a, OK, I'm going to be kind of dumb, Scott Kaplan.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.280
OK. I mean, I'm not sure what nickname.

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:37.660
Anyway, so therefore, he says, fuck my friend and his dad

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:42.140
first DSL ruining the dial-up internet on the laptop for three days which was

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:47.200
over the period of the show time so I missed the show and life sucked and fuck

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:51.400
his posture cuz it sucks and birthday for being on a Monday and having to have

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:58.260
a party on Sunday night oh we're gonna get to another fuck you from Jessica and

01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:01.780
missing the show so fuck that and one more fuck projects over break because

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:05.660
that destroys the whole break thing and they should just die yes teachers just

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:09.660
I just don't realize I need the time for relaxing stuff when projects make it sucky. Boo on teachers.

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:13.660
Yeah, boo. Boo hiss.

01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:17.660
Jessica has another... fuck you? Let's go ahead and pass the mic back.

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:21.660
This is a mini FU for people

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:25.660
who try to schedule things on other people's birthdays. You know who?

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:29.660
The person I'm talking to knows this one.

01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:33.660
And I love you, man. But that sucked.

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:43.660
Anyways, I'm trying to fix it, and I guess you'll be invited when it gets taken care of, but, um, yeah, there you go.

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:50.660
That would just suck having an important event scheduled on your birthday, wouldn't it?

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:51.660
Yes.

01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:55.660
Yeah, that person just needs to be ashamed.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.660
That person needs all of his balls to die.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:02.620
I don't know if you heard that person, but apparently all your balls need to die

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:07.340
But you're still you're still loved you're still loved

01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.500
Whoever you are oh

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:13.180
We have another F you the week from black web

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:17.940
Fuck headaches slept too long under the influence of painkillers and

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:21.360
Fuck his girlfriend's little cousin for trying to kill him last night

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:27.420
You know someone tried to kill me I'd want to say fuck you to them too and fuck oyster. I hate it

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:28.940

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:53.300
these things are more important

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:57.220
like having F.U.s written to you

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.980

my

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:11.420
uh...

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:15.940

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:19.140
which is our our crack in this house

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:20.840
so uh...

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.620
you know what i can't think of anything to say right now

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.500
i'm being honest with you also i'm gonna go to break

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.580
because i have to be

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.220
we want a special song

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:32.780
i'll tell you what we're going to go ahead and uh...

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:36.660
play a song for everybody listening um...

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:39.380
which and i'm going to apologize because this is uh...

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:43.180
off the cd so if it doesn't there may be a moment of silence while trying to get

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.620
it to actually work

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:48.980
so i apologize if that ends up being the case um...

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:53.020
what i'm going to play is a song that has been heard in

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.740
actually the home version of uh... beatmania 2dx that's uh...

01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:59.060
it's no six dot one thing it's not

01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:02.860
but it's been in a seven style and uh... eight style uh...

01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:06.780
should play the remix of just the regular long play the remix that's

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.300
this is the remix version of uh...

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:13.220
beautiful days and uh... it may take me a moment to get this uh... up and running

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:13.960
but

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.660
you know be patient with us

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:22.660
and thank you for doing so

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:58.660
Looking back when I was a child and me Grossing my charity would come to me

01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:06.660
Having free things made me free and free away

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:10.660
Looking back when I was a child and dreamed

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:14.660
More than a journey would call to me

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:16.660
Everything that would set me free

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:21.660
And fly away to everywhere

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:27.660
I can get at them

01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:31.660
I can get at them

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:05.660
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful day

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:14.660
After all I've come to be alone

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:21.660
You are feeling down from me

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:27.660
Is this what I need?

01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:05.660
Not if it takes anything to find a way to end

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:10.660
I'm good by anything

01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:16.660
I'm good on running around

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:22.660
I'm always giving up

01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:28.660
Even when I'm looking back when I wasn't trying to win

01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:32.660
You're so much better if you come to me

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:39.660
Don't lose the things that make me feel right away

01:21:39.660 --> 01:22:01.220
When you walk away, you don't hear me say, Please, oh baby, don't go simple and sweet

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:06.920
There's no way that you're making me feel tonight

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:10.220
It's hard to let it go

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:18.220
You're giving me

01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:22.220
Too many things

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.220
Lately

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:28.220
You're all I need

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:34.220
Oh, you smiled at me and said

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:37.220
Don't get me wrong, I love you

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:42.220
But does that mean I have to meet your father?

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:48.220
When we are older, you'll understand what I meant

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:56.220
When I said no, I don't think life is quite that simple

01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:01.220
You walk away, you don't hear me say

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:07.220
Please, oh baby, don't go

01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:15.220
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight

01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:18.220
It's hard to let go

01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:23.220
So simple and clean

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:39.220
The daily things like this that keep us all busy are confusing me

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:45.220
That's when you came to me and said

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:51.220
I wish I could prove I love you but does that mean I have to walk

01:23:51.220 --> 01:24:02.220
When we are older, you'll understand It's enough when I say so

01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:12.220
And maybe some things are that simple When you walk away, you don't hear me say

01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:20.220
Say, please, oh baby, don't go simple and clean

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:26.220
And the way that you're making me feel tonight

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:29.220
It's hard to let it go

01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:36.220
Hold me, whatever I feel this morning

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:39.220
It is a little later on

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:48.220
Regardless of warning, the future doesn't scare me at all

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:51.220
Nothing's like before

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:56.220
You walk away, you don't hear me say

01:24:56.220 --> 01:25:00.220
Please, oh baby

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:03.220
Don't go simple and clean

01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:09.220
It's the way that you're making me feel tonight

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.220
It's hard to let it go

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.220
Hold me

01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:19.220
Whatever life feels this morning

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.220
It is a little bit wrong

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:25.220
Regardless of warning

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:31.220
The future doesn't scare me at all

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:36.220
Nothing can keep or hold me

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:41.220
Whatever I feel this morning

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:44.220
Is a little later on

01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:47.220
Regardless of warning

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:52.220
The future doesn't scare me at all

01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:57.220
Nothing could be more

01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:24.220
Oh yeah

01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.220
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio

01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:58.440
uh...

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.600
discussion about marble madness 2

And hiccup, and then I burp, and then I hiccup, and then I burp, and then I hiccup and I burp.

01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:33.460
We have hiccuping and burping.

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:36.580
It looks like we actually have some discussion going on about old school games in here.

01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:43.700
Of course, 23rd Omega says, telling us about the Guardian Legend, of course, which is my

01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.820
favorite nintendo game ever

01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:49.820
we had votes for marble madness

01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:53.180

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:56.300
but maybe we'll do two

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:59.860
so we'll uh... why don't we actually let's go ahead and start our first one

01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:02.140
why don't we

01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:06.340

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.420

to give uh... to get rid of jessica's hiccups

01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.860

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:42.100
to get rid of Jessica's hiccups

01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:46.780
that would be scary enough to kill people

01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:48.300
uh...

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:51.700

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:21.800
that's disturbing

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.700
wow

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:26.420
no she would be the dildo

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:29.500
she's that dildo

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:31.340
See, I've never seen a picture of her, so I don't know.

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:32.220
She's ugly.

01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:35.180
She's very ugly.

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:38.860
The 250 BPM Satan fetus is pretty scary.

01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:40.500
I would not play that song for ages

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:41.700
because of the Satan fetus.

01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:43.220
That's how I forged you.

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:46.500
Foam bat porn.

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.100
Blink, blink, dot, dot, dot.

01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:50.100
It's not foam bats.

01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:51.140
It's plastic bats.

01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:52.460
Plastic bat.

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:53.360
Get it right.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.060
It's plastic, and it's orange, and it's

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:56.780
been signed by practically everybody now.

01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:58.420
I think my hiccups went away.

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:03.040
her hiccups went away! Yay!

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:03.780
AHH!

01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:06.360
Leave it to Travis for, you know, the worst one.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.940
Travis did come up with the worst one

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:10.700
and I got a random

01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.040
message from...

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.180
Some idiot.

01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:16.840
Yeah, some idiot.

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:20.020
So, um...

01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:22.720
well, why don't we go ahead and try to do a list?

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:23.220
You know?

01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:25.320
A true Ike seem to be playing like...

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:26.360
Just ignore the person.

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:33.360
tens and tens and tens and tens of music the whole time

01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:38.260
uh...

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.980
i'm having an issue right now with the uh... chair himself and let me go ahead

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.340
and play a couple more songs that

01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:46.140
until they get the settled so uh...

01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.980
let's play some stuff from uh...

01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:54.980
just at radio here's guitar vader with super brothers

01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:21.480
He's already out of time in the jungle

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:24.980
Having fun and loving fun and making me

01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:26.980
Who are you?

01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:28.980
What's your name?

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:30.980
Super brother

01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.980
Come and call the electric beach

01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:42.980
It's super fun

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:44.980
What's your simple Russian term?

01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:46.980
You like mushrooms

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:53.980
It's a baby, I'm the child of a girl, like a mother, like a child of a baby

01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:59.980
Who are you? What's your name? Super Brother

01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:14.980
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:39.260
Super brother

01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:51.600
Super Brother, Super Brother, Super Brother Z

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:58.640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:02.260
So life is a mess, you mean, it's in my body.

01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:06.380
Once you've sacrificed himself, you're like a mushroom.

01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:09.260
It's a play.

01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:12.920
OK, crisis averted for the time being, right?

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:16.380
Anyway, yeah, that song is actually from the first

01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:17.060
Just That Radio.

01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:21.420
That was Superbrothers, which the soundtrack for that game

01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:25.340
was very interesting. When they brought it out for the US, though, they were supposed

01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:32.140
to have added some more tracks to that, but it was a pretty cool game. Anyway, we're going

01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:37.540
to go ahead. We're not going to be doing the song battle this week because, of course,

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:41.380
my other two hosts aren't here to put in their contributions, so we're going to go ahead

01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:45.820
and leave the playlist the way it is this week, but next week we actually should have

01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:46.860
the song battle

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:50.300
and because many voted for night writer hello

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:54.460
then um... i'm gonna pick a new song so you have to vote for because anything

01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:57.720
that i think of course is going to be instantly cool

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.880
for the night writer so i think it's a nice remix of the night writer theme

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:03.320
and nobody and like

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.220
two people voted for it you're already it's but it lasted for two it was

01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:09.140
actually through three weeks

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:11.500
so he'd like to face for a while

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:15.920
yeah and thanks to a director ceo of that if it's not on the music in a

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:16.900
in a

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.760
just radio

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.040
anyway i am

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:23.760
we're gonna go ahead and i'd go into one of our uh... favorite segments which is

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:26.160
uh... the uh... listless

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.960
we're actually at we meet we are probably going to do two of them today

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:30.240
because uh...

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:33.160
we're not having the battle of songs and hey don't you all love it

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:35.680
so this one is going to be uh...

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:36.560
well no

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.440
should we do best old school game maybe best eighties t.v. show perhaps

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.720
how about best sitcom or toon

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:48.600
what would you suggest

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:49.440
sitcom

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.880
because toon is going to be too hard

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:53.400
best eighties sitcom

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:55.100
so uh...

01:36:55.100 --> 01:37:00.780
i don't know how many of you are actually going to be old enough to get it

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:01.980
but um...

01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:03.840
you know think back

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:06.920
you'd be all that for propel

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:09.360
but i was not an eighty-six com

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.960
uh... mister let's hear you back again

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.360
uh...

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.880
how that

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:20.120
you actually some kind of evil when you

01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:22.160
uh...

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.560
actually have a suggestion for best eighties movie

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:29.200
uh... it's pretty broad

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.420
what you have to bring down like that again played best eighties comedy because

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:33.360
there's only

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.720
there's only three of us here

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:38.240
so maybe we should we'll pick for each

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.120
so maybe we could do it that way

01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.760
live-action

01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:45.400
non-animated

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.040
eighties movie

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.020
i know that movie does rule but

01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:52.300
we're going to go for

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:53.280
live-action

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.260
and no we're not voting for porn because if we were voting for porn i'd vote for uh...

01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:59.300
the final fuck ten

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:00.860
Final Fuck X

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:03.500
all about beaver and butt face

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.620
well then again there's a

01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:07.420

01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:12.940
No it's Penis Hands!

01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:16.620
see now our ratings are going to go up because we're talking about porn. See look. You realize it's

01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:20.900
extremely sad that I know more about porn than my boyfriend does

01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:21.940
owned

01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:24.700
whatever I have in my possession

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:27.480
trace the lord's first video, hello

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:31.440

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.960

you can't tell it was the eighties she looked old enough but big hair and fake boobs

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.960
was that the same excuse that you used for a...

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:47.120
I'm not even gonna ask

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:53.480

It's as funny as my life, he's like a knight, I can't tell which way he's turned till I fight

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.600
Whatever battle he's in, he just gets up and begins, they didn't go back before the man

01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:30.280

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:34.320
Oh

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:56.320
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:10.440
And so I hope we all have our answers ready for our list list.

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:13.040
And Dan has decided to participate in this.

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:16.720
Because there's only four of us, usually we do this with six or more, we're going to,

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:19.840
we all picked four songs, but we're still going to vote only for the top three.

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.360
And I have repeated one of my movies on here, damn it, I'm dumb.

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.360
We're choosing movies.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:30.780
Okay, well, I'm going to go ahead and do what I originally have on here, so we're going

01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:33.860
to go ahead and start with me, because we can.

01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:36.560
Or, I don't know, let's go ahead and start with Jessica.

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:40.140
What's your number four movie?

01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:41.240
Number four.

01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:43.340
We have Weird Science.

01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:49.140
Why do you go and tell someone like that?

01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:50.140
Number three?

01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:51.140
No, why do you like weird science?

01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:52.140
Oh, Weird Science?

01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:57.220
um well what what other movie can you see two guys like running around with

01:53:57.220 --> 01:53:58.380
bras on their heads and

01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:02.220
it seems completely normal ish and number three

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:05.300
we okay

01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:08.860
passing after us number

01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:12.900
number four on my list was a Christmas story

01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:18.140
well it's seasonal it's still funny to this day and I don't you'll shoot your

01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:18.740
eye out

01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:28.740
My number four was Aliens, because that movie is hard like The Rock.

01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:47.740
Okay, my number four is Adventures in Babysitting, because of the part where they are singing.

01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:58.240
and Thor. Hey! Adventures in Babysitting was a good movie. So let's go ahead and go to

01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:07.780
number three. Number three for me would be Clue because you know you got three

01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:14.220
different endings you never know which one you're gonna do so here's Ross.

01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:18.780
Very nice. My number three movie is Revenge of the Nerds. Why? Because I can

01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:23.340
consider myself one and hey, any movie with boobies is a winner in my book.

01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:29.920
My number three movie is The Karate Kid because it's the only cool thing that

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:41.620
Ralph Macchio ever did. Too true. My number three is Legend because it has a

01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:48.180
a young Tom Cruise in chain mail. No, not in chain mail, in his outfit. And plus Tim

01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:56.880
Curry's a pimp. Okay, number two? Number two, for me, is the one that everybody's

01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:03.660
been asking about, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Because, you know, when Cameron was in Egypt

01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:14.220
stand let my Cameron go my number two was fast times at Ridgemont High yes

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:25.220
Phoebe hates mmm my number two was the never-ending story because that movie

01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:32.980
was like cool yeah I know that my favorite is going to get voted off but I

01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:39.100
don't care it's vanadu what other movie can you get leg warmers and roller

01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:43.320
skates with one of the the Bee Gees well he looked like he belonged to the Bee

01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:49.600
Gees anyway and Don Bluth animation on top of it and no not roller babies that

01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:54.920
would be I actually like that movie and I admit that it's bad but um vanadu was

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:58.960
just like really cool plus it had Olivia Newton John in it and electric light

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:09.000
orchestra music anyway what do you mean they're all positive anyway um what's

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.680
your number you know I get well that's my number two then cuz I actually like

01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:20.700
the other movie better okay number one this is my personal number one because

I'm a sap and you know like John Hughes movies are like this the pimp shit and

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:31.040
all that pretty in pink because you how can you not love John Cryer as ducky he

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:38.560
is just too cute oh my number one movie was another movie with Molly Ringwald in

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:44.360
it that would be Breakfast Club classic classic movie about nothing but

01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:53.520
Saturday morning detention and Jed Nelson was hot my number one movie is

01:57:53.520 --> 01:58:00.520

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:48.360
we had nobody named Superman

01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:51.880
it was a 70's movie 1978

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:55.400
although the second one was 80

01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:59.240
the second one was like 80

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:02.320
the second one had Zod

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:05.320
but it wasn't as cool as the first

01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:08.800
when I was a kid Superman 2 looked awesome

01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:12.800
when I watched it later on I was like that's the worst looking set I've ever seen

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:15.940
Yeah, and then Superman III went all to hell because of a proprietor.

01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:20.960

One of the...

02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:32.460
Madeline Kahn is awesome.

02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:33.460
And it had Madeline Kahn.

02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:39.300
Flames on the sides of my face, heaving, heaving breaths.

02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:40.300
Yes.

02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:41.940
Well, actually, that was in...

02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:44.900
That line was in our old intro.

02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:47.980
It was a raw influence.

02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:49.980
Enough said.

02:10:49.980 --> 02:10:50.980
Yeah.

02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:51.980
Enough.

02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:59.260
Our number two was Back to the Future by Last Minute Vote, and Dan feels rather thrilled

02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:17.540
The number one by a resounding number of votes, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:23.660
You know, there were a lot of movies that didn't get, Raiders of the Lost Ark was mentioned.

02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:26.660
Superman was the 70s.

02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:35.420
There were, but we, I'd say Ferris Bueller's Day Off though, had to have been like one

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:39.140
of the top movies of the 80s.

02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:48.260
You know, it would be cool if they would put more 80s songs though in DDR and Beatmania.

02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:51.040
You know, we got the reflex.

02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:52.040
That was pretty neat.

02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:58.040
It would be cool if you had a crop load of songs that have been covered.

02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:01.040
Here, take this out of here.

02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:04.040
Well, like I said, you have a bunch of songs that have been covered.

02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:09.040
I mean, like Xanadu, like have we never been mellows.

02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:13.040
Yeah, but covers aren't nearly close to the same thing.

02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:16.040
True, but they're there, kind of.

02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:18.040
I mean, look at Smoke.

02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:21.040
the 1973 Deep Purple song.

02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:24.040
Right.

02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:27.040
I shot the sheriff.

02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.040
Yeah, I heard that on the radio. Just hear the name.

02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:33.040
Wasn't Boom Boom Dollar an 80's tune?

02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:36.040
Maybe, you know, an 80's tune in Japan or something.

02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:38.040
Mighty Fine and Dollar.

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:42.040
Yeah. Mighty Fine and Dollar.

02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:46.040
Yeah, I wish that there would be more 80's stuff just if only to infuse

02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:59.200
youngins with good oh boy um goodness gosh well let's see there's there's

02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:05.760
others 80s and 70s stuff like all the Casey and the Sunshine Band stuff 70s

02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:12.920
okay disco yeah this goes cool on all but I mean you're comparing apples and

02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:18.480
oranges you're talking about you know like miracle versus disco inferno come

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:27.640
on all right fine it's not fair I'm like trying to do the mic pass here

02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:38.080
yeah in case you guys hadn't hadn't quite caught it yet little miss Jamie is

02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:44.680
in the poopy pot right now so yet again yet again cuz she has had too much

02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:51.160
propel imagine that yes she's being propelled onto the toilet I can't believe

02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:54.520
y'all didn't vote for back to the future I mean come on really you know it's

02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:58.560
available in a nice trilogy box set now at finer stores everywhere but is it

02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:04.120
fixed apparently apparently there was an issue with like the second and third

02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:07.280
movies not being available in widescreen

02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:10.520
maybe you got the second set then

02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:15.520
because they were supposed to re-release them

02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:20.080
you know that is actually

02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:24.380
a point of debate though, people being concerned over widescreen over full

02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:24.960
screen

02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:30.520
there's no debate there, people who widescreen are mindless, idiotic zombies

02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:32.520
Dan they can't they can't hear that

02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:36.740
Yeah

02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:44.580
Well, there's there's a and not everybody can hear this with it being so far away, um, well basically I don't get yeah

02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:47.520
It's exactly just saying I don't get why people enjoy watching their movies

02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:56.500
With um the screen, you know the whole movie cut off and have it be all bad quality scanned in and you know

02:14:56.500 --> 02:15:04.820
So actually Die Hard had a really good example on the DVD of the difference between widescreen

02:15:04.820 --> 02:15:05.820
and full screen.

02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:06.820
By the way, that movie has my man in it.

02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:11.340
I just thought I'd mention Alan Rickman.

02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:13.500
What guy?

02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:14.940
They can't hear you.

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:15.940
That's him.

02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:16.940
Anyway.

02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:17.940
No, anyway.

02:15:17.940 --> 02:15:18.940
Dan, they can't hear you.

02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:34.860
Anyway, but I don't get why it is, though, that people decide that they want to watch

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:40.500
their movies like that when you're missing the whole movie, though I remember on Saturday

02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:48.660
Night Live when Steven Seagal was on there, but they had someone portraying Steven Seagal

02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:55.900
and they had super wide Steven vision, Sagala vision, that was it, and they had the widescreen

02:15:55.900 --> 02:15:59.960
so wide that you could see like stuff that was like off the set, and you could see the

02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:03.020
guy over in the other room, you know, going to the bathroom or eating or something, and

02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:13.420
then all of the extras over there getting food off the table, but there's a, you know,

02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:16.140
I don't see why people enjoy that.

02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:21.660
Okay, we can't all have mics because the splitter that I bought was not the right splitter, and we couldn't find one I

02:16:23.180 --> 02:16:25.620
Agree, that's dance a dude. That's booty

02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:33.520
Dan once like a seed dance got his taste of radio now you they said they can hear you

02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:40.540
Did you hear him say that he's a pet he said you're loud

02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:47.540
it

02:16:47.700 --> 02:16:52.540
he sticks out like a hitchhiker's thumb

02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:55.220
it's not dumb

02:16:55.220 --> 02:16:58.860
dan's gonna get kicked in a minute

02:16:58.860 --> 02:17:01.420
anyway

02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:03.980
so uh...

02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:05.420
we actually uh...

02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:09.180
now we've got comments coming in about alan rickman movies so

02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:11.740
That makes me feel all happy and joyous.

02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:21.660
So, as far as the sim update, I'm going to be fully honest,

02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:23.240
I don't keep up with the sims.

02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:27.160
Well, some people keep up with the game, the sims,

02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:30.220
but I don't keep up with the simulators or anything.

02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:34.360
I understand that the Turning Mix 3 deal didn't go as well

02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.500
as some people had wished that it would.

02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:41.440
You know, we're going to have a full update on that one next week when Loki is back on

02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:43.080
the radio.

02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:50.560
And hopefully, though, he did mention something about having unlimited access to get all of

02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:54.480
those things posted up on the site, so we'll be able to let everybody know, and we'll probably

02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:56.640
put something up on our web page.

02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:01.800
By the way, again, for people who are wanting to participate in chat, just go to orangelounge.skie.cx,

02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:06.420
there is a link to our chat room located there on the site and you can

02:18:06.420 --> 02:18:13.740
participate in all the madness and we actually had a couple people saying that

02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:19.780
a turning mix 3 actually was pretty good so what was good about it was good about

02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:24.840
turning mix 3 I didn't participate in any of that by the way we also um from

02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:31.780
there's a mass edit contest make edit get porn yes it's called make edit get

02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:36.040
I think that's going to be in a couple of weeks is when that's going to expire.

02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:43.600
It was supposed to be last week, but nobody, well, we only had, we only had two entries

02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:45.400

02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:53.340
So it's going to be anything that's in Max USA for the United States, make your edit

02:18:53.340 --> 02:18:57.340
for that, send it in to Matt one way or another.

You know, you can send it to me if you want to and I'll get it to him, but you win this

02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:05.160

Boom Dollar, but I don't know if Jamie's going to circumvent that or not.

02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:24.300
There's no way.

02:21:24.300 --> 02:21:25.300
She said circump.

02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:33.020
I don't know what you're saying, circumcise, but, um, so Jamie's playing with tracks, she's

02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:35.780
having fun, and just kind of tossing things around.

02:21:35.780 --> 02:21:40.460
If you're sitting in a car, between two guys, is it okay to get wood?

02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:42.460
It's not even okay to ask.

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:47.140
There you go, you're uber fun.

02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:50.140
Those are the three songs.

02:21:50.140 --> 02:21:52.140
The three song solo gig.

02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:53.140
What do you mean three songs?

02:21:53.140 --> 02:21:54.140
Anyone.

02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:55.140
We're running out of things to say.

02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:56.140
Help!

02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:57.140
Jamie's playing with music.

02:21:57.140 --> 02:21:58.140
Actually, do me a favor.

02:21:58.140 --> 02:21:59.140
Throw in one of those.

02:21:59.140 --> 02:22:00.140
The best cities are in it.

02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:01.140
I don't have to do too many.

02:22:01.140 --> 02:22:02.140
Okay, there we go.

02:22:02.140 --> 02:22:03.140
Yeah, one is the originals, and one is the...

02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:04.140
Three songs.

02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:05.140
Three songs.

02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:06.140
Okay.

02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:07.440
I don't have beautiful 21C.

02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:07.940
OK.

02:22:07.940 --> 02:22:08.440
Yeah.

02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:11.600
One is the originals, and one is the three-song.

02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:12.100
Three-song.

02:22:12.100 --> 02:22:12.600
Yeah.

02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:13.100
OK.

02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:17.880
We had a request for beautiful 21C,

02:22:17.880 --> 02:22:20.660
and I thought it was on one of these disks, but you know what?

02:22:20.660 --> 02:22:24.200
I don't have beautiful 21C, but I will eventually.

02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:28.540
So let's go back to, yeah, next week on Orange Lounge.

02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:35.360
We're going to go ahead and look for a song that was.

02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:36.360
That's so funny.

02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:39.360
Third.

02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:53.360
Try lower.

02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:55.360
Do you have anything that's second style?

02:22:55.360 --> 02:23:05.360
Second style I have. There it is. Alright, we are playing Macho Gang. Enjoy. Hey, anal fighter. Yeah.

02:26:55.360 --> 02:27:02.360
I used to walk around with the space in my hand

02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:07.360
Told you Bombay is my name and my father had to say

02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:11.360
But everything changed here in underway

02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:14.360
It's so wet that I get to my father

02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:18.360
It's so wet that I get to my brother

02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:21.360
It's so wet that I get to my mother

02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:25.360
It's so wet, the tiger took my family

02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:28.360
La ba dee, la ba loll, yee go lay yawl

02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:31.360
In da ba loll, yah didn't he go lay

02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:35.360
We used to shake a kooza in a little wooden house

02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:38.360
I lived there with my family and friends we went out

02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:42.360
But now they all are gone and life is not so fun

02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:45.360
But what can you expect here in Ireland?

02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:49.360
It's so wet, the tiger took my father

02:27:49.360 --> 02:28:01.360
It's so wet, that I just took my brother It's so wet, that I just took my mother It's so wet, that I just took my family

02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:17.360
One day in the warm jungle, the tigers took my stick

02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:20.360
It wasn't really fun, it was a big mistake

02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:24.360
I took my father's swing shot and cut the tiger down

02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:27.360
This is how we feel it here in Tiger Lake

02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:23.880
It's so wet, that I get to my mother It's so wet, that I get to my mother

02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:25.220
It's so wet!

02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:27.220
The tiger took my mother

02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:28.760
It's so wet!

02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:30.700
The tiger took my family

02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:32.100
It's so wet!

02:29:32.260 --> 02:29:34.000
The tiger took my father

02:29:34.260 --> 02:29:35.700
It's so wet!

02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:37.660
The tiger took my brother

02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:39.120
It's so wet!

02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:41.140
The tiger took my mother

02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:42.480
It's so wet!

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:44.580
The tiger took my family

02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:45.940
It's so wet!

02:29:45.980 --> 02:29:48.320
The tiger took my family

02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:49.500
It's so wet!

02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:53.500
The tiger took my family

02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:51.500
Oh

02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:37.580
We can stay around, ooh yeah We gotta get around

02:31:37.580 --> 02:31:47.260
We can stay around, ooh yeah We gotta get around

02:31:47.260 --> 02:31:53.260
You can play it my way, oh yeah

02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:55.260
Thank you for watching!

02:32:53.260 --> 02:32:57.260
And now

02:32:57.260 --> 02:33:01.260
For the

02:33:01.260 --> 02:33:05.260
The

02:33:05.260 --> 02:33:09.260
The

02:33:09.260 --> 02:33:13.260
The

02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:17.260
The

02:33:17.260 --> 02:33:21.260
The

02:34:21.260 --> 02:34:23.260
Oh

02:35:21.260 --> 02:35:44.260
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:35:44.260 --> 02:35:55.780
Well, we're back, and we're on the home stretch of the show.

02:35:55.780 --> 02:36:03.380
We did get a request for a very funny song, and unfortunately I haven't been able to quite

02:36:03.380 --> 02:36:06.540
get it just yet, but I can't promise anything.

02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:11.860
We may be able to have that ready for the afterbirth of the show.

02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:18.780
And Ross was bringing up something very interesting earlier about Japanese video games, about

02:36:18.780 --> 02:36:19.780
some of these weird ones.

02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:21.700
Do you mind telling us about it?

02:36:21.700 --> 02:36:27.860
Well, I mean, you've seen some of the stuff like the ones where you have to walk the dog.

02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:28.860
I mean, come on now.

02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:33.500
Um, goodness, South Amal and Hayward had the one where they had the butt and you had to

02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:36.220
have the paddle and you had to spank it.

02:36:36.220 --> 02:36:37.540
It didn't last too long.

02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:38.540
Let's just say that.

02:36:38.540 --> 02:36:42.540
when I had, you know, some friends of mine walking up behind it and trying to mount it.

02:36:42.540 --> 02:36:45.540
Um, yeah, it's not gonna last long.

02:36:45.540 --> 02:36:47.540
South Island Mall did have something cool, though.

02:36:47.540 --> 02:36:51.540
They did have the Monkey Ball arcade game, which had a banana for a joystick.

02:36:51.540 --> 02:36:54.540
That got taken out when an old lady started stroking it.

02:36:54.540 --> 02:36:57.540
That was kind of... yeah.

02:37:02.540 --> 02:37:06.540
Yeah, that's basically what I was envisioning.

02:37:06.540 --> 02:37:12.540
But, I mean, some of them go too far, I mean, with the train, like a train simulation, and...

02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:16.540
We don't have them here anymore.

02:37:16.540 --> 02:37:18.540
Just do a search on, on Yahoo.

02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:24.540
And, uh, Jamie is over here, playing with stuff.

02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:33.540
I tried going to 3brain.com to try to find this song to play by request, and when you click on the low HTML version of the page,

02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:36.740
It gives you a smiley face. Done in text.

02:37:36.740 --> 02:37:40.180
What were you saying about those games? Tell me about the lobster game.

02:37:40.180 --> 02:37:43.860
Well, there's a site where I saw...

02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:48.220
basically, you know one of those crane games where you win stuffed animals and stuff?

02:37:48.220 --> 02:37:52.340
They had live lobster. This is great! I mean,

02:37:52.340 --> 02:37:55.420
they're, you know, the claws are all taped up and

02:37:55.420 --> 02:37:59.780
you just pop in your money and, if you're lucky, you'll have dinner that night!

02:37:59.780 --> 02:38:05.060
Lobster! It's great stuff! How can you lose? Yeah, it's a little inhumane.

02:38:05.060 --> 02:38:08.820
But this is Japan. Who cares? Really.

02:38:08.820 --> 02:38:12.260
I do. Well, it's just really

02:38:12.260 --> 02:38:16.140
freaking mean. Okay, what about the poor ones that are sitting there with their

02:38:16.140 --> 02:38:16.760
guts

02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:20.020
spilling out everywhere because the crane decided to take part of its, you know,

02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:25.980
shell off? That's not cool. That poor thing's sitting there suffering for hours on end

02:38:25.980 --> 02:38:27.060
until it dies in

02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:31.580
in the tank because it's bleeding everywhere.

02:38:31.580 --> 02:38:36.140
Um, yeah, it is a little inhumane.

02:38:36.140 --> 02:38:39.460
A little? Yeah, it's a little. I mean, okay,

02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:43.780
look at this, walk the dog.

02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:47.220
Why not just go out and walk the dog? Exactly. I guess, you know, for people

02:38:47.220 --> 02:38:51.220
who live in apartment complexes with no dogs and no pets,

02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:54.700
this is the only thing that they can really do.

02:38:54.700 --> 02:39:01.700
that'd be remotely close to walking the dog

02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:06.780
We're watching Jamie go through 3brain.com right now

02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:08.600
and she can't find it

02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:13.260
the song is not up on 3brain.com so I'm going to have to find it a different way

02:39:13.260 --> 02:39:15.080
uh...

02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:17.820
I had it probably burned off

02:39:17.820 --> 02:39:20.100
but if all else fails

02:39:20.100 --> 02:39:23.220
I'll try to have it for next week for next week's uh...

02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:24.500
little uh...

02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:29.160
Fortune cookie yeah, but we're needing new material for our fortune cookie

02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:33.200
So if anybody happens to have anything that you think is funny save it for us

02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:37.640
And who knows maybe your little comedy clip might make it on for one of our fortune cookies of the week

02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:43.000
But you know there were um there were some of those really interesting games

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:47.620
So that I really wish that they bring out the u.s.. Like um I like playing the um

02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:49.720
That photo game

02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:55.560
Yeah, that photo game was cool as I suck at it. Yeah, we got to play it in Las Vegas of all places and

02:39:56.560 --> 02:39:58.560
It's

02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:01.360
But um it's

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
At Berkeley oh

02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:09.640
Another game that I thought that was really neat

02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:16.400
The actually that I want to play and hopefully I'll get to if I get to go to Japan soon. Is that taiko game?

02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:22.320
game. Think of Mambo a Go-Go. There's a picture of it up on the side. I'm going to post this

02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:29.920
link in the chat room for everybody. This is a bunch of different Japanese games like

02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:36.720
the Walking the Dog game, but the game that I want to play is Taiko War. Taiko, for anyone

02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:39.840
who doesn't know, is a type of Japanese drum. You know, I've actually got two of those drums

02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:43.600
in my Animal Crossing house, by my fire.

02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:47.920
Anyway, but this is one where basically you play the drum.

02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:51.520
You know, actually I think it's really cool, I don't have the links immediately

02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:54.920
with me but I'll try to find them for next week, Namco has done a series of

02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:55.920
music games.

02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:56.920
Really?

02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:04.140
They've done a guitar simulation game, they've done, yeah Dan was saying that

02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:11.140
every single which one Konami sued them over

02:41:11.260 --> 02:41:14.900
but they've uh... they've done a guitar game, they've done a keyboard game that actually

02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:17.460
looks like it might kick keyboard manias ass because

02:41:17.460 --> 02:41:20.460
it actually goes with music so you have to read the music and play it

02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:22.280
uh... there's a uh...

02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:24.220
an auto harp game

02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:26.640
if i remember correctly

02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:29.900
uh... I'm still waiting for them to make sax maniacs

02:41:29.900 --> 02:41:36.900
I want boner freaks. Boner freaks. I want boner freaks. Yeah, you play trombone.

02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:42.620
I can't make that.

02:41:42.620 --> 02:41:46.300
Dead boner freaks. Stroke mania.

02:41:46.300 --> 02:41:49.300
That's not exactly what I was talking about.

02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:54.300
Well, I want beat it mania.

02:41:54.300 --> 02:41:57.740
Whack off mania.

02:41:57.740 --> 02:42:01.300
Masturbation Freaks

02:42:01.300 --> 02:42:06.620
We have a suggestion from a Namco panty raider

02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:09.540
Okay

02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:13.440
You know

02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:17.380
Trumpet ska session mode, that's actually a suggestion for more than Jake

02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:20.420
Flute Namco

02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:23.460

02:42:23.460 --> 02:42:25.460
We actually, uh, would, uh...

02:42:27.460 --> 02:42:30.460
Oh, actually, welcome to, uh, Rob, who has joined the chat room.

02:42:30.460 --> 02:42:33.460
Haha! I'm in charge! Haha! Anyway.

02:42:33.460 --> 02:42:35.460
Jack off, man.

02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:37.460
Rob, don't say you're a train wreck.

02:42:37.460 --> 02:42:39.460
This is not a train wreck!

02:42:39.460 --> 02:42:41.460
I'm doing a good job hosting, dammit.

02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:44.460
I don't know who you're hitting, Joel.

02:42:44.460 --> 02:42:46.460
I can't go on.

02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:47.460
I cry.

02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:49.460
River gas mania.

02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:51.460

Can be Michael Flatley.

02:42:55.460 --> 02:42:57.460
The Lord of the Dance!

I am the Führer of the Dance!

02:42:59.460 --> 02:43:01.460

River Dance Revolution.

02:43:03.460 --> 02:43:05.460
River Dance Revolution.

02:43:05.460 --> 02:43:09.460
No, they need the Kunio version, River City Dance Revolution.

02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:11.460
Yeah.

02:43:11.460 --> 02:43:15.460
Well, you know, really, if you want to River Dance to DDR,

02:43:15.460 --> 02:43:19.460
all you have to do is play Captain Jack Basic.

02:43:19.460 --> 02:43:32.380
We're having some discussion here now on old school games.

02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:37.820
River City Ransom, it's called Hot-Blooded Downtown Story.

02:43:37.820 --> 02:43:42.500

02:46:13.860 --> 02:46:15.300
then it would be sonygen

02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:17.900
if tangan

02:46:17.900 --> 02:46:21.300
it was corrupted evil combine them with sony and you have the ultimate evil

02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:22.180
empire

02:46:22.180 --> 02:46:25.980
you know and that if their games were all distributed at frys

02:46:25.980 --> 02:46:27.780
cincendo graphics

02:46:27.780 --> 02:46:32.620
what's that for? that's for the sega nintendo turbo graphics

02:46:32.620 --> 02:46:39.620

02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:55.660
just for the record i am the only person that gets to play ross

02:46:55.660 --> 02:46:58.260
do you stomp to his beat?

02:46:58.260 --> 02:46:59.860
i'm feeling the funky funky beat

02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:01.260

02:47:03.380 --> 02:47:04.700
the white revolution

02:47:04.700 --> 02:47:09.300
what if she's going to team up with the other golden girls and eat cheesecake?

02:47:09.300 --> 02:47:11.240
hahaha

02:47:11.240 --> 02:47:13.780
maybe one of them is going to have a heart attack

02:47:13.780 --> 02:47:17.220
okay

02:47:17.220 --> 02:47:20.420
what if we had our own video game company, what would we specialize in?

02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:23.940
Simulations. Simulations.

02:47:23.940 --> 02:47:26.940
We would do real life sim where it's like...

02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:31.340
I want to simulate making a bowl of cereal. Yeah, cooking, that was what I was going to say, cooking.

02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:33.500
A cooking simulation.

02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:35.840
No, no, they actually have a game

02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:38.340
and again it's another one of those goofy Japanese games

02:47:38.340 --> 02:47:41.500
where you work in a restaurant and you have to make people's orders

02:47:41.500 --> 02:47:43.480
like sandwiches and stuff

02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:47.420
and no it's not

02:47:47.420 --> 02:47:51.340
but no um... in this game you like if you don't make their order exactly the

02:47:51.340 --> 02:47:52.320
way they want it

02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:54.160
then you'd lose points

02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:58.560
of course there's also the egg flipping game that was that uh...

02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:00.160
that was that um...

02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:01.180
A.I.

02:48:01.180 --> 02:48:04.120
where you flip the pan and try to catch the thing

02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:08.300
but it was broken

02:48:08.300 --> 02:48:10.160
with the book

02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:13.260
there's

02:48:13.260 --> 02:48:16.260
you know that is actually is nothing they could sell would you know they have

02:48:16.260 --> 02:48:17.580
those live dolls

02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:21.220
they could sell like the ultimate sim version

02:48:21.220 --> 02:48:24.340
where you look at you get up to your xbox

02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:28.260
because the xbox isn't good for hardly anything else anyway

02:48:28.260 --> 02:48:34.340
it makes great paperweight jump rope revolution

02:48:34.340 --> 02:48:38.220
you know actually if they did a square dancing game for ddr like that would be

02:48:38.220 --> 02:48:43.220
cool we actually play with a partner

02:48:43.220 --> 02:48:45.480
you know that would be that would be pretty neat

02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:50.540

02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:48.280

02:49:48.280 --> 02:49:49.400
countdown

02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:53.040
it did corresponds to a different under

you know crab games they have to get the crabs before they make it across from

02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:06.900
you know it's remarkable the lack of all type of thing

02:50:06.900 --> 02:50:10.320
you have to grab the other before it moves out of the way so you have to keep

02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:15.800
up with the other. That's one twitchy cow. Give that cow some Prozac.

02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:18.880
No, we're not having DDR upskirt revolution.

02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:22.300

you know, weird sight had a camera

02:50:31.380 --> 02:50:34.700

imagine what horrible noises you'd have coming out of there

02:51:55.520 --> 02:51:57.520
That is the most horrific thing.

02:51:57.520 --> 02:51:59.520
No, we're not having dildo revolution.

02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:02.520
No, we need- Ross needs to see the upskirt cam.

02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:03.520
No, he doesn't.

02:52:03.520 --> 02:52:04.520
Jessica says he doesn't.

02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:06.520
I want to see if it actually exists, because I can't believe it.

02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:07.520
It does exist.

02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:09.520
It does exist. Isn't that good enough for you?

02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:10.520
You have to be kidding me.

02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:13.520
Okay, I don't know- no, that one's down, thank God.

anyway guess what

02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:09.020
It's about that time, so we're going to go off and look for porn.

02:54:09.860 --> 02:54:11.220
So, uh, prawn.

02:54:11.600 --> 02:54:14.080
Prawn. We don't need seafood, Dan.

02:54:14.400 --> 02:54:15.780
Dude, prawns are awesome.

02:54:15.780 --> 02:54:18.580
Prawns are awesome, and we do not need DDR lesbian porn.

02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:24.160
Anyway, um, that's it for this little lovely bit of train wreck.

02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:26.280
So, uh, soiree.

02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:28.940
Yes, this is a soiree.

02:54:29.160 --> 02:54:32.700
Anyway, we're going to go, because we, like, have other stuff to do.

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.840
So, but anyway, do you have any final thoughts?

02:54:35.840 --> 02:54:40.320
Let's start with the farthest away, Dan.

02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:42.800
No.

02:54:42.800 --> 02:54:44.480
I second that, no.

02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:46.200
I'm going to go play Ross Ross Revolution.

02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:49.040
You said thoughts.

02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:53.040
I said thoughts, as if any of us are busy thinking.

02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:56.640
Anyway, my final thought is if you

02:54:56.640 --> 02:54:59.080
want to have an upskirt cam, be sneaky.

02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:01.680
Bye.

02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:05.160

02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:25.560
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:28.640
And now, the buffoons date at the drive-in

02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:32.220
with the school's valedictorian.

02:55:32.220 --> 02:55:34.480
I really appreciate your asking me out.

02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:38.680
Most people are intimidated by my high academic achievement.

02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:41.800
This movie sucks shit!

02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:45.520
Well, Ibra gave it thumbs up, but Siskel thought it was too preachy.

02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:49.700
Anyway, I enjoyed the director's last film immensely.

02:55:49.700 --> 02:55:53.680
Kathleen Turner has big fucking tits!

02:55:53.680 --> 02:55:58.000
Yes, well, she recently had a child. I think her maternal biology may play a

02:55:58.000 --> 02:55:59.520
role in that.

02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:03.560
She looks fabulous for a woman her age, doesn't she?

02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:08.360
I had a firecracker in a bullfrog's mouth and blew his fucking head off!

02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:12.140
Well, in psychology we learn that it's not uncommon for male adolescents to commit

02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:17.000
savage acts on animals as part of their maturing process.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:20.080
That girl in the fucking car in front of us!

02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:23.240
She gives everybody head!

02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:26.700
Well, I guess she starved for attention and she feels promiscuity is the only way

02:56:26.700 --> 02:56:30.020
to obtain it.

02:56:30.020 --> 02:56:32.800
These popcorn's fucking terrible!

02:56:32.800 --> 02:56:36.120
It tastes like someone jizzed all over it.

02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:39.680
Well, the thought of semen on this popcorn is certainly disturbing.

02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:43.120
Perhaps the staff in the refreshment stand was overcome by the monotony of

02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:46.440
their work and decided to play a childish prank.

02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:50.440
I looked at my asshole in the mirror today!

02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:54.120
It blew my fucking mind!

02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:58.000
It's ironic that parts of one's own body can seem odd and unusual because you don't

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:01.240
see them on a day-to-day basis.

02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:05.240
My father's shit stinks up the bathroom all fucking day!

02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:10.240
It's puzzling why one person's fecal odor can be more overpowering than another's.

02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:16.240
I wonder whether it is a function of the food digested or that person's internal metabolism.

02:57:17.240 --> 02:57:20.240
I'm gonna go get head from that fucking girl!

02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:24.240
While I'm sorry to see the date come to such an abrupt conclusion,

02:57:25.240 --> 02:57:29.240
I do appreciate the time you've spent with me and look forward to a future rendezvous.

02:57:29.240 --> 02:57:32.240
I like to piss in that guy's fucking gas tank!

02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:01.240
You
