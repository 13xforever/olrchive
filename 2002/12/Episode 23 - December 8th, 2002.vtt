lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.360 --> 00:40.360
kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex in this episode.

01:03.360 --> 01:09.000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
No!

01:12.000 --> 01:16.640
What I expect for Spanish exposition is kendo.

01:16.640 --> 01:17.640
Hey!

01:17.640 --> 01:18.640

And find that funny Orange Lounge Radio

01:37.720 --> 01:44.120
We are live and this is episode number 23 for December the 8th of 2002 but actually

01:44.120 --> 01:48.840
we're taping the show a day early on December 7th of 2002 because we've all decided to go

01:48.840 --> 01:51.260
out and get a life this Sunday night Because we can

01:51.260 --> 01:53.720
Because we can You have to clean

01:53.720 --> 01:56.680
You get to clean? Joy, joy

01:56.680 --> 02:01.880
I'm going to a concert, I'm going to see Cher You're barely even laughing

02:01.880 --> 02:02.880
That's like a horse.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.880
Actually, Cindy Lauper's opening, and that's what I really want to see, so...

02:06.880 --> 02:11.880
Uh, you are tuned into the Bimani scene's most hilarious radio station of all things

02:11.880 --> 02:12.880
Bimani.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.880
My name is Rob Robertsby, you might know me as Sky.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.000
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner of the Happiest Bunny on the

02:18.000 --> 02:21.760
Farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.720
You know her better as Dark Sakura.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.920
And in that corner, it is our Tech Massa Loki.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.080
And we have with us tonight in the studio, nobody else.

02:31.080 --> 02:37.080
There's nobody else here, because Brad and Irene are out in the front, but they're playing Animal Crossing, because they suck.

02:37.080 --> 02:41.080
Quit hitting people with bugmets and get in here, we're doing a show.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.080
Pit balls, don't forget the pit balls.

02:43.080 --> 02:52.080
We'll be talking to everybody a bit more later. First we're going to take a quick break, we're going to do a bunch of popin' music songs this break, won't that be fun?

02:52.080 --> 02:54.080
Any other opening thoughts from you kids?

02:54.080 --> 02:57.080
I just made a treble clef with the microphone cord.

02:57.080 --> 03:00.080
That's special, thank you.

03:00.080 --> 03:08.080
Also on tonight's show, the usual talk of nothing, and a new game. We'll be doing a new game tonight. That'll be fun.

03:08.080 --> 03:17.080
And I don't know what else. So, enjoy this opening, I have no idea how we're going to go three hours tonight, but we'll make it. We'll manage somehow.

03:17.080 --> 03:29.080
Thank you guys for listening. We're going to do some pop music stuff, and we'll be right back. This is all from Popin' Music 6, so especially the pop music club that wrote us a letter a couple weeks back saying we need to play more pop music.

03:29.080 --> 03:36.080
top music. That'll make them happy. Oh, hello Irene!

03:36.360 --> 03:43.360
How can we get there tonight?

03:45.340 --> 03:52.340
I'm sorry, I'm being talked to on the phone. I think now is a very good time to go to break.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.800
What do you guys think?

05:26.800 --> 05:33.800
Don't let your roots bring you down Live in a foundation of a dream

05:56.800 --> 06:05.800
I'm so in love with you, whatever you wanna do it, follow with me

06:05.800 --> 06:13.800
You make me feel so proud of you, you're the one I need you my

06:13.800 --> 06:23.800
I don't wish upon a star, this love is for you, let's stay together

06:23.800 --> 06:30.800
Don't let those calling distance stay, from heaven soon you'll find

06:32.300 --> 06:33.800
Can you hear it?

06:37.300 --> 06:44.800
And this is all that it is, all that's right

06:45.300 --> 06:48.300
We can be so lucky

06:48.300 --> 06:52.300
Wow

07:18.300 --> 07:25.300
Don't let your roots bring you down

07:25.300 --> 07:33.300
Live in the foundation of the land

08:55.300 --> 09:02.300
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that you are not allowed to play with your

09:25.300 --> 09:30.100
Today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter

09:30.100 --> 09:32.100
A, and the number 59.

09:32.100 --> 09:38.100
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

09:38.100 --> 09:44.240
Hello boys and girls, you're... hello, no, we don't want another song yet, oh that's

09:44.240 --> 09:48.020
what I get for having the thing on repeat, my bad, my bad.

09:48.020 --> 09:55.100
But I hope you enjoyed the pre-show that we did tonight of all the Beatmania 6th Mix music.

09:55.100 --> 09:58.620
It was super.

09:58.620 --> 10:01.300
So how are you kids doing tonight?

10:01.300 --> 10:02.300
I'm fine.

10:02.300 --> 10:06.940
Yes, we're extra special on a Saturday tonight for no real good reason.

10:06.940 --> 10:11.100
No, I mean, we're not going to be here tomorrow night, so we had to do the show sometime.

10:11.100 --> 10:15.380
And when we tend to pre-tape the shows at another location, well, that's just too much

10:15.380 --> 10:16.380
work for me.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.380
This is much easier.

10:17.380 --> 10:22.380
I'd have been stupid on a Saturday night like anywhere, like Golf Land or Scandi, you have

10:22.380 --> 10:23.380
all these kids around.

10:23.380 --> 10:24.900
Oh my God, it would have been nuts.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.900
What are you doing? What are you doing?

10:26.900 --> 10:28.900
Why do you have the microphone? What are you doing?

10:28.900 --> 10:30.900
It's like, go away.

10:30.900 --> 10:32.900
I hate kids. I really do.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.900
We should sacrifice them to the Dark Lord.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.900
Jamie's especially evil tonight.

10:42.900 --> 10:47.900
Yeah, I went over to Golf Land the other day to play some games, and there really wasn't anything to play

10:47.900 --> 10:50.900
because 5 key was broken, because Heart Freaks was broken,

10:50.900 --> 10:56.900
This is the sound of me putting my finger down my throat in honor of RVGL.

10:56.900 --> 11:03.020
Yes, but of course those of you out there listening that aren't from this area have

11:03.020 --> 11:05.900
no idea what we're talking about, but it just gets really frustrating when you have all

11:05.900 --> 11:10.860
these bimani games at your local arcade and none of them work.

11:10.860 --> 11:11.860
None of them.

11:11.860 --> 11:17.100
We should send copies of the show to Steve and say, this is the bad press that we're

11:17.100 --> 11:18.100
giving you.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.100
Fix it.

11:19.100 --> 11:24.900
He'd probably just ignore it like everything else we've given him.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.860
I'm going to go and prove the laser tag.

11:27.860 --> 11:30.260
Okay, let's see.

11:30.260 --> 11:34.980
First start by making the guns not look like a giant wad of crap wrapped around with electrical

11:34.980 --> 11:37.820
tape a thousand times.

11:37.820 --> 11:40.660
They can improve it by making it a Qsar.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.180
Damn right they could.

11:42.180 --> 11:46.860
I'd play it if it was a Qsar, but it's not so I don't touch it or go near it or even

11:46.860 --> 11:48.860
think about it.

11:48.860 --> 11:52.600
These are kind of like the supreme of laser tag, huh?

11:52.600 --> 11:53.600
There is no other?

11:53.600 --> 11:54.920
There can be only one?

11:54.920 --> 11:58.360
There is only one because they keep closing the fucking centers down.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.360
I don't know.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.680
There's like one in Concord and that was like the closest one.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.320
Then there's one in San Fran, I think, and then there's some down south.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.320
Pleasanton?

12:06.320 --> 12:07.320
Pleasanton.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.320
Yeah, Pleasanton.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.320
They've got one.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.060
I haven't been there in a while.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.560
So how was your week?

12:13.560 --> 12:15.460
What did you do this week, Jamie?

12:15.460 --> 12:17.580
I worked.

12:17.580 --> 12:18.580
And then what?

12:48.580 --> 12:54.580
The only movie I ever saw more than like twice in the theater I saw, well, besides Rocky Horror, because you know, you see that every week.

12:54.580 --> 12:57.580
Um, Moulin Rouge I saw three times, just because that movie was so awesome.

12:57.580 --> 13:00.580
I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles four times.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.580
Yes, indeed.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.580
That's so old. I need to get that on DVD.

13:04.580 --> 13:09.580
I saw Bill & Ted twice. Well, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. I saw that twice.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.580
Cool.

13:10.580 --> 13:13.580
In the theater. And I saw The Wrath of Khan twice during its original run in the theater.

13:13.580 --> 13:15.580
Wow.

13:15.580 --> 13:16.580
Neat.

13:16.580 --> 13:22.740
burned down smells like burning and how was your week

13:22.740 --> 13:28.700
Logan I work well I guess you could call it working I was on the computer

13:28.700 --> 13:33.540
downloading shit as usual but this time I was downloading please the hell's that

13:33.540 --> 13:39.580
noise I don't know my computer farted just ignore it it was weird I don't

13:39.580 --> 13:43.800
think a truck backing up in there just ignore it it was that weird hum we had

13:43.800 --> 13:50.060
last week coming back for a little bit. Yeah, but anyways. Nobody move! It's the alien implanted

13:50.060 --> 13:56.520
chip in my head that's interfering with the speakers. Maybe. Yeah, but, uh, so I was downloading

13:56.520 --> 14:03.200
PlayStation utilities to attempt to hack a DDR Max 2 disc. This was a short-lived attempt

14:03.200 --> 14:06.840
seen as I... This is the one you yacked about a couple weeks ago about how you're gonna

14:06.840 --> 14:13.640
have the ultimate DDR mix, but no, too tough. It wasn't too tough as I know jack about

14:13.640 --> 14:17.120
programming kind of you need to know how to hack something to be able to hack a

14:17.120 --> 14:21.980
DDR max 2 machine but since I don't know how to do that that's obviously not

14:21.980 --> 14:26.060
going to work all I have to say is there's some weird shit in there I mean

14:26.060 --> 14:30.740
the way they do things on the max 2 disk doesn't make any sense and I don't know

14:30.740 --> 14:35.660
why they do it because they have like for instance the banners for the songs

14:35.660 --> 14:38.860
and everything they have them stored in there three times they have the

14:38.860 --> 14:43.520
executable for max 2 stored in there about 19 times and then they have like

14:43.520 --> 14:50.000
a copy of the actual card that it flashes once. I was like, why store all this excess

14:50.000 --> 14:53.240
data? I can't find the backgrounds. I'm not even going to look anymore because I'm just

14:53.240 --> 14:58.560
fed up with it. Tired. Not worth it. The videos, I know where the videos are. I know where

14:58.560 --> 15:05.640
the music is. I can't decode it worth shit, so I said forget it. I just don't care.

15:05.640 --> 15:10.720
No illegal mixes from Loki. No, nothing. You know, if it's going to ever come down

15:10.720 --> 15:14.240
to it, I'll just buy a machine and run my sim on it. It's going to be 100 times easier

15:14.240 --> 15:19.400
to maintain and work and you're just going to just have to buy the giant metal pads and

15:19.400 --> 15:23.400
just do it that way. Because really actually I was looking at it, you would, there is a

15:23.400 --> 15:27.320
limit to how many songs you can put on there because it actually stores a lot of the data

15:27.320 --> 15:33.360
on the flashcard itself and the flashcard is only 32 megs. And I mean I'm sure you could

15:33.360 --> 15:38.760
probably cram more stuff on there but it looked pretty full as it was. I'm thinking, that's

15:38.760 --> 15:42.040
That's why I'm thinking after Xtreme comes out, they're going to do something else the

15:42.040 --> 15:45.800
way they store stuff on there because there's no way that they're going to be able to fit

15:45.800 --> 15:54.200
anything else on Xtreme because it's all stuck on a stupid flash card and it's pretty dumb

15:54.200 --> 15:56.120
because all the graphics are on that stupid flash card.

15:56.120 --> 16:00.920
Yeah, I'm in the chat room right now and EOSFBB agrees that you should just put a computer

16:00.920 --> 16:04.440
with a SIM inside a DDR cabinet.

16:04.440 --> 16:09.900
If you do want to join our chatroom, by the way, just go to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx,

16:09.900 --> 16:13.100
and then click on Chat, and it tells you how to do it right there.

16:13.100 --> 16:17.100
Of course, since we're taping a day early this week, if you go in there on Sunday night,

16:17.100 --> 16:20.060
well, there's still quite a few people in there listening to this for the first time

16:20.060 --> 16:22.140
on Sunday night, because people are just used to that.

16:22.140 --> 16:23.700
Brad, tell me about your week.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.020
You're over there in the corner.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.020
What's going on?

16:26.020 --> 16:27.020
What's up?

16:27.020 --> 16:28.020
What's up, my brother?

16:28.020 --> 16:29.020
I have a job now.

16:29.020 --> 16:30.020
You have a job now?

16:30.020 --> 16:31.020
Congratulations.

16:31.020 --> 16:32.020
Yay.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.020
Isn't that fun?

16:33.020 --> 16:34.020
Everybody enjoys that.

16:34.020 --> 16:36.020
Well, but I get money now, so that's always good.

16:36.020 --> 16:38.020
Money's good! What do you spend all your money on?

16:38.020 --> 16:40.020
Rent, bills...

16:42.020 --> 16:45.020
I saw you digging through the couch for tokens the other day and it was pretty sad.

16:45.020 --> 16:47.020
Fuck you.

16:48.020 --> 16:50.020
No, I gamble for tokens.

16:50.020 --> 16:54.020
We play poker for tokens.

16:55.020 --> 16:57.020
What else did you do this week?

16:57.020 --> 16:59.020
Did you do anything fun?

16:59.020 --> 17:01.020
See any good movies? Go out and do anything fun?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.020
Go play any DDR?

17:03.020 --> 17:04.020
the guitar freaks

17:04.020 --> 17:06.380
but the guitar freaks is broken now I hear

17:06.380 --> 17:07.380
yep

17:07.380 --> 17:08.380
fucking dolphin

17:08.380 --> 17:11.020
no but I just saw harry potter too that was pretty good

17:11.020 --> 17:12.020
harry potter

17:12.020 --> 17:15.740
I played metroid prime yesterday that's good

17:15.740 --> 17:18.540
nothing really see I have no life you know

17:18.540 --> 17:20.980
I wanted to buy metroid prime today but I'm holding off

17:20.980 --> 17:22.180
you should buy it

17:22.180 --> 17:25.700
well I have a gift card at target that will give me money off so I figure I'll just use

17:25.700 --> 17:26.700
my gift card

17:26.700 --> 17:30.060
yeah you should that's the that's the next best gamecube game you should get

17:30.060 --> 17:37.060
I want games now that I have some money I can go buy games.

18:00.060 --> 18:06.460
but cool. Well, OHA is cool, but OHA only has like seven songs on it. So they need to

18:06.460 --> 18:17.460
do like a 70 song DDR OHA for GameCube. You and that damn ferret.

18:17.460 --> 18:20.860
I can lend you monkey balls. You can lend me monkey balls?

18:20.860 --> 18:28.620
Yeah. That's okay, I was in here eating nuts. This conversation has turned dreadfully perverted.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.620
We have no idea what we're going to be talking about tonight.

18:30.620 --> 18:33.620
So wait, I came in late. I know this is going to be boring for everybody else, but...

18:33.620 --> 18:34.620
That's right.

18:34.620 --> 18:37.620
Did Matt get a... he got the flashcard finally, or what?

18:37.620 --> 18:38.620
You were looking at the flashcard, or...?

18:38.620 --> 18:43.620
He's basically given up on the sim. He got... he got... he obtained super secret copies of the MAX2 discs.

18:43.620 --> 18:44.620
Oh...

18:44.620 --> 18:46.620
And was able to look at them, and then thought,

18:46.620 --> 18:50.620
God, this really sucks. This is hard to hack, so fuck it.

18:50.620 --> 18:57.620
Maybe we should enlist a certain person whose name starts with R-I and ends with a C-K.

18:57.620 --> 19:01.620
He's good at programming and coding and you can look at it.

19:01.620 --> 19:03.620
Yeah, I'm serious.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.620
What do you think, Matt?

19:05.620 --> 19:06.620
Do you think you can give it a try?

19:06.620 --> 19:08.620
I don't care, whatever.

19:08.620 --> 19:09.620
He just gave up.

19:09.620 --> 19:13.620
I just don't give a crap anymore.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.620
I mean, I did get something good out of it that I already kind of had.

19:16.620 --> 19:19.620
I got high-res banners for everything that's in Max 2.

19:19.620 --> 19:22.620
I mean, Max 2 and all the old songs.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.620
So I have super high-res banners now for that, which is kind of cool.

19:25.620 --> 19:31.340
And um, I did find out a little bit how Max 2 works, but I really just don't care.

19:31.340 --> 19:36.140
Now, the person that gave me the disc said he had some friends in places that know how

19:36.140 --> 19:40.060
to do this kind of cracking stuff and said he was going to give it to them and let them

19:40.060 --> 19:41.060
go at it.

19:41.060 --> 19:45.300
But, I mean, I haven't heard of anything I would have to ask him to see if he's going

19:45.300 --> 19:46.300
to do that.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.800
Because if he did that and they figured it out, then yeah, I could go ahead and do it.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.800
But, right now, stop it.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.800
Oops.

19:56.800 --> 20:00.800
Stop that. Just now.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.800
God. Anyways, aside from trying to

20:04.800 --> 20:08.800
get that thing to work, I was watching Taken

20:08.800 --> 20:12.800
all week long. That would be good. I'm talking into

20:12.800 --> 20:16.800
this girl's penis.

20:16.800 --> 20:45.520
It's just as much of a train wreck as our other pre-taped shows, what can we say?

20:45.520 --> 20:48.360
We just don't have the magic when it's not Sunday.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.320
It's not my fault they didn't do anything to the Bimani community.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.600
Everyone's freaking lazy and shopping instead.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.960
Oh yeah, out shopping.

20:54.960 --> 20:55.960
All their fault.

20:55.960 --> 20:56.960
It's not my fault.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.760
Which by the way is going to tie into our list list topic tonight.

20:59.760 --> 21:04.520
But uh, yeah, stuff did happen, it's just, you know, minor stuff.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.840
What, stupid stuff?

21:06.840 --> 21:09.960
Yeah, stupid stuff.

21:09.960 --> 21:13.280
Some stupid news that doesn't apply to anyone here in the United States.

21:13.280 --> 21:17.640
Euromix too, they finally figured out the speed modifier code because the retards at

21:17.640 --> 21:22.600
you know, Kami of Europe or whatever, decided, hey, you know what, putting in a menu where

21:22.600 --> 21:27.760
you can select options is so not European. Let's just have it where you just do the nice

21:27.760 --> 21:32.640
little arrow combinations on the pad and that way you can get, you know, codes that way.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.600
So they didn't really tell them what the codes were, you know, for speed modifiers. They

21:35.600 --> 21:39.440
knew they were there, they just couldn't access them. And finally someone figured out what

21:39.440 --> 21:44.080
it is and now they have like you know 1.5 speed and 2 speed like we have over here which

21:44.080 --> 21:52.080
is retarded stupid Europeans you know what can I say hey now be nice a rogue was just

21:52.080 --> 21:55.240
going to tell you the same thing they figured out that you're only like speed codes today

21:55.240 --> 22:02.240
so almost beat you to it if there wasn't that delay which oh my gosh Jamie has a hole in

22:02.240 --> 22:08.400
her crotch no I think it happened when I got I got snagged when I was getting out of the

22:08.400 --> 22:10.400
The car. My car.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.400
They gave it this way. Easy access.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.400
Okay, it's on the front by the zipper, okay?

22:16.400 --> 22:19.400
Not anywhere near low enough.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.400
This means that I gotta go buy new jeans.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.400
People give me money.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.400
I got a penny.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.400
So do I. That's it.

22:29.400 --> 22:35.400
What was I taking up a collection for? We were at a party, a small little party last night, and I remember I was taking up a collection for something.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.400
I need the dead baby fund for Tokyo.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.400
What?

22:38.400 --> 22:39.400
Dead baby fund?

22:39.400 --> 22:40.400
What?

22:40.400 --> 22:41.400
You're gross.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.400
Never mind.

22:42.400 --> 22:47.400
Oh my god, you are awful.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.840
That's an inside joke we're going to tell off here.

22:49.840 --> 22:57.320
No, I'm sorry, I'm in a semi-foul mood, which is perfect for radio.

22:57.320 --> 22:58.400
Why is this?

22:58.400 --> 22:59.400
Why are you in a foul mood?

22:59.400 --> 23:00.400
I'm none of anyone's business.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.400
I'm allowed.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.400
I'm a chick.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.400
Are you PMSing?

23:03.400 --> 23:04.400
No.

23:04.400 --> 23:18.640
are you pregnant no thank God I got the ferret thrown at me no well I can

23:18.640 --> 23:26.080
understand she's got a hole in her jeans pretty soon to be bigger you know are

23:26.080 --> 23:30.840
Are you building an interocitor in there? No!

23:30.840 --> 23:33.480
I don't know that reference.

23:33.480 --> 23:37.600
I didn't see it.

23:37.600 --> 23:44.280
Are you boys playing nice in there? No! Are you building an interocitor? No!

23:44.280 --> 23:48.840
Uh, let's see. Let's go to the mailbag.

23:48.840 --> 23:52.680
Why don't I do that? Let's open up the mailbag.

23:52.680 --> 23:57.680
I'm going to play some mohawk next break because the chat room demands it.

23:57.680 --> 24:02.680
And now the ferret will entertain you.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.680
Hold on, I'm going to our mailbag.

24:04.680 --> 24:07.680
Stop looking a DDR freak.

24:07.680 --> 24:12.680
I don't go to that noob site. What are you talking about?

24:12.680 --> 24:17.680
There's a couple FUs in here, we'll do those later. Oh, here's one.

24:17.680 --> 24:24.680
I do have an email to read. What do you know? Let's get the email reading music, shall we?

24:27.440 --> 24:32.760
Hunting for music. Hunting for music! Here, I will read a page out of Harry Potter.

24:32.760 --> 24:37.080
Hunting for music!

24:37.080 --> 24:40.680
I will read a page out of this book.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.180
Oh, are you going to read a page out of Harry Potter? Not really.

24:43.180 --> 24:47.180
Okay, because seeing as how I sat here during the pre-show and read the whole book.

24:47.180 --> 24:48.180
Alright, here we go, here we go.

24:51.180 --> 24:52.180
We've got an email.

24:54.180 --> 25:00.180
And it's from the OMGPMTHPSOGTHP network.

25:01.180 --> 25:02.180
Word.

25:02.180 --> 25:03.180
And it reads as follows.

25:04.180 --> 25:08.180
Loki should have his own show where he sets fire to the French.

25:08.180 --> 25:09.180
Damn those French.

25:09.180 --> 25:12.180
They annoy me so with their Frenchness.

25:12.180 --> 25:38.180
Your show rocks. We here at the OMGPMTHPSOGTHP Network are very pleased. We will continue to show support to your show and we'll sacrifice one virgin every week so that we may hear you play Instant Love again. Play Instant Love you must. We demand it or Kung Fu Squirrels will rain upon you. Thank you. The proceeded message was brought to you by the Oh My God Please Make the Horrible Pain Stop Oh God the Horrible Pain Network.

25:38.180 --> 25:40.180
I think we should give in to their demands.

25:40.180 --> 25:41.180
That was beautiful.

25:41.180 --> 25:43.180
Well, we just played Instant Love last week, but you know what we should do?

25:43.180 --> 25:44.180
I don't care. We'll play it again.

25:44.180 --> 25:47.180
You know what we should do? Why don't we put Instant Love in the normal rotation?

25:47.180 --> 25:48.180
The music rotation for when we're not here.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.180
Because our show is special.

25:49.180 --> 25:52.180
Are you saying that our music show is not special?

25:52.180 --> 25:56.180
No wonder no one listens to it, because you told them that it's not special.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.180
Special enough for the Olympics.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.180
Hey!

25:58.180 --> 26:01.180
Our show is special, but Instant Love is special.

26:01.180 --> 26:03.180
Fine, we'll play Instant Love.

26:03.180 --> 26:04.180
God.

26:04.180 --> 26:05.180
God damn.

26:05.180 --> 26:07.180
You guys are such bitches.

26:07.180 --> 26:10.700
bitches. And that's all the email we got.

26:10.700 --> 26:15.540
So that's all I'm reading for you. That's, of course, one more email than we

26:15.540 --> 26:16.660
got last week, so

26:16.660 --> 26:20.740
actually, no it's not. We did get an email last week. But if you want to send us an email, go ahead and send us to

26:20.740 --> 26:24.180
an email to orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com

26:24.180 --> 26:28.500
Sign up for our LiveJournal community before I hunt you down

26:28.500 --> 26:32.580
and sacrifice your balls to... Because

26:32.580 --> 26:36.260
we like to be nosy and read all your journals. Were you just strangling

26:36.260 --> 26:39.260
The squirrel ferret thing with the mic cord?

26:39.260 --> 26:43.260
No, the squirrel was doing it itself. It was autoerotic asphyxiation.

26:43.260 --> 26:47.760
Oh my! Excuse me, I'm still breathing.

26:47.760 --> 26:52.260
Okay! That's just a nice term. It just rolls off the tongue to say.

26:52.260 --> 26:55.760
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

26:55.760 --> 26:59.260
We're gonna take a really quick break at this point, and we're gonna come back,

26:59.260 --> 27:03.260
and we're gonna play a brand new game. I also like vehicular manslaughter.

27:03.260 --> 27:05.260
You guys are weird.

27:05.260 --> 27:09.380
Okay, we're going to take a quick break and we're going to play a brand new game.

27:09.380 --> 27:13.260
However, I need two contestants for this game, so we're going to take contestants from the

27:13.260 --> 27:14.260
chat room.

27:14.260 --> 27:15.260
We're going to all be the celebrities.

27:15.260 --> 27:17.420
Loki, you get to be a celebrity tonight.

27:17.420 --> 27:18.420
You don't get to be a contestant.

27:18.420 --> 27:19.420
You're a celebrity.

27:19.420 --> 27:20.420
Yay.

27:20.420 --> 27:21.420
Does that mean I get a chair?

27:21.420 --> 27:22.420
Okay, so.

27:22.420 --> 27:23.420
No.

27:23.420 --> 27:24.420
This is the question.

27:24.420 --> 27:27.800
Okay, the first two people to private message me with the right answer to this question

27:27.800 --> 27:32.700
will get to play our new game, our new secret game.

27:32.700 --> 27:40.620
Who was the artist that did the song Young Forever?

27:40.620 --> 27:43.660
Who was the artist that did that song in 4th Mix?

27:43.660 --> 27:46.500
First two people to PM me the answer, get to play.

27:46.500 --> 27:50.100
Alright, so that's it, and we will be right back.

27:50.100 --> 27:51.100
Who PM'd the correct answer?

27:51.100 --> 27:52.100
Huh?

27:52.100 --> 27:53.940
Yeah, you have to PM me the correct answer.

27:53.940 --> 27:54.940
It's a game show.

27:54.940 --> 27:55.940
Just not an answer.

27:55.940 --> 27:56.940
Like, you can't PM...

27:56.940 --> 27:57.940
Oh, it was Bob!

27:57.940 --> 27:58.940
And expect to play.

27:58.940 --> 28:02.380
Yes, you have to PM me the correct answer.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.880
Who was the artist that did Young Forever?

28:04.880 --> 28:07.040
Because a lot of people forget some of the dance

28:07.040 --> 28:07.920
media artists sometimes.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.480
So I figure that's a good one to ask you guys.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.360
OK, I'm going to take a quick break.

28:10.360 --> 28:14.360
As requested by the chat room, the chat room demands it.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.440
We're going to hear some oh-ha.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.000
We'll be back.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Oh

29:18.000 --> 29:32.000
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go

29:32.000 --> 29:38.000
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
The early bird gets the worm

29:40.000 --> 29:47.000
We will, we will be young forever

30:10.000 --> 30:20.000
We are the ones who make it right We are the people of our time

30:20.000 --> 30:30.000
We hold the future in our hands We have the love to build upon

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
Together we can have it all

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
With every step we're moving on and on

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000

30:59.000 --> 31:08.000
Forever, we will, we will sing forever

31:08.000 --> 31:36.000
People give you my life, you need me

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
We will give you my life in intake

31:50.000 --> 31:53.500
When I'm facing the stage, you make me feel free

31:53.500 --> 31:56.500
There's a devotion and desire

31:56.500 --> 31:59.000
I'll kiss you every night

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Oh baby, la di, la di, la di

Warning me to listen to Orange Clown

32:50.500 --> 32:57.500
every Sunday.

32:59.060 --> 33:03.460
Not just because it's the best eeeeee money radio out there, but because

33:03.460 --> 33:07.220

33:07.220 --> 33:10.820
and do a nori nori nori routine. And believe me,

33:10.820 --> 33:17.820

33:17.820 --> 33:22.820
Listen to Orange Lounge, because I don't want to have to have anyone suffer through this.

33:47.820 --> 33:51.780

up with something clever. Okay, he's clocked in. Okay, he had quite a little bit of an

38:22.180 --> 38:31.380

38:35.140 --> 38:39.180
time. He had to play the game because he'd heard that everyone else who played it was

39:34.560 --> 39:37.400
No, just kidding. I thought my answer was greasy.

39:37.400 --> 39:40.160

39:40.160 --> 39:43.480

39:48.560 --> 39:52.940

39:52.940 --> 39:57.360
So that means it's all tied up at zero to zero.

39:57.360 --> 40:02.160
They're both losers so far, but that's okay because we've got four more

40:02.160 --> 40:03.400

48:55.460 --> 48:59.460
I'm sorry, that's not a match.

48:59.460 --> 49:00.460
Irene.

49:00.460 --> 49:04.460
Oh, well, I think she's pretty lucky if she looks like that.

49:04.460 --> 49:07.460
I mean, there's not a whole lot of player players that look like that.

49:07.460 --> 49:10.460
Oh, okay, so she's lucky. Oh, that's cute. Okay.

49:10.460 --> 49:11.460
Alright.

49:11.460 --> 49:14.460
Loki said she's also really, really...

49:14.460 --> 49:15.460
Loose?

49:15.460 --> 49:16.460
Hello?

49:16.460 --> 49:17.460
Lovable Lucy?

49:17.460 --> 49:18.460
Yeah, just...

49:18.460 --> 49:22.500
Lovable Lucy, now appearing on stage B. Lovable Lucy, the stage B.

49:22.500 --> 49:24.060
She's also really loose.

49:24.060 --> 49:26.460
No, I'm sorry, that's not a match.

49:26.460 --> 49:28.340
Brad, your answer.

49:28.340 --> 49:32.460
She's short, Asian, cute, has big boobs, and she's also really, really...

49:32.460 --> 49:33.460
Hairy.

49:33.460 --> 49:34.460
Outrageously so.

49:34.460 --> 49:35.740
Hairy!

49:35.740 --> 49:38.900
She's also hairy.

49:38.900 --> 49:42.760
I said lovable Lucy loves Para Para more than any other game in the land. She's short,

49:42.760 --> 49:47.920
Asian, cute, has big boobs, and she's also really, really a guy.

49:47.920 --> 49:51.160
Which would have matched a couple other people in the chat room, but unfortunately neither

49:51.160 --> 49:54.640
of our contestants guessed that she was a guy.

49:54.640 --> 50:03.640
Yeah, I would have almost been a match.

50:03.640 --> 50:13.640
Okay, here we go. This is the last question, guys. Let's total the scores here. EOSVB has

50:13.640 --> 50:22.440
zero and 23rd Magus also has zero. If they are unable to get a match on this last one,

50:22.440 --> 50:28.380
we're just going to have to post on the website that they both lost, that they're both losers.

50:28.380 --> 50:34.380
I suggest you get this one right. Okay. I'm getting mean now. Let's go back to the first

50:34.380 --> 50:39.380
music. Okay, that's better. It's a better key. Alright. You like this key better? Okay,

50:39.380 --> 50:48.380
here's the last question. Bradley the Bully was the best Beatmania player at the whole

50:48.380 --> 50:56.540
arcade. But if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a blank. Bradley

50:56.540 --> 51:00.400
the bully was the best Beatmania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him

51:00.400 --> 51:18.860
to talk about DDR, he'd call you a blank. Everybody's thinking. I have one contestant

51:18.860 --> 51:25.860
in?

51:35.900 --> 51:39.860
Bradley the Bully was the best Beatmania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted

51:39.860 --> 51:46.860
them to talk about DDR, he'd call you a blank.

51:47.620 --> 51:49.860
Okay.

51:49.860 --> 51:51.020
Here we go.

51:51.020 --> 51:58.020
I'm going to start with the OSFBB. Are all the celebrities in? No. No, we still got one thinking. Okay.

52:00.100 --> 52:03.940
The OSFBB specifically stated that he's pulling to get your answer on this one.

52:03.940 --> 52:06.220
He's trying to match you on this one.

52:06.220 --> 52:07.700
He's trying to think. Oh, did you get it?

52:07.700 --> 52:09.700
You in? Oh, is everybody in?

52:09.700 --> 52:11.700
Loki, you in? Okay, here we go.

52:12.700 --> 52:19.700
Bradley the Bully was the best BeatMania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a...

52:19.700 --> 52:22.700
EOS of Eevee says he'd call you a propel.

52:22.700 --> 52:26.700
What?

52:27.700 --> 52:29.700
Well, he said he was trying to match you.

52:29.700 --> 52:39.700
Alright, 23rd Magus says, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a fag.

52:39.700 --> 52:41.700
Heaven forbid.

52:41.700 --> 52:45.700
Alright, Jamie, let's see if V.O. said V.B. got that match he was hoping for.

52:45.700 --> 52:50.700
Bradley the Bully was the best B-Mania player at the whole arcade, but if you distracted him to talk about DDR, he'd call you a...

52:50.700 --> 52:53.700
Propel! Wow! No, I'm kidding.

52:53.700 --> 52:55.700
He'd call you a blank.

52:55.700 --> 52:57.700
He'd call you a blank?

52:57.700 --> 53:00.700
Yes. I decided not to answer. He'd call you a blank.

53:00.700 --> 53:03.700
Boo! The audience is booing Jamie, boo!

53:03.700 --> 53:05.700
And I have a smiley face.

53:05.700 --> 53:06.700
Oh.

53:06.700 --> 53:07.700
Next!

53:07.700 --> 53:09.700
Alright, next.

53:09.700 --> 53:14.700
Um, he would call him a cab so he'd have a chance to get away before he beats his ass.

53:14.700 --> 53:18.700
Ah, call him a cab! I'm sorry, that doesn't match.

53:18.700 --> 53:24.700
Alright. We have some funny answers from the chat room. Jabberwocky says he'd call you later that night for a date.

53:24.700 --> 53:28.580
or he'd call you a Michael Jackson wannabe with a nose and no baby

53:28.580 --> 53:32.940
and he'd call you a cheese, windmill

53:32.940 --> 53:37.380
Carl Sagan pocket watch, ass blaster

53:37.380 --> 53:44.500
What an ass bandit. A pansy ass stupid fuck okay

53:44.500 --> 53:48.140
let's moving on moving on trying to match our contestants we have

53:48.140 --> 53:51.660
we have a propel and we have a fact I did

53:51.660 --> 53:55.380
that's moving on let's moving on

53:55.380 --> 53:57.860
that's moving on

53:57.860 --> 53:58.660
well you know that

53:58.660 --> 54:02.680
okay if you distracted him to talk about the are low key he'd call you a

54:02.680 --> 54:07.180
well you know i had to but at this is this was my first answer was bag

54:07.180 --> 54:08.500
all

54:08.500 --> 54:12.380
my second answer was firing monkey pirate but which way to go with

54:12.380 --> 54:16.380

54:16.380 --> 54:17.740

54:19.260 --> 54:23.420
okay twenty-third maggots is ahead by one he did get a match

54:23.420 --> 54:24.600
so

54:24.600 --> 54:28.860
somebody had to have said propel for yosef vivi to win

54:28.860 --> 54:29.660
lead me

54:29.660 --> 54:33.040
okay he'd call you a

54:33.040 --> 54:36.060
propel no just kidding

54:36.060 --> 54:37.020
i

54:37.020 --> 54:42.240
bradley would call him a cock smoking clerk a cock smoking clerk i'm sorry

54:42.240 --> 54:44.660
that isn't a match

54:44.660 --> 54:47.660
and brad gets the kevin smith award

54:47.660 --> 54:50.660
eosvb wants to change his answer to animal crossing

54:50.660 --> 54:53.660
too late

54:53.660 --> 54:55.660
okay my answer

54:55.660 --> 54:58.660
bradley the bully was the best beatmania player at the whole arcade

54:58.660 --> 55:00.660
but if you distracted him to talk about ddr

55:00.660 --> 55:02.660
he'd call you a

55:02.660 --> 55:07.660
sacramental

55:07.660 --> 55:14.660
no that's more of the chibi mentality

55:16.300 --> 55:20.480
wow this game was a blank

55:20.480 --> 55:26.240
alright so our winner was twenty third magus with a score of zero to one yay

55:26.240 --> 55:28.240
yay congratulations

55:28.240 --> 55:29.900
you know what that means

55:29.900 --> 55:32.020
he gets to play the bonus round

55:32.020 --> 55:33.100
yay

55:33.100 --> 55:35.100
I'm gonna have to give everybody the back of their pants.

56:03.100 --> 56:19.100
really, really blank. Everybody have an answer? I'm just waiting for our contestant. OK, here

56:19.100 --> 56:26.220
we go. The bonus round. This segment on Orange Lounge according to 23rd Magus was really,

56:26.220 --> 56:34.180
really, really random. Good answer, good logical answer. You will probably lose. Alright, Jamie,

56:34.180 --> 56:39.900
this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really random. Random! A match! Very good,

56:39.900 --> 56:47.540
very good. Alright, logic prevails. 23 Megas gets a point. That's a hundred dollars of

56:47.540 --> 56:53.020
monopoly money. That you're not going to get. That you're not going to get. Okay, this segment

57:23.020 --> 57:31.020
balls. I have colitis. And my answer was this segment on Orange Lounge was really, really

57:31.020 --> 57:39.660
propel. Some people in the chatroom got it. Oh well. So 23rd Magus won $100 of Monopoly

57:39.660 --> 57:43.900
money. So congratulations. Oh, he's going to get some propel.

57:43.900 --> 57:50.300
And I'll beat him with the variant. A surprise. Alright. Congratulations. Thank you, you guys.

57:50.300 --> 57:56.580
We're going to take a quick break and we'll come back to talk about some more Bimani stuff.

57:56.580 --> 58:01.940
In the meantime, you demanded it, the chat room demanded it, the studio demanded it,

58:01.940 --> 58:02.940
by request.

58:02.940 --> 58:03.940
Colic balls?

58:03.940 --> 58:04.940
No, not colic balls.

58:04.940 --> 58:05.940
It's a new hack song, colic.

58:05.940 --> 58:06.940
Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.

58:06.940 --> 58:07.940
I know you all know BeatMania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

58:07.940 --> 58:11.940
Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami!

58:11.940 --> 58:16.940
I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

58:16.940 --> 58:20.940
Listen carefully and try to follow.

58:20.940 --> 58:22.940
The objects will come down from the top.

58:22.940 --> 58:27.940
When it hits the red line, push the button.

58:27.940 --> 58:31.940
When it hits the red line, turn the table.

58:31.940 --> 58:35.940
You get it? Alright, let's practice.

58:35.940 --> 58:38.940
First, hit the white key.

58:46.940 --> 58:49.940
Now, hit the black key.

58:49.940 --> 58:56.940
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

58:56.940 --> 58:57.940
Easy, huh?

58:57.940 --> 59:04.940
All right, let's go on to the scratch game.

59:04.940 --> 59:26.940
All right, let's go on to the Scratch game, when the objects reach the red line, Scratch!

59:26.940 --> 59:30.940
With the fast note, the technique is to scratch fast.

59:39.440 --> 59:42.940
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

59:42.940 --> 59:44.940
It's hard, but you can do it!

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.940
Okay, effector time!

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:10.940
Here's the stick of the new beatmania!

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.940
Look, way below, do you see the foot switch?

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:17.940
That's the effect on and on switch.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:20.940
With this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:25.940
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.940
Hey, do you hear the variety of effects?

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:37.940
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

01:00:37.940 --> 01:01:04.540
All right, Loki, please introduce this next song, because it's kind of weird.

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:08.740
Okay, before I came over today, I found one of the strangest Paranoia remixes ever.

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:12.460
It's the first, probably only, all-Spanish

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:16.560
Latin Paranoia remix. It's Paranoia

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.200
Aku Eka, or whatever that means, I don't know.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.200
And there's a DGI for it, too.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:29.200
...

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:34.200
...

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:39.200
...

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:44.200
...

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:49.200
...

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:56.200
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:24.200
in its entirety on Sunday night at the normal time, just so people don't get too confused.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:28.200
But if you're in the chat room wondering why you can't really participate live with the show tonight,

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:32.200
that's why, because we tape today early. We're on Saturday.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:39.200
So, we're back, and don't have a lot to talk about, so this is the point where we usually would let Loki do a Sim update.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.200
So, Loki, what's going on in the Sim world this week?

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:58.200
Not too much. They're wrapping up with the submissions for Turning Mix 3. Those are due next Sunday. That will be, I believe, the 15th, so make sure they have your stuff in by, I would say by 9pm at the latest.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:10.200
Definitely wait before that though, but try to get your stuff in for Turning Mix 3, and then I believe a week after that, they will be having actual submissions up on the web.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:16.080
to be up for about one whole week. So you want to get them then while you still can.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.200
Aside from that, there's a few other things to know. In DDArmaniaX, they've got in their

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:26.240
user submitted files for them. They have a nice little list of every single site that

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:30.400
has DWIs on it. And that's where actually that Paranoia Remix came from because there

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:37.600
is a DWI out there for that Paranoia Remix. So check that out and you can always increase

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:42.240
your collection that way. And just do watch that forum. They have some pretty good files

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.480
that have come out recently. I just got one for Baby Got Back. You got to love that song.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:53.880
So, definitely keep an eye on that. And also, nothing really new with StepMania. I have

01:08:53.880 --> 01:09:00.060
checked their site and it looks like that they are in preparations for starting betas

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:36.020
Um, I don't really know what these are. I mean, Reggie looks like he's got his giant

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:41.180
dunce hat on and he's holding the dog with a bow. And then there's Sabrina who's in a

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.060
bunny costume.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:47.180
Didn't they figure out, aren't they on their way to hacking the PC characters just about?

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:52.980
You were referencing something like on one of the boards that they found a way somehow

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:56.620
to hack the PC characters or you can load them in a program or something?

01:09:56.620 --> 01:10:03.720
I did look at that. All that you get from looking at the one file they're talking about,

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:09.640
the bin file, I believe, is you just get a nice little shot of their face. That's it.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.080
Sabrina the Teenage Bitch.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:16.880
Yes, so you've got this dog fucker and you've got some vampire bunny. That's what your characters

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.480
are this week, dog fucker and vampire bunny.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:23.280
Nothing compares to Mr. Spanky. Maybe we should have Mr. Spanky back on the show.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.280
show.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.280
Why not?

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.600
I think we'll have Mr. Spanky back on the show a little later.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:36.000
Yeah, so if you're still playing DDRPC, and to be honest I don't know why you would, do

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.000
check those out because really I think DDRPC lost its, I don't know, interest a couple

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.640
days after it came out.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.320
Oh, I've played all these songs before.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.120
Yeah, it's like, oh wait, this was fourth mix.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.720
I'll wait until we can hack this and put new songs in.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:11:01.220
Um, other things that should be noticed, there was, uh, I guess you could call them preview versions of Bag and Paranoia Survivor on the net.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:08.220
Actually, I should say, really ass copies of, uh, you know, Bag and Paranoia Survivor that were on Bimani style, they were...

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:12.220
Hey, guess what, Loki? I've got them right here. Wanna hear, wanna hear a little bit of Bag?

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.220
Oh, yeah, let's hear it.

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:18.220
Alright, here's a little bit of bag if you guys haven't heard it yet. Now it's really, really quiet, so bear with us. Here it is.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:41.220
You can kind of hear the bagpipe.

01:11:41.220 --> 01:12:08.580
It's Riverdance Yeah, woohoo

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.580
What do you think?

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:10.760
I think it's crap.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:16.420
What it sounds like is it's going to be like Orion 78, except it's going to be with bagpipes.

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:21.700
It's pretty much that they have the speed down to 65 for the steps to be really close

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:22.700
together.

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:23.700
It's just going to be Orion.

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:24.700
That's all it is.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:30.060
It's actually the kind of music I listen to when I'm trying to relax and calm down, so

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.500
I like it.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:38.220
I have all kinds of CDs like that at home, so it's right up my alley.

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:41.860
okay one here uh... paranoid survivor i don't i don't even think you can really

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:45.460
hear this one ball play a little bit of it all thing that you know i really are

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:50.620
in the video

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:58.620
you barely here

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:05.020
they really are it so uh... yeah i would get the videos but i i can't play videos

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:12.020
over the air, because we get a lot of droppage. So, that was a little bit.

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:19.660
From what I gather from the videos, it was a pretty cool sounding song. You can't really

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:25.700
listen to it on the videos, because they don't have anyone that can rip it yet, because the

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:32.700
Konami stuff is like, no, don't do that. So, yeah, not too much to see there either.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:37.700
Yeah, really been kind of a slow week in the whole Bomani community, just nothing going on.

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:44.700
It's just kind of that time of year, there's really not anything to really do between Thanksgiving and Christmas except shop, so there's probably not going to be.

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:48.700
I mean, DER Max USA came out for the holiday season, that was really the last thing.

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:55.700
We're probably not going to see anything until the beginning of the new year unless, you know, you've got BeatMania 7th Mix coming out for PlayStation on Christmas Eve.

01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.700
But that's about the only Bomani release coming up.

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:02.100
coming up, and then in the new year we're going to see Max 2 for Japanese PlayStation

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:10.600
2, and uh, um, what the hell, 2DX7 style, yes. Probably next year. Probably also Max

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:16.560
2 USA at some point, but I don't know, we have to, I haven't, I don't even know what,

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.560
I haven't heard anything as far as how well Max USA actually sold. I think we probably

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.760
won't get any numbers until actually after the holidays. We can look into that. I can

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:40.760
Cool. Also a couple of pop music games came out. They're working on a pop music best hits. I know that, and I believe 7 just came out, if I'm not mistaken. I could be wrong, but I think 7 just came out for PS2. I know it was the first pop music for PS2 just came out.

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:47.760
But... I don't know too much about that, unfortunately.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:54.760
Yeah, I did notice that they have, you know, like a DDR, they have the $2,000 metal pads,

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:59.240
which are kind of a rip-off, but they also have, you know, as people are aware of, the

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.600
2DX arcade controllers, and they also have a Poppy Music arcade controller, too.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.600
Yes.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.600
Question from Chat Room.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.520
When is DDR Extreme going to be released?

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.120
Ooh, Brad brings back toys for us, yay.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:14.760
Propel and food and drinks, anyway.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:39.760
When is Xtreme going to be released?

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:44.480
A rumor is it's going to debut at some tournament, but I don't possibly see how that could be

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.680
the case because it's a Japanese game, so if it's going to debut anywhere, it's going

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:53.880
to debut somewhere in Japan, and places in America will just get it whenever their distributors

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.880
get it.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.520
So I don't think there's any particular way that you can debut a game.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:03.880
Now that particular arcade might debut their game at the tournament, but you really can't

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.720
control the rest of the U.S. that way.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:15.220
I got it. Alright. So that's hopefully answers about Extreme. Well, also right now the betas

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:19.460
are only up to like 55 or 60 percent done. It's probably because they don't have many

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:23.660
of the Dance Media tracks in them. They have some, but not many. Yes, I mean, we've still

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:29.380
gotten plenty of songs that they have to add and test first, I mean, before that even happens.

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:36.380
so it's still a ways away.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:41.000
Okay, Chateroom's been talking a lot about this and I thought maybe we would too. Upcoming tournaments.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.980
There are a few tournaments coming up.

01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:45.580
I thought I'd mention a few of them.

01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:48.800
This Friday, if I'm not mistaken, yes, is this Friday,

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:53.520
is the Miggle Milpitas Golfland Evil Tournament Part 2, the aftermath. Yes, the arcade that

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.800
just got Derby's Owner's Club this week.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:01.120
doing a tournament and that should be a lot of fun it's on a Friday night so

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.080
it's kind of like a big giant Friday night party and they're doing the

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:11.840
typical perfect attack and freestyle competitions however they're trying some

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:17.360
new things with both of them so there's some new things that they're doing and

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:23.760
if you want to visit their website it's www.monkeysfly.net slash MGLT

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:29.800

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:33.520
the qualifying song that day and they're gonna be doing the brackets a little bit

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:38.320
of a different way freestyle is going to be doing this tower system it's a brand

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.560
new way of judging freestyle so that should be interesting they're gonna be

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.960
doing some new innovative judging and ranking at that tournament so check it

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:51.320
out also coming up we've got the cyber beat tournament that's gonna be

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.320

mistaken orange lounge radio will be covering this tournament for sure

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.040
unfortunately I'm not gonna be able to make it to Milpitas on Friday Jamie I

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.240

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.760
14th through 16th, huge, huge tournament. They're giving away a Max2 machine in freestyle.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.400
They are giving away a Max2 machine in freestyle. A couple rounds of freestyle they'll be doing.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:45.240
It might be on a DDR Extreme machine, the competition, if it's out by them. Perfect

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.920
Attack, they're going to give away a BeatMania 2DX arcade style controller for the winner

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.280
of Perfect Attack. So, I'm sorry, but they're not calling it Perfect Attack. They're calling

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:58.680
it Stepping, Stepping Category or Stepping Challenge? Stepping Attack, Step Attack? I

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:02.920
don't know. Sorry, I'm messing it up. I'm running through these very quickly. I don't

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:07.420
really have a lot of time to read into detail in this tournament. But if you want more information

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:11.660
on that tournament, it will be coming to ddrspot.com in the next few days. They're going to take

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:16.740
some pre-registration there, so keep an eye on that. Or there is a thread in the DDR Freak

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:23.460
DDR Freak Tourney Forum. Early next year in Fremont there's going to be a

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:28.220
competition at a pizza joint and that's run by one of our fans DCB. He's a cool guy

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:33.380
so I'm sure that's going to be a kick butt tourney. Outside of California, I'm

01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:36.900
trying to find some well-responded to threads, there's going to be a tournament

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:41.420
on December 21st in Baltimore, the town that doesn't listen to Orange Lounge

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:45.780
according to our rankings, but there is going to be a tournament at East Point

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.880
a great mall on December 21st in Baltimore, so if you're in that area you should check

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:53.780
it out. December 7th, I know I shouldn't promote that because I don't listen to this show,

01:19:53.780 --> 01:20:01.540

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:06.360
Perfect Attack Tournament for a Red Octane 2 mat.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.160
Word.

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.920
Yes, bring canned goods.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.920
The charity is for a Red Octane 2 mat.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.160
Buy me a Red Octane 2 mat.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.200
No, it's called the Winter Charity Tournament.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.120
I don't know.

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:19.640
I don't know.

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:22.320
I'm assuming that part of the money goes to buy the mat,

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.880
and the other part goes to charity.

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:25.000
That's how it works.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:25.500
Gasp.

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.320
Gosh, you guys.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.120
Well, maybe it's another tournament

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:36.900
this Red Octane sponsored because Red Octane owns your soul if you play DDR and they sponsor

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:40.060
every tournament except the ones that are... From what I heard is Red Octane is actually

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:44.060
going to be selling some of their products like their ignition pads and Gamestops now.

01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:51.060
Woo! So... Um, I can get confirmation on that, hello? Um, by the way, nothing like that's

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:57.100
been told to me and I'm always told everything that happens for Bemani in relation to Gamestop.

01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:04.100
I don't care! I have medal stages! So there! Ha ha!

01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:07.100
So those were some upcoming tournaments. Enjoy.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:10.100
I would love to go to the Swedish one.

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:12.100
I want to go...

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:16.100
Yeah, I know. Bikini babes. Big boner. Alright.

01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:21.100
First of all, playing DDR with no chest support sucks.

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.100
I can say this safely as the resolution.

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.100
Oh, I've always wondered. Let's ask a girl about their boobs.

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:32.020
Jamie, if you were to DDR in the nude, would that really hurt?

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:33.020
Would you get slapped in the face?

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:36.220
Well, first of all, I haven't, but I have played in my pajamas.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.180
Just imagine it.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:46.380
No, imagine having large amounts of your skin pulled away from your flesh and stuffed, and

01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:49.620
then imagine jumping up and down like that.

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:50.620
Ouch!

01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:52.380
Come on, every boy wants to know this.

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:54.540
What's DDR with boobies like?

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:56.060
Painful!

01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:59.560
What is the best way to- do you like having your boobs restrained when you play DDR?

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.560
It's like, you want to tie them down?

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.560
Shut up.

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.060
Shush.

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.560
No, I have to do the quote.

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.560
Penfold.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.560
Shush.

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:13.060
Anyone who gets that is cool.

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:17.560
What if we reduced ourselves to series?

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.560
I tried, ladies and gentlemen.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.060
I don't know, does it hurt being able to play DDR naked?

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.060
Do you like your balls pop around or something?

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.060
No.

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:25.060
No.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:26.060
Actually!

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:27.060
Alright, no.

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:31.180
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:34.980
Yeah, my balls aren't D-sized, though, so I would know, they're not even C or B.

01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:43.060
You'd be a ball bra!

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:44.060
Only a coco-

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.480
Who's got the biggest balls of them all?

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.440
Only a coconut ball bra.

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:51.560
Yeah.

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.060
So nobody in the studio will admit to playing DR in the new-

01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:56.060
to be an athletic supporter.

01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:58.060
Nobody in the studio is going to admit to playing DDR in the nude.

01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:00.060
Well, I don't play DDR at home.

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:04.060
That involves pulling out 45-pound stages, setting them on the ground.

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:08.060
Yeah, like I'm going to take the extra time to strip down naked to play DDR in my front room.

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:10.060
Why the hell did I do that?

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.060
That's stupid.

01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:16.060
Not to mention that that room is actually kind of small.

01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:18.060
You've got furniture in there.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.060
Yeah, the dogs rain around.

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:25.560
And there's seven on the fucking Chihuahua, I mean, it's not a pretty picture.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.560
Oh, Brad's back in the room.

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.760
Brad, have you ever played DDR in the nude?

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.360
That's for me to know and you to find out.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.360
Um, actually, honestly, no, I haven't.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.680
I've thought about it.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.760
I thought about doing intercourse while playing DDR, too.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.760
That would be interesting.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.440
It's like a couple, it's a whole new meaning to the couple dance.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:48.440
Oh, we had somebody in the chatroom admit to doing it at home.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.440
Bombay plays DDR on the nude at home.

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.440
Okay, I definitely can...

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.440
I believe that, yeah.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.440
Why am I not surprised?

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.440
Why am I scared?

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.440
Ow, my freaking ears!

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:09.440
Is anybody else submitting to playing DDR on the nude? No, nobody else. Okay.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.440
I played DDR on my pajamas before, though.

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.440
How was that?

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:15.440
Painful.

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.440
Was it breezy?

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:26.440
Well, seeing as how my pajamas usually consist of, you know, big flannel pants and a tank top, then no, not very.

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.440
Okay.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.440
Alright, we're going to stop being perverted now.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.440
It's my old house in the hood.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.440
Oh, it's your old house in the hood. Your house in the hood was cool.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.440
Okay.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:46.440
Uh, oh yes, I need to make the announcement, we're not going to be doing the cage match tonight because last week's song didn't get in until very late in the week

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:49.960
the week and we have the marathon going on all weekend long so it's not hardly

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.600
getting played at all plus we don't have all of our regular listeners so

01:26:53.600 --> 01:27:04.520
tonight's cage match is postponed well can we put both in the rotation no no we

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:10.440
can't you lose okay so let's see I'm trying to find my Abba covers and I

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.320
I think I only have one, but it's a good one.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:19.440
So we will play that one, if I can find it.

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:22.240
However, when we do come back from this break,

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.320
we are going to do the FUs of the week.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.080
So send those to me over a private message in the channel

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:28.680
right now.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:29.440
Or email them.

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:32.200
Or email them to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:34.720
We're going to do all of your FUs of the week

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.360
right after this break.

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:20.360
I wasn't jealous before we met Now every woman I see is a potential friend

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:31.360
Another says if it isn't nice You caught me saying that smoking was my only fight

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:48.360
Now it isn't true, now everything is new And all I've learned has all the turns I think of you

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:56.360
Don't go wasting your emotion

01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:02.360
Lay all your love on me

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.360
It was like shooting a certain light

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.360
A little small time is mine and baby, I'm stuck

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.360
I still don't know what you've done with me

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:26.360
I've grown up old but you've never felt so easily

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.360
You're the kind of fear

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.360
And I don't have it near

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:39.360
I'm satisfied, I keep my pride

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:43.360
I beg you dear

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:51.360
Don't come wasting your emotion

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:57.360
Play all your love for me

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:05.360
Don't come sharing your devotion

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:11.360
Lay all your love on me

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.360
I've had a few little love affairs

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.360
They didn't last very long

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.360
And they've been pretty scarce

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:41.360
I used to think that there's something but It takes the truth even more incomprehensible

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:48.360
Cause everything is new And everything is new

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:57.360
And all I've learned has overdone What can I do

01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:11.360
Don't come wasting your devotion Lay all your love on me

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:19.360
Don't go sharing your devotion

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:25.360
Lay all your love on me

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.360
What in the world is wrong with me?

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:54.360
Oh, it's time to come back to the sky

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.360
Ah, you have seven days left

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.360
What's left of everything?

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.360
You can't take me away

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:05.360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:30.260
Glance adapts to the lifelong

01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.240
Even if it doesn't look right

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:35.040
Asakara mama de

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:38.040
Maisatsu mo tsukuku

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:41.040
Itoshii aroku wa

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.040

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:47.040

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.040
Let's go somebody!

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.040
Let's go somebody!

01:36:34.040 --> 01:37:03.040
We'll go somewhere!

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:41.040
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.120
That's right, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, a special taped edition tonight.

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:49.120
We are taping on Saturday, but we've got a lot of people, a lot of our regulars are joining

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:52.920
us here on Saturday night, but if unfortunately you weren't able to listen until Sunday night,

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:53.920
that's okay too.

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.920
We forgive you.

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:55.920
We forgive you.

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.820
We're all going out and getting a life this week, so we had to change a few things.

01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:03.480
Now comes that part of the show that's everybody's favorite.

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:07.960
Jamie, please explain the F.U. of the Week, why it was created, what it's here for.

01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.000
We're pissed and we're not gonna take it anymore.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.200
We're not gonna take it.

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.280
No!

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.040
That's the song. You know what? That's what my new F.U. song ought to be. I don't give a shit if it has nothing to do

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:21.000
with Bomani. That's the song I want.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.760
Okay.

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:29.440
Here we go. Jamie's gonna start it off because she's the most angsty.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.580
So here we go, the FUs of the week.

01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:38.600
Okay, the first thing that gets the big fuck you is my computer.

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.220
My hard drive died.

01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.080
As in broken.

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.300
As in, it wouldn't even reformat.

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:51.420
My computer wouldn't boot one morning, so as your fam was off work, so he was gonna put the restore dust in and

01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:55.620
fix everything and make it happy again, and it didn't make it happy.

01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:58.600
It said, C drive is damaged.

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:02.240
So I'm sitting here going, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap all day at work.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.560
Um, basically, as it turned out, I didn't have to buy a new hard drive.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:10.900
Although, the good thing that came out of it is that I now have a 120 gigabyte hard drive

01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:16.000
with the 8 megabyte cache, so it's pretty cool.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.680
But still, I lost about 60 gigabytes worth of information

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.640
and some photographs that I can't get replaced because my mom's ex-husband destroyed them.

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:27.960
Fuck you, Michael.

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:30.880
Not her current husband Michael, but her ex-husband Michael.

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:35.440
Her current husband's cool. Anyway, that's the best point.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:41.500
It's just distressing, because I have, like I said, a lot of stuff on there, but I just can't get again.

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:48.500
And the ironic thing is that I was going to be backing everything up today, so... that sucks.

01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:51.060
That's better.

01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:52.300
That's your only...

01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:54.780
That and RO again.

01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:56.860
My grandpa and mine.

01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:58.100
All right.

01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:00.660
Dad, there's nobody for me to play Phantasy Star Online with.

01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:03.180
As soon as I can, I will. I'm buying that game as soon as it comes out.

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:05.720
Or as soon as I can get it.

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:12.720
All right? Cool. All right, Matt, Matt's turn.

01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:17.420
My first idea goes to the creators of TGR Max 2

01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:18.900
and the fact that

01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:21.300
they have to program so complexly that

01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:26.300
a simple peon like myself who has no programming knowledge will ever play packet. Why?

01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:32.740
why? Why won't you let me mess with this like everyone else does? Anyway, so, yeah, F.U.

01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:37.980
does a stupid max 2-disc because it's gonna suck and I can't do anything with him. Um,

01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:42.900
F.U. does a sub splash even though I'm going there tonight, um, for having all the games

01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:47.980
broken because they don't give a damn, and F.U. the fucking kid was playing Speed Demon

01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:52.620
all night on Thursday because I couldn't play Speed Demon because the fucker was taking

01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:59.620
it over. Kick his ass. F you that stupid kid who's a speed demon. And aside from that,

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:07.220
you know, not too much stuff I'm mad at, other than stupid people, stupid drivers, people

01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:14.220
ask dumb questions, that kind of thing. So, that's all.

01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:18.220
Alright, thank you for that angsty little rant.

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:28.220
My FU of the Week goes out to people that you go out on dates with that don't return your phone calls.

01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:32.220
How fucked up is that? I hate you.

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:38.220
My other FU of the Week... I don't know if I want to get into it.

01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:40.220
I have another pretty long FU to lead.

01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:43.220
My other FU of the week goes to immaturity.

01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:51.220
And people that try to send cryptic little messages that are really stupid and immature

01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:57.220
and try to make things into contests that aren't contests that are much more than contests.

01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:02.220
FU to stupid boys.

01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:26.980
p0k3smot42o

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:32.280
fucking rat. I don't care what you say. Any song that has a groovy little dance to go

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.980
with it. Rules. But those other step songs, yeah, they all suck, I'm sorry.

01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:42.920
YOSFVB says, F you to traffic and to people with microwaves creating interference which

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:47.680
disabled my telepathic waves from reaching Jamie to answer Propel. And fuck you to all

01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:53.280
those people now trying to use Propel as an adjective. And fuck you to Orange Lounge for

01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:56.280
for what seems to be porn talk prohibition.

01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:58.800
When did we ever stop talking about porn on here?

01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.320
In fact, I think we've had an increase in it.

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:04.640
Actually, I've got more I can talk to about that later.

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:05.680
No, you're banned.

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:10.720
Orange Beanie says,

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.680
F you to Naoki for getting to spend

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.920
so much time for Polteri.

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.760
Orange Beanie, by the way, actually being a Polteri fan.

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:21.640
And F you to The Point for making my fifth mixed dreams dead.

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:22.800
Dead, I tell you.

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:28.300
FU to the point, go to Crestview, they have 5th.

01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:32.800
Oh my lord, 23rd Magus says, I have a continued FU to Nori Nori Nori, as usual, a big FU to

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.440
being broke, which eliminates my chances of going to Scandi RVGL until January, cough,

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:40.600
donate to the United Magus College Fund, and a family sized FU to Nero's interface.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:43.960
I accidentally moved a folder while making a CD and produced 5 coasters until I found

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:44.960
out what happened.

01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:45.960
Fuck you ahead.

01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.880
Your program sucks, you bitches.

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.120
Go learn English, you fuckers.

01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.960
I'm punishing you with those FUs for not agreeing with me in the match game.

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:53.960
Bwah!

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:54.960
Supper!

01:43:54.960 --> 01:44:03.960
Brak2000 says, FU to Captain Jack for not doing a cover of Oh Nick Please Not So Quick.

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:07.800
I agree, I agree.

01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:08.800
Dang!

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:13.440
Lots of FUs from Stresa, FU'd who his ex, she dumped me the day after my 20th birthday,

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:18.080
but we're still so hung up on each other and she's killing me, but I'll survive, and I'd

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:20.080
I'd also like to throw an F.U. at my parents.

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:26.080
They've been plotting against me to kick out since June, and I'd like to shove a horse-sized F.U. in my mommy's booty.

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:29.080
Why does my mom deserve a horse-sized F.U., especially in the booty?

01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:34.080
For finding ways to throw my flaws back at my face for childish reasons. Oh my.

01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:40.080
Too bad Sally Jessy's not still around, because that would sound like something you need to go talk to Sally Jessy about.

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:45.080
Maybe you could go to Dr. Phil.

01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:49.240
twen says at you within thirty minutes i found out the girl i love the got into a

01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:53.960
major car accident and is engaged and has a two-year-old in a six months on

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:55.320
well that's

01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.880
what happened to the lesbian

01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.400
i'm sorry to hear about

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.800
the car accident that's that's a bummer

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.200
well i would say

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:04.400
if you did that

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:09.320
if it was a lesbian and i'd say it's karma coming back to play

01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:12.080
no it's not

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:16.080
Let's check the old mailbag.

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.080
Some people sent in their FUs because they knew we wouldn't be on on Sunday.

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:24.080
Vidpower says, for the third week in a row, my main FU still goes to germs.

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:28.080
My cough has gotten worse this week and my throat is sore because of it. Also, FU to reading

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:32.080
boring schoolbooks and FU to the dark environments in Metroid Prime. I literally can't

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:36.080
see a Waldus a few inches away from my face, but a very fun game nonetheless.

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.080
You know what that cough is? It's the Ebola. You're gonna die. Bye.

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:42.080
F-E-B-O-L-A

01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:20.540
Okay. All the entries are due by Sunday, December 22nd at midnight.

01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:22.540
And where must they submit them?

01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:28.980
They must send them to my email or give them to me in person.

01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:33.700
They can be in any format as long as there's some way I can see the step file or step chart

01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:36.820
or have an edit file for it.

01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:41.820
That's all I really need.

01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:45.220
nightmare underscore

01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:47.260
so it's nightmare hunter

01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:49.820
yahoo dot com

01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:53.100
uh... make sure you put the nice little underscore there between nightmare and hunter

01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:54.820
and uh...

01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:56.660
other than that you know

01:48:56.660 --> 01:49:01.120
if you're local you know give it to me in person and all entries will be judged

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:03.900
on uh... january the fifth

01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:04.900
that's a sunday

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:08.680
and they're gonna be announced on right here on orange island radio the winners right yes cool

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:12.600
And I have quite a bit of porn to grant, so there might actually be for a second.

01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:16.920
Now very briefly, for those new to the show, what is Make Edit Get Porn?

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:20.120
Well, I've held many edit contests before.

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:24.920
I decided to do one that's a little different, just exclusive to the home version of Max

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:25.920
USA.

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:29.280
This time around, instead of giving out my normal prizes, which would be videos and DVDs

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.400
and stuff, I'm giving out pornography!

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:34.400
Porno tapes!

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.400
Yay!

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:39.920
And so we have Make It Get Porn, just like the title says.

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:44.120
And you'll get a big box of, you know, porno tapes, pretty much that consist of mostly

01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:45.120
Playboy movies.

01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.960
I mean, I don't really consider them porn, I mean, they're kind of skidimax, they're

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:52.360
kind of porn, but they're not, I don't know, it's hard to say.

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:56.680
But you know, you'll get those, and I mean, those are pretty expensive, actually, they're

01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:00.760
about $22.98 a piece, so you are saving quite a bit of money to be able to go out and buy

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:03.660
those tapes and find out that they're crap.

01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:32.660
If a woman wins, then we'll just have to find some boy porn to throw in the box.

01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:33.660
Yes.

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.660
Pun intended.

01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:43.660
Anyways, so that's going on, and like I said, you've got no time to do it.

01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:48.780
So get your Trini Mix 3 stuff done this week, and then get your Make It Again Porn stuff

01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:50.980
done next week.

01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:52.380
All right, that was Make It Again Porn.

01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:55.700
Let's talk about some new shit that's coming out in Japan soon.

01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:59.100
We've got the Dance Mania series, you hear some of their tracks here right here on Orange

01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:00.100
Lawn's radio.

01:51:00.100 --> 01:51:02.100
They've got some new albums coming out very soon.

01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:06.940
On December 11th, Classical Speed comes out.

01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:10.540
That's all your favorite classical tunes on fucking crack.

01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:15.240
Oh, we even have some real audio clips we can play for you.

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.840
This is the Radetsky March by Strauss.

01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:19.860
We're going to listen to a clip of that.

01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:21.340
This is from the Classical Speed album.

01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:22.340
This is track number two.

01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:23.340
Hopefully this works.

01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:24.740
Perform a speed orchestra.

01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:27.180
This is by the Speed Orchestra.

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.180
It's queuing up here.

01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:29.180
Give it a minute.

01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:33.220
preview of classical speed right here on Orange Lawn's radio, which is timing out

01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:40.220
on me. Wait, here we go. Loading, loading, here we go.

01:51:40.220 --> 01:52:08.880
That was the Rydetsky March.

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:11.800
That was done by the Speed Orchestra.

01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:14.520
Other ones that should be noted, they have the Saber Dance.

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:18.000
No, we don't have a clip of Saber Dance, unfortunately.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.280
Swan Lake, Marchy, Military, Victory March.

01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:24.280
Want to hear a Victory March?

01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.440
Or how about, how about let's hear a clip of Ode to Joy.

01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:30.120
This is a Beethoven song, so let's hear this clip of Ode to Joy.

01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.120
Everybody knows this song.

01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:34.160
Everybody who ever took piano had to play this song at one point or another.

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:35.160
Another?

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:36.160
Let's hear this one.

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:43.160
by the way

01:52:43.160 --> 01:53:06.160
Hey Tobin! Hey Tobin! Hey Tobin! Hey Tobin!

01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:10.160
Very nice. Somebody in the shower room says, oh, that's kind of like end of the century.

01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:16.160
Yes. First of all, End of the Century is kind of like Ode to Joy, get it right.

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:21.160
It's a little bit similar, yes. There's a brand new Captain Jack album coming out.

01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:27.160
Rock the Fuck On. It's called Party Warriors. Fucking rock, that's all I had to say.

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:31.160
We only have a clip of one song, but it's got a great name, so I'm sure it's awesome.

01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:36.160
This is a song called Centerfold, and actually it looks like this album is just a bunch of remixes.

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:40.560
So we got Heya, Iko Iko, Party Warriors, and this one, Centerfold.

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:44.360
Hey, hey, it's a bag!

01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:47.860
Oh my gosh, it's Centerfold.

01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:52.660
Dude, I'm gonna be 80 to make you into that.

01:53:52.660 --> 01:54:10.060
Go captain, go captain, go captain, alright that was a centerfold, a little bit of a clip

01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:11.900
there.

01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:17.260
And also coming out, Dance Mania Speed 10.

01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:19.740
And this is going to scare a lot of you.

01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:26.560
The very first track is Nancy and the Boys, and they're covering everybody's favorite

01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:32.600
artist these days. They're doing a cover of an Avril Lavigne song. Let's hear how awful

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:33.600
it is.

01:54:33.600 --> 01:55:03.460
I can be on a speed album, jesus!

01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:09.460
Oh, the OSF-EB wants a cover of Dirty on Speed 10. No, unfortunately that's not going to happen.

01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:16.460
But we do get some other cool stuff. We have A Little Less Conversation. That was the Elvis song that made a big comeback. We have a clip of that.

01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:20.460
That's the second track on the album. Done by the CJ Crew.

01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:27.460
who did some

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:44.180
yeah i don't really like this what else is on the album

01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:47.340
uh... wild child privatized give it up relax

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:50.640

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.740

01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:56.100

01:55:57.740 --> 01:55:59.380

01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:02.540

01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:06.040

we might be in for some real hell on speed ten yeah i know which cover brian

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:25.260
Radio Rockin', Want Your Love, Here To Stay, and we have another clip of Sectember by DJ Speedo. Love the name.

01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:27.260
It's almost as lovely as DJ Mangu.

01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:38.260
I know this song. This is probably going to be like a DVR.

01:56:38.260 --> 01:57:07.280
So those are some new things that we can look forward to from the

01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:10.880
Toshiba EMI series is coming out very soon.

01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:14.960
And since we never really talked about it, let's talk about some other things that we've

01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:16.040
had come out recently.

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:21.920
DanceMania EX-1 just came out not too long ago, had some good stuff on it.

01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:25.800
The return of Smile DK, Captain Jack and Erotic all on a DanceMania album, that was pretty

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:26.800
cool.

01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:31.280
And Lollipop, actually I do have Lollipop on my CD that I brought today.

01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:33.520
Oh, cool.

01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:37.160
I do have Lollipop actually on the drive somewhere.

01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:40.920
I'll be perfectly happy if I don't have to hear that song, thank you.

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:46.340
I also have doggy style.

01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:49.040
That sounds scary.

01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:51.680
Weird, I didn't realize people left the house here.

01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:55.240
I just had somebody come online who I thought was here at the house.

01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:56.540
Uh, let's...

01:57:56.540 --> 01:58:00.880
I guess we're going to go to a break, and when we come back we're going to do a list list.

01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:04.040
I don't know if we have enough people to do a list list. Do we still have one person here?

01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:07.540
I think she's still playing

01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:10.780
Animal Crossing. We'll see if we have enough people to do listless.

01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:15.020
We'll try to do that. If not, we'll think of something. We'll just do a three-person

01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:17.360
listless if we have to.

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.660
We'll do a three-person listless if we have to. Fine.

01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:25.300
In the meantime, we're going to take a break, and I had a request for something, and I don't even remember what it was.

01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:28.380
I could talk about NewTek porn.

01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:31.080
Okay, talk about what you want to talk about.

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:35.280
hold on let me see if we have anybody else in the front room to do

01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.760
I get the chair

01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:39.920
No you don't, I get the chair

01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:41.160
Comfy

01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:42.380
He's

01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:45.680
looking semi-orgasmic now

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:47.320
It feels so good

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:50.940
Is it squishy?

01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:54.100
Anyways, NewTek. NewTek's a new

01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:57.160
studio we actually start distributing at my company now

01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:59.680
they're an adult anime studio

01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:05.840
and they were so kindly enough to send me three samples of their products.

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:07.360
So, here today

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:10.760
I am going to review three different titles. We have Leather Man

01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:12.280
volume three,

01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:17.240
we have DNA Hunters volume one, and we also have one called

01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:22.840
uh... shut out, I don't remember the last one. I think Kelly or Katie, I can't remember what the name is.

01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:26.120
I'll just call it Katie.

01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:29.360
So, start off with DNA Hunter volume one.

01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:35.760
uh... this is a story about

01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:38.540
reviewing an important

01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:42.560
the other it's a basically about there's this woman her husband died

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:44.780
and she really wants to have a and

01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:47.280
problem is that she was ever husband's baby so

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.920
in order to do that she has to kind of cloned his DNA or something like that

01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:50.840
anyways

01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:54.320
so in order to get the money to do this she has to become a DNA hunter now what

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:56.580
DNA hunter is is basically

01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:57.560
it's a woman

01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:01.840
Women come to this company, and they say, I want this man's baby.

02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:05.840
So in order to do that, they have to have these women that work for this company go

02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:11.680
and have sex with these people, and then they collect the DNA, or semen, from these people,

02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:17.520
and then turn sell it to the women that want to have those, you know, celebrities' babies.

02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:19.400
Thus, DNA Hunter.

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:21.880
I have to say that this was an utter disappointment.

02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:23.920
The title sucked ass.

02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:26.120
It really was boring as hell.

02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:35.120
Um, the very first, um, the thing that she has to act, the guy she has to have sex with is her, like, old boss from her previous job who's, like, this really old guy.

02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:40.120
And no one wants to see some hot chick screw in an old guy, even if it is animated, so.

02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:45.120
Really awful. I hear the rest of the series is good, but no. Awful, awful, awful.

02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:47.120
Leather Man Volume 3.

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:52.120
Pretty interesting, um, title since I have to start watching it in the middle.

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:56.120
It's basically this guy carrying around a sack of money.

02:00:56.120 --> 02:01:00.120
I don't know why he's carrying around a sack of money, because obviously I haven't seen the first episode, so I don't really know.

02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:06.120
And he's going around and people just start having sex with him for no apparent reason whatsoever.

02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:12.120
They're trying to steal the money, and it's kind of like Golden Boy, but X-rated.

02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:20.120
You've got the guy, he's making women feel better about themselves, giving them more confidence and stuff, yet has sex with them and stuff like that.

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:27.120
I don't know. It's pretty good. No real plot to get in the way. Lots of sex. Fun, fun, fun.

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:33.120
The other one, I believe it was called Katie. I can't remember what the actual name was.

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:43.120
It's about this kind of cheerleader, not really a cheerleader, but she's like the head of the, kind of the pep team or whatever.

02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:55.120
And she is being blackmailed by the rest of her team to do all these things like, you know, do cheers with, like, a vibrant strap dinner and stuff, and kind of stuff like that.

02:01:55.120 --> 02:02:02.120
And she ends up at the very end turning into a slut. So you get to watch this, you know, cute girl get transformed into a slut at the end of the movie.

02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:07.120
So, of course, everyone likes that. That's it. That's all I've got.

02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:08.120
Beautiful.

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:13.000
a quick break and we'll be back to talk about something bimani related and maybe actually we're

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000
gonna do a list list when we come back by request this break this is the only song we're gonna play

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.680
this break because it's kind of long it's six minutes long but it's very cool it's out phase

02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:26.440
doing 0.59 live so uh it starts off a little bit quiet though so don't think that we dropped or

02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:30.920
anything it just has a quiet intro it's got one of those windy noises things so uh enjoy this song

02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:32.920
and we'll be back.

02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:02.920
Oh

02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:49.160
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:50.160
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:51.160
No!

02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:52.160
Do we care what people think of us?

02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:53.160
No!

02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:54.160
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:55.160
Yes!

02:08:55.160 --> 02:09:07.560
of us? No! Do we want people to kiss our ass? Yeah! Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange

02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:14.680
Lounge Radio. Hello once again my friends, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio pre-taped

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:20.200
this week. We're live on Saturday night, December the 7th, but this is actually technically

02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:25.520
the show for December the 8th. It'll be played both nights. So we're gonna do a

02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:30.940
little segment called List List. It's everybody's favorite. Tonight the topic

02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:36.140
is, and those of you in the chat room will get to assist us with voting on the

02:09:36.140 --> 02:09:45.100
winners of this, tonight's topic is the top three things I hate about Christmas.

02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:50.100
Yes, it's the top things that we hate about Christmas.

02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:58.100
The way the list works, the list list segment works is that we're going to compile a list.

02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:05.100
Our fabulous in-studio celebrities will compile a list of their top things that they hate about Christmas.

02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:09.100
And then one by one we'll each eliminate something that we hate about Christmas,

02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:12.100
or that we might actually like about Christmas, someone else hates.

02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:14.100
Things that should not be on the list.

02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:21.100
And then the chat room will vote on the ultimate list of things that they hate about Christmas.

02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:23.100
Let's start off. Who started last time?

02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:26.100
Jamie, did you start last week? I don't remember. Let's start with Loki.

02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:27.100
Let's start with Loki.

02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:31.100
Loki, what is the number three thing that you hate about Christmas?

02:10:31.100 --> 02:10:35.100
Gotti Christmas decorations.

02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:41.100
Basically, you know, the white trash light setups, you know, in front of people's houses.

02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:44.100
Gotti Christmas Decorations is number three on...

02:10:44.100 --> 02:10:47.100
Does it look like Christmas threw up all over the houses?

02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:48.100
Exactly.

02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:52.100
We were just driving down the street the other day and Jamie said,

02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:56.100
Christmas barfed on that house. Christmas barfed on that house.

02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:59.100
So, Gotti Christmas Decorations, Loki's number three answer.

02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:02.100
We have the Rice Princess in the studio. She's helping us out tonight with Listless.

02:11:02.100 --> 02:11:07.100
Irene, what is your number three pick for Thing You Hate About Christmas?

02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:13.180
Well, you have to say dumb, nosy relatives.

02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:16.940
When you have to see those relatives you never see but Christmas time and they always want

02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:17.940
to know what you're doing.

02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:19.780
It's like, well, if I wanted you to know, I would have told you.

02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:22.740
I would have sent you a letter or called you or something.

02:11:22.740 --> 02:11:25.540
Dumb, nosy relatives, Irene's number three answer.

02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:26.540
Very nice, very nice.

02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:27.540
Thank you.

02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:31.560
My number three answer would be parking lots.

02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:36.740
I hate parking lots normally and around Christmas time, it gets ten times as worse.

02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:41.800
People cannot drive in a parking lot, they are cutthroat going for each other's spaces,

02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:45.520
they stay and they park their car in the middle of the aisle, so when you're trying to go

02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:49.040
around to get a spot, you're trapped there, that shit pisses me off more than anything

02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.160
else in the whole world.

02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:56.400
Jamie, you're number three pick for something you hate about Christmas.

02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.920
Decorations going up before Halloween.

02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:05.440
Oh, decorations that go up before Halloween, very nice.

02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:09.320
What about decorations that stay up after Valentine's Day?

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:15.040
I don't know what to steal out there, I just don't like them going up for my favorite holiday.

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:17.160
Alright, what if they're orange lights though?

02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:20.800
If it's for Halloween, then sure.

02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:21.800
Cool.

02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:22.800
Alright.

02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:27.560
Loki, your number two answer for a thing that pisses you off about Christmas.

02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:29.880
Christmas music.

02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:30.880
All of it.

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:32.680
All of it must go.

02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:35.200
Don't change your music programming.

02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:42.080
the artist that made it. Hunt them down. I will pay ransom. Actually, bounty. A bounty

02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:47.080
for everybody that makes Christmas music. I want them all dead.

02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:51.840
Okay. All right, Christmas music. Irene, your number two answer.

02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:58.520
Having no money or resources to buy or make gifts.

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:04.360
Sex. Anything else you want to elaborate on there?

02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:08.500
All right.

02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:15.660
My number two answer is political correctness.

02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:19.100
Because somewhere right now there's probably somebody that would be whining about how we

02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:23.920
shouldn't say Christmas because it's the winter holiday season and everybody celebrates something

02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:24.920
different.

02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:25.920
But you know what?

02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:28.040
There are some people out there that don't even celebrate holidays.

02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:29.740
So you know what?

02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:33.940
Just Christmas for all practical purposes means everything, okay?

02:13:33.940 --> 02:13:37.940
I'm not like a Bible-thumper religious person, but I just say, Christmas, it's presents,

02:13:37.940 --> 02:13:38.940
you get stuff.

02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:42.400
I don't care what other people celebrate, but don't freakin' get all huffy and puffy

02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:46.220
when somebody else, you know, celebrates something you don't.

02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:48.260
You don't have to try so damn hard to be different.

02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:49.260
Just go with it.

02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:50.260
Rawr!

02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:53.780
I hate political correctness.

02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:57.260
And this, the thing that kind of triggered this was that we have this thing at work that

02:13:57.260 --> 02:14:01.780
we do every winter, and we're not even allowed to call it, we can't call it a Christmas party,

02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:03.380
You can't call it a Hanukkah party.

02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:04.920
We can't call it a Kwanzaa party.

02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:09.060
We can't even call it a holiday party because not everyone celebrates holidays.

02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:13.780
We have to call it a winter appreciation party.

02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:15.180
That is so stupid.

02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:23.420
Jamie, your number two thing that you hate about Christmas?

02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:26.700
I have one that's more personal, so I'm not going to say that one.

02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:27.700
Okay.

02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:28.700
I'll mention it.

02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:32.980
like being away from my family for the fourth Christmas in a row, you know, since they're

02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:36.060
all out in Alabama, so I'll put it this way.

02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:43.380
I think that what I don't like about the whole holiday season is just that, how over commercialized

02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:44.700
it is.

02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:48.500
Over commercialized, all right.

02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:52.300
You know, it's always buy, buy, buy, buy, and people don't seem to realize that there's

02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:58.460
supposed to be more meaning to the season than just, I mean, I like shopping for gifts

02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:04.640
like giving them because that's just how I am but there's when it's being used as

02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:09.820
an excuse for more people to put money in their pockets I don't like that

02:15:09.820 --> 02:15:15.460
all right that's a very good rant I like that all right Loki number one thing

02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:19.700
that pisses you off about Christmas those people dressed up like Santa

02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:24.940
Claus outside of grocery stores outside of malls everything working for the

02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:30.720
The Salvation Army. F you to the Salvation Army. They don't need my money any time of

02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:36.880
the year, nor during Christmas, and they aren't getting a penny of it.

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:38.120
Thank you, Mr. Grinch.

02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:39.120
Thank you.

02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:40.120
Gosh, Scrooge.

02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:43.560
I hope you see the three ghosts.

02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:44.560
All right.

02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:45.560
I'm kidding.

02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:48.140
Irene, the number one thing you hate about Christmas.

02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:53.880
Not knowing what to get people for Christmas. I hate it. Just tell me what you want, what

02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:56.980
you really, really want, and I'll get it for you.

02:15:56.980 --> 02:15:59.880
Not knowing what to give people, alright, good answer.

02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:04.700
My number one answer is already on the list, but I'll just say it anyway, we'll just have

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:05.760
a duplicate.

02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:10.200
My number one thing I hate about Christmas is Christmas carols, so that goes right along

02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:11.200
with Christmas music.

02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:14.400
You can pick something other than Christmas carols on the line.

02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:21.840
Okay, how about Christmas carolers?

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:26.240
Like the beginning of the Addams Family movie? That's the best thing ever.

02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:32.820
I hate, okay, I was going to say you could have used this one. Christmas TV specials.

02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:37.160
No, because the Grinch is cool. No, no, no. I'm not talking about the Grinch.

02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:40.720
Grinch is cool, keep the Grinch. If I'm talking about like they have this one here, it's a

02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:45.360
musical special with John Ritter hosting. John Ritter should not be on TV.

02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:50.440
Not since Three's Company anyway. Yeah, Three's Company was cool.

02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:57.080
All right, Jamie, the number one answer.

02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:02.640
Misinterpretation of the holiday, as in all these, and I have to give background, I was

02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:09.140
born Southern Baptist, you know, I still believe in God in general, but I lean more toward

02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:14.120
the pagan side of my beliefs, and I love it when people go, oh, Jesus was born on Christmas

02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:15.120
Day.

02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:16.120
That's bullshit!

02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:19.400
He was born in like June, okay?

02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:22.320
This is a pagan holiday, okay?

02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:28.880
The yule tree, the log, you know, the candles, all of it is a pagan holiday.

02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:30.440
Get it right.

02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:34.720
If you want dates and proof and everything, I can go grab all of my college books and

02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:36.280
pull that right up where that tradition started.

02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:40.120
I actually think that somebody posted a link in the chat room if you want more information

02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:41.120
on that.

02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:42.120
Thank you.

02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:43.120
I think.

02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:46.920
I am so sick of this, and that's part of the reason why I stopped going to the specials

02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:49.520
at church was because of this.

02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:52.040
Oh, Christmas Day, blah, blah, no!

02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:53.800
You're wrong, you're stupid.

02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:57.760
You're buying into what you've been fed all of your life.

02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:00.160
Try thinking for yourself.

02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:01.160
I don't like that.

02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:03.880
No, that's my number one pet peeve about Christmas.

02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:04.880
Alright.

02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:08.840
I just stopped going to church because it was damn boring, and I didn't really care.

02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:12.400
Except there was this one priest that looked like Weirdo Yankovic, and that entertained

02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:15.960
myself enough to stay away for about half of it.

02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:19.960
All right. Boy, not a single Balmani-related thing on this list. I'm really proud of you

02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:27.280
guys. Okay. You know what? I don't know. I'm going to entertain something here in the studio

02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:31.040
here. I don't think I feel comfortable eliminating any of these, because they're all things that

02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:34.400
really suck about Christmas. So I think as a Christmas present, we should let our chat

02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:36.240
room pick from all of these options. What do you guys think?

02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:37.240
Sure.

02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:40.840
All right. So we're not going to eliminate anything. You guys can pick anything from

02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:43.760
this list, because I don't know about the others, but I don't...

02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:45.480
We're extra bitter today.

02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:49.120
i don't uh... i can't i don't see anything on this list i really feel

02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:53.000
comfortable getting rid of so i can't even at the list i hate the stupid like

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.840
people that come around working on the wedding

02:18:55.840 --> 02:18:59.080
the boy scouts and girl scouts want me to buy shit

02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:01.920
i didn't need to know gracias

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:02.940
but but but

02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:05.240
i love it

02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:10.200
the adams family is like the best christmas movie

02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.960
uh... some things that the uh... channel girl scout chat room suggestions that

02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:14.960
that we missed.

02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:15.960
Blood chip flavor.

02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:17.880
Things in the chatroom that we missed.

02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:18.880
Eggnog.

02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:19.880
I like eggnog.

02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:21.560
I know, I like eggnog too.

02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:23.840
I like alcoholic eggnog.

02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:25.680
Getting socks and underwear.

02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:29.160
Hey, I could use that, okay?

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:31.240
My socks and underwear just disappear.

02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:36.640
They just like, whoa, whoa, damn underpants gnomes.

02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:37.880
Underpants gnomes.

02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:40.920
And let's see, what else did they say?

02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:43.100
and they were saying Silent Hill owns you.

02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:44.620
I guess that's it.

02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:45.740
Those are the only two things.

02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:47.220
Okay, so send in your votes now

02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:49.140

02:19:49.140 --> 02:19:51.360
And to celebrate, how about a little Christmas cheer

02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:54.100
for all of you here on Orange Lounge Radio.

That's all the I will do, I'll see you tomorrow I will be drinking a toast to you, it's such

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.000
A special day

Tonight is the night for our lovers

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:38.000
We wish we could have

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:41.000
This feeling

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Through the weather here

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Christmas is here

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Christmas is here

02:20:51.000 --> 02:21:00.000
If you, I want you, I want you, I want you

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Night falls on you

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:12.000
And if you want me and you

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:16.000
You can buy me what you want

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:21.920
Night, nightfall, it's the start of a new year

02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:27.000
Oh, I'm falling, no, I can't, I must love you to be here

Just how did you know Christmas is here?

Can you hear me from above?

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Do you feel the face of me?

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000
What's been through?

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:50.000
We do in the air

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Just in time

02:23:53.000 --> 02:24:05.000
No one cares to stop Can you see me from above?

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Do you share my frozen memories? Set it down

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Let it in, let it out, let it out

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Let it in, let it out, let it out

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Let us love, let it in

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Please give me a new star tonight

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:42.000
To create a world full

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Let's not face me Please give me back my yesterday

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:58.000
It's not for me Take my hand

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Let's not face me

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Oh

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:45.000
We indeed do have a list.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:20.280
Here is the final list of the top three things you all hate about Christmas.

02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:22.600
We helped, you voted, here it is.

02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:34.080
The number three thing that you hate about Christmas is Christmas carolers.

02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:40.160
The number two thing you hate about Christmas is that it's over commercialized, with hallmarks

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:42.680
stamped on the back.

02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:47.920
And the number one thing that everybody in the chat room and we all hate about Christmas

02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:50.840
is political correctness.

02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:51.840
Yeah.

02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:54.080
And that's correct spelled with one R.

02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:57.400
Shut up, shut up.

02:27:57.400 --> 02:27:58.400
Just shut up.

02:27:58.400 --> 02:27:59.400
Correct.

02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:02.920
Oh, they're saying I should use the movie, they're saying I should use the movie phone

02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:03.920

Oh, yes, we haven't heard from Mr. Spanky yet tonight.

02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:39.460
I do believe we're going to do a Mr. Spanky update a little later.

02:28:39.460 --> 02:28:41.740
Oh, now you're not so sure?

02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:42.980
We need good porn tips.

02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:43.980
We need good porn tips?

02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:44.980
Yes.

02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:45.980
Okay.

02:28:45.980 --> 02:28:48.260
Well, we'll get Mr. Spanky back on the show right before it's over.

02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:49.260
How's that sound?

02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:50.260
Okay.

02:28:50.260 --> 02:28:51.260
All right, cool.

02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:52.260
Jamie, you've got to explain.

02:28:52.260 --> 02:28:53.980
I noticed one F.U. you left out.

02:28:53.980 --> 02:28:58.580
I don't remember if you talked about it last week, but you've got these Leet Max 2 shoes

02:28:58.580 --> 02:28:59.580
and they're breaking.

02:28:59.580 --> 02:29:05.420
I bought these vans, they're black and they have flames going up the sides and they're

02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:06.660
already starting to tear up.

02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:11.020
My last pair of vans lost to me like a whole freaking year and these are just falling to

02:29:11.020 --> 02:29:14.700
bits so I got to get new man shoes.

02:29:14.700 --> 02:29:18.500
But I'm going to wear these until they die, damn it.

02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:25.460
Okay, I'm being asked to read a paper that 23rd Magus wrote that he got an A on.

02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:28.580
It better be Bimani related or I'm not going to do it.

02:29:28.580 --> 02:29:37.860
Oh yeah, there's an article in the paper, tell us about that, Matt.

02:29:37.860 --> 02:29:40.460
Fuckin' vinyl, I haven't read it.

02:29:40.460 --> 02:29:48.220
Anyways, my friend Eric, also known as Punkknight, he wrote an article in, I don't remember what

02:29:48.220 --> 02:29:49.220
the magazine is.

02:29:49.220 --> 02:29:56.980
Oh, it's a local paper here, uh, help me, don't, uh, Wired Herd or something like that?

02:29:56.980 --> 02:29:57.980
Wired Head, I bet.

02:29:57.980 --> 02:30:05.980
Yeah, something like that. Anyways, Wired Head magazine, and it's about DDR. I think Rob gets quoted on it.

02:30:05.980 --> 02:30:08.980
Yeah, apparently. I haven't even seen it yet. I need to find a copy of it.

02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:15.940
I know that there's a few down where my friend works, if you're local, down in Folsom at

02:30:15.940 --> 02:30:28.940
uh, at um, shit, Pizza Place, um, Ciro's Pizza Place at um, Bloorveen and Prairie City Road.

02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:34.280
So if you're local in Folsom, you can check it out there, otherwise, wherever Wired heads

02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:35.280
at.

02:30:35.280 --> 02:30:41.580
it like it enjoy it there I'm sorry well Matt was talking about wirehead Jamie is

02:30:41.580 --> 02:30:45.180
noticing that if you shake a bottle or propel like a lot and then let it sit

02:30:45.180 --> 02:30:55.800
there it looks like cum tasty this looks like it could do a lot of damage to some

02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:59.500
sort of bodily orifice this propel bottle and and well Jamie what was your

02:30:59.500 --> 02:31:02.420
comment as soon as you took a sip of that shake and water it ain't salty

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:04.420
That's right, it ain't salty.

02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:06.420
Alright.

02:31:06.420 --> 02:31:07.420
Let's...

02:31:07.420 --> 02:31:08.420
HP...

02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:10.420
Your HP tastes good.

02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:12.420
Okay, here we go.

02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:13.420
We're going to talk now.

02:31:13.420 --> 02:31:14.420
We're going to read this paper.

02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:17.420
It is Bemani-related because it's about Shaft.

02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:18.420
That tournament.

02:31:18.420 --> 02:31:21.420
So, 23rd Magus wrote this paper for one of his classes,

02:31:21.420 --> 02:31:22.420
so I thought we'd read it,

02:31:22.420 --> 02:31:24.420
and I'll give our little smart-ass comments on it.

02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:25.420
How's that sound?

02:31:25.420 --> 02:31:27.420
Here we go.

02:31:27.420 --> 02:31:29.420
Yes, that's right.

02:31:29.420 --> 02:31:31.420
Reading the paper, reading the paper.

02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:33.420
Stand by to win.

02:31:33.420 --> 02:31:37.420
I went to Shaft and all I got was this lousy roast beef.

02:31:37.420 --> 02:31:42.420
One of my favorite and strangest hobbies is playing Dance Dance Revolution,

02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:46.420
an arcade game in which you must step on arrow panels in time to the music.

02:31:46.420 --> 02:31:50.420
Many people, such as myself, go further than the game requires,

02:31:50.420 --> 02:31:55.420
working the arrows into a dance routine, in other words, weave freestyle.

02:31:55.420 --> 02:31:57.420
Recently...

02:31:57.420 --> 02:31:59.420
Not if you're white.

02:31:59.420 --> 02:32:00.420
What?

02:32:02.420 --> 02:32:03.420
Keep reading.

02:32:03.420 --> 02:32:04.420
What are you laughing at, Logan?

02:32:04.420 --> 02:32:10.420
Recently, Scandia Fun Center hosted a DDR tournament for those playing accuracy at...

02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:11.420
What?

02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:12.420
Read!

02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:14.420
No, I want to know what the joke is.

02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:15.420
Read.

02:32:16.420 --> 02:32:17.420
Here, you shut it down.

02:32:17.420 --> 02:32:18.420
Alright.

02:32:18.420 --> 02:32:19.420
Oh, okay.

02:32:19.420 --> 02:32:20.420
Okay.

02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:21.420
Can I finish?

02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:22.420
Can I finish?

02:32:22.420 --> 02:32:23.420
Can I finish?

02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:24.420
Can I finish?

02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:25.420
Thank you.

02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:26.420
Yes.

02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:28.420
Okay, moving on with 23 Magus's Paper.

02:32:28.420 --> 02:32:34.420
Recently, Scandia Fun Center hosted a DER tournament for those playing accuracy and freestylers.

02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:41.420
The organizers decided to call it SHAPT. Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.

02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:47.420
Oh yeah, oh yeah, Sacbimani hosts another fabulous tournament. Oh, you get docked three points for that.

02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:51.420
He said Sacramento, not Sacbimani, so he gets docked three points.

02:32:52.420 --> 02:32:55.420
It was quite witty, if I do say so myself.

02:32:55.420 --> 02:33:01.420
I suppose I should go into detail about the three types of competition and exactly why they are important.

02:33:01.420 --> 02:33:03.420
I've never seen anyone talk in an English paper.

02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:06.420
Well, I suppose I ought to talk about this.

02:33:06.420 --> 02:33:09.420
I suppose I ought to do my assignment.

02:33:11.420 --> 02:33:12.420
Alright.

02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:17.420
That way I don't leave non-DDR players, you unfortunate souls, you in the dust.

02:33:18.420 --> 02:33:21.420
Accuracy attack is your standard play of DDR.

02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:24.420
The object of the game is to hit every arrow step with the right timing.

02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:31.420
I was not present during this competition, so you, dear reader, will be spared the agonizing details. Consider yourself lucky.

02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:45.420
Regular freestyle players take the steps for a song and work them into a dance routine.

02:33:45.420 --> 02:33:49.460
The routine always varies depending on the song and freestyler.

02:33:49.460 --> 02:33:53.860
Some amazing feats have taken place in this competition, and their excitement levels rivals

02:33:53.860 --> 02:34:00.300
that of any extreme sport.

02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:04.820
A-Team Freestyle, also known as Old School Freestyle, is a demonstration of freestyling

02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:12.020
techniques from several years back.

02:34:12.020 --> 02:34:15.700
These routines utilize the safety bars at the back of the arcade machine, and incorporate

02:34:15.700 --> 02:34:20.500
moves such as hand plants, hitting an arrow with hands instead of feet, and knee drops,

02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:21.980
landing on an arrow with knees.

02:34:21.980 --> 02:34:26.980
These often cause great pain to the performo- performo-

02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:30.940
Nowadays, A-Team routines are generally considered childish and not cool anymore.

02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:35.700
Personally, I think that A-Team routines have their biggest wow factor, but many don't share

02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:37.960
my opinion.

02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:41.260
Now that we're done with the background, let's get into the real meat of this.

02:34:41.260 --> 02:34:44.380
I am, of course, talking about how I fit into this whole picture.

02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:49.580
Through a little negotiating, green-whining, I managed to get into Shaft as an observer,

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:52.020
so I thought... or so I thought.

02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:57.260
Instead, I participated in the most embarrassing and the most fun activity of my life, competing

02:34:57.260 --> 02:34:59.460
in freestyles.

02:34:59.460 --> 02:35:03.820
Uh, here's the rundown.

02:35:03.820 --> 02:35:08.020
Midway through the freestyle competition, Rob and Janie, the MC and tournament organizer,

02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:11.240
noticed that not enough people had signed up for competition.

02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:18.240
I then decided to make an improv as a national freestyle category, which was one-third of the normal $15 entry fee.

02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:21.240
Having only $10 on me, I decided to go for it.

02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:22.240
Here was the catch.

02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:27.240
Since it was improv, the machine was set to roulette mode, which selects a song at random.

02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:31.240
If I had been able to pick my own song, things would have been momentally different.

02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:33.240
Monumentally different.

02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:36.240
Momentally, monumentally different.

02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:37.240
Damn you, big words.

02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:41.240
Namely, I probably would have had a routine set up, which defeats the purpose of improv.

02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:46.240
As it was, I embarrassed myself royally, doing rave moves to a bubblegum pop song.

02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:51.240
It was entertaining in its incognuity, but it was not a winner.

02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:53.240
Not a winner.

02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:55.240
Stand by to lose.

02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:57.240
Stand by to lose.

02:35:57.240 --> 02:35:58.240
Boom.

02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:03.240
Anyway, the wild part of my experience was not in my improv entry, but in what happened while waiting.

02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:05.240
It was chaos incarnate.

02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:08.440
Good friend Justin was going crazy with the deep fryer, dropping in everything he thought

02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:09.840
he could get away with.

02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:13.080
I still remember stuffing my face with deep fried Twinkies and candy corn.

02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:16.120
It was fun, albeit messy.

02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:19.800
Much of the time I was in the party room slash broadcast booth, talking with my friends and

02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:22.000
helping out with the Orange Lounge Radio broadcast.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:27.640
The broadcast was full of inside jokes, all of which were too rude and obscure to mention.

02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:31.560
I do remember Justin taking over the airwaves, telling me to stop hitting them, although

02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:46.120
Although I was doing no such thing, it was so moderately funny.

02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:49.800
A few times I came out of the party room to watch some freestylers work their magic on

02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:50.800
the stage.

02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:53.720
It is from one of the routines that my story gets its name.

02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:58.400
Mr. Wendell, a popular freestyler, was doing a comedy routine to Orion 7-8, one of the

02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:00.120
more annoying songs.

02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:03.880
One of his friends was holding up a hot roast beef sandwich, playing keep away with poor

02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:04.880
Wendell.

02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:08.760
At certain points in the song, the crowd, scooping the song lyrics, chanted, Roast beef!

02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:09.760
Roast beef!

02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:10.760
Hot!

02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:11.760
Hot!

02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:12.760
Hot!

02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:13.760
Hot!

02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:16.240
The whole routine had me literally on the floor laughing, especially at the end, where

02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:21.480
Wendell finally snatched the sandwich, took a bite, then backhanded his buddy, who was

02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:22.480
sneaking up behind him.

02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:23.480
That was Holland, wasn't it?

02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:24.480
Yes, it was.

02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:25.480
Applause.

02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:28.780
Applause. Rob, always the charmer, stood on stage and declared,

02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:31.280
I love stories with happy endings, don't you?

02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:41.480
More applause accompanied by laughter and wolf whistles, a few of which I must admit were mine.

02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:46.280
Aww, that was a beautiful paper. Thank you for sharing that with us. That was the end, right?

02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:50.580
Oops, I did it again. I closed the window.

02:37:50.580 --> 02:37:54.480
Oh well, I'm assuming that was the end of the paper. Oh, here it is.

02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:56.480
Yes, that was the end of the paper.

02:37:56.480 --> 02:38:00.480
Very well written. How do you guys think he did on that? What kind of grade?

02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:03.480
It was out of 36 points, I'll tell you that. What do you think he got?

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:04.480
I give it a 34.

02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:07.480
34. Out of 36 points. What would you give it, Logie?

02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:08.480
It was grammatically correct.

02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:09.480
Yes.

02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:12.480
What grade's he in?

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:15.480
I don't know. In high school.

02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:21.480
I think he's freshman or sophomore. That's a guess.

02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:26.480
I guess it was alright. It started going off topic towards the end though.

02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:37.480
I mean, you were explaining the different categories in DDR and then all of a sudden you just saw something else. I don't know.

02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:42.480
It sounds a lot like my senior project.

02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:43.480
No.

02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:47.900
See, what happens, I think what happens is you procrastinate and you wait till the last

02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:51.380
minute to write your paper and it ends up coming out like this.

02:38:51.380 --> 02:38:52.940
So what do you think, Rob?

02:38:52.940 --> 02:38:53.940
You guys have got to give me grades.

02:38:53.940 --> 02:38:54.940
What did you get?

02:38:54.940 --> 02:38:55.940
Grades?

02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:56.940
Hold on, Matt.

02:38:56.940 --> 02:38:57.940
What did you get?

02:38:57.940 --> 02:38:58.940
I have 36 points.

02:38:58.940 --> 02:38:59.940
34.0596 points.

02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:04.780
All right, very nice.

02:39:04.780 --> 02:39:07.740
For grammatical correctness, yes, I guess I'll give it to you.

02:39:07.740 --> 02:39:08.740
Oh, my bad.

02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:09.740
He's a senior.

02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:10.740
My bad.

02:39:10.740 --> 02:39:11.740
He's a senior in high school.

02:39:11.740 --> 02:39:13.740
That's bad. He's getting pissed.

02:39:13.740 --> 02:39:15.740
In that case, F.

02:39:15.740 --> 02:39:17.740
In that case, F, you should know better.

02:39:17.740 --> 02:39:21.740
There's not much difference between freshmen and seniors when it comes to curriculum when I was in high school.

02:39:21.740 --> 02:39:23.740
Your grade, Brad?

02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:25.740
I'd say 31.

02:39:25.740 --> 02:39:27.740
31? No, you give him a B.

02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:32.740
I give him 59. I give him 59 points for that. That was beautiful.

02:39:32.740 --> 02:39:34.740
There is no 59, you fuckhead.

02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:40.740
No, but this is what's funny. You know how many points he did get? 33. He got 33 points.

02:39:40.740 --> 02:39:45.740
three points for missing the Sac-Pomani thing, just like we said.

02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:50.740
You know what? I only learned two things in high school.

02:39:50.740 --> 02:39:55.740
What's that? How to avoid people, and then a mole of 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.

02:39:55.740 --> 02:40:00.740
I'm doing the way over my head thing right now where I put my hand up.

02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:05.740
I took AP chemistry.

02:40:05.740 --> 02:40:15.980
gave that paper a double S. That's winner. Oh, I'm vibrating. It's vibrating, but it's

02:40:15.980 --> 02:40:22.340
a restricted vibrate, so I don't want to answer restricted numbers. Okay, um, wow, we've still

02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:28.540
got about a good fifteen minutes to fill in the show. No, no ferret filling. What else

02:40:28.540 --> 02:40:33.980
can we talk about? You brat, you wanna rant about something? Hey, fucking guy! This is

02:40:33.980 --> 02:40:40.980
Gurbal. Your daughter, she come to my house, and she kicked my dog. I wanna tell a joke.

02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:47.660
I wanna tell a joke. Okay. I need joke music. I need the... You guys all bit it over. The

02:40:47.660 --> 02:40:52.660
Salakun. You guys all bit it over on the, uh, thing. Hey, I'm talking to you. Let me

02:40:52.660 --> 02:40:55.160
Let me tell you something from keyboard mania. Something happy.

02:40:55.160 --> 02:40:56.660
No keyboard for you.

02:40:58.660 --> 02:41:01.160
Amongst the full coffee in my boots!

02:41:03.660 --> 02:41:05.160
Okay, that kind of fits.

02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:11.160
Anyway, the guy was walking in the woods, and he was lost and lost and lost for days.

02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:18.660
So he chances upon this house, and he notices that there are telephone wires coming out of the house, so he knocks on the door.

02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:22.660
and this ancient old man answers the door.

02:41:22.660 --> 02:41:25.660
He goes, please sir, please, can I use your telephone?

02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:26.660
I'm lost in the woods.

02:41:26.660 --> 02:41:28.660
The guy goes, sure, you can use my telephone

02:41:28.660 --> 02:41:30.660
and you can stay at my house, too,

02:41:30.660 --> 02:41:31.660
until someone can come get you.

02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:34.660
But my one rule is that you cannot sleep with my daughter.

02:41:34.660 --> 02:41:35.660
OK.

02:41:35.660 --> 02:41:38.660
So he goes in the house, uses the telephone,

02:41:38.660 --> 02:41:42.660
has dinner with the family, and the guy's daughter was really hot.

02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:44.660
He couldn't help it, she just weren't mad

02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:46.660
and played the tune of the table.

02:41:46.660 --> 02:41:53.660
So, late at night, the guy speaks out of his room and goes and, you know, has his way with her, and then goes to bed.

02:41:53.660 --> 02:41:57.660
He wakes up in the morning with a gigantic rock on his chest.

02:41:57.660 --> 02:41:59.660
And there's a note attached to it.

02:41:59.660 --> 02:42:02.660
First greatest of all tortures, a gigantic rock stuck on your chest.

02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:04.660
Then he goes, well, shit.

02:42:04.660 --> 02:42:06.660
Throws it out the window.

02:42:06.660 --> 02:42:09.660
And then he feels a searing pain, and another note appears.

02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:13.660
Second greatest torture, right testicles tied to rock.

02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:18.660
So, the guy leaps out of the window after it. He finds another note.

02:42:18.660 --> 02:42:21.660
Third grade is torture. Left testicle tied to bedpost.

02:42:21.660 --> 02:42:23.660
The end.

02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:26.660
Ouch.

02:42:26.660 --> 02:42:28.660
That was a nice joke.

02:42:28.660 --> 02:42:33.660
Being a girl, I don't think you can completely appreciate the pain that I just felt right there.

02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:35.660
What do you think, Matt?

02:42:35.660 --> 02:42:37.660
I don't care. I heard that one lightning.

02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:38.660
Fifth grade?

02:42:38.660 --> 02:42:41.660
Well, fuck you then.

02:42:41.660 --> 02:42:46.360
is there any another joke

02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:48.740
this guy was in jail

02:42:48.740 --> 02:42:51.700
he had been in jail for so long and hadn't gotten laid

02:42:51.700 --> 02:42:53.700
he hadn't even been anyone's bitch

02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:55.540
so he gets out of jail

02:42:55.540 --> 02:42:58.360
and they give him his suit of clothing and twenty bucks

02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:00.580
first thing he wants to do

02:43:00.580 --> 02:43:01.660
is get laid

02:43:01.660 --> 02:43:05.060
so he goes to a brothel

02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:07.520
and he talks to the madam there and she's like well

02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:11.140
our women are at least a hundred and twenty and up

02:43:11.140 --> 02:43:13.700
He's like, do you have anyone that I can get for 20 bucks?

02:43:13.700 --> 02:43:16.180
He's like, well, we can give you to Bertha.

02:43:16.180 --> 02:43:17.020
So he gives him Bertha.

02:43:17.020 --> 02:43:18.540
And Bertha's this woman with like one leg,

02:43:18.540 --> 02:43:21.300
she has a peg leg, she's missing one arm,

02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:23.660
and she's got a glass eye.

02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:26.500
So the guy is trying his hardest

02:43:26.500 --> 02:43:28.740
and he just can't get anything with Bertha.

02:43:28.740 --> 02:43:30.580
She's like, look, why don't we do this?

02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:34.140
So she takes out her glass eye, says, try this one.

02:43:34.140 --> 02:43:37.260
So he goes out her eye, her eye socket,

02:43:37.260 --> 02:43:40.700
and it's been the best lay he ever had in his life.

02:43:40.700 --> 02:43:44.400
And he tells us, like, you know, next time I need to get some, I'm coming to you.

02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:46.400
I, you know, you were the best ever.

02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:48.400
He's like, okay, honey, I'll keep an eye out for you.

02:43:52.700 --> 02:43:53.700
Ha ha ha ha.

02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:55.400
Oh, dear good lord.

02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:58.400
Okay, on that note, I think we're gonna take a quick break,

02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:00.400
and then we're gonna come back and wrap up the show.

02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:01.700
Sound good to you guys?

02:44:02.700 --> 02:44:03.200
Yes?

02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:04.400
We can wrap it up in ribbons and bows.

02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:05.600
Oh, you want booty music? I'm sorry.

02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:07.600
Well, I have this request, though, so I gotta play this first.

02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:09.500
All right, I'm gonna play this, then we'll do something booty.

02:44:09.500 --> 02:44:10.200
Okay, here we go.

02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:12.200
We'll be right back.

02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:42.200
Oh

02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:58.680
It's Mr. Spanky, as promised, I'm here on the air to give you some tips.

02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:03.000
Tonight I'm gonna read you a letter, because I don't know much about, well I do know a

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:06.680
thing or two about it, I have to admit you guys, not that there's anything wrong with

02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:10.680
But today, we're going to be talking about fellatio tips.

02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:12.680
So I'm going to read a letter for you guys.

02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:15.680
You might need a translation of that, Mr. Spanky.

02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:18.680
I'm sorry? Oh, fellatio. That's a blowjob.

02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:19.680
Okay.

02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:21.680
Fellatio means a blowjob.

02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:23.680
All right.

02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:27.680
This letter comes to us from a girl named Emmy.

02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:28.680
She says,

02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:32.680
My husband and I have been married ten years, and during this time,

02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:35.680
my enjoyment for giving head has increased tremendously.

02:46:35.680 --> 02:46:39.680
I have found the more I turn him on, the more it turns me off.

02:46:39.680 --> 02:46:42.680
I'm sorry, the more it turns me on, I can't read today.

02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:49.680
I start off by teasing him a little, flicking the head with my tongue, and licking the underside slowly from bottom to top.

02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:55.680
I have also learned he likes me to deductively look at him while I'm doing this. It adds to the teasing.

02:46:55.680 --> 02:47:03.680
One problem I had from taking his cock all the way, because I enjoy giving pleasure to him, so much I wanted to be able to deep throat.

02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:12.680
I could do it once in a while, but most of the time I would gag, so I thought that if I could just numb my throat somehow, I would stop gagging.

02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:18.680
That's when I figured it out. I bought some chloroceptic throat spray and put it in my nightstand.

02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:23.680
The next time I gave him head, I had no problem swallowing his entire cock.

02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:27.680
I can't tell you how turned on he was, and how turned on I was.

02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:33.680
You can also use children's teething cream, but it doesn't have a pleasant taste, and it's harder to apply.

02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:36.680
That's my tip. It works great for us.

02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:43.680
There is nothing that you can do which more clearly shows your love for him than adoring his talk.

02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:47.680
Well, thank you! That was Mr. Spanky Sex Tip of the Week.

02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:52.680
You guys should look for me. I'm in DDR PC. I'm in a character expansion pack.

02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:56.680

Throw them all up, swing that back, turn your back, and see where it's at

02:49:55.020 --> 02:49:59.020

Man, shit, man, what time is it, dawg?

02:50:16.020 --> 02:50:18.020
I don't know what time it is, Reylo

02:50:18.020 --> 02:50:20.020
Peanut butter jelly top!

02:50:36.020 --> 02:50:40.020
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

02:50:40.020 --> 02:50:42.020
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:42.020 --> 02:50:45.020
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio

02:50:45.020 --> 02:50:48.420
And we're here to wrap up tonight's show, because we're just about at the end.

02:50:48.420 --> 02:50:50.220
We're going to wrap it up in cellophane.

02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:52.220
We're going to wrap it up in a nice little bow.

02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:53.720
And sell it on eBay.

02:50:53.720 --> 02:50:56.220
And give it to somebody for Christmas.

02:50:59.220 --> 02:51:02.020
So, anything else you guys want to talk about on the show tonight that we haven't gotten

02:51:02.020 --> 02:51:04.220

02:51:04.220 --> 02:51:05.220
Bree South.

02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:06.420
I've mentioned it before.

02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:07.620
Funny show.

02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:08.820
Gotta love it.

02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:11.820

02:51:42.760 --> 02:51:45.460
So what are you guys going to play, because everything there is Para-para?

02:51:45.460 --> 02:51:47.260
Para-para.

02:51:47.260 --> 02:51:50.580
Para-para. You know what this town needs? We need a Para-para team.

02:51:50.580 --> 02:51:52.340
No.

02:51:52.340 --> 02:51:53.740
Come on!

02:51:53.740 --> 02:51:56.180
I am no Para-less. I know maybe

02:51:56.180 --> 02:51:59.780
six of them, and I only do four regularly. You know what pisses me off?

02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:03.020
And I'm pretty sure... No, this isn't just specific to Roseville Golf Land.

02:52:03.020 --> 02:52:04.980
I know most golf lands have this problem.

02:52:04.980 --> 02:52:07.520
The kids that tease people playing Para-para.

02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:11.860
I mean, fucking... I had one of them kicked out. God, I fucking hate those kids. I hate kids that

02:52:11.860 --> 02:52:15.340
think they're better than everybody else that shit pisses me off it's like you

02:52:15.340 --> 02:52:20.180

And no, Orange Beanie, I'm not picking you up because you're in the other direction. Sorry.

02:52:45.860 --> 02:52:46.860
Aw, I'm sorry.

02:52:47.860 --> 02:52:49.860
Oh, oh, oh, and don't forget, Initial D.

02:52:49.860 --> 02:52:50.860
Oh, Initial D is cool.

02:52:50.860 --> 02:52:51.860
Initial D.

02:52:51.860 --> 02:52:56.860
But yeah, kids piss me off, and there's a lot of them at Golf Land, and they're all rich and snobby, and they think they're better than everyone else.

02:52:56.860 --> 02:52:57.860
They suck.

02:52:57.860 --> 02:52:58.860
They piss me off, they suck.

02:52:58.860 --> 02:52:59.860
And they suck.

02:52:59.860 --> 02:53:00.860
They suck. No, they don't suck.

02:53:01.860 --> 02:53:02.860
No, because...

02:53:02.860 --> 02:53:03.860
They blow.

02:53:03.860 --> 02:53:11.360
They don't suck, they don't blow. The fact that they exist is worse enough.

02:53:11.360 --> 02:53:18.260
Oh God, I think I actually might have just created a pair of Parasax stars with my statement.

02:53:18.260 --> 02:53:19.940
My bad, my bad, sorry guys, my bad.

02:53:19.940 --> 02:53:22.660
Oh, for the four that I know. Or for six that I know.

02:53:22.660 --> 02:53:25.920
Yeah, I'll join for the three that I know. I'll join just so that we have a big group

02:53:25.920 --> 02:53:26.920
of people.

02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:27.920
You have to teach me like a virgin correctly.

02:53:27.920 --> 02:53:30.220
We need to do trick- okay, I'll teach you how to do like a virgin, that's fine.

02:53:30.220 --> 02:53:31.220
And I'll teach you...

02:53:31.220 --> 02:53:32.220
You can teach me the one you know that I know.

02:53:32.220 --> 02:53:33.220
Ashimatsu.

02:53:33.220 --> 02:53:37.220
But you know what I need to brush up on? I need to brush up on Light of Fire.

02:53:37.220 --> 02:53:39.220
Okay. I need to remember how to do Eurobeat.

02:53:39.220 --> 02:53:42.220
Yeah, teach me Eurobeat. Learn Eurobeat and then teach me.

02:53:42.220 --> 02:53:47.220
So I'll get you my Max 300 Para Para going here.

02:53:47.220 --> 02:53:49.220
No, I'll tell you what will be great about a Para team.

02:53:49.220 --> 02:53:51.220
The thing that I want to learn though is Osolemio.

02:53:51.220 --> 02:53:57.220
For that one day that I do feel like playing Para Para, what we need to do, we need to trick the assholes.

02:53:57.220 --> 02:54:01.220
We'll just have everybody on the Para Para team sitting in the little booths and like one person up on the machine.

02:54:01.220 --> 02:54:04.340
on the machine, and then when somebody starts teasing them, just get everybody to get up

02:54:04.340 --> 02:54:07.340
and surround them and just start glaring, and then like, para para in their face or

02:54:07.340 --> 02:54:08.340
something.

02:54:08.340 --> 02:54:09.340
Everyone get up there and mirror.

02:54:09.340 --> 02:54:10.340
That's right.

02:54:10.340 --> 02:54:11.340
Everyone get up there and mirror.

02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:12.340
Wow, that's so 80s.

02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:13.340
Kick kids in the butt.

02:54:13.340 --> 02:54:18.580
How about I just inject them with the AIDS virus?

02:54:18.580 --> 02:54:22.300
Try Drano, it kills them more painfully.

02:54:22.300 --> 02:54:25.060
Imagine being injected into something that starts eating at your insides.

02:54:25.060 --> 02:54:26.660
Or you just inject somebody with air.

02:54:26.660 --> 02:54:30.320
Hey, I eat McDonald's too, okay?

02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:32.320
I don't. My point stays.

02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:35.320
Okay, so I think that we should just go.

02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:39.320
You think we're going to end this show now? You want to end this show now?

02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:41.320
Well, no. We have three minutes.

02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:44.320
We have enough time to do final thoughts. You guys want to give your final thoughts?

02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:46.320
Jamie, what is your final thought of today?

02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:49.320
That's it?

02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:53.320
Where's Brad? Get Brad back in here. He needs to do a final thought.

02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:58.600
My final thought is, I need more man porn.

02:54:58.600 --> 02:55:00.800
I need man sex.

02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:01.800
Thank you.

02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:02.800
You need man sex.

02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:03.800
Brad, do you have a final thought for me?

02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:07.640
I need man sex.

02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:08.640
Well now...

02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:10.120
And we have that on tape now.

02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:11.120
Yes we do.

02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:13.760
Hey, I'm going to play that last week on Orange Launch Rio.

02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:15.240
I need man sex.

02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:18.320
Tune in every Sunday night.

02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:20.520
Hello to those people listening to us in Japan.

02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:25.000
I heard at our station to people listening in Japan, they were Orange Lounge fans.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:26.960
Orange Lounge the group, not the radio.

02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:27.960
So they're tricked.

02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:29.880
Haha, now we got you.

02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:30.880
Yeah.

02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:31.880
We got you good.

02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:40.000
Well, I don't know, maybe we should offer them something a little bit different than

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:41.720
just saying, haha, we tricked you.

02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:42.720
Okay, what?

02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:43.720
Say, arigato gozaimasu.

02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:44.720
What's that mean?

02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:45.720
Thank you very much.

02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:46.720
Oh, okay.

02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:47.720
You should know what that means.

02:55:47.720 --> 02:55:48.720
No, I don't.

02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:49.720
I'm too white.

02:55:49.720 --> 02:56:01.720
What are the Orange Lounge tracks for the rotation?

02:56:01.720 --> 02:56:06.720
What do the kids have to look forward to next week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:11.660
we're going to sacrifice low-key to the gods live on air

02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:15.540
hey low-key is a guy who have written their guide okay

02:56:15.540 --> 02:56:18.700
but i think i played by jim carrey

02:56:18.700 --> 02:56:20.620
and i've had to meet

02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:22.160
hey i like to carry a day

02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:23.800
that'd be an honor

02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:27.200
students like watch the mask at my place on this

02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:29.220
i have not been

02:56:29.220 --> 02:56:32.340
elise it is just a cooler

02:56:32.340 --> 02:56:33.940
cd coasters

02:56:33.940 --> 02:56:35.060
but i'm not

02:56:35.060 --> 02:56:39.860
Oh, oh, oh, my half.com thing is going to arrive sometime next week.

02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:40.860
What's that?

02:56:40.860 --> 02:56:45.100
I ordered Sense and Sensibility on widescreen laserdiscs, so I can watch more Alan Rickman.

02:56:45.100 --> 02:56:46.780
You're a hopeless case.

02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:51.280
If you go to Jamie's friends page now, it is filled up with the Slytherin community,

02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:53.980
the Draco community, the Alan Rickman community.

02:56:53.980 --> 02:56:59.040
Alright, I am on, I am on, I'm in the Alan Rickman community, the Slytherin community,

02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:04.020
the Professor Snape community, and I'm in the Animal Crossing community.

02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:35.420
was uh...

02:57:35.420 --> 02:57:38.380
i hate boys a place

02:57:38.380 --> 02:57:42.100
well then we'll get you some pretty

02:57:42.100 --> 02:57:44.020
i'm confused tuna

02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:45.240
red bull there

02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:49.180
now i need to turn tables i have the microphone turn tables and a mac

02:57:49.180 --> 02:57:52.300
following the case you know if it's not going

02:57:52.300 --> 02:57:55.500
jimmy actually i let me see how close the other week or the other day and i

02:57:55.500 --> 02:57:57.500
was laughing at our shoes eating tacos

02:57:57.500 --> 02:58:01.100
actually one of the action i got a second five controller now for the

02:58:01.100 --> 02:58:03.100
And it's a lot better than the other one.

02:58:03.100 --> 02:58:05.100
And I'm gonna...

02:58:05.100 --> 02:58:07.100
No, I have the old ASCII pad.

02:58:07.100 --> 02:58:09.100
It's the BeatCon or whatever that is.

02:58:09.100 --> 02:58:11.100
It's better than the other one.

02:58:11.100 --> 02:58:13.100
But I'm modding them.

02:58:13.100 --> 02:58:17.100
But they're all like that.

02:58:17.100 --> 02:58:19.100
They're all like that.

02:58:19.100 --> 02:58:22.100
There's a one with piano keys which is somewhat decent.

02:58:22.100 --> 02:58:26.100
I have the official ASCII one which sucks ass.

02:58:26.100 --> 02:58:35.100
But I've been hearing that NCSX was dropping their 2DS controllers to 50 bucks. So I'm checking that out.

02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:42.100
Well I'm doing a mod on mine that actually I'm making a brand new mod for 5 key.

02:58:42.100 --> 02:58:46.100
I'm going to actually put ball bearings underneath the turntable to make it spin better.

02:58:46.100 --> 02:58:51.100
Because it has room for it and they have these two really crappy plastic things that it spins on.

02:58:51.100 --> 02:59:02.100
There's room for barbarians inside there, so we'll put that on there, and maybe a little rubber mat on top of it so that you have grip on the turntable, because their keys and everything is fine, but yeah, just the turntable sucks.

02:59:02.100 --> 02:59:04.100
Make me a 2DX controller.

02:59:04.100 --> 02:59:06.100
Should you?

02:59:06.100 --> 02:59:07.100
No.

02:59:07.100 --> 02:59:08.100
Okay.

02:59:08.100 --> 02:59:09.100
I'll pay you.

02:59:09.100 --> 02:59:10.100
Maybe.

02:59:10.100 --> 02:59:12.100
One more, one more thought.

02:59:12.100 --> 02:59:16.100
Which dysfunctional Sesame Street character are you?

02:59:16.100 --> 02:59:19.100
I got Burton Ernie's gay relationship.

02:59:19.100 --> 02:59:22.100
Surprisingly enough, I got Grover on E.

02:59:22.100 --> 02:59:25.660
I'm Grouch's heroin addiction.

02:59:25.660 --> 02:59:29.780
And what about you, Brad? I didn't participate in this

02:59:29.780 --> 02:59:33.940
dorky thing. What are you talking about? Then you're transsexual Elmo.

02:59:33.940 --> 02:59:37.140
I have a thought, actually. I thought it was kind of weird how...

02:59:37.140 --> 02:59:40.940
Hey, Jamie. Yes, I can think. Anyway,

02:59:40.940 --> 02:59:45.180
I thought it was kind of weird how Rob disappeared from our studio when Mr.

02:59:45.180 --> 02:59:46.140
Spanky came in.

02:59:46.140 --> 02:59:52.140
And why did Mr. Spanky sound like he was related to Triumph the Insult Comic Dog?

02:59:52.140 --> 02:59:58.140
That sexual tip was good for me to poop on.

02:59:58.140 --> 02:59:59.140
I hate you.

02:59:59.140 --> 03:00:02.140
He was scaring me that he kept grabbing my ass.

03:00:02.140 --> 03:00:04.140
Mr. Spanky, that was.

03:00:04.140 --> 03:00:08.140
Oh, I thought he was talking about me. I guess he doesn't mind when I do it.

03:00:08.140 --> 03:00:12.140
Alright, we're running over. We gotta go. Take care, you guys. Have a great night.

03:00:12.140 --> 03:00:13.140
Yeah, we're running over the show.

03:00:13.140 --> 03:00:20.140
over the show. Thanks for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio. We love you. My bad. Bye.

03:00:20.500 --> 03:00:27.500

03:00:41.220 --> 03:00:44.380
Here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:00:44.380 --> 03:00:49.960
And now a buffoons meeting with the dean of admissions at a prestigious college.

03:00:49.960 --> 03:00:54.840
Well Michael, I'd like to extend my warmest congratulations on your upcoming graduation

03:00:54.840 --> 03:00:58.480
and I understand you're interested in matriculating here in the fall.

03:00:58.480 --> 03:01:00.640
I got a snake, man!

03:01:00.640 --> 03:01:05.880
Yes, pets are welcome here on campus, be it the traditional dog or cat or even the occasional

03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:06.880
reptile.

03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:14.880
One time I feted some beer, Mank! It was slivering this way and that! It was all fucked up!

03:01:14.880 --> 03:01:21.880
I'm sure it was. Well, we discourage inappropriate drinking among both students and pets here on campus.

03:01:21.880 --> 03:01:23.880
Fuckin' shit!

03:01:23.880 --> 03:01:30.880
Yes, that's a not uncommon reaction to this policy. So tell me a little bit more about your background.

03:01:30.880 --> 03:01:33.880
My father's a fuckin' asshole, Mank!

03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:38.880
Hmm, I see. Your feelings of rebellion are not unusual at your age, son.

03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:42.880
My mother's a piece of shit, too!

03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:45.880
Well, I hope you can find an outlet for your hostility over the summer,

03:01:45.880 --> 03:01:48.880
so you can come to school in the fall relaxed and ready to learn.

03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:56.880
My teacher in high school was a stupid bitch, man! She had her head way up her ass!

03:01:56.880 --> 03:02:02.880
Well, the quality of the faculty at a university such as ours far exceeds that of a local public high school.

03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:06.380
Your secretary's a real fat bitch, man!

03:02:06.380 --> 03:02:10.380
Guess she's tried many diets over the years with minimal success.

03:02:11.380 --> 03:02:17.380
I had diarrhea last month! I had to shit all fucking day!

03:02:17.380 --> 03:02:22.380
Uh-huh. Well, we all get the occasional stomach bug. Never a pleasurable experience.

03:02:22.380 --> 03:02:26.380
So, have you given any thought to your choice of major?

03:02:26.380 --> 03:02:30.380
I've got a big fucking boner right now!

03:02:30.380 --> 03:02:36.380
Hmm, I see. Well, sexual arousal is not uncommon during periods of nervous tension. I do not take offense.

03:02:37.380 --> 03:02:40.380
One time I ate my neighbor's shit!

03:02:41.380 --> 03:02:46.380
That's understandable. Well, I enjoyed meeting you, and we'll be sending you our decision by the end of the month.

03:02:48.380 --> 03:02:50.380
I bet you got really hairy balls!

03:02:51.380 --> 03:02:54.380
Yes, it's a veritable force down there. Bye-bye!

03:02:54.380 --> 03:03:00.220
Bye-bye.
