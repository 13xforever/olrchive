00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
message for you sir!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In this episode...

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hey, is any balls down there?

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
About the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What's your favorite scary movie?

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The show's absolutely frightening.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's yours?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But no kung-fu.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No!

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What I expect for Spanish exposition is gentle.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hey, hey, hey!

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Dark Sakura.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Shut up!

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Where's my gun?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is my boom stick.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sky.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Loki.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't believe it.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What kind of work human being would find that funny?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Orange Lounge Radio

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We are live, and this is episode number 25 for December the 22nd of 2002.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's most old school station.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's judging by the preshow, correct?

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
of all things...

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000

You might know me as Sky.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Joining me as always are the other two pieces of the pie.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000

The funny pie.

Apple?

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know, what pie would you be?

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Mincemeat!

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000

We're very low on the listeners and people in the chat room and all that stuff.

90
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,140
how we're going to start this big show off. We want to do the FUs of the Week. We want

91
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,700
to do the Sim updates. We can talk about anything that's in this Maxim magazine because... Why

92
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,660
don't we talk about Loki's Christmas present from Jamie? Let's talk about that. I gave

93
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,660
him the gift of cleavage. I got a Maxim magazine and I got a bunch of chocolate. A whole bunch

94
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,180
chocolate like tons and tons and tons and tons of chocolate but no nuts no

95
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:03,860
nuts because I hate nuts but um I'm a good present giver because I remember

96
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,460
but this this book is awesome I mean it's got well other than the fact that

97
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,820
it's got this really cool page of this topless cheerleader that's just oh my

98
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:18,580
god that's what I want next year okay right there

99
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,580
Let's see, it tells they have a page here how to amputate your own limb.

100
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,580
How?

101
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,580
How to date a cheerleader, how to make a tridocan or whatever that is, I don't know.

102
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,580
How to play craps.

103
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
It's just awesome.

104
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,580
How to deck your lawn.

105
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
Crazy stuff like that.

106
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,580
Speaking of Maxim Magazine, don't you have an announcement to make about your little competition?

107
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:51,580
Oh yeah, due to the fact that our wonderful message board went down again, I am postponing the due date by two weeks.

108
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,580
For what?

109
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,580
For Make Edit Get Porn.

110
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
The winner is you.

111
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,580
Why don't you explain one more thing, even though no one new is listening tonight, I'm sure because our listener counts so low.

112
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,580
Tell us all about Make Edit Get Porn.

113
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,580
Make Edit Get Porn is basically you make an edit for any song that's on DDR Max USA

114
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:18,580
and you send it to me some way, either it be a Dex Drive save, a DWI file, a step chart, whatever

115
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:24,580
you just send it to me and you're entered, the winner gets a big box of porn.

116
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,580
That's pretty much it.

117
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,580
So basically, you make an edit and you get some porn.

118
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,580
Maybe.

119
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,580
But you have to win to get the porn.

120
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:44,580
to get the porn. As things look great now, there's like two people entered. Another thing

121
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:50,900
that prompted me to push back the deadline by two weeks. So that's pretty much the contest

122
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:59,100
right there as it stands. VidPower has a suggestion. He says it shouldn't be Murp make edit receive

123
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,940
Because then he can say merp.

124
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,740
Why do we have to drop everything down to acronyms?

125
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,780
Eff you to acronyms, okay?

126
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:19,420
Anyways, so, yeah, I mean, futa.

127
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,060
Ooh, page 100.

128
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,460
The acronym show, you mean TAS?

129
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,460
Dude, they have nude elves in here.

130
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,460
Dude? What?

131
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,460
Wait, what is this?

132
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,460
Why are there... I don't...

133
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,460
Okay.

134
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,460
That's pretty cool.

135
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,460
Maxim Magazine is such a dirty little rag.

136
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,460
I love it.

137
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,460
Surprise.

138
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,460
Ah.

139
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,460
Yeah.

140
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,460
Let's go stretch.

141
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
Yeah, they have stuff about video games.

142
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,460
What's the video game that they reviewed this week?

143
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,460
Nightfire.

144
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,500
They gave it a four out of five stars.

145
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,200
James Bond, it's uh...

146
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,860
Yeah, it's like GoldenEye.

147
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,900
Okay, you want to fuss? Jamie wants to fuss. I want to fuss.

148
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,060
Jamie wants to fuss. I think I'm using... Fuss about something. Are we doing FUs already? This isn't the FUs or is this...

149
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,780
This isn't an FU, but I need fussy music. Do you need fussy music? Whoa, look, balls!

150
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,780
This guy is holding bread together to where it looks like balls and that big...cock.

151
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,780
What fussy music do you want? You want your normal F.U. music?

152
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,780
What's your fussy music?

153
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,780
You want gravity for your fussy music?

154
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,780
Let's see if I can find fussy music.

155
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,780
Fussy, fussy, fussy.

156
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,780
Okay. What the hell?

157
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,780
She's a hoe. Okay, here we go. I have your fussy music.

158
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,780
She likes being beaten when she has sex.

159
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,780
Okay. Today we went to Roosevelt Golf Lamp.

160
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,780
And boy did it suck.

161
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,780
We went over there to play some Para Para and stuff.

162
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,780
And I just got so sick of all the machines being down that I went and fussed the manager.

163
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
His name?

164
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,780
With a list and all.

165
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,780
No, I made the list after I fussed with him.

166
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,660
well you can do it again. His name was Chris. He's a tall guy.

167
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,860
He's a tall guy. And he was wearing a vest over one of those button up goth land shirts.

168
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:31,300
I went and I fussed at him.

169
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,260
I said

170
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,980
Excuse me, I'm trying to fuss.

171
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,540
I asked why the machines were in forward hair.

172
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,780
And I named off machines one by one, and what was wrong with him?

173
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,620
And his eyes just got a little bit wider, and a little bit wider.

174
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,720
And he decides to use, um, this condescending corporate talk.

175
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,960
Okay, I worked for a corporation for two years, and I'm working for another one now.

176
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,080
Although that's not quite as professional as today.

177
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,360
Anyway, um, and he's like, well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

178
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,660
And blah blah blah, and the tech comes in on Monday. I'm like,

179
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:15,660
I remember hearing that they have three techs at Willysville.

180
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,040
They must have three techs, but they all come in the same day and just drink beer and watch football.

181
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,740
I was like, well then hire another.

182
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,080
And he's like, well corporate deals blah blah blah.

183
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,480
If all of your funding comes from your corporate office...

184
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
How corporate to suck your corporate cock?

185
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
I don't have a...anyway...

186
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Eat your corporate clit then, I don't care!

187
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:53,480
Anyway, I was like, well then explain why I haven't noticed this many machines down at SVGL.

188
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Or I haven't seen this many machines down at MGL.

189
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
Or CVGL!

190
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,480
I started naming off places, and I'm like...

191
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,240
He's like, you know, if all your funding comes from

192
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,360
Gotham corporate, why are these other goth lands

193
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,200
in such good repair and this one has so many broken machines?

194
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,440
And he's like, um, well, I don't know. I'm like, you know what? I'm like, if we don't see some

195
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,440
improvement here, there might be an organized boycott of your facility.

196
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,880
Hell no! It won't go!

197
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,240
Oh yeah, but I probably wouldn't go anyways. And I walked off, took out my notebook,

198
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,840
and proceeded to write down all of the machines that were broken.

199
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,840
So I have a list, but I'll leave my list after Rob says he's okay.

200
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,840
I have a silly comment, but if Black Lab used to work for the golf line, correct? The Golf Line Empire.

201
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,840
I was just wondering what your manager would have done had Jamie came in and said lick my corporate clit.

202
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Okay, first of all, my-

203
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
First of all-

204
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
I wouldn't have said that.

205
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Well, first of all, my manager was more of a woman, so.

206
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Yeah, that would have just made the situation all the more awkward.

207
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,840
I didn't press anything, it was nice.

208
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,840
Yeah, but a constructed cart you made for my manager would have actually produced some kind of result.

209
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,840
I mean, but, then again, Captain Valley is like, a fifth the size of Roseville.

210
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:26,840
If you, I mean, you guys, there's only two golf courses, and like, no water slides or golf carts like there are in Roseville, but anyway.

211
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Okay, what are you looking at now in this back so far?

212
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Oh my god, it's Rapture!

213
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,840
I know about these.

214
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Okay, time to... I think she's kind of fussing about...

215
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,840
Dude, you just turned red.

216
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Okay, cuz.

217
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,840
Yeah, Rob's complaining about things already going on a train wreck.

218
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
This is what's broken right now at Roseville Golf Land.

219
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,840
By the way, they have really crappy surface today.

220
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,840
Anyway, um, hip hop...

221
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
What's new? Today?

222
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,840
This is... these are just the obviously broken things.

223
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Okay, I didn't go by and personally test every game.

224
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,840
First of all, the hip hop mania, it eats tokens.

225
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
I lost two dollars in tokens on that thing today.

226
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Did you get that?

227
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
They wouldn't give it to me.

228
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
You're mean.

229
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Okay, guitar breaks was down.

230
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Drum mania was put out of order because the drumsticks weren't tied to the machine, but I just took the sticker off and just played it anyway.

231
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,840
DDR 4th mix was down, however they were turning it on when we were leaving. I think someone just reached right there close to me.

232
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Um, uh, DDR match to, um, you said the left player up arrow was broken and the right player right arrow was broken?

233
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Other way around.

234
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Oh, uh, first player left, first player up arrow, and second player...

235
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
That's, that's what I'm saying.

236
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,840
Um, and Pada Pada has one of the sensors on him a little bit loose.

237
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,840
For the medieval madness, pinball is down. Roadshow pinball is down.

238
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Revenge of Mars pinball is down. Time Crisis Player 1 is down.

239
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,840
The grid was down. They had it, but I'll take it apart.

240
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,840
They had, like, separated, like, one group, one in each of the corners.

241
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Radical Bikers is down.

242
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,840
Radical Bikers? That's the only game that's not worth getting into your DL.

243
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
I'm just naming all of them.

244
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
It is, like, it never works.

245
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,840
That game War, the third player was down.

246
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:30,520
So how many games is this that I've named, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

247
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:40,920
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,

248
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:49,920
So how many games is this that I've named? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 games!

249
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,920
I'd like to announce also that their ticket counting machine is inaccurate.

250
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,920
It in fact counts less tickets than you put in there, no matter what you do, because the retards don't empty it.

251
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,920
You sound like the comic book guy. I would like to point out that that ticket machine is inaccurate.

252
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,020
worst episode ever

253
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,040
don't like this

254
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,120
possibly yeah no no we roll any other

255
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,280
any other worse episode ever was me doing it live from

256
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,880
freaking the tournament now

257
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,400
and stuff and

258
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,400
I'm closing down

259
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh, a plan. P-L-A-N. That's not an acronym. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Jamie has a plan.

260
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:06,000
No, we need the fanfare from Marky and Bullseye.

261
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The plan is this, we've tried petitioning them before, you know, sending letters.

262
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
We only sent in a few letters, so this is what I'm going to say.

263
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay, for everybody who has a complaint regarding Roosevelt-Goughlin, you know, there's supposed to be power in numbers. I'm going to send a letter to Goughlin corporate.

264
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
To complain about the shoddy performance of Roosevelt-Goughlin. I'm going to send it to Steve Boss.

265
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yes, Steve Rogers was going to say, who is the general manager of Rizzo Gotham.

266
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Also, you know, the fact that he was so unresponsive here and the whole time we're trying to get our tournament running,

267
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm sending a letter to the Gotham Incorporate, questioning about him.

268
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I thought something would be shaken up, because I heard that Shiggle Boss went out there and checked the place out earlier, like last week sometime.

269
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:13,000
There needs to be more than just that. Even wanting to enlist the aid of anyone with a digital camera, go take a picture of each.

270
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Nearly 7 out of 10 women say that they're unhappy because they're the lowest.

271
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Loki shot for a minute.

272
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:28,000
On Jamie's point, last time we did that, took a digital camera and took pictures and we put them up on the internet, they were pissed.

273
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
They were so pissed. Let's do it again, let's do it again.

274
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Let's do it!

275
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And you know, we had a thread on that open on DDR3 for six weeks?

276
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
With links to those pictures?

277
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Can I be in the picture with a sad face?

278
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yes!

279
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And you know what?

280
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We should photoshop Captain Jack into a picture and have him crying.

281
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You know what?

282
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Am I not incorrect that it worked last time?

283
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yes it did.

284
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
We had our keyboards replaced on keyboard media.

285
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yes it did.

286
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So you know what? Let's do it!

287
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Let's do it! Let's go ahead and, uh, you know, there's something, I don't know if anyone has ever worked in customer service or any type of service where they've given training classes like that, but, um, for every eight displeased customers, only one person ever does nothing about it.

288
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That's sad.

289
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And the thing about this, each of the people that are just in the service are going to go and tell another eight people at least and spread the word.

290
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I would just like to point out that I used Jamie's example in a training class the other day at work.

291
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You did? That's cool.

292
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But, see, that's the point.

293
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You need to think that for every single complaint letter you get, there are seven other people who are pissed off at your company.

294
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You know?

295
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You see what we're going to do? We're going to make sure there's quite a few more than just eight.

296
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And to point out, you know, Orange Lounge Radio, we're an international show, we got listeners in Japan, listeners in Canada, all over, you know, our world headquarters, Sacramento, California, so this is kind of a local topic.

297
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But, you know, even the people, we got some folks in Vegas in the chat room right now, VidPower says, I feel sorry for you guys, an arcade should not be messed up that bad.

298
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes, we bitch about RVGL because we want your pity. That's the point of this whole thing.

299
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
On top of that, though, we're making a point for anybody else, you know, around the world country.

300
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If you see your arcade or any place too frequent that's in poor condition, do something about it.

301
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Just say, oh god, this sucks, and not doing anything about it.

302
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
People don't know what they're doing wrong until you tell them.

303
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Just keep in mind that the vast majority of people in this world are fundamentally stupid.

304
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm not saying everybody is stupid.

305
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm not saying everybody is stupid because obviously our listeners have a brain.

306
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But, you know, there are a lot of really dumb people in the world, and they just don't get it, and they keep doing something, thinking that they're doing something the right way, and in the meantime, they don't know just how bad they're fucking up.

307
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Especially if your arcade smells like pee.

308
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That would be laser force.

309
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I swear, I smelled fish while I was playing DDR at Roseville today.

310
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Me too, I smelled fish. I was like, dang, somebody needs to douche.

311
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It was nasty. It distracted me when I was trying to play.

312
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It was sick. Golf Land is filled with the ragged smell of pussy and I don't like it.

313
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
At least no little kid came and took a dump by you while you were playing.

314
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You didn't have to see someone trying to change your baby's diaper on the keyboard.

315
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I have a little horror story about colorful heaven.

316
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Uh-oh!

317
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,400
Yeah, when I was working at Castle Gas in CVGL over the summer, some little kid, I think

318
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:53,640
it was around Labor Day weekend, they were trying to fix the air conditioning on the

319
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,840
roof and all of a sudden I walk over to the edge of the roof to check around to see if

320
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,560
there were little kids running around, and I see this little brown pile sitting on the

321
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:10,360
sidewalk out in front of the arcade, I'm like, that can't be from a dog or something, can

322
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,800
it? And then I get a complaint from my boss, he's like, Ryan, the toilet's clogged, could

323
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,800
you go take care of that? So I go walking over to the bathroom, I look at the toilet,

324
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,840
and there's a little kid's pair of boxers filled with crap sitting in the toilet. There's

325
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,080
like a half a roll of toilet paper crammed in there with, like somebody trying to flush

326
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,080
the boxers down the toilet how stupid can you get no i had to and then i walked outside

327
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,120
and followed there was like little trails of drops of crap laying on the sidewalk up

328
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,680
to this big pile over by the over by one of the starts of the golf courses i had to clean

329
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:53,520
that up it was nasty i don't think i need any more chocolate tonight thank you well

330
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,520
Maybe they won't keep you aside for this. That's a good thing.

331
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,520
Okay, Santa's getting some.

332
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,520
We're looking in the...

333
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,520
That damn Maxim again!

334
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,520
I'm going to read the quote.

335
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,520
And here's a candy cane for you.

336
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,520
It's a picture of Santa and some woman on his lap with her underwear.

337
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,520
It's just like a shot of somebody... Santa sitting from these down.

338
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Let's hear it for Maximus.

339
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Anyway, back to what my point was, if anybody,

340
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,520
it doesn't even matter what it is, people don't know what they're doing wrong until you point it out to them.

341
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Make sure that if you're going to complain about something,

342
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,520
you do it in a constructive manner. You point out item by item what is wrong

343
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,520
with what they're doing, how you think it can be fixed, and then you send it to the people

344
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,520
who can do something about it. Don't give it to some peon because they're going to lose it.

345
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,520
Which means go over everyone's heads until you get to the top.

346
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Go as far as you need to go.

347
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,520
That's been my lesson for the day.

348
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,520
So that's what we're going to do. We're going to a coffee coffin.

349
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,520
Okay, there's another article in this back.

350
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,520
Is this the Maxim show now?

351
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
Yeah.

352
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,520
Loki will give you a little quote from it.

353
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:23,520
They're talking about like Santa's new album, The Hoe Zone, and it claims it was the single, first single, Get in the Sleigh, Bitch.

354
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Yeah, anyways.

355
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,520
And that gets the, okay, whatever word I want. It'll be a week. Anyway.

356
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,520
I think now's a good time to go to break. What do you think?

357
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Um, I can break.

358
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,520
Okay, we're gonna go break stuff.

359
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
I wanna go break something.

360
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Okay, we'll be right back and we're going to play something else from the 8-Style Center.

361
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
I'm going to play a song I like.

362
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,520
I can cue that one up. I have that right here.

363
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,520
And I'm going to play a song I like, too, called Monkey Dancer.

364
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
I like that song. That song rules.

365
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,520
Monkey Dance.

366
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
Sorry, not Monkey Dancer, Monkey Dance.

367
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,520
Alright, so we'll be back in a little bit. Thanks for listening.

368
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
It's true that I

369
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
Maybe go into party or fight

370
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,520
Then I catch a mist

371
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
Show me your magic

372
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Under the moonlight

373
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
Bounds of light

374
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
A bloody veto

375
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Love of me, I don't know why

376
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Do you understand?

377
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,520
This move to the tail

378
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,520
The bird is watching me

379
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Monkey dance, monkey dance

380
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Like a star

381
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Move your booty dance, move your booty dance

382
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,520
Let's dance together, on the fire, baby

383
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,520
Monkey dance, monkey dance, let me hear

384
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Move your booty dance, move your booty dance

385
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:18,520
You can't stand still, the truth will rise from you tonight

386
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
Oh

387
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:30,840
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

388
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,440
Hello, my friends.

389
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,960
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and in that set, we heard a bunch of 8-style

390
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
songs.

391
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,640
Guideca was that last song we heard.

392
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,800
Before that, Xeno On.

393
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,280
Before that, Monkey Dance and Startin' That Sit Off.

394
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,360
I'm sure it's on this Jamie's favorite, Sakura!

395
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Cool.

396
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,760
So, um, I don't know if you guys heard the news, but I remember last week we were talking

397
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,680
about DDR Extreme and the rumor that it was coming out on Christmas Day, and I said, what

398
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
a bunch of bullshit!

399
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Ah, you were wrong!

400
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Whoops!

401
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,240
My bad, it is coming out on Christmas Day, according to the Konami official website.

402
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,720
So, okay.

403
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Okay.

404
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Alright, so I thought we'd talk a little bit about DDR Extreme and what kind of stuff we should expect to be seeing in it.

405
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,720
What we're looking forward to and all that stuff.

406
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
What have you heard, Loki? Have you heard anything on it?

407
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Oh, hey, we've got another special guest in the studio.

408
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,720
Hey, we've got some special people joining us right now.

409
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Oh, this is cool, very cool.

410
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Hello, my friends. Pick up a microphone, grab a mic.

411
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Hello.

412
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Hello.

413
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
How are you?

414
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
I am good.

415
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
Hi Amanda, say hello to Amanda.

416
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Hi, I'm Amanda.

417
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
And this is Yana, say hello.

418
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Hello.

419
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
And they've come to visit us.

420
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Now Amanda, you're a big DDR fan, right?

421
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
I guess so.

422
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Do you still even play anymore?

423
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Um, I think the last time I played, actually wait, did we?

424
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,720
I played once, like that's the last time I came over here.

425
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
I went and played like once at QsR and a fourth.

426
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Well, where did you used to play?

427
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Tell us about some of the folks that you used to play DDR with and when you got started

428
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
and all that.

429
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,720
We started off at Mountain Mike's, because that was the only machine in the area.

430
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,720
That's when I really, really started it.

431
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,720
The machine got really crappy, so we stopped playing.

432
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Then we got a seventh mix, so everyone was there.

433
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,720
And then our work schedule got busy, so I stopped.

434
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,720
What is this you showing? Shame on you.

435
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,720
They're not, no.

436
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,720
I know. They're perfectly legal. I've seen those things before.

437
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
They're just natural cigarettes.

438
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
What does it say?

439
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Let's see.

440
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
It's just a brand name.

441
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,720
Can I say over the air what these are?

442
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,720
It's yeah.

443
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,720
They're ecstasy cigarettes.

444
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,720
It's just a brand name.

445
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
It's just having to do with the chemical.

446
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,720
It doesn't have anything to do with going to the rave.

447
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,720
No, it has nothing to do with MDMA, no.

448
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Let's see.

449
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Let's read the ingredients.

450
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Damiano, wild lettuce, catnip.

451
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,720
Dude, catnip.

452
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
Let's go smoke some catnip.

453
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,720
And passion flower, mint, love and light.

454
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:08,880
I used to work at J&C for two years.

455
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,360
Damiana makes you horny.

456
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,160
Very very very horny.

457
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,560
We used to sell it to old men who couldn't get it up.

458
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,920
Herbal Viagra.

459
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
In hell.

460
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,040
So yeah.

461
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,760
You do realize you've walked in on a DDR talk show, correct?

462
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,760
Yes.

463
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,280
Why do I have the greatest idea?

464
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,360
Oh, oh, oh, whenever I have the bowling alley, they have the really crappy third mix.

465
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
Uh-huh.

466
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,920
My friend who works there pretty much got on the guy and says, look, you know what?

467
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,760
The reason this machine isn't making money is because it's crap.

468
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
You don't give it up.

469
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
And basically, she just basically told it like it was.

470
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
There's a seventh mix there now.

471
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:53,240
Pretty much the bowlers, before, were complaining about everyone stomping on it and interfering

472
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,240
with their game.

473
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
Right.

474
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
And now, because its pads work, you don't have to stomp as hard.

475
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,240
The thing that they're complaining about mostly is the music now, so they just kind of turn it down, but it's still playable.

476
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:15,240
It's funny that you mention that, because in the last segment, Jamie was just talking about Roseville Golf Land, how a lot of their games have gone to shit, and how she was going to write a boycott letter to the management, the high, high, high management, like corporate.

477
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
Nice.

478
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
God.

479
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Yes, god of golf lands, so it's funny that you bring that up.

480
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,240
Dear Shicklepot.

481
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:31,240
So, wow! So, uh, what else is going on? I don't know. What's new in the world of Amanda that she can talk about on the radio?

482
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,240
Um...

483
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,240
Did you meet Ryan in the front room? That's Black Lab. I don't know.

484
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
He's online, dude.

485
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
Is that the one who answered the door?

486
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,240
Yeah, probably.

487
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,240
He's kind of looking at me weird like, uh...

488
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,240
Who the hell are you?

489
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,240
He's like looking at us like, what the hell are you doing?

490
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Like run down to the bathroom.

491
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:59,680
been trying to take over the house. I thought, I love that CD. I love this CD. What, Frou-Frou?

hello i know we don't talk about this fact much on the show

517
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,800
That's not my preferred reading material.

518
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,200
Got it?

519
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,320
I actually have a friend who has it as well.

520
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,320
And then he basically, let's just put it this way.

521
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,040
He got himself a subscription to XY.

522
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,960
And for his birthday, his dad got a subscription to Playboy.

523
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,800
Just so happened that one day they both came in the mailbox

524
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,640
on the same day.

525
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,160
Wacky, crazy, wild stuff.

526
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,440
I think we're getting a phone call, is this, I don't know, we're not getting a phone call,

527
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,040
but our friend here in the house is getting a phone call.

528
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,760
I don't know what's going on.

529
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,000
I've lost total and absolute control of this show.

530
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,480
Hey, Amanda, did you hear there's a new DDR coming out, DDR Extreme on Christmas Day in

531
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
Japan?

532
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,840
You have this total unenthused look on your face.

533
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,080
You can't actually play the game right now, huh?

534
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,600
Well they'll have it here in about a couple weeks, I'm sure they'll get the game in Japan.

535
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,600
It's got butterfly on it!

536
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,600
So now we can all dance like house lighters.

537
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,600
And have these fleekies.

538
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,600

00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,600
This show's gone.

541
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,600
We're all nuts right about now.

542
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:25,600
I have nuts and some of us don't.

543
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,120
Yeah, I know nuts aren't your preferred...

544
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:33,600
Well you know like men are like a box of chocolates, you never know which one has nuts.

545
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:43,160
What is the match game?

546
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
What is the match game?

547
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,480
I want to do a match game, but we have to have our own.

548
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,120
Dude, it's got pictures of those guys pulling a truck with their cocks.

549
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,120
What?

550
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120

551
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120

552
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,120

You better known as the guy that was in Rushmore and also was in that other movie that I didn't like.

562
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,080
Two movies I probably haven't seen.

563
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,080

00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,080
Okay, so, I gotta get back to the chair here.

566
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,080
Let me catch Black Lab up on where we've been.

567
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,080
Black Lab, while you were out playing 2DX, we had some, uh, from the official Lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.

568
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,080
Hahahaha!

569
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,080
Amanda and Yana came into the house, so I'm getting the finger right now.

570
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,080
And the, uh, and I bet you'll be getting the finger later! Hahaha!

571
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,080
Hahahaha!

572
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,080
Actually, I think Damien's gonna be home today, so...

573
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,080
You know, if it wasn't actually for that finger, he'd still be a virgin.

574
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,080
Yeah, I just walked into the room and I'm like,

575
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,080
OK!

576
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,080
He's so cute, he's blushy!

577
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,080
I'm just trying not to laugh so hard right now.

578
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,080
Plus the sugar's kicking in.

579
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:47,080
I don't know how many of you guys have heard about the vibrator, the Hello Kitty vibrator?

580
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,080
Chocolate?

581
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,580
Wait, do you want to talk to us about the Hello Kitty vibrator?

582
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:56,580
Oh my god, it's like if you're doing it with a vibrator, you know, it's like you know somebody's

583
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,580
actually having sex with the Hello Kitty vibrator.

584
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,080
So I said it and they're like, oh, Hello Kitty!

585
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,080
I mean, come on now.

586
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,580
I mean, it's obvious anybody's going to have a Hello Kitty vibrator unless they scream

587
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,080
out the name Hello Kitty.

588
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,480
I wanted to go to San Francisco to get one.

589
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,380
That's just sickening, okay?

590
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,480
I don't know if that's the chocolate, if it was that or the chocolate that's about to make you puke, I don't know.

591
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,280
Whether it got used or not, it would just be a thing that would be cool to have.

592
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,480
Just put it on display, that's all you need it for.

593
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:27,880
I don't know, man.

594
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,680
These, uh, these, like, religious dildos look pretty funny.

595
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:39,080
You got the little Buddha, Buddha with, like, testicles for some reason, and then the, the, you know, crucifix dildo.

596
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,280
Oh yeah.

00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,620
that we're going to be playing

609
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:16,620
is from CKY. It's a Chinese freestyle rap.

610
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,980
So it's pretty sweet.

611
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,980
You guys love it.

612
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,780
Where is it? It's right there. Right? Okay.

Alright, here we go. We're going to do this. The CKY Chinese freestyle rap.

614
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,340
And in the meantime, we need some contestants for Match Game, because we're going to do that right when we get back.

615
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:38,620
But first we need a trivia question. You want to offer up a trivia question for the chatters, Jamie?

616
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,500
How are we going to get people?

617
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,520
We've got to make it kind of simple, but not too hard.

618
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,980
Something simple, but not too hard? Something not too easy.

619
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,800
Okay, what was...

620
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,360
Alright, here we go.

621
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,960
Alright, V from BeatMania2DX, what was the original song and who composed it?

622
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,000
Ah, okay, so V from 2DX, who was the original composer and the name of the original song?

623
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,040
Yes. Yes, okay.

624
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,720
So just message that to me in the chat room. And you get bonus points if you can name the symphony it's from.

625
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:16,720
Yes, bonus points if you name the symphony it's from. So, first two people to get in on that will be playing match game with all of us, all six of us in house right now. So, we'll be right back.

626
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,040
Before I can kick you higher than you can kick me

627
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,520

Oh yeah!

646
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,740
I can kick you if you don't pay the bill

647
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,740
And if you want a little mint, that's fifty cents

648
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,740
Bitch, every day costs a little bit

649
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,740
So don't expect nothing for free, at least for me

650
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,740

658
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,220
Your buddies too come nape on me

659
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,940
Goddamn the chips burnt, blew away my whole city

660
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,500
Oh, chief man, shoot a load on your chips

661
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Goddamn that's a dick, always go goodbye

662
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,020
And if you wanna cop on in

663
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,420
You can work into my world where the yellow ship begins

664
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,340
Oh my god, can't be changed

665
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,660
I got chips to control your brain and it's called

666
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,660
Egg, coal, y'all, and lo me

667
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,660
So come on in, baby, and have it just the same, all right?

668
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,660
Ha!

669
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,660
Knowing I'm down, aren't they, Dave?

670
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,660
Ha, I don't suppose.

671
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,660
Ha, ha, ha.

672
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,660
Huh?

673
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,660
Huh, huh, huh.

674
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,660
Oh, shit.

675
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,660
Oh, hi, we have dead air.

676
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,660
Hold on, I have to bring us back with a promo, though.

677
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:58,660
with a promo though. Okay we'll play one more song then we'll come back. How about this is a promo?

678
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:04,100
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio or die! Okay welcome back! We've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

679
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:12,020
And we have our two contestants for um it's so dead in our chat room tonight. I don't know what's

680
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:18,500
going on. If you want to join our chat room just go to our website orangelounge.skie.cx and join

681
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,660
our chat room. It's really dead tonight. Only about half our regulars are here but you know I

682
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:25,660
Everybody's off-filling the Christmas spirit.

683
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:58,820
a couple weeks. That's good. I think you, right? Maybe not, maybe, maybe not? I discussed

684
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:03,140
this with her. It's a two hour drive each way, so that'd be a total of eight hours driving

685
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:07,540
on my part. We'll work something out, we'll figure something out. We'll figure something

686
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:13,740
out. We'll work it out somehow. But one eight hour drive we're going to be making, you and

687
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:18,460
me low-key this weekend, we're going to SoCal. We're going to SoCal! And we're going to hopefully

688
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,940
meet some of our regulars down there and get some interviews, because SoCal Kicks is foaming

689
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:26,120
to get the mouth wanting to get on the show, so we gotta go interview him at some point.

690
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,180
So Jamie, unfortunately, I have a cry because she has to work, she's not going to be able

691
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,180
to make it, so...

692
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,180
I'm going to be marathoning on to me.

693
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,380
Well that's cool.

694
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:38,460
And you never know, during the middle of whatever we have planned, somebody's cable might start

695
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,460
working again.

696
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:40,460
That's right, and...

697
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,820
You know, that goes back to the fuck yous of the week.

698
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,940
If you enjoy the fuck off shows that's happened here in the past, guess what, it's about to

699
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,940
get twice as big.

700
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,100
Again, depending on the cable.

701
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:55,500
The fucks are going to get twice as big from Jamie because you know how angsty she can

702
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
be.

703
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,500
Okay, alright.

704
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,500
Here we go.

705
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,500
We're going to play some DDR match game.

706
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,500
DDR.

707
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:07,980
So, we have our contestants, who does our contestants say?

708
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:14,020
Our contestants today are Vidpawa from Vegas, who I'm very impressed he got the bonus question

709
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,020
too.

710
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:21,020
And nobody else got the answer to the question, which by the way, what was the answer?

711
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:25,020
The answer was Vivaldi Winter from the Four Seasons.

712
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,940
Oh, here it is.

713
00:55:54,940 --> 00:56:00,940
We have to explain for our new folks in the studio how to play this game because I don't think they've played a match game before.

714
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,980
Basically we've got phrases.

715
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,500
And on these phrases we have a blank on these phrases.

716
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,900
Basically it's like

717
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,940
I went to the mall and bought a blank.

718
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:16,940
Dildo! Hello Kitty vibrator!

719
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,700
You don't buy those at the mall.

720
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,700
You and I don't go to the same mall.

721
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,700
Unless you're in Vegas.

722
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,700
They have ones that glow in the dark. Like, you really want to see the inside.

723
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:31,700
Dude, I went to Sally's Beauty Supply to buy hair dye, and they had these things called hand massagers.

724
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,700
They look like vibrators.

725
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,700
It's like those little figure massagers you've seen infomercials before.

726
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,700
No, no, this one was dildo-ly.

727
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:41,700
Hand massager with dildo attachment.

728
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,700
And they were selling them for $3 at Sally's Beauty Supply.

729
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,700
I'm gonna make you holla!

730
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:53,500
Okay, yeah, it's time to start.

731
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,620
So we got our two contestants.

732
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,580
Now contestants, when you have an answer to fill in the blank with, you're going to message

733
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:02,180
those to me over private message, and the rest of you in the chat room that aren't playing,

734
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,180
you can still participate.

735
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:06,620
You can send your suggestions through the chat room, through the main chat room.

736
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,300
So go ahead and send those to us.

737
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,300
So here we go.

738
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,700
We're going to start, and all six of us are celebrities.

739

You don't have the largest?

00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,660
No, I don't have the largest.

747
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:57,660

755
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,860
Say hello to Amanda.

756
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,020
Hi. You're mean, Rob.

757
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,140
I know, I know. It's what I do on the show.

758
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,960
You're big.

759
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,960

Alright, those are our lovely celebrities today.

765
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,960
I just had an idea. I think we should have, like, a little counter or something for every time there's a reference to the porn.

766
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,960
You can, like, talk up the counter and we'll see what the highest number is by the end of the show.

767
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,960
Like, you can start doing that with the next live show.

768
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,960
The porn counter.

769
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,140
Like that is so South Park really

770
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:13,020
Can I do the first question now, here we go. All right, here's the first question for our folks in the chat room

771
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,420
the first question is

772
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:22,660
Nelson the newbie was so excited to be playing DDR in front of a big crowd of the DDR regulars

773
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:27,280
but he was really sad that when he picked love to me that everyone called

774
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:35,560
him a blank. Nelson the newbie was so excited to be playing DDR in front of a

775
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,940
big crowd of the DDR regulars, but he was really sad that when he picked love to

776
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:44,200
me that everyone called him a blank.

777
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:54,360
I'm just waiting on those answers in the chat real soon.

778
00:59:54,360 --> 01:00:10,200
Everyone called him a blank.

779
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,680
The obvious answers are okay.

780
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:20,680
You guys can put the obvious answers in the one.

781
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,240
I think they're locked in.

782
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,240
They're locked in right now.

783
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,760
I'm just going to check and see if they're locked in.

784
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,160
Okay, I've got one.

785
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,480
Okay, I've got both answers.

786
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,280
I do have both answers locked in from the contestants.

787
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,280
I just need to make sure.

788
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,280
Stars!

789
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,280
Celebrities!

790
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,680
Are we ready?

791
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,680
You guys are ready?

792
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,680
Here we go. Here we go. Going around the room.

793
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:49,680
Let's see. Nelson the newbie was so excited to be playing DDR in front of a big crowd of the DDR regulars.

794
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,680
But everyone was really sad that when he picked love to me that everyone called him A.

795
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,680
Let's go to the contestants.

796
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,680
Vidpawa says old school freak. Everyone called him an old school freak.

797
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,680
That's too G rated. I don't know. We'll see.

798
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,680
SoCalKick says everyone called him an idiot.

799
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,680
Idiot. Alright, that's a little harsher.

800
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,680
That's more on our page.

801
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,680
Let's see if they get any matches.

802
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,680
We have idiot and old school freak.

803
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,680
Let's see, here we go.

804
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,680
Jamie, everyone called him a...

805
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,680
Dildo.

806
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,680
Dildo!

807
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,680
Oh, eh, sorry, that is not a match.

808
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,680
Loki, everyone called him a...

809
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,680
Cocksmoker.

810
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,680
Cocksmoker!

811
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,680
I'm sorry, that is not a match.

812
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:41,680
Black Lab! I said, Ass Hat! Ass Hat! Everyone called him an Ass Hat. No, I'm sorry, Ass Hat is not a match.

813
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:51,680
Amanda? I was like really drawn for a blank, so all I said was dork. Dork is a good answer, but not a match. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, contestants, not a match.

814
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,600
Yana said everyone called him a...

815
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,760
Fag!

816
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,560
A fag!

817
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,720
Everyone called him a fag, beautiful. And I said

818
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,840
that when he picked love to me that everyone called him a fag. I also put fag.

819
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:10,600
We have an in-house match!

820
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:15,320
So, um, but unfortunately it didn't match what the contestants put. But that would have been the answer.

821
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:20,000
That would have put you in the lead if you'd guessed fag, but unfortunately you did not.

822
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,820
so that is a

823
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:25,920
that is not a match i don't know if it's an answer of the last

824
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,360

825
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,560
so you're putting bag is is usually pretty good pretty good way to get

826
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,520

827
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:36,520

828
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,800

831
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,560
files

832
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:55,480
He instead decided to go and download some blank.

833
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:01,360
Sammy the Sim File Builder was really excited to be participating in Tourney Mix 3, but

834
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,540
he was shocked to find that the site went down and he couldn't download any files.

835
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:12,540
He instead decided to go and download some blank.

836
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:38,840
See, I'm a decent file builder, really excited to be participating in T3, but he was shocked

837
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,840
to find out the site went down.

838
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,840
He couldn't download any files.

839
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,760
He instead decided to go download some blank.

840
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,000
Are all our celebrities locked in?

841
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,520
All right, all our celebrities are locked in.

842
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,280
Let's look at the, let me see if the contestants

843

Okay, great.

845
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,760
We do have our contestants in.

846
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,800
So are all the celebrities in, all our stars?

847
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,320
Yes, okay, everybody's in.

Okay, here we go.

849
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,680
The contestant said he instead decided to go

860
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:34,500
if it was a seafood buffet i bet you wouldn't have a problem with it

861
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,580
all right here we go

862
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,700
let's check with the stars

863
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,700
It's a gimme! He decided to go and download some Plank.

864
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,700
Yowie hentai Pokemon fanart.

865
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:47,700
Yowie hentai Pokemon fanart. That was almost what I put, but I changed my answer, I have to say.

866
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,700
I almost put that.

867
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,700
Loki, your answer, please.

868
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,700
Well, it's a gimme, come on.

869
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:58,700
Porn, it's like... Do you need an excuse?

870
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,700
He went to go download some porn. Alright, is that a match? What do you think, Loki?

871
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:06,700
No, it's not, because they were frickin' stupid and specific, so damn good.

872
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:11,380
just say I'm sorry that half a point each for each of them all right half a

873
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:19,420
point each one flaccid point needs all right half a point so you get a full

874
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:24,060
point to distribute amongst you guys so you each have half a point dscs says

875
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:29,340
now he's disputing because he said he said porn you said hidden camera DDR pad

876
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:35,900
porn Loki did you say hidden camera DDR pad porn no camera so orange shit that's

877
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,900
That's not porn. You get half a point. Deal with it.

878
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:42,900
I think as far as Loki's concerned, if it fucks it works.

879
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,900
Alright, Black Lab, your answer, please.

880
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:49,900
I just went with something that I knew they wouldn't say, so I just said R.O.B.S.

881
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,900
You said what?

882
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,900
I said R.O.B.S.

883
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,900
Oh, R.O.B.S. I thought you said R.O.B.S. I'm like, what?

884
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,900
I have a website.

885
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:04,900
Sky.com?

886
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,900
I didn't know I had a website.

887
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,900
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I'm bringing out the Mr. Spanky voice. My bad.

888
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,900
All right. It's all tied up. Half a point each.

889
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,900
Amanda, what did you put?

890
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:18,900
I originally put porn, and I started saying, no, that's too general.

891
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,900
I just feel a little more specific, so I said barnyard porn.

892
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,900
Barnyard porn!

893
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,900
Word. Wonderful answer, unfortunately. Not a match.

894
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,900
Yana, what did he go download? He downloaded some...

895
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,900
Midget porno.

896
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:37,540
porno I'm sorry that is also not a match although I don't I don't know cuz you

897
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:41,100
know a lot of Asian people are pretty short and if you're doing the upskirt

898
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:48,340
camp I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I'm gonna get I'm gonna get smacked all right all right

899
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:52,420
my answer as I said I was trying to match Jamie but unfortunately I didn't

900
01:06:52,420 --> 01:07:01,620
he decided to go download some Harry Potter yaoi okay I don't I don't mind

901
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:08,620
There are some things that I will not stand for to me, and this is something about ten-year-old boys.

902
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:12,620
No, I knew you weren't really going to put that, but I was hoping our contestants would.

903
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:17,620
Dude, you should have said, download naked pictures of Alan Rickman. I mean, come on.

904
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,620
That would have been, like, a definite match.

905
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:26,620
But I thought that, like, most Galleys, like, they look like they're ten years old as it is, the way they're drawn.

906
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:30,620
There are no naked pictures of Alan Rickman, also.

907
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:34,620
I'm getting smacked by the chat room for the short comment, by the way.

908
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:37,620
All these people that are Asian are hitting me.

909
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,620
I'm getting stabbed in the kneecaps. Help.

910
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:43,620
I'll stab them with the carrot.

911
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,620
Alright.

912
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,620
Alright, I'm just kidding you guys. Jesus.

913
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:49,620
Alright, here we go.

914
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:53,620
Next question. So it's tied up at half a point each. One flaccid point between them.

915
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:56,620
Our two contestants. So can I take some Vidpow at them?

916
01:07:56,620 --> 01:08:00,620
Here's the next question. I think this is the next to last.

917
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:04,620
No, there is five questions. My apologies. There's five. This is the third question.

918
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:09,620
Dana the DDR-er was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.

919
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,620
She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and said,

920
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:16,620
Wow! Everyone here looks like a blank.

921
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:25,620
Dana the DDR-er was really excited to be going to her first DDR tournament.

922
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,620
She walked through the door of the arcade, looked around and said,

923
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:31,620
wow, everyone here looks like a blank.

924
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:57,460
Okay, I have mine.

925
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:01,460
I don't know, Jamie, what do you think? I think it's funny.

926
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:05,460
Go for it. Okay, go for it.

927
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:09,460
This is going to get really wrong. All right, here we go.

928
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:13,460
Do we have both of our contestants locked in? Are we all ready? Are we all ready in the house?

929
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:17,460
Oh, Black Lab is still working. Well, let's see if the contestants are locked in. Let's see.

930
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,460
Okay, this is going to be interesting.

931
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:25,460
How many people are we going to offend with this segment? How many people are we about to

932
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,460
everybody locked in?

933
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:33,460
black lab is still working, he's slow, that's alright

934
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:37,460
he's the brat summers of the show, she was always the last one to lock in

935
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:42,460
by the way, the reason to have the game show network is for a 70's match game

936
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:43,460
oh, you're in?

937
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:48,460
no, the reason to have the game show network is press your luck, hello

938
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,460
word, word

939
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,460
the whammy owns me when it sucks

940
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:58,940
Alright, here we go. The question is, Dana the DDR was really excited to be going to

941
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:02,020
her first DDR tournament. She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and

942
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:10,740
said, wow, everyone here looks like a, VidPower says, fag. DSCS SoCalKick says, wow, everyone

943
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:17,020
here looks like a fag. They both put the same thing, they both put fag. Let's see if they're

944
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:21,540
going to get any matches on this. Jamie walked through the door and said, wow, everyone here

945
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:27,220
looks like a poo-flinging monkey because they're playing Para Para. A poo-flinging

946
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:34,220
monkey! No, I'm sorry, that is not the answer. Loki! She walked through the door to the tournament,

947
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:40,460
looked around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a... I have to apologize ahead

948
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:45,500
of time for the comment that I'm going to make to fill in the blank. I do not mean to

949
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:50,320
defend anybody, but the way it came out, the first thing it came to my head, okay, and

950
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,160
I'm not racist or anything like that.

951
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,160
Alright, alright.

952
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,440
Wow, everyone here looks like a Sweaty Jack.

953
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:02,320
Yeah, Sweaty Jack, that's what I said.

954
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,320
Sorry.

955
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,040
Oh my.

956
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,600
Not a match, unfortunately.

957
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:11,680
Not a match.

958
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,040
I try to be orange, like orange lamp.

959
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,480

01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,920

967
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:49,560
friendly to all our... all our friends. Amanda. Dana the DDRter was really excited to be going

968
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:53,420
to her first DDR tournament. She walked through the door to the arcade, looked around and

969
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:58,420
said, wow, everyone here looks like a... Once again, I have to apologize for this. I've

970
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:04,420
been out of the team for a while, but I had to take them home. A while ago. A split wannabe.

971
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,420
Wow, everyone here...

972
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,420
Which, you know...

973
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:12,420
I say give him half a point, Eve, for that comment.

974
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,420
That was good.

975
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,420
Is the other thing...

976
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,420
Amanda gets a zing! That's one zing!

977
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,420
Yes! A zing!

978
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,420
And actually, the other thing, I always think he was going to say,

979
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:28,420
that everyone was a tool.

980
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:30,420
Because he says that so much.

981
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:35,420
I've got a lot of laughter in the chat room, what can you say?

982
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,420
All right.

983
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:39,420
I feel like they deserve half a point each for their answer.

984
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:40,420
So we're going to up them to one.

985
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,420
Okay, one full point a piece.

986
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:43,420
They've got one full point a piece.

987
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:45,420
Beautiful.

988
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:48,420
Zing cat.

989
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:49,420
Yana.

990
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,420
Wow, everyone here looks like a?

991
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,420
Hairy penis with crabs.

992
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:58,420
A hairy penis with crabs?

993
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,420
That was lovely.

994
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,420
I tried.

995
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,420
I mean, actually...

996
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:06,420
No.

997
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,420
No, I haven't.

998
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:11,420
It's like a penis with, like, a fro or something, you know?

999
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:16,420
Oh, my God.

1000
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:23,420
answer. I have a furball in my mouth. She walked through the door to the arcade, looked

1001
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:31,760
around and said, wow, everyone here looks like a fag. I did put fag. So they get two

1002
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:40,540
points each. The two of three out of Ross' answers are very gay. Well, you know. Alright,

1003
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:45,160
here we go. Two more questions left here on Orantan's Mask Game. I lied, there's actually

1004
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:49,160
So they each have two points, not bad.

1005
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,160
Better than last time.

1006
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,160
They've matched half a time each.

1007
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:57,160
I can't believe you came in that half point. I know we're going to get hate mail off that one.

1008
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:01,160
And Amanda got a zing.

1009
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:04,160
Alright, your next question.

1010
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:09,160
Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal this next weekend.

1011
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:14,160
They decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.

1012
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:22,160
Lokee and Skye took a trip to SoCal. They decided that their first stop definitely had to be blank.

1013
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:27,160
I have mine already.

1014
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:34,160
What's the first stop?

1015
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:40,160
They decided that their first stop definitely had to be Blaine.

1016
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:55,160
One of our contestants has absolutely no idea how to answer this question.

1017
01:14:55,160 --> 01:15:00,760
question

1018
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:04,120
low-key and sky took a trip to socal next week and they decided that their first

1019
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:10,220
stop definitely had to be blank. It doesn't have to be a specific place.

1020
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:15,200
We have both our contestants locked in. Are all of our studio celebrities locked in?

1021
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:20,240
One of our studio celebrities ran away from this show. That's kind of scary.

1022
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:20,740
What?

1023
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:21,540
He'll be back in a sec.

1024
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:22,040
Okay.

1025
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:22,540
How about you guys?

1026
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,240
You guys locked in?

1027
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:23,740
Ready?

1028
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,240
Oh, you're debating on an answer.

1029
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,440
Ooh, he's back in!

1030
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,040
Oh, he's got the Raybar stick.

1031
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:32,240
Is he the one who came back to get someone?

1032
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,240
Dude, you've got a Raybar stick.

1033
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,540
No, wave it around and change the color.

1034
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:36,040
Woo!

1035
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:36,640
That's cool.

1036
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,340
That's pretty.

1037
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,840
Wait, wait, turn off the light, Yana.

1038
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,540
Turn off the light.

1039
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:41,040
Turn off the light.

1040
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:41,440
Here we go.

1041
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:41,940

1042
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:44,240
Oh, dude, yeah!

1043
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,140
Dude, I want one too.

1044
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:47,140
Yeah, I want one, too.

1045
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:51,640
That's pretty rad.

1046
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,140
Amazing seizure.

1047
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,640
Amazing seizure action.

1048
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,140
Okay, let's turn the light back on.

1049
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,640
Are all our celebrities locked in?

1050
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,640
Yes, here we go.

1051
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,140
Loki and Sky took a trip to SoCal.

1052
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:05,140
Their first stop definitely had to be...

1053
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,640
SoCalKix says,

1054
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,140
SoCalKix's place.

1055
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,640
Yeah!

1056
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,640
Surprise, shock of socks.

1057
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,640
By the way, no.

1058
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,140
Vidpawa...

1059
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,140

01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,380
doing that is a match

1071
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,420
that's it

1072
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:31,420
that he had servers that we get a drug enough maybe

1073
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:36,180

IHGP

1083
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:13,780
I don't know if you've ever seen this in West Hollywood, there's a gay superstore and it

1084
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:19,940
says GAY SUPERSTORE in big print and under that, parking and rear.

Alright, Yana, Sky and Loki went to SoCal Kicks, their first stop had to be...

1087
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,500
The Dildo Factory.

01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:37,500
The Dildo Factory!

1089
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:43,780
Oh, I'm sorry, what? None of them hear what?

1090
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:50,780
We said once to SoCal, you said SoCal kicks.

1091
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:55,500
Whatever, I'm going to crack today.

1092
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,580
okay so yeah i'm sorry that's not a match the dildo factory wallet brilliant

1093
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:01,180
answer is not a match

1094
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,060
my answer was

1095
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:06,140
i was i was thinking along very similar lines as somebody else here in the

1096
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:09,900
studio that our first stop definitely had to be i put a gas station because

1097
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,260
yes we're gonna have to pay

1098
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:12,980
this is an eight hour drive

1099
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:17,220
unfortunately not a match so so cal kicks is ahead by a score of three to

1100
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:18,340
two

1101
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:21,740
so vidpower vidpower is going to need this next one

1102
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:23,740
This is it. This is it. This is the last question.

1103
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:25,740
You need to match on this, okay?

1104
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:27,740
Here we go.

1105
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:30,740
Here we go.

1106
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,740
Here we go. Here we go.

1107
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38,740
Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day.

1108
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:41,740
We're talking this Jamie right here in the house.

1109
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:43,740
Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day.

1110
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,740
Yeah, screw them.

1111
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:50,740
She decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.

1112
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:55,740
Jamie was really irritated by her co-worker some day.

1113
01:19:55,740 --> 01:20:00,740
decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.

1114
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:20,740
Okay, you want to tell that story about the Light FM?

1115
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:26,740
My work, my boss, and I like the people I work with, but they listen to the light FM all day.

1116
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:39,740
Like, they play Celine Dion all day, and Richard Marx, and Brian Adams.

1117
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:45,740
And they don't play the good Brian Adams songs. They played Heaven once, that was cool, but they don't play any of the other good songs.

1118
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:48,620
which really has one other good song which is number 69

1119
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,560
what about that

1120
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,460
uh... the one from robin hood

1121
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:55,820
they play that all day

1122
01:20:55,820 --> 01:21:00,820
that plays sucks all of us celebrities watch him

1123
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:05,260
and then there's the people outside our office that play loud rap

1124
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,220
like modern rap not like

1125
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:09,420
is there a good idea to get through

1126
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:12,940
no

1127
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:16,440
I love this quote here, I'm reading Happy Noodle Boy, and it says,

1128
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:21,940
I'm going to fly into your butt, prepare all asses for vicious entry.

1129
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:28,940
Next week, on Orange Launch Radio.

1130
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:32,940
I've got a sound clip of Loki.

1131
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:36,940
I, I, I handed him my Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.

1132
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:39,940
I can just see it now, the replacing, since the, um,

1133
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:43,940
For the life of me, I can't get the hookers to have sex with me, I'm just kinda lost with them.

1134
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:52,940
By the way, speaking of Johnny the homicidal maniac, um, we're still taking, I think, auditions for, uh, the, uh, zombie day.

1135
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:55,940
I think, I don't know, officials in the chat room, let us know.

1136
01:21:55,940 --> 01:22:00,940
Um, but send in your, your sound clip auditions to, uh, to, uh, me.

1137
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:02,940
Alright. Cool!

1138
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:04,940
And they can reach you through the show email address.

1139
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:04,940
Yes.

1140
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:06,940
If they need to. orangelaunchradio.com.

1141
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:07,940
Yes.

1142
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:08,940
Alright, here we go.

1143
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:14,940
Jamie was really irritated by her co-workers one day. She decided the best way to get her revenge was to put some blank in her radio.

1144
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:23,940
VidPower dedicates its answer to EOSVB and says, I'm going to say Propel. If it's a Propel in a radio, that would probably blow up the radio.

1145
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,940
That would tear up my radio.

1146
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:31,940
Zokowkik says he's going to put some yaoi moaning CDs in her radio.

1147
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,940
Moan.

1148
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:37,940
No, we're not putting in the gravitation soundtrack.

1149
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:42,940
Alright Jamie, best way to get some revenge on the co-workers, you're going to put some...

1150
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:43,940
Korean booty music.

1151
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:45,940
Korean booty music in the radio.

1152
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:46,940
Which I have done before.

1153
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:49,940
I'm sorry, not a match. Good answer.

1154
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:51,940
Well, that's because I've done it.

1155
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:55,940
Oh yeah, okay. Very good answer.

1156
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:58,940
The only answer, really.

1157
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,940
All the others are just one of these.

1158
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:03,940
Okay Loki, she decided to put some plank in her radio.

1159
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:07,780
okay i was going to say yurvi koka but that doesn't make any sense so

1160
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:14,020
bagpipe music bagpipe music i've done that before too

1161
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:19,140
brilliant but not a match black lab she's gonna put some

1162
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:24,340
i said the bad tack music the bad tack music

1163
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:29,140
i there's no there's things exactly i have played

1164
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:32,900
tack by the way my ultimate tak cd in the office before so far

1165
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:37,060
there's been internal matches pretty good there's going to be the uh 12

1166
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:40,340
minute version of stoic

1167
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:46,340
i'd rather listen to albert kirk even listen to

1168
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:52,900
listen to a 12-minute stoic all right okay amanda what is she gonna put in a

1169
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:57,780
radio i just understood the question that's okay

1170
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:02,340
that's okay amanda we forgive you anyway what does she put in a radio

1171
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:07,340
I'm thinking this is more of a way of destruction than anything.

1172
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:09,340
Oh, okay. Well, Jamie's pretty destructive.

1173
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:12,340
So, um, cherry bomb juice and vanilla sauce and vanilla coke.

1174
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:17,340
You own, thank you.

1175
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:21,340
That's very close to propel, but unfortunately not close enough.

1176
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:23,340
It's my second happy crack.

1177
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:28,340
I'm just thinking you put it in the radio and that way it kind of short circuses and blows up.

1178
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:56,660
It was pretty frightening, the songs actually were like, there was this one about them talking

1179
01:24:56,660 --> 01:25:00,660
And it was this weird country type song and it was just strange.

1180
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:03,660
It was like Dolly Parton's there too. It was scary.

1181
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:04,660
Okay, well, Yana, it's your turn.

1182
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:06,660
Oh crap. Alright, Yana.

1183
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:14,660
You need to stop quoting that in the middle of nowhere like that.

1184
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:17,660
Anyway, the Hamster Dance speed version.

1185
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:22,660
No, they used to have that on their site where you could actually speed up the music and it played twice as fast.

1186
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:25,660
And it was, like, god awful.

1187
01:25:55,660 --> 01:26:02,940
in a radio actually actually there has been voluntary coming out of my radio

1188
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:12,460
yeah because it was on my fifth so unfortunately not a match which means by

1189
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:19,860
a score of three to two so Cal kicks is the winner so a wiener is you this is

1190
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:26,860
less. Congratulations. Yay, you! Vidpowah, good effort. Congrats, you! You know what,

1191
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:32,300
two points I believe is better than anyone did last week. That's true! So that's something

1192
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:38,460
to be proud of. Now, no, 23magus I believe got a point at the end and I was a big liar

1193
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:42,160
and I said his prize would be he'd get his name in lights on the website and that never

1194
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:47,060
happened because I'm lazy. So we'll think of, we'll probably do them both. We'll send

1195
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:51,860
them a cookie. Maybe we'll send him a special Orange Lounge present. And since we're going

1196
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:55,940
to SoCal next week and we could very well be bumping into SoCalCakes, we'll give SoCalCakes

1197
01:26:55,940 --> 01:27:00,580
a nice little Orange Lounge present too. We'll give him an orange. Yes. I'm sorry, Black

1198
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:09,420
Eye? I think he wants something else. 23rd Magus is very sad that I never put his name

1199
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:12,500
in lights the whole time. We'll give him a cookie. We'll give him a cookie, so shut up.

1200
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,500
These are better.

1201
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:16,580
Bloody fuck monkeys, refuse my request of love.

1202
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:19,100
Here's this blood feud ends, grand pappy.

1203
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,500
Grand pappy rub my feet.

1204
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:24,300
Me feet's grand pappy.

1205
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:27,380
On that note, I believe it is a very good time to go to a break.

1206
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,980
Yes, we have the wit and lore of Happy Noodle Boy.

1207
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:32,980
That's one of our longest statements ever.

1208
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:33,980
Shit.

1209
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,820
We'll be right back after some...

1210
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:36,820
More trainwreck.

1211
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:37,820
More trainwreck.

1212
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:38,820
Let's uh...

1213
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:43,820
We'll play this one to start off this break. Enjoy. We'll be right back in a little bit.

1214
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:12,820
Have a mouthful here, same old country rhyme

1215
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:14,820
And the words have been repeated

1216
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:16,820
Well I love

1217
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:19,820
Where would you be now?

1218
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:26,820
Well I love

1219
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:31,820
When the snow is from this roof

1220
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:33,820
Down along this ramp

1221
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:35,820
So I know that the best thing is

1222
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:36,820
For me coming back

1223
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:38,820
I'm coming back with my love

1224
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:42,820
Where would you be right now?

1225
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:49,820
With my love

1226
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:54,820
If the music never came to the base I'm forming it

1227
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:56,820
Forming it, forming it, forming it, forming it

1228
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,820
And now DJ Listz starts rocking it

1229
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:00,820
Rocking it, rocking it, rocking it, rocking it

1230
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:04,820
I'll be with my love

1231
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:06,820
Where would you be right now?

1232
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:09,820
Tears, they're running in the hyper

1233
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:11,820
I'm gonna run and see what's on the mic, yeah

1234
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,820
Let it go, everybody move along

1235
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:14,820
Move along, move along

1236
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:16,820
Well, again, I'm all essential

1237
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:18,820
And the sound will sense the breeze

1238
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:20,820
The dimples push in my mind

1239
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:22,820
Cause I know they're robbing me

1240
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:23,820
Of my love

1241
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:27,820
Where would you be right now?

1242
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:28,820
Not at night now

1243
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:17,980
I forget that that's the bad MP3 and I can't play that one, so we're gonna go to the next

1244
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:18,980
song right away here.

1245
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:22,220
We're gonna play some stuff from Poppin' Music Mickey.

1246
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:23,220
This shit rules.

1247
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:24,220
Enjoy.

1248
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:25,220
What?

1249
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,220
What, Logie?

1250
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:31,220
And there's also a song off the Nintendo 64 version of Disney's radio.

1251
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:32,220
Cool.

1252
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:07,220
If we weren't in the show starting right away we'd be in the audience too.

1253
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:10,220
In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room.

1254
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,220
In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room.

1255
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:19,220
All the birds sing words and the flowers prune in the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room

1256
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,220
The bird of paradise is an elegant bird

1257
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:36,220
It likes to be seen and it loves to be heard

1258
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:39,220
Most little birdies will fly away

1259
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:42,220
But the Tiki Tiki Birds are here every day

1260
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:45,020
In the ticky, tricky, tricky, tricky room

1261
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:48,100
In the ticky, tricky, tricky, tricky room

1262
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:50,940
All the birds sing words and the flowers groom

1263
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:52,940
But d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d Farnham

1264
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:24,940
A fine musician, fun and dancing are the first requisition

1265
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:26,940
Music in the key, a piece in harmony

1266
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:29,940
The world all together and that's the way it has to be

1267
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:31,940
Moving to the beat, there were shoes on the street

1268
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,940
100,000 lots of funky things to go through

1269
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:35,940
Singing in the house, who looks up house?

1270
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:38,940
A window and a mickey and you see what it's about

1271
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:40,940
I, I make it

1272
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:42,940
I'm busting and rolling

1273
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:45,940
I, I make it

1274
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,940
I'll show you about the way it feels

1275
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,940
I, I, I make it

1276
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:52,980
Oh, too, I want you to play me

1277
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:58,700
I, I, make it home, home, home

1278
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:01,380
Yeah, the Disney prop is coming at ya

1279
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:03,380
Head him off at the park, homie

1280
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:05,180
Uh, I mean, homie?

1281
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:07,060
Yeah!

1282
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:09,220
Now anyone can tell you when you're looking for fun

1283
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:11,620
He's the mouse with the monkeys, he's the only one

1284
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:13,940
But you're supposed to be cool, standing by, what's the last?

1285
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:16,580
You see, only nice to do it, so you can leave your head up in

1286
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:18,580
I, I, make it home

1287
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:44,580
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1288
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:46,580
The server made a bit of a fight in the head.

1289
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:48,580
The server made a bit of a fight in the head.

1290
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:50,580
The server made a bit of a fight in the head.

1291
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,580
You're so bad.

1292
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:55,580
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1293
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:57,580
Welcome to our nightmare.

1294
01:33:57,580 --> 01:34:00,580
Now you said you had an impersonation you wanted to do for us.

1295
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,580
Yes, Yana?

1296
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:04,580
Oh, yes. It's Mickey Mouse having sex.

1297
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:06,580
Oh, oh, oh, Minnie!

1298
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,580
Pluto, what you doing down there?

1299
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:10,580
Oh, oh, don't stop now.

1300
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:12,580
Ha, ha, ha.

1301
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:19,580
Oh, keep going Pluto! Act like it's a hot dog! Oh yeah! Lick that mustard right off, baby!

1302
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:24,580
Oh yeah! Oh, hi Minnie!

1303
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:27,580
I'm not cheating on you!

1304
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:30,580
OrangeLunchRadio, how low can you go? How low?

1305
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:32,580
So low!

1306
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:38,580
That was cool.

1307
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:40,580
It was an error, why?

1308
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:44,580
I'm dismayed. We need to do our Fuck Yous of the Week.

1309
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:45,580
We're going to do our Fuck Yous of the Week?

1310
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:46,580
Yeah.

1311
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:53,580
Okay, well then let me close up all the windows so I can get folks to send me their F Yous of the Week.

1312
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:58,580
You want to send those on over to me over private message, or you can send them to our email at orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

1313
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:02,580
But before the Fuck Yous of the Week, maybe we ought to, because I need a little time to get the music queued up,

1314
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:03,580
maybe now is a good time to do the Sim Update?

1315
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:04,580
Sim Update.

1316
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:06,580
Sim Update.

1317
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:18,580
Okay. Um, let's see. Big news this week, of course, is that Turning Mix 3, it's, uh, all the files are up to download. Oh, wait, you can't because the server's clogged. Sorry. Ah.

1318
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:26,580
So, now they're all up to download, but you're one of the lucky ones that's able to actually get through and you can download over a hundred different DWIs.

1319
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:36,580
They ended up having, like I said, 100 entries come in for heavy, so they bumped down 70 of those down to standard, I guess.

1320
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:51,580
Really don't understand the point of it because, I mean, they say it's because of the fact that they only wanted 30 in heavy, but I think they're just putting the names of people that they actually recognize in there and bumping down everyone else.

1321
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,580
Uh, did you make the cut?

1322
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:54,580
No, I got bumped down.

1323
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:55,580
Don't!

1324
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:59,580
It doesn't matter at all because no one can play any of the files right now, so hah.

1325
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:04,580
Bitter, table for one, bitter.

1326
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:12,580
And, big news on my site, LeechFromLoki.com, or.tk is going to become one of the largest sim file sites ever.

1327
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:13,580
Ever.

1328
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:20,580
Ever. I got, um, DDR Alama from DDR Maniacs has given me unlimited space and unlimited bandwidth to do with whatever I want.

1329
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:36,580
So now, you will be able to find LeechFromLoki.tk at the new address, which is not yet up, but it will be www.WillDDRForFood.com, or.net, slash LeechFromLoki.

1330
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:40,580
I'm sorry, did I hear that right? WillDDRForFood.com?.net.

1331
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:41,580
.net.

1332
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:48,580
And I will have everything. I've got, right now in my collection, I have 1,800 sim files, so all those will be going up.

1333
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:51,580
And then, of course, the tourney mix stuff and whatever else I can throw up there.

1334
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:52,580
Evary thing.

1335
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:59,580
Evary thing, yes. Everything that's going to be fixed. I have to fix everything to make sure it's all working correctly.

1336
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:06,580
But, yeah, so I have to do a complete redesign of the site, and that might take a while, so, you know.

1337
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:16,580
In the meantime, well, there is a few updates on my site, but I haven't really linked those to the main page yet, so you won't see them, unless I've told you so.

1338
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:18,580
Oh well.

1339
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:27,580
Other than just the simp file stuff, not too much going on other than Turning Mix 3.

1340
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:29,580
That's pretty much the big thing.

1341
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:33,580
Of course, I already mentioned earlier in the show, but if anyone that just joined us

1342
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:43,580
may get in and get warned, it's getting pushed back to two weeks from now because of our site going down.

1343
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:47,580
23rd Magus would like to know if we can do a live step file review at some point.

1344
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:56,580
That's a good idea. I can't set it up tonight because I don't have the resources, because what happens is if I load the emulator on this computer, the show crashes.

1345
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,580
Or we get a lot of drops. We get a lot, a lot of drops, so I can't do it.

1346
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:05,580
But what we can do is one night we'll get my roommate to log into his system, and we can do a set file review on his computer.

1347
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:09,580
Maybe we'll review... We'll do our own take on some of the TourneyMix 3 entries. What do you think?

1348
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:15,580
Alright, here's the funny thing. Some people are getting pissed off that they can't download their own files.

1349
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:19,580
So they're putting their files up on DNR maniacs to download for other people.

1350
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:25,580
Well, unfortunately, stupid people out there, that disqualifies you. Ha ha.

1351
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:33,580
So, you get to try the nice sim files out there, but they're going to be disqualified for all you to post them.

1352
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:38,580
They will be up all this week, so maybe try back later this week.

1353
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:45,580
Another thing is DDRPC. We were expecting a new character pack, but unfortunately there's not.

1354
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:49,580
Which makes me think that's going to be a Christmas themed one that will be released on Christmas.

1355
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:50,580
So, look for that.

1356
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:51,580
Aw, how cute.

1357
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:53,580
It's going to be Bondage Santa.

1358
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:57,580
Mr. Spanky needs a partner!

1359
01:38:57,580 --> 01:39:03,580
Okay, so Amanda's on the phone, and is that it for some updates?

1360
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:04,580
That's it, I think.

1361
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:05,580
Okay.

1362
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:06,580
We need a Miss Spanky.

1363
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:09,580
If we're going to have a Mr. Spanky, we need a Miss Spanky.

1364
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:11,580
Have you guys ever seen Mr. Spanky, the DDR character?

1365
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:13,580
There's a new DDR character named Mr. Spanky.

1366
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:15,580
I know you've been out on the scene for a little while, Amanda.

1367
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:17,580
But, okay, Amanda's going, what the hell are you talking about?

1368
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:18,580
Okay, hold on, let me load it up.

1369
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:20,580
I'm going to be bondage-able.

1370
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:23,580
Bondable on the, with leather straps.

1371
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:26,580
Yeah, it's for a PC version.

1372
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:36,580
PC version of DDR that Konami Hawaii put out, and they say that they have downloadable characters, but nobody plays enough characters.

1373
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:42,580
Oh, I thought they've rearranged the page a little bit. I thought they did. No, I guess not.

1374
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:48,580
I thought there were only one more set to download. Anyway, there's Mr. Spanky right there, Amanda.

1375
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:50,580
Oh my.

1376
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:52,580
It's that bad.

1377
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:54,580
Alright, it's even worse in audio.

1378
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:57,580
Yes, it's even worse in audio.

1379
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:00,580
Mr. Spanky is a regular on our show, though.

1380
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:02,580
He does.

1381
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,580
What do you think of Zach?

1382
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:05,580
He gives our love advice. I'm a lesbian.

1383
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:06,580
Oh.

1384
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:11,580
Well, what do you think of Alice?

1385
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:13,580
She likes Robin.

1386
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:15,580
I like my girlfriend.

1387
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:19,580
Alright, whatever. She can't even get you to cyber flirt. Anyway.

1388
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:23,580
Hey, I fuckin' miss my Alice on my DDR characters, okay?

1389
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,580
Fuckin' name my car after her, shit.

1390
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:28,580
That someone set on fire, correct?

1391
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:30,580
Backseat, yes.

1392
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:34,580
Someone set Amanda's- Someone set Alice on fire, isn't that sad?

1393
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:38,580
Yes, um, so when are we gonna get onto the fuck yous?

1394
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:43,580
Amanda's- Wow, I think Amanda's really eager for this. What do you think, Jamie?

1395
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:44,580
Let's go to the fuck yous.

1396
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:47,580
Let's go to the fuck yous, indeed. Here we go.

1397
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:54,580
Okay, my first Fuck You in the Week actually goes to my belt, which, um, it's one of those

1398
01:40:54,580 --> 01:41:01,580
neat ones that you get at, I got it at Torrid, and, uh, it has, uh, these, uh, leather, uh,

1399
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:05,580
long leather laces that hang down the sides, and one of them broke off, so there's, you

1400
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:07,580
know, the $18 one for.

1401
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:12,580
Um, my other one goes toward, again, Roseville Goughland, but everyone heard the rant earlier.

1402
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:19,580
And actually, even more so it goes for that manager who missed, and Steve, who runs the place.

1403
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:21,580
That's a good one.

1404
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:23,580
Eat our collective pussy.

1405
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:30,580
Yeah! No, I'm sorry. I actually, if I'm going to have something get near my pussy, it won't be done.

1406
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:33,580
Zing!

1407
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:39,580
Okay, I only use, I only prefer high quality equipment, thank you.

1408
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:41,580
NOT BROKEN LIKE THEY ARE.

1409
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:43,580
Okay. Anyway.

1410
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:45,580
Next, um...

1411
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:47,580
What did I say my other one was?

1412
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:49,580
I kinda got less thanks to you for a while.

1413
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:51,580
Um...

1414
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:53,580
I don't remember.

1415
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:55,580
Anyone call me some place?

1416
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:57,580
Oh, that's kinda shitty.

1417
01:41:57,580 --> 01:41:59,580
Oh, what about your cheating thing?

1418
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:01,580
Yeah, my tooth!

1419
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:03,580
This is sorta half bad, half good.

1420
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:08,580
Um, after eating a delicious dinner of, you know, sesame chicken over rice, um...

1421
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:22,340
I'm walking over to Target and my mouth starts to hurt and I feel back to my back left molar

1422
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:24,180
and there's a big break in it!

1423
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:25,460
Yay, I'm happy.

1424
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:29,780
So I'm hurting all day and the broken parts are rubbing up against the skin and my mouth

1425
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:31,060
is really hurting.

1426
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:38,020
So I had an emergency visit with my dentist next day and my dentist is awesome.

1427
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:41,420
It turned out that the tooth that was broken was one of my wisdom teeth and not one of

1428
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:45,260
my molars, which was a good thing, because the wisdom teeth needed to go anyway.

1429
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:48,660
They were slightly impacted and probably stuck on my other teeth.

1430
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:52,340
So I went in, had the tooth out.

1431
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:56,140
This is what sucks is that I didn't have a way to get there, and I had to walk in the

1432
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:58,740
rain to the bus stop, wait 30 minutes in the rain.

1433
01:42:58,740 --> 01:42:59,740
While your mouth was bleeding.

1434
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:02,380
No, that was before the wind was blowing.

1435
01:43:02,380 --> 01:43:05,620
And then I get down there, and then it's still raining when I have to come back and walk

1436
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:11,540
from the train from the other bus stop and the whole time is my mouth is bleeding from where the

1437
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:17,540
you know i've got my mouth full of gauze i get home and i'm tired and then this is what amazes

1438
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:24,660
me is how many people were telling me oh you should take it easy i felt fine it's just a tooth

1439
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:29,780
i'm telling you though you didn't go under and you only had one done but when i went under and

1440
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:35,220
had all four done i was out for 24 hours you did not talk to me i did not exist to you but after

1441
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:37,220
After that I was fine, so I could see that part.

1442
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:41,220
I'm gonna have them leave me awake for my other grief. All they're gonna do is just rub my mouth up.

1443
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:49,220
Well, I actually, when I had mine removed, I had all four out at once, but they put me under both the IV and the gas anesthetic, so I could get knocked out.

1444
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:50,220
I'm not having an IV.

1445
01:43:50,220 --> 01:44:00,220
Well, they knocked me out cold for an hour to get all four of my teeth out, and I was so wasted afterwards from all the painkillers.

1446
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:06,220
I was pretty much dead for my entire spring break that year.

1447
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:11,220
So I was pretty tired. I went to work the next day and I was really exhausted.

1448
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:13,220
They didn't expect much of anything from me.

1449
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:16,220
When I got mine out at 15, actually I was fine. They put me out.

1450
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:18,220
They gave me the gas and the IV.

1451
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:20,220
Pretty much got home. I was sitting in the car.

1452
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:23,220
My dad was waiting for me at the hot show and my ice cap came out.

1453
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:27,220
So I was putting pink cups on my teeth because they were cold.

1454
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:36,220
Pretty much got home, and I was talking to my friends, I was feeling fine, and the next day I was well up about twice what I should be.

1455
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:42,220
So if any of those of you are listening who need your wisdom teeth out, and they tell you don't talk afterwards, don't talk.

1456
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:45,220
Because they forgot to tell me, and I did, so.

1457
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:52,220
This is what sucks about all the work I need done. I need my other three wisdom teeth out, and then I have a broken molar next to my right.

1458
01:44:52,220 --> 01:45:03,500
I actually have to have a root canal, it has to be a crown, it has to be a crown, and I

1459
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:06,180
have to shave part of the bone off of my mouth.

1460
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:07,180
So that sucks.

1461
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:08,180
So fuck my teeth.

1462
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:09,180
I mean, not nuts.

1463
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:10,180
No.

1464
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:11,180
Yeah, I'm not allowed to suck anything.

1465
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:12,180
So, you know.

1466
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:13,180
Nor can I spit, so.

1467
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:16,200
don't take care of what you're not a lot of stuff for a few days right yeah i'm

1468
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:19,920
not a lot of stuff

1469
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,080
not nor can i

1470
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,240
the whole of the

1471
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,240
useless

1472
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:26,600
let's do it

1473
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,640
i think

1474
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:29,720
it's bittersweet

1475
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:30,520
uh...

1476
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:34,960
or sucks there's not going to be swallowed

1477
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:38,240
i decided to add over

1478
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,760
on the high

1479
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:45,400
on the I.V. thing because you said that you won't do the I.V.

1480
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:49,200
You know, I didn't know they were going to do an I.V. on me, so a really, really late

1481
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:52,380
fuck you to the people who did my surgery, what they did, they distracted me, they had

1482
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:56,160
a nurse on the left talking to me, and I'm like, yeah, duh duh duh duh duh, and then

1483
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:59,320
like, okay, we're just going to put some alcohol in your hand, duh duh duh duh duh, and then

1484
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:03,800
all of a sudden, I feel this little prick on my right side, I look, they fucking stuck

1485
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:08,000
the I.V. in me, and I feel it, all on my arm, get in my brain, I'm out.

1486
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:15,000
I cannot have an IV because I will bruise very badly.

1487
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:20,000
When they did my IV, they told me I had a week at a time that I was going to get it.

1488
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
But I mean, those things don't do that quick.

1489
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:29,000
They put the gas on me, and it took about a minute, and my fingers started getting tingly in the IV, and they were like,

1490
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:35,000
countdown from 100. And I was like, I'm not even going to try. And I was like, how did

1491
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I finish that sentence? It was quick. I'm going to ask them actually if I can stay awake

1492
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,000
for a second. Wow. Because I would rather be. Well, they're going to numb my mouth anyway,

1493
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,000
right? Yeah, it's still, yeah, when you're unconscious, it's a lot easier. You know what?

1494
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I fell asleep when I was having five killings done. But Jamie's a trooper. It was not, it

1495
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:06,000
It was, well, I know that he hit a nerve on one of them, because the nerve went numb, it was one of the major nerves in my mouth that I saved, you know, I got so good.

1496
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I gotta jump in here, I know you probably got some more fuck you's in here, but, oh, that's it? Okay, because I want to get to Amanda and Yana because they gotta go soon, so I wanted to go ahead and let them jump in with RFU's of the Week, because they've never got to do this before, so Amanda.

1497
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I know this isn't really a fuck you song, but I know it's Amanda's like favorite video series.

1498
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Not anymore?

1499
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Not really.

1500
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1501
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
it is a fuck you song, because you don't like it anymore, I'm sorry.

1502
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
No, I don't like it, it's not as good.

1503
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Okay, I love you here. So these are belated, but that's okay.

1504
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Onyana's part. Fuck you to the doctors who told her her sling was swelled up and made her go to the hospital emergency room.

1505
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,000
She had to get surgery to get it, you know, operated on, when there was nothing wrong,

1506
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,000
except she had a sinus infection and strep throat and she was dehydrated.

1507
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Who was it, Kaiser?

1508
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Um, no, it was Jackson County.

1509
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Um...

1510
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Oops, sorry.

1511
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Anyway, um...

1512
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
That's alright.

1513
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
And fuck you to the people who burned the back of my car!

1514
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I stole, um, Yana's stuff out of my car.

1515
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Fuck you to Costco just because I work there, and um...

1516
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
They make me work all the time, and...

1517
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
But they have good wieners.

1518
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,000
No comment, I don't like hot dogs.

1519
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Oh, the chicken bake?

1520
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I know I have several other fuck yous.

1521
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Fuck you to

1522
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Sonoma County police officers

1523
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:41,000
to call me on the thing and give me a CD ticket.

1524
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:45,000
How fast?

1525
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I was going 80, but he clocked me for 75 because he actually asked me how fast I was going.

1526
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:02,000
How fast I thought I was going. Well, you know, those slides I looked down, I saw it was about 75.

1527
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,000
And believe it or not, well actually I was going 80, but guess what he clocked me at.

1528
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Fortunately, though, the police officer was very nice. It wasn't actually him himself.

1529
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
more

1530
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
fuck the law

1531
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
thank you

1532
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
um

1533
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
fuck you to very other people who shall rename nameless

1534
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I'm not gonna be listening anyway

1535
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
what did they do to you?

1536
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
oh just the general public

1537
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
fuck the general public that doesn't listen to orange clouds

1538
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
well let's see

1539
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
well hang on

1540
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I shall return, hang on

1541
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Why don't you know, just fuck you to, um, Y'all Never Made Jamie, because...

1542
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
No, not you, not you, not you.

1543
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
This is, um, Miss P.

1544
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Oh, Princess.

1545
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Yes.

1546
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
What did, what did she do now?

1547
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
What has she done?

1548
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Who hasn't she done? Alright.

1549
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
No, well, that's, well, like, no, he's just...

1550
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
He's just a terrifying, terrifying person.

1551
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I've, I've met, uh, Princess P a couple times, and, uh...

1552
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Interesting, interesting character.

1553
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Yes.

1554
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Alright.

1555
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Is that all your Fuck You?

1556
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Oh, oh, oh, no, there's one more.

1557
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Jamie kind of waving the little Raybar wand reminded me.

1558
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Fuck You to Carl Hills who was once part of Cool World

1559
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
who at one of our recent LiveScapes events

1560
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
ran off with our door money

1561
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,000
and at the second event actually got a broken, sorry,

1562
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
changed our voicemail around and locked us out of our own voicemail

1563
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:44,000
and later said on their, oh well, I don't even know where this party is, and basically made it so that no one showed up for the party,

1564
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
and he went and sent our company under.

1565
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
So, fuck you to Cool World and Carl Hills.

1566
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
And Cool World, just because I suck.

1567
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Carl Hills, he says, he just sucks fat dick. That's all it is.

1568
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:02,000
He's got nothing better to do than steal a lot of people's money and have nothing.

1569
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,000
He just sucks. That's fucking it. He sucks.

1570
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Boycott Planet New Year, thank you.

1571
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I was going to ask Yana if she had any XTF Usability.

1572
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Yeah, I just want to say fucking Jamie.

1573
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Not this Jamie, not this Jamie.

1574
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
No. Missed. Missed one.

1575
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Tucky. We call it Tucky.

1576
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Tucky.

1577
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Tucky.

1578
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Nothing comes out of his mouth. When he talks, you hear nothing but Tucky, Tucky, Tucky.

1579
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Tucky, Tucky, yeah.

1580
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,680
Yeah, that's about it. I mean, it's like it's like watching Charlie Brown you

1581
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:45,120
From his mouth is just nothing but thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

1582
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,680
tampon, thank you

1583
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:51,200
Okay, you know, I just don't understand

1584
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:58,880
He's so fucking annoying okay, he's like really hairy

1585
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:06,880
I don't know. It looks like a drag queen that just has too much hair on him. You know, it looks really sad because he has too much hair on him.

1586
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:09,880
I'm trying to figure out what's scarier. Are we coming down to his sheet or his towel?

1587
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:11,880
I think both.

1588
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:13,880
He's scarier than the other.

1589
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:15,880
I think it's the purple towel.

1590
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:18,880
No, what it is is his towel doesn't even fit on him.

1591
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:19,880
Yes.

1592
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:22,880
It's so scary. It's like, dude, don't come out.

1593
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,880
I have to say, at least the sheet covers more.

1594
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:29,880
Okay, and when he takes a bath, it's just beyond the film, okay?

1595
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:32,880
It's just really nasty.

1596
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,880
You're listening to orange lesbian radio.

1597
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:45,880
I don't think none of them, 20 of them, though.

1598
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,880
That would really suck if they did, though.

1599
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:52,880
But anyways, yeah, I like to say fuck you to, uh, yeah, Jamie.

1600
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:57,880
Oh, ok.

1601
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:01,880
And fuck you to Pepsi too!

1602
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:04,880
I hate Pepsi!

1603
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,880
Anything else here?

1604
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:10,880
I covered the Sock or Two Dizzy or Whole Sling thing already for you.

1605
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:13,880
Oh yeah, and never ever trust like the...

1606
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:14,880
What is it?

1607
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,880
The county?

1608
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,880
No, because the county really sucks.

1609
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:26,880
Okay, check this out. I go to the county clinic and I'm just there to get some like, some kind of medicine. Just to get rid of my cold, right?

1610
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,880
And the guy's just like, taking a look at my stomach. He's like, your spleen's falling out.

1611
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,880
He gets another second of pain and he's like, your spleen's falling out.

1612
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:38,880
Oh yeah, and um, fuck you to the doctors who actually decided to do a pregnancy test on Yana after she...

1613
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:43,880
Yes, I am pregnant by my woman's tongue.

1614
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:48,880
After, she told them that she was a virgin and a lesbian, so yeah, um, we're doing March.

1615
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:52,880
Immaculate conception, you never know. Yana could be carrying the baby Jesus. We have to check.

1616
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:53,880
No, Rob, Rob.

1617
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:54,880
I am the next Virgin Mary.

1618
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,880
Rob, Rob, we're doing March.

1619
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:59,880
Yeah, we're...

1620
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:08,880
You know, what, what I'm saying is, it, it really sucks before people just like, they don't have enough, no, no money whatsoever, right?

1621
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:17,880
They go to these planks just to get this freakin' stupid checkup, and they send them to UC Davis where they have no fuckin' money, okay?

1622
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:20,880
I'm the best with a $6,000 fuckin' phone bill!

1623
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:21,880
Not phone bill, but...

1624
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:25,880
If people wonder why I don't go to the doctor anymore unless I'm dying...

1625
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:26,880
Yo...

1626
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:32,880
Well, they told me my spleen was swelled up, so why am I supposed to need to sit there and have a seizure on the cable?

1627
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:37,880
We gotta make sure that Jamie's not carrying the baby Jesus F either, so we gotta give her a pregnancy.

1628
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,880
There ain't nothin' immaculate about me!

1629
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:45,880
Beautiful.

1630
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:46,880
Ding!

1631
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:52,880
Well, if you have that comment, then I don't know how you want it. He's kinda ragnana.

1632
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:55,880
What's that? It's about being immaculate?

1633
01:54:55,880 --> 01:55:01,880
I am a virgin, okay? And it was really hard for him to just do a pelvic exam.

1634
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:07,880
And I mean, it was scary because it sounded like every typical straight guy out there trying to get sex with a woman.

1635
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:14,880
It's going to be easy, it's going to, I'm not going to hurt you, it's just, I'm just going to do this, do that, and you know what?

1636
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,880
It's going to be quick and simple.

1637
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,880
Guys, you know what? I asked her, what's that?

1638
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,880
Maybe you're rich, but you're far from the inoculant.

1639
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:25,880
I'm just going to take this cold hard little tool here.

1640
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:29,880
I sneak it right up inside you.

1641
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:33,880
Guys make the worst gynecologists.

1642
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:37,880
Let me tell you something. When the guy was actually

1643
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:41,880
almost going to do the pelvic exam, right? He was like asking me

1644
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:45,880
I don't know how to do dirty jokes or anything.

1645
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:49,880
Just to make you really calm. But the girl next to me, she's like

1646
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:57,720
I'm like looking at her like, you dumb fuck, what the hell are you doing here?

1647
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:01,720
But then I asked a guy, I was like, you know, I asked him, I said, yeah, I got one joke

1648
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:02,720
for you.

1649
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:05,880
What does a gynecologist and a pizza delivery guy have in common?

1650
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:13,000
They both can smell it, but they can't eat it.

1651
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,640
That joke went in.

1652
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:21,140
all of that you'll just want to show

1653
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,480
i'm speechless

1654
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:25,640
you guys got any of the little rants left to do

1655
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,400
no not really

1656
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:28,520
but you can

1657
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:31,680
but you can

1658
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:35,040
through the kind of work with the packet

1659
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:40,040
that it's a good thing it's a good

1660
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:45,440
I mean, obviously this guy's got more internet access into his mouth than ever.

1661
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:48,440
Well, he's got a mustache to hide all the stretch marks, okay?

1662
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:58,240
If you see any gay guys out there, okay, I am a lesbian. Let you guys know.

1663
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:00,040
My imagination just broke.

1664
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:02,040
I'm sorry.

1665
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:05,440
But no, just to let you guys know, if you ever guys...

1666
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:12,440
If you guys ever go to the basses or anywhere, any gay club, and see some guy with like a

1667
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:19,440
really bad mustache, okay, he's got more stress on you than this bunch of stupid guys.

1668
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:20,440
Okay?

1669
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:21,440
I'm sorry.

1670
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:26,440
But, yeah, anyway, maybe even mustaches for added pleasure.

1671
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:30,440
And with that, we do have to take off because I'm really hungry.

1672
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:34,440
I like how the only thing distinctly Bamani related about this segment is the music playing

1673
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:35,440
is the music playing in the background.

1674
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:36,440
Thank you.

1675
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:37,440
You are so kind.

1676
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:38,440
I can just kiss you, but no, I can't.

1677
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:39,440
Here, lick my chocolate nipple.

1678
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:58,120
Thank you, the official Lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.

1679
01:57:58,120 --> 01:57:59,120
Thank you guys very much for being here.

1680
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:00,120
We appreciate it.

1681
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:01,120
Yes, this crazy one here.

1682
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:06,120
My name is Jonna, and we'll be back soon, just like, you know, put a little bit in my show.

1683
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:10,120
She'll be back next weekend, two drink minimum, don't forget to tip your waitress.

1684
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:11,120
Yeah.

1685
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:12,120
She'll have more jokes.

1686
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:17,120
It will be like the next Howard Stern, you know, but a little bit more better, okay?

1687
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:22,120
Amanda, thank you for being with us, and, uh, wow.

1688
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:27,120
Hi. Or, bye, yes. Time for me to go.

1689
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:33,120
Wait, wait, wait. You know what? I have to say this to all the people that are listening to this.

1690
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:37,120
Okay, don't picture it. Just have it inside your head, okay?

1691
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:40,120
Monkey-fuck-people-ball.

1692
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:43,120
Thank you, dear.

1693
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:45,120
Twitch?

1694
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:52,120
There had to be one big monkey.

1695
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:24,120
Anyway, thank you, my ladies, for being here.

1696
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:26,120
Good night, have a good night.

1697
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:30,120
I can make you copy that, we'll be in touch.

1698
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:33,120
I can't do it right now because we're broadcasting, but I'll get you one later in the week.

1699
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:36,120
Okay. All right, bye. Take care.

1700
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:39,120
All right.

1701
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:41,120
Here we go.

1702
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:43,120
Moving right along.

1703
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:47,120
Oh, did you have any FUs, Jamie?

1704
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:48,120
Um...

1705
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:52,120
I don't know about any more, because she's always got a lot.

1706
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:55,120
Um, um, um...

1707
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:57,120
I'd like you to my strange addiction to dark chocolate.

1708
01:59:57,120 --> 02:00:00,120
Alright, moving on to Loki.

1709
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:02,120
I don't know how to follow that.

1710
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:05,120
I'm not a lesbian, I can't follow that.

1711
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:07,120
Oh well.

1712
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:10,120
Um, Steve, you know my regular refuse of the week.

1713
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:13,120
Uh, stupid drivers, stupid people.

1714
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:15,120
People that talk to me.

1715
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:31,120
People will talk to me that you don't know in person, people who work behind the counters, Golf Land, and Nickel City for not having anything there and making me drive down there to go check it out and there's nothing there.

1716
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:40,120
So that. Yeah, they make you pay $2 to get in. I'm thinking, ooh, there might be an upstairs and an downstairs. Nope, what you see is what you got.

1717
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:41,120
But, it was...

1718
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:45,120
Anyways, so, uh, you have to do that.

1719
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:52,120
You have to do the CDR, uh, East Coast Invasion for thinking that their servers could actually handle people leeching 100 sim files.

1720
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:54,120
Why are you fucking stupid or something?

1721
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:55,120
That's never gonna work.

1722
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:58,120
It never worked last time, but it's not gonna work this time.

1723
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:00,120
So, you have to do them.

1724
02:01:00,120 --> 02:01:03,120
And, that's all I've got for you right now.

1725
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:09,120
I have to do the stupid movie gallery, the store, the chain that I deal with because they're all frickin' southern.

1726
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:11,120
Stupid.

1727
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:14,120
Okay, fine. They're Midwestern and stupid.

1728
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:18,120
Alright, and uh...

1729
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:20,120
Yeah, I know there's too much more than going.

1730
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:22,120
I have to do the stupid Del Taco for...

1731
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:24,120
It makes me feel sick.

1732
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:25,120
Yeah.

1733
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:27,120
That's it.

1734
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:29,120
Alright, moving on to Black Lab.

1735
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:31,120
You feel like you just swallowed a machete?

1736
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:33,120
Yeah.

1737
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:38,120
I thought... This isn't my...

1738
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:53,120
I'm sorry, I forgot Irony. Hold on, I'll find you music. Working on it, working on it, working on it.

1739
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:55,120
Alright, here we go.

1740
02:01:55,120 --> 02:02:02,120
Okay, now that it's on, let's see...

1741
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:10,120
Actually, surprisingly, I have very little to rant about this week because I've actually had a good week.

1742
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:15,120
I got away from school. I got to see my girlfriend for the first time in six months.

1743
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:39,120
I hate the rain, especially when I have to drive in it.

1744
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:46,120
the rain, especially when I have to drive in it. I think I'm coming off my sugar high

1745
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:54,880
now. That sucks. I'll eat dark chocolate, please.

1746
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,680
That's it? You usually email me like ten FUs a week and you come to the station, you get

1747
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:07,480
to be here, be a part of the show experience, you can only come up with two lousy FUs.

1748
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:11,000
you make that jack right

1749
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,920
i'd like to see him cry

1750
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:17,120
that i could pocket for it

1751
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:21,680
that's it

1752
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:23,600
if you don't want to know

1753
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:26,600
yeah i don't think i have anything

1754
02:03:26,600 --> 02:03:27,760
all right

1755
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:29,640
my if you really

1756
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:32,640
i'd like to uh... give a big if you'd my mother

1757
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:34,040
i was at the house today

1758
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:37,720
I was making a payment because we have an insurance plan under both of our names so

1759
02:03:37,720 --> 02:03:41,420
that I get a better rate because I have an accent on my record, they don't.

1760
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:44,920
And I still say, F U, that accent was not my fault.

1761
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:46,440
You were speeding, you son of a bitch.

1762
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:52,580
I don't care if I have the stop sign.

1763
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:55,640
My F U goes to my mom because when I went to make a payment, I get a phone call about

1764
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:56,640
two hours later.

1765
02:03:56,640 --> 02:03:59,700
Did you go through the Christmas presents when you were here?

1766
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:01,400
Somebody shipped a Christmas present!

1767
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:03,440
Somebody shipped it to Christmas and it's all wrong!

1768
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:06,620
No, I did not go through the Christmas presents.

1769
02:04:06,620 --> 02:04:09,580
Are you sure? You're lying to me. Why are you laughing?

1770
02:04:09,580 --> 02:04:13,660
I'm laughing because you're being a dumbass.

1771
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:15,020
Yeah, F you.

1772
02:04:15,020 --> 02:04:18,860
You ask me that every year. Every damn year you ask me if I shake the Christmas presents.

1773
02:04:18,860 --> 02:04:23,500
I don't care. Christmas got old, you know, once I left house. You know, I don't get what I want

1774
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:30,500
anymore. I get clothes.

1775
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:37,500
I don't know why, but for some strange reason, it's like I cannot come up with anything that

1776
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:48,940
I want for Christmas anymore. It's like, why am I not being my usual greedy self? Normally,

1777
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:54,540
I have a list of like twenty things that I would want, which I don't, and well, I don't

1778
02:04:54,540 --> 02:05:06,540
And yet, this year, I come up with, like, two things. And they're things that I would need. It's like, my change in mentality is really upsetting me.

1779
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:18,540
Alright, I got, like, a little smaller for you, because they're a complete more or less. Um, I've ever, okay, I bought, I went out and bought showreels because my girlfriend wants to see them.

1780
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:19,540
Yes.

1781
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:20,540
You should have borrowed it for me.

1782
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:23,940
That's alright, it's only 8 bucks. I really don't, it doesn't matter.

1783
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:29,040
So anyways, so I bought Showgirls, so it's huge, and I wanted to watch it, I don't know why, but whatever.

1784
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:32,840
So we watched it, and I had this urge to go to a strip club.

1785
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:37,440
The thing is, they're so fucking expensive. Why do they have to be so expensive?

1786
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:42,640
We'll go to Centerfolds on a Tuesday night, obviously not this Tuesday or next Thursday, it's the holidays.

1787
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:47,740
Go to Centerfolds on a Tuesday night, it's unlimited drinks, bottomless, for $14.

1788
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:51,240
And if you sit in the front row, you won't have to pay like a dollar or something for the strippers.

1789
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:53,240
It's good. It's a good deal. You take 20 bucks, you have fun on that.

1790
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:55,240
I know, I've just done before.

1791
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:57,240
Yeah, I knew.

1792
02:05:57,240 --> 02:06:00,240
Look, even I go to a strip club, and we all know.

1793
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:04,240
It's just so fucking- I'm talking about lap dances, okay?

1794
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:06,240
Lap dances are fucking expensive.

1795
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:08,240
Two song minimum, that's $40.

1796
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:10,240
I'll get you a lap dance for Christmas.

1797
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:14,240
That's right.

1798
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:19,240
Don't buy a lap, you have to make it.

1799
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:23,240
Cuz they can't, they can't.

1800
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:26,240
You might get crapped that way.

1801
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:29,240
They're not allowed to actually sit on the lap anymore.

1802
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:32,240
In LA, they have touching. Oh yeah.

1803
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:35,240
Oh dear god. I know where I'm getting dragged.

1804
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:50,240
Oh, no, I'm not dragging you nowhere, because it was at this one place that Eric Punkknight on The Snack Spineboards, his cousin, goes there and reaches that place quite a bit. He knows where it's at, I don't know, so... No need for sure, folks.

1805
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:54,240
Okay, back to me again because I'm slow and I'm coming up with things now.

1806
02:06:54,240 --> 02:07:04,240
As for the Tuesday night thing, I hated how good shows always say they leave off in a really suspenseful part like 24 this week.

1807
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:05,240
Yeah, fuck 24.

1808
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:09,240
It's like three weeks on 24. It's like three weeks.

1809
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:10,240
Three weeks.

1810
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:11,240
Three weeks.

1811
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:14,240
Why? Why do they make us wait?

1812
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:19,240
Okay, I'm going to suspense like that for Buffy, but that's because they encountered our cable.

1813
02:07:19,240 --> 02:07:21,240
And I didn't see the last episode of Buffy.

1814
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:23,240
Yes, Buffy recorded.

1815
02:07:23,240 --> 02:07:26,240
I'm not sure. I don't think it's there.

1816
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:28,240
I'm sorry. 21st episode.

1817
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:29,240
Uh-oh.

1818
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:35,240
Okay, first of all, Buffy is the only good writing that happens to be on TV right now.

1819
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:36,240
Unless you count-

1820
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:38,240
Where does writing come into Buffy?

1821
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:40,240
Shut up and let me finish.

1822
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:45,240
Unless you count Angel or Firefly, which are all written by the same guy, okay?

1823
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:47,240
Yes.

1824
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:56,240
It's like sitting and watching a movie every week. Good writing makes a good show.

1825
02:07:56,240 --> 02:07:59,240
You know, Firefly looked like a live-action version of Cowboy Bebop.

1826
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:00,240
A lot with good acting.

1827
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:03,240
Well, not Cowboy Bebop, but Outlaw Star.

1828
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:06,240
I only watched, like, part of the first episode of Outlaw Star.

1829
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:08,240
Well, 24 is the better because...

1830
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:12,240
24 is unique, and it has Kiefer still in it.

1831
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:18,240
The Kiefer's still hot to this day, but I'd still have to go with Bucky. I'm sorry.

1832
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:26,240
No, but actually, I find it funny because, uh, I actually, uh, the Kiefer Southern looks, like, better than Bucky.

1833
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:29,240
Just, I mean, what's your name? Sarah Michelle Gellar?

1834
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:30,240
Okay, but, but...

1835
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:34,240
Like, here's Bucky, er, here's Sarah Michelle Gellar, and here's Kiefer Southern.

1836
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:37,240
But did Kiefer ever do Rocky? Aha, no.

1837
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:39,240
Or do I care?

1838
02:08:39,240 --> 02:08:41,240
I did.

1839
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:45,240
Moving right along, this debate won't end if I don't end it now.

1840
02:08:45,240 --> 02:08:49,240
24! 24! 24! I'm sending subliminal messages!

1841
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:51,240
24! 24!

1842
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:53,240
Don't make me smack your ass!

1843
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:54,240
You will watch, 24!

1844
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:56,240
I'm still toting boots right now!

1845
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:58,240
Think about it, isn't Buffy on at 8?

1846
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:00,240
No.

1847
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:04,240
They are on at the same time, my bad.

1848
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:05,240
Alright, anyway.

1849
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:06,240
If you're watching 24.

1850
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:08,240
Watch him take one, watch the other, Jesus.

1851
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:10,240
Alright, here we go.

1852
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:13,240
Uh, do I have any FUs left?

1853
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:15,240
I don't think I do. You're right, I don't.

1854
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:19,240
We're gonna, we're so gonna end this show.

1855
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:22,240
No, Jamie, you're starting to steal the microphone!

1856
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:24,240
We have a fight, a fight just broke out.

1857
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:28,240
God, this has been, this has been the Jerry Springer episode of Oregon's Radio.

1858
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:32,240
We've had lesbians, we've had a fight break out.

1859
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:36,240
I've got, I've got the sound samples, I've got TV.

1860
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:38,240
It's gonna be about, ah!

1861
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,240
Alright, alright, alright. Ah, jeez, now Panda's getting thrown.

1862
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:46,240
Alright.

1863
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:50,240
Can I, can I, can I do the chat room entries now?

1864
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:54,240
Moving right along.

1865
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:58,240
DSTSS SoCalKick says

1866
02:09:58,240 --> 02:10:02,240
Over limit and being $145 total bill

1867
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:06,240
is my F.U.

1868
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:09,240
I don't know what he meant. Oh, credit card? Oh.

1869
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:10,240
Credit card, right?

1870
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:14,240
I have no idea. If he means, like, his bandwidth or credit card or what, I must have missed it.

1871
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:21,240
But he also says, Merry fucking Christmas. I have a broken digital camera and a paid-off cell phone bill along with hair beads and bleach costs.

1872
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:26,240
He must have said, oh, he's pissed at me now because I didn't know what it was.

1873
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:30,240
Ah, that's it. If you're going to yell at me, I'm saving you for last.

1874
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:41,240
Alright, Stresa says he wants to throw out a huge F.U. to his dad for telling mom that he's only going to put $150 into Christmas, and he found out that Woody's applying that $150.

1875
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:45,240
He's putting that cash in his circulation to fix the sink that he broke at least six months ago.

1876
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:50,240
He should be fixing the sink because it needs to be fixed, not do it as a fucking Christmas gift to mom.

1877
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:52,240
Hmm. Interesting.

1878
02:10:55,240 --> 02:10:57,240
That's a lame Christmas money.

1879
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:02,240
23rd Magus says, I have a big bah humbug or a fuck you to the Christmas season.

1880
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:05,240
Christmas sucks when you're broke.

1881
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:07,240
Bork the whole fucking season.

1882
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:09,240
He put bork.

1883
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:10,240
Maybe he meant pork, I don't know.

1884
02:11:10,240 --> 02:11:13,240
A very accomplished fuck you to Matsuri Japan, I beat you bitch.

1885
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:16,240
Wahaha, cough, okay, out.

1886
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:25,240
The pizza delivery boy and the bandicologist are also hot and to your door in three minutes.

1887
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:34,240
Angel says, F you to the Max 2 machine at Rona Mark Scandia because it stopped taking tokens today. Bad DDR machine.

1888
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:43,240
Come visit our neck of the woods. You'll have some real inks built up in you. Don't worry.

1889
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:51,240
Doc Tetsuya says, F you to himself for not waiting for Max USA to save before switching games.

1890
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:54,240
Shouldn't you save that privately?

1891
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,240
What?

1892
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:56,240
Okay.

1893
02:11:58,240 --> 02:11:59,240
Anyway, next question.

1894
02:11:59,240 --> 02:12:00,240
Okay, I don't...

1895
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:01,240
Good.

1896
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:02,240
I must have missed something.

1897
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:03,240
Good.

1898
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:10,240
Let's go to Brak2000 says, F you to missing the first half of the show since some people came over to try out DDR.

1899
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:14,240
Even though it was a good night for me and I was passing 7-footers, which is a big improvement for me.

1900
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:15,240
Good word.

1901
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:23,240
If anyone wants to know what to give me for Christmas next year, pick up the December 2002 maximum issue, it's page 78. I think you'll be very up.

1902
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:26,240
Is that the bottom of the page?

1903
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:29,240
Fuck the bottom of the page, is that the top of the fucking page?

1904
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:30,240
May I do Vidpower's FUs now?

1905
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:31,240
Yeah.

1906
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:33,240
Okay, Vidpower says,

1907
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:37,240
I'm actually a happy bunny this week, I don't really have any FUs. No FUs for you!

1908
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:48,040
I'm the F U Nazi. Fair enough. Did you hear that? Vidpow says, no FUs for you. He's the

1909
02:12:48,040 --> 02:12:52,520
F U Nazi. I was looking at the email, no we do not have anybody email. I'm checking the

1910
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:58,880
last ones that just came in. Our bestest friend in the whole wide world, Quinn, says F U to

1911
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:04,440
getting something that someone else got you for Christmas three days before Christmas.

1912
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:19,720
getting something that someone else like a fruitcake like herpes all right uh 23

1913
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:24,080
maggots yes he said for as in fuck is it screw is an asteroid with 2d x

1914
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:29,680
controller I've never heard the word board used for that before that's

1915
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:33,520
amazing actually the word the word four point ever

1916
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:40,360
port but only one person I know that's the way he's not okay

1917
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:43,760
people at real ultimate power not yet remember they teach they say that real

1918
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:44,960
ninja pork sausage

1919
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:48,480
well they only go on their guitars

1920
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:51,920
and decapitating their mom wow because remember

1921
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:57,440
their power is so great it kicks your mom right in the face

1922
02:13:57,440 --> 02:13:59,440
Ow.

1923
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:05,440
Remember, 9 out of 10 winners get their heads cut off by real ninjas.

1924
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:10,440
Twins adding an explanation so we don't keep calling him Herbie Man or whatever we were saying.

1925
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:16,440
Explanation, lives with mom, but dad got him a DVD box set yesterday, the Back to the Future box set,

1926
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:20,440
that his grandma on the other side of the family already got him.

1927
02:14:20,440 --> 02:14:23,440
So, that's why you asked for a seat.

1928
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:26,440
You asked for a seat, take it back.

1929
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:28,440
Amen. Get something you really want.

1930
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:32,440
That is the official Orange Lounge advice of the day.

1931
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:34,440
By the way, do take care of this, though.

1932
02:14:34,440 --> 02:14:36,440
One of the presents for getting prepared.

1933
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:37,440
Word.

1934
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:39,440
Uh, you have another one, Logie?

1935
02:14:40,440 --> 02:14:41,440
Oh, okay, cool.

1936
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:43,440
All right, we're gonna end the FUs of the Week.

1937
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:45,440
That's it. Nail in the coffin. Segment's done.

1938
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:47,440
It is already 8.50.

1939
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:49,440
We're damn near close to the end of the show already,

1940
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:50,440
and you know what we gotta do?

1941
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:51,440
You know what we still gotta do?

1942
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:52,440
Listless.

1943
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:54,440
We gotta do listless, and we gotta do the cage match.

1944
02:14:54,440 --> 02:14:55,440
We gotta do them both.

1945
02:14:55,440 --> 02:15:05,440
Let's take the opportunity during Cage Match to get our stuff ready for List List.

1946
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:08,440
So tonight's List List, Jamie, tell us about tonight's List List.

1947
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:13,440
Best Benmani song released this year, 2002.

1948
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:16,440
SoCalKicks says I forgot one of his.

1949
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:17,440
I thought I got them all.

1950
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:18,440
I closed your window, SoCal.

1951
02:15:18,440 --> 02:15:19,440
I'm sorry.

1952
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:20,440
Send it again.

1953
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:21,440
I'll read it.

1954
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:23,440
I thought I got it.

1955
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:27,440
My bad.

1956
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:31,280
Alright, so we're going to do the cage match while we prepare our list. We're going to do

1957
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:35,960
Best Bamani Song Least in 2002, so it can't be old school. It has to be new school.

1958
02:15:35,960 --> 02:15:40,440
We're talking Max II, 8th and 7th style, I believe. 7th style was early this year.

1959
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:46,000
Guitar Freaks.

1960
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,840
So, any of those games you can pick for Best Bamani Song of 2002.

1961
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:53,960
Because next week on the show, Jamie, what's gonna happen next week on the show?

1962
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:55,120
We ain't gonna be here.

1963
02:15:55,120 --> 02:15:59,360
We ain't gonna be here. We're still sort of debating, I guess, what we're gonna do. We might do a

1964
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:00,000
Best Of.

1965
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,600
Someone's cable might be working, namely me.

1966
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:06,640
We'll surprise everybody.

1967
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:09,920
So there's gonna be one of two things happening. There's gonna be a Best Of show or you're gonna get

1968
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:11,120
the Jamie experience.

1969
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:15,040
Yeah. And we're playing all Eurobeat and TAC.

1970
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:18,160
So deal with it!

1971
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:22,160
And I will accept yes.

1972
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:50,160
We take less breaks and do more talking.

1973
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:54,160
Okay, let's get into it.

1974
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:11,160
Last week on the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had a winner for two weeks in a row.

1975
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:14,160
This song was the victor of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1976
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,160
Because I'm fucking cool.

1977
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:17,160
Because you are fucking cool.

1978
02:17:17,160 --> 02:17:19,360
The winner of the Orange Launch Cage match was...

1979
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:21,160
Jamie, tell us about it, because it was your submission.

1980
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:24,160
It was... this is... by the way, it's not Happy Hardcore, it's just labeled.

1981
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:25,160
Okay, yeah.

1982
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:29,660
Um, but it is the, uh, techno-style remix of the Knight Rider theme.

1983
02:17:29,660 --> 02:17:33,660
I remember being in the third grade and drawing pictures of Kit in the middle of class.

1984
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:36,660
Because I thought the part was cool. I hated it because I was off.

1985
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:39,160
Oh! Dang, okay.

1986
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:42,160
I got the real F.U. from SoCal Kicks, and it's huge.

1987
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:42,660
Okay.

1988
02:17:42,660 --> 02:17:44,160
I don't know how I missed this.

1989
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:45,160
How did I miss that?

1990
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:47,300
Anyway, okay, wait, we'll go back to FU for a sec.

1991
02:17:47,300 --> 02:17:49,960
FU to the lousy as hell goodbye party Kendra had.

1992
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:52,640
Much love to you and your leaving to Japan, but that party sucked.

1993
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:56,360
FU Jackie for still playing games with me and not being sure if things are gonna happen

1994
02:17:56,360 --> 02:17:57,360
or not.

1995
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:59,800
FU CyberPixels and not having auto shell access.

1996
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:03,480
Fuck you Pearl for needing shell access and not being able to get PHP image gallery thumbnail

1997
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:04,600
or script to work.

1998
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:06,920
Fuck you Metroid Prime for its vague artifact clues.

1999
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:10,180
Fuck you Ruben for the whole camera deal, even though we got it settled and now I now

2000
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:15,480
I'll have a new digicam and FU cell phone service for only being 200 minutes and me going 463 minutes

2001
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:19,340
All right, we're done. No more FUs. Oh, yes

2002
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:25,660
So here it is. There's a clip of last week's winner the Knight Rider theme song because Jamie says kid is hot

2003
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:31,400
The car was fucking amazing. I I still want to get that car

2004
02:18:31,400 --> 02:18:38,400
Alright, here we go. Here's last week's winner.

2005
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:57,800
Alright, Jamie's hoping to make this one three victories in a row, but it's gonna...

2006
02:18:57,800 --> 02:18:59,300
And if you love me, you'll vote for it.

2007
02:18:59,300 --> 02:19:03,300
It's gonna have to win, and Chat Room, you guys will have the final vote.

2008
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:06,300
Now, we don't play that whole song because it did win the last couple weeks,

2009
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:09,300
so we kind of give it a little bit of a disadvantage.

2010
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:12,300
But you guys are familiar with it because you listen to the show every week, don't you?

2011
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:15,300
But you guys can vote for either that, or you can vote for one of the two new songs.

2012
02:19:15,300 --> 02:19:18,800
I'm gonna go ahead and do my entry first, then we'll get to Loki's entry.

2013
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:24,800
My pick for this week is going to be a popular artist, Ayumi Hamasaki.

2014
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,800
A lot of you seem to dig her.

2015
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:29,960
And I've got a trance remix of the song, Connected.

2016
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:32,080
This is going to be my entry for this week.

2017
02:19:32,080 --> 02:19:36,440
And I like this song because the video reminds me of Bjork, if you've ever seen this video.

2018
02:19:36,440 --> 02:19:37,440
It's pretty cool.

2019
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:38,440
It's very Bjork-esque.

2020
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:39,440
Actually, I don't have it.

2021
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:40,440
Brad does.

2022
02:19:40,440 --> 02:19:42,560
Our friend Brad here at Wriggle on the show, he has it.

2023
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:44,040
But this is going to be it.

2024
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:46,760
So here's our first entry in the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

2025
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:48,940
This is Sayumi Hamasaki with a trance remix.

2026
02:19:48,940 --> 02:19:53,000
I'm not sure of the remix name, but it's called Connected.

2027
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,000
So here, enjoy.

2028
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:36,580
Mi te mette, mi te mette, mi te sele te iru Te mo mi akete, mi kekete, mi kurepe iru

2029
02:22:06,580 --> 02:22:10,580
Me too can't take, me too damn it.

2030
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:14,580
Me too made it, me too made it.

2031
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:17,580
Me too so what do you do?

2032
02:22:17,580 --> 02:22:24,580
Tell me I can't take, me too can't take, me too damn it.

2033
02:22:24,580 --> 02:22:31,580
I'm not leaving you, me too whatever, me too whatever.

2034
02:23:01,580 --> 02:23:02,580
Hello!

2035
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:03,580
Hey, we're back!

2036
02:23:03,580 --> 02:23:04,580
Hey, how'd you like that one?

2037
02:23:04,580 --> 02:23:18,220
That was Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, the latest entry into the Orange Lounge Cage match,

2038
02:23:18,220 --> 02:23:23,140
where the winning song, voted by you in the chatroom, gets put into regular rotation on

2039
02:23:23,140 --> 02:23:25,180
Orange Lounge Radio for the next week.

2040
02:23:25,180 --> 02:23:28,140
So, last week's winner was Knight Rider, you can vote for that.

2041
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:32,740
This week we have Yumi Hamasaki with Connected, or, lowkey, what's the next track?

2042
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:35,900
Um, the next track is going to be from the wonderful...

2043
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:38,860
Wait, I'm sorry, I have to interrupt you because we didn't get feedback on the Yumi Hamasaki.

2044
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:40,380
Sorry, we have to do the feedback part.

2045
02:23:40,380 --> 02:23:42,060
Jamie, what did you think of that one?

2046
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:46,340
I like how you made the best one because it was more repetitive, and I'd have to say...

2047
02:23:46,340 --> 02:23:49,340
Honey, Black Lab.

2048
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:53,860
Um, a little bit of that, I didn't hear it because I went to the bathroom real quick.

2049
02:23:53,860 --> 02:23:55,180
uh...

2050
02:23:55,180 --> 02:23:59,180
that was a great like

2051
02:23:59,180 --> 02:24:02,180
uh...

2052
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:07,540
uh...

2053
02:24:07,540 --> 02:24:09,420
i'll look at that

2054
02:24:09,420 --> 02:24:10,140
uh...

2055
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:12,700
i'm going to go ahead and get it i'm actually not going to have it is headed

2056
02:24:12,700 --> 02:24:15,780
to go with my own head i'm going to give it about me too i do like to talk to

2057
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:17,300
people of your kids

2058
02:24:17,300 --> 02:24:19,980
uh... it is a little bit

2059
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:22,860
and uh... i hope it's a problem

2060
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:27,860
I hope that the chat room gets their way, whatever they play.

2061
02:24:27,860 --> 02:24:30,860
Alright, now Loki, I'm sorry, you can do your...

2062
02:24:30,860 --> 02:24:38,860
Alright, now this is going to become a trainer because I forget which track is on the CD, but what it is, is it's actually a song from the...

2063
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:42,860
Well, not really a hit movie, but it's a cool movie, Run Lola Run.

2064
02:24:42,860 --> 02:24:49,860
This is Believe by Franca Potente, you also might have seen her in Resident Evil, she was the main character.

2065
02:24:49,860 --> 02:24:51,860
Actor and singer.

2066
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:55,140
Now this, oh this is going to be cool because I like running all around. Let's hear this.

2067
02:24:55,140 --> 02:24:55,640
Alright.

2068
02:24:55,640 --> 02:25:01,140
But now I have to intro this. This, um, the sample you're in here are actually the whole, uh, song.

2069
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:06,140
It's got part of another song in the beginning of it because this is on one of my mix CDs that I actually mixed together.

2070
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:12,340
So, it, it doesn't cut off anything in the song because the song begins with dialogue in German, so it doesn't really matter, but...

2071
02:25:12,340 --> 02:25:14,440
Okay, we're going to make sure this is the right one, okay?

2072
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:14,940
Yeah.

2073
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:15,740
Here we go, here we go.

2074
02:25:15,740 --> 02:25:22,740
I don't believe in trouble. I don't believe in love.

2075
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:49,500
I don't believe there's nothing left but running here again

2076
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:52,900
I don't believe in promise, I don't believe in chance

2077
02:25:52,900 --> 02:25:56,360
I don't believe you can resist the things that make you so

2078
02:25:56,360 --> 02:25:59,760
I don't believe in silence, for silence it feels low

2079
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:02,940
I don't believe in energy, the tension is too low

2080
02:26:02,940 --> 02:26:06,440
I don't believe in panic, I don't believe in fear

2081
02:26:06,440 --> 02:26:10,440
I don't believe in prophecy, so don't waste any tears

2082
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:27,440
I don't believe reality would be the way it should

2083
02:26:27,440 --> 02:26:30,440
But I believe in fantasy if you just understood

2084
02:26:30,440 --> 02:26:34,440
I don't believe in history, I don't believe in truth

2085
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:37,440
But don't believe justice to me, it's not an issue of use

2086
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:18,440
I don't believe there's nothing left of running here again

2087
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:29,440
I don't believe you promise, I don't believe you chance

2088
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:32,440
Adopting the energy, the temperature is too low

2089
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:35,440
Adopting the energy, the energy is here

2090
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:39,440
I don't give a fuck about this and it's still so close to my face

2091
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:02,440
God, God

2092
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:07,440
And while I am in this place, I will not be able to find you

2093
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:17,440
And I just can't tell you how many times you've gone, gone, gone

2094
02:28:17,440 --> 02:28:20,440
Drop my skills, drop it, drop it, let's do it, let's go

2095
02:28:47,440 --> 02:29:05,240
I wonder what you got, got, what you need, I'm fine, fine

2096
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:06,740
Can I get a sentence?

2097
02:29:06,740 --> 02:29:08,540
I'm not the one that really liked it

2098
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:10,740
I'm just too young to tell you better

2099
02:29:10,740 --> 02:29:13,340
I'm not the one that really liked it

2100
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:14,340
I'm just too young to tell you better

2101
02:29:44,340 --> 02:30:13,100
All right, that was the end of that one because that was part of a kind of a Megamix CD.

2102
02:30:13,100 --> 02:30:17,580
So, there you have it. Your three entries for this week's Cage Match. You have Knight

2103
02:30:17,580 --> 02:30:21,820
Rider, last week's victor, two weeks in a row. Ayumi Hamasaki with Connected, and that

2104
02:30:21,820 --> 02:30:25,820
track was Believe. What'd you think of Believe, Jamie?

2105
02:30:25,820 --> 02:30:34,820
Um, I think it would've put me to sleep, had I gotten to do it. Um, I think it was a good

2106
02:30:34,820 --> 02:30:37,820
one. Seven. Seven for Jamie. Black Lab.

2107
02:30:37,820 --> 02:30:43,820
I'd kind of like to be gay, but then it kind of starts over with a little bit of a cut to the end.

2108
02:30:43,820 --> 02:30:48,820
But, I'll just kind of keep going, give it an eight and a half.

2109
02:30:48,820 --> 02:30:50,820
Eight and a half, Loki.

2110
02:30:50,820 --> 02:30:58,820
I like that song, because I like that movie. The movie is really sweet, and every time I hear that song it makes me think of the movie, so I'll give it a ten.

2111
02:30:58,820 --> 02:31:04,820
Alright, I do like that song, it was cool. I agree with Black Lab, it started off better than it ended.

2112
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:07,820
It was a little, I thought it was more repetitive than the Yumi track.

2113
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:11,820
But it does remind me of Run Little Run which kicked a lot of ass, so I'm gonna give that one an 8 as well.

2114
02:31:11,820 --> 02:31:18,820
So, that was Believe. So now you can send your votes to us right now in the chat room.

2115
02:31:18,820 --> 02:31:24,820
Just private message them to me, you can vote for Knight Rider, Connected, or Believe.

2116
02:31:24,820 --> 02:31:27,820
And we will count up your votes during this next break.

2117
02:31:27,820 --> 02:31:32,820
If they don't vote for Knight Rider, David Hasselhoff will cry.

2118
02:31:57,820 --> 02:32:06,140
list before the show's over so uh join us we'll be right back eventually unless we take a nap

2119
02:32:06,140 --> 02:32:08,100
I give up?

2120
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:12,240
It's all about the Andes Indias, baby

2121
02:32:22,300 --> 02:32:24,120
Uh huh, feel

2122
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:26,320
Uh huh, feel

2123
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:29,260
All about Emilia

2124
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:32,140
All about Emilia

2125
02:32:32,140 --> 02:32:41,140
What you wanna do? Wanna be hackers? Cold crackers, slackers? Wasting time with all the chap who yakkers?

2126
02:32:41,140 --> 02:32:46,140
Nine to five, chillin' at new detectors? Workin' at a desk with a dumb little placard?

2127
02:32:46,140 --> 02:32:49,140
Yeah, bein' the bills with my mass programming skills?

2128
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:54,140
Yeah, I'm fraggin' my hard drive for thrills. I got me a hundred gigabytes around.

2129
02:32:54,140 --> 02:32:59,140
I never beat trolls and I don't reach them. Install the two online in my house.

2130
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:02,140
Always at my PC, double clickin' on my Ms. House

2131
02:33:02,140 --> 02:33:05,140
Upgrade my system, at least twice a day I'm frickin' plug and play

2132
02:33:05,140 --> 02:33:08,140
I ain't afraid of YTK, I'm down to build gates

2133
02:33:08,140 --> 02:33:11,140
I call em' money for sure, phone em' up at home

2134
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:14,140
Man, I make em' do my tech support, it's all about the opinions

2135
02:33:14,140 --> 02:33:17,140
You gotta be the dumbest dudey I've ever seen

2136
02:33:17,140 --> 02:33:20,140
You've got Wyatt out all over your screen

2137
02:33:20,140 --> 02:33:23,140
You think your Commodore 64 is really neato

2138
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:25,140
What kind of chip you got in there, a Dorito?

2139
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:28,140
You're usin' a 286, don't make me laugh

2140
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:30,640
Your window boots up and what a day and a half

2141
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:34,140
You can back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette

2142
02:33:34,140 --> 02:33:36,140
You're the biggest joke on the internet

2143
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:38,140
Your database is a disaster

2144
02:33:38,140 --> 02:33:41,140
Your wax and your modem tryin' to make it go faster

2145
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:44,140
Hey fella, I bet you're still living in your parents' cellar

2146
02:33:44,140 --> 02:33:46,640
Downloading pictures of Sarah Michelle Gellar

2147
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:49,140
And posting me too like some brain-dead AOL-er

2148
02:33:49,140 --> 02:33:51,640
I should do the world a favor and cast you like Old Yeller

2149
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:54,640
Your just about as useless as jpegs to Helen Keller

2150
02:33:54,640 --> 02:34:10,040
My new computer's got the cards that rock, but it was obsolete before I opened the box.

2151
02:34:10,040 --> 02:34:13,040
You say you've had your desktop for over a week?

2152
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:15,040
Throw that junk away, man, it's an antique.

2153
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:17,040
Your laptop is a month old?

2154
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:21,040
Well, that's great, if you could use a nice, heavy, and paper weight.

2155
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:24,040
My digital media is right protection.

2156
02:34:24,040 --> 02:34:26,840
Every file inspected, no virus is detected

2157
02:34:26,840 --> 02:34:29,340
I beta tested every operating system

2158
02:34:29,340 --> 02:34:32,040
Gave props to some and others I dissed them

2159
02:34:32,040 --> 02:34:34,640
While your computer crashes, mine's multitasking

2160
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:37,140
It does all my work without me even asking

2161
02:34:37,140 --> 02:34:39,740
Got a black screen monitor, 40 inches wide

2162
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:42,340
I believe that your test and your sketch on the side

2163
02:34:42,340 --> 02:34:45,140
In a 32-bit world, you're a 2-bit user

2164
02:34:45,140 --> 02:34:47,740
You've got your own news crew, own total loser

2165
02:34:47,740 --> 02:34:50,240
Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax

2166
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:53,140
Once you get your CPU in a box or cracker jack

2167
02:34:53,140 --> 02:34:55,640
Pray me I'm lying well you know that I'll beat you

2168
02:34:55,640 --> 02:34:58,160
If I ever meet you I'll control, I'll lead you

2169
02:34:58,160 --> 02:35:00,020
What, what

2170
02:35:00,020 --> 02:35:17,320
What better

2171
02:35:17,320 --> 02:35:20,160
Than fooling anyone else

2172
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:27,160
Jamie, do another spur of the moment promo for us, please.

2173
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:32,160
If you don't listen to Orange Lounge Radio, you're a fucking loser.

2174
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:35,160
Alright, we're back. Thank you for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2175
02:35:35,160 --> 02:35:39,160
Unfortunately, we just had a DSL lapse right there. I don't know what happened.

2176
02:35:39,160 --> 02:35:44,160
Suddenly, I lost. I was wondering, why hasn't the chatroom said anything for the past two minutes?

2177
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:52,160
And we just dropped stream, unfortunately, and you guys all got dropped to come back, but our bus has gone down a little bit.

2178
02:35:52,160 --> 02:35:56,160
Go figure. Go figure. I don't know. That was weird.

2179
02:35:56,160 --> 02:36:00,160
I apologize to Chat Room. 25 shows and that's never happened to us, though.

2180
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:03,160
On Understation Live, that used to happen every other week.

2181
02:36:03,160 --> 02:36:05,160
I've been there for that a couple of weeks.

2182
02:36:05,160 --> 02:36:11,160
Yeah, so I apologize to you guys. Just reconnect. We should be back now.

2183
02:36:11,160 --> 02:36:17,480
and I'm taking the last votes. I may have missed some of your votes. I may have missed

2184
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:24,040
some of your votes for... did I count that one already? I think I did. I just got one

2185
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:29,160
last vote. This is interesting now because since I had a lap stare, I got some last-minute

2186
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:32,640
votes for the cage match, and that's caused it to have a tie.

2187
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:33,640
Damn you.

2188
02:36:33,640 --> 02:36:34,640
Fight my ass.

2189
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:38,600
Fight my ass. So wait a minute, this is very interesting.

2190
02:36:38,600 --> 02:36:42,960
We have a tie now. Both edged out Knight Rider by one

2191
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:47,760
vote each. Die. Connected has three votes, Believe has three votes. We've never had a

2192
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:49,040
tie. I get to break the tie.

2193
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:52,520
On this show. No. No, the way the tie is going to be broken is now

2194
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:56,560
we collectively here get to break the tie. We're gonna add votes one at a time

2195
02:36:56,560 --> 02:37:01,360
between... All four of us. All four of us. So we might tie again and then in that case we'll have to

2196
02:37:01,360 --> 02:37:03,360
get the people who voted for Knight Rider to re-vote.

2197
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:05,360
I think we should just do Rock, Paper, Scissors.

2198
02:37:05,360 --> 02:37:08,360
Yes, in that case, if we tie again, we're going to do Rock, Paper, Scissors.

2199
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:10,360
But let's see, we're going to add votes here in the room.

2200
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:12,360
So this is between Connected and Believe.

2201
02:37:12,360 --> 02:37:13,360
You're going to vote for your own song.

2202
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:14,360
You're going to let Jamie pick?

2203
02:37:16,360 --> 02:37:18,360
Because Black Lab wants to vote too.

2204
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:21,360
Okay, well we'll assume that Loki and I each vote for the songs we put in.

2205
02:37:21,360 --> 02:37:23,360
So we cancel each other out.

2206
02:37:23,360 --> 02:37:25,360
So, Jamie?

2207
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:29,360
How about this?

2208
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:31,360
I vote for Knight Rider.

2209
02:37:31,360 --> 02:37:33,360
You pulled the point.

2210
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:38,360
Okay, you write down your answer on a piece of paper, you write down your answer on a piece of paper, then we do it.

2211
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:41,360
Because otherwise we don't want one person's answer askew in the other.

2212
02:37:41,360 --> 02:37:45,360
We don't want you to intentionally fucking it up.

2213
02:37:45,360 --> 02:37:49,360
How am I going to fuck this up?

2214
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:54,360
Alright, I did get the last two votes came in right after that lapse

2215
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:59,360
from people who hadn't voted yet. I got the rest of your votes, I'm pretty sure.

2216
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:03,360
So, here we go.

2217
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:07,360
Okay, you got your written down, Black Lab? Okay.

2218
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:12,360
Let's see Jamie's. Oh, Black Lab's got one vote there.

2219
02:38:12,360 --> 02:38:17,360
And guess what, ladies and gentlemen, we have another tie.

2220
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:21,360
Nope, nope. This is rock, paper, scissors time, junkin' between myself and Loki.

2221
02:38:21,360 --> 02:38:25,360
Here we go. Ready? Here we go, here we go, here we go.

2222
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:29,060
Ready? One, two, three. Oh!

2223
02:38:29,060 --> 02:38:32,460
Scissors, cuts, paper, and connected wins.

2224
02:38:32,460 --> 02:38:36,960
Very close, though. Very close. That means next week I have to pick a song that's going to last another two weeks.

2225
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:41,560
Yep, that means Jamie. But Jamie, you do have the longest rankings, really, because that holiday show we had there, too,

2226
02:38:41,560 --> 02:38:44,960
or those week we didn't do it, it was three weeks.

2227
02:38:44,960 --> 02:38:51,600
All right, so connected wins the cage match by by by a hair literally so

2228
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:55,120
There it is

2229
02:38:55,560 --> 02:38:57,640
Okay, now we're gonna go right into listless

2230
02:38:59,140 --> 02:39:04,200
We got to hurry up and do this segment because we're almost out of time, but we're gonna do listless tonight

2231
02:39:04,200 --> 02:39:09,080
So I got to clear out all these windows Jamie. Tell them about tonight's listless. Um, this listless is gonna be

2232
02:39:09,880 --> 02:39:11,280
the best

2233
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:15,040
Bemani song that was released in 2002

2234
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:18,960
which is going to be Guitar Freak's 8th mix

2235
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:20,760
Drummania's 7th

2236
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:22,720
Bemania the final

2237
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:26,040
2DX's 7th came out

2238
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:29,280
yeah 7th came out this year

2239
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:32,240
yeah it was early this year

2240
02:39:32,240 --> 02:39:33,640
8th style

2241
02:39:33,640 --> 02:39:36,040
and Max 2

2242
02:39:36,040 --> 02:39:39,920
okay so all those things, also guitar

2243
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:42,040
Max U.S.A? Yeah, Max U.S.A.

2244
02:39:42,040 --> 02:39:43,560
GuitarFreak's uh...

2245
02:39:43,560 --> 02:39:44,720
I already named it.

2246
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:48,840
I forgot about Max U.S.A. That might actually change my list a little bit.

2247
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:53,600
Although you probably put the song I'm thinking of.

2248
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:57,160
I forgot about Max U.S.A. That's a good one.

2249
02:39:57,160 --> 02:39:58,480
Uh...

2250
02:39:58,480 --> 02:40:01,920
You also...GuitarFreak's seventh mix would count too.

2251
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:04,880
As well as Beatmania's seventh mix, I believe.

2252
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:08,800
Which is also being mentioned to me that Beatmania...

2253
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:12,320
BeatMania 3 in the final as well, which is being mentioned to me also, by the way, to

2254
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:15,880
remind everybody that it's coming out on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.

2255
02:40:15,880 --> 02:40:20,240
Well, not DDR Extreme, but BeatMania 7th for the home system.

2256
02:40:20,240 --> 02:40:23,440
Is it the final or is it 7th?

2257
02:40:23,440 --> 02:40:24,440
It's coming out for the home system.

2258
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:26,000
Yeah, final is going to be next year.

2259
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,360
All right, so here we go.

2260
02:40:28,360 --> 02:40:34,240
Best Bae Money song of 2002, Jamie, or we always start with Jamie.

2261
02:40:34,240 --> 02:40:35,720
We'll start with Black Lab tonight.

2262
02:40:35,720 --> 02:40:38,040
We're going to start with Black Lab tonight.

2263
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:47,320
Okay, starting off with my number three, I listened to it, I kind of liked athletic songs

2264
02:40:47,320 --> 02:40:54,480
before, just like from like beat stage, fifth, sixth, so he was two, but what I heard when

2265
02:40:54,480 --> 02:41:01,200
they finally made the move to seven key in eighth style, the War Game was one of my favorites

2266
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:02,200
now.

2267
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:03,200
Huh?

2268
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:04,960
That's my number three.

2269
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:07,960
Your game is his number three choice.

2270
02:41:07,960 --> 02:41:08,960
Loki!

2271
02:41:08,960 --> 02:41:09,960
Okay.

2272
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:14,960
Um, it's one of my favorite songs on BeatMania 2DX and I made a sim file for it.

2273
02:41:14,960 --> 02:41:16,320
The sound of goodbye.

2274
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:17,800
The sound of goodbye.

2275
02:41:17,800 --> 02:41:21,280
That's a good song.

2276
02:41:21,280 --> 02:41:22,280
Jamie!

2277
02:41:22,280 --> 02:41:23,280
What's your number three pick?

2278
02:41:23,280 --> 02:41:24,280
Guideca.

2279
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:25,280
Guideca!

2280
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:27,280
Did I smell it right?

2281
02:41:27,280 --> 02:41:28,280
Yes?

2282
02:41:28,280 --> 02:41:29,280
Uh, yeah.

2283
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:30,280
Okay.

2284
02:41:30,280 --> 02:41:31,280
I think it's two Cs.

2285
02:41:31,280 --> 02:41:32,280
Two Cs.

2286
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:33,280
I did put two Cs, yes.

2287
02:41:33,280 --> 02:41:34,280
Is it Guideca or Guideca or...

2288
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:36,720
my dad

2289
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:37,880
okay my bad

2290
02:41:37,880 --> 02:41:42,020
my number three pick uh... was also the sound of goodbye i also put that as my

2291
02:41:42,020 --> 02:41:43,140
number three pick

2292
02:41:43,140 --> 02:41:45,120
pick something different um...

2293
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:48,080
i'm afraid that you're

2294
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:50,500
is here you go how about uh... you leave me alone

2295
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:54,980
i'll be funny was let's talk about that you leave me alone

2296
02:41:54,980 --> 02:41:58,620
from uh... max you say

2297
02:41:58,620 --> 02:42:03,600
i'd never have an alternative to my number two choice

2298
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:06,920
It is the Guitar Freaks version of Breakdown.

2299
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:10,800
Sounds much better than the TDR version.

2300
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:15,120
Plus it has a funny little video thing.

2301
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:19,940
Now this is top Bomani game, or Bomani music?

2302
02:42:19,940 --> 02:42:21,420
Oh, okay.

2303
02:42:21,420 --> 02:42:22,480
Bomani music.

2304
02:42:22,480 --> 02:42:23,920
Alright, this year.

2305
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:24,960
Alright, um...

2306
02:42:24,960 --> 02:42:27,280
Let's change his mind then.

2307
02:42:27,280 --> 02:42:30,420
Vanity Angel.

2308
02:42:30,420 --> 02:42:35,900
you're a mix too

2309
02:42:35,900 --> 02:42:39,820
very interested in your extreme

2310
02:42:39,820 --> 02:42:43,500
well

2311
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:46,980
because i am tax bitch is gravity

2312
02:42:46,980 --> 02:42:50,500
gravity

2313
02:42:50,500 --> 02:42:52,060
excellent choice

2314
02:42:52,060 --> 02:42:54,460
course because i chose it

2315
02:42:54,460 --> 02:42:57,600
straight so you cannot vote for a big please not so quick that's like four

2316
02:42:57,600 --> 02:42:58,600
years old.

2317
02:42:58,600 --> 02:42:59,600
I'm older than that!

2318
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:00,600
I'm older than God.

2319
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:01,600
Okay, um...

2320
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:14,600
There was a version of, um, uh, Do It All Night that was on, uh, BeatMania 5th Mix.

2321
02:43:14,600 --> 02:43:15,600
Anyway.

2322
02:43:15,600 --> 02:43:16,600
Anyway.

2323
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:17,600
Shmup!

2324
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:18,600
Yes, hi, hello.

2325
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:22,440
Uh, my number two pick is, uh, The Beauty of Silence from 2DX 7th Style.

2326
02:43:22,440 --> 02:43:23,440
I love that song.

2327
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:26,440
This is a pretty silent list.

2328
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:28,440
The beauty of silence.

2329
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:31,440
All of this silence and leaving people alone.

2330
02:43:31,440 --> 02:43:33,440
Oh, yay.

2331
02:43:33,440 --> 02:43:41,440
Well, okay. My next one is actually something that sounded good at first, but then the next version of it that was released was better.

2332
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:47,440
It's another one from 2DX8 style. It's the another version of Murmur Twins.

2333
02:43:47,440 --> 02:43:52,440
The piano scales in that song own you.

2334
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:56,440
Alright, that's your number one pick. Best but money song all year, eh?

2335
02:43:56,440 --> 02:44:00,440
Alright, cool. Good song.

2336
02:44:00,440 --> 02:44:04,440
Well, it was a really good song. The steps could have been better.

2337
02:44:04,440 --> 02:44:08,440
It's Dark Black Forest.

2338
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:12,440
Word. That would have been on my list.

2339
02:44:12,440 --> 02:44:16,440
My number one song is not a tax song, nor is it Sakura.

2340
02:44:16,440 --> 02:44:20,440
Gasp. Gasp.

2341
02:44:20,440 --> 02:44:24,280
very interesting i've had that song on repeat for i'm surprised it wasn't

2342
02:44:24,280 --> 02:44:27,720
burning heat i was expecting you to put burning heat you know as much as i love

2343
02:44:27,720 --> 02:44:31,960
burning heat and i actually crossed out soccer

2344
02:44:31,960 --> 02:44:35,000
just because i can't i have to that's too cliche

2345
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:39,000
she can't be that cliche i had to pick it on musical merit and as much as i

2346
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:42,440
love burning heat i've gotten really tired of hearing

2347
02:44:42,440 --> 02:44:48,200
burning heat i mean because like i went home after um i

2348
02:44:48,200 --> 02:45:03,200
We showed Dan that video, the video for Burning Heat from 2DX, and he was freaking playing Gradius 2, and, you know, I love Gradius 2, I love Burning Heat, but 0-1 is just so much of a better song.

2349
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:09,200
Alright. Fair enough. Did Power Expressing surprise the sacred and make the list?

2350
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:13,200
Well, it's not really that good of a song.

2351
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:15,200
Alright, alright, fair enough.

2352
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:19,840
It's the whole similarity between that and the Max 300.

2353
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:24,640
My pick, my number one choice and the last entry here on our list, I love this song,

2354
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:28,880
it fucking rules, V35 is my number one choice.

2355
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:32,960
I love that song.

2356
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:36,720
Here is the list so far before we eliminate one from the list.

2357
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:44,040
War Game, Sound of Goodbye, Guideca, You Leave Me Alone, The Guitar Fricks Version Breakdown,

2358
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:50,540
Van of the Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence, Murmur Twins Another, Dark Black Forest, Zero One, and B35.

2359
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:20,040
Alright, those are things we're getting smacked for, so there you go.

2360
02:46:20,040 --> 02:46:22,040
Smack them back with the sneaky trowel.

2361
02:46:22,040 --> 02:46:24,040
Yeah, smack them back with our list, here we go.

2362
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:27,040
Now we gotta eliminate, here we go. Black Lab, you're first.

2363
02:46:27,040 --> 02:46:32,040
Okay, this is a tough one here.

2364
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:42,040
Let's see, between two songs on there, the one that I gotta take off, I just, I've heard it on the radio too much.

2365
02:46:42,040 --> 02:46:48,040
And, frankly, I'm not too fond of it in 2DX either. It's the sound of goodbye, so I'm asking that.

2366
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:51,040
YouSuck.com. YouSuck.

2367
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:59,040
Here we go already, starting to eliminate all of Loki's list. This seems to happen every week.

2368
02:47:00,040 --> 02:47:08,040
I wish there was a ban against this group. Bye-bye, Breakdown. YouSuckass.

2369
02:47:08,040 --> 02:47:10,040
But it's a good song!

2370
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:42,040
picking new songs. So, yeah.

2371
02:47:42,040 --> 02:47:46,040
Oh wow, Dark Black Forest goes bye bye, I'm actually really surprised.

2372
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:50,040
Now, as tempting as it is to remove Vanity Angel because that was my

2373
02:47:50,040 --> 02:47:54,040
impulse choice, I really, I can't do that to Loki, I can't,

2374
02:47:54,040 --> 02:47:58,040
and there's another one here staring me in the face that I can't let on, be on

2375
02:47:58,040 --> 02:48:02,040
this list because I think it's just overplayed and overrated, I'm getting rid of War Game.

2376
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:03,040
game.

2377
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:09,440
And Rob and I have come out of this unscathed.

2378
02:48:09,440 --> 02:48:13,400
I wouldn't say that completely because two of those choices were on my list, and I replaced

2379
02:48:13,400 --> 02:48:14,400
them with other things.

2380
02:48:14,400 --> 02:48:20,440
So I think Jamie once again, Jamie, you have this tendency to come through the listless

2381
02:48:20,440 --> 02:48:22,240
segments without any of your songs getting eliminated.

2382
02:48:22,240 --> 02:48:23,240
I told you, I have good taste.

2383
02:48:23,240 --> 02:48:27,720
We have to plot against her one night and just take off all of her choices just to spider

2384
02:48:27,720 --> 02:48:28,720
her.

2385
02:48:28,720 --> 02:48:29,720
As I kick you in the head repeatedly.

2386
02:48:29,720 --> 02:48:33,720
People have worse taste than you do.

2387
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:36,720
That would be everybody in this room.

2388
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:37,720
Hey!

2389
02:48:37,720 --> 02:48:38,720
Okay.

2390
02:48:38,720 --> 02:48:40,720
I was trying to be funny.

2391
02:48:40,720 --> 02:48:41,720
It worked.

2392
02:48:41,720 --> 02:48:42,720
The end.

2393
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:44,720
Well, let's just get the vote on.

2394
02:48:44,720 --> 02:48:46,720
Alright, let's get your vote on.

2395
02:48:46,720 --> 02:48:48,720
Jamie, would you like to read this list one more time?

2396
02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:52,720
Actually, I'm going to paste it in the chatroom, and then you can read it, and then people

2397
02:48:52,720 --> 02:48:54,720
can start sending me their votes.

2398
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:55,720
Alright.

2399
02:48:55,720 --> 02:48:56,720
Here it goes.

2400
02:48:56,720 --> 02:49:03,720
Gudecca, You Leave Me Alone, Vanity Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence, Rumor Twins, Another, Zero One, and V35.

2401
02:49:03,720 --> 02:49:10,720
Best Bamani song of 2002? Might I point out, not a single one of those songs from Max 2.

2402
02:49:11,720 --> 02:49:12,720
Not a single one.

2403
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:14,720
Gasp! I almost put Sandstorm on there.

2404
02:49:14,720 --> 02:49:15,720
Three.

2405
02:49:15,720 --> 02:49:21,720
But it's overplayed, and the only reason I like Sandstorm is because of Children of the Sandstorm.

2406
02:49:21,720 --> 02:49:28,720
Yeah, Children of the Sandstorm was good, but I have grown to hate Sandstorm now after hurting it six times in one day.

2407
02:49:28,720 --> 02:49:35,720
I think, well, I don't think you were listening, but that one, a couple, like a week ago...

2408
02:49:35,720 --> 02:49:38,720
Oh yeah, I heard about that.

2409
02:49:38,720 --> 02:49:45,720
Six times in one day, in different places, and I was going to kill myself by hurting it again.

2410
02:49:45,720 --> 02:49:48,720
I heard the same thing happen to one of my happy hardcore picks.

2411
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:50,720
The picks from Happy To Be Hardcore.

2412
02:49:50,720 --> 02:49:54,720
What song is it that I like?

2413
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:56,720
Like, the flowers need the rain.

2414
02:49:56,720 --> 02:49:58,720
I need you, baby.

2415
02:49:58,720 --> 02:50:00,720
No, I know which one it was.

2416
02:50:00,720 --> 02:50:01,720
It was...

2417
02:50:01,720 --> 02:50:02,720
Let the music play.

2418
02:50:02,720 --> 02:50:03,720
It wasn't Innovate.

2419
02:50:03,720 --> 02:50:04,720
It was one of the other ones.

2420
02:50:04,720 --> 02:50:05,720
I don't remember.

2421
02:50:05,720 --> 02:50:06,720
Let Me Play.

2422
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:07,720
It was Let Me Play.

2423
02:50:07,720 --> 02:50:08,720
But anyway.

2424
02:50:08,720 --> 02:50:09,720
Start voting.

2425
02:50:09,720 --> 02:50:10,720
Start voting.

2426
02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:11,720
In the meantime, we're going to play something.

2427
02:50:11,720 --> 02:50:12,720
I have a suggestion.

2428
02:50:12,720 --> 02:50:17,720
Darktentia, he's pretty sad and pissy that we didn't put Rainbow Flyer on the list.

2429
02:50:17,720 --> 02:50:20,300
So I thought maybe, since it's on the 2DX8-style soundtrack,

2430
02:50:20,300 --> 02:50:21,800
there's a long version of Rainbow Flyer.

2431
02:50:21,800 --> 02:50:22,960
Maybe we can play that?

2432
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:23,380
That's good for you.

2433
02:50:23,380 --> 02:50:24,260
Just satisfy him.

2434
02:50:24,260 --> 02:50:24,760
All right.

2435
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:28,660
We're going to play the long version of Rainbow Flyer.

2436
02:50:28,660 --> 02:50:30,980
The long version Rainbow Flyer is kind of long.

2437
02:50:30,980 --> 02:50:32,620
So I think, you know what?

2438
02:50:32,620 --> 02:50:35,080
No, the long version Rainbow Flyer is a little bit too long,

2439
02:50:35,080 --> 02:50:37,880
and it has Santa in it.

2440
02:50:37,880 --> 02:50:38,800
I don't know.

2441
02:50:38,800 --> 02:50:39,400
I like Santa.

2442
02:50:39,400 --> 02:50:41,880
But actually, we're almost at the end of the show,

2443
02:50:41,880 --> 02:50:43,520
so we've got to keep this break short.

2444
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:45,280
So we're going to play the short version of Rainbow Flyer,

2445
02:50:45,280 --> 02:50:47,320
and we'll play the short version of Burning Heat.

2446
02:50:47,320 --> 02:50:50,680
And we will come right back to finish this up, this show.

2447
02:50:50,680 --> 02:50:53,960
Enjoy, send me your votes right now, now, now, now.

2448
02:54:23,960 --> 02:54:49,520
We're back, and guess what?

2449
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:53,080
We've had so many ties on our list tonight, this is a very hard one.

2450
02:54:53,080 --> 02:54:55,080
This is like an everything tide.

2451
02:54:55,080 --> 02:54:57,080
This is like an everything's tide.

2452
02:54:57,080 --> 02:55:00,080
We want to take everybody's number two pick.

2453
02:55:00,080 --> 02:55:04,080
So, send me your second choice, a second song you would vote for.

2454
02:55:04,080 --> 02:55:08,080
Here's the list one more time for your viewing pleasure in the chat room.

2455
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:10,080
And, Jamie, you want to read that one more time?

2456
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:15,080
Redeca, You Leave Me Alone, Fan of the Angel, Gravity, Beauty of Silence,

2457
02:55:15,080 --> 02:55:19,080
Murmur Twins, Another, Zero, One, and Y35.

2458
02:55:19,080 --> 02:55:20,080
V35.

2459
02:55:20,080 --> 02:55:21,080
That's okay.

2460
02:55:21,080 --> 02:55:24,740
So everybody that's already voted send us your number two pick

2461
02:55:24,860 --> 02:55:30,680
So we'll take your number two pick and add a vote for that and hopefully we'll be able to break the tie and get a

2462
02:55:30,680 --> 02:55:31,920
winner in the meantime

2463
02:55:31,920 --> 02:55:36,220
We're gonna play one more song that was suggested the best momani song of 2002

2464
02:55:36,440 --> 02:55:40,160
However, it wasn't released in 2002, but just because we're funny

2465
02:55:41,560 --> 02:55:45,580
Huh, we're going to play it. Anyway. Oh look Loki sleeping

2466
02:55:45,580 --> 02:55:52,580
Okay, he's just resting his eyes. Okay, here it is. Enjoy.

2467
02:56:15,580 --> 02:56:41,300
You are so sweet and I'm gonna hit you You're the one, you're the one that I need

2468
02:56:41,300 --> 02:56:43,300

They look like they want you back

2471
02:56:47,300 --> 02:56:49,300

Oh Nicki's not your baby

2475
02:56:55,300 --> 02:56:57,300

2478
02:57:01,300 --> 02:57:03,300
Oh Nicki loves to be

02:57:03,300 --> 02:57:05,300

02:57:05,300 --> 02:57:07,300

Head over heels, I'm just breaking your heels

02:57:25,300 --> 02:57:27,300
So give me some water to see how it feels

2486

02:57:29,300 --> 02:57:31,300
Having sex is gonna be an awful day

2488
02:57:31,300 --> 02:57:33,300
I can't stand no more, never dealing

2489

Please hold me tight

2501
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:22,300
In the dark of the night

2502
02:58:22,300 --> 02:58:24,300
Oh Nicki so so big

2503
02:58:24,300 --> 02:58:26,300

02:58:26,300 --> 02:58:28,300

2505
02:58:28,300 --> 02:58:30,300
Just like in heaven

2506
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:32,300
Oh, Nicki loves to play

2507
02:58:32,300 --> 02:58:34,300
You know that makes you sing

2508
02:58:34,300 --> 02:58:37,300
I'll reveal you forever, ever

2509
02:58:38,300 --> 02:58:42,300
Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, Nicki

2510
02:58:43,300 --> 02:58:46,300
Baby, let's come together

2511
02:58:47,300 --> 02:58:51,300
Cause I wanna feel you as long as I can

2512
02:58:51,300 --> 02:59:07,740
Oh, oh, oh, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky

2513
02:59:07,740 --> 02:59:09,700
Goodnight, Nicky

2514
02:59:09,700 --> 02:59:16,700
Rock Over London, Rock Over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio, it's a good place to listen

2515
02:59:22,340 --> 02:59:29,340
to the music. You're listening to Orange Lounge. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. I forget how to

2516
02:59:29,340 --> 02:59:31,340
Whoop!

2517
02:59:31,340 --> 02:59:35,340
I forget how to set that thing to do this.

2518
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:36,340
Rayvar.

2519
02:59:36,340 --> 02:59:37,340
Turn off lights and do that.

2520
02:59:37,340 --> 02:59:38,340
It's pretty cool.

2521
02:59:38,340 --> 02:59:39,340
Rayvar.

2522
02:59:39,340 --> 02:59:44,340
Anyway, here we are, back with the list.

2523
02:59:44,340 --> 02:59:46,340
Uh, Loki.

2524
02:59:46,340 --> 02:59:48,340
Loki, you're going to read this list for us.

2525
02:59:48,340 --> 02:59:55,340
Tell our listening public what came in third place for the Best Bomani Song of 2002.

2526
02:59:55,340 --> 02:59:59,340
3rd place was Vanity Angel from Euro Mix 2.

2527
02:59:59,340 --> 03:00:02,340
Woooooot!

2528
03:00:02,340 --> 03:00:04,340
Black Lab wanted to delete that too.

2529
03:00:04,340 --> 03:00:07,340
2nd best Beymani song of 2002.

2530
03:00:07,340 --> 03:00:10,340
Gravity from 7th Style?

2531
03:00:10,340 --> 03:00:12,340
Yep, 7th Style. Woot.

2532
03:00:12,340 --> 03:00:17,340
And this is very surprising to me, but it did win by quite a few votes.

2533
03:00:17,340 --> 03:00:20,340
It was most people's 2nd pick. I was a little surprised at this.

2534
03:00:20,340 --> 03:00:22,340
So it got a lot of tiebreak votes.

2535
03:00:22,340 --> 03:00:24,340
The number 1 Beymani song of 2002.

2536
03:00:24,340 --> 03:00:30,440
me alone from DDR USA or Max USA. Not USA. Not DDR USA.

2537
03:00:30,440 --> 03:00:34,020
So You Leave Me Alone, the number one balani song in 2002, what do you guys think of that?

2538
03:00:34,020 --> 03:00:37,060
I disagree. I totally disagree. But it's cool.

2539
03:00:37,060 --> 03:00:42,260
It's all about Kachaka. Zero one.

2540
03:00:42,260 --> 03:00:45,860
War Gang got erased. I'm sorry. Did I do that?

2541
03:00:45,860 --> 03:00:50,580
Well guess what guys? It's the end of the show. We're pretty much, we're wrapping up.

2542
03:00:50,580 --> 03:00:51,700
We are all out of show.

2543
03:00:51,700 --> 03:00:53,380
Oh no, we out of show.

2544
03:00:53,380 --> 03:00:58,700
So um, I guess now is the point where I ask everybody, what is your final thought of the

2545
03:00:58,700 --> 03:00:59,700
day?

2546
03:00:59,700 --> 03:01:03,300
Jamie, what is your final thought of the day?

2547
03:01:03,300 --> 03:01:06,220
I want one of those Rayvar light thingies.

2548
03:01:06,220 --> 03:01:07,620
You want a Rayvar light?

2549
03:01:07,620 --> 03:01:10,420
Maybe for Christmas, Jamie, I will find you a Rayvar light.

2550
03:01:10,420 --> 03:01:11,820
Um, okay.

2551
03:01:11,820 --> 03:01:12,820
Okay.

2552
03:01:12,820 --> 03:01:13,820
Loki?

2553
03:01:13,820 --> 03:01:14,820
Actually, I know what I want.

2554
03:01:14,820 --> 03:01:15,820
Black Lab, your final thought of the day.

2555
03:01:15,820 --> 03:01:16,820
No, no, there's something else I want.

2556
03:01:16,820 --> 03:01:17,820
Oh, sorry.

2557
03:01:17,820 --> 03:01:18,820
Sorry?

2558
03:01:18,820 --> 03:01:21,820
I want the leather-bound hardcover copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales.

2559
03:01:21,820 --> 03:01:22,820
Leather.

2560
03:01:22,820 --> 03:01:29,820
Oh yes, Black Lab, are you done? I'm sorry?

2561
03:01:29,820 --> 03:01:30,820
Uh, yeah.

2562
03:01:30,820 --> 03:01:33,820
Okay, Black Lab, your final thought of the day?

2563
03:01:33,820 --> 03:01:38,820
Final thoughts, I'm coming out of my chocolate high now. Yay.

2564
03:01:38,820 --> 03:01:47,820
Um, now I get to sleep and then wake up at 7am and drive home.

2565
03:01:47,820 --> 03:01:50,820
Okay, that's it?

2566
03:01:50,820 --> 03:01:51,820
I think that's it for him.

2567
03:01:51,820 --> 03:01:53,820
And my final thought is,

2568
03:01:53,820 --> 03:01:56,820
Oh! This is my favorite show!

2569
03:01:56,820 --> 03:01:58,320
This is my favorite show!

2570
03:01:58,320 --> 03:02:01,820
It's my favorite shoe!

2571
03:02:01,820 --> 03:02:03,820
He's thinking it's a fortune cookie, or something.

2572
03:02:03,820 --> 03:02:05,820
No we have a fortune cookie.

2573
03:02:05,820 --> 03:02:06,820
We already have a fortune cookie.

2574
03:02:06,820 --> 03:02:07,820
Dedicated to the Holidays.

2575
03:02:07,820 --> 03:02:08,820
Dedicated to Holidays.

2576
03:02:08,820 --> 03:02:11,820
Uh, my final thought of the day is, um,

2577
03:02:11,820 --> 03:02:14,820
Lord of the Rings was very big.

2578
03:02:14,820 --> 03:02:16,820
Very, very big.

2579
03:02:16,820 --> 03:02:19,820
First of all, Lord of the Rings is the name of the trilogy.

2580
03:02:19,820 --> 03:02:23,820
The Two Towers was very big.

2581
03:02:23,820 --> 03:02:25,820
Now the whole trilogy, I would agree, is very big.

2582
03:02:25,820 --> 03:02:29,820
Yes, that's what I meant. The whole trilogy is very big.

2583
03:02:29,820 --> 03:02:32,820
Or the Rings Part 2, the quest for more money.

2584
03:02:32,820 --> 03:02:34,820
That's baseball's part two.

2585
03:02:34,820 --> 03:02:35,820
Word.

2586
03:02:35,820 --> 03:02:40,820
And I guess the only other final thought I can think of to...

2587
03:02:40,820 --> 03:02:42,820
Oh, you do, Jamie?

2588
03:02:42,820 --> 03:02:44,820
Yeah, I actually have one more. It's a realization.

2589
03:02:44,820 --> 03:03:00,820
Anybody who's ever a Mel Brooks fan, anyone ever noticed that this song at the end of History of the World Part 1, the Jews in Space song, is the exact same tune that was used in Robin Hood Men in Tights for the Men in Tights song?

2590
03:03:00,820 --> 03:03:02,820
I did not know that.

2591
03:03:02,820 --> 03:03:04,820
It's the same tune?

2592
03:03:04,820 --> 03:03:06,820
The Jews in Space, is that it?

2593
03:03:06,820 --> 03:03:11,820
Yeah, but it's the same tune as the Men in Tights song.

2594
03:03:11,820 --> 03:03:13,820
Fascinating.

2595
03:03:13,820 --> 03:03:20,820
I thought of one more thing to say, Zing.

2596
03:03:21,820 --> 03:03:23,820
Word!

2597
03:03:23,820 --> 03:03:25,820
Good night.

2598
03:03:25,820 --> 03:03:29,820
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2599
03:03:29,820 --> 03:03:33,820
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2600
03:03:33,820 --> 03:03:41,820
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.

2601
03:03:41,820 --> 03:03:45,820
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2602
03:03:45,820 --> 03:03:48,820
Okay children, gather around.

2603
03:03:48,820 --> 03:03:52,820
Now since Eric Cartman can't seem to remember the words to Oh Holy Night,

2604
03:03:52,820 --> 03:03:54,820
we're going to use a little shock therapy.

2605
03:03:54,820 --> 03:03:57,820
I'm going to give one of you children this cattle prod,

2606
03:03:57,820 --> 03:04:00,820
and if Eric forgets any words, just shock him a little, okay?

2607
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:02,820
Who wants the prod?

2608
03:04:02,820 --> 03:04:04,820
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

2609
03:04:04,820 --> 03:04:06,820
Here you go Kyle, why don't you take it?

2610
03:04:06,820 --> 03:04:07,820
Sweet!

2611
03:04:07,820 --> 03:04:09,820
Okay Eric, whenever you're ready.

2612
03:04:09,820 --> 03:04:16,820
Hey! What was that for? I didn't screw up!

2613
03:04:17,820 --> 03:04:20,820
No, Kyle, you can't shock him unless he forgets the words.

2614
03:04:20,820 --> 03:04:22,820
Sorry, Mr. Garrison.

2615
03:04:22,820 --> 03:04:38,820
Oh, how we know the stars are brightly shining It is the day of our dear Savior's day

2616
03:04:38,820 --> 03:04:43,820
Oh, how in the...

2617
03:04:43,820 --> 03:04:46,820
Jesus!

2618
03:04:46,820 --> 03:05:02,820
Jesus was born, and so we give praise.

2619
03:05:02,820 --> 03:05:26,820
Singing

2620
03:05:26,820 --> 03:05:40,820
I remember that whole chorus didn't even have to...

2621
03:05:40,820 --> 03:05:41,820
Mystic!

2622
03:05:41,820 --> 03:06:06,340
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
