5011	8533	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10514	15576	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19236	22177	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22497	25678	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26238	29038	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29499	32399	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33199	33620	Just kidding.
33800	35400	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35620	38001	In this episode... Hey, are there any boars down there?
38021	40361	That's the biggest fairy I've ever seen, Tinkle Fairy.
40381	42462	What's your favorite security movie?
49099	49679	Showgirls.
50560	51440	Absolute fright.
51980	52780	What's yours?
52801	55281	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55342	57202	Don't torture yourself.
57242	58023	That's my job.
58163	59963	Now's the time where Spock can send me dogs!
60103	63165	I'll get you, my pretty.
63345	64685	And your little dog, too.
65085	65906	I know Kung Fu.
66366	68727	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
69027	70868	Why did they have to take the word gang?
71748	74949	No one expects a punishing position.
75410	76250	It's Kendo.
76290	76490	Hey!
79093	81174	DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,
106138	106379	S, Actdeft,
141241	142543	Thank you for watching!

178539	179399	See you next time.
204887	205892	Thank you for watching!
248014	249395	Thank you for watching!
277282	278606	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
329468	333289	This is a microphone check, and apparently the microphone is finally working.
333329	334929	I think we had it plugged into the wrong place.
335110	336650	Anyway, sorry about the dead air earlier.
337070	338310	So we're going to do the intro again.
338590	338891	Yay!
339831	341331	Anyway, we're live!
342111	342972	Or something like that.
344112	345052	Maybe I'm dead, I don't know.
345572	346173	No, I'm alive.
347253	347993	Okay, I'm alive.
348573	350174	They said that I was alive, so I guess I am.
350894	352934	Anyway, it's December 29th, 2002.
353054	354535	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
354635	355955	This is sort of episode 26.
355995	356295	Actually, uh...
359335	363616	Two-thirds of our little group is sort of not here.
364996	371957	Rob and Matt, sorry, Sky and Loki, they are currently in the car all the way back from Southern California because they went and didn't bring me.
372557	374818	Well, I was working, you know, kind of need to make money.
375298	379899	So they might have a little bit of a dedication during the FUs of the week.
381939	385980	I've got two special guests with me in the studio, I guess, today.
386860	388020	Let me go ahead and...
389544	390805	Do a little introduction again.
390885	395269	We have with us in studio Jessica and Ross, also known as Iguana Girl and Islander.
395309	397030	So have them say a couple words.
398271	403335	Yo, yo, Step Squad representing in this biz match.
405656	409379	I really can't come up with anything after that marvelous intro.
409399	410520	So hello, people.
410660	411020	Let's go ahead.
411061	411541	What's going on?
414934	417200	And, uh, that's, uh, that was stunning.
417481	417882	Beautiful.
418263	419266	Yay!
419627	420089	Wee!
420109	421432	I had to get my eyebrows.
422509	424289	Let's go ahead and give shouts out.
424429	426750	Okay, again, Step Squad, of course.
427650	429450	And hello to everybody in the chat room.
429490	434611	For anybody who is tuning in and has never even heard of our chat room, what hole have you been living in?
435272	440233	You can find our chat room at orangelounge.skie.cx.
440373	443793	So go there or we'll hunt you down and kick your ass because your information is on the Internet.
443813	444774	We can find anybody that way.
445634	445934	Anyway...
447274	451136	I had just got done playing a song from Drum Mania, which was Miss You.
451857	455679	Sorry, a bunch of people probably know it from the English lyric version right on time.
455719	467965	But we're going to go and play a song from Dance Mania Bass 10 and a song that's going to be in DDR Extreme called Speed Over Beethoven and something from Parappa.
468125	468886	Let's go old school.
468966	470667	So that's it for now.
568049	571590	You can't touch this You can't touch this
747145	748231	Thank you for watching!

918359	921501	You can go on to the next stage now.
921521	922061	Yahoo!
922081	922301	Alright!
944914	951340	We are back from our little break and what you heard was, uh, yes, Bach.
951440	953922	No, not Bach, Beethoven.
954503	954543	Oh.
970140	994793	Um, what we, uh, had playing there is, um, to go ahead and clarify what I said, I said we were gonna play a song from, uh, Dance Mania Bass, and then a song from, uh, uh, DVR Extreme, which I actually even said the name, it was Speed Over Beethoven, but the first one we played was, um, You Can't Touch This, it was the bass mix from, uh, Dance Mania Bass 10, and then the last one we heard is Chop Chop Master Onions Rap, the first level of Parappa the Rapper.
995633	995954	Yay.
996974	998375	Um, anyway, uh,
999580	1004984	I'm sure that about everybody is familiar with DDR Extreme being released on Christmas Day.
1005004	1017772	And we even said that we didn't think it would be because who would have thought that it would have been so important in Japan to release a game on a holiday that's basically just a commercial holiday there.
1017832	1021975	But apparently it was released and hopefully we'll be seeing that stateside.
1021995	1026958	Of course, whenever we get an update of what locations have that, we'll be letting everyone know.
1027977	1030262	Unfortunately, there's no official update yet.
1031846	1032307	Anyway...
1033730	1040415	But we've got some information on DDR Extreme actually taken directly from Konami's site.
1040435	1047761	You can find the information at www.konami.co.jp slash am slash ddr slash extreme.
1049362	1060190	The new songs that are going to be in DDR Extreme, we have a Cartoon Heroes Speedy Mix, I Do, I Do, I Do, Irresistible,
1060550	1062151	La Copa de la Vida
1084895	1086977	Then we have Speed Over Beethoven, which I just played.
1087537	1091320	Scenery the Speedy Mix, Jenny Wong, which should make JB very, very happy.
1092321	1094243	We Are the Champions, Factory Team Remix.
1094323	1096325	I'm hoping that they didn't redo Queen.
1096465	1102750	We are the champions, my friends.
1102770	1104391	Then we have We Will Rock You.
1104431	1106053	I guess they are going for a Queen theme.
1106293	1112118	And we keep on fighting to the end.
1113579	1118642	Anyway, you know, I thought that it would be bad enough after that horrible version of Killer Queen.
1118702	1125566	I mean, at least the music part was right, but whoever they had singing that just needed to be shot or fried or something.
1125646	1126106	I don't know.
1126126	1127247	Fried would be nice.
1127647	1132330	No, shot, and then as they're bleeding to death, they fry so that they bleed fast.
1132350	1132870	Deep fry.
1133010	1135272	Deep fry them so that you can, like, eat them like a Twinkie.
1135612	1138474	Yeah, we dip them in batter and then put powdered sugar on them when they're done.
1138994	1139854	That was a good suggestion.
1140175	1140795	See, there you go.
1142228	1144169	I'm sorry about the microphone.
1144189	1145250	Stop your microphone.
1145811	1151154	Anyway, another thing we have, we have 1998, Naoki.
1152335	1153275	I don't know if anyone's seen it.
1153296	1160861	There actually has been a picture floating around of a, there's a desktop available for people who have seen it of the Mecca from Brilliant to You.
1162021	1163962	I actually knew who happens to read my live journal.
1164383	1168925	You see a picture of that mecha that was taken from a background that was made for 1998.
1169286	1172367	Then we have Bag by Revenge.
1173128	1176610	Graduation, I'm not even going to bother to try reading the...
1179830	1182613	Hiragana, because right now I can't make my brain think in Japanese.
1182993	1184634	But it's B for you, so it's gotta suck.
1187477	1190760	Then we have Hyper Eurobeat, Naoki featuring DDR All-Stars.
1190880	1192842	Hey, it's not Paula Terry, rejoice!
1193522	1194503	Yay!
1195024	1196125	Ooh, it's Eurobeat.
1196385	1201830	Then we have Love Shine, Paranoia Survivor, Tears, which is Naoki Underground.
1201910	1205053	I've noticed Naoki Underground stuff is a little bit better than the usual stuff.
1206125	1209567	The Legend of Max by ZZ, Trip Machine Survivor.
1209867	1210588	More Trip Machine.
1211769	1212029	Yay.
1213310	1215451	Crash, Mr. Brian and the Final Band.
1217012	1218253	What happened to the band before?
1219393	1221074	I think they were sacked.
1221735	1223616	They were deep fried.
1223636	1227058	They were deep fried like a Twinkie and eaten by cannibals.
1227378	1229679	Just another great treat from Orange Lounge Radio.
1231937	1238262	They were taken to the island of eyeball-eating cannibals, like the one who stole my Animal Crossing character's eyes.
1239203	1241085	But that was last week.
1241525	1241865	We have... Ah!
1243006	1243327	Sorry.
1245348	1247190	Politeary!
1248031	1250933	At least Memories isn't a bad song, and she sort of holds the key there.
1251494	1252254	She usually doesn't.
1252835	1255737	Then we have Vanity Angel, which we've probably played on here before.
1255777	1257559	If not, I'll see if I can sneak that in later.
1258880	1262361	and 3P303 Bass Mix, which we've all heard if we bought Konomics.
1263301	1264482	Cutie Chaser Morning Mix.
1265082	1266342	Yay, Cutie Chaser!
1266762	1267563	And it's the good one.
1267663	1268823	It's the one from Ohasta.
1270324	1270804	Do it right.
1277266	1280087	We have a Do It Right Harmonized Two-Step Mix.
1280487	1281427	From the American Macs.
1282153	1283274	Yes, from the American Max.
1283694	1285656	We have Drop the Bomb System SF Mix.
1286077	1289079	Pretty cool that we got these songs before Japan did, don't you think?
1289420	1290741	Yeah, actually, that's really cool.
1291305	1292026	It's because we kick ass.
1292046	1292946	That's fucking right.
1292986	1296349	But then again, you know, they had everything first and we had to wait.
1296369	1297890	It's about time.
1297970	1298771	It's about time we got some.
1298791	1300893	It's kind of like the Bay Area versus Sacramento.
1301213	1302494	Yeah, we have A-Style now.
1302534	1302995	We're happy.
1303035	1306357	And we have it on a nice plasma screen.
1306377	1308079	Where the videos actually work.
1308339	1309580	Yes, the videos work too.
1309980	1311982	I was rather enjoying looking at some of those videos.
1312022	1312322	Weren't you?
1312903	1313303	Oh, yes.
1313403	1315044	Yes, the videos were quite enjoyable.
1315064	1315465	Except for...
1316232	1316552	DarkSakura
1338010	1339031	Colors for Extreme.
1340031	1342432	I guess that's probably a redone version just for DDR.
1342452	1343953	We have Happy Wedding, which makes me happy.
1344033	1346934	All of that song's balls can die for all I care.
1347355	1348035	What, Happy Wedding?
1348055	1348315	Yes.
1349496	1349736	Why?
1349796	1351117	Why does Happy Wedding need to die?
1351257	1355018	Happy, happy, happy, happy wedding!
1355699	1359381	Well, you know, Ryan has a problem with that for a different reason.
1360401	1362002	Let me actually pass off the mic for a second.
1364011	1376559	Going on with the list, we have Namor e la Liberté, which is actually a DDR version of a 2DX song that was on 7th style.
1377439	1380001	And then we have Stoic Extreme version.
1380021	1381462	Apparently they're doing a whole new version.
1381662	1383603	Again, that's another 2DX song.
1384204	1385865	There's V for Extreme.
1388606	1389667	Most people know what V is.
1390768	1392329	That's coming from 5th style.
1392349	1392429	What?
1393886	1395447	I have no idea what that song is.
1395867	1401508	I have no idea because it's in the... Go translate that for me, Jamie.
1401528	1403329	I can't remember which that is.
1404129	1404589	You know what?
1404609	1405769	We're going to do something here.
1405789	1410911	It's going to take us just a minute to go ahead and... No, Babelfish sucks.
1411771	1413211	I'm sorry for whoever just dropped.
1413251	1413692	My bad.
1418293	1420093	Oops.
1421134	1421934	We love you anyway.
1422850	1427111	We're going to a little site called At Nifty Global Gate.
1427611	1429672	This is a really good little translation site.
1430072	1437254	We're going to do this to translate all of that lovely kanji that I can't read because I can only read five kanji.
1437514	1439315	No, I read about 40 kanji maybe.
1440275	1443076	Anyway, back to... Was this the one?
1444421	1451407	Okay, it's a Naoki song featuring Yuki, and by the way, chat room, I'm not really paying attention because I sort of have to manage the show, my bad.
1454390	1455351	And that's incorrect.
1455551	1456451	That's not a URL.
1456752	1457773	No, it's not a URL.
1458293	1458894	Goddamn.
1461776	1462997	Okay, this is lovely radio.
1463558	1466220	Okay, it means a blue impulse.
1468542	1469222	A blue impulse.
1469282	1471044	It's better than, you know, like a white creamy one.
1471857	1474019	Thank you, Nostelon, for announcing your bathroom break, by the way.
1474599	1477261	Anyway, back to the list.
1477321	1479883	We have Destiny Lovers.
1480323	1485206	We have by Kunita something.
1485687	1489049	Anyway, I'm Going to Get You by Kelly Cosmo.
1489109	1491311	We have Jet World, which we like Jet World.
1492431	1493292	Jet World's a cool song.
1493332	1500017	We have another one that I recognize the first kanji as being a three, but we're going to go ahead and run that through translator as well.
1500037	1500477	It's part of three.
1502176	1520337	We have Tortoiseshell Catlock, which, Tortoiseshell Catlock, this is what it translates to, and then the group that does it is called Subtropical Muzzy Sky Bomb.

1551340	1553522	Is that the same thing?
1553542	1554943	What song can you do?
1570595	1577619	We have Love to Sugar by DJ Taka featuring Norio
1593897	1596158	White Lover, um, White Lovers, I'm sorry.
1596238	1599720	We have, uh, well, Ten Something.
1601040	1602101	God, all this kanji.
1602121	1605322	Uh, Satoru Omi.
1605342	1606903	That's what it's called.
1608364	1610365	Um, we have... God damn!
1611265	1612346	More kanji!

1697033	1697613	I was the one.
1697773	1698374	Hey, that was a...

1709804	1710424	That's pretty cool.

1714405	1729169	We have Trip Machine, Paranoia Eternal, Put Your Faith in Me, and Think You Better D. I'm not even going to bother reading the old songs because if you've been living in a box and you haven't seen anything that's on DDR Max, so enjoy your little box there.
1729769	1734570	Anyway, we're posting this in the chat room for everybody to see.
1735070	1735631	And there you go.
1735771	1736251	There's the link.
1736891	1737251	So, uh...
1739193	1741915	What's new else in the Bitmoney world?
1742055	1745417	Anybody want to have a go?
1745777	1746258	Don't look at me.
1746278	1750460	Talk about the tournament.
1750880	1751841	Oh, talk about the tournament.
1751921	1752221	Okay.
1752822	1754022	I guess there's a tournament.
1756724	1759226	It's the 11th of January.
1759266	1761087	There's a tournament at Fremont.
1761667	1762628	Was it Ardenwood?
1762768	1763308	Funtime Pizza.
1763629	1764229	Funtime Pizza.
1764349	1771513	It's Funtime Pizza in Fremont, and if you're in the Bay Area or in Sacramento area or anywhere in NorCal, you probably know where it is.
1773074	1778898	I believe it starts around 11 or noon.
1779438	1780739	You can check out the details.
1781159	1784141	There's a thread on it on ddrfreak.com.
1785342	1791388	Um, and you can get linked to the Killer Pals site, which is who is putting this on.
1792089	1805183	So, um, it's looking like it's going to have Perfect Attack, um, Freestyle, and then also Freshness Freestyle, which is basically something kind of from the, from the
1805763	1808345	from the Shaft A-Team Freestyle type of thing.
1808425	1810346	So it should be a good time on that.
1812047	1818651	I would imagine that your best bet, though, would be to get the information from the site because I'm just remembering what I can remember off the top of my head.
1819931	1823794	But Jamie is getting us set for our next break.
1825915	1827876	And she's trying to find some neat stuff.
1827896	1834600	We're actually taking over the airwaves because we've decided that...
1836238	1837200	Korean Time
1852150	1855332	Yes, it's Big Booty Fun here on Originals Radio.
1856352	1859134	I'm going to play what I have immediately available, but you never know.
1859234	1864777	I might be playing, you know, even more bootylicious stuff here during one of our upcoming breaks.
1864817	1867618	So we're going to get a break to gather ourselves.
1867638	1871200	So the first thing you get is Tashani with a Gungo, also known as Caution.
1871260	1875202	And please don't Caution drop it in your chair, because you could break it.
1875282	1876002	It would hurt.
1876242	1878784	It would hurt a lot, so here goes.
1926018	1942238	B-Boost, I don't have a flat You can't stop me from smiling, Bonnie and Clyde Number 1, 2, 3, go, until the end of the night Your next chance is over, I told you It's easy to make you cry, it's like you don't want it I know what you did, now you're like another Now I'm the one who's coming, my lover Say goodbye to my baby one week, past you

2461152	2461813	Thanks for watching!
2665751	2667351	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
2667712	2672633	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
2673473	2679435	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
2679795	2681676	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
2682236	2686617	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
2689150	2690672	Alright, we're back live.
2691012	2697239	That was a collection of some stuff from DDR, third mix, Korean version.
2697900	2700804	We had Gagai by Sharp, which was the second song.
2700824	2702826	The first one we played was Tashani with Caution.
2703547	2706891	I see that we had a few people caution dropping after I warned them not to.
2708492	2708893	Excuse me.
2710256	2717358	We also had from DDR Euromix 2 and also going to be in DDR Extreme, Vanity Angel.
2718158	2722719	And then just for the hell of it, Erotic with Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.
2723580	2725020	So that was it.
2725060	2729521	We went ahead and did a little bit of research on new releases in the Beimani world.
2729561	2738944	We also have the release of Pop Music 9, which I actually can't exactly find a date on, but there is some new stuff being incorporated into that game.
2740084	2747069	According to the official Konami Papa Music 9, there's a few new modes introduced.
2747329	2755775	I actually just posted a link to that page in chat, although unless you're fluent in Japanese or have a good translation program, you won't be able to really make any understanding of it.
2756335	2764459	But one of the things that they mention in there is called Osasume Mode, which is basically easy mode.
2765280	2775925	You're given an option when you start the game to say yes or no, and you can basically play the first level as bad as you want to without failing, which is good for the newbies, I guess.
2776745	2783710	and then another neat thing, and they've actually got a few of the cards shown on the site, memory cards for pop and music.
2783750	2792376	I guess it works similar to like the ones in the initial deracing game in Derby Owner's Club for all the crack, you know, sorry, horse addicts, I should say.
2793417	2800061	Like somebody in this room that I'm not looking directly at and pointing to, and another person...
2801782	2806665	Um, but, uh, apparently you can save your settings or game data on the card.
2807266	2810188	I could read this in the really bad English that my translator put it.
2811268	2818313	Um, well, just to give this a skim over, it basically says that you can save an expert course, the one that you design yourself.
2819434	2826979	And, um, it says that it is convenient, and the game becomes pleasant further, even if it takes, right or wrong, an entry card using playing.
2829617	2835960	That automatic registration will be made to the internet ranking if it plays using a Poppin Music 9 entry card.
2836980	2837120	And.
2839461	2840842	Yes, I am reading!
2842555	2845856	I am reading directly from the page here.
2846057	2847737	Actually, it says Hata and.
2848998	2851959	Anyway, so there's some new options.
2851979	2861783	Wouldn't it be cool if they did that for DDR or let you program your own Oni courses at home and then bring your card in and play it on the machine?
2862003	2863744	I mean, what type of stuff would you pick?
2865805	2875014	Well, I'm thinking it might be even better, you know, because we already have memory card slots that we use regularly that we have to actually pay for ourselves.
2875935	2883202	It would just be, you know, this great technology out there right now with this type of card system that they're just now starting to get into with Konami.
2884014	2884935	It's cheap.
2885216	2890622	You just toss in a buck or whatever and it pays for the card and it saves everything for you.
2890662	2891863	I mean, why the heck not use it?
2892344	2897570	It saves from having to have big, huge, expensive memory card slots.
2897610	2899212	Instead, you just have a card reader and that's it.
2901747	2907410	What they used to have, though, back in the day, I don't know if anyone ever watched the old, I think it was the GamePro show that used to come on.
2907470	2909531	It had that guy hosting anyway.
2910892	2918555	They had, when they were showing the NeoGeo system way back when, the cartridge system, which, you see those big things?
2919256	2920657	Those are NeoGeo cartridges.
2920677	2921137	They're huge.
2921497	2923478	They're basically the arcade game cartridges.
2924198	2929040	And they had a card that you could take and put in on the Neo Geo Arcade system.
2929200	2931581	Come home and play the same game on your AES.
2932401	2936882	And you could start from where you left off in theory.
2937462	2941244	But it's hard to find any of those that still have the cards.
2941904	2942344	Are you okay?
2944505	2945345	I'm sorry about the chair.
2946105	2948586	I have a chair in here that's trying to systematically kill Ross.
2949026	2949406	My bad.
2950787	2951647	Yeah, straddle on.
2952853	2954234	Are you there?
2954654	2956254	He's traveling the chair.
2957315	2960896	No, this isn't liked by his girlfriend's suggestion.
2960916	2961076	Okay.
2963317	2968999	Anyway, I was suggesting, you know, keep an eye open for those Neo Geo machines.
2969139	2970419	You can see those card slots on them.
2970459	2972840	But, you know, they could do that same thing.
2973320	2974741	It's like you were saying, they're cheap.
2975661	2980223	If they brought out a new home system that incorporated those little cards, you could save your data that way, too.
2981539	2982079	Yeah, J.D.
2982139	2982400	Roth.
2982420	2982720	Thank you.
2982760	2983460	That's who it was.
2984561	2984941	J.D.
2985061	2985382	Roth?
2986442	2987823	No, he did Funhaus.
2989184	2989424	J.D.
2989464	2990385	Roth did Funhaus.
2991973	2994374	Yeah, he was dumb.
3019887	3023829	Anyway, no, we're not having Mr. Spanky's masturbation party.
3026230	3034034	Anyway, okay, Mr. Spanky, I mentioned what Mr. Spanky is.
3034074	3037016	Mr. Spanky comes on and gives sex tips on our show.
3037656	3038977	Oh, really now?
3039077	3041118	Do you think he might have a temperature for me?
3041578	3043579	He told us how to have a masturbation party.
3043599	3044580	Oh, really?
3044600	3046241	Make sure you have plenty of latex.
3048065	3049806	That earned a burp from Jessica.
3053288	3056570	Yeah, the Neo Geo also has an outlet that you can plug your headphones in.
3058030	3066334	That burp was brought to us just for Travis from Jessica as a token of her extreme belting.
3066394	3066755	Anyway.
3074108	3077610	Oh, heaven forbid that I make anybody think about anything.
3078571	3084574	But back to the subject at hand, you know, Konami is finally incorporating this.
3084594	3086055	You know, what if they start doing this for 2DX?
3087645	3088266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3104671	3105272	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3119165	3121946	So technically, the GameCube has a way to read those cards.
3122767	3130570	And if they could do it that way, there's no reason that Konami should be able to do that.
3130790	3136372	Maybe they'll release something for the WonderSwan and have the WonderSwan compatible with the PS2.
3136412	3138233	That would make them some money right there.
3139293	3140013	But it's a thought.
3140073	3140934	Think about it, Konami.
3142074	3145175	And then again, like anyone, Konami's actually listening to us right now.
3148422	3148922	I don't know.
3178175	3188563	Remember, I'm not going to read anything unless it's over a private message, and go ahead and you can email that to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com, which is all up and ready for me to check on.
3189224	3199592	So, I'll tell you what, even though I can't, you know, play it while we're actually doing the Fuck You's of the Week...
3201730	3207232	We're gonna pick songs for everyone's Fuck Yous of the Week, but because I'm special, I'm gonna go ahead and pick mine.
3208092	3209813	Because I always use the same song every week.
3210433	3213834	Um, we'll go ahead and get this started, and the next song we're gonna pick is Jessica's song.
3214855	3215675	It's a surprise, though.
3217315	3223377	She gets a song, and then we'll have Ross's pick, and then we'll come back, so everybody starts sending me the, uh, F Yous of the Week.
3224198	3227499	And if you don't send them, I don't read them, because I can't read something that doesn't exist.
3229841	3230763	You can make one up, though.
3230783	3231564	Well, I can make one up.
3232085	3235652	But anyway, let's go ahead and get this started.
3235692	3236614	So send them now.
3236734	3237536	Yes, now.
3237977	3239600	Now, now, now, now, now, now, now.
3240221	3240742	Five minutes ago.
3355886	3356613	Thanks for watching!
3473322	3476022	When you say you do, baby, I love you, I just can't resist
3513085	3517574	All you need is my arm, fill me with the joy, I can't say no now
3563632	3565434	Thank you for watching!
3596921	3596941	S,
3741983	3742888	Thank you for watching!
3806274	3822286	Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball Yes, this break was brought to you by the Swedish Chef And of course, Tack with the Psycho Duck Children
3827769	3831850	During that break we played my theme music, Schlagwerk, because this is fucked up.
3832750	3836171	And then Jessica's request of Traces.
3836191	3838612	Yeah, it was Attack Attack.
3839272	3843833	And then even though Paul Oteri is officially banned from Orange Sounds Radio until the end of the year.
3843853	3845073	There is nothing wrong with Paul Oteri.
3845453	3846153	I love Paul Oteri.
3846173	3846734	Love you, girl.
3847094	3849594	Even though she can't hold a tune to save her life.
3850535	3851475	Go ahead, marry her.
3851655	3852255	See if I care.
3854499	3855780	Why would anybody want to?
3856080	3859982	She looks anorexic and can't sing.
3862263	3863524	We've gone off on Politary before.
3863784	3867606	This is not the Fuck You Politary show.
3868866	3873989	We also had the remix from DDR USA, Drop the Bomb.
3874429	3877991	We had Tack with QQQ, again, the Psycho Duck Children.
3879796	3891102	Anyway, we are, you know, because for some reason I can't play music in the background of my show while we're using the microphone because of the mixer on here.
3892423	3893883	Yeah, don't marry Paul Terry, she's ugly.
3897525	3898486	She's not very married.
3899967	3903288	I'm Maple, M-A-R-R-Y.
3904249	3905329	Yeah, she's unhappy.
3905829	3907410	She's unhappy because we hate her.
3908411	3908631	Sorry.
3910414	3917300	Anyway, but I can't really play the music over, you know, with the microphone, so we get the silent fuck yous of the week.
3917781	3921484	They're a moment of silence in honor of being angsty.
3922145	3925828	Anyway, my fuck you of the week, you know, I don't really feel very bad.
3926268	3929071	I mean, true, the other host went to SoCal without me.
3931314	3934776	But that's okay, even though I had work and I was bored.
3935336	3935817	It's okay.
3937157	3941260	I was just really, really alone.
3944582	3945943	And I got peanuts for Christmas.
3946603	3948444	Which were nice peanuts, they were quite tasty.
3948484	3949405	And I got lots of chocolate.
3949505	3951466	I got peanuts, I got nuts too.
3951486	3952006	You got nuts?
3952166	3952587	I got nuts.
3953247	3954108	Were your nuts salty?
3955068	3957209	Um, actually, yeah, actually they were fancy.
3958210	3959231	You had fancy nuts?
3959691	3959891	Mm-hmm.
3961485	3969012	Anyway, um, other than that, you know, there's not really, you know, I'm pretty, pretty happy, I think.
3970033	3979042	Oh, oh, fuck you to the 8th style machine for breaking my nail, but it's sort of a not really because I got to play it and we have ours.
3981184	3983486	Yes, I have, uh, I have had a cry.
3985228	3989489	But, um, the, uh, it was actually pretty nice to have that.
3989749	3992250	Also, uh, fuck you to cheese.
3993210	3998711	We went to, uh, Old Spaghetti Factory, and they put a lot of cheese on their food.
3998771	3999851	This is what I had.
4000952	4002652	I had garlic cheese bread.
4003732	4004112	With cheese.
4004913	4005973	I had butter on my bread.
4007270	4013394	I had cheese and spinach, ravioli with alfredo sauce, covered in cheese, the mithril cheese, by the way.
4014314	4015395	Mithril cheese.
4015835	4016736	What was it?
4016796	4018137	Mizzithra.
4018357	4019257	Mizzithra cheese.
4019357	4021659	But the first time I saw it, I read it as mithril cheese.
4022680	4025481	Made by the elves, who'd pawned their own mother to have it themselves.
4025801	4026062	Anyway.
4029584	4032786	And then I had ice cream and a cream soda.
4034113	4039335	We were in the freeway going to, uh, Scandia when I realized that I really had to go to the bathroom.
4039815	4041775	So, fuck you to lactose intolerance.
4046637	4048857	Which then spawned Fun Parappa.
4048897	4052578	Yeah, which then had us going into the Parappa funky flow.
4053378	4056139	Anyway, um... Parappa funky funky flow.
4056199	4058320	Anyway, uh, let's, uh, how about your FUs of the week?
4060635	4070200	I'm actually very, like, normal this week, so, um, I, I, uh, I have an F you from last week, maybe I could do that one.
4070780	4083046	Um, F you to everybody who waits until the last fucking minute to do their Christmas shopping, because they make people who are in retails' lives hell.
4083707	4085668	Not to mention, not...
4086810	4087151	Hey, Mark.
4110516	4112917	and all that fun crap.
4113277	4121220	And F you to the coin slot on 8th style, but it's not really an F you because I love the machine and it's pretty and it's five minutes from my house.
4122840	4123160	Ross?
4124541	4125801	None.
4125821	4126722	You're boring.
4127282	4128362	I can't think of anything, no.
4128902	4129562	I love everybody.
4129923	4130223	Really.
4130823	4131643	You're full of shit.
4133824	4134524	Just cast Maple.
4135224	4135745	Isn't that right?
4135925	4136905	Maple's full of shit, too.
4138315	4141617	Um, um, whatever.
4143178	4144659	We could have Jessica step on your toe.
4145840	4147821	Yeah, then I could say I have a nephew, yeah.
4150323	4151844	Then he could say you're sleeping on the couch.
4157647	4160309	Did we have a moment of silence in honor of that phrase?
4162759	4166584	I think we've gotten most of the crap out of our system.
4166624	4167185	Let's go ahead.
4170349	4171371	I think you got props.
4173433	4174815	Anyway, let's go ahead and...
4176650	4177510	Yes, you can let us know.
4177750	4179271	We actually have a new person in our chat room.
4179291	4181092	We'll go ahead and give a shout to our new person in a minute.
4181432	4188215	Let's go ahead and read the FUs of the week from our lovely, lovely and talented listeners.
4189215	4191136	First, let me have DarkTetsuya.
4192877	4194017	FU to not having FUs.
4197518	4198539	That was eloquent.
4200466	4202248	Next, we have DVR Angel.
4202628	4205270	My FU this week goes to DVR Max 2 Machine at Ronert Park.
4205750	4214097	Scandia, again, for not taking tokens and the people that work there that are too lazy to fix it and say they're technicians that come in at 5pm need to fix it and not them.
4214537	4216919	Didn't I get that from RVGL?
4217019	4221303	That was my FU of the week last week, which I'm not even going to get into because they're still pissing me off.
4222967	4226929	Next, we have 23Rangus who says, Big FU to my bed.
4227089	4228049	Or his bed, not my bed.
4228089	4228549	My bed's cool.
4228929	4229710	I have a California king.
4231210	4237013	Anyway, FU to his bed for causing great neck pain while still looking so fluffy and squishy and super sleepy time-ish.
4237773	4241975	FU to learning pata pata because, damn, I can't learn a pata while uggling the all-stars.
4243455	4249798	FU to Met Commander 2 for being too easy and a giant FU to a CD clock radio for not wanting to read my B-Money CD.
4250138	4250258	Out.
4251642	4253563	And, um, that was it from him.
4254664	4257926	By the way, we now have people in here doing pata pata in their chair.
4258327	4260708	You know, I'll just, doing a yesterday.
4261589	4263050	And now we're doing boom and fire.
4264791	4270275	Um, our new person, Ohaya Bemani, thank you, by the way, for coming into our chat room and tuning in.
4270435	4276599	Um, F you to people who hog new DDR machines and refuse to give others a try, who go out of their way just to see it.
4276679	4277820	God, that's true.
4278701	4280602	You know, we didn't do that today.
4282355	4283957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4303610	4305151	We have VidPower next.
4305951	4308012	F you to free time, because I need more of it.
4308212	4312133	F you to classical speed for only being 30 minutes, because it's got such great songs and there needs to be more of it.
4312453	4313653	Classical speed was interesting.
4314794	4319155	F you to not being able to pick out more happy hardcore CDs because I can't find any at the music store.
4319835	4324737	Oh, and F you to Rob's OL auto schedule since it won't play the OL Rewind on Thursday afternoons.
4326150	4326691	DSCS SoCalKicks
4344008	4345649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4367450	4374156	Um, actually, it's, um, an F you from, uh, her and, uh, Mel B. It's for Jingle from Animal Crossing.
4374216	4375517	He is such a bitch to find.
4375878	4381222	And then you go and try to find a present from him, and Mel's only got one present in the hour and a half he's been trying.
4381723	4383024	Friggin' punk-ass reindeer.
4383064	4384225	He gets a fuck you of the week.
4386327	4388529	Mel says he wishes Grandma would run over Jingle.
4389888	4395312	So, that's from Shark Skull, who, you know, both of them have been, I guess, on the show before, a couple times.
4396934	4399856	The other one we have is from...
4406719	4425028	Fuck my friend and his dad for his DSL ruining the dial-up internet on the laptop for three days, which was over the period of the show time, so I missed the show and life sucked.
4426696	4432459	and fuck his posture because it sucks and birthday for being on a Monday and having to have a party on Sunday night.
4432559	4433899	I have a bigger fuck you then.
4434720	4437261	Uh oh, we're getting into another fuck you from Jessica.
4438221	4439482	And missing the show, so fuck that.
4439582	4443804	And one more, fuck projects over break because that destroys the whole break thing and they should just die.
4444084	4444444	Yes!
4445264	4448526	Teachers just don't realize they need the time for relaxing stuff and projects make it sucky.
4448566	4449106	Boo on teachers.
4449713	4451056	Yeah, boo, boo his.
4453300	4455023	Jessica has another, fuck you.
4455403	4456565	Let's go ahead and pass the mic back.
4458632	4464195	This is a mini FU for people who try to schedule things on other people's birthdays.
4464655	4469718	You know who's... The person I'm talking to knows this one.
4470178	4471298	And I love you, man.
4471658	4472579	But that sucked.
4474040	4475520	Anyways, I'm trying to fix it.
4476081	4480323	And I guess you'll be invited when it gets taken care of.
4480743	4482724	But, yeah, there you go.
4486792	4490515	That would just suck having an important event scheduled on your birthday, wouldn't it?
4490895	4496760	Yeah, that person just needs to be ashamed.
4497820	4502744	I don't know if you heard that person, but apparently all your balls need to die.
4504385	4506427	But you're still loved, you're still loved.
4508854	4509374	Whoever you are.
4510716	4513378	Oh, we have another FU of the week from Blackwab.
4514879	4515600	Fuck headaches.
4515920	4517742	Slept too long under the influence of painkillers.
4518622	4521545	And fuck his girlfriend's little cousin for trying to kill him last night.
4521985	4524407	You know, if someone tried to kill me, I'd want to say fuck you to them too.
4525849	4526769	And fuck oyster.
4526990	4527430	I hate it.
4527570	4528231	It makes me sick.
4529031	4529852	Nice English there.
4532955	4533675	I hat yet.
4534436	4535217	It makes me sick.
4535537	4535597	Yay!
4536837	4537797	Let's hear it for Ingrish.
4538538	4539718	Let's loving Ingrish!
4540799	4541139	Yay!
4541959	4542139	Oh!
4543180	4545621	And we have an FU from Maple.
4545821	4548943	FU to his brother who wants the computer while he's trying to listen to OL Live.
4549063	4549543	Yeah!
4549883	4551464	There's things that are more important!
4553405	4554845	Like having FUs written to you.
4557446	4560508	And, uh... Dan!
4560548	4561568	Got an FU of the week?
4564710	4565190	My man is...
4566604	4568325	My man does not have an FU of the week.
4568345	4577911	Yes, we're doing these at my house, and my fiancé is downstairs, apparently, playing Animal Crossing, which is our crack in this house.
4579272	4581454	So, you know what?
4581694	4583295	I can't think of anything to say right now.
4583695	4587478	I'm being honest with you all, so I'm going to go to break, because I have to pee.
4588618	4589519	We want a special song.
4590280	4594923	I'll tell you what, we're going to go ahead and play a song for everybody listening, and
4596744	4607256	which, and I'm going to apologize because this is off the CD so if it doesn't, there may be a moment of silence while I'm trying to get it to actually work so I apologize if that ends up being the case.
4609147	4618733	What I'm going to play is a song that has been heard in, actually the home version of Beatmania 2DX, that's 8th, no 6th style, why did I say 8th style?
4619173	4622074	But it's been in 7th style and 8th style.
4622935	4624936	Should I play the remix or just the regular long?
4625076	4625837	We'll play the remix.
4625877	4636723	This is the remix version of Beautiful Days, and it may take me a moment to get this up and running, but be patient with us, and thank you for doing so.
4646205	4646329	Oh!
4671929	4678613	Looking back when I was a child and dream, growth and maturity would come to me.
4678633	4685498	Having faith in you set me free and fly away.
4687279	4693163	Looking back when I was a child and dream, growth and maturity would come to me.
4693183	4696585	Having faith in you set me free and fly away to everywhere.
4885444	4886585	Thanks for watching!
4933971	4937598	Thank you for watching!
5209620	5213990	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because Bongo Demands It
5216764	5218465	Yes, because Bongo demands it.
5218565	5218945	Listen.
5219645	5222246	Well, I guess if you're hearing me say this, you're listening right now.
5224346	5237050	Anyway, the second song we played is Simple and Clean, which is the full English version of... Actually, I think it's the only song in English I've heard by Utada Hikaru, but that was the one from Kingdom Hearts.
5237851	5241792	Maybe later on I'll play the Planet B remix, but unfortunately I don't have the English one, I only have the Japanese one.
5242632	5271714	um we have a belated um fuck you of the week uh from Nost Island and we had Jessica falling over in the other chair waving her hands and going help and Ross is rescuing her um anyway um we have this belated fuck you of the week uh to Homestead for their crappy uh web servicing etc dot dot dot and that is a direct quote so uh
5273487	5276749	We actually have some discussion about some older games in here.
5276809	5280251	We have a discussion about Marble Madness 2.
5282012	5284234	Do you have hiccups?
5285214	5286775	Okay.
5286815	5288136	Somebody needs to scare Jessica.
5288216	5289317	Let's play some more Politary.
5290478	5290898	Are you okay?
5290918	5290998	Okay.
5294358	5295378	Are you okay?
5295518	5295758	Okay.
5296338	5298179	I couldn't tell if you were in pain or laughing.
5299739	5303380	I hiccup, and then I burp.
5304020	5306720	I hiccup, and then I burp.
5307820	5309641	And then I hiccup, and I burp.
5310841	5312521	We have hiccuping and burping.
5313441	5316562	It looks like we actually have some discussion going on about old school games in here.
5316602	5322103	Of course, 23rd Amagus is telling us about The Guardian Legend.
5323139	5325420	Of course, which is my favorite Nintendo game ever.
5326900	5328421	We had votes for Marble Madness.
5329861	5331802	Maybe we'll do two listless tonight.
5331842	5334102	We actually had an idea for one, but maybe we'll do two.
5334122	5335803	Okay.
5336383	5339524	So, why don't we actually, let's go ahead and start our first one.
5339904	5340304	Why don't we?
5343125	5345286	As soon as Jessica stops hiccuping.
5346406	5348047	Okay, baby, this will scare you.
5348067	5348487	Vanilla Ice.
5348527	5349427	Vanilla Ice.
5356216	5357096	Are you burping still?
5358997	5362098	Hey, chat room, suggest a duck hunt.
5363479	5367441	Okay.
5370002	5374804	Okay, so what's scary enough to get rid of Jessica's hiccups?
5377265	5380106	What would be scary enough to get rid of Jessica's hiccups?
5380206	5380506	Rub that.
5382130	5387414	That would be scary enough to kill people.
5388355	5390917	Okay, think back to the Miggle 2 tournament.
5391718	5393499	Think about to where we put Brad in your trunk.
5397262	5399724	We put Brad in your trunk on the way to Lions.
5400005	5401085	Oh yeah, we did, didn't we?
5401165	5401926	Well, isn't that scary?
5402567	5405689	Because he flashed his pale skin to the world.
5406650	5407691	That is kind of scary.
5408331	5409032	Are you still hiccuping?
5410737	5411137	Chatroom.
5413479	5415019	No, the click of vision is not scary.
5415099	5416280	Politary Prawn.
5416560	5416720	Ew.
5419682	5421163	That's disturbing.
5421803	5422283	Wow.
5423824	5424945	No, she would be the dildo.
5426506	5427186	She's ugly.
5428087	5429948	She's very ugly.
5429988	5431068	The 250 BPM Satan fetus is pretty scary.
5438968	5441589	I would not play that song for ages because of the Satan fetus.
5443389	5444949	Foam bat porn.
5446530	5446830	Blink.
5447470	5447770	Blink.
5448390	5449090	Dot, dot, dot.
5449110	5450050	It's not foam bat.
5450090	5451091	It's plastic bat.
5451211	5451951	Plastic bat.
5452611	5453051	Get it right.
5453431	5456732	It's plastic and it's orange and it's been signed by practically everybody now.
5457692	5459353	I think her hiccups went away.
5459373	5461373	Her hiccups went away?
5461393	5461453	Yay!
5461473	5461533	Yay!
5466111	5468293	Travis did come up with the worst one.
5469134	5472736	And I got a random message from... Some idiot.
5473257	5474798	Yeah, some idiot.
5477160	5483044	So, um... Well, why don't we go ahead and try to do a listless, you know?
5483445	5486227	True, I seem to be playing, like... Just ignore the person.
5486447	5489489	Tons and tons and tons and tons of music the whole time.
5489509	5490370	Ignore!
5490790	5491611	Just right-click ignore.
5491631	5492632	Can't you?
5496294	5496854	Oh, that's lovely.
5497515	5508880	Um, we're having an issue right now with the, uh, chat room, so I'll tell you what, let me go ahead and play a couple more songs, uh, until we, uh, get this settled, so, uh, let's play some stuff from, uh, Jet Set Radio.
5509461	5510881	Here's Guitar Vader with Super Brothers.
5513623	5510881	... ...
5560949	5561790	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
5637116	5638192	and Sipa Brazzers.
5683124	5684645	Okay, crisis averted.
5684825	5686365	For the time being, right?
5713018	5717002	Anyway, that song is actually from the first Jet Set Radio.
5717162	5719504	That was Super Brothers.
5719584	5722527	The soundtrack for that game was very interesting.
5723387	5727171	When they brought it out for the US, though, they were supposed to have added some more tracks to that.
5727972	5729313	But it was a pretty cool game.
5730294	5730354	Um...
5731641	5732701	Anyway, we're going to go ahead.
5733922	5740503	We're not going to be doing the song battle this week because, of course, my other two hosts aren't here to put in their contributions.
5740583	5743464	So we're going to go ahead and leave the playlist the way it is this week.
5743524	5746565	But next week we actually should have the song battle.
5747085	5752166	And because none of you voted for Knight Rider, hello, then I'm going to pick a new song.
5752266	5756267	So you have to vote for it because anything that I pick, of course, is going to be instantly cool.
5756467	5758747	They didn't vote for Knight Rider?
5758867	5761028	I put in a nice remix of the Knight Rider theme.
5761960	5764201	and nobody, and like, two people voted for it.
5764241	5764861	You're all idiots.
5765062	5767483	But it lasted for two, it actually made it through three weeks.
5768443	5768603	Okay.
5768623	5770924	So, so, people had some taste for a while.
5771564	5777547	Yeah, um, thanks to, uh, DarkTessia, it was, uh, they put some Rob Zombie music in, uh, in, uh, Jet Set Radio.
5778908	5785431	Anyway, um, we're gonna go ahead and, uh, go into one of our, uh, favorite segments, which is, uh, the, uh, listless.
5786144	5791565	We're probably going to do two of them today because we're not having the Battle of Songs.
5791605	5792746	And hey, don't you all love it?
5793286	5796206	So this one is going to be... Well, I don't know.
5796587	5797987	Should we do Best Old School Game?
5798027	5800307	Maybe Best 80s TV Show, perhaps?
5801488	5804188	How about Best Sitcom or Tune?
5804769	5805389	What would you suggest?
5806729	5809190	Hmm... Sitcom.
5809210	5810550	Because Tune's going to be too hard.
5810910	5812651	Best 80s Sitcom.
5813611	5814071	So, uh...
5815191	5819213	I don't know how many of you are actually going to be old enough to get it.
5820915	5822976	But, you know, think back.
5824377	5825277	All of it for Propel.
5826958	5828619	Propel was not an 80s sitcom.
5829820	5831261	No, Stalin wants to hear you laugh again.
5833442	5833902	How was that?
5834943	5836484	You actually sound kind of evil when you laugh.
5838320	5839200	That's my evil boyfriend.
5840100	5841561	That's what I was trying to be evil.
5842281	5844201	Actually, we have a suggestion for best 80s movie.
5845522	5846342	That's too broad.
5846562	5847462	It is pretty broad.
5849243	5852163	Like, you'd have to break it down to best 80s comedy.
5852203	5857525	Because there's only three of us here, so maybe we'll pick four each.
5858325	5859345	So maybe we could do it that way?
5861125	5866287	Best live-action, non-animated 80s movie.
5866507	5867447	Crap, there goes Transformers.
5868257	5869398	Edwards Scissor Penis
5889957	5890857	No, it's Penis Hands.
5890937	5891617	Penis Hands.
5891697	5892577	Edward Penis Hands.
5893018	5895518	See, now our ratings are going to go up because we're talking about porn.
5895538	5895978	See, look.
5896078	5899519	You realize it's extremely sad that I know more about porn than my boyfriend does.
5900919	5901559	Oh, owned.
5901999	5904320	Whatever I have in my possession.
5904740	5905760	Trace the Lord's first video.
5905800	5906180	Hello.
5907640	5908980	And that has what basis?
5909280	5909781	Oh, yeah.
5910221	5911221	She was underage.
5911521	5911861	Yeah.
5913001	5913601	Yeah.
5913861	5914761	Child porn.
5914781	5916902	You can't tell it was the 80s.
5916942	5917542	She looked old enough.
5918484	5919845	What, big hair and fake boobs?
5920305	5927708	Was that the same excuse that you used for... I'm not even gonna ask.
5928309	5928709	Anyway, um...
5932975	5936017	We're going to vote for four-piece.
5936677	5937957	So, hey, guess what?
5937997	5941339	I'm going to play more music because I can't think of anything else to talk about.
5941359	5942280	So we're going to go ahead.
5942660	5954085	We did actually have some requests for more Parappa music, so I'm going to go ahead and play the final song for Parappa the Rapper 2.
5954165	5958347	We're going to go ahead and throw in some more Jet Set Radio stuff.
5959828	5961429	Let's see what else we're going to play.
5963671	5965673	Sweet Soul Brother Jet Start Radio
5991485	6001557	So stick around, make sure that you keep your eyes open because we're going to go ahead and be voting for our songs and then we'll go ahead and let you know what we're up to.

6774332	6776966	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
6782463	6788248	And so I hope we all have our answers ready for our list list.
6790310	6792432	And Dan has decided to participate in this.
6792773	6799359	Because there's only four of us, usually we do this with six or more, we all picked four songs, but we're still going to vote only for the top three.
6799759	6801721	And I repeated one of my movies on here.
6802001	6802922	Damn it, I'm dumb.
6804324	6805345	We're choosing movies.
6807759	6809760	Okay, well, I'm going to go ahead and do what I originally had on here.
6809800	6813842	So, we're going to go ahead and start with me, because we can.
6814742	6816123	I don't know, but let's go ahead and start with Jessica.
6816463	6818344	What's your number four movie?
6819965	6822986	Number four, we have Weird Science.
6824387	6824607	Huh?
6826688	6826868	Huh?
6828902	6829802	Number three?
6830983	6832444	Oh, Weird Science?
6833424	6839668	Well, what other movie can you see two guys running around with bras on their heads and it seems completely normal-ish?
6841409	6842069	Number three?
6845031	6846471	Okay, passing off to Ross.
6849313	6852775	Number four on my list was A Christmas Story.
6853555	6854956	Well, it's seasonal.
6855811	6858653	It's still funny to this day, and god darn it, you'll shoot your eye out.
6863996	6868319	My number four was Aliens, because that movie's hard like the rock.
6874523	6881287	Okay, my number four is Adventures in Babysitting.
6882611	6889693	because of the part where they're singing and Thor.
6890974	6891614	Hey!
6892334	6894255	Adventures in Babysitting was a good movie.
6895515	6898776	So, let's go ahead and go to number three.
6900971	6909974	Number three for me would be Clue, because, you know, you got three different endings, you never know which one you're going to do.
6910254	6912535	So, here's Ross.
6915056	6915616	Very nice.
6915716	6917717	My number three movie is Revenge of the Nerds.
6917777	6917997	Why?
6918337	6923319	Because I can consider myself one, and hey, any movie with boobies is a winner in my book.
6926624	6931206	My number three movie is The Karate Kid because it's the only cool thing that Ralph Macchio ever did.
6934448	6935309	Too true.
6937690	6944473	My number three is Legend because it has a young Tom Cruise in chain mail.
6945154	6946915	No, not in chain mail, in his outfit.
6947635	6949116	And plus Tim Curry's a pimp.
6950897	6952198	Okay, number two.
6954176	6959880	Number two for me is the one that everybody's been asking about, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
6960520	6966984	Because, you know, when Cameron was in Egypt's land, let my Cameron go.
6969326	6972728	My number two was Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
6973448	6973828	Yes.
6975009	6975570	Phoebe Cates.
6980513	6982534	My number two was The NeverEnding Story.
6984321	6986543	Because that movie was like, cool.
6987184	6987884	Yeah.
6988585	6989005	Cool.
6990787	6993409	I know that my favorite is going to get voted off, but I don't care.
6993789	6994550	It's Xanadu.
6996311	6997653	What other movie can you get?
6998033	7001916	Leg warmers and roller skates with one of the Bee Gees.
7001936	7003938	Well, he looked like he belonged to the Bee Gees anyway.
7004599	7006861	And Don Bluth animation on top of it.
7006881	7007221	Rolling.
7007953	7009473	and no, not Roller Babies.
7010353	7012674	I actually like that movie and I admit that it's bad.
7013214	7016115	But Xanadu was just like really cool.
7016175	7019715	Plus it had Olivia Newton-John in it and Electric Light Orchestra music.
7019915	7025256	Anyway, what do you mean?
7026036	7027156	They're all positive.
7027537	7032017	Anyway, what's your number?
7032117	7035338	Well, that's my number too then because I actually like the other movie better.
7037285	7038526	Okay, number one.
7039106	7045309	This is my personal number one because I'm a sap and, you know, like John Hughes movies are like the pimp shit and all that.
7046190	7046930	Pretty in Pink.
7047350	7050712	Because you, how can you not love John Cryer as Ducky?
7050972	7051713	He is just too cute.
7054334	7054474	Aww.
7055034	7058696	My number one movie was another movie with Molly Ringwald in it.
7059977	7061337	That would be Breakfast Club.
7062058	7066040	Classic, classic movie about nothing but Saturday morning detention.
7068959	7070020	and Judd Nelson was hot.
7072562	7077686	My number one movie is Back to the Future because that DeLorean kicks ass.
7079028	7083531	Christopher Lloyd is awesome and Michael J. Fox was even kind of cool at the time.
7083712	7086334	Plus I've watched it like seven times in the last three days.
7086814	7087255	Yeah.
7088376	7089296	So you must be going crazy.
7091698	7095741	And here's my other fuck you of the week to Mystique for buying that for Dan.
7096061	7099243	Because I've had nothing but Back to the Future playing on the TV.
7099723	7100524	No, I'm kidding.
7101725	7105007	My number one... Yeah, the music was cool too.
7105147	7107088	My number one is Labyrinth.
7109270	7111892	Because it has David Bowie.
7116655	7117555	No, Dan, don't go...
7121310	7123852	You know, no styling has pointed out something.
7125273	7126514	Nobody named Superman.
7128396	7129737	It was a 70s movie.
7130137	7129737	1978.
7132239	7134001	Although, the second one was 80.
7135342	7136863	The second one was not worth it.
7137103	7138024	The second one had Zod.
7142335	7143616	But it wasn't as cool as the first.
7144297	7146639	When I was a kid, Superman 2 looked awesome.
7146659	7153845	When I watched it later on, I was like, that's the worst looking set I've ever seen.
7153945	7158730	And then Superman 3 went all to hell because of it.
7158870	7160491	Alright, so chat room.
7160712	7163674	We are going to offer you five minutes to vote for your song.
7164455	7168358	So go ahead and start sending me...
7169585	7170045	Movie Movie
7198240	7211226	Hmm, I am going to vote off... I think I'm going to vote off Xanadu, just because I have issues against, you know, like, disco queens and shit.
7215628	7218710	I'm going to have to go knock off Adventures in Babysitting.
7220430	7221211	I don't know about that one.
7221231	7223532	Poor Jamie's tattoo of hers gone already.
7230455	7231616	Pretty in Pink's gotta go.
7233158	7233558	Goodbye.
7248365	7252747	Alright, so, um, we have our songs, we're gonna vote for the, uh, song!
7253007	7253587	Ugh, crap!
7253888	7254288	Movies.
7254728	7255829	Movies.
7256329	7260951	We're going to vote for the, uh, top, uh, three movies.
7261851	7263072	And I'm posting them to the chatroom.
7264373	7264733	There you go.
7265693	7278137	What we have on our list is Weird Science, A Christmas Story, Aliens, Clue, The Karate Kid, Legend, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, The NeverEnding Story, The Breakfast Club, Back to the Future, and Labyrinth.
7279318	7280698	Black Lab, I'm going to kick you.
7281318	7283379	I know where you... Well, I don't know where you live.
7283699	7285179	Anyway, go ahead and start the voting now.
7285540	7286120	We're going to...
7287200	7292866	You know, whichever one of those was the best movie of the 80s, so we're going to go ahead and get started with a song.
7292886	7296890	You have five minutes to send in your votes, and if I feel nice, you might get a little bit more time.
7297410	7299112	But I don't normally feel nice, so go ahead.
7368568	7369632	Thanks for watching!
7475353	7477674	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

7802756	7803177	I kill you!
7803437	7805418	Okay.
7807460	7810723	Anyway, we have a winner.
7811483	7812344	And the winner wins.
7812925	7813785	But what does the winner win?
7814646	7817048	The winner wins the distinction of being cool.
7817769	7821011	So, let's have a drumroll please for number three.
7823413	7824274	Number three is Clue.
7824754	7825155	Clue.
7827185	7829466	Tim, another, a very good Tim Curry movie.
7829886	7830126	Yes.
7830526	7832347	Madeline Kahn is awesome.
7832367	7833147	It had Madeline Kahn.
7833387	7836289	Flames on the sides of my face.
7836969	7838950	Heaving, heaving breaths.
7840330	7840510	Yes.
7840770	7844452	Well, actually, that was in, that line was in our, um, old intro.
7846012	7847113	It was a Rob influence.
7847453	7848013	Enough said.
7848693	7848893	Yeah.
7850454	7855656	Um, our number two was Dicey's Future by A Last Minute Vote.
7857054	7885575	and Dan feels rather thrilled at that the number one by a resounding number of voids voids, voids, voids, votes Ferris Bueller's Day Off you know there were a lot of movies that didn't get Raiders of the Lost Ark was mentioned Superman, but Superman was the 70's
7889858	7890078	No.
7890819	7898501	There were... But we... I'd say Ferris Bueller's Day Off, though, had to have been, like, one of the top movies of the 80s.
7899901	7908244	Um... You know... It would be cool if they would put more 80s songs, though, in DDR and Beatmania.
7908724	7909724	You know, we got The Reflex.
7910945	7911705	That was pretty neat.
7913125	7913365	Yeah.
7913866	7917387	And you have, like, a crop load of, like, songs that have been covered.
7917907	7918087	Here...
7920305	7923807	Well, like I said, you have a bunch of songs that have been covered.
7923827	7932092	I mean, like Xanadu, like Have You Never Been Mellow, so... Yeah, but covers aren't nearly close to the same thing.
7932992	7935093	True, but they're there, kind of.
7935774	7937274	I mean, look at Smoke.
7937555	7940396	That's from the 1973 Deep Purple song.
7943438	7944118	Right.
7944138	7944759	I shot the sheriff.
7945119	7948681	Yeah, I heard that on the radio just the other day.
7950019	7951900	Wasn't Boom Boom Dollar an 80s tune?
7953640	7957922	Maybe, you know, an 80s tune in Japan or something.
7958662	7959603	Mighty Fine In Dollar.
7962063	7967845	Yeah, I wish that there would be more 80s stuff, just if only to infuse the youngins with good... Oh boy.
7967865	7968206	Goodness.
7968246	7969626	Gosh, well, let's see.
7969666	7970366	There's...
7979065	7982006	What's other 80s and 70s stuff, like all the Casey and the Sunshine Band stuff?
7983106	7984626	Thanks for speaking with this great topic.
7984726	7984786	70s?
7986547	7988087	Okay, disco, yeah.
7988427	7993188	Disco's cool and all, but, I mean, you're comparing apples and oranges.
7993228	7998289	You're talking about, you know, like, Miracle versus Disco Inferno.
7998349	7998749	Come on.
7999029	7999569	All right, fine.
7999589	8000050	It's not fair.
8000070	8001950	All the disco stuff's awesome.
8003775	8005656	I'm like trying to do the mic pass here.
8005676	8006736	I know, it's pretty hard.
8006936	8008577	You probably heard about half what everyone says.
8008637	8009297	It's not your fault.
8010357	8011538	Bad mic setup.
8012878	8019361	Yeah, and in case you guys hadn't quite caught it yet, Little Miss Jamie is in the poopy pot right now.
8019501	8020641	Yet again.
8021521	8022282	Yet again.
8022842	8025303	Because she has had too much Propel.
8025883	8026923	Imagine that.
8027003	8028064	Propel her into the bathroom.
8029031	8030731	Yes, she's being propelled onto the toilet.
8030751	8032752	I can't believe y'all didn't vote for Back to the Future.
8032772	8033972	I mean, come on, really.
8034132	8037773	You know, it's available in a nice trilogy box set now at finer stores everywhere.
8038233	8040594	But is it fixed?
8040714	8047216	Apparently there was an issue with the second and third movies not being available in widescreen.
8047576	8048556	That seemed to work on mine.
8049196	8052297	Maybe you got the second set then, because they were supposed to re-release them.
8052617	8053017	Probably.
8058922	8064850	You know, that is actually a point of debate, though, people being concerned over widescreen over fullscreen.
8065210	8068655	Okay, there's no debate there.
8068675	8071258	People over widescreen are mindless, idiotic zombies.
8071278	8072220	Dan, they can't hear that.
8075120	8077001	I don't want my stuff cut off.
8077121	8077661	I don't know.
8104211	8105212	I don't get why it is, though.
8132208	8132568	DarkSakura.com
8142048	8170059	they had Steven Seagal wasn't on there but they had someone portraying Steven Seagal and they had super wide Steven vision Seagala vision that was it and they had the widescreen so wide that you could see like stuff that was like off the set you could see the guy over in the other room you know going to the bathroom or eating or something and then all of the extras over there getting food off the table but uh
8172170	8175211	There's a... I don't see why people enjoy that.
8176471	8181513	Okay, we can't all have mics because the splitter that I bought was not the right splitter and we couldn't find one.
8183374	8183794	I agree.
8184274	8185674	Dan said, dude, that's booty.
8185694	8187335	I totally want a mic.
8188115	8188975	Dan wants a mic.
8188995	8190816	See, Dan's got his taste of radio now.
8192576	8193557	They said they can hear you.
8194757	8194997	Yeah.
8195017	8195797	He likes the power.
8195817	8196298	I'm a pimp.
8197698	8199439	Did you hear him say that he's a pimp?
8199659	8200719	He said you're loud.
8203951	8209556	Yeah, that's... He sticks out like a hitchhiker's thumb.
8212579	8213440	It's not dumb.
8215262	8216523	Dan's gonna get kicked in a minute.
8219006	8219326	Anyway.
8221628	8222089	So, uh...
8224068	8232659	We actually, now we've got comments coming in about Alan Rickman movies, so that makes me feel all happy and joyous.
8234761	8243252	So, as far as the sim update, I'm going to be fully honest, I don't keep up with the sims.
8244244	8250226	Well, some people keep up with the game, The Sims, but I don't keep up with the simulators or anything.
8250386	8256487	I understand that the Tourney Mix 3 deal didn't go as well as some people had wished that it would.
8257968	8261849	We're going to have a full update on that one next week when Loki is back on the radio.
8266101	8276130	Hopefully though, he did mention something about having unlimited access to get all of those things hosted up on the site so we'll be able to let everybody know and we'll probably put something up on our webpage.
8276571	8288762	By the way, again, for people who are wanting to participate in chat, just go to orangelounge.skie.cx and there is a link to our chat room located there on the site and you can participate in all the madness and
8290447	8297072	We actually had a couple people saying that Tourney Mix 3 actually was pretty good.
8297232	8299254	So, what was good about it?
8299354	8300415	What was good about Tourney Mix 3?
8300675	8301936	I didn't participate in any of that.
8302717	8307741	By the way, we also... There's a Matt's Edit contest, Make Edit Get Porn.
8310062	8312104	Yes, it's called Make Edit Get Porn.
8313585	8316047	I think that's going to be in a couple of weeks is when that's going to expire.
8316067	8319490	It was supposed to be last week, but nobody... Well, we only had...
8321343	8324585	We only had two entries from what I understand.
8325345	8331950	So it's going to be anything that's in Max USA for the United States.
8332790	8333831	Make your edit for that.
8333991	8335512	Send it in to Matt one way or another.
8337213	8339774	You can send it to me if you want to and I'll get it to him.
8339854	8341976	But you win this contest.
8341996	8343257	There's only one winner, by the way.
8343377	8344237	But you win the contest.
8344457	8345178	You get porn.
8345958	8351340	Okay, it's not like hardcore stuff, but it's more like Skinamax-style porn and Playmate of the Year and crap like that.
8352061	8353281	Girls Gone Wild, ooh!
8353981	8354662	Snoop Dogg version.
8355002	8358783	You know, I'm wondering why they don't have, you know, Men Gone Wild.
8360424	8362325	I would be all over that.
8363533	8363953	Sorry, Dan.
8364473	8367875	If you don't want to see the kind of guy who would just whoop out his dong.
8368235	8368995	If it's big enough.
8370275	8370916	If he's hot.
8374417	8375317	Dan, dear.
8375337	8375937	I'm going to leave the room.
8376017	8381499	Only hot chicks take off their tops.
8381519	8384660	Well, mostly.
8385701	8391463	But, seriously, if you're just not getting any and you need your porn fix, send in your edit.
8392560	8396222	You might just get lucky.
8396402	8398543	All five of your fingers will be lucky.
8400584	8403285	Either in a fap or a schlicking.
8403325	8405426	Yeah, either in a fap.
8405446	8408568	You can play fap fap revolution at home.
8408728	8410969	Or schlick schlick if that's your thing.
8411829	8413830	Or schlick schlick revolution if that's your thing.
8415151	8415491	Indeed.
8416212	8418153	Yes, everybody wants porn.
8418173	8418973	I did not mention the porn.
8420251	8423734	According to Maple, everybody that wants porn is busy getting porn.
8425255	8434621	So, uh, MP4 style.
8435542	8442647	Anyway, I think that it's time that, uh, I think it's time that, uh, maybe we went to another break, don't you think?
8445369	8446970	I don't have to go to the bathroom again.
8448911	8453052	Yet, but I'm on my second bottle of Propel, who knows.
8454313	8455593	I don't know, what do we want to listen to today?
8455613	8457614	Do you have any requests?
8458454	8461755	We don't want to listen to Satan Rock.
8463896	8464456	What track is it?
8465877	8467577	What track is it?
8467878	8468498	Hold on for a second.
8471419	8472259	That's the original one.
8473279	8474540	So you can play one of the originals.
8475460	8477441	We're trying to figure out songs to play, so we're like...
8478955	8483297	We have a request for Boom Boom Dollar, but I don't know if Jamie's going to circumvent that or not.
8488319	8492821	So Jamie's playing with tracks.
8492861	8495842	She's having fun and just kind of tossing things around.
8496322	8499724	If you're sitting in a car between two guys, is it okay to get wood?
8500344	8501604	It's not even okay to ask.
8505486	8505966	There you go.
8505986	8506987	You're uber fun.
8509161	8510121	Those are the free songs.
8510902	8513123	The free song solo cake.
8514323	8516204	We're running out of things to sing.
8516985	8517525	Help!
8520166	8521326	Jamie's playing with music.
8521407	8522927	Actually, do me a favor.
8523187	8524108	Throw in one of those.
8524548	8527189	Yeah, one is the originals, and one is the free song.
8527429	8527669	Okay.
8536078	8540100	We had a request for Beautiful 21C, and I thought it was on one of these discs, but you know what?
8540300	8543262	I don't have Beautiful 21C, but I will, eventually.
8544283	8547445	So, let's go back to... Yeah, next week on Orange Lounge.
8548585	8548905	We're gonna...
8551223	8557147	We're going to go ahead and look for a song that was requested.
8557568	8558008	What style?
8558508	8558728	Third.
8559309	8569096	Alright, from third style, Beat Me Into Dicks third style, we're going to, assuming that I have the song, we're going to go ahead and start it off with a request.
8569196	8569696	I don't have it.
8571017	8571998	I don't have Macho Gang.
8576521	8577782	Second style, I have...
8579980	8582029	Alright, we are playing Macho Gang.
8582310	8582671	Enjoy.
8583615	8584378	Hey, anal fighter.
8687465	8688151	Thanks for watching!
8986365	8988071	SOS, The Tigers Took My Family
9037466	9039007	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9076283	9077471	Thanks for watching!
9218052	9219356	Thanks for watching!
9338513	9344299	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
9344679	9347903	Well, we're back and we're on the home stretch of the show.
9356519	9365887	We did get a request for a very funny song, and unfortunately I haven't been able to quite get it just yet, but I can't promise anything.
9366468	9372173	We may be able to have that ready for the afterbirth of the show.
9373534	9379580	Ross was bringing up something very interesting earlier about Japanese video games, about some of these weird ones.
9379600	9380961	Do you mind telling us about it?
9383925	9387826	Well, I mean, you've seen some of the stuff, like the ones where you have to walk the dog.
9387866	9388566	I mean, come on now.
9389906	9395407	Goodness, South End Mall in Hayward had the one where they had the butt, and you had to have the paddle, and you had to spank it.
9396147	9397007	It didn't last too long.
9397387	9398088	Let's just say that.
9398588	9401968	When I had, you know, some friends of mine walking up behind it and trying to mount it.
9403829	9404969	Yeah, it's not going to last long.
9405529	9406769	South End Mall did have something cool, though.
9407089	9410730	They did have the Monkey Ball arcade game, which had a banana for a joystick.
9411997	9412998	We don't have them here anymore.
9413018	9413658	Just do a search on Yahoo.
9438863	9442244	And Jamie is over here playing with stuff.
9444825	9449347	I tried going to 3brain.com to try to find this song to play by request.
9449867	9456570	And when you click on the low HTML version of the page, it gives you a smiley face done in text.
9457550	9458971	Jamie, you were saying about those games.
9459031	9460051	Tell about the lobster game.
9460872	9461092	Whoa.
9462287	9468171	There's a site where I saw, basically, you know one of those crane games where you win stuffed animals and stuff?
9468631	9469572	They had live lobster.
9470172	9470913	This is great.
9471813	9479699	I mean, they're, you know, the claws are all taped up and you just plop in your money and if you're lucky, you'll have dinner that night.
9480239	9480719	Lobster.
9480999	9482120	It's good stuff.
9482961	9483641	How can you lose?
9483681	9486303	Yeah, it's a little inhumane, but this is Japan.
9486403	9486883	Who cares?
9488384	9488705	Really.
9489125	9489305	I do.
9491440	9493002	Um, yeah, that is a little inhumane.
9516215	9516535	A little?
9517756	9518617	Yeah, it's a little.
9518657	9519978	I mean, okay, look at this.
9520358	9521239	Walk the dog.
9523801	9525222	Why not just go out and walk the dog?
9525423	9525863	Exactly.
9525983	9532889	I guess, you know, for people who live in apartment complexes with no dogs and no pets, this is the only thing that they can really do.
9534750	9536632	They'd be remotely close to walking the dog.
9542625	9547707	We're watching Jamie go through 3Brain.com right now, and she can't find it.
9548707	9552788	The song is not up on 3Brain.com, so I'm going to have to find it a different way.
9555169	9565292	I had it probably burned off, but if all else fails, I'll try to have it for next week, for next week's little fortune cookie.
9566181	9569183	Yeah, we're needing new material for our fortune cookie.
9569623	9573286	So if anybody happens to have anything that you think is funny, save it for us.
9573446	9577709	And who knows, maybe your little comedy clip might make it on for one of our fortune cookies of the week.
9579810	9585534	But you know, there were some of those really interesting games that I really wish that they'd bring out in the U.S.
9586395	9589237	I like playing that photo game.
9590527	9592809	That photo game was cool, as I suck at it.
9592970	9593690	They have one at Burt's Place.
9603507	9604868	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
9626460	9630988	This is a bunch of different Japanese games, like the Walking the Dog game.
9631408	9633391	But the game that I want to play is Taiko War.
9635846	9638487	Tycho, for anyone who doesn't know, is a type of Japanese drumming.
9638507	9642308	You know, I've actually got two of those drums in my Animal Crossing house by my fire.
9643448	9647809	Anyway, but this is one where basically you play the drum.
9647889	9649710	You know, actually, I think it's really cool.
9650490	9653071	I don't have the links immediately with me, but I'll try to find them for next week.
9653711	9655511	Namco has done a series of music games.
9655911	9656291	Really?
9656451	9658652	They've done a guitar simulation game.
9659172	9659872	Every single one of them.
9659912	9662273	They've done... We just sued them over.
9662293	9662533	Yeah, I could...
9663135	9666198	Yeah, Dan was saying that every single which one, Konami sued them over.
9667439	9680871	But they've done a guitar game, they've done a keyboard game that actually looks like it might kick Keyboard Mania's ass, because it actually goes with music, so you have to read the music and play it.
9680951	9685214	There's an auto-harp game, if I remember correctly.
9687096	9688978	I'm still waiting for them to make Sax Maniacs.
9690100	9692022	I want Boner Freaks.
9692422	9693283	Boner Freaks.
9693543	9694624	I want Boner Freaks.
9694644	9695604	Yeah, you play Trombone.
9700048	9700728	I can't make that.
9702970	9703410	Dead.
9704031	9704731	Boner Freaks.
9705131	9705952	Stroke Mania.
9709355	9709555	Well.
9711876	9713277	I want Beat It Mania.

9759571	9761753	I'm doing a good job hosting, dammit!
9762834	9764515	I'm doing a good job!
9765555	9766636	I can't do it!
9767557	9767857	I cry.
9767877	9768878	Riverdance mania.
9769498	9771019	Riverdance mania!
9771660	9772901	Dude, no, all you have to do...
9775590	9776670	The Lord of the Dance!
9777310	9778991	I am the Führer of the Dance!
9779991	9782331	No.
9782391	9783631	River Dance Revolution.
9785452	9789132	No, um, they need the Kunio version, River City Dance Revolution.
9790793	9798894	Yeah, um, well, you know, really, if you want a River Dance to DDR, all you have to do is play, uh, Captain Jack Basic.
9801254	9802355	Uh, thank you.
9804135	9804455	But, um,
9808685	9811406	We're having some discussion here now on old school games.
9812346	9815988	River City Ransom, it's called Hot-Blooded Downtown Story.
9817748	9826171	And then there was the... Dan's just going off on making up neat little meat mania.
9828231	9828811	Meet Mania.
9832512	9836673	I'm actually imagining that now as like, you know, Iron Chef.
9836833	9841094	They should have an Iron Chef video game.
9842234	9845035	Apparently there are Iron Chef video games on Saturn.
9849296	9851917	You know what, let's go ahead and check our good friends at eBay.com.
9855478	9856318	We've got two Saturns.
9857299	9857719	Let's see.
9858339	9862622	Iron Chef Saturn.
9864122	9865263	Let's see if we find any.
9865503	9868725	No, there are none posted.
9868925	9870445	Let's look up Iron Chef Game.
9871366	9871986	I love eBay.
9873567	9875468	There are no Iron Chef Games.
9878089	9879670	Let's look up Sega Saturn.
9883018	9884659	The Greatest Game Company of All Time.
9884819	9887021	And there are none posted on right now.
9890183	9891104	We'll look up Chef.
9893545	9894726	We have South Park.
9895467	9898569	Chef's Love Shack.
9899550	9901711	And a Disney Chinese Chef Goofy.
9902292	9903973	Oh, this is cute!
9905874	9908156	Maybe Sega put it out for their plushie line.
9908176	9908316	Yeah.
9910022	9912965	Your Mom Revolution, Particle Man Revolution.
9913846	9915407	I want Triangle Freaks.
9916989	9923194	With a giant triangle and a big, like, pole, and you bang the sides of the triangle to a triangular screen.
9924916	9929960	Now, Fish Fish Revolution would be like the Swedish Chef game where you try to hit targets with a fish.
9931001	9932122	Wark, wark, wark, woo!
9932142	9933764	Wark, wark, wark!
9937896	9941858	No, that would be Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls.
9943980	9945360	Oh, Chocolate Salty Ball.
9946001	9946961	They're having a hoedown.
9947061	9947682	Yee-haw.
9950223	9953925	You know, we could just, we should actually make our own video game company.
9954906	9958828	And just, there'll be eight, Namten to come.
9960929	9963491	How about, how about, uh... I like Tengenami.
9970056	9972798	Then it would be Sonygen.
9973859	9974699	Then it would be Sonygen.
9975420	9977701	Speaking of corrupt and evil.
9978001	9979162	It was corrupt and evil.
9979222	9981804	Combine them with Sony and you have the ultimate evil empire.
9982564	9984745	And that if their games were all distributed at Fry's.
9984865	9987167	Nintendo Graphics.
9987867	9988428	What's that for?
9988448	9991850	That's for the Sega Nintendo Turbo Graphics.
9992710	9993791	Dude, I would play that.
9998443	9998784	You know.
9999424	10004910	Ross Ross Revolution.
10005090	10005630	There you go.
10006731	10007732	Wait, wait, wait.
10007772	10009514	There's nobody playing Ross but me.
10010495	10011616	Just for the record.
10011736	10014359	I am the only person that gets to play Ross.
10014459	10015760	Do you stomp to his beat?
10015800	10016661	I stomp to his beat.
10019895	10021936	Beatmania, huh?
10023877	10024517	White Revolution.
10024817	10025917	What do you think she's going to do?
10025957	10028619	Team up with the other golden girls and eat cheesecake?
10031340	10033020	Maybe one of them is going to have a heart attack?
10033881	10036722	Okay.
10037682	10039703	If we had our own video game company, what would we specialize in?
10040463	10041104	Simulations.
10044042	10049486	We would do real life sim where it's like... I want to simulate making a bowl of cereal.
10049566	10050326	Yeah, cooking.
10050367	10050987	That's what I want to say.
10051007	10051327	Cooking.
10051788	10052928	A cooking simulation.
10053629	10054049	No, no.
10054129	10055390	They actually have a game.
10056391	10060834	Again, it's another one of those goofy Japanese games where you work in a restaurant and you have to make people's orders.
10061574	10062795	Like sandwiches and stuff.
10062815	10063776	Tapper.
10063956	10066558	No, it's not... Tapper.
10067579	10073303	But no, in this game, if you don't make their order exactly the way they want it, then you lose points.
10074252	10085255	Of course, there's also the egg-flipping game that was at AI, where you flip the pan and try to catch the thing, but it was broken.
10087195	10094637	You know, that actually is another thing.
10094657	10097037	They could sell, you know they have those live dolls?
10097618	10100038	They could sell, like, the Ultimate Sim version.
10101318	10103119	Yeah, you hook it up to your Xbox.
10104346	10106488	Because the Xbox isn't good for hardly anything else anyway.
10106508	10108430	It makes a great paperweight.
10108450	10109310	It makes a great paperweight.
10109330	10110031	Jump Rope Revolution.
10110191	10111512	Jump Rope Revolution.
10114415	10118639	You know, actually, if they did a square dancing game for DDR, like, that would be cool.
10119159	10120480	Where you actually play with a partner.
10123283	10124864	You know, that would be pretty neat.
10125385	10125605	What?
10125725	10127146	Dan Dan Revolution.
10127247	10128267	I play that every day, yo.
10130618	10132540	Not Jumper Revolution, Square Dance Revolution.
10132780	10133540	No.
10134441	10136302	Grab your partner and buy the toast.
10136322	10137984	We can rent a casino.
10138324	10138424	No.
10138484	10139485	Shut up.
10139985	10145410	The redneck hit comes out.
10145430	10147691	Where's something I can throw at Dan?
10148152	10148352	What?
10148612	10149493	Throw it at Dan?
10149573	10150554	I didn't bring it up.
10151154	10152055	I know, but I can't hit you.
10152115	10153256	I can hit Dan.
10153736	10156138	And Dan blocks the cat toy with Charmander.
10156258	10157419	Charmander, I choose you.
10160241	10162202	Uh oh, Charmander's tearing up.
10162503	10163523	Cat toy revolution.
10163843	10165924	We have Shermie Shermie Mania.
10167025	10168766	Where you just sit around and pet Shermie.
10169386	10171328	And she eats and flops on the floor.
10171948	10173129	She's not stupid.
10173369	10174309	My cat is not stupid.
10174329	10174970	Cow milking.
10174990	10176270	Cow milking.
10176290	10176451	Wow.
10176711	10177531	Cow milking.
10177791	10180753	How perverted is that?
10185738	10191703	And you have to milk it in a certain rhythm so you have the bars that come down that corresponds to a different udder.
10194085	10195406	Here, I'll pull out this teat.
10195907	10196427	Squirt.
10196727	10204194	It'll end up being kind of like those stupid crab games that you have to hit the crabs before they make it across.
10204274	10205115	Whack-a-mole.
10205255	10206316	The whack-a-mole type of thing.
10207117	10211200	You have to grab the other before it moves out of the way, so you gotta keep up with the other.
10211320	10212520	That's one twitchy cow.
10212560	10215542	Give that cow some Prozac.
10216023	10218464	No, we're not having DDR upskirt revolution.
10218484	10219825	You know?
10224554	10235437	DDR Upskirt, this little weird site had a camera put in the middle of a DDR machine and had little schoolgirls dancing on it.
10235818	10237358	So it's a picture of their underwear.
10237538	10241439	Dan, you freaking pervert.
10241499	10242360	I'll find it for you.
10243140	10246281	Okay, we've had a request for DDR Upskirt cam.
10248311	10253254	Alright, someone find me a link to DDR Upskirt.
10253334	10254314	No, not 3Ds.
10255555	10257376	Upskirt.
10259958	10261218	I'm going to do a search for this.
10262639	10264220	DDR Upskirt.
10265881	10267662	I can't believe I'm doing a search for this.
10268362	10274546	Yeah, people look on the list of everything that I've been looking up.
10274646	10276307	Oh, we find Lolita Preteen Sax.
10276327	10276367	Oh!
10279185	10283948	Um... Maybe this is it?
10286490	10287270	No, that's not it.
10291773	10293794	GDR Manskirt Revolution!
10294214	10295475	No, that would be Kilt Freaks.
10297977	10298737	Kilt Mania!
10301379	10302099	Bagpipes.
10302759	10303340	Yeah.
10303360	10304500	That would be bad.
10306405	10307626	We're not having Yu-Gi-Oh!
10307666	10309227	Revolution, by the way, because Yu-Gi-Oh!
10309467	10309967	sucks.
10310387	10311728	No, we're not having Dildo Revolution.
10311768	10313189	No, we need, Ross needs to see the upskirt cam.
10313209	10315670	Jessica says he doesn't.
10315750	10316511	It does exist.
10316591	10318492	Okay, I don't know, no, that one's down, thank God.
10335586	10339649	Okay, we found the live sex cam and free pick amateurs with DVD tits.
10341651	10342211	Yeah.
10343372	10344133	Banana boobs!
10344433	10345674	Banana boobs!
10345995	10347476	Banana boobs!
10347516	10352860	Banana boobs.com Ah, shit!
10353341	10354181	I lost it.
10355042	10357124	No, we're not going to the banana boobs.
10357264	10358765	Oh, banana boobs is so funny.
10363172	10366675	BananaBoobs.com Didn't we say this show was adult?
10370398	10378504	But no, they, uh... This is not M-rated.
10379725	10385970	Those are the ugliest boobs in the world.
10386871	10389453	Dan wants to use his adult check code password.
10390931	10394178	Anyway, you know what, I think that's a bit much for the boobs.
10394498	10397444	No, we're not going to the Goatsy site, thank you very much.
10397464	10398426	Goatsy CX.
10399107	10399829	You know what that is?
10400029	10402153	It's the one of the ass.
10403657	10431583	the stretched open ass so we as moderators on DDR Freak have seen quite a bit that we've seen that about 5 billion times before it's old get over it, learn something new on the internet, thank you there is the pay picture find me the DDR upskirt um he wants to see the mulletsgalore.com
10436905	10439127	Dan said it would only be awesome if Solid Snake is there.
10439607	10442570	Which, uh, you know, actually they did make a mention of that on Naked Tokyo.
10445052	10446112	Anyway, guess what?
10446533	10448975	It's about that time, so we're gonna go off and look for porn.
10450056	10451196	So, uh, prawn.
10452458	10454039	We don't need seafood, Dan.
10454059	10455240	Dude, prawns are awesome.
10456861	10458562	We do not need DDR lesbian porn.
10459442	10464145	Anyway, that's it for this little lovely bit of train wreck.
10464245	10466265	So, soiree.
10467286	10468947	Yes, this is a soiree.
10469247	10472608	Anyway, we're going to go because we have other stuff to do.
10473128	10475769	So, do you have any final thoughts?
10475850	10477350	Let's start with the farthest away, Dan.
10480472	10480672	No.
10482913	10483613	I second that, no.
10484525	10486227	I'm going to go play Ross Ross Revolution.
10489191	10491775	I said thoughts as if any of us are busy thinking.
10493177	10498964	Anyway, my final thought is if you want to have an upskirt cam, be sneaky.
10499164	10499385	Bye.
10501764	10504766	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

10521775	10525237	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
10525657	10530340	And now, the buffoons date at the drive-in with the school's valedictorian.
10532276	10534157	I really appreciate your asking me out.
10534557	10537399	Most people are intimidated by my high academic achievement.
10538720	10540440	This movie sucks shit!
10541861	10545203	Well, Eber gave it thumbs up, but Siskel thought it was too preachy.
10545583	10547945	Anyway, I enjoyed the director's last film immensely.
10549725	10552447	Kathleen Turner has big fucking tits!
10553748	10556129	Yes, well, she recently had a child.
10556209	10558670	I think her maternal biology may play a role in that.
10559591	10561612	She looks fabulous for a woman her age, doesn't she?
10563647	10567589	I had a firecracker in a bullfrog's mouth and blew his fucking head off.
10568409	10574973	Well, in psychology we learn that it's not uncommon for male adolescents to commit savage acts on animals as part of their maturing process.
10577094	10581756	That girl in the fucking car in front of us, she gives everybody head.
10583277	10587459	Well, I guess she's starved for attention and she feels promiscuity is the only way to obtain it.
10590114	10592355	These popcorn's fucking terrible!
10592895	10595055	It tastes like someone jizzed all over it!
10596215	10598976	Well, the thought of semen on this popcorn is certainly disturbing.
10599696	10605297	Perhaps the staff in the refreshment stand was overcome by the monotony of their work and decided to play a childish prank.
10606578	10608998	I looked at my asshole in the mirror today!
10610579	10612419	It blew my fucking mind!
10614187	10619790	It's ironic that parts of one's own body can seem odd and unusual because you don't see them on a day-to-day basis.
10621351	10625112	My father's shit stinks up the bathroom all fucking day.
10626333	10630275	It's puzzling why one person's fecal odor can be more overpowering than another's.
10631195	10636098	I wonder whether it is a function of the food digested or that person's internal metabolism.
10637158	10640100	I'm gonna go get head from that fucking girl.
10641573	10648867	While I'm sorry to see the date come to such an abrupt conclusion, I do appreciate the time you've spent with me and look forward to a future rendezvous.
10649828	10652453	I like to piss in that guy's fucking gas tank!
10652594	10653635	Bye-bye, have fun.
10657222	10672531	And another addition to this little fortune cookie message, if you go to understudationlive.org, you can see the news there that Understudation Live is going to be returning on January 11th, so grab the details there, and I now return you to the rest of the outro.
10674172	10677894	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
