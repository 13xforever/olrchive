1
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:08,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:15,576
[SPEAKER_24]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

3
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:22,177
[SPEAKER_24]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

4
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:25,678
[SPEAKER_24]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

5
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:29,038
[SPEAKER_24]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

6
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:32,399
[SPEAKER_24]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

7
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:33,620
[SPEAKER_29]: Just kidding.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,400
[SPEAKER_29]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,001
[SPEAKER_29]: In this episode... Hey, are there any boars down there?

10
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:40,361
That's the biggest fairy I've ever seen, Tinkle Fairy.

11
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,462
[SPEAKER_17]: What's your favorite security movie?

12
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:49,679
[SPEAKER_19]: Showgirls.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolute fright.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,780
[SPEAKER_08]: What's yours?

15
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:55,281
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

16
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:57,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't torture yourself.

17
00:00:57,242 --> 00:00:58,023
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my job.

18
00:00:58,163 --> 00:00:59,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Now's the time where Spock can send me dogs!

19
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:03,165
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll get you, my pretty.

20
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:04,685
[SPEAKER_19]: And your little dog, too.

21
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:05,906
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Kung Fu.

22
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,727
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

23
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did they have to take the word gang?

24
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:14,949
[SPEAKER_17]: No one expects a punishing position.

25
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,250
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Kendo.

26
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:16,490
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey!

27
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:21,174
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,

28
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:46,379
S, Actdeft,

29
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

30
00:02:57,538 --> 00:02:58,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching.

31
00:02:58,539 --> 00:02:59,399
[SPEAKER_14]: See you next time.

32
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:25,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

33
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,395
Thank you for watching!

34
00:04:37,282 --> 00:04:38,606
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

35
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:33,289
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a microphone check, and apparently the microphone is finally working.

36
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:34,929
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we had it plugged into the wrong place.

37
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,650
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, sorry about the dead air earlier.

38
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,310
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're going to do the intro again.

39
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:38,891
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay!

40
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:41,331
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, we're live!

41
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:42,972
[SPEAKER_27]: Or something like that.

42
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:45,052
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe I'm dead, I don't know.

43
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:46,173
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I'm alive.

44
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:47,993
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, I'm alive.

45
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:50,174
[SPEAKER_27]: They said that I was alive, so I guess I am.

46
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:52,934
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, it's December 29th, 2002.

47
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:54,535
[SPEAKER_27]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

48
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:55,955
[SPEAKER_27]: This is sort of episode 26.

49
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:56,295
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, uh...

50
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:03,616
[SPEAKER_27]: Two-thirds of our little group is sort of not here.

51
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:11,957
[SPEAKER_27]: Rob and Matt, sorry, Sky and Loki, they are currently in the car all the way back from Southern California because they went and didn't bring me.

52
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:14,818
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I was working, you know, kind of need to make money.

53
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:19,899
[SPEAKER_27]: So they might have a little bit of a dedication during the FUs of the week.

54
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:25,980
[SPEAKER_27]: I've got two special guests with me in the studio, I guess, today.

55
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,020
[SPEAKER_27]: Let me go ahead and...

56
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:30,805
[SPEAKER_27]: Do a little introduction again.

57
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:35,269
[SPEAKER_27]: We have with us in studio Jessica and Ross, also known as Iguana Girl and Islander.

58
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:37,030
[SPEAKER_27]: So have them say a couple words.

59
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:43,335
[SPEAKER_28]: Yo, yo, Step Squad representing in this biz match.

60
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:49,379
[SPEAKER_29]: I really can't come up with anything after that marvelous intro.

61
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,520
[SPEAKER_29]: So hello, people.

62
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,020
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's go ahead.

63
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:51,541
[SPEAKER_29]: What's going on?

64
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:57,200
[SPEAKER_27]: And, uh, that's, uh, that was stunning.

65
00:06:57,481 --> 00:06:57,882
[SPEAKER_27]: Beautiful.

66
00:06:58,263 --> 00:06:59,266
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay!

67
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,089
[SPEAKER_27]: Wee!

68
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:01,432
[SPEAKER_27]: I had to get my eyebrows.

69
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,289
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's go ahead and give shouts out.

70
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:06,750
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, again, Step Squad, of course.

71
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,450
[SPEAKER_27]: And hello to everybody in the chat room.

72
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,611
[SPEAKER_27]: For anybody who is tuning in and has never even heard of our chat room, what hole have you been living in?

73
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:20,233
[SPEAKER_27]: You can find our chat room at orangelounge.skie.cx.

76
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:25,934
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway...

77
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:31,136
[SPEAKER_27]: I had just got done playing a song from Drum Mania, which was Miss You.

78
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:35,679
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, a bunch of people probably know it from the English lyric version right on time.

79
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:47,965
[SPEAKER_27]: But we're going to go and play a song from Dance Mania Bass 10 and a song that's going to be in DDR Extreme called Speed Over Beethoven and something from Parappa.

80
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:48,886
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's go old school.

81
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,667
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's it for now.

00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,590
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't touch this You can't touch this

You can go on to the next stage now.

91
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,061
Yahoo!

92
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:22,301
Alright!

93
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:51,340
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back from our little break and what you heard was, uh, yes, Bach.

94
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,922
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not Bach, Beethoven.

95
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:54,543
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh.

96
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:34,793
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, what we, uh, had playing there is, um, to go ahead and clarify what I said, I said we were gonna play a song from, uh, Dance Mania Bass, and then a song from, uh, uh, DVR Extreme, which I actually even said the name, it was Speed Over Beethoven, but the first one we played was, um, You Can't Touch This, it was the bass mix from, uh, Dance Mania Bass 10, and then the last one we heard is Chop Chop Master Onions Rap, the first level of Parappa the Rapper.

97
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:35,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

98
00:16:36,974 --> 00:16:38,375
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, anyway, uh,

99
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,984
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sure that about everybody is familiar with DDR Extreme being released on Christmas Day.

100
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:57,772
[SPEAKER_27]: And we even said that we didn't think it would be because who would have thought that it would have been so important in Japan to release a game on a holiday that's basically just a commercial holiday there.

101
00:16:57,832 --> 00:17:01,975
[SPEAKER_27]: But apparently it was released and hopefully we'll be seeing that stateside.

102
00:17:01,995 --> 00:17:06,958
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course, whenever we get an update of what locations have that, we'll be letting everyone know.

103
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:10,262
[SPEAKER_27]: Unfortunately, there's no official update yet.

104
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:12,307
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway...

105
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:20,415
[SPEAKER_27]: But we've got some information on DDR Extreme actually taken directly from Konami's site.

106
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:27,761
[SPEAKER_27]: You can find the information at www.konami.co.jp slash am slash ddr slash extreme.

107
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:40,190
[SPEAKER_27]: The new songs that are going to be in DDR Extreme, we have a Cartoon Heroes Speedy Mix, I Do, I Do, I Do, Irresistible,

108
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,151
[SPEAKER_27]: La Copa de la Vida

109
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:06,977
[SPEAKER_27]: Then we have Speed Over Beethoven, which I just played.

110
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:11,320
[SPEAKER_27]: Scenery the Speedy Mix, Jenny Wong, which should make JB very, very happy.

111
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:14,243
[SPEAKER_27]: We Are the Champions, Factory Team Remix.

112
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:16,325
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm hoping that they didn't redo Queen.

113
00:18:16,465 --> 00:18:22,750
[SPEAKER_12]: We are the champions, my friends.

114
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,391
[SPEAKER_27]: Then we have We Will Rock You.

115
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:26,053
[SPEAKER_27]: I guess they are going for a Queen theme.

116
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:32,118
[SPEAKER_12]: And we keep on fighting to the end.

117
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:38,642
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, you know, I thought that it would be bad enough after that horrible version of Killer Queen.

118
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:45,566
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, at least the music part was right, but whoever they had singing that just needed to be shot or fried or something.

119
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:46,106
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

120
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,247
[SPEAKER_29]: Fried would be nice.

121
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:52,330
[SPEAKER_27]: No, shot, and then as they're bleeding to death, they fry so that they bleed fast.

122
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:52,870
[SPEAKER_27]: Deep fry.

123
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,272
[SPEAKER_28]: Deep fry them so that you can, like, eat them like a Twinkie.

124
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:58,474
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, we dip them in batter and then put powdered sugar on them when they're done.

125
00:18:58,994 --> 00:18:59,854
[SPEAKER_27]: That was a good suggestion.

126
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:00,795
[SPEAKER_28]: See, there you go.

127
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,169
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry about the microphone.

128
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:05,250
[SPEAKER_28]: Stop your microphone.

129
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:11,154
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, another thing we have, we have 1998, Naoki.

130
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:13,275
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know if anyone's seen it.

131
00:19:13,296 --> 00:19:20,861
[SPEAKER_27]: There actually has been a picture floating around of a, there's a desktop available for people who have seen it of the Mecca from Brilliant to You.

132
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:23,962
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually knew who happens to read my live journal.

133
00:19:24,383 --> 00:19:28,925
[SPEAKER_27]: You see a picture of that mecha that was taken from a background that was made for 1998.

134
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:32,367
[SPEAKER_27]: Then we have Bag by Revenge.

135
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:36,610
[SPEAKER_27]: Graduation, I'm not even going to bother to try reading the...

136
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,613
[SPEAKER_27]: Hiragana, because right now I can't make my brain think in Japanese.

137
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:44,634
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's B for you, so it's gotta suck.

138
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,760
[SPEAKER_27]: Then we have Hyper Eurobeat, Naoki featuring DDR All-Stars.

139
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,842
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, it's not Paula Terry, rejoice!

140
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:54,503
[SPEAKER_28]: Yay!

141
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:56,125
[SPEAKER_28]: Ooh, it's Eurobeat.

142
00:19:56,385 --> 00:20:01,830
[SPEAKER_27]: Then we have Love Shine, Paranoia Survivor, Tears, which is Naoki Underground.

143
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,053
[SPEAKER_27]: I've noticed Naoki Underground stuff is a little bit better than the usual stuff.

144
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,567
[SPEAKER_27]: The Legend of Max by ZZ, Trip Machine Survivor.

145
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:10,588
[SPEAKER_27]: More Trip Machine.

146
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:12,029
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay.

147
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,451
[SPEAKER_27]: Crash, Mr. Brian and the Final Band.

148
00:20:17,012 --> 00:20:18,253
[SPEAKER_28]: What happened to the band before?

149
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:21,074
[SPEAKER_27]: I think they were sacked.

150
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:23,616
[SPEAKER_27]: They were deep fried.

151
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:27,058
[SPEAKER_27]: They were deep fried like a Twinkie and eaten by cannibals.

152
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:29,679
[SPEAKER_28]: Just another great treat from Orange Lounge Radio.

153
00:20:31,937 --> 00:20:38,262
[SPEAKER_27]: They were taken to the island of eyeball-eating cannibals, like the one who stole my Animal Crossing character's eyes.

154
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:41,085
[SPEAKER_27]: But that was last week.

155
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:41,865
[SPEAKER_27]: We have... Ah!

156
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:43,327
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry.

157
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:47,190
[SPEAKER_27]: Politeary!

158
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:50,933
[SPEAKER_27]: At least Memories isn't a bad song, and she sort of holds the key there.

159
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:52,254
[SPEAKER_27]: She usually doesn't.

160
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,737
[SPEAKER_27]: Then we have Vanity Angel, which we've probably played on here before.

161
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:57,559
[SPEAKER_27]: If not, I'll see if I can sneak that in later.

162
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,361
[SPEAKER_27]: and 3P303 Bass Mix, which we've all heard if we bought Konomics.

163
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:04,482
[SPEAKER_27]: Cutie Chaser Morning Mix.

164
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:06,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Yay, Cutie Chaser!

165
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:07,563
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's the good one.

166
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:08,823
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the one from Ohasta.

167
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:10,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it right.

168
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:20,087
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a Do It Right Harmonized Two-Step Mix.

169
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,427
[SPEAKER_29]: From the American Macs.

170
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:23,274
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, from the American Max.

171
00:21:23,694 --> 00:21:25,656
[SPEAKER_27]: We have Drop the Bomb System SF Mix.

172
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:29,079
[SPEAKER_27]: Pretty cool that we got these songs before Japan did, don't you think?

173
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,741
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, actually, that's really cool.

174
00:21:31,305 --> 00:21:32,026
[SPEAKER_27]: It's because we kick ass.

175
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:32,946
[SPEAKER_27]: That's fucking right.

176
00:21:32,986 --> 00:21:36,349
[SPEAKER_27]: But then again, you know, they had everything first and we had to wait.

177
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,890
[SPEAKER_27]: It's about time.

178
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:38,771
[SPEAKER_27]: It's about time we got some.

179
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,893
[SPEAKER_28]: It's kind of like the Bay Area versus Sacramento.

180
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:42,494
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, we have A-Style now.

181
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:42,995
[SPEAKER_27]: We're happy.

182
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,357
[SPEAKER_27]: And we have it on a nice plasma screen.

183
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:48,079
[SPEAKER_27]: Where the videos actually work.

184
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:49,580
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, the videos work too.

185
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,982
[SPEAKER_27]: I was rather enjoying looking at some of those videos.

186
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:52,322
[SPEAKER_27]: Weren't you?

187
00:21:52,903 --> 00:21:53,303
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yes.

188
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:55,044
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, the videos were quite enjoyable.

189
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:55,465
[SPEAKER_28]: Except for...

190
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:56,552
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura

191
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,031
[SPEAKER_27]: Colors for Extreme.

192
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:22,432
[SPEAKER_27]: I guess that's probably a redone version just for DDR.

193
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:23,953
[SPEAKER_27]: We have Happy Wedding, which makes me happy.

194
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:26,934
[SPEAKER_28]: All of that song's balls can die for all I care.

195
00:22:27,355 --> 00:22:28,035
[SPEAKER_27]: What, Happy Wedding?

196
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:28,315
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

197
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:29,736
[SPEAKER_27]: Why?

198
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:31,117
[SPEAKER_27]: Why does Happy Wedding need to die?

199
00:22:31,257 --> 00:22:35,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy, happy, happy, happy wedding!

200
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:39,381
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, you know, Ryan has a problem with that for a different reason.

201
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,002
[SPEAKER_27]: Let me actually pass off the mic for a second.

202
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:56,559
[SPEAKER_28]: Going on with the list, we have Namor e la Liberté, which is actually a DDR version of a 2DX song that was on 7th style.

203
00:22:57,439 --> 00:23:00,001
[SPEAKER_28]: And then we have Stoic Extreme version.

204
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:01,462
[SPEAKER_28]: Apparently they're doing a whole new version.

205
00:23:01,662 --> 00:23:03,603
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, that's another 2DX song.

206
00:23:04,204 --> 00:23:05,865
[SPEAKER_28]: There's V for Extreme.

207
00:23:08,606 --> 00:23:09,667
[SPEAKER_28]: Most people know what V is.

208
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:12,329
[SPEAKER_28]: That's coming from 5th style.

209
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:12,429
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

210
00:23:13,886 --> 00:23:15,447
[SPEAKER_28]: I have no idea what that song is.

211
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:21,508
[SPEAKER_28]: I have no idea because it's in the... Go translate that for me, Jamie.

212
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:23,329
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't remember which that is.

213
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:24,589
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what?

214
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:25,769
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to do something here.

215
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:30,911
[SPEAKER_27]: It's going to take us just a minute to go ahead and... No, Babelfish sucks.

216
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:33,211
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry for whoever just dropped.

217
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:33,692
[SPEAKER_27]: My bad.

218
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,093
[SPEAKER_27]: Oops.

219
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:41,934
[SPEAKER_27]: We love you anyway.

220
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:47,111
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to a little site called At Nifty Global Gate.

221
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:49,672
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a really good little translation site.

222
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:57,254
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to do this to translate all of that lovely kanji that I can't read because I can only read five kanji.

223
00:23:57,514 --> 00:23:59,315
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I read about 40 kanji maybe.

224
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:03,076
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, back to... Was this the one?

225
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:11,407
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, it's a Naoki song featuring Yuki, and by the way, chat room, I'm not really paying attention because I sort of have to manage the show, my bad.

226
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,351
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's incorrect.

227
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:16,451
[SPEAKER_27]: That's not a URL.

228
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:17,773
[SPEAKER_27]: No, it's not a URL.

229
00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:18,894
[SPEAKER_27]: Goddamn.

230
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:22,997
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, this is lovely radio.

231
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:26,220
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, it means a blue impulse.

232
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:29,222
[SPEAKER_28]: A blue impulse.

233
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:31,044
[SPEAKER_28]: It's better than, you know, like a white creamy one.

234
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:34,019
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Nostelon, for announcing your bathroom break, by the way.

235
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,261
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, back to the list.

[SPEAKER_27]: We have Jet World, which we like Jet World.

240
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:53,292
[SPEAKER_27]: Jet World's a cool song.

241
00:24:53,332 --> 00:25:00,017
[SPEAKER_27]: We have another one that I recognize the first kanji as being a three, but we're going to go ahead and run that through translator as well.

242
00:25:00,037 --> 00:25:00,477
[SPEAKER_27]: It's part of three.

243
00:25:02,176 --> 00:25:20,337
[SPEAKER_27]: We have Tortoiseshell Catlock, which, Tortoiseshell Catlock, this is what it translates to, and then the group that does it is called Subtropical Muzzy Sky Bomb.

[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_28]: It's the 11th of January.

286
00:29:19,266 --> 00:29:21,087
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a tournament at Fremont.

[SPEAKER_28]: It's Funtime Pizza in Fremont, and if you're in the Bay Area or in Sacramento area or anywhere in NorCal, you probably know where it is.

291
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:38,898
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe it starts around 11 or noon.

292
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:40,739
[SPEAKER_28]: You can check out the details.

293
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:44,141
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a thread on it on ddrfreak.com.

294
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:51,388
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, and you can get linked to the Killer Pals site, which is who is putting this on.

295
00:29:52,089 --> 00:30:05,183
[SPEAKER_28]: So, um, it's looking like it's going to have Perfect Attack, um, Freestyle, and then also Freshness Freestyle, which is basically something kind of from the, from the

296
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:08,345
[SPEAKER_28]: from the Shaft A-Team Freestyle type of thing.

297
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:10,346
[SPEAKER_28]: So it should be a good time on that.

298
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:18,651
[SPEAKER_28]: I would imagine that your best bet, though, would be to get the information from the site because I'm just remembering what I can remember off the top of my head.

299
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:23,794
[SPEAKER_28]: But Jamie is getting us set for our next break.

300
00:30:25,915 --> 00:30:27,876
[SPEAKER_28]: And she's trying to find some neat stuff.

301
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:34,600
[SPEAKER_28]: We're actually taking over the airwaves because we've decided that...

302
00:30:36,238 --> 00:30:37,200
[SPEAKER_28]: Korean Time

303
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,332
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, it's Big Booty Fun here on Originals Radio.

304
00:30:56,352 --> 00:30:59,134
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to play what I have immediately available, but you never know.

305
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:04,777
[SPEAKER_27]: I might be playing, you know, even more bootylicious stuff here during one of our upcoming breaks.

306
00:31:04,817 --> 00:31:07,618
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're going to get a break to gather ourselves.

307
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:11,200
[SPEAKER_27]: So the first thing you get is Tashani with a Gungo, also known as Caution.

308
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,202
[SPEAKER_27]: And please don't Caution drop it in your chair, because you could break it.

309
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:16,002
[SPEAKER_27]: It would hurt.

310
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:18,784
[SPEAKER_27]: It would hurt a lot, so here goes.

311
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:22,238
[SPEAKER_13]: B-Boost, I don't have a flat You can't stop me from smiling, Bonnie and Clyde Number 1, 2, 3, go, until the end of the night Your next chance is over, I told you It's easy to make you cry, it's like you don't want it I know what you did, now you're like another Now I'm the one who's coming, my lover Say goodbye to my baby one week, past you

312
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:37,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

313
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,707
[SPEAKER_22]: and 99, Prime Time Shine, baby hit me one more time

00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:49,668
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

315
00:35:27,402 --> 00:35:27,837
Thanks for watching!

316
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:10,927
[SPEAKER_14]: I miss you.

317
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:11,911
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm waiting for you.

318
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:12,994
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm waiting for you.

319
00:37:13,095 --> 00:37:14,159
[SPEAKER_14]: I miss you.

320
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:14,660
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss you.

321
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,281
Are you ready?

322
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:19,021
Let the music begin!

323
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:19,902
You move, move it!

324
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:54,138
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you hear the cheering?

325
00:39:54,278 --> 00:39:54,919
Super Performance!

326
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,535
Thanks for watching!

327
00:41:01,152 --> 00:41:01,813
Thanks for watching!

328
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:27,351
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.

329
00:44:27,712 --> 00:44:32,633
[SPEAKER_25]: And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

330
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:39,435
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

331
00:44:39,795 --> 00:44:41,676
[SPEAKER_26]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

332
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:46,617
[SPEAKER_26]: Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

333
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,672
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we're back live.

334
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:57,239
[SPEAKER_27]: That was a collection of some stuff from DDR, third mix, Korean version.

335
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,804
[SPEAKER_27]: We had Gagai by Sharp, which was the second song.

336
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:02,826
[SPEAKER_27]: The first one we played was Tashani with Caution.

337
00:45:03,547 --> 00:45:06,891
[SPEAKER_27]: I see that we had a few people caution dropping after I warned them not to.

338
00:45:08,492 --> 00:45:08,893
[SPEAKER_27]: Excuse me.

339
00:45:10,256 --> 00:45:17,358
[SPEAKER_27]: We also had from DDR Euromix 2 and also going to be in DDR Extreme, Vanity Angel.

340
00:45:18,158 --> 00:45:22,719
[SPEAKER_27]: And then just for the hell of it, Erotic with Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex.

341
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,020
[SPEAKER_27]: So that was it.

342
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:29,521
[SPEAKER_27]: We went ahead and did a little bit of research on new releases in the Beimani world.

343
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:38,944
[SPEAKER_27]: We also have the release of Pop Music 9, which I actually can't exactly find a date on, but there is some new stuff being incorporated into that game.

344
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:47,069
[SPEAKER_27]: According to the official Konami Papa Music 9, there's a few new modes introduced.

345
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:55,775
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually just posted a link to that page in chat, although unless you're fluent in Japanese or have a good translation program, you won't be able to really make any understanding of it.

346
00:45:56,335 --> 00:46:04,459
[SPEAKER_27]: But one of the things that they mention in there is called Osasume Mode, which is basically easy mode.

347
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:15,925
[SPEAKER_27]: You're given an option when you start the game to say yes or no, and you can basically play the first level as bad as you want to without failing, which is good for the newbies, I guess.

348
00:46:16,745 --> 00:46:23,710
[SPEAKER_27]: and then another neat thing, and they've actually got a few of the cards shown on the site, memory cards for pop and music.

349
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:32,376
[SPEAKER_27]: I guess it works similar to like the ones in the initial deracing game in Derby Owner's Club for all the crack, you know, sorry, horse addicts, I should say.

350
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:40,061
[SPEAKER_27]: Like somebody in this room that I'm not looking directly at and pointing to, and another person...

351
00:46:41,782 --> 00:46:46,665
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, but, uh, apparently you can save your settings or game data on the card.

352
00:46:47,266 --> 00:46:50,188
[SPEAKER_27]: I could read this in the really bad English that my translator put it.

353
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:58,313
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, well, just to give this a skim over, it basically says that you can save an expert course, the one that you design yourself.

354
00:46:59,434 --> 00:47:06,979
[SPEAKER_27]: And, um, it says that it is convenient, and the game becomes pleasant further, even if it takes, right or wrong, an entry card using playing.

355
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:15,960
[SPEAKER_27]: That automatic registration will be made to the internet ranking if it plays using a Poppin Music 9 entry card.

356
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,120
[SPEAKER_27]: And.

357
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,842
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I am reading!

358
00:47:22,555 --> 00:47:25,856
[SPEAKER_27]: I am reading directly from the page here.

359
00:47:26,057 --> 00:47:27,737
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, it says Hata and.

360
00:47:28,998 --> 00:47:31,959
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, so there's some new options.

361
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:41,783
[SPEAKER_27]: Wouldn't it be cool if they did that for DDR or let you program your own Oni courses at home and then bring your card in and play it on the machine?

362
00:47:42,003 --> 00:47:43,744
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, what type of stuff would you pick?

363
00:47:45,805 --> 00:47:55,014
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I'm thinking it might be even better, you know, because we already have memory card slots that we use regularly that we have to actually pay for ourselves.

364
00:47:55,935 --> 00:48:03,202
[SPEAKER_28]: It would just be, you know, this great technology out there right now with this type of card system that they're just now starting to get into with Konami.

365
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:04,935
[SPEAKER_28]: It's cheap.

366
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:10,622
[SPEAKER_28]: You just toss in a buck or whatever and it pays for the card and it saves everything for you.

367
00:48:10,662 --> 00:48:11,863
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, why the heck not use it?

368
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:17,570
[SPEAKER_28]: It saves from having to have big, huge, expensive memory card slots.

369
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,212
[SPEAKER_28]: Instead, you just have a card reader and that's it.

370
00:48:21,747 --> 00:48:27,410
[SPEAKER_27]: What they used to have, though, back in the day, I don't know if anyone ever watched the old, I think it was the GamePro show that used to come on.

371
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,531
[SPEAKER_27]: It had that guy hosting anyway.

372
00:48:30,892 --> 00:48:38,555
[SPEAKER_27]: They had, when they were showing the NeoGeo system way back when, the cartridge system, which, you see those big things?

373
00:48:39,256 --> 00:48:40,657
[SPEAKER_27]: Those are NeoGeo cartridges.

374
00:48:40,677 --> 00:48:41,137
[SPEAKER_27]: They're huge.

375
00:48:41,497 --> 00:48:43,478
[SPEAKER_27]: They're basically the arcade game cartridges.

376
00:48:44,198 --> 00:48:49,040
[SPEAKER_27]: And they had a card that you could take and put in on the Neo Geo Arcade system.

377
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,581
[SPEAKER_27]: Come home and play the same game on your AES.

378
00:48:52,401 --> 00:48:56,882
[SPEAKER_27]: And you could start from where you left off in theory.

379
00:48:57,462 --> 00:49:01,244
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's hard to find any of those that still have the cards.

380
00:49:01,904 --> 00:49:02,344
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you okay?

381
00:49:04,505 --> 00:49:05,345
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry about the chair.

382
00:49:06,105 --> 00:49:08,586
[SPEAKER_27]: I have a chair in here that's trying to systematically kill Ross.

383
00:49:09,026 --> 00:49:09,406
[SPEAKER_27]: My bad.

384
00:49:10,787 --> 00:49:11,647
Yeah, straddle on.

385
00:49:12,853 --> 00:49:14,234
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you there?

386
00:49:14,654 --> 00:49:16,254
[SPEAKER_27]: He's traveling the chair.

387
00:49:17,315 --> 00:49:20,896
[SPEAKER_27]: No, this isn't liked by his girlfriend's suggestion.

388
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:21,076
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

389
00:49:23,317 --> 00:49:28,999
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, I was suggesting, you know, keep an eye open for those Neo Geo machines.

390
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:30,419
[SPEAKER_27]: You can see those card slots on them.

391
00:49:30,459 --> 00:49:32,840
[SPEAKER_27]: But, you know, they could do that same thing.

392
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,741
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like you were saying, they're cheap.

393
00:49:35,661 --> 00:49:40,223
[SPEAKER_27]: If they brought out a new home system that incorporated those little cards, you could save your data that way, too.

394
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:42,079
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, J.D.

395
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:42,400
[SPEAKER_27]: Roth.

396
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:42,720
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

397
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,460
[SPEAKER_27]: That's who it was.

398
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:44,941
[SPEAKER_27]: J.D.

399
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:45,382
[SPEAKER_27]: Roth?

400
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,823
[SPEAKER_27]: No, he did Funhaus.

401
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:49,424
[SPEAKER_22]: J.D.

402
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:50,385
[SPEAKER_27]: Roth did Funhaus.

403
00:49:51,973 --> 00:49:54,374
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, he was dumb.

404
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:23,829
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, no, we're not having Mr. Spanky's masturbation party.

405
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:34,034
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, okay, Mr. Spanky, I mentioned what Mr. Spanky is.

406
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:37,016
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Spanky comes on and gives sex tips on our show.

407
00:50:37,656 --> 00:50:38,977
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, really now?

408
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,118
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you think he might have a temperature for me?

409
00:50:41,578 --> 00:50:43,579
[SPEAKER_27]: He told us how to have a masturbation party.

410
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:44,580
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, really?

411
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,241
[SPEAKER_27]: Make sure you have plenty of latex.

412
00:50:48,065 --> 00:50:49,806
[SPEAKER_27]: That earned a burp from Jessica.

413
00:50:53,288 --> 00:50:56,570
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, the Neo Geo also has an outlet that you can plug your headphones in.

414
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:06,334
[SPEAKER_27]: That burp was brought to us just for Travis from Jessica as a token of her extreme belting.

415
00:51:06,394 --> 00:51:06,755
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway.

416
00:51:14,108 --> 00:51:17,610
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, heaven forbid that I make anybody think about anything.

417
00:51:18,571 --> 00:51:24,574
[SPEAKER_27]: But back to the subject at hand, you know, Konami is finally incorporating this.

418
00:51:24,594 --> 00:51:26,055
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, what if they start doing this for 2DX?

419
00:51:27,645 --> 00:51:28,266
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

420
00:51:44,671 --> 00:51:45,272
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

421
00:51:59,165 --> 00:52:01,946
[SPEAKER_27]: So technically, the GameCube has a way to read those cards.

422
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:10,570
[SPEAKER_27]: And if they could do it that way, there's no reason that Konami should be able to do that.

423
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:16,372
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe they'll release something for the WonderSwan and have the WonderSwan compatible with the PS2.

424
00:52:16,412 --> 00:52:18,233
[SPEAKER_27]: That would make them some money right there.

425
00:52:19,293 --> 00:52:20,013
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's a thought.

426
00:52:20,073 --> 00:52:20,934
[SPEAKER_27]: Think about it, Konami.

427
00:52:22,074 --> 00:52:25,175
[SPEAKER_27]: And then again, like anyone, Konami's actually listening to us right now.

428
00:52:28,422 --> 00:52:28,922
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

429
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:08,563
[SPEAKER_27]: Remember, I'm not going to read anything unless it's over a private message, and go ahead and you can email that to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com, which is all up and ready for me to check on.

430
00:53:09,224 --> 00:53:19,592
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I'll tell you what, even though I can't, you know, play it while we're actually doing the Fuck You's of the Week...

431
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:27,232
[SPEAKER_27]: We're gonna pick songs for everyone's Fuck Yous of the Week, but because I'm special, I'm gonna go ahead and pick mine.

432
00:53:28,092 --> 00:53:29,813
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I always use the same song every week.

433
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:33,834
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, we'll go ahead and get this started, and the next song we're gonna pick is Jessica's song.

434
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:35,675
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a surprise, though.

435
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:43,377
[SPEAKER_27]: She gets a song, and then we'll have Ross's pick, and then we'll come back, so everybody starts sending me the, uh, F Yous of the Week.

436
00:53:44,198 --> 00:53:47,499
[SPEAKER_27]: And if you don't send them, I don't read them, because I can't read something that doesn't exist.

437
00:53:49,841 --> 00:53:50,763
[SPEAKER_27]: You can make one up, though.

438
00:53:50,783 --> 00:53:51,564
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I can make one up.

439
00:53:52,085 --> 00:53:55,652
[SPEAKER_27]: But anyway, let's go ahead and get this started.

440
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:56,614
[SPEAKER_27]: So send them now.

441
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:57,536
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, now.

442
00:53:57,977 --> 00:53:59,600
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, now, now, now, now, now, now.

443
00:54:00,221 --> 00:54:00,742
[SPEAKER_27]: Five minutes ago.

444
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:56,613
Thanks for watching!

445
00:57:53,322 --> 00:57:56,022
When you say you do, baby, I love you, I just can't resist

446
00:58:33,085 --> 00:58:37,574
[SPEAKER_14]: All you need is my arm, fill me with the joy, I can't say no now

447
00:59:23,632 --> 00:59:25,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

448
00:59:56,921 --> 00:59:56,941
[SPEAKER_14]: S,

449
01:02:21,983 --> 01:02:22,888
Thank you for watching!

450
01:03:26,274 --> 01:03:42,286
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball Yes, this break was brought to you by the Swedish Chef And of course, Tack with the Psycho Duck Children

451
01:03:47,769 --> 01:03:51,850
[SPEAKER_27]: During that break we played my theme music, Schlagwerk, because this is fucked up.

452
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:56,171
[SPEAKER_27]: And then Jessica's request of Traces.

453
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:58,612
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, it was Attack Attack.

454
01:03:59,272 --> 01:04:03,833
[SPEAKER_27]: And then even though Paul Oteri is officially banned from Orange Sounds Radio until the end of the year.

455
01:04:03,853 --> 01:04:05,073
[SPEAKER_29]: There is nothing wrong with Paul Oteri.

456
01:04:05,453 --> 01:04:06,153
[SPEAKER_29]: I love Paul Oteri.

457
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:06,734
[SPEAKER_29]: Love you, girl.

458
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:09,594
[SPEAKER_27]: Even though she can't hold a tune to save her life.

459
01:04:10,535 --> 01:04:11,475
[SPEAKER_28]: Go ahead, marry her.

460
01:04:11,655 --> 01:04:12,255
[SPEAKER_28]: See if I care.

461
01:04:14,499 --> 01:04:15,780
[SPEAKER_27]: Why would anybody want to?

462
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,982
[SPEAKER_27]: She looks anorexic and can't sing.

463
01:04:22,263 --> 01:04:23,524
[SPEAKER_27]: We've gone off on Politary before.

464
01:04:23,784 --> 01:04:27,606
[SPEAKER_27]: This is not the Fuck You Politary show.

465
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:33,989
[SPEAKER_27]: We also had the remix from DDR USA, Drop the Bomb.

466
01:04:34,429 --> 01:04:37,991
[SPEAKER_27]: We had Tack with QQQ, again, the Psycho Duck Children.

467
01:04:39,796 --> 01:04:51,102
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, we are, you know, because for some reason I can't play music in the background of my show while we're using the microphone because of the mixer on here.

468
01:04:52,423 --> 01:04:53,883
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, don't marry Paul Terry, she's ugly.

469
01:04:57,525 --> 01:04:58,486
[SPEAKER_28]: She's not very married.

470
01:04:59,967 --> 01:05:03,288
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm Maple, M-A-R-R-Y.

471
01:05:04,249 --> 01:05:05,329
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, she's unhappy.

472
01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:07,410
[SPEAKER_27]: She's unhappy because we hate her.

473
01:05:08,411 --> 01:05:08,631
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry.

474
01:05:10,414 --> 01:05:17,300
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, but I can't really play the music over, you know, with the microphone, so we get the silent fuck yous of the week.

475
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:21,484
[SPEAKER_27]: They're a moment of silence in honor of being angsty.

476
01:05:22,145 --> 01:05:25,828
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, my fuck you of the week, you know, I don't really feel very bad.

477
01:05:26,268 --> 01:05:29,071
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, true, the other host went to SoCal without me.

478
01:05:31,314 --> 01:05:34,776
[SPEAKER_27]: But that's okay, even though I had work and I was bored.

479
01:05:35,336 --> 01:05:35,817
[SPEAKER_27]: It's okay.

480
01:05:37,157 --> 01:05:41,260
[SPEAKER_27]: I was just really, really alone.

481
01:05:44,582 --> 01:05:45,943
[SPEAKER_27]: And I got peanuts for Christmas.

482
01:05:46,603 --> 01:05:48,444
[SPEAKER_27]: Which were nice peanuts, they were quite tasty.

483
01:05:48,484 --> 01:05:49,405
[SPEAKER_27]: And I got lots of chocolate.

484
01:05:49,505 --> 01:05:51,466
[SPEAKER_27]: I got peanuts, I got nuts too.

485
01:05:51,486 --> 01:05:52,006
[SPEAKER_27]: You got nuts?

486
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:52,587
[SPEAKER_27]: I got nuts.

487
01:05:53,247 --> 01:05:54,108
[SPEAKER_27]: Were your nuts salty?

488
01:05:55,068 --> 01:05:57,209
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, actually, yeah, actually they were fancy.

489
01:05:58,210 --> 01:05:59,231
[SPEAKER_27]: You had fancy nuts?

490
01:05:59,691 --> 01:05:59,891
[SPEAKER_27]: Mm-hmm.

491
01:06:01,485 --> 01:06:09,012
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, um, other than that, you know, there's not really, you know, I'm pretty, pretty happy, I think.

492
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:19,042
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, oh, fuck you to the 8th style machine for breaking my nail, but it's sort of a not really because I got to play it and we have ours.

493
01:06:21,184 --> 01:06:23,486
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I have, uh, I have had a cry.

494
01:06:25,228 --> 01:06:29,489
[SPEAKER_27]: But, um, the, uh, it was actually pretty nice to have that.

495
01:06:29,749 --> 01:06:32,250
[SPEAKER_27]: Also, uh, fuck you to cheese.

496
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:38,711
[SPEAKER_27]: We went to, uh, Old Spaghetti Factory, and they put a lot of cheese on their food.

497
01:06:38,771 --> 01:06:39,851
[SPEAKER_27]: This is what I had.

498
01:06:40,952 --> 01:06:42,652
[SPEAKER_27]: I had garlic cheese bread.

499
01:06:43,732 --> 01:06:44,112
[SPEAKER_27]: With cheese.

500
01:06:44,913 --> 01:06:45,973
[SPEAKER_27]: I had butter on my bread.

501
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:53,394
[SPEAKER_27]: I had cheese and spinach, ravioli with alfredo sauce, covered in cheese, the mithril cheese, by the way.

502
01:06:54,314 --> 01:06:55,395
[SPEAKER_27]: Mithril cheese.

503
01:06:55,835 --> 01:06:56,736
[SPEAKER_27]: What was it?

504
01:06:56,796 --> 01:06:58,137
[SPEAKER_27]: Mizzithra.

505
01:06:58,357 --> 01:06:59,257
[SPEAKER_27]: Mizzithra cheese.

506
01:06:59,357 --> 01:07:01,659
[SPEAKER_27]: But the first time I saw it, I read it as mithril cheese.

507
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,481
[SPEAKER_27]: Made by the elves, who'd pawned their own mother to have it themselves.

508
01:07:05,801 --> 01:07:06,062
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway.

509
01:07:09,584 --> 01:07:12,786
[SPEAKER_27]: And then I had ice cream and a cream soda.

510
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:19,335
[SPEAKER_27]: We were in the freeway going to, uh, Scandia when I realized that I really had to go to the bathroom.

511
01:07:19,815 --> 01:07:21,775
[SPEAKER_27]: So, fuck you to lactose intolerance.

512
01:07:26,637 --> 01:07:28,857
[SPEAKER_28]: Which then spawned Fun Parappa.

513
01:07:28,897 --> 01:07:32,578
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, which then had us going into the Parappa funky flow.

514
01:07:33,378 --> 01:07:36,139
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, um... Parappa funky funky flow.

515
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:38,320
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, uh, let's, uh, how about your FUs of the week?

516
01:07:40,635 --> 01:07:50,200
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm actually very, like, normal this week, so, um, I, I, uh, I have an F you from last week, maybe I could do that one.

517
01:07:50,780 --> 01:08:03,046
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, F you to everybody who waits until the last fucking minute to do their Christmas shopping, because they make people who are in retails' lives hell.

518
01:08:03,707 --> 01:08:05,668
[SPEAKER_28]: Not to mention, not...

519
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:07,151
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, Mark.

520
01:08:30,516 --> 01:08:32,917
[SPEAKER_28]: and all that fun crap.

521
01:08:33,277 --> 01:08:41,220
[SPEAKER_28]: And F you to the coin slot on 8th style, but it's not really an F you because I love the machine and it's pretty and it's five minutes from my house.

522
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:43,160
[SPEAKER_28]: Ross?

523
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:45,801
[SPEAKER_29]: None.

524
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:46,722
[SPEAKER_27]: You're boring.

525
01:08:47,282 --> 01:08:48,362
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't think of anything, no.

526
01:08:48,902 --> 01:08:49,562
[SPEAKER_29]: I love everybody.

527
01:08:49,923 --> 01:08:50,223
[SPEAKER_29]: Really.

528
01:08:50,823 --> 01:08:51,643
[SPEAKER_29]: You're full of shit.

529
01:08:53,824 --> 01:08:54,524
[SPEAKER_29]: Just cast Maple.

530
01:08:55,224 --> 01:08:55,745
[SPEAKER_28]: Isn't that right?

531
01:08:55,925 --> 01:08:56,905
[SPEAKER_28]: Maple's full of shit, too.

532
01:08:58,315 --> 01:09:01,617
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, um, whatever.

533
01:09:03,178 --> 01:09:04,659
[SPEAKER_27]: We could have Jessica step on your toe.

534
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,821
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, then I could say I have a nephew, yeah.

535
01:09:10,323 --> 01:09:11,844
[SPEAKER_28]: Then he could say you're sleeping on the couch.

536
01:09:17,647 --> 01:09:20,309
[SPEAKER_27]: Did we have a moment of silence in honor of that phrase?

537
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:26,584
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we've gotten most of the crap out of our system.

538
01:09:26,624 --> 01:09:27,185
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's go ahead.

539
01:09:30,349 --> 01:09:31,371
[SPEAKER_27]: I think you got props.

540
01:09:33,433 --> 01:09:34,815
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, let's go ahead and...

541
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:37,510
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, you can let us know.

542
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,271
[SPEAKER_27]: We actually have a new person in our chat room.

543
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:41,092
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll go ahead and give a shout to our new person in a minute.

544
01:09:41,432 --> 01:09:48,215
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's go ahead and read the FUs of the week from our lovely, lovely and talented listeners.

545
01:09:49,215 --> 01:09:51,136
[SPEAKER_27]: First, let me have DarkTetsuya.

546
01:09:52,877 --> 01:09:54,017
[SPEAKER_27]: FU to not having FUs.

547
01:09:57,518 --> 01:09:58,539
[SPEAKER_27]: That was eloquent.

548
01:10:00,466 --> 01:10:02,248
[SPEAKER_27]: Next, we have DVR Angel.

549
01:10:02,628 --> 01:10:05,270
[SPEAKER_27]: My FU this week goes to DVR Max 2 Machine at Ronert Park.

550
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:14,097
[SPEAKER_27]: Scandia, again, for not taking tokens and the people that work there that are too lazy to fix it and say they're technicians that come in at 5pm need to fix it and not them.

551
01:10:14,537 --> 01:10:16,919
[SPEAKER_27]: Didn't I get that from RVGL?

552
01:10:17,019 --> 01:10:21,303
[SPEAKER_27]: That was my FU of the week last week, which I'm not even going to get into because they're still pissing me off.

553
01:10:22,967 --> 01:10:26,929
[SPEAKER_27]: Next, we have 23Rangus who says, Big FU to my bed.

554
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:28,049
[SPEAKER_27]: Or his bed, not my bed.

555
01:10:28,089 --> 01:10:28,549
[SPEAKER_27]: My bed's cool.

556
01:10:28,929 --> 01:10:29,710
[SPEAKER_27]: I have a California king.

557
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:37,013
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, FU to his bed for causing great neck pain while still looking so fluffy and squishy and super sleepy time-ish.

558
01:10:37,773 --> 01:10:41,975
[SPEAKER_27]: FU to learning pata pata because, damn, I can't learn a pata while uggling the all-stars.

559
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:49,798
[SPEAKER_27]: FU to Met Commander 2 for being too easy and a giant FU to a CD clock radio for not wanting to read my B-Money CD.

560
01:10:50,138 --> 01:10:50,258
[SPEAKER_27]: Out.

561
01:10:51,642 --> 01:10:53,563
[SPEAKER_27]: And, um, that was it from him.

562
01:10:54,664 --> 01:10:57,926
[SPEAKER_27]: By the way, we now have people in here doing pata pata in their chair.

563
01:10:58,327 --> 01:11:00,708
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I'll just, doing a yesterday.

564
01:11:01,589 --> 01:11:03,050
[SPEAKER_27]: And now we're doing boom and fire.

565
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:10,275
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, our new person, Ohaya Bemani, thank you, by the way, for coming into our chat room and tuning in.

566
01:11:10,435 --> 01:11:16,599
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, F you to people who hog new DDR machines and refuse to give others a try, who go out of their way just to see it.

567
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:17,820
[SPEAKER_27]: God, that's true.

568
01:11:18,701 --> 01:11:20,602
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, we didn't do that today.

[SPEAKER_27]: We have VidPower next.

571

[SPEAKER_27]: F you to free time, because I need more of it.

572
01:11:48,212 --> 01:11:52,133
[SPEAKER_27]: F you to classical speed for only being 30 minutes, because it's got such great songs and there needs to be more of it.

573
01:11:52,453 --> 01:11:53,653
[SPEAKER_27]: Classical speed was interesting.

574
01:11:54,794 --> 01:11:59,155
[SPEAKER_27]: F you to not being able to pick out more happy hardcore CDs because I can't find any at the music store.

[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, and F you to Rob's OL auto schedule since it won't play the OL Rewind on Thursday afternoons.

[SPEAKER_27]: He is such a bitch to find.

580
01:12:55,878 --> 01:13:01,222
[SPEAKER_27]: And then you go and try to find a present from him, and Mel's only got one present in the hour and a half he's been trying.

581
01:13:01,723 --> 01:13:03,024
[SPEAKER_27]: Friggin' punk-ass reindeer.

582
01:13:03,064 --> 01:13:04,225
[SPEAKER_27]: He gets a fuck you of the week.

583
01:13:06,327 --> 01:13:08,529
[SPEAKER_27]: Mel says he wishes Grandma would run over Jingle.

584
01:13:09,888 --> 01:13:15,312
[SPEAKER_27]: So, that's from Shark Skull, who, you know, both of them have been, I guess, on the show before, a couple times.

585
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:19,856
[SPEAKER_27]: The other one we have is from...

586
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:45,028
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck my friend and his dad for his DSL ruining the dial-up internet on the laptop for three days, which was over the period of the show time, so I missed the show and life sucked.

587
01:13:46,696 --> 01:13:52,459
[SPEAKER_27]: and fuck his posture because it sucks and birthday for being on a Monday and having to have a party on Sunday night.

588
01:13:52,559 --> 01:13:53,899
[SPEAKER_28]: I have a bigger fuck you then.

589
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,261
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh oh, we're getting into another fuck you from Jessica.

590
01:13:58,221 --> 01:13:59,482
[SPEAKER_27]: And missing the show, so fuck that.

591
01:13:59,582 --> 01:14:03,804
[SPEAKER_27]: And one more, fuck projects over break because that destroys the whole break thing and they should just die.

592
01:14:04,084 --> 01:14:04,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes!

593
01:14:05,264 --> 01:14:08,526
[SPEAKER_27]: Teachers just don't realize they need the time for relaxing stuff and projects make it sucky.

594
01:14:08,566 --> 01:14:09,106
[SPEAKER_27]: Boo on teachers.

595
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:11,056
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, boo, boo his.

596
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,023
[SPEAKER_27]: Jessica has another, fuck you.

597
01:14:15,403 --> 01:14:16,565
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's go ahead and pass the mic back.

598
01:14:18,632 --> 01:14:24,195
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a mini FU for people who try to schedule things on other people's birthdays.

599
01:14:24,655 --> 01:14:29,718
[SPEAKER_28]: You know who's... The person I'm talking to knows this one.

600
01:14:30,178 --> 01:14:31,298
[SPEAKER_28]: And I love you, man.

601
01:14:31,658 --> 01:14:32,579
[SPEAKER_28]: But that sucked.

602
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,520
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyways, I'm trying to fix it.

603
01:14:36,081 --> 01:14:40,323
[SPEAKER_28]: And I guess you'll be invited when it gets taken care of.

604
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:42,724
[SPEAKER_28]: But, yeah, there you go.

605
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:50,515
[SPEAKER_27]: That would just suck having an important event scheduled on your birthday, wouldn't it?

606
01:14:50,895 --> 01:14:56,760
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that person just needs to be ashamed.

607
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:02,744
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know if you heard that person, but apparently all your balls need to die.

608
01:15:04,385 --> 01:15:06,427
[SPEAKER_27]: But you're still loved, you're still loved.

609
01:15:08,854 --> 01:15:09,374
[SPEAKER_27]: Whoever you are.

610
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:13,378
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, we have another FU of the week from Blackwab.

611
01:15:14,879 --> 01:15:15,600
[SPEAKER_27]: Fuck headaches.

612
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,742
[SPEAKER_27]: Slept too long under the influence of painkillers.

613
01:15:18,622 --> 01:15:21,545
[SPEAKER_27]: And fuck his girlfriend's little cousin for trying to kill him last night.

614
01:15:21,985 --> 01:15:24,407
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, if someone tried to kill me, I'd want to say fuck you to them too.

615
01:15:25,849 --> 01:15:26,769
[SPEAKER_27]: And fuck oyster.

616
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:27,430
[SPEAKER_27]: I hate it.

617
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:28,231
[SPEAKER_27]: It makes me sick.

618
01:15:29,031 --> 01:15:29,852
[SPEAKER_27]: Nice English there.

619
01:15:32,955 --> 01:15:33,675
[SPEAKER_27]: I hat yet.

620
01:15:34,436 --> 01:15:35,217
[SPEAKER_27]: It makes me sick.

621
01:15:35,537 --> 01:15:35,597
Yay!

622
01:15:36,837 --> 01:15:37,797
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's hear it for Ingrish.

623
01:15:38,538 --> 01:15:39,718
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's loving Ingrish!

624
01:15:40,799 --> 01:15:41,139
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay!

625
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:42,139
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh!

626
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,621
[SPEAKER_27]: And we have an FU from Maple.

627
01:15:45,821 --> 01:15:48,943
[SPEAKER_27]: FU to his brother who wants the computer while he's trying to listen to OL Live.

628
01:15:49,063 --> 01:15:49,543
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah!

629
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:51,464
[SPEAKER_27]: There's things that are more important!

630
01:15:53,405 --> 01:15:54,845
[SPEAKER_27]: Like having FUs written to you.

631
01:15:57,446 --> 01:16:00,508
[SPEAKER_27]: And, uh... Dan!

632
01:16:00,548 --> 01:16:01,568
[SPEAKER_27]: Got an FU of the week?

633
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:05,190
[SPEAKER_27]: My man is...

634
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:08,325
[SPEAKER_27]: My man does not have an FU of the week.

635
01:16:08,345 --> 01:16:17,911
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, we're doing these at my house, and my fiancé is downstairs, apparently, playing Animal Crossing, which is our crack in this house.

636
01:16:19,272 --> 01:16:21,454
[SPEAKER_27]: So, you know what?

637
01:16:21,694 --> 01:16:23,295
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't think of anything to say right now.

638
01:16:23,695 --> 01:16:27,478
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm being honest with you all, so I'm going to go to break, because I have to pee.

639
01:16:28,618 --> 01:16:29,519
[SPEAKER_27]: We want a special song.

640
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:34,923
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll tell you what, we're going to go ahead and play a song for everybody listening, and

641
01:16:36,744 --> 01:16:47,256
[SPEAKER_27]: which, and I'm going to apologize because this is off the CD so if it doesn't, there may be a moment of silence while I'm trying to get it to actually work so I apologize if that ends up being the case.

642
01:16:49,147 --> 01:16:58,733
[SPEAKER_27]: What I'm going to play is a song that has been heard in, actually the home version of Beatmania 2DX, that's 8th, no 6th style, why did I say 8th style?

643
01:16:59,173 --> 01:17:02,074
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's been in 7th style and 8th style.

644
01:17:02,935 --> 01:17:04,936
[SPEAKER_27]: Should I play the remix or just the regular long?

645
01:17:05,076 --> 01:17:05,837
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll play the remix.

646
01:17:05,877 --> 01:17:16,723
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the remix version of Beautiful Days, and it may take me a moment to get this up and running, but be patient with us, and thank you for doing so.

647
01:17:26,205 --> 01:17:26,329
Oh!

648
01:17:51,929 --> 01:17:58,613
[SPEAKER_20]: Looking back when I was a child and dream, growth and maturity would come to me.

649
01:17:58,633 --> 01:18:05,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Having faith in you set me free and fly away.

650
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:13,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking back when I was a child and dream, growth and maturity would come to me.

651
01:18:13,183 --> 01:18:16,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Having faith in you set me free and fly away to everywhere.

652
01:21:25,444 --> 01:21:26,585
Thanks for watching!

653
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:17,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

654
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:53,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because Bongo Demands It

655
01:26:56,764 --> 01:26:58,465
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, because Bongo demands it.

656
01:26:58,565 --> 01:26:58,945
[SPEAKER_27]: Listen.

657
01:26:59,645 --> 01:27:02,246
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I guess if you're hearing me say this, you're listening right now.

658
01:27:04,346 --> 01:27:17,050
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, the second song we played is Simple and Clean, which is the full English version of... Actually, I think it's the only song in English I've heard by Utada Hikaru, but that was the one from Kingdom Hearts.

659
01:27:17,851 --> 01:27:21,792
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe later on I'll play the Planet B remix, but unfortunately I don't have the English one, I only have the Japanese one.

660
01:27:22,632 --> 01:27:51,714
[SPEAKER_27]: um we have a belated um fuck you of the week uh from Nost Island and we had Jessica falling over in the other chair waving her hands and going help and Ross is rescuing her um anyway um we have this belated fuck you of the week uh to Homestead for their crappy uh web servicing etc dot dot dot and that is a direct quote so uh

661
01:27:53,487 --> 01:27:56,749
[SPEAKER_27]: We actually have some discussion about some older games in here.

662
01:27:56,809 --> 01:28:00,251
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a discussion about Marble Madness 2.

663
01:28:02,012 --> 01:28:04,234
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you have hiccups?

664
01:28:05,214 --> 01:28:06,775
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

665
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:08,136
[SPEAKER_27]: Somebody needs to scare Jessica.

666
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:09,317
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's play some more Politary.

667
01:28:10,478 --> 01:28:10,898
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you okay?

668
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:10,998
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

669
01:28:14,358 --> 01:28:15,378
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you okay?

670
01:28:15,518 --> 01:28:15,758
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

671
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:18,179
[SPEAKER_27]: I couldn't tell if you were in pain or laughing.

672
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:23,380
[SPEAKER_27]: I hiccup, and then I burp.

673
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:26,720
[SPEAKER_28]: I hiccup, and then I burp.

674
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:29,641
[SPEAKER_28]: And then I hiccup, and I burp.

675
01:28:30,841 --> 01:28:32,521
[SPEAKER_27]: We have hiccuping and burping.

676
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:36,562
[SPEAKER_27]: It looks like we actually have some discussion going on about old school games in here.

677
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:42,103
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course, 23rd Amagus is telling us about The Guardian Legend.

678
01:28:43,139 --> 01:28:45,420
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course, which is my favorite Nintendo game ever.

679
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,421
[SPEAKER_27]: We had votes for Marble Madness.

680
01:28:49,861 --> 01:28:51,802
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe we'll do two listless tonight.

681
01:28:51,842 --> 01:28:54,102
[SPEAKER_27]: We actually had an idea for one, but maybe we'll do two.

682
01:28:54,122 --> 01:28:55,803
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

683
01:28:56,383 --> 01:28:59,524
[SPEAKER_27]: So, why don't we actually, let's go ahead and start our first one.

684
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,304
[SPEAKER_27]: Why don't we?

685
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:05,286
[SPEAKER_27]: As soon as Jessica stops hiccuping.

686
01:29:06,406 --> 01:29:08,047
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, baby, this will scare you.

687
01:29:08,067 --> 01:29:08,487
[SPEAKER_27]: Vanilla Ice.

688
01:29:08,527 --> 01:29:09,427
[SPEAKER_27]: Vanilla Ice.

689
01:29:16,216 --> 01:29:17,096
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you burping still?

690
01:29:18,997 --> 01:29:22,098
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, chat room, suggest a duck hunt.

691
01:29:23,479 --> 01:29:27,441
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

692
01:29:30,002 --> 01:29:34,804
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, so what's scary enough to get rid of Jessica's hiccups?

693
01:29:37,265 --> 01:29:40,106
[SPEAKER_27]: What would be scary enough to get rid of Jessica's hiccups?

694
01:29:40,206 --> 01:29:40,506
[SPEAKER_29]: Rub that.

695
01:29:42,130 --> 01:29:47,414
[SPEAKER_27]: That would be scary enough to kill people.

696
01:29:48,355 --> 01:29:50,917
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, think back to the Miggle 2 tournament.

697
01:29:51,718 --> 01:29:53,499
[SPEAKER_27]: Think about to where we put Brad in your trunk.

698
01:29:57,262 --> 01:29:59,724
[SPEAKER_27]: We put Brad in your trunk on the way to Lions.

699
01:30:00,005 --> 01:30:01,085
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh yeah, we did, didn't we?

700
01:30:01,165 --> 01:30:01,926
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, isn't that scary?

701
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:05,689
[SPEAKER_27]: Because he flashed his pale skin to the world.

702
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:07,691
[SPEAKER_28]: That is kind of scary.

703
01:30:08,331 --> 01:30:09,032
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you still hiccuping?

704
01:30:10,737 --> 01:30:11,137
[SPEAKER_27]: Chatroom.

705
01:30:13,479 --> 01:30:15,019
[SPEAKER_27]: No, the click of vision is not scary.

706
01:30:15,099 --> 01:30:16,280
[SPEAKER_27]: Politary Prawn.

707
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:16,720
[SPEAKER_27]: Ew.

708
01:30:19,682 --> 01:30:21,163
[SPEAKER_27]: That's disturbing.

709
01:30:21,803 --> 01:30:22,283
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow.

710
01:30:23,824 --> 01:30:24,945
[SPEAKER_27]: No, she would be the dildo.

711
01:30:26,506 --> 01:30:27,186
[SPEAKER_27]: She's ugly.

712
01:30:28,087 --> 01:30:29,948
[SPEAKER_27]: She's very ugly.

713
01:30:29,988 --> 01:30:31,068
[SPEAKER_29]: The 250 BPM Satan fetus is pretty scary.

714
01:30:38,968 --> 01:30:41,589
[SPEAKER_27]: I would not play that song for ages because of the Satan fetus.

715
01:30:43,389 --> 01:30:44,949
[SPEAKER_27]: Foam bat porn.

716
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:46,830
[SPEAKER_27]: Blink.

717
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:47,770
[SPEAKER_27]: Blink.

718
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:49,090
[SPEAKER_27]: Dot, dot, dot.

719
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,050
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not foam bat.

720
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:51,091
[SPEAKER_28]: It's plastic bat.

721
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:51,951
[SPEAKER_27]: Plastic bat.

722
01:30:52,611 --> 01:30:53,051
[SPEAKER_28]: Get it right.

723
01:30:53,431 --> 01:30:56,732
[SPEAKER_27]: It's plastic and it's orange and it's been signed by practically everybody now.

724
01:30:57,692 --> 01:30:59,353
[SPEAKER_27]: I think her hiccups went away.

725
01:30:59,373 --> 01:31:01,373
[SPEAKER_27]: Her hiccups went away?

726
01:31:01,393 --> 01:31:01,453
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay!

727
01:31:01,473 --> 01:31:01,533
[SPEAKER_27]: Yay!

728
01:31:06,111 --> 01:31:08,293
[SPEAKER_27]: Travis did come up with the worst one.

729
01:31:09,134 --> 01:31:12,736
[SPEAKER_27]: And I got a random message from... Some idiot.

730
01:31:13,257 --> 01:31:14,798
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, some idiot.

731
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:23,044
[SPEAKER_27]: So, um... Well, why don't we go ahead and try to do a listless, you know?

732
01:31:23,445 --> 01:31:26,227
[SPEAKER_27]: True, I seem to be playing, like... Just ignore the person.

733
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:29,489
[SPEAKER_27]: Tons and tons and tons and tons of music the whole time.

734
01:31:29,509 --> 01:31:30,370
[SPEAKER_28]: Ignore!

735
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:31,611
[SPEAKER_28]: Just right-click ignore.

736
01:31:31,631 --> 01:31:32,632
[SPEAKER_28]: Can't you?

737
01:31:36,294 --> 01:31:36,854
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, that's lovely.

738
01:31:37,515 --> 01:31:48,880
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, we're having an issue right now with the, uh, chat room, so I'll tell you what, let me go ahead and play a couple more songs, uh, until we, uh, get this settled, so, uh, let's play some stuff from, uh, Jet Set Radio.

739
01:31:49,461 --> 01:31:50,881
[SPEAKER_27]: Here's Guitar Vader with Super Brothers.

740
01:31:53,623 --> 01:31:50,881
... ...

741
01:32:40,949 --> 01:32:41,790
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

742
01:33:57,116 --> 01:33:58,192
[SPEAKER_14]: and Sipa Brazzers.

743
01:34:43,124 --> 01:34:44,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, crisis averted.

744
01:34:44,825 --> 01:34:46,365
[SPEAKER_14]: For the time being, right?

745
01:35:13,018 --> 01:35:17,002
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, that song is actually from the first Jet Set Radio.

746
01:35:17,162 --> 01:35:19,504
[SPEAKER_27]: That was Super Brothers.

747
01:35:19,584 --> 01:35:22,527
[SPEAKER_27]: The soundtrack for that game was very interesting.

748
01:35:23,387 --> 01:35:27,171
[SPEAKER_27]: When they brought it out for the US, though, they were supposed to have added some more tracks to that.

749
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:29,313
[SPEAKER_27]: But it was a pretty cool game.

750
01:35:30,294 --> 01:35:30,354
[SPEAKER_27]: Um...

751
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:32,701
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, we're going to go ahead.

752
01:35:33,922 --> 01:35:40,503
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not going to be doing the song battle this week because, of course, my other two hosts aren't here to put in their contributions.

753
01:35:40,583 --> 01:35:43,464
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're going to go ahead and leave the playlist the way it is this week.

754
01:35:43,524 --> 01:35:46,565
[SPEAKER_27]: But next week we actually should have the song battle.

755
01:35:47,085 --> 01:35:52,166
[SPEAKER_27]: And because none of you voted for Knight Rider, hello, then I'm going to pick a new song.

756
01:35:52,266 --> 01:35:56,267
[SPEAKER_27]: So you have to vote for it because anything that I pick, of course, is going to be instantly cool.

757
01:35:56,467 --> 01:35:58,747
[SPEAKER_27]: They didn't vote for Knight Rider?

758
01:35:58,867 --> 01:36:01,028
[SPEAKER_27]: I put in a nice remix of the Knight Rider theme.

759
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:04,201
[SPEAKER_27]: and nobody, and like, two people voted for it.

760
01:36:04,241 --> 01:36:04,861
[SPEAKER_27]: You're all idiots.

761
01:36:05,062 --> 01:36:07,483
[SPEAKER_27]: But it lasted for two, it actually made it through three weeks.

762
01:36:08,443 --> 01:36:08,603
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

763
01:36:08,623 --> 01:36:10,924
[SPEAKER_27]: So, so, people had some taste for a while.

764
01:36:11,564 --> 01:36:17,547
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, um, thanks to, uh, DarkTessia, it was, uh, they put some Rob Zombie music in, uh, in, uh, Jet Set Radio.

765
01:36:18,908 --> 01:36:25,431
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, um, we're gonna go ahead and, uh, go into one of our, uh, favorite segments, which is, uh, the, uh, listless.

766
01:36:26,144 --> 01:36:31,565
[SPEAKER_27]: We're probably going to do two of them today because we're not having the Battle of Songs.

767
01:36:31,605 --> 01:36:32,746
[SPEAKER_27]: And hey, don't you all love it?

768
01:36:33,286 --> 01:36:36,206
[SPEAKER_27]: So this one is going to be... Well, I don't know.

769
01:36:36,587 --> 01:36:37,987
[SPEAKER_27]: Should we do Best Old School Game?

770
01:36:38,027 --> 01:36:40,307
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe Best 80s TV Show, perhaps?

771
01:36:41,488 --> 01:36:44,188
[SPEAKER_27]: How about Best Sitcom or Tune?

772
01:36:44,769 --> 01:36:45,389
[SPEAKER_27]: What would you suggest?

773
01:36:46,729 --> 01:36:49,190
[SPEAKER_28]: Hmm... Sitcom.

774
01:36:49,210 --> 01:36:50,550
[SPEAKER_28]: Because Tune's going to be too hard.

775
01:36:50,910 --> 01:36:52,651
[SPEAKER_27]: Best 80s Sitcom.

776
01:36:53,611 --> 01:36:54,071
[SPEAKER_27]: So, uh...

777
01:36:55,191 --> 01:36:59,213
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know how many of you are actually going to be old enough to get it.

778
01:37:00,915 --> 01:37:02,976
[SPEAKER_27]: But, you know, think back.

779
01:37:04,377 --> 01:37:05,277
[SPEAKER_27]: All of it for Propel.

780
01:37:06,958 --> 01:37:08,619
[SPEAKER_27]: Propel was not an 80s sitcom.

781
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:11,261
[SPEAKER_27]: No, Stalin wants to hear you laugh again.

782
01:37:13,442 --> 01:37:13,902
[SPEAKER_27]: How was that?

783
01:37:14,943 --> 01:37:16,484
[SPEAKER_27]: You actually sound kind of evil when you laugh.

784
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,200
[SPEAKER_28]: That's my evil boyfriend.

785
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,561
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what I was trying to be evil.

786
01:37:22,281 --> 01:37:24,201
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, we have a suggestion for best 80s movie.

787
01:37:25,522 --> 01:37:26,342
[SPEAKER_28]: That's too broad.

788
01:37:26,562 --> 01:37:27,462
[SPEAKER_27]: It is pretty broad.

789
01:37:29,243 --> 01:37:32,163
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, you'd have to break it down to best 80s comedy.

790
01:37:32,203 --> 01:37:37,525
[SPEAKER_27]: Because there's only three of us here, so maybe we'll pick four each.

791
01:37:38,325 --> 01:37:39,345
[SPEAKER_27]: So maybe we could do it that way?

792
01:37:41,125 --> 01:37:46,287
[SPEAKER_27]: Best live-action, non-animated 80s movie.

793
01:37:46,507 --> 01:37:47,447
[SPEAKER_29]: Crap, there goes Transformers.

794
01:37:48,257 --> 01:37:49,398
[SPEAKER_27]: Edwards Scissor Penis

795
01:38:09,957 --> 01:38:10,857
[SPEAKER_28]: No, it's Penis Hands.

796
01:38:10,937 --> 01:38:11,617
[SPEAKER_27]: Penis Hands.

797
01:38:11,697 --> 01:38:12,577
[SPEAKER_27]: Edward Penis Hands.

798
01:38:13,018 --> 01:38:15,518
[SPEAKER_27]: See, now our ratings are going to go up because we're talking about porn.

799
01:38:15,538 --> 01:38:15,978
[SPEAKER_27]: See, look.

800
01:38:16,078 --> 01:38:19,519
[SPEAKER_28]: You realize it's extremely sad that I know more about porn than my boyfriend does.

801
01:38:20,919 --> 01:38:21,559
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, owned.

802
01:38:21,999 --> 01:38:24,320
[SPEAKER_29]: Whatever I have in my possession.

803
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:25,760
[SPEAKER_29]: Trace the Lord's first video.

804
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:26,180
[SPEAKER_29]: Hello.

805
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:28,980
[SPEAKER_28]: And that has what basis?

806
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:29,781
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yeah.

807
01:38:30,221 --> 01:38:31,221
[SPEAKER_28]: She was underage.

808
01:38:31,521 --> 01:38:31,861
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

809
01:38:33,001 --> 01:38:33,601
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

810
01:38:33,861 --> 01:38:34,761
[SPEAKER_28]: Child porn.

811
01:38:34,781 --> 01:38:36,902
[SPEAKER_29]: You can't tell it was the 80s.

812
01:38:36,942 --> 01:38:37,542
[SPEAKER_29]: She looked old enough.

813
01:38:38,484 --> 01:38:39,845
[SPEAKER_27]: What, big hair and fake boobs?

814
01:38:40,305 --> 01:38:47,708
[SPEAKER_27]: Was that the same excuse that you used for... I'm not even gonna ask.

815
01:38:48,309 --> 01:38:48,709
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, um...

816
01:38:52,975 --> 01:38:56,017
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to vote for four-piece.

817
01:38:56,677 --> 01:38:57,957
[SPEAKER_27]: So, hey, guess what?

818
01:38:57,997 --> 01:39:01,339
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to play more music because I can't think of anything else to talk about.

819
01:39:01,359 --> 01:39:02,280
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're going to go ahead.

820
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:14,085
[SPEAKER_27]: We did actually have some requests for more Parappa music, so I'm going to go ahead and play the final song for Parappa the Rapper 2.

821
01:39:14,165 --> 01:39:18,347
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to go ahead and throw in some more Jet Set Radio stuff.

822
01:39:19,828 --> 01:39:21,429
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's see what else we're going to play.

823
01:39:23,671 --> 01:39:25,673

Niko Meow Niko Meow Niko Meow Meow Meow Meow

866
01:52:54,332 --> 01:52:56,966
[SPEAKER_25]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

867
01:53:02,463 --> 01:53:08,248
[SPEAKER_27]: And so I hope we all have our answers ready for our list list.

868
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:12,432
[SPEAKER_27]: And Dan has decided to participate in this.

869
01:53:12,773 --> 01:53:19,359
[SPEAKER_27]: Because there's only four of us, usually we do this with six or more, we all picked four songs, but we're still going to vote only for the top three.

870
01:53:19,759 --> 01:53:21,721
[SPEAKER_27]: And I repeated one of my movies on here.

871
01:53:22,001 --> 01:53:22,922
[SPEAKER_27]: Damn it, I'm dumb.

872
01:53:24,324 --> 01:53:25,345
[SPEAKER_27]: We're choosing movies.

873
01:53:27,759 --> 01:53:29,760
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, well, I'm going to go ahead and do what I originally had on here.

874
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:33,842
[SPEAKER_27]: So, we're going to go ahead and start with me, because we can.

875
01:53:34,742 --> 01:53:36,123
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know, but let's go ahead and start with Jessica.

876
01:53:36,463 --> 01:53:38,344
[SPEAKER_27]: What's your number four movie?

877
01:53:39,965 --> 01:53:42,986
[SPEAKER_28]: Number four, we have Weird Science.

878
01:53:44,387 --> 01:53:44,607
[SPEAKER_27]: Huh?

879
01:53:46,688 --> 01:53:46,868
[SPEAKER_28]: Huh?

880
01:53:48,902 --> 01:53:49,802
[SPEAKER_28]: Number three?

881
01:53:50,983 --> 01:53:52,444
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, Weird Science?

882
01:53:53,424 --> 01:53:59,668
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, what other movie can you see two guys running around with bras on their heads and it seems completely normal-ish?

883
01:54:01,409 --> 01:54:02,069
[SPEAKER_28]: Number three?

884
01:54:05,031 --> 01:54:06,471
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, passing off to Ross.

885
01:54:09,313 --> 01:54:12,775
[SPEAKER_29]: Number four on my list was A Christmas Story.

886
01:54:13,555 --> 01:54:14,956
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, it's seasonal.

887
01:54:15,811 --> 01:54:18,653
[SPEAKER_29]: It's still funny to this day, and god darn it, you'll shoot your eye out.

888
01:54:23,996 --> 01:54:28,319
[SPEAKER_21]: My number four was Aliens, because that movie's hard like the rock.

889
01:54:34,523 --> 01:54:41,287
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, my number four is Adventures in Babysitting.

890
01:54:42,611 --> 01:54:49,693
[SPEAKER_27]: because of the part where they're singing and Thor.

891
01:54:50,974 --> 01:54:51,614
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey!

892
01:54:52,334 --> 01:54:54,255
[SPEAKER_27]: Adventures in Babysitting was a good movie.

893
01:54:55,515 --> 01:54:58,776
[SPEAKER_27]: So, let's go ahead and go to number three.

894
01:55:00,971 --> 01:55:09,974
[SPEAKER_28]: Number three for me would be Clue, because, you know, you got three different endings, you never know which one you're going to do.

895
01:55:10,254 --> 01:55:12,535
[SPEAKER_28]: So, here's Ross.

896
01:55:15,056 --> 01:55:15,616
[SPEAKER_29]: Very nice.

897
01:55:15,716 --> 01:55:17,717
[SPEAKER_29]: My number three movie is Revenge of the Nerds.

898
01:55:17,777 --> 01:55:17,997
[SPEAKER_29]: Why?

899
01:55:18,337 --> 01:55:23,319
[SPEAKER_29]: Because I can consider myself one, and hey, any movie with boobies is a winner in my book.

900
01:55:26,624 --> 01:55:31,206
[SPEAKER_21]: My number three movie is The Karate Kid because it's the only cool thing that Ralph Macchio ever did.

901
01:55:34,448 --> 01:55:35,309
[SPEAKER_27]: Too true.

902
01:55:37,690 --> 01:55:44,473
[SPEAKER_27]: My number three is Legend because it has a young Tom Cruise in chain mail.

903
01:55:45,154 --> 01:55:46,915
[SPEAKER_27]: No, not in chain mail, in his outfit.

904
01:55:47,635 --> 01:55:49,116
[SPEAKER_27]: And plus Tim Curry's a pimp.

905
01:55:50,897 --> 01:55:52,198
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, number two.

906
01:55:54,176 --> 01:55:59,880
[SPEAKER_28]: Number two for me is the one that everybody's been asking about, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

907
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:06,984
[SPEAKER_28]: Because, you know, when Cameron was in Egypt's land, let my Cameron go.

908
01:56:09,326 --> 01:56:12,728
[SPEAKER_29]: My number two was Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

909
01:56:13,448 --> 01:56:13,828
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

910
01:56:15,009 --> 01:56:15,570
[SPEAKER_29]: Phoebe Cates.

911
01:56:20,513 --> 01:56:22,534
[SPEAKER_21]: My number two was The NeverEnding Story.

912
01:56:24,321 --> 01:56:26,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that movie was like, cool.

913
01:56:27,184 --> 01:56:27,884
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

914
01:56:28,585 --> 01:56:29,005
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool.

915
01:56:30,787 --> 01:56:33,409
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that my favorite is going to get voted off, but I don't care.

916
01:56:33,789 --> 01:56:34,550
[SPEAKER_27]: It's Xanadu.

917
01:56:36,311 --> 01:56:37,653
[SPEAKER_27]: What other movie can you get?

918
01:56:38,033 --> 01:56:41,916
[SPEAKER_27]: Leg warmers and roller skates with one of the Bee Gees.

919
01:56:41,936 --> 01:56:43,938
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, he looked like he belonged to the Bee Gees anyway.

920
01:56:44,599 --> 01:56:46,861
[SPEAKER_27]: And Don Bluth animation on top of it.

921
01:56:46,881 --> 01:56:47,221
[SPEAKER_27]: Rolling.

922
01:56:47,953 --> 01:56:49,473
[SPEAKER_27]: and no, not Roller Babies.

923
01:56:50,353 --> 01:56:52,674
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually like that movie and I admit that it's bad.

924
01:56:53,214 --> 01:56:56,115
[SPEAKER_27]: But Xanadu was just like really cool.

925
01:56:56,175 --> 01:56:59,715
[SPEAKER_27]: Plus it had Olivia Newton-John in it and Electric Light Orchestra music.

926
01:56:59,915 --> 01:57:05,256
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, what do you mean?

927
01:57:06,036 --> 01:57:07,156
[SPEAKER_27]: They're all positive.

928
01:57:07,537 --> 01:57:12,017
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, what's your number?

929
01:57:12,117 --> 01:57:15,338
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, that's my number too then because I actually like the other movie better.

930
01:57:17,285 --> 01:57:18,526
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, number one.

931
01:57:19,106 --> 01:57:25,309
[SPEAKER_28]: This is my personal number one because I'm a sap and, you know, like John Hughes movies are like the pimp shit and all that.

932
01:57:26,190 --> 01:57:26,930
[SPEAKER_28]: Pretty in Pink.

933
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:30,712
[SPEAKER_28]: Because you, how can you not love John Cryer as Ducky?

934
01:57:30,972 --> 01:57:31,713
[SPEAKER_28]: He is just too cute.

935
01:57:34,334 --> 01:57:34,474
[SPEAKER_29]: Aww.

936
01:57:35,034 --> 01:57:38,696
[SPEAKER_29]: My number one movie was another movie with Molly Ringwald in it.

937
01:57:39,977 --> 01:57:41,337
[SPEAKER_29]: That would be Breakfast Club.

938
01:57:42,058 --> 01:57:46,040
[SPEAKER_29]: Classic, classic movie about nothing but Saturday morning detention.

939
01:57:48,959 --> 01:57:50,020
[SPEAKER_27]: and Judd Nelson was hot.

940
01:57:52,562 --> 01:57:57,686
[SPEAKER_21]: My number one movie is Back to the Future because that DeLorean kicks ass.

941
01:57:59,028 --> 01:58:03,531
[SPEAKER_21]: Christopher Lloyd is awesome and Michael J. Fox was even kind of cool at the time.

942
01:58:03,712 --> 01:58:06,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Plus I've watched it like seven times in the last three days.

943
01:58:06,814 --> 01:58:07,255
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

944
01:58:08,376 --> 01:58:09,296
[SPEAKER_28]: So you must be going crazy.

945
01:58:11,698 --> 01:58:15,741
[SPEAKER_27]: And here's my other fuck you of the week to Mystique for buying that for Dan.

946
01:58:16,061 --> 01:58:19,243
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I've had nothing but Back to the Future playing on the TV.

947
01:58:19,723 --> 01:58:20,524
[SPEAKER_27]: No, I'm kidding.

948
01:58:21,725 --> 01:58:25,007
[SPEAKER_27]: My number one... Yeah, the music was cool too.

949
01:58:25,147 --> 01:58:27,088
[SPEAKER_27]: My number one is Labyrinth.

950
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:31,892
[SPEAKER_27]: Because it has David Bowie.

951
01:58:36,655 --> 01:58:37,555
[SPEAKER_27]: No, Dan, don't go...

952
01:58:41,310 --> 01:58:43,852
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, no styling has pointed out something.

953
01:58:45,273 --> 01:58:46,514
[SPEAKER_27]: Nobody named Superman.

954
01:58:48,396 --> 01:58:49,737
[SPEAKER_27]: It was a 70s movie.

955
01:58:50,137 --> 01:58:49,737
1978.

956
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:54,001
[SPEAKER_27]: Although, the second one was 80.

957
01:58:55,342 --> 01:58:56,863
[SPEAKER_29]: The second one was not worth it.

958
01:58:57,103 --> 01:58:58,024
[SPEAKER_28]: The second one had Zod.

959
01:59:02,335 --> 01:59:03,616
[SPEAKER_27]: But it wasn't as cool as the first.

960
01:59:04,297 --> 01:59:06,639
[SPEAKER_29]: When I was a kid, Superman 2 looked awesome.

961
01:59:06,659 --> 01:59:13,845
[SPEAKER_21]: When I watched it later on, I was like, that's the worst looking set I've ever seen.

962
01:59:13,945 --> 01:59:18,730
[SPEAKER_27]: And then Superman 3 went all to hell because of it.

963
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:20,491
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, so chat room.

964
01:59:20,712 --> 01:59:23,674

[SPEAKER_27]: Movie Movie

967
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:11,226
[SPEAKER_28]: Hmm, I am going to vote off... I think I'm going to vote off Xanadu, just because I have issues against, you know, like, disco queens and shit.

968
02:00:15,628 --> 02:00:18,710
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm going to have to go knock off Adventures in Babysitting.

969
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:21,211
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know about that one.

970
02:00:21,231 --> 02:00:23,532
[SPEAKER_28]: Poor Jamie's tattoo of hers gone already.

971
02:00:30,455 --> 02:00:31,616
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty in Pink's gotta go.

972
02:00:33,158 --> 02:00:33,558
[SPEAKER_21]: Goodbye.

973
02:00:48,365 --> 02:00:52,747
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, so, um, we have our songs, we're gonna vote for the, uh, song!

974
02:00:53,007 --> 02:00:53,587
[SPEAKER_27]: Ugh, crap!

[SPEAKER_27]: Movies.

976
02:00:54,728 --> 02:00:55,829
[SPEAKER_27]: Movies.

977
02:00:56,329 --> 02:01:00,951
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to vote for the, uh, top, uh, three movies.

978
02:01:01,851 --> 02:01:03,072
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm posting them to the chatroom.

979
02:01:04,373 --> 02:01:04,733
[SPEAKER_27]: There you go.

980
02:01:05,693 --> 02:01:18,137
[SPEAKER_27]: What we have on our list is Weird Science, A Christmas Story, Aliens, Clue, The Karate Kid, Legend, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, The NeverEnding Story, The Breakfast Club, Back to the Future, and Labyrinth.

981
02:01:19,318 --> 02:01:20,698
[SPEAKER_27]: Black Lab, I'm going to kick you.

982
02:01:21,318 --> 02:01:23,379
[SPEAKER_27]: I know where you... Well, I don't know where you live.

983
02:01:23,699 --> 02:01:25,179
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, go ahead and start the voting now.

984
02:01:25,540 --> 02:01:26,120
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to...

985
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:32,866
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, whichever one of those was the best movie of the 80s, so we're going to go ahead and get started with a song.

986
02:01:32,886 --> 02:01:36,890
[SPEAKER_27]: You have five minutes to send in your votes, and if I feel nice, you might get a little bit more time.

987
02:01:37,410 --> 02:01:39,112
[SPEAKER_27]: But I don't normally feel nice, so go ahead.

988
02:02:48,568 --> 02:02:49,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_27]: And the winner wins.

1006
02:10:12,925 --> 02:10:13,785
[SPEAKER_27]: But what does the winner win?

1007
02:10:14,646 --> 02:10:17,048
[SPEAKER_27]: The winner wins the distinction of being cool.

1008
02:10:17,769 --> 02:10:21,011
[SPEAKER_27]: So, let's have a drumroll please for number three.

1009
02:10:23,413 --> 02:10:24,274
[SPEAKER_27]: Number three is Clue.

1010
02:10:24,754 --> 02:10:25,155
[SPEAKER_27]: Clue.

1011
02:10:27,185 --> 02:10:29,466
[SPEAKER_27]: Tim, another, a very good Tim Curry movie.

1012
02:10:29,886 --> 02:10:30,126
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1013
02:10:30,526 --> 02:10:32,347
[SPEAKER_21]: Madeline Kahn is awesome.

1014
02:10:32,367 --> 02:10:33,147
[SPEAKER_27]: It had Madeline Kahn.

1015
02:10:33,387 --> 02:10:36,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Flames on the sides of my face.

1016
02:10:36,969 --> 02:10:38,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Heaving, heaving breaths.

1017
02:10:40,330 --> 02:10:40,510
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1018
02:10:40,770 --> 02:10:44,452
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, actually, that was in, that line was in our, um, old intro.

1019
02:10:46,012 --> 02:10:47,113
[SPEAKER_28]: It was a Rob influence.

1020
02:10:47,453 --> 02:10:48,013
[SPEAKER_28]: Enough said.

1021
02:10:48,693 --> 02:10:48,893
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

1022
02:10:50,454 --> 02:10:55,656
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, our number two was Dicey's Future by A Last Minute Vote.

1023
02:10:57,054 --> 02:11:25,575
[SPEAKER_27]: and Dan feels rather thrilled at that the number one by a resounding number of voids voids, voids, voids, votes Ferris Bueller's Day Off you know there were a lot of movies that didn't get Raiders of the Lost Ark was mentioned Superman, but Superman was the 70's

1024
02:11:29,858 --> 02:11:30,078
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

1025
02:11:30,819 --> 02:11:38,501
[SPEAKER_27]: There were... But we... I'd say Ferris Bueller's Day Off, though, had to have been, like, one of the top movies of the 80s.

1026
02:11:39,901 --> 02:11:48,244
[SPEAKER_27]: Um... You know... It would be cool if they would put more 80s songs, though, in DDR and Beatmania.

1027
02:11:48,724 --> 02:11:49,724
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, we got The Reflex.

1028
02:11:50,945 --> 02:11:51,705
[SPEAKER_27]: That was pretty neat.

1029
02:11:53,125 --> 02:11:53,365
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

1030
02:11:53,866 --> 02:11:57,387
[SPEAKER_29]: And you have, like, a crop load of, like, songs that have been covered.

1031
02:11:57,907 --> 02:11:58,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Here...

1032
02:12:00,305 --> 02:12:03,807
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, like I said, you have a bunch of songs that have been covered.

1033
02:12:03,827 --> 02:12:12,092
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, like Xanadu, like Have You Never Been Mellow, so... Yeah, but covers aren't nearly close to the same thing.

1034
02:12:12,992 --> 02:12:15,093
[SPEAKER_29]: True, but they're there, kind of.

1035
02:12:15,774 --> 02:12:17,274
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, look at Smoke.

1036
02:12:17,555 --> 02:12:20,396
[SPEAKER_29]: That's from the 1973 Deep Purple song.

1037
02:12:23,438 --> 02:12:24,118
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

1038
02:12:24,138 --> 02:12:24,759
[SPEAKER_21]: I shot the sheriff.

1039
02:12:25,119 --> 02:12:28,681
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I heard that on the radio just the other day.

1040
02:12:30,019 --> 02:12:31,900
[SPEAKER_21]: Wasn't Boom Boom Dollar an 80s tune?

1041
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:37,922
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe, you know, an 80s tune in Japan or something.

1042
02:12:38,662 --> 02:12:39,603
[SPEAKER_28]: Mighty Fine In Dollar.

1043
02:12:42,063 --> 02:12:47,845
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I wish that there would be more 80s stuff, just if only to infuse the youngins with good... Oh boy.

1044
02:12:47,865 --> 02:12:48,206
[SPEAKER_21]: Goodness.

1045
02:12:48,246 --> 02:12:49,626
[SPEAKER_28]: Gosh, well, let's see.

1046
02:12:49,666 --> 02:12:50,366
[SPEAKER_28]: There's...

1047
02:12:59,065 --> 02:13:02,006
[SPEAKER_29]: What's other 80s and 70s stuff, like all the Casey and the Sunshine Band stuff?

1048
02:13:03,106 --> 02:13:04,626
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for speaking with this great topic.

1049
02:13:04,726 --> 02:13:04,786
[SPEAKER_28]: 70s?

1050
02:13:06,547 --> 02:13:08,087
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, disco, yeah.

1051
02:13:08,427 --> 02:13:13,188
[SPEAKER_28]: Disco's cool and all, but, I mean, you're comparing apples and oranges.

1052
02:13:13,228 --> 02:13:18,289
[SPEAKER_28]: You're talking about, you know, like, Miracle versus Disco Inferno.

1053
02:13:18,349 --> 02:13:18,749
[SPEAKER_28]: Come on.

1054
02:13:19,029 --> 02:13:19,569
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, fine.

1055
02:13:19,589 --> 02:13:20,050
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not fair.

1056
02:13:20,070 --> 02:13:21,950
[SPEAKER_21]: All the disco stuff's awesome.

1057
02:13:23,775 --> 02:13:25,656
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm like trying to do the mic pass here.

1058
02:13:25,676 --> 02:13:26,736
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, it's pretty hard.

1059
02:13:26,936 --> 02:13:28,577
[SPEAKER_21]: You probably heard about half what everyone says.

1060
02:13:28,637 --> 02:13:29,297
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not your fault.

1061
02:13:30,357 --> 02:13:31,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Bad mic setup.

1062
02:13:32,878 --> 02:13:39,361
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, and in case you guys hadn't quite caught it yet, Little Miss Jamie is in the poopy pot right now.

1063
02:13:39,501 --> 02:13:40,641
[SPEAKER_28]: Yet again.

1064
02:13:41,521 --> 02:13:42,282
[SPEAKER_29]: Yet again.

1065
02:13:42,842 --> 02:13:45,303
[SPEAKER_28]: Because she has had too much Propel.

1066
02:13:45,883 --> 02:13:46,923
[SPEAKER_28]: Imagine that.

1067
02:13:47,003 --> 02:13:48,064
[SPEAKER_21]: Propel her into the bathroom.

1068
02:13:49,031 --> 02:13:50,731
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, she's being propelled onto the toilet.

1069
02:13:50,751 --> 02:13:52,752
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't believe y'all didn't vote for Back to the Future.

1070
02:13:52,772 --> 02:13:53,972
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, come on, really.

1071
02:13:54,132 --> 02:13:57,773
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, it's available in a nice trilogy box set now at finer stores everywhere.

1072
02:13:58,233 --> 02:14:00,594
[SPEAKER_28]: But is it fixed?

1073
02:14:00,714 --> 02:14:07,216
[SPEAKER_28]: Apparently there was an issue with the second and third movies not being available in widescreen.

1074
02:14:07,576 --> 02:14:08,556
[SPEAKER_21]: That seemed to work on mine.

1075
02:14:09,196 --> 02:14:12,297
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe you got the second set then, because they were supposed to re-release them.

1076
02:14:12,617 --> 02:14:13,017
[SPEAKER_21]: Probably.

1077
02:14:18,922 --> 02:14:24,850
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, that is actually a point of debate, though, people being concerned over widescreen over fullscreen.

1078
02:14:25,210 --> 02:14:28,655
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, there's no debate there.

1079
02:14:28,675 --> 02:14:31,258
[SPEAKER_21]: People over widescreen are mindless, idiotic zombies.

1080
02:14:31,278 --> 02:14:32,220
[SPEAKER_27]: Dan, they can't hear that.

1081
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:37,001
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want my stuff cut off.

1082
02:14:37,121 --> 02:14:37,661
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1083
02:15:04,211 --> 02:15:05,212
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't get why it is, though.

1084
02:15:32,208 --> 02:15:32,568
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura.com

1085
02:15:42,048 --> 02:16:10,059
[SPEAKER_27]: they had Steven Seagal wasn't on there but they had someone portraying Steven Seagal and they had super wide Steven vision Seagala vision that was it and they had the widescreen so wide that you could see like stuff that was like off the set you could see the guy over in the other room you know going to the bathroom or eating or something and then all of the extras over there getting food off the table but uh

1086
02:16:12,170 --> 02:16:15,211
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a... I don't see why people enjoy that.

1087
02:16:16,471 --> 02:16:21,513
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, we can't all have mics because the splitter that I bought was not the right splitter and we couldn't find one.

1088
02:16:23,374 --> 02:16:23,794
[SPEAKER_27]: I agree.

1089
02:16:24,274 --> 02:16:25,674
[SPEAKER_27]: Dan said, dude, that's booty.

1090
02:16:25,694 --> 02:16:27,335
[SPEAKER_27]: I totally want a mic.

1091
02:16:28,115 --> 02:16:28,975
[SPEAKER_27]: Dan wants a mic.

1092
02:16:28,995 --> 02:16:30,816
[SPEAKER_27]: See, Dan's got his taste of radio now.

1093
02:16:32,576 --> 02:16:33,557
[SPEAKER_27]: They said they can hear you.

1094
02:16:34,757 --> 02:16:34,997
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

1095
02:16:35,017 --> 02:16:35,797
[SPEAKER_29]: He likes the power.

1096
02:16:35,817 --> 02:16:36,298
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm a pimp.

1097
02:16:37,698 --> 02:16:39,439
[SPEAKER_27]: Did you hear him say that he's a pimp?

1098
02:16:39,659 --> 02:16:40,719
[SPEAKER_27]: He said you're loud.

1099
02:16:43,951 --> 02:16:49,556
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that's... He sticks out like a hitchhiker's thumb.

1100
02:16:52,579 --> 02:16:53,440
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not dumb.

1101
02:16:55,262 --> 02:16:56,523
[SPEAKER_27]: Dan's gonna get kicked in a minute.

1102
02:16:59,006 --> 02:16:59,326
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway.

1103
02:17:01,628 --> 02:17:02,089
[SPEAKER_27]: So, uh...

1104
02:17:04,068 --> 02:17:12,659
[SPEAKER_27]: We actually, now we've got comments coming in about Alan Rickman movies, so that makes me feel all happy and joyous.

1105
02:17:14,761 --> 02:17:23,252
[SPEAKER_27]: So, as far as the sim update, I'm going to be fully honest, I don't keep up with the sims.

1106
02:17:24,244 --> 02:17:30,226
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, some people keep up with the game, The Sims, but I don't keep up with the simulators or anything.

1107
02:17:30,386 --> 02:17:36,487
[SPEAKER_27]: I understand that the Tourney Mix 3 deal didn't go as well as some people had wished that it would.

1108
02:17:37,968 --> 02:17:41,849
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to have a full update on that one next week when Loki is back on the radio.

1109
02:17:46,101 --> 02:17:56,130
[SPEAKER_27]: Hopefully though, he did mention something about having unlimited access to get all of those things hosted up on the site so we'll be able to let everybody know and we'll probably put something up on our webpage.

1110
02:17:56,571 --> 02:18:08,762
[SPEAKER_27]: By the way, again, for people who are wanting to participate in chat, just go to orangelounge.skie.cx and there is a link to our chat room located there on the site and you can participate in all the madness and

1111
02:18:10,447 --> 02:18:17,072
[SPEAKER_27]: We actually had a couple people saying that Tourney Mix 3 actually was pretty good.

1112
02:18:17,232 --> 02:18:19,254
[SPEAKER_27]: So, what was good about it?

1113
02:18:19,354 --> 02:18:20,415
[SPEAKER_27]: What was good about Tourney Mix 3?

1114
02:18:20,675 --> 02:18:21,936
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't participate in any of that.

1115
02:18:22,717 --> 02:18:27,741
[SPEAKER_27]: By the way, we also... There's a Matt's Edit contest, Make Edit Get Porn.

1116
02:18:30,062 --> 02:18:32,104
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, it's called Make Edit Get Porn.

1117
02:18:33,585 --> 02:18:36,047
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's going to be in a couple of weeks is when that's going to expire.

1118
02:18:36,067 --> 02:18:39,490
[SPEAKER_27]: It was supposed to be last week, but nobody... Well, we only had...

1119
02:18:41,343 --> 02:18:44,585
[SPEAKER_27]: We only had two entries from what I understand.

1120
02:18:45,345 --> 02:18:51,950
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's going to be anything that's in Max USA for the United States.

1121
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:53,831
[SPEAKER_27]: Make your edit for that.

1122
02:18:53,991 --> 02:18:55,512
[SPEAKER_27]: Send it in to Matt one way or another.

1123
02:18:57,213 --> 02:18:59,774
[SPEAKER_27]: You can send it to me if you want to and I'll get it to him.

1124
02:18:59,854 --> 02:19:01,976
[SPEAKER_27]: But you win this contest.

1125
02:19:01,996 --> 02:19:03,257
[SPEAKER_27]: There's only one winner, by the way.

1126
02:19:03,377 --> 02:19:04,237
[SPEAKER_27]: But you win the contest.

1127
02:19:04,457 --> 02:19:05,178
[SPEAKER_27]: You get porn.

1128
02:19:05,958 --> 02:19:11,340
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, it's not like hardcore stuff, but it's more like Skinamax-style porn and Playmate of the Year and crap like that.

1129
02:19:12,061 --> 02:19:13,281
[SPEAKER_27]: Girls Gone Wild, ooh!

1130
02:19:13,981 --> 02:19:14,662
[SPEAKER_29]: Snoop Dogg version.

1131
02:19:15,002 --> 02:19:18,783
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I'm wondering why they don't have, you know, Men Gone Wild.

1132
02:19:20,424 --> 02:19:22,325
[SPEAKER_27]: I would be all over that.

1133
02:19:23,533 --> 02:19:23,953
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry, Dan.

1134
02:19:24,473 --> 02:19:27,875
[SPEAKER_21]: If you don't want to see the kind of guy who would just whoop out his dong.

1135
02:19:28,235 --> 02:19:28,995
[SPEAKER_27]: If it's big enough.

1136
02:19:30,275 --> 02:19:30,916
[SPEAKER_27]: If he's hot.

1137
02:19:34,417 --> 02:19:35,317
[SPEAKER_27]: Dan, dear.

1138
02:19:35,337 --> 02:19:35,937
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to leave the room.

1139
02:19:36,017 --> 02:19:41,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Only hot chicks take off their tops.

1140
02:19:41,519 --> 02:19:44,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, mostly.

1141
02:19:45,701 --> 02:19:51,463
[SPEAKER_27]: But, seriously, if you're just not getting any and you need your porn fix, send in your edit.

1142
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:56,222
[SPEAKER_27]: You might just get lucky.

1143
02:19:56,402 --> 02:19:58,543
[SPEAKER_27]: All five of your fingers will be lucky.

1144
02:20:00,584 --> 02:20:03,285
[SPEAKER_28]: Either in a fap or a schlicking.

1145
02:20:03,325 --> 02:20:05,426
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, either in a fap.

1146
02:20:05,446 --> 02:20:08,568
[SPEAKER_27]: You can play fap fap revolution at home.

1147
02:20:08,728 --> 02:20:10,969
[SPEAKER_28]: Or schlick schlick if that's your thing.

1148
02:20:11,829 --> 02:20:13,830
[SPEAKER_28]: Or schlick schlick revolution if that's your thing.

1149
02:20:15,151 --> 02:20:15,491
[SPEAKER_27]: Indeed.

1150
02:20:16,212 --> 02:20:18,153
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, everybody wants porn.

1151
02:20:18,173 --> 02:20:18,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not mention the porn.

1152
02:20:20,251 --> 02:20:23,734
[SPEAKER_27]: According to Maple, everybody that wants porn is busy getting porn.

1153
02:20:25,255 --> 02:20:34,621
[SPEAKER_27]: So, uh, MP4 style.

1154
02:20:35,542 --> 02:20:42,647
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, I think that it's time that, uh, I think it's time that, uh, maybe we went to another break, don't you think?

1155
02:20:45,369 --> 02:20:46,970
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have to go to the bathroom again.

1156
02:20:48,911 --> 02:20:53,052
[SPEAKER_27]: Yet, but I'm on my second bottle of Propel, who knows.

1157
02:20:54,313 --> 02:20:55,593
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know, what do we want to listen to today?

1158
02:20:55,613 --> 02:20:57,614
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you have any requests?

1159
02:20:58,454 --> 02:21:01,755
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't want to listen to Satan Rock.

1160
02:21:03,896 --> 02:21:04,456
[SPEAKER_27]: What track is it?

1161
02:21:05,877 --> 02:21:07,577
[SPEAKER_27]: What track is it?

1162
02:21:07,878 --> 02:21:08,498
[SPEAKER_27]: Hold on for a second.

1163
02:21:11,419 --> 02:21:12,259
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the original one.

1164
02:21:13,279 --> 02:21:14,540
[SPEAKER_28]: So you can play one of the originals.

1165
02:21:15,460 --> 02:21:17,441
[SPEAKER_28]: We're trying to figure out songs to play, so we're like...

1166
02:21:18,955 --> 02:21:23,297
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a request for Boom Boom Dollar, but I don't know if Jamie's going to circumvent that or not.

1167
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:32,821
[SPEAKER_28]: So Jamie's playing with tracks.

1168
02:21:32,861 --> 02:21:35,842
[SPEAKER_28]: She's having fun and just kind of tossing things around.

1169
02:21:36,322 --> 02:21:39,724
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're sitting in a car between two guys, is it okay to get wood?

1170
02:21:40,344 --> 02:21:41,604
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not even okay to ask.

1171
02:21:45,486 --> 02:21:45,966
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go.

1172
02:21:45,986 --> 02:21:46,987
[SPEAKER_28]: You're uber fun.

1173
02:21:49,161 --> 02:21:50,121
[SPEAKER_28]: Those are the free songs.

1174
02:21:50,902 --> 02:21:53,123
[SPEAKER_28]: The free song solo cake.

1175
02:21:54,323 --> 02:21:56,204
[SPEAKER_28]: We're running out of things to sing.

1176
02:21:56,985 --> 02:21:57,525
[SPEAKER_21]: Help!

1177
02:22:00,166 --> 02:22:01,326
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie's playing with music.

1178
02:22:01,407 --> 02:22:02,927
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, do me a favor.

1179
02:22:03,187 --> 02:22:04,108
[SPEAKER_29]: Throw in one of those.

1180
02:22:04,548 --> 02:22:07,189
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, one is the originals, and one is the free song.

1181
02:22:07,429 --> 02:22:07,669
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1182
02:22:16,078 --> 02:22:20,100
[SPEAKER_27]: We had a request for Beautiful 21C, and I thought it was on one of these discs, but you know what?

1183
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:23,262
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have Beautiful 21C, but I will, eventually.

1184
02:22:24,283 --> 02:22:27,445
[SPEAKER_27]: So, let's go back to... Yeah, next week on Orange Lounge.

1185
02:22:28,585 --> 02:22:28,905
[SPEAKER_27]: We're gonna...

1186
02:22:31,223 --> 02:22:37,147
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to go ahead and look for a song that was requested.

1187
02:22:37,568 --> 02:22:38,008
[SPEAKER_27]: What style?

1188
02:22:38,508 --> 02:22:38,728
[SPEAKER_27]: Third.

1189
02:22:39,309 --> 02:22:49,096
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, from third style, Beat Me Into Dicks third style, we're going to, assuming that I have the song, we're going to go ahead and start it off with a request.

1190
02:22:49,196 --> 02:22:49,696
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have it.

1191
02:22:51,017 --> 02:22:51,998
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have Macho Gang.

1192
02:22:56,521 --> 02:22:57,782
[SPEAKER_27]: Second style, I have...

1193
02:22:59,980 --> 02:23:02,029
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, we are playing Macho Gang.

1194
02:23:02,310 --> 02:23:02,671
[SPEAKER_27]: Enjoy.

1195
02:23:03,615 --> 02:23:04,378
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, anal fighter.

1196
02:24:47,465 --> 02:24:48,151
Thanks for watching!

1197
02:29:46,365 --> 02:29:48,071
[SPEAKER_06]: SOS, The Tigers Took My Family

1198
02:30:37,466 --> 02:30:39,007
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1199
02:31:16,283 --> 02:31:17,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1200
02:33:38,052 --> 02:33:39,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1201
02:35:38,513 --> 02:35:44,299
[SPEAKER_23]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1202
02:35:44,679 --> 02:35:47,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're back and we're on the home stretch of the show.

1203
02:35:56,519 --> 02:36:05,887
[SPEAKER_27]: We did get a request for a very funny song, and unfortunately I haven't been able to quite get it just yet, but I can't promise anything.

1204
02:36:06,468 --> 02:36:12,173
[SPEAKER_27]: We may be able to have that ready for the afterbirth of the show.

1205
02:36:13,534 --> 02:36:19,580
[SPEAKER_27]: Ross was bringing up something very interesting earlier about Japanese video games, about some of these weird ones.

1206
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:20,961
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you mind telling us about it?

1207
02:36:23,925 --> 02:36:27,826
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, I mean, you've seen some of the stuff, like the ones where you have to walk the dog.

1208
02:36:27,866 --> 02:36:28,566
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, come on now.

1209
02:36:29,906 --> 02:36:35,407
[SPEAKER_29]: Goodness, South End Mall in Hayward had the one where they had the butt, and you had to have the paddle, and you had to spank it.

1210
02:36:36,147 --> 02:36:37,007
[SPEAKER_29]: It didn't last too long.

1211
02:36:37,387 --> 02:36:38,088
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's just say that.

1212
02:36:38,588 --> 02:36:41,968
[SPEAKER_29]: When I had, you know, some friends of mine walking up behind it and trying to mount it.

1213
02:36:43,829 --> 02:36:44,969
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, it's not going to last long.

1214
02:36:45,529 --> 02:36:46,769
[SPEAKER_29]: South End Mall did have something cool, though.

1215
02:36:47,089 --> 02:36:50,730
[SPEAKER_29]: They did have the Monkey Ball arcade game, which had a banana for a joystick.

1216
02:36:51,997 --> 02:36:52,998
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't have them here anymore.

1217
02:36:53,018 --> 02:36:53,658
[SPEAKER_29]: Just do a search on Yahoo.

1218
02:37:18,863 --> 02:37:22,244
[SPEAKER_29]: And Jamie is over here playing with stuff.

1219
02:37:24,825 --> 02:37:29,347
[SPEAKER_27]: I tried going to 3brain.com to try to find this song to play by request.

1220
02:37:29,867 --> 02:37:36,570
[SPEAKER_27]: And when you click on the low HTML version of the page, it gives you a smiley face done in text.

1221
02:37:37,550 --> 02:37:38,971
[SPEAKER_27]: Jamie, you were saying about those games.

1222
02:37:39,031 --> 02:37:40,051
[SPEAKER_27]: Tell about the lobster game.

1223
02:37:40,872 --> 02:37:41,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoa.

1224
02:37:42,287 --> 02:37:48,171
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a site where I saw, basically, you know one of those crane games where you win stuffed animals and stuff?

1225
02:37:48,631 --> 02:37:49,572
[SPEAKER_29]: They had live lobster.

1226
02:37:50,172 --> 02:37:50,913
[SPEAKER_29]: This is great.

1227
02:37:51,813 --> 02:37:59,699
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, they're, you know, the claws are all taped up and you just plop in your money and if you're lucky, you'll have dinner that night.

1228
02:38:00,239 --> 02:38:00,719
[SPEAKER_29]: Lobster.

1229
02:38:00,999 --> 02:38:02,120
[SPEAKER_29]: It's good stuff.

1230
02:38:02,961 --> 02:38:03,641
[SPEAKER_29]: How can you lose?

1231
02:38:03,681 --> 02:38:06,303
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, it's a little inhumane, but this is Japan.

1232
02:38:06,403 --> 02:38:06,883
[SPEAKER_29]: Who cares?

1233
02:38:08,384 --> 02:38:08,705
[SPEAKER_29]: Really.

1234
02:38:09,125 --> 02:38:09,305
[SPEAKER_27]: I do.

1235
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:13,002
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, yeah, that is a little inhumane.

1236
02:38:36,215 --> 02:38:36,535
[SPEAKER_29]: A little?

1237
02:38:37,756 --> 02:38:38,617
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, it's a little.

1238
02:38:38,657 --> 02:38:39,978
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, okay, look at this.

1239
02:38:40,358 --> 02:38:41,239
[SPEAKER_29]: Walk the dog.

1240
02:38:43,801 --> 02:38:45,222
[SPEAKER_28]: Why not just go out and walk the dog?

1241
02:38:45,423 --> 02:38:45,863
[SPEAKER_29]: Exactly.

1242
02:38:45,983 --> 02:38:52,889
[SPEAKER_29]: I guess, you know, for people who live in apartment complexes with no dogs and no pets, this is the only thing that they can really do.

1243
02:38:54,750 --> 02:38:56,632
[SPEAKER_29]: They'd be remotely close to walking the dog.

1244
02:39:02,625 --> 02:39:07,707
[SPEAKER_28]: We're watching Jamie go through 3Brain.com right now, and she can't find it.

1245
02:39:08,707 --> 02:39:12,788
[SPEAKER_27]: The song is not up on 3Brain.com, so I'm going to have to find it a different way.

1246
02:39:15,169 --> 02:39:25,292
[SPEAKER_27]: I had it probably burned off, but if all else fails, I'll try to have it for next week, for next week's little fortune cookie.

1247
02:39:26,181 --> 02:39:29,183
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, we're needing new material for our fortune cookie.

1248
02:39:29,623 --> 02:39:33,286
[SPEAKER_27]: So if anybody happens to have anything that you think is funny, save it for us.

1249
02:39:33,446 --> 02:39:37,709
[SPEAKER_27]: And who knows, maybe your little comedy clip might make it on for one of our fortune cookies of the week.

1250
02:39:39,810 --> 02:39:45,534
[SPEAKER_27]: But you know, there were some of those really interesting games that I really wish that they'd bring out in the U.S.

1251
02:39:46,395 --> 02:39:49,237
[SPEAKER_27]: I like playing that photo game.

1252
02:39:50,527 --> 02:39:52,809
[SPEAKER_27]: That photo game was cool, as I suck at it.

1253
02:39:52,970 --> 02:39:53,690
[SPEAKER_29]: They have one at Burt's Place.

1254
02:40:03,507 --> 02:40:04,868
[SPEAKER_27]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1255
02:40:26,460 --> 02:40:30,988
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a bunch of different Japanese games, like the Walking the Dog game.

1256
02:40:31,408 --> 02:40:33,391
[SPEAKER_27]: But the game that I want to play is Taiko War.

1257
02:40:35,846 --> 02:40:38,487
[SPEAKER_27]: Tycho, for anyone who doesn't know, is a type of Japanese drumming.

1258
02:40:38,507 --> 02:40:42,308
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, I've actually got two of those drums in my Animal Crossing house by my fire.

1259
02:40:43,448 --> 02:40:47,809
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, but this is one where basically you play the drum.

1260
02:40:47,889 --> 02:40:49,710
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, actually, I think it's really cool.

1261
02:40:50,490 --> 02:40:53,071
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't have the links immediately with me, but I'll try to find them for next week.

1262
02:40:53,711 --> 02:40:55,511
[SPEAKER_27]: Namco has done a series of music games.

1263
02:40:55,911 --> 02:40:56,291
[SPEAKER_27]: Really?

1264
02:40:56,451 --> 02:40:58,652
[SPEAKER_27]: They've done a guitar simulation game.

1265
02:40:59,172 --> 02:40:59,872
[SPEAKER_27]: Every single one of them.

1266
02:40:59,912 --> 02:41:02,273
[SPEAKER_27]: They've done... We just sued them over.

1267
02:41:02,293 --> 02:41:02,533
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I could...

1268
02:41:03,135 --> 02:41:06,198
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, Dan was saying that every single which one, Konami sued them over.

1269
02:41:07,439 --> 02:41:20,871
[SPEAKER_27]: But they've done a guitar game, they've done a keyboard game that actually looks like it might kick Keyboard Mania's ass, because it actually goes with music, so you have to read the music and play it.

1270
02:41:20,951 --> 02:41:25,214
[SPEAKER_27]: There's an auto-harp game, if I remember correctly.

1271
02:41:27,096 --> 02:41:28,978
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm still waiting for them to make Sax Maniacs.

1272
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:32,022
[SPEAKER_28]: I want Boner Freaks.

1273
02:41:32,422 --> 02:41:33,283
[SPEAKER_27]: Boner Freaks.

1274
02:41:33,543 --> 02:41:34,624
[SPEAKER_27]: I want Boner Freaks.

1275
02:41:34,644 --> 02:41:35,604
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, you play Trombone.

1276
02:41:40,048 --> 02:41:40,728
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't make that.

1277
02:41:42,970 --> 02:41:43,410
[SPEAKER_27]: Dead.

1278
02:41:44,031 --> 02:41:44,731
[SPEAKER_27]: Boner Freaks.

1279
02:41:45,131 --> 02:41:45,952

02:42:47,557 --> 02:42:47,857
[SPEAKER_29]: I cry.

1295
02:42:47,877 --> 02:42:48,878
[SPEAKER_29]: Riverdance mania.

1296
02:42:49,498 --> 02:42:51,019
[SPEAKER_29]: Riverdance mania!

1297
02:42:51,660 --> 02:42:52,901
[SPEAKER_28]: Dude, no, all you have to do...

1298
02:42:55,590 --> 02:42:56,670
[SPEAKER_27]: The Lord of the Dance!

1299
02:42:57,310 --> 02:42:58,991
[SPEAKER_27]: I am the Führer of the Dance!

1300
02:42:59,991 --> 02:43:02,331
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

1301
02:43:02,391 --> 02:43:03,631
[SPEAKER_27]: River Dance Revolution.

1302
02:43:05,452 --> 02:43:09,132
[SPEAKER_27]: No, um, they need the Kunio version, River City Dance Revolution.

1303
02:43:10,793 --> 02:43:18,894
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, um, well, you know, really, if you want a River Dance to DDR, all you have to do is play, uh, Captain Jack Basic.

1304
02:43:21,254 --> 02:43:22,355
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, thank you.

1305
02:43:24,135 --> 02:43:24,455
[SPEAKER_27]: But, um,

1306
02:43:28,685 --> 02:43:31,406
[SPEAKER_27]: We're having some discussion here now on old school games.

1307
02:43:32,346 --> 02:43:35,988
[SPEAKER_27]: River City Ransom, it's called Hot-Blooded Downtown Story.

1308
02:43:37,748 --> 02:43:46,171
[SPEAKER_27]: And then there was the... Dan's just going off on making up neat little meat mania.

1309
02:43:48,231 --> 02:43:48,811
[SPEAKER_27]: Meet Mania.

1310
02:43:52,512 --> 02:43:56,673
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm actually imagining that now as like, you know, Iron Chef.

1311
02:43:56,833 --> 02:44:01,094
[SPEAKER_27]: They should have an Iron Chef video game.

1312
02:44:02,234 --> 02:44:05,035
[SPEAKER_27]: Apparently there are Iron Chef video games on Saturn.

1313
02:44:09,296 --> 02:44:11,917
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what, let's go ahead and check our good friends at eBay.com.

1314
02:44:15,478 --> 02:44:16,318
[SPEAKER_27]: We've got two Saturns.

1315
02:44:17,299 --> 02:44:17,719
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's see.

1316
02:44:18,339 --> 02:44:22,622
[SPEAKER_27]: Iron Chef Saturn.

1317
02:44:24,122 --> 02:44:25,263
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's see if we find any.

1318
02:44:25,503 --> 02:44:28,725
[SPEAKER_27]: No, there are none posted.

1319
02:44:28,925 --> 02:44:30,445
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's look up Iron Chef Game.

1320
02:44:31,366 --> 02:44:31,986
[SPEAKER_27]: I love eBay.

1321
02:44:33,567 --> 02:44:35,468
[SPEAKER_27]: There are no Iron Chef Games.

1322
02:44:38,089 --> 02:44:39,670
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's look up Sega Saturn.

1323
02:44:43,018 --> 02:44:44,659
[SPEAKER_27]: The Greatest Game Company of All Time.

1324
02:44:44,819 --> 02:44:47,021
[SPEAKER_27]: And there are none posted on right now.

1325
02:44:50,183 --> 02:44:51,104
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll look up Chef.

1326
02:44:53,545 --> 02:44:54,726
[SPEAKER_27]: We have South Park.

1327
02:44:55,467 --> 02:44:58,569
[SPEAKER_29]: Chef's Love Shack.

1328
02:44:59,550 --> 02:45:01,711
[SPEAKER_27]: And a Disney Chinese Chef Goofy.

1329
02:45:02,292 --> 02:45:03,973
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, this is cute!

1330
02:45:05,874 --> 02:45:08,156
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe Sega put it out for their plushie line.

1331
02:45:08,176 --> 02:45:08,316
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

1332
02:45:10,022 --> 02:45:12,965
[SPEAKER_27]: Your Mom Revolution, Particle Man Revolution.

1333
02:45:13,846 --> 02:45:15,407
[SPEAKER_27]: I want Triangle Freaks.

1334
02:45:16,989 --> 02:45:23,194
[SPEAKER_27]: With a giant triangle and a big, like, pole, and you bang the sides of the triangle to a triangular screen.

1335
02:45:24,916 --> 02:45:29,960
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, Fish Fish Revolution would be like the Swedish Chef game where you try to hit targets with a fish.

1336
02:45:31,001 --> 02:45:32,122
Wark, wark, wark, woo!

1337
02:45:32,142 --> 02:45:33,764
Wark, wark, wark!

1338
02:45:37,896 --> 02:45:41,858
[SPEAKER_27]: No, that would be Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls.

1339
02:45:43,980 --> 02:45:45,360
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, Chocolate Salty Ball.

1340
02:45:46,001 --> 02:45:46,961
[SPEAKER_27]: They're having a hoedown.

1341
02:45:47,061 --> 02:45:47,682
[SPEAKER_27]: Yee-haw.

1342
02:45:50,223 --> 02:45:53,925
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, we could just, we should actually make our own video game company.

1343
02:45:54,906 --> 02:45:58,828
[SPEAKER_27]: And just, there'll be eight, Namten to come.

1344
02:46:00,929 --> 02:46:03,491
[SPEAKER_12]: How about, how about, uh... I like Tengenami.

1345
02:46:10,056 --> 02:46:12,798
[SPEAKER_27]: Then it would be Sonygen.

1346
02:46:13,859 --> 02:46:14,699
[SPEAKER_27]: Then it would be Sonygen.

1347
02:46:15,420 --> 02:46:17,701
[SPEAKER_27]: Speaking of corrupt and evil.

1348
02:46:18,001 --> 02:46:19,162
[SPEAKER_27]: It was corrupt and evil.

1349
02:46:19,222 --> 02:46:21,804
[SPEAKER_27]: Combine them with Sony and you have the ultimate evil empire.

1350
02:46:22,564 --> 02:46:24,745
[SPEAKER_27]: And that if their games were all distributed at Fry's.

1351
02:46:24,865 --> 02:46:27,167
[SPEAKER_27]: Nintendo Graphics.

1352
02:46:27,867 --> 02:46:28,428
[SPEAKER_27]: What's that for?

1353
02:46:28,448 --> 02:46:31,850
[SPEAKER_29]: That's for the Sega Nintendo Turbo Graphics.

1354
02:46:32,710 --> 02:46:33,791
[SPEAKER_29]: Dude, I would play that.

1355
02:46:38,443 --> 02:46:38,784
[SPEAKER_21]: You know.

1356
02:46:39,424 --> 02:46:44,910
[SPEAKER_21]: Ross Ross Revolution.

1357
02:46:45,090 --> 02:46:45,630
[SPEAKER_27]: There you go.

1358
02:46:46,731 --> 02:46:47,732
[SPEAKER_28]: Wait, wait, wait.

1359
02:46:47,772 --> 02:46:49,514
[SPEAKER_28]: There's nobody playing Ross but me.

1360
02:46:50,495 --> 02:46:51,616
[SPEAKER_28]: Just for the record.

1361
02:46:51,736 --> 02:46:54,359
[SPEAKER_28]: I am the only person that gets to play Ross.

1362
02:46:54,459 --> 02:46:55,760
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you stomp to his beat?

1363
02:46:55,800 --> 02:46:56,661
[SPEAKER_27]: I stomp to his beat.

1364
02:46:59,895 --> 02:47:01,936
[SPEAKER_27]: Beatmania, huh?

1365
02:47:03,877 --> 02:47:04,517
[SPEAKER_27]: White Revolution.

1366
02:47:04,817 --> 02:47:05,917
[SPEAKER_27]: What do you think she's going to do?

1367
02:47:05,957 --> 02:47:08,619
[SPEAKER_27]: Team up with the other golden girls and eat cheesecake?

1368
02:47:11,340 --> 02:47:13,020
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe one of them is going to have a heart attack?

1369
02:47:13,881 --> 02:47:16,722
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1370
02:47:17,682 --> 02:47:19,703
[SPEAKER_29]: If we had our own video game company, what would we specialize in?

1371
02:47:20,463 --> 02:47:21,104
[SPEAKER_28]: Simulations.

1372
02:47:24,042 --> 02:47:29,486
[SPEAKER_27]: We would do real life sim where it's like... I want to simulate making a bowl of cereal.

1373
02:47:29,566 --> 02:47:30,326
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, cooking.

1374
02:47:30,367 --> 02:47:30,987
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what I want to say.

1375
02:47:31,007 --> 02:47:31,327
[SPEAKER_28]: Cooking.

1376
02:47:31,788 --> 02:47:32,928
[SPEAKER_28]: A cooking simulation.

1377
02:47:33,629 --> 02:47:34,049
[SPEAKER_27]: No, no.

1378
02:47:34,129 --> 02:47:35,390
[SPEAKER_27]: They actually have a game.

1379
02:47:36,391 --> 02:47:40,834
[SPEAKER_27]: Again, it's another one of those goofy Japanese games where you work in a restaurant and you have to make people's orders.

1380
02:47:41,574 --> 02:47:42,795
[SPEAKER_27]: Like sandwiches and stuff.

1381
02:47:42,815 --> 02:47:43,776
[SPEAKER_27]: Tapper.

1382
02:47:43,956 --> 02:47:46,558
[SPEAKER_27]: No, it's not... Tapper.

1383
02:47:47,579 --> 02:47:53,303
[SPEAKER_27]: But no, in this game, if you don't make their order exactly the way they want it, then you lose points.

1384
02:47:54,252 --> 02:48:05,255
[SPEAKER_27]: Of course, there's also the egg-flipping game that was at AI, where you flip the pan and try to catch the thing, but it was broken.

1385
02:48:07,195 --> 02:48:14,637
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, that actually is another thing.

1386
02:48:14,657 --> 02:48:17,037
[SPEAKER_27]: They could sell, you know they have those live dolls?

1387
02:48:17,618 --> 02:48:20,038
[SPEAKER_27]: They could sell, like, the Ultimate Sim version.

1388
02:48:21,318 --> 02:48:23,119
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, you hook it up to your Xbox.

1389
02:48:24,346 --> 02:48:26,488
[SPEAKER_27]: Because the Xbox isn't good for hardly anything else anyway.

1390
02:48:26,508 --> 02:48:28,430
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes a great paperweight.

1391
02:48:28,450 --> 02:48:29,310
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes a great paperweight.

1392
02:48:29,330 --> 02:48:30,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Jump Rope Revolution.

1393
02:48:30,191 --> 02:48:31,512
[SPEAKER_27]: Jump Rope Revolution.

1394
02:48:34,415 --> 02:48:38,639
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, actually, if they did a square dancing game for DDR, like, that would be cool.

1395
02:48:39,159 --> 02:48:40,480
[SPEAKER_27]: Where you actually play with a partner.

1396
02:48:43,283 --> 02:48:44,864
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, that would be pretty neat.

1397
02:48:45,385 --> 02:48:45,605
[SPEAKER_27]: What?

1398
02:48:45,725 --> 02:48:47,146
[SPEAKER_27]: Dan Dan Revolution.

1399
02:48:47,247 --> 02:48:48,267
[SPEAKER_27]: I play that every day, yo.

1400
02:48:50,618 --> 02:48:52,540
[SPEAKER_27]: Not Jumper Revolution, Square Dance Revolution.

1401
02:48:52,780 --> 02:48:53,540
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1402
02:48:54,441 --> 02:48:56,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Grab your partner and buy the toast.

1403
02:48:56,322 --> 02:48:57,984
[SPEAKER_12]: We can rent a casino.

1404
02:48:58,324 --> 02:48:58,424
No.

1405
02:48:58,484 --> 02:48:59,485
Shut up.

1406
02:48:59,985 --> 02:49:05,410
[SPEAKER_27]: The redneck hit comes out.

1407
02:49:05,430 --> 02:49:07,691
[SPEAKER_27]: Where's something I can throw at Dan?

1408
02:49:08,152 --> 02:49:08,352
What?

1409
02:49:08,612 --> 02:49:09,493
[SPEAKER_27]: Throw it at Dan?

1410
02:49:09,573 --> 02:49:10,554
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't bring it up.

1411
02:49:11,154 --> 02:49:12,055
[SPEAKER_27]: I know, but I can't hit you.

1412
02:49:12,115 --> 02:49:13,256
[SPEAKER_27]: I can hit Dan.

1413
02:49:13,736 --> 02:49:16,138
[SPEAKER_27]: And Dan blocks the cat toy with Charmander.

1414
02:49:16,258 --> 02:49:17,419
[SPEAKER_21]: Charmander, I choose you.

1415
02:49:20,241 --> 02:49:22,202
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh oh, Charmander's tearing up.

1416
02:49:22,503 --> 02:49:23,523
[SPEAKER_27]: Cat toy revolution.

1417
02:49:23,843 --> 02:49:25,924
[SPEAKER_27]: We have Shermie Shermie Mania.

1418
02:49:27,025 --> 02:49:28,766
[SPEAKER_27]: Where you just sit around and pet Shermie.

1419
02:49:29,386 --> 02:49:31,328
[SPEAKER_27]: And she eats and flops on the floor.

1420
02:49:31,948 --> 02:49:33,129
[SPEAKER_27]: She's not stupid.

1421
02:49:33,369 --> 02:49:34,309
[SPEAKER_27]: My cat is not stupid.

1422
02:49:34,329 --> 02:49:34,970
[SPEAKER_29]: Cow milking.

1423
02:49:34,990 --> 02:49:36,270
[SPEAKER_29]: Cow milking.

1424
02:49:36,290 --> 02:49:36,451
[SPEAKER_27]: Wow.

1425
02:49:36,711 --> 02:49:37,531
[SPEAKER_27]: Cow milking.

1426
02:49:37,791 --> 02:49:40,753
[SPEAKER_29]: How perverted is that?

1427
02:49:45,738 --> 02:49:51,703
[SPEAKER_27]: And you have to milk it in a certain rhythm so you have the bars that come down that corresponds to a different udder.

1428
02:49:54,085 --> 02:49:55,406
[SPEAKER_27]: Here, I'll pull out this teat.

1429
02:49:55,907 --> 02:49:56,427
[SPEAKER_28]: Squirt.

1430
02:49:56,727 --> 02:50:04,194
[SPEAKER_28]: It'll end up being kind of like those stupid crab games that you have to hit the crabs before they make it across.

1431
02:50:04,274 --> 02:50:05,115
[SPEAKER_28]: Whack-a-mole.

1432
02:50:05,255 --> 02:50:06,316
[SPEAKER_28]: The whack-a-mole type of thing.

1433
02:50:07,117 --> 02:50:11,200
[SPEAKER_28]: You have to grab the other before it moves out of the way, so you gotta keep up with the other.

1434
02:50:11,320 --> 02:50:12,520
[SPEAKER_27]: That's one twitchy cow.

1435
02:50:12,560 --> 02:50:15,542
[SPEAKER_27]: Give that cow some Prozac.

1436
02:50:16,023 --> 02:50:18,464
[SPEAKER_27]: No, we're not having DDR upskirt revolution.

1437
02:50:18,484 --> 02:50:19,825
[SPEAKER_29]: You know?

1438
02:50:24,554 --> 02:50:35,437
[SPEAKER_27]: DDR Upskirt, this little weird site had a camera put in the middle of a DDR machine and had little schoolgirls dancing on it.

1439
02:50:35,818 --> 02:50:37,358
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's a picture of their underwear.

1440
02:50:37,538 --> 02:50:41,439
[SPEAKER_27]: Dan, you freaking pervert.

1441
02:50:41,499 --> 02:50:42,360
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll find it for you.

1442
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:46,281
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, we've had a request for DDR Upskirt cam.

1443
02:50:48,311 --> 02:50:53,254
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, someone find me a link to DDR Upskirt.

1444
02:50:53,334 --> 02:50:54,314
[SPEAKER_27]: No, not 3Ds.

1445
02:50:55,555 --> 02:50:57,376
[SPEAKER_27]: Upskirt.

1446
02:50:59,958 --> 02:51:01,218
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to do a search for this.

1447
02:51:02,639 --> 02:51:04,220
[SPEAKER_27]: DDR Upskirt.

1448
02:51:05,881 --> 02:51:07,662
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't believe I'm doing a search for this.

1449
02:51:08,362 --> 02:51:14,546
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, people look on the list of everything that I've been looking up.

1450
02:51:14,646 --> 02:51:16,307
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, we find Lolita Preteen Sax.

1451
02:51:16,327 --> 02:51:16,367
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh!

1452
02:51:19,185 --> 02:51:23,948
[SPEAKER_28]: Um... Maybe this is it?

1453
02:51:26,490 --> 02:51:27,270
[SPEAKER_27]: No, that's not it.

1454
02:51:31,773 --> 02:51:33,794
[SPEAKER_27]: GDR Manskirt Revolution!

1455
02:51:34,214 --> 02:51:35,475
[SPEAKER_27]: No, that would be Kilt Freaks.

1456
02:51:37,977 --> 02:51:38,737
[SPEAKER_27]: Kilt Mania!

1457
02:51:41,379 --> 02:51:42,099
[SPEAKER_29]: Bagpipes.

1458
02:51:42,759 --> 02:51:43,340
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

1459
02:51:43,360 --> 02:51:44,500
[SPEAKER_29]: That would be bad.

1460
02:51:46,405 --> 02:51:47,626
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not having Yu-Gi-Oh!

1461
02:51:47,666 --> 02:51:49,227
[SPEAKER_27]: Revolution, by the way, because Yu-Gi-Oh!

1462
02:51:49,467 --> 02:51:49,967
[SPEAKER_27]: sucks.

1463
02:51:50,387 --> 02:51:51,728
[SPEAKER_28]: No, we're not having Dildo Revolution.

1464
02:51:51,768 --> 02:51:53,189
[SPEAKER_28]: No, we need, Ross needs to see the upskirt cam.

1465
02:51:53,209 --> 02:51:55,670
[SPEAKER_28]: Jessica says he doesn't.

1466
02:51:55,750 --> 02:51:56,511
[SPEAKER_29]: It does exist.

1467
02:51:56,591 --> 02:51:58,492
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, I don't know, no, that one's down, thank God.

1468
02:52:15,586 --> 02:52:19,649
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, we found the live sex cam and free pick amateurs with DVD tits.

1469
02:52:21,651 --> 02:52:22,211
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

1470
02:52:23,372 --> 02:52:24,133
[SPEAKER_27]: Banana boobs!

1471
02:52:24,433 --> 02:52:25,674
[SPEAKER_27]: Banana boobs!

1472
02:52:25,995 --> 02:52:27,476
[SPEAKER_27]: Banana boobs!

1473
02:52:27,516 --> 02:52:32,860
[SPEAKER_27]: Banana boobs.com Ah, shit!

1474
02:52:33,341 --> 02:52:34,181
[SPEAKER_27]: I lost it.

1475
02:52:35,042 --> 02:52:37,124
[SPEAKER_27]: No, we're not going to the banana boobs.

1476
02:52:37,264 --> 02:52:38,765
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, banana boobs is so funny.

1477
02:52:43,172 --> 02:52:46,675
[SPEAKER_27]: BananaBoobs.com Didn't we say this show was adult?

1478
02:52:50,398 --> 02:52:58,504
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, they, uh... This is not M-rated.

1479
02:52:59,725 --> 02:53:05,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Those are the ugliest boobs in the world.

1480
02:53:06,871 --> 02:53:09,453
[SPEAKER_27]: Dan wants to use his adult check code password.

1481
02:53:10,931 --> 02:53:14,178
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, you know what, I think that's a bit much for the boobs.

1482
02:53:14,498 --> 02:53:17,444
[SPEAKER_27]: No, we're not going to the Goatsy site, thank you very much.

1483
02:53:17,464 --> 02:53:18,426
[SPEAKER_29]: Goatsy CX.

1484
02:53:19,107 --> 02:53:19,829
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what that is?

1485
02:53:20,029 --> 02:53:22,153
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the one of the ass.

1486
02:53:23,657 --> 02:53:51,583
[SPEAKER_28]: the stretched open ass so we as moderators on DDR Freak have seen quite a bit that we've seen that about 5 billion times before it's old get over it, learn something new on the internet, thank you there is the pay picture find me the DDR upskirt um he wants to see the mulletsgalore.com

1487
02:53:56,905 --> 02:53:59,127
[SPEAKER_27]: Dan said it would only be awesome if Solid Snake is there.

1488
02:53:59,607 --> 02:54:02,570
[SPEAKER_27]: Which, uh, you know, actually they did make a mention of that on Naked Tokyo.

1489
02:54:05,052 --> 02:54:06,112
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, guess what?

1490
02:54:06,533 --> 02:54:08,975
[SPEAKER_27]: It's about that time, so we're gonna go off and look for porn.

1491
02:54:10,056 --> 02:54:11,196
[SPEAKER_27]: So, uh, prawn.

1492
02:54:12,458 --> 02:54:14,039
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't need seafood, Dan.

1493
02:54:14,059 --> 02:54:15,240
[SPEAKER_27]: Dude, prawns are awesome.

1494
02:54:16,861 --> 02:54:18,562
[SPEAKER_27]: We do not need DDR lesbian porn.

1495
02:54:19,442 --> 02:54:24,145
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, that's it for this little lovely bit of train wreck.

1496
02:54:24,245 --> 02:54:26,265
[SPEAKER_27]: So, soiree.

1497
02:54:27,286 --> 02:54:28,947
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, this is a soiree.

1498
02:54:29,247 --> 02:54:32,608
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, we're going to go because we have other stuff to do.

1499
02:54:33,128 --> 02:54:35,769
[SPEAKER_27]: So, do you have any final thoughts?

1500
02:54:35,850 --> 02:54:37,350
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's start with the farthest away, Dan.

1501
02:54:40,472 --> 02:54:40,672
[SPEAKER_29]: No.

1502
02:54:42,913 --> 02:54:43,613
[SPEAKER_29]: I second that, no.

1503
02:54:44,525 --> 02:54:46,227
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go play Ross Ross Revolution.

1504
02:54:49,191 --> 02:54:51,775
[SPEAKER_27]: I said thoughts as if any of us are busy thinking.

1505
02:54:53,177 --> 02:54:58,964
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, my final thought is if you want to have an upskirt cam, be sneaky.

1506
02:54:59,164 --> 02:54:59,385
[SPEAKER_27]: Bye.

1507
02:55:01,764 --> 02:55:04,766
[SPEAKER_24]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1508
02:55:05,326 --> 02:55:08,668
[SPEAKER_24]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1509
02:55:09,248 --> 02:55:14,431
[SPEAKER_24]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

1510
02:55:14,731 --> 02:55:21,175
[SPEAKER_24]: If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

1511
02:55:21,775 --> 02:55:25,237
[SPEAKER_24]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1512
02:55:25,657 --> 02:55:30,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, the buffoons date at the drive-in with the school's valedictorian.

1513
02:55:32,276 --> 02:55:34,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate your asking me out.

1514
02:55:34,557 --> 02:55:37,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people are intimidated by my high academic achievement.

1515
02:55:38,720 --> 02:55:40,440
[SPEAKER_06]: This movie sucks shit!

1516
02:55:41,861 --> 02:55:45,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Eber gave it thumbs up, but Siskel thought it was too preachy.

1517
02:55:45,583 --> 02:55:47,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I enjoyed the director's last film immensely.

1518
02:55:49,725 --> 02:55:52,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathleen Turner has big fucking tits!

1519
02:55:53,748 --> 02:55:56,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, well, she recently had a child.

1520
02:55:56,209 --> 02:55:58,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I think her maternal biology may play a role in that.

1521
02:55:59,591 --> 02:56:01,612
[SPEAKER_02]: She looks fabulous for a woman her age, doesn't she?

1522
02:56:03,647 --> 02:56:07,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a firecracker in a bullfrog's mouth and blew his fucking head off.

1523
02:56:08,409 --> 02:56:14,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in psychology we learn that it's not uncommon for male adolescents to commit savage acts on animals as part of their maturing process.

1524
02:56:17,094 --> 02:56:21,756
[SPEAKER_06]: That girl in the fucking car in front of us, she gives everybody head.

1525
02:56:23,277 --> 02:56:27,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess she's starved for attention and she feels promiscuity is the only way to obtain it.

1526
02:56:30,114 --> 02:56:32,355
[SPEAKER_08]: These popcorn's fucking terrible!

1527
02:56:32,895 --> 02:56:35,055
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes like someone jizzed all over it!

1528
02:56:36,215 --> 02:56:38,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thought of semen on this popcorn is certainly disturbing.

1529
02:56:39,696 --> 02:56:45,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps the staff in the refreshment stand was overcome by the monotony of their work and decided to play a childish prank.

1530
02:56:46,578 --> 02:56:48,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked at my asshole in the mirror today!

1531
02:56:50,579 --> 02:56:52,419
[SPEAKER_08]: It blew my fucking mind!

1532
02:56:54,187 --> 02:56:59,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ironic that parts of one's own body can seem odd and unusual because you don't see them on a day-to-day basis.

1533
02:57:01,351 --> 02:57:05,112
[SPEAKER_02]: My father's shit stinks up the bathroom all fucking day.

1534
02:57:06,333 --> 02:57:10,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's puzzling why one person's fecal odor can be more overpowering than another's.

1535
02:57:11,195 --> 02:57:16,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder whether it is a function of the food digested or that person's internal metabolism.

1536
02:57:17,158 --> 02:57:20,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go get head from that fucking girl.

1537
02:57:21,573 --> 02:57:28,867
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm sorry to see the date come to such an abrupt conclusion, I do appreciate the time you've spent with me and look forward to a future rendezvous.

1538
02:57:29,828 --> 02:57:32,453
[SPEAKER_13]: I like to piss in that guy's fucking gas tank!

1539
02:57:32,594 --> 02:57:33,635
[SPEAKER_27]: Bye-bye, have fun.

1540
02:57:37,222 --> 02:57:52,531
[SPEAKER_27]: And another addition to this little fortune cookie message, if you go to understudationlive.org, you can see the news there that Understudation Live is going to be returning on January 11th, so grab the details there, and I now return you to the rest of the outro.

1541
02:57:54,172 --> 02:57:57,894
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
