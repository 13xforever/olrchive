[SPEAKER_19]: Attention!

00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:15,998
[SPEAKER_22]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:35,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:35,985 --> 00:00:36,646
[SPEAKER_04]: In this episode...

12
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:45,326
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

13
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:47,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Why did they have to take the word gay?

14
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:15,402
[SPEAKER_17]: We are live and this is episode number 24.

00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:00,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Burr, burr.

19
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:01,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Burr, burr is the word.

20
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:04,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm freezing.

21
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm freezing.

22
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all know her better as DarkSakura.

23
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:16,153
[SPEAKER_04]: In that corner, say hello to our tech massa, Loki!

00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:17,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everybody.

[SPEAKER_04]: And also in studio with us tonight, nobody!

26
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:24,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead air.

27
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,437
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the three of us.

28
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:32,259
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just feeling the love here tonight between the three of us.

29
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're telling me they can't hear us.

30
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have my mic around.

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, boy.

32
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:42,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, hi, our mics weren't loud enough during that whole intro, my bad, you wanna say hello again, Jamie?

[SPEAKER_18]: I said I was cold, dammit And Loki, you wanna say hello again?

[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure, whatever Sorry about that, we're still new at this, 24 episodes into this and we still don't know what the fuck we're doing Uh, anyway, we got a whole bunch of fun things to talk about tonight, but we'll get to that pretty soon Actually, I don't know what the hell we're gonna talk about tonight, I think it's just, uh, the holidays kill everything, don't they?

35
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:09,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, sure.

36
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's kind of panicking right now, by the way.

37
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:14,819
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the matter?

38
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, uh, my Tourney Mix 3 entry.

39
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,820
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all done.

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I just need to upload it.

41
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:27,282
[SPEAKER_06]: My dial-up doesn't want to upload it, and I have to upload it here, but we can't because the stream, you know, might get cut out, so I'm stuck.

42
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:28,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it on a CD.

43
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:28,663
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all done.

44
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:29,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I just can't get to it.

45
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:35,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, we'll panic about Loki's situation a little bit.

46
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:39,199
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we're going to take a quick break, and we will be right back.

47
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:39,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy.

48
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:24,964
[SPEAKER_08]: VitoZone Nothing can be forgiven I want to be free I don't care about the shape I don't care even if I break it I'm always strong and fierce My feelings are just one I don't believe in an end I'll search for the real tomorrow until the end Breakdown The music that sounds like a sound The tension that rises I'll stay by your side until the end

[SPEAKER_04]: It's some tracks from the new Good Cool compilation that was just recently released.

00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:28,063
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play a couple tracks here for you.

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio.

56
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,961
[SPEAKER_04]: We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

57
00:10:30,082 --> 00:10:33,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

58
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:34,563
[SPEAKER_04]: That was horrible.

59
00:10:35,143 --> 00:10:36,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you you'd hate it.

60
00:10:36,463 --> 00:10:37,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of funny.

61
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:38,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you ever heard that song?

62
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:39,784
[SPEAKER_04]: That Missy Elliott song?

63
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:40,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I listen to that?

64
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:42,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know you don't listen to pop music, but whatever.

65
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:45,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I have taste.

66
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

67
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:48,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

68
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:56,301
[SPEAKER_04]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio And that was some stuff from the Good Cool CD, by the way

69
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Spooky, and Shake It Down.

70
00:11:00,165 --> 00:11:01,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the two songs you heard back to back.

71
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:03,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, Blake Down.

72
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:07,107
[SPEAKER_04]: A song that I just pulled out of my ass because I didn't have anything else queued up.

73
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:11,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the chat room seemed to enjoy that promo, so they got the joke.

74
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:12,930
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

75
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,210
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

76
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you still over there panicking?

77
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:16,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

78
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:24,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Twin tried to get you a... Twin couldn't shut his big fat mouth and try to get you a waiver or something, but now they said, no, you gotta get it in by midnight.

79
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:26,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Eastern?

80
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:33,807
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy said Eastern, but if you notice, their webpage doesn't say anything, so I don't know.

81
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:34,848
[SPEAKER_04]: You could sue.

82
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:36,370
[SPEAKER_04]: You should take him to Judge Judy.

83
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give a crap.

84
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,257
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, because the only one that matters is MakeEditGetPorn, right?

85
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:44,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

86
00:11:46,397 --> 00:11:48,238
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, because we have a backup plan.

87
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:49,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So Loki's okay.

88
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,222
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just my roommate's got to get home in enough time for us to, you know, get into a system and upload something.

89
00:11:53,522 --> 00:11:53,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Break it.

90
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:55,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, good suggestion.

91
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:57,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of Judge Judy, Judge Jamie.

92
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:02,189
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a bookmark?

93
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, use that.

94
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:03,950
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, hey.

95
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:05,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So how was your week?

96
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,113
[SPEAKER_17]: I spent reading Harry Potter during the break.

97
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:12,297
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wearing this lovely new Slytherin scarf to go with your new obsession.

98
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,212
[SPEAKER_18]: New Obsession.

99
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:15,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, somewhat.

100
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:17,915
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out of this year though, isn't it?

101
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:27,503
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very happy because this, it's not like the official one because the official ones are made really cheaply and kind of look stupid because they have like the house logo on them.

102
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:28,424
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they look stupid.

103
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:32,067
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is a handmade scarf in green and gray.

104
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:37,452
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the Slytherin color so I wear it and it's made to look like the ones in the movies and it's warm and comfy.

105
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:41,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks in the chat room are indicating they've read all four books.

106
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one's your favorite out of all the four books?

107
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:44,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Goblet of Fire.

108
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:46,587
[SPEAKER_18]: Goblet of Fire was the best.

109
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:47,608
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, cool.

110
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:49,331
[SPEAKER_18]: Just because of the whole ending.

111
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:50,632
[SPEAKER_18]: My god, that was beautiful.

112
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:55,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so did anyone do anything?

113
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:59,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have a special, special guest tonight in the chatroom.

114
00:12:59,219 --> 00:12:59,980
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes me happy.

115
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,881
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes me moist as a snack cake, ladies and gentlemen.

116
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:06,884
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Morpheus, my old buddy from Under Tradition Live, Travis, in the chatroom tonight.

117
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:12,147
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's saying, oh, that reminds me, I need to send Jamie a pic of the Sakura Japanese restaurant sign out here.

118
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:12,667
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

119
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:15,469
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see signs with my name on them.

120
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:20,593
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's saying, by the way, he also said that Understation Live 3.0 is going to be debuting in January.

121
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:21,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Exciting!

122
00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:24,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned to UnderstationLive.org for all the details.

123
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:28,599
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoyed last week's match game segment, we totally ripped that off of Understation Live.

124
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,661
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a tribute, not a rip-off.

125
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:31,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, a tribute.

126
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:35,605
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was in turn a tribute to the classic game show, because it rules.

127
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:38,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually was just watching that the other day.

128
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:39,608
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite.

129
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:40,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Charles Nelson Reilly!

130
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:48,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Biggest flaming homosexual in the 70s.

131
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:57,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, my Mr. Spanky voice is inspired by Charles Nelson Reilly.

132
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:01,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes, Black Lab says, Game Show Network rules.

133
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Show Network does rule.

134
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the Game Show Network.

135
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Except Wintuition.

136
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:07,953
[SPEAKER_18]: What the fuck is Wintuition?

137
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:08,333
[SPEAKER_18]: That show sucks.

138
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:15,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Summers is cool!

139
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:17,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Summers is cool, but not on that show.

140
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:19,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know who produces that show?

141
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Who?

142
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:22,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a Mark Goodson television production?

143
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:25,417
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's Henry Winkler or whatever.

144
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:26,618
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fonz.

145
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:27,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, The Fonz?

146
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,380
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fonz.

147
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,261
[SPEAKER_04]: No way.

148
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,363
[SPEAKER_18]: Because The Fonz is cool.

149
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we actually have the Monty News to report.

150
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:35,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure.

151
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:38,006
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have some things going on in the Bomani community.

152
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:40,208
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a big tournament on Friday in the Bay.

153
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,312
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the Miggle Evil Tournament 2, I believe it was called.

154
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:44,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I right?

155
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:44,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Evil Tournament 2?

156
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:45,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to go.

157
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:49,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to go too, but that whole Friday thing meant, you know, we'd have to drive.

158
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:57,487
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't get anything out of work until 6.30, and I only, you know, didn't, I got off work at 5.30 and was there until nearly 6.30 because Dan wasn't off work yet.

159
00:14:57,587 --> 00:14:57,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

160
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:00,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't want to drive out there in the rain.

161
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:01,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

162
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:07,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably could have... Hearing that the whole damn thing started late, I probably could have made it in time, but I just didn't want to drive in the rain.

163
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:13,316
[SPEAKER_04]: My apologies to the folks there, but, you know, I just... I get all freaked out driving in storms.

164
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:14,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have cried.

165
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:21,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, oh yeah, we wanted to... We wanted to read the results to you from the tournament.

166
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in Perfect Attack, fourth place went to Emphasis.

167
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:28,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice job, Emphasis.

168
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Third place went to Virtu.

169
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't call him the Max 300 King, or he'll kick your ass.

170
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:36,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Second place went to Chubbs.

171
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:38,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.

172
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:39,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

173
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:42,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And first place, this is the hugest surprise of the century, Tigger.

174
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:44,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

175
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:44,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Gasp.

176
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:45,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god.

177
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Gasp.

178
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:49,656
[SPEAKER_04]: They did this whole new little bracket thing though that was kind of cool.

179
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:56,078
[SPEAKER_04]: What they do, and this is kind of cool, we should talk about this, kind of different ideas, ways to run a tournament.

180
00:15:56,558 --> 00:15:57,599
[SPEAKER_04]: They took a bracket of 16.

181
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:14,637
[SPEAKER_04]: and what they did, you know, just like normal except instead of the person losing the last match just automatically getting second place what they did is they removed Tigger out of the bracket and replayed all the matches that would have been affected by his presence, basically.

182
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:17,419
[SPEAKER_04]: and so they determined a second place that way.

183
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,144
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting the way it works, but it sounded very cool and I guess it worked out pretty well.

184
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:22,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds neat.

185
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:24,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that was pretty cool.

186
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:29,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Freestyle, third place, went to a fellow called Hamsterhead.

187
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:31,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Yummy.

188
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:33,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he do the hamster dance?

189
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:34,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what?

190
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:37,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, worst joke ever, sorry.

191
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:53,372
[SPEAKER_04]: 2nd place went to 001 I thought it was 007 00 something got 2nd place DCB here typed all these results to me I thought it was 007 It could have been 001, I don't know In 1st place

192
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:54,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.

193
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:55,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.

194
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:24,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, what else is there to talk about, but Monty News.

195
00:17:24,522 --> 00:17:28,583
[SPEAKER_04]: There are rumors saying that DDR Extreme is going to be released on Christmas.

196
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys think there's any truth to that?

197
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,883
[SPEAKER_18]: That sounds kind of early to me.

198
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:35,204
[SPEAKER_18]: Christmas is a commercial holiday in Japan.

199
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:43,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, that's not far off from here, but even so, I don't think that they would put a significance in that date for the release of the game.

200
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:49,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it sounds more like somebody's little fantasy than reality news, but who knows?

201
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,442
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming from a fairly reputable source, so we shall see.

202
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:58,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's an early release date.

203
00:17:58,506 --> 00:18:03,029
[SPEAKER_18]: I remembered hearing that the official release date was sometime in early January, so that's what I'm going to stick with.

204
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my story and I'm sticking to it, right?

205
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:10,915
[SPEAKER_18]: Until I see something in Naoki's journal or something, which doesn't exist anymore.

206
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:11,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, it's gone.

207
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:12,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

208
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,361
[SPEAKER_18]: Good!

209
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:15,241
[SPEAKER_18]: But we lost our favorite joke.

210
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we should start one.

211
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:18,702
[SPEAKER_04]: We should do a journal on behalf of Naoki.

212
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:20,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we should.

213
00:18:20,343 --> 00:18:21,943
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I've got an extra live journal code.

214
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:24,624
[SPEAKER_04]: The lost deep thoughts of Naoki.

215
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:26,284
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll do that.

216
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:27,085
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll set that up.

217
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:28,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's do it.

218
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:31,326
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make a Naoki live journal or something.

219
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:35,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Now don't go getting ideas and taking the name before we can get to it or we'll kick your ass.

220
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:36,087
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's ours.

221
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:37,027
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll set you on fire.

222
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:37,868
[SPEAKER_04]: We claim it.

223
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:38,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Dibs!

224
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,730
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not cold anymore, Emily.

225
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:44,591
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not cold anymore?

226
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:48,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because that's because we've got the lights in here that make everything hot.

227
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:51,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I went shopping this week.

228
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:52,919
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you buy?

229
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:53,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

230
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:56,122
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a present for Jamie, don't you?

231
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought Christmas gifts.

232
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:59,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have Jamie open her Christmas present live on air.

233
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,246
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be fun.

234
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:03,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's play some Christmas-y music to celebrate.

235
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,852
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't open it until I play music.

236
00:19:07,694 --> 00:19:12,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, now that I've got bills paid, I can go out and buy the rest of the presents that I need to.

237
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:18,001
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's kind of scary when you get down to $200 in your bank account and you've got bills due.

238
00:19:19,302 --> 00:19:19,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah!

239
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,244
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go, some nice Christmas music for you to be opening presents to.

240
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:27,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Goddamn, what'd you tape this with?

241
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:29,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Use packing tape.

242
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:34,945
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like me to you.

243
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:36,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god!

244
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:38,252
[SPEAKER_06]: You're quite astute, aren't you?

245
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:41,239
[SPEAKER_18]: I am going to be an Albrecht Van Heuven.

246
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:55,295
[SPEAKER_18]: I have Quigley Down Under, Die Hard, Galaxy Quest, Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, and Dogma Special Edition.

247
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:56,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a happy girl.

248
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:58,856
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm drooled for hours.

249
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:02,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to explain the Alan Rickman fetish to anybody that's new to our show?

250
00:20:03,877 --> 00:20:06,218
[SPEAKER_18]: He's hot, and I don't care how old he is, I love him.

251
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:10,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know he was in Quigley Down Under.

252
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:11,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't this movie really bad?

253
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:13,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

254
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:15,142
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got Tom Selleck in it.

255
00:20:16,143 --> 00:20:19,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but, like, ever since Magnum P.I., Tom Selleck, like, sucks.

256
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:21,025
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a few I miss, though.

257
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:21,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Blow Dry.

258
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:22,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't find that one.

259
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,987
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

260
00:20:25,027 --> 00:20:26,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Something tells me Jamie's going to be busy for a little while.

261
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, no, what I just picked up on Laserdisc was Sense and Sensibility.

262
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:35,733
[SPEAKER_04]: If that isn't a foofy chick flick, I don't know what is.

263
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:40,615
[SPEAKER_17]: I can go squee now.

264
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:41,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Squee!

265
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:44,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

266
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:49,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, feeling the love here on Orange Laundry Radio.

267
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:51,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting such great use out of my GameCube.

268
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:52,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that thing more than anything.

269
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:53,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I play Phantasy Star Online now.

270
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I went out and bought Phantasy Star Online and that game just takes so much ass.

271
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to get some DDR people going in on that.

272
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:06,533
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little thread over on DDR Freak if you check the other games for them.

273
00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:08,594
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole little thread on Phantasy Star Online.

274
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:12,055
[SPEAKER_04]: So you should check that out because they're trying to form a block and ship.

275
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:15,582
[SPEAKER_18]: I forgot, I love Christian Slater too

276
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Why are you tired?

277
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:49,027
[SPEAKER_18]: I was working on my website until 6 in the morning.

278
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:01,871
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

279
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:02,692
[SPEAKER_18]: I went to bed early.

280
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:21,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Good Buddy Jabberwocky, who we did a fuck-off show with before Rocky yesterday.

281
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:23,573
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was Friday night that we did the fuck-off show.

282
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:32,098
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a little fuck-off show, and then we decided to go to Rocky last night with another friend of ours, Neil Bugt, who gives the web space, by the way.

283
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:35,380
[SPEAKER_04]: He is my Sky.cx webmaster.

284
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,903
[SPEAKER_04]: We all decided to go to Rocky in the Bay Area, because we don't have it here in SAC anymore.

285
00:22:40,783 --> 00:22:41,363
[SPEAKER_04]: and we had fun.

286
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:45,645
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the second week in a row actually that I'd been because we all went the week before with Jabberwocky.

287
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:46,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

288
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:47,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

289
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:56,108
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't get out of there until damn near 3 in the morning and then we had to go looking for diesel because Neil's car runs off of diesel fuel.

290
00:22:56,528 --> 00:22:57,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he have a Mercedes?

291
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,870
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he has a Jetta, but it's one of those special ones that runs off of diesel fuel.

292
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:04,451
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to drive for like 45 minutes to find a place open 24 hours that had diesel.

293
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:08,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally found one and then we stopped at Denny's on the way back.

294
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:12,195
[SPEAKER_04]: and Jabberwocky got into an argument with a waitress over covered and smothered.

295
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it wasn't really an argument.

296
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:15,597
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more of a discussion.

297
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,180
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds fascinating.

298
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:20,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

299
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:21,582
[SPEAKER_04]: This is crappy radio.

300
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:22,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to bed.

301
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:23,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

302
00:23:23,644 --> 00:23:24,104
[SPEAKER_04]: You went to bed?

303
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:24,865
[SPEAKER_04]: What time did you go to bed?

304
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:37,764
[SPEAKER_18]: I stayed up looking for this one picture that I could not find.

305
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:44,026
[SPEAKER_18]: It was from, for anyone who's seen Chamber of Secrets, it was the scene with Snape dueling.

306
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:51,569
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wanted to find him dueling and I couldn't find it until like 4.30am I found it.

307
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,270
[SPEAKER_18]: I did a post at the time that I found it.

308
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,951
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I finally finished my new icon set.

309
00:23:57,011 --> 00:23:59,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was on your own personal live journal.

310
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:03,215
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, my own live journal, which if you want to know what it is, then go to the Orange Lounge community.

311
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:04,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, go to the Orange Lounge live journal.

312
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:07,878
[SPEAKER_18]: And look on the friends list there and you'll find me.

313
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:15,642
[SPEAKER_18]: I did a post on there about something that we're going to play on the show tonight for all the Animal Crossing addicts.

314
00:24:16,643 --> 00:24:18,164
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to give an Animal Crossing update?

315
00:24:18,184 --> 00:24:19,785
[SPEAKER_04]: What's new in the world of Animal Crossing?

316
00:24:20,705 --> 00:24:21,626
[SPEAKER_18]: I want Olivia back.

317
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:25,833
[SPEAKER_04]: We hung a sign out front of her house that calls her a bitch, because she is a bitch.

318
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:27,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, we have a visitor!

319
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:27,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Doorbell!

320
00:24:27,894 --> 00:24:28,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray, doorbell!

321
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:30,636
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another person.

322
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:31,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's gonna walk through the door?

323
00:24:31,997 --> 00:24:38,642
[SPEAKER_18]: I have, for anyone who plays Animal Crossing, I'm sure you all go talk to KK, or Tote KK, as his name is.

324
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:49,490
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can get a song from him, and he sings a little song and plays his little guitar, so I have one of his songs that, uh, I won't tell you what it is until right before we play it, unless you feel like playing it?

325
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:52,762
[SPEAKER_04]: We will go to break very soon and we'll play that.

326
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,885
[SPEAKER_04]: This break is going to be interesting because I'm actually going to leave.

327
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:58,268
[SPEAKER_18]: We're kicking Rob out.

328
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:00,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be gone for a little bit.

329
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,972
[SPEAKER_18]: We're making him get us caffeine.

330
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:02,833
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what we'll do though?

331
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:07,799
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let Dave live out a little fantasy of his and we'll let him sit in the chair.

332
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:10,486
[SPEAKER_18]: No!

333
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:11,447
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no.

334
00:25:11,547 --> 00:25:12,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Dave has to sit on the floor.

335
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:14,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so Dave can sit on the floor and Loki can sit in the chair then.

336
00:25:14,928 --> 00:25:16,468
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to sit in the big chair.

337
00:25:16,508 --> 00:25:18,049
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to sit in the chair?

338
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:18,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

339
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:19,630
[SPEAKER_18]: You can sit in the big chair.

340
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,890
[SPEAKER_18]: He gets to sit in this chair.

341
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Dave, what's up?

342
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:24,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw you, Rob.

343
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:24,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Dave.

344
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:26,292
[SPEAKER_04]: The big chair is mine.

345
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:27,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Dave.

346
00:25:27,512 --> 00:25:28,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

347
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:30,342
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's new, Dave?

348
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,984
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the only one that's actually gone out and played any Bimani this week.

349
00:25:33,024 --> 00:25:34,265
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to say?

350
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:35,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you did, Loki?

351
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturday sucked ass.

352
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:37,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

353
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:41,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Friday was cool because I went to Golf Land and everyone was there.

354
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:43,249
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, happy good time.

355
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but everyone that normally goes there is there.

356
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:50,053
[SPEAKER_18]: And then... What I said is I wasn't there, so it didn't count.

357
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:51,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

358
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:58,591
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then that was cool, and I said, well, Saturday is probably going to be the same because everyone goes that day too.

359
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:03,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went there, and Will and Cedric were there for a little bit, and then they left, and I was all alone.

360
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I played so much Initial D. All by yourself.

361
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I was dancing all alone.

362
00:26:12,182 --> 00:26:14,064
[SPEAKER_17]: Were you dancing all alone in a kimono?

363
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:16,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

364
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:18,594
[SPEAKER_05]: In the middle of Golfland.

365
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:20,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

366
00:26:21,316 --> 00:26:24,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did the nicest thing I've ever done in DDR.

367
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:27,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Some guy offered to pay, you know, to see me play.

368
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,379
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, oh, you're so good.

369
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

370
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,661
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how that happens sometimes.

371
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:31,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Was he hitting on you?

372
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:33,942
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he was like 50 with his family.

373
00:26:33,982 --> 00:26:35,063
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, oh, you have to see this guy.

374
00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:36,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean nothing.

375
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:37,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, no, I'll pay for it.

376
00:26:37,504 --> 00:26:37,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

377
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:40,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did that, and I was like, wow.

378
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:41,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so nice.

379
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:47,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, so like, you're nice because somebody gave you money to dance?

380
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:48,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance, monkey, dance!

381
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:50,408
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but see, I didn't accept the money.

382
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:52,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

383
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:55,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, damn, I'm so nice, and I'm so modest.

384
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,391
[SPEAKER_18]: The last time somebody offered me tokens like that, I took them.

385
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:02,631
[SPEAKER_04]: What in the hell is our chatroom doing right now?

386
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:04,191
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just typing dots.

387
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:05,112
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on drugs.

388
00:27:05,172 --> 00:27:07,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to kick the next person who types dots.

389
00:27:07,832 --> 00:27:08,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Twin.

390
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:09,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's Twin, yay.

391
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:10,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Kick him.

392
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:11,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Good seed.

393
00:27:14,822 --> 00:27:15,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's 23rd Magus.

394
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:19,386
[SPEAKER_17]: We're having a kickfest.

395
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,629
[SPEAKER_05]: See, it's funny because the lag... Yeah, I know.

396
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,630
[SPEAKER_04]: The lag didn't know.

397
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:28,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So they didn't even know about it.

398
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he did it again.

399
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:34,016
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's just... Oh, no.

400
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe Mama's playing cop for me.

401
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:36,358
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

402
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:51,476
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd want to join our chatroom and join in the fun of getting booted repeatedly when you do bad things, just go to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx.

403
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:52,837
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that simple.

404
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:55,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And then click on chat, and all of the rules you need are right there.

405
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:57,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

406
00:27:59,274 --> 00:28:03,297
[SPEAKER_04]: God, our chat room is just... They're all on PMS tonight or something.

407
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:04,238
[SPEAKER_15]: No, everyone's on Happy Crack.

408
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:07,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of Happy Crack, I need Twinkies.

409
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:09,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Happy Crack, I'm going to make a run right now.

410
00:28:09,882 --> 00:28:10,983
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to take a quick break.

411
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:14,546
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back, and when we come back, I'm not going to be here.

412
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:18,689
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll get your sim update, and who knows what's going to happen while I'm not here.

413
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:19,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

414
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm scared.

415
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:24,734
[SPEAKER_18]: During this break, though, we are going to give everyone a little taste of Animal Crossing.

416
00:28:24,814 --> 00:28:28,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we will have you enter that just one minute.

417
00:28:29,297 --> 00:28:31,479
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ KK, if ever you're interested in pulling it up

418
00:28:57,956 --> 00:29:00,497
[SPEAKER_18]: and go ahead and give a listen.

419
00:29:00,517 --> 00:29:03,299
[SPEAKER_18]: This is actually the one with him singing it, so enjoy.

420
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:08,741
[SPEAKER_04]: And also during this break, we'll play one more track from the Good Cool CD and some other random crap.

421
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:09,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy!

422
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:34,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Quack, quack, me, oh, me, me, oh, oh, me, oh Me, me, quack, quack, oh, oh, oh Quack, la, me, quack, oh

[SPEAKER_11]: A groove, groove, groove like this makes your body move, move, move!

430
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:43,084
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to feel the music, feel the way it flows, feel the vibrations from your head down to your toes!

431
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:05,304
[SPEAKER_00]: I am DJ Sender!

432
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:09,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, in the club in Shibuya, the most popular DJ is me!

433
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:10,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut up!

434
00:34:10,188 --> 00:34:10,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out of here!

435
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:13,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just a swimmer.

436
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,012
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the most groovy DJ right now.

437
00:34:16,213 --> 00:34:17,414
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Pani Kei!

[SPEAKER_09]: This is Trombone!

442
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:27,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

443
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:35,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on baby, won't you be my girl?

444
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:38,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on girl, let me rock your world Come on baby, won't you be my girl?

00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we're back and stuff.

00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the chair.

[SPEAKER_09]: Chair!

450
00:37:36,107 --> 00:37:36,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair!

451
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:36,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair!

452
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:37,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair!

453
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:37,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair!

454
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:38,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair!

455
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:39,729
[SPEAKER_18]: That's old.

456
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:40,670
[SPEAKER_18]: That's like AX2000.

457
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have nothing.

458
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:44,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

459
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:45,512
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn, you suck.

460
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:46,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

461
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:48,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that scarf.

462
00:37:48,553 --> 00:37:49,254
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so cool.

463
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:50,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, he's checking out my scarf.

464
00:37:50,695 --> 00:37:52,616
[SPEAKER_17]: I can get you a Ravenclaw one.

465
00:37:53,636 --> 00:37:54,476
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want.

466
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:56,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob didn't leave fast enough, so we had to kill him.

467
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:58,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I buried his body.

468
00:37:58,579 --> 00:37:59,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't really bury it yet.

469
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:01,980
[SPEAKER_18]: No, Rob's getting me chocolate, so I'm happy.

470
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,361
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we're getting boba later.

471
00:38:04,644 --> 00:38:06,289
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to Tapioca Express afterwards.

472
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:11,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Play the Max 2 that's been recently installed.

473
00:38:11,683 --> 00:38:12,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, that's local news.

474
00:38:12,944 --> 00:38:21,348
[SPEAKER_18]: The Max 2 supposedly has been upgraded over at Tapioca Express in Davis, so we're going to go check out that action.

475
00:38:21,628 --> 00:38:22,529
[SPEAKER_18]: How far away is that?

476
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:25,170
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like a 30 minute drive from here.

477
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,351
[SPEAKER_18]: Something like that.

478
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:27,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Not too far away.

479
00:38:27,731 --> 00:38:30,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, we need our update, our sim update thingy.

480
00:38:31,173 --> 00:38:34,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I get out of school and college...

481
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:35,475
[SPEAKER_05]: and like 8 years.

482
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:36,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually.

483
00:38:37,036 --> 00:38:39,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, call me in 8 years.

484
00:38:39,258 --> 00:38:40,639
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be 20 with the cane.

485
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:41,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be like 22.

486
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:42,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

487
00:38:46,602 --> 00:38:47,423
[SPEAKER_18]: Sim update time.

488
00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:47,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Whee!

489
00:38:48,403 --> 00:38:49,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

490
00:38:49,464 --> 00:38:53,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously the most important thing that's going on right now is Tourney Mix 3.

491
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:55,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Deadline is today.

492
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:57,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, deadline is in.

493
00:38:58,442 --> 00:39:01,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm like about an hour and 45.

494
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:01,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

495
00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:04,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid dial-up.

496
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:14,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so there's going to be, next week is going to be the official judging of it, and then you'll see on the 22nd, actual submissions come online for you to check out.

497
00:39:14,814 --> 00:39:17,236
[SPEAKER_06]: So look for that.

498
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:20,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Aside from that, not too much going on.

499
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:27,464
[SPEAKER_06]: They finished the Parapar graphics for Stepmania, so you'll see that in a new update probably soon.

500
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:29,505
[SPEAKER_06]: and DWI.

501
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:33,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't really been paying attention to what kind of updates are going on there, so no big deal.

502
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:43,253
[SPEAKER_06]: DDRUK finally finished updating all their booster packs, so you've got full sets of pretty much all the official files with the official graphics for the most part.

503
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:46,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So go check those out for sure.

504
00:39:47,815 --> 00:39:49,896
[SPEAKER_06]: And aside from that, not too much else.

505
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:56,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, more files on DDR Maniacs, so go check those out, some pretty cool ones.

506
00:39:56,557 --> 00:39:58,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm redoing my entire site.

507
00:39:58,698 --> 00:40:01,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not my entire site, but the download section of it.

508
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:06,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got, I'm sorting them all into, you know, 2DX style categories.

509
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,141
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm actually going to be doing a mass upload of a bunch of different files.

510
00:40:10,161 --> 00:40:12,441
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll see a bunch of those coming soon.

511
00:40:12,821 --> 00:40:14,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now I only have a few of them done.

512
00:40:15,682 --> 00:40:17,483
[SPEAKER_06]: and David is trying to pretend he's so sweet.

513
00:40:17,703 --> 00:40:18,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what?

514
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:18,784
[SPEAKER_06]: He sucks.

515
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:19,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

516
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:22,966
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't snore when you talk.

517
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,468
[SPEAKER_18]: So don't snore when Loki talks.

518
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Not out loud, at least.

519
00:40:26,669 --> 00:40:29,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you saying that you snore when I talk?

520
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:30,891
[SPEAKER_06]: When he talks.

521
00:40:31,131 --> 00:40:32,132
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it's because you're boring.

522
00:40:33,452 --> 00:40:34,453
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't get a scarf then.

523
00:40:35,692 --> 00:40:36,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I am boring.

524
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:44,336
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, you know, deadline for my make etiquette porn contest, if I remember correctly, is next Sunday.

525
00:40:45,437 --> 00:40:48,258
[SPEAKER_06]: So, get your edits in, if you haven't yet.

526
00:40:48,638 --> 00:40:52,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave has entered, and if no one else enters, he will sweep the whole competition.

527
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:55,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Has anyone else entered yet?

528
00:40:56,502 --> 00:40:56,682
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

529
00:40:57,903 --> 00:41:00,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I will win, and all the porn will be mine!

530
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:01,965
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, I'll enter.

531
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:02,705
[SPEAKER_18]: Why not?

532
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:04,886
[SPEAKER_18]: I want porn.

533
00:41:05,684 --> 00:41:08,005
[SPEAKER_18]: I want man porn, but I want porn.

534
00:41:09,146 --> 00:41:12,248
[SPEAKER_18]: If I get boob porn, then I can give it to people.

535
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:15,289
[SPEAKER_18]: Dave, you don't get any porn.

536
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:15,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Dave.

537
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,091
[SPEAKER_18]: No porn for you.

538
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:19,371
[SPEAKER_18]: No porn for you!

539
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:21,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not entering for the porn.

540
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:23,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm entering for the recognition of winning.

541
00:41:23,473 --> 00:41:25,094
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you can't have the chair back.

542
00:41:25,174 --> 00:41:26,355
[SPEAKER_05]: The porn is a bonus.

543
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:28,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy crap, that was fast.

544
00:41:30,082 --> 00:41:31,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's my cupcakes?

545
00:41:31,844 --> 00:41:40,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have been back before the break was even finished if that stupid bitch in front of me in line knew how to use her goddamn ATM card in the little slider.

546
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:42,973
[SPEAKER_04]: My preemptive FU of the week.

547
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:45,014
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you need to save it for the FUs of the week.

548
00:41:45,675 --> 00:41:47,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, I'll save it, but oh man, what a bitch.

549
00:41:47,877 --> 00:41:49,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should just do the FUs of the week.

550
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:50,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've got to wait for the chat room to submit theirs.

551
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:51,680
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to give them time to send theirs.

552
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,341
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to do the FUs of the week right now?

553
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:56,710
[SPEAKER_18]: We can do them in a minute, but Matt's still finishing.

554
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

555
00:41:57,851 --> 00:41:58,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Rob!

556
00:41:58,812 --> 00:42:02,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom, send me your FUs of the week over private message, or send them to Jamie's name right now.

557
00:42:04,276 --> 00:42:05,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, okay, yeah, change your nick back to Sky.

558
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:09,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Chatroom, send me your FUs of the week to Sky, and we'll get to those right after Loki finishes.

559
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:12,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, um... But I get the chair again.

560
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:14,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I guess I get the floor again.

561
00:42:16,107 --> 00:42:17,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, the floor is cool.

562
00:42:17,408 --> 00:42:18,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Word up for the floor.

563
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:19,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Go Floor!

564
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:20,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, no.

565
00:42:21,476 --> 00:42:22,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

566
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:25,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, so you'll probably see some more stuff on there.

567
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:30,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I know for a fact that I'm going to have Alien World, um, the DWI for that coming up on my site.

568
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:36,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I'm supposed to be getting some DWIs for, um, Starry Eye Surprise and, um, a few other songs.

569
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:38,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll be seeing those also hosted on my site.

570
00:42:38,882 --> 00:42:40,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So just check for that, and that's it.

571
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:44,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're ready to go.

572
00:42:44,984 --> 00:42:45,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa, food!

573
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I got food.

574
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:48,701
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, this is awesome.

575
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:54,164
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob came back with chocolate cupcakes for me, and now my scarf is being worn by Dave.

576
00:42:54,624 --> 00:42:56,946
[SPEAKER_18]: But you're not Slytherin, yo.

577
00:42:57,206 --> 00:42:58,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what I brought back for Dave?

578
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:00,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing!

579
00:43:00,348 --> 00:43:00,848
[SPEAKER_18]: Ha!

580
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:03,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

581
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:03,850
[SPEAKER_17]: Give me my scarf.

582
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need anything.

583
00:43:05,731 --> 00:43:08,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm content with sitting here on the floor.

584
00:43:08,432 --> 00:43:09,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Wearing my scarf.

585
00:43:09,513 --> 00:43:09,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

586
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:11,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it matches my sweatshirt.

587
00:43:12,254 --> 00:43:12,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

588
00:43:12,935 --> 00:43:15,196
[SPEAKER_18]: But you're one of those boring old Ravenclaws.

589
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:16,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Ravenclaw are tight.

590
00:43:16,952 --> 00:43:17,452
[SPEAKER_18]: No, they're not.

591
00:43:17,492 --> 00:43:18,012
[SPEAKER_18]: They're nerds.

592
00:43:18,192 --> 00:43:19,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Cho Chang, like what?

593
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:20,393
[SPEAKER_18]: They're nerds.

594
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:23,035
[SPEAKER_18]: And now in Harry Potter talk.

595
00:43:23,555 --> 00:43:25,316
[SPEAKER_05]: They better have a hot person play her.

596
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,097
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, Rob got fluffy balls.

597
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:29,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Ball, ball, ball.

598
00:43:30,498 --> 00:43:32,419
[SPEAKER_18]: And Propel, because Propel is the drink of the gods.

599
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I've only had it once, and that was when I had some of yours.

600
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:37,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want some Propel?

601
00:43:37,886 --> 00:43:38,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

602
00:43:38,506 --> 00:43:38,686
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

603
00:43:41,868 --> 00:43:43,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's being mean to me tonight.

604
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Have my other bottle of Propel.

605
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:45,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyway.

606
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:51,174
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that somebody in the chat room wanted to mention in your sim update, I believe this was sent to me by Twen.

607
00:43:52,115 --> 00:43:54,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Feet of Fury got an update to it, and this is really interesting.

608
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:59,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no update has been released, but there was some news on it.

609
00:43:59,379 --> 00:44:01,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me see if I can load up that news.

610
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:02,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to go to one of my websites here so I can get the...

611
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:05,382
[SPEAKER_04]: The quote on that, because this is going to be interesting.

612
00:44:05,402 --> 00:44:08,563
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that begs being talked about here before we get into the FUs of the week.

613
00:44:08,623 --> 00:44:10,264
[SPEAKER_18]: It's begging with a cup and everything.

614
00:44:10,724 --> 00:44:12,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's begging for your dollars.

615
00:44:12,944 --> 00:44:14,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally, it's begging for a dollar.

616
00:44:15,565 --> 00:44:21,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is what the latest update was posted over at CAgames.com, I believe is the site, correct?

617
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:22,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, CAgames.com.

618
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:25,007
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the folks that make Feet of Fury.

619
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:29,168
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a DDR emulator for the Dreamcast, and we talked about this a couple weeks ago on the big program.

620
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:33,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think our consensus was most of the people didn't particularly care for it.

621
00:44:33,731 --> 00:44:37,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought for a first mix it was okay, but it had a long way to go.

622
00:44:37,714 --> 00:44:39,075
[SPEAKER_04]: But most people here didn't care for it.

623
00:44:39,115 --> 00:44:42,078
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR's kind of surpassed that right now, but I don't know.

624
00:44:42,578 --> 00:44:47,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I think homegrown Dreamcast stuff is just cool to begin with.

625
00:44:47,462 --> 00:44:50,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like trying to play SSR on Happy Craft, because everything's flat.

626
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:52,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm being corrected.

627
00:44:52,485 --> 00:44:54,987
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an emulator, it's a simulator.

628
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Get over it.

629
00:44:56,348 --> 00:44:56,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

630
00:44:57,049 --> 00:44:57,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.

631
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,531
[SPEAKER_04]: It emulates the style of DDR.

632
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:27,669
[SPEAKER_04]: The bigger news is that the finished Feet of Fury game will be sold rather than posted online.

633
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:46,160
[SPEAKER_04]: They may do another preview version at that time with more bug fixes, better hardware support, better swap CD options.

634
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,983
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you get the real press CD, the sold one, you're going to be treated to a lot more songs, more gameplay modes, and etc.

635
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,384
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they're looking for a lawsuit.

636
00:45:57,885 --> 00:46:02,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's kind of... They're begging to get a lawsuit, I agree.

637
00:46:02,447 --> 00:46:04,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, unless it's radically different from DDR.

638
00:46:04,948 --> 00:46:06,448
[SPEAKER_04]: They might be in some trouble for doing that.

639
00:46:06,508 --> 00:46:10,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Then again, Pump It Up survived this whole time, who knows.

640
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:17,103
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also all the other clones out there that no one hears about that lurk around on eBay.

641
00:46:18,364 --> 00:46:20,807
[SPEAKER_18]: There's Technomotion, Easy To Dancer.

642
00:46:20,827 --> 00:46:22,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but they're not trying to sell Step Mania.

643
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I mean, this is really the same.

644
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, pump it up at least at different notes.

645
00:46:28,735 --> 00:46:30,337
[SPEAKER_05]: This is still up, down, left, right.

646
00:46:30,397 --> 00:46:31,198
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

647
00:46:32,403 --> 00:46:36,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, remember though, Feedy Fury, the first thing it was, it didn't even have normal DDR mode.

648
00:46:36,645 --> 00:46:40,227
[SPEAKER_04]: All it was was a Dance Magic-like mode, which had different things.

649
00:46:40,647 --> 00:46:54,114
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looked different, but, I mean, at its concept, if Konami wanted to proceed with, you know, trying to get something against them, it probably could do it, because it is very similar to Dance Magic, which was in Disney's mix that they released here in the U.S.

650
00:46:54,174 --> 00:46:54,434
[SPEAKER_04]: already.

651
00:46:55,335 --> 00:46:56,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's hear it for Disney's Rave.

652
00:46:57,676 --> 00:46:59,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, in the U.S., it's Mix.

653
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I happen to have Disney's Rave, so... I know, I know.

654
00:47:02,628 --> 00:47:04,029
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a Disney mix as well.

655
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:07,290
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually come to think of it, I got my Disneys right from you, didn't I?

656
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:08,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

657
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:13,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless of whether they're going to get busted or not, we will be looking forward to that release.

658
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:18,114
[SPEAKER_04]: We will, I'm sure, get a copy of A Feet of Fury and talk about it.

659
00:47:18,874 --> 00:47:19,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob will.

660
00:47:19,935 --> 00:47:20,575
[SPEAKER_04]: We will not.

661
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,816
[SPEAKER_18]: The rest of us are not going to get it.

662
00:47:23,056 --> 00:47:24,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I will stay on top of it and look at it.

663
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:28,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, because I don't use my Dreamcast for anything.

664
00:47:29,831 --> 00:47:32,112
[SPEAKER_18]: I use my Dreamcast to play Rainbow Cotton.

665
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:33,453
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I use my Dreamcast for?

666
00:47:34,633 --> 00:47:36,254
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I use it to play Nintendo games.

667
00:47:36,494 --> 00:47:38,675
[SPEAKER_04]: For Nester DC, that's all I use my Dreamcast for.

668
00:47:38,695 --> 00:47:39,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Soul Calibur.

669
00:47:39,436 --> 00:47:40,296
[SPEAKER_18]: I play Puyo Da.

670
00:47:41,216 --> 00:47:41,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Puyo Da's cool.

671
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,517
[SPEAKER_18]: Puyo Da's awesome.

672
00:47:45,338 --> 00:47:49,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I had some questions in the chatroom wanting me to ask Loki about this, if you've seen this.

673
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, all of us, really.

674
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,601
[SPEAKER_04]: The Flash Flash Revolution, have you seen that?

675
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:53,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

676
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:54,002
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

677
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:57,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like flash games, especially on dial-up.

678
00:47:58,937 --> 00:48:01,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Flash games all suck, and the same with the DDR.

679
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:03,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I played it, and I was like, eh, whatever.

680
00:48:04,221 --> 00:48:06,624
[SPEAKER_06]: It took forever to load, and it wasn't that impressive.

681
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:16,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I mean, I saw it, and it was basically, like, there's nothing special about it, it's just downloaded...

682
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:21,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Choppie, DDR, Emulator, Simulator, whatever it's called.

683
00:48:22,638 --> 00:48:29,205
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has less songs, less variety than something like Styliania, so I don't see why you would play that.

684
00:48:29,325 --> 00:48:32,068
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that like that Delight Delight reduplication, that old, old one?

685
00:48:32,088 --> 00:48:33,989
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it's just like you download...

686
00:48:35,671 --> 00:48:36,892
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

687
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,731
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like, I don't know, a couple years ago.

688
00:48:58,432 --> 00:49:01,854
[SPEAKER_06]: So go check that out if you really want to play this stupid Flash crap.

689
00:49:02,354 --> 00:49:04,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's nothing really special about it.

690
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:05,896
[SPEAKER_18]: You can play Dance Dance Karnov.

691
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:09,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really choppy, and I don't think it would sync too well.

692
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:11,579
[SPEAKER_05]: So, no.

693
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,201
[SPEAKER_18]: How many people remember Dance Dance Karnov?

694
00:49:15,301 --> 00:49:15,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it.

695
00:49:16,502 --> 00:49:19,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Karnov was an old Nintendo game that really sucked.

696
00:49:20,655 --> 00:49:24,140
[SPEAKER_18]: And so they did like a DDR flash simulator with Carnov.

697
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but do you know what's cool?

698
00:49:25,902 --> 00:49:30,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week, I saw DDR on the graphing calculator, which I'd never seen before.

699
00:49:31,049 --> 00:49:32,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's like really retarded.

700
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,175
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the funniest thing I've heard in my entire life.

701
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:36,235
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it was funny, though.

702
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:42,679
[SPEAKER_18]: At least with pole position, you could, like, play it and it had made sense, but DDR, no music, hello, what's it gonna do, click at you?

703
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:46,381
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR, no music, no flashing, just the arrow scrolled to the screen.

704
00:49:46,702 --> 00:49:48,723
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one BPM for all four songs.

705
00:49:49,283 --> 00:49:50,424
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the notes on basic.

706
00:49:50,484 --> 00:49:51,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you're incorrect.

707
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:57,548
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do sound with the calculator, but you have to build your own... I have a message.

708
00:49:57,568 --> 00:50:01,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a message for the person that created DDR for the graphing calculator.

709
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:01,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd!

710
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:02,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a life!

711
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:04,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a fucking life.

712
00:50:04,972 --> 00:50:05,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Go outdoors.

713
00:50:05,912 --> 00:50:07,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Smell a flower or something.

714
00:50:07,433 --> 00:50:08,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a girlfriend.

715
00:50:08,593 --> 00:50:09,293
[SPEAKER_04]: A boyfriend.

716
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:09,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

717
00:50:10,414 --> 00:50:11,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Go out and get laid.

718
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:14,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody got bored in calculus.

719
00:50:16,136 --> 00:50:16,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say Jesus.

720
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:18,657
[SPEAKER_18]: I want a pretzel.

721
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:21,078
Thank you.

722
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, yeah, secretly I'll admit, yeah, it's kind of cool.

723
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:23,559
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of funny.

724
00:50:25,475 --> 00:50:28,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that God didn't leave the window on when I left.

725
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:31,080
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I closed it.

726
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I closed it.

727
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,504
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to sit... Otherwise they're going, oh my god.

728
00:50:35,124 --> 00:50:36,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm not even going to say it just in case.

729
00:50:37,427 --> 00:50:42,532
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to sit in chemistry class and play pole position on a graphing calculator.

730
00:50:43,132 --> 00:50:43,693
[SPEAKER_18]: That was cool.

731
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:48,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to sit there and calculus and copy all the formulas that we were supposed to memorize for the test onto the calculator.

732
00:50:48,938 --> 00:50:49,959
[SPEAKER_18]: I had them memorized anyway.

733
00:50:51,368 --> 00:50:55,632
[SPEAKER_18]: To this day, I still remember that a mole is 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.

734
00:50:56,412 --> 00:50:58,194
[SPEAKER_04]: That is astonishing.

735
00:50:58,214 --> 00:50:58,194
6.022.

736
00:50:58,794 --> 00:50:59,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Astonishing.

737
00:50:59,575 --> 00:50:59,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

738
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:01,837
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been talking in the chat room.

739
00:51:01,857 --> 00:51:04,639
[SPEAKER_18]: It has come up lately, but when I was in school, we learned it was just 6.02.

740
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:09,784
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were talking about Flash, Last Revolution, somebody brought up Black Lab Invoke This.

741
00:51:09,824 --> 00:51:14,868
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, Flash ruined the Internet, which kind of goes back to what we were talking about a couple nights ago on the Fuck Off show.

742
00:51:15,329 --> 00:51:16,670
[SPEAKER_04]: What ruined the Internet?

743
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, actually, I was just...

744
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:22,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Pop-up ads ruin the internet, yes.

745
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:28,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I posted some links actually on our website about stupid knock-off DDR things.

746
00:51:29,056 --> 00:51:37,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone actually came up with a full-body DDR thing with motion-captured sensors on his body for DDR.

747
00:51:39,265 --> 00:51:39,766
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called...

748
00:51:41,618 --> 00:51:43,721
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making obscene shapes out of pretzels.

749
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:44,762
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got boobs and penises.

750
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:45,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Just ignore them, Loki.

751
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:45,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Continue.

752
00:51:46,364 --> 00:51:46,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Continue.

753
00:51:47,425 --> 00:51:48,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

754
00:51:48,286 --> 00:51:49,628
[SPEAKER_06]: It's... What?

755
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:52,411
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pretzel.

756
00:51:53,853 --> 00:51:54,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so...

757
00:51:55,899 --> 00:52:02,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's like almost if you cross DDR with, like, say... Actually, it was more like Samba de Amigo.

758
00:52:04,384 --> 00:52:05,265
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very much like that.

759
00:52:05,345 --> 00:52:07,606
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how you have to strike poses and stuff with that?

760
00:52:08,006 --> 00:52:08,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much like that.

761
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,348
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to match poses, that thing did.

762
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:14,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like a music game like that that someone is supposed to develop.

763
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:15,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I read there was another thing.

764
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:21,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I found that someone's developing a DDR sim for PS2 Linux.

765
00:52:23,055 --> 00:52:23,436
[SPEAKER_21]: Nerd!

766
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:23,576
[SPEAKER_21]: Nerd!

767
00:52:26,124 --> 00:52:26,404
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, Konami.

768
00:52:54,574 --> 00:53:00,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been given a flash that we have to play over the internet because it'll make us cool or something like that.

769
00:53:01,155 --> 00:53:09,577
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Spider-Man, and if this is that Spider-Man's gay thing, I'm going to start punching people randomly in the chat room because that thing's stupid.

770
00:53:09,817 --> 00:53:11,058
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, you're getting banned.

771
00:53:12,178 --> 00:53:19,680
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is that stupid Spider-Man is gay thing... We're waiting for this to load here.

772
00:53:22,385 --> 00:53:27,227
[SPEAKER_04]: 83, 86, 88, 94 Hey, shut up, I'm doing a show here.

773
00:53:30,768 --> 00:53:31,549
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?

774
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:33,309
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in a foreign language.

775
00:53:40,732 --> 00:53:41,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you.

776
00:53:42,873 --> 00:53:45,894
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the worst flash I've ever seen.

777
00:53:47,815 --> 00:53:49,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, wait, hold on, hold on.

778
00:53:49,256 --> 00:53:49,976
[SPEAKER_04]: That's getting a kick.

779
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,434
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what the best flash was, though, that was along those lines?

780
00:53:55,094 --> 00:53:58,937
[SPEAKER_18]: It was the Mega Man one where he danced to Twinby from 2DX.

781
00:54:00,478 --> 00:54:04,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I kicked EOSFVB for that worst flash ever.

782
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,041
[SPEAKER_05]: That was so funny.

783
00:54:08,643 --> 00:54:10,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Rob, I actually learned the whole dance now.

784
00:54:11,284 --> 00:54:15,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the whole dance, so you'll have to play that intro, or that promo when we come back.

785
00:54:15,287 --> 00:54:16,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, maybe we will, maybe we will.

786
00:54:16,868 --> 00:54:17,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, FUs.

787
00:54:17,949 --> 00:54:19,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, yes, let's do the FUs of the week.

788
00:54:21,063 --> 00:54:22,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, do I have FUs today?

789
00:54:22,664 --> 00:54:34,710
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to join our chatroom, by the way, just head over to our website, orangelounge.skie.cx And then, like, bomb rob with many PMs about what you'd like to fuck.

790
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:36,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, tell us what you'd like to fuck.

791
00:54:37,051 --> 00:54:38,472
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what a fuck it is.

792
00:54:39,492 --> 00:54:41,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going back to the old school schlagwerk this week, just because.

793
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:45,055
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll have a new song after that, by the way.

794
00:54:45,075 --> 00:54:45,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, cool.

795
00:54:46,356 --> 00:54:46,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

796
00:54:49,028 --> 00:54:51,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, my first FU of the week is Writer's Block.

797
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:56,774
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, actually, this sort of links back to my old one about my hard drive.

798
00:54:57,714 --> 00:54:59,196
[SPEAKER_18]: For people who don't know, my hard drive died.

799
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:00,376
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, completely died.

800
00:55:00,436 --> 00:55:00,977
[SPEAKER_18]: It broke.

801
00:55:02,404 --> 00:55:31,094
[SPEAKER_18]: and I lost chapter 5 actually I lost every fanfic I'd ever written but really importantly I lost the 5th chapter of the one I'm currently working on I was like 2500 words yeah 2500 words into it which for me that's you know a good bit that's actually a third of the fanfic of the chapter right there because the last few chapters I've written ended up topping over 6000 words a piece Marin's in the chat room right now and says you need to write more

802
00:55:31,872 --> 00:55:34,434
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I'm sorry, Maren John.

803
00:55:35,074 --> 00:55:35,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my bad, Maren.

804
00:55:36,555 --> 00:55:37,475
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

805
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:46,581
[SPEAKER_18]: Who, by the way, for anybody who remembers the DVR Freak moderator strip, she's my friend that I went to lunch with when we were there and hung out with.

806
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:49,702
[SPEAKER_18]: She got to see me incredibly drunk at Star Trek Experience.

807
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:49,983
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

808
00:55:51,543 --> 00:55:57,427
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I was really, really pissed off about it and didn't want to write anything for a week or so.

809
00:55:57,947 --> 00:55:59,148
[SPEAKER_18]: And I started writing on it again.

810
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:00,389
[SPEAKER_18]: And wouldn't you know it...

811
00:56:01,784 --> 00:56:02,464
[SPEAKER_18]: I get started on it.

812
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,145
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm on a roll.

813
00:56:03,725 --> 00:56:05,566
[SPEAKER_18]: Dan's like, hey, you want to go get food?

814
00:56:05,586 --> 00:56:06,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go get food.

815
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:10,809
[SPEAKER_18]: So I went out and had some lovely French toast, and then came back, and I couldn't write.

816
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:13,450
[SPEAKER_18]: I really couldn't think of anything.

817
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:14,490
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, well, what the hell?

818
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:17,752
[SPEAKER_18]: The thing is, I had it really dark before.

819
00:56:17,772 --> 00:56:19,993
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, really, like, disgustingly dark.

820
00:56:21,014 --> 00:56:27,197
[SPEAKER_18]: And I decided to take it a little bit lighter and do the really dark stuff on the last few chapters, and then I just blanked.

821
00:56:28,297 --> 00:56:29,698
[SPEAKER_18]: So, that's that.

822
00:56:31,656 --> 00:56:32,217
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it?

823
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:32,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

824
00:56:33,438 --> 00:56:38,422
[SPEAKER_18]: If you go to fanfiction.net, look up DarkSakura, my fanfics there, it's a Digimon fic.

825
00:56:39,183 --> 00:56:39,983
[SPEAKER_18]: Like all my other ones there.

826
00:56:40,003 --> 00:56:41,485
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you read it, leave me reviews.

827
00:56:42,105 --> 00:56:43,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Reviews are special and they make me happy.

828
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:47,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, fuck people who don't leave me reviews, because you suck.

829
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:49,292
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, okay.

830
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:53,355
[SPEAKER_18]: My other question of the week is, um... Okay.

831
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:53,756
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

832
00:56:55,089 --> 00:56:58,110
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't really blame him for this, but, you know, fuck losing my cable.

833
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:01,690
[SPEAKER_18]: Because even though I don't watch TV, I occasionally like the option of watching it.

834
00:57:02,391 --> 00:57:03,251
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can see Buffy.

835
00:57:03,391 --> 00:57:03,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Iron Chef.

836
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:08,532
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we didn't even... I didn't even like watching that.

837
00:57:08,772 --> 00:57:11,833
[SPEAKER_18]: But, um... Well, I liked watching it when I'm with other people, but not by myself.

838
00:57:12,313 --> 00:57:13,933
[SPEAKER_18]: Because all it does is make me want to start cooking.

839
00:57:15,554 --> 00:57:21,975
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um... But what got me is that I wake up and, like... I canceled the cable!

840
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:23,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

841
00:57:23,891 --> 00:57:24,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you don't watch it.

842
00:57:25,072 --> 00:57:25,993
[SPEAKER_18]: How am I going to watch Buffy?

843
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:27,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I get crappy reception without the cable.

844
00:57:28,495 --> 00:57:30,997
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess I get to download episodes of Buffy.

845
00:57:31,037 --> 00:57:35,280
[SPEAKER_18]: So if anyone watches Buffy, take the episodes for me because I need to see James Foster's apps.

846
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

847
00:57:37,842 --> 00:57:40,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, by the way, I'm going to go see him next month.

848
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:42,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to BuffyCon?

849
00:57:42,686 --> 00:57:43,967
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a BuffyCon.

850
00:57:44,047 --> 00:57:46,790
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like a sci-fi con, but I'm going to go see my man.

851
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:49,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Buffy ruined the internet.

852
00:57:49,472 --> 00:57:49,932
[SPEAKER_18]: No!

853
00:57:50,373 --> 00:57:51,714
[SPEAKER_18]: No, pop-ups ruin the internet.

854
00:57:52,571 --> 00:57:54,513
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a list list on what ruined the internet.

855
00:57:54,533 --> 00:57:56,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe that should be our topic for tonight.

856
00:57:56,835 --> 00:57:57,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

857
00:57:57,175 --> 00:57:57,615
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to do that?

858
00:57:57,855 --> 00:57:59,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to do a list list tonight, and that'll be the topic.

859
00:58:00,758 --> 00:58:01,859
[SPEAKER_04]: What ruined the internet?

860
00:58:02,059 --> 00:58:02,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

861
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:03,820
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

862
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:07,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but, uh... These things are salty.

863
00:58:07,824 --> 00:58:10,206
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck these pretzels, but I'll leave it to you.

864
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:12,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's it.

865
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:14,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, stop eating your balls.

866
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:17,692
[SPEAKER_21]: I like my balls, they're big and fluffy.

867
00:58:19,813 --> 00:58:21,294
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to go to the next step, you.

868
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:23,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, let's hear from you.

869
00:58:25,698 --> 00:58:27,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no saliva because these pretzels.

870
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Neat Zalavex.

871
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:31,362
[SPEAKER_06]: No French kissing for you!

872
00:58:33,404 --> 00:58:34,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, ugh.

873
00:58:36,072 --> 00:58:39,636
[SPEAKER_06]: First FU, especially with this weather, has to be stupid drivers.

874
00:58:40,537 --> 00:58:41,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate stupid drivers.

875
00:58:41,658 --> 00:58:43,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate stupid drivers that try to pull out in front of me.

876
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:46,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate stupid drivers that drive 40 miles under the speed limit.

877
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:48,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate them.

878
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:49,845
[SPEAKER_06]: They're stupid.

879
00:58:50,466 --> 00:58:55,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially this old bitch that was behind yesterday, going down South Watt.

880
00:58:56,111 --> 00:58:58,213
[SPEAKER_06]: She's going 25 miles an hour, there's 20 cars behind her.

881
00:58:59,611 --> 00:59:06,277
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, fuck you, so I went around her and everyone honked at her and flipped her off and tried to beat her off the road, but that didn't work.

882
00:59:08,399 --> 00:59:11,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'd up you to dial up email.

883
00:59:12,884 --> 00:59:19,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking A, I have my Turning Mystery thing done and I can't submit it because it's like, no, I want a timeout.

884
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:20,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

885
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:26,273
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I can't... One way or another, my secret file is coming online tonight.

886
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:30,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether it be in the official judging for Tournament Mix 3 or on my website.

887
00:59:31,074 --> 00:59:32,255
[SPEAKER_06]: One way or another, it's up there.

888
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah.

889
00:59:36,116 --> 00:59:36,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

890
00:59:36,536 --> 00:59:41,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have too much to go with right now because I'm happy with pretzels.

891
00:59:42,338 --> 00:59:45,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'll think of something later, I'm sure.

892
00:59:45,379 --> 00:59:45,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

893
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:46,960
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, my turn.

894
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:48,571
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

895
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:51,272
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, F you to the rain.

896
00:59:51,712 --> 00:59:54,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's needed and all, but fuck, I hate driving in it.

897
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:55,113
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the worst.

898
00:59:55,193 --> 00:59:56,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes everybody drive like an ass.

899
00:59:57,573 --> 00:59:59,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have this intense fear of hydroplaning.

900
00:59:59,994 --> 01:00:02,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I kick up a puddle, I think I'm going to die.

901
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:02,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it.

902
01:00:02,855 --> 01:00:03,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a hydroplane.

903
01:00:03,895 --> 01:00:04,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never done it before.

904
01:00:04,855 --> 01:00:05,375
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it sucks.

905
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:05,936
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awful.

906
01:00:05,956 --> 01:00:06,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to hell.

907
01:00:06,316 --> 01:00:09,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a hydroplane, but when no one else is around, so I can do a 720 and keep going.

908
01:00:11,897 --> 01:00:14,299
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a scary man and I hope they never give you a license.

909
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:20,723
[SPEAKER_04]: My other FU of the week goes to that stupid bitch at Walgreens who didn't know how to use her ATM card thing.

910
01:00:21,063 --> 01:00:21,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a hint.

911
01:00:22,964 --> 01:00:28,067
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know how to use your ATM card to pay for your food, you need to fucking just go get cash.

912
01:00:29,235 --> 01:00:29,956
[SPEAKER_04]: and do it that way.

913
01:00:30,056 --> 01:00:33,278
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I hate people that hold up the line because they're retarded.

914
01:00:34,779 --> 01:00:35,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a life, you stupid bitch.

915
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:36,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

916
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:36,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

917
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it.

918
01:00:38,081 --> 01:00:38,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.

919
01:00:38,581 --> 01:00:39,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I have any other Refuge League.

920
01:00:39,742 --> 01:00:40,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I had other Refuge League.

921
01:00:41,203 --> 01:00:42,964
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Christmas Carols.

922
01:00:43,084 --> 01:00:43,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't get away from them.

923
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:45,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

924
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:47,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's my turn.

925
01:00:47,547 --> 01:00:47,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

926
01:00:48,848 --> 01:00:50,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, first of all...

927
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, you are so cool.

928
01:00:53,801 --> 01:00:54,881
[SPEAKER_05]: You're playing this song.

929
01:00:55,382 --> 01:00:56,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up and give us your FUs.

930
01:00:56,482 --> 01:00:57,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

931
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:04,647
[SPEAKER_05]: My first FU goes to all the people who give me sympathy because my birthday is the day after Christmas.

932
01:01:04,968 --> 01:01:07,609
[SPEAKER_05]: And they say, oh, that sucks because you get all your presents at the same time.

933
01:01:07,649 --> 01:01:08,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

934
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,150
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't.

935
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:09,791
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a Jew.

936
01:01:09,951 --> 01:01:13,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but they're all like, oh, that sucks so bad because you get all your presents at the same time.

937
01:01:13,233 --> 01:01:14,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, no, I'm Jewish.

938
01:01:14,313 --> 01:01:15,214
[SPEAKER_04]: This year's weird.

939
01:01:15,274 --> 01:01:17,155
[SPEAKER_04]: They put Hanukkah at a weird time this year.

940
01:01:17,195 --> 01:01:18,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was so early.

941
01:01:19,229 --> 01:01:20,430
[SPEAKER_04]: HANUKA'S LONG OVER

942
01:01:34,978 --> 01:01:39,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly... Oh, Christmas is just that day you don't have to go to school or you get off work randomly.

943
01:01:39,481 --> 01:01:41,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas is fun because it's the day before my birthday.

944
01:01:43,022 --> 01:01:48,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I get to go skiing because everyone else is going fucking eating, you know, turkey and shit.

945
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:49,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

946
01:01:49,766 --> 01:01:53,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, my second nephew goes to my stupid, fat, fucking bitch Spanish teacher.

947
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:54,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

948
01:01:55,329 --> 01:01:58,091
[SPEAKER_05]: She must weigh, like, 500 pounds.

949
01:01:58,591 --> 01:02:04,074
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've ever seen the movie Hercules, the animated one, like, she looks like the titan

950
01:02:04,834 --> 01:02:07,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's the, like, the Earth Titan or whatever?

951
01:02:07,415 --> 01:02:10,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's just a giant blob of mush, except the female version.

952
01:02:10,757 --> 01:02:12,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Her ankle is bigger than my neck.

953
01:02:13,218 --> 01:02:13,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I kid you not.

954
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:20,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's so fat, and she speaks in an Italian accent for Spanish, so you can't understand a fucking word.

955
01:02:21,142 --> 01:02:23,803
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, okay, kiddos, remember the test today?

956
01:02:23,883 --> 01:02:24,463
[SPEAKER_05]: What test?

957
01:02:24,603 --> 01:02:24,824
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

958
01:02:24,944 --> 01:02:25,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, project?

959
01:02:25,844 --> 01:02:26,084
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

960
01:02:26,204 --> 01:02:27,025
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we all fail.

961
01:02:27,505 --> 01:02:32,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a D right now, and that's keeping me from doing shit that I want to do in my mom moment.

962
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:34,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm done.

963
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:39,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's hear from the chatroom then.

964
01:02:41,687 --> 01:02:43,048
[SPEAKER_04]: First I'm going to open up the email bag.

965
01:02:43,108 --> 01:02:48,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to open up the email bag because we have some FUs that came over email.

966
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,251
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some late FUs from last week.

967
01:02:51,351 --> 01:03:01,355
[SPEAKER_04]: These come from Muheimer who sent these in last week for last week's show except he must not have been in on Saturday when we were actually taping the show.

968
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,056
[SPEAKER_04]: So he sent these in on Sunday and we weren't here.

969
01:03:03,396 --> 01:03:04,677
[SPEAKER_04]: We were running a tape.

970
01:03:05,957 --> 01:03:10,338
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, as much as he enjoys hearing things that piss Jamie off the whole show, he needs to contribute his own stuff.

971
01:03:10,358 --> 01:03:16,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So fuck non-individualistic people who are too worried what other people will think of them.

972
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, fuck them.

973
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck my so-called friends for not going to the movies with me because it was a whole ten minutes out of the way.

974
01:03:21,942 --> 01:03:23,282
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a DDR machine there, yay.

975
01:03:24,182 --> 01:03:27,703
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to go with only two people instead of who I wanted to go with.

976
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:34,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that DDR machine at the movies because it didn't have a good screen quality and it made me look suckier than I really am, which is pretty sucky anyway.

977
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:38,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Pierce Brosnan for getting to make Sweet Love Into Halle Berry instead of me.

978
01:03:40,565 --> 01:03:45,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget that Billy Bob Thornton also got to make Sweet Love Into Halle Berry in that movie, and she was all topless and stuff, too.

979
01:03:46,008 --> 01:03:46,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster's Ball.

980
01:03:47,148 --> 01:03:49,349
[SPEAKER_04]: That movie's fucked up, though.

981
01:03:49,669 --> 01:03:53,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen a movie that made me want to kill myself, but Monster's Ball just makes you want to die.

982
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:55,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't rent it, it's awful.

983
01:03:58,604 --> 01:04:05,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't rent the whole movie.

984
01:04:07,628 --> 01:04:08,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Did she show her titties?

985
01:04:08,649 --> 01:04:11,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Did she show her titties to Die Another Day or something?

986
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:13,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think so.

987
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:14,191
[SPEAKER_05]: In Monster's Ball.

988
01:04:14,211 --> 01:04:14,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I knew that.

989
01:04:15,872 --> 01:04:19,534
[SPEAKER_18]: I just found a picture of my man and I'm staring at him and ignoring the naked Halle's ball.

990
01:04:20,214 --> 01:04:20,494
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

991
01:04:20,554 --> 01:04:21,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Women are pigs.

992
01:04:21,675 --> 01:04:22,595
[SPEAKER_18]: Women are pigs.

993
01:04:22,655 --> 01:04:24,636
[SPEAKER_09]: All you do is sit there and oogle Alan Rickman.

994
01:04:24,696 --> 01:04:25,677
[SPEAKER_18]: Play my fucking music.

995
01:04:27,287 --> 01:04:30,611
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you to Halle Berry for ruining the character of Storm in X-Men.

996
01:04:30,671 --> 01:04:31,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

997
01:04:32,593 --> 01:04:34,696
[SPEAKER_18]: She fucked up the accent and fucked up the whole movie.

998
01:04:34,716 --> 01:04:36,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you saying Halle Berry ruined the internet?

999
01:04:36,878 --> 01:04:38,440
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm saying she ruined X-Men.

1000
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,243
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, the trailer is out for X2.

1001
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:45,108
[SPEAKER_18]: It's looking to be good, but the bitch is still in it.

1002
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:47,010
[SPEAKER_18]: So fuck her for existing.

1003
01:04:47,944 --> 01:04:50,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there snowboarders or extreme sports in that movie?

1004
01:04:51,466 --> 01:04:54,448
[SPEAKER_06]: A third one, they can just call it Triple X. Whoa.

1005
01:04:56,149 --> 01:04:59,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very disappointed that that movie has no porn in it whatsoever.

1006
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,291
[SPEAKER_06]: What a misleading title.

1007
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:04,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Triple X, you'd expect booby shot, something like that, but no.

1008
01:05:07,853 --> 01:05:15,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's Matt Hoffman or... But whatever that one was, that one was better than Triple X. I mean, fuck Propel.

1009
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Propel just spit up in my face.

1010
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:22,482
[SPEAKER_18]: It's called BMXXX, and I got a copy for free on Xbox.

1011
01:05:23,743 --> 01:05:24,483
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Dan did.

1012
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:29,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, thanks.

1013
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:31,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to tell you what ruined X-Men.

1014
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to tell you right here what ruined X-Men.

1015
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:37,002
[SPEAKER_04]: On that note, here, this is what ruined X-Men.

1016
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:40,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what happens when lightning hits a toad?

1017
01:05:41,683 --> 01:05:43,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing that happens to everything else.

1018
01:05:44,364 --> 01:05:45,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, he sucks.

1019
01:05:45,565 --> 01:05:47,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Who let that get in the script?

1020
01:05:47,926 --> 01:05:50,627
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the stupidest thing I've heard in my entire life.

1021
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:52,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Delivered by the stupidest person.

1022
01:05:52,408 --> 01:05:52,948
[SPEAKER_18]: God!

1023
01:05:53,468 --> 01:05:57,350
[SPEAKER_05]: It was for all the eight-year-old little kids who watch the little TV show.

1024
01:05:57,751 --> 01:06:01,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they can go and, like, go repeat that line over and over again.

1025
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:02,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, fuck kids!

1026
01:06:02,633 --> 01:06:05,595
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd be like, no, what happens when lightning hits the toe?

1027
01:06:05,815 --> 01:06:07,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, um, I don't know.

1028
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:08,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounded cool, though.

1029
01:06:10,658 --> 01:06:11,758
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it was dumb.

1030
01:06:11,778 --> 01:06:12,539
[SPEAKER_18]: That's kind of neat.

1031
01:06:12,759 --> 01:06:13,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1032
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:14,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, we still have fuck yous.

1033
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1034
01:06:15,801 --> 01:06:18,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have Mooheimers this week's fuck yous.

1035
01:06:19,562 --> 01:06:22,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck my swim coaches for being lazy and dumb and whatnot.

1036
01:06:22,606 --> 01:06:26,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck lame projects and fuck the crazy DDR machine that poor Loki couldn't hack.

1037
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:27,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor Loki.

1038
01:06:27,573 --> 01:06:30,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And he spells Loki L-O-K-I-E, which I think is really cute.

1039
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:36,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I demand that we start calling you Loki.

1040
01:06:36,786 --> 01:06:38,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some more stuff out of there.

1041
01:06:38,927 --> 01:06:45,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I got all the samples, including the... What's kind of funny is they actually have all the sound samples from all the mixes on the machine.

1042
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:46,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

1043
01:06:47,272 --> 01:06:47,832
[SPEAKER_06]: From all the mixes.

1044
01:06:48,072 --> 01:06:50,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the DDR second mix battle samples.

1045
01:06:51,054 --> 01:06:51,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I want those.

1046
01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:52,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got all those.

1047
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:53,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1048
01:06:53,335 --> 01:06:54,976
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's like the old announcer and everything?

1049
01:06:55,524 --> 01:06:57,845
[SPEAKER_06]: All the old announcers from first all the way up to max two.

1050
01:06:57,865 --> 01:06:58,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Even Tin Can Lady?

1051
01:06:59,085 --> 01:07:03,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no, no solo stuff, because I say solo is its own breed, but it's, um... Dude, I want those.

1052
01:07:04,426 --> 01:07:05,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got all the samples for that.

1053
01:07:05,506 --> 01:07:05,706
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1054
01:07:05,846 --> 01:07:07,527
[SPEAKER_18]: My AOL theme is going to be all DDR.

1055
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:10,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I still have AOL.

1056
01:07:10,728 --> 01:07:11,828
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck AOL, by the way.

1057
01:07:12,968 --> 01:07:14,348
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, fuck this one, AOL.

1058
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:15,089
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's my music?

1059
01:07:17,532 --> 01:07:25,379
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, fuck AOL, because, alright, I'm using 8.0, and I have this neat little Slytherin background, and the logo, the actual Slytherin logo is gone.

1060
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:26,440
[SPEAKER_18]: My background's just grey.

1061
01:07:27,161 --> 01:07:27,801
[SPEAKER_18]: So fuck AOL.

1062
01:07:29,342 --> 01:07:30,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I finish with the chatroom now?

1063
01:07:30,584 --> 01:07:30,804
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1064
01:07:31,304 --> 01:07:31,604
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1065
01:07:34,387 --> 01:07:35,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Wackwab!

1066
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:39,050
[SPEAKER_04]: says, oh my god, he's got a lot here.

1067
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,631
[SPEAKER_04]: FU, fuck finals, I hate finals.

1068
01:07:42,731 --> 01:07:47,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the rain for starting on Friday instead of Saturday because I had to ride my bike in the rain to both my finals on Friday.

1069
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:52,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the owner of Tap Express for not unlocking the Max 2 machine after it was installed.

1070
01:07:52,295 --> 01:07:53,235
[SPEAKER_04]: God knows why he didn't do it.

1071
01:07:53,756 --> 01:07:55,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the 49ers for not winning today.

1072
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:56,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck allergies.

1073
01:07:56,497 --> 01:07:57,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Just fuck them.

1074
01:07:57,317 --> 01:08:00,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed all my classes this week before finals because I was sick.

1075
01:08:00,678 --> 01:08:01,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And fuck Hugh Grant.

1076
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:05,520
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs to die so I can move up one rung on my girlfriend's ladder of love.

1077
01:08:08,103 --> 01:08:10,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, why aren't you number one on your girlfriend's ladder of love?

1078
01:08:10,985 --> 01:08:13,126
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fucked up right there.

1079
01:08:13,767 --> 01:08:14,467
[SPEAKER_15]: He's hot.

1080
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:17,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is there a ladder that you need to move up rungs on?

1081
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:20,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you're not one... You need a promotion?

1082
01:08:21,191 --> 01:08:24,453
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not one, then you should at least be number two or three, I'm thinking.

1083
01:08:25,114 --> 01:08:27,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you sound like you're number 18 or 19 right now.

1084
01:08:30,999 --> 01:08:31,299
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1085
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:38,328
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get our butt kicked by Black Lab in about five seconds as soon as the buffer gets to them.

1086
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:39,068
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

1087
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,812
[SPEAKER_18]: I have another actress I'd like to say fuck you to.

1088
01:08:42,593 --> 01:08:42,993
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

1089
01:08:43,634 --> 01:08:44,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Linda Fiorentino.

1090
01:08:48,228 --> 01:08:50,130
[SPEAKER_04]: That part was written for Alanis.

1091
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:51,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alanis declined it.

1092
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:54,352
[SPEAKER_04]: But then came back and said, no, I guess I'll be in the movie.

1093
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:57,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kevin Smith said, oh, well, I have a better part for you anyway.

1094
01:08:57,855 --> 01:08:58,675
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why she's gone.

1095
01:08:58,695 --> 01:09:01,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you think Garofalo should have had it?

1096
01:09:01,197 --> 01:09:02,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Who, God?

1097
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:02,658
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1098
01:09:02,678 --> 01:09:03,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would have been cool.

1099
01:09:03,478 --> 01:09:04,479
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Garofalo should have had it.

1100
01:09:04,499 --> 01:09:05,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that would have been cool.

1101
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,421
[SPEAKER_18]: And they actually went back and said they should have given it to her.

1102
01:09:09,703 --> 01:09:10,883
[SPEAKER_18]: But no, Linda Fiorentino.

1103
01:09:10,903 --> 01:09:12,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep going with Chet Room.

1104
01:09:12,604 --> 01:09:12,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, yes.

1105
01:09:12,905 --> 01:09:13,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Chet Room.

1106
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:14,686
[SPEAKER_18]: They can use my music if they want to.

1107
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:16,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to Twin.

1108
01:09:17,965 --> 01:09:19,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck us for dissing Feet of Fury.

1109
01:09:20,566 --> 01:09:21,626
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants to fuck the ferret.

1110
01:09:21,646 --> 01:09:22,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Feet of Fury sucks.

1111
01:09:23,266 --> 01:09:24,467
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants to fuck a tree.

1112
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,087
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants to fuck anything here.

1113
01:09:26,707 --> 01:09:28,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck not owning an ignition pad.

1114
01:09:29,007 --> 01:09:30,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck not playing his promo.

1115
01:09:31,028 --> 01:09:32,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Christmas for being too far away.

1116
01:09:33,768 --> 01:09:37,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And fuck Twin for ruining the internet and MIRC.

1117
01:09:37,649 --> 01:09:38,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's cool.

1118
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen to that.

1119
01:09:38,969 --> 01:09:43,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would like to point out that Halle Berry's tits are shown for 10 seconds in Swordfish.

1120
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And what glorious ten seconds they were.

1121
01:09:47,293 --> 01:09:48,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, only like three and a half.

1122
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,654
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is for people who can't get laid.

1123
01:09:50,015 --> 01:09:52,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, only like four or five.

1124
01:09:52,997 --> 01:09:53,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe six.

1125
01:09:54,297 --> 01:09:54,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1126
01:09:55,819 --> 01:09:57,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, I'm reading a book.

1127
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, I don't have clothes on.

1128
01:09:59,941 --> 01:10:03,944
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of like, what's her name in the Thomas Crown Affair?

1129
01:10:03,984 --> 01:10:08,988
[SPEAKER_04]: She's kind of an older lady, but she's still, you know, considering her age, she still has some very nice looking titties.

1130
01:10:09,895 --> 01:10:11,677
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that old chick in the beach.

1131
01:10:13,038 --> 01:10:15,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't watch Leonardo DiCaprio movies.

1132
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:18,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

1133
01:10:19,102 --> 01:10:19,843
[SPEAKER_17]: I have Propel.

1134
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:20,764
[SPEAKER_17]: It's tasty.

1135
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:28,630
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCalKicks says, fuck you to Owen and Mike for both cancelling on me this weekend, resulting in shit getting done on SoCalKicks.

1136
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:31,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, wait, isn't that a good thing if you get work done?

1137
01:10:32,393 --> 01:10:33,734
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he meant like jack shit.

1138
01:10:33,754 --> 01:10:34,735
[SPEAKER_04]: You confused me, sir.

1139
01:10:34,915 --> 01:10:36,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, resulting in jack shit?

1140
01:10:36,076 --> 01:10:37,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he said resulting in shit.

1141
01:10:39,063 --> 01:10:40,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Give me that in the negative fashion.

1142
01:10:40,504 --> 01:10:41,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll see.

1143
01:10:41,064 --> 01:10:42,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we will get a clarification.

1144
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,186
[SPEAKER_18]: Dave's head's on the floor and I can totally kick him in the head now.

1145
01:10:45,286 --> 01:10:45,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

1146
01:10:45,967 --> 01:10:47,588
[SPEAKER_04]: DCB says, F you to the rain.

1147
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:52,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And he wants me to hold off playing some originals towards the end of the show.

1148
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:52,810
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

1149
01:10:54,391 --> 01:10:56,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, to your last thing, the answer is no.

1150
01:11:16,963 --> 01:11:17,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just no, but hell no.

1151
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:19,265
[SPEAKER_04]: When you decide, let me know and I'll still tell you no.

1152
01:11:19,285 --> 01:11:19,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, here!

1153
01:11:44,893 --> 01:11:47,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen her in the chat room in a long time.

1154
01:11:47,874 --> 01:11:51,876
[SPEAKER_06]: She's always idling and then somehow gets disconnected.

1155
01:11:52,056 --> 01:11:56,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to the fact that they tried to contact you multiple times after you've broken up, asking to get back together with you.

1156
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:07,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just laughing because Black Lab's telling off Twen in the chat room, going, please, go get laid, please.

1157
01:12:09,664 --> 01:12:09,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Again?

1158
01:12:11,465 --> 01:12:12,585
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like a daily occurrence.

1159
01:12:12,885 --> 01:12:13,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1160
01:12:15,246 --> 01:12:17,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, Stresa says it's okay.

1161
01:12:17,826 --> 01:12:20,247
[SPEAKER_04]: He cries and you laughing is cool.

1162
01:12:20,607 --> 01:12:21,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I have another F you.

1163
01:12:22,187 --> 01:12:22,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I just remembered now.

1164
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:24,628
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I just think that Dan would kick his ass.

1165
01:12:26,568 --> 01:12:27,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an F you to my camera.

1166
01:12:28,169 --> 01:12:29,229
[SPEAKER_06]: The camera I just bought.

1167
01:12:29,729 --> 01:12:32,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Because all the pictures it takes are way too dark.

1168
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:32,610
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1169
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:34,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even have time to change the music.

1170
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we should give you a flashlight to carry around with it.

1171
01:12:39,116 --> 01:12:39,617
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

1172
01:12:39,657 --> 01:12:41,980
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have the sun behind you and it wouldn't matter.

1173
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I still got a million FUs to get through here.

1174
01:12:44,703 --> 01:12:47,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Brack2000 says, FlashFlash... Oh, whoops.

1175
01:12:47,607 --> 01:12:50,210
[SPEAKER_04]: That was another FU for... That was a hint for earlier in the show.

1176
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:53,514
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to EOSFVB for making him hear the catch-up song.

1177
01:12:53,594 --> 01:12:53,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And he cried.

1178
01:12:56,315 --> 01:12:57,896
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought my ears were going to bleed.

1179
01:12:57,996 --> 01:13:03,580
[SPEAKER_04]: The background song, by the way, is Cheer Train from 2DX7Style, for those that were inquiring.

1180
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,403
[SPEAKER_04]: 23rd Magus says, F you to Skrull for delaying his work on his Tournament Mix entry.

1181
01:13:08,904 --> 01:13:09,924
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good one, too.

1182
01:13:10,044 --> 01:13:11,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Invasion of the Gabba Robots.

1183
01:13:11,505 --> 01:13:12,086
[SPEAKER_04]: All your base.

1184
01:13:12,686 --> 01:13:13,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that would have been beautiful.

1185
01:13:14,107 --> 01:13:16,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I should put a page on my website.

1186
01:13:16,268 --> 01:13:22,072
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Tournament Mix 3 entries that would have been in there, but we got lazy and didn't finish it in time.

1187
01:13:22,092 --> 01:13:23,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I could put mine in there, too.

1188
01:13:23,894 --> 01:13:25,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I never finish mine, either.

1189
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:31,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, I also have an FU to my menu script for not working with Mozilla, which is the browser of the gods.

1190
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:32,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, here.

1191
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Skrull and fuck bad Javascripts.

1192
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:38,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Mother Nature, you do not make me walk home four blocks in horizontal rain, bitch.

1193
01:13:41,391 --> 01:13:47,695
[SPEAKER_04]: EOSFVB says, fuck you to Dave, he didn't get anything for the Mystical Rob Epic Quest, so he at least deserves an FU.

1194
01:13:48,435 --> 01:13:48,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what?

1195
01:13:50,516 --> 01:13:51,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what they're talking about.

1196
01:13:51,517 --> 01:13:53,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no fucking idea what he's talking about.

1197
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,819
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell are you talking about?

1198
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:06,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, fuck you to Bobby Flay for crying like a bitch to get his rematch against Morimoto and then winning a couple years ago.

1199
01:14:06,586 --> 01:14:08,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that was such bullshit.

1200
01:14:09,067 --> 01:14:10,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, he got up, he like,

1201
01:14:11,124 --> 01:14:13,264
[SPEAKER_05]: He stood up on his little chopping board.

1202
01:14:13,284 --> 01:14:15,145
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, yeah, I'm gonna win.

1203
01:14:15,185 --> 01:14:16,365
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he got his ass beat.

1204
01:14:16,725 --> 01:14:17,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he all came back.

1205
01:14:18,386 --> 01:14:20,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Morimoto's like, no, he doesn't deserve to win.

1206
01:14:20,846 --> 01:14:24,227
[SPEAKER_05]: He disgraces himself as a chef because he stands on his equipment.

1207
01:14:24,267 --> 01:14:25,047
[SPEAKER_05]: He can still do that.

1208
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:26,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he gets back later.

1209
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:27,468
[SPEAKER_05]: They go to Japan.

1210
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:30,908
[SPEAKER_05]: And he takes off the chopping board.

1211
01:14:31,188 --> 01:14:31,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And he puts it aside.

1212
01:14:32,029 --> 01:14:33,249
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he stands on the table.

1213
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, okay, you're still a jackass.

1214
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:37,630
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just an idiot.

1215
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:40,813
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, I don't know, they said that he won, but that was such bullshit.

1216
01:14:41,013 --> 01:14:42,795
[SPEAKER_05]: They must have rigged some shit.

1217
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:45,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Morimoto is the king.

1218
01:14:45,758 --> 01:14:46,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

1219
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:47,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, EOSFVB clarified here.

1220
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:57,329
[SPEAKER_04]: He's saying, when I left somewhere, and I brought back stuff for everybody except for Dave, that means you deserve an FU, because you must have done something to not get anything.

1221
01:14:57,349 --> 01:15:02,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... No...

1222
01:15:04,762 --> 01:15:06,424
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to finish.

1223
01:15:06,664 --> 01:15:06,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1224
01:15:07,565 --> 01:15:09,687
[SPEAKER_04]: This segment always runs way too long, but oh well.

1225
01:15:10,028 --> 01:15:11,049
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just angsty.

1226
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:14,472
[SPEAKER_04]: The DDR community and Bomani community in general is just angsty little people.

1227
01:15:16,735 --> 01:15:23,642
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Starbucks on Broadway for being so slow, says SkylineDC505, and it said it made them late to zero period.

1228
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:25,864
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll teach you to go to Starbucks.

1229
01:15:29,496 --> 01:15:33,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Midpower says, F you to Sleep, because his sleeping schedule is all screwed up.

1230
01:15:33,579 --> 01:15:37,782
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to his floppy drive, since he has to run in safe mode whenever he wants to put a file on a floppy disk.

1231
01:15:38,723 --> 01:15:48,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And also F you to Hugh Grant, because the pig... Oh, I'm sorry, I thought he said Hugh Grant, but he's just saying F you to Hugh, the pig in his Animal Crossing game.

1232
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:51,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he magically changed his roof color to yellow.

1233
01:15:52,254 --> 01:15:54,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been red since he started his game and now it's fucking yellow.

1234
01:15:55,658 --> 01:16:01,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And also an FU to EOSFVB since he said an FU to VidPower last week when VidPower wasn't here.

1235
01:16:01,404 --> 01:16:01,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So ha!

1236
01:16:05,754 --> 01:16:07,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I had two people paint my roof in my town.

1237
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:08,876
[SPEAKER_04]: That pissed me the fuck off.

1238
01:16:08,896 --> 01:16:10,857
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, they painted mine Pepto-Bismol pink.

1239
01:16:11,178 --> 01:16:11,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

1240
01:16:11,278 --> 01:16:11,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate Ed.

1241
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:14,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Olivia painted mine like baby boy blue.

1242
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:14,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch.

1243
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,201
[SPEAKER_18]: Send Olivia back to my village.

1244
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:16,981
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take her.

1245
01:16:17,262 --> 01:16:19,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Put her in a big burlap bag and take her back.

1246
01:16:20,003 --> 01:16:21,064
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want her back.

1247
01:16:21,164 --> 01:16:22,325
[SPEAKER_18]: We got our lesbian back, though.

1248
01:16:22,725 --> 01:16:23,186
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

1249
01:16:23,226 --> 01:16:23,786
[SPEAKER_18]: We got Dina.

1250
01:16:24,407 --> 01:16:25,569
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, back to the fuckies.

1251
01:16:25,969 --> 01:16:26,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, back to the fuckies.

1252
01:16:27,611 --> 01:16:30,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Muhimer says, oh, he would like to apologize.

1253
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:35,301
[SPEAKER_04]: With the whole Loki thing, he figured out Loki was just L-O-K-I instead of L-O-K-I-E.

1254
01:16:35,681 --> 01:16:36,602
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like two hours ago.

1255
01:16:36,622 --> 01:16:37,363
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, what the fuck?

1256
01:16:37,383 --> 01:16:38,064
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, sorry.

1257
01:16:38,585 --> 01:16:40,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we all get paid for this little show?

1258
01:16:41,528 --> 01:16:46,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a good... Oh, God, my side hurts.

1259
01:16:46,111 --> 01:16:46,511
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good.

1260
01:16:46,831 --> 01:16:47,291
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we don't.

1261
01:16:48,092 --> 01:16:49,232
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we pay to do it.

1262
01:16:49,372 --> 01:16:50,293
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sad part.

1263
01:16:50,613 --> 01:16:51,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Send your checks.

1264
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:55,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you want to pay us.

1265
01:16:55,956 --> 01:16:57,477
[SPEAKER_18]: Send it, you know, to me.

1266
01:16:57,817 --> 01:17:02,219
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the best way you could pay us is to whore this station out to all your friends and listen all the time.

1267
01:17:02,459 --> 01:17:03,540
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to break our limit.

1268
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:04,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we need to break our limit.

1269
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,901
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to get... Is that a limit breaker?

1270
01:17:08,922 --> 01:17:09,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie is loose.

1271
01:17:10,782 --> 01:17:12,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

1272
01:17:12,443 --> 01:17:16,484
[SPEAKER_04]: They're offering... They said we should set up a PayPal account.

1273
01:17:16,504 --> 01:17:19,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we didn't do that because we don't think people would actually donate to that.

1274
01:17:19,065 --> 01:17:24,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you want to pay me, it would be NightmareHunter at Yahoo.com.

1275
01:17:24,187 --> 01:17:27,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a PayPal account set up to send money, and I'll be appreciative.

1276
01:17:27,608 --> 01:17:30,089
[SPEAKER_04]: That was immediately followed by PayPal ruined the internet.

1277
01:17:32,006 --> 01:17:34,268
[SPEAKER_18]: PayPal ruined my bank account when I had PayPal.

1278
01:17:34,748 --> 01:17:39,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we were like, oh, let's buy Neo Geo cartridges at $300 a piece.

1279
01:17:40,091 --> 01:17:41,052
[SPEAKER_18]: We can pay with PayPal.

1280
01:17:41,112 --> 01:17:42,352
[SPEAKER_18]: It's easy and convenient.

1281
01:17:43,853 --> 01:17:46,475
[SPEAKER_18]: However, it did facilitate me getting Mega Man X4 on Saturn.

1282
01:17:46,615 --> 01:17:47,816
[SPEAKER_18]: Or Rockman X4.

1283
01:17:49,035 --> 01:17:50,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Best way you could show us some lovin'.

1284
01:17:51,576 --> 01:17:53,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Get all your friends to listen to the station.

1285
01:17:53,536 --> 01:17:54,356
[SPEAKER_18]: And take us out for dinner.

1286
01:17:54,476 --> 01:17:55,117
[SPEAKER_04]: And take us out for dinner.

1287
01:17:55,577 --> 01:18:05,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, if you want to go to live365.com and play around on their website, what you can do, you can set Orange Lounge Radio to your very favorite radio station.

1288
01:18:06,259 --> 01:18:10,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And if enough people do that, then we start getting discounts from Live365.

1289
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:16,822
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to kind of inadvertently give us money without giving us money, go set Orange Lounge Radio as your favorite station on Live365.

1290
01:18:16,862 --> 01:18:18,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go into your presets.

1291
01:18:18,482 --> 01:18:23,510
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to add Orange Lounge Radio as a preset and then you're going to say which one of your presets do you want to make your favorite station.

1292
01:18:23,931 --> 01:18:26,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Select Orange Lounge Radio and we're all happy campers.

1293
01:18:27,516 --> 01:18:28,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also do appearances.

1294
01:18:28,858 --> 01:18:31,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't charge that much by hour, so look me up.

1295
01:18:33,982 --> 01:18:41,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's great if Orange Lounge Radio is already in your presets, but if you want to make it your favorite preset, that's even better.

1296
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:42,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And we love you lots for that.

1297
01:18:42,765 --> 01:18:43,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And it helps us.

1298
01:18:43,605 --> 01:18:43,965
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1299
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:45,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Helps us pay bills.

1300
01:18:45,506 --> 01:18:52,988
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I don't need to do that because I just have a link or a shortcut to my desktop, so I don't even need to go on there.

1301
01:18:53,949 --> 01:18:57,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I realized that most people don't do that.

1302
01:18:57,373 --> 01:18:58,134
[SPEAKER_04]: But do it anyway.

1303
01:18:58,174 --> 01:18:59,536
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to make us happy, do it anyway.

1304
01:18:59,576 --> 01:19:00,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to the website for once.

1305
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:03,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a free account.

1306
01:19:04,502 --> 01:19:07,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Use a fake email address or whatever so all the spam goes there.

1307
01:19:08,186 --> 01:19:08,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

1308
01:19:09,768 --> 01:19:12,872
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, tell them that you love Orange Lounge Radio more than anything.

1309
01:19:13,913 --> 01:19:14,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1310
01:19:14,534 --> 01:19:19,560
[SPEAKER_18]: It sucks having a screen name for like eight years because I get so much junk mail on it now.

1311
01:19:20,401 --> 01:19:23,025
[SPEAKER_18]: On my DarkSakura thing.

1312
01:19:23,065 --> 01:19:23,846
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way... Yes?

1313
01:19:23,866 --> 01:19:24,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

1314
01:19:25,413 --> 01:19:31,655
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I have to say something that I'm going to actually retract one of my old FUs.

1315
01:19:32,216 --> 01:19:32,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

1316
01:19:33,196 --> 01:19:33,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

1317
01:19:33,796 --> 01:19:35,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie is going to retract an old FU, so what do I do?

1318
01:19:35,977 --> 01:19:37,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I play Sligwork backwards?

1319
01:19:37,538 --> 01:19:38,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I play a happy song?

1320
01:19:38,518 --> 01:19:39,158
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I play?

1321
01:19:39,579 --> 01:19:39,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1322
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:45,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Another FU to Pepsi and pretzels because I feel like I'm going to explode.

1323
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:47,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, cool, do it.

1324
01:19:48,604 --> 01:19:50,504
[SPEAKER_18]: No, play something happy.

1325
01:19:50,644 --> 01:19:51,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Play something happy.

1326
01:19:52,025 --> 01:19:54,345
[SPEAKER_18]: Play the Changma song.

1327
01:19:55,286 --> 01:19:56,106
[SPEAKER_04]: The Changma song?

1328
01:19:56,246 --> 01:19:56,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1329
01:19:57,926 --> 01:19:59,927
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, I don't think I have Changma queued up.

1330
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:00,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1331
01:20:02,328 --> 01:20:05,489
[SPEAKER_04]: How about we can play... We're playing old.

1332
01:20:05,989 --> 01:20:06,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Old?

1333
01:20:06,349 --> 01:20:06,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Boys?

1334
01:20:07,209 --> 01:20:07,589
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1335
01:20:07,609 --> 01:20:08,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom Boom Dollar?

1336
01:20:08,810 --> 01:20:09,470
[SPEAKER_04]: My Fire?

1337
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:10,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad Girls?

1338
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:10,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's Get Down.

1339
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:11,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's Get Down.

1340
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:11,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is a happy song.

1341
01:20:12,371 --> 01:20:12,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1342
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:41,808
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm retracting my FU about the people who send me instant messages because now I couldn't hop on my DJ Celica I'm going to go ahead and say it I have a username now I'm not going to give the full one out but it's primarily DJ Celica that's one of my AIM names that is not the full AIM name by the way because I'm not going to say the whole thing on the air I would sign on that and get no less than 17 IMs in one sitting

1343
01:20:42,828 --> 01:20:45,309
[SPEAKER_18]: You should have seen it during the time that Shaft was going on.

1344
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:49,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I counted it during my first five minutes of being online without an away message.

1345
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:51,252
[SPEAKER_18]: I had 30 IMs.

1346
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:51,252
30.

1347
01:20:53,113 --> 01:20:54,714
[SPEAKER_18]: 13.

1348
01:20:54,134 --> 01:20:54,714
[SPEAKER_18]: I counted them.

1349
01:20:54,794 --> 01:20:55,514
[SPEAKER_04]: You're so popular.

1350
01:20:56,435 --> 01:21:02,458
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I'm actually happy to say that I was on my name for a little while yesterday.

1351
01:21:03,018 --> 01:21:05,579
[SPEAKER_18]: I had the thing on for 10 minutes without an away message.

1352
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,841
[SPEAKER_18]: And I didn't get a single message.

1353
01:21:07,881 --> 01:21:08,681
[SPEAKER_18]: So, thank you.

1354
01:21:09,862 --> 01:21:10,322
[SPEAKER_18]: However...

1355
01:21:11,511 --> 01:21:15,538
[SPEAKER_18]: One of my other, my AOL name that used to go on all the time.

1356
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:17,080
[SPEAKER_18]: That one's gotten better.

1357
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:21,828
[SPEAKER_18]: There's people who are not randomly IMing me when I haven't given them the permission to IM me.

1358
01:21:22,643 --> 01:21:47,342
[SPEAKER_18]: and although I have to say I took one of my names off of hiding and lo and behold even after 8 years I'm still getting like 20 million messages on that name so I put it back on hiding so I'm going to go and be more specific with who I see that way and the people by the way who I don't mind messaging me you know who you are and I never care

1359
01:21:48,346 --> 01:21:54,248
[SPEAKER_18]: But for all those random people who, like, I barely know or maybe see, like, you know, once.

1360
01:21:54,488 --> 01:21:56,409
[SPEAKER_18]: I've seen you at, like, a tournament or something.

1361
01:21:56,949 --> 01:22:00,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Or I haven't known you for longer than at least two years, you know.

1362
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:05,672
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, give me a few minutes to sit on line and just be here for a while.

1363
01:22:06,352 --> 01:22:09,853
[SPEAKER_18]: Before you decide, oh my god, I have to talk to Jamie right now!

1364
01:22:11,374 --> 01:22:12,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless your house is burning.

1365
01:22:12,814 --> 01:22:14,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless your house is burning and then call a fire department.

1366
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:18,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I am your fire department.

1367
01:22:19,032 --> 01:22:20,756
[SPEAKER_18]: I ain't your fire department, I'm sorry.

1368
01:22:23,342 --> 01:22:23,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1369
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:32,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I accept IMs, but unfortunately I'm... Well, anyways, my AOL Instant Messenger thing is SacramentoLoki0.

1370
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:36,957
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you happen to be on there, go ahead and IM me.

1371
01:22:37,277 --> 01:22:38,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, I'm never on there.

1372
01:22:38,357 --> 01:22:40,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know, that's what I do.

1373
01:22:40,058 --> 01:22:41,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't use Instant Messenger.

1374
01:22:42,279 --> 01:22:45,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking of things online, though, I actually, if we're done with RFUs of the week... Yeah.

1375
01:22:46,221 --> 01:22:47,582
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I actually have an announcement.

1376
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:49,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Announcement, announcement, announcement.

1377
01:22:49,703 --> 01:22:50,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I made this announcement.

1378
01:22:50,464 --> 01:22:53,265
[SPEAKER_02]: A horrible way to die, a horrible way to die, a horrible way to die.

1379
01:22:55,034 --> 01:22:55,955
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, I'm going to hit you with a ferret.

1380
01:22:57,215 --> 01:22:57,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Ow!

1381
01:23:00,257 --> 01:23:00,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

1382
01:23:01,618 --> 01:23:05,280
[SPEAKER_18]: I want a pretzel.

1383
01:23:07,401 --> 01:23:08,301
[SPEAKER_18]: I got a pretzel smush, haha.

1384
01:23:08,662 --> 01:23:17,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, this announcement, I don't know if anyone remembers me mentioning the thing based off a radio drama based off of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.

1385
01:23:19,648 --> 01:23:21,671
[SPEAKER_18]: There's one position left open.

1386
01:23:21,711 --> 01:23:24,774
[SPEAKER_18]: We need your audition reel.

1387
01:23:25,895 --> 01:23:32,523
[SPEAKER_18]: So the position left open, if I remember correctly, is the drunken zombie date.

1388
01:23:33,684 --> 01:23:34,585
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura at AOL.com

1389
01:23:54,148 --> 01:23:58,751
[SPEAKER_18]: That which is, by the way, the name that's hidden from anybody ever knowing that I'm online.

1390
01:23:59,191 --> 01:23:59,752
[SPEAKER_18]: So go ahead.

1391
01:24:00,072 --> 01:24:02,233
[SPEAKER_18]: You can buddy list that all you want to because you'll never see it.

1392
01:24:03,734 --> 01:24:11,359
[SPEAKER_18]: But go ahead and email me your voice acting reel, your audition to DarkSakura at AOL.com.

1393
01:24:11,559 --> 01:24:12,519
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of voice would that be?

1394
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a whiny goth boy voice?

1395
01:24:14,481 --> 01:24:15,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Drunken zombie date.

1396
01:24:15,701 --> 01:24:16,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Drunken zombie date.

1397
01:24:16,462 --> 01:24:16,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's drunk.

1398
01:24:16,902 --> 01:24:17,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1399
01:24:17,182 --> 01:24:17,423
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1400
01:24:17,443 --> 01:24:19,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to be a drunken zombie.

1401
01:24:21,705 --> 01:24:22,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1402
01:24:22,366 --> 01:24:22,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1403
01:24:23,473 --> 01:24:24,793
[SPEAKER_18]: And where's your audition reel?

1404
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:25,653
[SPEAKER_18]: You said you were interested.

1405
01:24:25,673 --> 01:24:27,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh, I got lazy.

1406
01:24:31,174 --> 01:24:33,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Just send them to me.

1407
01:24:33,555 --> 01:24:40,956
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're hoping to get underway with the recording soon, and it will be broadcast on this very radio station once we get a first episode out.

1408
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:43,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And give that email address out one more time.

1409
01:24:44,217 --> 01:24:46,817
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura at ALL.com Beautiful.

1410
01:24:47,237 --> 01:24:50,338
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is funny, because I had that name before there was a Dark Sakura.

1411
01:24:51,358 --> 01:24:51,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

1412
01:24:52,148 --> 01:24:53,489
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura

1413
01:25:18,518 --> 01:25:19,480
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's because I'm neat.

1414
01:25:19,701 --> 01:25:24,192
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the whole history of why I have that name now, but send me auditions.

1415
01:25:25,069 --> 01:25:30,651
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back and do the cage match for this week.

1416
01:25:30,671 --> 01:25:31,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

1417
01:25:31,071 --> 01:25:33,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we didn't do a cage match last week, so we're going to do tonight's cage match.

1418
01:25:34,372 --> 01:25:36,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll do some more fun stuff.

1419
01:25:36,773 --> 01:25:41,195
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a list list to get to at some point tonight, so we'll do all that in a little bit.

1420
01:25:41,215 --> 01:25:44,396
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be a short break, because we're going to be doing more music during the cage match.

1421
01:25:45,156 --> 01:25:48,057
[SPEAKER_04]: But we just want to get up and stretch and pee.

1422
01:25:48,217 --> 01:25:48,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And eat pretzels.

1423
01:25:49,058 --> 01:25:49,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And eat pretzels.

1424
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:51,419
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll be back.

1425
01:25:51,699 --> 01:25:51,959
[SPEAKER_04]: See you.

1426
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:52,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange on Radio.

DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1428
01:27:35,770 --> 01:28:03,947
[SPEAKER_09]: He knew that his heart was feeling He'd been hurt too much to try again But when she caught his eye Ain't no man could fight the feeling He knew he had to try to let go of it Mother let him know She was in the mood for talking So when he began to play the game Before he knew it He had told her how much he'd been hurting How he was hoping she was not the same Would you see the kinds of ladies that are

1429
01:28:10,687 --> 01:28:15,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't have to look no more, I'll give the love you need, Do you holler enough?

1430
01:28:15,449 --> 01:28:16,390

You've been hurt, but see, so what?

1434
01:28:31,356 --> 01:28:33,317
I am the cure, And when you wake up late,

1435
01:31:38,035 --> 01:31:39,856
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you think this is the end?

1436
01:31:40,776 --> 01:31:42,296
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not the end.

1437
01:31:42,537 --> 01:31:44,677
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the beginning of your next journey.

1438
01:31:45,077 --> 01:31:49,199
[SPEAKER_11]: The Good Pool Journey Part 2.

1439
01:31:59,202 --> 01:32:02,503
[SPEAKER_22]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

1440
01:32:03,023 --> 01:32:03,804
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1441
01:32:06,881 --> 01:32:07,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave's doing the dance.

1442
01:32:10,345 --> 01:32:11,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Dave is doing the dance.

1443
01:32:11,246 --> 01:32:13,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I've got to play that one more time just so Dave can do the dance.

1444
01:32:15,872 --> 01:32:18,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go, here we go.

1445
01:32:19,376 --> 01:32:22,640
[SPEAKER_22]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

1446
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,762
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1447
01:32:26,116 --> 01:32:28,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best part, because that looks like Ricky Martin right there.

1448
01:32:28,839 --> 01:32:32,983
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like he's doing the Latino pata pata.

1449
01:32:34,404 --> 01:32:38,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Later on, even though you can't see it, I'm just going to do it anyway, so screw you.

1450
01:32:38,969 --> 01:32:40,110
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't even see what I'm doing.

1451
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:41,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I like that.

1452
01:32:41,512 --> 01:32:43,313
[SPEAKER_04]: EOSFBB, Spider-Man does the dance.

1453
01:32:43,934 --> 01:32:47,257
[SPEAKER_18]: That looks stupid, though.

1454
01:32:47,397 --> 01:32:49,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Later on, all the girls go like this.

1455
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:54,882
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm pretty much good in C. He just shook his hips in rhythm.

1456
01:32:55,762 --> 01:32:57,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Loki's having problems here.

1457
01:32:57,743 --> 01:32:58,163
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?

1458
01:32:58,723 --> 01:33:00,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's flipping off my roommate's computer.

1459
01:33:00,643 --> 01:33:01,444
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your problem?

1460
01:33:03,084 --> 01:33:03,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Net zero.

1461
01:33:03,925 --> 01:33:05,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want me to submit it for you?

1462
01:33:05,725 --> 01:33:06,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, Jamie's going to do it.

1463
01:33:06,946 --> 01:33:09,166
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to submit Loki.

1464
01:33:09,246 --> 01:33:09,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I just burped.

1465
01:33:10,087 --> 01:33:10,627
[SPEAKER_04]: That was gross.

1466
01:33:10,947 --> 01:33:11,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Burp.

1467
01:33:11,747 --> 01:33:14,209
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to submit Loki's Tourney Mix 3 entry right now.

1468
01:33:14,229 --> 01:33:19,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Continue to FU to net zero because they suck ass and their servers are slow as ass.

1469
01:33:20,654 --> 01:33:22,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to use ass as an adjective for now.

1470
01:33:24,741 --> 01:33:25,262
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's it.

1471
01:33:25,542 --> 01:33:26,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's having issues.

1472
01:33:26,823 --> 01:33:27,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1473
01:33:28,545 --> 01:33:33,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose this is the portion of the show where we should get into another little thing that we do here every week.

1474
01:33:34,892 --> 01:33:37,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is... Let me clear my throat.

1475
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:40,978
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it is the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1476
01:33:41,018 --> 01:33:41,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody...

1477
01:33:42,672 --> 01:33:49,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week in the cage match, actually two weeks ago, we didn't do it last week, because we did a pre-tape show.

1478
01:33:50,655 --> 01:33:57,218
[SPEAKER_04]: So last week's winner of the cage match, a couple weeks ago, was... I'm trying to find it, I can't find it.

1479
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:59,339
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Knight Rider theme.

1480
01:34:00,579 --> 01:34:01,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the chair, it's so beautiful

1481
01:34:46,587 --> 01:34:48,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1482
01:35:02,338 --> 01:35:04,959
[SPEAKER_04]: The Knight Rider theme, done all, redone.

1483
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:05,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one more F you.

1484
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:07,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Dave.

1485
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:08,701
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a little late.

1486
01:35:09,262 --> 01:35:09,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

1487
01:35:10,282 --> 01:35:10,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about it.

1488
01:35:11,062 --> 01:35:13,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I had thought about it, like, on Wednesday.

1489
01:35:13,484 --> 01:35:15,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, damn, I need to, okay.

1490
01:35:16,125 --> 01:35:17,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I got kicked out of Jamie's chair.

1491
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:20,112
[SPEAKER_18]: Technically, it's Brian's chair, but I claim it.

1492
01:35:20,953 --> 01:35:21,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1493
01:35:22,255 --> 01:35:23,897
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to get music or whatever.

1494
01:35:23,917 --> 01:35:26,240
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm queuing up the first contender.

1495
01:35:26,641 --> 01:35:27,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So good, I'm wasting time.

1496
01:35:28,123 --> 01:35:36,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, F you to all the people who think that everyone who goes to the gym is just compensating for a small penis, because that's not true.

1497
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:39,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Where does that come from?

1498
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I like going to the gym.

1499
01:35:42,021 --> 01:35:42,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I am weak.

1500
01:35:43,743 --> 01:35:49,927
[SPEAKER_05]: But lots of people who don't go to the gym, it's like, oh, you stupid people just go to the gym because you have penis envy or whatever.

1501
01:35:51,368 --> 01:35:53,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's looking at me like a madman.

1502
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just confused.

1503
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:57,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the gym, but I don't think it's a penis thing.

1504
01:36:08,969 --> 01:36:15,395
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think you would get a date, especially if they saw you doing your little ketchup chicken dance.

1505
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:22,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about this, I'm trying to find a particular part of this song.

1506
01:36:24,019 --> 01:36:25,740
[SPEAKER_18]: No, don't pose, please, don't pose.

1507
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:26,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1508
01:36:28,962 --> 01:36:29,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Posing is fun.

1509
01:36:30,643 --> 01:36:31,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, yes.

1510
01:36:33,064 --> 01:36:39,487
[SPEAKER_04]: The cage match, the way the cage match works, we're going to play two new songs for you that are contenders for the title of the cage match champion.

1511
01:36:39,967 --> 01:36:46,551
[SPEAKER_04]: You can vote for either one of the two new songs, or you can vote for last week's winner, the Knight Rider theme that we just played for you.

1512
01:36:47,011 --> 01:36:52,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And the winning song will be put into rotation all week long on our Bimani Music and More program, which plays...

1513
01:36:53,214 --> 01:36:55,435
[SPEAKER_04]: All the time on this station when we're not live.

1514
01:36:55,835 --> 01:36:59,477
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can vote for the Knight Rider theme or you can vote for this one, the first contender.

1515
01:37:00,037 --> 01:37:02,478
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a band that I've fucking fallen in love with lately.

1516
01:37:02,538 --> 01:37:03,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this band.

1517
01:37:03,478 --> 01:37:06,920
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a band called Frow Frow and this song is called Breathe In.

1518
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:07,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't laugh, it's cool.

1519
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:08,501
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cool.

1520
01:37:08,681 --> 01:37:09,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Frow Frow.

1521
01:37:10,001 --> 01:37:11,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Frow Frow rules.

1522
01:37:11,282 --> 01:37:11,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And this song...

1523
01:37:12,182 --> 01:37:14,203
[SPEAKER_18]: Breathe In The Beginning of a Song by Bush

1524
01:37:40,090 --> 01:38:08,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Breathe In, Breathe Out, Breathe In, Gotta Mushy Head Okay, okay, here we go This is the first contender, you can vote for it But we will not accept any votes until both songs have completely played So you can vote for either the Knight Rider theme or you can vote for this This is Frow Frow with the DJ Encore mix of Breathe In here on Orange Lounge Radio I'm sorry, that's not where it's supposed to start It's supposed to start right in here Here we go This is it, Frow Frow

1525
01:38:17,667 --> 01:38:19,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I need you.

1526
01:38:20,656 --> 01:38:21,719
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I'm good at it.

1527
01:38:22,301 --> 01:38:23,123
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so spotted.

1528
01:40:09,474 --> 01:40:10,815
Thanks for watching!

1529
01:42:49,213 --> 01:42:54,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that was Frow Frow with the DJ Encore remix of Breathe In in the cage match.

1530
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:59,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So, next question we gotta ask is, what did you guys think of that one?

1531
01:43:00,246 --> 01:43:01,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Well... Dave?

1532
01:43:02,028 --> 01:43:04,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that it was pretty good, but...

1533
01:43:04,671 --> 01:43:07,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of long, I mean, almost.

1534
01:43:08,453 --> 01:43:10,294
[SPEAKER_04]: It is six minutes, but I cut out the first minute.

1535
01:43:10,474 --> 01:43:10,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1536
01:43:10,774 --> 01:43:11,514
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I started a little there.

1537
01:43:11,554 --> 01:43:24,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's still a little long, but I really think that it would go much better without the lyrics, because they just kind of brought it down and made it sound corny, in my opinion.

1538
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:25,560
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's fine.

1539
01:43:26,461 --> 01:43:27,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, what did you think of Prowl Prowl?

1540
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,962
[SPEAKER_18]: It reminded me of Forest.

1541
01:43:31,243 --> 01:43:31,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

1542
01:43:31,563 --> 01:43:32,564
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to take a nap.

1543
01:43:32,584 --> 01:43:33,404
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

1544
01:43:34,286 --> 01:43:35,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what'd you think of Frow Frow?

1545
01:43:36,208 --> 01:43:37,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the voice was annoying.

1546
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:40,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I love Imogen Heath, she rules.

1547
01:43:40,151 --> 01:43:40,812
[SPEAKER_18]: Inya does dance.

1548
01:43:41,012 --> 01:43:41,613
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not Inya!

1549
01:43:42,273 --> 01:43:45,136
[SPEAKER_18]: I had to go to the bathroom during it, so I thought I had to be Inya.

1550
01:43:45,697 --> 01:43:46,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, I loved it.

1551
01:43:46,878 --> 01:43:48,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Love, love, loved it, because I love Frow Frow.

1552
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:49,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, scale of 1 to 10.

1553
01:43:50,061 --> 01:43:50,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie?

1554
01:43:50,361 --> 01:43:50,341
6.

1555
01:43:52,563 --> 01:43:53,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, Loki?

1556
01:43:53,444 --> 01:43:53,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go for 6.

1557
01:43:54,685 --> 01:43:54,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave?

1558
01:43:55,846 --> 01:43:54,985
7.

1559
01:43:56,466 --> 01:43:57,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I give it a 10, it's perfect.

1560
01:43:59,389 --> 01:43:59,749
[SPEAKER_04]: D.Va.

1561
01:43:59,769 --> 01:44:00,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1562
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,642
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another overclocked remix done by Final Fantasy Music DJ

1563
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:27,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, okay, I have to warn you guys, it does have a really strange intro and ending to it, just because this is a birthday gift to someone.

1564
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:33,887
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it'll get into the song, but just don't be thrown off by the annoying voices in the very beginning of it.

1565
01:44:34,328 --> 01:44:37,252
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's an awesome remix of the Airship theme from Final Fantasy VII.

1566
01:44:37,745 --> 01:44:38,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so here it is.

1567
01:44:38,886 --> 01:44:40,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Another Final Fantasy remix.

1568
01:44:40,267 --> 01:44:42,828
[SPEAKER_04]: We had one win the cage match about three weeks ago, and here's another one.

1569
01:44:43,328 --> 01:44:46,570
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the remix of the Airship theme from... Who does this?

1570
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:48,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's the same guy who did the other one.

1571
01:44:48,632 --> 01:44:50,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the FF Music DJ, I'm sorry.

1572
01:44:51,273 --> 01:44:53,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I was only half paying attention because I was trying to queue it up.

1573
01:44:53,494 --> 01:44:54,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

1574
01:44:59,018 --> 01:45:00,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It's spinning the CD and going.

1575
01:45:00,679 --> 01:45:01,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1576
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:03,760
Hey, boy!

1577
01:45:04,801 --> 01:45:06,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy birthday!

1578
01:45:07,119 --> 01:45:07,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?

1579
01:45:08,499 --> 01:45:09,940
[SPEAKER_08]: I made you a remix!

1580
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Of Sam's theme!

1581
01:45:13,521 --> 01:45:23,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me sing it for you!

1582
01:45:30,605 --> 01:45:32,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds like someone's, like, pleasuring themselves.

1583
01:45:34,590 --> 01:45:35,633
Thank you for watching!

1584
01:46:45,257 --> 01:46:45,817
Thanks for watching!

1585
01:47:13,713 --> 01:47:14,457
Thanks for watching!

1586
01:48:46,914 --> 01:48:47,755
Thank you for watching!

1587
01:49:57,940 --> 01:49:59,101
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty, that was it.

1588
01:49:59,141 --> 01:50:05,404
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the FF Music DJ with the Final Fantasy VII Airship theme remix.

1589
01:50:05,464 --> 01:50:07,245
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a little funky name to it here.

1590
01:50:07,285 --> 01:50:09,906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Otan Jubi.

1591
01:50:11,487 --> 01:50:12,447
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the real name of it.

1592
01:50:12,927 --> 01:50:15,068
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's your other entrant in the cage match.

1593
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:16,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So vote now.

1594
01:50:16,169 --> 01:50:17,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Just send me a private message in the chat room.

1595
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:21,191
[SPEAKER_04]: You can vote for... Oh yeah, sorry, we can do our opinions too.

1596
01:50:21,591 --> 01:50:22,031
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

1597
01:50:23,092 --> 01:50:24,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave said he liked it and gives it a 9.

1598
01:50:26,611 --> 01:50:27,784
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd say I like it and give it a 9.

1599
01:50:30,703 --> 01:50:33,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it, so I give it a 9 too, I guess.

1600
01:50:34,186 --> 01:50:37,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it, but not as much as Frow Frow, but I gave Frow Frow a 10, so I can give that a 9.

1601
01:50:37,569 --> 01:50:41,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So we all gave that a 9.

1602
01:50:42,613 --> 01:50:42,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.

1603
01:50:44,135 --> 01:50:46,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so, oh, did your entry get in?

1604
01:50:46,517 --> 01:50:52,482

[SPEAKER_06]: Watch it bounce.

1607
01:50:55,204 --> 01:50:56,805

[SPEAKER_06]: Please vote next week for the name of the game, Hybrid LA Blackout Remix.

1612
01:51:34,858 --> 01:51:36,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the votes are coming in.

1613
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:37,981
[SPEAKER_04]: We will tally those up during the next break.

01:51:38,082 --> 01:51:38,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1619
01:51:58,599 --> 01:51:59,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, no.

1620
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:00,820
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I get nothing but spam.

1621
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:02,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, don't, yeah, don't send spam.

1622
01:52:02,181 --> 01:52:02,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I like good mail.

1623
01:52:02,901 --> 01:52:04,642
[SPEAKER_04]: If you send spam, fuck you.

1624
01:52:04,802 --> 01:52:05,202
[SPEAKER_18]: Send money.

1625
01:52:05,442 --> 01:52:05,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1626
01:52:06,703 --> 01:52:08,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we had somebody vote for the Animal Crossing theme.

1627
01:52:08,644 --> 01:52:13,526
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not one of your choices in today's... Maybe next week's Cage Match, but not tonight.

1628
01:52:13,546 --> 01:52:15,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we should play that once more tonight.

1629
01:52:15,047 --> 01:52:16,707
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another Animal Crossing song.

1630
01:52:16,947 --> 01:52:17,308
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do that.

1631
01:52:17,328 --> 01:52:19,188
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll close... Oh, okay.

1632
01:52:19,589 --> 01:52:20,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll save it for later.

1633
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:24,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Do Animal Crossing music Cage Match.

1634
01:52:24,391 --> 01:52:25,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, K.K.

1635
01:52:25,131 --> 01:52:26,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Cospo would win, because that's my favorite.

1636
01:52:27,853 --> 01:52:29,395
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's all about Lucky KK.

1637
01:52:29,835 --> 01:52:32,097
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, Riverdance and Animal Crossing.

1638
01:52:34,379 --> 01:52:38,083
[SPEAKER_04]: SkylineDC505 says, isn't it too late to enter TourneyMix 3?

1639
01:52:39,384 --> 01:52:42,627
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just missed the deadline by a half an hour.

1640
01:52:42,667 --> 01:52:43,508
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean you got the deadline?

1641
01:52:43,528 --> 01:52:44,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the deadline by just a half an hour.

1642
01:52:45,150 --> 01:52:45,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So, half an hour.

1643
01:52:47,572 --> 01:52:48,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good, very good.

1644
01:52:48,433 --> 01:52:52,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So what kind of things were you considering when you made your DWI?

1645
01:52:53,086 --> 01:52:54,406
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of things was considered?

1646
01:52:54,546 --> 01:52:55,186
[SPEAKER_04]: What went into it?

1647
01:52:55,226 --> 01:52:56,427
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you pick the song?

1648
01:52:56,487 --> 01:52:58,007
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you design the steps?

1649
01:52:58,347 --> 01:52:59,907
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you do the background?

1650
01:53:00,168 --> 01:53:03,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the song I picked actually was my second choice.

1651
01:53:03,368 --> 01:53:07,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I had a first choice, which is Alien World from 8Style.

1652
01:53:07,829 --> 01:53:09,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have that halfway done.

1653
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:11,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I just decided, no, I like the song better.

1654
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:12,510
[SPEAKER_06]: So I picked that song.

1655
01:53:12,930 --> 01:53:19,932
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bit succinct because the second part of the song... The whole song kind of slows down as it's going through gradually, but...

1656
01:53:20,852 --> 01:53:30,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to edit it down, and the second half of the song, or second third of the song, last third of the song, there we go, is 128.036 BPM.

1657
01:53:31,878 --> 01:53:32,519
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exact.

1658
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:43,065
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, though, is Stepmania and DWI don't do three digit BPMs, at least not without editing the file itself.

1659
01:53:43,525 --> 01:53:50,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So I finally got it synced, except there's like one step that's not synced, which I don't really give a crap, because it's one step and no one's going to notice.

1660
01:53:51,149 --> 01:53:54,871
[SPEAKER_06]: It's off by like 1 64th of a note, so I really don't care.

1661
01:53:55,393 --> 01:54:01,698
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, the background took me, uh, maybe 10, 15 minutes to do.

1662
01:54:02,098 --> 01:54:03,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it all in Photoshop, looks pretty.

1663
01:54:04,641 --> 01:54:08,744
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, the steps I finished just before I got here for the show.

1664
01:54:08,864 --> 01:54:10,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I finished the heavy step stairs.

1665
01:54:11,246 --> 01:54:17,671
[SPEAKER_06]: A part in it where it's, it goes kind of, it's, I think it starts off at like 135, goes down to this, oh wait, what is it?

1666
01:54:17,691 --> 01:54:19,673
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, um, one...

1667
01:54:21,314 --> 01:54:25,357
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember, it goes down to half speed in the middle, and then it comes back up to 128.

1668
01:54:26,558 --> 01:54:33,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And during the half speed part, there's a 30 second note thing going on there, so it's kind of hard to read, but it's all synced.

1669
01:54:35,083 --> 01:54:37,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And, I don't know, they're pretty fun.

1670
01:54:37,345 --> 01:54:41,548
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of plays like Era, but a little bit more complicated.

1671
01:54:41,848 --> 01:54:43,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So, just try it out.

1672
01:54:43,949 --> 01:54:44,350
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be fun.

1673
01:54:44,370 --> 01:54:46,311
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

1674
01:54:46,923 --> 01:54:47,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Word.

1675
01:54:47,964 --> 01:54:56,029
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think are going to be the big sim files to watch out for, the big artists, or the big creators out there that are going to have some good stuff?

1676
01:54:56,129 --> 01:55:10,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't think BimaniRuler is putting anything in this time, so they'll probably just have CMCM do something, then KamenKey makes a lot of stuff, VitaX, whatever, does a lot of stuff.

1677
01:55:11,658 --> 01:55:12,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know.

1678
01:55:12,218 --> 01:55:13,438
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people that know.

1679
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:17,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Or DDR Master F, you know, might see something from him.

1680
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:18,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Moogle Hunter, definitely.

1681
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:27,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, I don't know, it's always surprising because you'll see people that you've never heard of and then just all of a sudden they'll come out with something pretty cool.

1682
01:55:27,142 --> 01:55:28,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really hard to tell.

1683
01:55:29,503 --> 01:55:32,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait until they have an actual list of what's on there.

1684
01:55:32,043 --> 01:55:34,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you'll kind of see what they try out.

1685
01:55:36,610 --> 01:55:40,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to enter, but I got lazy, so I'll enter MakeEditGetPorn instead or something.

1686
01:55:41,092 --> 01:55:43,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I don't want any of the porn that Loki's given away.

1687
01:55:43,574 --> 01:55:49,697
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a really cool, you know, well, I made a really cool background for his song.

1688
01:55:49,757 --> 01:55:54,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I finished the basic and trick steps, I just only got about three measures into the maniac steps, so whatever.

1689
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:58,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, fuck contests, fuck them right in the ear.

1690
01:55:58,641 --> 01:56:00,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just release it because I'm cool.

1691
01:56:01,503 --> 01:56:04,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to be, I don't have to whore it out under any contest.

1692
01:56:04,704 --> 01:56:05,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm me, dammit.

1693
01:56:07,608 --> 01:56:08,910
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a special contest.

1694
01:56:08,990 --> 01:56:13,378
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the Sky Owns You at SimFiles, so nobody wins except Sky.

1695
01:56:13,658 --> 01:56:16,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I could run a tourney mix, but I just don't have the web space.

1696
01:56:17,585 --> 01:56:19,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but you wouldn't want to rip off a big idea anyway.

1697
01:56:19,969 --> 01:56:21,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it at GetPorn's cooler anyway.

1698
01:56:22,404 --> 01:56:23,285
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, here's the thing.

1699
01:56:23,525 --> 01:56:26,786
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how they were going to have a special category where you actually had to pay to get in?

1700
01:56:26,826 --> 01:56:28,227
[SPEAKER_06]: They were going to have prizes?

1701
01:56:28,707 --> 01:56:29,828
[SPEAKER_06]: They aren't having that no more.

1702
01:56:29,928 --> 01:56:30,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a bummer.

1703
01:56:30,428 --> 01:56:30,868
[SPEAKER_04]: No one entered.

1704
01:56:31,248 --> 01:56:31,868
[SPEAKER_04]: No one entered.

1705
01:56:32,048 --> 01:56:32,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise!

1706
01:56:32,489 --> 01:56:33,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to pay money.

1707
01:56:33,909 --> 01:56:34,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

1708
01:56:34,630 --> 01:56:35,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyways.

1709
01:56:35,870 --> 01:56:37,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that fell through.

1710
01:56:37,711 --> 01:56:40,772
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can always do mine where I give out anime DVDs.

1711
01:56:40,892 --> 01:56:41,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

1712
01:56:41,312 --> 01:56:41,753
[SPEAKER_02]: DVDs!

1713
01:56:42,213 --> 01:56:43,013
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

1714
01:56:43,593 --> 01:56:43,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1715
01:56:45,074 --> 01:56:47,935
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back.

1716
01:56:47,975 --> 01:56:48,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?

1717
01:56:48,716 --> 01:56:49,376
[SPEAKER_04]: In this break...

1718
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio at Yahoo.com

1719
01:57:18,627 --> 01:57:23,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start off with the Freshness in India Amazing Mix.

1720
01:57:23,668 --> 01:57:27,068
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from DCB, and his remixes are always very interesting.

1721
01:57:27,929 --> 01:57:30,109
[SPEAKER_04]: DCB had a very cool one the other day.

1722
01:57:30,169 --> 01:57:34,030
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a remix of Happy Meal that we played on a fuck-off that ended with the theme to Hey Dude.

1723
01:57:36,370 --> 01:57:39,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was like the coolest Nickelodeon show ever.

1724
01:57:39,171 --> 01:57:40,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Dude.

1725
01:57:40,451 --> 01:57:41,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, let me see if I can find it.

1726
01:57:41,591 --> 01:57:42,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

1727
01:57:43,011 --> 01:57:45,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to the end of the Happy Meal Evil Mix here, just so I can play this.

1728
01:57:48,399 --> 01:57:48,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait.

1729
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:49,981
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the end of here.

1730
01:57:50,001 --> 01:57:51,823
[SPEAKER_09]: That show was the shit.

1731
01:58:07,848 --> 01:58:11,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's turning this shade of red I've never seen before from laughing so hard at that.

1732
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:14,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, okay, DCB, I've got a challenge for you.

1733
01:58:14,532 --> 01:58:20,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, DCB, if you do this, I swear to God, we'll put it in a cage match, we will get it in rotation somehow.

1734
01:58:20,815 --> 01:58:26,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to do a remix that somehow involves the old school, you can't do that on television theme.

1735
01:58:28,379 --> 01:58:29,220
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can do that...

1736
01:58:30,465 --> 01:58:32,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll, like, give Sweet Lovin' to you or something.

1737
01:58:32,406 --> 01:58:33,187
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be just awesome.

1738
01:58:33,227 --> 01:58:33,587
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be rad.

1739
01:58:33,607 --> 01:58:36,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to have samples from... You have to have samples.

1740
01:58:37,069 --> 01:58:37,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, what's that guy?

1741
01:58:41,792 --> 01:58:42,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Alistair?

1742
01:58:44,614 --> 01:58:44,874
[SPEAKER_18]: J.D.

1743
01:58:44,914 --> 01:58:45,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross?

1744
01:58:45,194 --> 01:58:45,514
[SPEAKER_06]: J.D.

1745
01:58:45,554 --> 01:58:45,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross.

1746
01:58:45,754 --> 01:58:46,435
[SPEAKER_06]: You need J.D.

1747
01:58:46,495 --> 01:58:48,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross clips in that song.

1748
01:58:48,916 --> 01:58:51,638
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I want someone to do a remix of the She-Ra theme.

1749
01:58:54,139 --> 01:58:55,340
[SPEAKER_18]: I can even send you the song.

1750
01:58:57,144 --> 01:58:58,745
[SPEAKER_04]: DCB says this before his time.

1751
01:58:58,825 --> 01:58:59,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit.

1752
01:59:00,446 --> 01:59:01,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't care.

1753
01:59:01,426 --> 01:59:02,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Just find it.

1754
01:59:02,307 --> 01:59:05,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Find an old episode of Kazan, watch it, because it was the fucking shit.

1755
01:59:05,689 --> 01:59:13,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to play a DCB remix, Freshness in India, and then we're going to play something from Joe Mama called... I don't have my files queued up.

1756
01:59:13,893 --> 01:59:14,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me look.

1757
01:59:14,453 --> 01:59:15,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's a cool song.

1758
01:59:16,554 --> 01:59:18,455
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's called Messy Closet.

1759
01:59:18,475 --> 01:59:20,196
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're going to play from Joe Mama.

1760
01:59:20,536 --> 01:59:21,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll play something from Loki.

1761
01:59:22,477 --> 01:59:23,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what Loki songs I have.

1762
01:59:23,838 --> 01:59:24,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1763
01:59:24,578 --> 01:59:26,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Is any of these yours, Loki?

1764
01:59:27,404 --> 01:59:27,644
[SPEAKER_04]: ShadowStyle

1765
01:59:57,704 --> 01:59:58,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so here we go.

1766
01:59:58,765 --> 02:00:00,006
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back on Orange Lounge Radio.

1767
02:00:53,755 --> 02:00:57,139
Thank you for watching!

1768
02:01:54,551 --> 02:01:55,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1769
02:02:38,204 --> 02:02:41,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that was Freshness in India by DCB.

1770
02:02:41,146 --> 02:02:44,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Here comes Joe Mama with Messy Closet.

1771
02:03:18,657 --> 02:03:20,283
Thanks for watching!

1772
02:05:10,849 --> 02:05:14,994
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that was Joe Mama with Messy Closet.

1773
02:05:15,034 --> 02:05:16,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're going to do a Loki original.

1774
02:05:16,635 --> 02:05:17,897
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Shadow Style.

1775
02:07:39,571 --> 02:07:44,474
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey there, it's your point of Megaskin, warning you to listen to Orange Wild every Sunday.

1776
02:07:52,058 --> 02:08:02,463
[SPEAKER_25]: Not just because it's the best eeeee money radio out there, but because if you don't, I will personally come to your house and do a nori nori nori routine.

1777
02:08:02,823 --> 02:08:05,685
[SPEAKER_25]: And believe me, nobody wants to see that.

1778
02:08:10,086 --> 02:08:22,795
[SPEAKER_23]: So remember, listen to Orange Lounge, because I don't want to have to have anyone suffer through this.

1779
02:08:22,895 --> 02:08:32,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, yes, we're back.

1780
02:08:32,702 --> 02:08:33,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to suffer through that.

1781
02:08:34,163 --> 02:08:34,723
[SPEAKER_04]: There, I did it.

1782
02:08:34,783 --> 02:08:38,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to make the promo play loud enough so we could all actually hear it, so I hope you enjoyed that.

1783
02:08:38,526 --> 02:08:38,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Squee.

1784
02:08:39,367 --> 02:08:39,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Squee.

1785
02:08:41,998 --> 02:08:42,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1786
02:08:43,979 --> 02:08:46,540
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a list list soon, but we've got to prepare our list.

1787
02:08:46,580 --> 02:08:49,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got to hold off on that for a little bit.

1788
02:08:49,601 --> 02:08:52,221
[SPEAKER_04]: But it will be the top three things that ruined the internet.

1789
02:08:52,381 --> 02:08:53,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be talking about that later.

1790
02:08:55,802 --> 02:08:56,943
[SPEAKER_04]: But now, let's see.

1791
02:08:56,983 --> 02:08:57,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have any other topics?

1792
02:08:58,143 --> 02:08:59,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we need to announce the cage match winner.

1793
02:09:00,004 --> 02:09:01,004
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one thing we need to talk about.

1794
02:09:02,604 --> 02:09:03,185
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1795
02:09:04,025 --> 02:09:04,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1796
02:09:05,345 --> 02:09:08,286
[SPEAKER_04]: The song that will be in rotation all next week.

1797
02:09:08,366 --> 02:09:10,387
[SPEAKER_04]: The winner, ladies and gentlemen...

1798
02:09:11,696 --> 02:09:19,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Two weeks in a row, the Knight Rider theme has won the Orange Lounge game match.

1799
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:24,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I will knock the Knight Rider theme down next week.

1800
02:09:25,402 --> 02:09:27,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark my words, it'll be gone.

1801
02:09:27,423 --> 02:09:30,804
[SPEAKER_09]: You wish.

1802
02:09:33,112 --> 02:09:35,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we do have a rule, though, that how many weeks do we say?

1803
02:09:35,875 --> 02:09:36,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Four weeks?

1804
02:09:36,915 --> 02:09:37,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Month.

1805
02:09:37,476 --> 02:09:37,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a month.

1806
02:09:38,177 --> 02:09:40,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the song can't be in for more than a month, or it's gone.

1807
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:41,319
[SPEAKER_04]: We retire it.

1808
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:47,345
[SPEAKER_04]: We get Carson Daly out here to retire your song from Total Orange Request Live.

1809
02:09:51,255 --> 02:09:54,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week it'll be Tom Green's Piggy Hill.

1810
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:57,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna throw the piggy down the hill.

1811
02:09:58,644 --> 02:10:00,286
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna throw the piggy down.

1812
02:10:00,366 --> 02:10:01,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna throw the piggy down.

1813
02:10:02,028 --> 02:10:03,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna throw the piggy down the hill.

1814
02:10:03,810 --> 02:10:04,751
[SPEAKER_06]: That for about five minutes.

1815
02:10:05,492 --> 02:10:08,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just gonna trump all you fuckers and put in the legend.

1816
02:10:10,598 --> 02:10:11,598
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1817
02:10:40,276 --> 02:10:40,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Skillfully done.

1818
02:10:41,257 --> 02:10:42,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm no match for Brad.

1819
02:10:44,499 --> 02:10:47,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you preparing your list for listless now while I'm just sitting here ranting?

1820
02:10:47,382 --> 02:10:47,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1821
02:10:47,862 --> 02:10:48,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

1822
02:10:48,623 --> 02:10:50,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we won't have to take another break.

1823
02:10:50,504 --> 02:10:51,905
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just be able to go right into lists.

1824
02:10:51,945 --> 02:10:52,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to think about mine.

1825
02:10:53,306 --> 02:10:57,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's play one song while we prepare our list, shall we?

1826
02:10:58,130 --> 02:10:59,211
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll play one quick song.

1827
02:10:59,751 --> 02:11:01,433
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be something fun.

1828
02:11:01,513 --> 02:11:01,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1829
02:11:03,194 --> 02:11:04,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Instant love.

1830
02:11:04,775 --> 02:11:06,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, everybody loves instant love.

1831
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:09,800
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.

1832
02:11:10,721 --> 02:11:12,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll be right back with the list list.

1833
02:11:12,842 --> 02:11:14,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Top three things that ruined the internet right after this.

1834
02:11:18,885 --> 02:11:21,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey everyone, this is DJ Konami.

1835
02:11:22,948 --> 02:11:27,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you all know Beatmania, but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

1836
02:11:28,211 --> 02:11:30,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen carefully and try to follow.

1837
02:11:31,693 --> 02:11:33,734
[SPEAKER_13]: The objects will come down from the top.

1838
02:11:34,094 --> 02:11:35,315
[SPEAKER_13]: When it hits the red line,

1839
02:11:41,191 --> 02:11:42,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Turn the table!

1840
02:11:42,656 --> 02:11:43,419
[SPEAKER_13]: You get it?

1841
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:45,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's practice!

1842
02:12:16,138 --> 02:12:16,398
Easy, huh?

1843
02:12:16,418 --> 02:12:18,740
Alright, let's go on to the scratch stage.

1844
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:21,262
When the objects reach the red line, scratch!

1845
02:12:21,362 --> 02:12:24,143
With a fast note, the technique is to scratch fast.

1846
02:12:53,130 --> 02:12:54,112
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

1847
02:14:05,047 --> 02:14:10,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it Hello, we're back

1848
02:14:32,253 --> 02:14:33,093
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1849
02:15:03,189 --> 02:15:04,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, we shall see.

1850
02:15:04,450 --> 02:15:05,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, go get the door.

1851
02:15:05,091 --> 02:15:06,732
[SPEAKER_15]: I bought some fun music.

1852
02:15:06,772 --> 02:15:07,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know you did.

1853
02:15:07,633 --> 02:15:08,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw some things that we could do.

1854
02:15:08,934 --> 02:15:10,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, am I looking in the cookie?

1855
02:15:10,355 --> 02:15:11,416
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm looking in the wrong directory.

1856
02:15:12,857 --> 02:15:18,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you had... Oh, Dave's parents are here already, I guess.

1857
02:15:18,242 --> 02:15:19,242
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh-oh.

1858
02:15:21,724 --> 02:15:22,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, they're pulling Dave away from us.

1859
02:15:22,685 --> 02:15:23,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, they're pulling Dave away.

1860
02:15:23,606 --> 02:15:24,667
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we going to do about Listless?

1861
02:15:27,749 --> 02:15:28,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1862
02:15:28,070 --> 02:15:28,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1863
02:15:29,721 --> 02:15:31,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell him to leave his list here, because we've got to do his list.

1864
02:15:32,203 --> 02:15:32,783
[SPEAKER_18]: His list is here.

1865
02:15:33,143 --> 02:15:33,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Is his list still here?

1866
02:15:35,405 --> 02:15:37,146
[SPEAKER_18]: His list is here.

1867
02:15:37,506 --> 02:15:40,548
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll have a person from our chatroom vote for our song.

1868
02:15:41,448 --> 02:15:43,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we'll have a person from the chatroom vote for the song.

1869
02:15:43,469 --> 02:15:46,331
[SPEAKER_18]: Or maybe we'll just all pile together and see which one we all agree on.

1870
02:15:46,351 --> 02:15:47,912
[SPEAKER_18]: We could have a person... No, he's still here.

1871
02:15:48,092 --> 02:15:48,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's still here.

1872
02:15:52,935 --> 02:15:54,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just read my top three real quick?

1873
02:15:55,576 --> 02:15:56,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to eliminate one?

1874
02:15:57,284 --> 02:15:57,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Chainletters

1875
02:16:23,811 --> 02:16:25,335
[SPEAKER_05]: and points I should say.

1876
02:16:26,879 --> 02:16:27,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say that.

1877
02:16:28,964 --> 02:16:29,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say it later.

1878
02:16:29,846 --> 02:16:30,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1879
02:16:32,152 --> 02:16:32,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And I gotta go.

1880
02:16:35,989 --> 02:16:36,369
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye!

1881
02:16:36,469 --> 02:16:40,011
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, he took one of mine.

1882
02:16:43,213 --> 02:16:43,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, Dave.

1883
02:16:44,033 --> 02:16:49,816
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna make a special surprise phone call to one of our listeners to have them pick something to eliminate off the list.

1884
02:16:49,836 --> 02:16:50,436
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do that later.

1885
02:16:51,076 --> 02:16:52,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't start sending me your phone numbers.

1886
02:16:52,877 --> 02:16:55,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I already have the person picked out that we're gonna call, so just shut up.

1887
02:16:55,799 --> 02:16:58,300
[SPEAKER_16]: I still have to think of the number, too, because he took mine.

1888
02:16:59,545 --> 02:17:01,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll read those again.

1889
02:17:01,927 --> 02:17:06,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Dave's parents gone so I can read some of these?

1890
02:17:06,750 --> 02:17:08,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you poke your head out the door please real fast, Matt?

1891
02:17:09,151 --> 02:17:09,692
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gone.

1892
02:17:11,213 --> 02:17:12,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Those top three once again from Dave.

1893
02:17:12,834 --> 02:17:21,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Random people who instant message you, chain letters, and porn sites that say that they're free but they really aren't.

1894
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:23,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in case you missed those.

1895
02:17:23,201 --> 02:17:26,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so now let's get back to the three of us here.

1896
02:17:27,484 --> 02:17:28,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Boots my inserts on, my bad.

1897
02:17:32,555 --> 02:17:33,696
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Jamie.

1898
02:17:34,236 --> 02:17:34,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three.

1899
02:17:34,697 --> 02:17:36,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Your number three choice, please.

1900
02:17:36,698 --> 02:17:37,279
[SPEAKER_18]: Microsoft.

1901
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:40,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft ruined the Internet.

1902
02:17:40,461 --> 02:17:49,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, because of all their, you know, the MSM you can't delete from your computer and all of their little sending them all your crap.

1903
02:17:50,630 --> 02:17:51,891
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess I should say spyware.

1904
02:17:53,372 --> 02:17:54,713
[SPEAKER_18]: But Microsoft in particular.

1905
02:17:55,293 --> 02:17:55,654
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1906
02:17:56,875 --> 02:17:59,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft in particular ruined the Internet.

1907
02:17:59,397 --> 02:18:00,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, Loki.

1908
02:18:00,438 --> 02:18:01,378
[SPEAKER_04]: What ruined the Internet?

1909
02:18:01,538 --> 02:18:01,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three.

1910
02:18:03,446 --> 02:18:07,008
[SPEAKER_06]: 40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women.

1911
02:18:08,489 --> 02:18:15,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Could I have a funny story about... 40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women.

1912
02:18:15,372 --> 02:18:16,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please tell your story.

1913
02:18:17,093 --> 02:18:18,214
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1914
02:18:18,414 --> 02:18:20,595
[SPEAKER_18]: This is when my fiancé had just gotten online.

1915
02:18:20,615 --> 02:18:22,916
[SPEAKER_18]: He was using my friend Julie's account, and she had a catwoman name.

1916
02:18:24,617 --> 02:18:30,020
[SPEAKER_18]: And this guy propositioned him, thinking it was a woman for sex.

1917
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:31,261
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, like cyber...

1918
02:18:32,034 --> 02:18:37,396
[SPEAKER_18]: So what they did is they ended up taking him into the IM and talking about power tools the whole time.

1919
02:18:37,856 --> 02:18:39,897
[SPEAKER_18]: The guy's like, so what do you want to do first?

1920
02:18:40,097 --> 02:18:44,138
[SPEAKER_18]: And Dan replies, I have a circular saw.

1921
02:18:44,219 --> 02:18:45,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you like jigsaws?

1922
02:18:46,459 --> 02:18:47,820
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a reciprocating saw.

1923
02:18:49,260 --> 02:18:49,841
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole time.

1924
02:18:51,141 --> 02:18:52,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he ever saw that he was being duped?

1925
02:18:53,882 --> 02:18:56,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Cybersex is funny because it's so pointless.

1926
02:18:57,884 --> 02:18:58,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1927
02:18:59,818 --> 02:19:00,118
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1928
02:19:02,260 --> 02:19:02,580
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1929
02:19:03,041 --> 02:19:03,441
[SPEAKER_04]: My turn.

1930
02:19:04,842 --> 02:19:05,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm eating.

1931
02:19:06,183 --> 02:19:11,588
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three choice, as tempting as it was to put some popular websites, you know, DDR Freak, things like that.

1932
02:19:11,748 --> 02:19:12,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just teasing.

1933
02:19:12,188 --> 02:19:12,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just teasing.

1934
02:19:14,170 --> 02:19:20,055
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three pick was another website that I believe ruined the Internet, and that website is GeoCities.

1935
02:19:22,576 --> 02:19:27,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that Geocities ruined the internet by allowing any dumb fuck to have a homepage.

1936
02:19:27,940 --> 02:19:29,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people should not have webpages.

1937
02:19:30,082 --> 02:19:32,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Geocities pages are cool, admittedly.

1938
02:19:32,924 --> 02:19:37,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Although the banners fucked them up, you know, their little pop-up thing that they have on the right.

1939
02:19:37,287 --> 02:19:38,188
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Bads?

1940
02:19:39,429 --> 02:19:40,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know, I know.

1941
02:19:40,450 --> 02:19:41,911
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some cool things on Geocities.

1942
02:19:42,872 --> 02:19:43,492
[SPEAKER_04]: But 98% of it is shit.

1943
02:19:46,155 --> 02:19:52,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fuckin' sorority girls that put up pretty pink webpages with dancing pictures of doggies and pictures of their cat.

1944
02:19:52,782 --> 02:19:53,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody gives a shit.

1945
02:19:53,643 --> 02:20:00,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Like my other website, uh, Loki's Insan- or was it, uh, uh, Sensory Deprivation.

1946
02:20:00,130 --> 02:20:00,510
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1947
02:20:01,131 --> 02:20:02,072
[SPEAKER_06]: A site I don't update.

1948
02:20:02,512 --> 02:20:02,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck it.

1949
02:20:02,793 --> 02:20:03,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Find it if you can.

1950
02:20:03,634 --> 02:20:04,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

1951
02:20:04,114 --> 02:20:05,275
[SPEAKER_04]: GeoCity's ruined the internet.

1952
02:20:07,017 --> 02:20:07,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie!

1953
02:20:08,717 --> 02:20:09,777
[SPEAKER_21]: Your number two pick, please.

1954
02:20:10,117 --> 02:20:10,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Bad fandom.

1955
02:20:11,878 --> 02:20:17,879
[SPEAKER_18]: As in people who write fanfics and do fanart that I don't agree with.

1956
02:20:17,919 --> 02:20:19,779
[SPEAKER_18]: For lack of a better description.

1957
02:20:21,140 --> 02:20:25,580
[SPEAKER_18]: Like people who do crossover fanfics.

1958
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:30,962
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not talking about good crossovers, but people who do really bad ones.

1959
02:20:31,342 --> 02:20:33,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Like things that could not ever happen.

1960
02:20:35,202 --> 02:20:37,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, I write fanfiction, that's fine.

1961
02:20:40,202 --> 02:20:42,584
[SPEAKER_18]: The Internet is a haven for bad writers.

1962
02:20:43,464 --> 02:20:47,067
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a haven for good writers, too, but you really have to look through a lot of shit to find it.

1963
02:20:47,327 --> 02:20:53,592
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's people who put up their art, and they obviously haven't spent any time practicing.

1964
02:20:53,772 --> 02:21:00,717
[SPEAKER_18]: And I understand if maybe you're learning and you're improving, but I've seen slides of people whose art gets continuously worse.

1965
02:21:01,177 --> 02:21:02,598
[SPEAKER_18]: And then they IM me.

1966
02:21:03,619 --> 02:21:05,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for watching!

1967
02:21:20,810 --> 02:21:25,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to GeoCities, because DarkTetsuya wanted to point out that his website's on GeoCities.

1968
02:21:26,175 --> 02:21:27,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, you're part of that cool 2%.

1969
02:21:28,337 --> 02:21:28,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.

1970
02:21:29,438 --> 02:21:32,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying 98% of the GeoCities webpages, they're ass.

1971
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:34,222
[SPEAKER_18]: But compared to what you have now, was it ass?

1972
02:21:40,667 --> 02:21:42,788
[SPEAKER_18]: It was actually decent for... For it's time.

1973
02:21:42,828 --> 02:21:43,709
[SPEAKER_04]: It was ahead of it's time.

1974
02:21:43,749 --> 02:21:45,730
[SPEAKER_18]: For a HTML done in WordPad.

1975
02:21:46,130 --> 02:21:46,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1976
02:21:46,610 --> 02:21:46,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1977
02:21:46,970 --> 02:21:47,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1978
02:21:47,491 --> 02:21:49,112
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you didn't use that auto-generator.

1979
02:21:49,132 --> 02:21:49,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, alright.

1980
02:21:50,212 --> 02:21:50,732
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cool then.

1981
02:21:51,113 --> 02:21:51,913
[SPEAKER_18]: That is bullshit.

1982
02:21:51,933 --> 02:21:53,014
[SPEAKER_18]: I either use that or Dreamweaver.

1983
02:21:53,154 --> 02:21:53,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1984
02:21:53,454 --> 02:21:53,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1985
02:21:54,014 --> 02:21:54,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Good girl.

1986
02:21:54,534 --> 02:21:54,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1987
02:21:55,675 --> 02:21:56,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we had Bad Fandom.

1988
02:21:58,857 --> 02:22:00,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And now Loki's number two pit.

1989
02:22:00,237 --> 02:22:00,697
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?

1990
02:22:01,778 --> 02:22:05,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... I guess I can go with... Okay, fine.

1991
02:22:05,060 --> 02:22:05,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1992
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:07,201
[SPEAKER_06]: The lack of e-prostitutes.

1993
02:22:07,721 --> 02:22:09,262
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy everything online but women.

1994
02:22:12,082 --> 02:22:14,872
[SPEAKER_18]: you can buy a wife you can buy a wife

1995
02:22:15,933 --> 02:22:16,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want a wife.

1996
02:22:16,954 --> 02:22:17,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1997
02:22:18,455 --> 02:22:19,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1998
02:22:19,716 --> 02:22:20,876
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to research this now.

1999
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:30,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, you can get a mail order bride.

2000
02:22:31,103 --> 02:22:36,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking up our old friends from, oh, I guess, is this it?

2001
02:22:36,447 --> 02:22:37,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is it.

2002
02:22:37,587 --> 02:22:40,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking up our old friends at the Bunny Ranch from Under Sedation Live.

2003
02:22:40,509 --> 02:22:41,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to find their website.

2004
02:22:42,551 --> 02:22:45,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm trying to see if we can see, ah, easy online reservations.

2005
02:22:46,493 --> 02:22:47,834
[SPEAKER_16]: You can get a prostitute online.

2006
02:22:47,854 --> 02:22:50,655
[SPEAKER_04]: You can reserve a prostitute on the internet.

2007
02:22:51,776 --> 02:22:52,616
[SPEAKER_06]: That's different.

2008
02:22:52,636 --> 02:22:54,657
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just like making a reservation at a hotel.

2009
02:22:54,677 --> 02:22:57,519
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not buying the friggin' hotel and having that hotel shipped to your house.

2010
02:22:57,599 --> 02:22:58,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, alright, alright, alright.

2011
02:22:59,360 --> 02:23:01,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want a site that's actually going to ship a woman to your house?

2012
02:23:01,721 --> 02:23:03,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Goddammit, I'm getting all these pop-up ads.

2013
02:23:03,862 --> 02:23:05,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Those bastards.

2014
02:23:05,683 --> 02:23:07,444
[SPEAKER_06]: No, like, you know, something like, um...

2015
02:23:07,924 --> 02:23:11,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, um, like, uh, Red Octane, you know?

2016
02:23:11,385 --> 02:23:16,227
[SPEAKER_06]: You pay... Are you comparing Red Octane to prostitution?

2017
02:23:16,627 --> 02:23:17,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it could be, okay?

2018
02:23:18,268 --> 02:23:25,291
[SPEAKER_06]: You pay a certain amount of money for, like, a monthly fee, they send a woman to your house with a shipping label, you know, when you're down a third and then you ship her off back.

2019
02:23:26,151 --> 02:23:32,674
[SPEAKER_18]: The site you're looking for is called realdolls.com Oh my god.

2020
02:23:33,809 --> 02:23:35,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually sit in the same room with you every Sunday.

2021
02:23:36,975 --> 02:23:39,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my number two pick for thing that ruined the internet.

2022
02:23:40,361 --> 02:23:41,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, this is a good one.

2023
02:23:43,086 --> 02:23:44,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two thing that ruined the internet.

2024
02:23:45,650 --> 02:23:46,131
[SPEAKER_04]: ICQ.

2025
02:23:50,985 --> 02:23:54,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I... ICQ back in the day was alright.

2026
02:23:54,826 --> 02:23:59,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was one of the first instant messaging programs before, like, cool ones like Yahoo showed up.

2027
02:23:59,788 --> 02:24:05,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And AOL, even though AOL's kind of crappy now, AOL Instant Messenger's still cool.

2028
02:24:07,291 --> 02:24:10,713
[SPEAKER_04]: But ICQ is like the shithole of IMs.

2029
02:24:10,773 --> 02:24:11,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like...

2030
02:24:12,196 --> 02:24:16,860
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the program that people who don't know how to use any other instant messenger program use.

2031
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:18,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot stand ICQ.

2032
02:24:18,881 --> 02:24:19,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the weirdest...

2033
02:24:20,994 --> 02:24:22,495
[SPEAKER_04]: messages from people on ICQ.

2034
02:24:22,595 --> 02:24:26,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't use ICQ anymore because of random people on ICQ.

2035
02:24:26,576 --> 02:24:35,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if I have one more, like, 16-year-old woman from Brazil emailing me over ICQ wanting me to go to some website to see her boobs, I'm gonna scream.

2036
02:24:36,019 --> 02:24:37,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I need to get on ICQ.

2037
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:45,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, ICQ constantly sends you ads, and now it's all, like, added out and stuff, and they sold it out to the man.

2038
02:24:47,282 --> 02:24:49,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever since ICQ sold out, they've sucked.

2039
02:24:49,603 --> 02:24:51,143
[SPEAKER_04]: ICQ ruined the internet.

2040
02:24:52,304 --> 02:24:53,924
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I have my number one.

2041
02:24:54,044 --> 02:24:58,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's hear DarkSakura's number one thing that ruined the internet.

2042
02:24:58,525 --> 02:24:59,386
[SPEAKER_18]: Lazy typing.

2043
02:25:00,166 --> 02:25:03,367
[SPEAKER_18]: As in people who use the letter U instead of writing Y-O-U.

2044
02:25:04,487 --> 02:25:05,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Lazy typing.

2045
02:25:05,868 --> 02:25:07,648
[SPEAKER_18]: Or P-L-Z for please.

2046
02:25:08,969 --> 02:25:10,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Or, you know...

2047
02:25:11,678 --> 02:25:16,839
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't mind Lee, but I've also put for the lazy writing too, I want to add in Asian typing too.

2048
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:23,501
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't mind Lee, but I really, really hate all the rest of it.

2049
02:25:23,821 --> 02:25:25,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it makes people look ignorant, okay?

2050
02:25:26,242 --> 02:25:30,803
[SPEAKER_18]: There are people who, they start typing that way to me, I'll be like, type English, you know?

2051
02:25:32,605 --> 02:25:33,746
[SPEAKER_18]: I will completely ignore them.

2052
02:25:33,926 --> 02:25:38,047
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be like, I'm sorry, but I wasn't aware that the letter U stands alone as its own word.

2053
02:25:38,887 --> 02:25:42,709
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I'll go check it on dictionary.com and post them a link and everything.

2054
02:25:42,869 --> 02:25:43,709
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I hate it.

2055
02:25:45,430 --> 02:25:48,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so lazy and Asian typing.

2056
02:25:48,951 --> 02:25:52,652
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that's funny because it's very similar to my number one, but I think my number one's a little different.

2057
02:25:52,712 --> 02:25:53,433
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different enough.

2058
02:25:54,293 --> 02:25:57,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, your number one thing that ruined the internet.

2059
02:25:57,374 --> 02:25:58,254
[SPEAKER_04]: He's already laughing.

2060
02:25:59,555 --> 02:26:00,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Mac users.

2061
02:26:02,847 --> 02:26:03,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't leave it at that.

2062
02:26:05,388 --> 02:26:06,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

2063
02:26:09,289 --> 02:26:10,589
[SPEAKER_04]: You care to back that up?

2064
02:26:10,629 --> 02:26:13,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think somebody's going to have a severe problem with this.

2065
02:26:13,270 --> 02:26:15,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I kind of wanted to change one of mine on there.

2066
02:26:16,110 --> 02:26:17,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we can go back in a little bit.

2067
02:26:18,191 --> 02:26:18,591
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2068
02:26:18,611 --> 02:26:21,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you want to kind of back up your answer a little bit here?

2069
02:26:21,792 --> 02:26:23,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Why Mac users ruin the Internet?

2070
02:26:24,062 --> 02:26:24,542
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2071
02:26:46,374 --> 02:26:48,037
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually rethought my Bad Fandom one.

2072
02:26:48,057 --> 02:26:48,578
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

2073
02:26:48,598 --> 02:26:49,119
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to change that?

2074
02:26:49,139 --> 02:26:50,782
[SPEAKER_18]: Because everyone has to start somewhere.

2075
02:26:51,623 --> 02:26:54,207
[SPEAKER_18]: And Bad Fandom just encourages people to go look for the good stuff.

2076
02:26:54,247 --> 02:26:54,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2077
02:26:54,508 --> 02:26:55,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

2078
02:26:55,409 --> 02:26:57,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually going to take that off the list anyway.

2079
02:26:57,272 --> 02:26:58,835
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to change it to Pop-Up Ads.

2080
02:26:59,055 --> 02:26:59,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop-Up Ads.

2081
02:26:59,676 --> 02:26:59,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2082
02:27:02,426 --> 02:27:04,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Because pop-up ads need to be on there.

2083
02:27:04,067 --> 02:27:05,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're getting rid of bad fandom and putting on pop-up ads.

2084
02:27:05,528 --> 02:27:08,209
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to need the negative to encourage people to look for the positive.

2085
02:27:08,349 --> 02:27:09,630
[SPEAKER_18]: And everybody had to start somewhere.

2086
02:27:09,930 --> 02:27:11,791
[SPEAKER_18]: So I retract it and apologize.

2087
02:27:12,311 --> 02:27:12,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2088
02:27:13,812 --> 02:27:15,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lab's having a fit in the chat room.

2089
02:27:15,813 --> 02:27:16,214
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

2090
02:27:16,354 --> 02:27:16,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2091
02:27:16,814 --> 02:27:17,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that on purpose.

2092
02:27:17,794 --> 02:27:19,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you did it on purpose just to piss them off?

2093
02:27:21,196 --> 02:27:21,476
[SPEAKER_04]: You go.

2094
02:27:21,496 --> 02:27:22,117
[SPEAKER_04]: You ass.

2095
02:27:23,678 --> 02:27:24,238
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cool.

2096
02:27:24,738 --> 02:27:25,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't have a third one.

2097
02:27:26,179 --> 02:27:29,621
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, by the way, we might have a special in-studio guest Black Lab here next week.

2098
02:27:30,146 --> 02:27:31,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just kidding, Black Lab.

2099
02:27:31,486 --> 02:27:34,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm taking it off as my pick to remove from the list.

2100
02:27:34,427 --> 02:27:35,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, alright, alright.

2101
02:27:35,487 --> 02:27:36,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

2102
02:27:36,047 --> 02:27:37,167
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to that later.

2103
02:27:37,187 --> 02:27:37,847
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to that later.

2104
02:27:37,887 --> 02:27:38,847
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to that later.

2105
02:27:39,068 --> 02:27:39,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I read number one?

2106
02:27:40,088 --> 02:27:41,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I do my number one thing now?

2107
02:27:41,528 --> 02:27:41,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2108
02:27:42,328 --> 02:27:44,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one thing that ruined the internet, in my opinion.

2109
02:27:45,249 --> 02:27:46,309
[SPEAKER_04]: The caps lock key.

2110
02:27:48,129 --> 02:27:49,129
[SPEAKER_18]: God, yes.

2111
02:27:51,730 --> 02:27:52,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, where's my music?

2112
02:27:53,370 --> 02:27:53,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2113
02:27:54,730 --> 02:27:56,610
[SPEAKER_04]: The caps lock key ruined the internet.

2114
02:27:57,611 --> 02:27:59,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ever use it.

2115
02:27:59,511 --> 02:27:59,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever.

2116
02:28:00,515 --> 02:28:03,779
[SPEAKER_04]: The only time you can use it is if you're me and you're doing the listless segment.

2117
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:05,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm doing right now.

2118
02:28:06,102 --> 02:28:08,685
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only time you can ever use the cap slot key.

2119
02:28:09,947 --> 02:28:11,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, use shift.

2120
02:28:11,589 --> 02:28:13,571
[SPEAKER_04]: That way you don't type in all caps.

2121
02:28:13,952 --> 02:28:14,712
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I hate?

2122
02:28:14,732 --> 02:28:19,038
[SPEAKER_04]: If I see one more person at my work typing caps, I'm gonna cry.

2123
02:28:19,751 --> 02:28:24,573
[SPEAKER_06]: You can change mine if you want for Mac users to MIDI music that plays when you go to webpages.

2124
02:28:25,353 --> 02:28:27,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we're changing Mac users now?

2125
02:28:27,134 --> 02:28:27,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez.

2126
02:28:27,674 --> 02:28:33,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Except my old DarkSakura page has MIDI's that play, but that was because at the time I thought it was cool.

2127
02:28:33,696 --> 02:28:36,257
[SPEAKER_18]: GeoCities, by the way, will not let me take down that page.

2128
02:28:38,018 --> 02:28:39,699
[SPEAKER_18]: It's still up there, my old DarkSakura page.

2129
02:28:40,039 --> 02:28:40,540
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

2130
02:28:40,580 --> 02:28:41,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Why won't they let you take it down?

2131
02:28:41,881 --> 02:28:42,701
[SPEAKER_18]: I have no idea.

2132
02:28:42,721 --> 02:28:43,322
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't.

2133
02:28:43,762 --> 02:28:50,147
[SPEAKER_18]: It was actually after GeoCities and Yahoo did their little, you know, they screwed and, you know, spawned something.

2134
02:28:51,008 --> 02:28:52,689
[SPEAKER_18]: So I haven't been able to log into my old accounts.

2135
02:28:53,493 --> 02:28:56,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, notice all the commercials for Yahoo.

2136
02:28:56,395 --> 02:29:01,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they promote Yahoo as a meeting place for, like, the scum of the earth.

2137
02:29:02,078 --> 02:29:06,981
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got, like, the dating ad with people with big hands and that really ugly chick that's an astronaut.

2138
02:29:07,001 --> 02:29:10,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they just show ugly, nasty people that are on Yahoo.

2139
02:29:10,803 --> 02:29:12,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Who'd want to be on Yahoo with all these freaks?

2140
02:29:13,485 --> 02:29:14,866
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're saying Yahoo ruined the internet?

2141
02:29:16,266 --> 02:29:20,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Yahoo... Internet commercials ruin the internet, okay?

2142
02:29:21,112 --> 02:29:22,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Too late, we have our list.

2143
02:29:22,174 --> 02:29:22,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's read the list.

2144
02:29:22,915 --> 02:29:23,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2145
02:29:23,976 --> 02:29:25,698
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the list as it stands currently.

2146
02:29:25,818 --> 02:29:27,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Random people who IM you.

2147
02:29:27,821 --> 02:29:28,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Chain letters.

2148
02:29:29,182 --> 02:29:31,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn sites that say they're free but really not.

2149
02:29:31,806 --> 02:29:32,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft.

2150
02:29:32,807 --> 02:29:46,814
[SPEAKER_04]: 40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women, GeoCities, pop-up ads, lack of e-prostitutes, ICQ, lazy typing or Asian typing, MIDI music that plays when you go to websites, and the caps lock key.

2151
02:29:47,315 --> 02:29:51,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that all being said, Jamie, what is coming off this list?

2152
02:29:52,037 --> 02:29:52,918
[SPEAKER_04]: What ain't so bad?

2153
02:29:53,078 --> 02:29:54,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Lack of e-prostitutes.

2154
02:29:54,499 --> 02:29:56,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Lack of e-prostitutes.

2155
02:29:56,199 --> 02:29:58,461
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I don't really give a care about sluts.

2156
02:30:01,101 --> 02:30:04,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anything else you want to say with that, or just, you don't like sluts?

2157
02:30:05,464 --> 02:30:06,264
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't like sluts.

2158
02:30:06,764 --> 02:30:09,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm getting an early vote already, it is not time to vote.

2159
02:30:10,326 --> 02:30:11,867
[SPEAKER_04]: DCB, your vote doesn't count.

2160
02:30:13,348 --> 02:30:16,490
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to wait, because that thing you voted for might come up.

2161
02:30:16,870 --> 02:30:18,071
[SPEAKER_04]: You get smacked with the ferret.

2162
02:30:20,512 --> 02:30:21,173
[SPEAKER_04]: The ferret's over here.

2163
02:30:21,593 --> 02:30:22,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're doing a slash me.

2164
02:30:26,468 --> 02:30:28,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

2165
02:30:28,769 --> 02:30:29,570
[SPEAKER_04]: She took the keyboard.

2166
02:30:29,850 --> 02:30:34,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have to wait for Jamie to... Alright, I can do mine because I already... Oh, you already know what it is?

2167
02:30:34,653 --> 02:30:35,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2168
02:30:36,074 --> 02:30:43,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine has to go... I'm going to take off the porn sites that say they're free but really aren't because free porn sites are like the Fountain of Youth.

2169
02:30:43,298 --> 02:30:43,999
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't exist.

2170
02:30:50,002 --> 02:30:51,223
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't know where to look.

2171
02:30:52,657 --> 02:30:54,317
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no such thing as free porn sites.

2172
02:30:54,417 --> 02:30:56,878
[SPEAKER_06]: There are back doors to porn sites, which are awesome.

2173
02:30:56,918 --> 02:30:57,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, back doors.

2174
02:30:58,539 --> 02:30:59,779
[SPEAKER_06]: HappyHacker.com.

2175
02:30:59,859 --> 02:31:02,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy-Hacker.com.

2176
02:31:02,260 --> 02:31:03,420
[SPEAKER_06]: PersianKitty.com.

2177
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:05,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe.

2178
02:31:05,801 --> 02:31:07,721
[SPEAKER_06]: DoubleXPassword.com.

2179
02:31:07,841 --> 02:31:08,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, this isn't that good.

2180
02:31:08,901 --> 02:31:10,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Find me some boy porn, man porn.

2181
02:31:10,962 --> 02:31:11,802
[SPEAKER_16]: Find me man porn.

2182
02:31:13,383 --> 02:31:13,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it free?

2183
02:31:13,943 --> 02:31:14,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2184
02:31:19,844 --> 02:31:21,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all boys and boys, though, but anyway.

2185
02:31:23,470 --> 02:31:27,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to have a DVD, but I got rid of it pretty quickly once I got it.

2186
02:31:27,332 --> 02:31:29,453
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of those free Vivid DVDs that they gave me.

2187
02:31:32,094 --> 02:31:35,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get them anymore, but... Alright.

2188
02:31:35,876 --> 02:31:36,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, back to listless.

2189
02:31:36,997 --> 02:31:37,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I gotta take that off.

2190
02:31:37,877 --> 02:31:39,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn sites say they're free, but really not.

2191
02:31:40,999 --> 02:31:41,659
[SPEAKER_04]: That comes off the list.

2192
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:44,261
[SPEAKER_04]: My turn to take something off the list.

2193
02:31:45,321 --> 02:31:48,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take off, um... Hmm...

2194
02:31:51,351 --> 02:31:53,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take off MIDI music that plays when you go to websites.

2195
02:31:54,053 --> 02:31:56,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Because one of my old websites also had a MIDI song to play in the background.

2196
02:31:56,615 --> 02:31:57,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you, they're cool.

2197
02:31:58,236 --> 02:31:59,757
[SPEAKER_18]: Mine played Street Fighter MIDI.

2198
02:31:59,857 --> 02:32:00,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine played Tori Amos.

2199
02:32:02,739 --> 02:32:04,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fine, I should just reiterate.

2200
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:06,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, MIDI music's not that bad.

2201
02:32:07,462 --> 02:32:12,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like it, it's annoying, but I hate the sites that make you download MP3s to get into the site.

2202
02:32:12,285 --> 02:32:13,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree.

2203
02:32:13,186 --> 02:32:13,966
[SPEAKER_06]: That's stupid.

2204
02:32:13,986 --> 02:32:16,388
[SPEAKER_06]: What, is that like a porn thing?

2205
02:32:16,408 --> 02:32:20,230
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of times when someone tries to play MIDI music, all you have to do is hit stop, and it, you know.

2206
02:32:21,511 --> 02:32:22,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that's Good Cool's site.

2207
02:32:23,633 --> 02:32:24,193
[SPEAKER_06]: That does that.

2208
02:32:24,293 --> 02:32:24,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

2209
02:32:24,974 --> 02:32:25,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad Good Cool.

2210
02:32:25,855 --> 02:32:26,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad.

2211
02:32:27,016 --> 02:32:27,296
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

2212
02:32:27,416 --> 02:32:27,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Good Cool.

2213
02:32:28,076 --> 02:32:29,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Ryo Nagumi.

2214
02:32:29,538 --> 02:32:30,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Nagumu.

2215
02:32:30,638 --> 02:32:30,919
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2216
02:32:31,059 --> 02:32:32,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Nagu something.

2217
02:32:32,620 --> 02:32:40,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm going to try this phone thing, and we've all had really bad experiences with this in the past, so I'm going to call someone who I'm pretty confident is listening to the show.

2218
02:32:42,028 --> 02:32:48,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a little upset that Loki took the Mac users thing off the list, because this would have been an exciting telephone conversation if that were the case.

2219
02:32:49,053 --> 02:32:57,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, why don't you get one of those car hookups for your phone, and then you can plug it into the microphone thing here, and then everyone can hear it.

2220
02:32:58,017 --> 02:32:59,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's too easy!

2221
02:33:00,459 --> 02:33:02,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Julie's going to be giving us a real phone hookup.

2222
02:33:02,359 --> 02:33:03,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that's a really good idea.

2223
02:33:03,700 --> 02:33:06,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to be looking into the phone hookup thing, don't worry about it.

2224
02:33:06,802 --> 02:33:09,283
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, we don't have that, so here we go.

2225
02:33:11,824 --> 02:33:13,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me place that phone call here.

2226
02:33:23,726 --> 02:33:28,048
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a lovely building.

2227
02:33:29,008 --> 02:33:30,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Black Lab.

2228
02:33:30,869 --> 02:33:31,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

2229
02:33:31,689 --> 02:33:32,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear us fine?

2230
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:33,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2231
02:33:33,970 --> 02:33:36,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything you want to say to Loki first off?

2232
02:33:37,711 --> 02:33:40,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Loki, screw you, man.

2233
02:33:42,453 --> 02:33:49,895
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were there right now, I'd whip out a whole sheet of information that I could shove in your face and prove you wrong.

2234
02:33:50,176 --> 02:33:51,156
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to defend you.

2235
02:33:52,040 --> 02:33:58,585
[SPEAKER_04]: The cell phone thing sounds like crap, so we can't stay on this too long, but... Do you need me to read the list for you?

2236
02:33:58,625 --> 02:34:00,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you already have something that you want to come off the list?

2237
02:34:04,209 --> 02:34:04,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here it is.

2238
02:34:05,470 --> 02:34:07,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Random people who instant message you.

2239
02:34:08,052 --> 02:34:08,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Chain letters.

2240
02:34:09,593 --> 02:34:11,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft.

2241
02:34:11,434 --> 02:34:13,035
[SPEAKER_04]: 40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women.

2242
02:34:14,486 --> 02:34:22,671
[SPEAKER_04]: GeoCities, PopUp Ads, ICQ, Lazy or Asian Typing, and CapsLockKey.

2243
02:34:24,372 --> 02:34:28,315
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're saying people should stop being lazy and set up an email filter?

2244
02:34:28,335 --> 02:34:28,515
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

2245
02:34:45,500 --> 02:34:47,280
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thanks for participating, Black Lab.

2246
02:34:48,261 --> 02:34:48,581
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2247
02:34:48,821 --> 02:34:49,361
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week.

2248
02:34:49,461 --> 02:34:49,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2249
02:34:51,242 --> 02:34:53,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, Orange Haunts Radio phone call like wood.

2250
02:34:53,022 --> 02:34:56,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised you didn't take off 40-year-old women pretending to be men just to piss me off.

2251
02:34:56,763 --> 02:34:58,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Because everyone else has already eliminated my stuff.

2252
02:34:58,844 --> 02:35:00,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, already taken off your choices?

2253
02:35:00,144 --> 02:35:00,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

2254
02:35:01,305 --> 02:35:04,786
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems to be a popular thing around here is people eliminating your picks.

2255
02:35:04,846 --> 02:35:05,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Go figure.

2256
02:35:07,605 --> 02:35:10,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I just pick random shit, I don't actually answer seriously.

2257
02:35:12,369 --> 02:35:13,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see, are you mocking this segment?

2258
02:35:13,990 --> 02:35:14,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you're doing?

2259
02:35:15,391 --> 02:35:23,357
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just I think it's more entertaining to pick really weird shit instead of actual serious answers because everyone else has the same answers I would have used, so there.

2260
02:35:24,278 --> 02:35:24,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2261
02:35:25,319 --> 02:35:28,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you can vote now during our listless segment.

[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that's not for me.

2276
02:36:10,428 --> 02:36:12,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

2277
02:36:12,449 --> 02:36:15,370
[SPEAKER_04]: We had one come from somebody else listening to the show.

2278

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2296
02:41:45,936 --> 02:41:46,816

[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lab already went home, so he can't join us.

2299
02:41:52,759 --> 02:41:54,320
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, he gets to join us via phone tonight.

2300
02:41:54,640 --> 02:41:56,121
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll be here in person next week, maybe.

2301
02:41:56,961 --> 02:41:57,441
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a maybe.

2302
02:41:57,481 --> 02:42:00,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week, by the way, is going to be the big year-end show.

2303
02:42:01,587 --> 02:42:02,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't lose that much.

2304
02:42:02,828 --> 02:42:04,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have about two liters of Pepsi in me.

2305
02:42:16,690 --> 02:42:19,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe another one for best... For any song that's been released.

2306
02:42:19,432 --> 02:42:20,453
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2002, yes.

2307
02:42:21,054 --> 02:42:23,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Any Bomani song that's been released in 2002.

2308
02:42:23,676 --> 02:42:27,659
[SPEAKER_04]: And we might also do one if we've got time for, like, best thing in the Bomani world for 2002.

2309
02:42:27,699 --> 02:42:36,306
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm also going to do a special pre-show of stuff that was either... Assuming that I have all the files for stuff that was in Second Mix or Beatmania Substream.

2310
02:42:37,067 --> 02:42:37,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Or 2DX Substream.

2311
02:42:39,208 --> 02:42:39,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

2312
02:42:40,129 --> 02:42:40,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Old stuff.

2313
02:42:41,230 --> 02:42:41,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Old school stuff.

2314
02:42:41,850 --> 02:42:43,792
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, maybe go up as far as Second Style.

2315
02:42:44,713 --> 02:42:44,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

2316
02:42:45,353 --> 02:42:46,014
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's going to be old.

2317
02:42:46,610 --> 02:42:46,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Old school.

2318
02:42:48,011 --> 02:42:51,415

2321
02:42:59,943 --> 02:43:02,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, number three, Jamie, what ruined the internet?

2322
02:43:02,966 --> 02:43:03,647
[SPEAKER_17]: Microsoft.

2323
02:43:04,788 --> 02:43:07,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft is a loser.

2324
02:43:08,129 --> 02:43:10,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, what is the number two thing that ruined the internet?

2325

[SPEAKER_18]: Pop-up ads.

2326
02:43:12,975 --> 02:43:14,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop-up ads suck.

2327
02:43:14,658 --> 02:43:15,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to hell.

2328
02:43:15,859 --> 02:43:18,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And the number one thing that ruined the internet?

2329
02:43:19,036 --> 02:43:20,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Lazy typing or AZN typing.

2330
02:43:21,917 --> 02:43:24,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Which I find incredibly funny because they were all my picks.

2331
02:43:24,998 --> 02:43:25,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Were they really?

2332
02:43:25,918 --> 02:43:26,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2333
02:43:28,639 --> 02:43:30,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit, Jamie is the winner today.

2334
02:43:31,480 --> 02:43:33,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there's some other things to get a vote.

2335
02:43:33,701 --> 02:43:36,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And some interesting things that were said in the chat room.

2336
02:43:36,361 --> 02:43:38,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Things we didn't put on the list at all.

2337
02:43:38,722 --> 02:43:42,283
[SPEAKER_04]: EOSFVB suggested that Orange Lounge in fact ruined the internet.

2338
02:43:43,244 --> 02:43:44,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Harry Potter websites.

2339
02:43:48,592 --> 02:43:54,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me, wait a minute, you gave me Alan Rickman movies, so I'm not going to kick you, but I'll hit you with a ferret.

2340
02:43:57,740 --> 02:44:00,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Tetsuya says the ferret ruined the internet.

2341
02:44:05,286 --> 02:44:06,807
[SPEAKER_04]: What else ruined the internet here?

2342
02:44:06,847 --> 02:44:07,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2343
02:44:07,968 --> 02:44:12,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Suggestions, chat room, give me your suggestions for what other things ruined the internet that we forgot to say.

2344
02:44:14,389 --> 02:44:15,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Target.com?

2345
02:44:15,530 --> 02:44:15,910
[SPEAKER_18]: eBay.

2346
02:44:16,551 --> 02:44:17,071
[SPEAKER_04]: eBay.

2347
02:44:17,451 --> 02:44:18,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did eBay ruin the internet?

2348
02:44:18,792 --> 02:44:20,474
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it makes me spend all my money.

2349
02:44:21,715 --> 02:44:25,918
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, Half.com has been taking up more of my money lately because I've been finding laser discs.

2350
02:44:26,358 --> 02:44:28,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a good one would be LiveJournal ruined the internet.

2351
02:44:28,980 --> 02:44:29,981
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I like LiveJournal.

2352
02:44:30,001 --> 02:44:36,426
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what sucks is I have the money and I have the actual, I just don't have the space.

2353
02:44:36,746 --> 02:44:39,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have bought a Beatmania Complete Mixer 500.

2354
02:44:41,450 --> 02:44:41,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Dang.

2355
02:44:41,710 --> 02:44:42,571
[SPEAKER_15]: I would have stored it for you.

2356
02:44:44,915 --> 02:44:45,876
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little late now, though.

2357
02:44:46,096 --> 02:44:46,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll wait when I move out.

2358
02:44:47,897 --> 02:44:50,119
[SPEAKER_04]: We had another vote that Twen ruined the internet.

2359
02:44:51,180 --> 02:44:52,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Gay porn sites ruined the internet.

2360
02:44:53,181 --> 02:44:53,742
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think so.

2361

2364
02:45:02,729 --> 02:45:04,230
[SPEAKER_18]: There is no animalcrossing.com.

2365
02:45:05,251 --> 02:45:09,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Animal-crossing.com, sorry.

2366
02:45:10,074 --> 02:45:11,395
[SPEAKER_18]: What else ruined the internet?

2367
02:45:11,635 --> 02:45:12,596
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what ruined the internet?

2368
02:45:12,616 --> 02:45:13,197
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Freak?

2369
02:45:14,923 --> 02:45:15,243
[SPEAKER_18]: No!

2370
02:45:16,004 --> 02:45:16,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

2371
02:45:17,104 --> 02:45:17,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're a mod there.

2372
02:45:18,906 --> 02:45:19,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn straight.

2373
02:45:19,866 --> 02:45:20,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn skippy.

2374
02:45:22,788 --> 02:45:24,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, shouldn't that be damn poopy?

2375
02:45:24,409 --> 02:45:25,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn poopy.

2376
02:45:27,011 --> 02:45:28,652
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that would be darn poopy.

2377
02:45:29,433 --> 02:45:29,693

[SPEAKER_18]: Hey!

2382
02:45:35,217 --> 02:45:43,102
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, if Maple's listening, check your Neopets account and add me as your friend, or I won't send you any dung.

2383
02:45:47,247 --> 02:45:48,569
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I have Neopets.

[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fucking EverQuest.

2395
02:46:12,365 --> 02:46:14,546
[SPEAKER_04]: How did we leave EverQuest off of our list?

2396
02:46:14,566 --> 02:46:15,867
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm still pissed at Ragnarok.

02:46:22,136 --> 02:46:29,557
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still mad, though, at Gravity for Ride and Rock Online and making it where I can't play anymore.

2401
02:46:30,457 --> 02:46:36,218
[SPEAKER_18]: If they were reliable, maybe I could play again and get my goggles back.

2405
02:46:48,160 --> 02:46:50,881
[SPEAKER_18]: Because of Shockwave, we have Rattuskull and Devildoll.

[SPEAKER_18]: Which, by the way, stupid people ruin everything.

2420
02:47:40,882 --> 02:47:49,609
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know, I find it very funny for those people who, when you're going on fan art sites, trying to download fan art, and you right-click to save the picture, and they go, Oh, you can't do that, blah, blah.

2421
02:47:49,869 --> 02:47:51,150

[SPEAKER_18]: Or if they have it where you can't save the pages.

2425
02:47:55,194 --> 02:47:56,194
[SPEAKER_04]: You go to view their web source.

2426
02:47:56,415 --> 02:47:56,895
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

2427
02:47:57,015 --> 02:48:02,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody who has any knowledge of how to use their computer in a graphics editor, it's called print screen.

02:48:04,861 --> 02:48:05,262
[SPEAKER_18]: That works.

2429
02:48:06,461 --> 02:48:13,066

[SPEAKER_17]: Just wait for that day.

02:49:14,400 --> 02:49:16,421

[SPEAKER_04]: I know what it's like to be the number one guest.

[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Google, the only unbiased search engine.

2466
02:50:16,725 --> 02:50:21,589
[SPEAKER_18]: What did they refuse to take to put people higher who pay them more?

2467
02:50:22,766 --> 02:50:24,666
[SPEAKER_18]: They are an unbiased search engine.

2468
02:50:24,906 --> 02:50:25,527

2471
02:50:30,527 --> 02:50:33,408
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, go under the language preferences and look at the list of languages.

2472
02:50:33,648 --> 02:50:35,328
[SPEAKER_18]: You can browse in Esperanto.

2473
02:50:36,448 --> 02:50:37,129
[SPEAKER_18]: That's brilliant.

2474
02:50:39,669 --> 02:50:42,049
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I would say Google improved the internet.

2475
02:50:42,149 --> 02:50:44,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Web.archive.org, I believe it's called.

2476
02:50:44,750 --> 02:50:45,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Yahoo email is good.

2477
02:50:46,110 --> 02:50:47,290
[SPEAKER_04]: The archiver thing.

2478
02:50:47,330 --> 02:50:49,071
[SPEAKER_04]: The web archiver improved the internet.

2479
02:50:49,091 --> 02:50:49,571
[SPEAKER_18]: The anonymizer.

2480
02:50:50,351 --> 02:50:51,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Anonymizer.

2481
02:50:51,533 --> 02:50:54,916
[SPEAKER_18]: But Yahoo Email is pretty good because they've built in a spam filter.

2482
02:50:55,836 --> 02:50:56,957
[SPEAKER_04]: PopUpKiller.

2483
02:50:57,978 --> 02:50:58,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Save the internet.

2484
02:50:58,879 --> 02:50:59,299

02:51:02,502 --> 02:51:03,142
[SPEAKER_18]: Kazalite.

2487
02:51:03,923 --> 02:51:05,184

2491
02:51:08,734 --> 02:51:15,817
[SPEAKER_18]: Back to the Day, Back to the Day, Audio Galaxy, because people told Audio Galaxy to take it down, and Audio Galaxy said, hey, fuck you.

2492
02:51:15,857 --> 02:51:18,378
[SPEAKER_04]: PHPBB2 is being suggested by SoCalCase.

2493
02:51:18,398 --> 02:51:21,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2494
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:24,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there an email to read?

2495
02:51:24,300 --> 02:51:25,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.

2496
02:51:25,401 --> 02:51:26,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Black Lab's my hero.

2497
02:51:26,461 --> 02:51:27,922
[SPEAKER_04]: He reminded me that we had email in the box here.

2498
02:51:27,982 --> 02:51:30,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Easyboard.com ruined the internet.

2499
02:51:30,283 --> 02:51:31,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, that's beautiful.

2500
02:51:31,643 --> 02:51:31,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2501
02:51:32,403 --> 02:51:33,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Sakbemani has salvaged the internet.

2502
02:51:34,838 --> 02:51:37,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakmamani completely improved the internet as did Orange Lounge Radio.

2503
02:51:38,261 --> 02:51:39,422
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, DDR Freak.

2504
02:51:42,544 --> 02:51:44,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, stop looking at me!

2505
02:51:46,507 --> 02:51:50,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I had one more FU, we never got to read.

2506
02:51:51,431 --> 02:51:55,594
[SPEAKER_04]: So, shit, where's that FU music I had earlier for our chat room?

2507
02:51:55,995 --> 02:51:56,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2508
02:51:57,336 --> 02:51:57,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I had it.

2509
02:51:59,177 --> 02:52:00,418
[SPEAKER_18]: Stand by to bitch.

2510
02:52:00,919 --> 02:52:01,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay.

2511
02:52:01,259 --> 02:52:01,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay.

2512
02:52:04,968 --> 02:52:15,492
[SPEAKER_04]: F, persons from Hicktown I don't know that made me 4-1, screwing me out of a medal at my wrestling tournament, and my Mac, my dad gave me an early Christmas present, and I book WooFuckingWho.

2513
02:52:15,892 --> 02:52:17,173
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what the email says.

2514
02:52:17,193 --> 02:52:19,293
[SPEAKER_04]: That came from Martin Tan.

2515
02:52:19,353 --> 02:52:19,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2516
02:52:22,314 --> 02:52:25,536
[SPEAKER_18]: I've decided something that I want the chat room to do for me, or all of our listeners.

2517
02:52:25,696 --> 02:52:26,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you have a command.

2518
02:52:27,057 --> 02:52:27,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2519
02:52:29,259 --> 02:52:31,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially people in the LiveJournal community or whatever.

2520
02:52:32,160 --> 02:52:34,402
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you still have the link to that sorting quiz that I gave you?

2521
02:52:35,729 --> 02:52:39,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, if you can remember the first few... It was at Virtual Hogwarts.

2522
02:52:41,535 --> 02:52:43,197
[SPEAKER_18]: No, just do a search for it on Google.

2523
02:52:43,898 --> 02:52:48,002
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm rather curious because I'm still in my little fan phase right now.

2524
02:52:48,503 --> 02:52:52,106
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see where everybody in the chat room would find themselves sorted.

2525
02:52:53,007 --> 02:52:56,211
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want them to take the sorting quiz that is like the best one ever.

2526
02:52:56,676 --> 02:52:58,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Hogwarts?

2527
02:52:58,757 --> 02:52:59,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is it this one?

2528
02:52:59,538 --> 02:53:00,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Hogwarts?

2529
02:53:00,699 --> 02:53:00,979
[SPEAKER_04]: This one?

2530
02:53:01,399 --> 02:53:01,680
[SPEAKER_04]: This one?

2531
02:53:02,160 --> 02:53:02,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven Dragons?

2532
02:53:02,660 --> 02:53:02,920
[SPEAKER_04]: That one?

2533
02:53:02,980 --> 02:53:03,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2534
02:53:03,461 --> 02:53:05,742
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to post a link in the chat room, and I want everyone to take it.

2535
02:53:05,782 --> 02:53:09,225
[SPEAKER_18]: And when it asks you to pick your preference for a house, pick no preference.

2536
02:53:09,705 --> 02:53:09,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2537
02:53:09,805 --> 02:53:10,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I want to see where it puts you.

2538
02:53:11,166 --> 02:53:12,267
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you're going to do this.

2539
02:53:12,287 --> 02:53:15,089
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to say, there's a little link on there that says...

2540
02:53:15,589 --> 02:53:16,089
[SPEAKER_18]: Get sorted.

2541
02:53:16,450 --> 02:53:17,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Get sorted.

2542
02:53:17,130 --> 02:53:18,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Click here to be sorted.

2543
02:53:18,571 --> 02:53:19,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the left column.

2544
02:53:20,492 --> 02:53:24,415
[SPEAKER_04]: At the very end of the quiz, it'll ask you if you have a preference for a house.

2545
02:53:24,515 --> 02:53:25,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Click no preference.

2546
02:53:26,156 --> 02:53:31,100
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right underneath the... Because if you've seen the recent movies, you'll know that if you have a preference, that's what you're going to get.

2547
02:53:31,420 --> 02:53:32,501
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, twins, shut up.

2548
02:53:35,022 --> 02:53:40,186
[SPEAKER_18]: So... You wonder why you're on my... I got Slytherin, by the way.

2549
02:53:40,206 --> 02:53:41,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I took this test and I sorted into Slytherin.

2550
02:53:41,647 --> 02:53:42,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I always get Slytherin.

2551
02:53:43,917 --> 02:53:46,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Lep says he already took it and he's in Ravenclaw.

2552
02:53:46,559 --> 02:53:47,339
[SPEAKER_18]: You're a nerd.

2553
02:53:49,960 --> 02:53:53,442
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, make sure it's this test that you took.

2554
02:53:53,683 --> 02:53:57,164
[SPEAKER_04]: So take this test and find out where you get sorted.

2555
02:53:57,505 --> 02:53:58,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't tell us in the chat room.

2556
02:53:59,005 --> 02:54:00,146
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to tell you there.

2557
02:54:01,527 --> 02:54:05,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Email it to the Orange Lounge Radio and we'll make a tally.

2558
02:54:05,509 --> 02:54:06,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Or post it in the Live Journal community.

2559
02:54:06,730 --> 02:54:08,671
[SPEAKER_18]: When we get back from Bobo, I'll put up a link in the...

2560
02:54:09,275 --> 02:54:11,876
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCalKicks wants you to know he loves you, by the way, DarkSakura.

2561
02:54:12,276 --> 02:54:13,516
[SPEAKER_18]: Aww, I love you too.

2562
02:54:14,296 --> 02:54:22,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so go take that test, email orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and let us know where you were sorted, because Jamie is that big of a Harry Potter nerd that she has to know.

2563
02:54:22,859 --> 02:54:24,599
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we should start the personality quiz of the week.

2564
02:54:25,219 --> 02:54:26,340
[SPEAKER_04]: The personality quiz of the week?

2565
02:54:27,980 --> 02:54:29,240
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, somebody quit the twin.

2566
02:54:29,620 --> 02:54:29,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2567
02:54:34,648 --> 02:54:35,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to kick him again.

2568
02:54:35,809 --> 02:54:36,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you want to kick him again?

2569
02:54:36,729 --> 02:54:37,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead and take the keyboard.

2570
02:54:37,810 --> 02:54:41,112
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, I'm going to ask Loki, what's your final thought of the day?

2571
02:54:41,672 --> 02:54:45,795
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought of the day is I'm going home and working my website.

2572
02:54:46,355 --> 02:54:49,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I don't know, I have nothing better to do.

2573
02:54:50,718 --> 02:54:51,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I did my work for the week.

2574
02:54:55,100 --> 02:54:56,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's furiously trying to kick.

2575
02:54:59,261 --> 02:55:00,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2576
02:55:00,762 --> 02:55:02,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're waiting for your edits.

2577
02:55:02,624 --> 02:55:04,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I just haven't gotten around to it.

2578
02:55:09,269 --> 02:55:10,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, now that that's over.

2579
02:55:11,951 --> 02:55:13,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck with the site.

2580
02:55:14,012 --> 02:55:15,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll finish my thing.

2581
02:55:16,374 --> 02:55:21,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the edits yet because I'm lazy and haven't made them yet.

2582
02:55:21,838 --> 02:55:22,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

2583
02:55:23,300 --> 02:55:23,720
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

2584
02:55:24,500 --> 02:55:28,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, SoCalKicks is waiting for the MaxUSA edits for his site.

2585
02:55:31,089 --> 02:55:36,994
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, if you still want to host the edits that I've made for you, by the way, I'll go ahead and send them to you again, but be forewarned.

2586
02:55:37,414 --> 02:55:39,876
[SPEAKER_18]: My DexDrive died.

2587
02:55:40,216 --> 02:55:44,740
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, if anyone happens to find a DexDrive anywhere in their town... I have a spare.

2588
02:55:45,620 --> 02:55:46,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I want it.

2589
02:55:46,661 --> 02:55:47,602
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll pay you five bucks for it.

2590
02:55:48,322 --> 02:55:52,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie had that look on her face when Loki took the mic away, like, you asshole!

2591
02:55:52,646 --> 02:55:55,148
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden when Loki said that, she was like, oh, never mind.

2592
02:55:56,889 --> 02:55:57,830
[SPEAKER_18]: You live for now.

2593
02:56:00,070 --> 02:56:01,371
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, he has them.

2594
02:56:01,431 --> 02:56:01,872
[SPEAKER_04]: They're up.

2595
02:56:01,892 --> 02:56:02,552
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just not linked.

2596
02:56:02,913 --> 02:56:03,473
[SPEAKER_18]: I have new ones.

2597
02:56:03,773 --> 02:56:04,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

2598
02:56:04,654 --> 02:56:05,635
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get some of mine up there, too.

2599
02:56:05,655 --> 02:56:06,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be neat?

2600
02:56:06,715 --> 02:56:07,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Squeak.

2601
02:56:08,297 --> 02:56:14,221
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought of the week is I hate people that I go out on dates with.

2602
02:56:14,281 --> 02:56:14,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate them all.

2603
02:56:15,362 --> 02:56:22,007
[SPEAKER_06]: And besides, you can have the results or the winners from my MakeEditGetPorn contest.

2604
02:56:22,027 --> 02:56:23,528
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all MaxUSA edits.

2605
02:56:23,869 --> 02:56:24,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Whee!

2606
02:56:25,390 --> 02:56:25,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

2607
02:56:27,011 --> 02:56:28,472
[SPEAKER_18]: I should enter that just for the hell of it.

2608
02:56:29,133 --> 02:56:29,493
[SPEAKER_18]: You should.

2609
02:56:31,997 --> 02:56:32,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for watching!

2610
02:56:46,818 --> 02:56:47,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2611
02:56:48,679 --> 02:56:49,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I guess that's it.

2612
02:56:50,301 --> 02:56:53,823
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to point out... Oh, there's the fortune cookie in the directory all by itself, Jamie?

2613
02:56:53,963 --> 02:56:55,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then we'll have that all taken care of.

2614
02:56:56,565 --> 02:56:57,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's it.

2615
02:56:57,225 --> 02:56:59,527
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next week when we're going to do our holiday wrap-up.

2616
02:57:00,748 --> 02:57:01,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And... This one?

2617
02:57:02,349 --> 02:57:02,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2618
02:57:03,109 --> 02:57:05,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And... That'll be it?

2619
02:57:07,352 --> 02:57:08,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to do a tape show on the 29th?

2620
02:57:08,833 --> 02:57:10,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do my final thought!

2621
02:57:10,354 --> 02:57:10,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you did.

2622
02:57:11,235 --> 02:57:12,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my bad, Jamie.

2623
02:57:12,116 --> 02:57:12,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kicking twins.

2624
02:57:13,036 --> 02:57:13,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, sorry.

2625
02:57:14,197 --> 02:57:15,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, yes, your final thought?

2626
02:57:19,742 --> 02:57:20,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, that was riveting.

2627
02:57:20,827 --> 02:57:22,854
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go and watch all of these Alan Rickman movies.

2628
02:57:24,542 --> 02:57:27,663
[SPEAKER_22]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
