1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Message for you, son! Attention! Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Top, and then some.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity. Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Just kidding. Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, are there any balls down there?

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What's your favorite scary movie?

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Showgirls.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Absolutely frightening.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's yours?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Don't torture yourself.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's my job.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now's the time our sprockets pay me dogs.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't get you, my pretty.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And your little dog, too.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know kung fu.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why did they have to take the word game?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No! What I expect for Spanish Exposition is kingdom.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hey!

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dark sacral.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sky.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Loki.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What kind and what human being would find that funny?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We are live and this is episode number 24.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
For December the 15th of 2002, you're tuned into the Blamani Scene's most hilarious radio station of all things Blamani.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts, for you and my gnomious sky.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner of the Happiest Bunny on the Farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Bird? Bird? Bird is the word?

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm freezing.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is so crazy, wait, is that just me?

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hello. Hi, our mics weren't loud enough during that whole intro. My bad, you wanna say hello again, Jamie?

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I said I was cold, dammit.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And Loki, you wanna say hello again? Ah, sure, whatever.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sorry about that. We're still new at this. 24 episodes into this, we still don't know what the fuck we're doing.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Uh, anyway, we got a whole bunch of fun things to talk about tonight, but, uh, we'll get to that pretty soon.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Actually, I don't know what the hell we're gonna talk about tonight. I think it's just, uh...

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The holidays kill everything, don't they?

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Uh, sure.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Moki's kind of panicking right now, by the way.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What's the matter?

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, uh, my attorney makes three entry. It's all done. I just need to upload it.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My dial-up doesn't want to upload it, and I have to upload it here, but we can't because the stream, you know, might get cut out, so I'm stuck.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have it on a CD, it's all done. I just can't get into it.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,560
Alright, well, we'll panic about Loki's situation in the meantime, we're going to take a quick

51
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,560
And we will be right back. Enjoy!

52
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:22,280
All right, here's something being brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

53
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,480
It's some tracks from the new Good Cool compilation that was just recently released.

54
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,600
We're going to play a couple tracks here for you.

55
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,600
We're going to play Spooky and Shake It Down back-to-back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

56
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:05,600
You must be everything

57
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Any other love you want

58
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,600

59
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Kick the beat with the groove

Tryna make me feel extra love in my screen, yeah

71
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Keep it up, keep it up

72
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Whenever we're outside

73
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Must be heaven sent

74
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Whenever we're outside

75
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600

Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

91
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:33,040
Hello, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

92
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
That was horrible.

93
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,560
I told you you'd hate it.

94
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
It's kind of funny.

95
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
Haven't you ever heard that song?

96
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
That Missy Elliott song?

97
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Do I listen to that?

98
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,040
Yeah, I know you don't listen to pop music, but whatever.

99
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,600
Just because I have taste.

100
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,920
Oh well, I'm sorry to hear that.

101
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,560
Anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

102
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,560
And that was some stuff from the Good Cool CD, by the way.

103
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,220
Spooky and Shake It Down, those were the two songs you heard back to back.

104
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,280
Before that, Blake Down, a song that I just pulled out of my ass because I didn't have

105
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,640
anything else queued up.

106
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,680
Oh, the chat room seemed to enjoy that promo, so they got the joke.

107
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
That's good.

108
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
How you doing?

109
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,040
Loki is still over there panicking?

110
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Yeah.

111
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,760
Twen tried to get you a, Twen couldn't shed his big fat mouth and tried to get you a waiver

112
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,060
or something, but now they said, no, you gotta get it in by midnight.

113
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,260
Eastern? Yeah, this guy said Eastern, but if you notice

114
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,580
their web page doesn't say anything, so I don't know, you could sue. You should take

115
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,220
him to Judge Judy. I don't give a crap.

116
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,900
That's okay, because the only one that matters is make Eddick get porn, right?

117
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,340
Yeah. That's okay, because we have a backup plan,

118
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,700
so Loki's okay, it's just my roommate's gotta get home in enough time for us to, you know,

119
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,580
into a system and upload something break it that's oh hey good suggestion

120
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:03,700
instead of Judge Judy Judge Jamie you need a bookmark yes use that all right

121
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,000
hey so how was your week I'm reading Harry Potter during the break you're

122
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,420
wearing this lovely new Slytherin scarf to go with your new obsession new

123
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:21,260
obsession well somewhat it's new to this year though isn't it it's not like the

124
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,980
official one because the official ones were made really cheaply and kind of

125
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,980
look stupid because they have like the house logo on them I think they look

126
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,640
stupid but this is a handmade scarf in green and gray it's the Slytherin color

127
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,100
so I wear it and it's made to look like the ones in the movies and it's warm and

128
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,480
comfy. Some folks in the chat room are indicating they've read all four books

129
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,600
which one's your favorite? Oh Goblet of Fire.

130
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Goblet of Fire was the best. All right cool. Just because of the whole ending my

131
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,360
God that was beautiful.

132
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,940
Okay so did anyone do anything

133
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,760
oh, we have a special special guest tonight in the chat room. This makes me happy.

134
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,940
This makes me moist as a snack cake ladies and gentlemen.

135
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,760
DJ Morpheus my old buddy from Understation Live, Travis

136
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,940
in the chat room tonight and he's saying oh that reminds me I need to send Jamie a pick

137
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,260
of the Sakura Japanese restaurant sign out here.

138
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,600
Yes! I want to see signs with my name on them.

139
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,840
And he's saying by the way, he also said that Understation Live 3.0

140
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,840
is going to be debuting in January. Exciting!

141
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,960
Stay tuned to understationlive.org for all the details. If you enjoyed last

142
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,000
week's match game segment, we totally ripped that off understationlive, but that was a

143
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,600
rip-off. It was a tribute, not a rip-off.

144
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,080
Oh yes, a tribute. Yes, a tribute. That was in turn a tribute to the, you know,

145
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,200
classic game show, because it rules. I was actually, I actually was just watching that the other day.

146
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,960
My favorite, Charles Nelson Reilly.

147
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,560
Biggest flaming homosexual in the seventies.

148
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,560
And you're using your Mr. Spanky voice.

149
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Yes, my Mr. Spanky voice is inspired by Charles Nelson Reilly.

150
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
The fair degrees.

151
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
The little bush baby.

152
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,560
Ah, yes. Black Lab says Game Show Network rules. Game Show Network does rule.

153
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
I love the Game Show Network.

154
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Except Wind Tuition.

155
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Except for those of us who don't have cable anymore.

156
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,560
What the fuck is Wind Tuition? That show sucks.

157
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,560
It has the guy from Double Dare hosting it, no, I want to...

158
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Mark Summers is cool, but not on that show.

159
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Do you know who produces that show?

160
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,560
Who? Is it a Mark Goodson television production?

161
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,560
No, Henry Winkler or whatever.

162
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
The Fonz.

163
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Oh, the Fonz?

164
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
The Fonz.

165
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
No way.

166
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Because the Fonz is cool.

167
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Oh, we actually have Bahmani news to report, go figure.

168
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
We actually have some things going on in the Bahmani community.

169
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,560
There was a big tournament on Friday in the bay.

170
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,760
Friday in the Bay. There was the Miggle Evil Tournament 2, I believe it was called. Am

171
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
I right? Evil Tournament 2?

172
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
I wanted to go.

173
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,120
I wanted to go too, but that whole Friday thing meant, you know, we'd have to drive.

174
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,120
I didn't get anything out of work until 6.30, and I got off work at 5.30 and was there until

175
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,960
nearly 6.30 because Dan wasn't off work yet, so grrr.

176
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,480
I just didn't want to drive out there in the rain. I'm sorry. Hearing that the whole damn

177
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,980
thing started late, I probably could have made it in time, but I just didn't want to

178
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,020
driving the rain my apologies to the folks there but you know I just I get

179
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:17,340
all freaked out driving in storms who would I would have cried anyway oh yeah

180
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,580
we wanted to we wanted to read the results to you from the tournament so in

181
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:29,580
perfect attack fourth place went to emphasis nice job emphasis third place

182
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,440
went to virtually don't call him the max 300 King or he'll kick your ass second

183
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,280
First place went to Chubbs, and first place, this is the hugest surprise of the century,

184
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Tigger.

185
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Really?

186
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Gasp.

187
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Oh my God.

188
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
Gasp.

189
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,880
They did this whole new little bracket thing though that was kind of cool.

190
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,280
What they do, and this is kind of cool, we should talk about this kind of different ideas,

191
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,640
ways to run a tournament.

192
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,600
They took a bracket of 16, and what they did, you know, just like normal, except instead

193
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,520
Instead of the person losing the last match, just automatically getting second place, what

194
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,480
they did is they removed Tigger out of the bracket and replayed all the matches that

195
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,500
would have been affected by his presence, basically.

196
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,760
And so they determined a second place that way.

197
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,520
It's kind of interesting the way it works, but it sounded very cool and I guess it worked

198
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
out pretty well.

199
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Sounds neat.

200
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,160
So that was pretty cool.

201
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:41,600
Freestyle, 3rd place went to a fellow called Hamsterhead, 2nd place went to 001, I thought

202
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:49,000
it was 007, 00 something got 2nd place, DCB here typed all these results to me and I thought

203
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,520
it was 007, it could have been 001, I don't know. In first place, starting to win a lot

204
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,620
of these freestyle competitions lately, it's the wonderful, the awesome, the incredible

205
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:06,260
Bruce Leroy taking first place. Apparently his routine was insertion, he did this whole

206
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,900
little Spiderman thing to it, so we'll figure. I have to look for the videos. Yes, we'll

207
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,800
be eagerly awaiting those videos. Some friends of Orange Lounge were competing in that, by

208
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
By the way, too?

209
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Okay.

210
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Yes.

211
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
So...

212
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Word.

213
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,920
I don't know, what else is there to talk about Bamani News?

214
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,600
There are rumors saying that DDR Extreme is going to be released on Christmas.

215
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,120
Yeah, I think there's any truth to that.

216
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,640
That sounds kind of early to me.

217
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,800
Christmas is a commercial holiday in Japan.

218
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,240
Of course, that's not far off from here, but even so, I don't think that they would put

219
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,720
a significance in that date for the release of the game.

220
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,860
I know, it sounds more like somebody's little fantasy than reality news, but who knows?

221
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:56,280
That's coming from a fairly reputable source, so we shall see!

222
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,160
I think it's an early April show.

223
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,280
I remembered hearing that the official release date was sometime in early January, so that's

224
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
what I'm going to stay with.

225
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,040
That's my story and I'm sticking to it, right?

226
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,240
Until I see, otherwise, something maybe in Naoki's journal or something, which doesn't

227
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
exist anymore?

228
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Nope, it's gone.

229
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Good!

230
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,240
But we lost our favorite joke. Maybe we should start one.

231
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,240
We should do a journal on behalf of Naoki.

232
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Yeah. You know, I've got an extra live journal code.

233
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,240
The lost deep thoughts of Naoki.

234
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
I'll do that. I'll set that up.

235
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Alright, let's do it. We'll make a Naoki live journal or something.

236
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,240
Now don't go getting ideas and taking the name before we can get to it or we'll kick your ass.

237
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Yeah, that's ours. I'll set you on fire.

238
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
We claim it. Dibs!

239
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm not cold anymore, am I?

240
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You're not cold anymore?

241
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,080
Well, that's because we've got the lights in here that make everything hot.

242
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,440
I went shopping this week.

243
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
What'd you buy?

244
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Oh!

245
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,160
You've got a present for Jamie, don't you?

246
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,720
I bought Christmas gifts.

247
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Let's have Jamie open her Christmas present live on air.

248
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
This will be fun.

249
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,560
Let's play some Christmas Eve music to celebrate.

250
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,360
You can't open it until I play music.

251
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,720
Now that I've got bills paid, I can go out and buy the rest of the presents that I need

252
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
to.

253
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,360
Yeah, it's kind of scary when you get down to $200 on your bank account and you've got

254
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
bills due.

255
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
Ah!

256
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,760
There we go, some nice Christmas music for you to be opening presents to.

257
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,560
God damn, what'd you tape this with?

258
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Use packing tape.

259
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Dark tape.

260
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,560
It looks like me. Oh my god!

261
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,560
You're quite the stooge, aren't you?

262
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,560
I am going to be in Allelukmen Heaven.

263
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,560
I have Quigley Down Under,

264
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Die Hard,

265
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
Galaxy Quest,

266
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,560
Robin Hood Princess Thieves,

267
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,560
and Dogma Special Edition.

268
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,560
I'm a happy girl.

269
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
I've been drooled for hours.

270
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Would you like to explain the Alan Rickman fetish to anybody that's new to our show?

271
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,560
He's hot, and I don't care how old he is, I love him.

272
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,560
I didn't know he was in Quigley Down Under. Wasn't this movie, like, really bad?

273
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,560
I don't know. I think that Tom Selleck is.

274
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Yeah, but, like, ever since Magnum P.I., Tom Selleck, like, sucks.

275
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,560
There's a few I missed, though. Like, blow dry. I couldn't find that one.

276
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,560
That's okay. Something tells me Jamie's gonna be busy for a little while.

277
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:33,960
what I just picked up on laserdisc was a sense of sensibility if that isn't a

278
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,600
foofy chick flick I don't know what is

279
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,640
very cool Oh feeling the love here on orange launch radio I'm getting I'm

280
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,240
getting such great use out of my game too I love that thing more than anything

281
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,520
I play fantasy star online now I've went out and bought fantasy star online and

282
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,900
game just takes so much ass. I'm just trying to get some DDR people going in on that. There's

283
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,140
a little thread over on DDR Freak if you check the other games forum. There's a whole little

284
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,140
thread on Phantasy Star Online, so you should check that out because they're trying to form

285
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:23,380
a block and ship. Christmas is neat. We'll be doing a special

286
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,860
holiday episode next week on the 22nd actually be our year-end wrap-up too by

287
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,700
the way because we're not going to be doing actually I don't know I guess we

288
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,380
could do a show on the 29th it looks like my SoCal trip at the end of the

289
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,580
month may not happen I don't know yet it's a it's still a possibility up in

290
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,380
the air at this point so we shall see but I think either way we agreed we want

291
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:51,060
to tape that show why not we've got partying to do that's right yeah it's

292
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,540
yesterday. No, it was Friday night that we did the Fuck Off Show. We did a little Fuck

293
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,420
Off Show and then we decided to go to Rocky last night with another friend of ours, Neil

294
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:37,020
Bugd, who gives the web space, by the way. He is my Sky.cx webmaster. We all decided

295
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,140
to go to Rocky in the Bay Area because we don't have it here in SAC anymore. And we

296
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,080
had fun. It was the second week in a row, actually, that I'd been because we all went

297
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,900
the week before with Jabberwocky. It was fun. Good times. But we don't get out of there

298
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,180
until damn near three in the morning and then we had to go looking for diesel

299
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,980
because Neil's car runs off of diesel fuel he has one of those no he has a

300
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,080
Jetta but it's one of those special ones that runs off of diesel fuel so we had

301
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,120
to drive for like 45 minutes to find a place open 24 hours at diesel finally

302
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,120
found one and then we stopped at Denny's on the way back and Jabberwocky got into

303
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,660
an argument with a waitress over covered and smothered well it wasn't really an

304
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:24,260
argument it was more of a discussion not really this is crap you went to bed what

305
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:32,700
time did you go to bed three stayed up I stayed up looking for I think it was

306
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,620
Friday night I stayed up looking for this one picture that I could not find

307
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:43,540
is from for anyone who's seen Chamber of Secrets it was the scene with a snake

308
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:50,000
dueling and I wanted to find him dueling and I couldn't find it until like 4 30

309
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,020
a.m. I found it I did a post at the time that I found it and I finally finished

310
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,560
my new icon set but that was on your own your own personal live journal

311
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,760
which if you want to know what it is and go to the orange lounge community yes go to the

312
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,480
orange lounge live journal and look on the friends list there and they'll find me

313
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,840
I did a post on there about something that we're gonna play on the show tonight

314
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,840
for all the Animal Crossing addicts.

315
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Do you want to give an Animal Crossing update? What's new in the world of Animal Crossing?

316
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,840
I want Olivia back.

317
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,840
We hung a sign out front of her house that calls her a bitch, because she is a bitch.

318
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,840
Ooh, we have a visitor! Hooray, doorbell!

319
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Who's going to walk through the door?

320
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,840
For anyone who plays Animal Crossing, I'm sure you all go talk to KK, or Toto KK, as his name is.

321
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,200
And you can get a song from him, and he sings a little song and plays his little guitar,

322
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,680
so I have one of his songs that, uh, I won't tell you what it is until right before we

323
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,860
play it, unless you feel like playing it.

324
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,800
We will go to break very soon and we'll play that, and, uh, this break's gonna be interesting

325
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,240
because I'm actually gonna leave.

326
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,440
Yeah, we're kicking Rob out, we're making him get us food.

327
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,600
I'm gonna be gone for a little bit in the show.

328
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,100
We're making him get us, uh, caffeine.

329
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,480
You know what we'll do, though?

330
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,080
We'll let Dave live out a little fantasy of his, and we'll let him sit in the chair.

331
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,560
uh... but i don't know that they've got to sit on the floor of the city is on

332
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,600

333
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
here is that the chair

334
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,140
fine and it is a terrorist

335
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,560

338
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,900
i came on

339
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,500
hiding

340
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,040
so what's new day if you're the only one that's actually got out played any

341
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,900

342
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,720
we want to tell you did look at it

343
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,560
Saturday sucked ass.

344
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Why?

345
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,160
Well Friday was cool because I went to Golf Land and everyone was there and it was like

346
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,800
we happy good time.

347
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,600
I know but everyone that normally goes there is there.

348
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
And then...

349
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,040
What I said is I wasn't there so it didn't count.

350
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Yeah.

351
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,160
And so then that was cool and I said well Saturday is probably going to be the same

352
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,360
because everyone goes that day too.

353
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,900
And I went there and Will and Cedric were there for a little bit and then they left

354
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,320
and I was all alone.

355
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,240
I played so much in initial D. All by yourself!

356
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,200
I was dancing all alone, voodoo!

357
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,100
Were you dancing all alone in a kimono?

358
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,220
Yes, in the middle of Golf Land.

359
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,580
I actually did the nicest thing I've ever done in DDR.

360
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,540
Some guy offered to pay, you know, to see me play. He's like, oh you're so good!

361
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,660
Wow! You know how that happens sometimes. Was he hitting on you?

362
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,140
No, he was like 50 with his family, and he was like, oh, you have to see this guy.

363
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,540
I don't mean nothing. I was like, no, I'll pay for it, it's okay.

364
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,820
I did that, and I was like, wow. I'm so nice.

365
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,660
Wait, so like, you're nice because somebody gave you money to dance?

366
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,700
Dance, monkey, dance! No, but see, I didn't accept the money.

367
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,100
And I was like, damn, I'm so nice, and I'm so modest.

368
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:00,420
The last time somebody offered me tokens like that, I took them.

369
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,920
What in the hell is our chat room doing right now?

370
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,420
They're just typing dots.

371
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,420
They're on drugs.

372
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
I'm gonna kick the next person who types dots.

373
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
Let's see.

374
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
It's twin.

375
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
Oh, it's twin.

376
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,420
Yay.

377
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
Kick him.

378
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,420
But see, it takes them a while to get it.

379
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,420
Uh oh.

380
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,420
There's 23rd Megas.

381
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,420
We're having a kick fest.

382
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,420
But see, it's funny because the lag.

383
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
Yeah, I know.

384
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,420
The lag didn't know.

385
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,420
So they didn't even know about it.

386
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,420
Oh, he did it again.

387
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,420
See, that's just...

388
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,420
Oh, no, Joe Mama's playing cop for me. That's good.

389
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:42,420

Speaking of happy crack I need Twinkies. Speaking of happy crack I'm going to make a run right now so

396
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,060
we're going to take a quick break

397
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,820
we'll be back and when we come back I'm not gonna be here so you'll get your sim

398
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,420
update

399
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,260
and who knows what's gonna happen while I'm not here. I don't know I'm scared.

400
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,420
During this break though we are going to give everyone a little

401
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,820
the taste of Animal Crossing.

402
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,340
Yes, we will have you intro that in just one moment.

403
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,780
We come back and then you're going to do your Sim update, correct?

404
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,780
Yes.

405
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,020
And then you'll talk about your Trinity Mix 3 troubles and you guys will basically own

406
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,020
this show.

407
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,700
Well then, while Rob's pulling up the song, I'll go ahead and...

408
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,700
Yes, please talk about the song.

409
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,580
This particular one is the Eurobeat piece that's in Animal Crossing.

410
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:57,820
as long as DJ KK, if ever you're interested in pulling it up.

411
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,540
And go ahead and give a listen.

412
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,620
This is actually the one with him singing it, so enjoy.

413
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,100
And also during this break, we'll

414
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,220
play one more track from the Good Cool CD

415
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,760
and some other random crap.

416
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,260

419
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,600
A groove, groove, groove like this makes your body move, move, move

420
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,600
You got to feel the music, feel the way it flows

421
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Feel the vibrations from your head down to your toes

422
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:24,720
Do you remember the time that I need you?

423
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:32,520
I know you know everything that you do Do you remember the time that I want you?

424
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,120
But you throw me on the floor and you're my love

425
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,240

428
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,480
I want to tell you more

429
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,680
You have had a bad day

430
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,320
And I can't watch me anymore

431
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,640
You have had a ball

432
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,160
I lay on my knees

433
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,160

I can't care what you even say

440
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
You have got it now

441
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,660
A little night, it's a golden sun

442
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,660
Every night

443
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,660
I hear your voice

444
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,660
Every night

00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,660
We will play a show for the next time.

00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,380
Rob didn't leave fast enough so we had to kill him. It has a birthday present. I buried his body.

497
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,140
Well, I didn't really bury it yet. No, Rob's getting me chocolate so I'm happy.

there's the max 2 supposedly has been upgraded over at uh...

502
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,620
tapioca express in davis so uh... we're gonna go check out that action

503
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,180
how far away is that?

504
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,740
it's like thirty minute drive from here

505
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,460
something like that

506
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,680
not too far away

507
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,860
anyway we need our um... our update, our sim update thingy

508
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:14,860
Next week is going to be the official judging of it and then you'll see on the 22nd actual submissions come online for you to check out.

509
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,020
So look for that.

510
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,180
Aside from that, not too much going on.

511
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,740
They finished the PowerPower graphics for StepMania, so

512
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,220
you'll see that in the new update probably soon.

513
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,940
And DWI haven't really been paying attention to what kind

514
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,420
of updates are going on there, so no big deal.

515
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,500
DDR UK finally finished updating all

516
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,100
their booster packs.

517
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,660
So you've got full sets of pretty much all the official

518
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,380
files with the official graphics for the most part.

519
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,560
And so go check those out for sure.

520
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,940
And aside from that, not too much else.

521
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,580
Just more files on DDR Maniacs, so go check those out.

522
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,460
Some pretty cool ones.

523
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,700
And I'm redoing my entire site.

524
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,700
Well, not my entire site, but the download section of it.

525
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,860
I'm sorting them all into 2DX-style categories.

526
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,460
And I'm actually going to be doing a mass upload of a bunch

527
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,540
of different files, so you'll see a bunch of

528
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,740
those coming soon.

529
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,860
brain only have a few of them that

530
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,660
is trained

531
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,280
uh... what

532
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,100
okay

533
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,900

534
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900

00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,500
so don't snore

00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,820

of course you know kids deadline for my uh...

541
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:46,300
Make Edit Get Porn Contest, if I remember correctly, is next Sunday.

542
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,660
Get your edits in, if you haven't yet.

543
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:54,660
Dave has entered, and if no one else enters, he will sweep the whole competition.

544
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,820
Has anyone else entered yet?

545
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,140
I will win, and all the porn will be mine!

546
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,060
I'll enter. Why not?

547
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,460
I want porn.

548
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,660
I want man porn, but I want porn.

549
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,660
If I get boob porn, then I can give it to people.

550
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,660
Dave, you don't get any porn.

551
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,660
Sorry, Dave.

552
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,660
No porn for you.

553
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,660
No porn for you!

554
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,660
I'm not entering for the porn.

555
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,660
I'm entering for the recognition of women.

556
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,660
No, you can't have the chair back.

557
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,660
The porn is a bonus.

558
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,660
Holy crap, that was fast.

559
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,660
Where's my cupcakes?

560
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:36,660
I would have been back before the break was even finished if that stupid bitch in front

561
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:41,380
bitch in front of me in line, knew how to use her goddamn ATM card in the little slider.

562
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,900
My preemptive F.U. of the week?

563
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,140
No, you need to save it for the F.U.s of the week.

564
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,620
Ugh, fine, I'll save it, but, oh man, what a bitch.

565
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,180
Maybe we should just do the F.U.s of the week.

566
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,740
Well, we gotta wait for the chat room to submit theirs.

567
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,740
We gotta give them time to send theirs.

568
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,660
You wanna do the F.U.s of the week right now?

569
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,980
We can do them in a minute, but Matt's still finishing his-

570
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,980
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

571
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,980
Well, okay, chat room-

572
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,980
Yeah, Rob!

573
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,140
Chat room, send me your F.U.s of the week over private message, or send them to Jamie's name

574
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,860

581

585
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:38,460
for Starry Eyes Surprise and a few other songs. So you'll be seeing those also hosted on my

586
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:47,700
site. So just check for that and that's it. And we're ready to go. Whoa, food! I got food.

587
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,220
Dude, this is awesome. Rob came back with chocolate cupcakes for me and now my scarf

588
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,140
is being worn by Dave. But you're not Slytherin, yo.

589
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,340
and guess what i brought back for dave

590
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,640
nothing

591
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,320
yeah

592
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,660
in this country i don't need anything

593
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,500
i'm content with sitting here on the floor in my scarf

594
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,200
that matches my sweatshirt

595
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,300
yeah

596
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,740
you're you're one of those boring or even call

597
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,060
written quite tight

598
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,300
and i think they're staying with one

599
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,900
if you can correct

600
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,260
now in harry potter talk

601
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,260
They'd better have a hot person play her.

602
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,260
Dude, Rob got fluffy balls.

603
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,260
Oh, oh, oh.

604
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,260
Propell, because Propell is the drink of the gods.

605
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,260
I've only had it once, and that was when I had some of yours.

606
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,260
Do you want some Propell?

607
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,260
Okay.

608
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,260
No.

609
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,260
Everyone's being mean to me tonight.

610
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,260
Here, have my other bottle of Propell.

611
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,260
Okay, anyway.

612
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,260
One thing that somebody in the chat room wanted to mention in your sim update,

613
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,260
I believe this was sent to me by Twen.

614
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,260
Feet of Fury got an update to it, and this is really interesting.

615
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,260
Actually, no update has been released, but there was some news on it.

616
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,260
So let me see if I can load up that news. I've got to go to one of my websites here so I can get the quote on that.

617
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,260
Because this is going to be interesting. This is something that begs being talked about here before we get into the FUs of the week.

618
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,260
It's begging with a cup and everything.

619
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:15,260
Yes, it's begging for your dollars. Literally, it's begging for a dollar.

620
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:20,500
Okay, so this is what the latest update was posted over at cagames.com, I believe is the

621
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,500
site correct?

622
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Yes, cagames.com.

623
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,100
These are the folks that make Feet of Fury.

624
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,500
This is a DDR emulator for the Dreamcast, and we talked about this a couple weeks ago

625
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,020
on the big program.

626
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,620
And I think our consensus was most of the people didn't particularly care for it.

627
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,780
I thought for a first mix it was okay, but it had a long way to go.

628
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,700
But most people here didn't care for it, DDR has kind of surpassed that right now, but

629
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,700
I don't know.

630
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,700
I think the Homebrew Dreamcast stuff is just cool to begin with.

631
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,700
But you need to play some good songs.

632
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,700
It's like trying to play SSR on Happy Craft because everything is flat.

633
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,700
And I'm being corrected, it's not an emulator, it's a simulator.

634
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,700
Get over it, I don't care, same thing.

635
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,700
Okay, it's not the same thing.

636
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,700
It's getting to play DDR for free, that's what it is.

637
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,700
It all comes down to the same thing.

638
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,700
Anyway, the news update says this.

639
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,220
Been a while since I posted some news, but two quick items.

640
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,860
They got the results back from IGF and they didn't get into the finals.

641
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,460
I don't know what that is.

642
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,980
Very surprising considering the bend of the contest is still disappointing.

643
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,900
I guess it was some kind of homemade games thing.

644
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,300
The second thing is that they're going to do a final release of Feed a Fury.

645
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,060
They're going to do it in March of 2003.

646
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,860
They've been doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes.

647
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,700
They haven't had time to really finish the game, so they're going to do it then.

648
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,820
The bigger news is that the finished Feed a Fury game will be sold rather than posted

649
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,820
online.

650
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:44,380
They may do another preview version at that time with more bug fixes, better hardware

651
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:49,340
support, better swap CD options, but if you get the real press CD, the sold one, you're

652
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:54,820
going to be treated to a lot more songs, more gameplay modes, and etc.

653
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:02,380
So I think they're begging to get a lawsuit, I agree.

654
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,060
I don't know, unless it's radically different from DDR, they might be in some trouble for

655
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,060
doing that.

656
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:12,020
Then again, Pump It Up survived this whole time, who knows.

657
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:16,420
There's also all the other clones out there that no one hears about that lurk around on

658
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,420
eBay.

659
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,360
There's Technomotion, Easy to Dancer.

660
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,980
They're not trying to sell StepMania.

661
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:30,800
I mean, Pump It Up at least had different notes, this is still up, down, left, right.

662
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,480
thing. Well, okay, remember though, Feed a Fury, the first thing it was didn't even

663
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,560
have normal DDR mode. All it was was a Dance Magic-like mode, which had

664
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,800
different things, and it looked different, but I mean, at its concept, if Konami

665
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,040
wanted to proceed with, you know, trying to get something against them, it probably

666
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,720
could do it, because it is very similar to Dance Magic, which was in Disney's

667
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,040
Disney's Mix that they released here in the U.S. already. Let's hear it for Disney's Rave.

668
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:09,200
in the u.s. it's mix happen to have Disney's right I know I know yes

669
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,680
regardless of whether they're gonna get busted or not we will be looking forward

670
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,040
to that release we will I'm sure get a copy of a feet of fury and talk about

671
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,920
Rob will we will not the rest of us are not going to get it I will stay on top

672
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
Are you going to get it now?

673
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,920
Maybe, because I don't use my Dreamcast for anything.

674
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,920
I use my Dreamcast to play Rainbow Cotton.

675
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,920
You know what I use my Dreamcast for?

676
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,920
Paperweight?

677
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
No, I use it to play Nintendo games.

678
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
For Nestor DC, that's all I use my Dreamcast for.

679
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,920
All in Soul Calibur.

680
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,920
I play Plio Da.

681
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
Plio Da is cool.

682
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,920
Plio Da is awesome.

683
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,920
Well, I had some questions in the chat room and wanted me to ask the Loki about this,

684
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,920
if you've seen this.

685
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,920
Actually, all of us, really.

686
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,920
The Flash Flash Revolution.

687
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
Have you seen that?

688
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,920
What do you think?

689
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,120
I don't like flash games, especially in dial-up.

690
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,880
Flash games all suck, and the same with the DDR.

691
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,920
I played it, and I was like, eh, whatever.

692
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,560
It took forever to load, and it wasn't that impressive.

693
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:14,600
Okay, I mean, I saw it, and it was basically like, there's nothing special about it, it's

694
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:22,840
just downloaded choppy DDR emulator, simulator, whatever it's called.

695
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:29,340
It has less songs, less variety than something like Stylania, so I don't see why you would play that.

696
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,340
Is that like that Delight Delight reduplication? That old, older account?

697
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:39,340
No, no, it's just like you download the song, or you go to the site and click on the flash game.

698
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,340
Have you ever played different little flash games or whatever? It's just like that.

699
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,840
And then the notes scroll up the screen and you have to hit the arrows at the same time.

700
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,840
Well, if you guys want to be really cool, you can go back to DDR99.

701
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:55,840
If anyone ever remembers that with the MSD files, they actually have a plugin for Winamp they can get for that.

702
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,840
That was like, I don't know, a couple years ago. So go check that out if you really want to play this stupid Flash crap.

703
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,840
I mean, there's nothing really special about it.

704
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,840
You could play Dance Dance Karnov.

705
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,840
And it's really choppy, and I don't think it was synced too well. So, no.

706
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,840
How many people remember Dance Dance Karnov?

707
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,840
I have it.

708
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:23,440
was an old Nintendo game that really sucked and so they did like a DDR flash simulator

709
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:29,720
with Karnov. Yeah, but do you know it's cool? Last week I saw DDR on the graphic calculator

710
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,680
which I had never seen before. Okay, that's like really retarded. That's the funniest

711
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,420
thing I've heard in my entire life. You know it was funny though. At least with pole position

712
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:41,720
you could like play it and it hadn't made sense, but DDR, no music, hello, what's he

713
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,940
going to do, click at you? DDR, no music, no flashing, just the arrow, scroll up the

714
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,460
the screen. There's one BPM for all four songs. It's just the notes on basic.

715
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:56,060
Actually, you're incorrect. You can do sound with the calculator, but you have to build

716
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,780
your own speakers. I have a message. I have a message for the

717
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,380
person that created DDR for the graphing calculator. Nerd.

718
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:08,540
Get a life. Get a fucking life. Go outdoors. Smell a flower or something. Get a girlfriend,

719
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,420
a boyfriend who cares

720
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,260
go out and get laid

721
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,260
something that borden calculus

722
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:21,260
say jesus

723
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,460
although yes secretly all that yes kind of cool

724
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,220
i hope the god that didn't leave

725
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:30,060
that window on when i left

726
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,060
you know i i i think i think i think

727
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,220
at least aces

728
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,100
otherwise they're all my good

729
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,420
okay i'm not even say just in case

730
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:43,420
I used to sit in chemistry class and play pole position on a graphic calculator. That was cool.

731
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,420
I used to sit there in calculus and copy all the formulas that we were supposed to memorize for the test onto the calculator.

732
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:55,420
I had them memorized anyway. To this day, I still remember that a mole is 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.

733
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,420
That is astonishing.

734
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,420
6.022.

735
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,420
Astonishing.

736
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,420
Oh yeah.

737
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,420
They've been talking in the chat room.

738
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:04,420
It has come up lately, but when I was in school we learned it was just 6.02.

739
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:09,740
When we were talking about Flash Flash Revolution, somebody brought up Black Lab Invoke This,

740
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,060
he said, Flash ruined the internet. Which kind of goes back to what we were talking

741
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,660
about a couple nights ago on the Fuck Off show. What ruined the internet?

742
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:22,220
Actually, actually, I was just... Papa Bats ruined the internet, yes.

743
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:29,260
I posted some links actually on our website about stupid knockoff DDR things that someone

744
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:34,380
actually came up with a full-body like DDR thing with sent motion-captured

745
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:43,120
sensors on his body to for like DDR is called they're making obscene shapes out

746
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,920
of pretzels they've got boobs and penises just ignore him Loki continue

747
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:56,260
hit you I don't get it it's looks what it's a pretzel yeah anyway so basically

748
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:02,800
It's like almost if you cross DDR with like say, I don't actually it was more like a Samba de Amigo

749
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,260
It was very much like that

750
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:10,520
You know how you have to strike poses and stuff with that pretty much like that you have the match poses that thing did so

751
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,300
It's like a music game

752
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,620
Like that that someone is supposed to develop also. I read there's another thing. I found that someone's developing a

753
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,300
DDR sim for ps2 Linux

754
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,300
Nerd!

755
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:30,060
Dude, now I'm thinking about getting a Linux kit for my PS2.

756
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,060
That's all I have.

757
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:35,700
Dude, that would be cool, you need to get, the only reason I wanted is to get those things

758
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,060
that people were programming, you know, that's the whole reason I wanted the Gato's A for

759
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:45,740
the first PlayStation, was so that I could have my friend program me Galaga.

760
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:50,580
And that was like a version of Galaga that actually was a challenge.

761
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:56,520
knows I'm an old namco whore sorry konami I've been giving a been given a

762
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,820
flash that we have to play over the internet because it'll make us cool or

763
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:03,960
something like that if this is it's called spider-man and if this is that

764
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,280
spider-man's gay thing I'm gonna I'm gonna start punching people randomly in

765
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,160
the chat room because that thing's stupid that's right you're getting banned

766
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:19,760
if this is that stupid spider-man is gay thing we're waiting for yes after this

767
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,200
have used the we're waiting for this to load here

768
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,560
eighty three eighty six eighty eight

769
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,940
right or slow

770
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:30,740
he shut up i'm doing a show here

771
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,060
what the fuck

772
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:39,060
it's in a foreign language

773
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,740
i hate you

774
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:47,120
this is the worst flash i've ever seen

775
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:51,120
Alright, wait, hold on, hold on. That's getting a kick.

776
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,120
You know what the best Flash was, though, that was along those lines?

777
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,120
It was the Mega Man one where he danced to Twinbee from 2DX.

778
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,120
I just... I kicked EOSFVB for that

779
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,120
worst Flash ever. That was so funny.

780
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,120
Oh, Rob, I actually learned the whole dance now.

781
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,120
I know the whole dance, so you'll have to play that promo when we come back.

782
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,820
all right maybe we will move

783
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,880
okay at least

784
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,560
all right yes let's do the f use of the week

00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,680

and then uh... and then might draw chat bomb rob with uh... many p m s about a

789
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,080
yeah i'd like to share is the week

790
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,400
yes tell us what you'd like to fuck i'm going back to the fact that

791
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,760
i'm not going back to the old school slag work this week just because

792
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,240
I'll have a new song after that, by the way.

793
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,280
Ooh, cool.

794
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,880
Okay, here we go.

795
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,520
Okay, my first F.U. of the week is Writer's Block.

796
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,660
Okay, actually, this sort of links back to my old one about my hard drive.

797
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,320
For people who don't know, my hard drive died. I mean, completely died. It broke.

798
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,680
And I lost

799
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,880
chapter five... Actually, I lost every fanfic I'd ever written, but really

800
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,640
importantly, I'd lost the fifth chapter of the one I'm currently working on.

801
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,720
I was like

802
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,640
twenty five hundred words into it

803
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,460
which uh... for me that's

804
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:24,220
a good bit that's actually a third of the fanfic of the chapter right there

805
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,160
the last few chapters I've written ended up topping over six thousand words a piece

806
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,740
uh... marin's in the chat room right now and says you need to write more

807
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,680
yes i'm sorry marin chan

808
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,160
oh my bad marin

809
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,120
uh... who by the way uh...

810
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:44,880
For anybody who remembers the DVR Freak Moderator strip, she's my friend that I went to lunch

811
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,380
with when we were there and hung out with.

812
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,800
She got to see me incredibly drunk at Star Trek Experience, sorry.

813
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:55,740
Anyway, on that note, I was really, really pissed off about it and didn't want to write

814
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,040
anything for like a week or so.

815
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,760
And I started writing on it again, and wouldn't you know it, I get started on it, I'm on a

816
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,520
roll, Dan's like, hey, you wanna go get food?

817
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
Let's go get food.

818
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:12,760
had some lovely French toast, and then came back, and I couldn't write. I really couldn't

819
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,080
think of anything. I was like, well what the hell can you think of? I had it really dark

820
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:22,520
before, I mean really, like, disgustingly dark. And um, I decided to take it a little

821
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,520
bit lighter, and do the really dark stuff on the last few chapters, and then I just

822
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:31,520
blanked. So, that sucks.

823
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,520
That's it? Oh.

824
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:43,520
If you go to fanfiction.net, look up Dark Sakura, my fanfics there, it's a Digimon fic. Like all my other ones there. And if you read it, leave me reviews. Reviews are special and they make me happy.

825
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,520
Yeah, fuck people who don't leave me reviews because you suck.

826
00:56:47,520 --> 00:57:03,520
Okay, my other question of the week is, well, okay, I can't really blame him for this, but you know, fuck losing my cable, because even though I don't watch TV, I occasionally like the option of watching it, so I can see Buffy.

827
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,520
Iron Chef.

828
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:12,520
No, we didn't even, I don't even like watching that, but, um, well, I like watching it when I'm with other people that don't know me.

829
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,520
It's not a BuffyCon, it's like a sci-fi con, but I'm gonna go see my man.

830
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,520
Buffy ruined the internet.

831
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,520
No! No pop-ups ruined the internet.

832
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,520
We're gonna do a list list on what ruined the internet. I think maybe that should be our topic for tonight.

833
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,020
Okay.

834
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,520
You wanna do that? Okay, we're gonna do a list list tonight, and that'll be the topic.

835
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,520
What ruined the internet? Alright.

836
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,520
Okay. Um, but uh...

837
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,520
These things are salty.

838
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,520
Buffy's pretzels, but I'll be...

839
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,520
kostjamrh Yeah, that's it. Bob, stop eating your balls.

840
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,520
kostjamrh I like my balls, they're big and fluffy.

841
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,520
kostjamrh I think we need to go to the next F.U.

842
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,520
kostjamrh Lowkey, let's hear from you.

843
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,520
kostjamrh I have no saliva because of these pretzels.

844
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:33,520
kostjamrh Need Zalavex.

845
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:34,520
kostjamrh No French kissing for you.

846
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,520
kostjamrh Anyways, ugh.

847
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,360
this weather. It has to be stupid drivers. I hate stupid drivers. I hate stupid drivers

848
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,360
to try to pull out in front of me. I hate stupid drivers to drive 40 miles under the

849
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:52,160
speed limit. I hate them. They're stupid. Especially this old bitch that was behind

850
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:58,160
yesterday going down the south watt. She's going 25 miles an hour. There's 20 cars behind

851
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:04,080
her. I was like, fuck you. So I went around her and everyone honked at her and flipped

852
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:09,640
off and try to veer off the road, so that doesn't work.

853
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,120
And after you two dial up email.

854
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,800
Fucking A, I have my Turning Mix 3 thing done, and I can't submit it because it's like, no.

855
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,400
I want a time out.

856
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
Sorry.

857
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:26,860
So, I can't, either, one way or another, my stupid file's coming online tonight, you know,

858
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:31,100
whether it be, you know, in the official judging for Turning Mix 3 or on my website.

859
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,980
One way or another, it's up there.

860
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:40,980
And yeah, I don't know. I don't have too much to go with right now because I'm happy with

861
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:44,980
pretzels. So, I'll think of something later, I'm sure.

862
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:51,980
Alright. In the meantime, my turn. Alright. First of all, F you to the rain. I know it's

863
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:56,160
needed and all, but fuck, I hate driving in it. It's the worst. It makes everybody drive

864
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,380
like an ass, and I have this intense fear of hydroplaning every time I kick up a puddle.

865
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,780
I think I'm going to die. I hate it.

866
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,780
I want a hydroplane. I've never done it before.

867
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,780
No, it sucks. It's awful. Go to hell.

868
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:11,780
I want a hydroplane, but like when no one else is around so I can like do a 720 and then keep going.

869
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,780
You're a scary man and I hope they never give you a license.

870
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:20,780
My other F.U. of the week goes to that stupid bitch at Walgreens who didn't know how to use her ATM card thing.

871
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,780
Here's a hint.

872
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:29,780
If you don't know how to use your ATM card to pay for your food, you need to fucking just go get cash and do it that way.

873
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,980
wait god

874
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:34,780
i hate people to hold up the line because they're retarded

875
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,120
get a life

876
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,620
that's it

877
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:42,300
i don't think i have any other i thought i had other easily as you do uh...

878
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,620
christmas carols i can't get away from them

879
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:47,540
now it's my turn

880
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,840
yes it is

881
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,380
and then

882
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,580

889
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,260
myself all that

890
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:09,360

891
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,140

892
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,820
i'm like no i'm doing this year's weird people hanukkah at a weird time this

893
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,260

01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,900

i'm not getting him because it's pretty

898
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:33,900
First, you gotta remember about Hanukkah. It's like, what? Christmas? When's that, huh? Did it happen yet? No? Yes?

899
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,900
Okay. Secondly-

900
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,900
Oh, Christmas is just that day you don't have to go to school or you get off work randomly.

901
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,900
Christmas is fun because it's the day before my birthday.

902
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:48,900
I get to go skiing because everyone else is going fucking eating, you know, turkey and shit.

903
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,900
Okay. Anyway, my second nephew goes to my stupid fat fucking bitch Spanish teacher.

904
01:01:53,900 --> 01:02:01,100
oh my god she must weigh like 500 pounds if you've ever seen the movie herculea is the animated one

905
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:08,540
like she looks like the titan who's the like the earth titan or whatever there's just a giant blob

906
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:15,100
of mush except the female version her ankle is bigger than my neck i kid you not and she's so

907
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:20,940
fat and she speaks in an italian accent the spanish so you can't understand a fucking word

908
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:26,700
and she's like okay kiddos remember the test today what test what okay project what and then we all

909
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:32,300
fail i have a d right now and that's keeping me from doing shit that i want to do in my mom's

910
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:39,100
moment okay i'm done all right let's hear from the chat room then

911
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:46,060
first i'm going to open up the email bag i'm going to open up the email bag because we have

912
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:56,500
We have some late FUs from last week. These come from Muhymer, who sent these in last

913
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:00,300
week for last week's show, except he must not have been in on Saturday when we were

914
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,100
actually taping the show. So we sent these in on Sunday and we weren't here. We were

915
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:08,900
running a tape. He says as much as he enjoys hearing things that piss Jamie off the whole

916
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:14,040
show, he needs to contribute his own stuff. So fuck non-individualistic people who are

917
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,680
too worried of what other people will think of them. Fuck, fuck them. Fuck my so-called

918
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,560
friends for not going to the movies with me because it was a whole ten minutes out of

919
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,800
the way. They have a DDR machine there, yay. So I had to go with only two people instead

920
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,960
of who I wanted to go with. Fuck that DDR machine at the movies because it didn't have

921
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,240
a good screen quality and it made me look suckier than I really am, which is pretty

922
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:38,320
sucky anyway. Fuck Pierce Brosnan for getting to make Sweet Lovin' to Halle Berry instead

923
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:43,900
of me. Don't forget that Billy Bob Thornton also got to make Sweet Lovin' to Halle Berry

924
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:48,600
in that movie and she was all topless and stuff too, Monsters Ball. That movie's fucked

925
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,680
up though. I've never seen a movie that made me want to kill myself, but Monsters Ball

926
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:58,680
just makes you want to die. Don't rent it, it's awful. It's not funny! How is that movie

927
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,400
funny? It was horrible! Go on Kazaa and just type in Halle Berry naked and just watch the

928
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:10,400
ten second clip. Don't rent the whole movie. Did she show her titties to die another day

929
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,320
another day or something

930
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,400
i think so

931
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,860
and most of all you know i knew that

932
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,900
i just found a picture of my man and i'm staring at him and ignoring the naked

933
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,020
halle's home

934
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:23,620
you know she went to her parents are better paid all you do it there and

935
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:27,280
google alan rickman play my fucking music

936
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,820
thank you to halle berry for ruining the character of storm and x-men thank you

937
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,900
fucked up the accent fucked up the whole movie are you saying halle berry ruined

938
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:36,780
the internet

939
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,780
No, I'm saying she would go into X-Men.

940
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:42,780
By the way, the trailer is out for X2.

941
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,780
It's looking to be good, but the bitch is still in it.

942
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,780
So fuck her for existing.

943
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:50,780
Are there snowboarders or extreme sports in that movie?

944
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:53,780
A third one, they can just call it Triple X.

945
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,780
Whoa.

946
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:58,780
I was very disappointed that that movie has no porn in it whatsoever.

947
01:04:58,780 --> 01:04:59,780
What a misleading title.

948
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:05,780
Triple X, you expect, like, you know, booby shot, something like that, but no.

949
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,540
Like the Matt Hoffman's triple X BMX or whatever that's called

950
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:14,380
I don't know if it's Matt Hoffman or but whatever that one was that one was better than triple X

951
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:17,140
I mean fuck propel propel just spit up in my face

952
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:22,360
It's it's called BMX X X and I got a copy for free on Xbox

953
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,380
Well, Dan did

954
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:33,840
I'm sorry, thanks. I'm gonna tell you what ruined x-men. I'm gonna tell you right here. What ruined x-men

955
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,840
On that note, here, this is what ruined X-Men.

956
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,840
Do you know what happens when lightning hits a toad?

957
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,840
Same thing that happens to everything else.

958
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,840
Gosh, he sucks.

959
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:49,840
Who let that get in the script? That was the stupidest thing I've heard in my entire life.

960
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,840
Delivered by the stupidest person.

961
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,840
God!

962
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,840
It was for all the eight-year-old little kids who watched the little TV show.

963
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,840
And so they can go repeat that line over and over again.

964
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,840
Well, fuck kids.

965
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,840
Fuck kids!

966
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,840
They'd be like, no!

967
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,840
Don't fuck kids!

968
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,840
What happens when lightning hits a tote?

969
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,240
Well, um, I don't know.

970
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,240
Sounded cool, though.

971
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,240
No, it was dumb.

972
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,760
If they explode, that's kind of neat.

973
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,760
Anyway.

974
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,760
Oh yes, we still have fuck yous.

975
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,760
Yeah.

976
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,680
And now we have Muhimers, this week's fuck yous.

977
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,880
Fuck my swim coaches for being lazy and dumb and whatnot, fuck lame projects, and fuck

978
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,800
the crazy DDR machine that poor Loki couldn't hack.

979
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,800
Poor Loki.

980
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,400
And he spells Loki L-O-K-I-E, which I think is really cute.

981
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,680
actually uh... i demand that we start calling you look

982
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,900
with i got i got uh... some more stuff out of there i got these public schools

983
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,200
including the uh...

984
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,360
that's kind of funny is they actually have all the sound samples from all the

985
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,260

and the logo of the special fluid logo it's going to happen

1000
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,380
What the fuck AOL?

1001
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:34,380
Can I finish with the chatroom now? No.

1002
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,220
WhackWab

1003
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:39,780
says uh... my god he's got a lot here

1004
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:44,340
uh... F you. Fuck finals, I hate finals. Fuck the rain for starting on Friday

1005
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:47,300
instead of Saturday because I had to ride my bike in the rain to both my finals

1006
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,300
on Friday.

1007
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,620
Fuck the owner of TapXpress for not unlocking the Max 2 machine after it

1008
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:53,800
was installed. God knows why he didn't do it.

1009
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:57,320
Fuck the 49ers for not winning today. Fuck allergies. Just fuck them.

1010
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,680
I missed all my classes this week before finals because I was sick.

1011
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,120
And fuck you, Grant.

1012
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:08,120
He needs to die so I can move up one rung on my girlfriend's ladder of love.

1013
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,000
Wait a minute, why aren't you number one on your girlfriend's ladder of love?

1014
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,520
That's fucked up right there.

1015
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,740
Why is there a ladder that you need to move up rungs on?

1016
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:21,080
Do you need a promotion?

1017
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:25,080
If you're not one, then you should at least be number two or three, I'm thinking.

1018
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:31,080
I mean, you sound like you're number eighteen or nineteen right now.

1019
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,080
It's bad when they say they need to settle for you.

1020
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:38,080
We're gonna get our butt kicked by Black Lab in about five seconds as soon as the buffer gets to him.

1021
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,080
You know what? I have another actress I'd like to say fuck you to.

1022
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,080
Alrighty.

1023
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:46,080
Linda Fiorentino.

1024
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,080
Cause she's so sucked in Dogma.

1025
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:53,080
That part was written for Alanis, and Alanis declined it, but then came back and said,

1026
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:59,080
No, I guess I'll be in the movie, and Kevin Smith said, Oh, well, I have a better part for you anyway, so that's why she's gone.

1027
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,080
Jeanine Garofalo should have had it.

1028
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,080
Who, God?

1029
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,080
No.

1030
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,080
Oh, that would have been cool.

1031
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,080
Jeanine Garofalo should have had it.

1032
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,080
Oh, that would have been cool.

1033
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:09,080
And they actually went back and said they should have given it to her.

1034
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,080
But no, Linda Tarantino.

1035
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,080
Anyway, keep going with Chet Room.

1036
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,080
Okay, yes.

1037
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,080
They can use my music if they want to.

1038
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:21,640

1043
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:47,200
that Halle Berry's tits are shown for ten seconds in Swordfish.

1044
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,280
And this is for people who can't get laid.

1045
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:55,240
Actually, only like four or five. Maybe six. Maybe.

1046
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:01,120
It's just like, I'm reading a book. Whoa! I don't have clothes on.

1047
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,600
That was kind of like, what's-her-name in the Thomas Crown Affair. She's kind of an

1048
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,640
older lady, but she's still, you know, considering her age, she still has some very nice looking

1049
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,840

1064
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:12,360
Of all the basics, I want to kick out an F.U. to the power in his house. I went over ten, twelve hours yesterday without power.

1065
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:15,360
And by the way, to your last thing, the answer is no.

1066
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,360
We put a question mark.

1067
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,360
Not just no, but hell no.

1068
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,360
He put a question mark. Like, I want to? I don't know.

1069
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,360
When you decide, let me know and I'll still tell you no.

1070
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:50,360
I am not seeing her in the chat room in a long time. She's always idling and somehow gets disconnected.

1071
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:02,160
asking to get back together with you

1072
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,840
i'm just laughing as black labs telling up to one of the chat room going please

1073
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,600

1074
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,520
again

1075
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,640
like a daily occurrence anyway

1076
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,160
uh...

1077
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,800
host by the way stresses says it's okay

1078
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,540
he cries and and you laughing at school so

1079
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:23,040
Oh yeah, I have another F.U. I just remembered now.

1080
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,540
No, I just think that Dan would kick his ass.

1081
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:29,540
I have an F.U. to my camera. The camera I just bought.

1082
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:32,540
Because all the pictures it takes are way too dark. That's it.

1083
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,040
I didn't even have time to change music.

1084
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,540
Maybe we should give you a flashlight to carry around with it.

1085
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,040
It doesn't matter, you can have the sun behind you and it wouldn't matter.

1086
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,040
I still got a million F.U.s to get through here.

1087
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:47,540
Brack2000 says, uh, flash flash, oh whoops.

1088
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:50,040
That was another F.U. for, er, that was a hint for earlier in the show.

1089
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:54,040
FU to EOSFBB for making him hear the catch-up song, and he cried.

1090
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,040
I thought my ears were going to bleed.

1091
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:03,040
The background song, by the way, is Cheer Train from 2DX7 style, for those that were inquiring.

1092
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,040
23rd Magus says, FU to Skrull for delaying his work on his tournaments entry.

1093
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:12,040
It was a good one, too, Invasion of the Gabba Robots, all your base.

1094
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,040
I'm sure that would have been beautiful.

1095
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,040
I should put a page on my website.

1096
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,160
the uh... three-month three entries that would have been in there for a week

1097
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,600
got lazy and in fact i want to put mine in there too

1098
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,920
uh... i'd ever finished mine either

1099
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:30,120
well i also have a nephew to my manuscript for not working with mozilla

1100
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,740
which the browser of the gods

1101
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:35,200
but screw it but bad javascript

1102
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,440
but mother nature you do not make me walk home four blocks and horizontal

1103
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,360
rain

1104
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:45,280
usf vb says fuck you today if he didn't get anything for the mystical rob epic

1105
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,280
requests, so he at least deserves an F.U.

1106
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,280
Um, what?

1107
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,280
I have no idea what they're talking about.

1108
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,280
I have no fucking idea what he's talking about.

1109
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,280
What the hell are you talking about?

1110
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:03,280
Uh, fuck you to Bobby Flay for crying like a bitch to get his rematch against Morimoto

1111
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,280
and then winning a couple of years ago.

1112
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,280
Wasn't that a... what?

1113
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,280
Dude, that was such bullshit.

1114
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:14,280
He got up, he like stood up on his little chopping board, he's like,

1115
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:19,280
I'm gonna win!" And then he got his ass beat. And then he all came back. Morimoto's like,

1116
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,280
no, he doesn't deserve to win. He disgraces himself as a chef because he stands on his

1117
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:28,280
equipment. He can still do that. And then he gets back later. They go to Japan. And

1118
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:33,280
he takes off the chopping board. And he puts it aside. And then he stands on the table.

1119
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:38,280
And it's like, okay, you're still a jackass. You're just an idiot. And then, I don't know,

1120
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:43,280
I don't know, they said that he won, but that's such bullshit. They must have rigged some shit.

1121
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,280
Because Morimoto is the king.

1122
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:16,360
just angsty little people

1123
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:20,960
uh... if you to starbucks on broadway for being so slow says skyline d c five

1124
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,600
oh five and it said it made him late to zero period

1125
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,560
i'll teach it to the starbucks

1126
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,740
the power says at the sleep because the sleeping schedules all screwed up if you

1127
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:36,680
do is what the drive since yesterday and safe mode whenever you want to put a

1128
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,680
file on a floppy disk

1129
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,640
and also if you do you grant

1130
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,660
because that

1131
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:52,180
The pig in his Animal Crossing game because he magically changed his roof color to yellow

1132
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,700
and it's been red since he started his game and now it's fucking yellow.

1133
01:15:55,700 --> 01:16:01,220
And also an F.U. to EOSFBB since he set an F.U. to Vidpower last week when Vidpower wasn't

1134
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,220
here.

1135
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,220
So, ha!

1136
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:07,900
Yeah, I had two people paint my roof in my town.

1137
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,900
That pissed me the fuck off.

1138
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:11,900
Dude, they painted mine Pepto-Bismol pink. I hate Ed.

1139
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,900
I'll get paid for this little show.

1140
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,900
That's a good...

1141
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,900
Oh God, my sight hurts.

1142
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,900
That was good.

1143
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,900
No, we don't.

1144
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,900
In fact, we pay to do it.

1145
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,900
That's the sad part.

1146
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,900
Send your checks.

1147
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,900
Send it to me.

1148
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:02,900
No, the best way you could pay us is to whore this station out to all your friends and listen all the time.

1149
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,900
We need to break our limit.

1150
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,900
Yeah, we need to break our limit.

1151
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,740
What? What? What? Jamie is loose.

1152
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:12,260
Just kidding.

1153
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:17,260
They're offering... They said we should set up a PayPal account. Well, we didn't do that

1154
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:19,020
because we don't think people would actually donate to that.

1155
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:25,220
Well, if you want to pay me, it would be NightmareHunter at yahoo.com. I have a PayPal account

1156
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:27,620
set up to send money, and I'll be appreciative.

1157
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:30,060
That was immediately followed by PayPal ruined the internet.

1158
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:34,060
paypal ruined my bank account when I had paypal

1159
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:38,060
because we were like, oh let's buy neogeo cartridges

1160
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:42,060
at $300 a piece, we can pay with paypal, it's easy and convenient

1161
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:46,060
however it did facilitate me getting Mega Man X4 on Saturn

1162
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:50,060
or Rockman X4

1163
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:54,060
get all your friends to listen to the station

1164
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:58,060
and take us out for dinner

1165
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:03,700
and play around on their website. What you can do, you can set Orange Lounge Radio to

1166
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:09,040
your very favorite radio station. And if enough people do that, then we start getting discounts

1167
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,980
from Live 365. So if you want to kind of inadvertently give us money without giving us money, go

1168
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:18,540
set Orange Lounge Radio as your favorite station on Live 365. Just go into your presets. You

1169
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:21,620
just have to add Orange Lounge Radio as a preset. And then you're going to say which

1170
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:25,300
one of your presets do you want to make your favorite station? Select Orange Lounge Radio

1171
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,380
And we're all happy campers.

1172
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:28,780
And I also do appearances.

1173
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:33,900
I don't charge that much by hours, so look me up.

1174
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,760
Yes, that's great if Orange Launch Radio is already

1175
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:37,940
in your presets.

1176
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,380
But if you want to make it your favorite preset,

1177
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:41,840
that's even better.

1178
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,580
And we love you lots for that.

1179
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:44,300
That's right.

1180
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,500
Helps us pay bills.

1181
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,860
See, I don't need to do that, because I just have a link

1182
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:51,580
or a shortcut to my desktop.

1183
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:55,580
So I don't even need to go on the I-365 for this.

1184
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,580
It sucks having a screen name for like 8 years.

1185
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:20,580
Because I get so much junk mail on it now.

1186
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:30,100
my Dark Sakura thing. By the way, you know, I have to say something that I'm going to

1187
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,020
actually retract one of my old FUs.

1188
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:37,660
Oh! Oh! Jamie is going to retract an old FU, so what do I do? Do I play Slagwort backwards?

1189
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,660
Do I play a happy song? What do I play?

1190
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:40,660
No.

1191
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:46,380
Okay. Another FU to Pepsi and pretzels because I feel like I'm going to explode.

1192
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,380
Cool, do it.

1193
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:50,380
No, um, play something happy.

1194
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:52,380
Play something happy.

1195
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:54,380
Play, um, the Changma song.

1196
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:56,380
The Changma song?

1197
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:58,380
Yeah.

1198
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:00,380
You know what, I don't think I have Changma cued up.

1199
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,380
I'm sorry.

1200
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,380
How about, um, we can play, like...

1201
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,380
We're playing old.

1202
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,380
Old? Boys?

1203
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:08,380
No.

1204
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,380
Boom Boom Dollar?

1205
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,380
My Fire? Bad Girls?

1206
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,380
Let's get down.

1207
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,380
Let's get down. Okay, this is a happy song.

1208
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,380
Alright.

1209
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:37,380
I'm retracting my F.U. about the people who sent me instant messages because now I couldn't hop on my DJ Celica. I'm going to go ahead and say it. I have a username now. I'm not going to give the full one out but it's primarily DJ Celica. That's one of my AIM names. That is not the full AIM name by the way because I'm not going to say the whole thing on the air.

1210
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:42,380
I would sign on that and get no less than 17 IMs in one sitting.

1211
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:45,380
You should have seen it during the time that Shaft was going on.

1212
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:50,380
Because I counted it during my first five minutes of being online without an away message.

1213
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:54,380
I had 30 IMs! 30! 13! I counted them!

1214
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:56,380
You're so popular.

1215
01:20:56,380 --> 01:21:02,380
So I'm actually really happy to say that I was on my name for a little while yesterday.

1216
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:09,380
I had the thing on for 10 minutes without an away message, and I didn't get a single message, so thank you.

1217
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:17,380
However, one of my other AOL names that used to go on all the time, that one's gotten better.

1218
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:22,380
There's people who are not randomly IMing me when I haven't given them the name their permission to IM me.

1219
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:30,940
Although I have to say, I took one of my names off of hiding, and lo and behold, even after

1220
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:37,380
8 years, I'm still getting 20 million messages on that name, so I put it back on hiding.

1221
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:41,500
I'm gonna go and be more specific with who I let see that one.

1222
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:46,660
And the people, by the way, who I don't mind messaging me, you know who you are, and I

1223
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:47,660
never care.

1224
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:53,660
But for all those random people who, like, I barely know or maybe see, like, you know,

1225
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:58,420
once I've seen you at, like, a tournament or something, or I haven't known you for longer

1226
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:04,780
than at least two years, you know, you know, give me a few minutes to sit on line and just

1227
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:11,380
be there for a while before you decide, oh my God, I have to talk to Jamie right now!

1228
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:12,980
Unless your house is burning.

1229
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:17,220
Unless your house is burning and then call a fireman, right?

1230
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,920
i have your fire department

1231
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:24,160
i'd never had to talk about that

1232
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:27,420
i accept that it was unfortunately

1233
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:28,440
by a

1234
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,400
a well it's a messenger

1235
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,080
thing is that sacramento low-key zero

1236
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,800
so if uh...

1237
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,120
you happen to be on there

1238
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:39,700
go ahead and i am the well wait i'm never on their haha i know this uh... that's

1239
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,600
what i do i just don't use it's a bit

1240
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,800
but i think

1241
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,800
if we're done with RFUs of the Week.

1242
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,800
Yeah.

1243
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,800
Okay, I actually have an announcement.

1244
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:48,800
Announcement.

1245
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,800
Announcement.

1246
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,800
Announcement.

1247
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:51,800
A horrible way to die.

1248
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,800
A horrible way to die.

1249
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,800
A horrible way to die.

1250
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:59,800
Rob, I'm going to hit you with a ferret.

1251
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,800
Ow!

1252
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,800
Anyway, um...

1253
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,800
I want a pretzel.

1254
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:08,800
I got a pretzel for Saha.

1255
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,800
Anyway, um, this announcement, I don't know if anyone remembers me mentioning the, uh,

1256
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:20,560
The thing based off a radio drama based off of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, there's one

1257
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:27,640
position left open we need your audition reel.

1258
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:34,960
The position left open, if I remember correctly, is the drunken zombie date.

1259
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:41,080
If you're going to audition for this, you can go ahead and send me your auditions.

1260
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:46,200
We'll send it to the Orange Lounge thing because we don't know how big the file size is and

1261
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:51,160
I really don't mind giving out my email over the web because like I said I get tons of

1262
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:54,240
spam anyway so you can send it to darksacra.aol.com.

1263
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:59,240
That was just by the way the name that's hidden from anybody ever knowing that I'm online so

1264
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,240
go ahead.

1265
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:05,400
You can buddy list that all you want to because you'll never see it but go ahead and email

1266
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:11,640
Tell me your voice acting reel, your audition to Dark Sakura at AOL.com.

1267
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:12,640
What kind of voice would that be?

1268
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,840
Is it a whiny goth boy voice?

1269
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,840
Drunken zombie date.

1270
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:16,840
Drunken zombie date.

1271
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:17,840
I think it's drunk.

1272
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:18,840
I don't know.

1273
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:19,840
Alright, so you have to be a drunken zombie.

1274
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,520
Very good, very good.

1275
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,880
And where's your audition reel?

1276
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,880
You said you were interested.

1277
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,160
I got lazy.

1278
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:32,280
Just send them something.

1279
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:36,520
We're hoping to get under, I guess we're hoping to get underway with the recording soon and

1280
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:42,040
it will be broadcast on this very radio station once we get a first episode out.

1281
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,440
And give that email address out one more time.

1282
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,800
Darksakura at all dot com.

1283
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:47,800
Beautiful.

1284
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,080
Which is funny because I had that name before there was a Dark Sakura.

1285
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,080
Cool.

1286
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,080
Yep.

1287
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:58,840
It was right after Sakura came out in Street Fighter Zero Two or Alpha Two for people who

1288
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,240
never heard of the Japanese name.

1289
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:06,380
And uh, my stalker did not make it for me, but my teacher in my classroom used to call

1290
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:08,560
me Sakura too in my Japanese class.

1291
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:14,880
So I made Dark Sakura, and then low and behold, like a year later, there was a Dark Sakura

1292
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,560
in the home release of one of the games.

1293
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,560
Kao.

1294
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,440
Yeah, that's because I'm neat, so that's the whole history of why I have that name now,

1295
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,120
but send me auditions.

1296
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:30,080
Alright we're gonna take a quick break, and we're gonna come back and do the cage match

1297
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,080
for this week.

1298
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:36,680
We didn't do a cage match last week, so we're gonna do tonight's cage match and then we'll do some more fun stuff

1299
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,300
We got a list list to get to at some point tonight

1300
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,180
So we'll do all that in a little bit

1301
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:44,320
This will be a short break because we're gonna do be doing more music during the cage match

1302
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,960
So we would just want to get up and stretch and pee

1303
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,600
Yes, Jamie pretzels any pretzels

1304
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,600
Alright, we'll be back. See ya. Orange on radio.

1305
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,600
And I'm far away on the other side

1306
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,600
She was caught in the middle of a desperate fight

1307
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,600
And she couldn't find how to push through

1308
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,600
She fell in love in the evening

1309
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,600
Carried away by the moonlight

1310
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:40,600
She had a chance of sorrow and grieving

1311
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,600
Carried away by the moonlight

1312
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,600
She had a chance of pushing through

1313
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:51,100
What's the feeling when I come Far away on the other side

1314
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:58,600
He was shot six times by his man on the run And she couldn't find how he pushed through

1315
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:08,600
I said, I said, I prayed, I'm here in heaven One day, falling in the morning

1316
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,000
Carry me away by a moonlight, shed, shed

1317
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,100
I'll watch your vision, body

1318
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:21,100
Carry me away by a moonlight, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed, shed

1319
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:55,100
So when he began to play the game

1320
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:58,100
Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been hurting

1321
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:02,100
How he was hoping she was not the same

1322
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:05,100
Could you see the kind of lady that I'm seeking

1323
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,100
After all of this time, could this be true love

1324
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:12,100
And she says, boy, you don't have to love no more

1325
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:16,100
I'll give the love you need, do you holler in the guarantee

1326
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:19,100
I'd like to love, boy, I'm a fine lady

1327
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:22,100
You've been hurt, but be sure that I am the cure

1328
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:26,100
And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

1329
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:29,100
The best day boy you know, you can count on me

1330
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:30,100
Felicity!

1331
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:33,100
You're the kind of lady, you know what you found in me

1332
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:37,100
Is a lady, the kind of lady that can give you what you need

1333
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:40,100
Maybe, a kind of lady that will never leave you lonely

1334
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:42,100
And what's the name of this lady?

1335
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:45,100
You finally set me up and I won't let you leave

1336
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,100
See how I'm feeling

1337
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,100
My heart sticks around and it's all clean

1338
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:23,100
Ain't gonna tell me nothing

1339
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:26,100
Ain't gonna shout no more deal

1340
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:30,100
It's time to say goodbye, goodbye, say

1341
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:32,100
I want you to know

1342
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,100
I'm ready to be happy

1343
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:39,100
It's my time, I need to face it

1344
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:41,100
I'll change for you

1345
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,100
You don't have to love me again

1346
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,100
Can't you see I'm going to bed?

1347
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:47,100
I'll say, who are you?

1348
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,100
I can't take you no more

1349
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,100
I'm going to get it all

1350
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:00,100
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying, who are you?

1351
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,100
Now I know what I'm feeling

1352
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:12,100
Couldn't sit down, be in touch

1353
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:15,100
I don't mean that, honey

1354
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:18,100
But you mustn't mean that, honey

1355
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:22,100
I'm living in reality

1356
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,100
I'm a loser

1357
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:27,100
So how I made up my mind

1358
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:31,100
Oh, it's part of my good thing now

1359
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:33,100
That's it for you

1360
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,100
You're the loser

1361
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,100
Well, you can't defeat

1362
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,100
You're going to lose

1363
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:43,100
Thanks for you, I can't take it no more I don't want you anymore

1364
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:49,100
Thanks for you, you don't look too well Can't you see I'm going to love

1365
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:52,100
There's a lot of things for you

1366
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,820
So I can make it over

1367
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:56,540
I don't care what you do

1368
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:03,980
You make me feel so sorry

1369
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:05,980
I can't take it anymore

1370
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:39,980
So, do you think this is the end?

1371
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:41,980
No, it's not the end.

1372
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:44,980
It's the beginning of your next journey.

1373
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:49,980
The Buh-Buh Pool Journey Part 2.

1374
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:02,980
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

1375
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:06,820
orange lounge radio

1376
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:10,100
dave's doing the dance

1377
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:17,100
dave is doing the dance wait i gotta play that one more time just so dave can do the dance

1378
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:19,300
okay here we go here we go

1379
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:23,180
easier to dance to than that freaking catch up song

1380
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:25,940
orange lounge radio

1381
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:29,060
that's the best part cause that looks like ricky martin right there

1382
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:33,060
It's like he's doing the Latino pada-pada.

1383
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:37,060
Later on, even though you can't see it, I'm just going to do it anyway.

1384
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:41,060
I said, screw you. You can't even see what I'm doing.

1385
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:45,060
I like that. EOSFBV. Spider-Man does the dance.

1386
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:49,060
That looks stupid, though. Later on, all the girls

1387
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:53,060
go like this.

1388
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:57,060
And for anyone who couldn't see, he just shook his hips in rhythm.

1389
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:01,620
Problems here. What's going on? Loki's flipping off my roommate's computer. What's your problem? Oh

1390
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:09,160
Net zero. Do you want me to submit it for you? Like okay, Jamie's gonna do it. Okay, we're trying to submit Loki

1391
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,160
Oh, I just burp that was gross burp

1392
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,120
We're trying to submit Loki's attorney mix 3 entry right now

1393
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:18,960
You'd F you to net zero because they suck ass and their servers are slow as ass

1394
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,580
How many his ass is an adjective from now?

1395
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:32,940
I suppose this is the portion of the show where we should get into another little thing

1396
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:42,980
that we do here every week, and that is the Orange Lounge Cage Match, everybody.

1397
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:47,580
Last week in the Cage Match, actually two weeks ago, we didn't do it last week because

1398
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,740
we did a pre-taped show.

1399
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:56,620
So last week's winner of the cage match, a couple weeks ago was, I'm trying to find it,

1400
01:33:56,620 --> 01:34:02,620
I can't find it, it was the Knight Rider theme. Done all happy hardcore style. Now remember

1401
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:08,740
the way the, I'm sorry, not happy hardcore, but like, it's happy style. I guess is the

1402
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:11,780
way, what you'd call it. Let me play, I'm going to play a little clip of that for you,

1403
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:14,500
this is all you're going to hear, because we only play a clip of the winner from last

1404
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:19,860
week, so here it is. This is last week's winner, winner. I love the chair, it's so beautiful.

1405
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:23,460
I don't do real radio. This is last week's winner, the Knight Rider theme, a little clip

1406
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:24,460
right here for you.

1407
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:25,460
And now...

1408
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:53,460
It sounds like it's doing the same thing.

1409
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:55,460
That's the part everybody knows.

1410
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:01,460
Alright, that was last week's winner.

1411
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:04,460
The Knight Rider theme done all redone.

1412
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:06,460
Wait, I have one more F you.

1413
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,460
Yes, Dave. You're a little late.

1414
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:13,460
I know, I know. I forgot about it. I had thought about it like on Wednesday.

1415
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:15,460
I was like, damn, I need to, okay.

1416
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:18,460
I got kicked out of Jamie's chair.

1417
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:20,460
Technically it's Brian's chair, but I claim it.

1418
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:24,220
Yeah, you don't have to get music or whatever.

1419
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:26,660
I'm killing up the first contender.

1420
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:27,660
So good.

1421
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:29,660
I'm wasting time.

1422
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:34,900
F you to all the people who think that everyone who goes to the gym is just compensating for

1423
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:38,580
a small penis, because that's not true.

1424
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:40,380
Where does that come from?

1425
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:45,900
I like going to the gym, because I am weak, but lots of people who don't go to the gym

1426
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:51,340
It's like, oh, you stupid people just go to the gym because you have penis envy or whatever.

1427
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:54,220
Rob's looking at me like a madman.

1428
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:55,220
I'm just confused.

1429
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:57,940
I don't like the gym, but I don't think it's a penis thing.

1430
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:01,620
I like going when there's guys there wearing tight bike shorts.

1431
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:02,620
Not you.

1432
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:05,620
He does his little pose.

1433
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:10,220
All right, back to the K-Smash.

1434
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:14,640
I don't think you would get a date, especially if they saw you doing your little ketchup

1435
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:19,560
chicken dance

1436
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:24,000
sorry about this I'm I'm trying to find a particular part of this song

1437
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,260
no, don't pose please, don't pose

1438
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:27,960
okay

1439
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:30,580

1440
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:32,920

1451
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:16,180
me think of, like, old women in MooMoos. They're all frow-frow.

Shut up. But this, no, this song rules. I love this song. Alright, we're actually gonna

1454
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:28,740
this is a remix of it that's a little more DER-happy-ish, and it's a remix by DJ Encore,

1455
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:33,860
who, uh, has another song. Breathe Out. Yeah, no, it's just the, uh, Breathe In remix by

1457
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:40,580
What's about a, the beginning of a song by Bush? What, Breathe In?

1458
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:43,580
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in.

1459
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:44,580
That was Machine Head.

1460
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:46,580
Got a machine head.

1461
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:47,580
Got a mushy head.

1462
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:48,580
Got a mushy head.

1463
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:49,580
Okay, okay, here we go.

1464
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:51,580
This is the first contender, you can vote for it,

1465
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:55,580
but we will not accept any votes until both songs have completely played.

1466
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:57,580
So you can vote for either the Knight Rider theme or you can vote for this.

1467
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:02,580
This is Frow Frow with the DJ Encore mix of Breathe In here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1468
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:03,580
I'm sorry that's not where it's supposed to start.

1469
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:06,580
It's supposed to start right in here.

1470
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,580
Here we go.

1471
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:14,580
this is a proper out

1472
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:52,580
And I'm high enough from all the way To ride a wave on your way

1473
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:59,580
Cause I love you And I have a lot of love for you

1474
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:23,580
Cause I love you And I don't wanna love you

1475
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:30,580
Only word, hard love Don't you understand, I've told you before

1476
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:37,580
It's just air, off my case This isn't happening, to stop this now

1477
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:45,580
And I'm, breathing in Feelin' so innocent, from the past, yeah

1478
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:52,580
And I'm all your love from all the ways To ride away when you're spinning

1479
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:55,580
And I know you lost my own way

1480
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,580
You're right away on your way

1481
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:02,580
Cause a love you love

1482
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:05,580
Can't help but love you

1483
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:56,340
Cause I love you, I have got love for you

1484
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:54,700
Alright, that was Frow Frow with the DJ Encore remix of Breathe In in the cage match.

1485
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:59,700
So next question we gotta ask is, what did you guys think of that one?

1486
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:00,700
Well...

1487
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:01,700
Dave?

1488
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:07,700
I thought that it was pretty good, but it was kinda long, I mean, it almost...

1489
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:10,700
It is six minutes, but I cut out the first minute.

1490
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:11,700
I started, that's why I started.

1491
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:17,200
I mean, it was still a little long, but I really think that it would go much better

1492
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:23,700
without the lyrics, because they just kind of brought it down and made it sound corny,

1493
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:27,700
Alright, that's fine. Jamie, what did you think of Frau Frau?

1494
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:31,700
It reminded me of Beast Forest. Cool!

1495
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:35,700
I wanted to take a nap. Loki, what did you think of Frau Frau?

1496
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:39,700
Uh, the voice was annoying. Hey, I love Imogen, she rules.

1497
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:43,700
She's not Anya! I had to go to the bathroom, so I thought I had to be Anya.

1498
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:47,700
And of course, I loved it. Love, love, loved it, because I love Frau Frau.

1499
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:51,700
Alright, scale of one to ten. Jamie? Six.

1500
01:43:51,700 --> 01:44:01,700
Matt, Loki. I'll go for six. Dave. Seven. I give it a ten, it's perfect. Diva. Alright.

1501
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:08,700
Did you just call me a diva? I like it. Alright. Here we go, here's the other song we're gonna put in the cage match.

1502
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:12,700
So we got the Knight Rider theme, we got Frow Frow with Breathe In and this, Loki, please introduce us.

1503
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:18,700
Okay, this is another Overclock remix done by Final Fantasy Music DJ.

1504
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:23,700
Now, okay, I have to warn you guys, it does have a really strange intro and ending to it,

1505
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:27,700
just because this is a birthday gift to someone.

1506
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:33,700
So, it'll get into the song, but just don't be thrown off by the annoying voices in the very beginning of it.

1507
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:37,700
But it's an awesome remix of the Airship theme from Final Fantasy VII.

1508
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:39,700
Alright, so here it is, another Final Fantasy remix.

1509
01:44:39,700 --> 01:45:06,700
Hey, buddy! Happy birthday!

1510
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:15,700
Guess what? I made you a remix of Sam's theme! Let me sing it for you!

1511
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:27,700
Waaah! Waaah! Waaah! Waaah! Waaah! Waaah! Waaah!

1512
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:34,700
Sounds like someone's, like, pleasuring themselves.

1513
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,700
Oh

1514
01:48:57,700 --> 01:48:59,700

1559
01:51:56,620 --> 01:51:58,500
We love getting mail, don't we all?

1560
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:01,300
No, because I get nothing but spam.

1561
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:02,300
Well don't, yeah, don't send us spam.

1562
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:03,300
I like good mail.

1563
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:04,900
You send spam, fuck you.

1564
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:05,900
Send money.

1565
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:06,900
Alright.

1566
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,800
Oh, we had somebody vote for the Animal Crossing theme.

1567
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:13,500
That's not one of your choices in today's, maybe next week's Cage Match, but not tonight.

1568
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,500
We'll play that once more tonight.

1569
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,500
We have another Animal Crossing song.

1570
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,500
That song is good.

1571
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,500
We'll save it for later.

1572
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:24,500
Do Animal Crossing music cage match.

1573
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:27,500
Dude, K.K. Kaspo would win because that's my favorite.

1574
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:29,500
No, it's all about Lucky K.K.

1575
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:33,500
You know Riverdance and Animal Crossing.

1576
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:36,500
SkylineDC505 says,

1577
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:39,500
Isn't it too late to enter Tourney Mix 3?

1578
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:42,500
No, I just missed the deadline by half an hour.

1579
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:45,000
You mean you got the deadline. I got the deadline by just a half an hour.

1580
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,500
So, half an hour.

1581
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:53,000
Very good, very good. So what kind of things were you considering when you made your DWI?

1582
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,500
What kind of things was I considering?

1583
01:52:54,500 --> 01:53:00,000
What went into it? How did you pick the song? How did you design the steps? How did you do the background?

1584
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:07,500
Okay, the song I picked actually was my second choice, because I had a first choice, which is Alien World from 8th Style.

1585
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:11,500
I still have that halfway done. I just decided, no, I like the song better.

1586
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:15,500
So I picked that song. It's a bit succinct because the second part of the song,

1587
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:19,500
the whole song kind of slows down as it's going through, gradually,

1588
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:23,500
but I had to edit it down, and the second half of the song,

1589
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:27,500
or second third, last third of the song, there we go,

1590
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:31,500
is 128.036 BPM.

1591
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:35,500
It's exact. The problem is though,

1592
01:53:35,500 --> 01:54:04,500
The background took me maybe 10-15 minutes to do, I did it all in Photoshop, looks pretty.

1593
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:26,500
The steps I finished just before I got here for the show, I finished the heavy steps. There's a part in it where it goes down the half speed in the middle and then it comes back up to 128.

1594
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:34,500
During the half-speed part, there's a 30-second note thing going on there, so it's kind of hard to read, but it's all synced.

1595
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:46,500
I don't know, they're pretty fun. It kind of plays like an era, but a little bit more complicated, so just try it out. It'll be fun. That's about it.

1596
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:55,500
Word. What do you think are going to be the big sim files to watch out for, the big artists or the big creators out there that are going to have some good stuff?

1597
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:58,500
Well, I don't think Bimani ruler is putting anything in this time.

1598
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:03,500
So, they probably just have CMCM do something.

1599
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:07,500
Then, Kamenkey makes a lot of stuff.

1600
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:11,500
V to X, whatever, does a lot of stuff.

1601
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,500
I don't really know. There's a lot of people that know.

1602
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:16,500
Or, DDR Master F might see something from him.

1603
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:20,500
Moogle Hunter, definitely.

1604
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:24,500
Just, I don't know. It's always surprising because you'll see people that you've never heard of.

1605
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:28,800
and then just all of a sudden they'll come out with something pretty cool, so it's really hard to tell.

1606
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:34,800
I can't wait until they have an actual list of what's on there, then you'll kind of see with the tryout.

1607
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:41,000
I was going to enter, but I got lazy, so I'll enter a make it a get porn instead or something,

1608
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,700
even though I don't want any of the porn that Mookie's giving away.

1609
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:50,000
He had a really cool, you know, oh I made a really cool background for his song, and then he doesn't go and finish it.

1610
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:55,000
I finished the basic and trick steps. I just only got about three measures into the maniac steps, so whatever.

1611
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Eh. Fuck contests. Fuck them right in the ear. I'll just release it because I'm cool.

1612
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:06,000
It doesn't have to be. I don't have to whore it out under any contest. I'm me, damn it.

1613
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,000
We'll have a special contest. It's called the...

1614
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Sky owns you at Sim Files, so nobody wins except Sky.

1615
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I could run a tourney mix, but I just don't have the web space.

1616
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Well, yeah, but you wouldn't want to rip off a big idea, anyway.

1617
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Make it a get-porns-cooler, anyway.

1618
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
But, see, here's the thing.

1619
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
You know how they were going to have a special category where you actually have to pay to get in?

1620
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Uh-huh.

1621
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
They were going to have prizes?

1622
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
They aren't having that no more.

1623
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Oh, that's a bummer.

1624
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
No one entered.

1625
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Oh!

1626
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
No one entered.

1627

Go figure.

1630
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000

So we're going to start off with the Freshness in India Amazing Mix.

1646
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,960
This is from DCB and his remixes are always very interesting.

1647
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:30,200
DCB had a very cool one the other day.

1648
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:33,400
He had a remix of Happy Meal that we played on a fuck-off that ended with the theme to

1649
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:39,160
Hey Dude, which was like the coolest Nickelodeon show ever.

1650
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:40,160
Hey Dude.

1651
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:41,700
Wait, let me see if I can find it.

1652
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:42,700
Hold on, hold on.

1653
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:49,700
I'm gonna go to the end of the Happy Meal Evil mix here, just so I can play this.

1654
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:07,780
That show is the shit!

1655
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:12,340
Loki's turning this shade of red I've never seen before from laughing so hard at that.

1656
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:15,020
Okay, DCB, I've got a challenge for you.

1657
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:16,140
Okay, DCB,

1658
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:20,060
if you do this, I swear to God, we'll put it in a cage match, we will get it in rotations

1659
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:20,680
somehow,

1660
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:22,800
I want you to do a remix

1661
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,420

the old school you can't do that on television theme.

1663
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:30,380

Well, I thought I had another one even somewhere.

1688
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:49,220
This was going to be a paranoia remix until I said, nah, it doesn't really sound that good.

1689
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:54,160
Shit, my bad. I don't think I have it yet, because your other CD's going, alright, so maybe we just won't play a Loki original, I guess?

1690
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:54,760
We'll play that one.

1691
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:57,640
Alright, we'll play that one. Okay, we'll do a Loki remix. It's called Shadow Style.

1692
01:59:57,640 --> 01:59:58,800
Okay, so here we go.

You can hit the rock and you can hop the track.

02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:55,200
Come on and let your body flow.

1697

Hey there, it's your friend, Omega Skin, warning you to listen to Orange Clown every Sunday.

I will personally come to your house and do a nori nori nori routine, and believe me,

1709
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:08,480

02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:14,920
So remember, listen to Orange Realm, because I don't want to have to have ANY land to suffer

uh... let's see

1717
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:49,560
We're going to do a list list soon, but we've got to prepare our list, so we've got to hold off on that for a little bit.

1718
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:54,660
But they will be the top three things that ruined the internet, so we'll be talking about that later.

1719
02:08:54,660 --> 02:08:55,760
Umm...

1720
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:58,060
But now, let's see, do I have any other topics that we'll...

1721
02:08:58,060 --> 02:09:02,560
Oh, we need to announce the Cage Match winner, that's one thing we need to talk about.

1722
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:03,960
That's right.

1723
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:08,360
Orange Launch Cage Match, the song, that will be in rotation all next week.

1724
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:11,660
The winner, ladies and gentlemen...

1725
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:17,660
Two weeks in a row, the Knight Rider theme has won the Orange Lounge Cake Match.

1726
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:19,660
Guess what? Guess what? Ha ha ha ha!

1727
02:09:21,660 --> 02:09:27,660
I will knock the Knight Rider theme down next week. Mark my words, it'll be gone!

1728
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:31,660
You wish.

1729
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:36,660
Now we do have a rule though, that how many weeks do we say? Four weeks? Three?

1730
02:09:36,660 --> 02:09:37,660
A month.

1731
02:09:37,660 --> 02:09:44,040
The song can't be in for more than a month or it's got we retire it we get Carson daily out here to retire your song

1732
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:47,160

1733
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Next week, he'll be Tom's greens

1734
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:57,600
Piggy hill I'm gonna throw the piggy down the hill

1735
02:09:58,100 --> 02:10:01,760
I'm gonna throw the piggy down. I'm gonna throw the piggy down

1736
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:04,640
I'm gonna throw the piggy down the hill that for about five minutes

1737
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:11,560
I'm just going to trump all you fuckers and put in the legend, because we already know

1738
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:14,760
the legend is popular on this station.

1739
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:18,820
We try to keep the Bimani Music Amore show a little clean, because we know people listen

1740
02:10:18,820 --> 02:10:24,880
to it at work, so we don't have fucks and shits during the Bimani Music Amore program.

1741
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:30,000
But since Sunday night you're here listening to this program, we know you're not at work.

1742
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,640
So we cuss all we want.

1743
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:34,200
Isn't that right, Dave?

1744
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:37,560
Fuck, cut, shit, balls, cunt, lick, ass, pussy.

1745
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:40,200
Thank you. That was amazing.

1746
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:41,200
Skillfully done.

1747
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:44,400
I'm no match for Brad.

1748
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:47,300
Are you preparing your list for Listless now while I'm just sitting here ranting?

1749
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:47,700
Yes.

1750
02:10:47,700 --> 02:10:51,100
Okay, great. Then we won't have to take another break. We'll just be able to go

1751
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:53,160
right into Listless. I have to think about mine.

1752
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:58,060
So, let's play one song while we prepare our list, shall we?

1753
02:10:58,060 --> 02:11:02,900
We'll play one quick song. It's gotta be something fun. Let's see.

1754
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:02,920
doo doo doo doo doo doo...

1755
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:04,600
Instant love!

1756
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:07,780
Okay! Everybody loves instant love.

1757
02:11:07,780 --> 02:11:08,680
Instant love.

1758
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:10,240
That's a good idea.

1759
02:11:10,240 --> 02:11:11,080
Instant voo.

1760
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:12,680
Alright we'll be right back with The List List,

1761
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:18,420
top three things that ruined the internet, right after this.

1762
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:22,260
Hey everyone! This is DJ Konami!

1763
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:24,740
I know you all know BeatMania,

1764
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:28,200
but I want to go back and teach you the basics.

1765
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:31,680
Listen carefully and try to follow!

1766
02:11:31,680 --> 02:11:33,680
The object will come down from the trunk.

1767
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:36,680
When it hits the red line, push the button.

1768
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:37,680
Yeah!

1769
02:11:38,680 --> 02:11:41,680
When it hits the red line, turn the table.

1770
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:45,680
You get it? Alright, let's practice.

1771
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:48,680
First, hit the white key.

1772
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:55,680
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

1773
02:11:55,680 --> 02:12:12,680
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

1774
02:12:12,680 --> 02:12:14,680
Both white and black keys.

1775
02:12:24,680 --> 02:12:25,680
Easy, huh?

1776
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:28,680
Alright, let's go on to the scratching.

1777
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:32,680
When the objects reach the red line, scratch!

1778
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:36,680
And if you think it's fun playing with you, boy, you're better

1779
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:41,680
With a fast note, the technique is to scratch fast

1780
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:52,680
Now it's all the keys and the turntable

1781
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:55,680
It's hard, but you can do it

1782
02:12:55,680 --> 02:13:21,680
Ok, F-Exercise! Here's the spec of the new BeatMania!

1783
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:24,680
Look, way below, do you see the first switch?

1784
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:28,680
That's the effect of an on switch.

1785
02:13:28,680 --> 02:13:31,680
With this trimmer, you can choose your effect.

1786
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:36,680
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

1787
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:42,680
Hey, do you hear the variety of effects?

1788
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:48,680
With this trimmer, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

1789
02:13:48,680 --> 02:13:55,680
This powerful sound system will make everybody hot!

1790
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:59,680
Alright, gotta go! Knock me out with your fabulous sound!

1791
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:23,680
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1792
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:28,680
The server made a bit of fighting ahead of us. The server made a bit of fighting ahead of us.

1793
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:37,680
Hello, we're back. Sorry we had to take another break so fast here, but we were unprepared for our list list, so we want to make sure we got that all done.

1794
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:38,680
We're prepared now.

1795
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:45,680
We're prepared now. We've come prepared. As opposed to coming unprepared, which is, you know, messy. Anyway.

1796
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:47,680
Oh, lovely! Hello!

1797
02:14:47,680 --> 02:15:05,680
Oh, I gotta find some background music, though. I know Jamie brought us plenty of background music to start using. Oh, we have another visitor? Is that for us? Let's see, we shall see. Matt, go get the door.

1798
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:06,680
I bought some fun music.

1799
02:15:06,680 --> 02:15:11,680
Now, I know you did. I saw some things that we could do. Oh, wait. Am I looking in the cookie? No, I'm looking in the wrong directory.

1800
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:13,680
Uh, I thought you had...

1801
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:18,680
Oh, Dave's parents are here already, I guess.

1802
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:19,680
Uh-oh.

1803
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:22,680
Oh, they're pulling Dave away from us.

1804
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:24,680
Oh, no, they're pulling Dave away. What are we going to do about list lists?

1805
02:15:27,680 --> 02:15:28,680
Really?

1806
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:31,680
Tell him to leave his list here, because we've got to do his list.

1807
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:32,680
His list is here.

1808
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:34,680
Is his list still here?

1809
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:35,680
His list is here.

1810
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:40,680
We'll have a member from our chat room vote for us.

1811
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:43,680
Okay, we'll have a person from the chat room vote for us.

1812
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:46,680
Or maybe we'll just all pile together and see which one we all agree on.

1813
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:47,680
No, he's still here.

1814
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:48,680
Oh, he's still here.

1815
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:54,680
Can I just read my top three real quick?

1816
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:56,680
Who's going to eliminate one?

1817
02:15:56,680 --> 02:15:59,680
We'll have somebody from the chat room. We'll call somebody and have them eliminate one.

1818
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:00,680
Okay.

1819
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:01,680
My top three.

1820
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:04,680
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. I've got to get the theme here. Hold on, hold on.

1821
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:07,680
I'm going to recycle this theme from last week because it's all I've got.

1822
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,680
It doesn't matter.

1823
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:10,680
Okay, hold on, here we go.

1824
02:16:10,680 --> 02:16:12,680
Okay.

1825
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:19,680
My top three are random people who I am.

1826
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:23,680
Chain letters.

1827
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:26,680
And porn sites that say that three is up there.

1828
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:28,680
I can't say that.

1829
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:29,680
I'll say it later, well.

1830
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:31,680
Okay.

1831
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:33,680
And, I gotta go.

1832
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:36,680
You did it my first time.

1833
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:37,680
Bye!

1834
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:40,680
Dude, he took one of mine.

1835
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:43,680
Later, Dave.

1836
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:49,680
We're gonna make a special surprise phone call to one of our listeners to have them pick something to eliminate off the list.

1837
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:50,680
We'll do that later.

1838
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:52,680
Don't start sending me your phone numbers.

1839
02:16:52,680 --> 02:16:55,680
I already have the person picked out that we're gonna call, so just shut up.

1840
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:58,680
I still have to think of the number too, because he took mine.

1841
02:16:58,680 --> 02:17:05,680
All right, we'll read those again. Is Dave and his parents gone, so I'm going to read some of these.

1842
02:17:05,680 --> 02:17:08,680
Would you poke your head out the door, please, real fast, Matt?

1843
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:10,680
There it goes, okay.

1844
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:12,680
Those top three, once again, from Dave.

1845
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:15,680
Random people who instant message you.

1846
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:17,680
Chain letters.

1847
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:21,680
And porn sites that say that they're free, but they really aren't.

1848
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:23,680
Just in case you missed those. Okay.

1849
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:26,680
So now, let's get back to the three of us here.

1850
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:32,480
It keeps my inserts out, my bad.

1851
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:34,160
Alright, uh, Jamie.

1852
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:36,680
Number three? Your number three choice, please.

1853
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:37,760
Microsoft.

1854
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:43,480
Microsoft ruined the internet. Yeah, because of all their, um,

1855
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:48,160
you know, the MSM you can't delete from your computer, and all of their little

1856
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:50,600
sending them all your crap.

1857
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:53,360
I guess I should say spyware.

1858
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:56,820
Microsoft in particular.

1859
02:17:56,820 --> 02:18:00,380
Microsoft in particular ruined the internet. Next, Loki.

1860
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:04,580
What ruined the internet? Number three.

1861
02:18:04,580 --> 02:18:09,980
Forty-year-old men pretending to be eighteen-year-old women.

1862
02:18:09,980 --> 02:18:12,700
I have a funny story about...

1863
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:17,980
Forty-year-old men pretending to be eighteen-year-old women. Yes, please tell your story.

1864
02:18:17,980 --> 02:18:22,980
This is when my fiance had just gotten online. He was using my friend Julie's account and she had a Catwoman name.

1865
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:29,980
And this guy propositioned him, thinking it was a woman for sex.

1866
02:18:29,980 --> 02:18:31,980
You know, like cyber.

1867
02:18:31,980 --> 02:18:36,980
So what they did is ended up taking him into the I.M. and talking about power tools the whole time.

1868
02:18:36,980 --> 02:18:39,980
The guy was like, so what do you want to do first?

1869
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:42,980
And Dan replies, I have a circular saw.

1870
02:18:43,980 --> 02:18:45,980
Do you like jib saws?

1871
02:18:45,980 --> 02:18:49,980
I have a reciprocating saw the whole time.

1872
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:19,980
website that I believe ruined the internet, and that website is GeoCities.

1873
02:19:19,980 --> 02:19:24,760
You mean GeoCities? I believe that GeoCities ruined the internet

1874
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:30,260
by allowing any dumb fuck to have a home page. Some people should not have web pages. Some

1875
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:34,800
GeoCities pages are cool, admittedly, although the banners fuck them up, you know, their

1876
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:37,140
little pop-up thing that they have on the right.

1877
02:19:37,140 --> 02:19:41,160
DJ Bads? Yeah, I know, I know. There's some cool things

1878
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:19,160
As in, people who write fanfics and do fanart that I don't agree with, for lack of a better

1879
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:20,160
description.

1880
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:25,820
Like, people who do crossover fanfics.

1881
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:31,660
And I'm not talking about good crossovers, but people who do really bad ones, like things

1882
02:20:31,660 --> 02:20:38,900
that could not ever happen or, you know, again, I write fanfiction, that's fine, but just

1883
02:20:38,900 --> 02:20:45,020
like the Internet is a haven for bad writers. It's a haven for good writers, too, but you

1884
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:48,780
really have to look through a lot of shit to find it. And then there's people who put

1885
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:55,620
up their art and they obviously haven't spent any time pricing. And I understand if maybe

1886
02:20:55,620 --> 02:21:00,620
you're learning and you're improving, but I've seen sites of people whose art gets continuously

1887
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:06,500
worse. And then I am me saying, oh, well, my picture's better than yours. Those are

1888
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:11,220
the people that I hate, and the internet is just a haven for me. Not that I discourage

1889
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:15,660
writing, not that I discourage fan art, but I'm talking about the people who post it with

1890
02:21:15,660 --> 02:21:21,020
the superiority complex.

1891
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:24,500
Going back to GeoCities, because Dark Tetsuya wanted to point out that his website's on

1892
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:30,780
GeoCities. Again, you're part of that cool 2%. Don't worry. I'm just saying 98% of the

1893
02:21:30,780 --> 02:21:32,380
GeoCities webpages, they're ass.

1894
02:21:32,380 --> 02:21:37,880
Hey, my first time was on Geocities. My dark stock was mostly Evil Shrine.

1895
02:21:37,880 --> 02:21:40,380
But compared to what you have now, was it as...

1896
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:42,380
It was actually decent for a hand...

1897
02:21:42,380 --> 02:21:43,880
For its time. It was ahead of its time.

1898
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:45,880
For HTML done in WordPad.

1899
02:21:45,880 --> 02:21:50,880
Alright. Fair enough. Okay. As long as you didn't use that auto generator. Alright. You're cool.

1900
02:21:50,880 --> 02:21:52,880
This is bullshit. I either used that or Dreamweaver.

1901
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:54,880
Alright. Good. Good girl. Alright.

1902
02:21:55,380 --> 02:21:57,380
Then we had Bad Fandom.

1903
02:21:57,380 --> 02:22:01,380
And now Loki's number two pick, what is that?

1904
02:22:01,380 --> 02:22:05,380
Um, I guess I can go with, okay fine, whatever.

1905
02:22:05,380 --> 02:22:09,380
The lack of e-prostitutes. You can buy everything online but women.

1906
02:22:09,380 --> 02:22:13,380
What the hell? You can buy a wife.

1907
02:22:13,380 --> 02:22:17,380
You can buy a wife? I don't want a wife.

1908
02:22:17,380 --> 02:22:21,380
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I, wait a minute, wait a minute. We have to research this now.

1909
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:28,380
up

1910
02:22:28,860 --> 02:22:33,780
and i'm i'm looking up all dot i'm looking at my old uh... friends

1911
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:34,820
from uh...

1912
02:22:34,820 --> 02:22:35,580
all i guess

1913
02:22:35,580 --> 02:22:36,420
is this it

1914
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:37,540
i think this is it

1915
02:22:37,540 --> 02:22:40,540
i'm looking up all the friends of the funny ranch from under station live i'm

1916
02:22:40,540 --> 02:22:42,520
trying to find their website

1917
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:46,460
and i'm trying to see if we can see i easy online reservations

1918
02:22:46,460 --> 02:22:52,260
you can't get a profit you can reserve a prostitute on the internet

1919
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:55,420
different that's like making a reservation at what's going on by the

1920
02:22:55,420 --> 02:22:59,300
freedom of thought i don't know how i don't know

1921
02:22:59,300 --> 02:23:02,360
you what you want to cite this actually the simple of the hot damn it i'm

1922
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:04,420
getting all these pop-up ads

1923
02:23:04,420 --> 02:23:05,660
the fact that

1924
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:09,540
now i don't know

1925
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:11,380
like uh... red octane you know

1926
02:23:11,380 --> 02:23:14,580
you can't are you comparing

1927
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:19,420
red octane to prostitution. Hey, it could be okay. You pay a certain amount of money

1928
02:23:19,420 --> 02:23:23,300
for like a monthly fee, they send a woman to your house with a shipping label. You know

1929
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:27,260
when you're done with her and then you ship her off? The site you're looking for is called

1930
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:37,260
realdolls.com. Oh my god. Can I actually sit in the same room with you every Sunday? Alright,

1931
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:43,260
my number two pick for Thing That Ruined the Internet. Oh god, this is a good one. Number

1932
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:55,040
or two thing that ruined the internet? ICQ. ICQ, back in the day, was alright. I mean,

1933
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:59,600
it was one of the first instant messaging programs before cool ones like Yahoo showed

1934
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:07,400
up. And AOL, even though AOL is kind of crappy now, AOL instant messenger is still cool.

1935
02:24:07,400 --> 02:24:14,600
But ICQ is like the shithole of IMs, it's like the program that people who don't know

1936
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:16,880
how to use any other instant messenger program use.

1937
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:24,080
I cannot stand ICQ, I get the weirdest messages from people on ICQ, I don't use ICQ anymore

1938
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:27,400
because of random people on ICQ.

1939
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:33,200
If I have one more 16 year old woman from Brazil emailing me over ICQ wanting me to

1940
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:39,120
go to some website to see your boobs. I'm going to scream. Dude, I need to get on ICQ.

1941
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:43,920
I mean, ICQ constantly sends you ads, and now it's all, like, added out and stuff, and

1942
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:47,200
they sold it out to the man. So then I stopped using ICQ a long time ago.

1943
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:51,080
Ever since ICQ sold out, they've sucked. ICQ ruined the Internet.

1944
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:56,640
Well, I have my number one. All right, let's hear Dark Sakura's number

1945
02:24:56,640 --> 02:25:01,480
one thing that ruined the Internet. Lazy typing. As in people who use the letter

1946
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:14,680
you instead of writing Y-O-U or PLZ for please. I don't mind lead, but I've also put for lazy

1947
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:22,480
writing too. I want to add in Asian typing too. I don't mind lead, but I really, really

1948
02:25:22,480 --> 02:25:27,480
hate all the rest of it because it makes people look ignorant. There are people who, if they

1949
02:25:27,480 --> 02:25:33,240
start typing that way to me, I'll be like, type English, you know. I will completely

1950
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:37,320
ignore them. I'll be like, I'm sorry, but I wasn't aware that the letter U stands alone

1951
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:43,320
as its own word. You know, I'll go check it on dictionary.com and post them a link and

1952
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:45,440
everything, so I hate it.

1953
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:50,440
Alright, so lazy and Asian typing. You know that's funny because it's very similar to

1954
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:54,240
my number one, but I think my number one's a little different. It's different enough.

1955
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:58,240
Alright, Loki, your number one thing that ruined the internet, and he's already laughing.

1956
02:25:58,240 --> 02:26:02,240
Mac users!

1957
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:06,240
Leave it at that.

1958
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:10,240
Oh, shit!

1959
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:14,240
Do you care to back that up? Because I think somebody's going to have a severe problem with this.

1960
02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:18,240
Actually, I kind of wanted to change one of mine on there.

1961
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:22,240
Okay, we can go back a little bit.

1962
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:28,080
users ruin the internet? Because they have their stupid iPods and their iMacs and their

1963
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:34,360
rounded computers that all they are good for is connecting to the internet. You know, toasters

1964
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:43,360
are only good for making toast, so they're really not that far from a toaster. Oh shit

1965
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:47,160
that was funny. Okay, Jamie, you want to change one of yours now? I actually rethought my

1966
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:53,040
my bad fandom one, because everyone has to start somewhere, and bad fandom just encourages

1967
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:54,480
people to go look for the good stuff.

1968
02:26:54,480 --> 02:26:55,480
Alright, and you know what?

1969
02:26:55,480 --> 02:26:57,400
I was actually going to take that off the list anyway, so...

1970
02:26:57,400 --> 02:26:59,280
So I'm going to change it to pop-up ads.

1971
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:01,480
Pop-up ads, alright.

1972
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:05,520
Yeah, because pop-up ads need to be on there, so we're getting rid of bad fandom and putting

1973
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:06,520
on pop-up ads.

1974
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:08,920
You're going to need the negative to encourage people to look for the positive, and everybody

1975
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:13,080
had to start somewhere, so I retract it and apologize.

1976
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:14,080
Okay.

1977
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:16,240
Black Lab's having a fit in the chat room, this is great.

1978
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:18,240
I know, I did that on purpose.

1979
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:20,240
Oh, you did it on purpose just to piss him off?

1980
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:22,240
You ass!

1981
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:24,240
You're cool.

1982
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:26,240
I'm just gonna have a third one, so...

1983
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:30,240
You know, by the way, we might have a special in-studio guest, Black Lab, here next week.

1984
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:34,240
I was just kidding, Black Lab, I'm taking it off as my pick to remove from the list.

1985
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:35,240
Alright, alright, alright.

1986
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:36,240
Just don't worry.

1987
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:37,240
We'll get to that later.

1988
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:38,240
We'll get to that later, we'll get to that later.

1989
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:39,240
I wanted to take it off.

1990
02:27:39,240 --> 02:27:41,240
Can I read number one? Can I do my number one?

1991
02:27:41,240 --> 02:27:42,240
Alright, alright, alright.

1992
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:45,240
Number one thing that ruined the internet, in my opinion.

1993
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:48,120
the caps lock key

1994
02:27:48,120 --> 02:27:51,700
god yes

1995
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:54,740
i'm sorry where the music

1996
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:57,600
the caps lock key ruined the internet

1997
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:59,360
don't ever use it

1998
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:00,520
ever

1999
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:03,240
the only time you can use it is if you're me and you're doing the listless

2000
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:04,240
segment

2001
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:06,120
like i'm doing right now

2002
02:28:06,120 --> 02:28:09,860
that's the only time you can ever use the caps lock key

2003
02:28:09,860 --> 02:28:14,000
otherwise you shift that way you don't type in all caps

2004
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:19,000
If I see one more person at my work typing caps, I'm going to cry.

2005
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Here, you can change mine if you want for Mac users to MIDI music that plays when you go to web pages.

2006
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Alright, so we're changing Mac users now? Geez, alright.

2007
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Except my old Dark Soccer page has MIDI's that play, but that was because at the time that was cool.

2008
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:36,000
GeoCities, by the way, will not let me take down that page.

2009
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:39,000
It's still up there, my old Dark Soccer page.

2010
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
That's cool, why won't they let you take it down?

2011
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I have no idea, I can't. It was actually after Geocities and Yahoo did their little, you know, they screwed it and, you know, spawned something. So I haven't been able to log into my old accounts.

2012
02:28:53,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Have you noticed all the commercials for Yahoo? Like, they promote Yahoo as a meeting place for, like, the scum of the Earth. You've got, like, the dating ad with people with big hands and that really ugly chick that's an astronaut.

2013
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,800
I mean, they just show ugly, nasty people they're on Yahoo.

2014
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:13,400
Who'd want to be on Yahoo with all these freaks?

2015
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:16,200
So you're saying Yahoo ruined the internet?

2016
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:17,800
Yahoo.

2017
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:21,080
Internet commercials ruin the internet, OK?

2018
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:22,160
Too late, we have our list.

2019
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:23,000
Let's read the list.

2020
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:23,960
Here we go.

2021
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:25,720
This is the list as it stands currently.

2022
02:29:25,720 --> 02:29:29,840
Random people who IMU, chain letters, porn sites that

2023
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:33,920
say they're free but really not, Microsoft, 40-year-old men

2024
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:41,640
pretending to be 18-year-old women, geocities, pop-up ads, lack of e-prostitutes, ICQ, lazy

2025
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:46,600
typing or Asian typing, MIDI music that plays when you go to websites, and the caps lock

2026
02:29:46,600 --> 02:29:47,600
key.

2027
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:52,140
So, that all being said, Jamie, what is coming off this list?

2028
02:29:52,140 --> 02:29:53,140
What ain't so bad?

2029
02:29:53,140 --> 02:29:54,640
Lack of e-prostitutes.

2030
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:55,640
Lack of e-prostitutes.

2031
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:59,920
Cause I don't really give a care about sluts.

2032
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:04,920
Alright, anything else you want to say with that, or just, you don't like sluts?

2033
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:06,920
I don't like sluts.

2034
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:09,920
Okay, I'm getting an early vote already. It is not time to vote.

2035
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:12,920
DZB, your vote doesn't count.

2036
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:16,920
You have to wait, because that thing you voted for might come up.

2037
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:19,920
You get smacked with the ferret.

2038
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:24,920
The ferret's over here. Oh, you're doing a slash me?

2039
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:26,920
Forget it.

2040
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:28,920
She just took the keyboard.

2041
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:30,920
Now we have to wait for Jayden to...

2042
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:32,920
Alright, I can do mine because I already...

2043
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:33,920
Oh, you already know what it is?

2044
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:35,920
Yeah, mine has to go...

2045
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:40,920
I'm going to take off the porn sites that say they're free but really aren't,

2046
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:42,920
because free porn sites are like the fountain of youth.

2047
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:43,920
They don't exist.

2048
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:50,920
You just don't know where to look.

2049
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:56,520
a look. There's no such thing as free porn sites. There are back doors to porn sites.

2050
02:30:56,520 --> 02:31:05,160
Whoa, back doors. Happy hacker dot com. Happy dash hacker dot com. Persian kitty dot com.

2051
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:09,640
I believe. Double x password dot com. Anyway, this is a thing. I'm usually bullied by man

2052
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:24,120
me man porn? Is it free? Yes. It's all boys and boys though, but anyway. I used to have

2053
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:28,480
a DVD, but I got rid of it pretty quickly once I got it. It was one of those free Vivid

2054
02:31:28,480 --> 02:31:36,960
DVDs that they gave me. I don't get them anymore, but... Alright. Oh, I'm sorry, back to Listless.

2055
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:40,960
Oh yeah, I gotta take that off. Porn sites say they're free, but really not.

2056
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:42,880
And that comes off the list.

2057
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:45,200
My turn to take something off the list.

2058
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:51,320
I'm going to take off, um...

2059
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:54,040
I'm going to take off MIDI music that plays when you go to websites.

2060
02:31:54,040 --> 02:31:57,520
Because one of my old websites also had a MIDI song that played in the background. Fuck you, they're cool.

2061
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:02,680
Mine played Street Fighter MIDI. Mine played Tori Amos.

2062
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:12,680
Alright, fine, I should just reiterate. Actually, MIDI music's not that bad. I don't like it, it's annoying, but I hate the sites that make you download MP3s to get into the site.

2063
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:14,680
Yeah, I agree. That's stupid.

2064
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:16,680
What's that, like a porn thing?

2065
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:21,680
Oh, that's what I was trying to play, MIDI music. All you have to do is hit stop, and it, you know.

2066
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:24,680
Actually, that's Good Cool's site. That does that.

2067
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:25,680
Really?

2068
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:30,680
Bad Good Cool. Bad. Oh no, not Good Cool. It was Ryo Nagumi. Or, Nagumu.

2069
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:41,680
Alright, now I'm going to try this phone thing, and we've all had really bad experiences with this in the past, so I'm going to call someone who I'm pretty confident is listening to the show.

2070
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:48,680
And I'm a little upset that Loki took the Mac user's thing off the list, because this would have been an exciting telephone conversation if that were the case.

2071
02:32:48,680 --> 02:32:57,680
Rob, why don't you get one of those car hookups for your phone, and then you can plug it into the microphone thing here, and then everyone can hear it.

2072
02:32:57,680 --> 02:32:59,680
Because that's too easy!

2073
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:02,680
Julie's going to be giving us a real phone hookup.

2074
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:06,680
Actually, that's a really good idea. Yeah, we're going to be looking into the phone hookup thing. Don't worry about it.

2075
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:09,680
But for now, we don't have that, so here we go.

2076
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:13,680
Let me place that phone call here.

2077
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:25,680
That was a lovely film.

2078
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:27,280
Oh, it's not this. I almost...

2079
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:28,280
Yeees.

2080
02:33:28,780 --> 02:33:30,280
Hello, Black Lab.

2081
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:31,480
Hello.

2082
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:32,680
Can you hear us fine?

2083
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:34,080
Yeah.

2084
02:33:34,280 --> 02:33:36,480
Do you have anything you want to say to Loki, first off?

2085
02:33:37,480 --> 02:33:38,680
Yeah, Loki.

2086
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:40,280
I don't need you, man.

2087
02:33:42,180 --> 02:33:42,880
I can...

2088
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:46,280
If I were there right now, I'd whip out a whole sheet of information

2089
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:48,480
that I can shove in your face and put it here on.

2090
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:50,080
Alright, the cell phone...

2091
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:51,280
I was gonna defend you.

2092
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:55,080
The cell phone thing sounds like crap, so we can't stay on this too long,

2093
02:33:55,080 --> 02:34:00,460
But do you do you need me to read the list for you? Do you already have something that you want to come off the list?

2094
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:08,660
All right, here is random people who instant message you chain letters

2095
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:10,860
Microsoft

2096
02:34:10,860 --> 02:34:13,460
40 year old men pretending to be 18 year old women

2097
02:34:13,460 --> 02:34:22,460
women, Geocities, pop-up ads, ICQ, lazy or asian typing, and capswap key.

2098
02:34:25,460 --> 02:34:31,460
I think what's going to go is the chalers because I don't get many of them and the ones

2099
02:34:31,460 --> 02:34:36,460
that I do get I just delete right away because I know that if it says porn on it, it's just

2100
02:34:36,460 --> 02:34:37,460
crap anyway.

2101
02:34:37,460 --> 02:34:41,460
So you're saying people should stop being lazy and set up an email filter?

2102
02:34:41,460 --> 02:34:44,460
Yeah, that's why they're there.

2103
02:35:11,460 --> 02:35:14,860
Oh, I see. Are you mocking this segment? Is that what you're doing?

2104
02:35:14,860 --> 02:35:18,460
No, it's just I think it's more entertaining to pick really weird shit

2105
02:35:18,460 --> 02:35:21,460
instead of actual serious answers because everyone else has

2106
02:35:21,460 --> 02:35:24,660
the same answers I would have used. So, there.

2107
02:35:24,660 --> 02:35:29,500
Okay, you can vote now during our listless segment. We're gonna take one last break.

2108
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:33,340
Read off the list one more time. Oh yes, of course we're gonna read off the list one more time.

2109
02:35:33,340 --> 02:35:36,580
Just gotta post it in the chat room. Here it is. Okay, here's what we have. You ready? Yes.

2110
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:41,020
Random people who I am you, which I hate, Microsoft.

2111
02:35:41,020 --> 02:35:44,700
40-year-old men pretending to be 18-year-old women, GeoCities,

2112
02:35:44,700 --> 02:35:48,060
pop-up ads, ICQ, lazy typing or

2113
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:52,340
asian typing, and caps lock key.

2114
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:57,180
So vote. Alright, vote now. 9 p.m. Send me a private message in the chat room

2115
02:35:57,180 --> 02:36:00,460
or email. Or you can send it over email real fast

2116
02:36:00,460 --> 02:36:04,820
and we'll count those votes up. Oh, that reminds me, I got a late F.U. over email too.

2117
02:36:04,820 --> 02:36:08,060
I gotta get to that when we come back. We'll take a quick break and then come back.

2118
02:36:08,060 --> 02:36:08,420
What?

2119
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:13,840
I hope that's not for me. I don't think so. We had one come from somebody else

2120
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:16,940
listening to the show. I forgot to read it, but we'll get to it.

2121
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:20,940
So, top three things that ruin the internet when we come back from this

She's a goddess of the wind

2132
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:15,840
The Bonnie Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.

2133
02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:22,840
We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen,

2134
02:41:22,840 --> 02:41:26,840
draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.

2135
02:41:26,840 --> 02:41:30,840

2158
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:38,660
for stuff that was in Second Mix or BeatMania Substream, or 2DX Substream.

2159
02:42:38,660 --> 02:42:40,660
Cool. Old stuff.

2160
02:42:40,660 --> 02:42:43,660
Old school stuff. You know, maybe go up as far as Second Style.

2161
02:42:43,660 --> 02:42:46,660
Ooh. So it's going to be old.

2162
02:42:46,660 --> 02:42:47,660
Old school.

02:42:47,660 --> 02:42:51,660

All right, number three, Jamie, what ruined the internet?

2167
02:43:02,660 --> 02:43:09,660
Jami, what is the number two thing that ruined the internet?

2168
02:43:10,860 --> 02:43:17,860
Pop-up ads. Pop-up ads suck. Go to hell. And the number one thing that ruined the internet?

2169
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:24,940
Lazy typing or AZN typing. Which I find incredibly funny because they were all my picks.

2170
02:43:24,940 --> 02:43:25,940
Were they really?

2171
02:43:25,940 --> 02:43:26,940
Yes, they were.

2172
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:31,500
Shit, Jamie is the winner today.

2173
02:43:31,500 --> 02:43:35,340
Although there's some other things to get a vote, and some interesting things that were

2174
02:43:35,340 --> 02:43:40,580
said in the chat room, things we didn't put on the list at all, USFVB suggested that Orange

2175
02:43:40,580 --> 02:43:43,260
Lounge, in fact, ruined the internet.

2176
02:43:43,260 --> 02:43:44,860
Harry Potter websites.

2177
02:43:44,860 --> 02:43:45,860
No!

2178
02:43:45,860 --> 02:43:46,860
You ass!

2179
02:43:46,860 --> 02:43:52,860
Excuse me, wait a minute, you gave me Alan Rickman movies, so I'm not going to kick

2180
02:43:52,860 --> 02:43:54,860
Thank you, but I'll hit you with the ferret.

2181
02:43:57,860 --> 02:43:59,860
Darktetsuya says, the ferret ruined the internet.

2182
02:44:04,860 --> 02:44:06,860
What else ruined the internet here? I don't know.

2183
02:44:07,860 --> 02:44:12,860
Suggestions. Chat room, give me your suggestions for what other things ruined the internet that we forgot to say.

2184
02:44:12,860 --> 02:44:13,860
Target.com.

2185
02:44:13,860 --> 02:44:14,860
Target.com?

2186
02:44:14,860 --> 02:44:15,860
eBay.

2187
02:44:15,860 --> 02:44:17,860
eBay. Why did eBay ruin the internet?

2188
02:44:18,860 --> 02:44:20,860
Because it makes me spend all my money.

2189
02:44:20,860 --> 02:44:25,860
Actually, Half.com has been taking up more of my money lately because I've been finding laser discs.

2190
02:44:25,860 --> 02:44:28,860
I think a good one would be LiveJournal, ruin the internet.

2191
02:44:28,860 --> 02:44:30,860
No, I like that.

2192
02:44:30,860 --> 02:44:36,860
You know what sucks is I have the money and I have the actual, I just don't have the space.

2193
02:44:36,860 --> 02:44:40,860
I could have bought a BeatMania Complete Mixer 500.

2194
02:44:40,860 --> 02:44:41,860
Dang.

2195
02:44:41,860 --> 02:44:44,860
I would have stored it for you.

2196
02:44:44,860 --> 02:44:47,860
Eh, it's a little late now though. I'll wait when I move out.

2197
02:44:47,860 --> 02:44:50,660
We had another vote that twin ruin the internet.

2198
02:44:50,660 --> 02:44:53,200
Gay porn sites ruin the internet.

2199
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:54,660
I don't think so.

2200
02:44:54,660 --> 02:44:57,140
Priceline.com ruin the internet.

2201
02:44:57,140 --> 02:45:02,860
Animalcrossing.com ruin the internet. William Shatner ruined the internet.

2202
02:45:02,860 --> 02:45:05,200
There is no Animalcrossing.com.

2203
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:10,020
Animal-crossing.com, sorry.

2204
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:11,560
What else ruin the internet?

2205
02:45:11,560 --> 02:45:14,860
You know what ruin the internet? DDR Freak.

2206
02:45:14,860 --> 02:45:16,000
No!

2207
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:23,240
just kidding, I know you're a mob there. Damn straight, I'm damn skippy. Yeah, shouldn't

2208
02:45:23,240 --> 02:45:32,440

2209
02:45:32,440 --> 02:45:39,360
ruin the internet. Hey! By the way, if Maple's listening, check your Neopets account and

2210
02:45:39,360 --> 02:45:46,360
add me as your friend or I won't send you any dung.

2211
02:45:47,360 --> 02:45:51,360
Yes, I have Neopets. I'm on there as DJ underscore Celica.

2212
02:45:51,360 --> 02:45:55,360
Battle.net ruined the internet? Pokemon ruined the internet.

2213
02:45:55,360 --> 02:46:00,360
Oh, this is a good one. This is great. Oh, Vidpower gets mad props for this one.

2214
02:46:00,360 --> 02:46:05,360
Hamsterdance.com ruined the internet. The dancing baby.

2215
02:46:05,360 --> 02:46:07,360
Hamster Dance definitely ruined the internet.

2216
02:46:07,360 --> 02:46:09,360
Ultima Online.

2217
02:46:09,360 --> 02:46:11,360
Oh, fucking EverQuest.

2218
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:14,360
How did we leave EverQuest off of our list?

2219
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:16,360
I'm still pissed at Ragnarok.

2220
02:46:16,360 --> 02:46:18,360
EverQuest completely ruined the internet.

2221
02:46:18,360 --> 02:46:21,360
It not only ruined the internet, it ruined real life.

2222
02:46:21,360 --> 02:46:27,360
I'm still mad, though, at Gravity for Ragnarok Online

2223
02:46:27,360 --> 02:46:30,360
and making it where I can't play anymore.

2224
02:46:30,360 --> 02:46:33,360
If they were reliable, maybe I could play again

2225
02:46:33,360 --> 02:46:35,900
and get my goggles back

2226
02:46:35,900 --> 02:46:38,440

no shockwave is good because shockwave is good

2230
02:46:48,100 --> 02:46:52,060

2242
02:47:21,180 --> 02:47:22,100

2243
02:47:22,100 --> 02:47:24,300
river with the internet

2244
02:47:24,300 --> 02:47:28,300
internet cafes through the internet for allowing anyone to get dot coms are in

2245
02:47:28,300 --> 02:47:30,160
the internet

2246
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:32,160
The web ruined the internet.

2247
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:34,160
People ruined the internet.

2248
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:36,160
Stupid people.

2249
02:47:36,160 --> 02:47:40,160
Which, by the way, stupid people ruined everything.

2250
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:48,160
And, you know, I find it very funny for those people who, when you're going on fan art sites, trying to download fan art, you right-click to save a picture and they go,

2251
02:47:48,160 --> 02:47:50,160
Oh, you can't do that, blah, blah.

2252
02:47:50,160 --> 02:47:52,160
So I just save page.

2253
02:47:52,160 --> 02:47:54,160
Yeah, I know, stupid people.

2254
02:47:54,160 --> 02:47:56,160
Or if they have it where you can't save the pages.

2255
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:58,160
You go to view their web source.

2256
02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:05,160
any knowledge of how to use their computer in a graphics editor, it's called print screen.

2257
02:48:05,160 --> 02:48:06,160
That works.

2258
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:09,560
I wanted to end it on that note that people ruin the internet, but there's just too many

2259
02:48:09,560 --> 02:48:11,720
good ones that are still coming in.

2260
02:48:11,720 --> 02:48:13,560
People did ruin them.

2261
02:48:13,560 --> 02:48:16,080
Final Fantasy Online is going to ruin the internet.

2262
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:19,000
They're doing that on, no.

2263
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,160
Yes, Final Fantasy Online.

2264
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:25,560
You know what, PSO is going on, it's already out in Japan on PC.

2265
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:28,320
Xbox Live will ruin the internet.

2266
02:48:28,320 --> 02:48:32,480
Okay, Xbox Live has ruined my life, okay?

2267
02:48:32,480 --> 02:48:39,800
I'm trying to sleep, and Dan's playing freakin' that mecha assault game, and I'm here about

2268
02:48:39,800 --> 02:48:42,880

By the way!

2289
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Okay, SoCalCakes wants us to get on a positive note here and talk about what improved the internet.

2290
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Porn.

02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000

I mean porn.

2294
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
Google improved the internet?

2295
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Yes, Google, the only unbiased search engine.

2296
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,940
they refuse to take

2297
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:22,460
to put people higher who pay them more

2298
02:50:22,460 --> 02:50:24,900
they are an unbiased search engine

2299
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:28,240
they're funny, they have their search engine in Klingon, okay?

2300
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:29,940
and Swedish Chef

2301
02:50:29,940 --> 02:50:33,540
seriously, go under the language preferences and look at the list of languages

2302
02:50:33,540 --> 02:50:36,320
you can browse in Esperanto

2303
02:50:36,320 --> 02:50:38,900
that's brilliant

2304
02:50:38,900 --> 02:50:40,360

2305
02:50:40,360 --> 02:50:42,860

Hey! Stop looking at me!

2327
02:51:46,380 --> 02:51:51,380
Alright, uh, I had one more F.U. We never got to read.

2328
02:51:51,380 --> 02:51:55,380
So, shit, where's that F.U. music I had earlier for our chat room?

2329
02:51:55,380 --> 02:51:56,380
What's something random?

2330
02:51:56,380 --> 02:51:59,380
Here we go. I had it.

2331
02:51:59,380 --> 02:52:02,380
Stand by to bitch! Yay!

2332
02:52:02,380 --> 02:52:10,020
F-persons from Hicktown I don't know that made me 4-1 screwing me out of a medal at

2333
02:52:10,020 --> 02:52:14,620
my wrestling tournament and my Mac my dad gave me an early Christmas present and I book

2334
02:52:14,620 --> 02:52:15,620
Woo-Fucking-Who.

2335
02:52:15,620 --> 02:52:17,340
That's exactly what the email says.

2336
02:52:17,340 --> 02:52:19,540
That came from Martin Tan.

2337
02:52:19,540 --> 02:52:20,540
Thank you.

2338
02:52:20,540 --> 02:52:21,540
You know what?

2339
02:52:21,540 --> 02:52:25,620
I've decided something that I want the tournament to do for me or all of our listeners.

2340
02:52:25,620 --> 02:52:27,340
Oh, you have a command.

2341
02:52:27,340 --> 02:52:28,340
Yes.

2342
02:52:28,340 --> 02:52:36,140
Do you still have a link to that sorting quiz that I gave you?

2343
02:52:36,140 --> 02:52:42,300
If you can remember the first few... It was a virtual Hogwarts... No, just do a

2344
02:52:42,300 --> 02:52:44,380
search for it on Google.

2345
02:52:44,380 --> 02:52:48,300
I'm rather curious because I'm still in my little fan phase right now.

2346
02:52:48,300 --> 02:52:53,060
I want to see where everybody in the chat room would find themselves sorted.

2347
02:52:53,060 --> 02:52:56,700
So I want them to take the sorting quiz that is the best one ever.

2348
02:52:56,700 --> 02:52:57,700
Is it Hogwarts?

2349
02:52:57,700 --> 02:52:58,700
Is it this one?

2350
02:52:58,700 --> 02:52:59,700
Hogwarts?

2351
02:52:59,700 --> 02:53:00,700
This one?

2352
02:53:00,700 --> 02:53:01,700
This one?

2353
02:53:01,700 --> 02:53:02,700
Seven Dragons?

2354
02:53:02,700 --> 02:53:03,700
That one?

2355
02:53:03,700 --> 02:53:04,700
Okay.

2356
02:53:04,700 --> 02:53:05,700
We're going to post a link in the chat room and I want everyone to take it.

2357
02:53:05,700 --> 02:53:09,180
And when it asks you to pick your preference for a house, pick no preference.

2358
02:53:09,180 --> 02:53:10,180
Yeah.

2359
02:53:10,180 --> 02:53:11,180
I want to see where it puts you.

2360
02:53:11,180 --> 02:53:14,860
So, you're going to do this, you're going to say, there's a little link on there that

2361
02:53:14,860 --> 02:53:15,860
says...

2362
02:53:15,860 --> 02:53:16,860
Get sorted.

2363
02:53:16,860 --> 02:53:17,860
Get sorted.

2364
02:53:17,860 --> 02:53:18,860
Click here to be sorted.

2365
02:53:18,860 --> 02:53:20,520
It's on the left column.

2366
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:24,700
At the very end of the quiz, it'll ask you if you have a preference for a house.

2367
02:53:24,700 --> 02:53:26,220
Click no preference.

2368
02:53:26,220 --> 02:53:27,220
It's right underneath the press.

2369
02:53:27,220 --> 02:53:30,340
Because if you've seen the recent movies, you'll know that if you have a preference,

2370
02:53:30,340 --> 02:53:31,340
that's what you're going to get.

2371
02:53:31,340 --> 02:53:35,860
By the way, twins, shut up.

2372
02:53:35,860 --> 02:53:39,140
You wonder why you're on my computer.

2373
02:53:39,140 --> 02:53:40,140
I got Slytherin, by the way.

2374
02:53:40,140 --> 02:53:41,580
I took this test and I sorted it into Slytherin.

2375
02:53:41,580 --> 02:53:43,900
I always get Slytherin.

2376
02:53:43,900 --> 02:53:46,700
Black Lips says he already took it and he's in Ravenclaw.

2377
02:53:46,700 --> 02:53:51,620
You're a nerd.

2378
02:53:51,620 --> 02:53:55,180
Make sure it's this test that you took.

2379
02:53:55,180 --> 02:53:59,200
this test and find out where you get sorted. Don't tell us in the chat room, we're not

2380
02:53:59,200 --> 02:54:05,880
going to tell you there. Email it to the Orange Lounge Radio, and we'll make a tally, or post

2381
02:54:05,880 --> 02:54:09,580
it in the live journal. When we get back from Bobo, I'll put up a link in the chat. SoCal

2382
02:54:09,580 --> 02:54:15,940
Kicks wants you to know he loves you, by the way. Aw, I love you too. Alright, so go take

2383
02:54:15,940 --> 02:54:20,600
that test, email OrangeLoungeRadio at Yahoo.com and let us know where you were sorted, because

2384
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:23,360

your final thought of the day

2389
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:50,000
I'm going home and working my website because, I don't know, I have nothing to do.

2390
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:55,080
I did my work for the week.

2391
02:54:55,080 --> 02:54:59,280
Jamie's furiously trying to kick.

2392
02:54:59,280 --> 02:55:06,280
I know you're waiting for your edits. I just haven't gotten around to it.

2393
02:55:09,200 --> 02:55:11,960
Alright, now that that's over,

2394
02:55:11,960 --> 02:55:13,560

2397
02:55:21,840 --> 02:55:24,400

2398
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:25,160
and uh...

2399
02:55:25,160 --> 02:55:25,940

2402
02:55:34,040 --> 02:55:36,200

2403
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:37,360
the forewarned

2404
02:55:37,360 --> 02:55:39,140
maya

2405
02:55:39,140 --> 02:55:44,220
Dextrive died. By the way, if anyone happens to find a Dextrive anywhere in their town...

2406
02:55:44,220 --> 02:55:45,560
I have a spare.

2407
02:55:45,560 --> 02:55:46,660
Okay, I want it.

2408
02:55:46,660 --> 02:55:48,220
I'll pay you five bucks for it.

2409
02:55:48,220 --> 02:55:50,300
Jamie had that look on her face when, uh,

2410
02:55:50,300 --> 02:55:51,800
Loki took the microwave, like,

2411
02:55:51,800 --> 02:55:56,860
you asshole! And then, like, all of a sudden when Loki said that, she was like, oh, nevermind.

2412
02:55:56,860 --> 02:55:59,680
You live for now.

2413
02:55:59,680 --> 02:56:02,900
Uh, DarkSakurai, he has them, they're up, they're just not linked.

2414
02:56:02,900 --> 02:56:04,660
I have new ones.

2415
02:56:04,660 --> 02:56:08,260
Cool. We can get some mine up there, too. Wouldn't that be neat?

2416
02:56:08,260 --> 02:56:11,700
My final thought of the week is

2417
02:56:11,700 --> 02:56:15,300
I hate people that I go out on dates with. I hate them all.

2418
02:56:15,300 --> 02:56:18,520
And besides, you can have the results

2419
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:20,340
or the winners from my

2420
02:56:20,340 --> 02:56:25,060
make-edit-get-porn contest. They're all Max USA edits. Whee!

2421
02:56:25,060 --> 02:56:26,960
Oh, okay.

2422
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:31,900
I should enter that just for the hell of it. You should.

2423
02:56:31,900 --> 02:56:36,060
I'll send the porn to my brother. He's in the military. He needs it.

2424
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:38,900
That hard up, huh? I mean...

2425
02:56:38,900 --> 02:56:42,060
Wait a minute. That's not what I meant to say.

2426
02:56:42,060 --> 02:56:46,740
My brother's a marine, and he's living in San Diego.

2427
02:56:46,740 --> 02:56:48,620
Interesting.

2428
02:56:48,620 --> 02:56:50,100
Okay, I guess that's it.

2429
02:56:50,100 --> 02:56:51,660
You have to point out...

2430
02:56:51,660 --> 02:56:56,460
Is the fortune cookie in the directory all by itself, Jammie? Okay, then we'll have that all taken care of.

2431
02:56:56,460 --> 02:57:00,300
I guess that's it. We'll see you next week when we're going to do our holiday wrap-up.

2432
02:57:00,300 --> 02:57:02,920
And... this one? Okay.

2433
02:57:02,920 --> 02:57:05,320
And uh...

2434
02:57:05,320 --> 02:57:07,320
That'll be it.

2435
02:57:07,320 --> 02:57:09,320
And then we're going to do a tape show on the 29th?

2436
02:57:09,320 --> 02:57:10,320
I did my final thought!

2437
02:57:10,320 --> 02:57:12,320
