00:36.000 --> 00:59.160
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching case of her case.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.600
Kiss my dress, mooge.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.600
Mecha, lecha, hi, mecha, hi-dee-ho

01:03.600 --> 01:05.600
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public

01:05.600 --> 01:07.600
Me too!

01:07.600 --> 01:08.600
Fuck are ya?

01:08.600 --> 01:09.600
I'm working on it

01:09.600 --> 01:10.600
Loser

01:10.600 --> 01:11.600
Lame

01:11.600 --> 01:13.600
I'm the sound of my face

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
Breathing

01:14.600 --> 01:15.600
Breath

01:15.600 --> 01:16.600
Heaving breath

01:16.600 --> 01:17.600
Heaving

01:17.600 --> 01:18.600
Whatever

01:18.600 --> 01:21.600
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut

01:21.600 --> 01:24.600
While I go listen to my written experience records

01:24.600 --> 01:26.600
Da da da da da da

01:26.600 --> 01:29.600
I am your singing solid ground

01:30.400 --> 01:35.420
Somewhere inside the state of California in the great nation of the United States of America on the planet Earth

01:35.420 --> 01:37.620
The Orange Lounge radio is now on the air

01:37.880 --> 01:44.260
You're tuned into the bimani scenes newest and greatest radio station of all things bimani. My name is Rob Roberts

01:44.260 --> 01:46.160
But you might know me better as sky

01:46.160 --> 01:50.560
Not with me tonight as our lovely co-host Jamie Summers aka dark Sakura

01:50.720 --> 01:56.220
Jamie is currently browsing the hallways of the big anime Expo convention in Southern California actually probably on the way home

01:56.220 --> 01:58.720
We have a substitute teacher for you tonight.

01:58.720 --> 02:03.220
Everyone say hello to the lovely Irene, or as some simply call her, the Rice Princess.

02:03.220 --> 02:04.220
Hi kids.

02:04.220 --> 02:07.220
Co-hosting for us once again, filling in for the second week in a row.

02:07.220 --> 02:08.220
Yes, that's true.

02:08.220 --> 02:10.220
I apologize for the late start there.

02:10.220 --> 02:12.220
It took us a while to get started.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.220
We spilled some water.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.220
We had a hazard spill when the show started.

02:15.220 --> 02:17.220
It was a flood.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.220
We're doing the show under water tonight.

02:20.220 --> 02:23.220
And then I realized the microphones weren't even on.

02:23.220 --> 02:28.220
So tonight's just a crazy-ass night already, but that's okay.

02:28.220 --> 02:33.220
I'd like to introduce all the other guests we have for you tonight, because we actually have a manageable amount of people in the house tonight.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.220
So everybody say hello to Brad.

02:35.220 --> 02:36.220
Hello to Brad.

02:36.220 --> 02:39.220
You got anything to say, Brad?

02:39.220 --> 02:40.220
No.

02:40.220 --> 02:41.220
You tried burping, didn't you?

02:41.220 --> 02:45.220
Everybody say hello to Dave over there.

02:45.220 --> 02:46.220
Hi.

02:46.220 --> 02:47.220
Hi.

02:47.220 --> 02:49.220
And then say hello to Matt, also known as Loki.

02:49.220 --> 02:50.220
Hello.

02:50.220 --> 02:52.220
Alright.

02:52.220 --> 02:57.220
This is episode number three for July the 7th of 2002.

02:57.220 --> 03:02.220
We'll be talking to all our guests a little bit later, but first a quick break.

03:02.220 --> 03:04.220
Do you have any other thoughts for us, Irene?

03:04.220 --> 03:06.220
I'm mad at Taco Bell, but...

03:06.220 --> 03:08.220
We'll get into that a little later.

03:08.220 --> 03:12.220
We've got all sorts of crap on the plate for you tonight.

03:12.220 --> 03:16.220
The Solo 2000 stuff, when will it end? Never.

03:16.220 --> 03:19.220
A review of the brand new StepMania that's out,

03:19.220 --> 03:23.220
and talk about DDR emulators and whether they're any good or not.

03:23.220 --> 03:29.220
Anupamani game being location tested right now, and all sorts of other crap coming up for you.

03:29.220 --> 03:35.220
But first off, I'm going to dedicate this first song, if you're listening out there, Travis over at understationlive.org,

03:35.220 --> 03:38.220
who says I never name his show by name, so there you go.

03:38.220 --> 03:42.220
A lovely show which I co-host on Saturday nights at 6.30.

03:42.220 --> 03:45.220
I'm dedicating this song to you because I know it's your favorite. Enjoy!

03:45.220 --> 03:48.220
Sorry, could I make the music louder?

03:48.220 --> 03:49.220
Yeah, drop the bong!

03:51.220 --> 03:52.220
Just drop the bong!

03:53.220 --> 03:56.220
I'm kind of dizzy because of my dreams.

03:56.220 --> 03:58.220
Gotta think it's hard to find the right system

03:58.220 --> 03:59.220
Now or never, it's the time to insist

03:59.220 --> 04:01.220
It's easy to blast you all away

04:01.220 --> 04:03.220
Or trigger fixes for the same audio to today

04:03.220 --> 04:04.220
Don't get me wrong, I'm a pacifist

04:04.220 --> 04:06.220
The mind can't do more than it fits

04:06.220 --> 04:07.220
Explosives that are not what it takes

04:07.220 --> 04:09.220
You know that terrorism always needs a mistake

04:09.220 --> 04:11.220
All we gotta do is build momentum

04:11.220 --> 04:12.220
If you need the right tools and inventions

04:12.220 --> 04:14.220
Ride the waves, time to copy the rhythm

04:14.220 --> 04:15.820
The market futures, we can't get with it

04:15.820 --> 04:17.020
The bakers generate all my

04:17.020 --> 04:19.020
If I really do it now, you're master's night goes to sowing

04:19.020 --> 04:20.420
Yeah, so ready to take their fall

04:20.420 --> 04:22.820
It's up to you to make that call to a proper fall

04:24.820 --> 04:26.020
Yeah, a proper fall

04:28.020 --> 04:29.220
A proper fall

04:31.020 --> 04:32.420
Let me see their fall

04:36.420 --> 04:38.020
Look at the first place, can't put a plan

04:38.020 --> 04:39.620
We've never been to big old great red

04:39.620 --> 04:41.820
This is all gonna be perfect for what's now to come

04:41.820 --> 04:45.820
We got to just build momentum If you need the right tools, then vent it

04:45.820 --> 04:48.820
Right away is the time to compute the rhythm The march to futures, we gonna get with it

04:48.820 --> 04:50.820
Be ready to tear it almighty Before we even do it now

04:50.820 --> 04:53.820
Your master plan goes nowhere Yeah, it's all ready to take that fall

04:53.820 --> 04:55.820
And it's up to you to make that call

04:55.820 --> 04:57.820
And if it don't work, make the real pen, wipe it out

04:57.820 --> 05:00.820
So drop the fall

05:00.820 --> 05:04.820
Yeah, drop the fall

05:04.820 --> 05:07.820
Yeah, drop the fall

05:07.820 --> 05:14.180
If you drop the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb

05:37.820 --> 05:42.820
Oh yeah, yeah, it's getting dark and I'm gone

05:42.820 --> 05:45.820
Gotta get on down

05:45.820 --> 05:47.820
Cool, like a gang hang

05:47.820 --> 05:49.820
JT players ready to swim

05:49.820 --> 05:51.820
You see the bounce and now the fall moves the prize

05:51.820 --> 05:52.820
If you win it, let me hear it

05:52.820 --> 05:53.820
If you win it, don't doubt me

05:53.820 --> 05:54.820
We hittin'

05:54.820 --> 05:55.820
Tell me, who be the fool?

05:55.820 --> 05:56.820
Who be the god like the summin' old fool?

05:56.820 --> 05:58.820
JB with the JT vibe from the 80's

05:58.820 --> 06:00.820
You know how it goes, celebration, babe

06:00.820 --> 06:02.820
Get out of the road with a mile of R&B

06:02.820 --> 06:03.820
The fool better see what you're in

06:03.820 --> 06:05.820
You can be doin' it, yeah, like some kind of swig

08:05.820 --> 08:07.820
Oh

08:35.820 --> 08:39.340
I'm not a

08:39.340 --> 08:43.340
me

08:43.340 --> 08:47.340
I'm

08:47.340 --> 08:48.340
I'm

08:48.340 --> 08:53.340
I'm

08:53.340 --> 08:54.340
I'm

08:54.340 --> 08:57.340
I'm

08:57.340 --> 09:00.700
bitch get a new song an open letter

09:00.700 --> 09:05.140
from orange lounge radio that's right yes skanky bitch anyway you are listening

09:05.140 --> 09:12.140
to Orange Lounge Radio for July 7th of 2002. Kind of a slow news week, not a whole lot

09:12.500 --> 09:18.100
to talk about tonight, so I don't know, I think we're just gonna kinda, just talk about

09:18.100 --> 09:20.780
whatever we want tonight. Maybe we won't even talk about Bomani at all. What do you guys

09:20.780 --> 09:27.780
think? I'll sing for you. Oh, what? No, no, you're fired! Oh god, we want people to listen

09:28.640 --> 09:34.700
to this show, Christ. I guess if we do want to talk about new stuff, there is some stuff

09:34.700 --> 09:39.660
going on. For the third week in a row, we're going to bring up this whole solo 2000 controversy

09:39.660 --> 09:48.740
going on in San Diego, all this hubbub where the Youth Advocacy Coalition decided to get

09:48.740 --> 09:55.980
a solo 2000 machine pulled from a bowling alley because of images of ecstasy and vodka

09:55.980 --> 10:01.820
and drugs and alcohol and all sorts of naughty things and nurses with syringes in their asses

10:01.820 --> 10:04.980
and all sorts of things.

10:04.980 --> 10:11.220
Basically the only new news item I've got for you guys is that DDR Freak, one of the

10:11.220 --> 10:16.860
biggest, I'm sure you guys have heard of it, the biggest DDR website out there, has drafted

10:16.860 --> 10:21.740
a response to the controversy, and you can read it over on DDR Freak's website, but I'll

10:21.740 --> 10:23.340
give you some of the highlights for you.

10:23.340 --> 10:27.420
Basically what they're saying is, A, the pills.

10:27.420 --> 10:31.260
They're saying when the youth advocacy coalition saw the pills in I'm Alive, they immediately

10:31.260 --> 10:35.940
assumed it was something like ecstasy, but actually, if you look very closely, you'll

10:35.940 --> 10:45.740
see it says, it's medicine. It says the word medicine if you look very carefully at the

10:45.740 --> 10:51.380
little words. It says medicine. Yeah, I'll be damned! Because none of us are ever watching

10:51.380 --> 10:55.980
the backgrounds that closely. You know what I found out? What? This youth coalition, they're

10:55.980 --> 11:00.040
just un-American Communist pigs, you know? And how did you find that out? Did you sleep

11:00.040 --> 11:07.040
with one of them? No, no, no. Just look at them. They're against modern medicine and

11:07.320 --> 11:12.440
healing, you know, people who have ailments. They don't like these nurses and they help

11:12.440 --> 11:19.440
people. What the fuck is their problem? Okay. Chat room responding that this really isn't

11:22.000 --> 11:25.640
a big deal. This story is getting blown out of proportion because we're talking about

11:25.640 --> 11:31.240
one girl in one group getting one machine getting kicked out of a bowling alley.

11:31.240 --> 11:35.280
The only reason I see it as a big deal is because now it's getting all this media exposure

11:35.280 --> 11:39.760
and it is being dug into the ground and beaten with a stick repeatedly.

11:39.760 --> 11:42.680
And it has kind of become a bigger deal than it should be, really.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.120
So I think that's kind of why it needs to be discussed.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.920
Does that make any sense at all?

11:46.920 --> 11:50.400
Yeah, but if we beat it to the ground then it'll never come back.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.400
I tried.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.400
I've done it before.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.720
Anyway, also in the response they say they brought up, they also brought up the Dr. Mario

11:56.720 --> 11:57.720
point.

11:57.720 --> 12:01.960
Why, if you're going after this, why not ban Dr. Mario forever?

12:01.960 --> 12:02.960
Well you know why?

12:02.960 --> 12:06.320
Because there's a seductive nurse.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.320
That's right.

12:07.320 --> 12:11.480
They say the sexy nurses are scantily clad but that's nothing out of the ordinary because

12:11.480 --> 12:16.080
sexy nurses have been shown in Animaniacs, which is suitable for all ages.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.120
That's a good point.

12:19.120 --> 12:25.560
And honestly, if you think that's inappropriate, go to Gulf Land on a weekend when the summer

12:25.560 --> 12:27.880
park is open or whatever, the water park.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.360
There are girls dressed in way less clothing than that.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.360
I'm sorry.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.360
They're real.

12:33.360 --> 12:37.240
I just think that it's funny that they compare DDR to Animaniacs in any fashion.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.200
That's just funny.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.200
It's time for...

12:40.200 --> 12:44.600
Also, they're talking about syringes, saying that the syringes were mistaken to be an illegal

12:44.600 --> 12:47.480
drug instead of something medical like vaccinations.

12:47.480 --> 12:52.760
If you notice in some screenshot that I don't see on my screen, syringes are flying around.

12:52.760 --> 12:56.960
They're doctors wearing red crosses, so that means it's medical syringes.

12:56.960 --> 12:57.960
You know what?

12:57.960 --> 12:58.960
Did they not...

12:58.960 --> 12:59.960
Bend over.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.960
You might feel a prick.

13:01.960 --> 13:02.960
A prick.

13:02.960 --> 13:03.960
You know what?

13:03.960 --> 13:13.440
Did they not make the connection, pills, syringes, nurse, medical, hello, what does any of that,

13:13.440 --> 13:17.040
you know, together have to do?

13:17.040 --> 13:22.660
And then they say about the cocktails, the cocktail images in the song Club Tropicana

13:22.660 --> 13:27.400
do not use cocktail glasses, instead they use glasses more commonly used for smoothies

13:27.400 --> 13:28.400
and milkshakes.

13:28.400 --> 13:32.700
And they say you don't know, basically the end of this argument says you don't know what's

13:32.700 --> 13:36.920
in those drinks, you don't know anything about what's going on here, and you're just being

13:36.920 --> 13:40.120
a damn fool to declare them as promoting alcohol abuse.

13:40.120 --> 13:45.760
And then they say, they go on to say that actually they're on DDR Freak, people express

13:45.760 --> 13:51.760
that playing DDR has decreased one's likelihood of experimenting with drugs, and it brings

13:51.760 --> 13:56.880
people away from playing such really evil games as House of the Dead and Street Fighter

13:56.880 --> 14:08.680
and Soul Calibur, Dead or Alive, Puzzle Bobble, Playboy Pinball.

14:08.680 --> 14:12.360
You know what, no one plays Club Tropicana anyway, so they don't have to worry about

14:12.360 --> 14:13.360
that there.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.880
Yeah, nobody plays that song anyway, so it's crap.

14:16.880 --> 14:22.360
Alright, that's all I really want to say about the Solo 2000 stuff, because we talked about

14:22.360 --> 14:25.920
this week on Week on Week, and the chat room is saying some things about it, and I'm being

14:25.920 --> 14:28.480
given some URLs so I'll check those out during the next break and if there's

14:28.480 --> 14:33.000
anything more revealing we'll talk about that during the next break so are we

14:33.000 --> 14:36.360
just gonna drop it oh we just gonna dry I don't know is there anything you guys

14:36.360 --> 14:40.560
want to say about this because we talked about it too much but it is basically

14:40.560 --> 14:44.160
the biggest news story it's something that everybody's talking about it seems

14:44.160 --> 14:47.560
like every day somebody new reads this story and goes why isn't that bitch just

14:47.560 --> 14:52.000
shut up yeah why doesn't she know but let's not keep going on this is just

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Dragging it on too long.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
But I hate when, you know, the nerd...

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Oh.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Give me back the mic.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Oh!

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Somebody rating a good point in the chatroom saying,

15:02.000 --> 15:11.000
That's something that pisses them off is that you're chucking the rest of the arcade community on the bonfire to make DDR seem less evil.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
That's coming from Jabberwocky in the chatroom.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
So it's kind of like saying...

15:14.000 --> 15:26.000
You kind of like how I was saying it in the response says hey at least it's not as bad as House of the Dead or these other arcade games going maybe that's not the best way you want to go about your defense.

15:26.000 --> 15:33.000
You just want to say that you know if you're going to go to an arcade just have fun because that's what arcades are all about and don't take it too seriously because they're just video games.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
They're fake.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
No they're not.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.160
Well, if you know these images of drugs and stuff are causing kids to do drugs, my god,

15:42.160 --> 15:47.240
we must have a world full of just drugged out, crazy ass, stupid people just walking

15:47.240 --> 15:48.240
around.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.120
News flash, we do.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.120
You know what?

15:52.120 --> 15:56.960
I don't see a lot of druggies playing video games, I think they're too strung out to be

15:56.960 --> 15:57.960
playing.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.920
Apparently you don't go to Country Club Lanes very much, but I don't know.

15:59.920 --> 16:05.720
No, no, no, those are like the, I'm not going to even discuss that because I might get shot.

16:05.720 --> 16:11.480
You know, I don't see how they can play video games and be high at the same time or whatever,

16:11.480 --> 16:13.480
because they'd be too strong.

16:13.480 --> 16:14.480
Oh, okay.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.480
Well then I retract.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.480
What happened?

16:16.480 --> 16:17.480
I don't know.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.680
Pinball's kind of always struck me as a stoner game.

16:18.680 --> 16:19.680
Is it just me?

16:19.680 --> 16:21.680
Where the hell did you get that?

16:21.680 --> 16:22.680
I don't know.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.280
Just something about all the swirly things and the anyway.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.280
Yeah.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.520
I think it's a good time to change the subject.

16:29.520 --> 16:34.880
Let's talk about, Matt, you're kind of the emulation expert of the group.

16:34.880 --> 16:39.040
I don't know, is it more appropriate to call these things emulators or simulators, these

16:39.040 --> 16:40.040
DDR?

16:40.040 --> 16:43.000
I think it'd just be better to call them sims.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Simulators, okay.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.080
So we got major news going on in the Dance Dance Revolution simulator world this week,

16:49.080 --> 16:50.600
so why don't you tell us a little more about that.

16:50.600 --> 16:56.920
Okay, well first off, we have the release of StepMania 3.0, the beta one of it.

16:56.920 --> 17:02.640
It's brand new, it's got the max interface on it, including the groove generator and

17:02.640 --> 17:03.640
all that kind of stuff.

17:03.640 --> 17:10.000
pretty close to being perfect as far as interface goes. One of the nice features I like about

17:10.000 --> 17:15.240
it is the addition of an editor. It's just like the home versions. You can make your

17:15.240 --> 17:22.440
own tracks. You can help sync the ones that you have to fix them and that kind of thing.

17:22.440 --> 17:26.080
For those of the people that are listening that don't know what it is, can you explain

17:26.080 --> 17:29.080
some of the stuff like the groove generator and all that?

17:29.080 --> 17:32.800
Okay, well the groove generator you've seen in it at max, it looks like the chart that's

17:32.800 --> 17:37.320
got the basically graphs, you've got air and voltage and that kind of thing, kind of tells

17:37.320 --> 17:42.960
you aside from saying this is a cata or an eight foot or whatnot, it tells you why it's

17:42.960 --> 17:43.960
rated that.

17:43.960 --> 17:49.080
It has a lot of jumps, tons of free zeros, a lot of crazy steps, that type of thing.

17:49.080 --> 17:54.980
It's just to help you out in determining whether or not a song is difficult or not.

17:54.980 --> 17:56.440
Really it's kind of pointless though.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.920
No one really looks at that as far as I'm concerned.

17:58.920 --> 17:59.920
It's pointless.

17:59.920 --> 18:00.920
People want to know.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.260
Okay, I can say there is one reason for the groove generator, and that is a lot of times

18:04.260 --> 18:06.940
people want to know how many freezes there are in a song and jumps.

18:06.940 --> 18:11.080
People that are new to DDR, because I've been teaching some people how to play DDR recently,

18:11.080 --> 18:12.360
they look at that error thing.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.600
If they're going to be having to do a lot of those double jumps, they avoid the song,

18:15.600 --> 18:16.600
like the plague.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.280
So that's the one thing I can see that's good of it.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.280
Yeah.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.280
Well.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.280
It's groove radar, not generator.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.280
Whatever.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.560
In the simulator, I think it's called the generator.

18:25.560 --> 18:26.560
I don't know.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.560
Anyway.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.560
It's groove radar.

18:28.560 --> 18:35.560
Anyways, aside from that, as far as the simulators go, basically the two main ones out there

18:35.560 --> 18:42.280
right now are Dance with Intensity and Step Mania. Step Mania, obviously, it's been pretty

18:42.280 --> 18:46.840
buggy in the past as far as what I've been, because I've used both of them. I've been

18:46.840 --> 18:53.400
actually testing three right now, and I found it, it's pretty good so far. I mean, obviously

18:53.400 --> 18:59.140
it's the first beta so it's going to have tons of bugs in it. The gameplay itself is

18:59.140 --> 19:04.480
pretty good. I like the fact that you can use BMS files as well as DWI files, which

19:04.480 --> 19:10.880
is awesome. They've added a random select just like, you know, you'd find in the arcade.

19:10.880 --> 19:15.280
And just to interject for those that don't know, the BMS files and DWI files are the

19:15.280 --> 19:20.080
actual list of steps. BMS being a kind of old format when these simulators were first

19:20.080 --> 19:24.080
coming around and DWI was kind of when Dance With Intensity came in and kind of gave us

19:24.080 --> 19:25.640
a new format.

19:25.640 --> 19:30.200
In fact, speaking of new formats, StepMania is going to actually introduce a new format,

19:30.200 --> 19:36.960
the SM format, which is supposedly going to include later on the addition to support for

19:36.960 --> 19:42.000
Pump It Up, Easy To Dancer, Guitar Freaks, Drummania, pretty much any Bamani out there.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.520
Will that also support Lips and Chains?

19:44.520 --> 19:46.440
I'm just kidding.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.440
Yes, it will.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.960
How about the Booga Booga Simulator?

19:48.960 --> 19:52.820
I thought I'd try something here because I know you guys haven't seen this right

19:52.820 --> 19:56.260
have you seen the new step mania Dave okay and you guys haven't seen this I'm

19:56.260 --> 19:59.260
gonna try to load it up right now so they can see this we can kind of get

19:59.260 --> 20:02.420
their reaction because this thing is pretty damn accurate to the arcade you

20:02.420 --> 20:06.140
might be amazed so I'm gonna load this up now this might just crash the whole

20:06.140 --> 20:09.140
damn show and we'll lose all our listeners that's okay because no one

20:09.140 --> 20:15.720
listens to show anyway so here we go okay okay one of the things that since

20:15.720 --> 20:20.720
The only thing that actually mentions loading up that I didn't like about StepMania is that it takes forever to load.

20:20.720 --> 20:30.720
People like me who are just freaks out there that have to have every single step file out there, and I have about 800 of them, it takes goddamn forever to load up.

20:30.720 --> 20:40.720
So, we've got basically, it looks like Max, they even have this stupid little logo that's, you know, making fun of Max.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.720
S&M Max.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.720
S&M Max?

20:44.720 --> 20:48.720
It's the 7th mix Red Flames logo.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.720
Everybody's waiting for you.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.720
And then they've got Rage holding his head like he hurt himself.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.720
Oh, this is nice.

20:55.720 --> 21:00.720
Pretty much everything looks like it's supposed to.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.720
They even have the ONI courses, which is nice.

21:03.720 --> 21:13.720
It just redid a couple of the graphics, but basically it looks exactly the same as I expected.

21:13.720 --> 21:27.720
One of the things that's a little bit different from SetMeeting before is once you've selected what mode you're going to play, it kind of goes into something that looks like a force mix screen, where you have the different categories you can select from different folders.

21:27.720 --> 21:35.720
One of the cool things about it is they've added a few additional features that you'll find in a home version or an arcade.

21:35.720 --> 21:42.720
Some of these are like the ability to do different types of visualizing stuff.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.720
For instance, you know, in an arcade you will have Boo and that type of thing.

21:45.720 --> 21:52.720
Well, they've added some different ones like Drunk, which the Air Fourth wave also is kind of like Boost,

21:52.720 --> 21:59.720
But a boost and then slows down, boost slows down, make it really hard to find, you know, to read the steps.

21:59.720 --> 22:04.720
And then also they have one that's called scroll, which is your Star Wars type of scrolling thing.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.720
The what kind of scroll?

22:06.720 --> 22:08.720
It's like Star Wars mode, right?

22:08.720 --> 22:11.720
Wow, that was weird.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.720
I guess it gives you, I've never been drunk.

22:13.720 --> 22:19.720
I mean, yeah, I'm the little crude one here, but I guess that's what it looks like to be drunk when you're playing DDR.

22:19.720 --> 22:23.720
I have to exit out of it because I think it's fucking with our levels too bad here, so...

22:23.720 --> 22:28.720
Oh, it's telling me we might be having dropouts on the stream right now, so I apologize for that.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.720
See, I told you when we went into the emulator, it might F things up, but...

22:31.720 --> 22:33.720
All right.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.720
But anyway, so basically, so far it's pretty good.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.720
It's going to be a little bit buggy, but they're releasing betas.

22:40.720 --> 22:44.720
They've released beta 2 today, so it looks pretty good.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.720
They're keeping up on updating it, and we'll have to see how it goes.

22:47.720 --> 22:53.080
But if you decide that you don't want to stick with StepMania and you want to actually stick

22:53.080 --> 22:59.360
with DWI, which is the other simulator out there, I've been informed that DWI 2.0 will

22:59.360 --> 23:01.800
be coming out in the next couple weeks.

23:01.800 --> 23:06.200
What are some things that everybody has to look forward to in DWI 2.0?

23:06.200 --> 23:12.720
I believe that they're going to have a groov radar in it just like StepMania.

23:12.720 --> 23:17.080
They're supposed to be redoing the interface and I forget what else they're adding.

23:17.080 --> 23:22.080
Hopefully they fix some of the bugs that are in it, but I don't think too much is changing actually.

23:22.080 --> 23:30.080
It looks like it's going pretty much the same, so I'll stick with StepMania right now, but I really hate that load time.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.080
That's pretty much it so far.

23:32.080 --> 23:40.080
I'm being told that the stream might be dropping quite a bit, so I'm trying to cut everything out that might be taking up bandwidth,

23:40.080 --> 23:45.080
so I apologize for the drops in the stream, but bear with us and hopefully it should be okay now that I turned off StepMania.

23:45.080 --> 24:05.900
So I guess this begins the talk of emulation versus the real thing.

24:05.900 --> 24:10.980
I see this happen a lot on a lot of message boards where people go, well, Max Unlimited,

24:10.980 --> 24:17.980
It isn't that bad because I passed it in the emulator.

24:40.980 --> 24:47.980
There was a guy out there, goes by the name of Bemani Ruler, for a while that was doing step files. They were freaking impossible.

24:47.980 --> 24:56.980
I mean, if any of this stuff was out in the arcade, it would definitely be maximum limited, hands down. It is just some of the hardest stuff I've ever seen.

24:56.980 --> 25:03.980
And this stuff is awesome. And that's one of the cool things about the emulators, is you can actually make them harder than the arcades.

25:03.980 --> 25:10.480
Also, with making them harder, you can change the difficulty, like Matt said.

25:10.480 --> 25:11.980
You can make it harder.

25:11.980 --> 25:16.920
You can add all these crazy things, like in step menu, the drunk mode and dizzy mode.

25:16.920 --> 25:21.240
You can have it go, I think, a little bit off-beat or something and make them wave back

25:21.240 --> 25:22.580
and forth.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.180
Just all this crazy stuff.

25:24.180 --> 25:25.180
People do it.

25:25.180 --> 25:27.560
They pass it on the emulator, yeah, with your fingers.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.960
That's like playing Thumb Thumb Revolution.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.280
It doesn't qualify as anything.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.840
I can full combo Max 300, but that doesn't give a shit about what I can do in the real

25:34.840 --> 25:35.840
thing.

25:35.840 --> 25:41.280
Oh, I was just going to say, this is a discussion of emulators versus the real thing like the

25:41.280 --> 25:42.280
arcade.

25:42.280 --> 25:48.320
Okay, well, I think the original purpose was to play it with your feet.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.140
That's why the arcade version is playing with your feet.

25:51.140 --> 25:56.760
So I think that emulator versions aren't, if you're playing with your hands, it's not

25:56.760 --> 26:02.280
exactly same as, you know, the original intent of it, but everybody has their own, you know,

26:02.280 --> 26:04.160
thing about it, so.

26:04.160 --> 26:07.760
Okay, well say somebody has one of those little Kiki Joy things, and if you don't know what

26:07.760 --> 26:12.680
a Kiki Joy is, that basically will take a PlayStation input and turn it into a USB input,

26:12.680 --> 26:16.680
so effectively you could take a Konami pad or a Red Octane pad, whatever DDR pad you

26:16.680 --> 26:20.920
use, and then plug it into your computer, which these emulators will recognize. So now,

26:20.920 --> 26:25.520
once again, it is a feet game. So, how, does that change things, or?

26:25.520 --> 26:27.520
Yeah, because the home pads suck.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.520
Well, they do.

26:29.520 --> 26:32.520
Yeah, and if you have unlimited amounts of time and money,

26:32.520 --> 26:35.520
then you can be like Matt here and build your own metal pads.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.520
And then we're cooking with gas.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.520
That's pretty cool.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.520
But you know, I've never played on a metal homemade pad.

26:41.520 --> 26:47.520
But I don't think it's ever going to be as good as an arcade.

26:47.520 --> 26:48.520
Hey.

26:48.520 --> 26:49.520
OK.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.520
Settle down, boys.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.520
Yeah.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.520
If you touch me there again, I'm calling the cops.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.520
Sorry, I didn't mean to derail it.

26:54.520 --> 27:17.520
The main normal, the standard original stages are the best stages. That's why I play in the arcade. Nobody's homemade pad is going to be as good as those. I'm sure they're going to be good, maybe just up there, but unless you buy an actual Konami original dance stage, which are like $1,000 or something, if I'm not right or wrong or whatever, they're fucking awesome.

27:17.520 --> 27:24.280
Okay, well let's say you went and you spent, let's say you even spent like the thousands

27:24.280 --> 27:27.760
of dollars to buy yourself like an arcade platform and you figured out how to hook it

27:27.760 --> 27:30.360
into your computer and everything.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.880
How does it still compare to the arcade?

27:32.880 --> 27:36.640
Is it, you know, to take the emulator itself versus DDR, would it still be, you know, if

27:36.640 --> 27:41.400
I pass something on this emulator, if I pass Max Unlimited with my arcade stage at home,

27:41.400 --> 27:44.760
is that still, you know, as cool as doing it in the arcade or what?

27:44.760 --> 27:48.980
Well, I think that if you had it on the same difficulty, because you can make it ridiculously

27:48.980 --> 27:49.980
easy to pass.

27:49.980 --> 27:54.600
You can miss 30 notes and have the equivalent to missing one in the arcade.

27:54.600 --> 28:01.440
But yeah, if you put it on the original difficulty and then just bust out a few songs that you

28:01.440 --> 28:04.320
could do, I'm sure that you could just go to the arcade and do the same thing.

28:04.320 --> 28:07.680
It wouldn't be any harder unless the difficulty on the arcade was changed.

28:07.680 --> 28:15.440
If that were the case, say you had basically an arcade set up at home on the emulator,

28:15.440 --> 28:19.940
I think the only benefit to going back to the arcade would be to get crowds and stuff

28:19.940 --> 28:23.880
like that, to make it cheaper at your house.

28:23.880 --> 28:27.280
Which is an interesting point that's being raised in the chat room right now, Jabberwocky

28:27.280 --> 28:32.840
again saying, you know, you've also got things affected like acoustics in the arcade and

28:32.840 --> 28:33.840
the dance pad, etc.

28:33.840 --> 28:37.040
Kind of bringing up that whole arcade environment, you know?

28:37.040 --> 28:43.320
If you spent thousands of dollars to get a machine in your home, would you still go to

28:43.320 --> 28:44.320
the arcade?

28:44.320 --> 28:48.240
Definitely, but sometimes you want to be away from the arcade, especially with a lot of

28:48.240 --> 28:51.080
these little brats running around.

28:51.080 --> 28:55.000
Another thing that I like about the simulator is the fact that you can play some of the

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
songs before they come out.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.280
I remember having the DDR Max 2 stuff way before I ever saw a machine for it, and that

29:00.280 --> 29:04.000
was kind of cool because you get to try the stuff out before you get the arcade.

29:04.000 --> 29:10.760
Honestly, if anyone could have a DDR machine at home, they would.

29:10.760 --> 29:17.120
There's obvious pros and cons, but people realize that there are far more pros to having

29:17.120 --> 29:19.120
one at home than cons.

29:19.120 --> 29:24.280
With simulators, you can get your own songs that you can put steps to.

29:24.280 --> 29:29.600
You don't have people wanting to play, and you don't have to pay any money, anything

29:29.600 --> 29:30.600
like that.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.000
Those are some pros.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.320
once in a while going back to the arcade to show off, but that would be about the only

29:35.320 --> 29:38.360
reason I personally would go back to the arcade if I had my own machine.

29:38.360 --> 29:43.600
Okay, we're getting a question from the chat room for you guys from DSCS SoCal Kicks. He

29:43.600 --> 29:49.100
wants to know, if you have the simulator, would you still buy the games when they came

29:49.100 --> 29:53.200
out for the console, or would you just download them? What do you think?

29:53.200 --> 29:57.440
I can answer that. I definitely buy all the games when they come out. The thing is, I

29:57.440 --> 30:01.400
buy them for different reasons. I'm kind of sad I buy them to make edits. That's what

30:01.400 --> 30:08.360
I used to do and I actually own quite a few, 4th, 3rd, 5th, Max, you know it doesn't work,

30:08.360 --> 30:13.080
Conomics, USA, Best Hits, Disney's Rave at one point.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.160
Did you say Best Hits?

30:15.160 --> 30:16.160
Yes, Best Hits.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.160
No, I thought you said Tits, sorry.

30:18.160 --> 30:22.000
No, Tits, Best Hits, just so I could make my edits for Stump to my beat.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.440
That was before I started making edits on the computer, but anyways, yeah, I love the

30:26.440 --> 30:30.560
home versions, they're awesome, you can get some of the songs that aren't on anything

30:30.560 --> 30:36.320
else, you know, some of the club stuff, even though I have those.

30:36.320 --> 30:42.560
Another thing, which is why I first got fourth mix and extra mix, is because challenge mode,

30:42.560 --> 30:47.160
and that for me is really fun because last week I started doing it again at Rob's house

30:47.160 --> 30:48.160
because it's fun.

30:48.160 --> 30:49.160
Did it again?

30:49.160 --> 30:50.160
Yes, I did it again.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.160
Oops.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.160
I did it again.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.160
Oops.

30:53.160 --> 30:58.360
It's just got some crazy shit that you have to do, like, hit in where you have to get

30:58.360 --> 31:03.360
all goods or something like that. All this stuff that you would never normally try to

31:03.360 --> 31:10.040
do, like keep your bar at 5% in your full life and still pass the song without getting

31:10.040 --> 31:13.880
any misses or something like that. I don't know. I'm just crazy.

31:13.880 --> 31:21.680
To answer that question about whether I would buy the game, if I could just get it online,

31:21.680 --> 31:33.720
We have to factor in economics with supply and demand.

31:33.720 --> 31:39.040
If you stop buying the games, they're not going to see the profit and they're going

31:39.040 --> 31:41.240
to stop making the games.

31:41.240 --> 31:47.040
That could be the ultimate worst case scenario, but then again, you're giving them all this

31:47.040 --> 31:50.080
money to buy these games when you can just get it for free online.

31:50.080 --> 31:56.000
kind of a tough decision. Personally, I'm poor, so I would probably download it online

31:56.000 --> 32:04.800
if I could, but I would still support Konami if I could.

32:04.800 --> 32:09.840
I've got a huge collection as far as songs go, and I have the metal pads and the whole

32:09.840 --> 32:13.560
setup and everything, and I actually built that because I was like, oh, I'm going to

32:13.560 --> 32:17.080
save myself tons of money, I'm not going to go to the arcade, I'm not going to buy the

32:17.080 --> 32:23.280
home versions that never happened I ended up spending all that money and I

32:23.280 --> 32:27.480
haven't actually it's just the problem is it's too bulky to set up all the time

32:27.480 --> 32:31.760
unless I actually have a nice place to set it up and keep it set up that's why

32:31.760 --> 32:35.000
the home versions are awesome because you can actually just okay I feel like

32:35.000 --> 32:40.800
playing fifth mix pop it in and away you go and also along the same lines

32:40.800 --> 32:46.880
realistically you know most people won't be able to have an arcade set up unless

32:46.880 --> 32:51.640
they've got a lot of money. So I would see that if they don't buy the home versions,

32:51.640 --> 32:55.560
they would at least be supporting Konami by going to the arcades and playing the actual

32:55.560 --> 32:56.560
arcade game.

32:56.560 --> 33:00.720
I don't know how much money Konami makes off of us importing their Japanese machines into

33:00.720 --> 33:05.520
American arcades and then putting money into it. I honestly don't see that Konami makes

33:05.520 --> 33:10.060
any money off the import scene. I don't know. I'm probably not telling facts here. Somebody

33:10.060 --> 33:14.880
else might in the chat room know more than me on it. But I honestly think, as people

33:14.880 --> 33:18.620
have said before, Konami really doesn't give a shit about us, and they probably are making

33:18.620 --> 33:24.020
all their money overseas, back at their home. So, I don't know what to say, man.

33:24.020 --> 33:30.180
At their home? Go to your home. Well, I'm just waiting to see the DDR Max

33:30.180 --> 33:35.060
for the U.S., I mean, because we're talking songs that we've supposedly never seen before.

33:35.060 --> 33:39.500
I hope they don't give us anything like After the Game of Love again, but...

33:39.500 --> 33:43.540
I have an agreement. Well, for those that don't know the first,

33:43.540 --> 33:54.040
Well, I know all you guys know, but for those that are listening out there that may not know, the first announced song was Overblast or Overdoser. I always get the two mixed up.

33:54.040 --> 33:54.540
Overblast.

33:54.540 --> 33:57.040
It's the one by LED. It's Overblast. Thank you.

33:57.040 --> 34:07.440
Overblast by LED is one of the tracks that's going to be new to America. It was never in any Japanese DDR game, but it's going to be new to America.

34:07.440 --> 34:08.840
And I think it sucks.

34:08.840 --> 34:13.840
You think it sucks? I'll play it, I've got it, so I'll play it for the listening audience out there when we go into our next break.

34:14.840 --> 34:20.840
Is that, I know you just said it's not any of the other games, but is that the one that's going to be in 6th style for home version? One of the unlockable songs?

34:21.840 --> 34:24.840
Uh, I have no idea, maybe the chat room can help you out with that.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.840
It's already, uh, it's BeatMania, I believe it's 6th.

34:27.840 --> 34:32.840
Actually, let me plug the chat room real fast, cause, well I got that brought up, let me plug the chat room real fast.

34:32.840 --> 34:36.640
If you guys want to join us in our chat room, unfortunately we don't have a direct easy

34:36.640 --> 34:38.120
way for the website just yet.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.600
We're kind of looking into that.

34:39.600 --> 34:43.160
Unfortunately all the Java people want tons and tons of money for me to get an easy client

34:43.160 --> 34:44.160
to do it.

34:44.160 --> 34:47.900
So all you have to do is you just join IRC and you're going to connect to an other side

34:47.900 --> 34:52.180
IRC server and that will be on your list of options in MIRC.

34:52.180 --> 34:57.800
One server you can use is IRC.eggheads.org and then you're just going to join channel

34:57.800 --> 35:01.560
with a little pound sign, Orange Lounge and that's where our chatters are.

35:01.560 --> 35:06.560
So, come join us if you can. Sorry to interrupt, go ahead and finish it up.

35:06.560 --> 35:15.560
It's a party in there, go in the chat room now. It's great, everybody's taking their shirts off and there's orgasms and stuff. Orgasms.

35:15.560 --> 35:19.560
Okay, anyway, back to the topic.

35:19.560 --> 35:26.560
So anyways, since we kind of just switched topics there, I have no idea where we are.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.560
I believe I was saying Overlast sucked.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.560
Overblast? See, I haven't heard it yet.

35:32.560 --> 35:38.560
It just reminds me of Spin the Disc, and I think we all know what Spin the Disc was like in the arcade.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.560
Spin the Disc is awesome.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.560
It's an awesome song, the steps suck.

35:41.560 --> 35:44.560
Okay, well it's definitely not a- was that an 8-footer it said it was?

35:44.560 --> 35:46.560
Oh man, it should be like a 5-footer.

35:46.560 --> 35:47.560
That's gotta be a 5.

35:47.560 --> 35:51.560
It's pretty- that's something we should probably talk about pretty soon, is the difficulty rating.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.560
What's Konami doing in these new songs?

35:53.560 --> 35:59.640
They are giving all these songs really high difficulty ratings, but to me and a lot of

35:59.640 --> 36:03.040
my friends and stuff, they are seeming really easy.

36:03.040 --> 36:08.020
I think Konami is just, I don't know, maybe they are going to start making 13-footers

36:08.020 --> 36:09.020
or something.

36:09.020 --> 36:10.020
I don't know.

36:10.020 --> 36:11.600
Alright, well we will take a quick break and then we will come back and we will talk about

36:11.600 --> 36:14.480
just that, Brad.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.640
So you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

36:16.640 --> 36:18.440
We hope you are having a good time listening.

36:18.440 --> 36:25.840
Visit our website at orangelounge.sky, S-K-I-E dot C-X and drop us an email and let us know

36:25.840 --> 36:26.840
what you think.

36:26.840 --> 36:29.560
Orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

36:29.560 --> 36:35.320
And here it is, as promised, LED with overblast and it may or may not be changed, remixed

36:35.320 --> 36:36.320
for the home version.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.400
We don't know just yet.

36:37.400 --> 36:40.080
This is the BeatMania version, so it'll be kind of close.

36:40.080 --> 36:43.080
So here you go.

36:43.080 --> 37:10.360
I need this all the way I need this all the way

37:10.360 --> 37:11.360
More than that

37:40.360 --> 37:41.360
I believe!

37:43.360 --> 37:44.360
I believe!

37:47.360 --> 37:48.360
I believe!

37:49.360 --> 37:50.360
I believe!

37:51.360 --> 37:52.360
Yeah!

37:52.360 --> 37:53.360
I believe!

37:53.360 --> 38:00.360
This is my destiny.

40:23.360 --> 40:43.360
I never look back, I can't explain what I see, I just know it's real.

40:43.360 --> 40:48.360
Don't you wanna seize the day?

40:48.360 --> 40:52.360
I will go back into reality

40:52.360 --> 40:57.360
I'm just too interested to stay with you

40:57.360 --> 41:01.360
I'm not a man

41:01.360 --> 41:05.360
I'm not a man

41:05.360 --> 41:09.360
I'm not a man

41:09.360 --> 41:14.360
I'm not a man

41:14.360 --> 41:16.360
Oh

42:14.360 --> 42:32.360
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

42:32.360 --> 42:34.360
Do we want to be represented by Hollywood?

42:34.360 --> 42:36.360
No!

42:36.360 --> 42:38.360
Do we care what people think of us?

42:38.360 --> 42:40.360
No!

42:40.360 --> 42:42.360
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

42:42.360 --> 42:44.360
YEAH!

42:44.360 --> 42:46.360
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!

42:46.360 --> 42:52.360
Extreme Bimani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

42:52.360 --> 42:57.360
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, our live little talk program here.

42:57.360 --> 43:02.360
Jamie Summers, my co-host, is out for tonight, so filling in we have the lovely Irene.

43:02.360 --> 43:03.360
Hi.

43:03.360 --> 43:10.360
And a whole panel of people here. We've got Matt, Loki, and Dave, and Brad, so say hello to everybody.

43:10.360 --> 43:18.360
I left tit and right tit, kind of separate people, so that's like five now.

43:18.360 --> 43:19.360
Right.

43:19.360 --> 43:20.360
You have tits?

43:20.360 --> 43:25.360
I know, you're the skinniest guy I've ever seen, you don't have tits.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.360
Huh.

43:26.360 --> 43:27.360
Yeah.

43:27.360 --> 43:28.360
Anyway.

43:28.360 --> 43:34.880
Those songs you just heard in that last break, we started off with LED Light from Beatmania

43:34.880 --> 43:39.960
5th Mix, and the upcoming USA Max version was Overblast.

43:39.960 --> 43:45.900
that we had for the Fantasia album, Vanessa Mae with Destiny, and Dumond from 2DX7 style

43:45.900 --> 43:50.640
with Never Look Back. And for those that don't know, because we seem to have a lot of new

43:50.640 --> 43:53.260
people listening tonight, so that's really awesome, I thank all you guys for listening

43:53.260 --> 43:57.140
to our little show here, we're in the third week of our new little experiment to try and

43:57.140 --> 44:01.580
do a Bimani talk show every week, but when we're not doing talk, we have a music program

44:01.580 --> 44:06.700
that goes on, our Bimani Music and More show that goes 24-7 on a dial-up-friendly stream

44:06.700 --> 44:07.940
through Live 365.

44:07.940 --> 44:09.760
And even though it's dial-up friendly,

44:09.760 --> 44:11.060
it still sounds pretty darn good.

44:11.060 --> 44:12.100
I was really impressed with it,

44:12.100 --> 44:13.740
so we kept it dial-up friendly.

44:13.740 --> 44:18.300
And we have all the 2DX, BeatMania, DDR, Para Para,

44:18.300 --> 44:19.820
we've got tons of songs there.

44:19.820 --> 44:22.220
In addition to that, we got Dance Mania tracks,

44:22.220 --> 44:23.460
some of the best from that,

44:23.460 --> 44:25.320
and then just all sorts of other random stuff.

44:25.320 --> 44:27.920
Occasionally you'll hear a Parappa, Unjamblammy tune,

44:27.920 --> 44:30.900
something from Pump, something else music game related.

44:30.900 --> 44:32.680
So do tune into that if you get a chance.

44:32.680 --> 44:34.820
That's running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

44:34.820 --> 44:39.260
and uh... we do archives of this show on uh... i don't know when did we do it

44:39.260 --> 44:41.380
last week monday or tuesday night

44:41.380 --> 44:44.700
we did on monday night we rebroadcast the show will be uh... doing some sort

44:44.700 --> 44:48.380
of regular schedule for the rebroadcast in the future but i don't know what that

44:48.380 --> 44:50.280
is just yet

44:50.280 --> 44:53.380
anyway before we went to break we were talking about uh... all sorts of stuff

44:53.380 --> 44:56.820
we were talking about the emulation which kind of led in to talk about ddr max which led

44:56.820 --> 44:58.160
in to talk about

44:58.160 --> 45:01.760
the max 2 unlocks songs such as spin the disc

45:01.760 --> 45:02.880
burning heat

45:02.880 --> 45:04.780
takumei i feel

45:04.780 --> 45:10.280
And, uh, some folks on the panel here are a little bit disappointed with the steps, so do you have something you want to say about that?

45:10.280 --> 45:18.780
Yes. Um, as my sweet, wonderful girlfriend here, I mean, my princess, said, um, you know, do they do-

45:18.780 --> 45:19.280
Blah!

45:19.280 --> 45:21.780
Don't they- hey, I've got-

45:21.780 --> 45:22.780
I'm just teasing her.

45:22.780 --> 45:26.780
You know you can stick it. Yeah. Okay, anyway, um-

45:26.780 --> 45:28.780
Blah!

45:28.780 --> 45:29.780
Excuse me.

45:29.780 --> 45:32.280
God. That was bad.

45:32.280 --> 45:36.280
Okay, so she was wondering, you know, don't they do site tests on these machines?

45:36.280 --> 45:38.280
You know, wouldn't people tell them?

45:38.280 --> 45:43.280
And I think I figured out that like, well, you know, secret songs like I Feel and stuff,

45:43.280 --> 45:46.280
they don't obviously site test those because they want to keep them secret.

45:46.280 --> 45:49.280
Well, you know, surprise, the secret is the steps suck.

45:49.280 --> 45:59.280
Yeah, so, anyway, I think, I don't know, I guess, screw you and your computer.

45:59.280 --> 46:01.280
Sorry, I've done that. No more sound effects.

46:29.280 --> 46:34.200
What do you think with it? I feel it's crap. I think I love I love the song

46:34.200 --> 46:39.640
I love I feel it's an awesome song, but the steps were just kind of like okay. They're kind of

46:40.440 --> 46:45.600
It's kind of like you're reminding me a lot of Orion how the steps they don't really go with the music

46:45.600 --> 46:48.560
But when you play with your feet it kind of makes a separate instrument

46:48.560 --> 46:51.680
It's kind of like an added percussion thing and that's kind of what they were doing that

46:51.680 --> 46:57.240
I feel except with Orion it kind of works. Yeah, but I feel it doesn't really it doesn't really add anything to the song

46:57.240 --> 47:03.240
On the standard steps, they do go with the song, from what I remember seeing of it.

47:27.240 --> 47:31.680
almost like drifting away except drifting away made more sense it's kind

47:31.680 --> 47:36.500
of a faster read and it gets slower and gets faster and slower as far as like

47:36.500 --> 47:42.520
the synth goes in the background which the steps sync up to I feel tried to do

47:42.520 --> 47:47.400
something like that but it was just kind of all messed up it's just not fun to

47:47.400 --> 47:53.040
play at all well kind of in defense of the game steps of how hard these are I

47:53.040 --> 47:57.180
mean you've got to think of it this way we've been playing well all the

47:57.180 --> 48:02.640
people here have been playing for a long time and I remember that when I first started playing

48:02.640 --> 48:06.900
you know the only two nine-footers that I knew were uh Dynamite Rave and Afro Nova

48:06.900 --> 48:16.460
because I used to play on uh oh don't even I knew that was coming and Dynamite Rave

48:16.460 --> 48:23.300
and Afro Nova from USA the home version and so you know like they had Trip Machine and

48:23.300 --> 48:24.300
And that's an eight.

48:24.300 --> 48:29.360
And I don't think that's any harder than half the stuff that they're saying is eights now.

48:29.360 --> 48:34.880
Because they've got lots of songs, old songs, that are not that hard and they're marked

48:34.880 --> 48:37.560
as eights and sevens and nines and stuff.

48:37.560 --> 48:44.240
But yeah, I think they kind of went overboard on the nines with Fiffnicks, like with Wanda.

48:44.240 --> 48:47.520
That song was not a nine.

48:47.520 --> 48:48.520
Well you know...

48:48.520 --> 48:49.520
But it rules!

48:49.520 --> 48:50.520
You know, I think...

48:50.520 --> 48:51.520
That line, that line.

48:51.520 --> 48:52.520
It's okay.

48:52.520 --> 48:58.280
person that made the steps to, I feel, just laid out this huge chart on the ground and

48:58.280 --> 49:02.800
he had a handful of arrows and he tripped and fell and he dropped all the arrows onto

49:02.800 --> 49:03.800
the ground.

49:03.800 --> 49:09.880
He's like, perfect, this makes complete sense and they were like all askew and just, yeah.

49:09.880 --> 49:22.080
But along the lines of bad ranking, I think maybe they're just

49:22.080 --> 49:27.720
thinking that, you know, we'll play it if they make it look like it's a harder song

49:27.720 --> 49:32.460
because we want harder songs and then we play it and it's crap and then, you know, we get

49:32.460 --> 49:33.460
all pissed off.

49:33.460 --> 49:36.860
Do you think it's really that or do you think it's because maybe the people, from what I

49:36.860 --> 49:39.900
hear I'm not too sure on the specifics of this so I'm probably mostly talking out my

49:39.900 --> 49:46.060
ass here, but on Max 2 a lot of the new songs, it's got a new person in charge of it and

49:46.060 --> 49:47.060
everything, right?

49:47.060 --> 49:49.860
So maybe they decided they were going to change the way they wanted to rank some of the songs

49:49.860 --> 49:51.580
because they changed other rankings too.

49:51.580 --> 49:52.580
What do you guys think about this?

49:52.580 --> 49:54.820
The other songs, they went back and changed.

49:54.820 --> 49:58.620
Many people say, okay, end of the century, should have been a cata the whole time.

49:58.620 --> 50:00.060
Good thing they changed that.

50:00.060 --> 50:03.100
Drop out, okay, yeah, that kind of makes sense as a cata.

50:03.100 --> 50:04.100
Okay, that's cool.

50:04.100 --> 50:05.100
You can make that a cata.

50:05.100 --> 50:07.100
Burn in the Floor, what the hell were you thinking?

50:07.100 --> 50:10.260
One of the easiest seven-footers, you just made a cata.

50:10.260 --> 50:14.140
I was going to say, did they turn it from a five-footer to a cata, because it definitely

50:14.140 --> 50:15.140
was not hard.

50:15.140 --> 50:16.620
Yeah, it's like Moonlight Shadow.

50:16.620 --> 50:19.180
Well, we changed the steps by one step.

50:19.180 --> 50:23.460
We had them go from the left arrow to the far right arrow, so I think they will put

50:23.460 --> 50:26.220
that as a caddo now, you know, like something crazy like that.

50:26.220 --> 50:30.020
It's not, but they should do that, just to go with all the other stuff that they fucked

50:30.020 --> 50:31.020
up.

50:31.020 --> 50:35.340
Yeah, but Moonlight Shadow on 5th Mix, if I remember right, on doubles, was only a 6,

50:35.340 --> 50:39.820
and if you, it's a 7, but it was one of the hardest ones I've ever played, I don't even

50:39.820 --> 50:43.780
know if I've ever did pass the damn song, it's more like an 8 or a 9, just because of

50:43.780 --> 50:45.580
all the running back and forth you have to do.

50:45.580 --> 50:48.580
It's easy for you tall, skinny people, but...

50:48.580 --> 50:51.580
No, um, wait.

50:51.580 --> 50:57.580
On that thing, all they did was just change one note from normally when it goes running across left, down, right, left, down, right.

50:57.580 --> 51:00.580
It goes left, down, right, left, right, down. And that's the only thing that they changed.

51:00.580 --> 51:05.580
They take out a note that does a, for a normal, for people who are regulars at doubles,

51:05.580 --> 51:08.580
and they realize there's certain patterns that Konami does.

51:08.580 --> 51:13.580
You know, so if you played enough songs on doubles, you just, you know the patterns and you can prevent shooting a song.

51:13.580 --> 51:18.900
shadow breaks the rule and takes out a note in the normal run.

51:18.900 --> 51:20.140
So you're really confused.

51:20.140 --> 51:22.940
It does a really weird turn.

51:22.940 --> 51:26.300
But once you figure that out, it is a 7 footer in my opinion.

51:26.300 --> 51:27.900
It is a 7 footer.

51:27.900 --> 51:32.060
But when it was brand new, that was a pretty hard 7 footer.

51:32.060 --> 51:35.180
You didn't quite understand that change and most people didn't notice it.

51:35.180 --> 51:38.380
Isn't that kind of said for a lot of caddos though?

51:38.380 --> 51:41.820
With Orion 7.8 once you just figure out the beat, it's pretty easy?

51:41.820 --> 51:42.820
Yeah.

51:42.820 --> 51:49.820
I think that's kind of the way it should be because, well, no, not necessarily like I feel, because I feel it's got a pretty funky beat.

51:49.820 --> 52:03.820
But, I don't know, I think Orion is, if you play it on one speed, now that maxes out and you can do the speed multiplier, you play Orion on speed two, it's not a problem for anybody, I don't think, really.

52:03.820 --> 52:11.820
Well, you know, unless you're a beginner, which is cool, but, you know, for people that are starting to play on a catastrophic level, no one here is a beginner.

52:11.820 --> 52:16.040
Well, no one here, but we do have listeners out there, Brad, people listening into the

52:16.040 --> 52:17.040
show.

52:17.040 --> 52:20.360
We know all sorts of players and intermediates in advance.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.380
What few listeners we do have?

52:22.380 --> 52:28.460
I think what they tried to do, I think there's two different categories for Katas.

52:28.460 --> 52:34.640
One of them is where they make it so that it's some sort of challenging in some way,

52:34.640 --> 52:39.660
because Orion's a slow song, so they had to make some kind of complicated steps for it

52:39.660 --> 52:41.900
to make it a cat and to make it interesting to play.

52:41.900 --> 52:44.820
And then there's ones that challenge your stamina.

52:44.820 --> 52:47.260
Like they could be the same things, you know, you can step,

52:47.260 --> 52:51.580
you know, same pattern five million times, but it's so fast, you know,

52:51.580 --> 52:54.140
so that's why it's so challenging.

52:54.140 --> 52:55.060
So were you going to say something?

52:55.060 --> 52:56.620
I was just going to say the same thing.

52:56.620 --> 52:59.620
You have the stamina and the ones that are hard to read.

52:59.620 --> 53:00.420
Exactly.

53:00.420 --> 53:03.860
The technical and stamina songs that are catas.

53:03.860 --> 53:05.300
So if they can't challenge you one way,

53:05.300 --> 53:06.740
they're going to try to challenge you the other way.

53:06.740 --> 53:08.700
But then now with Max and the speed multiplier,

53:08.700 --> 53:10.980
they took away that one with the slow song.

53:10.980 --> 53:18.780
Well yeah, I don't mean exactly, I mean exactly like off beats, you know that's how they challenge

53:18.780 --> 53:21.860
you is they try to make weird off beats so that you could just try to step up.

53:21.860 --> 53:24.260
Well that's I feel, but it's definitely not a catnip.

53:24.260 --> 53:28.540
Yeah I know, I think that's what they tried to do with I feel, but it didn't seem to work

53:28.540 --> 53:29.540
very well.

53:29.540 --> 53:34.020
What do you guys think about Max USA is supposed to have a half speed modifier to make the

53:34.020 --> 53:35.540
slow songs even harder?

53:35.540 --> 53:38.920
I think that that would be really cool, but no one in their right mind would do it if

53:38.920 --> 53:41.320
they wanted to try passing a song.

53:41.320 --> 53:45.880
And going back to something else about the unlocked songs, I think that to make them

53:45.880 --> 53:50.880
hard, they should be played at a certain speed, and like, Oni modes could have to be played

53:50.880 --> 53:55.680
with certain things on certain songs, like one song you might have to do Orion on hidden

53:55.680 --> 53:56.680
or something like that.

53:56.680 --> 53:57.680
Just crazy stuff.

53:57.680 --> 54:04.000
Oh, you mean a new Oni mode type of modifier where you have to play the song on half speed

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
or...?

54:05.000 --> 54:08.840
Well you know in the original testing for Japan, the rumor is, when they tested Max

54:08.840 --> 54:11.880
2 in Japan, the ONI courses were set that way.

54:11.880 --> 54:15.440
The few ONI courses they did have, I think they had like a five-song course, a ten-song

54:15.440 --> 54:19.600
course, and a fifteen-song course, and not only did the songs have different difficulties

54:19.600 --> 54:23.960
and levels and stuff like that, but they also had modifiers, but for whatever reason they

54:23.960 --> 54:27.640
decided to say, okay, we're just going to make everybody play us on one-speed singles,

54:27.640 --> 54:32.860
which I think, though, did make it more challenging, because when I played Max, six-mix, I became

54:32.860 --> 54:38.220
too reliant on 1.5 speed, you know, just because it was easier to PA stuff like that and, you

54:38.220 --> 54:41.820
know, I just kind of became reliant on it using the solo arrows, made things a lot easier

54:41.820 --> 54:45.340
and stuff like that. And now to go back and have to do everything on one speed, Oni courses

54:45.340 --> 54:48.140
kind of added a little bit of challenge for a little while. It was like, ah, these arrows

54:48.140 --> 54:51.740
are so close together. For some reason when I played fifth mix, I didn't have a problem,

54:51.740 --> 54:56.740
but going back and trying to play max with normal arrows was just weird.

54:56.740 --> 55:07.460
With the idea about the certain settings, you can still do it on one speed, it's just

55:07.460 --> 55:08.460
a preset.

55:08.460 --> 55:12.220
So one might be on one speed, and then you might have to play, like, let the beat hit

55:12.220 --> 55:14.380
him on three speed or something.

55:14.380 --> 55:19.500
Like three speed sudden, so you get almost no time to look at the arrows, and just other

55:19.500 --> 55:20.500
stuff like that.

55:20.500 --> 55:21.500
Go ahead.

55:21.500 --> 55:28.940
I was just saying that probably the reason why they took out the modifiers is because

55:28.940 --> 55:33.060
they thought that people might think it's too hard.

55:33.060 --> 55:39.180
There's people that can play hard songs and PA them just fine, but some people can't do

55:39.180 --> 55:44.860
Hidden or Sudden, and what are they going to put Stealth on one song?

55:44.860 --> 55:49.020
I could see Little working and Shuffle, but I think that's part of the reason why they

55:49.020 --> 55:52.340
decided to just, you know, not do it.

55:52.340 --> 55:57.320
Well another thing I'd like to see in the upcoming releases of DDR Max is, I know they

55:57.320 --> 56:03.360
have this with the 2DX 7 style, I think it was in 6 style too, where they have an expert

56:03.360 --> 56:08.780
course for each day of the year, and it's different every day of the year.

56:08.780 --> 56:14.700
I forget what they call it, but it's actually, it's a new course every day.

56:14.700 --> 56:19.700
Oh yeah, was that started in 7th style or 6th? I think it was started in 6th, right?

56:19.700 --> 56:20.700
I think they have it in 6th.

56:20.700 --> 56:24.700
Yeah, because the home version of 6th style is going to have this, where every day you have a different non-stop chorus you can play.

56:24.700 --> 56:30.700
And the home version of 2DX6 style is going to have this, where if it's Monday, you've got this set of songs as your non-stop of the day.

56:30.700 --> 56:37.700
And the other cool thing is all these courses will be internet ranking, I'm pretty sure.

56:37.700 --> 56:42.420
Rune Knight 13 in the chat room's got an interesting idea here saying that they

56:42.420 --> 56:43.540
should make a mode where

56:43.540 --> 56:46.620
if you decide to pick a song in an ONI course you can add modifiers

56:46.620 --> 56:50.540
for a certain amount of points and then use those points maybe they could be

56:50.540 --> 56:52.220
either points on your battery or

56:52.220 --> 56:56.700
unlock points or something. Yeah I think either that's about the

56:56.700 --> 57:01.500
the point I was about to make, make it optional to use the modifiers and then

57:01.500 --> 57:01.980
kind of

57:01.980 --> 57:06.540
I don't know about judging accordingly to that but yeah definitely if you want

57:06.540 --> 57:11.500
If it makes it easier for you to do sudden or hidden or something like that, then definitely

57:11.500 --> 57:14.220
or shuffle, then I think that'd be a good idea.

57:14.220 --> 57:19.300
And that is an interesting concept, you know, making it go towards points or towards the

57:19.300 --> 57:20.300
battery.

57:20.300 --> 57:21.300
It's a good idea.

57:21.300 --> 57:23.140
Okay, I'm going to take a real quick break since it's the top of the hour.

57:23.140 --> 57:26.660
We'll take a real quick break and when we come back, we'll talk about new features that

57:26.660 --> 57:28.820
ought to be in DDR, but they're not.

57:28.820 --> 57:31.300
So you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

57:31.300 --> 57:32.620
We hope you're having a good time.

57:32.620 --> 57:37.420
We do this every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock, Pacific Standard Time.

57:37.420 --> 57:38.660
And I hope you stay with us.

57:38.660 --> 57:39.660
Here's some music for you.

57:39.660 --> 58:07.660
I've got the rhythm in my feet And you can find it everyday if you want

58:07.660 --> 58:10.660
I need someone to take a shit

58:10.660 --> 58:14.660
The game is ready, ready to play

58:14.660 --> 58:17.660
He knows the night, he kills me on the dice

58:17.660 --> 58:22.660
Walking on the fire, yet some bird is dancing to the light

58:22.660 --> 58:27.660
The groove is just fine, I'll stop the music, be what you like

58:27.660 --> 58:31.660
I want the music, don't stop my imagination

58:31.660 --> 58:34.660
Music is a trap without control

59:04.660 --> 59:24.660
Can't you feel the music?

59:24.660 --> 59:29.660
Don't go around that much, there's no place to fall, don't do it

59:30.660 --> 59:32.660
Don't let them see me through, oh, oh

59:32.660 --> 59:35.660
Take a little sweet, sweet mama

59:35.660 --> 59:39.660
Well, I would love to go to my house and get a gun

59:40.660 --> 59:43.660
Don't let them know, no, no, no, no

59:43.660 --> 59:45.660
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:48.660
Rich, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:52.800
It is just after eight o'clock and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio live here

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.020
on July 7th, 2002.

01:01:55.020 --> 01:02:00.620
It's our third week doing this thing and Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura, my lovely

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.500
co-host, is out of town unfortunately this week.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.940
She's over at the Anime Expo, but she'll have a lot of fun stories I hope when she comes

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:07.940
back.

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.180
I'm hoping maybe she got some interviews, so who knows what kind of stuff we have to

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:14.740
look forward to when she gets back, but she will be back next Sunday at 7 o'clock, so

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:19.020
do join us then. And I imagine most of you will be coming back next week, I hope? Yeah?

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.020
Okay, cool.

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.020
I'll be here.

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:25.700
All right, so anyway, we were talking about before we went to break, new things that they

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:31.540
could put in DDR. It seems like everybody's got this idea, this really complex, cool points,

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:35.500
system thing that they want to see in DDR, so I thought maybe we'd talk about some of

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:42.900
those ideas. But first off the question, Konami is now putting out a USA version of Max. You

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:46.940
think they're going to put in any other cool new features besides half speed or you think

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:53.340
they're going to fuck it up? I think they should put English in it so that we can read

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:58.780
what they're saying. That's a cool feature. It's Max USA, yes it's going to be in English.

01:02:58.780 --> 01:02:59.780
though.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:00.780
Wait, you're Asian.

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:04.020
Don't you read and speak Asian?

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:06.940
Yes, all of them.

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:08.940
All of the Asians, all the Nieces.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.940
Oh, okay.

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.640
Because I thought you guys, you know, it's like the same blood, you know, you guys understood

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.260
each other.

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:16.380
Are you racist sir?

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:21.140
I'm being given some insider information in the chat room here, supposedly from a Konami

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:28.600
of America representative himself said, DDR Max USA will have a lot of surprises.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.120
And I'm hoping it's not, surprise, it stinks!

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:37.240
Surprise, I feel the remix, it's like with the same steps, hey, hey, hey, I like, I feel

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.240
it.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.240
It's going to be Joga-singing it.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:44.200
Surprise, it's the Joga-mix, no, no, we hope, we do know that there are some Konami reps

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.700
working very hard on our side, and we do hope that they are listening to what we're saying.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:53.200
We think they definitely do have the ability to give us some very cool stuff that'll make

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.200
the Japanese want to import our stuff for a change, so we'll see what happens.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.200
Anyway, any other cool new modes?

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:07.200
I think that they should have, instead of all the arrows at the top, they should have them in a little circle in the middle of the screen.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:12.200
And make it like a black hole where all the arrows just kind of do like a suction towards the middle.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.200
Salba, okay?

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.200
Guitar-o-man.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:22.000
Or, pop and music has this mode where the little blips, or whatever they're called,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
it looks like clacks.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.700
They come towards the front of the screen, and right when they hit the front, you have

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.700
to hit them.

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:31.060
Or, as we were talking about earlier in the show, the new Step Mania has the Star Wars

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:34.520
effect, where the arrows are in the back, and the arrows kind of scroll towards the

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.520
back.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.520
It's pretty cool.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520
I wish I'd shown you guys.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.520
We were looking at it earlier.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.660
Yeah, and then George Lucas shows up and sues you for a million dollars.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.160
I have an idea.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:47.240
If you fail a song, this little midget should come out and kick you in the nuts.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.840
Unless you're a girl, and they'll be like, oh, girls rule, and stuff.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:54.360
Well, one of the things I thought they should bring back are non-stops.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:58.720
They could do it like they do with Guitar Freaks, where you have three different options.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.760
Random non-stop.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.760
You have courses.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:07.760
They'll have themed courses, kind of like ONI courses, but you know, you can't, obviously

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.440
they're not as hard, and you don't have to PA them.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:17.440
What they do with the order non-stop is they actually have it where you don't gain life, you just lose life as you go along.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.440
So, you know, you happen to really suck at one song, you better hope you do better on the next.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:27.440
No, and for the non-stops, I don't really see a point in less than you don't get life back.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:35.440
Because what they do now for non-stops is, whenever you play non-stop, the difficulty is set to level 1 for any non-stop mode.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.960
So you can play like the hardest song that you would normally fail and pass it really easily

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.740
But you still almost have no life left because you have to do 30 more after that

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:51.000
Irene at the chat rooms responding to your idea here and it's being suggested by DC CS so Cal kicks that

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.160
Maybe the girls could get a foot, but it could vibrate

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.320
That would be the sound you'd be making

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:06.400
They can have a finger come out from the back, you know.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.680
Oh, I have a real suggestion.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:18.480
I think, as opposed to a fake one, yes, yeah, anyway, I was thinking maybe they could randomize

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:24.000
the arrows at the top so that they're not all in the same spot so that when it comes

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.560
up, like they would change the direction of the arrow, you know, and then you'd have to

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:32.360
find out like you know so it's not it makes it more challenges that sounds

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.320
stupid what no it sounds kind of neat what would they call it fuck you up

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:43.080
version fuck sword you up or no I don't know um like roulette style random mode

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.080
I don't know yeah roulette style yeah sure that sounds good

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:50.440
are you so I think they should bring back paint data if for all those who

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:55.040
don't remember that it was in third mix not popular at all yes where you can

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.040
to design your own arrow patterns.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.040
Yeah, I remember that.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.680
I wrote one that said Rob sucks.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.640
And that was awesome.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.640
And that wasn't funny.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.520
Yes, it was.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.920
What do you think about that, Rob?

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.040
It wasn't funny.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:07.840
I thought it was.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.000
I thought it was rather amusing.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.300
You'd make them look like penis heads, one to the left,

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.520
one to the right.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.800
That's so mature of you.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.760
Ew, penises.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:23.800
OK, anyway, so any other modes, suggestions,

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.800
things that ought to be in DDR that aren't type things.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.140
You think they're going to do, do you think they're going to, when Max 2 comes out in

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:36.420
Japan or Max in USA, I'm talking about the home versions, or Max in the USA, the home

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:40.440
version, do you think they're going to do an unlock system similar to the way they were

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.240
unlocked in the Max 2 arcade?

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.840
Obviously not as many points, but they're going to be lazy and they're just going to

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:52.720
basically take the DDR Max interface that it is right now, maybe, obviously since all

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.120
the other home versions I've been after you play so many songs one appears but

01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:01.640
nothing like max 2 or anything like that do you know this for fact yes I am all

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:07.800
knowing oh geez okay anyway okay and for the unlocks I don't really think that

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.840
they're gonna put in 750 points or whatever because there's really no point

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.340
they get you to buy the game you're gonna unlock the songs anyway why even

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:21.560
make them longer like I said they just make the points lower I wonder I wonder

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.000
though I don't I point I don't know I maybe they'll get rid of the point

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.400
system all together who knows but how about since the PlayStation 2 has a clock

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:33.200
inside it how about time releases and how about we change this with the

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.560
internal clock ourselves suggested by dark Tetsuya in the tear room how about

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:46.600
time time releases sure they should make all the unlocks new songs because you

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:51.440
know unless they put enough songs to keep us busy because I noticed on max

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.000
too, that everyone was playing all the new songs and stuff, but all the new songs became

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.920
old after a while, and then you know you're playing all old songs, and some of the unlocks

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:05.760
that you're unlocking after 750 points are older songs. I think maybe they should reserve

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:12.000
that for new songs. What would you guys think if they brought back Link Mode? What's that?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.560
The DDR Link Mode, where it was linked up with the 2DX substream, where one person would

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.560
be playing the 2DX machine. That's where the Club of Pens come from. Nice. Those that don't

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:25.240
Even though if you've ever played Club Append on the Dreamcast or Dis I & II Club Append

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:31.560
for 2nd Mix on PlayStation, those songs were the substream Link songs, and where things

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:36.320
like Earthlight and Pat Center and stuff like that originally came from, which are now economics.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.080
M-Flow owns you.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:44.280
I think that would be great because while Brad's playing DDR, I could play 2DX and pound

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:47.600
on all the keys at the same time and really mess them up.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.740
What about linking it with other popular session games such as Guitar Freaks and Drummania

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:52.740
and all that?

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:53.740
Mon bro go go.

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:58.920
What ever happened to that supposed link system they were going to have with B4U's CD or something

01:09:58.920 --> 01:09:59.920
like that?

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.880
Oh yeah, you were telling me about that.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.960
Yeah, well before they were making it sound like oh they were going to be able to pop

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.520
the CD in and have secret songs and stuff like that, but that never happened.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.440
Ah, but what about this that they're saying now is going to happen on 2DX6 style with

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.240
this V-Rare 2 soundtrack that's coming out.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:21.880
Supposedly, if you pre-order your copy of 2DX6 style, the home version, from konamistyle.com,

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:28.280
or I'm sorry, it's not konamistyle.com, it's called konamistyle, it's a Japanese site.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:33.240
If you order it from there, you'll get a special CD called V-Rare 2, which is some rare songs.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.720
They did this for DDR Max.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.380
However, what they say is, you put this soundtrack CD into your PlayStation 2 after you've loaded

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.400
up 2DX6 style and it acts as an append disk.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.920
And now you can play about five or six new songs.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:52.280
That would be nice, but it wouldn't be nice for people who don't want to spend the extra

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.280
cash.

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:58.200
Like me, I'd probably get to order it from Japan video games or something.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.040
Who didn't pay us for an endorsement, by the way.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.380
No, but let me tell you why I said that.

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:07.760
You can't order from Konami style because they do not ship to America, so we are fucked.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.400
Us Americans here in America.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:16.060
I think it would be cool if they put a, because one of my favorite features of third mix was

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:20.780
the disc change where you could go back and play second mix or first mix with the cool

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.940
interface and the vivid arrows and stuff like that.

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:27.660
I thought when they did Konomics they should have done some kind of link with the first

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:28.660
USA.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:29.780
Maybe they can do that with Max.

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:33.220
I think that would be awesome to do some kind of disc change, kind of get more life out

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:34.220
of those old mixes.

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:35.220
Yeah, I don't know.

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:39.020
I think that would be cool because they could play some of the older songs with the speed

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.420
modifiers and things like that.

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.420
That would be a good idea.

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:46.420
Or the solo arrows, all that stuff.

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.420
You guys are both holding your microphones so funny.

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.420
Please say something.

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:56.420
They shouldn't put two DDR machines together and make, what is it, quadruples or something instead of doubles.

01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:05.420
They put two dancing stages together and have a full, like, four stage whatever thing.

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:08.420
What is that, four times four?

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:29.420
One thing I do realize, since obviously we have economics and stuff and they have that edit feature on it, but what they forgot to mention is that the edits don't work with any of the arcade machines because they have region encoding, kind of like how you can't play U.S. games on Japanese PlayStation or vice versa.

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:34.420
It'd be nice if the edits worked this time on the actual machines. That's what I think.

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:39.020
Also, you know what they should put on the Macs, USA, whatever, they should make, if

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:42.620
you're playing single, they should make a hologram that comes out and dances next to

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:43.620
you.

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:51.120
Alright, anyway, speculate about the report that Konami of America will have an untitled

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:56.220
Konami music game in support of the Playstation 2 network card release.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.300
I don't know much about that, this is all I'm being told in the chat room, is that there's

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:04.040
supposed to be some kind of Konami music game supporting the network card.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.040
What kind of ideas?

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.640
Okay, let's say it's a true idea.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.000
What do you guys think it is?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Let's say it's a true idea.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.780
The network card is what will allow you to play PS2 over the modem.

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:14.480
And one music game that's going to be using this is Frequency.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:19.180
You'll be able to play Frequency with people on the other side of the planet or whatever.

01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:25.520
What do you think they'd be able to do with DDR in this mode?

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.600
Maybe just playing versus with somebody on the internet.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:31.320
apparently that quote comes from uh... issue fifty six of the official

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.720
playstation magazine may two thousand two

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.000
what do you think i think i do

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.560
i don't know it sounds dumb

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.920
that's what i thought i had that's my opinion i mean

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.900
let's see

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:47.320
every online games are really cool but you can really do music online game

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.780
maybe kind of dump they tried some similar with like a multi-tap version i

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:54.480
think that m t b music generator thing that right and get your friends together

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.560
make music

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.400
no one cared

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.140
Frequency seems like it would work because you're building one instrument at a time,

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.760
so maybe somebody else could be building the other instruments as you're going, and it

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.420
would be interesting as instruments come and go and things like that.

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.840
Something that's being suggested in the chat room, maybe it's just internet ranking.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.680
Maybe all it's going to do is it's just going to get online and upload your scores and you

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:19.360
can see how you compare to the professionals and all that stuff.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.920
That sounds feasible.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:25.920
No, even better is downloadable music.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.920
That was just suggested, downloadable new songs if you have a hard drive. However, from what I hear,

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:35.920
I don't know, this is all hearsay, because of the whole Final Fantasy XI, I have a friend who is very, very much into Final Fantasy XI,

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:41.920
hard disk isn't going to be coming to the US. Sony refused to make it for the US. I don't know much about this, I'm just kind of going off whatever.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:46.920
Actually, one of the cool things about the hard disk is actually the interface itself, you can put any

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:54.000
You can put any standard IDE hard disk in it, anything that you can buy at a software

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.160
store or anything like that, just that would work with a computer.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.160
You can plug it right in.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.160
So say you want a 10 gig hard drive, buy a 10 gig hard drive.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:05.680
If you want a 120 gig hard drive, buy a 120 gig hard drive.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:06.680
It just plugs right in.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:11.880
No, I don't know about that because, isn't it the American ones are internal and the

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:12.880
Japanese are external?

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.840
Yeah, but see, here's the thing.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:22.840
the actual, okay, the port that it goes in, you just slide it right in. It has the power port right there and an adapter problem there.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:38.840
No, I believe it was in either PSM or the official PlayStation magazine. One of the two had it actually on there where they showed a picture of the actual interface and that you can, you know, buy actual, you know, hard drives.

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.840
hard drives, and these are just regular hard drives out there. The problem was that they

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:48.040
were having compatibility issues with a few different manufacturers. But, I mean, you

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.360
can buy whatever size hard drive you'd like. Well, that would be nice, because Sony's trying

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:57.320
to charge an arm and a leg for these hard drives. It's pretty sad. But, anyway. Well,

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:00.480
I think I'm going to take a quick break, because it's getting hotter in hell here in the studio,

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:05.640
and I'm going to go get a fan to cool some of us off. And when we come back, we'll talk

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:10.320
about more different Bahmani kinds of stuff, all sorts of topic ideas. If you

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.000
have something you want us to talk about, why don't you get on in our chat room,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.800
you're just going to join the server, any other, I'm sorry, any other side IRC

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.560
server, you're just going to want to go ahead and join. One of them, for example,

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:27.080
is IRC.eggheads.org, and you're just going to join Channel Orange Lounge, and

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.000
that's where our chatters are right now, and we're going to take a quick break,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.480
and when we come back we'll be talking about all sorts of more Bahmani

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:42.480
stuff. Does that sound good to you guys? Alright, here we go.

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:41.160
More and more, more and more

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:39.480
program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:43.480
We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:47.480
in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:51.480
on the tiles, and start stomping away. A friendly

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.480
public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.480
That's right, our Bimani music and more program which can be heard on this live 365

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:03.480
channel for Orange Lounge when we're not on air. So anytime that's not

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:08.980
Sunday from 7 to 9pm, there's our Bamani Music & More show with 2DX, DDR, Guitar Freaks,

01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:16.240
and tracks from Dance Mania and other related music game stuff. All sorts of good stuff.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:21.120
My co-host, Dark Sakura, also known as Jamie Summers, isn't here this week because she's

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:25.360
out at Anime Expo, but she has a little segment she likes to do called the F.U. of the Week,

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:30.100
so in her absence we've been filling in for her. So we've got a nice little F.U. of the

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:32.100
and filling in this week is Brad.

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:34.100
Fuck you!

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:39.100
Fuck you, those ambulances that are driving by out front right now and distracting me.

01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:40.100
Yeah.

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:42.100
Does he have something more important to do, like save lives?

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:43.100
Oh, okay.

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:46.100
No, really, um, which one should I fuck you about?

01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:48.100
There's a lot of things I could fuck you about.

01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:50.100
Fuck you about them all, so what the fuck ever.

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.100
First, Taco Bell.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.100
It said lemon iced tea, and it was not.

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:56.100
It was unsweetened iced tea. That sucked.

01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.100
Oh, that was bad.

01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:58.100
Fuck you.

01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:05.100
Two, uh, well, Golf Land. It's a water park, we understand, but come on, at least tell your people who are soaking wet.

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:11.100
At least you say Roseville Golf Land, and I believe Stockton and Mesa have water parks in them. Not all golf lands do that.

01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:14.100
You're right, you're correct. Thank you. Fuck you, Rob.

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:15.100
Hey!

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:26.100
If you're gonna be soaking wet, don't you understand the DDR stage is electronic information, or uh, electronic equipment under you, don't play if you're soaking wet.

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:36.100
Come on, you're gonna electrify you or somebody else, or even worse, when I get on the stage, I'm gonna slip and fall and hurt myself. Then I have to go hurt you. Fuck you. Anyway.

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:46.940
Anyway, and also, no, on the topic of Golf Land Sun Splash, start teching your machines.

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.640
I know there's a tech there.

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:54.000
I'm sure he's fixed stuff, but God damn it, fix the fucking coin slot.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.700
It's not that damn hard.

01:23:55.700 --> 01:24:01.680
Takes two seconds to do and screw the fucking thing in so it doesn't break so fast.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:02.940
Not damn hard.

01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.820
It takes you two seconds.

01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:07.900
I'm sure you know why you're sitting on your ass doing God knows what you do

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:11.580
about teching this stupid uh... waterpark, oh like...

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:16.620
like we need the waterpark there. Like anybody goes to the waterpark. I know, like who does that?

01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:21.980
I mean seriously, and those stupid go-karts, I mean no one uses those either.

01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:27.380
Goddammit, just fix the fucking coin slot! I can't spend money if the coin slot is broken!

01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:28.820
And you know what makes me mad?

01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:31.680
They'll tech something like centipede

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.380
or something, like some really old

01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.240
fuck you said it'd be old

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.240
but you

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:41.380
yet and and they want you know something that nobody ever plays you know before

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.940
they do the d r something in my personal treasury

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:47.220
is that they have people that not attack

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:50.480
they're standing there checking are looking at the machine they know what's

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.060
wrong that they know how to fix it

01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:52.760
demanded

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.040
management like

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:54.920
uh...

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:59.020
we can't let you touch the machine because uh...

01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:02.740
we just one either don't know where the keys are or to

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:07.220
You know, you're just training and we're not sure you might fuck the machine up more, even

01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:12.060
though it's something really simple as, open the door, look at the coin slot, oh, it's

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:17.700
a little bit tilted, push coin slot over, coin slot fixed, screw in coin slot, close

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:19.700
door, machine worky.

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:22.500
You know, maybe they're too busy sitting around in the back, you know, pouring themselves

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.860
a little drink, because all the kids drive them nuts.

01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:29.820
But Rob, do you use that sound clip with every show?

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:32.820
Yes, because I only have about five sound clips right now.

01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:35.820
Hey, the sound clips sponsor this show, okay?

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:40.180
You know what, I wish you had that sound clip from Clerks where he was playing the Pharaoh

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:44.940
game and they actually get him to do the Pharaohing and he's all, don't you have machines to push

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:45.940
these blogs around?

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:49.640
And he's like, yes, good luck.

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.740
Maybe next week.

01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:53.740
Any other FUs while we're at it?

01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:57.140
Yeah, and that was the wonderful Mini Voices of Brad.

01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:58.580
Thank you Mini Voices of Brad.

01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:03.580
One more. F you, Brad. Fuck you, Brad, for not getting Krispy Kreme this week. You suck.

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:07.580
Oh! Well, you know what? No Krispy Kreme for you.

01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:10.580
Krispy Kreme after the show. Oh, yeah.

01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:15.580
Yeah, okay. I have an F you. F you, Brad. No, really. F you. Later.

01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:18.580
Hey, that A? Come on, now.

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:23.580
Well, I mean, that's sweet and all, but we're on the air.

01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:31.580
And while they're at it, why don't they just fix some of these other machines? I mean, keyboard mania- actually, just get rid of keyboard mania. No one plays it. It's-

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:40.580
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I love keyboard mania. Hey, would you rather have keyboard mania or, you know, beat mania 8th mix?

01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:42.580
They're never gonna get beat mania 8th mix.

01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:44.580
Well, hey, hey, hey! Okay, eh- eh- eh-

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:50.580
No, that's 8th.

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:55.580
No, is the final or is the final going to be the eighth mix?

01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:56.580
Eighth is final.

01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:57.580
The final, okay.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:58.580
Yes.

01:26:58.580 --> 01:26:59.580
Because I don't know.

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:02.580
Because five key, eh, I mean I love B-Mania at all, but seventh style is what owns it.

01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:04.580
I mean, I mean, sorry, seven key owns it.

01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:08.580
They should put fucking, you know, actual things that say if the machine is broken.

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:12.580
Like on Hip Hop Mania, they don't say that it's broken.

01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:15.580
You put a coin in a coin slot and, well, it takes the coin.

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:19.580
Yeah, and this is at Roseville Golf Inn, for those of you who don't live here and don't

01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:33.580
Yeah, Roseville Golf Land, normally about more than half the stuff is broken because Hip Hop Mania never works, like seriously, the best that you can ever get it is one button gets jammed constantly and the coin slot takes half your money.

01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:44.580
Just another point too, Beat Mania, the final, 8th Mix, whatever, it's all a sham. Because 5 Key still lives on in Beat Mania 3. They haven't announced that they're killing Beat Mania 3 yet, so just food for thought.

01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:49.580
Yeah, and I mean, they were supposed to end DDR with DDR Max, weren't they?

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:54.580
I mean, here comes Max 2, Max 3, you know, so much for Max, like being Max.

01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:56.580
Do you think they are ever going to end it?

01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:02.580
I don't think, at least in the U.S., there's still, I don't know about what's going on in Japan, I don't live there.

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:05.580
But at least in the U.S., it seems like it's growing.

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:08.580
There's more and more people watching these machines and playing them every week I go.

01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:10.580
I could not see them killing off DDR.

01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:15.460
DDR. If they do something stupid internally within the company, maybe that would do it.

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:16.460
Who knows?

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:21.860
Let's just hope that we don't have Konami of the United States building these machines

01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:26.700
because then we'll get a really buggy-ass version of a machine, kind of like Conomics,

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:32.380
and bringing that out where you step on the left arrow twice and then the machine explodes

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:36.740
or something like that. Even if DDR always dies, we always have Pump It Up.

01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:41.100
Puke it up, you mean.

01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:42.100
Pump it up is tight.

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.220
I don't know what you're all complaining about.

01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.740
I agree.

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:46.740
It's different.

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:51.400
At first I hated it, but then the music was kind of infectious to me and I really liked

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:55.280
a lot of the music and stuff and now I'm just like, bounce with me, bounce with me, bounce

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.280
with me, bounce.

01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:03.140
No, like, I like half the music and I just love how I'm so used to hitting the arrows

01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:10.140
I'm not used to going diagonally in the middle arrow, and I love the shimmy on that thing.

01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:17.060
Rob, if you really like the music, why don't you just buy it and dance with it at home?

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.180
Because I'm white and I can't dance without arrows?

01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:20.180
I don't know.

01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:21.180
Well, who cares?

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:23.180
No one's going to see you.

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:26.400
Well, actually, they do have the home version of Pump It Up!

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.960
And also, why don't they just, you know, since, you know, you've got this Marvel vs. SNK and

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.960
that kind of thing, we can do Pump It Up vs. DDR.

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.760
Oh, God.

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.840
Have like some, maybe one of the company, you know, Konami should just buy that other

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.360
company and have it.

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.320
Nine Panel DDR.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:49.920
Oh my God, it's Nine Panel DDR, oh my God, oh my God!

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.920
Huh, right.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:56.340
No, I don't see how you could do the, you know, obviously pump it up versus DDR, except

01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:59.940
for mix the music, you know, into the game, because you can't, you know, have one side

01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:02.440
of it be the five panel and the other side be the four panel.

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.440
Why not?

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.700
That'd be really, yeah, that'd just fuck everything up.

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.700
I know.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:11.500
They shouldn't just have both panels, you know, like one version is pump it up and then

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:15.420
you have the panels in the corner in the middle and then one version, you know, DDR.

01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:18.180
Both of the panels are nine panels.

01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:23.880
And I am being corrected into chatroom as I ask every time we bring up 9 panel DDR.

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.500
What about Techno Motion?

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.360
That's 9 panel dance game.

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.920
Okay, I don't count the game unless I've played it.

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.200
And I go to Arcade Infinity occasionally and Blazings.

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:39.000
It just, we have to kind of base our knowledge of stuff off stuff we've played or at least

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.440
kind of heard about and unfortunately the information on Techno Motion isn't that great.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:48.720
So yeah, okay, there is an iPanel game that exists, but it's obviously not very big because

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:52.540
we don't really hear about it except when the question is brought up.

01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:54.440
They should have an iPanel DDR.

01:30:54.440 --> 01:31:00.060
Well, what about that one that they had that was like pressure sensitive on the ground

01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:03.020
and it had sort of like infrared sensors on the sides.

01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:04.260
Not easy to dance or anything like this.

01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.220
This is some weird Korean thing.

01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:08.420
Maybe this was a dream you had, Matt.

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:09.420
No, it wasn't.

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:10.420
Trust me.

01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:11.420
The dreams I have are really strange.

01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:13.420
Okay, we don't need to go into that.

01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:16.920
Oh boy, I don't know if that's appropriate for the show.

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.920
Oh, it's appropriate.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:23.920
I had a really strange dream last night about some alarm clock that was possessed by some sort of thing,

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.420
and it was like, causing people to do weird things. It was cool.

01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:28.920
What, like play DDR? In public?

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.920
That's pretty strange.

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.920
Dave's trying to read over my shoulder in the chatroom here, and he's like,

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.420
Porn? No, they're saying pop and music there.

01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:39.420
Pop and is, that's not porn.

01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:43.260
If you drew another little line there, I would say born, but he's saying pop in, like pop

01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:44.260
in music.

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:47.180
And we have been discussing 2DX and pop in music throughout the show.

01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:48.180
They come up occasionally.

01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:51.180
I want para para third mix.

01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:52.180
Why?

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:56.300
Because, I like that turn the beat around the para that...

01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:59.620
Oh God, that one, the VCD you brought last week with the turn.

01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:01.140
Alright, that was pretty cool.

01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:05.420
And if para third mix would like kinda lift up the people's skirts when you do that motion,

01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:06.420
that would be pretty cool too.

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:07.420
Dude, they should have that guy at the background.

01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:08.420
You had to be here last week.

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:15.420
that'd be awesome

01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:18.540
ever killed school friends

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:19.620
uh...

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:20.340
yeah i want

01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:21.820
i want to go boondock

01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:24.420
second Mexican

01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:28.620
the gayest conversation we've ever had

01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:29.660
para para

01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:31.540
boom boom uh... and killed

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:33.480
you give us more care than that

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.180
this is combine them all

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:36.460
and we'll tell

01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:37.820
well i mean

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:39.820
Look at Pera, Pera, I'm her boy.

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:40.820
You know what?

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:41.820
I heard...

01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:42.820
Sorry, I'm pulling it away from you.

01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:43.820
Give it to me.

01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:48.220
Yeah, I heard that the little kids really do that in Japan.

01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:51.820
I don't know if it's a common thing, but they like to mess around with people.

01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:56.740
They really put their hands together and make a gun kind of thing, and they just poke people

01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:57.740
in their butts.

01:32:57.740 --> 01:32:58.740
Yeah.

01:32:58.740 --> 01:32:59.740
It's the truth.

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.180
We heard it from the horse's mouth.

01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:05.580
From one of my Japanese exchange student friends, uh-huh.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:06.580
That explains it.

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.740
It happened to me at a gay bar once, but it turned out...

01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:09.740
Was it Japanese?

01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:10.740
No, I don't know.

01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:11.740
Yeah, so, no.

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:13.060
There's some big, like, football player guy.

01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:14.060
Anyway.

01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:15.060
I know, it's a cowboy.

01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:20.460
We're getting a lot of dot-dot-dots in the chat room right now, like, blink, blink, blink.

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:22.420
I didn't know I was going to tune into this.

01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:23.420
Boonga!

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.420
Ew!

01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:28.540
I thought we were going to be talking about DDR stuff, and 2DX, and all that.

01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.100
Well, you started talking about Para Para.

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:31.100
Yeah, yeah, it's true.

01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:32.100
What do you expect?

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.100
Anal Planetration?

01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:35.220
I fucked everything up when the conversation went to Para Para, no.

01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:37.780
Para Para and Anal Planetration go together.

01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:40.580
Para Para, it's cool.

01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:42.220
I don't know.

01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:43.780
It's not something to obsess over, though.

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:44.780
I don't know.

01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:45.780
As far as I'm concerned.

01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:47.580
If you want to do that, hey, you know.

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:50.740
Not that there's anything wrong with that, but, you know, as far as I'm concerned.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.500
So what's the next topic?

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:53.500
Next topic!

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:54.500
Why don't we talk about this?

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:55.500
Yeah!

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:56.500
Hey!

01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:57.500
Another Bomani game.

01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:01.620
Guitar Freak's eighth mix and Drummania's seventh mix are currently being location tested

01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:02.620
around.

01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:05.020
What do you guys think are some new features these games have?

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:08.520
And what do you think? Do you think they're coming out a little fast?

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:14.020
It seems like just a few months ago we were looking at 5th and 4th at Golfland and they were brand new and...

01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:19.020
Yeah, are they spending all their time and money on guitar picks in Romania and not enough on DDR?

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:20.520
Because they're bringing them out way fast.

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:26.020
I think that they're spending too much time on... What are we going to put in the next one instead of putting stuff in the one that's coming out now?

01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:30.020
They're like, well, what can we put in 8th nicks? Why not just put it in 7th nicks?

01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:34.020
That was disgusting. I don't know what that was. There's a farting type noise happening.

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:45.020
They worry too much about what's coming up next. They're thinking about what's coming up on max 5 right now. Max 3 is coming out probably pretty soon.

01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:46.020
You have to be prepared.

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.020
In a way.

01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:48.020
You have to be prepared.

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:53.020
Yeah, gotta be prepared. Why not just put it in the next one instead of like save it for two more?

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:57.020
You know what would be awesome for drum mania? You know how in Guitar Freaks when you wail?

01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:59.020
Yeah, I know.

01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:02.380
have something for Drummania, they should have electronic drumsticks and every time

01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:06.260
you twirl it in your hand, you should get points or whatever for that.

01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:11.420
Okay, two things, one, only real drummers can twirl the sticks, fortunately, I have

01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:12.420
that skill.

01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:15.660
Well, if you can't twirl it, then, you know, improvise, like, pretend like you're twirling

01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:17.820
it or something, like spin it around in your hand or something.

01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:19.940
It's not a magic wand.

01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:24.020
Here talking about 8th and 7th, which are currently being location tested, here's some

01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:28.620
new songs that are going to be in it, Breakdown, which a lot of people when they heard the

01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:31.740
song on max two said it should be a guitar piece and now it is

01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:34.700
we got a song called russian roulette i wonder if it's anything like that game

01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:38.060
show where if you fuck up you fall through the floor

01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:43.020
that would be so cool like now you get to play russian roulette with four drop zones

01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:47.100
click click click click click click

01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:49.060
you got a good you suck

01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:51.660
drop you to the hole

01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:53.380
what other songs are there

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:57.780
uh... other new song called homesick part two and three uh... then there's a

01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:02.360
a bunch of old stuff coming back. There were some other new songs. I'm looking for the

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:05.280
list right now of other new songs that were coming out because I didn't prepare for this

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:10.380
topic before the show. What do you guys think? Because you guys have had a chance to play

01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:13.800
Guitar Freak 7th and Drummania 6. What do you guys think about the series?

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:20.560
Well, I love Drummania and Guitar Freak's Drummania more because I actually drum. And

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:26.280
I've been in love with that since the first time I ever played it in like 4th Mix a long

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:32.960
time ago, and basically they've got lots of modifiers and it's way ahead of DDR in terms

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:38.960
of stuff that it can do, but DDR is kind of catching up now with Max 2 and all this other

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:39.960
stuff.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:40.960
Oh, Tickle Bitties?

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.720
I love Drummania.

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:49.000
I'm being told by Virtu, who's in the chat room, saying that Kakumei is rumored to be

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
in it.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Kakumei?

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I don't know.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
In Drummania?

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.800
What in the world?

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.760
You know, I forgot what I was going to say, so never mind.

01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:02.520
They need to put half the songs that were in Keyboard Mania on there like the Dracula

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:06.240
Medley and all the other ones that I can't remember right now.

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:08.980
But Henry Henry actually has a really, really good drum part.

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:11.240
You know, I have a question.

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:18.800
Why did they make the difficulties of the songs different from previous mixes?

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:20.280
I don't think they made it that much different.

01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:23.720
No, they dropped the difficulties to lower difficulties.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:26.960
cosmic cowgirl used to be a 50 on basic and then they dropped it to like a 30

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:30.820
yeah there was a dramatic change because beyond the nightmare was like an 80 or

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:34.680
something I think and now it's a 40 something on extreme what they did was

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:38.480
beyond the nightmare they only had two settings they had basic and I'm not sure

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:46.160
if I've mixed Romania but it was I think an 83 or 81 on extreme and I forget like

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.640
a 40 on basic and they moved the extreme down to advance and made a new set of

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:57.000
extreme steps. No, it's not steps. Yeah, that would be fun. Smash the drums.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.600
I am being told that Virtu sent me a PM and saying that Jappo sites are claiming that

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:07.400
Kakumei is in Guitar Freaks and Drummania. So take that as it is. It would be interesting.

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:10.800
I could see maybe Kakumei being in Drummania. I don't know about Guitar Freaks. He doesn't

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:16.080
seem to have a guitar part, but you never know. You never know. Some other things that

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:23.840
are going to be in there, Power, Another World, Home Girl, Chocolate Philosophy, Ka Ka Cha,

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:32.040
and Kaiko, My Love. They're saying that they've also changed a lot of the ratings. One song

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:37.320
in particular, Newspaper, used to be a 92 on Extreme, and now it's a 55. So it's like

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.200
they're taking the scale and thinking a lot lower.

01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.440
One thing I noticed about the difficulty, because I always play basic stuff anyways

01:38:42.440 --> 01:39:11.440
because I totally suck at guitar freaks. The songs get harder as you play through them. Like, for instance, if I were to, say, play, um, I believe, like, Eraser Motor or whatever on my third song or whatever, or whatever, Erase Notes, yeah, whatever. Anyways, if I would play it on my third song, it'd be like a 40, 43 or something like that. If I played it on my first song, it's like a 20-something. It's, it grades harder as you play through the song. It grades harder, but the actual ranking of how hard it says it is doesn't change.

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:17.440
Like, if you play Giant Slug, it's always an 80-something, or, well, now it's like a 60-something, or whatever.

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:22.440
Yeah, I wonder, what would have been the purpose of changing the difficulty?

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:28.440
It seems like they didn't want to go above the number 100, because I think the highest on the earlier versions was 99.

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:29.440
Yeah.

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:40.440
So they had to, you know, to make, you know, the songs harder, and not, you know, like, because they don't go over a 10-footer on MaxNow, so they kind of had to, like, they need to dumb down some of the other ones.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.440
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:16.360
I'm also being told that Drummania 7th is going to have a total new layout that's going

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.500
to have genres and artist names so hopefully we'll be getting some screenshots when they

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:24.280
do the location testing in the future and we'll definitely be talking about that on

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:29.380
a future edition of Orange Lounge Radio which you can hear right here on this Orange Lounge

01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:32.760
Live 365 station every Sunday night from 7 to 9 p.m.

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.200
I'm going to take another quick break and then we're going to come back and wrap up

01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:36.200
the show.

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:39.280
I'm going to go ahead and play one of those songs that's going to be in Guitar Freaks

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:44.160
8th and Drum Mania 7th, you might have heard it in Max 2, it's Breakdown, but I'm being

01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:47.800
told it's going to be remixed for Guitar Freeze, which makes sense, because if you listen to

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:52.820
other stuff that was in both, like My Sweet Darlin' was kind of a different mix when you

01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:56.520
heard it in Guitar Freeze, and Long Train Runnin', I think it was a completely different

01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:00.820
artist, so we'll probably expect the same thing from Breakdown.

01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:03.380
So here you go, we're going to listen to a couple songs and we're going to come back

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:05.380
and wrap it up here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:07.380
You told me you're dead

01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:09.380
You've got small plans, you know

01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:13.380
You can't even know that life's like it's almost there

01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:27.380
Let's go, because the sun's just out of your mind

01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:29.380
Maybe we're falling like the light

01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:32.380
We're gonna all be good kids, we're good friends

01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:34.380
Don't say you're sorry

01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:37.380
You've got a gun and you don't care

01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:39.380
I guess I'm gonna tear up

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:42.380
Tell me that I need you to get up

01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:53.380
Tell me do you love somebody?

01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:57.380
Tell me do you love somebody?

01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:17.380
Tell me do you love somebody?

01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:20.380
I need somebody to swivel around

01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:24.080
And if someone told you to join in with us

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:27.280
I'd feel better if we'd be together

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.280
And know that the pain will be fine

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:39.880
Sometimes when you feel like the world is turning without you

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:43.880
And you believe it won't make it

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:46.380
Cause you're all alone

01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:51.860
Is somebody here for you? Do you feel it too?

01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:55.900
Tell me, do you love somebody? Or need somebody?

01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:59.100
Just work around and there's someone for you

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:01.020
And start to get with us

01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:04.340
We all feel better, we'll be together

01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:07.740
And know that everything will be fine

01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:19.740
No everything will be fine No everything will be fine

01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:26.740
All of the day when the sun shines On everyone but you

01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:32.740
Soap in your heart to a transcend The light comes your way

01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:38.740
Remember to call my dear, there's somebody here

01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:42.740
Tell me do you love somebody or need somebody

01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:45.740
Just look around and there's someone for you

01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:49.740
It's only you with us, we're all together

01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:54.740
We'll be together and know everything will be fine

01:44:54.740 --> 01:45:01.740
No, everything will be fine

01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:09.740
Tell me do you love, tell me do you love somebody

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:12.740
Or need somebody to circle around

01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:15.740
And there's someone for you to join you with

01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:19.740
Or we all feel better and see together

01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:23.740
No, everything will be fine

01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:29.740
No, everything will be fine

01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:50.740
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge radio staff meeting.

01:47:50.740 --> 01:48:09.340
The song you just heard in that little set were Breakdown by B4U and then from Dance

01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:13.740
Maniac 7 that was Serena Paris with Do You Love Somebody and some people in chat were

01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:17.780
asking what that one was and again for those that don't listen to the Bimani Music Immortu

01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:23.780
program. Why not? You should be. Always playing 24-7 on this Live 365 station when our talk

01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:28.420
show isn't going. And that's Dance Maniacs songs, because we sometimes throw in some

01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:35.380
of the Dance Maniac tracks. Also, after that, from 2DX, Love Me Do, because Virtu was complaining

01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:38.340
we weren't talking enough about 2DX, so I thought I'd play a song for him. For all I

01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:44.740
know, he hates that song, but whatever. You know, Bob, when did Madonna join the staff?

01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:53.100
We're going to be cutting some new promos after the show tonight, by the way, so you

01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:55.740
won't have to hear the same stuff every week.

01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:00.100
With my co-host, Dark Sakura, the lovely Jamie Summers being out of town at Anime Expo, it's

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:04.220
kind of been hurting in the making promos department, so there'll be a whole buffet

01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:06.920
of things to look forward to when she comes back next week.

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:09.220
I'm sure she'll have some exciting stories to tell.

01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:13.540
Speaking of exciting stories, I thought we'd end the show with some exciting stories, so

01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:18.380
So I was wondering if anybody on the panel here had any good Bimani stories that involved

01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:22.660
either A, being out of town, or B, drunk people?

01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:24.340
Anybody?

01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:25.340
Nobody has a story.

01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:26.340
Irene's got one?

01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:27.340
Yeah, it's involving me.

01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:29.260
You said during the break you had one, dammit.

01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:35.120
It's not anything super special or exciting, but we went to Crestview Lanes, and he was

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:39.780
playing on the DDR machine, which is right by the entrance, and this drunk guy, he had

01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:44.820
a bowling ball with him and he came up and he put it on the ground and he was watching

01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:51.620
Brad play and then he goes really loud, ooh, rock and roll, you know, and I'm like, whatever.

01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:56.380
And then he starts playing soccer with the bowling ball, like kicking it around and stuff.

01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:00.900
And yeah, it was just funny because I'm like, shut up. Like I seriously said that to him

01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:03.780
like out loud and I don't think he heard me.

01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:07.580
Bowling alleys with DR machines can suck sometimes because they serve alcohol at these bowling

01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:13.580
So a lot of drunk people coming up to the DR machine and going woo! Rock and roll!

01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:20.580
Once this really long time ago when I was memorizing bakwa for I don't know why.

01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:27.580
And I do a hand plant on one part and this drunk guy was watching me and was like oh I can do that.

01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:33.580
And so he like he ran up the machine and tried to do a hand plant and he ended up like falling right on his ass.

01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:40.180
And it was like during my song, too, and so it's like, okay, get off the floor, I'm playing.

01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:44.020
And the same drunk guy, he comes up to Brad and shakes his hand and says, what's your

01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:45.020
name, man?

01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:49.700
And Brad's all, Brad, and he's all, yeah, I'm Joe, Joe Mama!

01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:55.300
Like that's never been the Joe ever, yeah, and then I'm all, okay, bye, Mr. Mama.

01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:58.940
Which is kind of ironic, because we had a guy under the nickname Joe Mama in the chat

01:50:58.940 --> 01:50:59.940
room earlier.

01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:00.940
I just think that...

01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:01.940
Same guy, you be the judge.

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:03.940
If he's a 35 year old...

01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:05.940
Coincidence? I think not.

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:09.940
Yeah, so that was kind of silly, but nothing entertaining.

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:16.940
What about those, was anybody there a couple nights ago when, weren't you there, Brad, when the drunk people were there and they were asking you how to play?

01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:20.940
Oh yes, this was Friday night? Yes, this was Friday night.

01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:24.940
Oh, it's so funny watching drunk people come and try to play DDR. I wanted to see them just vomit.

01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:27.940
Can you help me learn how to play this game?

01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:34.500
And then then USA is set so you can't fail the first stage no matter how crappy you do, right? Am I right?

01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:38.140
I don't know. I'm pretty sure but it looks like they were on in a little bit

01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:42.100
But didn't we notice them like a minute later walking by them probably okay, like they just said

01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:46.300
Fuck this game and just walked off the machine. You can't fail a beginner

01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:51.700
What is that on USA that the winner basically we don't worry because it's easy for us. Oh

01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:55.620
Oh, it's way too easy for me.

01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:57.420
I get so bored I fall asleep.

01:51:57.420 --> 01:52:01.300
I fall asleep during those ones and I keep playing and I still full combo it.

01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:04.260
I think it would make an interesting freestyle competition honestly.

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:09.220
I was thinking if we somehow do another tourney here in Sacramento or Orange Lounge to broadcast

01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:14.500
from, we should do the shuffle tournament with just the one footer basic song.

01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:15.500
That would be something.

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.220
Yes, I would love to see you do that, Rob.

01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:18.820
Show me your white skill.

01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:19.820
Yeah!

01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:22.140
Is it going to be dabbed next time around?

01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:23.140
I don't know.

01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:27.260
Working out the details with the lovely Dark Sacro right now, so we'll see.

01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:30.660
Don't leak any of that super-secret information there, Irene.

01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:35.620
Well, when there isn't much super-secret information, who'd be lea- anyway.

01:52:35.620 --> 01:52:36.900
I have a funny drunk story.

01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:39.900
Well, it's not really funny, it's just more like self-deprecating, but you guys seem to

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:40.900
enjoy that.

01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:46.660
I was in Vegas once, and of all places, I went to the Hilton at the Star Trek Experience,

01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:49.580
and I had this thing called the Warp Core Breach.

01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:54.300
third, which is seven different kinds of sobi, er, not seven different kinds of sobi, oh,

01:52:54.300 --> 01:53:01.300
that'll fuck you up, that's sobi, um, seven different kinds of ficardi, sobi, and rasmataz,

01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:08.940
all mixed in a giant fish bowl with some dry ice, and um, I drank probably three quarters

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:13.840
of the fish bowl, my friend who I was with drank the other quarter, and uh, I promptly

01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:17.140
went over to the circus circus where we were staying and I got on the USA machine, and

01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:19.700
This is about the time I was right playing about an eight foot level, seven to eight

01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:20.700
foot level.

01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:25.500
I played Afro Nova Trick, being drunk, and it was just so odd because every time you

01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:31.860
jump playing that, you just feel like, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, da da da da

01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:32.860
hey.

01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:37.860
It's the same when you're like really tired or like you're on drugs or something, like

01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:40.180
prescription drugs I mean, like Vicodin or something.

01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.180
When did you start doing drugs?

01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:42.180
No, like Vicodin or something.

01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:43.500
When she started playing Solo 2000.

01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.260
Oh yes, yes, of course.

01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:51.020
nurse made me do it yeah but um no like when I was at the tournament the scat

01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:54.820
and I was on Vicodin because my of my tooth being cold and I was playing and

01:53:54.820 --> 01:54:01.660
I'm like this is so weird it just flows yeah you know I drink beer then I pass

01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:05.660
out so yeah I played after never trick and I actually got cheers a lot of

01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:10.220
people watching me like oh dude look at the guy with the big eyes play in DDR and

01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:14.540
then I went probably back to my room and threw up um oh maybe we should go a

01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:17.620
a little more detail about the throwing up process, Rob.

01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:21.220
Which is not the only time that DDR has made me throw up, but that's for another show,

01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:23.060
so I'm going to go ahead and end this show.

01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:24.060
That's my question.

01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:29.340
Thanks to everybody for being here tonight, Irene, for filling in as co-hosts, but really,

Any final thoughts, Dave?

01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:42.500

01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.580
it up

01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:46.940

The little critters of nature, they don't know that they're ugly.

01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:26.320
That's very funny, a fly marrying a bumblebee.
