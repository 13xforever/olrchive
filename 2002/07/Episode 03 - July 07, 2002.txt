We have a substitute teacher for you tonight.
Everyone say hello to the lovely Irene, or as some simply call her, the Rice Princess.
Hi kids.
Co-hosting for us once again, filling in for the second week in a row.
Yes, that's true.
I apologize for the late start there.
It took us a while to get started.
We spilled some water.
We had a hazard spill when the show started.
It was a flood.
We're doing the show underwater tonight.
And then I realized the microphones weren't even on, so tonight's just a crazy-ass night already, but that's okay.
I'd like to introduce all the other guests we have for you tonight, because we actually have a manageable amount of people in the house tonight.
So everybody say hello to Brad.
Hello to Brad.
You got anything to say, Brad?
He tried burping, didn't you?
Everybody say hello to Dave over there.
Hi.
Hi.
And then say hello to Matt, also known as Loki.
Hello.
All right.
This is episode number three for July the 7th of 2002.
We'll be talking to all our guests a little bit later, but first a quick break.
You have any other thoughts for us, Irene?
Um, I'm mad at Taco Bell, but... We'll get into that a little later.
We got all sorts of crap on the plate for you tonight.
The Solo 2000 stuff, when will it end?
Never.
A review of the brand new Step Mania that's out, and talk about DDR emulators and whether they're any good or not.
A new Bomani game being location tested right now, and all sorts of other crap coming up for you.
But first off, I'm going to dedicate this first song, if you're listening out there, Travis over at understationlive.org, who says I never name his show by name, so there you go.
A lovely show, which I co-host on Saturday nights at 6.30.

Thanks for watching!
and many more.
Thank you.
Bitch, get a new song.
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
That's right, you skanky bitch.
Anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio for July 7th of 2002.
Kind of a slow news week.
Not a whole lot to talk about tonight.
So, I don't know.
I think we're just going to kind of just talk about whatever we want tonight.
Maybe we won't even talk about Bomani at all.
What do you guys think?
I'll sing for you.
Oh, what?
And I... No, no, you're fired.
Everybody dance now
Oh God, we want people to listen to this show, Christ.
decided to get a solo 2000 machine pulled from a bowling alley because of images of ecstasy and vodka and drugs and alcohol and all sorts of naughty things and nurses with syringes in their asses and all sorts of things.
Basically, the only new news item I've got for you guys is that DDR Freak, one of the biggest, I'm sure you guys have heard of it, the biggest DDR website out there, has drafted a response to the controversy.
And you can read it over on DDR Freak's website, but I'll give you some of the highlights for you.
Basically what they're saying is...
A, The Pills.
They're saying when the Youth Advocacy Coalition saw The Pills and I'm Alive, they immediately assumed it was something like ecstasy, but actually, if you look very closely, you'll see it says it's medicine.
It says the word medicine if you look very carefully at the little words.
It says medicine.
Yeah, I'll be damned!
Because none of us are ever watching the backgrounds that closely.
You know what I found out?
What?
This youth coalition, they're just un-American communist pigs, you know?
And how did you find that out?
Did you sleep with one of them?
No, no, no, just look at them, they...
Thank you for watching!
Okay.
Chatroom responding that this really isn't a big deal.
This story is getting blown out of proportion because we're talking about one girl in one group getting one machine getting kicked out of a bowling alley.
The only reason I see it as a big deal is because now it's getting all this media exposure and it is being dug into the ground and beaten with a stick repeatedly.
And it has kind of become a bigger deal than it should be, really.
So I think that's kind of why it needs to be discussed.
Does that make any sense at all?
Yeah, but if we beat it to the ground, then it'll never come back.
I've done it before.
Anyway, also in the response, they also brought up the Dr. Mario point.
Why, if you're going after this, why not ban Dr. Mario forever?
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
That's a good point.
And honestly, if you think that's inappropriate, go to Gulfland on a weekend when the summer park is open or whatever, the water park.
There are girls dressed in way less clothing than that.
I'm sorry.
I just think that it's funny that they compare DDR to Animaniacs in any fashion.
That's just funny.
Also, they're talking about syringes, saying that the syringes were mistaken to be an illegal drug instead of something medical like vaccinations.
And if you notice in some screenshot that I don't see on my screen, syringes are flying around.
They're doctors wearing red crosses, so that means it's medical syringes.
You know what?
Did they not... Bend over, you might feel a prick.
A prick.
You know what?
Did they not make the connection pills, syringes...
Nurse, Medical, Hello?
What does any of that, you know, together have to do?
And then they say about the cocktails.
The cocktail images in the song Club Tropicana do not use cocktail glasses.
Instead, they use glasses more commonly used for smoothies and milkshakes.
And they say, you don't know.
Basically, the end of this argument says, you don't know what's in those drinks.
I bet, sure, sure.
Puzzle Bobble Playboy Pinball Oh, Playboy Pinball, yes Anyway You know what?
No one plays Club Tropicana anyway So they don't have to worry about that there Yeah, nobody plays that song anyway I know, come on
Alright, that's all I really want to say about the Solo 2000 stuff, because we talked about this week on week on week.
And the chat room is saying some things about it, and I'm being given some URLs, so I'll check those out during the next break.
And if there's anything more revealing, we'll talk about that during the next break.
So are we just going to drop it?
Are we just going to... I don't know, is there anything you guys want to say about this?
Because we talked about it too much.
But it is basically the biggest news story.
It's something that everybody's talking about.
It seems like every day somebody new reads this story and goes, Why doesn't that bitch just shut up?
Yeah, why doesn't she?
No, but let's not keep going on this.
Let's just drag it on too long.
But I hate when, you know, the nerds... Oh.
Thank you for watching!
They're fake.
No, they're not.
Well, if, you know, these images of drugs and stuff are causing kids to do drugs, my God, we must have a world full of just drugged out, crazy ass, stupid people just walking around.
Newsflash, we do.
You know what?
I don't see a lot of druggies playing video games.
I think they're too strung out to be playing them.
Apparently you don't go to Country Club Lanes very much.
No, no, no.
Those are like the... I'm not going to even discuss that because I might get shot.
I don't see how they can play video games and be high at the same time or whatever because they'd be too strung out.
Oh, okay.
Well, then I retracted.
I don't know.
Pinballs kind of always struck me as a stoner game.
Is it just me?
Where the hell did you get that?
I don't know.
Just something about all the swirly things.
Yeah.
I think it's a good time to change the subject.
Let's talk about, Matt, you're kind of the emulation expert of the group.
I don't know, is it more appropriate to call these things emulators or simulators, these DDR... I think it'd just be better to call them sims.
Simulators, okay.
So we got major news going on in the Dance Dance Revolution simulator world this week, so why don't you tell us a little more about that.
Okay, well, first off, we have the release of Step Mania 3.0, the beta 1 of it.
It's brand new.
It's got the Max interface on it, including the groove generator and all that kind of stuff.
It's actually pretty close to being perfect as far as interface goes.
One of the nice features I like about it is the addition of an editor.
It's just like the home versions.
You can make your own tracks.
You can help sync the ones that you have to fix them and that kind of thing.
And for those of the people that are listening that don't know what it is, can you explain some of the stuff, like the groove generator and all that?
Yeah, okay.
Well, the groove generator, you've seen it in Max.
It looks like the chart that's got the, basically, graphs.
You've got air and voltage and that kind of thing.
It kind of tells you, aside from saying, you know, this is a kata or, you know, an 8-foot or whatnot, it tells you why it's rated that.
It has a lot of jumps, tons of freeze arrows.
A lot of crazy steps, that type of thing.
It's just to help you out in determining whether or not a song is difficult or not.
Really, it's kind of pointless.
No one really looks at that as far as I'm concerned.
It's pointless.
I can say there is one reason for the groove generator.
A lot of times people want to know how many freezes there are in a song and jumps.
People that are new to DDR, because I've been teaching some people how to play DDR recently,
Dance With Intensity, Step Mania
Setmania, obviously, it's been pretty buggy in the past as far as what I've been, because I've used both of them.
I've been actually testing three right now, and I found it, it's pretty good so far.
I mean, obviously, it's the first beta, so it's going to have tons of bugs in it.
The gameplay itself is pretty good.
I like the fact that you can use BMS files as well as DWI files, which is awesome.
They've added a random select just like you'd find in the arcade.
And just to interject for those that don't know, the BMS files and DWI files are the actual list of steps.
BMS being a kind of old format when these simulators were first coming around, and DWI was kind of when Dance with Intensity came in and kind of gave us a new format.
In fact,
Will that also support Lips and Chains?
I'm just kidding.
How about the Bunga Bunga Simulator?
I thought I'd try something here because I know you guys haven't seen this, right?
Have you seen the new Step Mania, Dave?
No.
Okay, and you guys haven't seen this?
I'm going to try to load it up right now so they can see this and we can kind of get their reaction because this thing is pretty damn accurate to the arcade.
You might be amazed.
So I'm going to load this up.
Now, this might just crash the whole damn show and we'll lose all our listeners.
That's okay because no one listens to the show anyway.
So here we go.
Oh, okay.
DDL Max!
So, we've got basically, it looks like Max, they even have this stupid little logo that's, you know, making fun of Max.
S&M Max.
S&M Max.
S&M.
It's the 7th Mix Red Flames logo.
Everybody's waiting for you.
And then they've got the 5th Mix.
And they've got Rage holding his head like he hurt himself.
Whoa, this is nice.
Pretty much everything looks like it's supposed to.
They even have the Oni courses, which is nice, that you can do.
They just redid a couple of the graphics, but basically it looks exactly the same as it actually is.
One of the things that's a little bit different from SetMini before is once you've selected what mode you're going to play, it kind of goes into something that looks like a fourth mix screen, where you have the different categories you can select from, different folders.
One also cool thing about it is they've added a few additional features that you find in a home version or an arcade.
Some of these are like the ability to do different types of visualizing stuff.
For instance, you know, in an arcade you will have Boo and that type of thing.
Well, they've added some different ones like Drunk, which is the air fourth wave.
Also, it's kind of like Boost, but it boosts and then slows down, boost slows down, and makes it really hard to find...
You know, to read the steps, and then also they have one that's called Scroll, which is your Star Wars type of scrolling mode.
So what kind of scroll?
It's like Star Wars mode, right?
Wow, that was weird.
I guess it gives you, I've never been drunk.
I mean, yeah, I'm the little peruv on here, but I guess that's what it looks like to be drunk when you're playing DDR.
I have to exit out of it because I think it's fucking with our levels too bad here, so... Oh, it's telling me we might be having dropouts on the stream right now, so I apologize for that.
See, I told you when we went into the emulator, it might F things up, but... Alright.
But anyway, so basically, so far, it's pretty good.
It's going to be a little bit buggy, but they're releasing betas.
They've released beta 2 today, so it looks pretty good.
They're keeping up on updating it, and we'll have to see how it goes.
But if you decide that you don't want to stick with Step Mania and you want to actually stick with DWI, which is the other simulator out there, I've been informed that DWI 2.0 will be coming out in the next couple weeks.
What are some things that everybody has to look forward to in DWI 2.0?
I believe that they're going to have a groove radar in it, just like Stepmania.
They were supposed to be redoing the interface, and I forget what else they're adding.
Hopefully they fixed some of the bugs that are in it.
But I don't think too much is changing, actually.
It looks like it's going to be pretty much the same.
I'll stick with Stepmania right now, but I really hate that load time.
That's pretty much it so far.
I'm being told that the stream might be dropping quite a bit, so I'm trying to cut everything out that might be taking up bandwidth.
So I apologize for the drops in the stream, but bear with us, and hopefully it should be okay now that I turned off StepMania.
So that's StepMania.
Woo!
Thank you, StepMania.
Well, no, I'm trying to do too damn much on the system as a problem.
I probably should have loaded up StepMania on one of the other computers in here, but then we wouldn't have had the sounds, so...
So I guess this begins the talk of emulation versus the real thing.
I see this happen a lot on a lot of message boards where people go, well, Max Unlimited, it isn't that bad because I passed it in the emulator.
Well, you know, that was a problem before they were saying that the emulators were way too easy.
One of the things, though, that I've been seeing, though, is there have been a lot of these suggestions that they see out there like, this emulator's too easy, you know, it's harder to play it in the arcade.
Well, they'll try to go ahead and fix it.
In fact, Dance with Intensity, you can actually adjust the levels so that it's exactly like playing it in the arcade.
In fact, what I like about the emulators is you can make it really freaking hard.
There was a guy out there, goes by the name of BimaniRuler, for a while that was doing step files.
They were freaking impossible.
I mean, if any of this stuff was out in the arcade, it would definitely be maximum limited, hands down.
It is just some of the hardest stuff I've ever seen.
And this stuff is awesome, and that's one of the cool things about the emulators, is you can actually make them harder than the arcades.
Yeah, and also with making them harder, you can change the difficulty, like Matt said.
And so that, you can make it harder, and you can add all these crazy things, like in Step Mania, the drunk mode and dizzy mode.
You can have it go, I think, a little bit offbeat or something, and make them wave back and forth.
Just all this crazy stuff.
And people do it, yeah, well, I passed it on the emulator.
Yeah, with your fingers.
That's like playing Thumb Thumb Revolution.
It doesn't qualify as anything.
I can full combo max 300, but that doesn't give a shit about what I can do in the real thing.
Oh, I was just going to say, this is a discussion of emulators versus the real thing like the arcade.
Okay, well, I think the original purpose was to play it with your feet.
You know, that's why the arcade version is playing with your feet.
So I think that emulator versions aren't, if you're playing with your hands, it's not exactly the same as the original intent of it, but everybody has their own thing about it, so...
Okay, well say somebody has one of those little Kiki Joy things, and if you don't know what a Kiki Joy is, that basically will take a PlayStation input and turn it into a USB input, so effectively you could take a Konami pad or a Red Octane pad, whatever DDR pad you use, and then plug it into your computer, which these emulators will recognize.
So now, once again, it is a feet game.
So, does that change things?
Yeah, because the Homepad sucks.
Well, they do.
Yeah, and if you have, like, unlimited amounts of time and money, then you can be like Matt here and build your own metal pads, and then we're like, you know, we're cooking with gas.
That's pretty cool.
But, you know, I've never played on a metal homemade pad, but I don't think it's ever going to be as good as, like, an arcade... Hey.
Okay.
Yeah, if you touch me there again, I'm calling the cops.
Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to derail it, but yeah.
The main normal, like, the standard original stages are the best stages, and that's why I play in the arcade.
Nobody's homemade pad is gonna be as good as those.
I mean, I'm sure they're gonna be good, maybe just up there, but unless you buy an actual Konami original dance stage, which are like a thousand dollars or something, if I'm not right, or wrong, or whatever, they're fucking awesome.
Okay, sorry.
Okay, well let's say you went and you spent, let's say you even spent like the thousands of dollars to buy yourself like an arcade platform and you figured out how to hook it into your computer and everything.
How does it still compare to the arcade?
Is it, you know, to take the emulator itself versus DDR, would it still be, you know, if I pass something on this emulator, if I pass Maximum Limited with my arcade stage at home, is that still, you know, as cool as doing it in the arcade or what?
Well, I think that if you had it on the same difficulty, because, you know, you can make it ridiculously easy to pass.
Like, you can miss, like, 30 notes and have the equivalent to missing one in the arcade.
But, yeah, if you put it on the original, you know, difficulty, and then, you know, just bust out a few songs that you could do, I'm sure that you could just go to the arcade and do the same thing.
It wouldn't be any harder, unless the difficulty on the arcade was changed.
If that were the case, where if you, say, you had basically an arcade set up at home...
on the emulator
I think the only benefit to going back to the arcade would be to get crowds and stuff like that, to make it cheaper at your house, you know, I don't know.
Which is an interesting point that's being raised in the chat room right now.
Jabberwocky again saying, you know, you've also got things affected like acoustics in the arcade and the dance pad, etc.
Kind of bringing up that whole arcade environment, you know.
It kind of makes me wonder, I guess this is a completely different kind of question.
If you spent the thousands of dollars to get a machine in your home, would you still go to the arcade?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, yeah, I mean, honestly, if anyone could have a DDR machine at home, they would.
I mean, you know, there's obvious pros and cons, but, I mean, people realize that there are
and many more.
We're getting a question from the chat room for you guys from DSCS SoCalKicks.
He wants to know, if you have the simulator, would you still buy the games when they came out for the console, or would you just download them?
What do you think?
I can answer that.
I definitely buy all the games when they come out.
The thing is, I buy them for different reasons.
I'm kind of sad I buy them to make edits.
That's what I used to do, and I actually own quite a few.
Fourth, third, fifth, max, even though it doesn't work.
Conomics, USA, Best Hits, Disney's Rave at one point.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Another thing, which is why I first got 4th Mix and Extra Mix is because of Challenge Mode.
And that, for me, is really fun because last week I started doing it again at Rob's house because it's fun.
Did it again?
Yes, I did it again.
Oops, I did it again.
And it's just got some crazy shit that you have to do, like hidden where you have to get all goods or something like that.
And all this stuff that you would never normally try to do, like keep your bar at...
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
and they're going to stop making the games.
Well, that could be the ultimate worst case scenario.
But then again, you're giving them all this money to buy these games when you can just get it for free online.
It's kind of a tough decision.
Personally, I'm poor.
So I would probably download it online if I could.
But I would still support Konami if I could.
If I could.
I've got a huge collection as far as songs go and stuff.
And I have the metal pads and the whole setup and everything.
And I actually built that because I was like, oh, I'm going to save myself tons of money.
I'm not going to go to the arcade.
I'm not going to buy the home versions.
That never happened.
I ended up spending all that money, and I haven't actually, it's just the problem is it's too bulky to set up all the time, unless I actually have a nice place to set it up and keep it set up.
That's why the home versions are awesome, because you can actually just, okay, I feel like playing Fifth Mix, pop it in, and away you go.
And also along the same lines, realistically, most people won't be able to have an arcade set up unless they've got a lot of money.
So I would see that if they don't buy the home versions, they would at least be supporting Konami by going to the arcades and playing the actual arcade games.
I don't know how much money Konami makes off of us importing their Japanese machines into American arcades and then putting money in it.
I honestly don't see that Konami makes any money off the import scene.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm probably not telling facts here.
I mean, somebody else might in the chatroom know more than me on it, but I honestly think, you know, as people have said before, Konami really doesn't give a shit about us, and they probably are making all their money overseas back, you know, at their home.
So, if anybody else wants to say anything...
and their home.
Go to your home.
I'm waiting to see the DDR Max for the US.
We're talking songs that we've supposedly never seen before.
I hope they don't give us anything like After the Game of Love again.
But, uh... Well, for those that don't know the first... Well, I know all you guys know.
But for those that are listening out there that may not know, the first announced song was Over... Over... It was either Overblast or Overdoser.
I always get the two mixed up.
Overblast.
It's the one by LED.
It's Overblast.
Thank you.
Overblast by LED is one of the tracks that's going to be new to America.
It was never in any Japanese DDR game, but it's going to be new to America.
So...
And I think it sucks.
You think it sucks.
I'll play it.
I've got it, so I'll play it for the listening audience out there when we go into our next break.
Is that, I know you just said it's not in any of the other games, but is that the one that's going to be in six style for home version?
One of the unlockable songs?
I have no idea, maybe the chat room can help you out with that.
It's already, it's Beat Mania, I believe it's... Actually, let me plug the chat room real fast, because, well, I got that brought up.
Let me plug the chat room real fast.
If you guys want to join us in our chat room, unfortunately, we don't have a direct easy way from the website just yet.
We're kind of looking into that.
Unfortunately, all the Java people want tons and tons of money for me to get an easy client to do it.
So all you have to do is you just join IRC, and you're going to connect to an other side IRC server, and that'll be on your list of options in MIRC.
One server you can use is irc.eggheads.org And then you're just going to join channel with a little pound sign, Orange Lounge.
And that's where our chatters are.
So come join us if you can.
Sorry to interrupt.
Go ahead and finish the talk.
It's a party in there.
Go in the chat room now.
It's great.
Everybody's taking their shirts off and there's orgasms and stuff.
Orgasms.
Okay, anyway.
Back to the topic.
So anyways, since we kind of just switched topics there, I have no idea where we are.
Yeah, I believe I was saying Overblast sucked, but... Overblast?
See, I haven't heard it yet.
So, okay.
It just reminds me of Spin the Disc, and I think we all know what Spin the Disc was like in the arcade.
Spin the Disc is awesome.
It's an awesome song, the steps suck.
Okay, well, it's definitely not a... was that an 8-footer it said it was?
Oh man, it should be like a 5-footer.
It's pretty...
That's something we should probably talk about pretty soon, is the difficulty rating.
What's Konami doing in these new songs?
They're giving all these songs really high difficulty ratings, but to me, I don't know, and to me and a lot of my friends and stuff, they're seeming really easy.
I don't know, I think Konami just is...
I don't know.
Maybe they're going to start making 13-footers or something.
I don't know.
All right.
Well, we'll take a quick break, and then we'll come back and we'll talk about just that, Brad.
And Taco Bell.
All right.
Taco Bell.
So you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
We hope you're having a good time listening.
Visit our website at orangelounge.skie.cx and drop us an email and let us know what you think.
orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
And here it is, as promised, LED with Overblast.
And it may or may not be changed, remixed for the home version.
We don't know just yet.
This is the Beatmania version, so it'll be kind of close.
So, here you go.
I believe!
I believe!
It's my destiny
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Extreme Bomani Radio.
That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, our live little talk program here.
Jamie Summers, my co-host, is out for tonight.
So filling in, we have the lovely Irene.
Hi.
And a whole panel of people here.
We've got Matt, Loki, Dave, and Brad.
So say hello to everybody.
You gotta speak into the mic.
My left tit and right tit count separate people, so that's like five now.
Right.
You have tits?
I know, you're the skinniest guy I've ever seen.
You don't have tits.
Huh.
Yeah.
Anyway.
Those songs you just heard in that last break, we started off with LED Light from Beatmania 5th Mix and upcoming USA Max version with Overblast.
After that, we had from the Fantasia album, Vanessa May with Destiny and Dumond from 2DX 7th Style with Never Look Back.
And for those that don't know, because we seem to have a lot of new people listening tonight, so that's really awesome.
I thank all you guys for listening to our little show here.
We're in the third week of our new little experiment to try and do a Barmani talk show every week.
But when we're not doing talk, we have a music program that goes on, our Barmani Music and More show, that goes 24-7 on a dial-up friendly stream through Live 365.
And even though it's dial-up friendly, it still sounds pretty darn good.
I was really impressed with it, so we kept it dial-up friendly.
and we have all the 2DX, Beatmania, DDR, Parapara, we've got tons of songs there in addition to that we've got Dance Mania tracks, some of the best from that and then just all sorts of other random stuff occasionally you'll hear a Parappa, Unjamalami tune, something from Pump, something else music game related so do tune into that if you get a chance, that's running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
and we do archives of this show on, I don't know, when did we do it last week?
Monday or Tuesday night?
We did it on Monday night.
We rebroadcast the show.
We'll be doing some sort of regular schedule for the rebroadcast in the future but I don't know what that is just yet.
Anyway, before we went to break, we were talking about all sorts of stuff.
We were talking about the emulation, which kind of led into talk about DDR Max, which led into talk about the Max 2 unlocks.
Songs such as Spin the Disc, Burning Heat, Takume, I Feel.
And some folks on the panel here are a little bit disappointed with the steps.
So do you have something you want to say about that?
Yes.
Um, as my sweet, wonderful girlfriend here, I mean, my princess, said, um, you know, do they do, don't they, hey, I've got, I'm just teasing her and you know you can stick it.
Yeah.
Okay, anyway, um.
Excuse me.
God, that was bad.
Okay, so she was wondering, you know, don't they do sight tests on these machines?
You know, wouldn't people tell them?
And I think I figured out that, like, well, you know, secret songs like I Feel and stuff, they don't obviously sight test those because they want to keep them secret.
Well, you know, surprise, the secret is the steps suck.
Yeah, so, anyway, I think, I don't know, I guess...
Screw you and your computer.
Alright, I'm done.
No more sound effects.
Anyway, I think this new producer, I forgot his name, it's on the little machine.
I don't know if he's a new guy.
Yeah, it's some Japanese name.
Yeah, that's all you need to know.
Shihori Tetsuaki Minuko or something like that.
Minikiniko Okonomiyaki.
Um, uh, he's, I don't know, I guess he's just not trying very hard, because some of these steps, like, bring, he, you know, these aren't great, these aren't 9-3rds, these aren't katas, but I feel it's supposed to be a kata, it's like playing, what do you think?
I feel it's crap.
I mean, I love, I love the song, I love, I feel it's an awesome song, but the steps were just kind of like, okay, they're kind of...
It's kind of like, it reminded me a lot of Orion.
How the steps, they don't really go with the music, but when you play with your feet, it kind of makes a separate instrument.
It's kind of like an added percussion thing.
And that's kind of what they were doing with I Feel, except with Orion, it kind of works.
But with I Feel, it doesn't really.
It doesn't really add anything to the song.
They should make... Oh, excuse me, I burped.
On the standard steps, they do go with the song, from what I remember seeing of them.
Yeah, the maniac steps should have been the standard steps, and then, you know, there should be harder maniac steps.
Hopefully, well, we'll see.
I doubt they're going to do anything to upgrade it in the next version, but I really wish Konami would, you know, and start challenging us again.
The Maniac steps just didn't flow.
That's what I thought as far as the doubles were concerned.
They just, you know, you go, then it's just a really strange beat to it.
It's almost like drifting away, except drifting away made more sense.
It's kind of a faster beat and then it gets slower and gets faster and slower as far as the synth goes in the background, which the steps sync up to.
I feel, tried to do something like that, but it was just kind of all messed up.
It's just...
Not fun to play at all.
You know, the only two 9-footers that I knew were Dynamite Rave and Afronova, because I used to play on... Oh, don't even... I knew that was coming.
And Dynamite Rave and Afronova from USA, the home version.
And so, you know, like, they had Trip Machine, and that's an 8, and I don't think that's any harder than half the stuff, you know, that they're saying is 8s now.
Because they've got lots of songs, old songs, you know, that are not that hard, and they're marked as 8s and 7s and 9s and stuff.
But, yeah, I think they kind of went overboard on the 9s with, uh, on Fifth Mix.
Like, with Wanda, that song was not a 9.
Well, you know...
You know, I think the person that made the steps to I Feel just laid out this huge chart on the ground, and he had a handful of arrows, and he tripped and fell, and he dropped all the arrows onto the ground.
He's like, perfect!
This makes complete sense!
And they were, like, all askew, and just, yeah.
But, um, along the lines of...
Shut up!
Along the lines of bad ranking, I think maybe they're just thinking that, you know, we'll play it if they make it look like it's a harder song.
Because we want harder songs.
And then we play it and it's crap.
And then, you know, we get all pissed off.
You think it's really that, or do you think it's because maybe the people... From what I hear, I'm not too sure on the specifics of this, so I'm probably mostly talking out my ass here.
But on Max 2, a lot of the new songs, it's got a new person in charge of it and everything, right?
So maybe they decided they were going to change the way they wanted to rank some of the songs.
Because they changed other rankings, too.
What do you guys think about this?
The other songs they went back and changed.
Many people say, okay, End of the Century, should have been Akata the whole time.
Good thing they changed that.
Dropout, okay, yeah, that kind of makes sense as Akata.
Okay, that's cool.
You can make that Akata.
Burn in the Floor, what the hell were you thinking?
What's the easiest 7-footer?
I was going to say, did they turn it from a 5-footer to a kata?
Because it definitely was not hard.
Yeah, it's like Moonlight Shadow.
Well, we changed the steps by one step.
You know, we had them go from the left arrow to the far right arrow, so I think they will put that as a kata now.
You know, like something crazy like that.
It's not, but they should do that just to go with all the other stuff that they fucked up.
Yeah, but Moonlight Shadow on 5th Mix, if I remember right, on doubles, was only a 6.
And if you... It's a 7.
But it was one of the hardest ones I've ever played.
I don't even know if I ever did pass the damn song.
It's more like an 8 or a 9.
Just because of all the running back and forth you have to do.
It's easy for you tall, skinny people, but... No, um... Wait, wait.
I just, on that thing, all they did was just change one note from normally when it goes runs across left, down, right, left, down, right, it goes left, down, right, left, right, down, and that's the only thing that they changed.
They take out a note that does a, for a normal, for people who are regulars at doubles, and they realize there's certain patterns that Konami does, you know, so if you played enough songs on doubles, you just, you know the patterns, and you can pretty much do any song.
Moonlight Shadow...
It breaks the rule and takes out a note in the normal run.
And so you're really confused.
It does a really weird turn.
But once you figure that out, it is a 7-footer in my opinion.
It is a 7-footer.
But when it was brand new, that was a pretty hard 7-footer.
You didn't quite understand that change.
Most people didn't notice it.
Isn't that kind of said for a lot of katas though?
Like with Orion 7-8, once you just figure out the beat, it's pretty easy.
Yeah, but I think that's kind of the way it should be, because, well, no, not necessarily with, like, I Feel, because I Feel's got a pretty funky beat.
But, um, but, I don't know, I think Orion is, fits as a kind of, if you play it on one speed, now that maxes out, and you can do the speed multiplier, you play Orion on speed two, it's not a problem for anybody, I don't think, really.
No.
Well, you know, unless you're a beginner, which is cool, but, you know, for people who are starting to play on a catastrophic level, yes, easy.
Well, no one here, but we do have listeners out there, Brad.
People tuning into the show, all sorts of beginners and intermediates and advanced.
What few listeners we do have?
I think what they try to do... I think there's two different categories for katas.
One of them is...
and so on.
I was just going to say the same thing.
You have the stamina and the ones that are hard to read.
Exactly.
The technical and stamina songs that are catas.
So if they can't challenge you one way, they're going to try to challenge you the other way.
But then now with Max and the speed multiplier, they took away that one with the slow song.
Well, yeah.
I don't mean exactly... I mean exactly like off-beats.
You know, that's how they challenge you, is they try to make weird off-beats so that you could just try to... Well, that's iFeel, but it's definitely not a cat-out.
Yeah, I know.
I think that's what they tried to do with iFeel, but it didn't seem to work very well.
What do you guys think about Max USA is supposed to have a half-speed modifier to make the slow songs even harder?
I think that that would be really cool, but no one in their right mind would do it if they wanted to try passing a song.
And going back to something else about the Unlocked songs...
I think that to make them hard, they should be played at a certain speed, and like, Oni modes should have to be played with certain, like, things on certain songs, like, one song, you might have to do Oriden on Hidden, or something like that, and just crazy stuff.
Oh, you mean a new Oni mode type of modifier, where you have to play the song on half speed, or...
Well, you know, in the original testing for Japan, the rumor is, when they tested Max 2 in Japan, the Oni courses were set that way.
The few Oni courses they did have, I think they had like a 5-song course, a 10-song course, and a 15-song course.
And not only did the songs have different difficulties and levels and stuff like that, but they also had modifiers.
But for whatever reason, they decided to say, okay, we're just going to make everybody play us on one-speed singles.
Which I think, though, did make it more challenging, because...
When I played Max, Six Mix, I became too reliant on 1.5 speed, you know, just because it was easier to PA stuff like that, and, you know, I just kind of became reliant on it, using the solo arrows made things a lot easier and stuff like that, and now to go back and have to do everything on one speed, Oni Courses kind of added a little bit of challenge for a little while.
It was like, ah, these arrows are so close together.
For some reason, when I played Fifth Mix, I didn't have a problem, but going back and trying to play Max with normal arrows was just weird.
Oh.
Um...
And, but, I mean, you can, like, with the idea about the certain settings, you can still do it on one speed, it's just a preset, so, you know, one might be on one speed, and then you might have to play, like, let the beat hit them on three speed or something, like three speed sudden, so you get almost no time to look at the arrows, and, you know, just other stuff like that.
I was just saying, probably the reason why they took out the modifiers is because they thought that people might think it's too hard.
I mean, there's people that can play hard songs and PA them just fine, but some people can't do Hidden or Sudden.
And what are they going to put Stealth on one song?
I could see Little working and Shuffle, but I think that's part of the reason why they decided to just not do it.
Well, another thing I'd like to see in the upcoming releases of DDR Max is, I know they have this with the 2DX 7-style, I think it was in 6-style too, where they have an expert course for each day of the year, and it's different every day of the year.
I forget what they call it, but it's actually, it's a new course every day.
Oh yeah, was that started in 7th style or 6th?
I think it was started in 6th, right?
Yeah, because the home version of 6th style is going to have this, where every day you have a different non-stop course you can play.
And the home version of 2DX 6th style is going to have this, where if it's Monday, you've got this set of songs as your non-stop of the day.
And the other cool thing is all these courses will be internet ranking, I'm pretty sure.
Um, RuneNight13 in the chat room has got an interesting idea here, saying that they should make a mode where if you decide to pick a song in an Oni course, you can add modifiers for a certain amount of points, and then use those points, maybe they can be either points on your battery or unlock points or something.
Yeah, I think either, that's about the point I was about to make, make it optional to use the modifiers, and then kind of, I don't know about judging accordingly to that, but yeah, definitely if you want, if it makes it easier for you to do Sudden or Hidden or something like that, then...
Definitely, or Shuffle, then I think that'd be a good idea.
And that is an interesting concept, you know, making it go towards points or towards the battery.
It's a good idea.
Okay, I'm going to take a real quick break since this is top of the hour.
We'll take a real quick break, and when we come back, we'll talk about new features that ought to be in DDR, but they're not.
So you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
We hope you're having a good time.
We do this every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
And hope you stay with us.
Here's some music for you.
and many more.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Bitch, get a new song.
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
and I imagine most of you will be coming back next week, I hope?
Yeah?
Okay, cool.
I'll be here.
Alright, so...
Anyway, we were talking about 401 to break.
New things that they could put in DDR.
It seems like everybody's got this idea, this really complex, cool point system thing that they want to see in DDR.
So I thought maybe we'd talk about some of those ideas.
But first off, the question.
Konami's now putting out a USA version of Max.
You think they're going to put in any other cool new features besides half speed, or do you think they're going to fuck it up?
I think, you know, they should put English in it so that we can read what they're saying.
That's a cool feature.
It's Max USA.
Yes, it's going to be in English.
But wait, you're Asian.
Don't you read and speak Asian?
Yes, all of them.
All of them?
All of the Asians.
All the Nises.
Oh, okay.
Because I thought you guys, you know, it's like same blood.
You know, you guys understood each other.
Are you racist, sir?
I'm being given some insider information in the chat room here.
Supposedly from a Konami of America representative himself said, DDR Max USA will have a lot of surprises.
And I'm hoping it's not surprise, it stinks.
Surprise, I feel the remix.
It's like with the same steps.
I like I feel.
It's going to be Joga singing it.
Surprise!
It's the Joga Mix!
No, no.
We do know that there are some Konami reps working very hard on our side, and we do hope that they are listening to what we're saying.
We think they definitely do have the ability to give us some very cool stuff that will make the Japanese want to import our stuff for a change.
So we'll see what happens.
Anyway, any other cool new modes?
I think that they should have, instead of all the arrows at the top, they should have them in a little circle in the middle of the screen.
And make it like a black hole where all the arrows just kind of do like a suction towards the middle.
Samba.
Okay.
Guitar-o-man.
Or poppin' music.
has this mode where the little blips or whatever they're called, it looks like clacks.
They come towards the front of the screen and right when they hit the front, you have to hit them.
Or, as we were talking about earlier in the show, the new Stepmania has the Star Wars effect where the arrows are in the back and the arrows kind of scroll towards the back.
It's pretty cool.
I wish I'd shown you guys.
We were looking at it earlier.
Yeah, and then George Lucas shows up and sues you for a million dollars.
I have an idea.
If you fail a song, this little midget should come out and kick you in the nuts.
Unless you're a girl and they'll be like, oh, girls rule.
Well, one of the things I thought they should bring back are non-stops.
They could do it like they do with Guitar Freaks, where you have three different options.
Random non-stop, you have courses, like they'll have themed courses, kind of like Oni courses, but, you know, you can't, obviously they're not as hard, and you don't have to PA them.
Maybe just what they do with the order non-stop is they actually have it where you don't gain life, you just lose life as you go along.
So, you know, you happen to
Really suck at one song, you better hope you do better on the next.
And for the non-stops, I don't really see a point unless you don't get life back.
Because what they do now for non-stops is whenever you play non-stop, the difficulty is set to level 1 for any non-stop mode.
So you can play the hardest song that you would normally fail and pass it really easily, but you'd still almost have no life left because you'd have to do 30 more after that.
Irene, the chat room is responding to your idea here, and it's being suggested by DCCS SoCalKicks that maybe the girls could get a foot, but it could vibrate.
And that would be the sound you'd be making?
They could have a finger come out from the back, you know.
Oh, I have a real suggestion.
I think... As opposed to a fake one?
Yes!
Uh, yeah, anyway.
Um, so I was thinking maybe they could randomize the arrows at the top so that they're not all in the same spot.
So that when it comes up, like, they would change the direction of the arrow, you know, and then you'd have to find out, like, you know.
So it's not, it makes it more challenging.
Does that sound stupid?
What, no, it sounds kind of neat.
What would they call it?
Fuck you up version.
Fuck sword you up or, no, I don't know.
Um, like... Roulette style.
Random Mode, I don't know.
Yeah, Roulette Style, yeah, sure, that sounds good.
I think they should bring back Paint Data.
For all those who don't remember that, it was in third mix, not popular at all.
Paint Data?
Like Mario Paint?
It's where you can design your own arrow pattern.
Yeah, I remember that.
I wrote one that said Rob Sucks, and that was awesome.
Yeah, it was funny.
Yes, it was.
What do you think about that, Rob?
It wasn't funny.
I thought it was.
I thought it was rather amusing.
I don't like it.
You'd make them look like penis heads, you know, one to the left, one to the right.
That's so mature of you.
Ew, penises.
Okay, anyway, so...
Any other mode suggestions, things that ought to be in DDR that aren't, type things?
You think they're going to do, when Max 2 comes out in Japan, or Max in the USA, I'm talking about the home versions, or Max in the USA, the home version, you think they're going to do an unlocked system similar to the way they were unlocked in the Max 2 Arcade?
Obviously not as many points.
No, they're going to be lazy, and they're just going to basically take the DDR Max interface that it is right now.
Obviously, since all the other home versions have been, after you play so many songs, one appears.
But nothing like Max 2 or anything like that.
Do you know this for a fact?
Yes, I am all-knowing.
Oh, jeez.
Okay, anyway.
Okay.
And for the unlocks, I don't really think that they're going to put in 750 points or whatever.
Because there's really no point.
They get you to buy the game, you're going to unlock the songs anyway.
Why even make them longer?
Like I said, they just make the points lower.
I wonder, though.
I don't know.
Maybe they'll get rid of the point system altogether.
Who knows?
How about, since the PlayStation 2 has a clock inside it, how about time releases?
And how about we change this with the internal clock ourselves?
Suggested by DarkTetsuya in the chatroom.
How about time releases?
Sure.
What I was going to say was they should make all the unlocks new songs because unless they put enough songs to keep us busy because I noticed on Max2 that everyone was playing all the new songs and stuff but all the new songs became old after a while and then you're playing all old songs and some of the unlocks that you're unlocking after 750 points are older songs.
I think maybe they should reserve that for new songs.
What would you guys think if they brought back link mode?
What's that?
The DDR link mode where it was linked up with the 2DX substream where one person would be playing the 2DX machine.
That's where the Club Appends come from.
For those who don't know, if you've ever played Club Append on the Dreamcast or this 1 and 2 Club Append for Second Mix on PlayStation,
Those songs were the substream link songs.
And where things like Earthlight and Pat Center and stuff like that originally came from, which are now economics.
Mflow owns you.
I think that would be great because while Brad's playing DDR, I could play 2DX and just pound on all the keys at the same time and really mess them up.
What about linking it with other popular session games such as Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania and all that?
Mambo Go Go.
Whatever happened to that supposed link system they were going to have with B4U's CD or something like that?
Oh, yeah.
You were telling me about that.
Yeah, well, before they were making it sound like, oh, you're going to be able to pop the CD in and have secret songs and stuff like that, but that never happened.
Ah, but what about this that they're saying now is going to happen on 2DX6 Style with this V-Rare 2 soundtrack that's coming out?
Supposedly, if you pre-order your copy of 2DX6 Style, the home version, from KonamiStyle.com, or, I'm sorry, it's not KonamiStyle.com, it's called KonamiStyle, it's a Japanese site, um...
If you order it from there, you'll get a special CD called V-Rare 2, which is some rare songs.
They did this for DDR Max.
However, what they say is you put this soundtrack CD into your PlayStation 2 after you've loaded up 2DX6 style and it acts as an appendix.
And now you can play about five or six new songs.
That would be nice.
It'd be nice because, you know, I have a couple extra songs, but it wouldn't be nice for people who don't want to spend the extra cash.
Because, like me, I'd probably get to order it from Japan Video Games or something.
Who didn't pay us for an endorsement, by the way.
No, but I mean, let me tell you why I said that.
Because you can't order from Konami Style because they do not ship to America.
So we are fucked.
Us Americans here in America.
Now, I think it would be cool if they put a... Because one of my favorite features of third mix was the disc change, where you could go back and play second mix or first mix with the cool interface and the vivid arrows and stuff like that.
I thought when they did Konomics, they should have done some kind of link with the first USA.
Maybe they can do that with Max.
I think that would be awesome to do some kind of disc change to kind of get more life out of those old mixes.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I don't know.
I think that'd be cool, because they could play some of the older songs with the speed modifiers and things like that.
I think that'd be a good idea.
Yeah.
Or the solo arrows, all that stuff.
Yeah.
You guys are both holding your mic, so can you please say something?
They shouldn't put two DDR machines together and make, like, what is it, quadruples or something instead of double quadruples?
They... Oh, yeah.
Put two dancing stages together and have a full, like, four panel... Four stage whatever thing.
What is that?
Four times four?
That's eight.
Well, one thing I... Well, there you go.
One thing I do realize that they... Since, you know, obviously we have, you know, economics and stuff and they have that edit feature on it.
But what they forgot to mention is that the edits don't work with any of their arcade machines because the edits, they have like region encoding, kind of like how you can't play US games on Japanese PlayStation.
or vice versa.
It'd be nice if the edits worked this time on the actual machines.
That's what I think.
Also, you know what they should put on the Macs, USA, whatever?
They should make, if you're playing single, they should make a hologram that comes out and dances next to you.
Alright, anyway.
Speculate about the report that Konami of America will have an untitled Konami music game in support of the PlayStation 2 Network card release.
I don't know much about that.
This is all I'm being told in the chat room, is that there's supposed to be some kind of Konami music game supporting the network card.
What kind of ideas?
Okay, let's say it's a true idea.
What do you guys think it is?
Let's say it's a true idea.
The network card is what will allow you to play PS2 over the modem.
And one music game that's going to be using this is Frequency.
You'll be able to play Frequency with people on the other side of the planet or whatever.
What do you think they'd be able to do with DDR in this mode?
Um, maybe just playing Versus with somebody on the internet.
Apparently that quote comes from issue 56 of the official PlayStation magazine, May 2002.
What do you think, Matt?
I don't know.
It sounds dumb.
Oh, come on.
That's my opinion.
I mean, let's see.
I mean, online games are going to be cool, but you can't really do a music online game.
I mean, it would be kind of dumb.
They tried something similar with like a multi-tap version.
I think that MTV music generator thing.
You can get your friends together and make music.
No one cared.
Frequency seems like it would work because you're building one instrument at a time.
So maybe somebody else could be building the other instruments as you're going.
It would be interesting as instruments come and go and things like that.
Something that's being suggested in the chat room, maybe it's just internet ranking.
Maybe all it's going to do is it's just going to get online and upload your scores and you can see how you compare to the professionals and all that stuff.
That sounds feasible.
No, even better, what, um, is downloadable music?
That was just suggested, downloadable new songs if you have a hard drive.
However, from what I hear, I don't know, this is all hearsay, because the whole Final Fantasy XI, I have a friend who's very, very much into Final Fantasy XI, hard disk isn't going to be coming to the U.S.
Sony refused to make it for the U.S.
I don't know much about this, I'm just kind of going off what I heard.
Actually, one of the cool things about the hard disk is actually the interface itself.
You can put any just standard IDE hard disk in it.
Anything that you can buy at like a software store or anything like that, just that would work with a computer, you can plug it right in.
So say you want 10 gig hard drive, buy a 10 gig hard drive.
If you want a 120 gig hard drive, buy a 120 gig hard drive.
It will work with, it just plugs right in.
No, I don't know about that because...
The American ones are internal and the Japanese are external?
Yeah, but see, here's the thing.
The port that it goes in, you just slide it right in.
It has the power port right there and an interface.
I think there's an adapter problem there, isn't there?
No.
I believe it was in either PSM or the official PlayStation magazine.
One of the two had it actually on there where they showed a picture of the actual interface and that you can buy actual hard drives.
And these are just regular hard drives out there.
Problem was is they were having compatibility issues with a few different manufacturers.
But, I mean, you can buy whatever size hard drive you'd like.
Well, that would be nice because Sony's trying to charge an arm and a leg for these hard drives.
It's pretty sad.
But anyway...
Well, I think I'm going to take a quick break because it's getting hotter than hell here in the studio, and I'm going to go get a fan to cool some of us off.
And when we come back, we'll talk about more different Bomani kinds of stuff, all sorts of topic ideas.
If you have something you want us to talk about, why don't you get on in our chat room.
You're just going to join the server.
Any other side IRC server, you're just going to want to go ahead and join.
One of them, for example, is irc.eggheads.org.
And then you're just going to join Channel Orange Lounge.
And that's where our chatters are right now.
And we're going to take a quick break.
And when we come back, we'll be talking about all sorts of more Bomani stuff.
Does that sound good to you guys?
Yay!
All right, here we go.
Thanks for watching!
I've been stuck this whole time
Warning.
Orange Lounge Radio's Bombani Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.
We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.
A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.
That's right, our Bomani Music and More program, which can be heard on this live 365 channel for Orange Lounge when we're not on air.
So anytime that's not Sunday from 7 to 9pm, there's our Bomani Music and More show with 2DX, DDR, Guitar Freaks, and tracks from Dance Mania and other related music game stuff.
All sorts of good stuff.
My co-host, DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers, isn't here this week because she's out at Anime Expo.
But she has a little segment she likes to do called the FU of the Week.
So in her absence, we've been filling in for her.
So we've got a nice little FU of the Week.
And filling in this week is Brad.
Fuck you!
You have a... Fuck you, those ambulances that are driving by out front right now and distracting me.
Yeah.
You have an FU.
If you have something more important to do, like save life... Oh, okay.
No, really, um... Which one should I fuck you about?
There's a lot of things I could fuck you about.
Fuck you about them all, so... Okay.
What the fuck ever.
First, Taco Bell.
It said lemon iced tea, and it was not.
It was unsweetened iced tea.
That sucked.
Oh, I was mad.
Thank you.
Fuck you, Rob.
Um, anyway.
If you're going to be soaking wet, don't you understand the DDR stage is electronic equipment under you?
Don't play if you're soaking wet.
Come on.
You're going to electrify you or somebody else.
Or even worse, when I get on the stage, I'm going to slip and fall and hurt myself.
Then I have to go hurt you.
Fuck you.
Anyway.
and also, no, on the topic of Golf Land, Sunsplash, start teching your machines.
I know there's a tech there, I'm sure he's fixed stuff, but god damn it, fix the fucking coin slot, it's not that damn hard.
Takes two seconds to do and screw the fucking thing in so it doesn't break so fast.
Not damn hard.
It takes you two seconds.
I'm sure you know why you're sitting on your ass doing God knows what you do, or teching this stupid water park.
Oh, like we need the water park there.
Like anybody goes to the water park.
I know.
Who does that?
I mean, seriously.
And those stupid go-karts.
I mean, no one uses those either.
But, God damn it, just fix the fucking coin slot.
I can't spend money if the coin slot is broken.
And you know what makes me mad?
They'll tech something like Centipede or something.
Like some really old...
Fuck you, Centipede owns.
Fuck you.
Yeah, and they want, you know, something that nobody ever plays, you know, before they do DDR or something.
And my personal favorite is that they have people that know how to tech.
They're standing there teching or looking at the machine.
They know what's wrong with it.
They know how to fix it.
But the management's like, we can't let you touch the machine because we just, one, either don't know where the keys are, or two...
You know, you're just training and we're not sure you might fuck the machine up more Even though it's something really simple as Open the door, look at the coin slot Oh, it's a little bit tilted Push coin slot over, coin slot fix Screw in coin slot, close door, machine working You know, maybe they're too busy sitting around in the back You know, pouring themselves a little drink Because all the kids drive them nuts Rob, do you use that sound clip with every show?
Yes, because I only have about five sound clips right now.
Hey, the sound clips sponsor this show, okay?
You know what?
I wish you had that sound clip from Clerks where he was playing the Pharaoh game and they actually get him to do the Pharaohing and he's all, don't you have machines to push these blocks around?
And he's like, yes, good luck.
Maybe next week.
Any other FUs while we're at it?
And that was the wonderful many voices of Brad.
Thank you, many voices of Brad.
Wait, one more.
F you, Brad.
Fuck you, Brad, for not getting Krispy Kreme this week.
You suck.
Oh, well, you know what?
No Krispy Kreme for you.
Krispy Kreme after the show.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, okay, I have an F you.
F you, Brad.
No, really, F you.
Later.
Hey, that, hey, come on now.
Well, I mean, that's sweet and all, but we're on the air.
Yeah.
And while they're at it, why don't they just fix some of these other machines?
I mean, Keyboard Mania.
Actually, just get rid of Keyboard Mania.
No one plays it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I love Keyboard Mania.
Hey, would you rather have Keyboard Mania or Beat Mania 8th Mix?
They're never going to get Beat Mania 8th Mix.
Well, hey, hey, hey.
No, that's 8th.
No, is 7th the final, or is the final going to be the 8th mix?
8th is final.
The final, okay.
Because I don't know.
Because 5Key, I mean, I love B-Maniac and all, but 7th style is what owns.
I mean, 7Key owns.
They should put fucking, you know, actual things that say if the machine is broken.
Like on Hip Hop Mania, they don't say that it's broken.
You put a coin in a coin slot, and, well, it takes the coin.
Yeah, and this is at Grosso Golfing, for those of you who don't.
Yeah, Roseville, Golfland.
Normally, about more than half the stuff is broken because hip-hop mania never works.
Like, seriously, the best that you can ever get it is one button gets jammed constantly and the coin slot takes half your money.
Just another point, too, Beatmania, the final, 8th Mix, whatever, it's all a sham.
Because 5Key still lives on in Beatmania 3.
They haven't announced that they're killing Beatmania 3 yet, so just food for thought.
Yeah, and, I mean, like, they were supposed to end DDR with DDR Max, weren't they?
And, I mean, here comes Max 2, Max 3, you know, so much for Max, like, being Max.
Thanks for watching!
If they do something stupid internally within the company, maybe that would do it.
Who knows, but I don't work at Konami.
Let's just hope that we don't have Konami of the United States building these machines, because then we'll get a really buggy-ass version of a machine, kind of like Konomics, and bringing that out where you step on the left arrow twice and the machine explodes or something like that.
Even if DDR always dies, we always have Pump It Up.
Puke it up, you mean.
Pump It Up is tight.
I don't know what you're all complaining about.
I agree.
It's different.
At first, I hated it, but then the music was kind of infectious to me, and I really liked a lot of the music and stuff, and now I'm just like, bounce with me, bounce with me, bounce with me, bounce.
I like half the music, and I just love how I'm so used to hitting the arrows, like...
I'm not used to going diagonally in the middle arrow, and I love the shimmy on that thing.
You know, Rob, if you really like the music, why don't you just buy it and dance with it at home?
Because I'm white and I can't dance without arrows, so I don't know.
Well, who cares?
No one's going to see you.
Well, actually, you know, they do have the home version of Pump It Up, and also, why don't they just, you know, since, you know, you've got this Marvel vs. SNK and that kind of thing, we can do Pump It Up vs. DDR.
Have, like, some... Maybe one of the companies... You know, Konami should just buy that other company and have it.
Nine-panel DDR.
Oh my god, it's nine-panel DDR!
Oh my god, oh my god!
Huh.
Right.
No, I don't see how you could do the, you know, obviously pump it up versus DDR, except for mix the music, you know, into the game.
Because you can't, you know, have one side of it be the five-panel and the other side be the four-panel.
Why not?
That'd be really... Because that'd just fuck everything up.
I know.
They should just have both panels, you know, like one version is Pump It Up and then you have the panels in the corner in the middle and then one version, you know, DDR.
Both of the panels are nine panels.
And I am being corrected in the chat room as every time we bring up nine panel DDR, what about Technomotion?
That's nine panel dance game.
Okay, I don't count the game unless I've played it.
And I go to Arcade Infinity occasionally and blaze these.
It just...
We have to kind of base our knowledge of stuff off stuff we've played or at least kind of heard about, and unfortunately the information on Technomotion isn't that great.
So, yeah, okay, there is a nine-panel game that exists, but it's obviously not very big because we don't really hear about it except when the question is brought up, what if they should have a nine-panel DDR?
What about that one that they had that was like pressure sensitive on the ground and it had sort of like infrared sensors on the sides, not easy to dance or anything like this is some weird Korean thing.
Maybe this was a dream you had, Matt.
No, it wasn't.
Trust me, the dreams I have are really strange.
Okay, we don't need to go into that.
Oh boy, I don't know if that's appropriate for the show.
Oh, it's appropriate.
Oh.
I had a really strange dream last night about some alarm clock that was possessed by some sort of thing and it was like causing people to do weird things.
It was cool.
What, like play DDR?
In public?
That's pretty strange.
I want ParaPara 3rd Mix
Why?
Because, I like that turn the beat around Oh god, that one, the VCD you brought last week with the turn Alright, that was pretty cool, and if ParaThirdMix would lift up the people's skirts when you do that motion, that would be pretty cool too Dude, they should have that guy in the background, that'd be awesome Ever heard of kilts, girlfriend?
Hey, I want Oonga Boonga second mix, okay?
This is the gayest conversation we've ever had.
Anyway.
Para para, Oonga Boonga, and kilts.
You can't give us more gay hair than that.
Let's just combine them all.
And we'll just have a... Well, I mean...
Look at ParaPara, it's in purple.
You know what, I heard, sorry, I'm like pulling it away from you, give it to me.
Yeah, I heard that little kids really do that in Japan.
Like, I don't know if it's like a common thing, but they like to mess around with people.
They really like put their hands together and make like a gun kind of thing, and they just poke people in their butts.
Yeah.
It's the truth.
We heard it from the horse's mouth.
From one of my Japanese exchange student friends.
Oh, that explains it.
You know, I had that happen to me at a gay bar once, but it turned, no.
Was it Japanese?
No, I don't know.
Yeah, so, no.
Some big, like, football player guy.
Anyway.
I know, it's a cowboy.
We're getting a lot of dot, dot, dots in the chat room right now.
Blink, blink, blink.
I didn't know I was going to tune into this.
Boonga, eww!
I thought we were going to be talking about DDR stuff and 2DX and all that.
Well, you started talking about ParaPara.
Yeah, yeah, that's true.
What did you expect?
Yeah, I fucked everything up when the conversation went to ParaPara.
Well, Patapata and Anal Penetration go together.
Patapata, it's cool.
I don't know.
It's not something to obsess over, though.
I don't know.
As far as I'm concerned, if you want to do that, hey, you know...
Not that there's anything wrong with that, but as far as I'm concerned... So what's the next topic?
Next topic?
Why don't we talk about this?
Another Bomani game.
Guitar Freak's 8th mix and Drum Mania's 7th mix are currently being location tested around.
What do you guys think are some new features these games have?
And what do you think?
Anyway, go on.
And, um...
Yeah, they worry too much about what's coming up next.
Like, they're thinking about what's coming out on, like, probably Max 5 right now.
You know, Max 3 is coming out probably pretty soon.
You have to be prepared.
You know what?
You have to be prepared.
Yeah, gotta be prepared.
Why not just put it in the next one instead of, like, save it for two more?
You know what would be awesome for Drum Mania?
You know how in Guitar Freaks when you wail?
Yeah, I know.
They should have something for Drum Mania.
They should have electronic drumsticks, and every time you twirl it in your hand, you should get points or whatever for that.
Okay, two things.
One, only real drummers can twirl the sticks.
Fortunately, I have that skill.
Well, if you can't twirl it, then improvise.
Pretend like you're twirling it or something.
Wave it around in the air.
It's not a magic wand.
Here, talking about 8th and 7th, which are currently being location tested, here's some new songs that are going to be in it.
Breakdown, which a lot of people, when they heard the song on Max 2, said, this should be in Guitar Freak, so now it is.
And we got a song called Russian Roulette.
I wonder if it's anything like that game show, where if you fuck up, you fall through the floor.
That would be so cool.
That would be the best song ever.
Like, now you get to play Russian Roulette with four drop zones.
Click, click, click, click, click, click.
Well, I do...
You got a good, you suck, drop you to the hole
What do you guys think?
Because you guys have had a chance now to play Guitar Freak 7th and Drum Mania 6th.
What do you guys think about the series?
Well, I love Drum Mania and Guitar Freak's Drum Mania more because I actually drum.
And I've been in love with that since the first time I ever played it in like 4th Mix a long time ago.
and basically they've got lots of modifiers and it's way ahead of DDR in terms of stuff that it can do.
But DDR is kind of catching up now with Max 2 and all this other stuff.
Oh, big old tiggle bitties?
I love Drum Mania.
I'm being told by Virtu who's in the chat room saying that Kakumei is rumored to be in it.
Kakumei?
I don't know.
In Drum Mania?
What in the world?
You know, I forgot what I was going to say, so never mind.
They need to put half the songs that were in Keyboard Mania on there, like the Dracula medley and all the other ones that I can't remember right now.
But Henry Henry actually has a really, really good drum part.
You know, I have a question.
Why did they make the difficulties of the songs different from previous mixes?
Thanks for watching!
No, what they did was, beyond the Nightmare, they only had two settings.
They had Basic and Extreme.
I'm not sure if, uh, Fifth Mix, Drum Mania.
But it was, I think, an 83 or 81 on Extreme.
And I forget, like, a 40 on Basic.
And then they moved the Extreme down to Advanced and made a new set of Extreme steps.
Notes, not steps.
Yeah, that would be fun.
Smash the drums.
I am being told, Virtue sent me a PM and saying that Japo sites are claiming that Kakumei is in Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
So take that as it is.
It would be interesting.
I could see maybe Kakumei being in Drum Mania.
I don't know about Guitar Freaks.
It doesn't seem to have a guitar part.
But you never know.
You never know.
Some other things that are going to be in there.
Power, Another World, Homegirl, Chocolate Philosophy, Kakacha, and Kaiko, my love.
And they're saying that they've also changed a lot of the ratings.
That one song in particular, Newspaper, used to be a 92 on Extreme, and now it's a 55.
So it's like they're taking the scale and making it a lot lower.
One thing I noticed about the difficulty, because I always play basic stuff anyways, because I totally suck at Guitar Freaks, the songs get harder as you play through them.
Like, for instance, if I were to, say, play, um, I believe, like, Eraser Motor or whatever on my third song or whatever, or whatever, Erase, no, it's, yeah, whatever.
Anyways, so if I were to play it on my third song, it'd be like a 40, 43 or something like that.
If I play it on my first song, it's like a 20-something.
It's, it grades harder as you play through the song.
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
It seems like they didn't want to go above the number 100 because I think the highest on the earlier versions was 99.
So they had to, you know, to make the songs harder and not... You know, like, they don't go over a 10-footer on Max now.
So they kind of had to, like, they need to dumb down some of the other ones.
Do you see what I'm saying?
Yeah.
But about what happened with the it gets harder as you go along, that's been like that on all...
The Drum Manias and Guitar Freaks and stuff like that.
Like on the first song, I could probably pass one of the hardest songs.
Well, not one of the hardest, but I could pass a really hard song like Say What You Mean.
But if I tried it as my second song, I'd fail like a third of the way through.
Just because they want you to pass the first song just so you play more and get better.
I'm also being told that Drummania 7th is going to have a total new layout that's going to have genres and artist names, so hopefully we'll be getting some screenshots when they do the location testing in the future, and we'll definitely be talking about that on a future...
Thanks for watching!
but I'm being told it's going to be remixed for Guitar Freaks which makes sense because if you listen to other stuff that was in both My Sweet Darling was kind of a different mix when you heard it in Guitar Freaks, Drug Mania and Long Train Runnin' I think was a completely different artist so we'll probably expect the same thing from Breakdown so here you go we're going to listen to a couple songs and we're going to come back and wrap it up here on Orange Lounge Radio
Thank you for watching!
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
No!
Do we care what people think of us?
No!
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Extreme Bomani Radio.
That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
That's us, and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, our live broadcast for July the 7th, 2002.
The songs you just heard in that little set were Breakdown by B4U, and then from Dance Maniac 7, that was Serena Paris with Do You Love Somebody, and some people in chat were asking what that one was.
Again, for those that don't listen to the Bomani Music and More program, why not?
You should be.
Always playing 24-7 on this live 365 station when our talk show isn't going.
And that's Dance Maniacs songs, because we sometimes throw in some of the Dance Maniac tracks.
Also, after that, from 2DX, Love Me Do, because Virtue was complaining we weren't talking enough about 2DX, so I thought I'd play a song for him.
For all I know, he hates that song, but whatever.
When did Madonna join the staff?
Last week.
You didn't hear?
You didn't get that memo?
Damn, we are so famous.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
www.DarkSakura.com
Anybody?
Nobody has a story.
Irene's got one?
Tell me.
You said during the break you had one, damn it.
It's not anything super special or exciting, but we went to Crestview Lanes, and he was playing on the DDR machine, which is right by the entrance, and this drunk guy, he had a bowling ball with him, and he came up and put it on the ground, and he was watching Brad play, and then he goes really loud.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
Woooo!
Rock and roll!
Oh, once this really long time ago when I was memorizing Bakwa for I don't know why.
And I did a hand plant on one part, and this drunk guy was watching me.
He was like, oh, I can do that.
And so he like, he ran up the machine and tried to do a hand plant, but he ended up like falling right on his ass.
And it was like during my song, too.
And so it's like, okay, get off the floor.
Ha ha!
And the same drunk guy, he comes up to Brad and shakes his hand and says, What's your name, man?
And Brad's all, Brad, and he's all, Yeah, I'm Joe.
Joe Mama!
Like, that's never been the joke ever.
And then I'm all, Okay, bye, Mr. Mama.
Which is kind of ironic, because we had a guy under the nickname Joe Mama in the chat room earlier.
Same guy, you be the judge.
Coincidence?
I think not.
Yeah, so that was kind of silly, but nothing entertaining.
What about those... Was anybody there a couple nights ago when... Weren't you there, Brad, when the drunk people were there and they were asking you how to play?
Oh, yes, this was Friday night?
Yes, this was Friday night.
Oh, it's so funny watching drunk people come and try to play DDR.
I want to see them just vomit.
Can you help me learn how to play this game?
And then...
Thank you for watching!
Oh, it's way too easy for me.
I get so bored I fall asleep.
I fall asleep during those ones and I keep playing and I still full combo it.
I think it would make an interesting freestyle competition, honestly.
I was thinking if we somehow do another tourney here in Sacramento or Orange Lounge to broadcast from, we should do the shuffle tournament with just the one-footer basic songs.
That would be something.
Yes, I would love to see you do that, Rob.
Show me your white skills.
Yeah!
Thank you for watching!
I have a funny drunk story.
Well, it's not really funny.
It's just more like self-deprecating, but you guys seem to enjoy that.
I was in Vegas once, and of all places, I went to the Hilton at the Star Trek experience.
And I had this thing called the Warp Core Breach.
Nerd.
Which is seven different kinds of Sobey.
Oh, that'll fuck you up, that Sobey.
Whoa, bad.
Seven different kinds of Bacardi.
and Sobe and Razzmatazz all mixed in a giant fishbowl with some dry ice.
And pissed.
I drank probably three quarters of the fishbowl.
My friend who I was with drank the other quarter.
And I promptly went over to the Circus Circus where we were staying and I got on the USA machine.
And this is about the time I was probably playing about an eight foot level, seven, eight foot level.
I played Afranova Trick being drunk.
And it was just so odd because every time you jump playing that, you just feel like I'm
I'm flying!
I'm flying!
I'm flying!
Da-da-da-da-hey!
It's the same when you're, like, really tired or, like, you're on drugs or something, like, prescription drugs, I mean, like Vicodin or something.
When did you start doing drugs?
No, like Vicodin or something.
When she started playing Solo 2000.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
That nurse made me do it, yeah.
But, um, no, like when I...
was at the tournament, the scat, and I was on Vicodin because of my tooth being cold and I was playing, and I'm like, this is so weird, it just flows.
Yeah, you know, it's weird.
I drink beer and I pass out.
So yeah, I played Aphrodite Trick and I actually got cheers and a lot of people watching me like, oh dude, look at the guy with the big eyes playing DDR.
Big eyes.
And then I went probably back to my room and threw up.
Oh, maybe we should go a little more detail about the throwing up process, Rob.
Which is not the only time the DDRs made me thrown up.
But that's for another show.
So I'm going to go ahead and end this show.
Thanks to everybody for being here tonight.
Irene for filling in as co-host.
But really, kind of everybody was a co-host tonight.
So a big hi to everybody.
Thank you, Dave.
Any final thoughts, Dave?
My final thoughts is that all the songs that people bash on are not that bad.
Like Pump It Up and Solo 2000.
Okay, that's too... Yeah.
Thank you, Rob.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Well, Let Them Move, that's a different story.
That's just crap.
That's something we're going to be doing in a couple weeks, maybe next week.
We'll be doing a version of Listless that I used to do on my old college radio show.
We will determine the worst DDR song in history.
We'll do that on a future show, so you'll have to show up for that show.
Any final thoughts from you, Matt, Loki, our edit master?
Be kind to each other, and God bless.
Aw, that was so sweet!
Let's sacrifice this young one now, please.
Is that your final thought, Brad?
Oh, okay, it's your experience.
Final thought?
Um, yeah, let's sacrifice him.
Now!
Kill the pig!
And lastly, from the lovely Rice Princess, any final thoughts from you, Irene?
Uh, yeah, yeah, um, Vamani is pretty cool, and I love Brad.
Okay.
Oh, that was so sweet.
This is Rob Roberts, and on behalf of my co-host, Jamie Sakura, DarkSakura, who's out of town, good night to everybody, and we'll see you next Sunday at 7 o'clock.
See you later.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
Orange Lounge Radio stars J.B.
Summers and Rob Roberts, also known as DarkSakura and Sky.
Thanks for listening, and now here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
The little critters of nature, they don't know that they're ugly.
That's very funny.
A fly marrying a bumblebee?
I told you I'd shoot, but you didn't believe me.
Why didn't you believe me?
Happy, happy, joy, joy.
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
