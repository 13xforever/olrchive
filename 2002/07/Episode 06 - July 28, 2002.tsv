53964	58165	I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching case of herpes.
58866	60486	She's my great news.
61246	63607	Mecca lecca hi, mecca hi dee ho.
63707	65787	Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.

68188	69768	I'm working on it.
69848	70288	Loser.
70428	70969	Lame!
71969	72909	On the side of my face.
73900	86667	Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut While I go listen to my Britney Spears records I am your singing telegraph
90169	99554	Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, excuse me, on planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.
100274	105577	That intro brought to you by Krispy Kreme Donuts, being regurgitated by me as we speak, thank you.
106237	110599	You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.
110959	113120	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
113480	118023	Joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
118063	118143	Hey!
119662	123204	This is episode number six for July the 28th, 2002.
123464	129207	We are joined in studio once again by a whole lot of guests, including a few travelers tonight.
129567	131988	Say hello, everyone, to a familiar freestyler.
132008	132809	You might have heard of him.
132989	134610	His name's Mel B. Give it up.
136091	136651	Give what up?
138251	139691	Do I have to give up freestyling?
140331	142772	No, I thought you already threatened to do that already.
143312	143872	Oh, yeah.
143912	149613	No, see, every time people think I retire, it's just like, I'm retiring my clothes, I'm retiring my shoes.
150093	153394	You know, it's like, I don't know, I just get bored, I guess.
154334	156114	It's hard being perfect with nothing to do.
158955	162996	Thank you, Mel B. Also, please give it up for the biggest Sharks fan on the planet.
163016	163696	Say hello to Melody.
165908	169771	Any witty things you'd like to add to follow up to the... How can I follow that up?
169851	171092	It's just absolutely impossible.
171112	174275	Do you want to threaten to retire anything here on the show tonight?
175796	177577	I think about my sharks, I'm sorry.
177617	178698	It just doesn't happen.
179299	179799	Fair enough.
180439	183061	And we've got a lot of other regulars in the house tonight.
183142	186624	As I go around the room, we've got Brad... I'm Brad.
186904	187305	Bradley...
189399	198105	Paul, Matt, Irene, and that's about it.
199106	199806	That's everybody.
199907	202608	So we'll be talking to all of them a bit later, but first a quick break.
202668	203629	Any other thoughts from you?
204129	206251	I have a thought.
206631	206811	What?
207212	208753	The mouth of a child's plate.
208833	209693	I said that wrong.
210534	211294	Well, let her finish that.
211314	212555	Wait, you want to finish that thought now?
213096	214477	Deep thoughts by me.
215265	218006	I don't have any deep thoughts, so just go to break.
219847	221488	We already went halfway into break there, my bad.
221528	222028	Sorry about that.
222549	224370	Technical inconvenience, there it happens.
225270	226751	What, technical incompetence, what?
227311	229772	Technical incompetence, user incompetence right there.
231413	232674	We're going to break, I'll be right back.
274974	275615	Thanks for watching!
337228	337989	Thanks for watching!
613405	622328	And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse pomani band, Erotic.
622748	624769	Do it all night, do it with me.
625209	627570	No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.
627630	628951	Do you take vocal lessons?
629031	629991	Kill your teacher.
630491	631491	In the heat of the night.
631952	634172	Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
635353	636033	I liked it.
636533	638074	Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
638174	638594	Next.
641474	642895	Um, that was cool.
644316	646078	Do you even know why you're here?
646158	647839	That was just bloody pathetic.
647900	648380	Next!
651302	652764	Come on, do it with me.
653704	654966	Yes, yes, that's it!
655306	656447	We have a winner!
657248	661051	A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
662190	665954	Every Sunday night, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
665974	666894	You're repeating yourself.
666914	667535	You are listening.
667575	667875	I know.
667895	668496	I like to repeat myself.
668516	670377	I think a star just fell out of the sky and died.
671298	672479	It landed on somebody.
672519	674721	If a star is falling, though, shouldn't she be making a wish on it?
675281	676422	Yeah, I wish you don't follow me.
678544	679725	Quite the optimistic, aren't we?
680566	682588	Oh, Jamie's been having a pessimism week.
682888	683268	It's fun.
683308	685130	Does that mean we need to start off with your FU of the week?
685570	686111	Hmm.
686771	688853	Alright, I think we need to start off with Jamie's FU of the week.
689560	690902	Jamie's F.U.
690942	691643	of the Week Jamie's F.U.
691663	691923	of the Week
706232	712741	Okay, I'm sure people who read my live journal and who know me know that I've gotten addicted to this game as of late.
713342	713983	I was happy.
714023	715044	I was having a good week.
715104	717528	I got goggles, which you can't get on the current beta.
717608	718749	I traded half my armor for it.
718769	719691	And what do goggles do?
720091	720772	They just look cool.
720952	721173	Okay.
722093	724755	They do, seriously, all they do is look cool.
725695	726716	Jamie has to be cool.
727116	728677	Heaven forbid Jamie's uncool.
728777	734220	I got a 1 in 10,000 chance item that each creature will drop, that 1 in every 10,000 creatures will drop 1.
734281	737222	I got a card, sold it, got more goggles, sold that, got more money.
737422	739263	Now this is Ragnarok or EverQuest?
739283	740244	This is Ragnarok Online.
740284	740744	Ragnarok?
740804	742025	It's sounding like EverQuest here.
742665	744186	No, this is my own crack.
744427	745587	I do not play EverQuest.
746628	750170	Anyway, so I'm all happy and looking forward to getting levels when the server goes down.
751312	760454	and then the server comes back up after I try to sign on to the damn game for an hour and then the character server goes down so I try to log on and hey, my character's missing, yay!
761094	767016	By the way, for people who do play, if you see that the characters are not showing up if you make a new one, you will never get your old character back.
767776	768316	Isn't that nice?
769396	772237	So, I've been sitting here now for
773254	781261	A couple days not being able to play Ragnarok because either the character server is down or the main server is down or doesn't just want me to log in or this other crap.
781962	785826	And so I'm just ready to say screw it except I am an addict.
787647	789049	Now do you have any other FUs of the week?
789929	790970	DuploWeb, damn them.
792111	793813	I hate DuploWeb.
794934	795855	Any particular reason?
796784	802386	You know how they make Duplo blocks for small children or people who ride the short bus?
802786	803066	Yes.
803806	808767	DuploWeb is like that, except it's for, you know, lobotomized newborns.
809548	813309	That's how stupid you have to be to go with DuploWeb.
813449	821911	And me, you know, they did such a good job the first time we had Sackbay Mania, and then they've been just utter poopy heads lately, you know?
822471	823432	Yes, I'm being filtered.
826372	828714	It's our new Orange Lounge Language Filter 2000.
828754	832436	You know, I figured I used up all of my... That's a bunch of bull poopy.
834077	835198	Owl Machino movie.
835898	845684	I figured I used up, you know, all of my fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fucks last week, so I'm gonna be nice today, so fuck them up their asses!
848166	849767	And... I hate them.
849927	851128	They need to die!
851148	854570	They need to go to hell and die there.
855706	858207	So if anybody wants to give me money, do it now.
859528	861289	And we'll have a thank you next week.
862009	862250	Yes.
863370	866792	Whoever decides to give me money, I will not do a fuck you in your direction.
866812	867132	Thank you.
868353	869473	And that's it for your fuck you of the week?
870074	871314	I'll think of something else in a minute.
871354	872375	Well, I have an F you of the week.
873536	875076	I have to play my F you of the week theme song.
876037	881580	Because my F you of the week... Because when I start complaining, I sound like a chicken, so I have to play this song.
882737	888964	My FU of the week is traffic in San Francisco, especially around the 101-80 junction area.
890345	891266	What a piece of shit.
891346	893429	I mean, the people there cannot drive at all.
893489	894770	They don't know what lane they're supposed to be in.
894790	898775	Shouldn't that be like an FU forever, not just for the week?
900256	909560	Well, it pissed me off this week in particular because I was trying to come home today because I moved, for those that don't know, I moved the show out of the little tiny room into the big living room tonight because I knew we'd be having more guests.
910000	914142	And I had about, oh, probably about 20 minutes to move the computer out here into the big room because of traffic.
914182	915863	I'd hoped to have a couple hours.
916623	917684	That didn't quite end up happening.
917724	921366	So my FB of the week is people who can't drive and cause me to get home late.
921986	928067	You know, I don't foresee that getting any better because people are getting dumber and dumber and dumber as, you know, time goes on.
928527	934988	Instead of, you know, being, you know, we're going to eventually have to evolve from a Funky of the Week to a, you know, Funky with a Rabbit Horse of the Week.
936769	937369	Rabbit Horse.
938849	939109	Yes.
941950	943850	Irene's talking about a rabbit horse.
944610	945730	The rabbit horse.
946150	946610	What am I doing?
946711	948771	It's the rabbit horse with big, sharp, pointy teeth.
948971	949151	Arrgh.
949963	951123	Okay, worst radio ever.
951163	952724	You don't make signs with your hands.
953024	953844	They can't see them.
955685	955885	No.
956625	957586	We don't care what they see.
958846	960367	Because they don't see what we're doing.
960387	961727	We're doing this show to entertain ourselves.
961847	962067	Yeah.
962107	962868	To hell with you.
963468	963948	I'm just kidding.
963988	964488	Stay connected.
964508	965189	Please, we need ratings.
965209	966069	Don't go anywhere.
968250	969050	We actually care.
969110	970170	We just pretend otherwise.
971051	976893	You know, it's cool to not give a shit, so that's what we're doing here tonight.
978813	980674	Yeah, anyway, let's start to our guests, shall we?
980714	983497	Let's save this train wreck show and talk to the new blood here tonight.
983837	986559	We have some guests and I'm scooting over to get near the guests.
987280	990022	Everybody say hello to Melody and Mel B. Hi.
990242	990643	Hello.
991023	992785	So what are you kids doing in town this week?
993885	995667	I don't think that can be put on the radio, sorry.
996628	999050	I mean, what brings you to Sacramento this week?
1000591	1002493	We just had to see all you wonderful people.
1005466	1006767	Such a freaking suck-up.
1006967	1008128	You're trying to make me clean house.
1009368	1009728	Yeah, I know.
1009909	1013010	You only showed up just so we'd all clean our houses, basically.
1013050	1014151	Didn't my mother send you?
1015511	1017212	Damn, my evil plot has been foiled.
1019874	1020274	Dear God.
1020414	1023576	Anyway, I'm trying to think.
1024636	1025857	What else has been going on lately?
1025917	1026937	We could talk to Melody and Melvia.
1027138	1028198	How about the CBGL?
1028218	1030900	You guys are the only ones that are at this big tournament at CBGL last week.
1030920	1031560	What did you guys think of it?
1033062	1040750	From a freestyle perspective, I would probably rank this as one of the top two or three freestyle competitions I've ever been to, probably, arguably in America.
1041671	1048198	It was definitely just, you could have taken the top 15 people out there, they probably would have placed in any other run to middle tourney last year.
1050460	1051581	Bar has gone sky high.
1052562	1055065	So you think every other tournament now is going to have to live up to this?
1056486	1058367	It would be unfair, but I would not be surprised.
1058387	1063771	The good thing about it is you still have the vets that are coming out there, guys like Trampower, Lil B, and all that.
1063791	1064692	They're still doing their thing.
1064712	1066113	They're living up to their reputations.
1066213	1069515	But you have a lot of people coming up from Scandia, from out of state.
1069535	1072337	There was a kid from Omaha who absolutely wrecked shop out there.
1072977	1076800	And they're the new blood, and they're still experiencing all this great freestyle hype.
1076820	1078261	They're still in love with the game.
1078381	1086006	And as long as we get those new people up in there and they're busting their ass, I mean, it's going to be a positive thing for freestyle and general attorneys.
1086947	1087207	Right on.
1087487	1088848	What did you think of the tournament, Melody?
1088888	1089649	Just going to watch.
1089789	1091971	Do you go to a lot of tournaments?
1093172	1095273	I get dragged to a lot of tournaments most of the time.
1096274	1101538	Honestly, this time I did not see a single freestyle because management sucked ass.
1102159	1104281	They refused to move the machine outside.
1104341	1106422	They created a huge fire hazard indoors.
1106482	1108264	If any of you have been to Castro Valley...
1109168	1111111	It's very small.
1111371	1116899	There is a small inner room that has the DDR machine and they did not move the damn machine outside.
1117039	1120884	So it was too dang crowded and the air conditioning was not working inside either.
1121665	1124349	So management was just being very hard to deal with.
1125210	1126592	You're getting into an FU of the week there.
1127862	1139893	Okay, well, this would be my FU of the millennium, probably, but hey, we had many run-ins with the manager of Castor Valley, and for someone who agreed to hold the tournament, he should have been a lot more accommodating.
1140493	1144237	I believe Mel was waving desperately, wanting to throw another comment in there.
1144901	1150563	Oh, and I guess I'd have to do a quick FE2 at 8-Ball because he was the one that chickened out of a judges-only freestyle tournament.
1150863	1157486	There was going to be some money on the line, but his excuse to the attorney director who, you know, approached me, said, do you want to do a freestyle tournament for judges?
1157506	1158347	I'm like, hell yeah.
1158927	1168731	And he said, well, I won't have anything in time or, according to, from what I heard around the grapevine, apparently he thought whatever prize he was going to get was not worth risking his reputation over.
1170391	1170692	Okay.
1170992	1171272	Right.
1175191	1180536	So who are some of the new freestylers you guys think we're going to be hearing about in the next two tournaments?
1180556	1184561	Just doing awesome jobs and people you might never have heard about that maybe you should start paying attention to.
1185892	1190797	Well, I think the biggest contingent of freestyles that are blowing up are the ones from Scandia.
1191178	1196463	That would be guys like Hypnox, he's been around, but you got guys like Lou Styles, who's absolutely amazing.
1196503	1201789	Anyone who thinks 8-Ball or Dinkot are good pop lockers, this guy has just taken it to a higher level.
1202269	1207655	You got, who else, oh yeah, Bruce Leroy, he's one of the most charismatic guys out there.
1208495	1212339	and just for people in general, there's that kid from Omaha I told you about.
1212379	1213240	His name was Tequila.
1213941	1218225	He just recently joined RTF, which you may or may not know is my crew, Return to Freestyle.
1219006	1226373	He was that good that practically after his first routine, guys just wanted him, swept him up, and he's made quite an impression on everybody.
1227433	1233176	Tell us a little more about RTF, because that's kind of a big, pretty well-known... Oh, he's going to give you the whole spiel here.
1233216	1237177	Give us a breakdown, because anything else you want to plug here while you're on the show, go for it.
1237217	1241279	But tell us a little something about RTF and how it all started and what it stands for and all that.
1241690	1246291	All right, well, for a quick rundown of the history, RTF started around January of 2001.
1246471	1250293	It was actually Turnarocci, the tournament at Metreon.
1250633	1257695	It was about the time when people, we got sick of DDR USA, and people at freestyle tournaments weren't really putting up a good effort.
1257735	1259495	They were just sort of improv-ing on stage.
1259515	1262276	You weren't putting any time or thought into it.
1262316	1268258	And so one of my friends was like, don't you remember back when we actually used to bust ass on freestyle, when we actually used to be creative and, you know, give a damn?
1268758	1274842	and I thought about, and although I wasn't one of those guilty people, you know, he was just saying, yeah, we have to go back to our roots.
1274882	1275882	And I was like, yeah, I'm all for it.
1275902	1277023	We've got to return to freestyle.
1277063	1278284	And so the name kind of stuck.
1278304	1282266	You know, it was a lot better than like the Foot Clan or, you know, something else that was already taken.
1282566	1283447	I remember the Foot Clan.
1284508	1286729	And so from there, you know, we just got a few people.
1286809	1291392	At first it was like Shintenshi, me, Mike Ngo, Asian Innovation, then Bran came along.
1291412	1296075	A few people, and then I think our first major tournament was the Arcade Infinity 2 tourney.
1296115	1297155	That's the one where I took Solo 2K.
1297235	1297535	Okay.
1299397	1304941	and, um... No, we do not need a solo sucks anyway comment.
1305742	1308724	Yeah, besides, don't you know the new catchphrase is this DDR sucks?
1309524	1309825	Yes.
1311411	1313492	So yeah, that's just pretty much RTF in a nutshell.
1313532	1315553	We like to have a good time.
1315573	1317613	We're all about just good times and all that stuff.
1317673	1321134	Freestyle is just, you know, one of the things we happen to like to do.
1322575	1328357	As for other plugs, well, DDR Spot, of course, is the site that I help run along with a couple of the RTF members.
1328977	1331078	We're about to do kind of a new thing.
1331118	1333299	We got a lot of new stuff coming on right now.
1333459	1337220	Interviews with Jason Eno's doing like stuff about we're usually breaking news with
1337880	1344205	Imports, and all that kind of stuff, because we're affiliated with Team Guilo and Vimaniac, so we've got a good base of connections.
1344806	1347128	And basically, keep coming to the site.
1347168	1352572	We are adding a lot of new stuff daily, and who knows, you just might get knocked on your ass the next time you get there.
1353873	1354393	Sounds pretty good.
1354413	1355854	Anything you want to plug while you're here, Melody?
1356795	1357276	Whee!
1357296	1359237	Alright, thank you, well put.
1361539	1363300	You got nothing to plug but your ego today.
1363320	1365502	It's just, I'm here, I'm here because I rule.
1365722	1366423	That's why you're here.
1367405	1368766	Everyone knew that already, though.
1369967	1370847	Melody, all these rules.
1371688	1372228	My bad.
1372288	1372708	I'm sorry.
1372748	1373509	Excuse me, ma'am.
1377491	1380693	I noticed that you took an interesting trip out to Omaha lately.
1380893	1382033	You actually went out to help.
1382534	1384575	Were you running a tournament out there, or what was the deal with that?
1385115	1397304	Yeah, actually, it's a funny story because I had a friend at Tequila, actually, he caught me on IM, or basically on the three courts, and he was saying that their first freestyle tournament that they had absolutely sucked because the judging was terrible.
1397364	1404749	He showed me a videotape of what they did, and he was clearly more talented than everyone else, and he ended up taking third, so I was like, dang, you need someone to really run a tourney well.
1405570	1409495	And he said, well, why don't you come out here and show them how it's done?
1409515	1411278	And I was like, you mean me compete?
1411678	1412159	And he's like, yeah.
1412219	1413561	I said, well, if I had the money, sure.
1413861	1418308	And he basically, he and a few friends offered me a whole bunch of money to come out there and compete.
1418368	1421812	I was like, wait a minute, you're going to pay my way to kick your ass?
1422433	1423975	I'm like, something just didn't register.
1424015	1427418	And for a moment, you know, I actually had scruples and I felt bad about it.
1427458	1434144	So I was like, tell you what, you take that money, you let me run your tournament, you know, give you the California experience you probably won't get anywhere else.
1434704	1437767	And that's kind of, you know, how it ran from there, went to their arcade out there.
1437807	1443392	And surprisingly enough, for an arcade in the Midwest, you would think they won't have that much B-Money or just be that good.
1443972	1446693	I would say it's probably the most impressive arcade I've been to in, like, three levels.
1447013	1453936	One level is just pure retro with, like, Kung Fu Master, Karate Champ, and, like, a place that has Karate Champ, man, how can you beat that?
1454316	1456017	And Popeye and, like, all that good stuff.
1456457	1458158	And their Bimani was really well-stacked.
1458198	1461659	In fact, that's the only place in America I know that has a linked Pot of Pot at second mix.
1461999	1469122	I was blown away, and, uh, it was actually just nice to get out there and just see how Bimani's just really, uh, you know, blown up it.
1469142	1471483	We're in, like, the smallest-looking cranny of America.
1473982	1477263	I kind of noticed this might be starting to be a trend here, because I know I was reading another story.
1477443	1480624	Another freestyler went out to, I think, New York or something to help run a tournament lately.
1480644	1482404	I don't know if that was 8Ball or somebody.
1482484	1482704	Was it?
1483405	1483885	Baltimore.
1485565	1490627	8Ball did go out to a tournament in, I believe it was Baltimore, Maryland, but he was actually judging it, from what I understand.
1491087	1499709	Do you think this is an interesting trend that seems to be developing, where people from the West Coast are kind of running all over the nation to be competing and judging and running tournaments, or...?
1502341	1503061	It's a plague.
1504642	1517269	Actually, I think it's just really a matter of promoting Vimani in general because they know Californians, you know, we've been out here since the beginning and a lot of us are, you know, well-known just throughout the community and they think drawing in the name will draw those hardcore fans to come out there.
1517289	1522551	And I said, people like that girl from New York, Jen, she came out here twice and twice she's placed.
1522671	1529635	So it shows that people want to come out here or, you know, go out there because, you know, they love the game and they just want to get out there against the best.
1531072	1532613	Do you guys think it's ever feasible?
1532673	1538276	I know this is kind of one of those topics that's one of those like on the popular message boards comes up probably once a month or whatever.
1538296	1542138	Do you guys think it's feasible to one day have like a national DDR tournament?
1543047	1543948	Oh, anything's feasible.
1543988	1547169	It's just a matter of actually putting in some manpower and a lot of money behind it.
1547510	1550011	But if they really want it, it can happen.
1550591	1558235	I think there's enough educated people out there who can judge a freestyle or set up some kind of almost foolproof rules for PA.
1558436	1559696	It's very feasible.
1559736	1562698	I think people just have to have the money more than anything.
1563840	1564120	Right on.
1564841	1565762	Where would you like to see that held?
1565782	1573148	Because personally, I'd be rooting for Vegas, because just Vegas rules, and they've got tons of stuff to do there, but of course, if you're under 21, it kind of sucks.
1573528	1577972	You know where I actually had a good crowd, believe it or not, is actually in Gulfport, Mississippi.
1578872	1586839	They have pretty large arcade facilities and some of the casinos there, and of course, you don't have to be over 18 to get into the arcades there.
1587119	1589081	Lots of space, too, and a really good crowd.
1591481	1593502	Anybody else got any questions or anything?
1593522	1595822	Did everybody run away to go play Sixth Style or what's going on?
1596583	1597263	Seems like there's a mystery.
1597283	1599103	Anybody else got any questions, things to say?
1599563	1599723	No?
1600944	1604385	Paul's like, you got Sixth Style?
1604405	1605125	Yes, it's in the other room.
1607785	1608666	Go, play.
1608686	1613867	I don't know, where else do you think we'd be able to hold a good tourney?
1615015	1618937	I think Vegas is probably the most popular choice.
1618977	1623099	I would say LA would probably be your next big choice because everyone loves California.
1623499	1624219	E3 is out there.
1624499	1626060	Obviously that's like the entertainment mecca.
1626380	1631822	So I would think pretty much your main metropolitans, LA, New York, Chicago would be your top three choices.
1632062	1633263	Seattle would be pretty cool too.
1634167	1641209	I agree, and Seattle's got a lot of really good Perfect Attack players there too, and they'd be able to probably come up with a really good system, I think, for PA as well.
1641630	1645171	Reading some stuff that they did for a recent tournament of theirs sounds like it could be fun.
1645211	1652873	It almost sounded like a game show, the way they had it laid out, where people are taking off songs and putting them back on, and all they needed to do was have a trivia challenge.
1653134	1654294	You know what I think would be awesome?
1654690	1655570	No, they don't vote people out.
1655691	1662974	Is to rent a small stadium, like a baseball-type stadium, and get up a big monitor.
1662994	1664795	Do you think they could seriously fill one of those?
1665596	1667937	Well, I'm not saying a large one.
1668097	1670218	Like a minor league stadium.
1670498	1677562	If we had a tourney that was a national event, that would probably be the prime way to do it, would be to have the machines out there and have a large monitor.
1678963	1688606	Actually, from some of the footage I've seen in Japan back in 98 or 99, some of their major tournaments were actually held inside amphitheaters, inside concert halls, that kind of thing.
1688626	1692107	There was an actual stage, there were spotlights everywhere, it was a big production.
1692127	1696888	I have a few videos of that, and it looks like a really happening thing.
1698428	1701089	It's certainly being tucked away in the corner of an arcade.
1701649	1706951	What if a place like Great America, Paramount's, I'm thinking Paramount's Great America, because when I see that there's this...
1707998	1717942	Some videos that go around the net that happen to be Pump It Up, but when I see those videos, I'm kind of reminded it looks like an atmosphere where it's kind of like Great America's little amphitheater, which is, you know, it's a fairly good size, but it's not huge.
1718742	1722183	Well, part of that, you know, is also the organization of the tournaments.
1722643	1724524	From what I learned from a friend who's in Korea...
1724964	1745818	Pump It Up is actually, like, not just an arcade phenomenon, it's actually things where, like, YMCAs would actually have Pump It Up teams, and, like, my friend, he actually had a Pump It Up teacher that he went to, taught him all this stuff, so, like, they had these factions from different parts of town, they go to these huge events, and that's, and really, a lot of it's not even a contest, it's just an exhibition of people showing off what they can do on different songs.
1746338	1747939	That's part of what DDR is going to need.
1747959	1759723	It's going to need almost like backing from other companies or like little factions that have the means to, you know, get publicity, to get money and so forth to have these huge events out of Great America, you know, the amphitheater or wherever.
1760856	1762677	What would you think of an exhibition-style tournament?
1763757	1767938	I mean, just to have like an invitational exhibition-style tourney.
1768378	1769658	Oh, I think it would be great.
1770038	1779761	I mean, it's gotten to the point where prizes are great and all, but really what it boils down to is you could really weed out the people who really love the freestyle and just love the crowds.
1780481	1782782	It would be just cool to have an exhibition go out there and just do this.
1782822	1783922	Hey, you know, we're doing it for fun.
1783942	1784922	We ain't doing it for prizes.
1784963	1786523	We just, you know, want to entertain.
1787966	1791971	I was also thinking, you know, what about like a, you know how they have the People's Choice Awards?
1792391	1793974	What about a People's Choice style tournament?
1794795	1795496	Have crowd voting.
1796840	1798621	Um, I know 8-Ball wouldn't win.
1799362	1801323	That was wrong.
1802964	1805966	Okay, um... The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio?
1806666	1811029	Well, you know me, I mean, I'm all about the dirt and all that kind of stuff.
1811289	1813391	If you don't hear it from me, you're going to hear it from someone else.
1813711	1814831	But I got love for me.
1814871	1819014	It's like, you know, from a competitive standpoint, I want to kick everyone's ass, everyone's an enemy.
1819054	1823757	But afterwards, hey, we'll knock down a beer and, you know, we'll let you gloat about what you did ten years ago, but hey.
1823957	1824257	Okay.
1827955	1831057	And you kind of have this gasp look of surprise on your face.
1831097	1832098	Molly, anything you want to add?
1832818	1833899	That wasn't surprise.
1833939	1837641	That was agreement, Sam.
1839262	1840603	We won't bring up the event from last night.
1844176	1846278	Inside jokes here tonight.
1846598	1847859	Did you have something you wanted to say, Matt?
1848059	1849620	I thought I saw your hand like halfway up in the air.
1851262	1857967	I was just going to say I was reading on the DDR East Coast Invasion boards that J-Dog went to help a tournament in Florida at some point.
1859128	1859809	I believe.
1859889	1865153	It was someone from the DDR Free boards that I recognized that went to Florida to help a tournament.
1865273	1867636	I didn't hear about a Florida tournament.
1867836	1870379	I don't keep tight taps on everyone, but I wouldn't be surprised.
1870419	1872802	J-Dog's a pretty big man in demand.
1872822	1875285	It was Florida or Atlanta, I can't remember.
1876186	1878989	Well, if it comes to Atlanta, usually it's Inawan.
1879430	1883955	He ran a tournament in Atlanta about a year or two ago when he was actually living there.
1884810	1887712	Yeah, all I know is they just, they love him over in the East Coast.
1887732	1893416	So it's like, trying to get them to listen to the show and plug in, but... I guess that's a good question.
1893476	1895957	How do you feel about fanboys and fangirls?
1896918	1902381	I mean, because DDR, it's like, you know, you're bound to get some fans to download your videos online.
1902421	1906924	You're a fairly well-known freestyler and stuff, and people kind of, like, start to get to know you.
1906944	1909326	Or, you know, want to know more about you and what have you.
1909746	1910767	Do you think that's kind of weird?
1911227	1913508	for being a fan over DDR?
1913848	1915629	How do you feel about the whole phenomenon?
1916349	1919530	I think everyone's a fanboy or a fangirl of someone that they love.
1919610	1929274	I mean, you know, jeez, if I were to meet, like, Weird Al, like, up close, five feet away from me, I'd be all, you know, be like, Oh my gosh, that's how to... You go, boy, with your best self.
1930675	1932977	You know, but it's, you know, to each their own.
1932997	1935339	I think it's just, you know, a sign of appreciation.
1935359	1937381	You know, if they appreciate my dance, hey, I'm all for it.
1937421	1939223	It's like, who would have thunk that?
1939643	1941885	Just getting up and doing something I do just for fun.
1941925	1943206	People would download me.
1943246	1944347	They'd try to copy my style.
1944367	1946029	They want to find out where I did stuff.
1946109	1949392	It's, you know, they say flattery is honesty and all that.
1949412	1951093	It's the truest form of whatever.
1951414	1951894	Ah, ha.
1952214	1954836	Imitation is the finest form of flattery, right?
1955516	1956396	That's what you're here for.
1956416	1957277	You're there to correct me.
1957937	1960398	Did I ever tell you about what happened when I was in Mississippi?
1961319	1962960	Go ahead.
1962980	1965841	I showed up late for the tourney because I was going to be in it.
1966802	1971965	The question I got was, when I told people who I was, they were like, Oh my God, you're DarkSakura?
1972045	1972845	Wait, do you know Mel B?
1974506	1974726	Wow.
1974746	1976087	That is truly what I got.
1976367	1978088	And the other question is, do you still have the bat?
1980312	1982872	Oh, the bat from Miggle 2, wow.
1983293	1985373	But yeah, just a quick on the fanboys and fangirls.
1985413	1990355	I guess the only time it really hit me was when I was in Canada, of all places.
1990395	1995517	I was in Vancouver visiting a friend, and then some guy actually recognized me from my Santa Monica video.
1995577	1995897	I was like...
1996841	1998282	Whoa, out there?
1998923	2005048	Yeah, I gotta admit, it's kind of weird, but at the same time, hey, I got nothing but love for everyone who's got love back.
2005448	2008371	For me, it's all about the game, but if they like me, hey, it's all good.
2008651	2010112	They like you, they really like you.
2011233	2015897	I guess they're not asking me for my PIN number for my ATM card, hey, it's all too good.
2016718	2023061	I guess my next question would be for Melody, because it's no secret, she doesn't mind me saying, Melody, Mel B, and Idom here, right?
2023721	2026142	Yes, it's okay to say on the show, yeah, duh, okay, just making sure.
2026162	2028883	If you kill all the jokes about Mel and Mel, oh my god, they're the same.
2029163	2030724	We've heard them millions of times.
2031744	2035226	Some people don't like that stuff coming out on air, but no secret.
2035246	2038307	So how do you feel about the Mel B fanboys and fangirls?
2039142	2041425	It can be rather on the interesting side.
2041546	2046092	As Mel just sits there saying, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
2046112	2049237	Now we want to hear the funny, embarrassing stories because that's what radio's for.
2050342	2051703	Funny, embarrassing story.
2051883	2052783	No, just say it.
2052883	2053744	No, that's us.
2054524	2055825	Don't fanboys or fangirls.
2058827	2060648	It's kind of something you just have to learn to deal with.
2060748	2070713	It can be hard, but it's kind of something I'm starting to come to terms with that he's going to be out there and that it really is a form of flattery.
2070754	2074115	People really like him, but as long as they keep their hands off of him, I'm happy.
2074135	2076717	Because he's mine.
2077614	2079802	Noah, she loves the fanboys, hates the fangirls.
2082284	2103254	But yeah, just a quick funny fanboy story, though, was I remember Drags 1, that was when I did my After the Game of Love routine, and I was kind of pimped out in the zebra hat and the feather bow and all that, and at one point my feather bow sort of came apart, and there was a feather that flew around, there was this one team, at the time they were Team Epsilon, I think, and one guy said, oh my god, this feather's cool, can I keep it?
2103274	2104294	I'm like, well, okay, sure.
2104694	2107776	I see him at a tournament about eight months later, he pulled the AI-3,
2108636	2110377	He comes up to me, hey man, I remember you from Drags.
2110397	2111057	I'm like, oh yeah.
2111217	2115440	And he busts out his wallet, pulls out that feather from the boy, he says he keeps it for good luck.
2115500	2116580	I was like, ooh.
2117100	2122823	That's when I came to realize, you know, it's something I gotta deal with, you know, and I'm actually all happy about it, hey.
2123504	2123984	Celebrity.
2125225	2128266	Hey, you know, I mean, some people like the spotlight, some people hate it.
2128887	2130207	I can embrace it, no problem.
2130547	2133509	Do you think it's odd at all that DDR is something that kind of creates celebrities?
2135797	2138498	I've seen Stranger Things create celebrities.
2139779	2142720	I guess if you can be a celebrity through Star Trek or Survivor.
2142740	2148322	So who are you going to take the sponsorship from, Pepsi or Coke?
2150843	2152044	I would have to go with Pepsi.
2152484	2152884	Alright.
2154064	2155125	So Pepsi, give him a contract.
2157657	2158718	Ask another real quick question.
2158798	2166123	What do you think was the most... Because you go to a lot of tournaments all around California, and now even some outside of California, too.
2166143	2168205	I've got the UK tournament going in October.
2168545	2170006	You're definitely going to that, huh?
2170046	2171127	King of Styles 3, yes.
2171367	2171727	Right on.
2173249	2181014	What do you think to date has been the most... I guess I wouldn't say the best or worst tournament, because that's too hard to judge, but maybe the most fun tournament that you went to?
2182475	2183636	Most fun tournament?
2184277	2185277	I would have to say...
2187932	2191453	Probably... I'm going back.
2191794	2194895	I think probably the most fun tournament was the first ever Metreon tournament.
2195815	2197956	It was, yeah, about August of 2000.
2197996	2201238	That's when, like, NorCal's... That was really their first major get-together.
2201278	2203138	That's when Metreon was holding it.
2203178	2204279	Pepsi was sponsoring.
2204359	2205739	KOA was doing their thing.
2206460	2208341	And that's, you know, when I was in freestyle.
2208721	2212182	There were, like, two tiebreakers I had to go... There were two tiebreakers in freestyle.
2212202	2215484	Like, one I had to go against Mike No for first place.
2215604	2216104	You know, we...
2216864	2217665	both went at it.
2217685	2220106	We had to go through improv, we had to go through routine.
2220426	2226290	They had to pull almost every tiebreaker in the book, but it was just a lot of fun afterwards.
2226490	2230052	Because everyone out there, it was back before drama really existed and all that.
2230472	2235155	So it was a sign of times when we were all still bonded together by this whole DDR thing.
2235175	2238577	We were all together before our personal lives sort of took over.
2240017	2242419	I guess this is going to be an odd question, but was DDR better then?
2244869	2248411	I think it's not so much it was better, it was just the fascination was still there.
2248931	2270622	And at the time, we had 1.5, not a lot of us had third mix or any other mix to compare and yearn for, but nowadays it's like once DDR comes out, we like it for a few days, then we're like, well damn, we want something more, because we realize how fun DDR can be, and it's usually hard to recreate that first genuine pure love you had for that feeling.
2271022	2271983	It's like, you know, crack.
2272003	2276388	You know, you get the first hit, all you're trying to do is you're trying to replicate that feeling of the first time.
2276448	2277449	It never quite happens.
2278090	2279792	Orange Lounge does not endorse drug.
2281955	2282295	Alright.
2283596	2285519	Anything, anybody else want to add anything, or...
2285979	2287400	I think it's probably about time we go to a break.
2287420	2289261	We've been on for about a half hour straight, if not more.
2289341	2290802	So I'm going to go ahead and go to a break.
2291083	2292824	They were playing Sick Style in the other room.
2293264	2297087	And they were playing Changes, I don't know why, one of the new songs.
2297187	2300709	But when we come back, we're going to talk about Sick Style.
2300789	2303832	So anybody else want to leave us with any thoughts while I queue up some songs?
2305953	2306233	Think.
2306754	2307034	Think.
2307374	2310336	Remember to stay on the pill, because I won't hurt you, but the next man will.
2312458	2313438	Wiser words were never said.
2505733	2507404	Friend Fortress, Thunderstorms
2626078	2628459	I apologize for cutting off the last song there.
2628739	2632440	We were trying to listen to The Outer Limits and I made a technical boo-boo and it got cut off.
2632980	2633360	Sorry.
2633600	2634641	Rob pooped on the machine.
2634781	2639942	So I'll give you another LED track from New to Six style and maybe we'll get back to Outer Limits a little later.
2640042	2641363	So my apologies.
2755857	2759960	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
2760200	2761902	Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?
2761942	2762322	No!
2764684	2766025	Do we care what people think of us?
2766645	2768507	No!
2768527	2769928	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
2770408	2773290	Yes!
2774471	2779195	Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
2779818	2794724	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and in that last set we had a couple of the new tracks from the Six Style home version which is kind of the biggest news in the Bomani scene this week is that Six Style was released in Japan and so of course all the fans of 2DX are importing it here.
2794924	2795584	It's pretty.
2796004	2796804	And it's cool.
2796824	2801506	We were going to talk about it last week but unfortunately none of us got our copy in time but we have them this week.
2801606	2802187	I got mine.
2802207	2803307	I slept through mine.
2803747	2808330	I finally caved and bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 this week just so I could have Six Style.
2808890	2811211	And so it's out in the other room right now and there's people playing it.
2811732	2812192	What do you think?
2812212	2813273	What do you guys think of Six Style?
2814033	2814633	Do we like it?
2815714	2818316	Woohoo!
2818336	2820097	God, you people are dead this week.
2821737	2822338	Go play it.
2822358	2823238	Go in there and play it.
2823378	2825240	If you haven't played it, go in there and play it.
2825260	2828782	And for, you know, just come on, everybody who's listening, come on over to Rob's and play it in the other room.
2829642	2830903	Don't keep the address out, that's all I ask.
2831940	2843265	Well, I think probably the best thing about Sixth Hour is for the simple fact that every 2DX machine out here that I know of has a really stupid, freaking unreadable screen, and now you can go home and the movies actually work.
2843725	2844925	I mean, wow.
2845105	2848327	Who knew that the video for Wow Wow 70s was so fucking cool, huh?
2848347	2848927	That is awesome.
2848967	2858171	Well, don't forget about Bearcade, though, because Bearcade does have probably the best quality machine now in California, except for maybe AI that I've played.
2858211	2858391	Yeah.
2859131	2863574	AI screen is not that great because now the blue and white keys all look green.
2864035	2866636	So it's not bad, but not stellar.
2867057	2871860	The only time I ever played that one was November last year, and I think that was right after it had been replaced.
2873021	2879785	I haven't been to AI in a while, but just as long... SHGL's old machine was by far the weirdest one I ever had to play on.
2880366	2886410	I've never seen people just quit in the middle of a game because they got so sick of trying to read the screens.
2886690	2892111	I usually like to get my whole money's worth when I play 2DX and I did walk away from the machine when I was there last November.
2892531	2899693	That's the only machine that I ever had such a bad case of vertigo playing because the sides of the screen were burned out in a circle.
2899713	2901233	I thought I had tunnel vision the whole time.
2901453	2903414	Now does any 2DX machine in the U.S.
2903474	2909095	have working videos or is this the first time a lot of us get to see these videos unless we downloaded them online somewhere?
2909615	2913298	For SixStyle, the only time I ever saw working veils was temporarily.
2913318	2917201	They did work at AI, but anywhere else I did not see them going.
2917562	2917962	Interesting.
2919203	2923366	Any other cool videos you want to point out that people should check out if they get to play this?
2923386	2923967	On SixStyle?
2924227	2932053	Well, seeing as how I've only ever played it here at Iguana Girl's house, I think it's one of the Eurobeat ones.
2932293	2933894	Linus, Mel B says Linus.
2934154	2939478	One of the Eurobeat ones had the bunny from Keyboard Mania.
2940199	2943861	I remember playing it and absolutely failing it on 7-key.
2944222	2947724	And then stopping right in the middle of playing, look over, oh my god, is that the rabbit?
2948425	2949125	Just like that.
2949806	2952888	And it distracted me worse than the evil Satan fetus from 250 BPM.
2957196	2959438	G2 also has a really awesome video too.
2959478	2960799	That video scares me.
2960839	2964542	It's got like trans-circa aliens or something.
2964622	2966103	It's weird stuff.
2966143	2968385	You expect to see her floating in a glass jar or something.
2968445	2969105	It's pretty scary.
2969425	2972007	I have to say, as always, the Orange Lounge videos are the best.
2972588	2972928	I agree.
2973228	2979413	Now, did you notice for about a half second in the Wow Wow 70s video, there's a shot of the two girls from the Mobile Moga video with afros?
2979633	2979873	I was...
2981690	2984014	The only thing that really distracted me was the building with the fro.
2985095	2989561	Which, by the way, is going to be replacing my Pocari Sweat icon on my live channel.
2989922	2990262	Right on.
2991384	2992966	Now, Bradley, you're a big 2DX fan.
2992986	2994749	You got any videos that people should be checking out?
2995151	2995852	Well, not so far.
2995892	2997853	I've been playing too much to actually watch the videos yet.
2998534	2998954	Sounds good.
2998974	3003618	You know which one I actually just like to sit on my computer monitor and just sit in the background and just watch?
3003678	3004980	It's the one for colors, honestly.
3005580	3007842	Because it's just so pretty and trancy.
3008042	3008863	And it's colorful.
3009544	3010905	It makes me happy.
3011305	3013087	It makes me the color of blue.
3014268	3016149	Oh, I was a fool to let you walk away.
3016730	3016930	Wait.
3018348	3023593	Another neat thing about SixStyle is it has new movie mode, or movie clip mode, where you can watch the videos full screen.
3023913	3027516	It's nice, you can put it on autoplay and then just watch the video screen with no notes or anything.
3028698	3029378	That's pretty awesome.
3029578	3036324	And a good idea, an idea for anyone who has it, you can do is you can set up a course and make it autoplay and it just goes through all the videos.
3036745	3038967	You can just watch like ten videos in a row if you want to.
3039841	3040442	Oh, that's pretty cool.
3040722	3044285	And actually, it's a good way to hear the anothers, too, because you can just autoplay the anothers.
3044325	3052232	Like, that's how I heard the Something Wonderful another, because I just beat Something Wonderful on a 7-key for the first time, so I'm not quite ready to tackle the another yet.
3052673	3056676	But since the another now has vocals, I really wanted to hear it, so I played it in full-screen mode.
3056696	3063122	But I have to say, music clip mode scared the hell out of me the first time, because I ran it with Jelly Kiss, and it was like, oh my god, Santa's taking over my screen.
3063562	3064003	It's crazy.
3064023	3065324	You got something you want to add?
3065504	3073407	I don't know, just seeing those videos of, like, the guys playing all the stuff one-handed, it's gotta be the most demoralizing bit of footage you could ever watch for 2DX.
3074628	3078549	Those videos just scream, Americans suck at 2DX.
3078589	3082511	For the people who don't know what Tetsujin means, it means Iron Man.
3082771	3084051	It's named that for a reason.
3085072	3087913	You know, those are some absolutely fantastic players.
3089001	3092463	It's like, is that trying to spin off on Iron Chef, like Iron 2DX?
3093524	3096485	I don't know, it's like Tekken for 2DX.
3097305	3098806	You know, the king of iron fingering.
3099987	3100647	Whoa!
3101568	3104589	Never mind, I said another... Remember that part about adult content?
3106950	3111173	I was referring to this in a completely innocent manner, you pervert.
3112825	3115246	I think we know what our last week on Orange Lounge clip will be.
3117606	3118666	Okay, you can bite me now.
3120527	3125128	I'm going to go sit back in my chair the rest of the night, let people deliver me donuts and vanilla Coke.
3125168	3126308	Look at this setup we have here.
3126368	3129128	Jamie's kind of sitting in her throne here, the big blue chair.
3129148	3130769	The rest of us are all sitting on the floor around her.
3130829	3131769	Hey, I offered the chair.
3133429	3134009	The chair is mine.
3134029	3135050	The chair is rightfully yours.
3135130	3136310	I am the Vicodin Goddess.
3136890	3137930	The Vicodin Goddess?
3138150	3138510	Of course.
3138670	3139851	And what makes you the Vicodin Goddess?
3139871	3140751	Because I'm well-medicated.
3142511	3144152	I have to medicate myself to do the show.
3144452	3151035	Are you under sedation?
3151255	3151856	Give me that.
3152276	3156017	SoCalKicks is saying, let us remind you, were you moist yesterday?
3156778	3157378	Or last week?
3157578	3160560	Dude, you still haven't sent me my proof that you passed my edit.
3162520	3163221	No GameCube pen for you.
3163261	3164401	Nice question dodge there.
3166042	3177748	When you send me the proof that you have passed my edit with a 90% perfect attack and full combo, then I will be nice to you and send you your GameCube pen, maybe if you retract your question.
3180390	3180750	Maybe.
3181290	3181690	We'll see.
3181730	3183091	We'll see what he has to respond to that.
3183191	3192176	In the meantime, let's break from six-style chatter for a minute, and let's let Matt, also known as Loki, give us an update on what's going on in the simulation scene, because there's a lot of news this week.
3192576	3194257	Last week, he drowned his students at the pool.
3198596	3202443	Yes, actually I do that very often.
3202603	3204145	It's just very fun to kill them off.
3204466	3205868	But anyway, I have an update.
3205948	3207711	SoCalKicks has retracted the question.
3208373	3209675	Okay, you can have your pen, send me proof.
3210908	3223531	Okay, in the sim world, boards are still down, still have Team Guilo down, still have the Melting Pot down, and also the actual DWI official board down, but there's a bunch of mirrors out there.
3224211	3234493	Really no updates as far as programs go, there was a small update to Dance With Intensity 2.0, it's now 2.003, which I haven't really seen any changes.
3234993	3238554	The video still doesn't work in the background for me, so that kind of sucks, I'm very disappointed.
3239895	3247222	One major news thing is actually going to be with DDR East Coast Invasion or their website ddrei.com.
3247563	3251487	They're having their second DWI Tourney Mix 2.
3252368	3255251	It's going to be running for the whole month of August.
3256051	3258432	And there's actually a few different things you can enter in.
3258452	3262854	They're going to have a light, standard, and heavy entries you can do.
3262974	3266135	Light is for people that are just getting into making DWIs.
3266195	3271997	Standard is, you know, basic, you know, anyone that's kind of seasoned doing DWIs.
3272057	3275759	And then heavy is just for the elite, which I'll be entering in because, you know.
3277353	3278534	No one has the ego here.
3278554	3280596	You doubles know.
3300177	3303658	I'm actually thinking about entering one of these edit contests just because I'm pretty bored.
3304118	3307119	So, I mean, hell, we got this show off the ground.
3307299	3310000	What's that say about free time?
3310060	3311940	No life plus no talent gets you a talk show.
3312700	3315081	And I did rip that line from Space Coast Coast to Coast, thank you.
3317342	3325044	It's being said in the chat room, Pyroman is saying, hey, rumor here that Stepmania Beta 5 out very soon, possibly tomorrow.
3325704	3326444	Have you heard anything about that?
3327685	3330606	No, I haven't, but hopefully it'll work a little bit better this time.
3330946	3336267	See, the only thing that I like about Step Mania is it's got a lot of nifty, shiny stuff in it.
3336307	3340408	You know, they have the new features as far as, like, modifiers you can use, songs.
3340468	3347149	But the thing I really hate about it is, because I have a huge song collection, it takes forever to load the damn thing up.
3347629	3351910	I can sit there for about five minutes watching the thing scroll by because it's reading all my songs.
3352470	3353370	and it just takes forever.
3353490	3366455	Whereas, like, you know, back in the days with even, um, Delight Delight Reduplication, one of the old simulators, what it does is it scans, you scan your music list and it'll build a list and that way it loads instantly every time.
3366535	3367796	Same with, uh, DWIs.
3368136	3368536	Same thing.
3369356	3373838	And, you know, Step Mania is kind of dumbed it down where it scans your music list every time.
3373938	3374918	So it takes forever.
3375079	3380641	So if they just fix that, then maybe, you know, I might go over to Step Mania, but I'm sticking with DWI for now.
3382061	3385582	Oh, I was going to ask our guests some questions, but they ran in the other room to go play Six Style.
3386483	3388763	So that's all on the simulation front then for now?
3389064	3390744	That's it until all the boards come back up.
3390784	3401128	Hopefully they won't have any more bandwidth issues with Team Guilo, because I love reading that board for the news, and then when that goes down, so does the Melting Pot and DWI.
3402728	3404009	Paul, you've been awfully quiet all night.
3404029	3404849	Do you have anything you want to add?
3406567	3414252	I've been out of town this week, so I'd just like to tell anyone who goes through the Santa Cruz Boardwalk to not go to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, because the arcade in there is pretty bad.
3415253	3418194	The only thing there for Nostalgia is Beatmania Complete Mix.
3418254	3421737	It's kind of fun to play for Metal Gear Solid, the remix there.
3422157	3424098	And then they do have Percussion Freaks, but no chair.
3424918	3430542	So if you want to play Percussion Freaks 4th Mix with no chair, standing up, you'll get real sore, but you'll have fun.
3431342	3432283	It's kind of a new thing there.
3433021	3433702	I have an announcement.
3433942	3435104	I have a donut.
3435404	3436826	Donuts are good for you.
3438328	3439189	They're full of chocolate vitamins.
3439209	3439429	Seriously.
3454303	3457745	We're going to take a quick break because everything is getting distracted now with 6th style.
3457805	3458586	It's top of the hour anyway.
3458606	3461007	We're going to take a quick break and we will come right back.
3461087	3463128	I have to give a few plugs before we go to break though.
3463408	3463889	A few things.
3465610	3468231	SoCalKicks.com is now up and running.
3468331	3470973	SoCalKicks, he has a cool little site there.
3471813	3474434	And Jamie's edits are up there, which you can go download.
3474674	3475354	They're very cool.
3475654	3479575	And all sorts of news and things like that, especially, as is in the name, about SoCal.
3479595	3481835	So, SoCalKicks.com, you can visit that.
3482635	3487316	If you haven't heard it yet, we do have an original work by Kiel in rotation this week on the website.
3487396	3489837	So, I'm sorry, on the Bimani Music & More program.
3489877	3496358	So, do listen in on the Bimani Music & More program, which runs 24 hours a day on the station when we're not live.
3496478	3499239	And we're starting to take some original works and remixes.
3499979	3500839	of Bomani stuff.
3500899	3510463	So if you have anything you want to add for that, send it to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com or any comments and things you want to give on the show, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
3511403	3514944	And because I did promise, so I'd like to say hi to Ash because you said you'd be listening tonight.
3516285	3519306	And thank you for helping boost us listeners in your area.
3520186	3525588	And hello to everybody who's deciding to listen tonight and we really appreciate the support.
3527250	3528571	Yes, thanks everybody for listening tonight.
3528651	3528931	Awesome.
3529451	3533453	And also 2DXstyle.net is up and running once again.
3533533	3537194	And they've got a nice little button for us on there.
3537214	3538015	That was really awesome.
3538035	3538955	I wasn't expecting to see that.
3538995	3541116	So thanks to them for supporting us.
3541176	3542556	And we'll support you best we can.
3542917	3544717	So do go visit their site.
3545118	3548699	They're trying to build a location page of every 2DX machine in the nation.
3548759	3551360	And it's fairly up to date from what I'm being told.
3551400	3553021	So go take a look at that if you get a moment.
3553401	3554121	Okay, we're going to go to break.
3554161	3555582	And we will be right back.
3575628	3576531	Thank you for watching!
3609744	3610605	Well, I'm a chemist.
3610765	3612427	I leave the lab ready to explore.

3615451	3617474	I kick the notes and verbs in my speech when I flow.
3669780	3671005	Adam's Moon Soapbox
3704192	3725687	Well I'm a chemist, I'm in the lab ready to explore I drop the fuck the fat rhymes like no one has before I kick the melted verbs in my speech when I'm flubbed I'm not like a devil that sucks you for the dough or the drugs So he can teach a tribe in the veins I keep the low-pro makin' ends with my friends Free skills, oh shit, I'm flubbin' with mad styles Don't even try to step on my lyrics, I'm mad foul
3791600	3795563	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3943829	3944469	Thanks for watching!
3994567	3995316	Thanks for watching!
4047417	4053365	Here's one of the songs that they skipped over for Parapara Paradise that was from Initial D. This is Dave Rogers running in the 90s.
4054166	4055028	Parapara Paradise
4087202	4088523	Thank you for watching!
4142052	4143193	All I Wanna Get Is You
4277845	4278698	Get your money going
4329717	4333364	The Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Balls
4338954	4342716	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio live as we are.
4342956	4346658	Gosh, I'm just not being friendly with Winamp tonight, are we?
4346778	4349219	I think I'm going to shoot this thing in the head.
4349239	4351940	Rob is held mesmerized by our sponsor, the Swedish chef.
4352781	4353281	You know what?
4353301	4354762	We just threw a fish at him and Rob went crazy.
4354882	4360665	I think Winamp's mad at me because when I logged in today it said, upgrade me, and I said, no, I need to have a show to do.
4360925	4361845	Mine tells me that every day.
4361865	4362345	I think it's protesting.
4362365	4363306	I think it wants to disown me.
4364764	4378956	I want to say a big hello to everybody in the chat room right now over on irc.egheads.org or if you just download MIRC you're just going to want to connect to any other side IRC server and we're in Channel Orange Lounge.
4379476	4381077	We're joined tonight by some special guests.
4381238	4385081	We've got a whole bunch of our regulars here and also from out of town we've got Mel B and Melody.
4385801	4389923	So, everybody's kind of running in and out, though, playing Sixth Style as well.
4390463	4391603	Kind of seeing what's going on there.
4391623	4395245	I don't know, what do you want to talk about now, Jamie?
4395285	4397345	I'm kind of running out of things to discuss.
4397525	4403988	Well, we're thinking of having a news segment, you know, to sort of, again, focus on the and more part of our radio show.
4404068	4404308	Yes.
4404528	4412371	The weekly anime review, which, you know, I think I'm going to review something pretty old school that Mel brought up earlier today.
4413532	4415655	My review of Lupin the Third.
4415755	4416656	Hey, more DDR2.
4416676	4417857	Yeah, hey.
4417897	4418959	Castle of Cagliostro.
4419559	4421322	One of the best anime ever.
4422203	4426668	You know, I see people who are going off on, oh, Hellsing is cool, which it is.
4427529	4429371	I saw Hellsing for the first time last night.
4429391	4431294	Oh, Hellsing owns, but we're reviewing old stuff.
4431974	4432215	Okay.
4432947	4436449	And this is also another reference to old school gamers here.
4436850	4446736	Who happens to remember the game Cliffhanger that sort of played like Dragon's Lair and Dragon's Lair 2 and that other sort of weird game that featured the cowboy?
4448797	4451919	I don't remember that game offhand, but it was time something.
4455267	4476727	Anyway, the whole thing with Castle Cagliostro is, I don't know how many people have actually watched the Lupin TV series, which was really awesome, but basically it features him going after a crime syndicate that's been responsible for the counterfeiting for centuries, even, funding wars.
4478048	4482931	and going after, but there's also a little mystery and a little bit of romance attached to that.
4483051	4487973	You know, I'd recommend, it's definitely something that if you rent it once, you'll definitely want to buy it.
4488113	4490455	And, you know, certainly for people who love old school anime.
4491675	4493376	And it's Miyazaki, right?
4493596	4495897	Yes, it was directed by Miyazaki.
4496117	4497158	Can't go wrong with Miyazaki.
4498960	4505105	And Miyazaki, for people who don't know him by name, is the man behind Studio Ghibli.
4506206	4514092	As in Princess Mononoke, Laputa, Nazca, that's another one too.
4514152	4517115	Oh yeah, and even before that, that was Monkey Punch, right?
4517885	4519586	Yes, Monkey Punch is responsible for Lupin.
4519727	4521928	Yeah, that was before he went to Studio Ghibli?
4522168	4523049	No, no, no.
4523109	4530734	Monkey Punch is the one who did the Lupin comics, who created the character, and also, of course, was responsible for the early animation.
4531435	4535318	Castle Cagliostro was actually directed by Miyazaki.
4535498	4538400	So, yes, you know, more of my useless anime trivia.
4539321	4539901	Hey, it's cool.
4540862	4542243	Well, it's another one of my mutant powers.
4542423	4544385	So we were talking about a few weeks ago on the show.
4544445	4546146	Actually, I think it was one of the shows you weren't here, though.
4546166	4548207	We were talking about DDR and anime.
4548227	4548948	What's the correlation?
4548968	4551269	Actually, no, I think it was your first show back we started talking about this.
4551850	4552550	What is the connection?
4552570	4557193	It seems like a lot of... Besides the obvious, they're both from Japan reference, you know.
4557373	4560416	What is their... Why does there seem to be this connection between anime and DDR?
4560736	4562137	Well, you know...
4563397	4570421	I have often thought that, and you don't necessarily have to be into one to be in the other, but I've noticed that a lot of people are into both.
4571281	4573162	Can you say otaku?
4573902	4574282	Otaku.
4574483	4574763	Thank you.
4576223	4581346	And for the people who actually really don't know what that means, it's someone who actually sits at home and doesn't go anywhere.
4582046	4583046	That is the literal reference.
4583067	4584027	Otaku means home.
4585187	4586148	Yes, otaku means home.
4588343	4599468	For people who misuse the word otaku, it actually is, in slang terms, it means somebody who stays in their house all day and never goes out, just sits with their anime.
4599769	4602330	I know people like that.
4603730	4608033	For those that are in the chat room right now, I have to point out that Kiel posted a very funny picture.
4608073	4613415	It kind of reminded me of the movie Office Space, where he's beating the crap out of his old Macintosh here with a hammer.
4613455	4613955	It's like about...
4616137	4617758	0.2 seconds before impact here.
4617978	4620160	Melody seems to be sad here as the Mac fan.
4620200	4620820	Uh-oh, uh-oh.
4621601	4625404	I'm the only Macintosh user and I must say that shocks and saddens me.
4627125	4627646	There you go.
4630160	4636706	I remember being 11 or 12 and doing tech support for my school on those old apples.
4636726	4637366	Oh, it is a pick.
4637947	4639108	Oh, it's moving.
4639148	4640929	It kind of looked like a hammer at first glance from far away.
4641210	4643952	It looks like the pick is already through the monitor there on the screen.
4643992	4644372	My bad.
4646654	4650758	And now, a moment of silence to mourn the loss of one more Macintosh.
4651659	4655002	Three, three, three, oh, snap.
4656304	4657285	Oh, poor Melody.
4658206	4661648	Oh, I promised Irene she could get a second here to share a thought.
4661708	4664711	So now I'd like to do a segment called Irene's Thought of the Day.
4664791	4665631	So here we go.
4665651	4666212	Deep Thoughts by Irene.
4666252	4667052	Here comes Irene.
4668454	4668994	Here she is.
4671576	4673477	I thought you were going to do this.
4674038	4678822	Oh, I was just going to let everyone know that procrastination is like masturbation.
4679402	4682144	You know, it feels good until you realize that you've fucked yourself.
4682164	4683565	That was deep.
4688297	4689178	That was very deep.
4690258	4692079	Thank you, thank you so much for that.
4692860	4694541	And remember, wash your hands.
4694561	4705147	I know it's a little late, I know it's a little late, Irene, but... You got some ha-ha's from the chatroom, though.
4707128	4708529	She says thank you, chatroom.
4709550	4713352	You know, that was actually, though, a very interesting point.
4713452	4714573	That is actually very true.
4717045	4717545	Well, thank you.
4717625	4718126	Yes, it is.
4718206	4722489	As Rob stares at me and blinks at me.
4722889	4726151	Are we just going to talk about masturbation the rest of the show, then, or what's the deal?
4726171	4726752	Masturbation.
4726832	4727772	Oh, we're losing listeners.
4727792	4728453	Dear God, no.
4728513	4729273	Bomani, Bomani.
4729554	4734117	No, no, don't you notice that sex brings, you know, in listeners, you know, spank, spank, spank, whatever.
4735718	4737299	Irene, want to tell us some more about masturbation?
4737319	4742583	Irene goes, okay, and comes on over.
4747144	4748004	What do you want to know?
4748925	4750807	Tell us about masturbation.
4751847	4757972	Well, I think masturbation, the definition of masturbation is pleasing yourself sexually.
4758613	4760234	I think so.
4760694	4762315	And I think guys do it more.
4763596	4763937	Yeah.
4764857	4765658	Well, I don't know.
4765818	4767079	I don't watch people do it.
4767679	4769421	But I think they do it more.
4770453	4772413	You know, it's kind of like gin rummy.
4772453	4774654	It's like, you don't need a partner if you got a good hand.
4774794	4776054	Yes, exactly.
4776454	4781055	Oh, God, are we going to make a bunch of, like, obscure quotes now or something?
4781535	4782515	Sexual quotes now?
4782835	4786396	Dude, I need good sound bites for the show, so just keep this bit going.
4786436	4789296	I don't got, there's nothing else DDR, 2DX, whatever to talk about.
4791037	4796338	You know, it can be done with things that you find at the grocery store, too.
4797818	4798398	Pork fat.
4800126	4801747	I heard Crisco from somebody once.
4804649	4805290	Chicken burrito.
4805710	4806391	For a girl?
4807051	4808793	No, from one of my ex-boyfriends.
4809853	4812735	No, I mean like the stuff you can use, a girl can use this stuff.
4812776	4815017	I don't think a girl really needs to use anything, do they?
4815438	4815898	Your mama.
4818880	4820281	I know you didn't talk about mama.
4822902	4824724	Okay, and now that we've completely crashed Timber.
4824744	4826405	Yeah, let's get back to Bomani before everyone throws up.
4826525	4828186	Yeah, okay.
4828206	4828907	Here you go, Rob.
4829367	4831809	And of course, Rob has to play Sexy Planet.
4834672	4836153	Gee, wow, that poor Mac died.
4838255	4839376	And how about them coal miners?
4839936	4840536	They're all happy.
4843979	4845841	Let me run to the list here.
4846221	4847842	Oh, yes, let's talk about music.
4848403	4848943	Music that we...
4850496	4851237	I need music.
4851257	4855920	Besides the Bee-Mani series, what is some music that you all like to listen to?
4856941	4861203	No, I got criticized last week for not talking like the announcer, going, Bee-Mani!
4861784	4863625	It's Konami's famous Bee-Mani series!
4863645	4865306	Well, you know, the announcer is wrong, too.
4866187	4867548	You know the announcer is wrong, too.
4868268	4869189	It's Bee-Mani.
4871010	4873772	Also, the announcer in Max 2 doesn't speak Japanese very well, but still.
4873812	4875073	I just got out.
4876897	4878860	Anyway, well, all right, music.
4878921	4881025	So I'll tell you what, let's run it around.
4881065	4882488	What's everybody listening to this week?
4883334	4889838	You know, when I was driving home from San Francisco today, I listened to a new radio station over there, 92.7, which is like just dance music all day.
4890239	4898464	I'm having this, like, I'm liking a lot of new trance music lately, like that Heaven song that they play on the radio all the freaking time, and these other songs.
4898504	4899505	I'm liking that right now.
4900045	4901966	I know it's played out, but I like it.
4902107	4902807	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
4902827	4907790	I was also listening to the 92.7, the dance, coming back from San Francisco today.
4908331	4909552	Good stuff.
4909592	4910412	And I just fell asleep then.
4910432	4911793	Some good shit, huh?
4911893	4912554	Some good shit.
4913854	4914555	How about our guests?
4914575	4915795	What are you kids listening to?
4916055	4918176	And also, I should ask you guys this, because you weren't here for this show.
4918756	4921637	What songs do you think should be in a... Thank you, Dave.
4921917	4924278	What songs do you think should be in a Bomani game that aren't?
4925899	4929420	Well, as for what I'm listening to, it's rather eclectic.
4929480	4933082	Normally, one of the things I've been digging a lot lately is the new Red Hot Chili Pepper CD.
4933722	4935483	That's a really good CD.
4935603	4938764	I think I just turn on By The Way and listen to that track over and over again.
4939927	4952790	I don't even know how many times, but it's really mellow, but it's quite good, and then most of the time I'm driving, I'll let Mel throw in whatever CD he wants, so it's just kind of whatever he chooses.
4956343	4960446	I guess for my musical taste, it's sort of kind of run around.
4960546	4966952	Actually, I guess my first love always will be sort of like the 80s British Invasion, New Wave movement.
4967493	4969975	I was, you know, I was one of those kids born on MTV.
4970055	4975821	My cousin had Betamax and like taped MTV three hours a day, bring it over, and you know, I was like sucked in, so...
4976341	4979422	It's that and my second love would probably have to be the 90s New Jack Swing movement.
4979482	4986343	I mean, everyone loves cross colors and hats worn backwards with their tags still in them and hammer pants and BBD and all that good schmazz.
4987483	4999086	I guess that just really says I really don't really dig much of today's music, which is not to say there isn't good ones, but back then, it's not just the fact that music was good, but I guess it's just all the memories that come along with it.
4999386	5000946	That's one of the big things about music.
5001346	5001546	and so on.
5026063	5032388	I was going back through my playlists and I found Mr. E's Beautiful Blues, which was on Road Trip, by the Eels, though.
5032969	5038533	And I found a lot of songs I liked by them, so I actually got all four of their CDs and listened to a lot of that.
5038954	5040675	And I went to the They Might Be Giants concert.
5040735	5043657	I had their latest CD, No, and I've gotten two more.
5043817	5050322	Now, actually, in the chat room, one of our chatters right now, 3FeetElite, also went to the They Might Be Giants concert, so he actually brought that up as well.
5050343	5050923	Great concert.
5051063	5051884	It was a lot of fun.
5052384	5055225	They rocked out on a lot of songs I didn't expect, and it was really a new experience.
5055245	5058326	This is the second one I've been to, besides Red Hot Chili Peppers, so it was a lot of fun.
5058767	5060427	What was their best song they performed?
5061448	5062508	Your favorite of their performances?
5062528	5064409	You've heard Robot Parade, it's sort of mellowed out.
5064429	5065809	They actually rocked out on that a lot.
5066229	5071872	And there's one called On the Drags, which is a Rarity's album I got from them, which is just sort of normal rock, but they did it really well.
5072152	5072732	It was a lot of fun.
5076967	5080851	I'm listening to a full spectrum of stuff.
5080891	5088720	I've been listening to this George Acosta CD I had, and it's just some trance music and stuff, and I'm also listening to KMFDM.
5089561	5089921	Ah, cool.
5090021	5090341	Attack.
5092844	5095727	Here, go ahead and repeat that from the microphone.
5096087	5105376	Well, you know, back when I was working at Industrial Station, I was working at KSJS for San Jose State, and one of our favorite jokes going around was, KMFDM stood for Kill Motherfucking Depeche Mode.
5108559	5117007	Well, for the people who can't hear what's going on away from the microphone...
5120055	5129650	I'm sure for people who have been reading the What Are You Listening To Now thread on Psych by Money or who have talked to me since I came back from Anime Expo,
5130205	5136067	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5153211	5159894	It's like, my whole big thing with J-Rock lately has been, it's like listening, it's got the same feel that a lot of the good 80s rock had.
5161054	5169118	And they've really gone overboard with the glam if you're into the visual K. So, for all the J-Rock fans out there, there's a lot of us now.
5169138	5177801	Okay, I was being told by the chatroom, I was given this link and said, don't click this link, what did they say, if you've been eating?
5179617	5180297	If you've been eating.
5180357	5180998	Okay, here we go.
5181018	5182639	Let's see what this takes us to.
5188101	5188922	That's horrible.
5190162	5191363	This is a family show.
5193864	5197026	I do not think I'll be eating a cherry muffin anytime soon.
5198430	5199832	That was worse than Goatsy.
5201254	5202035	That was worse.
5203537	5205519	There are a few things that I could consider worse than that.
5205559	5206340	Why?
5206901	5207502	Why?
5207642	5208643	Why did you do that?
5208723	5208863	Why?
5208883	5209804	I think my eyes are bleeding.
5209905	5212308	Okay, let's explain for those listeners out there what we just saw.
5213229	5213950	I'm picturing...
5215972	5233610	I'm picturing a five year old kid crossing a street covered in broken glass and ten UPS fans hit him all at once and they poured popcorn on him or something and some cherry syrup.
5233710	5234331	It was pretty bad.
5237389	5241092	I guess I know when to go... No, no, Dave is asking us to look at this again.
5241332	5243174	I guess I know when to go to the bathroom now.
5243714	5244455	Good timing there.
5245075	5247477	Yay, yay, pictures.
5247938	5249859	Yeah, I don't think we're going to... No.
5250219	5251140	Goat's Day was bad enough.
5251380	5252701	Anyway, moving right along.
5252741	5254323	How about some show news?
5254903	5255143	Show news.
5255163	5256685	Some Orange Lounge show news.
5256825	5259787	Next week on the show, as if... We're starting to get guests here.
5259827	5262469	We're joined by Mel B and Melody this week.
5262509	5263490	Are you guys having a good time?
5263510	5264231	I hope you're having a good time.
5264251	5265191	Oh man, we're just kicking it.
5265251	5265692	It's great.
5266292	5267033	That's all we do here.
5267053	5268234	We just kind of sit around and talk.
5268594	5270255	Just lounging in the Orange Lounge.
5270636	5271316	We're just chilling.
5271736	5271957	Yes.
5272717	5276600	Next week, we're going to have some special guests, but I'm not allowed to tell you who they are.
5277381	5278201	You can go ahead and say who.
5278982	5279342	I can?
5279563	5282485	Well, if they tell me I can, then I will.
5282725	5284406	But we're going to be... I can tell you this much.
5284426	5288109	There's some more Bay Area friends of ours that are going to be coming to visit, and there's two of them.
5288710	5289871	So we'll tell you that much.
5289911	5292473	And if they want to reveal themselves, then we'll tell you all.
5292533	5293974	And we're very happy to have them here.
5294874	5295375	Well, when we do...
5297825	5298765	We'll tell you guys during the break.
5298785	5303646	Yeah, if you were here, part of our live studio audience, you will know.
5306387	5310088	The live experience is truly something that people can live with.
5311448	5313908	This is the only way you're going to get all the inside jokes, really.
5314208	5326151	You know, I think one day we're going to, well, I already have said, you know, I've got the kit to go out to tournaments, and I was actually going to do this at CVGL, but unfortunately some personal life things got in the way, and I wasn't able to cover the tournament.
5326171	5326671	Rob was asleep.
5331082	5339286	I wasn't able to cover the tournament, so later we'll be going out, Jamie and I, when we go out to places, we'll take the live remote with us and interview random people.
5339787	5346010	But hopefully one day, we're going to broadcast this show live from somewhere else, like a tournament or something.
5346310	5347251	We'll be in the bathroom, Ms.
5347271	5347531	Vigil.
5349192	5351793	Broadcast, coming to you live from the bathroom at AI.
5352774	5353694	Dude, who farted?
5356357	5360328	Anyway, you know, just make sure that you don't eat in the snack bar before that.
5360990	5361431	You'll be fine.
5362955	5363175	So...
5365200	5366540	So I think now's a good break time.
5366681	5367221	How's that sound?
5367241	5367901	We'll take one more break.
5367921	5368661	Do I get to break stuff?
5369021	5369582	Then we'll come back.
5369602	5376124	We've got about a half hour show left, so we'll take another quick break, come back, wrap up the show, and put the nail in the coffin of this week's Orange Lounge.
5376864	5380445	And let's see, what did I promise the chatroom, or what did I promise chatroom my play for?
5380465	5381886	You promised long train running for our chatroom.
5382006	5383446	I promised long train running, didn't I?
5383486	5388468	Okay, we're going to start it off with some long train running here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5433755	5434709	All recommendations
5572071	5572832	Thanks for watching!
5606010	5607233	Thanks for watching!
5687569	5689430	Oh, crap, we went into dead air there for a minute.
5689450	5689830	My bad.
5689850	5690511	We're sorry.
5690731	5695513	I'm going... Jeez, tonight's just the night of Rob messing everything up, isn't it?
5695533	5696013	Technical poopy.
5698174	5699215	SOK, Rob, we still love you.
5701216	5702517	I'm just going to guess where we were in the song.
5702537	5703457	Irene said, who's we?
5703477	5707599	Who's we?
5829091	5834113	After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.
5834894	5838836	Undersedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.
5839196	5845519	Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UndersedationLive.org.
5854446	5856307	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
5856427	5858888	Because Bongo demands it.
5884619	5887600	We got one of my roommate's friends, apparently just got back.
5888361	5889421	What do you think of this whole thing?
5889541	5892402	You know what Dance Dance Revolution is, correct?
5892823	5893883	Yes, I've played a couple times.
5894163	5896884	But you have no freaking clue why people get obsessed with it, right?
5898005	5898145	No.
5900526	5907089	So, knowing that you've got tons of Bomani freaks and addicts listening right now, what do you have to say about Bomani?
5907109	5907810	What do you think about it?
5908970	5909831	What the hell is it?
5910891	5914373	All the DDRs, all the Dance Dance Revolution and button-pounding games.
5915494	5916954	You guys are just a bunch of freaks.
5917214	5917695	Thank you!
5917775	5918615	Yes, thank you very much.
5918655	5918875	Alright.
5919256	5919616	Get out of here.
5919656	5919876	Get lost.
5919896	5920576	I don't want to see you.
5920616	5920776	Alright.
5921437	5921817	Anyway.
5923118	5924818	Meanwhile... He just doesn't know.
5924858	5925519	He's not in the know.
5927363	5932677	Okay, I was told over the break that I am allowed to announce our guests that are coming next week.
5932858	5933078	So...
5940547	5944650	Our guests next week will be Jazz and DDR Mike.
5944770	5948072	We'll be here in the house next week in the studio.
5948212	5951154	DDR Mike is, I don't know, he's DDR Mike.
5951174	5952755	He plays in Concord.
5952855	5954276	They're both Concord peoples.
5955737	5958759	We have more Step Squad people, you know, more Step Squad to hang out with me.
5959099	5959319	Yay.
5959379	5959980	Alright, woo!
5960400	5961380	So they'll be here next week.
5961640	5962741	I won't be alone anymore.
5962901	5965723	They'll get to plug whatever they want and talk about whatever.
5965923	5967224	Because we let our guests plug things.
5967724	5969825	Does anybody else want to plug something in the house?
5969845	5970746	That's good, yay.
5971626	5974368	Hair dryer, toaster, personal massage.
5976149	5979511	Anyway... We have a request for a toaster and a personal massage.
5980731	5981251	A vibrator?
5981372	5981632	Alright.
5983273	5983633	Anyway...
5987714	5989817	Back to DDR Talk.
5989978	5994104	Matt wanted to talk about his latest conquest in the DDR world, so let's talk about that.
5995788	6004611	Well, right now what I've been trying to do, because I'm really big into the editing and the edit hacking, two things that are on the list, one probably before the other.
6004831	6008473	The first one is going to be getting 30 second steps in DDR.
6008573	6011394	I'm pretty close to doing it, just have to actually test the file first.
6011974	6017296	And the second one will be making Max 2 exclusive songs, finding the machine ID for that.
6017396	6018817	So that's another thing that's on my list.
6019437	6023258	I was hoping to have the 30 second steps done by today, but I fell behind.
6023378	6024239	So maybe next week.
6025439	6025940	That is all.
6043041	6049746	For anyone who can full combo with a 90% perfect attack on my Look to the Sky edit, it's called Free Fall.
6050227	6052348	You get a nice, lovely little GameCube pin.
6052849	6054930	First person who sends me proof gets it.
6055871	6062576	And then there's the one for my DXY edit, Another, which basically is really evil.
6062616	6066039	And one second place in that lovely Hell edit contest that Matt had.
6066059	6066900	Okay.
6067940	6070202	You will be taken out to dinner.
6070322	6074325	So the one for that is if you full combo it or 90% perfect attack it.
6074745	6080209	Either or, I will take you out to a nice dinner with a decent limit on what you can get.
6080790	6081930	Will it be a candlelight dinner?
6082391	6082851	Oh, baby.
6083512	6084212	You get smoothed.
6088515	6090557	There's going to be wine and cheese and corn.
6091497	6092298	There will be bread also.
6093779	6094680	And cloth napkins.
6095981	6096381	Oh, yeah.
6098633	6099093	Right.
6100214	6106058	Now, you know, I'm referring to, you know, I'm not going to take you out to like a four-star restaurant, you know, but maybe two and a half.
6107559	6111982	You know, I'll take you out to sushi or, you know, maybe Outback if you're lucky.
6112642	6115224	You know, of course, I won't be touching the meat, but, you know.
6117211	6124516	and anyone who can full combo it or get a 90% perfect attack on my another edit will get a nice meal from me.
6124796	6127538	Oh, you guys are going to love it when I find 30 second notes.
6128259	6131841	I've been planning, actually, the edit I made today that I was going to test, but it got cut off.
6132021	6136745	It has at the very end all eight arrows come down at the same time, or relatively close to the same time.
6137045	6137985	It's funny just to watch.
6138126	6141228	That's when you have a seizure on the pad.
6141748	6144470	Of course, you know the involuntary bow movements are prohibited.
6146173	6157797	So, and also, I am going to be, now that I have Max at home, I am going to be working on my other, my next tell edit, probably to Waka Waka.
6158878	6164640	Because, you know, I want to do just this insanely evil... Wait, how can you do a Waka Waka edit with Max 1?
6164860	6166201	Oh, it wasn't in there.
6166221	6166921	You mean Blonde Girl?
6167621	6169463	Okay, well, forget it.
6169503	6172745	I want to pick a super cute, happy song and then do something evil to it.
6173105	6181512	So, hey, if anybody wants me to make a hell edit and name it after them, pick me a song and I will make you an edit to it.
6181552	6184755	This is what happened when Jamie realized that Waka Waka was not in DDR Max 1.
6184915	6188137	Oh my goodness, I can't believe it.
6188337	6189778	Everything's ruined.
6190259	6191720	You want me to kick you?
6192788	6194689	Somebody give me some... Where's the Clifford Ball?
6195750	6197791	The Clifford Ball's in the other studio.
6198131	6199291	We're in the big studio night.
6199331	6200552	The Clifford Ball's in the little studio.
6200772	6204814	You know, I bought this Clifford Ball two weeks ago to throw it at Rob, and I haven't done it yet.
6205154	6208436	It, like, lives here now, so... Mwahaha.
6208916	6214639	So... But, you know... I can just play random sound effects the rest of the show.
6214939	6216280	Are you gay?
6217681	6222243	But, you know, everybody who at least, you know, posts on the Sackman Money forums know that Rob is our Big Gay Chili.
6225911	6229292	When you were born, I think you looked like a chili.
6231733	6233354	Anyway, enough with the sound effects.
6233374	6234114	Yes, enough with the sound effects.
6235335	6236515	I'm not allowed to have fun here.
6237776	6240617	We are a serious talk show.
6241397	6243298	Let's talk about the future.
6244478	6246299	What other tournaments are you going to be attending in the future?
6248664	6251047	For me, I don't know exactly what big ones are coming up.
6251087	6253791	I guess there's the one at Mountain Mike's that's coming up next month.
6254111	6255513	I'll probably mosey into that.
6255533	6256915	I don't know if I'll compete or not.
6256995	6259378	It's kind of hard to say right now.
6259518	6264724	I was going to go to the Midwest Showdown, which is next month, but things sort of came through.
6264785	6267228	In other words, meaning I'm a broke-ass.
6267708	6272613	So, I was going to have a huge routine for that, but I guess I'll use it for whenever's clever.
6273794	6277338	The only one that I know that's... Actually, Triple Threat is the one I'll be going to next.
6277678	6281802	Because that's on August 1st and 2nd over at Sunnyvale Golf Land.
6281862	6282423	Check that out.
6282483	6285786	I believe, yeah, DDR Spot's going to be blowing up the spot with that one.
6285886	6286767	Okay, I have to ask, though.
6286807	6288349	Thursday and Friday, what's up with that?
6290110	6291311	Well, let's see...
6292336	6301880	Well, the main thing about trying to schedule a tournament on Saturday and Sunday, what a lot of people forget is Golfland is all about the birthday parties and all those kind of things, and that's first priority.
6302241	6304282	Thursday and Friday night, I mean, it's summertime.
6304902	6309064	Most people that get off work around 5 or so, and it just kind of works.
6309124	6310544	It's the best thing we can do for now.
6311025	6312185	Are they going to be doing it at night?
6313386	6315907	As far as I know, yeah, like late afternoon into the night.
6317024	6322929	I kind of want to go, but unfortunately I've got to work, and when you add a drive on top of that, it's not going to be very much fun for me to get out there.
6323229	6324410	But I wish you guys the best of luck.
6324430	6325571	It does sound like an awesome tournament.
6325731	6328193	Very innovative new stuff that you guys are going to be doing there.
6328213	6328534	Thank you.
6328554	6329494	I hope it does go well.
6329534	6333438	But that's part of the thing about the tournament stats, especially Mike No Runs.
6333698	6338061	It's gone to a point where we've kind of seen, okay, everyone's skill and all that, but there's only so much...
6339548	6339728	P.A.
6339768	6339968	Tournament
6361741	6362461	Oh, absolutely.
6362501	6368083	That's freestyle to me, to make an analogy, it's like the NBA slam dunk contest.
6368123	6372545	So, it's not something that has to go hand in hand, you know, you've got to have your PA and your freestyle.
6372845	6373745	It's cool to have them.
6374225	6377687	Because even at the PA only tournaments, it seems like there's always a little freestyle on the side.
6378567	6381268	Oh, yeah, well, freestyle... It's like you get a free cup of freestyle.
6381868	6382648	Yeah, exactly.
6382768	6389531	It's just a hint of, you know, just like in some freestyle tournaments, some people who PA think their PA-ing looks good, and no, it doesn't.
6391294	6393355	What are some things in freestyle that piss you off?
6395075	6396315	Or make you upset?
6398256	6399837	Melody's hitting the... You have something you want to say.
6401317	6403498	That would be the hand slaps and the knee drops.
6405158	6405638	I don't know.
6406078	6410620	It's gotten to the point where... Actually, I've gone through quite a few tourneys where I haven't seen that many hand slaps or knee drops.
6410800	6411760	I kind of miss them.
6412460	6414541	Does that mean we'll see them in your next routine?
6416021	6416281	I don't know.
6416321	6417922	If I get there to do it, I will do it.
6419483	6420544	Maybe I'll have to dare.
6421025	6423487	Okay, I dare you on this show right here.
6423907	6424948	Next, next routine.
6425209	6426290	Hand slaps and knee drops.
6427991	6428872	Not only, not only.
6429533	6430934	As your finish, as your finish.
6431094	6432576	Alright, just so we got a few witnesses in here.
6432596	6433717	In the last ten seconds, alright.
6433797	6434498	Hand shake deal.
6434778	6436680	There will be hand slaps and knee drops in my next routine.
6436720	6438922	Now this is a great deal because I don't have to do a damn thing.
6441404	6442866	I just get to point at them and make fun of them.
6443146	6453873	Yeah, seriously, I guess, though, things that, I guess, make me mad about freestyle, it's not so much... There's really nothing that makes me mad, just the only thing I get in order is people who really don't put in effort to, like, entertain the crowd.
6453933	6461838	It's... The only good thing about that is that they've made the pot fatter for the winner, but past that, it's a waste of time, really, for judges and for other people.
6462178	6466560	I mean, I guess if they get a cheap throw out of it and they paid their money, I suppose it's all good, but past that...
6467967	6475178	What would you rather see, you know, something that's really good improv or something that's been taken time to choreograph?
6475919	6480727	Well, I think choreography definitely because not only does it show skill, but it also shows that, you know,
6484170	6489293	Like, instead of coming up with something on the spot, it comes up with a thought, and of course you go through all the goods and bads, and it's like a polished product.
6489654	6502402	Improv, some people can make it look good, you know, it's not easy, but at the same time, in improv, you pretty much have your bread and butter, you have one style and you stick with it, whereas in a choreograph, you can kind of integrate all sorts of little things into one big extravaganza.
6503641	6507964	Now, in the chatroom, they said, okay, dare him to do slaps and knee drops on Dynamite Rave.
6508324	6510385	And I said, okay, no, we gotta draw the line somewhere.
6510405	6511126	That's a little much.
6511406	6514808	I mean, at least doing the hand drops and knee slaps, whatever.
6516149	6520291	I know, at least let me do it to, like, uh, well, what's that, D2R, I guess?
6520311	6521952	You know, at least make it, you know, get what you want.
6521972	6522232	D2R!
6523533	6527936	And surprisingly, after looking at those steps, they actually look very freestyle-able.
6527976	6531598	Not that I'd do it, but after this bit, I guess, damned now, you know?
6532324	6536589	Well, actually, you know, speaking of songs, what do you think is the best freestyle song in Max 2?
6538370	6539752	As far as the new stuff.
6541093	6541894	Secret Rendezvous.
6543556	6544357	I would definitely put that up.
6544377	6549422	Because it's slow enough that you can put an extra beat in between all the notes, and so you can do more stuff.
6550993	6551434	What would you think?
6552014	6567890	Well I think Secret Rendezvous actually on double bass kick is like double light is probably the best thing because especially for some people who play pump it up a lot there's a lot of it has sort of a five arrow thing where it's like the two middle and then you have like the ups and downs so there are some people who if they rock at pump it up they could like totally tear that up.
6568651	6571774	I guess a new song actually Spin the Disc is still my favorite.
6573076	6575558	I may not be laughing on the outside, but inside I know I'm just doing cartwheels over that one.
6596147	6600492	I'm being suggested by the chatroom that A Minute is also a good freestyle song.
6603235	6607539	They're saying that Secret Rendezvous is a song about lesbians.
6608240	6609962	Didn't we talk about that on the show a few weeks ago?
6611659	6612880	It is a lesbian song.
6612900	6615081	Uh-oh, we have the Brad rant.
6615181	6617203	Here comes Brad with his secret rendezvous rant.
6617843	6624167	Okay, I'm sure we'd all like to think it's about lesbians, but it does say in the song, he is mine or something like that.
6624988	6628870	Unless it's a dyke, a bull dyke, then okay, I guess that'll pass.
6628910	6629611	Transsexual.
6630511	6636236	See, Secret Rendezvous, it doesn't take away the coolness of freestyle by having it about lesbians.
6636716	6637837	It makes it even cooler.
6638598	6641781	And So Fabulous, So Fierce is also another good song for freestyle.
6645575	6652557	I think that just really goes to show how really important it is to have great commercial songs in a DDR, any kind of, like, the Monty game.
6652637	6657259	It's those songs that you're kind of familiar with, like, A Minute or, you know, so fast.
6657339	6662641	It's like songs from the 70s, a lot of us who, you know, grew up in that era or, like, you know, were kids and reminisce on that song.
6663081	6666702	That's why I think, you know, commercial songs, especially, you know, if America got with it, you know,
6667262	6678254	Although we've heard from the DDR Max from E3 for America, there's going to be commercial songs on there as well, instead of Konami, which was a great mix by the way, but all Konami originals.
6678574	6681858	This one's going to be new, it's going to have some new stuff that's never been anywhere else.
6682539	6684681	I think KOA might be catching up.
6687299	6689560	You think it's going to go the way of Euromex though?
6689580	6694142	Because I noticed there was a new little deal there where they signed, they had some Zomba record stuff.
6694182	6697504	So does that mean we're going to get Britney in USDDR?
6698624	6699845	Because Britney was on Zomba.
6700125	6701806	They already have the Britney's Dance Mix.
6701866	6703407	I don't think that they need to integrate it.
6703627	6707050	And I just want to say for a record, Britney's Downspeed is a hard freaking game.
6707630	6709872	No, that is a ridiculously easy game.
6710092	6715577	It's like, the hardest song probably has the equivalent difficulty of maybe a three-footer.
6715737	6717518	I want to know why you two have been playing this game.
6717558	6719980	Dude, shoot yourselves now, go to hell, oh my god.
6720000	6721982	Freedom Pass from Blockbuster!
6722322	6725184	And then I had to get it because, you know, it's ridiculously stupid.
6725204	6728087	That's right, Brad, Britney's easy to find for all you haters out there, Brad.
6728507	6729368	How can you live with yourself?
6729388	6735351	I mean, you have to go up to the cash register and say, I want to rent Britney's Dance, whatever the fuck that was.
6737472	6744996	Actually, I played it at E3 when they were demoing it, and the funny thing was, it's like, they had to challenge you in a dance pad if you get the highest score.
6745016	6750659	Not only did I get the highest score, I beat the freaking guys who were demoing the game, so I thought that was just comedy in itself.
6752088	6757152	The only thing that would make me even want to get that game is my absolute love for the first two Bust a Move games.
6757612	6764678	In fact, well, I haven't necessarily played Dance Summit, but, you know, it is not Bust a Groove, it is Bust a Move, goddammit.
6764738	6766259	Okay, there's Spikey of the Week number three.
6767119	6775546	Yeah, I know, but this was from something last night, I was wearing my Bust a Groove, sorry, Bust a Move shirt, and somebody in Jamla Juice said, is that from Bust a Groove?
6775626	6779689	Oh, I love that game, and I was like, yeah, and I called her a dork and she got all upset.
6781379	6791648	No, um, oh, the only reason that I would buy the, uh, Britney's dance beat is so I could watch Britney Spears in skimpy outfits without having to watch it on MTV.
6791668	6793429	It's animated, Dave.
6793769	6796812	Dude, it's animated video.
6796932	6798293	Just download porn, Dave.
6798373	6799594	Get on the net and download porn.
6799674	6800235	Hey, I do.
6800495	6801136	Alright, thank you.
6802675	6807739	Maybe we should get someone to hook you up with a copy of Final Fuck X or something.
6807839	6811222	Well, you know, she was... Your HP tastes so good.
6811482	6815225	HP got lazy.
6815926	6823231	Well, you know, she was flipping off a lot of her fans in Mexico and stuff, and if she just keeps doing that and she loses popularity, maybe she'll turn to porn.
6823672	6824152	There you go.
6825193	6828796	First of all, if she fell off the face of the planet and went the way of Mariah Carey, I'd be happy.
6831704	6833506	I know, but the fact is, no one cares
6844141	6845001	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6865804	6878176	One of the ones I got actually recently for my sim was the Metal Gear Solid theme, and I'm also very pleased to see that someone made double steps for it, so I can't wait to play that one when I get my pads working again.
6879177	6886003	But yeah, definitely want to see some more stuff ported from Beatmania over, so I'm pretty excited to see what they're going to have.
6887074	6901220	Yeah, well, I know one of them for sure is Overblast, because actually when I saw the trailer for Max for USA, that was the theme music they were using, and Jason Eno, who we all know is the product manager of EDR, had told me about that.
6902021	6904022	I also want to see Hellscraper.
6905442	6906543	Hellscape, whatever!
6907023	6912305	Why don't you use that, just play Mr. Bassman on Disney Mix, man, it's fast enough and doggone it.
6912565	6913646	That song sucks!
6914767	6916888	Hey, let's not call people names here, dickhead.
6918548	6922710	No, the Hellscaper... Ducking Hardcore Mix.
6922730	6924590	Dude, I don't really like Hellscaper that much.
6925150	6929532	Oh, Dave, did you play the simulator he had for the steps for it?
6929712	6930372	Yes, I did.
6930572	6931352	It was good, man.
6932113	6934553	I'd rather play V for the simulator something.
6935434	6937374	Tank, that song rocked.
6938155	6939055	I haven't played that one.
6940915	6942616	I'm still voting for Total Recall.
6943911	6948795	I'd like to throw in my vote for Baby Bay Give Me Your Love 2001, the remix that they have on Beatmania 7th Mix.
6948815	6952657	That is the most awesomest freaking thing ever.
6952757	6957241	And for the people who, you know, you might get a taste of Total Recall in a minute.
6958842	6972792	But, you know, I think that there are so many good songs, though, that, you know, you had to imagine, you know, the staff, the people who choose the songs of Konami of Japan just sitting there going, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what do we pick, what do we pick, what do we pick, what do we pick?
6973376	6974639	Because there's just so much good stuff.
6975621	6978367	It's really hard to narrow it down, I think.
6980063	6985086	I personally would like to see them, though, just instead of going back into their archive, just kind of make some new stuff up.
6985306	6988148	Just let LED go to town and I'll be happy.
6988228	6989349	That's fine with me.
6989369	6990749	TAC, let them go to town.
6991170	6994051	Then, you know, go visit some of those.
6994111	6997553	Just like how in Japan they have the Dance Mania series.
6997573	6999635	They're hooked up with Toshiba EMI and all that.
6999855	7002877	Why don't you let them go to town with some people that put out the compilations here?
7002937	7006178	Like maybe the Ultimate Dance Party or the Trans Party compilations here.
7006259	7006999	That would be pretty cool.
7007059	7016592	I think if DDR just went off the Dance Mania Diamond Millennium hit by whoever's left all in one mix that one double CD all in one mix I think that would be the most greatest thing in the world
7018618	7025063	or, you know, like they did with Parapara, hook up with Avex and throw some of the Avex stuff into DDR.
7026303	7033048	The music that I've put out, you know, sponsored by Avex Tracks, was just some absolutely awesome stuff.
7033108	7044035	Now, I know this was in Disney Mix, but I'd still, I know, just for comic value, I'd like to see Night of Fire in another DDR mix with that guy Bucky in the background as the...
7044475	7045095	That's the video.
7046436	7047376	Well, you weren't here for it.
7047416	7048837	That was my VCD that I had.
7050257	7052739	Oh, that's why I was off shuffling through AX.
7054639	7054959	Oh, yeah.
7055080	7062523	They should show the one, the turn and beat around video they did where he does this little thing with his hands and blows this one chick's skirt up.
7062683	7063183	It was great.
7063503	7066064	Is that the guy whose theme music was Night of Fire every time he showed up?
7066084	7066724	Yes, that guy rocks.
7066784	7068025	Rob told me about this one.
7068065	7070386	That sounds like... He's my idol.
7072148	7081618	You gotta have goals Hello, I'm a panda Alright, we're getting ready to wrap up the show So I leave Melody, Mel B, you guys have any final comments you'd like to leave us with?
7094316	7096538	I just wanted to thank you guys for having me on board.
7096578	7098520	I thought this place is just pretty dope.
7098580	7102202	I'd like to come in on a more regular basis, actually.
7102423	7106586	And for everyone else out there, keep freestyling, PA'ing, whatever the hell you do.
7106706	7109468	Just don't give me that funk or anything else.
7109488	7113932	I don't want to catch the VD or herpes or all that other stuff.
7114552	7125100	and check out ddrspot.com, come to Triple Thread and if nothing else, just be true to yourself and well, gosh, I'm terrible at these inspirational speeches.
7126502	7127503	Be excellent to each other.
7128103	7128723	Party on.
7130244	7134047	We're always glad to have you guys on whenever you feel like coming back.
7134707	7135428	Yeah, definitely.
7135448	7136328	Come back anytime, you guys.
7136348	7136909	You're always welcome.
7137609	7139810	Even next week, if you guys happen to come to the party Saturday.
7139870	7140971	Oh, I didn't say that over the air, did I?
7141231	7142692	No.
7143433	7145094	My roommate's back there going, Oh, God!
7145114	7146555	Oh, yeah, yes.
7147775	7155320	I'd like to announce that we'll be hopefully making a trip down to Pleasanton Cusar on the 10th next week to do Sack Attack 3.
7155520	7157762	We will have Team Sack back.
7159283	7161264	Take that back.
7162125	7163566	Anyways, so we'll be down there.
7163666	7170110	I heard that they just got a brand new fifth mix machine, so I'll be willing to break that in and kick anyone's ass in Cusar.
7171016	7173959	I will take the Orange Lounge remote to that location.
7173999	7178463	So if you guys want to meet us there and talk to us and make a cameo on the show, that would be great.
7178663	7181665	Maybe we should make a mention of our exploits from the first Team Sack.
7181786	7184328	It should be from probably about 7pm to midnight.
7184348	7186690	We'll probably do like a half day pass in there on that Saturday.
7186790	7188532	So just come on down and say hi.
7188692	7190053	You'll definitely recognize us.
7191061	7191402	Oh, yes.
7192123	7193564	We'll be the ones beating everybody.
7193925	7200193	Next week on the show, we have, don't forget, we've got Jazz and DDR Mike are going to be joining us, and they're some of the regulars over in Concord.
7200734	7205681	So they'll be joining us next week to talk about Lord knows what, but they'll be able to plug whatever they want.
7206862	7207403	I guess that's it.
7207764	7208685	Any last thoughts, Jamie?
7209930	7210871	I want another donut.
7211211	7212232	Alright, goodnight everybody.
7212433	7213314	Thanks for being here.
7214415	7219962	We're going to have to do our fortune cookie message on the fly tonight, so we might get one more fuck up before the show's over, but we're going to try it.
7220002	7220783	I don't fuck up.
