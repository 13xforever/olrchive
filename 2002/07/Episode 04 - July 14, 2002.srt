You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All your days are belong to us.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
God damn you, stop calling here! Isn't this 4, 2, 1, 5 pussy wave? You bitch!

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,500
Let me check the zip code. You want to fuck you?

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
You have no morals.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of herpes.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Kiss my grass, mooch.

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Mecha licka hi, mecha hiney ho.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,500
Me too!

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Fucker yet?

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm working on it.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Loser.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,000
Lame!

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
On the side of my face.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Breathing.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Grassless.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Heaving grass.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Heaving.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Whatever.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut while I go listen to my written experience records.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The next director's up. I am your singing telegram.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Somewhere inside the state of California in the great nation of the United States of America on the planet Earth,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're tuned in to the Bimani scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bimani.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Joining me, as always, is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Welcome back!

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, I'm back, and I'm sad.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I am 100% glad to be back. The trip was interesting, to say the least.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And we'll definitely get into that a little bit more later, right, Jamie?

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, yes!

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Alright.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So, this is episode number four for July the 14th of 2002.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We are joined in studio once again by many, many, many guests.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We've got Matt, Dave, hello, Dave's here, and Paul's here in the house.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And we'll be talking to all of them a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a real quick break.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Any other opening thoughts from you, Miss?

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Did you say I get to break stuff?

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sure, if you want. Just not anything I own.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You can break my roommate's stuff, though. He's on vacation.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, cool. I think I'll just break this thing over here.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All right, sounds good.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm going to start off this first break with a request here.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,800
a couple requests in our chat room. Why don't you go ahead and join our chat room if you

48
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:49,800
want to. You just have to join IRC.Akeheads.org or any other side IRC chat server. One of

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,200
them would be also karma.othersideirc.net and then we're just in Channel Pound Orange

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,880
Lounge. It's just that easy. I've got a few requests in here. We're going to start it

51
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,880
off with from Chutiex7style, this is Dumond with Never Look Back.

52
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,380
I'm just here to stay

53
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,880
I'm here to stay

54
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Masi o alu de yudanga nebo se mana koten

55
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Asuri nan kashii ni naga za

Mada hiru managori

60
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:54,880
Blow my whistle, baby Open up and put it in

61
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
Lick it

62
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Throw it like you made it blow

63
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:36,160
Let me hear you say, Louder Let me hear you say, Louder

64
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Is that what you call loud?

65
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Come on, let me hear you say

66
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,160
Let me hear you say

67
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Louder

68
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
I said louder

69
00:07:51,160 --> 00:08:10,160
You need to bring the beat back Blow my whistle, baby

70
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,880
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

71
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Do it all night. Do it with me.

72
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,880
No, no. That was awful. Bloody terrible. Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher.

73
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,880
In the heat of the night.

74
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Oh, God. I think my ears are bleeding.

75
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,880
I liked it.

76
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next.

77
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Oh, that was cool.

78
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic. Next.

79
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
That was just bloody pathetic. Next!

80
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Come on baby, come on, do it with me.

81
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Yes, yes, that's it! We have a winner!

82
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,880
A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

83
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,880
That's right, A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

84
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Hey, they were saying that the old promos were getting a little old, so we had to make that new one before the show started tonight.

85
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Now we have new old promos.

86
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,880
That's right, now we have new old promos to play the hell out with here.

87
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,900
Alrighty, a big hello to everybody by the way tonight in our chat room, we've got a

88
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,920
pretty crowded chat room there tonight, so thanks everybody for listening in, and those

89
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,920
last few songs were for some people that were listening in the chat room, we had Don't Look

90
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,980
Back and The Whistle Song were both requested, and I threw Jet Ninja in there too because

91
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,640
I know a lot of people like that one.

92
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Thank you Paul for that lovely hooray.

93
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,400
Yes we have a hooray from the background.

94
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:37,460
Speaking of The Whistle Song, very interesting, I personally think it's the most interesting

95
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,960
song in Max 2 out of anything. And it was the one that probably got the biggest reaction

96
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,720
in the chat room. People going, oh yeah, I really want to hear this song, I don't know

97
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,840
why, it just really kind of gets in your mind and just messes with you to like, I hate this

98
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,200
song, this is the scrubbiest song on the face of the earth, when people play this in the

99
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,680
arcade, they sing along to it, and I want to kill myself. What is it about the whistle

100
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,180
saw? It was weird because when it first came out, you know, when Max 2 News was first coming

101
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,200
out, people said, oh, that song is going to be the most overplayed Max 2 song because

102
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,920
it has the word bitch in it. Then we find out they censored bitch and it just says baby.

103
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,160
I mean, unless you're looking at the banner, but whatever. It says baby in the actual song.

104
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,040
And people are afraid to play it because they don't want to play it out, right? I guess?

105
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:26,640
I don't know. They all play Sugaru. They all play Sugaru, which is not even as good as

106
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,040
the song. So instead they play Sugaru, play that out. But then it's like all of a sudden

107
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,760
somebody actually plays the whistle song and now it's like, oh, people are playing this

108
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,580
and it's pretty cool, and now the Whistle song is a cool song, but now it's getting

109
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,540
overplayed again. It's frustratingly catchy, that's the thing.

110
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,780
It's just infectious, it gets in my mind, and it never gets out.

111
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:56,820
It feels like burning! My brain! Any other interesting songs that you just

112
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:02,960
kind of totally changed your opinion on? Old school song, but love that feeling.

113
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,880
I hated that song, everybody hated that song, and then it kept coming up on my non-stops

114
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,120
on my lovely Dreamcast edition, so I learned to like it.

115
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,960
And then I was the only one who did.

116
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,700
Later on tonight we're going to be doing our very own version of Listless here, and we

117
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,560
are going to be determining the worst Bahmani song in history next to Let Them Move, because

118
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,680
Let Them Move, it's already given that wins, it's the worst Bahmani song in history.

119
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,840
We're going to determine the number two, second worst Bahmani song in history tonight.

120
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,840
It was officially the lowest on that list on that old survey that went on DDRFreak.

121
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Do you remember that?

122
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Was it?

123
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
I thought that it was Have You Never Been Mellow?

124
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
No.

125
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
No.

126
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Have You Never Been Mellow was ranked a good bit higher than Let Them Move.

127
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Love Machine wasn't even number one, so that lived.

128
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Yeah.

129
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,160
See, Have You Never Been Mellow is cool because it was made just to spin around the whole

130
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
time on the maniac steps.

131
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,840
You can spin the entire thing and it's pretty fun.

132
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
You can do that on the trick steps too.

133
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,880
And then you go try to step off the stage and you fall on your ass. It's funny

134
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,120
I thought that was a butterfly where you just go spin spin spin spin spin spin aye yi yi yi yi

135
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:17,240
Butterfly has a few chops in it and get a little scary and it's been done. You know. I don't think anyone can top

136
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
What's been classic?

137
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,860
Do you think there will ever be a great butterfly routine from here on out?

138
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,860
Do you think anybody has the balls to do Butterfly anymore?

139
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,860
Let's just ask Kyle Snyder.

140
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,860
I put out a challenge. I put out a challenge.

141
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,860
I want to see a fucking great either Butterfly or Boom Boom Dollar.

142
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,860
Like somebody needs to just get old school and blow us all away.

143
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,860
There's already been some really good Boom Boom Dollar routines I guess.

144
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,860
I saw one video, I don't remember, I believe it was off Music Gaming Zone.

145
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,860
These two Korean guys doing Booboom Dollar and it was pretty awesome.

146
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,100
I mean, I've seen a lot of crappy routines from Booboom Dollar, but that was probably

147
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,620
the only one that actually stood out my mind as being good.

148
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:09,880
Chat room does seem to agree here, Snyder owned Butterfly and that's it, the end.

149
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,780
So that's two songs he owns, because isn't he the king of Trip Machine Jungle or something

150
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
like that too?

151
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,440
He is a butterfly no kamisama.

152
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,720
And oh, Cory, ok Cory, we have Virtu in the chat room and he says at CVGL next Saturday

153
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,360
he will do it.

154
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,200
I will totally be there to do that.

155
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,720
I hope it's as good as the burning heat routine Cory, that's all I have to say.

156
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,800
I don't know if I'm going to make it to CVGL unfortunately, I might be there, but we're

157
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,960
hoping, and this is something we want to do in the future, we're going to be taking our

158
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,600
little kit out remote, we've got some remote tape stuff, and we're going to do some interviews

159
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,420
out and about at some different tournaments and things, and we'll be bringing them back

160
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,020
to the show and playing them all for you.

161
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,620
So hopefully Jamie can get out there.

162
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,660
Let's see who wants to give Jamie a lift.

163
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,880
I'm taking donations now.

164
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,740
If I go, I will definitely take you, but I do have Understation Live on Saturday night,

165
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,660
which I committed to, so I'd have to run back early just so I can make that show.

166
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:09,000
So anyhow, why don't we get into Jamie's F.U. of the Week, because a lot of what we want

167
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,960
to talk about today revolves around Jamie's F.U. of the Week.

168
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,920
So I am going to turn it over to Jamie and she's going to give us, like she does every

169
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,800
week, we've had to fill in for her the past few weeks because she's been gone, but she

170
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,520
has an F.U. of the week every week and so Jamie, tell us your F.U. of the week.

171
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,160
My F.U. of the week has to do with Anime Expo.

172
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,640
First of all, I was going expecting to see some new anime, something that I hadn't seen

173
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
before.

174
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,020
They played the same crap that you can buy at Suncoast.

175
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:46,180
This is stuff that I've either already had for months or a couple stuff for years, and

176
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,200
it was all just this commercial crap.

177
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,660
And then I go in the dealer's room, okay, last year I was so excited, I was like, I'm

178
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,480
in a jungle, buy a bench laserdisc, $5 game.

179
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,000
They had like five laserdiscs that were $5, all the rest were $30, $40, which is still

180
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,340
good for laserdiscs, but still, you know, I want my $5 laserdiscs.

181
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,300
I walked out of AX last year with 20 laserdiscs.

182
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,740
This year, not a one, although I did see this really cool little Initial D racing car thingy

183
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,260
that's like the size of my thumb.

184
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,820
I will say that is very cool.

185
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Oh, it's adorable.

186
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,780
That almost makes the whole trip worth it right there.

187
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,900
I've decided that I'm officially going to get a 1983 Toyota Corolla hatchback and paint

188
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,700
it up like the Initial D car.

189
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,960
They had one there and it was adorable and I just picture of you.

190
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,700
And another thing, this is my other ramp, okay, the cosplay was great.

191
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,200
There were lots of people in really awesome costumes, and I found a massive angel pictuary group.

192
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,700
But I was in my Mad Hatter costume, which if anybody wants to see, it looks like I'll find you pictures later.

193
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,200
But people kept asking me if I was doing J-Rock cosplay.

194
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,700
I'm like, no, I'm not from Alice Meyser! No, go away, leave me alone.

195
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,200
But I got glomps a lot, so that was cool.

196
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Do explain to all of us what a glomp is, for those that don't know.

197
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
It's when people randomly run up to you and latch onto you.

198
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Right on.

199
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,560
When you get hugged by screaming fanboys and fangirls.

200
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,880
Don't you get glumped when you play DDR, Dave?

201
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,160
Yes, I get glumped by beautiful women wearing bikinis.

202
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,160
And then you wake up!

203
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,080
Ladies love the knee drops.

204
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,800
It breaks out as no old school A-team.

205
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,680
Dave, for those that don't know, is the guy that likes to play Demon Road over at Roseville

206
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,940
Golf Land, and he likes to do the knee drops on Paranoia while he's trying to do an oni.

207
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,940
That is winter.

208
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:40,060
What's even better is for the people who can do that and actually make it through the course.

209
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,420
You think that's going to be a new trend, is freestyling the only courses?

210
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,060
It's like, what's left to do?

211
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,300
Yeah, I freestyle waka-laka.

212
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,820
It's hard, but you can throw in a few stuff there.

213
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,940
Not much, but Paranoia definitely adds more stuff.

214
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,940
You can spin and hand plant, knee drop, all that stuff.

215
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,940
Rad.

216
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,940
Hey Dave, Virtu's challenging you in the chat room to a freestyle oni.

217
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
Ooooh.

218
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,940
Ooooh.

219
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,940
Well, I think...

220
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
You better back that up.

221
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,100
You better bring it.

222
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:16,740
I know that I definitely could not even do Demon Road at all without freestyling, but

223
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,500
with freestyling I'd make it to, at most, the fifth song, if I really did well.

224
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,780
You know, actually I'd like to issue out a challenge of my own too.

225
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,020
Oh, well it's challenge night here on Orange Lodge.

226
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:34,900
A few people already know of this challenge, but actually my edit is on SoCalCakes page

227
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,940
right now, my DXY edit another.

228
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,300
For whoever full combos it or gets a 90% perfect attack, I will take them out to dinner.

229
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,300
What kind of dinner?

230
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,140
What will be on the course for this lovely dinner?

231
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:53,580
Sushi, of course, or something maybe out back.

232
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,580
I got an idea.

233
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,580
How about we go to Hometown Buffet?

234
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,580
Hometown Buffet!

235
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:04,420
the true Sacramento cow town way we're gonna go home we will go to JJ North

236
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:09,700
there a little better you know I live right of cake we live the studio here is

237
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,380
right up the street from a nice little oriental buffet I see Cory's comment

238
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,260
there I will make sure that you get a copy of this one way or another also uh

239
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,020
it is available I've figured out finally how to update our website all nicely so

240
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,460
We did update the links page today, and the very last link there leads to one of the listeners

241
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
of the show, SoCalKicks.

242
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,580
He has a nice little page there, and it has edits on it, and Jamie's edits are downloadable

243
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,580
there.

244
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,380
He said it might be broken, but I know he'll fix it, especially after I just plugged his

245
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,380
site here.

246
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,380
He'll figure out a way to fix it now.

247
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,820
I can also mirror those edits on sacbemani.com and on darksacra.com.

248
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,260
I also have another challenge attached to my Look to the Sky edit for whoever full combos

249
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
it.

250
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,180
I'll give you a GameCube pin.

251
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,460
Speaking of edits, actually, I should start posting mine on my website there.

252
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,540
Maybe I'll post that link next week or something like that.

253
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,300
All right, cool.

254
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,780
Sounds cool.

255
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,900
So going back to Anime Expo, there's a question I want to ask.

256
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,820
And I think a lot of people want to know the answer to this.

257
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:19,460
Why is it that there seems to be this correlation between anime and DDR,

258
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,980
Besides the obvious that they're both from Japan, I mean that's the obvious, why is it

259
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:29,260
that a lot of people, not everybody, but I'd say a good 90% of people who love DDR love

260
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
anime?

261
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,320
You know, I've actually found out that a lot of the people that I used to know online through

262
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:40,940
my anime channels are people that are now like kind of big in the DDR world too.

263
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,480
a few people actually in Step Squad.

264
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,300
I knew them online before I knew them by DDR.

265
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,080
And by the way, hi Step Squad, whoo, okay, anyway.

266
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,260
But I also, you know, I think it was really cool that actually this is one of the coolest

267
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:04,000
things about AX is that AI supplied a bunch of machines for an arcade there.

268
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,500
They had a Max that was actually in a 1.5 cabinet.

269
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Oh, right on.

270
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:15,700
They had Guitar Freak 5th, Drummania 4th, which I absolutely butchered my hands on.

271
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:22,140
That had Beatmania 3rd there, the 3rd core, the Mania 3 core.

272
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,200
Maybe I'm wrong here, because the chat room is telling me I've got Soka Gex saying he

273
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,660
doesn't watch anime, Joe Mama says he watches maybe 3 animes, and Virtu says they are the

274
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,760
same because it's Jappo.

275
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,860
Like I said, besides the obvious, they're both from Japan.

276
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
Any comments from you guys?

277
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,860
What do you think about the correlation between DDR and anime? Why is it?

278
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:47,860
The last time I watched anything that could be from Japan in cartoons was when I was in sixth grade and watched Pokemon.

279
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,860
Like maybe three times.

280
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,860
Pokemon, oh!

281
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,860
Oh yeah, that was real quality.

282
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:58,860
I went to see the very first movie and I was all by myself in the theater with one of my best friends, Amanda, who plays DDR in the Bay Area, some of you might know her.

283
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,860
And we had so much fun, but that's all.

284
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:08,540
I think that some people who like DDR like anime because lots of people who like video

285
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,500
games are into computer nerd-type people like Matt here.

286
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,180
I'm sure that he likes tons of stuff because he spends hours and hours on the computer.

287
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,180
So it's pretty fun.

288
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,300
That was just the most interesting face you just made.

289
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,300
It is true.

290
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:28,340
It's been 20 hours a day on the computer.

291
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,940
Pretty close to that, at least.

292
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,660
The correlation between anime and DDR, I think it's just because when people are into Japanese

293
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,060
pop culture, they're into everything, anime, the music, the video games, it's kind of all

294
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:49,140
one package deal, so that's probably why right there is because you find a lot of crossovers

295
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,140
with that kind of thing.

296
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,980
Is it kind of like similar to the correlation between the Renaissance Faire, Star Trek,

297
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:05,200
and bondage and S&M? Well, they all have scantily clad women in them at one point or another,

298
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:14,520
so then, hey, we'll play anything with boobs. Definitely. So, anything else you want to

299
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:21,160
add on that, Jamie? I think it's time to bring the lusty wench into the chat room. But, no,

300
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,800
it's basically, it's just like what Matt said, I think it's the whole fan base there. You

301
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,200
You know, you get into one, you hear about the next.

302
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,760
Like, my newest obsession is the whole J-Rock visual K thing, because, well, they're pretty

303
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
men in makeup.

304
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,240
Tell me about the J-Rock obsession.

305
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,520
What is it about the J-Rock that's just...

306
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Because I notice it's like, you're...

307
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,440
For those that don't know, the Bamani Music and More program, which is on this station

308
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,120
when we're not live, all the music, we have every week, Jamie picks a song, and I pick

309
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,800
a song to play that's not in any Bamani game, but we think it should be.

310
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,560
And Jamie picked a J-Rock song, Luna C.

311
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,920
Such a whore for Luna C.

312
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,920
with Crazy For You for a Guitar Freak song, which would be a pretty damn good Guitar Freak

313
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,700
song, I have to agree with you.

314
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,440
But I noticed you're becoming obsessed with the J-Rock lately, what's up?

315
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,160
I kind of was for a little bit, and then I got really back into it during AX.

316
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,640
I actually bought a HIDE plushie, as in HIDE from Edge Japan, who killed himself in a very,

317
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,080
very controversial whole thing, but that's another story.

318
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,400
Anyway, I picked up a Luna C set over at AX.

319
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
There were lots of people.

320
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,720
There were the gacked sex kittens outside of the Hyatt Hotel, so it was all over the

321
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
place at AX.

322
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,480
Lots of people doing mana from Malus Miser cosplay.

323
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,920
I got back and just went and found all of my old MP3s and was really into it again.

324
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,320
Visual K owns.

325
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Corey is challenging you.

326
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,920
He says that Glaze is better than Lunacy.

327
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
What do you think?

328
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
I'm a whore for Lunacy.

329
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
I'm sorry.

330
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,040
I love everything they've done.

331
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,140
Like Rosier is my favorite song that they've done and Love Song.

332
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,780
Also Dark Tetsuya is reminding us that in Guitar Freak's 8th Mix, which is being location

333
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,820
tested right now, there is going to be a Gax song covered in it, so that will be pretty

334
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,820
cool.

335
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,960
And also, Dark Tetsuya, he's saying, what's wrong with Renaissance hair?

336
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,500
There's nothing wrong with a Renaissance hair, just like there's nothing wrong with Star

337
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,980
Trek and there's nothing wrong with Bondage, it's all good.

338
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
Whatever you're into.

339
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,120
They all involve leather of some kind, you know, you've got your Klingons for your leather

340
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,220
and your blood pie.

341
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,760
There you go, it's a leather correlation.

342
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
and they are into big time S&M.

343
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,200
genre you know I mean it encompasses so much you can do anything with animation

344
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,760
now you know and DDR you know that they've actually started having

345
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,880
references to DDR to be money and some different anime now I can't think of any

346
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,080
up top my head you know even Konami is putting their

347
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,300
bemoni into their other games like Tokimeki Memorial dancing summer

348
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:19,400
vacation which I have and other things like that all right well if we're done

349
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,480
with the anime topic oh sure many of the songs from initial D are in Para Para

350
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,800
right on also there's an anime you might be familiar with the head of my

351
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,440
reference King of the hill I don't know if it counts as anime it's kind of more

352
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:41,160
like scribble may or something I'd say it's more like scribble may any who I'm

353
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,720
being given I'm being fed a lot of news here I as Corey vertu is somehow in the

354
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,800
know and he's giving me all this news here that he wants me to share with you

355
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,680
and get your reaction, not only in the chatroom, but those of you here in the studio that might

356
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,160
be hearing some of this news for the first time. So, I'm presenting to you a little segment

357
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:09,160
we call, Cory Gives Sky the News, and he reports it over the show. Okay, so we have an 8 mix.

358
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,720
Apparently if you use auto-base, or auto-whatever, instead of giving you a perfect, it's now

359
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,000
going to give you an auto and it's not going to count as part of your combo.

360
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,960
What do you guys think of that?

361
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Yeah, I heard that before but he didn't say autobase, he just said instead of perfects

362
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
you get auto.

363
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
I'm like, what the hell?

364
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
There's no perfects.

365
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
They better take the short people into account.

366
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
Yeah, there should be a Jamie in the game for me to get the Jamie.

367
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
Well, no.

368
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
It's like if I'm at Spickels, the thing is too damn tall for me to reach the damn base

369
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
pedal.

370
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
If you have a chair that comes with it, then just boost up.

371
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Jamie detected.

372
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
No, for everybody.

373
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,960
It's like, if I'm at Spickels, the thing is too damn tall for me to reach the damn bass pedal.

374
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,960
It's the type of chair that comes with it that just boosts up. Jamie detected.

375
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,960
You know, for every version of Drummania that they put out, they need to send a free stool and a booster seat for me.

376
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Sorry, Drummania 7. Did I say 6? My bad.

377
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,960
They need to make the bass pedal higher.

378
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
You can have, like, adjustable bass pedal.

379
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,960
So the new Guitar Freaks and Drummania, they're going to have auto instead of perfect.

380
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,960
So that's pretty cool. It'll give you incentive to play with the auto bass.

381
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,960
But for those of us that are hype challenged in one way or another,

382
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,960
we're just going to have to get more magazines or a smaller chair or something.

383
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Also in the news, you're going to be able to set different difficulty levels

384
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
for one player and two player for Guitar Freaks.

385
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,960
So one person can do beginner and the other can do extreme or whatever.

386
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,960
You can also change the difficulty of the extra stage before you enter it.

387
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Oh, that's cool.

388
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,960
So you can do all your songs on Maniac and then be a chicken and do a basic extra stage or vice versa.

389
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,960
You just want the Maniac extra stage, just use a bunch of crappy songs to get to it.

390
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Also, there's going to be reverse mode in it too, so you can flip it just like DDR's reverse mode and now the notes can come to the bottom.

391
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,960
So it can be like beat, guitar, mania.

392
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,960
That would be like, you know, rocker mode.

393
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,960
And also, in another Bomani Game News, I'm not sure what the source is for this,

394
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
must be a Jappo site or something.

395
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,960
He says that Beatmania 3 will be the last one too.

396
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,960
They are going to be putting out Beatmania 3, the final as well,

397
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,960
to correlate with the final five key, regular Beatmania.

398
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,960
That really makes sense because they hardly use the pedal anyway.

399
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Oh, Paul's throwing his handset behind me.

400
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
It's one of our hoochie mommas.

401
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,960
So you're a hoochie momma then?

402
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,960
much to Vertu for providing all that news for us.

403
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,780
And it's all about the stupid swim park they have there and the laser tag and Beachhead

404
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,780
2000.

405
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,660
Although, Dave, tell them about your new trick for people when they're playing Beachhead

406
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,000
2000 for little kids.

407
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,880
Oh yeah, Beachhead, I'm not, I think Paul might have done this too, but I do it now

408
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,720
like a lot to little kids.

409
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,320
It has a counterweight to balance out the level of the controller that goes on your

410
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,000
head because it kind of does the VR, virtual reality type thing, where you place the controller

411
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,540
on your head with the little two joysticks coming off the bottom.

412
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:36,280
So the counterweight is behind the screen and you can kind of fit back behind all the

413
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:41,860
games and if you push down the counterweight then their controller that they've got their

414
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,520
face pushed into lifts off the ground.

415
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,380
And so you see these little kids holding on for dear life to the game.

416
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,540
So if you push the counterweight down you feel a kind of struggle and then it sort of

417
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,900
lifts off the ground and then you can hear like shouting and the parents going

418
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,780
what the fuck is this what's going on

419
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,100
I think this is all in theory, I don't know if you gave us a shot

420
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,780
I actually tried it several times yesterday

421
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,860
but the only problem is since I'm behind the machine I can't see the look on

422
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,700
their face when they poke their head out of the

423
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,740
VR game and look around going what's going on

424
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,740
What we'll do, maybe we'll take the remote out to Rosso Golf Land this Wednesday and we'll try

425
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,100
that on some people

426
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,100
orange louse bloopers and practical jokes

427
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
orange louse amazing bloopers

428
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
smile you're on orange louse camera

429
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,100
hopefully we'll get those on the website for you

430
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,100
so a ways to fuck with people in beachhead

431
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,100
have you guys figured out a way to mess with people in sumo yet?

432
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,100
for those that haven't seen sumo

433
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
the giant pokeball

434
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
it looks like you're climbing into a giant pokeball

435
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
and playing these like on a big screen tv

436
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,100
you've got these big plane games and stuff

437
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,100
and the ball moves as you fly the plane

438
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,100
i still thought it was funny when someone tried to climb on top of one

439
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:56,220
Oh yes, imagine this big red bubble with somebody piloting it, going all Evangelion on somebody,

440
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,860
and then there's somebody on top, and then there's people on the side, they're trying

441
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,860
to get you.

442
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,860
They're trying to get you!

443
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,860
I swear they are!

444
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,860
They want your brain!

445
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,740
But I wasn't sniffing your spicy brain.

446
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,040
Any other ideas on how to mess with people on other games?

447
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,140
No ideas yet, but I'm sure that you can just take a couple of hammers and pound on the

448
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
game.

449
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,340
It's like, shake it back and forth.

450
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
What's going on?

451
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,820
losing i'm not getting hit have someone play gun blade and then have them try to

452
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,420
write something

453
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,540
because you are made at the right for punishment

454
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,880
strike back for all

455
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,400
i've worked in working here i want to know how to mess with the gauntlet

456
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,340
legends players because those are the ones

457
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,540
their abscesses obsessive over the game as we are with ours i mean i a m date

458
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,060
i've seen people there all day long you know

459
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,220
red velcro is about to die a letter put in another twenty nine hundred don't

460
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,500
shoot food

461
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,820
nosy they played so much they people up the chair

462
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,660
And what I've seen, I know a couple of guys like who I just watched them play it.

463
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,060
It's like they accidentally leave it on free play for two minutes.

464
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,940
So they punch in ninety nine credits and they sit there all day.

465
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,660
And then whenever someone comes along, they dictate to them what to do.

466
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,300
It's like, OK, you go sacrificing yourself in front of the big fire breathing dragon

467
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,620
while I sit back and watch my little attacks.

468
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,380
No, but I think that we should go in all dressed up like the characters.

469
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,140
It's like Red Ogre has entered the building and we should just sit there

470
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,200
playing the game dressed up it's like move aside it's our turn to play make

471
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,440
them play the old gauntlet the other day old one oh make them play the old-school

472
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,620
gauntlet that old-school gauntlet rules so but they don't have an old-school

473
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,860
gauntlet machine at RV GL unfortunately needing haven't put that in the ultra

474
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,780
game I thought of the other game you know I noticed that when people make

475
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,220
fun of you while you're playing DDR they instantly go and play the WrestleMania

476
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,620
game so I want to know how to mess with those people that are put the the WWF

477
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,620
The one that's right in the front as you walk in?

478
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,620
Those Slim Jims, Adam, I don't know.

479
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,620
I think playing that awful WWF game in Gauntlet Legends is just punishment for now.

480
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,620
Until the Day of Reckoning, which they will burn!

481
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:56,620
Just come up to them, it's like wearing a bandana, snap into a Slim Jim, oh yeah!

482
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,620
Take it!

483
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,620
I think it's time for a break, what do you guys think?

484
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,620
Uh, I get to break more stuff?

485
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,620
Alright, we got lots of things to celebrate in the 2DX world this week.

486
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,620
We have 2DX 6 style coming out in just four more days.

487
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:18,100
days for the Japanese PlayStation 2s so you can order your import machine and then play

488
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:24,200
some 2DX at home. Also, I'm being told that after a few weeks of downtime, 2DXstyle.net

489
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,140
is back up and running, so if you haven't visited them yet, go visit our links page

490
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:34,660
and they've got a link on it to 2DXstyle. And if you don't know our website, it's at

491
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,260
OrangeLounge.skie.cx

492
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,440
and visit that one too while you're at it.

493
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,300
So in honor of these

494
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,740
such momentous 2DX events, I'm going to play a whole set of 2DX songs for you.

495
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,980
What do you say?

496
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:53,980
I say okay. Alright, we'll be right back.

There's no need to be

546
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,740
There's no need to be

547
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,740
You are my destiny

548
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:32,420
I'm trying to lie for you, I'm trying to fight for me

549
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,420
When you lose it's me, you're everything

550
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,420
I'm trying to lie for you, I'm trying to fight for me

551
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:52,420
You know what you want, you're different But that's not you, sure I will see you through

552
00:44:52,420 --> 00:45:01,420
No time for sleepin' when I can't take control Understand, oh, oh, oh

553
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:06,420
You need to set you free Keepin' the pace of time

554
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,420
I'd like to take a ride

555
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,420
You can't halfway move it too soon

556
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,420
There's no truth in what you give

557
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,420
And you can't deny

558
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,420
You're new to hope

559
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,420
All that you wish for is to have it

560
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,420
You're flying evil

561
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,420
Have fun while you can

562
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,420
And remember

563
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:34,340
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

564
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:38,340
Bimani Radio. That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

565
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,340
Yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. This is episode number four

566
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,340
for this July the 14th, 2002.

567
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:50,340
A long break there of all 2DX songs. We had Colors from

568
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,340
Six Styles, A from Seventh Style, Cracker from

569
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:58,340
Fifth Style for the home version, In My Eyes Fifth Style, Frozen Ray

570
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,340
from Sixth Style, and an old school one, Shine On from 2DX

571
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:07,420
second style, which the chat room commented, uh, one of Taka's best, although I don't think

572
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:11,300
it was in reference to that song. That's by Shorai, actually, 2DX second style. I might

573
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:16,460
be corrected on that, though. Anyway, we took a long break because we are prepping for this

574
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:23,920
segment that we're gonna do, which we're gonna call Listless. That's right. We are going

575
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:31,160
to determine the worst song in Bamani history, besides Let Them Move. Let Them Move is already

576
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,160
assumed to be the worst song of Bahmani history, so that's not a factor. We're gonna determine

577
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:42,120
the second worst song in Bahmani history right here. So, we've got everybody on the panel

578
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:47,000
here who's written down their top three choices for worst Bahmani song ever. They've ordered

579
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,840
it in the numbers three to one, and we're gonna name off what we think the worst Bahmani

580
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:57,840
song is ever and why. And after that, we'll get to eliminate one choice from the list.

581
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,800
I'll have a list of 15 choices because there's five of us here and then each of us will get to

582
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,520
Take one choice off of the list and then after that with the ten songs

583
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,780
It'll be remaining the chat room gets to vote and determine

584
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,000
What is the worst song in Bimani history next to let them move?

585
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,200
So if you're in the chat room right now, you'll get to participate in this

586
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,440
It'll be your vote that determines what the worst song is in Bimani history next to let them move

587
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,720
so let's start with

588
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:31,480
What was your number three worst Bimani song in history?

589
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,440
I really, really hate Let the Beat Hit Em.

590
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,440
Let the Beat Hit Em, alright.

591
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:42,280
Although, you know, I made history by willingly playing the song last night on Max.

592
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,680
You actually played Let the Beat Hit Em last night?

593
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,680
That's because I like the Max one, but I don't like the first one that they had.

594
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,240
What was in third mix?

595
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,160
I really, really don't like it at all.

596
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,000
I think it might have been a solo song originally, is where it came from originally.

597
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,640
I don't really care for that version.

598
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,620
My number three worst Bimani song in history, I'm so going to get smacked for this.

599
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:05,280
I know I'm going to get smacked for this, but for some reason I just don't like this

600
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,920
song when I hear it.

601
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,720
My number three choice is Graduistic Cyber.

602
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,720
It's Gradiuzic Cyber.

603
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,720
Whatever.

604
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,720
Gradius.

605
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,720
Gradius.

606
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,720
That song is cool.

607
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,720
I'm going to kick you.

608
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,200
Anyway, my number three pick is Bye Bye Baby Balloon because, well they already made it

609
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,680
like three times and then they put a new name on it and some freeze arrows and so

610
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,520
it does not deserve to be Lonnie music well it kind of does because all the

611
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:37,040
other ones are the same thing but yes ball number three I had a lot of fun

612
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:42,120
playing this on drum mania before when guitar bricks was free fixed and it was

613
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,800
just a really cool song and finally I played on a tarp it's you know I've done

614
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,480
with them with them and I and the guitar part just breaks out in this awful like

615
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:57,480
Scotts, it could be like, double trouble has the worst guitar freaks part I've ever played and it really disappointed me so I just had to put that on there.

616
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,480
Double trouble.

617
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,480
For guitar freaks, for guitar freaks this is.

618
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,480
Oh god, there's like way too many songs I could list on here.

619
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,480
Um, two, unfortunately I was kind of sticking with DDR here but um, two that really stick out of my mind.

620
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,480
Well you gotta just give them your number three choice.

621
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,480
Alright fine. Number three would have to go to, are you ready to do the bus stop from Disneyland?

622
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,680
Oh, that's a good one.

623
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,080
That song sucks.

624
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,880
That's all it is.

625
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,920
I agree.

626
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,520
The oldies in Disney's Rave, what was that?

627
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,640
Why did they put all these oldies in Disney's Rave?

628
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,320
Mr. Bassman owns.

629
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,520
OK, Mr. Bassman does own.

630
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,360
I'll give you that.

631
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,080
Mr. Bassman owns Dropout.

632
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:33,880
But Bus Stop?

633
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,360
What's the other one that annoys the hell out of me?

634
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,680
There's another old school song.

635
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,480
Macarena.

636
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,400
OK, there's that.

637
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,480
That's a given.

638
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,600
And Johnny B. Goode.

639
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,120
No.

640
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,360
That was fun.

641
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,240
It's something that you heard in grade school,

642
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,680
You did it during the Disney reveal.

643
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,000
It works for DDR.

644
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,960
I don't know.

645
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,920
All right, everybody's number three's picks are out.

646
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,720
We have Let the Beat Hit Em, Graduistics Cyber, Bye Bye Baby

647
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,360
Balloon, Double Trouble, and Bus Stops.

648
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,240
Number two choices.

649
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,360
Jamie.

650
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,680
Number two would be Buell.

651
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,360
I hate Buell.

652
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,240
Buell is a good one.

653
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,000
That's a good one.

654
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,600
Very good.

655
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:15,840
My number two choice was another 2DX song.

656
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,860
you're correct you're correcting my spelling on what is this I'm typing

657
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,060
these out so we can see the list of what we have so we can eliminate things later

658
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:27,780
my number two choice for worst Bomani song and I might get smacked for this

659
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:31,140
because it's another 2dx song but I really just don't like this song it

660
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:37,560
would be a kamikaze from 2d export style I hate that song kamikaze I've never

661
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:43,420
actually heard that song but my number two is I first heard it on the DDR USA

662
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,420
My Fire, because that song is just terrible.

663
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,420
You don't like My Fire?

664
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,420
No, I don't.

665
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,420
Blasphemer.

666
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,420
That's old school.

667
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,420
It's enough to be retro.

668
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,420
That was my favorite song back then.

669
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,420
No, see, Butterfly and Boom Boom Dollar are old school.

670
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,420
This is just crap.

671
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,420
This is on 1.5.

672
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,420
First it was cool, then it was very uncool, and now it's retro cool.

673
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:01,420
It's gone through the cycle.

674
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,420
Retro cool.

675
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,420
Okay, my number two is a very generic choice for a course song.

676
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,420
It just has the diva part, it has the rap part, everything that would be characteristic

677
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,420
in a DDR song, and it's all done badly.

678
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,420
It's just a bad song. You gotta get that on there.

679
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:22,420
Aw man, I don't know if I can top that one.

680
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:35,420
Let's see, my second pick would have to go to Choto from DDR Club Mix and also second mix Link version.

681
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,420
I don't even, that was just, it was a Laugh and Peace track and it was just awful.

682
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:44,420
How in the hell do you even spell that one? I don't even think I've played that one.

683
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:48,420
Let's see here, uh, C-H-O-T-T-O.

684
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:55,420
And then, um, the second part of it is K-I-I-N-T-E-N-A.

685
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,420
By Laugh and Peace. And it sucks.

686
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,340
getting screamed at from the chat room for some of our number two choices which

687
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:10,020
again were Buell, Kamikaze, My Fire, D2R, and Choto Kitene. A lot of people

688
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,820
disagree with Kamikaze. Cory is crying because he loves D2R and doesn't

689
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:20,900
understand why none of us seem to like it. All right, number one picks for worst

690
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,300
Vemani song ever. That's my vote to strangle Polteri, I mean sorry, Queens

691
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:30,300
Jamaica. Queens Jamaica, wow. I hate Queens Jamaica. I hate Queens Jamaica

692
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,100
because way back when on the old hip-hop mania machine that we had, everybody made

693
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,860
me freakin play that song and I hate it. And it's also on my on my 5th mixed

694
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:45,500
non-stop and it always comes up right after my favorite song. So I hate it.

695
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Alright, my number one choice for Worship Imani song in history besides Let Them Move

696
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,500
would be Jam Jam Reggae.

697
00:53:53,500 --> 00:54:00,500
I'm sorry, I just, it's annoying, no.

698
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,500
No.

699
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:08,500
Okay, my least favorite song is, I'm going on Corey's naming because I don't know the

700
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:14,420
name, it's Under Control, which is the encore stage for long version songs for guitar, seventh

701
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:20,660
mix, a Drummania VI mix, and the reason why I picked it is because it's just grunge music.

702
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:27,460
It's terrible. It belongs not in Bamani, it belongs in underground crap music that's not

703
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:34,460
even made in the CDs. And I avoid playing it by failing. I fail the extra stage, which

704
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:38,860
is one phrase blues, which is an awesome song, just so I don't even have to hear the beginning

705
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,500
of that song. It's so bad.

706
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:49,500
Some really bad songs have a nice thing about them, like Detour was like hilarious, the best worst song ever.

707
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:55,500
Jim Jim Regge has some fun steps on Maniac, but this song, I heard about it before, and it was coming in the DDR, I was like, oh that's alright.

708
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:03,500
And then I played the song and the steps are so slow, which is an awful song on the DDR, the steps are tub thumping, had the worst steps on the DDR, and I was so pissed about it.

709
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,500
God, what a bad song.

710
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,500
Don't think you're going to get much argument there.

711
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,500
Yeah, but it gets knocked down, but it gets up again.

712
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,500
You're never going to keep it down.

713
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,500
Alright.

714
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,500
Matt, you're the final choice on the list.

715
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,500
Alright.

716
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,500
There was just, like I said, so many to choose from.

717
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,500
I was going to say now Jam Jam Reggae.

718
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:28,500
And I'm talking about the original one from BeatMania, because that one is damn awful.

719
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:34,500
But then again, there was another one from BeatMania that was also very awful, and that would be Love So Groovy.

720
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,500
Love So Groovy.

721
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:41,580
I hate that song it's just awful. That was originally one of my picks too.

722
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:45,180
Alright so the big list here here we go this is all

723
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:49,020
15 choices and we're gonna now eliminate one song at a time we have

724
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:53,500
Let the Beat Hit Em, Graduistics Cyber, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble,

725
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,900
Bus Stop, Veal, Kamikaze, My Fire, D2R,

726
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:01,620
Choto Katana, Queens Jamaica, Jam Jam Reggae, Under Control, Tub Thumping,

727
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:05,580
and Love So Groovy. Once we get this narrowed down to 10 the chat room will

728
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:11,100
get to vote on what they think is the worst song ever.

729
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,100
And then we're going to play it.

730
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,100
No, I'm just kidding.

731
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,100
I think some of the songs are so bad that we'd never bother to get them.

732
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,500
And it will be banned forever from the Orange Lounge playlist.

733
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,620
It will never, ever be played on Orange Lounge, ever.

734
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,420
And there was much rejoicing.

735
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,420
Yay!

736
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,420
All right.

737
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,860
So, Jamie, from this list of 15, which one are you granting a pardon to?

738
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,460
Gratiosic Cyber has to come off.

739
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,860
I have a feeling you would.

740
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,580
Gratiosic Cyber has to come off.

741
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,580
That is my freaking song.

742
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,580
Alright.

743
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,580
I finally, finally managed to beat him, then.

744
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,580
Alright, so it gets saved.

745
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:44,580
I, yeah, he would kill me, but he's not here, ha ha ha.

746
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:50,580
I am going to grant a pardon to I'm Sorry Dave, but Under Control is fucking hilarious,

747
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,580
and it goes off the list.

748
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,580
This song's so bad.

749
00:56:54,580 --> 00:57:00,580
Okay, well, then I guess I'll just have to take off Jim Jim Reggae off the list, because

750
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:07,580
song rocks on doubles maniac

751
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:14,160
it was from one point five and it's a cool retro cool song my fire needs to take it off the list

752
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,940
totally agree with that one

753
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:19,140
and i don't know about the steps in tump thumping i thought it was damn easy so i

754
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:24,140
had a really cool edit for it so i'm gonna have to take tump thumping off the list there

755
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,100
hey! that would have won!

756
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,800
i don't care take it off the list

757
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:36,600
everybody boo Matt please yay all right so we've taken five songs off the list

758
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:41,080
and these are the ten that are left let the beat hit them bye bye baby balloon

759
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:49,080
double trouble bus stop Buell kamikaze d2r Choto Katana

760
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:56,040
Queens Jamaica and love so groovy it's so it's too late to add songs

761
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,040
There's the 10, I just posted them in chat room.

762
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,960
Chat room, send me a private message, please, with your vote.

763

And we'll tally up the votes.

And we'll come back and let you know the worst Bimani song in history

769
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,400
next to Let Them Move.

770
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,040
You have something to say, Jimmy?

771
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,040
No.

772
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:25,560
OK.

773
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,560
I can't believe you picked Grady as Xyber.

774
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,840
Max tracks. Let's do some of the Max exclusive tracks. People like these songs.

775
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,560
We're going to take a quick break here and we'll be right back with the worst

776
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,560
I'm waiting for your votes in the chat room right now.

777
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,560
Mother let her know that she was in the mood for talking

778
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,560
So when he began to play the game

779
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:42,560
Before he knew it he had told her how much he'd been hurting

780
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,560
How he was hoping she was not the same

781
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,560
Could this be the kind of way that I'm thinking

782
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,560
After all of this time, could this be true love?

783
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:56,560
And she says, boy, you don't have to love no more

784
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,560
I'll give the love you need till you holler in love, guaranteed

785
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,560
I'd like to live for I'm a kind lady

786
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,560
You've been hard to be so but I am the cure

787
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,560
And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

788
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,560
The best day boy you know you can count on me

789
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,560
Believe me, this lady

790
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,560
You know what you found in me

791
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,560
Is a lady, kind of lady

792
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,560
That can give you what you need

793
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,560
Maybe a kind lady

794
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,560
That will never leave you lonely

795
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,560
And maybe this lady

796
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,560

797
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,560

815
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,400
life where we are right in the middle of determining the worst song in baumannii

816
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,960
history next to let them move let them move is already a given that it's a

817
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:06,520
first place so we're doing the next worst baumannii song ever and the votes

818
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:11,760
are in. We've asked everybody in our chat room to vote on the list which we had

819
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:18,120
which consisted of Let the Beat Hit Them, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble, Bus

820
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:26,880
Stop, Buell, Kamikaze, D2R, Choto Katana, Queens Jamaica, and Love So Groovy. And we

821
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:36,800
do have a winner in third place is let the beat hit them I don't know how that

822
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,200
corresponds to let the beat hit them but I thought it was a funny sound file in

823
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,520
second place for worst of the money song ever

824
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:52,640
Buell oh my goodness I can't believe it everything's ruined everything's ruined

825
01:05:52,640 --> 01:06:00,560
by Buell. Buell, the second worst Bamani song in history. And the worst Bamani song in history

826
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:09,320
next to Let Them Move is Bye Bye Baby Balloon. We're just going to flush that one down the

827
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:16,600
toilet and pretend it didn't exist. Bye Bye Baby Balloon was the winner. Oh yeah, I guess

828
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,760
the winner of losing first-place loser

829
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,440
it's like said that i i think the balloon it was so bad that they didn't

830
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:28,360
even put it in max to it just got taken right off a max and flushed up but you

831
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,640
gotta think of it this way

832
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,520
you'll succeed more cuz he can even lose right

833
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,600
yes to come second it being the worst song ever

834
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,560
good point to point

835
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:42,040
no unfortunately i do not have a drum roll sound but i do have this

836
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,160
for what all tells next joke on the show

837
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,160
Okay.

838
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,160
That's pressure.

839
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:54,480
I had this tower of vanilla Coke cans that I was building up that just fell over.

840
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,480
I'm surprised you guys didn't hear the sound of that.

841
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,480
My Leaning Tower of Vanilla Coke.

842
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,480
Anyway.

843
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,480
Oh, I have to...

844
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:01,480
Yes?

845
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:07,480
Actually, you know, for all of the songs I think that are so terrible, we do have to

846
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:12,840
remember that because these songs are so bad, they give value to the songs that are really

847
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,840
good.

848
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,840
Good point.

849
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,840
Good point.

850
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:21,920
Maybe in a future edition, do you think we'd have the balls to do the best Bomani song

851
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,920
ever?

852
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:23,920
Oh, totally.

853
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,920
Alright.

854
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,920
Well, we'll do that.

855
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,840
Do we have the balls here at this radio station?

856
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:39,000
We've got balls bigger than anybody because they're inflatable, like our egos.

857
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,840
Okay, tournaments.

858
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,220
There were some tournaments this weekend, there was a tournament up in Reno, unfortunately

859
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:48,400
none of us were able to get up there and go I don't even know what the results

860
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,620
were yet unfortunately but are you guys going to be going to any upcoming

861
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:55,020
tournaments? It seems like there's so many tournaments going on lately what you

862
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:59,260
think it's just because of summertime or? I think that's because people are bored

863
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:03,700
so they just want to have a tournament? Did you hear about now this is cool there's

864
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:08,220
going to be a tournament at SVGL they're having the and I unfortunately don't

865
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,760
recall the right name of it but I'm sure I'll be correct in the chat room it's

866
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,700
something like the DDR Royal Rumble basically they're gonna be having a

867
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:18,900
a perfect attack tournament that's kind of tied in a little bit to wrestling.

868
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:22,140
They're going to have a tag team thing, they're going to have a rumble, and then they're going

869
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:26,660
to have a typical kind of bracketed perfect attack tournament as well.

870
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:27,660
Triple threat, thank you.

871
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:33,100
It's being called the DER triple threat tournament, but they're having it on Thursday and Friday,

872
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,220
so that kind of sucks for me because I can't go.

873
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:39,620
It's like all the weekends are booked, so now they're having to do weekdays for tournaments.

874
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,700
What do you guys think about tournaments on weekdays?

875
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:48,540
blows for because people have jobs. I can't really comment on jobs or responsibilities but I'll be

876
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:55,460
there. Well I can't really comment on that either but I've got so much school. Totally blows even

877
01:08:55,460 --> 01:09:00,980
more. I don't care perfect attack is boring don't want to go. Okay but you have to admit though you

878
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:04,140
have to admit Matt even though perfect attack is boring the stuff they're doing with this

879
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:08,540
tournament is gonna make it a little more exciting because they're gonna have the music and the big

880
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:11,940
costumes and everything just so I grew up.

881
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:17,340
That's just like watching that 80s show and then the final episode of that 80s show.

882
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:22,020
It's just a little bit better, but it still sucks.

883
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:26,300
I don't really know what this Royal Rumble they're talking about.

884
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,860
Everyone pile on the machine and stomp on one arrow.

885
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:32,340
No, it doesn't work like that unfortunately, although that would be fun I think.

886
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:36,100
The way they're doing the Royal Rumble is basically you're going to draw a number randomly

887
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,800
from one through thirty.

888
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:43,400
the first two people go up and whoever wins stays on the machine. Now to prevent the last

889
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:48,200
person from just coming up there, say the first guy beats 29 people and then loses the

890
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:52,000
last guy, that would really suck for him. So they have this little system they're using

891
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,080
called chips where if you beat so many people you get a chip and basically it moves you

892
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,240
back to the end of the line and you can come back on after the 30th person. So that's kind

893
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:03,880
of how they're doing the Royal Rumble so that should be interesting. That's a very good

894
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:04,880
Good idea.

895
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,880
It is a very good idea.

896
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,080
I'm still wanting to have guitar freaks, drum mania, visual kei.

897
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:14,560
I'm very surprised there hasn't been any kind of drum mania, guitar freaks.

898
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,800
That would be really simple to do.

899
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,700
Rob, if we ever do have another tournament here in Sacramento, that we have to use my

900
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,860
idea of PA with answering trivia questions.

901
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:28,080
And whenever you get one wrong, you get beaten with some object, and the object's continually

902
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,080
getting more...

903
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,080
The orange bat of doom.

904
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,840
Yeah, well, that'll start out as the first thing, and then it'll move up to bean bag

905
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:39,600
bags, and then other stuff that hurts more, and so you lose your concentration faster.

906
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,600
I underestimate the orange bat. I think he needs to be reminded.

907
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,760
The orange bat should be the final boss of whatever that is.

908
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,540
The final boss of the tournament. By the way, Matt, you made a Virtu cry that Perfect Attack

909
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:56,020
isn't boring, because he really practices. Well, I think back to one of my first tournament

910
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:02,920
experiences, which was MGL1, and, God damn, there wasn't any... That was the most boring

911
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:07,160
thing ever, just waiting for Freesale to come around, just watching all the people get up

912
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,920
on the machine, complaining that the buttons aren't working, and they have to stop, and

913
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:17,160
they have to test the buttons, and the buttons were working. It is so boring. Oh, and Folsom,

914
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:23,200
when we had our SCAT tournament, it was even worse, because then you had the whole thing

915
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:29,120
just packed, and then there's nothing to do. But, I do have to admit, at the very end of

916
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,920
the perfect attack in the Folsom tournament where they had to do the versus. That was

917
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:39,800
cool. But like I said, the rest of it sucked. That's why this year we're not having a tourney

918
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:44,540
named after feces. No, instead we're going to find another crude word to name it after.

919
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:48,340
I notice you've got some listings here of some upcoming tournaments. Let's see what

920
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:51,600
some other local tournaments. Well, we're not just a local show. We'll talk about some

921
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,180
of the abroad tournaments. It looks like there's a pretty popular tournament. Oh, this is kind

922
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,180
a local.

923
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:06,640
There's going to be a tournament at Mountain Mike's in Concord on August 17th, which is

924
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,740
interesting because I believe it's going to be a no-bar machine.

925
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,620
I don't know if they were going to take the bars off for Perfect Attack as well, but I

926
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,060
know for Freestyle there is going to be no bar on the machine.

927
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:18,500
If I recall, I do believe that the bar will be removed, but...

928
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,580
Perfect Attack, if it isn't removed, then if you grab the bar and you don't look like

929
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:24,700
you're falling down, you'll get disqualified.

930
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,700
Who uses the bar for perfect attack anyway?

931
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,700
There's people who rape the bar.

932
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,700
That's disgusting.

933
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:34,700
I don't see it in tournaments, though. I don't think I've ever seen anyone grab the bar in a tournament.

934
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:35,700
I've seen it happen.

935
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:36,700
Really?

936
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:42,700
I mean, the only time I think I really see people grab the bar would be on Fast songs.

937
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:47,700
When Dropout was first, you know, the new song to beat, everybody, all the cool kids want to beat Dropout.

938
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,700
Some people have held the bar for that, and then of course Max and Max Unlimited.

939
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,700
I can't say that I've ever really held on to the bar.

940
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:59,620
When I was learning how to beat MAX 300, I was using it for a while, but then I was like,

941
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,620
you know what?

942
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:01,620
No.

943
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:05,140
I just want to do this with my feet because it doesn't seem right unless I can do it with

944
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:06,140
my feet.

945
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:07,700
At MAX Unlimited, I haven't allowed myself to touch the bar at all.

946
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:11,380
I'm really bad at MAX 300 and MAX Unlimited, but I've gotten further through them without

947
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:16,140
using the bar than I have using it because it just totally throws off my center of balance.

948
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:22,620
The bar is there, I think, to catch yourself if you're falling for emergencies.

949
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:28,760
the original solo machines, the Japanese solo machines, they don't have a bar on them, so.

950
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,760
We have more tournaments.

951
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,040
Yeah, can you go back to that listing of tournaments there that you had up on the screen there?

952
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:38,000
Look at some other tournaments that seem to be pretty popular.

953
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Use the little...

954
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Use the rules for...

955
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
There you go.

956
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
There we go.

957
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,840
We're having a moment while we...

958
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,440
Okay, we're looking at some other popular looking tournaments that are coming up.

959
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:52,840
Of course, there's the big one at Castor Valley Golf Land on July 20th.

960
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:57,940
The week right after that, they're having one in Rohnert Park, Scandia.

961
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:01,480
The same day as the big Mountain Mikes in Concord, they're going to be having one in

962
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,480
SoCal.

963
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,280
Now, this one's kind of a controversial tournament.

964
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:08,560
They're having the Rays Game Center tournament, and it's kind of a bit controversial because

965
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:14,920
it's not DDR Drags, which has caused some controversy on some message boards.

966
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:20,400
I was told in no uncertain terms that when I was in San Diego I was not to go to Ray's.

967
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,400
I guess some interesting things going on there, I don't know if we want to get into it on

968
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:29,480
the show, but apparently they've decided, the owner of the place decided to make a change

969
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:33,520
with who's going to be running the tournament and not going over well with some people down

970
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,520
there.

971
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:39,040
But they are still going to be doing a tournament on the 17th, same day as the one in Concord.

972
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,400
So unfortunately that's going to split things up a bit.

973
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:47,020
I know Drags 2, I went down to Drags 2 which was about a year ago and one of the best tournaments

974
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:48,020
I went to.

975
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:49,020
It was a great road trip.

976
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,020
It was a lot of fun.

977
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,020
I really like road tripping sometimes.

978
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,020
I had to miss it.

979
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,020
I was home all by myself, crying.

980
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,020
Bummer.

981
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,020
Can we go back to the list?

982
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:58,020
Yes, please.

983
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:08,160
When is the 17th of the 8th month of the year because I don't know.

984
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:12,160
I'm like captain, not look at obvious stuff.

985
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:15,160
It is Saturday, to my knowledge, yeah.

986
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,160
Okay, we have the list back up.

987
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:22,160
We've got, they're going to be doing a tournament in Texas on July 19th and 20th.

988
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,160
Kind of interesting there.

989
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,160
The ones on Friday, Fridays are kind of interesting.

990
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:31,160
They're going to have a tournament in Salinas on August 3rd.

991
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,160
Midwest Showdown 2.

992
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,160
And they've got some other tournaments coming.

993
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:41,400
too far off the calendars. He was like, August 17th is really the last thing that's planned.

994
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:45,480
Are there results for yesterday's tournament in Reno up there? Why don't we go ahead and

995
01:15:45,480 --> 01:16:02,480
read those off if we've got them. They might not be up yet. Okay, we'll research that.

996
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:07,840
room kind of wondering, ooh, should I go to the tournament at Ray's? Should I not? Well,

997
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:13,280
I guess I just didn't, just, it's kind of, do you want to, you know, be a part of the

998
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:17,440
boycott or whatever's going on or not? Or do you just want to just look past all that

999
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,440
and just go after it?

1000
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,440
Your soul hangs in the balance.

1001
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:23,480
Go to Dollar Mandy's Summer Vacation. No bar. In Concord. You know, she'd drive farther

1002
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,120
for a tournament that's maybe not be good or have no bar.

1003
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,360
And some tasty pizza.

1004
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,120
Remember, Paul, it's an international, it's a national show. It's actually an international

1005
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:36,160
show. I do have listeners in Japan. The cool thing is, on the live 365 stats, I can see

1006
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:39,560
where the listeners are listening from, and I do have listeners listening in from Japan,

1007
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,560
so that's pretty cool, huh?

1008
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,560
That's pretty sweet.

1009
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,560
They're robots.

1010
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,640
They are robots. All over the place. We have listeners in Canada as well, and all sorts

1011
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,640
of places.

1012
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,240
So, it'd be about eight hours earlier and another time, I believe, right over there

1013
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,240
now?

1014
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,240
Yes, so...

1015
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:59,240
My ex-roommate, actually, she may be one of the people listening, so Candace, if you're

1016
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,240
listening, hi.

1017
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,240
Right on.

1018
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:05,120
Okay, so I think we've beaten the tournament topic into the ground.

1019
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:10,560
Another topic that we wanted to talk about, Poppin' Music.

1020
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,340
There's a brand new Poppin' Music coming out, Poppin' Music 8, and is it just me or does

1021
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,920
nobody seem to care?

1022
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:17,920
I like Poppin' Music!

1023
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:18,920
I do too!

1024
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:19,920
I love Poppin' Music!

1025
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:20,920
I suck at it!

1026
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:21,920
I think it's so cool!

1027
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,400
But why is it that it's kind of forgotten?

1028
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,080
You never hear it talked about.

1029
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:37,080
Poppin' music is just like, hey, I got an idea. Let's take 2DX, lose the turntable, make all the buttons really, really big and colorful. Wow, that sounds great.

1030
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:42,080
It sounds like some kind of fruit roll-ups mistake. Like, what do we pour on the buttons? Why are they getting so big?

1031
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:47,080
But I think it's because pop music isn't a lot of arcades. It's more of like a novelty thing that people don't really play that much.

1032
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:54,080
Poppin' music is pretty challenging, though. I thought I could get right up and play it, and I totally failed like Cutie Honey on Auto-Malo 2.

1033
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,380
Do you think it's just because the machines are so scattered amongst the U.S., you don't

1034
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,800
really see them in the...

1035
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,280
There's no pop and music machines, to my knowledge, anyway, in the Bay Area, which is where the

1036
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:08,620
majority of your board posters come from, because it was the first area that had Bomani.

1037
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:12,840
SoCal has a couple machines, Arcade Infinity, I've been there, I play them...

1038
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,840
It's a fun game.

1039
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,600
I like the ones when you have to hit four at once, you kind of have to use your forearms

1040
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,280
to hit the buttons, it's pretty crazy.

1041
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,840
Yeah, karate chop!

1042
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,680
And also, I think they have a machine in Seattle, but they're kind of spotty, the location of

1043
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,680
the machine.

1044
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,920
Do you think that's the only reason people look at it?

1045
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,560
Sort of out of sight, out of mind.

1046
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:34,080
At AI, why play pop-in music when you can play Mambo-a-Go-Go?

1047
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,960
I mean, that's all I have to say.

1048
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,280
Because Mambo-a-Go-Go has like ten songs, and once you've played them all...

1049
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:44,000
Personally, I find Mambo-a-Go-Go to be kind of easy, personally.

1050
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Even on the hard mode.

1051
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
You can play it with all nine of the things and get like, you can beat the hardest song on that?

1052
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I don't know if I played the hardest song, but I played hard mode and it wasn't, you know, 2DX is harder for me, but I guess that's a given.

1053
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Do we have the pop music gate?

1054
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
So what's the information on the, what do you want to tell us about pop and music gate, Matt?

1055
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Okay, well, this information comes from BimaniStyle.com. We've got, looks like a couple features here.

1056
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:24,000
First off, there's going to be a mode called Beat Pop, which is basically you have, instead of the nice little, I guess, stuff they normally have falling down the screen, you have lines just like Beat Mania, that type of thing, kind of makes it look more like that.

1057
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:39,000
They have a sort of a dark mode called Soft Discretion Line, and it just turns the indicator a little bit darker, so it's kind of like dark mode, and then they have one that's really cool that's called Disjointed Speed Mode.

1058
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,640
And, what that is, is where, for instance, if it were to be applied to DDR, you'd have

1059
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:50,220
like the left arrow going at four speed, you'd have the up arrow going at two speed, maybe

1060
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:56,040
the right arrow at one speed, and then maybe, I don't know, the down arrow or something

1061
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,040
at another speed.

1062
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,400
So, basically, if all the arrows going at different speeds, or in this case...

1063
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,240
It's going at speeds, sounds like some weird band name.

1064
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,280
It would be really hard to play.

1065
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:11,280
That's kind of pretty much all the new features that are going to be coming out for that.

1066
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:17,280
As far as the song list goes, there's a couple songs coming over from different Bomani.

1067
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,280
You've got Candy, the vocal version from Max 2.

1068
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:27,280
You have Boa Boa Lady from BeatMania.

1069
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,640
you've got a much better jam jam right now let's see here

1070
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:34,640
Linus I think that was 2d x 6 style

1071
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:38,240
let's see here we've got

1072
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:42,520
I'll see jet world

1073
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:46,520
that's gonna be coming over to it and then just a whole bunch attracts

1074
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:51,040
much new stuff any a familiar artists on there with new stuff talk attack

1075
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,320
LED any those artists making a appearance on the new pop music

1076
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:57,320
Actually, to be honest, it doesn't have the artist's names in here.

1077
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,320
Oh, bummer.

1078
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:03,320
The only one that I do recognize from Beatmania would be...

1079
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,320
Oh, shoot.

1080
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:09,320
I can't remember the name.

1081
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,320
Did, um...

1082
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,320
Okay, driving this into the ground here.

1083
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,320
Oh, that's all right. When you think of it, you can let us know.

1084
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:18,320
We're actually having a request, though, from the chat room.

1085
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,320
They want an update, Matt.

1086
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:25,360
seem to be our simulator expert here. What's going on in the Sim world? Because we haven't

1087
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,760
talked about it yet this show, so they want to hear what's going on.

1088
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:34,560
Alright, well, Sim stuff going on. Right now, pretty much two things that we've been waiting

1089
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,160
for have been the new versions of StepMania and Dance with Intensity. Dance with Intensity,

1090
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:45,480
we're still waiting for them to actually release a beta of version two. StepMania has been

1091
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:49,880
coming out with new betas. They have beta four now, which is alright. I've been trying

1092
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:54,880
I'm still sticking with Dance with Intensity because it loads up really fast.

1093
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:02,880
That's why I seem to like it. I'd rather have the faster loading over all the bonus features that they've got there.

1094
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:09,880
For StepMania, I don't know if it was just Beta 3 or just the computer that I played it on,

1095
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:14,880
but two-thirds of the time or more when you ever hit an up and down jump arrow

1096
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,700
Whenever you held one of the up and down jump arrows and tried to hit, well held the up

1097
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,820
and down arrow, or either one of them tried to hit the other one, it wouldn't register

1098
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:27,620
or it would register just as like a boo or a good or something.

1099
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:33,500
So I don't know if that's just on all beta 3 or just on the computer that I use.

1100
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,980
I'm not really sure about that one.

1101
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:40,260
But the other thing that's going to be going on is the contest that they had for, the DWI

1102
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:47,260
as they had put out by DDR East Coast Invasion is they're actually doing voting right now

1103
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:52,940
and it should have been wrapped up today according to their boards but I still haven't seen anything

1104
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:57,980
on that yet and the melting pot boards are still messed up.

1105
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:01,860
Now I am getting a rumor here that DWI2, one of the new features, is going to be a groove

1106
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:02,860
meter.

1107
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:03,860
So that will be pretty cool.

1108
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:04,940
I wouldn't doubt it.

1109
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:10,420
He's been looking for a good code for, you know, some good source codes to actually generate

1110
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:13,540
those much like, you know, StepMania has.

1111
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,820
Really big deal.

1112
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:17,260
I mean, I saw that with StepMania too.

1113
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:21,220
I was just like, okay, so I don't look at that anyways.

1114
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,220
Okay.

1115
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:24,100
Thank you very much.

1116
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,100
All right.

1117
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,820
We're going to take another quick break and when we come back, we'll interact with the

1118
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:31,740
chat room a little more, talk about whatever they want us to talk about.

1119
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:36,160
have some other topics here that we can get into if we want. And God, who knows what else

1120
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:39,620
we're going to talk about here on Orange Lounge. Maybe we'll just say, screw Bomani, and we'll

1121
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:43,700
just talk about other stuff. I don't know. Anyway, you're listening to Orange Lounge.

1122
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:48,060
How are you doing over there, Jamie? I'm on the floor. You're on the floor? Do you want

1123
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:53,720
to kick Matt out of the chair? Can I just kick him? Okay. Cool. Or I can get you another

1124
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,200
chair if you want. Don't worry about it.

1125
01:23:56,200 --> 01:24:03,200
Alright, we'll be back in a little bit.

1126
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,200
Hi, everybody!

1127
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,200
Hello, hello.

1128
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,200
Mic test.

1129
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,200
Mic, mic test.

1130
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,200
I am D.G.

1131
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,200
Sendai!

1132
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,200
We must hear your comments, brother.

1133
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,200
D.G.

1134
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,200
Number one, D.U.

1135
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,200
D.U.

1136
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,200
D.U.

1137
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,200
D.U.

1138
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,200
Hey, everybody.

1139
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,200
Haro, haro.

1140
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,200
Mic test.

1141
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,200
Mic, mic test.

1142
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,200
I am DJ Shinda.

1143
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,200
I am a senior kylin abroad.

1144
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,200
I am number one DJ.

1145
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,200
I am number one.

1146
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,200
Let's go.

1147
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:58,200
I am DJ Shinda.

1148
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,200
I am DJ Kojima.

1149
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,200
I am DJ Tani.

1150
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,200
Tani.

1151
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,200
Oh

1152
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:11,200
Thank you!

1153
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:39,200
How I'm twisted and deceitful, all love to face people

1154
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,200
Taking me for some kind of fool

1155
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:44,200
How I'm pretending to be so nice

1156
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:48,200
Let me give you my advice, I don't need you

1157
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:52,200
Screaming in the sky, dressed up in lights

1158
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,200
It's the neck that you're playing

1159
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,200
How I'm fresh, you recognize me

1160
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:01,200
And you criticize me, what's going on?

1161
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:04,200
Don't stop your bitching cause you're so fair

1162
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,200
Bitchin' behind my back, honey I don't need that

1163
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,200
Don't kick it to the curb because I heard you through

1164
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,200
They tryin' to get in my face

1165
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,200
I'm watchin' hard to make mistakes

1166
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,200
Don't make me stay, don't stop your vision on me

1167
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:35,200
Oh, oh, that's so narrow-minded

1168
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:38,200
But they're so unsighted, they're just counterfeit

1169
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:42,200
Oh, oh, hot and cold, you're the wind

1170
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,800
Some more clothes man, who are you tryna get?

1171
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:52,440
And, to see people, I'm so shallow, put yourself in my place

1172
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:59,240
The fairy tells you spin and sound and circle, bend, stand, but I'm at a rock

1173
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,720
So stop your bitch and catch yourself there

1174
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:05,560
Stare a bitch from behind my back, who me, I don't need that

1175
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:09,000
So kick it to the curb because I heard you through the stage

1176
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,700
Kinda scared in my head, so why too hard to make mistakes?

1177
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,700
So stop your bitchin' on me

1178
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Stop your bitchin' on me

1179
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,000
Stop your bitchin' on me

1180
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:59,920
Who's that Pokemon?

1181
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,920
It's CANDO!

1182
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:08,920
Oh, baby.

1183
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1184
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:41,920
Think about it

1185
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,920
Move on now

1186
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,920
Let your body feel the beat

1187
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,920
Come on, wake up

1188
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,920
Let our energy change and beat

1189
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,920
And in the back of your mind I smile

1190
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,920
Burning blood so bright

1191
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,920
Just reach out, he's off and out

1192
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,920
He'll be the star tonight

1193
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:10,920
Get with it

1194
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,920
Finalize

1195
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,920
You gotta chance it

1196
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:15,920
You know you should do it

1197
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,920
When you're dead, my man

1198
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,920
Pass him by

1199
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,920
And set him strong, but

1200
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:27,920
You're not the answer to keep me warm

1201
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,920
Hey, hey, hey

1202
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,920
I just believe

1203
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,920
You're gonna feel it, yeah, yeah

1204
01:31:44,920 --> 01:32:07,640
We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused

1205
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:13,800
people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.

1206
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:17,800
a friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

1207
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:20,800
That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1208
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,800
We're here until 9 o'clock tonight.

1209
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,800
And I'm going to turn it over to Paul.

1210
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,800
Paul likes to do a little segment every week here, when he's here,

1211
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,800
where he's going to wrap up what's going on on the local message boards,

1212
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:33,800
local and abroad.

1213
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,800
Whatever message board he wants to talk about, he's giving us the wrap-up.

1214
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:36,800
So go for it, Paul.

1215
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,800
I have to give you some music, though.

1216
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:50,800
Well, um, on the second money board we were a little active in, oh great, in growing up, but you're obese.

1217
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:58,800
On the second money we've been going over and talking about, after our crazy smoking break, we were just saying, you know, how much stuff happened to the smoke out of it in the game.

1218
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,800
Now since it's been us helping out, and we've decided that we're going to do a letter together.

1219
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:08,800
Jessica, the iguana girl, has gotten to do a draft together, and we're going to go over it,

1220
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,800
and form a letter together, and I'll send it in, and talk about that on tour.

1221
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:17,800
And so the discussion is just going on.

1222
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:21,800
You know, some people still can't post in the right introductory thread and everything else.

1223
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,800
That's just a little concerned.

1224
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,800
You've got to get that mic a little closer to your mouth, Paul.

1225
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,800
you're going to shove it all in your mouth and take it all at once.

1226
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,800
Take it all.

1227
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,800
I'm just going to blow that whistle.

1228
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,800
I'm just glad that we've been actually getting something together after complaining for so long.

1229
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:34,800
I thought we'd just note that.

1230
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,800
Anyone who's interested should talk to people about that.

1231
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,800
Any other boards you want to give us a lowdown on?

1232
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,800
You know, not much has been happening too much.

1233
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,800
A lot of boards have slowed down just because people have been divided,

1234
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,800
and I haven't been on DDR free for a long time.

1235
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,800
Same old, same old on DDR free.

1236
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:51,800
Alright, so that's a wrap up.

1237
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:52,800
Same old shit.

1238
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,800
Hooray.

1239
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,800
Thank you, Paul.

1240
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,900
machines with the help of local law enforcement.

1241
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:32,560
I'm sure I know what site they'll be looking at to find out where these machines are located.

1242
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:33,560
Thoughts?

1243
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:34,560
People?

1244
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,600
Well, first of all, I'd like to actually read that press release, is there a link on there?

1245
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,600
There is not!

1246
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,600
What do you know?

1247
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,600
Hmmm, makes one think.

1248
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:49,600
You know, if someone's going to put up a rumor of that magnitude, the only way I would believe

1249
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:54,720
it is either one, seeing the press release or two, having it posted by KOA on the board.

1250
01:34:54,720 --> 01:35:01,720
So, until I have legitimate proof, I call that a big pile of sticky poo.

1251
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:04,720
Let's see what people are saying about that.

1252
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,720
BS, BS, BS, BS, BS, BS.

1253
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:09,720
Pretty much everybody says that's BS.

1254
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,720
That they're going to be wasting their time and stuff.

1255
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:16,720
They're claiming that Konami of America is going to make an announcement tomorrow.

1256
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,720
So, I guess we'll see.

1257
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,720
We'll see if there's any truth to that rumor.

1258
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:21,720
We'll see if miracles will ever start.

1259
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,720
That's right.

1260
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:23,720
That's right.

1261
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:28,840
Have you seen how many people in green shirts are going around Golf Land now with the racetrack

1262
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:29,840
and stuff?

1263
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,840
They have an evil army.

1264
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,120
There's no way anything's getting out of there.

1265
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:36,520
Would you tie yourself to the DDR machine if it was going to be taken away?

1266
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:39,680
Tying, you know?

1267
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,400
I think I'd just stick with the guitar freaks then.

1268
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:45,240
If people would be distracted, no one would be playing, I could get a few games in, it'd

1269
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,240
be alright.

1270
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:49,520
I'd like to see how they're going to actually pull this off.

1271
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:56,360
How many machines do we have in California alone, let alone the whole United States?

1272
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:59,160
What the hell are they going to do with those, turn them into the USA mixes?

1273
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:02,800
And they can't read the machine locations page on DDR Freak with their tiny Asian eyes,

1274
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,520
so I don't know how this is going to work out.

1275
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,520
That's wrong.

1276
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,520
That's wrong.

1277
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:15,080
But no, if they're going to do that for Guitar Freaks in Dramania, why not do it for DDR2?

1278
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:20,000
Why not go get all those pop music machines, all five of them that we have in the country,

1279
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:25,560
or you know, go hunt down dance maniacs, or the like, or you know, go get the Korean machines.

1280
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,880
Why not, you know, hit them too?

1281
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:28,880
Quick!

1282
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,880
They're coming!

1283
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:30,880
Get the Macs too and run!

1284
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:35,080
You had something you wanted to add, Matt?

1285
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:36,080
No?

1286
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,080
Okay, never mind.

1287
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:41,040
Pretty much we're being told in the chat room, they pretty much agree that it seems to sound

1288
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,080
like a bunch of BS to you guys.

1289
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,080
It's poopy!

1290
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:50,080
Oh, Dark Tetsuya's offering, though. If anybody wants to come play the Max 3 beta at his house before the cops take it away, hahaha.

1291
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,080
Dude, I'm there.

1292
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,080
This is for you, Dark Tetsuya.

1293
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,080
Alright.

1294
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:59,080
That sound will never get old for me, I'm sorry.

1295
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:07,080
I'm trying to read the chat room here.

1296
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:14,120
Yes, we are being given this flood of information in text format on our lovely...

1297
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:18,600
So we don't know what's happening with all that Konami of America stuff, but I'm sure

1298
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:24,320
that if things get too out of hand, Jason Enos will make a post and tell us all what's

1299
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,320
going on.

1300
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,800
And in fact, I would really like to get an interview with him, and that's something I'm

1301
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,720
aiming for with a future show.

1302
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:35,440
Speaking of future shows, in two weeks on this show, on the 28th, there's about a 50-50

1303
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:38,940
chance we're going to have a very special guest, two very special guests here that night.

1304
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:42,080
I can't say who because it's not confirmed yet, but you'll definitely want to tune in

1305
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:46,480
to that show in two weeks. We'll hopefully have somebody who knows Jamie and I very,

1306
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:53,140
very well, who's sure to bring up a lot of dirt on us, and a very famous freestyler also

1307
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:54,140
should be here.

1308
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:58,100
Rob, you sound like you're actually promoting our show. What's up with that?

1309
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:59,280
I know, what's up with that?

1310
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,100
It's because our show rules.

1311
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,100
We own.

1312
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:07,100
That'll be a good show, if we get it. As soon as I get it confirmed, we'll bring it up.

1313
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:09,100
I'll let you know who's coming.

1314
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:12,100
One little point, if you don't mind me going back to the Guitar Freak show or anything.

1315
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,100
Sure.

1316
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:17,100
If anybody happens to see anything about that, go ahead and feel free to email me.

1317
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:23,100
My email address is darksakra.aol.com, so go ahead and send me information if you find anything.

1318
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:25,100
Alrighty.

1319
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:28,100
Everybody knows my email address anyway, I don't know.

1320
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:30,100
Your email address is accessible on the website.

1321
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:35,260
All the porn people just love to send me stuff.

1322
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:37,320
Okay, um...

1323
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:41,180
Let's see, what other topics do I have written down here for things we can do?

1324
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:42,300
Hearing? Oh!

1325
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:44,200
We have a hold.

1326
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,940
Wait one second.

1327
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:47,980
Alright.

1328
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:50,940
Let me pass the mic over.

1329
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:56,060
Alright, I'm just reading this off of Konami of America's site, totally unrelated to what we were just talking about here.

1330
01:38:56,060 --> 01:39:02,100
uh... is talking about that this guy john benson and word evans are uh...

1331
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:06,180
the air fanatics their creators of dance machine a short film about the world's

1332
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:07,600
biggest cdr fan

1333
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:12,460
the movie one can that coveted clam d or two thousand two clinton's film fest

1334
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:14,260
but when i'm down

1335
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:16,220
in newport rhode island

1336
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:17,260
so uh...

1337
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:21,020
hopefully we'll never see that on video you-know-what if we have a ddr movie

1338
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:23,700
i have a real good idea for this

1339
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:27,700
People have been making DDR players, celebrities, and stuff.

1340
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:30,700
I know Corey's in the chat room and he's been getting some of that.

1341
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:31,700
You know Corey's screen name?

1342
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:32,700
I want to talk to Corey.

1343
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,700
People like that.

1344
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:37,700
And so I think that as anyone like Mike, people have heard about this movie.

1345
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:41,700
A little kid finds his shoes, becomes like Michael Jordan, starts dunking on everybody,

1346
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:42,700
gets in the NBA.

1347
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:46,700
I want someone to find maybe Corey's old underpants.

1348
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:47,700
They'll say Corey on the name tag.

1349
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:48,700
He'll put them on.

1350
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:52,700
Please make me like Corey and he'll come to the PA competition, maybe the triple threat.

1351
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:56,500
You know, he started owning everyone, this little scrub that everyone sees playing USA,

1352
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:59,300
and just kills everyone, and it's a whole new phenomenon.

1353
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:03,100
And then he finds out, you know, the underwear wasn't what it is, it was the magic inside.

1354
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:03,900
I think that would make a good...

1355
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:04,500
Do you remember that old...

1356
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,300
Put down the pipe, Jesus.

1357
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:09,400
Do you remember that old business, though, about DDR Freak the movie?

1358
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:09,700
Yes.

1359
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:14,800
With all the scripts that floated around that made it into this, this utter, you know, crappy teeny movie?

1360
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,100
Uh-huh.

1361
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:18,600
That would have just been, that would have been boycotting that.

1362
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:22,400
I will say this on the show right now, something I haven't told anybody.

1363
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:28,400
I'm writing a screenplay that involves DDR heavily, that's all I'll say.

1364
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:31,400
Oh, we have another guest who just walked into the room.

1365
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,400
We have Bongo!

1366
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,400
Bongo demands us.

1367
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:35,400
Introduce yourself, new guest.

1368
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,400
What is Bongo, or is my other...

1369
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,400
That's your other, that's your real self.

1370
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,400
Hi, Ryan.

1371
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:44,400
Yay, SDM.

1372
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,400
I have a bit of a problem with that.

1373
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:51,400
The big gay perilous.

1374
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:58,400
Oh, great. Now I'm forever known as the absolutely gay cross-dresser.

1375
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:03,400
Hey, Matt, bring up the official site for that movie thing. Are you trying to do that?

1376
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,400
They have a click here.

1377
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:13,400
One person in the chat room says they did see it and they didn't like it, so your first review is a big thumbs down.

1378
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:19,400
The DDR movie about the biggest DDR fan that won the clam dance award.

1379
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:27,800
there's a movie it's what John and ward.com will bring it up I'm even more

1380
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:33,760
alarmed that as opposed to there being a movie there's a clam dance I know that

1381
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,160
I think that's the big news here not that there's a movie out but there's a

1382
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:43,680
big you know like lesbian gathering you know you know what that bring you know

1383
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:49,240
it brings to mind a clam dance festival that's what brings to mind was that the

1384
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:49,240
sound of a dying mutant clam? A clam opening up.

1385
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:59,240
Would you have the signal? Beat like a dying camel.

1386
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:04,240
We're going to take a real fast break and we're going to come back and wrap up the show because we don't have much time left.

1387
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:07,880
So stay with us, we're going to take a real quick break, we'll be right back.

1388
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:51,840
We like to be after the behavior What you doin' over there?

1389
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,840
Come on, let's do this really well

1390
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,640
People are feelin' afraid of scooby mergers

1391
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:56,640
Don't know what to do

1392
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:57,940
Hey, what you got in your hand?

1393
01:42:57,940 --> 01:42:58,740
Man, it's amazing

1394
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:00,040
Put it away, it's gonna go bang

1395
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,240
Blow my brain, ha

1396
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:02,740
I'm gonna call someone insane

1397
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:04,340
With an ass, a seed, axe

1398
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:06,340
So, let's leave this nigga today

1399
01:43:06,340 --> 01:43:07,640
Just for the sake of your love

1400
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:09,240
Make sure to laugh and express your gaze

1401
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,940
Just our vote, you gon' say, say

1402
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:12,940
Cut the drugs, cut the drugs

1403
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:25,880
I feel you, I feel you, I feel you everywhere I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every night

1404
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:02,880
I'm leaving, I'm leaving

1405
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:07,880
I can't help it, I'm a little too old for life

1406
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:13,880
I'm taking my time, I'm taking my time

1407
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:19,880
You can't come alive, you can't come through the light

1408
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:36,880
You gotta keep it bad, keep it living

1409
01:46:36,880 --> 01:47:05,680
and now it's time for

1410
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:10,600
Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite

1411
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:13,280
perverse baumanni band, Erotic.

1412
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,680
Do it all night. Do it with me.

1413
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:20,980
No, no! That was awful! Bloody terrible! Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher!

1414
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:22,480
In the heat of the night.

1415
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,180
Oh, God! I think my ears are bleeding!

1416
01:47:25,180 --> 01:47:26,980
I liked it!

1417
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:29,680
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula! Next!

1418
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:33,880
Umm... that was cool.

1419
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:38,880
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic! Next!

1420
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:46,880
Yes! Yes, that's it! We have a winner!

1421
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,880
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1422
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:53,880
Yes, a star is born every second.

1423
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:58,880
A star being born over there on the other computer in the house.

1424
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:02,120
in the house. We were watching that short movie that we were referencing earlier. What

1425
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:07,700
is the name of that, Matt? It's called Dance Machine, and I just posted the link up there

1426
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:10,920
in the chat room. Those of you that aren't in the chat room, go ahead and join us. It's

1427
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:17,800
not too late. Over on, just join the server, IRC.eggheads.org, and we're in Channel Orange

1428
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:18,800
Lounge.

1429
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:22,820
Dance Machine has also proved that while every moment a star is born, every moment a star

1430
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:26,340
explodes too.

1431
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:31,340
Never have I felt more sorry for mid-aged men who think that they're young.

1432
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:34,340
I've never seen a guy that old playing DDR. That's amazing.

1433
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:37,340
And there's Kobe. There's always Kobe.

1434
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:39,340
And Nick Nolte owns a DDR machine.

1435
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:40,340
That's true. That's true.

1436
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:43,340
Nick Nolte owns one and he takes lots of vitamins too.

1437
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:47,340
Yeah, but Nick Nolte didn't win, you know, Best Comedy and Alice's Clam Dance Award.

1438
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:51,340
He didn't win the Clam Dance Award in San Francisco, okay?

1439
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:54,340
But the Clam Dance Award is a lesbian award.

1440
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:57,220
So is he like, you know, is it kind of like Flashdance?

1441
01:48:57,220 --> 01:49:01,700
What a feeling, wack, wack.

1442
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:04,260
It's always better with fans.

1443
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:06,460
And that's the quote of Ryan for the evening.

1444
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:08,780
Also, during that break, I took a chance

1445
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:11,460
to look at the newly remodeled 2DX style,

1446
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:12,900
and I give it my seal of approval.

1447
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:13,500
It's very pretty.

1448
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:14,900
They have a little pretty opening movie

1449
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:17,660
when you go into the site, and it's it's all nicely remodeled.

1450
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:19,060
So do pay that a visit.

1451
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:20,660
And that's linked from our links page.

1452
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:21,900
If you want to check that out.

1453
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:24,300
2DX style gets the kudos of the evening.

1454
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:27,180
We'll go buy you a candy bar, Cory.

1455
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:29,540
And also Three Feet Elite, who is the puppeteer.

1456
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:34,620
I will go buy a box of kudos and deliver them to you.

1457
01:49:34,620 --> 01:49:35,620
They can split it.

1458
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:36,620
They're tasty.

1459
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:39,500
They have some nice forums over there, also.

1460
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:40,500
Do you think the DDR community...

1461
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:41,740
This is a question I've been wanting to ask for a while.

1462
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:44,060
Do you think the DDR community is too saturated with forums?

1463
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:46,180
Do you think there's too many?

1464
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:47,180
Never been too many.

1465
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:51,060
I mean, each one of them has their own feel, and it's like you get that weird little trippy

1466
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:58,060
maybe sends a family there. Except, say, DDR Freak is the big extended family that's supposed

1467
01:49:58,660 --> 01:49:59,900
to cover everything.

1468
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:02,220
With lots of interesting children.

1469
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:07,480
Yeah, you know, you have that family, maybe a little more to the south. And the uncles

1470
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:11,480
you don't talk to much. You know, the uncles you don't talk to, they're kind of crazy.

1471
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:14,080
They don't speak good English.

1472
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:18,500
And Sacramani's just like, yay, we're happy, don't flame on people, whee!

1473
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:20,500
That's because we love everybody!

1474
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:57,260
As far as for one purpose, it's hard to get used to that, even Ryan.

1475
01:50:57,260 --> 01:51:00,700
The alternate board used to be GDCon and people would talk about that and go on there eventually.

1476
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:04,700
That sort of got split between that and MonkeysFly and other network because things would happen

1477
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:08,460
and now neither of those boards get much activity so it's better to have, I think, stuff centered

1478
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:09,460
in one place.

1479
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:14,780
Not too much because DDR Freak does have a little, it's sort of overflowing with activity.

1480
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:15,780
It's hard to handle.

1481
01:51:15,780 --> 01:51:19,100
the big, big city, but then it's also good to have a couple of little suburbs too that

1482
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:20,100
are fun.

1483
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:23,620
My observation with the GD Coon forums is that a lot of people who were, you know, sort

1484
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:28,200
of booted from DDR Freak ended up there too, but you know, it was, it was still another

1485
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:29,200
place that got it.

1486
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:35,280
The big thing I like about, about having such a wide selection of forums is that, you know,

1487
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:40,740
you can see how their community works, you know, each one of them has their own feel,

1488
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:44,380
you know, you have the one that's a little bit more irreverent, you have your other that's

1489
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:45,380
It's more sort of all-encompassing.

1490
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:46,380
DDR Freak, I think, is more all-encompassing.

1491
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:50,700
I really, really like that.

1492
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:55,740
We have our little happy inbred family at Saqdumani.

1493
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:57,220
Okay.

1494
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:59,140
No.

1495
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:03,140
We have, I think, we're really getting that good sense of community.

1496
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:07,900
I'm really, at least, hoping that a lot of the good feelings from back in the old days

1497
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:09,380
come back.

1498
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:11,220
And we talk about porn there, too.

1499
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:12,540
Yes, we talk about porn.

1500
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:14,220
We have our own hentai thread, thank you.

1501
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:18,300
and we're all going to YALIcon.

1502
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:21,200
I'm not going to YALIcon. I don't know what you people are smoking with all the games.

1503
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:25,420
You're coming to YALIcon. We're making you dress up. We're making you cosplay.

1504
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:28,700
Alright, alright. You get to wear the frilly black lace.

1505
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:32,860
So we like we like lots of different forums. It's cool to have a lot of

1506
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:34,620
different forums. Kind of everybody has their own

1507
01:52:34,620 --> 01:52:37,980
different personality and you just choose to hang out with the people you want to.

1508
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:41,540
One other topic I wanted to bring up

1509
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:46,660
Hearing DDR songs in interesting places, I don't necessarily mean on the radio, but do

1510
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:50,860
you guys ever hear like DDR songs in very strange places, places you didn't expect to

1511
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:51,860
hear them at?

1512
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:56,080
Like, for once, I picked up this CD this week that just happened to have Ordinary World

1513
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,080
on it.

1514
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:58,080
It was very odd.

1515
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,860
It was like this trance compilation CD, and then all of a sudden there was Ordinary World.

1516
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:00,860
It's like, wow.

1517
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:01,860
DDR in my nightmares.

1518
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:05,340
This DJ at one of my school dances was playing all this bad techno music, and all of a sudden

1519
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:08,500
Stomp to My Beat comes up, and that's very distinctive.

1520
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,740
We went over this before, but Stomp to My...

1521
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:13,180
Why is everyone shoving two microphones in my face?

1522
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:16,420
Like I get one and Jamie's like, here, here, take it, take it.

1523
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:17,420
Get the dual voice effect.

1524
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:20,180
We were all at Brookfield and then I stomped my beat from the kitchen.

1525
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:21,180
Yeah.

1526
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:24,840
And um, but we went over this a while ago and yeah, stomped my beat.

1527
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:30,060
I've heard it a while, but I think that I've listened to DDR music so much that whenever

1528
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:35,740
I think I hear something, I have to take like a second listen to it because I'm not sure

1529
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:40,660
if it's just my mind playing kicks on me because now I've listened to so much and some of the

1530
01:53:40,660 --> 01:53:45,000
stuff sounds so similar, I'm listening to Dropout and it sounds like, yeah, I'm dead

1531
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,800
around or something like that. It just doesn't compute. I've listened to so much.

1532
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:53,380
I think it's getting more annoying on the idea that, you know, you listen to the radio

1533
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:57,500
and some of this DDR stuff comes on, or you have a CD where you're listening to DDR stuff

1534
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:01,060
comes on. You don't know which is getting pulled from which, because I know Stomp to

1535
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:05,940
My Beat was a pretty popular techno song before it got pulled into DDR, so I'm wondering if

1536
01:54:05,940 --> 01:54:08,740
more isn't coming along those lines.

1537
01:54:08,740 --> 01:54:13,220
It's also sad that with some of us being the ages that we are, that we actually remember

1538
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:14,820
the original songs they were.

1539
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:23,220
I remember the original, Sky High, that was redone by DJ Mikko.

1540
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:26,900
Even being an anime fan, I will sit and listen to freckles and the Japanese lyrics, like

1541
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:31,660
the opening Toru Roni Kenshin goes in my head, and the original Hot Limit by TM Revolution,

1542
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:35,620
which by the way, everybody should listen to because it's awesome.

1543
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:37,940
I had the weirdest thing happen.

1544
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:43,980
I was watching MTV for like the once in like the last two years and I heard oops I did

1545
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:44,980
it again.

1546
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:49,980
It's so weird that they ripped off like DDR fifth next to me because I have no idea why.

1547
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:53,900
I mean, it's just like, whoa.

1548
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:56,620
Yeah, oops he did it again.

1549
01:54:56,620 --> 01:54:58,940
Hey, that song is cool.

1550
01:54:58,940 --> 01:54:59,940
You know.

1551
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:00,940
Anyway.

1552
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:06,620
It's, it's just, you know, I think that not only are our lives, I guess influenced by

1553
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:13,340
Bamani, but Bamani is influenced by the way that the world has been too. The music has

1554
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:18,940
evolved and it's evolved with people's taste, it evolves with the times and that's another

1555
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:23,660
really cool thing is that you're more likely now to hear something that's been in a Bamani

1556
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:24,660
game.

1557
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:28,580
Do you think it's just like when we hear Bamani songs on CDs, places we didn't expect it to?

1558
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:33,240
Do you think it's like we kind of feel like, hey, this is our game and this is our pastime

1559
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:36,460
and it's kind of like wow it's kind of funny it's like the rest of the world's

1560
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:40,020
kind of in on the secret too is it? Well I think actually it's more like you know

1561
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:44,220
like remember watching He-Man and She-Ra back when you were little it was a tool

1562
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:49,460
to sell the toys. They made me pay money as a tool to sell Dance Mania CDs who

1563
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:59,100
knows. Like the Mattel Chocobot Hour. Yeah. Any other comments? All right I think

1564
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:02,180
we're gonna wrap up the show here um thanks to everybody for listening we

1565
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:05,060
I've got a really good turnout tonight, thank you everybody in the chatroom, I hope you

1566
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:09,460
join us every Sunday night from 7pm until 9pm.

1567
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:13,260
Also we're going to start doing rebroadcasts on Monday night, so we're going to do rebroadcasts

1568
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:17,860
Monday night at 7 o'clock, you can hear all of tonight's show, and then at 9 o'clock we

1569
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:19,760
bring you a classic show.

1570
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:24,220
So we're going to go ahead and replay the first episode this week for those that missed

1571
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:25,220
it.

1572
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:29,660
I'd like to thank all of my friends who said that they'd be listening in tonight, and for

1573
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:33,620
for our two listeners in Japan, and for...

1574
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:35,420
We have listeners in Japan?

1575
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:37,060
Yes, we have listeners in Japan.

1576
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:39,900
I would like to thank our listeners on the East Coast,

1577
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:43,220
West Coast, South Coast, Gulf Coast,

1578
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:44,780
whatever coast there happens to be,

1579
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:46,260
the coast in your own mind.

1580
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:47,820
And again, do join in.

1581
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:52,340
Visit our website at orangelounge.skie.cx

1582
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:54,540
and get all the information on our station.

1583
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:56,660
And when this live talk program isn't on the air,

1584
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:59,300
do tune into our Bomani Music & More program

1585
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:05,440
runs 24 hours a day on this dial-up stream. We've got all sorts of music, 2DX, DDR, everything

1586
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:11,700
including dance mania and other music games. So now, Rob, are we going to be adding that

1587
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:19,700
list of songs we would like to hear in Bimani? A couple weeks ago we were talking about the

1588
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:24,220
songs that we think should be in Bimani that aren't yet. Yeah, some of those songs do show

1589
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:28,700
up. Jamie and I put in a pickle week on the music stuff and we'll be adding some of the

1590
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:32,100
stuff that was talked about that show also. Who knows, perhaps we could make that a contest

1591
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:36,940
for the future, you know. And yeah, if you guys want to send us email, it's orangeloungeradio,

1592
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:41,520
that's all one word, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com. Your suggestions for music you

1593
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:45,900
think should be on the station, even if it's not in a mamati game, if it should be, why?

1594
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:48,900
Let us know and then tell us. Send us a sound clip of your voice, say who you are and what

1595
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:54,240
you think should be in, you know. You might find yourself a local celebrity. You got it.

1596
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:58,560
So thanks everybody for listening, and we'll see you next Sunday.

1597
01:57:58,560 --> 01:57:59,560
I guess that's about it.

1598
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:01,520
Anybody else have any closing words they want to say?

1599
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:04,720
Thanks all of you for being here, Ryan, even though you were only here 15 minutes.

1600
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:05,720
Thanks everyone else.

1601
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:08,000
But hey, he's here, and that's the important part.

1602
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
That's right.

1603
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,420
He's into Orange Lounge, Bongo demands it!

1604
01:58:11,420 --> 01:58:16,160
I think that only one cuss word was said this entire show.

1605
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:17,160
And I said it, I think.

1606
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:19,640
Will you care to remedy that situation then, Dave?

1607
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:20,640
Uh, no.
