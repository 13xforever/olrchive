[SPEAKER_16]: Stop calling here.

00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:48,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't it 4215, Pussy Wayne?

7
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,550
[SPEAKER_16]: You bitch!

8
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Now let me check the zip code.

00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:52,591
[SPEAKER_12]: 212, fuck you!

10
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:54,092
[SPEAKER_10]: You have no morals, darling.

11
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:58,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching case of herpes.

12
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:01,595
[SPEAKER_21]: Kiss my grip, nooch.

13
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:03,956
[SPEAKER_21]: Mecca lecca hi, mecca hi-dee-ho.

14
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:06,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.

15
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:07,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too!

16
00:01:07,497 --> 00:01:08,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucker, yeah?

17
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:10,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm working on it.

18
00:01:10,158 --> 00:01:10,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Loser.

19
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:11,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Lame!

20
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,179
[SPEAKER_10]: On the side of my face.

21
00:01:14,187 --> 00:01:26,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut While I go listen to my Britney Spears records I am your singing telegram

22
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:38,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

23
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:42,661
[SPEAKER_04]: You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.

24
00:01:42,982 --> 00:01:44,983
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

25
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:49,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

26
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:50,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back!

27
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:53,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm back, and I'm sad.

28
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:56,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I am 100% glad to be back.

29
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,580
[SPEAKER_11]: The trip was interesting to say the least.

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,482
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll definitely get into that a little bit more later, right Jamie?

31
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:02,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yes!

32
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:02,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

33
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:07,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is episode number 4 for July the 14th of 2002.

34
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:10,148
[SPEAKER_04]: We are joined in studio once again by many, many, many guests.

35
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,973
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Matt, Dave, and Paul's here in the house.

36
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:16,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um...

37
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:22,131
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be talking to all of them a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a real quick break.

38
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:23,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other opening thoughts from you?

39
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:25,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you say I get to break stuff?

40
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:26,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, if you want.

41
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:28,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Just not anything I own.

42
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,175
[SPEAKER_04]: You can break my roommate's stuff, though.

43
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:29,696
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on vacation.

44
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:30,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, cool.

45
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'll just break this thing over here.

46
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:33,738
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sounds good.

47
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to start off this first break with a request here.

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a couple requests in our chat room.

49
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:40,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you go ahead and join our chat room if you want to.

50
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:42,284
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to join irc.akeheads.org.

51
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:49,686
[SPEAKER_04]: or any other side IRC chat server.

52
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:53,307
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them would be also karma.othersideirc.net.

53
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:55,668
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're just in Channel Pound Orange Lounge.

54
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:56,588
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that easy.

55
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:58,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a few requests in here.

56
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:01,629
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start it off with from 2DX7Style.

57
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,710
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Dumond with Never Look Back.

58
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:36,564
Thanks for watching!

59
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:39,687
Blow my whistle baby!

60
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:40,790
Blow my whistle baby!

61
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:19,016
[SPEAKER_15]: And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

62
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:20,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it all night.

63
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:21,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it with me.

64
00:08:21,897 --> 00:08:23,318
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, that was awful.

65
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Bloody terrible.

66
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:25,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you take vocal lessons?

67
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Kill your teacher.

68
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:28,181
[SPEAKER_17]: In the heat of the night.

69
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

70
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:32,704
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked it.

71
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:34,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

72
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:35,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Next.

73
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:39,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, that was cool.

74
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:42,744
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you even know why you're here?

75
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:44,505
[SPEAKER_19]: That was just bloody pathetic.

76
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:45,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Next!

77
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on, do it with me.

78
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:51,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, yes, that's it!

79
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:53,108
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a winner!

80
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:57,670
[SPEAKER_15]: A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

81
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:01,402
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

82
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:06,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, they were saying that the old promos were getting a little old, so we had to make that new one before the show started tonight.

83
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:10,076
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, now we have new old promos to play the hell out with here.

84
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:14,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty, a big hello to everybody, by the way, tonight in our chatroom.

85
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,703
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a pretty crowded chatroom there tonight, so thanks everybody for listening in.

86
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:21,146
[SPEAKER_04]: And those last few songs were for some people that were listening in the chatroom.

87
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,388
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Don't Look Back and The Whistle Song were both requested.

88
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:27,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And I threw Jet Ningen in there too, because I know a lot of people like that one.

89
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:29,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Paul, for that lovely hooray.

90
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we have a hooray from the background.

91
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:33,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of The Whistle Song.

92
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:35,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

93
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:39,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally think it's the most interesting song in Max 2 out of anything.

94
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the one that probably got the biggest reaction in the chatroom.

95
00:09:41,428 --> 00:09:43,490
[SPEAKER_04]: People going, oh yeah, I really want to hear this song.

96
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

97
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:49,236
[SPEAKER_04]: It just really kind of gets in your mind and just messes with you to like, I hate this song.

98
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:51,138
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the scrubbiest song on the face of the earth.

99
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:53,801
[SPEAKER_04]: When people play this in the arcade, they sing along to it.

100
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:55,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to kill myself.

101
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,001
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it about the whistle song?

102
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:08,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It was weird because when it first came out, you know, when Max 2 News was first coming out, people said, oh, that song is going to be the most overplayed Max 2 song because it has the word bitch in it.

103
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we find out they censored bitch and it just says baby.

104
00:10:10,992 --> 00:10:13,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, unless, you know, you're looking at the banner, but whatever.

105
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:14,816
[SPEAKER_04]: It says baby in the actual song.

106
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:18,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are afraid to play it because they don't want to play it out, right?

107
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:19,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

108
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

109
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:23,742
[SPEAKER_06]: They all play Suguru.

110
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:27,144
[SPEAKER_21]: They all play Suguru, which is not even as good as the song.

111
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:30,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So then they, instead they play Suguru and play that out.

112
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:40,350
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, then it's like all of a sudden somebody actually plays the whistle song and now it's like, oh, people are playing this and it's pretty cool and now the whistle song's a cool song, but now it's getting overplayed again.

113
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,071
[SPEAKER_11]: It's frustratingly catchy, that's the thing.

114
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:44,372
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just infectious.

115
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:46,213
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets in my mind and it never gets out.

116
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,655
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels like burning.

117
00:10:52,057 --> 00:11:00,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other interesting songs that you just kind of totally changed your opinion on in DDR?

118
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:02,366
[SPEAKER_11]: An old school song, but love that feeling.

119
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:03,607
[SPEAKER_04]: By Changmo?

120
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,029
[SPEAKER_11]: I hated that song.

121
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:06,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody hated that song.

122
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,574
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it kept coming up on my non-stops on my lovely Dreamcast edition, so I learned to like it.

123
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,236
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I was the only one who did.

124
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:14,286
[SPEAKER_04]: and right on.

125
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:31,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Later on tonight we're going to be doing our very own version of Listless here and we are going to be determining the worst Bomani song in history next to Let Them Move because Let Them Move it's already given that wins it's the worst Bomani song in history we're going to determine the number two second worst Bomani song in history tonight.

126
00:11:32,153 --> 00:11:35,740
[SPEAKER_11]: It was officially the lowest on that list on that old survey that went on DDR Freak.

127
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you remember that?

128
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:37,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it?

129
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:39,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that it was Have You Never Been Mellow.

130
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:40,068
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

131
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:43,694
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Have You Never Been Mellow was ranked a good bit higher than Let Them Move.

132
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:44,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

133
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Machine wasn't even number one.

134
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:57,534
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, see, Have You Never Been Mellow is cool because it was made just to spin around the whole time on the maniac steps.

135
00:11:57,574 --> 00:12:00,897
[SPEAKER_21]: You can spin the entire thing, and it's pretty fun.

136
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:04,359
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you go try to step off the stage, and you fall on your ass.

137
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:04,979
[SPEAKER_21]: It's funny.

138
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was Butterfly, where you just go spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.

139
00:12:10,983 --> 00:12:12,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Butterfly has a few chops in it.

140
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:13,905
[SPEAKER_03]: It can get a little scary.

141
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:19,149
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's been done, you know, I don't think anyone can top what's been, it's a classic.

142
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there will ever be a great butterfly routine from here on out?

143
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:28,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think anybody, do you think anybody has the balls to do butterfly anymore?

144
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:29,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's just ask Kyle Snyder.

145
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody can do butterfly better than Kyle Snyder.

146
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:39,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I put out a challenge, I want to see a fucking great, either butterfly or boom boom dollar.

147
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:41,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Like somebody needs to just get old school and blow us all away.

148
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:50,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw one video, I don't remember, I believe it was off Music Gaming Zone.

149
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:54,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It was these two Korean guys doing Boom Boom Dollar, and it was pretty awesome.

150
00:12:54,976 --> 00:13:02,065
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've seen a lot of crappy routines from Boom Boom Dollar, but that was probably the only one that actually stood out in my mind as being good.

151
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:05,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat room does seem to agree here.

152
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:08,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Snyder owned Butterfly, and that's it.

153
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:09,089
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

154
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:14,151
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's two songs he owns, because isn't he the king of Trip Machine Jungle or something like that, too?

155
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,671
[SPEAKER_11]: He is the butterfly, no Kami-sama.

156
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:16,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

157
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:22,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And, oh, Corey, okay, Corey, we have Virtue in the chat room, and he says at CVGL next Saturday he will do it.

158
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:26,126
[SPEAKER_11]: I will totally be there to see that.

159
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:28,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's as good as the Burning Heat routine, Gloria.

160
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:29,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to say.

161
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'm going to make it to CVGL, unfortunately.

162
00:13:33,453 --> 00:13:34,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I might be there.

163
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:40,439
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're hoping, and this is something we want to do in the future, we're going to be taking our little kit out remote.

164
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,180
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some remote tape stuff.

165
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:45,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to do some interviews out and about at some different tournaments and things.

166
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:47,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll be bringing them back to the show and playing them all for you.

167
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:49,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully Jamie can get out there.

168
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:52,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see who wants to give Jamie a lift.

169
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm taking donations now.

170
00:13:55,861 --> 00:14:03,045
[SPEAKER_04]: If I go, I will definitely take you, but I do have Under Sedation Live on Saturday night, which I committed to, so I'd have to run back early just so I can make that show.

171
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:05,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

172
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:11,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we get into Jamie's FU of the Week, because a lot of what we want to talk about today revolves around Jamie's FU of the Week.

173
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:23,723
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am going to turn it over to Jamie, and she's going to give us, like she does every week, we've had to fill in for her the past few weeks because she's been gone, but she has an FU of the Week every week, and so Jamie, tell us your FU of the Week.

174
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:28,307
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU of the Week has to do with Anime Expo.

175
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:29,749
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all...

176
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:35,735
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going expecting to see some new anime, something that I hadn't seen before.

177
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:39,277
[SPEAKER_11]: They played the same crap that you can buy at Suncoast.

178
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:44,859
[SPEAKER_11]: This is stuff that I've either already had for months or a couple stuff for years.

179
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,865
[SPEAKER_11]: and it was all just this commercial crap.

180
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:53,970
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I go in the dealer's room, okay, last year I was so excited, I was going to make Jungle, buy a bunch of laser discs, $5 a game.

181
00:14:54,431 --> 00:15:02,258
[SPEAKER_11]: They had like five laser discs that were $5, all the rest were $30, $40, which is still good for a laser disc, but still, you know, I want my $5 laser disc.

182
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:04,620
[SPEAKER_11]: I walked out of AX last year with 20 laser discs.

183
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,401
[SPEAKER_11]: This year, not a win.

184
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:12,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I did get this really cool little Initial D racing car thingy that's like the size of my thumb.

185
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:13,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that is very cool.

186
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:14,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's adorable.

187
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:16,765
[SPEAKER_04]: That almost makes the whole trip worth it right there.

188
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:23,508
[SPEAKER_11]: I've decided that I'm officially going to get a 1983 Toyota Corolla hatchback and paint it up like the Initial D car.

189
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:27,469
[SPEAKER_11]: They had one there, and it was adorable, and I was picturing it.

190
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,689
[SPEAKER_11]: And another thing, this is my other rant.

191
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:31,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, the cosplay was great.

192
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:36,850
[SPEAKER_11]: There were lots of people in really awesome costumes, and I found a massive angel pictuary group.

193
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,351
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was in my Mad Hatter costume, which if anybody wants to see, it looks like I'll find you pictures later.

194
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:46,552
[SPEAKER_11]: But people kept asking me if I was doing J-Rock cosplay.

195
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:49,332
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, no, I'm not from Malice Miser!

196
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:50,693
[SPEAKER_11]: No, go away, leave me alone.

197
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:52,113
[SPEAKER_11]: But I got glomped a lot, so that was cool.

198
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:55,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Do explain to all of us what a glomp is, for those that don't know.

199
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:58,596
[SPEAKER_11]: It's when people randomly run up to you and latch on to you.

200
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

201
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:05,403
[SPEAKER_11]: When you get hugged by screaming fanboys and fangirls.

202
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you get glomped when you play DDR, Dave?

203
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:12,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I get glomped by beautiful women wearing bikinis.

204
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,131
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you wake up!

205
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:17,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies love the knee drops.

206
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:21,120
[SPEAKER_11]: He breaks out as no old school A-team.

207
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:30,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, for those that don't know, is the guy that likes to play Demon Road over at Roseville Golf Land, and he likes to do the knee drops on Paranoia while he's trying to do an Oni.

208
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:31,349
[SPEAKER_11]: That is winner.

209
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:37,993
[SPEAKER_11]: What's even better is for the people who can do that and actually make it through the course.

210
00:16:39,254 --> 00:16:39,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Freestyling.

211
00:16:39,994 --> 00:16:43,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that's going to be a new trend, is freestyling the Oni courses?

212
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, what's left to do?

213
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,880
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I freestyle Waka Laka.

214
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:49,843
[SPEAKER_21]: It's hard, but you can throw in a few stuff there.

215
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:53,686
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, not much, but Paranoia definitely adds more stuff.

216
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:57,310
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, you can spin and hand plant, knee drop, all that stuff.

217
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Rad.

218
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:05,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey Dave, Virtue's challenging you in the chat room to a freestyle only.

219
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,557
[SPEAKER_21]: You better back that up.

220
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:09,919
[SPEAKER_21]: You better bring it.

221
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:21,228
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that I definitely could not even do Demon Road at all without freestyling, but with freestyling I'd make it to at most the fifth song if I really did well.

222
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I'd like to issue out a challenge of my own, too.

223
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:28,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's challenge night here on Orange Lodge.

224
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:30,249
[SPEAKER_11]: A few people already know of this challenge.

225
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, my edit is on SoCalCakes' page right now, my DXY edit another.

226
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:42,072
[SPEAKER_11]: For whoever full combos it or gets a 90% perfect attack, I will take them out to dinner.

227
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:43,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And what kind of dinner?

228
00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:45,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Who will be on the course for this lovely dinner?

229
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Sushi, of course.

230
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:51,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Or, you know, something, you know, maybe Outback.

231
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:54,208
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I got an idea.

232
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:55,709
[SPEAKER_21]: How about we go to Hometown Buffet?

233
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:57,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Hometown Buffet!

234
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:00,412
[SPEAKER_04]: The true Sacramento Cowtown way.

235
00:18:00,432 --> 00:18:01,953
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go Hometown Buffet!

236
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:03,214
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no.

237
00:18:03,414 --> 00:18:04,535
[SPEAKER_11]: We will go to JJ North.

238
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:05,096
[SPEAKER_11]: They're a little better.

239
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:06,957
[SPEAKER_11]: They're tastier.

240
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:08,758
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I live right up... I have cheesecake.

241
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:12,821
[SPEAKER_04]: The studio here is right up the street from a nice little oriental buffet.

242
00:18:13,262 --> 00:18:14,923
[SPEAKER_11]: I see Corey's comment there.

243
00:18:15,003 --> 00:18:17,385
[SPEAKER_11]: I will make sure that you get a copy of this one way or another.

244
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:19,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it is available.

245
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:24,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured out finally how to update our website all nicely, so we did update the links page today.

246
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:28,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And the very last link there leads to one of the listeners of the show, SoCalKicks.

247
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:30,473
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a nice little page there, and it has edits on it.

248
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie's edits are downloadable there.

249
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:36,837
[SPEAKER_04]: He said it might be broken, but I know he'll fix it, especially after I just plugged his site here.

250
00:18:36,877 --> 00:18:38,237
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll figure out a way to fix it now.

251
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:42,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I can also mirror those edits on SackbyMoney.com and on DarkSakura.com.

252
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,282
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have another challenge attached to my Look to the Sky edit for whoever full combos it.

253
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:49,085
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give you a GameCube pin.

254
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of edits, actually, I should start posting mine on my website there.

255
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:57,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll post that link next week or something like that.

256
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:00,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds cool.

257
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:08,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So going back to Anime Expo, there's a question I want to ask, and I think a lot of people want to know the answer to this.

258
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:18,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it that there seems to be this correlation between anime and DDR?

259
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:29,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides the obvious that they're both from Japan, I mean, that's the obvious, why is it that a lot of people, not everybody, but I'd say a good 90% of people who love DDR love anime?

260
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:38,825
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I've actually found out that a lot of the people that I used to know online through my anime channels are people that are now like kind of big in the DDR world too.

261
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:43,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Like a few people actually in Step Squad.

262
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:44,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

263
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew them online before I knew them by DDR.

264
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:51,355
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the way, hi Step Squad.

265
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:51,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

266
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:52,036
Okay.

267
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:52,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

268
00:19:53,917 --> 00:20:03,725
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also, you know, I think it was really cool that actually this is one of the coolest things about AX is that AI supplied a bunch of machines for an arcade there.

269
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:07,328
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a Max that was actually in a 1.5 cabinet.

270
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:08,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right on.

271
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:14,893
[SPEAKER_11]: They had Guitar Freaks 5th, Germania 4th, which I absolutely butchered my hands on.

272
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:19,137
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a Beatmania 3rd there, the 3rd core, Beatmania 3 core.

273
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:32,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, maybe I'm wrong here, because the chat room is telling me I've got SoCalKick saying he doesn't watch anime, Joe Mama says he watches maybe three animes, and Virtue says they're the same because it's Japo.

274
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, besides the obvious, they're both from Japan.

275
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:36,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Any comments from you guys?

276
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:39,653
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about the correlation between DDR and anime?

277
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:40,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it?

278
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:47,212
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time I watched anything that could be from Japan in cartoons was when I was in 6th grade and watched Pokemon.

279
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Ohms!

280
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:49,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

281
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:51,175
[SPEAKER_03]: That was real quality.

282
00:20:51,435 --> 00:20:58,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to see the very first movie and I was all by myself in the theater with one of my best friends, Amanda, who plays DDR in the Bay Area, some of you might know her.

283
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had so much fun.

284
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:00,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's all.

285
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:12,831
[SPEAKER_21]: I just think that some people who like DDR like anime, because lots of people who like video games are into computer nerd type people, like Matt here.

286
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:17,674
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm sure that he likes tons of stuff, because he spends hours and hours on the computer.

287
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:18,915
[SPEAKER_21]: And so it's pretty fun.

288
00:21:19,336 --> 00:21:21,177
[SPEAKER_11]: That was just the most interesting face he just made.

289
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:22,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is true.

290
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:26,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been, I don't know, 20 hours a day on the computer.

291
00:21:28,214 --> 00:21:29,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty close to that, at least.

292
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:39,298
[SPEAKER_02]: The correlation between anime and DDR, I think it's just because when people are into the Japanese pop culture, they're into everything.

293
00:21:39,418 --> 00:21:42,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Anime, the music, the video games.

294
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,040
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of all one package deal.

295
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:49,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's probably why right there is because you find a lot of crossovers with that kind of thing.

296
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:57,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it kind of like similar to the correlation between the Renaissance Faire, Star Trek, and Bondage in S&M?

297
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:08,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they all have scantily clad women in them at one point or another, so then, hey, we'll play anything with boobs.

298
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:10,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

299
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anything else you want to add on that, Jamie?

300
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:17,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's time to bring the lusty wench into the chat room.

301
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:25,756
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, it's basically, it's just like what Matt said, I think it's the whole fan base there.

302
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,837
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you get into one, you hear about the next.

303
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:33,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, my newest obsession is the whole J-Rock visual K thing, because, well, they're pretty men in makeup.

304
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me about the J-Rock obsession.

305
00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:38,541
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it about the J-Rock that's just... Because I notice it's like, you're...

306
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:50,392
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that don't know, the Bomani Music and More program, which is on this station when we're not live, all the music, we have every week, Jamie picks a song and I pick a song to play that's not in any Bomani game, but we think it should be.

307
00:22:50,732 --> 00:22:53,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie picked a J-rock song, Luna Sea.

308
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:54,996
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm such a whore for Luna Sea.

309
00:22:55,036 --> 00:22:59,941
[SPEAKER_04]: With Crazy For You for a Guitar Freak song, which would be a pretty damn good Guitar Freak song, I have to agree with you.

310
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:02,803
[SPEAKER_04]: But I notice you're becoming obsessed with the J-rock lately.

311
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:03,184
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

312
00:23:03,544 --> 00:23:08,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of was for a little bit, and then I got really back into it during AX.

313
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:17,991
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually bought a Hide plushie, as in Hide from X-Japan, who killed himself in a very, very controversial whole thing, but that's another story.

314
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:23,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I picked up a Luna C set over at AX.

315
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:24,134
[SPEAKER_11]: There were lots of people.

316
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:25,935
[SPEAKER_11]: There were the gacked sex kittens.

317
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:27,716
[SPEAKER_11]: outside of the Hyatt Hotel.

318
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,377
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was all over the place at AX.

319
00:23:30,557 --> 00:23:33,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of people doing Mana from Malice Miser cosplay.

320
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,742
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got back and just went and found all of my old MP3s and was really into it again.

321
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:41,603
[SPEAKER_11]: It was visual K-Owns.

322
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:46,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Corey is challenging you.

323
00:23:46,186 --> 00:23:47,807
[SPEAKER_04]: He says that Glay is better than Lunacy.

324
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:48,267
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

325
00:23:48,903 --> 00:23:50,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a whore for lunacy, I'm sorry.

326
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:52,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I love everything they've done.

327
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:56,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, Rozier is my favorite song that they've done, and love song.

328
00:23:56,947 --> 00:23:57,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

329
00:23:58,007 --> 00:24:05,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, DarkTetsuya is reminding us that in Guitar Freak's 8th mix, which is being location tested right now, there is going to be a Gak song covered in it, so that would be pretty cool.

330
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:08,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, DarkTetsuya, he's saying, what's wrong with Renaissance Terror?

331
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:12,835
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing wrong with a Renaissance Terror, just like there's nothing wrong with Star Trek, and there's nothing wrong with Bondage.

332
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:13,335
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.

333
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:14,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you're into.

334
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,058
[SPEAKER_11]: They all involve leather of some kind.

335
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:20,121
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got your Klingons for your leather, your blood pie.

336
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:20,581
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

337
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:21,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a leather correlation.

338
00:24:21,682 --> 00:24:23,704
[SPEAKER_11]: And they are into big time S&M.

339
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:27,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, do you think that anime and DDR, maybe it's the shoes?

340
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:29,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't know.

341
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:31,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been wearing the same pair of shoes for a year.

342
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:34,133
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the sexy nurses, exactly.

343
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:39,397
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's the whole, you know, because Solo is going to make us all go to hell.

344
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,398
[SPEAKER_11]: But Solo sucks anyways.

345
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:44,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anything else on anime?

346
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:49,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I would probably have to say that, you know, to each their own.

347
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Anime is a pretty, you know, versatile genre, you know.

348
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:58,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it encompasses so much you can do anything with animation now, you know.

349
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:05,051
[SPEAKER_11]: And DDR, you know, they've actually started having references to DDR, to Beimani in some different anime now.

350
00:25:05,352 --> 00:25:06,593
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't think of any off the top of my head.

351
00:25:06,993 --> 00:25:13,959
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, even Konami is putting their Beimani into their other games, like Tokimeki Memorial, Dancing Summer Vacation, which I have.

352
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,241
[SPEAKER_11]: And other things like that.

353
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:20,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, if we're done with the anime topic... Oh, sure.

354
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:21,265
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one.

355
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:26,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, many of the songs from Initial D are in Parapara.

356
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:30,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there's an anime you might be familiar with that had a promoting reference, King of the Hill.

357
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:33,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it counts as anime.

358
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,020
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of more like Scribble May or something.

359
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say it's more like Scribble May.

360
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:43,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywho, I'm being fed a lot of news here.

361
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:50,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Corey Virtue is somehow in the know, and he's giving me all this news here that he wants me to share with you and get your reaction.

362
00:25:50,406 --> 00:25:55,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only in the chat room, but those of you here in the studio that might be hearing some of this news for the first time.

363
00:25:55,188 --> 00:26:01,971
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm presenting to you a little segment we call, Corey Gives Sky the News, and he reports it over the show.

364
00:26:05,193 --> 00:26:07,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we have an eighth mix.

365
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:15,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, if you use auto-bass, or auto-whatever, instead of giving you a perfect, it's now going to give you an auto.

366
00:26:15,478 --> 00:26:18,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not going to count as part of your combo.

367
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,182
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think of that?

368
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:22,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I heard that before, but he didn't say auto-bass.

369
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:24,728
[SPEAKER_21]: He just said, instead of perfects, you get auto.

370
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:26,209
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like, what the hell?

371
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,451
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no perfects?

372
00:26:28,183 --> 00:26:33,384
[SPEAKER_11]: They better take the short people into account, like... Yeah, there should be a Jamie instead of me if we can get into Jamie's.

373
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:39,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, it's like, if I'm at Spiegel, the thing is too damn tall for me to reach the damn bass pedal.

374
00:26:39,546 --> 00:26:42,106
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have a chair that comes with it that just boosts up.

375
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:42,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie Detective.

376
00:26:42,826 --> 00:26:49,628
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, for every version of Drum Mania that they put out, they need to send a free stool and a booster seat for me.

377
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:51,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Drum Mania 7.

378
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:51,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I say 6?

379
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:52,089
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

380
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,410
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to make the bass pedal higher.

381
00:26:56,471 --> 00:26:57,892
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to have adjustable bass pedals.

382
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:03,897
[SPEAKER_04]: So the new Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, they're going to have auto instead of perfect.

383
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:04,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

384
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:13,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll give you incentive to play with the auto bass, but for those of us that are hype challenged in one way or another, we're just going to have to get more magazines or a smaller chair or something.

385
00:27:14,062 --> 00:27:19,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in the news, you're going to be able to set different difficulty levels for one player and two player for Guitar Freaks.

386
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:22,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So one person can do beginner, the other can do extreme or whatever.

387
00:27:23,747 --> 00:27:28,029
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also change the difficulty of the extra stage before you enter it.

388
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's cool.

389
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:35,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can do all your songs on Maniac and then be a chicken and do a basic extra stage or vice versa.

390
00:27:35,793 --> 00:27:39,075
[SPEAKER_04]: You just want the Maniac extra stage, just use a bunch of crappy songs to get to it.

391
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:50,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there's going to be reverse mode in it too, so you can flip it, just like DDR's reverse mode, and now the notes can come to the bottom, so it can be like Beat Guitar Mania.

392
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:55,020
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be like, you know, rocker mode.

393
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:05,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, in another Bomani Game News, I'm not sure what the source is for this, must be a Japo site or something, he says that Beatmania 3 will be the last one too.

394
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:12,723
[SPEAKER_04]: They are going to be putting out Beatmania 3, the final as well, to correlate with the final 5 key, regular Beatmania.

395
00:28:13,023 --> 00:28:15,584
[SPEAKER_11]: That really makes sense because they hardly use the pedal anyway.

396
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:20,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Paul's throwing his hands up behind me with the music in the background.

397
00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:21,715
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of our hoochie mamas.

398
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:27,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thank you very much to... So you're a hoochie mama then?

399
00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:29,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much to Virtue for providing all that news for us.

400
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:31,579
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I was told to do.

401
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been following through.

402
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,801
[SPEAKER_03]: No one else put their hands up.

403
00:28:36,775 --> 00:28:37,376
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

404
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:56,133
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not like that.

405
00:28:56,173 --> 00:29:04,241
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of the underdogs there, and it's all about the stupid swim park they have there, and the laser tag, and Beachhead 2000.

406
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:08,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, Dave, tell them about your new trick for people when they're playing Beachhead 2000 for little kids.

407
00:29:09,326 --> 00:29:10,327
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, Beachhead.

408
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:15,292
[SPEAKER_21]: I think Paul might have done this too, but I do it now a lot to little kids.

409
00:29:15,732 --> 00:29:19,236
[SPEAKER_21]: It has a counterweight to balance out the level of the...

410
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:42,293
[SPEAKER_21]: the controller that goes on your head because it kind of does the VR virtual reality type thing where you place the controller on your head with the little two joysticks coming off the bottom and so the counterweight is behind the screen and it kind of goes and you can kind of fit back behind all the games and if you push down the counterweight then their controller that you know they've got their face

411
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:44,595
[SPEAKER_21]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

412
00:29:58,388 --> 00:29:59,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is all in theory.

413
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:01,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you can give us a shot.

414
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:04,652
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually tried it several times yesterday.

415
00:30:05,112 --> 00:30:12,837
[SPEAKER_21]: But the only problem is, since I'm behind the machine, I can't see the look on their face when they poke their head out of the VR game.

416
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:14,658
[SPEAKER_04]: And look around going, what's going on?

417
00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:19,762
[SPEAKER_04]: What we'll do, maybe we'll take the remote out to Roseville Golf Land this Wednesday and we'll try that on some people.

418
00:30:20,703 --> 00:30:22,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge bloopers and practical jokes.

419
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:24,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge amazing bloopers.

420
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Smile, you're on Orange Lounge camera.

421
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:29,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we'll get those on the website for you.

422
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:31,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So ways to fuck with people on Beachhead.

423
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you guys figured out a way to mess with people in Sumo yet?

424
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:45,524
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that haven't seen Sumo, it looks like you're climbing into a giant Pokeball and playing these, like on a big screen TV you've got these big plane games and stuff and the ball moves as you fly the plane.

425
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,986
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I still thought it was funny when someone tried to climb on top of one.

426
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:59,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yes, imagine this big red bubble with somebody piling in it, you know, going all Evangelion on somebody, and then there's somebody on top, and then there's people on the side.

427
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:00,306
[SPEAKER_11]: They're trying to get you.

428
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:01,988
[SPEAKER_11]: They're trying to get you!

429
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:02,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear they are!

430
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:03,850
[SPEAKER_11]: They want your brain!

431
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:05,852
[SPEAKER_11]: But I wasn't sniffing your spicy brain.

432
00:31:06,653 --> 00:31:08,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other ideas on how to mess with people on other games?

433
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,266
[SPEAKER_21]: No ideas yet, but I'm sure that you can just take a couple of hammers and pound on the game.

434
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:16,188
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, it's like shake it back and forth.

435
00:31:16,228 --> 00:31:16,969
[SPEAKER_21]: What's going on?

436
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:17,750
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not losing.

437
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,591
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not getting hit.

438
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:21,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Have someone play Gunblade and then have them try to write something.

439
00:31:22,476 --> 00:31:23,217
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a keyboard mania.

440
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:24,238
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a rightful punishment.

441
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:25,560
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll strike back for our home.

442
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Our poor keyboard manias.

443
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:35,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know how to mess with the Gauntlet Legends players, because those are the ones, they're obsessive over the game as we are with ours.

444
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:41,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen people there all day long, you know, Red Valkyrie is about to die, oh, I better put in another 20 bucks.

445
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, don't shoot food.

446
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:50,564
[SPEAKER_21]: No, see, they play it so much, they pull up the chair, and I know a couple of guys who I just watched them play it.

447
00:31:50,804 --> 00:31:58,586
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like they accidentally leave it on free play for two minutes, so they punch in 99 credits, and they sit there all day, and then whenever someone comes along, they dictate to them what to do.

448
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:04,227
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like, okay, you go sacrifice yourself in front of the big fire-breathing dragon while I sit back and launch my little attacks.

449
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:09,133
[SPEAKER_21]: No, but I think that we should go in all dressed up like the characters.

450
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:13,940
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like Red Ogre has entered the building and we should just sit there playing the game.

451
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:16,865
[SPEAKER_21]: Dressed up, it's like move aside, it's our turn to play.

452
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:18,787
[SPEAKER_21]: Make them play the old gauntlet.

453
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:20,269
[SPEAKER_04]: The other game.

454
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:23,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, make them play the old school gauntlet.

455
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:24,852
[SPEAKER_04]: That old school gauntlet rules, though.

456
00:32:24,872 --> 00:32:27,653
[SPEAKER_04]: But they don't have an old school gauntlet machine at RVGL, unfortunately.

457
00:32:27,673 --> 00:32:29,054
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to have them put that in the UltraGate.

458
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:30,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought of the other game.

459
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:30,935
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I noticed?

460
00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:36,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that when people make fun of you while you're playing DDR, they instantly go and play the WrestleMania game.

461
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:40,298
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to know how to mess with those people that are playing.

462
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:41,999
[SPEAKER_04]: The WWF game.

463
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:43,880
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that's right in the front as you walk in.

464
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Go to Slim Jim's, Adam.

465
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,120
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

466
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I think playing that awful WWF game in Gauntlet Legends is just punishment for now.

467
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:50,102
[SPEAKER_21]: Until Day of Reckoning!

468
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,401
[SPEAKER_21]: It'll burn!

469
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:53,043
[SPEAKER_21]: Just come up to him.

470
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:54,405
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like wearing a bandana.

471
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:55,767
[SPEAKER_21]: Snap into a Slim Jim.

472
00:32:56,147 --> 00:32:57,128
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah!

473
00:32:57,289 --> 00:32:57,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Take it!

474
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:01,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's time for a break.

475
00:33:01,374 --> 00:33:01,995
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think?

476
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I get to break more stuff?

477
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:08,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we got lots of things to celebrate in the 2DX world this week.

478
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,810
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 2DX 6 Style coming out in just four more days.

479
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:11,831
Yay!

480
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:19,332
[SPEAKER_04]: For the Japanese PlayStation 2s, so you can order your import machine and then play some 2DX at home.

481
00:33:19,812 --> 00:33:25,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I'm being told that after a few weeks of downtime, 2DXStyle.net is back up and running.

482
00:33:25,313 --> 00:33:31,734
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you haven't visited them yet, go visit our links page, and they've got a link on it to 2DX Style.

483
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:39,563
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you don't know our website, it's at orangelounge.skie.cx and visit that one too while you're at it.

484
00:33:40,524 --> 00:33:45,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in honor of these such momentous 2DX events, I'm going to play a whole set of 2DX songs for you.

485
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,631
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you say?

486
00:33:47,032 --> 00:33:48,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I say, okay!

487
00:33:48,313 --> 00:33:49,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll be right back.

488
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:07,098

489

Thanks for watching!

493
00:39:42,686 --> 00:39:43,548
Thanks for watching!

494
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:18,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you!

Thanks for watching!

496
00:42:08,183 --> 00:42:08,783
Thanks for watching!

497
00:42:38,395 --> 00:42:38,916
Thanks for watching!

498
00:43:15,797 --> 00:43:16,398
Thanks for watching!

499
00:43:46,528 --> 00:43:47,009
Thanks for watching!

500
00:45:21,383 --> 00:45:22,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

501
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:19,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

502
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

503
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:21,879
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

504
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we care what people think of us?

505
00:46:25,985 --> 00:46:28,068
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

506
00:46:28,108 --> 00:46:29,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

507
00:46:29,991 --> 00:46:30,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

508
00:46:33,997 --> 00:46:58,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Extreme Bobani Radio That's us, Orange Lounge Radio Yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio This is episode number four for this July the 14th, 2002 A long break there of all 2DX songs We had Colors from Six Styles A from Seventh Style Cracker from Fifth Style for the home version In My Eyes, Fifth Style, Frozen Ray

509
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:12,192
[SPEAKER_04]: from Six Style, and an old school one, Shine On, from 2DX Second Style, which the chatroom commented, uh, wanna talk as best, although I don't think it was in reference to that song, that's by Shore Eye, actually, 2DX Second Style, I might be corrected on that, though.

510
00:47:13,353 --> 00:47:19,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we took a long break, because we were prepping for this segment that we're gonna do, which we're gonna call Listless.

511
00:47:21,161 --> 00:47:21,862
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

512
00:47:23,368 --> 00:47:29,991
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to determine the worst song in Bomani history besides Let Them Move.

513
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:35,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Let Them Move is already assumed to be the worst song in Bomani history, so that's not a factor.

514
00:47:35,634 --> 00:47:39,916
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to determine the second worst song in Bomani history right here, so...

515
00:47:41,036 --> 00:47:46,362
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got everybody on the panel here who's written down their top three choices for worst Bomani song ever.

516
00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:48,544
[SPEAKER_04]: They've ordered it in the numbers three to one.

517
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:51,928
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to name off what we think the worst Bomani song is ever and why.

518
00:47:52,749 --> 00:47:54,151
[SPEAKER_04]: And after that...

519
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:57,861
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to eliminate one choice from the list.

520
00:47:57,921 --> 00:48:00,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have a list of 15 choices because there's five of us here.

521
00:48:00,483 --> 00:48:04,727
[SPEAKER_04]: And then each of us will get to take one choice off of the list.

522
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:15,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after that, with the 10 songs that will be remaining, the chatroom gets to vote and determine what is the worst song in Bomani history next to Let Them Move.

523
00:48:15,135 --> 00:48:17,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in the chatroom right now, you'll get to participate in this.

524
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:22,522
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be your vote that determines what the worst song is in Bomani history next to Let Them Move.

525
00:48:24,122 --> 00:48:27,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start with Jamie.

526
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:30,933
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your number three worst Bomani song in history?

527
00:48:31,754 --> 00:48:33,858
[SPEAKER_11]: I really, really hate Let the Beat Hit Em.

528
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:35,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Let the Beat Hit Em, all right.

529
00:48:36,738 --> 00:48:38,358
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really care for that version.

530
00:48:56,884 --> 00:48:57,204
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

531
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:59,686
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three worst Mamani song in history.

532
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:01,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so going to get smacked for this.

533
00:49:01,768 --> 00:49:06,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm going to get smacked for this, but for some reason I just don't like this song when I hear it.

534
00:49:06,912 --> 00:49:08,894
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three choice is Graduistic Cyber.

535
00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:11,356
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Gradiusic Cyber.

536
00:49:11,436 --> 00:49:11,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

537
00:49:11,876 --> 00:49:12,657
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Gradius.

538
00:49:12,677 --> 00:49:13,858
[SPEAKER_11]: That song is cool.

539
00:49:13,878 --> 00:49:14,658
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to kick you.

540
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:16,780
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, my number

541
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:28,534
[SPEAKER_21]: Number three pick is Bye Bye Baby Balloon because, well, they already made it like three times and then they put a new name on it and some freeze arrows and so it does not deserve to be Bulani music.

542
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:32,479
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, it kind of does because all the other ones are the same thing, but, you know.

543
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:34,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Paul.

544
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Double Trouble.

545
00:49:59,437 --> 00:50:00,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Freaks Number 3 Bus Stop

546
00:50:22,034 --> 00:50:22,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is.

547
00:50:22,855 --> 00:50:23,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

548
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,738
[SPEAKER_04]: The oldies in Disney's Rave.

549
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:26,459
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?

550
00:50:26,499 --> 00:50:28,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did they put all these oldies in Disney's Rave?

551
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Bassman owns.

552
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:30,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Mr. Bassman does own.

553
00:50:30,463 --> 00:50:30,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you that.

554
00:50:31,043 --> 00:50:32,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Bassman owns Dropout.

555
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:35,307
[SPEAKER_04]: But Bus Stop and what's the other one that annoys the hell out of me?

556
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:36,589
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another old school song.

557
00:50:36,649 --> 00:50:37,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Macarena.

558
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:38,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there's that.

559
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:38,991
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a given.

560
00:50:39,612 --> 00:50:42,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And Johnny B. Goode.

561
00:50:42,655 --> 00:50:42,855
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

562
00:50:42,995 --> 00:50:43,616
[SPEAKER_11]: That was fun.

563
00:50:44,381 --> 00:50:47,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that you heard in grade school and you did during the Disney review.

564
00:50:47,704 --> 00:50:48,945
[SPEAKER_04]: It works for DDR.

565
00:50:48,985 --> 00:50:49,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

566
00:50:49,966 --> 00:50:50,286
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

567
00:50:51,327 --> 00:50:52,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's number threes picks are out.

568
00:50:52,909 --> 00:50:59,295
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Let the Beat Hit Em, Graduistic Cyber, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble, and Bus Stops.

569
00:50:59,395 --> 00:51:00,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two choices.

570
00:51:00,236 --> 00:51:00,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie.

571
00:51:01,397 --> 00:51:02,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two would be Buell.

572
00:51:04,868 --> 00:51:21,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate Buell Buell is a good one, that's a good one, very good My number two choice was another 2DX song Oh, you're correcting my spelling on what he says I'm typing these out so we can see the list of what we have so we can eliminate things later

573
00:51:22,885 --> 00:51:30,792
[SPEAKER_04]: My number two choice for worst Bomani song, and I might get smacked for this because it's another 2DX song, but I really just don't like this song.

574
00:51:31,153 --> 00:51:33,635
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be Kamikaze from 2DX4Style.

575
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:35,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that song.

576
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:38,500
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never actually heard that song.

577
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:46,464
[SPEAKER_21]: But my number two is, I first heard it on the DDR USA, My Fire, because that song is just terrible.

578
00:51:46,525 --> 00:51:47,565
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't like My Fire.

579
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:48,586
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I don't.

580
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:49,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Blasphemer.

581
00:51:49,686 --> 00:51:50,647
[SPEAKER_21]: That's old school.

582
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:51,407
[SPEAKER_21]: It's enough to be retro.

583
00:51:51,427 --> 00:51:52,748
[SPEAKER_11]: That was my favorite song back then.

584
00:51:53,746 --> 00:51:55,647
[SPEAKER_21]: Butterfly in Boom Boom Dollar Old School.

585
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:56,508
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just crap.

586
00:51:56,828 --> 00:51:57,929
[SPEAKER_03]: This is on 1.5.

587
00:51:58,209 --> 00:52:00,710
[SPEAKER_03]: First it was cool, then it was very uncool, and now it's retro-cool.

588
00:52:01,091 --> 00:52:02,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone through the cycle.

589
00:52:02,572 --> 00:52:03,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Retro-cool.

590
00:52:03,132 --> 00:52:06,674
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two is a very generic choice for a song.

591
00:52:07,014 --> 00:52:12,158
[SPEAKER_03]: It just has the diva part, it has the rap part, everything that would be characteristic in a DDR song, and it's all done badly.

592
00:52:12,178 --> 00:52:12,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Detour.

593
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:14,779
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a bad song.

594
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:16,921
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta get that on there.

595
00:52:19,392 --> 00:52:21,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, I don't know if I can top that one.

596
00:52:22,635 --> 00:52:34,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, my second pick would have to go to Chodo, I guess, from DDR Club Mix, and also his second mix, Link Version.

597
00:52:35,808 --> 00:52:40,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even, that was just, it was a Laughin' Pete track, and it was just awesome.

598
00:52:40,072 --> 00:52:41,534
[SPEAKER_04]: How in the hell do you even spell that one?

599
00:52:41,554 --> 00:52:42,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even think I've played that one.

600
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:53,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here, C-H-O-T-T-O, and then the second part of it is K-I-I-N-T-E-N-A.

601
00:52:55,435 --> 00:52:56,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, laugh, and peace.

602
00:52:56,537 --> 00:52:57,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sucks.

603
00:52:59,298 --> 00:53:07,760
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting screamed at from the chat room for some of our number two choices, which again were Buell, Kamikaze, My Fire, D2R, and Chotokitene.

604
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,541
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people disagree with Kamikaze.

605
00:53:12,281 --> 00:53:16,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Corey is crying because he loves D2R and doesn't understand why none of us seem to like it.

606
00:53:19,043 --> 00:53:22,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, number one picks for worst Bomani song ever.

607
00:53:22,363 --> 00:53:23,964
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my vote to Strangle Politary.

608
00:53:24,044 --> 00:53:24,604
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, sorry.

609
00:53:25,104 --> 00:53:25,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Queens, Jamaica.

610
00:53:26,544 --> 00:53:27,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Queens, Jamaica.

611
00:53:27,525 --> 00:53:27,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

612
00:53:27,745 --> 00:53:28,765
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate Queens, Jamaica.

613
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:37,142
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate Queens, Jamaica because way back when on the old hip-hop mania machine that we had, everybody made me freaking play that song and I hate it.

614
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:40,384
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's also on my fifth mix non-stop.

615
00:53:41,064 --> 00:53:43,585
[SPEAKER_11]: And it always comes up right after my favorite song.

616
00:53:44,445 --> 00:53:45,425
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I hate it.

617
00:53:46,445 --> 00:53:46,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

618
00:53:48,466 --> 00:53:52,988
[SPEAKER_04]: My number one choice for worst Bomani song in history besides Let Them Move would be Jam Jam Reggae.

619
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:54,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Yum Yum Ragu.

620
00:53:55,168 --> 00:53:56,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I just, it's annoying.

621
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:56,909
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

622
00:53:56,949 --> 00:53:57,369
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries.

623
00:53:58,948 --> 00:53:59,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoa!

624
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:01,190
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

625
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:08,454
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, um, my least favorite song is, uh, I'm going on Corey's naming because I don't know the name.

626
00:54:08,534 --> 00:54:17,440
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, uh, Under Control, which is the encore stage for long version songs for guitar, seventh mix, uh, uh, drum mania sixth mix.

627
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,462
[SPEAKER_21]: And the reason why I picked it is because it's just grunge music.

628
00:54:20,582 --> 00:54:21,223
[SPEAKER_21]: It's terrible.

629
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:24,225
[SPEAKER_21]: It belongs not in Bomani.

630
00:54:24,245 --> 00:54:28,468
[SPEAKER_21]: It belongs in, like, underground crap music that's not even made into CDs.

631
00:54:29,128 --> 00:54:31,189
[SPEAKER_21]: And I avoid playing it by failing.

632
00:54:31,609 --> 00:54:39,552
[SPEAKER_21]: I fail the extra stage, which is One Phrase Blues, which is an awesome song, just so I don't even have to hear the beginning of that song.

633
00:54:39,612 --> 00:54:40,292
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so bad.

634
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:43,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Under Control, worst Pomani song of the day has been in.

635
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:49,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Some really bad songs, you know, have a nice thing about them, like Detour was hilarious, the best worst song ever.

636
00:54:49,756 --> 00:54:51,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Jem Jem Reggae has some fun steps on Maniac.

637
00:54:51,937 --> 00:54:55,861
[SPEAKER_03]: But this song, I heard about it, heard it before, and it was coming in the DDR, I was like, oh, that's alright.

638
00:54:56,182 --> 00:55:03,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And I play the song, and the steps are so slow, which is an awful song in the DDR, the steps are tub-thumping, had the worst steps in the DDR, and I was so pissed about it.

639
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:05,552
[SPEAKER_03]: God, what a bad song.

640
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:07,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't think you're going to get much argument there.

641
00:55:07,794 --> 00:55:09,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but it gets, it gets not down, but it gets up again.

642
00:55:11,018 --> 00:55:11,959
[SPEAKER_11]: You're never going to keep it down.

643
00:55:13,007 --> 00:55:16,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Matt, you're the final choice on the list.

644
00:55:16,929 --> 00:55:20,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there was just, like I said, so many to choose from.

645
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:28,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, now, Jam Jam Reggae, and I'm talking about the original one from Beatmania, because that one is damn awful.

646
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:34,675
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, there was another one from Beatmania that was also very awful, and that would be Love So Groovy.

647
00:55:35,075 --> 00:55:36,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Love So Groovy.

648
00:55:36,956 --> 00:55:38,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that song, it's just awful.

649
00:55:39,898 --> 00:55:41,519
[SPEAKER_11]: That was originally one of my picks, too.

650
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,961
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so the big list here.

651
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:44,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

652
00:55:44,361 --> 00:55:48,584
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all 15 choices, and we're going to now eliminate one song at a time.

653
00:55:48,624 --> 00:56:03,153
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Let the Beat Hit Em, Graduistic Cyber, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble, Bus Stop, Fuel, Kamikaze, My Fire, D2R, Choto Katana, Queens, Jamaica, Jam Jam Reggae, Under Control, Tub Thumping, and Love So Groovy.

654
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:09,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we get this narrowed down to 10, the chat room will get to vote on what they think is the worst song.

655
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:12,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some of these songs are so bad that we never bothered to get them.

656
00:56:12,678 --> 00:56:12,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

657
00:56:12,898 --> 00:56:14,118
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was much rejoicing.

658
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:14,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

659
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:16,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Graduous Exciber has to come off.

660
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:17,279
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my freaking song.

661
00:56:17,319 --> 00:56:19,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I finally, finally managed to beat and sing.

662
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:40,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so it gets saved.

663
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:43,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I, yeah, he would kill me, but he's not here, ha ha ha.

664
00:56:44,453 --> 00:56:51,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to grant a pardon to I'm Sorry Dave, but Under Control is fucking hilarious, and it goes off the list.

665
00:56:53,379 --> 00:56:54,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Song's so bad.

666
00:56:55,241 --> 00:57:02,466
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, well, then I guess I'll just have to take off Jam Jam Reggae off the list, because that song rocks on Doubles Maniac.

667
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:02,906
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so cool.

668
00:57:06,432 --> 00:57:12,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, it was from 1.5, and it is a cool, retro-cool song, my fire, and it's taken off the list.

669
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,060
I agree.

670
00:57:13,941 --> 00:57:15,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I totally agree with that one.

671
00:57:15,964 --> 00:57:23,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know about the steps in Tump Thumping, I thought it was damn easy, so I had a really cool edit for it, so I'm gonna have to take Tump Thumping off the list there.

672
00:57:23,452 --> 00:57:23,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

673
00:57:23,592 --> 00:57:23,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

674
00:57:27,099 --> 00:57:27,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

675
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:28,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Take it off the list.

676
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody boo Matt, please.

677
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:33,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

678
00:57:34,342 --> 00:57:37,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we've taken five songs off the list, and these are the ten that are left.

679
00:57:38,624 --> 00:57:52,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Let the Beat Hit Em, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble, Bus Stop, Beul, Kamikaze, D2R, Chotokatena, Queens, Jamaica, and Love So Groovy.

680
00:57:53,472 --> 00:57:54,873
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too late to add little bits.

681
00:57:55,053 --> 00:57:56,114
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too late to add songs.

682
00:57:56,154 --> 00:57:56,714
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the ten.

683
00:57:56,734 --> 00:57:57,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I just posted them in chat room.

684
00:57:58,035 --> 00:58:00,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat room, send me a private message, please, with your vote.

685
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:04,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying my vote is whatever for the worst Vamani song ever.

686
00:58:06,931 --> 00:58:10,553
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we're going to take a really quick break while you guys vote.

687
00:58:10,573 --> 00:58:15,995
[SPEAKER_04]: So just send me a private message in the channel saying my vote is and whatever you're picking for worst Bomani song.

688
00:58:16,015 --> 00:58:21,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll tally up the votes and we'll come back and let you know the worst Bomani song in history next to Let Them Move.

689
00:58:22,397 --> 00:58:23,257
[SPEAKER_04]: You have something to say, Jamie?

690
00:58:24,077 --> 00:58:24,237
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

691
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:25,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

692
00:58:25,518 --> 00:58:26,918
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe you picked Gratis Exciber.

693
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's got to be a song you hate that I like.

694
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what else were you thinking of putting on your list?

695
00:58:34,406 --> 00:58:40,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I did have Love So Groovy on there, and I really hate D2R.

696
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:45,574
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the music, but I hate Politary singing, so I'd have to ask anything with her singing.

697
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:46,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

698
00:58:48,648 --> 00:58:53,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's play something we talked about being over... We'll do one... Do I have... No.

699
00:58:53,294 --> 00:58:56,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do some of the Max tracks.

700
00:58:56,598 --> 00:58:58,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do some of the Max exclusive tracks.

701
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:58,821
[SPEAKER_04]: People like these songs.

702
00:58:58,921 --> 00:59:02,486
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a quick break here, and we'll be right back with the worst Bomani song in history.

703
00:59:02,526 --> 00:59:04,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for your votes in the chat room right now.

704
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:42,056
[SPEAKER_09]: But when she caught his eye, ain't no man can fight the demon He knew he had to try to make love again Mother let him know, she was in the mood for talking So then he began to play the game Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been hurt

705
01:00:06,721 --> 01:00:25,189
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream The best thing for you, no, you can count on me, believe me And what this lady, you know what she found in me Is a lady, the kind of lady that can give you what you need Baby, the kind of lady that will never leave you lonely And what this lady, finally she found me, oh, I love you

706
01:04:19,515 --> 01:04:20,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch, get a new song.

707
01:04:43,524 --> 01:04:45,945
[SPEAKER_15]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

708
01:04:46,025 --> 01:04:48,166
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

709
01:04:48,206 --> 01:04:58,249
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just after 8 o'clock, a little bit closer to 8.07 here in the middle of our fourth episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live where we are right in the middle of determining the worst song in Bomani history.

710
01:04:59,109 --> 01:05:00,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Next to Let Them Move.

711
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:05,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Let Them Move is already a given that it's first place, so we're doing the next worst Bomani song ever.

712
01:05:05,856 --> 01:05:08,519
[SPEAKER_04]: And the votes are in.

713
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:23,053
[SPEAKER_04]: We've asked everybody in our chatroom to vote on the list which we had, which consisted of Let The Beat Hit Them, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble, Bus Stop, Buell, Kamikaze, D2R, Choto Katana,

714
01:05:23,593 --> 01:05:26,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Queens, Jamaica, and Love So Groovy.

715
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:27,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do have a winner.

716
01:05:28,736 --> 01:05:32,679
[SPEAKER_04]: In third place is Let The Beat Hit Them.

717
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

718
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:39,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how that corresponds to Let The Beat Hit Them, but I thought it was a funny sound file.

719
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:44,646
[SPEAKER_04]: In second place for Worst Bomani Song Ever, Buell.

720
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:44,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Buell.

721
01:05:47,216 --> 01:05:49,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my goodness, I can't believe it.

722
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's ruined.

723
01:05:51,882 --> 01:05:54,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's ruined by Buell.

724
01:05:55,306 --> 01:05:57,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Buell, the second worst Bomani song in history.

725
01:05:57,669 --> 01:06:05,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And the worst Bomani song in history, next to Let Them Move, is Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

726
01:06:07,915 --> 01:06:11,380
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to flush that one down the toilet and pretend it didn't exist.

727
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:13,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye Bye Baby Balloon was the winner.

728
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:15,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Loser.

729
01:06:15,607 --> 01:06:18,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I guess the winner of losing.

730
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:19,433
[SPEAKER_04]: First place loser.

731
01:06:20,828 --> 01:06:21,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It sucks so bad.

732
01:06:21,489 --> 01:06:22,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye, Baby Balloon.

733
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:25,531
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so bad, they didn't even put it in Max 2.

734
01:06:25,591 --> 01:06:28,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It just got taken right off of Max and flushed down the toilet.

735
01:06:28,133 --> 01:06:29,294
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, you've got to think of it this way.

736
01:06:29,674 --> 01:06:32,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Buell sucks even more because he can't even lose right.

737
01:06:32,476 --> 01:06:34,918
[SPEAKER_21]: He has to come in second at being the worst song ever.

738
01:06:35,598 --> 01:06:36,299
[SPEAKER_21]: Good point, good point.

739
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:40,121
[SPEAKER_04]: No, unfortunately, I do not have a drumroll sound, but I do have this.

740
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:43,984
[SPEAKER_04]: For when Paul tells his next joke on the show.

741
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:46,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

742
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:50,817
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pressure.

743
01:06:50,877 --> 01:06:54,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I had this tower of vanilla Coke cans that I was building up that just fell over.

744
01:06:54,378 --> 01:06:56,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised you guys didn't hear the sound of that.

745
01:06:56,558 --> 01:06:57,819
[SPEAKER_04]: My leaning tower of vanilla Coke.

746
01:06:58,159 --> 01:06:58,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

747
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I have to... Yes?

748
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:13,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, you know, for all of the songs, I think, that are so terrible, we do have to remember that because these songs are so bad, they give value to the songs that are really good.

749
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:14,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

750
01:07:15,105 --> 01:07:15,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

751
01:07:16,446 --> 01:07:17,566
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need our bad songs.

752
01:07:18,027 --> 01:07:22,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe in a future edition, do you think we'd have the balls to do the best Bomani song ever?

753
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:23,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, totally.

754
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:23,671
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

755
01:07:23,911 --> 01:07:26,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll do that.

756
01:07:26,473 --> 01:07:28,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have the balls here at this radio station?

757
01:07:28,854 --> 01:07:32,957
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got balls bigger than anybody because they're inflatable, like our egos.

758
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:36,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Balls of them all.

759
01:07:38,863 --> 01:07:41,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, tournaments.

760
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:43,609
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some tournaments this weekend.

761
01:07:43,629 --> 01:07:44,731
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a tournament up in Reno.

762
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:47,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, none of us were able to get up there and go.

763
01:07:47,394 --> 01:07:49,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what the results were yet, unfortunately.

764
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,080
[SPEAKER_04]: But are you guys going to be going to any upcoming tournaments?

765
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,223
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like there's so many tournaments going on lately.

766
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,606
[SPEAKER_04]: You think it's just because it's summertime or...

767
01:07:57,791 --> 01:07:59,371
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's because people are bored.

768
01:08:00,191 --> 01:08:01,272
[SPEAKER_04]: So they just want to have a tournament?

769
01:08:02,092 --> 01:08:02,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear about now?

770
01:08:02,832 --> 01:08:03,432
[SPEAKER_04]: This is cool.

771
01:08:03,552 --> 01:08:06,113
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a tournament at SVGL.

772
01:08:06,293 --> 01:08:10,654
[SPEAKER_04]: They're having the... I unfortunately don't recall the right name of it, but I'm sure I'll be correct in the chat room.

773
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:12,994
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something like the DDR Royal Rumble, basically.

774
01:08:13,794 --> 01:08:18,455
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be having a perfect attack tournament that's kind of tied in a little bit to wrestling.

775
01:08:18,755 --> 01:08:21,216
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have a tag team thing, and they're going to have a rumble.

776
01:08:21,656 --> 01:08:22,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're going to have...

777
01:08:23,556 --> 01:08:26,177
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think about tournaments on weekdays?

778
01:08:26,337 --> 01:08:27,338
[SPEAKER_04]: It blows because people have jobs.

779
01:08:27,358 --> 01:08:30,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really comment on jobs or responsibilities, but I'll be there.

780
01:08:50,871 --> 01:08:55,673
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I can't really comment on that either, but I've got Summer School, which totally blows even more.

781
01:08:56,614 --> 01:08:58,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care, Perfect Attack is boring, don't want to go.

782
01:08:59,415 --> 01:09:10,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but you have to admit though, you have to admit Matt, even though Perfect Attack is boring, the stuff they're doing with this tournament is going to make it a little more exciting, because they're going to have the music, and the big costumes, and everything, just like Rosalind.

783
01:09:11,755 --> 01:09:16,898
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just like watching that 80s show and then the final episode of that 80s show.

784
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:20,501
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little bit better, but it still sucks.

785
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:24,763
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I don't really know what this Royal Rumble they're talking about.

786
01:09:25,964 --> 01:09:28,446
[SPEAKER_21]: Everyone pile on the machine and stomp on one arrow.

787
01:09:29,292 --> 01:09:30,633
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it doesn't work like that, unfortunately.

788
01:09:30,673 --> 01:09:31,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Although that would be fun, I think.

789
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:36,697
[SPEAKER_04]: But the way they're doing the Royal Rumble is basically you're going to draw a number randomly from 1 through 30.

790
01:09:37,677 --> 01:09:41,059
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first two people will go up, and whoever wins stays on the machine.

791
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:50,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, to prevent the last person from just coming up there, say the first guy beats 29 people and then loses the last guy, that would really suck for him.

792
01:09:50,385 --> 01:09:57,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have this little system they're using called chips, where if you beat so many people, you get a chip, and basically it moves you back to the end of the line.

793
01:09:57,509 --> 01:09:57,951
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

794
01:10:03,288 --> 01:10:04,268
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a very good idea.

795
01:10:04,509 --> 01:10:05,309
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a very good idea.

796
01:10:05,689 --> 01:10:13,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still wanting to have, like, you know, Guitar Freaks Drum Mania Visual K. I'm very surprised there hasn't been any kind of Drum Mania Guitar Freaks tournament.

797
01:10:14,473 --> 01:10:15,813
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be really simple to do.

798
01:10:15,874 --> 01:10:22,196
[SPEAKER_21]: Rob, if we ever do have another tournament here in Sacramento, that we have to use my idea of PA with answering trivia questions.

799
01:10:22,777 --> 01:10:28,179
[SPEAKER_21]: And whenever you get one wrong, then you get beaten with, like, some object, and the object's continually...

800
01:10:28,559 --> 01:10:30,100
[SPEAKER_11]: The Orange Bat of Doom

801
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:13,005
[SPEAKER_02]: and, god damn, there wasn't any... That was the most boring thing ever, just waiting for freestyle to come around, just watching all the people get up on the machine, complaining that the buttons aren't working, and they have to stop, and they have to test the buttons, and the buttons were working.

802
01:11:13,525 --> 01:11:14,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so boring.

803
01:11:15,246 --> 01:11:24,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, oh, and Folsom, when we had our SCAT tournament, I mean, it was even worse, because then you got it... You had the whole thing, you know, just packed, and then...

804
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:26,830
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing to do.

805
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:33,374
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have to admit, at the very end of the Perfect Attack and the Folsom Tournament where they had to do the verses, that was cool.

806
01:11:34,254 --> 01:11:36,356
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, the rest of it sucked.

807
01:11:38,397 --> 01:11:40,658
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why this year we're not having a tourney named after feces.

808
01:11:42,153 --> 01:11:44,334
[SPEAKER_04]: No, instead we're going to find another crude word to name it after.

809
01:11:44,614 --> 01:11:47,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I notice you've got some listings here of some upcoming tournaments.

810
01:11:47,915 --> 01:11:50,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what some other local tournaments... Well, we're not just a local show.

811
01:11:50,976 --> 01:11:52,576
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about some of the abroad tournaments.

812
01:11:52,936 --> 01:11:55,257
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like there's a pretty popular tournament.

813
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:56,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is kind of local.

814
01:11:56,677 --> 01:12:00,738
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be a tournament at Mountain Mike's in Concord on August 17th.

815
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:03,139
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dollar Mendy.

816
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:03,899
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dollar Mendy.

817
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And another Chinak Chinak tournament.

818
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is interesting because I believe it's going to be a no-bar machine.

819
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:15,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they were going to take the bars off for Perfect Attack as well, but I know for Freestyle there is going to be no bar on the machine.

820
01:12:15,909 --> 01:12:18,151
[SPEAKER_11]: If I recall, I do believe that the bar will be removed.

821
01:12:18,331 --> 01:12:23,797
[SPEAKER_03]: For Perfect Attack, if it isn't removed, then if you grab the bar and you don't look like you're falling down, you'll get disqualified.

822
01:12:24,677 --> 01:12:26,880
[SPEAKER_21]: Who uses the bar for Perfect Attack anyway?

823
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:28,681
[SPEAKER_11]: There's people who rape the bar.

824
01:12:29,282 --> 01:12:30,363
[SPEAKER_21]: That's disgusting.

825
01:12:31,021 --> 01:12:32,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see it in tournaments though.

826
01:12:32,362 --> 01:12:34,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've ever seen anyone grab the bar in a tournament.

827
01:12:34,562 --> 01:12:35,343
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen it happen.

828
01:12:35,503 --> 01:12:35,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

829
01:12:36,763 --> 01:12:42,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the only time I think I really see people grab the bar would be on fast songs.

830
01:12:42,586 --> 01:12:47,388
[SPEAKER_04]: When Dropout was first, you know, the new song to beat, everybody, all the cool kids want to beat Dropout.

831
01:12:48,168 --> 01:12:50,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people held the bar for that, and then of course Max and Max Unlimited.

832
01:12:50,989 --> 01:12:53,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't say that I've ever really held on to the bar.

833
01:12:53,647 --> 01:13:00,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I... I... When I was learning how to beat Max 300, I was using it for a while, but then I was like, you know what?

834
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:00,371
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

835
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:05,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to do this with my feet because it doesn't seem... It doesn't seem right unless I can do it with my feet.

836
01:13:05,433 --> 01:13:07,554
[SPEAKER_04]: At Max Unlimited, I haven't allowed myself to touch the bar at all.

837
01:13:07,734 --> 01:13:14,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really bad at Max 300 and Max Unlimited, but I've gotten further through them without using the bar than I have using it because it just totally throws off my center of balance.

838
01:13:14,898 --> 01:13:15,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

839
01:13:15,919 --> 01:13:18,880
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the bar is there, I think, to catch yourself if you're falling.

840
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:19,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

841
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,081
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, for emergencies.

842
01:13:20,141 --> 01:13:20,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

843
01:13:20,721 --> 01:13:21,422
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I...

844
01:13:22,242 --> 01:13:25,326
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, the original solo machines, the Japanese solo machines, they don't have a bar on them.

845
01:13:25,947 --> 01:13:29,771
[SPEAKER_11]: So... Anyway, we have more tournaments.

846
01:13:30,212 --> 01:13:32,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, can you go back to that listing of tournaments there that you had up on the screen a minute?

847
01:13:33,996 --> 01:13:36,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at some other tournaments that seem to be pretty popular.

848
01:13:37,941 --> 01:13:40,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Use the little... There you go.

849
01:13:40,684 --> 01:13:41,185
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

850
01:13:43,345 --> 01:13:48,428
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having a moment while we... Okay, we're looking at some other popular looking tournaments that are coming up.

851
01:13:48,448 --> 01:13:51,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there's the big one at Castro Valley Golf Land on July 20th.

852
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:55,773
[SPEAKER_04]: The week right after that, they're having one in Rohnert Park, Scandia.

853
01:13:57,915 --> 01:14:01,977
[SPEAKER_04]: The same day as the big Mountain Mikes in Concord, they're going to be having one in SoCal.

854
01:14:02,017 --> 01:14:03,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this one's kind of a controversial tournament.

855
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:11,463
[SPEAKER_04]: They're having the Rays Game Center tournament, and it's kind of a bit controversial because it's not DDR Drags, which is a little bit...

856
01:14:12,304 --> 01:14:14,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a constant controversy on some message boards.

857
01:14:15,009 --> 01:14:19,196
[SPEAKER_11]: I was told in no uncertain terms that when I was in San Diego I was not to go to Rays.

858
01:14:20,484 --> 01:14:22,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess some interesting things going on there.

859
01:14:22,365 --> 01:14:33,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we want to get into it on the show, but apparently they've decided, the owner of the place decided to make a change with who's going to be running the tournament and not going over well with some people down there.

860
01:14:34,293 --> 01:14:38,935
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are still going to be doing a tournament on the 17th, same day as the one in Concord.

861
01:14:38,995 --> 01:14:41,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately that's going to split things up a bit.

862
01:14:41,537 --> 01:14:45,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Drags 2, I went down to Drags 2, which was about a year ago, and one of the best...

863
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Best tournaments I went to.

864
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great road trip.

865
01:14:48,381 --> 01:14:48,921
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot of fun.

866
01:14:48,961 --> 01:14:50,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like road tripping sometimes.

867
01:14:52,282 --> 01:14:53,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to miss it.

868
01:14:53,062 --> 01:14:54,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I was home all by myself.

869
01:14:54,503 --> 01:14:54,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Cry.

870
01:14:55,343 --> 01:14:55,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Bummer.

871
01:14:56,143 --> 01:14:56,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we go back to the list?

872
01:14:57,084 --> 01:14:57,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, please.

873
01:14:59,205 --> 01:15:02,726
[SPEAKER_21]: When is the 17th of the 8th month?

874
01:15:02,826 --> 01:15:03,746
[SPEAKER_21]: On the 17th!

875
01:15:03,846 --> 01:15:04,466
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, no.

876
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:06,007
[SPEAKER_21]: Of the 8th month of the year.

877
01:15:06,387 --> 01:15:07,607
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I don't know.

878
01:15:08,288 --> 01:15:11,389
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like Captain Not Look at Obvious Stuff.

879
01:15:12,489 --> 01:15:14,450
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a Saturday, to my knowledge, yeah.

880
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:15,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Midwest Showdown 2

881
01:15:33,307 --> 01:15:35,589
[SPEAKER_04]: and they've got some other tournaments coming.

882
01:15:35,609 --> 01:15:37,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see anything too far off the calendar.

883
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:40,854
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like August 17th is really the last thing that's planned.

884
01:15:41,354 --> 01:15:43,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the results for yesterday's tournament in Reno up there?

885
01:15:43,977 --> 01:15:46,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we go ahead and read those off if we've got them.

886
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:49,141
[SPEAKER_11]: They might not be up yet.

887
01:15:53,888 --> 01:15:56,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Dollar Mendy's Summer Vacation, no bar, in Concord.

888
01:16:22,446 --> 01:16:26,008
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, should you drive farther for a tournament that may not be good or have no bar?

889
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:27,469
[SPEAKER_11]: And some tasty pizza.

890
01:16:27,489 --> 01:16:29,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, Paul, it's a national show.

891
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,971
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually an international show.

892
01:16:32,191 --> 01:16:33,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have listeners in Japan.

893
01:16:34,092 --> 01:16:40,456
[SPEAKER_04]: The cool thing is on the Live365 stats, I can see where the listeners are listening from, and I do have listeners listening in from Japan, so that's pretty cool, huh?

894
01:16:40,536 --> 01:16:41,376
[SPEAKER_16]: That's pretty sweet.

895
01:16:41,536 --> 01:16:42,117
[SPEAKER_16]: They're robots.

896
01:16:42,637 --> 01:16:43,197
[SPEAKER_04]: They are robots.

897
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:44,538
[SPEAKER_04]: All over the place.

898
01:16:44,578 --> 01:16:48,100
[SPEAKER_04]: We have listeners in Canada as well and all sorts of places now.

899
01:16:48,379 --> 01:16:49,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Poppin' Music Poppin' Music 8

900
01:17:17,057 --> 01:17:18,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I like poppin' music.

901
01:17:18,039 --> 01:17:18,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I do too.

902
01:17:18,699 --> 01:17:19,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I love poppin' music.

903
01:17:19,741 --> 01:17:20,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's so cool.

904
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:23,326
[SPEAKER_04]: But why is it that it's kind of forgotten?

905
01:17:23,366 --> 01:17:24,087
[SPEAKER_04]: You never hear it talked about?

906
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:35,277
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, poppin' music is just like, hey, I got an idea, let's take 2DX, lose the turntable, make all the buttons really, really big and colorful.

907
01:17:35,758 --> 01:17:36,999
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, that sounds great.

908
01:17:37,539 --> 01:17:39,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like some kind of Fruit Roll-Ups, you know, mistake.

909
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what did we pour on the buttons?

910
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:41,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are they getting so big?

911
01:17:42,062 --> 01:17:44,184
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's because pop music isn't in a lot of arcades.

912
01:17:44,444 --> 01:17:46,866
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of like a novelty thing that people don't really play that much.

913
01:17:47,066 --> 01:17:49,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Poppin' music is pretty challenging, though.

914
01:17:50,348 --> 01:17:54,191
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I could get right up and play it, and I totally failed like Cutie Honey on Adamelo 2.

915
01:17:54,631 --> 01:17:58,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's just because the machines are so scattered amongst the U.S.?

916
01:17:58,172 --> 01:18:07,594
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't really see them in the... There's no pop-in music machines, to my knowledge, anyway, in the Bay Area, which is where, you know, the majority of your board posters come from, because it was the first area that had Bomani.

917
01:18:08,535 --> 01:18:11,175
[SPEAKER_04]: SoCal has a couple machines, Arcade Infinity.

918
01:18:11,335 --> 01:18:13,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been there playing... It's a fun game.

919
01:18:13,816 --> 01:18:15,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the ones when you have to hit four at once.

920
01:18:15,477 --> 01:18:17,337
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of have to use your forearms to hit the buttons.

921
01:18:17,417 --> 01:18:18,097
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty crazy.

922
01:18:18,377 --> 01:18:19,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, karate chop!

923
01:18:19,718 --> 01:18:20,118
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um...

924
01:18:21,578 --> 01:18:25,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I think they have a machine in Seattle, but they're kind of spotty, the location of the machine.

925
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:29,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that's the only reason people look at... Sort of out of sight, out of mind.

926
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:33,866
[SPEAKER_21]: At AI, why play poppin' music when you can play Mambo-O-Gogo?

927
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:43,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's all I... Because Mambo-O-Gogo has like ten songs, and once you've played them all... Personally, I find Mambo-O-Gogo to be kind of easy, personally.

928
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:49,717
[SPEAKER_21]: Even on the hard mode, it's... You can play it with all nine of the things and get like... You can beat the hardest song on that?

929
01:18:50,385 --> 01:18:58,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I played the hardest song, but I played Hard Mode, and it wasn't, you know, 2DX is harder for me, but I guess that's a given.

930
01:18:59,451 --> 01:19:02,373
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the information on the, what do you want to tell us about Poppin' Music 8, Matt?

931
01:19:02,633 --> 01:19:06,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, this information comes from BimaniStyle.com.

932
01:19:07,056 --> 01:19:09,638
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got, looks like a couple features here.

933
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:23,849
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, there's going to be a mode called Beat Pop, which is basically, you have instead of the nice little, I guess, stuff they normally have falling down the screen, you have lines just like Beat Mania, that type of thing, kind of makes it look more like that.

934
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:32,076
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a sort of a dark mode called Soft Discretion Line, and it just turns the indicator a little bit darker, so it's...

935
01:19:35,158 --> 01:19:38,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have one that's really cool that's called Disjointed Speed Mode.

936
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:56,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that is, is where, for instance, if it were to be applied to DDR, you'd have the left arrow going at 4 speed, you'd have the up arrow going at 2 speed, maybe the right arrow at 1 speed, and then maybe, I don't know, the down arrow or something at another speed.

937
01:19:57,149 --> 01:19:59,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you have all the arrows going at different speeds.

938
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:02,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Disjointed Speed sounds like some weird band name.

939
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:04,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be really hard to play.

940
01:20:04,813 --> 01:20:10,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of pretty much all the new features that are going to be coming out for that.

941
01:20:11,497 --> 01:20:16,700
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the song list goes, there's a couple of songs coming over from different Bomani.

942
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,662
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got Candy, the vocal version from Max 2.

943
01:20:20,342 --> 01:20:27,587
[SPEAKER_02]: You have, well, let's see here, Boa Boa Lady from Beatmania.

944
01:20:28,127 --> 01:20:29,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better than Jam Jam Reggae.

945
01:20:29,969 --> 01:20:34,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here, Linus, I think that was 2DX, Sixstyle.

946
01:20:36,441 --> 01:20:37,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here, we've got...

947
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:42,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Jet World

948
01:21:12,155 --> 01:21:13,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, driving this into the ground here.

949
01:21:13,656 --> 01:21:14,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's all right.

950
01:21:14,156 --> 01:21:15,237
[SPEAKER_04]: When you think of it, you can let us know.

951
01:21:16,077 --> 01:21:18,058
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually having a request, though, from the chat room.

952
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:19,779
[SPEAKER_04]: They want an update.

953
01:21:19,799 --> 01:21:22,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, you seem to be our simulator expert here.

954
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:24,161
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on in the sim world?

955
01:21:24,861 --> 01:21:26,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we haven't talked about it yet, this show.

956
01:21:26,301 --> 01:21:27,462
[SPEAKER_04]: So they want to hear what's going on.

957
01:21:27,768 --> 01:21:30,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, some stuff going.

958
01:21:31,269 --> 01:21:38,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, pretty much two things that we've been waiting for have been the new versions of Step Mania and Dance With Intensity.

959
01:21:38,172 --> 01:21:43,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance With Intensity, we're still waiting for them to actually release a beta of version 2.

960
01:21:44,074 --> 01:21:46,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Step Mania has been coming out with new betas.

961
01:21:46,555 --> 01:21:48,916
[SPEAKER_02]: They have beta 4 now, which is alright.

962
01:21:48,956 --> 01:21:50,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying it out.

963
01:21:50,236 --> 01:21:54,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still sticking with Dance With Intensity because it loads up really fast.

964
01:21:55,078 --> 01:21:55,919
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's what I seem to like.

965
01:21:56,039 --> 01:22:02,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll rather have faster loading over all the, you know, kind of bonus features that they've got there.

966
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:17,381
[SPEAKER_21]: For Step Mania, I don't know if it was just Beta 3 or just the computer that I played it on, but two-thirds of the time or more when you ever hit an up and down jump arrow or whenever you held one of the up and down jump arrows and tried to hit...

967
01:22:18,081 --> 01:22:27,089
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, held up and down arrow, or either one of them tried to hit the other one, it wouldn't register, or it would register just as like a boo or a good or something.

968
01:22:27,589 --> 01:22:32,934
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't know if that's just on all beta 3 or just on the computer that I use.

969
01:22:33,642 --> 01:22:57,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure about that one but the other thing that's going to be going on is the contest that they had for the DWI contest they had put out by DDR East Coast Invasion is they're actually doing voting right now and it should have been wrapped up today according to their boards but I still haven't seen anything on that yet and the melting pot boards are still messed up

970
01:22:57,941 --> 01:23:02,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I am getting a rumor here that DWI2, one of the new features, is going to be a groove meter.

971
01:23:02,905 --> 01:23:03,766
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be pretty cool.

972
01:23:03,966 --> 01:23:04,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't doubt it.

973
01:23:04,847 --> 01:23:12,933
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been looking for a good code for it, you know, some good source code to actually generate those, much like, you know, Stepmania has.

974
01:23:13,354 --> 01:23:14,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Really big deal.

975
01:23:14,855 --> 01:23:17,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I saw that with Stepmania 2.

976
01:23:17,297 --> 01:23:20,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, okay, so I don't look at that anyways.

977
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:22,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

978
01:23:23,942 --> 01:23:24,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

979
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:31,650
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to take another quick break, and when we come back, we'll interact with the chat room a little more, talk about whatever they want us to talk about.

980
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:33,911
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some other topics here that we can get into if we want.

981
01:23:34,611 --> 01:23:37,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And, God, who knows what else we're going to talk about here on Orange Lounge.

982
01:23:37,853 --> 01:23:40,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll just say screw Bomani, and we'll just talk about other stuff.

983
01:23:41,495 --> 01:23:41,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

984
01:23:42,316 --> 01:23:43,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you're listening to Orange Lounge.

985
01:23:43,736 --> 01:23:44,597
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing over there, Jamie?

986
01:23:45,618 --> 01:23:46,338
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on the floor.

987
01:23:46,518 --> 01:23:47,218
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on the floor?

988
01:23:47,339 --> 01:23:48,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to kick Matt out of the chair?

989
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:50,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just kick him?

990
01:23:51,081 --> 01:23:51,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

991
01:23:52,023 --> 01:23:52,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

992
01:23:52,803 --> 01:23:54,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I can get you another chair if you want.

993
01:23:54,264 --> 01:23:54,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry about it.

994
01:23:56,285 --> 01:23:57,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll be back in a little bit.

995
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:50,718
Thanks for watching!

996
01:25:45,755 --> 01:25:47,115
[SPEAKER_16]: I am DJ Sender!

997
01:25:47,415 --> 01:25:48,956
[SPEAKER_16]: I am DJ Sender!

998
01:25:49,036 --> 01:25:49,816
[SPEAKER_16]: I am DJ Sender!

999
01:25:50,136 --> 01:25:50,916
[SPEAKER_16]: I am DJ Sender!

1000
01:25:50,996 --> 01:25:52,036
[SPEAKER_16]: I am DJ Sender!

1001
01:25:52,116 --> 01:25:52,577
[SPEAKER_16]: I am DJ Sender!

1002
01:25:52,677 --> 01:25:53,997
[SPEAKER_16]: I am DJ Sender!

1003
01:26:20,428 --> 01:26:21,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1004
01:27:09,608 --> 01:27:10,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Gachon!

1005
01:27:11,974 --> 01:27:12,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you!

1006
01:27:12,756 --> 01:27:15,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Gachon!

1007
01:29:58,053 --> 01:29:59,774
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's that Pokemon?

1008
01:30:27,429 --> 01:30:34,211
Move on now, let somebody feel the beat Come on, wake up, let our energy to beat

1009
01:31:01,045 --> 01:31:01,545
and many more.

1010
01:31:54,381 --> 01:32:02,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Warning, Orange Lounge Radio's Bonnie Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.

1011
01:32:02,244 --> 01:32:12,848
[SPEAKER_15]: We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.

1012
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:17,369
[SPEAKER_15]: A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

1013
01:32:17,689 --> 01:32:20,870
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1014
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:22,371
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here until 9 o'clock tonight.

1015
01:32:23,391 --> 01:32:24,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to turn it over to Paul.

1016
01:32:25,473 --> 01:32:33,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul likes to do a little segment every week here, when he's here, where he's going to wrap up what's going on on the local message boards, local and abroad.

1017
01:32:33,559 --> 01:32:35,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever message board he wants to talk about, he's giving us the wrap-up.

1018
01:32:36,001 --> 01:32:37,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So go for it, Paul.

1019
01:32:37,282 --> 01:32:38,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to give you some music, though.

1020
01:32:41,685 --> 01:32:51,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, on the Sacramento Money Board, there's a little action in, you know, great, being grown up, but you're obese.

1021
01:32:51,372 --> 01:32:51,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

1022
01:32:52,598 --> 01:32:58,461
[SPEAKER_03]: On Sacamani, we've been going over and talking about, after our crazy broken bread, we've been seeing, you know, how much stuff has been broken out in the game.

1023
01:32:59,501 --> 01:33:03,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, since it's been us helping out, and we've decided that we're going to get a letter together.

1024
01:33:03,763 --> 01:33:12,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Jessica, the Gwana girl, has gone to play in the drafts with us together, and we're going to go over it, and form a letter together, and I'll send it in, and talk about that.

1025
01:33:13,108 --> 01:33:15,329
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so the discussion has been going on.

1026
01:33:18,450 --> 01:33:21,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people still can't post in the right introductory thread and everything else.

1027
01:33:22,113 --> 01:33:23,013
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a little concern.

1028
01:33:23,133 --> 01:33:24,934
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to get that mic a little closer to your mouth, Paul.

1029
01:33:24,994 --> 01:33:27,256
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like you're going to shove it all in your mouth.

1030
01:33:27,416 --> 01:33:28,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it all at once.

1031
01:33:28,276 --> 01:33:28,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it all.

1032
01:33:29,657 --> 01:33:30,577
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to blow that whistle.

1033
01:33:30,878 --> 01:33:33,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just glad that we've been actually getting something together after complaining for so long.

1034
01:33:33,599 --> 01:33:35,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought we'd just note that.

1035
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone who's interested should talk to people about that.

1036
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:41,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other boards you want to give us a lowdown on?

1037
01:33:42,434 --> 01:33:44,175
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, not much has been happening too much.

1038
01:33:44,195 --> 01:33:48,459
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of boards have slowed down just because people have been divided, and I haven't been on DDR Freak in a long time.

1039
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:50,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Same old, same old on DDR Freak.

1040
01:33:51,301 --> 01:33:52,122
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so that's a wrap-up.

1041
01:33:52,162 --> 01:33:52,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Same old shit.

1042
01:33:52,863 --> 01:33:53,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

1043
01:33:54,484 --> 01:33:55,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Paul.

1044
01:33:55,365 --> 01:33:55,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

1045
01:33:58,167 --> 01:34:03,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being given a link here in the chat rooms for us to discuss, so let's just bring it up here live on air.

1046
01:34:04,435 --> 01:34:05,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Rumors, rumors, rumors.

1047
01:34:05,715 --> 01:34:09,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I know these have to be... These are all rumors and who knows what's going on.

1048
01:34:10,216 --> 01:34:11,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is an interesting rumor.

1049
01:34:11,737 --> 01:34:16,818
[SPEAKER_04]: This kind of has to go with the message board wrap-up because this has been posted on DDR Free causing quite the stir here.

1050
01:34:17,598 --> 01:34:27,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Says, Konami USA has issued a press release saying they will seize all unauthorized 5th, 6th, and 7th mixed games with the help of local law enforcement.

1051
01:34:28,021 --> 01:34:31,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I know what site they'll be looking at to find out where these machines are located.

1052
01:34:32,562 --> 01:34:33,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Thoughts, people?

1053
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:36,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, first of all, I'd like to actually read that press release.

1054
01:34:36,908 --> 01:34:37,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a link on there?

1055
01:34:38,509 --> 01:34:39,249
[SPEAKER_04]: There is not.

1056
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:39,990
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you know?

1057
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:41,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

1058
01:34:41,771 --> 01:34:43,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Makes one think.

1059
01:34:43,691 --> 01:34:54,617
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if someone's going to put up a rumor of that magnitude, the only way I would believe it is either, one, seeing the press release, or two, having it posted by KOA on the board.

1060
01:34:54,717 --> 01:34:55,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1061
01:34:55,917 --> 01:35:01,660
[SPEAKER_11]: So, until I have, you know, legitimate proof, I call that a big pile of sticky poop.

1062
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what people are saying about that.

1063
01:35:05,682 --> 01:35:07,723
[SPEAKER_04]: BS, BS, BS, BS, BS, BS.

1064
01:35:08,844 --> 01:35:10,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much everybody says that's BS.

1065
01:35:10,345 --> 01:35:12,586
[SPEAKER_04]: That they're going to be wasting their time and stuff.

1066
01:35:13,066 --> 01:35:17,248
[SPEAKER_04]: They're claiming that Konami of America is going to make an announcement tomorrow.

1067
01:35:17,428 --> 01:35:18,329
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess we'll see.

1068
01:35:18,729 --> 01:35:20,670
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if there's any truth to that rumor.

1069
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:22,451
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see if miracles will ever start.

1070
01:35:22,471 --> 01:35:23,031
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1071
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:30,015
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you've seen how many people in green shirts are going around Golfland now with the racetrack and stuff, they have an evil army.

1072
01:35:30,476 --> 01:35:32,758
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way anything's getting out of there.

1073
01:35:33,038 --> 01:35:35,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you tie yourself to the DDR machine if it was going to be taken away?

1074
01:35:39,053 --> 01:35:41,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Tyne, you know, I think I'd just stick with the Guitar Breaks.

1075
01:35:41,174 --> 01:35:45,737
[SPEAKER_03]: The people would be distracted, no one would be playing, I could get a few games in, it'd be alright.

1076
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:48,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see how they're going to actually pull this off.

1077
01:35:48,938 --> 01:35:54,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how many machines do we have in California alone, let alone the whole United States?

1078
01:35:54,762 --> 01:35:55,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Plenty.

1079
01:35:55,182 --> 01:35:58,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, where the hell are they, what the hell are they going to do with those tournaments, the USA Mixes?

1080
01:35:59,064 --> 01:36:04,467
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can't read the machine locations page on DDR Freak with their tiny Asian eyes, so I don't know how this is going to work out.

1081
01:36:05,256 --> 01:36:05,936
[SPEAKER_11]: That's wrong.

1082
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:06,757
[SPEAKER_11]: That's wrong.

1083
01:36:07,437 --> 01:36:14,921
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, you know, if they're going to do that for Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, why not do it for DDR2?

1084
01:36:15,001 --> 01:36:19,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not go get all those pop music machines, all five of them that we have in the country?

1085
01:36:20,004 --> 01:36:23,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Or, you know, go hunt down Dance Maniacs or the like.

1086
01:36:23,846 --> 01:36:25,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Or, you know, go get the Korean machines.

1087
01:36:25,506 --> 01:36:26,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not, you know, hit them too?

1088
01:36:28,208 --> 01:36:29,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick, they're coming.

1089
01:36:29,188 --> 01:36:30,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the Max 2 and run.

1090
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:34,271
[SPEAKER_04]: You had something you wanted to add, Matt?

1091
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:36,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, never mind.

1092
01:36:36,579 --> 01:36:42,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much, we're being told in the chatroom, they pretty much agree that it seems to sound like a bunch of BS to you guys.

1093
01:36:43,261 --> 01:36:43,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It's poopy!

1094
01:36:44,322 --> 01:36:49,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, DarkTetsuya is offering, though, if anybody wants to come play the Max 3 beta at his house before the cops take it away.

1095
01:36:50,003 --> 01:36:50,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I'm there.

1096
01:36:52,364 --> 01:36:53,804
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for you, DarkTetsuya.

1097
01:36:54,925 --> 01:36:55,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1098
01:36:56,305 --> 01:36:58,246
[SPEAKER_04]: That sound will never get old for me, I'm sorry.

1099
01:36:59,486 --> 01:36:59,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1100
01:37:04,139 --> 01:37:04,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Air!

1101
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:04,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Air!

1102
01:37:31,839 --> 01:37:36,921
[SPEAKER_04]: In two weeks on this show, on the 28th, there's about a 50-50 chance we're going to have a very special guest.

1103
01:37:36,961 --> 01:37:38,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Two very special guests here that night.

1104
01:37:39,002 --> 01:37:43,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say who because it's not confirmed yet, but you'll definitely want to tune in to that show in two weeks.

1105
01:37:43,104 --> 01:37:53,669
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll hopefully have somebody who knows Jamie and I very, very well, who's sure to bring up a lot of dirt on us, and a very famous freestyler also should be here.

1106
01:37:53,889 --> 01:37:56,570
[SPEAKER_21]: You sound like you're actually promoting our show.

1107
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:57,650
[SPEAKER_21]: What's up with that?

1108
01:37:58,230 --> 01:37:59,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, what's up with that?

1109
01:38:00,143 --> 01:38:00,643
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1110
01:38:25,672 --> 01:38:26,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody knows my email address anyway.

1111
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:29,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Your email address is accessible on the website.

1112
01:38:29,997 --> 01:38:31,939
[SPEAKER_11]: All the porn people just love to send me stuff.

1113
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:37,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's see.

1114
01:38:37,544 --> 01:38:40,047
[SPEAKER_04]: What other topics do I have written down here for things we can do?

1115
01:38:42,209 --> 01:38:43,410
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a hold.

1116
01:38:44,031 --> 01:38:44,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait one second.

1117
01:38:47,895 --> 01:38:48,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me pass the mic over.

1118
01:38:50,822 --> 01:38:55,563
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm just reading this off of Konami America's site, totally unrelated to what we were just talking about here.

1119
01:38:56,563 --> 01:39:02,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's talking about that this guy, John Benson and Ward Evans, are DDR fanatics.

1120
01:39:02,905 --> 01:39:07,046
[SPEAKER_02]: They're creators of Dance Machine, a short film about the world's biggest DDR fan.

1121
01:39:07,466 --> 01:39:12,427
[SPEAKER_02]: The movie won the coveted CLAMD or 2002 CLAMDance Film Festival.

1122
01:39:12,467 --> 01:39:13,328
[SPEAKER_02]: The CLAMDance?

1123
01:39:14,148 --> 01:39:15,408
[SPEAKER_02]: In Newport, Rhode Island.

1124
01:39:16,068 --> 01:39:18,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully we'll never see that on video.

1125
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:19,120
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1126
01:39:19,541 --> 01:39:22,923
[SPEAKER_03]: If we have a DDR movie, I have a real good idea for this.

1127
01:39:23,463 --> 01:39:27,866
[SPEAKER_03]: People have been making DDR players, celebrities and stuff.

1128
01:39:27,906 --> 01:39:30,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Corey's in the chat room and he's been getting some of that.

1129
01:39:30,108 --> 01:39:31,769
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Corey's screen name?

1130
01:39:31,789 --> 01:39:32,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk to Corey.

1131
01:39:32,889 --> 01:39:33,410
[SPEAKER_03]: People like that.

1132
01:39:33,650 --> 01:39:37,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that as anyone like Mike, people have heard about this movie.

1133
01:39:37,833 --> 01:39:43,176
[SPEAKER_03]: A little kid finds his shoes, becomes like Michael Jordan, starts dunking on everybody, gets in the NBA.

1134
01:39:43,417 --> 01:39:46,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I want someone to find maybe like Corey's old underpants.

1135
01:39:46,659 --> 01:39:47,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say Corey on the name tag.

1136
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:48,460
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll put them on.

1137
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:59,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Please make me like Cory, and he'll come to the PA competition, maybe the triple threat, you know, start owning everyone, this little scrub that everyone sees playing USA, and just kills everyone, and it's a whole new phenomenon.

1138
01:39:59,345 --> 01:40:02,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he finds out, you know, the underwear wasn't what it is, it was the magic inside.

1139
01:40:02,806 --> 01:40:06,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would make a good... Put down the pipe, Jesus.

1140
01:40:06,368 --> 01:40:08,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember that old business though about DDR Freak the movie?

1141
01:40:09,511 --> 01:40:09,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1142
01:40:09,811 --> 01:40:14,555
[SPEAKER_11]: With all the scripts that floated around that made it into this utter, you know, crappy teeny movie?

1143
01:40:14,915 --> 01:40:15,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

1144
01:40:15,215 --> 01:40:18,738
[SPEAKER_11]: That would have just been, that would have been boycotting that.

1145
01:40:18,798 --> 01:40:21,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this on the show right now, something I haven't told anybody.

1146
01:40:22,822 --> 01:40:26,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm writing a screenplay that involves DDR heavily.

1147
01:40:27,348 --> 01:40:28,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'll say.

1148
01:40:28,769 --> 01:40:30,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have another guest who just walked into the room.

1149
01:40:31,894 --> 01:40:33,175
[SPEAKER_20]: Bongo demands this.

1150
01:40:33,275 --> 01:40:34,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Introduce yourself, new guest.

1151
01:40:35,278 --> 01:40:36,480
[SPEAKER_20]: That's your real self.

1152
01:40:44,475 --> 01:40:46,797
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a bit of a problem with that.

1153
01:40:47,077 --> 01:40:48,359
[SPEAKER_04]: The big gay perilous.

1154
01:40:51,162 --> 01:40:52,443
[SPEAKER_20]: Our token cross-dresser.

1155
01:40:54,965 --> 01:40:55,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, great.

1156
01:40:55,586 --> 01:40:58,669
[SPEAKER_20]: Now I'm forever known as the absolutely gay cross-dresser.

1157
01:40:58,749 --> 01:41:01,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Matt, bring up the official site for that movie thing.

1158
01:41:02,273 --> 01:41:02,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you trying to do that?

1159
01:41:03,754 --> 01:41:05,156
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a click here.

1160
01:41:05,791 --> 01:41:13,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's some, and we're being, one person in the chat room says they did see it and they didn't like it, so your first review is a big thumbs down.

1161
01:41:13,517 --> 01:41:19,161
[SPEAKER_04]: The DDR movie about the biggest DDR fan that won the Clamdance award.

1162
01:41:19,842 --> 01:41:20,722
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a movie?

1163
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:22,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what?

1164
01:41:25,011 --> 01:41:26,972
[SPEAKER_04]: www.johnandward.com We'll bring it up.

1165
01:41:27,132 --> 01:41:32,515
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm even more alarmed that as opposed to there being a movie, there's a clam dance festival.

1166
01:41:33,436 --> 01:41:33,616
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1167
01:41:34,577 --> 01:41:35,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the big news here.

1168
01:41:35,937 --> 01:41:37,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that there's a movie out, but there's a clam dance.

1169
01:41:37,739 --> 01:41:43,502
[SPEAKER_11]: That just makes me think it's like some big, you know, like, lesbian gathering.

1170
01:41:43,542 --> 01:41:45,583
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what brings to mind a clam dance festival?

1171
01:41:47,404 --> 01:41:48,545
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what brings to mind.

1172
01:41:48,805 --> 01:41:50,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that the sound of a dying mutant clam?

1173
01:41:50,846 --> 01:41:51,827
[SPEAKER_04]: A clam opening up.

1174
01:41:52,027 --> 01:41:52,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Roar!

1175
01:41:52,407 --> 01:41:52,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Roar!

1176
01:41:56,304 --> 01:41:59,027
[SPEAKER_11]: When you have the signal, beat like a dying camel.

1177
01:41:59,847 --> 01:42:04,031
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a real fast break and we're going to come back and wrap up the show because we don't have much time left.

1178
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:05,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay with us.

1179
01:42:05,353 --> 01:42:06,313
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a real quick break.

1180
01:42:07,034 --> 01:42:07,795
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back.

1181
01:43:39,912 --> 01:43:40,813
Happy New Year!

1182
01:43:40,853 --> 01:43:41,755
Happy New Year!

01:43:41,815 --> 01:43:43,658
Happy New Year, everybody!

1184
01:43:43,718 --> 01:43:44,620
Happy New Year!

1185
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:45,541
Happy New Year!

1188
01:45:28,232 --> 01:45:29,435
Thank you for watching!

1189
01:47:04,224 --> 01:47:13,150
[SPEAKER_15]: And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse pomani band, Erotic.

1190
01:47:13,591 --> 01:47:14,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it all night.

1191
01:47:14,732 --> 01:47:15,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it with me.

1192
01:47:16,032 --> 01:47:17,453
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, that was awful.

1193
01:47:17,533 --> 01:47:18,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Bloody terrible.

1194
01:47:18,454 --> 01:47:19,775
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you take vocal lessons?

1195
01:47:19,855 --> 01:47:20,836
[SPEAKER_17]: Kill your teacher.

1196
01:47:21,316 --> 01:47:22,317
[SPEAKER_17]: In the heat of the night.

1197
01:47:22,797 --> 01:47:24,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

1198
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:26,840
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked it.

1199
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

1200
01:47:29,002 --> 01:47:29,422
[SPEAKER_18]: Next.

1201
01:47:31,331 --> 01:47:34,134
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, that was cool.

1202
01:47:35,135 --> 01:47:36,878
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you even know why you're here?

1203
01:47:36,898 --> 01:47:38,680
[SPEAKER_19]: That was just bloody pathetic!

1204
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,201
[SPEAKER_19]: Next!

1205
01:47:42,124 --> 01:47:43,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on, do it with me.

1206
01:47:44,527 --> 01:47:44,727
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes!

1207
01:47:45,148 --> 01:47:45,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that's it!

1208
01:47:46,129 --> 01:47:47,211
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a winner!

1209
01:47:48,061 --> 01:47:51,886
[SPEAKER_15]: A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1210
01:47:51,987 --> 01:47:54,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, a star is born every second.

1211
01:47:55,251 --> 01:47:59,356
[SPEAKER_04]: A star being born over there on the other computer in the house.

1212
01:47:59,737 --> 01:48:01,980
[SPEAKER_04]: We were watching that short movie that we were referencing earlier.

1213
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:03,121
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the name of that, Matt?

1214
01:48:04,503 --> 01:48:07,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Machine is also proof that while every moment a star is born every moment a star explodes too

1215
01:48:26,155 --> 01:48:50,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Never have I felt more sorry for mid-age men who think that they're young I've never seen a guy that old playing DDR, that's amazing There's always Kobe Hey, and Nick Nolte owns a DDR machine That's true, that's true Nick Nolte owns one and he takes lots of items too Yeah, but Nick Nolte didn't win, you know, Best Comedy He didn't win the Clam Dance Award In San Francisco, okay

1216
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:54,023
[SPEAKER_11]: The Clam Dance Award is a lesbian award.

1217
01:48:54,564 --> 01:48:57,228
[SPEAKER_11]: So is he like, you know... Is it kind of like Flashdance?

1218
01:48:57,308 --> 01:48:58,330
[SPEAKER_04]: What a feeling.

1219
01:49:01,835 --> 01:49:03,077
[SPEAKER_20]: It's always better with clams.

1220
01:49:04,523 --> 01:49:06,004
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the quote of Ryan for the evening.

1221
01:49:06,604 --> 01:49:12,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Also during that break, I took a chance to look at the newly remodeled 2DX style and I give it my seal of approval.

1222
01:49:12,927 --> 01:49:13,487
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very pretty.

1223
01:49:13,507 --> 01:49:17,650
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a little pretty opening movie when you go into the site and it's all nicely remodeled.

1224
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:19,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So do pay that a visit.

1225
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:21,491
[SPEAKER_04]: That's linked from our links page if you want to check that out.

1226
01:49:21,511 --> 01:49:23,192
[SPEAKER_11]: 2DX style gets the kudos of the evening.

1227
01:49:24,333 --> 01:49:25,493
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go buy you a candy bar, Corey.

1228
01:49:27,114 --> 01:49:31,057
[SPEAKER_04]: and also 3FeetElite, who is the puppeteer.

1229
01:49:31,137 --> 01:49:35,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go buy a box of Kudos and deliver them to you.

1230
01:49:36,501 --> 01:49:39,203
[SPEAKER_04]: They have some nice forums over there.

1231
01:49:39,484 --> 01:49:41,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think the DDR community is too saturated with forums?

1232
01:49:41,625 --> 01:49:42,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there's too many?

1233
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:46,060
[SPEAKER_11]: and so on.

1234
01:50:07,005 --> 01:50:08,226
[SPEAKER_03]: And the uncles you don't talk to much.

1235
01:50:09,027 --> 01:50:10,968
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the uncles you don't talk to, they're kind of crazy.

1236
01:50:11,528 --> 01:50:12,429
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't speak good English.

1237
01:50:13,209 --> 01:50:16,711
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and Sakmamani's just like, Yay, we're happy.

1238
01:50:16,812 --> 01:50:17,872
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't flame on people.

1239
01:50:18,032 --> 01:50:18,813
[SPEAKER_21]: Wee!

1240
01:50:18,913 --> 01:50:20,534
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because we love everybody.

1241
01:50:22,702 --> 01:50:25,143
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't think there's just an overabundance of sites?

1242
01:50:25,223 --> 01:50:28,643
[SPEAKER_04]: What about when boards shut down, like DDR spots did?

1243
01:50:31,064 --> 01:50:37,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think they just thought, you know, maybe this is a little much, there is a lot of boards, or, you know, I'm not on the staff, I don't know what's going on.

1244
01:50:38,065 --> 01:50:40,586
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not something I feel that I can really comment on.

1245
01:50:40,606 --> 01:50:47,547
[SPEAKER_04]: True, I know, we probably can't really say much about it, but I'm just kind of saying, do you think maybe it was too many boards, or...

1246
01:50:48,075 --> 01:50:53,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like, as far as for one purpose, okay, you know, it's hard to get used to that.

1247
01:50:53,177 --> 01:50:56,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Even Ryan.

1248
01:50:56,618 --> 01:51:00,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, sort of like the alternate board used to be GDCon, and people would talk about that and go on there eventually.

1249
01:51:00,939 --> 01:51:03,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sort of got split between that and MonkeySpline and other network.

1250
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:07,563
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of good to have the big, big city, but then it's also good to have a couple little suburbs too that are fun.

1251
01:51:19,851 --> 01:51:25,913
[SPEAKER_11]: My observation with the GDCoon forums is that a lot of people who were booted from DDR Freak ended up there too.

1252
01:51:26,473 --> 01:51:28,434
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was still another place.

1253
01:51:28,654 --> 01:51:38,457
[SPEAKER_11]: The big thing I like about having such a wide selection of forums is that you can see how their community works.

1254
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:40,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Each one of them has their own feel.

1255
01:51:40,958 --> 01:51:43,139
[SPEAKER_11]: You have the one that's a little bit more irreverent.

1256
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:46,020
[SPEAKER_11]: You have your other that's more all-encompassing.

1257
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,981
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Freak I think is more all-encompassing.

1258
01:51:48,021 --> 01:51:49,021
[SPEAKER_11]: I really, really like that.

1259
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:54,443
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we have our little, you know, happy inbred family at Sakumai.

1260
01:51:56,244 --> 01:51:56,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1261
01:51:57,405 --> 01:52:03,029
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, you know, we have, I think we're really getting that good sense of community.

1262
01:52:03,069 --> 01:52:08,452
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really at least hoping that, you know, a lot of the good feelings from back in the old days come back.

1263
01:52:09,333 --> 01:52:11,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about porn there, too.

1264
01:52:11,434 --> 01:52:12,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we talk about porn.

1265
01:52:12,555 --> 01:52:14,076
[SPEAKER_11]: We have our own hentai thread, thank you.

1266
01:52:14,356 --> 01:52:15,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're all going to YaoiCon.

1267
01:52:15,237 --> 01:52:15,557
[SPEAKER_11]: YaoiCon.

1268
01:52:16,584 --> 01:52:16,764
Wee!

1269
01:52:16,824 --> 01:52:18,668
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not going to YaoiCon.

1270
01:52:18,728 --> 01:52:21,072
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what you people are smoking with all the gas.

1271
01:52:21,292 --> 01:52:22,494
[SPEAKER_11]: You're coming to YaoiCon.

1272
01:52:22,514 --> 01:52:23,015
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not!

1273
01:52:23,095 --> 01:52:24,177
[SPEAKER_11]: We're making you dress up.

1274
01:52:24,197 --> 01:52:25,359
[SPEAKER_11]: We're making you cosplay.

1275
01:52:25,519 --> 01:52:26,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, alright.

1276
01:52:26,601 --> 01:52:28,664
[SPEAKER_11]: You get to wear the frilly black lace.

1277
01:52:29,332 --> 01:52:31,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So we like lots of different forums.

1278
01:52:32,013 --> 01:52:33,433
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool to have a lot of different forums.

1279
01:52:33,713 --> 01:52:37,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody has their own different personality, and you just choose to hang out with the people you want to.

1280
01:52:38,314 --> 01:52:40,435
[SPEAKER_04]: One other topic I wanted to bring up.

1281
01:52:42,656 --> 01:52:44,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearing DDR songs in interesting places.

1282
01:52:44,816 --> 01:52:49,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't necessarily mean on the radio, but do you guys ever hear DDR songs in very strange places?

1283
01:52:49,897 --> 01:52:51,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Places you didn't expect to hear them at?

1284
01:52:51,358 --> 01:52:51,818
[SPEAKER_04]: In the mall.

1285
01:52:52,358 --> 01:52:56,340
[SPEAKER_04]: For once, I picked up this CD this week that just happened to have Ordinary World on it.

1286
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:57,020
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very odd.

1287
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like this trans compilation CD, and then all of a sudden there's Ordinary World.

1288
01:52:59,862 --> 01:53:01,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, wow, DDR in my nightmares.

1289
01:53:02,163 --> 01:53:07,285
[SPEAKER_03]: This DJ at one of my school dances was playing all this bad techno music, and all of a sudden Stomp To My Beat comes up, and that's where it's taken.

1290
01:53:07,365 --> 01:53:13,048
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we went over this before, but Stomp To My... Why is everyone shoving two microphones in my face?

1291
01:53:13,128 --> 01:53:15,989
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, I get one, and Jamie's like, here, here, take it, take it.

1292
01:53:16,369 --> 01:53:16,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Get the dual voice effect.

1293
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:19,691
[SPEAKER_11]: When we were all at Brookfield, and I played Stomp To My Beat from the kitchen.

1294
01:53:20,151 --> 01:53:49,515
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and, um, but, we went over this a while ago, and yeah, stomped on my beat, I've heard it a while, but I think that I've listened to DDR music so much, that whenever I think I hear something, I have to take, like, a second, listen to it, because I'm not sure if it's just my mind playing tricks on me, because now I've listened to so much, and some of the stuff sounds so similar, I'm listening to Dropout, and it sounds like, yeah, I'm dead around, or something like that, it's, I, it just doesn't compute, I've listened to so much.

1295
01:53:50,236 --> 01:54:08,057
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's getting more annoying on the idea that you listen to the radio and some of this DDR stuff comes on or you have a CD where you're listening to the DDR stuff comes on you don't know which is getting pulled from which because I know Stomp to My Beat was a pretty popular techno song before it got pulled into DDR so I'm wondering if more isn't coming along those lines

1296
01:54:08,883 --> 01:54:14,247
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also sad that, you know, with some of us being the ages that we are, that we actually remember the original songs.

1297
01:54:14,287 --> 01:54:20,351
[SPEAKER_11]: They were like, I remember the original Sky High that was redone by DJ Miko.

1298
01:54:21,251 --> 01:54:34,180
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, even being an anime fan, I will sit and listen to Freckles and the Japanese lyrics, like the opening to Rurouni Kenshin goes in my head, and the original Hot Limit by TM Revolution, which, by the way, everybody should listen to because it's awesome.

1299
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:34,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1300
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:37,702
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I had the weirdest thing happen.

1301
01:54:37,983 --> 01:54:47,470
[SPEAKER_21]: I was watching MTV for, like, the once in, like, the last two years, and I heard Oops, I Did It Again, and it's so weird that they ripped off, like, DDR Fifth Mix.

1302
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:47,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up!

1303
01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:49,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I have no idea why.

1304
01:54:49,591 --> 01:54:49,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Boo!

1305
01:54:50,972 --> 01:54:53,574
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's just like, whoa.

1306
01:54:54,895 --> 01:54:56,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Oops, He Did It Again.

1307
01:54:57,217 --> 01:54:58,218
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, that song was cool.

1308
01:54:58,878 --> 01:55:02,541
[SPEAKER_11]: You know... Anyway... It's just, you know...

1309
01:55:03,519 --> 01:55:10,862
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that not only are our lives, I guess, influenced by Behmany, but, you know, Behmany is influenced by the way that the world has been, too.

1310
01:55:12,182 --> 01:55:13,883
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the music has evolved.

1311
01:55:14,363 --> 01:55:16,323
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's evolved with, you know, people's tastes.

1312
01:55:16,363 --> 01:55:17,544
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it evolves with the times.

1313
01:55:17,624 --> 01:55:24,026
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, that's another really cool thing is that you're more likely now to hear something that's been in a Behmany game.

1314
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:24,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Dornan

1315
01:55:52,876 --> 01:55:54,541
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the Mattel Chocobot Hour.

1316
01:55:54,922 --> 01:55:55,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1317
01:55:57,850 --> 01:55:58,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other comments?

1318
01:55:58,730 --> 01:56:00,351
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I think we're going to wrap up the show here.

1319
01:56:00,791 --> 01:56:02,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to everybody for listening.

1320
01:56:02,111 --> 01:56:03,452
[SPEAKER_04]: We have got a really good turnout tonight.

1327
01:56:16,756 --> 01:56:19,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at 9 o'clock, we bring you a classic show.

1328
01:56:19,717 --> 01:56:24,259
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go ahead and replay the first episode this week for those that missed it.

1329
01:56:25,399 --> 01:56:29,203
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to thank all of my friends who said that they'd be listening in tonight.

1330
01:56:29,403 --> 01:56:31,625
[SPEAKER_11]: And for our two listeners in Japan.

1331
01:56:31,645 --> 01:56:34,908
[SPEAKER_20]: We have listeners in Japan?

1332

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we have listeners in Japan.

1335
01:56:44,777 --> 01:56:45,878
[SPEAKER_11]: The coast in your own mind.

01:57:09,491 --> 01:57:15,153
[SPEAKER_02]: So now Rob, are we going to be adding that list of songs we would like to hear in Bimani?

1341
01:57:15,293 --> 01:57:17,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember we were talking about that.

1342
01:57:18,354 --> 01:57:22,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a couple weeks ago we were talking about the songs that we think should be in Bimani that aren't yet.

1343
01:57:22,675 --> 01:57:24,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, some of those songs do show up.

1344
01:57:24,716 --> 01:57:30,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie and I put in a pick a week on the music stuff and we'll be adding some of the stuff that was talked about that show also.

1345
01:57:30,518 --> 01:57:33,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows, perhaps we can make that a contest for the future.

1346

1350
01:57:44,241 --> 01:57:45,201
[SPEAKER_04]: If it should be, why?

1351
01:57:45,801 --> 01:57:46,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us know and then tell us.

1352

1355
01:57:53,243 --> 01:57:53,783
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it.

1356
01:57:54,723 --> 01:57:57,304

1357
01:57:58,644 --> 01:57:59,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's about it.

1358
01:57:59,504 --> 01:58:01,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else have any closing words?

1359
01:58:01,365 --> 01:58:04,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks all of you for being here, Ryan, even though you were only here 15 minutes.

1363
01:58:09,568 --> 01:58:11,088
[SPEAKER_20]: Bongo demands it.

1364
01:58:11,788 --> 01:58:15,290
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that only one cuss word was said this entire show.

1365
01:58:16,110 --> 01:58:16,730
[SPEAKER_21]: And I said it.

1366
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:18,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you care to remedy that situation then, Dave?

1367
01:58:19,811 --> 01:58:24,733
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I can't copy Brad because last time he was just busting out.

1368
01:58:26,701 --> 01:58:27,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Shitty Poopy.
