03:50.200 --> 03:53.200
We're going to break. I'll be right back.

04:50.200 --> 04:57.200
just a step back

05:20.200 --> 05:24.200
You, you, you, you, you, you

05:50.200 --> 05:57.200
You're a iconic mystery.

06:04.200 --> 06:09.200
You're a iconic mystery.

It's turning you with our hopes, you've been a

08:04.000 --> 08:09.360
We'll be together in love, and then we'll be fine

08:10.720 --> 08:15.120
Sometimes when you feel like the world

08:15.120 --> 08:18.240
It's turning without you

08:18.240 --> 08:22.240
And you believe it won't make it

08:22.240 --> 08:24.720
Cause you're all alone

08:24.720 --> 08:28.080
There's somebody here for you

08:28.080 --> 08:30.000
Do you feel it too?

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Tell me do you love somebody, need somebody

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Know that everything will be fine

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Know that everything will be fine

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
It's all of the same when the sun shines on everyone but you

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
Just open your heart to open and the light comes your way

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000

09:52.000 --> 10:19.320
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

10:19.320 --> 10:22.440
favourite perverse Bomani band, E-Erotic.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.120
Do it all night. Do it with me.

10:25.120 --> 10:30.120
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible. Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher!

10:30.120 --> 10:31.720
In the heat of the night.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.320
Oh God, I think my ears are bleeding.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.320
I liked it.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.120
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next!

10:39.120 --> 10:44.120
Oh, that was cool.

10:44.120 --> 10:48.520
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic. Next!

10:48.520 --> 10:53.520
Come with me, man. Come on, do it with me.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.520
Yes! Yes, that's it! We have a winner!

10:56.520 --> 11:01.520
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

11:01.520 --> 11:05.520
Every Sunday night, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.520
You're repeating yourself.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.520
You are listening. I know. I like to repeat myself.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.520
I think a star just fell out of the sky at the time.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.520
It landed on somebody.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.520
If a star is falling, though, shouldn't she be making a wish on it?

11:14.520 --> 11:16.520
Yeah, at least she don't fall on me.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.520
Quite the optimistic, aren't we?

11:20.520 --> 11:23.520
Oh, Jamie's been having a Pessimism Week. It's fun.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.520
Does that mean we need to start off with your F.U. of the Week?

11:25.520 --> 11:26.520
Hmm.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.520
All right, I think we need to start off with Jamie's F.U. of the Week.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.520
Oh.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.520
Are you ready to give your F.U. of the Week?

11:32.520 --> 11:33.520
I have a primary topic.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.520
You have a primary topic.

11:34.520 --> 11:40.520
Well, all right, then I present to you, Jamie's F.U. of the Week.

11:40.520 --> 11:45.520
My F.U. of the Week is directed toward the lovely Korean servers of Ragnarok Online.

11:45.520 --> 11:52.520
Okay, I'm sure people who read my live journal, who know me, know that I've gotten addicted to this game as of late.

11:52.520 --> 11:58.520
I was happy, I was having a good week, I got goggles, which you can't get on the current beta, I traded half my armor for it.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.520
And what do goggles do?

11:59.520 --> 12:00.520
They just look cool.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.520
Okay.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.520
They do, seriously, all they do is look cool.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.520
And, um...

12:05.520 --> 12:06.520
Jamie has to be cool.

12:06.520 --> 12:07.520
Heaven forbid, Jamie's uncool.

12:07.520 --> 12:13.520
I got a one in ten thousand chance item that each creature will drop that one in every ten thousand creatures will drop one.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.520
I got a card, sold it, got more goggles, sold that, got more money.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.520
Now this is Ragnarok or EverQuest?

12:19.520 --> 12:20.520
This is Ragnarok online.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.520
Ragnarok? It sounded like EverQuest here.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.520
No, this is my own crack. I do not play EverQuest.

12:25.520 --> 12:30.520
Anyway, so I'm all happy and looking forward to getting levels and the server goes down.

12:30.520 --> 12:35.520
And then the server comes back up after I try to sign on to the damn game for an hour.

12:35.520 --> 12:40.520
And then the character server goes down so I try to log on and hey, my character's missing, yay!

12:40.520 --> 12:48.520
By the way, for people who do play, if you see that the characters are not showing up, if you make a new one, you will never get your old character back. Isn't that nice?

12:48.520 --> 13:01.520
So, I've been sitting here now for a couple days, not being able to play Ragnarok because either the character server is down, or the main server is down, or just want me to log in, or this other crap.

13:01.520 --> 13:07.520
And so, I'm just ready to say screw it, except I am an addict.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.520
Now, do you have any other FUs of the week?

13:09.520 --> 13:11.520
Duploeb, damn them.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.520
I hate Duploeb.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.520
Any particular week?

13:15.520 --> 13:22.520
Duploeb, you know how they make Duploeb locks for small children or people who ride the short bus?

13:22.520 --> 13:23.520
Yes.

13:23.520 --> 13:29.520
Duploeb is like that, except it's for, you know, lobotomized newborns.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.520
That's how stupid you have to be to go with Duploeb.

13:33.520 --> 13:37.420
And me, you know, they did such a good job the first time we had Sacre Mani up.

13:37.420 --> 13:42.380
And then, they've been just utter poopy heads lately, you know?

13:42.380 --> 13:46.600
Yes, I'm being filtered.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.440
It's our new Orange Lounge Language Filter 2000.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.320
I figured I used up all of my-

13:51.320 --> 13:52.320
That's a bunch of bullpoopy!

13:52.320 --> 13:55.760
That's ALF, but you know a movie.

13:55.760 --> 14:02.040
I figured I used up, you know, all of my fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fucks last week,

14:02.040 --> 14:08.320
So I'm gonna be nice today, so fuck them up their asses!

14:08.320 --> 14:09.320
And...

14:09.320 --> 14:10.320
I hate them.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.320
They contain adult language.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.320
They need to die!

14:12.320 --> 14:15.760
They need to go to hell and die there.

14:15.760 --> 14:19.520
So if anybody wants to give me money, do it now.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.520
So I can buy a new shirt.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.840
And we'll have a thank you next week.

14:21.840 --> 14:22.840
Yes!

14:22.840 --> 14:28.400
Whoever decides to give me money, I will not do a fuck you in your direction thank you.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.040
And that's it for your fuck you of the week?

14:30.040 --> 14:31.400
I'll think of something else in a minute.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.480
Well I have an F.U. of the week.

14:33.480 --> 14:36.040
I have to play my F.U. of the week theme song.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.760
Because my F.U. of the week...

14:38.760 --> 14:42.720
Because when I start complaining I sound like a chicken, so I have to play this song.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.440
My F.U. of the week

14:44.440 --> 14:50.320
is traffic in San Francisco, especially around the 101-80 junction area.

14:50.320 --> 14:55.320
What a piece of shit. I mean, people there cannot drive at all. They don't know what lane they're supposed to be in.

14:55.320 --> 15:00.320
Doesn't that feel like an F.U. like forever, not just for the week?

15:00.320 --> 15:03.280
Well it pissed me off this week in particular because I was trying to come home today because

15:03.280 --> 15:06.880
I moved, for those that don't know, I moved the show out of the little tiny room into

15:06.880 --> 15:10.080
the big living room tonight because I knew we'd be having more guests.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.160
And I had about, oh probably about 20 minutes to move the computer out here into the big

15:13.160 --> 15:14.160
room because of traffic.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.720
I'd hoped to have a couple hours.

15:16.720 --> 15:17.760
That didn't quite end up happening.

15:17.760 --> 15:21.480
So my FPU of the week is people who can't drive and cause me to get home late.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.880
You know, I don't foresee that getting any better because people are getting dumber and

15:24.880 --> 15:28.560
dumber and dumber as, you know, time goes on.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.480
We're going to eventually have to evolve from a fuck you of the week to a, you know, a fuck

15:32.480 --> 15:37.000
you with a rabbit horse of the week.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Rabbit horse.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yes.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.640
Irene is talking about a rabbit horse.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.640
The rabbit horse.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.780
What am I doing?

15:46.780 --> 15:49.240
It's the rabbit horse with big sharp pointy teeth.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.240
Arr.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.240
Okay, worst radio ever.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.040
You don't make signs with your hands.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.040
They can't see them.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.660
No.

15:56.660 --> 16:00.140
We don't care what they see, because they don't see it with you.

16:00.140 --> 16:01.460
We're doing this show to entertain ourselves.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.460
Yeah!

16:02.460 --> 16:03.460
To hell with you!

16:03.460 --> 16:05.420
I'm just kidding, stay connected, please, we need ratings.

16:05.420 --> 16:08.260
Don't go anywhere.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.980
We actually care, we just pretend otherwise.

16:11.980 --> 16:16.580
You know, it's cool to not give a shit, so that's what we're doing here tonight.

16:16.580 --> 16:17.580
Yeah.

16:17.580 --> 16:20.820
Anyway, let's start to our guests, shall we?

16:20.820 --> 16:23.880
Let's save this trainwreck show and talk to the new blood here tonight.

16:23.880 --> 16:27.520
We have some guests, and I'm scooting over to get near the guests.

16:27.520 --> 16:31.040
Everybody say hello to Melody and Mel B. Hi.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.820
So what are you kids doing in town this week?

16:33.820 --> 16:36.480
I don't think that can be put on the radio, sorry.

16:36.480 --> 16:40.600
I mean, what brings you to Sacramento this week?

16:40.600 --> 16:45.480
We just had to see all you wonderful people.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.480
Such a freaking suck-up.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.720
You're trying to make me clean house.

16:48.720 --> 16:49.960
Yeah, I know.

16:49.960 --> 16:53.240
You only showed up so we'd all clean our houses, basically.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.640
My mother sent you.

16:54.640 --> 16:59.880
Damn, my evil plot has been foiled.

16:59.880 --> 17:00.880
Dear God.

17:00.880 --> 17:05.920
Anyway, um, I'm trying to think, uh, what, what else has been going on lately?

17:05.920 --> 17:08.240
We could talk to Melody and Mel B. How about the CVGL?

17:08.240 --> 17:10.960
You guys are the only ones that are at this big tournament at CVGL last week.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.440
What'd you guys think of it?

17:12.440 --> 17:16.240
Uh, from a freestyle perspective, I would probably rank this as one of the top two or

17:16.240 --> 17:21.080
three freestyle competitions I've ever been to, probably, arguably in America.

17:21.080 --> 17:25.520
It was definitely just, you could have taken the top 15 people out there, they probably

17:25.520 --> 17:30.560
would have placed in any other run of the mill tourney last year.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.600
Bar has gone sky high.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.640
So you think every other tournament now is going to have to live up to this?

17:35.640 --> 17:38.560
It would be unfair, but I would not be surprised.

17:38.560 --> 17:42.280
Good thing about it is, you still have the vets that are coming out there, guys like

17:42.280 --> 17:45.960
Trampower, Lil B, and all that, they're still doing their thing, they're living up to their

17:45.960 --> 17:49.440
reputations, but you have a lot of people coming up from Scandia, from out of state,

17:49.440 --> 17:56.540
There was a kid from Omaha who absolutely wrecked shop out there and they're the new blood and they're still experiencing all this great freestyle

17:56.540 --> 18:00.380
Hype, they're still you know in love with the game in as long as we get those new people up in there

18:00.380 --> 18:05.960
And they're busting their ass. I mean dude. It's gonna be a positive thing for freestyle in general in tourneys

18:06.540 --> 18:10.260
Right on what do you think of the German melody just going to watch and yeah?

18:10.260 --> 18:12.260
How many do you go to a lot of tournaments or I?

18:12.820 --> 18:15.080
Get dragged to a lot of tournaments most of the time

18:15.080 --> 18:20.500
Honestly, this time I did not see a single freestyle because management

18:20.500 --> 18:25.460
sucked ass. They refused to move the machine outside. They created a huge fire

18:25.460 --> 18:31.460
hazard indoors. If any of you have been to Castro Valley, it's very small. There

18:31.460 --> 18:35.700
is a small inner room that has the DDR machine and they did not move the damn

18:35.700 --> 18:39.980
machine outside. So it was too dang crowded and the air conditioning was not

18:39.980 --> 18:44.540
working inside either. So management was just being very hard to deal with and

18:44.540 --> 18:47.540
You're getting into an F.U. of the week there.

18:47.540 --> 18:55.540
Okay, well, this would be my F.U. of the millennium, probably, but hey, we had many run-ins with the manager of Castro Valley.

18:55.540 --> 19:00.540
For someone who agreed to hold a tournament, he should have been a lot more accommodating.

19:00.540 --> 19:04.540
I believe Mel was waving desperately, wanting to throw another comment in there.

19:04.540 --> 19:10.540
Oh, and I guess I'd have to do a quick F.U. to an 8-ball, because he was the one that chickened out of a judges-only freestyle tournament.

19:10.540 --> 19:15.220
There was gonna be some money on the line, but his excuse to attorney director who you know approached me

19:15.220 --> 19:19.580
He said you want to a freestyle tournament for judges. I'm like hell yeah, and he said well

19:19.580 --> 19:23.380
I won't have anything in time or according to from what I heard around the grapevine

19:24.180 --> 19:28.740
Apparently he thought whatever prize. He was going to get was not worth risking his reputation over

19:30.100 --> 19:32.100
Okay, right

19:34.820 --> 19:37.960
So who are some of the new new freestylers you guys think are

19:37.960 --> 19:44.960
We're going to be hearing about in the next two tournaments just doing awesome jobs and people you might never have heard about that maybe you should start paying attention to.

19:44.960 --> 19:50.960
Well, I think the biggest contingent of freestyles that are blowing up are the ones from Scandia.

19:50.960 --> 20:01.960
That would be guys like Hypnox, he's been around, but he's got guys like Lou Stiles who's absolutely amazing. Anyone who thinks 8-Ball or Dinkot are good pop-blockers, this guy has just taken it to a higher level.

20:01.960 --> 20:09.960
He's got Bruce Leroy, he's one of the most charismatic guys out there, and just for people

20:09.960 --> 20:14.000
in general, there was that kid from Omaha I told you about, his name was Tequila, he

20:14.000 --> 20:19.040
just recently joined RTF, which you may or may not know as my crew returned to freestyle.

20:19.040 --> 20:23.760
He was that good that practically after his first routine, guys just wanted him, swept

20:23.760 --> 20:27.520
him up, and he's made quite an impression on everybody.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.960
Tell us a little more about RTF, because that's kind of a, you know, a big, pretty well-known...

20:30.960 --> 20:35.040
Oh, he's going to give you the whole spiel here, give us a breakdown, because anything

20:35.040 --> 20:37.320
else you want to plug here while you're on the show, go for it.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.720
But tell us a little something about RTF, and how it all started, and what it stands

20:40.720 --> 20:41.720
for and all that.

20:41.720 --> 20:42.720
All right.

20:42.720 --> 20:46.600
Well, for a quick rundown of the history, RTF started around January of 2001.

20:46.600 --> 20:50.280
It was actually Turner Rochi, the tournament at Metreon.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.480
It was about the time when people...

20:52.480 --> 20:57.260
We got sick of DDR USA, and people at freestyle tournaments weren't really putting up a good

20:57.260 --> 21:01.420
effort they were just sort of improving on stage you wouldn't put in any time

21:01.420 --> 21:04.220
or thought into it and so one of my friends was like don't you remember back

21:04.220 --> 21:06.820
when we actually used to bust ass on freestyle when we actually used to be

21:06.820 --> 21:10.660
creative and you know give a damn and I thought about and although I wasn't one

21:10.660 --> 21:14.460
of those guilty people you know he was just saying yeah we have to go back to

21:14.460 --> 21:17.100
our roots and I was like yeah I'm all for it we gotta return to freestyle and

21:17.100 --> 21:20.620
so the name kind of stuck no it was a lot better than like the Foot Clan or

21:20.620 --> 21:25.940
you know something else that was already taken and so from there you know we just

21:25.940 --> 21:31.940
I just got a few people, at first it was like Shintenshi Mi, Mike Noe, Asian Innovation, then Brand came along.

21:31.940 --> 21:35.940
A few people, and then I think our first major tournament was the Arcade Infinity 2 tourney.

21:35.940 --> 21:37.940
That's when we took Solo 2K.

21:41.940 --> 21:45.940
No, we do not need a Solo sucks anyway, comment.

21:45.940 --> 21:48.940
Yeah, besides, don't you know the new catchphrase is, this DDR sucks?

21:48.940 --> 21:50.940
Yes.

21:50.940 --> 21:55.940
So yeah, that's just pretty much RTF in a nutshell. We like to have a good time.

21:55.940 --> 22:01.940
We're all about just good times and all that stuff. Freestyle is just, you know, one of the things we happen to like to do.

22:01.940 --> 22:08.940
As for other plugs, well, DDR Spot, of course, is the site that I helped run along with a couple of the RTF members.

22:08.940 --> 22:13.940
We're about to do kind of a new thing. We got a lot of new stuff coming on right now.

22:13.940 --> 22:19.940
Interviews with Jason Eno is doing stuff about we're usually breaking news with imports and all that kind of stuff

22:19.940 --> 22:24.940
were affiliated with Team Guilo and Bemoniac, so we got a good base of connections. And

22:24.940 --> 22:30.420
uh, basically, keep coming to the site, we're adding a lot of new stuff daily, and who knows,

22:30.420 --> 22:32.980
you just might get knocked on your ass the next time you get there.

22:32.980 --> 22:35.860
Sounds pretty good. Anything you want to plug while you're here, Melody?

22:35.860 --> 22:36.860
Whee!

22:36.860 --> 22:43.780
Alright, thank you, well put! You got nothing to plug but your ego today, it's just I'm

22:43.780 --> 22:46.420
here, I'm here because I rule. That's why you're here.

22:46.420 --> 22:49.100
Well, everyone knew that already, though.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.620
melody all these rules

22:51.620 --> 22:56.460
my bad i'm sorry excuse me ma'am

22:56.460 --> 22:57.400
speaking i

22:57.400 --> 23:00.940
i noticed that you took a interesting trip out to omaha lately you you

23:00.940 --> 23:03.900
actually went out to help kinda i were you running a tournament out there what

23:03.900 --> 23:04.880
was the deal with that

23:04.880 --> 23:07.820
uh... yeah actually it's a funny story because

23:07.820 --> 23:11.940
i had a friend at tequila actually he caught me on uh... i am or basically on

23:11.940 --> 23:12.860
the three ports

23:12.860 --> 23:15.900
he was saying that their first freestyle tournament that they had absolutely

23:15.900 --> 23:19.300
stuck because the judge was terrible he showed me a videotape of what they did

23:19.300 --> 23:22.340
and he was clearly more talented than everyone else and he ended up taking thirds

23:22.340 --> 23:25.320
so I was like dang you need someone to really run an attorney well

23:25.320 --> 23:29.260
and uh... he said well why don't you come out here and show them how it's done

23:29.260 --> 23:30.700
and I was like

23:30.700 --> 23:31.660
me compete?

23:31.660 --> 23:33.840
and he's like yeah I said well if I had the money sure

23:33.840 --> 23:37.720
and he had a few friends who offered me a whole bunch of ways to come out there

23:37.720 --> 23:39.000
and compete I was like

23:39.000 --> 23:40.260
wait a minute you gonna

23:40.260 --> 23:42.380
pay my way to kick your ass?

23:42.380 --> 23:44.420
I'm like something just didn't register

23:44.420 --> 23:47.420
For a moment, you know, I actually had scruples and I felt bad about it.

23:47.420 --> 23:51.420
So I was like, tell you what, you take that money, you let me run your tournament,

23:51.420 --> 23:54.420
you know, give you the California experience, you probably won't get anywhere else.

23:54.420 --> 23:57.420
And that's kind of, you know, how it ran from there, went to their arcade out there.

23:57.420 --> 24:00.420
And surprisingly enough for an arcade in the Midwest,

24:00.420 --> 24:03.420
you would think they won't have that much to be money or just be that good.

24:03.420 --> 24:06.420
I would say it's probably the most impressive arcade I've been to, like, three levels.

24:06.420 --> 24:10.420
One level is just pure retro with, like, Kung Fu Master, Karate Champ.

24:10.420 --> 24:14.420
And I'm like, a place that has karate chimp, man, how can you beat that?

24:14.420 --> 24:16.560
And Popeye and all that good stuff.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.020
And their bimani was really well stacked.

24:18.020 --> 24:21.300
In fact, that's the only place in America I know that has a linked pada-pada-to-second

24:21.300 --> 24:22.300
mix.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.300
I was blown away.

24:23.300 --> 24:28.780
And it was actually just nice to get out there and just see how bimani's just really blown

24:28.780 --> 24:33.860
up everywhere in the smallest nook and cranny of America.

24:33.860 --> 24:36.660
I kind of noticed this might be starting to be a trend here, because I know I was reading

24:36.660 --> 24:39.720
another story, another freestyle that went out to I think New York or something to help

24:39.720 --> 24:43.860
run a tournament lately. I don't know if that was 8-Ball or something. Was it? Baltimore.

24:43.860 --> 24:49.280
8-Ball did go out to a tournament in, I believe it was Baltimore, Maryland, but he was actually

24:49.280 --> 24:52.680
judging it from what I understand. Do you think this is an interesting trend that seems

24:52.680 --> 24:56.060
to be developing where people from the West Coast are kind of running all over the nation

24:56.060 --> 25:05.060
to be competing and judging and running tournaments? It's a plague. It's a plague. Actually, I

25:05.060 --> 25:09.200
think it's just really a matter of promoting money in general because they know Californians,

25:09.200 --> 25:17.200
We've been out here since the beginning and a lot of us are well known throughout the community and they think drawing in the name won't draw those hardcore fans come out there.

25:17.200 --> 25:22.200
I said people like that girl from New York, Jen, she came out here twice and twice she's placed.

25:22.200 --> 25:30.200
So it shows that people want to come out here or go out there because they love the game and they just want to get out there against the best.

25:30.200 --> 25:34.500
Do you guys think it's ever feasible? I know this is kind of one of those topics that's

25:34.500 --> 25:38.320
one of those like on the popular message boards comes up probably once a month or whatever.

25:38.320 --> 25:42.200
Do you guys think it's feasible to one day have like a national DDR tournament?

25:42.200 --> 25:46.040
Oh, anything's feasible. It's just a matter of actually putting in some manpower and a

25:46.040 --> 25:51.360
lot of money behind it. But if they really want it, it can happen. You know, I think

25:51.360 --> 25:55.540
there's enough educated people out there who can judge a freestyle or, you know, set up

25:55.540 --> 26:01.460
some kind of almost foolproof rules for PA. It's very feasible. I think people just have

26:01.460 --> 26:04.980
to have the money more than anything.

26:04.980 --> 26:08.240
Where would you like to see that held? Because personally, I'd be rooting for Vegas because

26:08.240 --> 26:12.060
just Vegas rules and they've got tons of stuff to do there. But of course, if you're under

26:12.060 --> 26:13.580
21, it kind of sucks.

26:13.580 --> 26:18.940
We actually had a good crowd, believe it or not, actually in Gulfport, Mississippi. They

26:18.940 --> 26:22.860
have pretty large arcade facilities and some of the casinos there. And of course, you don't

26:22.860 --> 26:28.320
have to be, you know, over 18 to get into the arcades there. Lots of space, too, and

26:28.320 --> 26:33.520
a really good crowd. Anybody else got any questions or anything?

26:33.520 --> 26:37.280
Did everybody run away to go play sixth style, or what's going on? Seems like there's a missing

26:37.280 --> 26:41.880
thing. Anybody else got any questions, things to say? No? Paul's all, you guys.

26:41.880 --> 26:44.760
Is this sixth style here? Paul's like, you got sixth style? Yes, it's

26:44.760 --> 26:51.320
in the other room. Go play.

26:51.320 --> 26:54.960
What else do you think would be able to hold a good tourney?

26:54.960 --> 26:58.920
I think Vegas is probably the most popular choice.

26:58.920 --> 27:02.840
I would say L.A. would probably be your next big choice because everyone loves California.

27:02.840 --> 27:06.440
E3 is out there, obviously that's like the entertainment mecca.

27:06.440 --> 27:11.320
So I would think pretty much your main metropolitan, L.A., New York, Chicago would be your top

27:11.320 --> 27:12.320
three choices.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.120
Seattle would be pretty cool too.

27:14.120 --> 27:17.800
I agree and Seattle's got a lot of really good perfect attack players there too and

27:17.800 --> 27:21.720
they'd be able to probably come up with a really good system, I think, for PA as well.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.840
Read in some stuff that they did for a recent tournament of theirs. Sounds like it could

27:24.840 --> 27:28.160
be fun. It almost sounded like a game show, the way they had it laid out, where people

27:28.160 --> 27:32.400
are taking off songs and putting them back on, and all they needed to do was have a trivia

27:32.400 --> 27:33.400
challenge.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.400
You know what I think would be awesome?

27:34.400 --> 27:35.600
No, they don't vote people out.

27:35.600 --> 27:43.200
Is to rent a small stadium, like a baseball-type stadium, and get up a big monitor.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.640
You think they could seriously fill one of those?

27:44.640 --> 27:51.220
Well I'm not saying like a large one, well you know honestly if we had a tourney that

27:51.220 --> 27:55.180
was a national event that would probably be the prime way to do it, would be to have the

27:55.180 --> 27:59.220
machines out there and have a large monitor.

27:59.220 --> 28:02.860
Actually from some of the footage I've seen like in Japan back in 98 or 99 some of their

28:02.860 --> 28:08.120
major tournaments were actually held inside like amphitheaters, inside like concert halls

28:08.120 --> 28:11.000
that kind of thing, there was like an actual stage, there were like spotlights everywhere

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
like it was a big production, I have a few videos of that and it looks like a really

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
happening thing.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.740
It's certainly been being sucked away in a corner of an arcade.

28:21.740 --> 28:25.620
What if a place like Great America, Paramounts, I'm thinking Paramounts Great America because

28:25.620 --> 28:30.280
when I see that there's some videos that go around the net that happen to be pumping up,

28:30.280 --> 28:33.520
but when I see those videos I'm kind of reminded it looks like an atmosphere where it's kind

28:33.520 --> 28:38.900
of like Great America's little amphitheater which is a fairly good size but it's not huge.

28:38.900 --> 28:43.340
Well part of that is also the organization of the tournament, so from what I learned

28:43.340 --> 28:47.980
from a friend who's in Korea, Pump It Up is actually like, not just an arcade phenomenon,

28:47.980 --> 28:51.860
it's actually things where like YMCAs would actually have Pump It Up teams and like my

28:51.860 --> 28:55.420
friend, he actually had a Pump It Up teacher that he went to, taught him all this stuff

28:55.420 --> 28:59.520
so like they had these factions from different parts of town, they go to these huge events

28:59.520 --> 29:03.220
and that's, and really, a lot of it's not even a contest, it's just an exhibition of

29:03.220 --> 29:08.060
people showing off what they can do on different songs, that's part of what DDR is gonna need,

29:08.060 --> 29:13.660
It's going to need backing from other companies or little factions that have the means to

29:13.660 --> 29:17.940
get publicity, to get money, and so forth to have these huge events out of Great America,

29:17.940 --> 29:20.940
you know, the amphitheater or wherever.

29:20.940 --> 29:23.700
What would you think of an exhibition style tournament?

29:23.700 --> 29:28.020
I mean, just to have an invitational exhibition style tourney?

29:28.020 --> 29:29.860
Oh, I think it would be great.

29:29.860 --> 29:34.740
I mean, it's gotten to the point where prizes are great and all, but really what it boils

29:34.740 --> 29:39.180
down to is you could really weed out the people who really love the freestyle and just love

29:39.180 --> 29:40.180
the crowds.

29:40.180 --> 29:43.280
It would be just cool to have an exhibition go out there and just do this, say, you know,

29:43.280 --> 29:47.780
we're doing it for fun, we're doing it for prizes, we just, you know, want to entertain.

29:47.780 --> 29:51.240
And I was also thinking, you know, what about like a, you know how they have the People's

29:51.240 --> 29:52.460
Choice Awards?

29:52.460 --> 29:54.860
What about a People's Choice style tournament?

29:54.860 --> 29:55.860
Have crowd voting?

29:55.860 --> 30:00.860
Um, I know 8-Ball wouldn't win.

30:00.860 --> 30:01.860
That was wrong.

30:01.860 --> 30:05.860
The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio?

30:05.860 --> 30:10.860
Well, you know, I mean, I'm all about the dirt and all that kind of stuff.

30:10.860 --> 30:13.860
If you don't hear it from me, you're going to hear it from someone else.

30:13.860 --> 30:18.860
But I got love for him. It's like, you know, from a competitive standpoint, I want to kick everyone's ass, everyone's anatomy.

30:18.860 --> 30:23.860
But afterwards, hey, we'll knock down a beer and, you know, we'll let you gloat about what you did ten years ago, but hey.

30:23.860 --> 30:32.420
And you kind of have this gasp look of surprise on your face, Molly, anything you want to

30:32.420 --> 30:33.420
add?

30:33.420 --> 30:37.340
That wasn't surprise, that was agreement, Zach.

30:37.340 --> 30:44.220
We won't bring up the event from last night.

30:44.220 --> 30:46.060
Inside jokes here tonight.

30:46.060 --> 30:47.060
Oh yes.

30:47.060 --> 30:48.060
Did you have something you wanted to say, Matt?

30:48.060 --> 30:50.940
I thought I saw your hand like halfway up in the air.

30:50.940 --> 31:04.940
I was just going to say, I was reading on the DDR East Coast Invasion boards that J. Dog went to help determine Florida at some point, but I believe it was someone from the DDR Creek boards that I recognized that went to Florida to help determine.

31:04.940 --> 31:12.940
I didn't hear about a Florida tournament, you know what I mean, I don't keep tight taps on everyone, but I wouldn't be surprised, J. Dog's a pretty big man in demand, you know.

31:12.940 --> 31:15.940
It was Florida or Atlanta, I can't remember.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.940
Well, if it comes to Atlanta, usually it's Inouan.

31:18.940 --> 31:23.940
He used to do a lot of stuff. He ran a tournament in Atlanta about a year or two ago when he was actually living there.

31:23.940 --> 31:30.940
Yeah, all I know is they just love him over in the East Coast. I was trying to get him to listen to the show and plug in.

31:30.940 --> 31:35.940
I guess that's a good question. How do you feel about fanboys and fangirls?

31:35.940 --> 31:41.400
I mean, because DDR, it's like, you know, you're bound to get some fans to download

31:41.400 --> 31:46.080
your videos online, you're fairly well-known freestyler and stuff, and people kind of like

31:46.080 --> 31:49.520
start to get to know you, or you know, want to know more about you and what have you.

31:49.520 --> 31:54.560
Do you think that's kind of weird for being a fan over DDR, or how do you feel about the

31:54.560 --> 31:56.320
whole phenomenon?

31:56.320 --> 31:59.600
I think everyone's a fanboy or fangirl of someone that they love.

31:59.600 --> 32:03.560
I mean, you know, jeez, if I were to meet, like, weird-out like up close five feet away

32:03.560 --> 32:10.560
for me. I'd be all, you know, like, oh my gosh, my title, you go put your best self.

32:10.740 --> 32:14.580
You know, but it's, you know, to each their own, I think it's just, you know, a sign of

32:14.580 --> 32:18.300
appreciation, you know, if they appreciate my dance, hey, I'm all for it. It's like,

32:18.300 --> 32:22.140
who would have thunk that just getting up and doing something I do just for fun. People

32:22.140 --> 32:26.220
would download me, they'd try to compromise style, they'd want to find out words and stuff.

32:26.220 --> 32:31.220
It's, you know, they say flattery is honesty and all that is the truest form of whatever.

32:31.220 --> 32:34.620
Imitation is the finest form of flattery, right?

32:34.620 --> 32:37.900
Yes? That's what you're here for. You're there to correct me.

32:37.900 --> 32:41.300
Did I ever tell you about what happened when I was in Mississippi?

32:41.300 --> 32:44.860
Go ahead. I showed up late for the tourney because I was gonna

32:44.860 --> 32:48.100
be in it and the question I got was

32:48.100 --> 32:51.580
when I told people who I was, they were like, oh my god, you're Darth

32:51.580 --> 32:54.420
Socko? Wait, do you know Mel B?

32:54.420 --> 32:58.780
That is truly what I got. And the other question is, do you still have the bat?

32:58.780 --> 33:02.060
Oh, the bathroom miggle too, wow.

33:02.060 --> 33:05.860
But yeah, just a quick on the fanboy's background, I guess it's...

33:05.860 --> 33:08.940
The only time it really tripped, I guess, it really hit me was

33:08.940 --> 33:13.220
I was in Canada of all places. I was in Vancouver visiting a friend, and then some guy actually

33:13.220 --> 33:15.940
recognized me from my Santa Monica video. I was like,

33:15.940 --> 33:22.140
whoa, out there? Yeah, I gotta admit, it's kinda weird, but at the same time, hey, you know,

33:22.140 --> 33:26.860
I got nothing but love for everyone who's got love back. For me, it's all about the game, but

33:26.860 --> 33:28.860
They like me, hey, it's all good.

33:28.860 --> 33:30.860
They like you, they really like you.

33:30.860 --> 33:35.860
I guess they're not asking me for my pin number for my ATM card, hey, it's all too good.

33:35.860 --> 33:42.860
I guess my next question would be for Melody, because it's no secret, I guess she doesn't mind me saying, Melody, Mel B, an item here, right?

33:42.860 --> 33:45.860
Yes, it's okay to say on the show, yeah, duh, okay, just making sure.

33:45.860 --> 33:50.860
If you kill all the jokes about Mel and Mel, oh my god, they're the same. I've heard them millions of times.

33:50.860 --> 33:54.860
Some people don't like that stuff coming out on air, but no secret.

33:54.860 --> 33:58.860
So how do you feel about the Mel B. fanboys and fangirls?

33:58.860 --> 34:02.860
It can be rather on the interesting side.

34:02.860 --> 34:06.860
Mel just sits there saying, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

34:06.860 --> 34:10.860
We want to hear the funny, embarrassing stories because that's what radio is for.

34:10.860 --> 34:14.860
Funny, embarrassing stories. No, that's us.

34:14.860 --> 34:18.860
No fanboys or fangirls.

34:18.860 --> 34:21.860
It's kind of something you just have to learn to deal with.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.820
It can be hard, but it's something

34:23.820 --> 34:25.980
I'm starting to come to terms with that he's

34:25.980 --> 34:27.180
going to be out there.

34:27.180 --> 34:30.740
And that it really is a form of flattery.

34:30.740 --> 34:32.340
People really like him, but as long

34:32.340 --> 34:35.900
as they keep their hands off of him, I'm happy.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.540
Because he's mine.

34:37.540 --> 34:38.060
Know what?

34:38.060 --> 34:39.940
She loves the fanboys, hates the fangirls.

34:39.940 --> 34:42.260
Exactly.

34:42.260 --> 34:44.940
Well, yeah, just a quick, funny fanboy story, though,

34:44.940 --> 34:46.540
was I remember Drags One.

34:46.540 --> 34:48.740
That was when I did my After the Game of Love routine.

34:48.740 --> 34:51.000
I was like kind of pimped out in the zebra hat and like the

34:51.380 --> 34:56.980
Feather bow and all that and at one part like my feather boy sort of came apart and like there was a feather that flew around

34:56.980 --> 35:01.900
There was this one team at the time. They were team epsilon. I think and one guy said oh my god

35:01.900 --> 35:04.000
You know this is cool. Can I keep it? I'm like well, okay sure

35:04.000 --> 35:10.300
I see him at a tournament about eight months later. He pulls the AI3 he comes up to me and says hey man I'm ready for drag

35:10.300 --> 35:15.300
I'm like oh, yeah, he busts out his wallet pulls out that feather from the boy. He says he keeps it for good luck

35:15.300 --> 35:23.300
I was like, whoa. That's why I came to realize, you know, it's something I got to deal with, you know, and I'm actually all happy about it, hey.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.300
Celebrity.

35:25.300 --> 35:30.300
Hey, you know, I mean, some people like the spotlight, some people hate it. I can embrace it, no problem.

35:30.300 --> 35:34.300
Do you think it's odd at all that DDR is something that kind of creates celebrities?

35:34.300 --> 35:37.300
Um, I've seen Stranger Things create celebrities.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.300
True, true.

35:39.300 --> 35:45.300
I guess if you can be a celebrity through Star Trek or, no just kidding, you're a survivor.

35:45.300 --> 35:50.300
So who are you going to take the sponsorship from, Pepsi or Coke?

35:50.300 --> 35:52.300
I would have to go with Pepsi.

35:52.300 --> 35:57.300
Alright. So Pepsi, give them a contract.

35:57.300 --> 36:06.300
I'll ask another real quick question. What do you think was the most, because you go to a lot of tournaments all around California and now even some outside of California too.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.300
I got the UK tournament going in October.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.300
You're definitely going to that, huh?

36:10.300 --> 36:11.300
King of Styles III, yes.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.300
Right on.

36:12.300 --> 36:17.300
What do you think to date has been the most, I guess I wouldn't say the best or worst tournament,

36:17.300 --> 36:22.300
because that's too hard to kind of judge, but maybe the most fun tournament that you went to?

36:22.300 --> 36:27.300
Most fun tournament? Ooh, I would have to say...

36:27.300 --> 36:31.300
Probably... I'm going back.

36:31.300 --> 36:35.300
I think probably the most fun tournament was the first ever Metreon tournament.

36:35.300 --> 36:40.980
It was yeah about August to 2000. That's when like NorCal's that was really their first major get-together

36:40.980 --> 36:48.140
That's when Medtron was holding it Pepsi was sponsoring KOA was doing their thing and that's you know when I was in freestyle

36:48.320 --> 36:53.180
There were like two tiebreakers I had to go there were two tiebreakers in freestyle like one I had to go against

36:53.500 --> 36:58.820
Mike No for first place, you know, we both like went at it. We had to go through like improv

36:58.820 --> 37:01.560
We had to go through routine. They had to pull almost every

37:01.560 --> 37:07.200
tiebreaker in the book, but it was just a lot of fun afterwards, because everyone out

37:07.200 --> 37:11.800
there, it was back before drama really existed and all that, so it was just a sign of the

37:11.800 --> 37:15.800
times when we were all still bonded together by this whole DDR thing, we were all together

37:15.800 --> 37:19.960
before our personal lives sort of took over.

37:19.960 --> 37:24.780
I guess this is going to be an odd question, but was DDR better then?

37:24.780 --> 37:28.800
I think it's not so much it was better, it was just the fascination was still there,

37:28.800 --> 37:34.580
And you know, at the time, we had 1.5 and we really, not a lot of us had third mix or

37:34.580 --> 37:40.000
any other mix to compare and yearn for, but nowadays it's like, once DDR comes out, we

37:40.000 --> 37:42.720
like it for a few days and then we're like, well damn, we want something more.

37:42.720 --> 37:48.880
Because we realize how fun DDR can be and it's usually hard to recreate that first genuine

37:48.880 --> 37:51.100
pure love you have for that feeling.

37:51.100 --> 37:52.100
It's like, you know, crack.

37:52.100 --> 37:55.700
You get the first hit, all you're trying to do is you're trying to replicate that feeling

37:55.700 --> 37:56.700
of the first time.

37:56.700 --> 37:57.700
It never quite happens.

37:57.700 --> 38:01.700
orange lounge is not a doorstruck

38:27.700 --> 38:32.460
stay on the pill, because I won't hurt you, but the next man will.

38:32.460 --> 38:34.460
Those are the words were never said

39:32.460 --> 39:34.260
Just tryin' to get real real

39:34.260 --> 39:35.880
Make sure they laugh and just tryin' to get

39:35.880 --> 39:37.360
Just I vote you gon' stay safe

39:37.360 --> 39:39.360
Cut the drugs, cut the drugs

40:07.360 --> 40:28.400
I'm way too out here, man!

40:28.400 --> 40:32.400
I like it!

40:36.400 --> 40:40.400
Loving you

40:40.400 --> 40:44.400
Loving you

40:44.400 --> 40:48.400
It was such a hard line

40:48.400 --> 40:52.400
Loving you

40:52.400 --> 40:56.400
It was such a hard line

43:26.400 --> 43:49.580
I apologize for cutting off the last song there, we were trying to listen to the Outer

43:49.580 --> 43:55.760
Limits and I made a technical boo-boo and it got cut off, sorry, so I'll give you another

43:55.760 --> 44:00.420
LED track from Nudisix Style and maybe we'll get back to Outer Limits a little later, so

44:00.420 --> 44:07.420
I have my apologies.

44:30.420 --> 44:40.420
Kill that machine

45:00.420 --> 45:01.420
1.

45:01.420 --> 45:02.420
B.

45:02.420 --> 45:03.420

45:03.420 --> 45:04.420

45:04.420 --> 45:05.420

45:05.420 --> 45:06.420

45:06.420 --> 45:07.420

45:07.420 --> 45:08.420
7.

45:08.420 --> 45:09.420
8.

45:09.420 --> 45:10.420
9.

45:10.420 --> 45:11.420
10.

45:11.420 --> 45:12.420
11.

45:12.420 --> 45:13.420
12.

45:13.420 --> 45:14.420
13.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.420
16.

45:15.420 --> 45:16.420
17.

45:16.420 --> 45:17.420
18.

45:17.420 --> 45:18.420
19.

45:18.420 --> 45:19.420
20.

45:19.420 --> 45:20.420
21.

45:20.420 --> 45:21.420
22.

45:21.420 --> 45:22.420
23.

45:22.420 --> 45:23.420
24.

45:23.420 --> 45:24.420
25.

45:24.420 --> 45:25.420
26.

45:25.420 --> 45:26.420
27.

45:26.420 --> 45:27.420
27.

45:27.420 --> 45:28.420
28.

45:28.420 --> 45:29.420
29.

45:29.420 --> 45:58.900
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio

45:58.900 --> 46:14.580
staff meeting.

46:14.580 --> 46:19.860
Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

46:19.860 --> 46:24.740
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and in that last set we had a couple of the new

46:24.740 --> 46:29.100
new tracks from the 6 style home version, which is kind of the biggest news in the Bomani

46:29.100 --> 46:33.480
scene this week, is that 6 style was released in Japan, and so of course all the fans of

46:33.480 --> 46:38.440
2DX are importing it here, and it's cool, we were going to talk about it last week when

46:38.440 --> 46:43.620
unfortunately none of us got our copy in time, but we have them this week, I got mine, I

46:43.620 --> 46:49.120
finally caved and bought a Japanese Playstation 2 this week just so I could have 6 style.

46:49.120 --> 46:51.800
So it's out in the other room right now and there's people playing it.

46:51.800 --> 46:52.800
What do you think?

46:52.800 --> 46:53.800
What do you guys think of 6 style?

46:53.800 --> 46:55.800
Do we like it?

46:55.800 --> 46:57.800
Woohoo!

46:57.800 --> 47:00.800
God, you people are dead this week!

47:00.800 --> 47:02.800
Well go play it!

47:02.800 --> 47:04.800
Go in there and play it. If you haven't played it, go in there and play it.

47:04.800 --> 47:08.800
And for, you know, just call everybody who's listening, come on over to Rob's and play it in the other room.

47:08.800 --> 47:11.800
Don't keep the address out, that's all I ask.

47:11.800 --> 47:16.800
Well I think probably the best thing about $6 is for the simple fact that every 2DX machine out here that I know of

47:16.800 --> 47:21.800
has a really stupid freaking unreadable screen and now you can go home and

47:21.800 --> 47:24.800
The movies actually work. I mean, wow.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.800
Who knew that the video for Wow Wow 70s was so fucking cool, huh?

47:27.800 --> 47:28.800
That is awesome.

47:28.800 --> 47:37.800
Don't forget about Bearcade though, because Bearcade does have probably the best quality machine now in California, except for maybe AI that I've played.

47:37.800 --> 47:46.800
AI screen is not that great because now the blue and white keys all look green, so it's not bad but not stellar.

47:46.800 --> 47:52.800
The only time I ever played that one was November last year, and I think that was right after it had been replaced.

47:52.800 --> 47:55.800
I haven't been to AI in a while, but just as long.

47:55.800 --> 47:59.800
SHGL's old machine was by far the weirdest one I ever had to play on.

47:59.800 --> 48:06.800
I've never seen people just quit in the middle of a game because they got so sick of trying to read the screen.

48:06.800 --> 48:12.800
I usually like to get my whole money's worth when I play 2DX, and I did walk away from the machine when I was there last November.

48:12.800 --> 48:17.960
It was the only machine that I ever had such a bad case of vertigo playing, because the

48:17.960 --> 48:21.480
sides of the screen were burned out in a circle, I thought I had tunnel vision the whole time.

48:21.480 --> 48:25.720
Now does any 2DX machine in the U.S. have working videos, or is this the first time

48:25.720 --> 48:29.660
a lot of us get to see these videos unless we downloaded them online somewhere?

48:29.660 --> 48:34.360
For 6 style, the only time I ever saw working videos was temporarily they did work at AI,

48:34.360 --> 48:38.320
but anywhere else I did not see them going.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.320
Interesting.

48:39.320 --> 48:43.200
Any other cool videos you want to point out that people should check out if they get to

48:43.200 --> 48:44.200
play this?

48:44.200 --> 48:45.200
On 6 style?

48:45.200 --> 48:49.320
Well, seeing as how I've only ever played it here at Iguana Girl's house.

48:49.320 --> 48:52.440
I like, I think it's one of the Eurobeat ones.

48:52.440 --> 48:53.440
Linus.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.440
Mel B says Linus.

48:54.440 --> 48:58.480
One of the Eurobeat ones had the bunny from Keyboard Baby.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.120
Pada Pada Pada.

49:00.120 --> 49:04.320
I remember playing it and absolutely failing it on 7 key.

49:04.320 --> 49:08.560
And then stopping right in the middle of playing, look over, oh my god, is that the rabbit?

49:08.560 --> 49:15.560
Just like that. And it distracted me worse than the evil Satan fetus from 2.50 BPM.

49:15.560 --> 49:19.680
G2 also has a really awesome video, too.

49:19.680 --> 49:26.200
That video scares me. It's got, like, trans-circa aliens or something. It's weird stuff. You

49:26.200 --> 49:29.040
expect to see her floating in a glass jar or something. It's pretty scary.

49:29.040 --> 49:32.520
I have to say, as always, the Orange Lounge videos are the best.

49:32.520 --> 49:36.720
I agree. Now, did you notice for about a half second in the Wow Wow 70s video, there's a

49:36.720 --> 49:41.720
There's a shot of the two girls from the MobaMoga video with afros.

49:41.720 --> 49:46.240
The only thing that really distracted me was the building with the fro, which, by the way,

49:46.240 --> 49:50.080
is going to be replacing my Pocari sweat icon on my live channel.

49:50.080 --> 49:51.080
Right on.

49:51.080 --> 49:54.600
Now, Bradley, you're a big 2DX fan, you got any videos that people should be checking

49:54.600 --> 49:55.600
out?

49:55.600 --> 49:56.600
Not so far.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.520
I've been playing too much to actually watch the videos yet.

49:58.520 --> 49:59.520
Sounds good.

49:59.520 --> 50:03.160
Yes, I'd actually just like to sit on my computer monitor and just sit in the background and

50:03.160 --> 50:07.400
just watch it's the one for colors honestly because it's just so pretty and

50:07.400 --> 50:13.800
trancy and it's colorful it makes me happy it makes me the color of blue and

50:13.800 --> 50:19.800
and oh I was a fool to let you walk away another neat thing about six hours has

50:19.800 --> 50:24.400
new movie mode or movie clip mode where you can watch the videos fullscreen it's

50:24.400 --> 50:27.160
nice you put on autoplay and then just watch the video screen with no notes or

50:27.160 --> 50:32.400
anything that's pretty awesome and a good idea and if anyone has it you can

50:32.400 --> 50:36.400
You can set up a chorus and make it autoplay and it just goes through all the videos.

50:36.400 --> 50:39.400
Just watch like 10 videos in a row if you want to.

51:06.400 --> 51:11.120
videos of like the guys playing all the stuff one-handed, it's got to be the most demoralizing

51:11.120 --> 51:14.600
bit of footage you can ever watch for 2DX.

51:14.600 --> 51:18.680
Those videos just scream, Americans suck at 2DX.

51:18.680 --> 51:22.880
For the people who don't know what Tetujin means, it means Iron Man.

51:22.880 --> 51:25.160
It's named that for a reason.

51:25.160 --> 51:28.720
You know, those are some absolutely fantastic players.

51:28.720 --> 51:32.800
It's like, is that trying to spin off on Iron Chef, like Iron 2DX?

51:32.800 --> 51:35.280
and i don't know it's like you know

51:35.280 --> 51:37.340
like taken for two d x

51:37.340 --> 51:39.700
you know the king of iron fingering

51:39.700 --> 51:41.560
the world

51:41.560 --> 51:46.120
never mind i said that there are that part of adult content

51:46.120 --> 51:46.880
uh...

51:46.880 --> 51:50.280
i was referring to this and it's a completely innocent manner

51:50.280 --> 51:52.800
you pervert

51:52.800 --> 51:57.560
i think we know what our last week on orange lounge clip will be

51:57.560 --> 52:00.520
okay you can buy it

52:00.520 --> 52:04.520
I'm gonna go sit back in my chair the rest of the night and let people deliver me donuts and vanilla coke.

52:04.520 --> 52:08.520
Look at this setup we have here. Jamie's kind of sitting in her throne here, the big blue chair.

52:08.520 --> 52:09.520
I'm a goddess, of course.

52:09.520 --> 52:10.520
The rest of us are all sitting on the floor around her.

52:10.520 --> 52:12.520
Hey, I offered the chair.

52:12.520 --> 52:13.520
The chair is mine, too.

52:13.520 --> 52:14.520
The chair is rightfully yours.

52:14.520 --> 52:16.520
I am the Vicodin goddess.

52:16.520 --> 52:17.520
The Vicodin goddess?

52:17.520 --> 52:18.520
Of course.

52:18.520 --> 52:19.520
And what makes you the Vicodin goddess?

52:19.520 --> 52:21.520
Because I'm well medicated.

52:21.520 --> 52:23.520
I have to medicate myself to do the show.

52:23.520 --> 52:25.520
Are you under sedation?

52:25.520 --> 52:32.520
Haha, haha, haha, give me that.

52:32.520 --> 52:37.520
SoCalKicks is saying, let us remind you, were you moist yesterday, or last week?

52:37.520 --> 52:43.520
Dude, you still haven't sent me my proof that you passed my edit. No GameCube pens for you.

52:43.520 --> 52:45.520
Nice question, Dodge, there.

52:45.520 --> 52:52.520
When you send me the proof that you have passed my edit with a 90% perfect attack and full combo,

52:52.520 --> 52:57.240
you know, then I will be nice to you and send you your GameCube pen, maybe if you retract

52:57.240 --> 52:58.240
your question.

52:58.240 --> 52:59.240
Maybe.

52:59.240 --> 53:00.240
We'll see.

53:00.240 --> 53:03.200
We'll see if anybody else can respond to that.

53:03.200 --> 53:07.760
In the meantime, let's break from six style chatter for a minute and let's let Matt, also

53:07.760 --> 53:11.240
known as Loki, give us an update on what's going on in the simulation scene, because

53:11.240 --> 53:12.480
there's a lot of news this week.

53:12.480 --> 53:17.480
Last week he drowned his sims to the pool.

53:17.480 --> 53:24.480
Yes, actually I do that very often, it's just very fun to kill them off.

53:24.480 --> 53:27.480
Have an update, SoCalCakes has retracted the question.

53:27.480 --> 53:29.480
Okay, you can have your pen semi-proof.

53:29.480 --> 53:43.480
Okay, in the sim world, boards are still down, we still have Team Guilo down, we still have the melting pot down, and also the actual DWI official board down, but there's a bunch of mirrors out there.

53:43.480 --> 53:58.480
Really no updates as far as programs go. There was a small update to Dance with Intensity 2.0. It's now 2.0003, which I haven't really seen any changes. The video still doesn't work in the background for me, so that kind of sucks. I'm very disappointed.

53:58.480 --> 54:05.180
it. One major news thing is actually going to be with DDR East Coast Invasion or their

54:05.180 --> 54:12.460
website, ddreei.com. They're having their second DDR. It's a DWI Turning Mix 2. It's

54:12.460 --> 54:17.660
going to be running for the whole month of August. And there's actually a few different

54:17.660 --> 54:22.660
things you can enter in. They're going to have a light, standard and heavy entries you

54:22.660 --> 54:31.660
Light is for people that are just getting into making DWIs. Standard is, you know, basic, you know, anyone that's kind of seasoned doing DWIs.

54:31.660 --> 54:36.660
And then Heavy is just for the elite, which I'll be entering in, because, you know.

54:36.660 --> 54:38.660
No one has the ego here.

54:38.660 --> 54:43.660
I have an ego, but yes, I will be entering in this time.

54:43.660 --> 54:52.660
Also, they're going to be having a light doubles, which I guess they're going to be doubles edits, which I'll most definitely do also.

54:52.660 --> 54:57.660
But that's going to be going on for the month of August, so hopefully we'll see a lot of good stuff come out of that one.

54:57.660 --> 54:59.660
You doubles know.

54:59.660 --> 55:03.660
I'm actually thinking about entering one of these edit contests just because I'm pretty bored.

55:03.660 --> 55:09.660
So, I mean, hell, we got this show off the ground. What's that say about free time?

55:09.660 --> 55:12.660
No life plus no talent gets you a talk show.

55:12.660 --> 55:16.580
And I did rip that line from Space Coast Coast to Coast, thank you.

55:16.580 --> 55:20.940
It's being said in the chat room, Pyroman is saying,

55:20.940 --> 55:23.620
hey, rumor here that StepMania Beta 5

55:23.620 --> 55:25.700
out very soon, possibly tomorrow.

55:25.700 --> 55:27.600
Have you heard anything about that?

55:27.600 --> 55:30.920
No, I haven't, but hopefully it'll work a little better this time.

55:30.920 --> 55:34.480
See, the only thing that I like about StepMania is it's got a lot of

55:34.480 --> 55:39.240
nifty, shiny stuff in it. You know, they have the new features as far as like

55:39.240 --> 55:40.840
modifiers you can do to songs, but

55:40.840 --> 55:45.680
The thing I really hate about it is, because I have a huge song collection, it takes forever

55:45.680 --> 55:49.800
to load the damn thing up. I can sit there for about five minutes watching the thing

55:49.800 --> 55:54.040
scroll by because it's reading all my songs, and it just takes forever. Whereas, like,

55:54.040 --> 55:59.640
you know, back in the days with even Delight Delight Reduplication, one of the old simulators,

55:59.640 --> 56:04.840
what it does is it scans, you scan your music list, and it'll build a list, and then that

56:04.840 --> 56:09.520
That way it loads instantly every time, same with DWI, same thing.

56:09.520 --> 56:14.320
And StepMania has kind of dumbed it down where it scans your music list every time, so it

56:14.320 --> 56:15.320
takes forever.

56:15.320 --> 56:19.880
So if they just fix that, then maybe I might go over to StepMania, but I'm sticking with

56:19.880 --> 56:21.600
DWI for now.

56:21.600 --> 56:25.120
Oh, I was going to ask our guests some questions, but they ran in the other room to go play

56:25.120 --> 56:26.580
sick style.

56:26.580 --> 56:29.300
So that's all on the simulation front then for now?

56:29.300 --> 56:30.920
That's it until all the boards come back up.

56:30.920 --> 56:36.680
Hopefully they won't have any more bandwidth issues with Team Guilo, because I love reading

56:36.680 --> 56:41.280
that board for the news, and then when that goes down, so does the melting pot and DWI.

56:41.280 --> 56:46.520
Paul, you've been awfully quiet all night, do you have anything you want to add?

56:46.520 --> 56:50.400
I've been out of town this week, so I'd just like to tell anyone who goes through the Santa

56:50.400 --> 56:53.840
Cruz Boardwalk to not go to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, because the arcading there is pretty

56:53.840 --> 56:54.840
bad.

56:54.840 --> 56:58.880
The only thing there for nostalgia is the BeatMania Complete Mix is kind of fun to play

56:58.880 --> 57:06.360
They do have Percussion Freaks, but no chair, so if you want to play a Percussion Freaks

57:06.360 --> 57:11.320
fourth mix with no chair standing up, you'll get real sore, but you'll have fun.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.320
It's kind of a new thing.

57:13.320 --> 57:14.320
Oh yes.

57:14.320 --> 57:15.320
We have...

57:15.320 --> 57:16.320
Oh?

57:16.320 --> 57:17.320
Okay.

57:17.320 --> 57:19.600
I just need to ask you a question about it.

57:19.600 --> 57:21.960
Oh, a personal question, yes.

57:21.960 --> 57:22.960
Just one moment here.

57:22.960 --> 57:23.960
I'll let Jamie talk.

57:23.960 --> 57:24.960
I have an announcement.

57:24.960 --> 57:25.960
I have a doughnut.

57:25.960 --> 57:27.640
Doughnuts are good for you.

57:27.640 --> 57:29.680
They're full of chocolate vitamins.

57:29.680 --> 57:30.680
Seriously.

57:30.680 --> 57:36.760
Okay, we're going to take a quick break because everything's kind of getting distracted now

57:36.760 --> 57:37.760
with sixth style.

57:37.760 --> 57:38.760
It's the top of the hour anyway.

57:38.760 --> 57:41.040
So we're going to take a quick break and we will come right back.

57:41.040 --> 57:45.680
I have to give a few plugs before we go to break though, a few things.

57:45.680 --> 57:48.400
SoCalKicks.com is now up and running.

57:48.400 --> 57:53.600
So SoCalKicks, he has a cool little site there and Jamie's edits are up there, which you

57:53.600 --> 57:54.760
can go download.

57:54.760 --> 57:58.880
very cool, and all sorts of news and things like that, especially, as is in the name,

57:58.880 --> 58:03.800
about SoCal. So SoCalKicks.com, you can visit that. If you haven't heard it yet, we do have

58:03.800 --> 58:08.600
an original work by Keel in rotation this week on the website, so, I'm sorry, on the

58:08.600 --> 58:13.040
Bimani Music & More program, so do listen in on the Bimani Music & More program, which

58:13.040 --> 58:17.660
runs 24 hours a day on the station when we're not live, and we're starting to take some

58:17.660 --> 58:23.100
original works and remixes of Bimani stuff. So if you have anything you want to add for

58:23.100 --> 58:28.420
that, send it to orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com, or any comments and things you want to give

58:28.420 --> 58:31.460
on the show, orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com.

58:31.460 --> 58:34.580
And because I did promise, so I'd like to say hi to Ash, because you said you'd be listening

58:34.580 --> 58:35.580
tonight.

58:35.580 --> 58:42.300
And thank you for helping boost us listeners in your area, and hello to everybody who's

58:42.300 --> 58:46.300
deciding to listen tonight, and we really appreciate the support.

58:46.300 --> 58:49.600
Yes, thanks everybody for listening tonight, awesome.

58:49.600 --> 58:56.500
And also 2dxstyle.net is up and running once again and they've got a nice little button

58:56.500 --> 58:57.500
for us on there.

58:57.500 --> 58:58.500
That was really awesome.

58:58.500 --> 59:01.940
I wasn't expecting to see that so thanks to them for supporting us and we'll support you

59:01.940 --> 59:02.980
best we can.

59:02.980 --> 59:03.980
So do go visit their site.

59:03.980 --> 59:08.800
They now have, they're trying to build a location page of every 2DX machine in the nation and

59:08.800 --> 59:12.600
it is, it's fairly up to date from what I'm being told so go take a look at that if you

59:12.600 --> 59:13.600
get a moment.

59:13.600 --> 59:20.600
we're gonna break and we will be right back

59:43.600 --> 01:00:12.600
Well I'm a chemist, I move the lab ready to explore

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.300
I drop the beat for fat rhymes like no one has before

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.900
I kicked enough to verse in my speech when I flunk

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.300
I'm not like a devil, the suction for the dope or the drugs

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.300
So he can teach a drive in the beds

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:25.900
I keep the low pro, making hands with my friends

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.600
Free skills, oh shit, a brother with mad spells

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.600
Don't even try to step off, my lyrics are mad foul

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:05.600
I'm not gonna lie, I'm just kidding.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.600
Your hands move so fast.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.600
I'm not gonna lie, I'm just kidding.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:24.600
I'm not gonna lie, I'm just kidding.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:46.980
Well I'm a chemist, I move the lab ready to explore

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.560
I drop the fuck off at rhymes like no one has before

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.280
I kick the knelt at verbs in my speech when I flow

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.580
I'm not like a devil, that sucks you for the dough of the drugs

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.580
So he can teach a drive in the base

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.180
I keep the low pro, makin' ends with my friends

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.980
Free skills, oh shit, a brother with mad styles

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.980
Don't even try to step on my lyrics, I'm mad foul

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:37.980
Your hands move so fast.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:14.980

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.980
A record raffle, I can call a crash

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.980
What gun is that? That's mass

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.980
They'll be six feet under grass

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:37.980
That's the way it is

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:42.980

Running in the light, dance

01:11:44.480 --> 01:12:04.480
Music

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.480
Music

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.480
to the Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.480
We keep being prong boys.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.480
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio live.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.480
Yes we are.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:26.480
Gosh, I'm just not being friendly with Winamp tonight are we?

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.480
I think I'm going to shoot this thing in the head.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.480
It's helped mesmerized by our sponsor, The Swedish Chef.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.480
You know what?

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.480
I just threw a fish at him and Rob went crazy.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.480
I think Winamp's mad at me because when I logged in today it said,

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.840
I said, upgrade me.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.880
And I said, no, I need to have a show to do.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.160
Mine tells me that every day.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.160
I think it's protesting.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.720
I think it wants to disown me.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.020
I want to say a big hello to everybody in the chat room

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:51.880
right now over on IRC.eggheads.org.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.760
Or if you just download M-I-R-C, you're

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.720
just going to want to connect to any other side IRC server.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.360
And we're in Channel Orange Lounge.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.240
We're joined tonight by some special guests.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.120
We've got a whole bunch of our regulars here.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.720
And also from out of town, we've got Mel B and Melody.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.040
So, everybody's kind of running in and out though, playing sick style as well.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.040
Kind of seeing what's going on there.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:15.280
I don't know, what do you want to talk about now, Jamie?

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.160
I'm kind of running out of things to discuss.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:22.080
Well, we're thinking of having a new segment, you know, to sort of, again, focus on the

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.160
and more part of our radio show.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.160
Yes.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:29.880
The weekly anime review, which, you know, I think I'm going to review something pretty

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.560
old school that Mel brought up earlier today.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:43.400
review of Lupin the Third, more DDR2, Castle of Cagliostro, one of the best anime ever.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.360
I see people who are going off on, oh Hellsing is cool, which it is.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.520
I saw Hellsing for the first time last night.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.260
Hellsing owns, but we're reviewing old stuff.

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:58.240
This is also another reference to old school gamers here, who happens to remember the game

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:05.000
cliffhanger that sort of played like Dragon's Lair and Dragon's Lair II and that other sort

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.720
of weird game that featured the cowboy.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:15.320
I don't remember that game offhand, but it was time something.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:21.140
Anyway, the whole thing with Castle of Cagliostro is I don't know how many people have actually

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:23.960
watched the Lupin TV series, which was really awesome.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:32.240
So basically, it features him going after a crime syndicate that's been responsible

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:39.320
for the counterfeiting for centuries even, funding wars and going after, but there's

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:44.240
also a little mystery and a little bit of romance attached to that.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.040
It's definitely something that if you rent it once, you'll definitely want to buy it

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.680
and certainly for people who love old school anime.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.080
And it's Miyazaki, right?

01:14:53.080 --> 01:15:02.220
right yes it was directed by Miyazaki and you know Miyazaki for for people

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:06.520
who you know don't know him by name is the man behind studio Ghibli so as in

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:14.940
Princess Mononoke, Laputa, Nausicaa that's another one too oh yeah and even

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:19.180
before that that that was monkey punch right yes monkey punch is responsible

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:23.300
for Lupin. Yeah, that was before he went to the studio to give the... No, no, no. Monkey

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:28.980
Punch is the one who did the Lupin comics, who created the character, and also of course

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:33.980
was responsible for the early animation. Castle Cagliostro was actually directed by Miyazaki.

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:39.980
Oh, okay. Woot woot. So, yes, you know, more of my useless anime trivia. Hey, it's cool.

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:44.200
Well, let's talk about one of my mutant powers. We were talking about a few weeks ago on the

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.520
show. Actually, I think it was one of the shows you were in here, though. We were talking

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:50.080
about DDR and anime, what's the correlation? Actually, no, I think it was your first show

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:54.280
back we started talking about this. What is the connection? It seems like a lot of, besides

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.520
the obvious, they're both from Japan reference, you know, what is there, why does there seem

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:05.640
to be this connection between anime and DDR? Well, you know, I've often thought that, and

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:08.760
you don't necessarily have to be into one to be in the other, but I've noticed that

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:16.480
a lot of people are into both, you know. Can you say otaku? Otaku. Thank you. And for

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.320
For the people who actually really don't know what that means, it's someone who actually

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.220
sits at home and doesn't go anywhere.

01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.220
That is the literal reference.

01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:24.220
Otaku means home.

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:28.380
Yes, otaku means home.

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:35.560
For people who really misuse the word otaku, it actually is, in slang terms, it means somebody

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:39.680
who stays in their house all day and never goes out, just sits with their anime.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:43.760
I know people like that.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.840
For those that are in the chat room right now, I have to point out that Kiehl posted

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:51.360
a very funny picture, it kind of reminded me of the movie Office Space, where he's beaten

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:57.640
the crap out of his old Macintosh here with a hammer, it's like.2 seconds before impact

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.640
here.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.520
Melody seems to be sad here as the Mac fan, uh oh, uh oh.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.080
I'm the only Macintosh user and I must say that shocks and saddens me.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.920
There you go.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:16.440
I remember being 11 or 12 and doing tech support for my school on those old Apples.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.840
Oh, it is a pic.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:18.840
Oh, it's moving.

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.240
It kind of looked like a hammer at first glance and far away.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:24.040
It looks like the pic is already through the monitor there on the screen.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.760
My bad.

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:31.640
And now, a moment of silence to mourn the loss of one more Macintosh.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.680
Three, three, three, oh, snap.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.160
Oh, poor Melody.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:42.320
Oh, I promised Irene she could get a second here to share a thought, so now I'd like to

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.860
do a segment called Irene's Thought of the Day.

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.860
So here we go.

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:46.860
Deep thoughts by Irene.

01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:47.860
Here comes Irene.

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:48.860
Here she is.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:53.860
I thought you were going to do this, I guess I did it.

01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:59.460
Oh, I was just going to let everyone know that procrastination is like masturbation.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:05.180
You know, it feels good until you realize that you've fucked yourself.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:10.460
That was deep. That was very deep.

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:14.660
Thank you, thank you so much for that. And remember, wash your hands.

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:23.340
I know it's a little late. I know it's a little late, Irene, but...

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:29.860
You got some ha-has from the chatroom, though. She says thank you, chatroom.

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:33.560
That was actually, though, a very interesting point.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:37.120
That is actually very true.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.120
Well thank you, yes it is.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:43.200
As Rob stares at me, and blinks at me.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:46.760
Are we just going to talk about masturbation the rest of the show then, or what's the deal?

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.760
Masturbation makes coordination.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:48.760
Oh, we're losing listeners!

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.760
Dear God, no!

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.760
Bahmani!

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.760
Bahmani!

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.760
No, no, don't you notice that sex brings you in listeners, you know, spank, spank, spank,

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:55.760
whatever.

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.760
Irene, want to tell us some more about masturbation?

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:11.960
What do you want to know about masturbation?

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:20.760
Well I think masturbation, the definition of masturbation is pleasing yourself sexually.

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:24.960
And I think guys do it more.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.300
I don't know. I don't watch people do it, but I think they do it more

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:34.940
It's it's kind of like gin rummy. It's like you don't need a partner if you got a good hand. Yes

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:42.980
Exactly. Oh god. Are we gonna make a bunch of like obscure quotes now or something sexual quotes now, dude

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:46.400
I need good sound bites for the show. So just keep this keep this bit going

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.280
I don't got there nothing else DDR to the egg, whatever talk about

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:57.800
You know, it can be done with things that you find at the grocery store, too.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.040
Pork fat.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:04.840
I heard Crisco from somebody once.

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:05.840
Chicken burrito.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:06.840
For a girl?

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.840
No!

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.840
From one of my ex-boyfriends.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:12.720
No, I mean, like, the stuff you can use, a girl can use this stuff.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.480
I don't think a girl really needs to use anything, do they?

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.480
Your mama.

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:22.480
I know you didn't talk about my moment, now I'm gonna get it.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.480
Okay, and now that we've completely crashed timber...

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.480
Here you go, Rob.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:34.480
And of course, Rob has replaced the sexy planet.

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:37.480
Gee, wow, that poor Mac died.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:42.480
And how about them coal miners? They're all happy.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:48.480
Let me run to the list here. Oh yes, let's talk about music.

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.480
Music that we...

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.480
I need music.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:56.480
Besides the B-Mani series, what is some music that you all like to listen to?

01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:00.480
No, I got criticized last week for not talking like the announcer, going,

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.480
B-Mani! It's Konami's famous B-Mani series!

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.480
Well, you know, the announcer is wrong, too.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:08.480
You know the announcer is wrong, too.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.480
It's B-Mani.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:15.480
Also, the announcer in Max 2 doesn't speak Japanese very well, but still.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:21.880
Anyway, alright music, so I'll tell you what, let's run it around, what's everybody listening

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.380
to this week?

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:26.220
You know, when I was driving home from San Francisco today, I listened to a new radio

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:31.520
station over there, 92.7, which is just dance music all day, and I'm having this, like,

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:35.900
I'm liking a lot of new trance music lately, like that Heaven song that they play on the

01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:39.980
radio all the freaking time, and these other songs, I'm liking that right now.

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.940
I know it's played out, but I like it.

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:42.940
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:47.940
I was also listening to the 92-7, the dance, coming back from San Francisco today.

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:48.940
Good stuff.

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:49.940
I like it.

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:50.940
And I just fell asleep.

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:51.940
Some good shit, huh?

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:52.940
Oh, yeah.

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:53.940
Some good shit.

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:54.940
How about our guests?

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:55.940
What are you kids listening to?

01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:58.580
And also, I should ask you guys this, because you weren't here for this show.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:02.020
What songs do you think should be in a... Thank you, Dave.

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:05.140
What songs do you think should be in a Bomani game that aren't?

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:09.460
Well, as for what I'm listening to, it's rather eclectic.

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:13.460
Normally, one of the things I've been digging a lot lately is a new Red Hot Chili Peppers CD.

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:19.460
That's a really good CD. I think I just turn on By The Way and listen to that track over and over again.

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:25.460
I don't even know how many times, but it's really mellow, but it's quite good.

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:29.460
Most of the time I'm driving all that mellow throw on whatever CD he wants.

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:33.460
It's just kind of whatever he chooses.

01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:40.460
I guess for my musical taste, it's sort of run around.

01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:46.060
Actually, I guess my first love always will be sort of like the 80s British invasion new

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:47.380
wave movement.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:50.060
I was one of those kids born on MTV.

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:55.340
My cousin had Betamax and taped MTV three hours a day, bring it over, and I was sucked

01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.340
in.

01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:59.460
It's that, and my second love will probably have to be the 90s new jack swing movement.

01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:06.460
Everyone loves cross colors and hats worn backwards with their tags still in them and hammer pants and BBD and all that good shmaz

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:12.460
I guess that just really says I really don't really dig much of today's music, which is not to say there isn't good ones

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:19.460
But back then, it's not just the fact that music was good, but I guess it's just all the memories that come along with it

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:24.460
That's one of the big things about music, it's not just that it sounds good but you can feel it and you can relate it to things in your life

01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:28.460
Or you can feel emotions, that's kind of how I see music

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:34.460
You're here. I agree. Did you make a beta reference in there? A beta reference?

01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:37.460
Oh, yeah. A beta, Max. And, you know, if you owned a beta, you were to mass the beta.

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:39.460
Oh!

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:45.460
I just want to tie our conversations into a loop.

01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:50.460
I was going back to my playlist, and I found Mr. E's Beautiful Blues, which is on Road Trip,

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:55.460
which you may have seen by the eels, though. And I found a lot of songs I liked by them,

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:59.020
So I actually got all four of their CDs and listened to a lot of that.

01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.660
And I went to the They Might Be Giants concert.

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:03.820
I had their latest CD, No, and I've gotten two more.

01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:06.860
Now actually in the chat room, one of our chatters right now, Three Feet Elite, also

01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:08.640
went to the They Might Be Giants concert.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.340
So he was actually brought that up as well.

01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.340
Great concert.

01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:12.420
It was a lot of fun.

01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:15.420
They rocked out on a lot of songs I didn't expect and it was really a new experience.

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:18.900
This is the second one I've been to, besides Red Hot Chili Peppers, it was a lot of fun.

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.900
What was their best song they performed?

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:21.900
Robot Parade.

01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:24.460
You've heard Robot Parade, sort of mellowed out.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.460
They actually rocked out on that a lot.

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:30.460
There's one called On the Drags, which is a Rarities album I got from them.

01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:32.460
Just sort of normal rock that they did really well.

01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:33.460
It's a lot of fun.

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:34.460
Cool.

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:38.460
So, anyone else have any other songs they're listening to or any music in particular?

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:41.460
I'm listening to a full spectrum of stuff.

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:46.460
I've been listening to this George Acosta CD I had and just some trance music and stuff.

01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:49.460
And I'm also listening to KMFDM.

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:50.460
Ah, cool.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:51.460
Attack.

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:59.580
Well, you know, back when I was working at an industrial station, I was working at KSJS

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:04.100
for San Jose State, and one of our favorite jokes running around was KMFDM stood for Kill

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:12.900
Motherfucking Depeche Mode.

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:20.540
For the people who can't hear what's going on away from the microphone, I'm sure for

01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:27.700
For people who have been reading the, what are you listening to now, thread on, who have

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:32.180
talked to me since I came back from Anime Expo, know that I've really gotten heavily

01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:39.340
back into J-Rock, listening to Pero, to Malice Miser, but my favorite band, and I'm still

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.660
upset to this day they disbanded, is Lunacy.

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:46.700
I know a few weeks ago, my pick of the song on there was Crazy About You.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:53.860
If I had to pick one now, I'd be listening to Rossier 50 times a day.

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:58.660
My whole big thing with J-Rock lately has been it's got the same feel that a lot of

01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:03.540
the good 80s rock had, and they've really gone overboard with the glam if you're into

01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:09.940
the visual K. For all the J-Rock fans out there, there's a lot of us now.

01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:15.100
Okay, I was being told by the chat room, I was given this link and said, don't click

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:16.100
this link.

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.100
What did they say, if you've been eating?

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:22.620
If you've been eating. Okay, here we go. Let's see. Let's see what this takes us to

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:31.540
That's horrible, but this is a family show I

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:36.980
Do not think I'll be eating a cherry muffin anytime soon

01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:40.020
That was worse than goat see

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:42.860
That was worse

01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:45.860
There are a few things that I could consider worse than that.

01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:46.860
WHY?

01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:47.860
WHY?

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:48.860
Why did you do that?

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:49.860
I think my eyes are bleeding.

01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:53.180
Okay, let's explain for those listeners out there what we just saw.

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.180
I'm picturing a-

01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:56.180
Do you want to try to explain that?

01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.180
Really?

01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:58.180
You really want to try and explain that?

01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.180
Brad, explain.

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.180
Okay.

01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:01.180
Okay.

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:05.380
I'm picturing a five-year-old kid crossing a street covered in broken glass and like

01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:12.700
ten, like, UPS vans hit him all at once and they poured popcorn on him or something and

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:19.660
some cherry syrup. It was pretty bad. Hi. Is that good enough visual? No, no, Dave is

01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:23.780
asking us to look at this again. I guess I know when to go to the bathroom now. Good

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:30.700
timing there. Yay, yay, pictures. Yeah, I don't think we're going to. No. Go say what's

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:35.980
bad now. Anyway, moving right along. How about some show news? Show news. Some Orange Lounge

01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:40.100
show news. Next week on the show, as if we're starting to get guests here. They love us.

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:42.500
We're joined by Mel B and Melody this week.

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:43.500
Are you guys having a good time?

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:44.500
I hope you're having a good time.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:45.500
Oh, man, we're just kicking it.

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:46.500
It's great.

01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:47.500
That's what we do here.

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:48.500
We just kind of sit around and talk.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.700
Just lounging in the orange lounge.

01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:52.940
We're just chilling.

01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:56.080
Next week, we're going to have some special guests, but I'm not allowed to tell you who

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.080
they are.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.900
You can go ahead and say who.

01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:59.900
I can?

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:04.620
Well, if they tell me I can, then I will, but I can tell you this much, there's some

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:07.940
more Bay Area friends of ours that are going to be coming to visit, and there's two of

01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:08.940
them.

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:11.780
We'll tell you that much, and if they want to reveal themselves,

01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:12.780
then we'll tell you all.

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:14.860
And we're very happy to have them here.

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.780
Well, when we do.

01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:19.820
Oh, we'll tell you guys during the break.

01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:23.140
Yeah, if you were here, part of our live studio audience,

01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:26.420
you will know.

01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.580
The live experience is truly something

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:31.460
that people can live with.

01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:34.500
Because it's the only way you're going to get all the inside jokes, really.

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.220
I think one day we're going to, well, I already

01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:39.820
said you know I've got the kit to go out to tournaments and I was actually gonna

01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.740
do this CVGL but unfortunately some personal life things got in the way and

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:52.220
I wasn't able to I wasn't able to cover the tournament I wasn't able to cover

01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:55.620
the tournament so later we'll be going out Jamie and I will we go out to places

01:28:55.620 --> 01:29:01.860
we'll take the live remote with us and random people but hopefully one day we're

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:05.140
gonna broadcast this show live from somewhere else like a tournament or

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:09.340
something will be in the that will be in the bathroom it's biggle yeah right

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:18.580
coming to you live from the bathroom at AI you know just make sure that you

01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:25.580
don't you know eat in the snack bar before that you'll be fine so so I think

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:28.620
now's a good break time how's that sound we'll take one more break break stuff

01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:31.620
then we'll come back we got about a half hour show up so take another quick break

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:35.780
come back, wrap up the show, and put the nail in the coffin of this week's Orange

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:39.860
Lounge. And let's see, what did I promise the chatroom, or what I promised

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:43.880
the chatroom I'd play for him. You promised long train running for our chatroom. I promised long train running, didn't I? Okay, we're

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:50.880
We're going to start it off with some long train running here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:29.880
Where would you be when you're deaf? Have a lyrical master scream

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.880
If you wanna go faster, taking a train to the next station

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.880
On the dance floor, rocking the nature

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:36.880
The sound is coming out now, it's a day change

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.880
Play your song loud, dance it, make your body rock

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.880
Long train running and it won't stop

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:45.880
Like a fister, I keep on churning Like a fire, I keep on burning

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:48.880
Dance around in a place Cause I'm a DJ right to play

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:52.880
But I got those evil feelings That I will go round and round

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:56.880
And I still will go going on hard But I'm bound for the end of it

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:59.880
But I am, what is your plan?

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:03.880
Well, we can be right now Well, we can be right now

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:08.880
Remember

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:12.880
And here we go!

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:58.880
The moon is quiet, the day that's almost gone

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:05.880
It seems that something hurts me now

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:08.880
When you're up to sleep

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:11.880
The thing that never stops

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:16.880
And you don't have to care to go

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.880
When I think of you

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:28.880
When I think of every other ghost of mine

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:32.880
The one that you're looking for

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:39.880
Just when I thought I could not be stopped So when the chance came to begin

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:46.680
You are a ghost of my life, the one that I'm always really in

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:49.480
Oh, crap, we went into dead air there for a minute.

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:50.480
My bad.

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.480
We're sorry.

01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.480
I'm going...

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.840
Geez, tonight's just the night of Rob messing everything up, isn't it?

01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.840
Technical poopy.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:01.200
It's okay, Rob, we still love you.

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.200
I'm just gonna guess where we were in the song.

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.200
Irene said, who's we?

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:10.200
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one who's holding me

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:17.200
I must know who you are

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:24.200
I'm a social, I'm inside the light

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:32.200
I'm the most I need, woman

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:35.400
It's been a long time coming in

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.400
When the break of every door

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.200
Is a ghost of mine

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:47.400
And I'm not looking for a home

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:51.400
I could not be a star this way, I can't be true

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:58.200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.400
Oh

01:36:51.400 --> 01:37:14.320
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:22.320
Under Sedation Live with Travis, Ron, and Jessica. Saturdays, 630 p.m. to 930 p.m.

Pacific Standard Time at undersedationlive.org

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.320
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:39.320
Because Bongo demands it

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:46.320
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. It's the night of a million fuck-ups here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:54.320
I think it's because we have guests here tonight, so it's just like, you know, everything's gonna break down, you know, while we've got people from out of town watching, you know.

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:55.320
But we're very glad to have them here.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:59.320
The other people here, they've been watching us fuck up week in and week out, so...

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:03.320
Oh! We got somebody else. Devin, come here for a minute.

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:04.320
Welcome to our...

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.480
One of my roommate's friends apparently just got back.

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.640
What do you think of this whole thing?

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:11.040
You don't even...

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.760
You know what Dance Dance Revolution is, correct?

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.480
Yes, I've played a couple times.

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:19.520
You have no freaking clue why people get obsessed with it, right?

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:20.520
No.

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:25.800
So, knowing that you've got tons of Bomani freaks and addicts listening right now, what

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.220
do you have to say about Bomani?

01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:29.080
What do you think about it?

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:30.960
What the hell is it?

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:35.600
All the DDRs, all the Dance Dance Revolution and Button Map pounding games.

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.080
You guys are just a bunch of freaks.

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:38.080
Thank you!

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.080
Yes, thank you very much.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:40.080
All right.

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.080
Get out of here.

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.080
Get lost.

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:43.080
I don't want to see you.

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:44.080
All right.

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.080
Anyway.

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:46.080
Meanwhile.

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.080
He just doesn't know.

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:48.080
He's not in the know.

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:49.080
Okay.

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:52.600
I was told over the break that I am allowed to announce our guests that are coming next

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:53.600
week.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:39:00.600
German, please.

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.880
Our guest next week will be Jazz and DDR Mike.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.240
We'll be here in the house next week.

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.240
Yay!

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:11.200
DDR Mike is, I don't know, he's DDR Mike.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:12.200
He plays in Concord.

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.200
Concord.

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:14.200
Yes, yes.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.200
They're both Concord people.

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.200
Yes.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:17.200
We have more Step Squad people.

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.200
You know, more Step Squad hang out with me.

01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.200
Yay.

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:21.200
All right.

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.200
Woo!

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.200
So they'll be here next week.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:24.200
I won't be alone anymore.

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.400
They'll get to plug whatever they want and talk about whatever, so, because we let our

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.400
guests plug things.

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:29.800
Does anybody else want to plug something in the house?

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:39.040
got gay. We have a request for a toaster and a personal

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:51.400
massage. Back to DDR talk, Matt wanted to talk about

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:56.000
his latest conquest in the DDR world, so let's talk about that.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.680
Well, right now what I've been trying to do, because, you know, I'm really big into the

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:05.080
editing and the edit hacking, two things that are on the list, one probably before the other.

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:09.800
First one is going to be getting 30-second steps in DDR. I'm pretty close to doing it,

01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:15.040
just have to actually test the file first. And the second one will be making Max 2 exclusive

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:19.360
songs, finding the machine ID for that. So that's another thing that's on my list. I

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:24.080
was hoping to have the 30-second steps done by today, but I fell behind, so maybe next

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:29.420
week that is all well well and also speaking of edits I would like to go

01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:33.100
ahead and make sure that people don't forget the challenge although you know

01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:37.460
soca Hicks can ever send me you know visual proof that he's passed you know

01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:41.060
my challenge for look to the sky you know he'll be getting his GameCube pin

01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:45.980
but I'll go ahead and repeat that one for anyone who can full combo with a 90%

01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:50.860
perfect attack on my look to the sky at it it's called freefall you get a nice

01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:56.100
lovely little GameCube pin. First person who sends me proof gets it. And then

01:40:56.100 --> 01:41:02.860
there's the one for my DXY edit another, which basically is really evil. In one

01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:09.580
second place, in that lovely hell edit contest that Matt had, you will be taken

01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:14.060
out to dinner. So the one for that is if you full combo it or 90% perfect attack

01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:18.020
it, you know, either or I will take you out to a nice dinner, you know, with

01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:22.660
a decent limit on on what you can get will it be a candlelight dinner oh baby

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:31.980
you get smoothed there's gonna be wine and cheese and corn there will be bread

01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:42.560
also and cloth napkins oh yeah all right now you know I'm referring to you know

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:45.340
I'm not gonna take you out to like a four-star restaurant you know but maybe

01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:53.220
I'll take you out to sushi, or maybe out back if you're lucky.

01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:58.220
Of course I won't be touching the meat.

01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:03.700
Anyone who can full combo it or get a 90% perfect attack on my another edit will get

01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:04.700
a nice meal for me.

01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:08.220
Oh, you guys are going to love it when I find 30 second notes.

01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:12.580
I've been playing, actually, the edit I made today that was Gun Test, but it got cut off.

01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:15.860
Because at the very end, all eight arrows come down at the same time, or relatively

01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:16.860
close to the same time.

01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:18.300
It's funny just to watch.

01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:21.780
That's when you have a seizure on the pad, you know.

01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:25.420
Of course, you know, the involuntary bowel movements are prohibited.

01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:32.660
So, and also, I am going to be, now that I have Max at home, I am going to be working

01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:41.080
on my other, my next hell edit, probably to Waka-Laka, because, you know, I want to do

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:46.080
just this insanely evil. Wait, how can you do a Waka Waka edit with Max 1? Oh, it wasn't

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:50.340
in there. You mean Blonde Girl? Okay, well forget it. I'm gonna, I wanna pick a super

01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:55.820
cute happy song and then do something evil to it. So, hey, if any, okay, if anybody wants

01:42:55.820 --> 01:43:01.200
me to make a hell edit and name it after them, pick me a song and I will make you an edit

01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:06.080
to it. This is what happened when Jamie realized that Waka Waka was not in DDR Max 1. Oh my

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.360
I can't believe it.

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:09.360
You want me to kick you?

01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:10.360
Everything's ruined.

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:13.080
You want me to kick you?

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:14.080
Somebody give me something.

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:15.760
Where's the Clifford ball?

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:18.200
The Clifford ball's in the studio, in the other studio.

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.380
We're in the big studio tonight.

01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:20.800
The Clifford ball's in the little studio.

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:24.300
You know, I bought this Clifford ball two weeks ago to throw it at Rob, and I haven't

01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:25.300
done it yet.

01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:28.000
It, like, lives here now, so.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Mwahaha.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
So.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.280
But, you know.

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:35.000
I can just play random sound effects the rest of the show.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:41.320
But you know everybody who at least you know posts on the SACBEN money forums know that

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:46.040
Rob is our big gay chilli.

01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:51.840
When you a boy, I think you look like a chilli.

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:55.280
Anyway enough with the sound effects.

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:57.800
I'm not allowed to have fun here.

01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:00.360
We are a serious talk show.

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:04.580
What other oh let's talk about let's talk about the future future thing.

01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:11.580
What other tournaments are you going to be attending in the future?

01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:41.180
That's actually triple threat is the one I'll be going to next because that's on August 1st and 2nd over at Sunnyvale

01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:45.740
Golfland check that out. I believe you have DDR spots going to be blowing up the spot with that one

01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:48.220
Okay, I have to ask though Thursday and Friday. What's up with that?

01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:51.740
Well, let's see

01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:55.220
Well, the main thing about trying to schedule turn me on Saturday and Sunday

01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:59.980
Well, a lot of people forget is Golfland is like all about the birthday parties and all those kind of things and you know

01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:10.980
That's a first priority. Thursday and Friday night, I mean, it's summertime. Most people that, you know, get off work around five or so, and it just kind of works. It's the best thing we can do for now.

01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:12.980
Are they going to be doing it at night, or...?

01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:15.980
As far as I know, yeah. Like, late afternoon into the night.

01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:22.980
I kind of want to go, but unfortunately I've got to work, and when you add a drive on top of that, it's not going to be very much fun for me to get out there, so...

01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:27.980
But I wish you guys the best of luck. It does sound like an awesome tournament. Very innovative new stuff that you guys are going to be doing there.

01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:33.340
Thank you. Hope it does go well, but that's part of thing about like determined stats bottom especially Mike no runs

01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:38.740
It's gone to a point where we kind of seen. Okay, everyone's skill and all that but there's only so much it's like

01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:43.780
Really to the casual player or like even observer a PA tournament is like watching grass grow

01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:48.140
I mean, it's like golf pre Tiger Woods. You had no interest in it and it was boring

01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:49.940
So now we're just trying to you know

01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:55.100
Mesh it in a few things like the one thing that we had was the wrestling theme this time around so it's like we have

01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:59.100
We have the Survivor Series where teams of four go against each other in PA tourneys.

01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:02.100
Do you think people would go to just a freestyle only tournament, though?

01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:08.100
Oh, absolutely. Freestyle to me, to make an analogy, it's like the NBA slam dunk contest.

01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:13.100
It's not something that has to go hand in hand. You've got to have your PA and your freestyle.

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:18.100
It's cool to have them. Because even at the PA only tournaments, it seems like there's always a little freestyle on the side.

01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:20.100
Oh, yeah. Well, freestyle...

01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:22.100
It's like you get a free cup of freestyle.

01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:25.700
exactly it's just the hint of you know just like in some freestyle term and

01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:31.900
some people who PA think they're PAing is looks good and what are some things

01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:39.140
in freestyle that piss you off or make you upset Oh melody sitting you have

01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:44.380
something you want to say that would be the hand slaps and the knee drops I

01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:48.140
don't know it's gone to the point where actually I've gone through quite a few

01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:51.420
attorneys where I haven't seen that many hand slaps or knee drops I kind of missed

01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:52.420
them.

01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:54.540
Does that mean we'll see them in your next routine?

01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:55.540
I don't know.

01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:59.620
If I get dared to do it, I will do it.

01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:00.900
Maybe I'll have to dare.

01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:01.900
Okay.

01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:04.140
I dare you on this show right here.

01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:05.380
Next routine.

01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:08.100
Hand slaps and knee drops.

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:09.100
Not only.

01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:10.100
Not only.

01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:11.100
As you're finished.

01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:12.100
As you're finished.

01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:13.100
Alright.

01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:14.100
Just so we got a few witnesses in here.

01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:15.100
In the last ten seconds.

01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:16.100
Alright.

01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:17.100
Handshake deal.

01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:18.100
There will be hand slaps and knee drops in my next routine.

01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:21.300
Now this is a great deal because I don't have to do a damn thing.

01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.140
I just get to point at them and make fun of them.

01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:27.900
Yeah, seriously, I guess the things that make me mad about freestyle, it's not so much.

01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.180
There's really nothing

01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:32.980
that makes me mad. Just the only thing I get in order for people who really don't put in effort to, like,

01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:36.220
entertain the crowd. The only good thing about that is that they've

01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:38.920
made the pot fatter for the winter, but past that, it's

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:41.020
a waste of time really for judges and

01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:42.060
for other people.

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:44.900
I mean, I guess if they get a cheap throw out of it and they paid their money,

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:47.940
I suppose it's all good to pass that.

01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:50.380
What would you rather see, you know,

01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:54.320
something that's really good improv or something that's been taken

01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.200
time to choreograph?

01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:00.280
I think choreography definitely because not only does it show skill but it also shows

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:01.780
like preparation. It shows that

01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:07.240
no, instead of coming up with something else, it comes in with a thought and of course you go

01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:09.320
through all the goods and bads. It's like a polished product.

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:13.320
Improv, some people can make it look good, you know, it's not easy but at the same time

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:17.400
in improv you pretty much have your bread and butter, you have one style and you stick with it

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.560
whereas in a choreograph

01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:22.560
you can kind of integrate all sorts of little things into one big extravaganza

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.880
now in the chat room they said okay dare him to do slaps and knee drops

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:30.560
on dynamite rave and I said okay no we gotta draw the line somewhere it's a

01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:31.320
little much

01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:34.940
I mean at least doing the hand drops and knee slaps whatever

01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:38.240
I know at least let me do it to like

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:42.320
well what's that D2R I guess you know at least make it you know D2R

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.720
surprisingly after looking at those steps

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:51.720
They actually look very freestyle-able. Not that I do it, but after this bit, I guess, damned now, you know.

01:48:51.720 --> 01:49:00.720
Well, actually, you know, speaking of songs, you know, what do you think is the best freestyle song in Max 2, as far as the new stuff?

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.720
Secret Rendezvous.

01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:04.720
I would definitely put that up.

01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:10.720
Because it's slow enough that you can put an extra beat in between all the notes, and so you can do more stuff.

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.720
What would you think?

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:24.720
Well, I think Secret Rendezvous actually on double Facebook is like double light is probably the best thing because especially for some people who play Pump It Up a lot, there's a lot of, it has sort of a five arrow thing where it's like the two middle and then you have like the ups and downs.

01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:32.720
So there are some people who if they rock at Pump It Up, they could like totally tear that up. I guess a new song, actually Spin the Disc is still my favorite.

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:45.720
Before I had a tasteless 8-ball joke when you're talking about wasting time for judges, but you know, I came all the way from San Francisco for this. It's turning into one. You know, time has passed, so I'll just hand the mic back to Jamie.

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:52.720
I may not be laughing on the outside, but inside I know I'm just doing cartwheels over that one.

01:49:52.720 --> 01:50:00.720
I'm being suggested by the chatroom that A Minute is also a good freestyle song.

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:06.720
They're saying that Secret Rendezvous is a song about lesbians.

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:10.720
Didn't we talk about that on the show a few weeks ago?

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:14.720
It is a lesbian song. We have the Brad Rant.

01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:17.720
Here comes Brad with his Secret Rendezvous Rant.

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:22.360
okay i'm sure we'd all like to think it's about lesbians but it does say in the song

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:26.760
he is mine or something like that unless it's a dyke a bull dyke then okay i guess

01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:34.360
no but it's transsexual see uh secret rendezvous it doesn't like take away the coolness of

01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:39.960
freestyle by having it about lesbians makes it even cooler and so fabulous so fierce

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:45.520
This is also another good song for freestyle.

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:49.360
I think that just really goes to show how really important it is to have great commercial

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:52.760
songs in the DDR, any kind of like the Monty game.

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:57.440
It's those songs that you're kind of familiar with, like A Minute or, you know, so fast.

01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:02.040
It's like songs from the 70s, a lot of us who grew up in that era or were kids and reminisced

01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:03.040
on that song.

01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:08.400
That's why I think commercial songs, especially if America got with it, although we've heard

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:12.600
from the DDR Max from E3 for America.

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:14.800
There's going to be commercial songs on there as well,

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:17.060
instead of economics, which was a great mix, by the way,

01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:18.560
but all Konami originals.

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:19.420
This one's going to be new.

01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:21.000
It's going to have some new stuff that's

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.440
never been anywhere else.

01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:27.240
I think KOA might be catching up to go off topic a little.

01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:29.620
You think it's going to go the way of Euromechs, though?

01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:31.880
Because I noticed there was a new little deal there

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:34.160
where they signed, they had some Zomba Records stuff.

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:38.760
So does that mean we're going to get Britney in USDDR?

01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:40.120
Because Britney was on Zomba.

01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:41.880
They already have the Britney's Dance Mix.

01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:43.640
I don't think that they need to integrate it.

01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:45.100
And I just want to say for a record,

01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:47.640
Britney's Dance Beat is a hard freaking game.

01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:50.080
No, that is a ridiculously easy game.

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:52.280
It's like the hardest song probably

01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:55.360
has the equivalent difficulty of maybe a three-footer.

01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:57.600
I want to know why you two have been playing this game.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:58.000
Dude, I got games.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Shoot yourselves now.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:51:59.720
Go to hell.

01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:00.220
Oh my god.

01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:02.280
Games Freedom Pass from Blockbuster.

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:05.280
And then I had to get it because, you know, it's ridiculously stupid.

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.280
That's right, Brad. Brittany is easy to find for all you haters out there, Brad.

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:12.280
How can you live with yourself? I mean, you have to go up to the cash register and say,

01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:17.280
I want to rent Brittany's dance whatever the fuck that was.

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:21.280
Actually, I played it at E3 when they were demoing it, and the funny thing was, it's like,

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:25.280
they had a challenge. You win a dance pad if you get the highest score.

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:28.280
Not only did I get the highest score, I beat the freaking guys who were demoing the game.

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:31.280
So, I thought that was just comedy in itself.

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:35.840
The only thing that would make me even want to get that game is my absolute love for the

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:37.160
first two Bust-A-Move games.

01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:43.080
In fact, well, I haven't necessarily played Dance Summit, but, you know, it is not Bust-A-Groove,

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:44.400
it is Bust-A-Move, goddammit.

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:47.200
Okay, there's Spike You in the Week number three.

01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:49.280
I know, but this was from something last night.

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:55.400
I was wearing my Bust-A-Groove shirt, and somebody in Jomadu said, is that from Bust-A-Groove?

01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:56.400
Oh, I love that game.

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:57.400
And I was like, yeah?

01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:01.400
Yeah, and I called her a dork and she got all upset.

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:03.400
No, um...

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:11.400
Oh, the only reason that I would buy the Britney's dance beat is so I could watch Britney Spears in skimpy outfits without having to watch it on MTV.

01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:13.400
It's animated, Dave.

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:16.400
Dude, it's animated video.

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:19.400
Just download porn, Dave. Get on the net and download porn.

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.400
Hey, I do.

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:22.400
Alright, thank you.

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:26.880
Maybe we should get, you know, get someone to hook you up with a copy of, you know, Final

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:27.880
Fuck X or something.

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:28.880
Well, you know, is she...

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:29.880
What the...

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:30.880
Let's hear it for the...

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:31.880
Your HP tastes so good.

01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:32.880
Yeah.

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:33.880
HP got lazy.

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:40.200
Well, you know, she was flipping off a lot of her fans in Mexico and stuff, and if she

01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:43.720
just keeps doing that and she loses popularity, maybe she'll turn the porn.

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:44.720
There you go.

01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:48.320
First of all, if she fell off the face of the planet and went the way of Mariah Carey,

01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:51.720
I'd be happy.

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:53.920
Ryan Carey is still around, supposedly.

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:56.400
I mean, nobody seems to care, but she is still around.

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.880
She went into a cuckoo bin for a few months.

01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:01.520
I know, but see, the fact is, no one cares.

01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:08.720
Anyways, as I was going to say about 10 or 15 comments ago,

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:12.440
DDR Max USA is supposed to have 20 licensed songs.

01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:15.360
And I'd like to actually see a lot of the songs from Beat Mania

01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:17.820
get ported over to it, because there's a lot of good songs

01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:19.920
that they just don't use anymore.

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:20.560
Really sad.

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:25.560
I was always surprised that Total Recall never made it into DDR.

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:30.560
Well, one of the ones I got actually recently for my sim was the Mjolnir Solid theme.

01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:35.560
And I have that for, and I'm also very pleased to see that someone made double steps for it,

01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:39.560
so I can't wait to play that one when I get my pads working again.

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:43.560
But yeah, definitely want to see some stuff, more stuff ported from BeatMania over.

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:47.560
So I'm pretty excited to see what they're going to have.

01:54:47.560 --> 01:55:02.560
I know one of them for sure is Overblast, because actually when I saw the trailer for Max for USA, that was the team music they were using, and Jason Deenose, who we all know is in front of the match here on DDR, had told me I was going to use that.

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:05.560
I also want to see Hellscraper.

01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:07.560
Hellscraper, whatever!

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:12.560
Why I use that, just play Mr. Bassman on the Disney Mix, man. It's fast enough and doggone it.

01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:14.560
That song sucks!

01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:17.560
Hey, let's not call names, people names here, dickhead.

01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:20.560
Um, no, the Hellscaper...

01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:22.560
Ducking Hardcore Max?

01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:25.560
Dude, I don't really like Hellscaper that much, I mean, I don't know why...

01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:29.560
Oh, Dave, did you play the, um, the simulator he had for the steps for it?

01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:30.560
Yes, I did.

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.560
It was good, man, come on.

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:34.560
I'd rather play V for the simulator something.

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:37.560
Tank, that song rocked.

01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:40.560
I haven't played that one.

01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:43.560
I'm still voting for Total Recall.

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:51.560
I'd like to throw in my vote for Baby Bae Gimme Your Love 2001, the remix that they have on BeatMania 7's mix. That is the most awesomest freaking thing ever.

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:57.560
And for the people who, you know, you might get a taste of Total Recall at the minute.

01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:09.560
But, you know, I think that there are so many good songs, though, that, you know, you had to imagine the staff, the people who choose the songs, the Konami of Japan, just sitting there going,

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:12.040
they're going, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what do we think, what do we think, what

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:13.560
do we think, what do we think?

01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:14.960
Because there's just so much good stuff.

01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.960
I mean, it's really hard to narrow it down, I think.

01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:23.920
I personally would like to see them, though, just instead of going back into their archive,

01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:26.320
just kind of make some new stuff up.

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:28.400
Just let LED go to town and I'll be happy.

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:35.240
Let's finally attack, let them go to town, then go visit some of those, just like how

01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:39.600
In Japan, they have the Dance Mania series, they're hooked up with Toshiba AMI, and all

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:40.600
that.

01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:43.000
Why don't you let them go to town with some people that put out the compilations here,

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.440
like maybe the Ultimate Dance Party or the Trans Party compilations here, that would

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:47.440
be pretty cool.

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:51.680
I think if DDR just went off the Dance Mania Diamond Millennium, hit the compilation, all

01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:56.040
in one mix, that one double CD, all in one mix, I think that would be the most greatest

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.040
thing in the world.

01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:59.040
That would be.

01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:03.520
Or, you know, like they did with Para Para, hook up with Avex, and throw some of the Avex

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:10.520
stuff in the DDR. The music that I've put out, you know, sponsored by Avex Tracks, was

01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:15.540
just some absolutely awesome stuff. Now, I know this was in Disney Mix, but I'd still,

01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:21.640
I know, just for comic value, I'd like to see Night of Fire in another DDR mix with

01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:27.480
that guy, Bucky, in the background, as the video. Bucky? Well, you weren't here for it.

01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:29.480
That was my VCD that I had.

01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:33.480
Oh, that's why I was off shuffling through AX.

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:38.160
Oh yeah, they should show the one the turn the beat around video they did where he does

01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:42.600
this little thing with his hands and blows this one chick's skirt up.

01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:43.600
It was great.

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:46.480
Is that the guy whose theme music was Night of Fire every time he showed it?

01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:47.480
Yes, that guy rocks.

01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:48.480
Rob told me about this one.

01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:49.480
Oh, he's so great.

01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:50.480
That sounds like...

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:51.480
He's my idol.

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.480
You gotta have goals.

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:56.840
Irene's yelling in the back they should put in music from Ranma.

01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:59.680
We wouldn't you just be happy if they had Genma come out and dance around?

01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:00.800
Hello, I'm a panda.

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:05.200
Be a happy little panda.

01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:09.760
Alright, we're getting ready to wrap up the show, so I leave Melody, Mel B, do you guys

01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:14.120
have any final comments you'd like to leave us with?

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:18.000
I just wanted to thank you guys for having me on board, I thought this place was just

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.000
pretty dope.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:24.520
I'd like to come in on a more regular basis actually, and for everyone else out there,

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:29.200
freestyling, PA-ing, whatever the hell you do, just don't give me that funk or anything

01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:36.200
else. I don't want to catch the VD or Herpes or all that other stuff. And check out ddrspot.com,

01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:43.240
come to Triple Thread, and if nothing else, just be true to yourself and, well, gosh,

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:50.240
I'm terrible at these inspirational speeches. Be excellent to each other. Party on. We're

01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:54.240
We're always glad to have you guys on whenever you feel like coming back.

01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:57.240
Yeah, definitely. Come back any time, you guys. You're always welcome.

01:58:57.240 --> 01:58:59.240
Even next week, if you guys happen to come to the party Saturday...

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:01.240
Ooh, I didn't say that over the air, did I?

01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:02.240
No.

01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:04.240
My roommate's back there going,

01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:05.240
Oh, God!

01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:07.240
Oh, yeah, yes.

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:15.240
I'd like to announce that we'll be hopefully making a trip down to Pleasanton-Qsar on the 10th next week to do SAC Attack 3.

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:18.240
We will have Team SAC back.

01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:24.600
take that back anyways but so we'll be down there I heard that they just got a

01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:28.760
brand new fifth mix machine so I'll be willing to break that in and kick

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:34.140
anyone's ass in Q's are I will take the orange lounge remote to that location so

01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:37.960
if you guys want to meet us there and talk to us and make a cameo on the show

01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:40.860
that'd be great maybe we should make a mention of our exploits from the first

01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:44.640
team sack it should be from probably about 7 p.m. to midnight we'll probably

01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:46.760
We do like a half day pass down there on that Saturday.

01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:48.720
So just come on down, say hi.

01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:51.080
You'll definitely recognize us.

01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:51.880
Oh, yes.

01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:52.380
All right.

01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:53.920
We'll be the ones meeting everybody.

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:55.840
Next week on the show, we have, don't forget,

01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:58.680
we've got Jazz and DDR Mike are going to be joining us.

01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:00.680
And they're some of the regulars over in Concord.

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:02.600
So they'll be joining us next week

02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:04.440
to talk about Lord knows what.

02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:06.880
But they'll be able to plug whatever they want.

02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:07.760
I guess that's it.

02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:09.960
Any last thoughts, Jamie?

02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:11.240
I want another donut.

02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:12.560
All right, good night, everybody.

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:13.680
Thanks for being here.

02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:17.400
And we're going to have to do our fortune cookie message on the fly tonight, so we might

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:20.040
get one more fuck up before the show's over, but we're going to try it.

02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:21.040
I don't fuck up.

02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:22.040
What are you talking about?

02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:23.040
Goodnight everybody.

02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:24.040
No, not that.

02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:25.040
It's the sound part.

02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:26.040
You'll do just fine.

02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:27.040
Here we go.

02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:28.040
Let's try it.

02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:29.040
Because I'm perfect.

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:31.640
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:35.480
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:41.680

02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:43.360

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:47.280
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:53.500
Because I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, no one gives a fuck.

02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:58.560
And as a special bonus, because I was too fucking lazy to edit the sound file, last

02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:00.720
week's fortune cookie message of the day.

02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.520
Kids, that glue you use in school, it's made from dead horses.

02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:09.240
No Wilbur, it's just a sprain.

02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:12.780
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
