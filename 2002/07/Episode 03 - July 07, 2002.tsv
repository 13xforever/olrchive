50783	52523	2-1-2-fuck you!
52563	54024	You have no morals, darling.
54304	58465	I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching case of herpes.
59186	61527	Kiss my grip, nooch.
61547	63908	Mecca lecca hi, mecca hi-dee-ho.
64008	66088	Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.
66328	67469	Me too!
67709	68209	Fucker, yeah?
68389	69370	I'm working on it.
70090	70550	Loser.
70670	71190	Lane!
72211	73131	On the side of my face.
74116	78921	Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.
79002	84688	Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.
86998	89420	I am your singing telegram
117078	118660	We have a substitute teacher for you tonight.
118700	122523	Everyone say hello to the lovely Irene, or as some simply call her, the Rice Princess.
122803	123324	Hi kids.
124204	126786	Co-hosting for us once again, filling in for the second week in a row.
126826	127987	Yes, that's true.
128408	129989	I apologize for the late start there.
130089	131510	It took us a while to get started.
132011	132952	We spilled some water.
133012	135614	We had a hazard spill when the show started.
135634	136675	It was a flood.
137736	139217	We're doing the show underwater tonight.
140706	147368	And then I realized the microphones weren't even on, so tonight's just a crazy-ass night already, but that's okay.
148649	153451	I'd like to introduce all the other guests we have for you tonight, because we actually have a manageable amount of people in the house tonight.
153471	154571	So everybody say hello to Brad.
154911	155651	Hello to Brad.
156232	157152	You got anything to say, Brad?
159773	160893	He tried burping, didn't you?
161213	162674	Everybody say hello to Dave over there.
165245	165505	Hi.
166065	166366	Hi.
166726	169107	And then say hello to Matt, also known as Loki.
169347	169687	Hello.
170367	170667	All right.
172928	176790	This is episode number three for July the 7th of 2002.
178030	182292	We'll be talking to all our guests a little bit later, but first a quick break.
182312	183753	You have any other thoughts for us, Irene?
184802	188143	Um, I'm mad at Taco Bell, but... We'll get into that a little later.
188964	191605	We got all sorts of crap on the plate for you tonight.
192525	195186	The Solo 2000 stuff, when will it end?
195366	195707	Never.
196867	202809	A review of the brand new Step Mania that's out, and talk about DDR emulators and whether they're any good or not.
204190	208812	A new Bomani game being location tested right now, and all sorts of other crap coming up for you.
209312	217997	But first off, I'm going to dedicate this first song, if you're listening out there, Travis over at understationlive.org, who says I never name his show by name, so there you go.
218897	221699	A lovely show, which I co-host on Saturday nights at 6.30.
222039	224320	I'm dedicating this song to you because I know it's your favorite.
224440	224841	Enjoy.
225941	228303	Sorry, I didn't like the music about it.
228323	230404	Yeah, drop the bomb.
230544	232185	Drop the bomb.
245595	246375	and more than a fifth.
246395	247796	It's close if you don't know what it takes.
247816	249676	You know that terrorists always make some mistakes.
249716	251196	What we gotta do is build momentum.
251336	252837	If we need the right tools, invent them.
252857	254397	Drive the waves, time, come through the rhythm.
254437	255938	The march of the future is begun, get with them.
255958	257418	The rage is to generate all mighty power.

478659	479584	Thanks for watching!
515533	516454	and many more.
516494	516855	Thank you.
537369	539130	Bitch, get a new song.
539770	542171	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
542191	543952	That's right, you skanky bitch.
544032	549474	Anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio for July 7th of 2002.
550574	551935	Kind of a slow news week.
551995	553856	Not a whole lot to talk about tonight.
553956	554956	So, I don't know.
555016	558978	I think we're just going to kind of just talk about whatever we want tonight.
559018	560478	Maybe we won't even talk about Bomani at all.
560498	561039	What do you guys think?
561119	561919	I'll sing for you.
562319	562519	Oh, what?
562779	564900	And I... No, no, you're fired.
565580	567221	Everybody dance now
567461	569562	Oh God, we want people to listen to this show, Christ.
587109	602645	decided to get a solo 2000 machine pulled from a bowling alley because of images of ecstasy and vodka and drugs and alcohol and all sorts of naughty things and nurses with syringes in their asses and all sorts of things.
604949	619080	Basically, the only new news item I've got for you guys is that DDR Freak, one of the biggest, I'm sure you guys have heard of it, the biggest DDR website out there, has drafted a response to the controversy.
619360	623083	And you can read it over on DDR Freak's website, but I'll give you some of the highlights for you.
623123	624304	Basically what they're saying is...
625645	626326	A, The Pills.
627308	638002	They're saying when the Youth Advocacy Coalition saw The Pills and I'm Alive, they immediately assumed it was something like ecstasy, but actually, if you look very closely, you'll see it says it's medicine.
641641	646466	It says the word medicine if you look very carefully at the little words.
647006	648127	It says medicine.
648187	649228	Yeah, I'll be damned!
650149	652552	Because none of us are ever watching the backgrounds that closely.
652592	653553	You know what I found out?
653693	653913	What?
654573	658297	This youth coalition, they're just un-American communist pigs, you know?
658758	659658	And how did you find that out?
659678	660519	Did you sleep with one of them?
660539	661861	No, no, no, just look at them, they...
662541	664464	Thank you for watching!
677835	679115	Okay.
679215	682596	Chatroom responding that this really isn't a big deal.
682756	690239	This story is getting blown out of proportion because we're talking about one girl in one group getting one machine getting kicked out of a bowling alley.
691199	699262	The only reason I see it as a big deal is because now it's getting all this media exposure and it is being dug into the ground and beaten with a stick repeatedly.
699702	702063	And it has kind of become a bigger deal than it should be, really.
702623	705325	So I think that's kind of why it needs to be discussed.
705605	706546	Does that make any sense at all?
707186	709688	Yeah, but if we beat it to the ground, then it'll never come back.
710428	711108	I've done it before.
712769	717072	Anyway, also in the response, they also brought up the Dr. Mario point.
718213	721515	Why, if you're going after this, why not ban Dr. Mario forever?
721934	722775	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
737884	738965	That's a good point.
739045	747434	And honestly, if you think that's inappropriate, go to Gulfland on a weekend when the summer park is open or whatever, the water park.
747754	750557	There are girls dressed in way less clothing than that.
751418	752018	I'm sorry.
753279	757103	I just think that it's funny that they compare DDR to Animaniacs in any fashion.
757163	757744	That's just funny.
759796	767339	Also, they're talking about syringes, saying that the syringes were mistaken to be an illegal drug instead of something medical like vaccinations.
767379	772642	And if you notice in some screenshot that I don't see on my screen, syringes are flying around.
772662	776883	They're doctors wearing red crosses, so that means it's medical syringes.
776943	777444	You know what?
777944	780545	Did they not... Bend over, you might feel a prick.
781705	782206	A prick.
782886	783446	You know what?
784006	788068	Did they not make the connection pills, syringes...
789059	791862	Nurse, Medical, Hello?
792462	796967	What does any of that, you know, together have to do?
796987	798829	And then they say about the cocktails.
799830	804474	The cocktail images in the song Club Tropicana do not use cocktail glasses.
804754	808198	Instead, they use glasses more commonly used for smoothies and milkshakes.
808518	809699	And they say, you don't know.
810099	813483	Basically, the end of this argument says, you don't know what's in those drinks.
813963	814283	I bet, sure, sure.
841613	849105	Puzzle Bobble Playboy Pinball Oh, Playboy Pinball, yes Anyway You know what?
849165	855434	No one plays Club Tropicana anyway So they don't have to worry about that there Yeah, nobody plays that song anyway I know, come on
856920	863465	Alright, that's all I really want to say about the Solo 2000 stuff, because we talked about this week on week on week.
863745	868129	And the chat room is saying some things about it, and I'm being given some URLs, so I'll check those out during the next break.
868149	872392	And if there's anything more revealing, we'll talk about that during the next break.
872732	873673	So are we just going to drop it?
874774	877616	Are we just going to... I don't know, is there anything you guys want to say about this?
877676	879098	Because we talked about it too much.
879318	881500	But it is basically the biggest news story.
881560	883882	It's something that everybody's talking about.
883922	888226	It seems like every day somebody new reads this story and goes, Why doesn't that bitch just shut up?
888986	889827	Yeah, why doesn't she?
890268	891469	No, but let's not keep going on this.
891509	893410	Let's just drag it on too long.
894792	896473	But I hate when, you know, the nerds... Oh.
898834	899395	Thank you for watching!
915610	916190	They're fake.
916210	916551	No, they're not.
937338	947631	Well, if, you know, these images of drugs and stuff are causing kids to do drugs, my God, we must have a world full of just drugged out, crazy ass, stupid people just walking around.
947952	948993	Newsflash, we do.
951076	951516	You know what?
953258	955419	I don't see a lot of druggies playing video games.
955479	957360	I think they're too strung out to be playing them.
957380	959081	Apparently you don't go to Country Club Lanes very much.
959141	960382	No, no, no.
960422	965244	Those are like the... I'm not going to even discuss that because I might get shot.
965264	972527	I don't see how they can play video games and be high at the same time or whatever because they'd be too strung out.
973568	974088	Oh, okay.
974168	975269	Well, then I retracted.
976249	976569	I don't know.
976609	978650	Pinballs kind of always struck me as a stoner game.
978690	979211	Is it just me?
980336	981297	Where the hell did you get that?
981317	981718	I don't know.
981938	984001	Just something about all the swirly things.
984141	984601	Yeah.
986224	987866	I think it's a good time to change the subject.
989382	994103	Let's talk about, Matt, you're kind of the emulation expert of the group.
995003	1002645	I don't know, is it more appropriate to call these things emulators or simulators, these DDR... I think it'd just be better to call them sims.
1002805	1003625	Simulators, okay.
1003685	1010227	So we got major news going on in the Dance Dance Revolution simulator world this week, so why don't you tell us a little more about that.
1010487	1016591	Okay, well, first off, we have the release of Step Mania 3.0, the beta 1 of it.
1016791	1018072	It's brand new.
1018092	1023315	It's got the Max interface on it, including the groove generator and all that kind of stuff.
1023335	1027938	It's actually pretty close to being perfect as far as interface goes.
1028659	1032942	One of the nice features I like about it is the addition of an editor.
1033262	1034703	It's just like the home versions.
1034743	1035963	You can make your own tracks.
1036024	1039806	You can help sync the ones that you have to fix them and that kind of thing.
1041872	1048898	And for those of the people that are listening that don't know what it is, can you explain some of the stuff, like the groove generator and all that?
1048998	1049578	Yeah, okay.
1049638	1051580	Well, the groove generator, you've seen it in Max.
1051620	1054702	It looks like the chart that's got the, basically, graphs.
1054742	1056704	You've got air and voltage and that kind of thing.
1056724	1063549	It kind of tells you, aside from saying, you know, this is a kata or, you know, an 8-foot or whatnot, it tells you why it's rated that.
1063569	1065551	It has a lot of jumps, tons of freeze arrows.
1066351	1068832	A lot of crazy steps, that type of thing.
1069012	1074034	It's just to help you out in determining whether or not a song is difficult or not.
1074774	1076055	Really, it's kind of pointless.
1076435	1078556	No one really looks at that as far as I'm concerned.
1078836	1079556	It's pointless.
1080536	1082697	I can say there is one reason for the groove generator.
1082877	1086699	A lot of times people want to know how many freezes there are in a song and jumps.
1086779	1090220	People that are new to DDR, because I've been teaching some people how to play DDR recently,
1090740	1091981	Dance With Intensity, Step Mania
1118840	1126166	Setmania, obviously, it's been pretty buggy in the past as far as what I've been, because I've used both of them.
1126627	1132672	I've been actually testing three right now, and I found it, it's pretty good so far.
1132772	1136455	I mean, obviously, it's the first beta, so it's going to have tons of bugs in it.
1137615	1139796	The gameplay itself is pretty good.
1139876	1145177	I like the fact that you can use BMS files as well as DWI files, which is awesome.
1145537	1150678	They've added a random select just like you'd find in the arcade.
1150938	1156840	And just to interject for those that don't know, the BMS files and DWI files are the actual list of steps.
1157300	1165302	BMS being a kind of old format when these simulators were first coming around, and DWI was kind of when Dance with Intensity came in and kind of gave us a new format.
1165582	1165862	In fact,
1166102	1167543	Will that also support Lips and Chains?
1185549	1186270	I'm just kidding.
1186910	1188772	How about the Bunga Bunga Simulator?
1189652	1192855	I thought I'd try something here because I know you guys haven't seen this, right?
1192895	1194016	Have you seen the new Step Mania, Dave?
1194036	1195017	No.
1195037	1195938	Okay, and you guys haven't seen this?
1196218	1202323	I'm going to try to load it up right now so they can see this and we can kind of get their reaction because this thing is pretty damn accurate to the arcade.
1202343	1202983	You might be amazed.
1203003	1203844	So I'm going to load this up.
1204585	1208488	Now, this might just crash the whole damn show and we'll lose all our listeners.
1208508	1209869	That's okay because no one listens to the show anyway.
1209889	1210329	So here we go.
1211370	1213172	Oh, okay.
1214071	1214391	DDL Max!
1231565	1239673	So, we've got basically, it looks like Max, they even have this stupid little logo that's, you know, making fun of Max.
1239693	1240634	S&M Max.
1241435	1242116	S&M Max.
1242396	1243237	S&M.
1243337	1248302	It's the 7th Mix Red Flames logo.
1248422	1249563	Everybody's waiting for you.
1249643	1250464	And then they've got the 5th Mix.
1250524	1252506	And they've got Rage holding his head like he hurt himself.
1252526	1252987	Whoa, this is nice.
1256373	1258575	Pretty much everything looks like it's supposed to.
1260497	1263480	They even have the Oni courses, which is nice, that you can do.
1269286	1274011	They just redid a couple of the graphics, but basically it looks exactly the same as it actually is.
1274111	1287166	One of the things that's a little bit different from SetMini before is once you've selected what mode you're going to play, it kind of goes into something that looks like a fourth mix screen, where you have the different categories you can select from, different folders.
1290114	1295678	One also cool thing about it is they've added a few additional features that you find in a home version or an arcade.
1296478	1302342	Some of these are like the ability to do different types of visualizing stuff.
1302382	1305584	For instance, you know, in an arcade you will have Boo and that type of thing.
1305924	1310467	Well, they've added some different ones like Drunk, which is the air fourth wave.
1311388	1316851	Also, it's kind of like Boost, but it boosts and then slows down, boost slows down, and makes it really hard to find...
1318212	1325600	You know, to read the steps, and then also they have one that's called Scroll, which is your Star Wars type of scrolling mode.
1325820	1326661	So what kind of scroll?
1327001	1328463	It's like Star Wars mode, right?
1329444	1330385	Wow, that was weird.
1331966	1333428	I guess it gives you, I've never been drunk.
1333748	1338954	I mean, yeah, I'm the little peruv on here, but I guess that's what it looks like to be drunk when you're playing DDR.
1340123	1348534	I have to exit out of it because I think it's fucking with our levels too bad here, so... Oh, it's telling me we might be having dropouts on the stream right now, so I apologize for that.
1348574	1352579	See, I told you when we went into the emulator, it might F things up, but... Alright.
1353723	1357045	But anyway, so basically, so far, it's pretty good.
1357385	1360147	It's going to be a little bit buggy, but they're releasing betas.
1360247	1363989	They've released beta 2 today, so it looks pretty good.
1364009	1367451	They're keeping up on updating it, and we'll have to see how it goes.
1367872	1380840	But if you decide that you don't want to stick with Step Mania and you want to actually stick with DWI, which is the other simulator out there, I've been informed that DWI 2.0 will be coming out in the next couple weeks.
1381740	1385223	What are some things that everybody has to look forward to in DWI 2.0?
1386263	1391166	I believe that they're going to have a groove radar in it, just like Stepmania.
1392607	1396830	They were supposed to be redoing the interface, and I forget what else they're adding.
1396850	1399031	Hopefully they fixed some of the bugs that are in it.
1399532	1401493	But I don't think too much is changing, actually.
1402594	1404495	It looks like it's going to be pretty much the same.
1405596	1409158	I'll stick with Stepmania right now, but I really hate that load time.
1410919	1411939	That's pretty much it so far.
1412059	1420102	I'm being told that the stream might be dropping quite a bit, so I'm trying to cut everything out that might be taking up bandwidth.
1420142	1425223	So I apologize for the drops in the stream, but bear with us, and hopefully it should be okay now that I turned off StepMania.
1425283	1426264	So that's StepMania.
1426624	1427144	Woo!
1427164	1428765	Thank you, StepMania.
1429945	1432086	Well, no, I'm trying to do too damn much on the system as a problem.
1432106	1436307	I probably should have loaded up StepMania on one of the other computers in here, but then we wouldn't have had the sounds, so...
1438952	1444077	So I guess this begins the talk of emulation versus the real thing.
1445418	1453486	I see this happen a lot on a lot of message boards where people go, well, Max Unlimited, it isn't that bad because I passed it in the emulator.
1455771	1460574	Well, you know, that was a problem before they were saying that the emulators were way too easy.
1461035	1469000	One of the things, though, that I've been seeing, though, is there have been a lot of these suggestions that they see out there like, this emulator's too easy, you know, it's harder to play it in the arcade.
1469380	1470761	Well, they'll try to go ahead and fix it.
1470801	1476965	In fact, Dance with Intensity, you can actually adjust the levels so that it's exactly like playing it in the arcade.
1477145	1481168	In fact, what I like about the emulators is you can make it really freaking hard.
1481704	1486949	There was a guy out there, goes by the name of BimaniRuler, for a while that was doing step files.
1486969	1488110	They were freaking impossible.
1488810	1493975	I mean, if any of this stuff was out in the arcade, it would definitely be maximum limited, hands down.
1493995	1496677	It is just some of the hardest stuff I've ever seen.
1497558	1503583	And this stuff is awesome, and that's one of the cool things about the emulators, is you can actually make them harder than the arcades.
1503843	1508906	Yeah, and also with making them harder, you can change the difficulty, like Matt said.
1509506	1516270	And so that, you can make it harder, and you can add all these crazy things, like in Step Mania, the drunk mode and dizzy mode.
1516870	1521833	You can have it go, I think, a little bit offbeat or something, and make them wave back and forth.
1522453	1523554	Just all this crazy stuff.
1523674	1526496	And people do it, yeah, well, I passed it on the emulator.
1526536	1527396	Yeah, with your fingers.
1527416	1529037	That's like playing Thumb Thumb Revolution.
1529097	1530698	It doesn't qualify as anything.
1531399	1535109	I can full combo max 300, but that doesn't give a shit about what I can do in the real thing.
1537057	1541779	Oh, I was just going to say, this is a discussion of emulators versus the real thing like the arcade.
1542480	1547462	Okay, well, I think the original purpose was to play it with your feet.
1547922	1551004	You know, that's why the arcade version is playing with your feet.
1551124	1563070	So I think that emulator versions aren't, if you're playing with your hands, it's not exactly the same as the original intent of it, but everybody has their own thing about it, so...
1564221	1580264	Okay, well say somebody has one of those little Kiki Joy things, and if you don't know what a Kiki Joy is, that basically will take a PlayStation input and turn it into a USB input, so effectively you could take a Konami pad or a Red Octane pad, whatever DDR pad you use, and then plug it into your computer, which these emulators will recognize.
1580705	1582325	So now, once again, it is a feet game.
1582865	1584745	So, does that change things?
1585586	1587206	Yeah, because the Homepad sucks.
1588308	1588648	Well, they do.
1589589	1597298	Yeah, and if you have, like, unlimited amounts of time and money, then you can be like Matt here and build your own metal pads, and then we're like, you know, we're cooking with gas.
1597378	1597959	That's pretty cool.
1598499	1607990	But, you know, I've never played on a metal homemade pad, but I don't think it's ever going to be as good as, like, an arcade... Hey.
1608631	1608851	Okay.
1610229	1613111	Yeah, if you touch me there again, I'm calling the cops.
1613291	1614752	Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to derail it, but yeah.
1615153	1622298	The main normal, like, the standard original stages are the best stages, and that's why I play in the arcade.
1623499	1625501	Nobody's homemade pad is gonna be as good as those.
1625541	1637131	I mean, I'm sure they're gonna be good, maybe just up there, but unless you buy an actual Konami original dance stage, which are like a thousand dollars or something, if I'm not right, or wrong, or whatever, they're fucking awesome.
1637371	1637931	Okay, sorry.
1638832	1648838	Okay, well let's say you went and you spent, let's say you even spent like the thousands of dollars to buy yourself like an arcade platform and you figured out how to hook it into your computer and everything.
1650338	1652099	How does it still compare to the arcade?
1652880	1664166	Is it, you know, to take the emulator itself versus DDR, would it still be, you know, if I pass something on this emulator, if I pass Maximum Limited with my arcade stage at home, is that still, you know, as cool as doing it in the arcade or what?
1665174	1669717	Well, I think that if you had it on the same difficulty, because, you know, you can make it ridiculously easy to pass.
1670338	1674040	Like, you can miss, like, 30 notes and have the equivalent to missing one in the arcade.
1674520	1684407	But, yeah, if you put it on the original, you know, difficulty, and then, you know, just bust out a few songs that you could do, I'm sure that you could just go to the arcade and do the same thing.
1684447	1686929	It wouldn't be any harder, unless the difficulty on the arcade was changed.
1687689	1693313	If that were the case, where if you, say, you had basically an arcade set up at home...
1694077	1694944	on the emulator
1695515	1703561	I think the only benefit to going back to the arcade would be to get crowds and stuff like that, to make it cheaper at your house, you know, I don't know.
1703801	1706263	Which is an interesting point that's being raised in the chat room right now.
1706903	1713648	Jabberwocky again saying, you know, you've also got things affected like acoustics in the arcade and the dance pad, etc.
1713928	1715929	Kind of bringing up that whole arcade environment, you know.
1717050	1719592	It kind of makes me wonder, I guess this is a completely different kind of question.
1720052	1723855	If you spent the thousands of dollars to get a machine in your home, would you still go to the arcade?
1724195	1725116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1745026	1749116	Oh, yeah, I mean, honestly, if anyone could have a DDR machine at home, they would.
1749277	1754670	I mean, you know, there's obvious pros and cons, but, I mean, people realize that there are
1755646	1756106	and many more.
1778619	1783461	We're getting a question from the chat room for you guys from DSCS SoCalKicks.
1783561	1791125	He wants to know, if you have the simulator, would you still buy the games when they came out for the console, or would you just download them?
1791545	1791905	What do you think?
1793243	1793863	I can answer that.
1794244	1796164	I definitely buy all the games when they come out.
1796285	1798506	The thing is, I buy them for different reasons.
1798526	1800467	I'm kind of sad I buy them to make edits.
1801127	1804729	That's what I used to do, and I actually own quite a few.
1804809	1807910	Fourth, third, fifth, max, even though it doesn't work.
1808331	1812953	Conomics, USA, Best Hits, Disney's Rave at one point.
1813753	1815834	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1836131	1841755	Another thing, which is why I first got 4th Mix and Extra Mix is because of Challenge Mode.
1842475	1847999	And that, for me, is really fun because last week I started doing it again at Rob's house because it's fun.
1848599	1849500	Did it again?
1850040	1850961	Yes, I did it again.
1851101	1852021	Oops, I did it again.
1853502	1860727	And it's just got some crazy shit that you have to do, like hidden where you have to get all goods or something like that.
1860907	1865170	And all this stuff that you would never normally try to do, like keep your bar at...
1865510	1866291	Thank you for watching!
1880888	1881829	Thank you for watching!
1898568	1900170	and they're going to stop making the games.
1900210	1903893	Well, that could be the ultimate worst case scenario.
1904413	1909958	But then again, you're giving them all this money to buy these games when you can just get it for free online.
1909998	1911280	It's kind of a tough decision.
1912621	1913622	Personally, I'm poor.
1914002	1916584	So I would probably download it online if I could.
1916925	1921449	But I would still support Konami if I could.
1922688	1923489	If I could.
1924890	1927612	I've got a huge collection as far as songs go and stuff.
1927752	1930814	And I have the metal pads and the whole setup and everything.
1931574	1934696	And I actually built that because I was like, oh, I'm going to save myself tons of money.
1934716	1935997	I'm not going to go to the arcade.
1936017	1937859	I'm not going to buy the home versions.
1938499	1939560	That never happened.
1940140	1951010	I ended up spending all that money, and I haven't actually, it's just the problem is it's too bulky to set up all the time, unless I actually have a nice place to set it up and keep it set up.
1951450	1957335	That's why the home versions are awesome, because you can actually just, okay, I feel like playing Fifth Mix, pop it in, and away you go.
1959767	1968138	And also along the same lines, realistically, most people won't be able to have an arcade set up unless they've got a lot of money.
1968718	1976228	So I would see that if they don't buy the home versions, they would at least be supporting Konami by going to the arcades and playing the actual arcade games.
1976667	1983330	I don't know how much money Konami makes off of us importing their Japanese machines into American arcades and then putting money in it.
1983490	1986812	I honestly don't see that Konami makes any money off the import scene.
1987052	1987412	I don't know.
1987512	1987872	I don't know.
1987932	1989493	I'm probably not telling facts here.
1989573	2001359	I mean, somebody else might in the chatroom know more than me on it, but I honestly think, you know, as people have said before, Konami really doesn't give a shit about us, and they probably are making all their money overseas back, you know, at their home.
2001919	2003360	So, if anybody else wants to say anything...
2004140	2004841	and their home.
2005061	2005762	Go to your home.
2007323	2011005	I'm waiting to see the DDR Max for the US.
2012146	2015149	We're talking songs that we've supposedly never seen before.
2015189	2018771	I hope they don't give us anything like After the Game of Love again.
2021373	2024595	But, uh... Well, for those that don't know the first... Well, I know all you guys know.
2024615	2033039	But for those that are listening out there that may not know, the first announced song was Over... Over... It was either Overblast or Overdoser.
2033059	2034059	I always get the two mixed up.
2034160	2034420	Overblast.
2034440	2035280	It's the one by LED.
2035300	2035920	It's Overblast.
2035960	2036261	Thank you.
2037221	2041223	Overblast by LED is one of the tracks that's going to be new to America.
2041243	2046686	It was never in any Japanese DDR game, but it's going to be new to America.
2046986	2047086	So...
2047566	2048348	And I think it sucks.
2048889	2049630	You think it sucks.
2049971	2050912	I'll play it.
2050932	2053837	I've got it, so I'll play it for the listening audience out there when we go into our next break.
2055320	2059708	Is that, I know you just said it's not in any of the other games, but is that the one that's going to be in six style for home version?
2059948	2060770	One of the unlockable songs?
2063018	2065320	I have no idea, maybe the chat room can help you out with that.
2065380	2072243	It's already, it's Beat Mania, I believe it's... Actually, let me plug the chat room real fast, because, well, I got that brought up.
2072303	2073304	Let me plug the chat room real fast.
2073344	2078006	If you guys want to join us in our chat room, unfortunately, we don't have a direct easy way from the website just yet.
2078046	2079047	We're kind of looking into that.
2079107	2083469	Unfortunately, all the Java people want tons and tons of money for me to get an easy client to do it.
2083929	2091013	So all you have to do is you just join IRC, and you're going to connect to an other side IRC server, and that'll be on your list of options in MIRC.
2092113	2099536	One server you can use is irc.eggheads.org And then you're just going to join channel with a little pound sign, Orange Lounge.
2099696	2101357	And that's where our chatters are.
2101477	2103097	So come join us if you can.
2104018	2104458	Sorry to interrupt.
2104478	2105158	Go ahead and finish the talk.
2106719	2107459	It's a party in there.
2107479	2108259	Go in the chat room now.
2108820	2109200	It's great.
2109300	2113061	Everybody's taking their shirts off and there's orgasms and stuff.
2113802	2114302	Orgasms.
2115402	2115882	Okay, anyway.
2116403	2117263	Back to the topic.
2119580	2125302	So anyways, since we kind of just switched topics there, I have no idea where we are.
2125322	2129583	Yeah, I believe I was saying Overblast sucked, but... Overblast?
2129863	2130543	See, I haven't heard it yet.
2130563	2133084	So, okay.
2133544	2138625	It just reminds me of Spin the Disc, and I think we all know what Spin the Disc was like in the arcade.
2138645	2139486	Spin the Disc is awesome.
2139766	2141666	It's an awesome song, the steps suck.
2141966	2144967	Okay, well, it's definitely not a... was that an 8-footer it said it was?
2145367	2147308	Oh man, it should be like a 5-footer.
2147568	2147948	It's pretty...
2148288	2151511	That's something we should probably talk about pretty soon, is the difficulty rating.
2151532	2153353	What's Konami doing in these new songs?
2153854	2162283	They're giving all these songs really high difficulty ratings, but to me, I don't know, and to me and a lot of my friends and stuff, they're seeming really easy.
2162343	2164285	I don't know, I think Konami just is...
2165165	2165486	I don't know.
2166346	2168588	Maybe they're going to start making 13-footers or something.
2168888	2169188	I don't know.
2169288	2169548	All right.
2169568	2172410	Well, we'll take a quick break, and then we'll come back and we'll talk about just that, Brad.
2172570	2173251	And Taco Bell.
2173291	2173631	All right.
2173711	2174051	Taco Bell.
2174411	2176553	So you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2176593	2178214	We hope you're having a good time listening.
2178394	2186379	Visit our website at orangelounge.skie.cx and drop us an email and let us know what you think.
2186579	2188941	orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
2189461	2192583	And here it is, as promised, LED with Overblast.
2192823	2196004	And it may or may not be changed, remixed for the home version.
2196044	2196985	We don't know just yet.
2197285	2199766	This is the Beatmania version, so it'll be kind of close.
2199987	2200707	So, here you go.
2261524	2262405	I believe!
2262446	2262986	I believe!
2263046	2263827	It's my destiny
2306458	2307459	Thanks for watching!
2397167	2398389	Thanks for watching!
2520832	2521394	Thanks for watching!
2548314	2552437	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
2552677	2553237	Extreme Bomani Radio.
2553257	2554618	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
2572964	2578507	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, our live little talk program here.
2578607	2581028	Jamie Summers, my co-host, is out for tonight.
2581068	2582648	So filling in, we have the lovely Irene.
2582668	2583629	Hi.
2583789	2585530	And a whole panel of people here.
2585610	2588091	We've got Matt, Loki, Dave, and Brad.
2588111	2590152	So say hello to everybody.
2592062	2593123	You gotta speak into the mic.
2593363	2597225	My left tit and right tit count separate people, so that's like five now.
2598526	2598966	Right.
2599006	2599626	You have tits?
2599806	2601567	I know, you're the skinniest guy I've ever seen.
2601607	2602207	You don't have tits.
2604255	2604656	Huh.
2606597	2606878	Yeah.
2606998	2607278	Anyway.
2610001	2619371	Those songs you just heard in that last break, we started off with LED Light from Beatmania 5th Mix and upcoming USA Max version with Overblast.
2619831	2627239	After that, we had from the Fantasia album, Vanessa May with Destiny and Dumond from 2DX 7th Style with Never Look Back.
2628259	2632262	And for those that don't know, because we seem to have a lot of new people listening tonight, so that's really awesome.
2632302	2634204	I thank all you guys for listening to our little show here.
2634244	2638467	We're in the third week of our new little experiment to try and do a Barmani talk show every week.
2638927	2647814	But when we're not doing talk, we have a music program that goes on, our Barmani Music and More show, that goes 24-7 on a dial-up friendly stream through Live 365.
2648074	2651036	And even though it's dial-up friendly, it still sounds pretty darn good.
2651056	2653298	I was really impressed with it, so we kept it dial-up friendly.
2653838	2674317	and we have all the 2DX, Beatmania, DDR, Parapara, we've got tons of songs there in addition to that we've got Dance Mania tracks, some of the best from that and then just all sorts of other random stuff occasionally you'll hear a Parappa, Unjamalami tune, something from Pump, something else music game related so do tune into that if you get a chance, that's running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
2674978	2679786	and we do archives of this show on, I don't know, when did we do it last week?
2679826	2680727	Monday or Tuesday night?
2681448	2682330	We did it on Monday night.
2682370	2683432	We rebroadcast the show.
2683452	2688961	We'll be doing some sort of regular schedule for the rebroadcast in the future but I don't know what that is just yet.
2690330	2693373	Anyway, before we went to break, we were talking about all sorts of stuff.
2693393	2699719	We were talking about the emulation, which kind of led into talk about DDR Max, which led into talk about the Max 2 unlocks.
2699960	2704024	Songs such as Spin the Disc, Burning Heat, Takume, I Feel.
2705005	2708688	And some folks on the panel here are a little bit disappointed with the steps.
2708808	2710250	So do you have something you want to say about that?
2710470	2710810	Yes.
2712051	2723861	Um, as my sweet, wonderful girlfriend here, I mean, my princess, said, um, you know, do they do, don't they, hey, I've got, I'm just teasing her and you know you can stick it.
2724581	2724841	Yeah.
2725162	2726082	Okay, anyway, um.
2728968	2729568	Excuse me.
2730209	2732070	God, that was bad.
2732450	2736252	Okay, so she was wondering, you know, don't they do sight tests on these machines?
2736272	2737713	You know, wouldn't people tell them?
2738113	2746097	And I think I figured out that, like, well, you know, secret songs like I Feel and stuff, they don't obviously sight test those because they want to keep them secret.
2746477	2749078	Well, you know, surprise, the secret is the steps suck.
2749739	2753661	Yeah, so, anyway, I think, I don't know, I guess...
2757752	2759074	Screw you and your computer.
2759194	2759854	Alright, I'm done.
2759874	2762156	No more sound effects.
2762817	2767421	Anyway, I think this new producer, I forgot his name, it's on the little machine.
2767862	2768683	I don't know if he's a new guy.
2768703	2769764	Yeah, it's some Japanese name.
2769884	2770985	Yeah, that's all you need to know.
2771165	2774648	Shihori Tetsuaki Minuko or something like that.
2774688	2776450	Minikiniko Okonomiyaki.
2777054	2790103	Um, uh, he's, I don't know, I guess he's just not trying very hard, because some of these steps, like, bring, he, you know, these aren't great, these aren't 9-3rds, these aren't katas, but I feel it's supposed to be a kata, it's like playing, what do you think?
2791004	2792065	I feel it's crap.
2792165	2799710	I mean, I love, I love the song, I love, I feel it's an awesome song, but the steps were just kind of like, okay, they're kind of...
2800951	2802774	It's kind of like, it reminded me a lot of Orion.
2802934	2808582	How the steps, they don't really go with the music, but when you play with your feet, it kind of makes a separate instrument.
2808682	2810324	It's kind of like an added percussion thing.
2810584	2814109	And that's kind of what they were doing with I Feel, except with Orion, it kind of works.
2814510	2816052	But with I Feel, it doesn't really.
2816072	2817334	It doesn't really add anything to the song.
2818075	2819376	They should make... Oh, excuse me, I burped.
2820057	2823401	On the standard steps, they do go with the song, from what I remember seeing of them.
2824082	2830470	Yeah, the maniac steps should have been the standard steps, and then, you know, there should be harder maniac steps.
2830750	2831771	Hopefully, well, we'll see.
2831831	2837298	I doubt they're going to do anything to upgrade it in the next version, but I really wish Konami would, you know, and start challenging us again.
2837618	2839199	The Maniac steps just didn't flow.
2839239	2841862	That's what I thought as far as the doubles were concerned.
2842242	2847086	They just, you know, you go, then it's just a really strange beat to it.
2847146	2851369	It's almost like drifting away, except drifting away made more sense.
2851409	2859976	It's kind of a faster beat and then it gets slower and gets faster and slower as far as the synth goes in the background, which the steps sync up to.
2861137	2865640	I feel, tried to do something like that, but it was just kind of all messed up.
2865700	2866001	It's just...
2866781	2867943	Not fun to play at all.
2882642	2892849	You know, the only two 9-footers that I knew were Dynamite Rave and Afronova, because I used to play on... Oh, don't even... I knew that was coming.
2893969	2899513	And Dynamite Rave and Afronova from USA, the home version.
2900450	2908751	And so, you know, like, they had Trip Machine, and that's an 8, and I don't think that's any harder than half the stuff, you know, that they're saying is 8s now.
2909192	2917013	Because they've got lots of songs, old songs, you know, that are not that hard, and they're marked as 8s and 7s and 9s and stuff.
2917413	2922514	But, yeah, I think they kind of went overboard on the 9s with, uh, on Fifth Mix.
2922774	2925614	Like, with Wanda, that song was not a 9.
2927395	2927975	Well, you know...
2929178	2943082	You know, I think the person that made the steps to I Feel just laid out this huge chart on the ground, and he had a handful of arrows, and he tripped and fell, and he dropped all the arrows onto the ground.
2943122	2944603	He's like, perfect!
2945043	2946463	This makes complete sense!
2946523	2949264	And they were, like, all askew, and just, yeah.
2949764	2952305	But, um, along the lines of...
2954631	2955031	Shut up!
2955871	2967536	Along the lines of bad ranking, I think maybe they're just thinking that, you know, we'll play it if they make it look like it's a harder song.
2967696	2969176	Because we want harder songs.
2969236	2970897	And then we play it and it's crap.
2971357	2973137	And then, you know, we get all pissed off.
2973237	2980300	You think it's really that, or do you think it's because maybe the people... From what I hear, I'm not too sure on the specifics of this, so I'm probably mostly talking out my ass here.
2980680	2986543	But on Max 2, a lot of the new songs, it's got a new person in charge of it and everything, right?
2986583	2989524	So maybe they decided they were going to change the way they wanted to rank some of the songs.
2989924	2991585	Because they changed other rankings, too.
2991605	2992485	What do you guys think about this?
2992525	2994366	The other songs they went back and changed.
2994686	2998468	Many people say, okay, End of the Century, should have been Akata the whole time.
2998548	2999488	Good thing they changed that.
2999829	3003030	Dropout, okay, yeah, that kind of makes sense as Akata.
3003070	3003630	Okay, that's cool.
3003650	3004351	You can make that Akata.
3004691	3007092	Burn in the Floor, what the hell were you thinking?
3007472	3010074	What's the easiest 7-footer?
3010134	3013036	I was going to say, did they turn it from a 5-footer to a kata?
3013356	3015217	Because it definitely was not hard.
3015637	3016878	Yeah, it's like Moonlight Shadow.
3016918	3018920	Well, we changed the steps by one step.
3018960	3024503	You know, we had them go from the left arrow to the far right arrow, so I think they will put that as a kata now.
3024523	3026084	You know, like something crazy like that.
3026144	3030167	It's not, but they should do that just to go with all the other stuff that they fucked up.
3030487	3034211	Yeah, but Moonlight Shadow on 5th Mix, if I remember right, on doubles, was only a 6.
3035252	3036533	And if you... It's a 7.
3037033	3039476	But it was one of the hardest ones I've ever played.
3039496	3041578	I don't even know if I ever did pass the damn song.
3041658	3042899	It's more like an 8 or a 9.
3043259	3045061	Just because of all the running back and forth you have to do.
3045482	3049826	It's easy for you tall, skinny people, but... No, um... Wait, wait.
3050386	3060409	I just, on that thing, all they did was just change one note from normally when it goes runs across left, down, right, left, down, right, it goes left, down, right, left, right, down, and that's the only thing that they changed.
3060569	3072952	They take out a note that does a, for a normal, for people who are regulars at doubles, and they realize there's certain patterns that Konami does, you know, so if you played enough songs on doubles, you just, you know the patterns, and you can pretty much do any song.
3073252	3073852	Moonlight Shadow...
3074392	3077853	It breaks the rule and takes out a note in the normal run.
3078653	3080693	And so you're really confused.
3080853	3082254	It does a really weird turn.
3082834	3086335	But once you figure that out, it is a 7-footer in my opinion.
3086415	3087735	It is a 7-footer.
3087775	3091956	But when it was brand new, that was a pretty hard 7-footer.
3091976	3093936	You didn't quite understand that change.
3094036	3094877	Most people didn't notice it.
3095497	3098037	Isn't that kind of said for a lot of katas though?
3098057	3101118	Like with Orion 7-8, once you just figure out the beat, it's pretty easy.
3102118	3109104	Yeah, but I think that's kind of the way it should be, because, well, no, not necessarily with, like, I Feel, because I Feel's got a pretty funky beat.
3110604	3123149	But, um, but, I don't know, I think Orion is, fits as a kind of, if you play it on one speed, now that maxes out, and you can do the speed multiplier, you play Orion on speed two, it's not a problem for anybody, I don't think, really.
3123969	3124209	No.
3124269	3130131	Well, you know, unless you're a beginner, which is cool, but, you know, for people who are starting to play on a catastrophic level, yes, easy.
3131832	3134996	Well, no one here, but we do have listeners out there, Brad.
3135016	3139241	People tuning into the show, all sorts of beginners and intermediates and advanced.
3140262	3141724	What few listeners we do have?
3142525	3147751	I think what they try to do... I think there's two different categories for katas.
3148452	3148992	One of them is...
3150868	3151108	and so on.
3167496	3176560	I was just going to say the same thing.
3176640	3179462	You have the stamina and the ones that are hard to read.
3179722	3180222	Exactly.
3180422	3183624	The technical and stamina songs that are catas.
3183864	3186745	So if they can't challenge you one way, they're going to try to challenge you the other way.
3186765	3190727	But then now with Max and the speed multiplier, they took away that one with the slow song.
3191087	3191788	Well, yeah.
3192468	3196950	I don't mean exactly... I mean exactly like off-beats.
3197802	3203765	You know, that's how they challenge you, is they try to make weird off-beats so that you could just try to... Well, that's iFeel, but it's definitely not a cat-out.
3204125	3204646	Yeah, I know.
3204666	3208908	I think that's what they tried to do with iFeel, but it didn't seem to work very well.
3209128	3215231	What do you guys think about Max USA is supposed to have a half-speed modifier to make the slow songs even harder?
3215611	3220514	I think that that would be really cool, but no one in their right mind would do it if they wanted to try passing a song.
3221214	3224176	And going back to something else about the Unlocked songs...
3224936	3237868	I think that to make them hard, they should be played at a certain speed, and like, Oni modes should have to be played with certain, like, things on certain songs, like, one song, you might have to do Oriden on Hidden, or something like that, and just crazy stuff.
3237888	3244154	Oh, you mean a new Oni mode type of modifier, where you have to play the song on half speed, or...
3244894	3251440	Well, you know, in the original testing for Japan, the rumor is, when they tested Max 2 in Japan, the Oni courses were set that way.
3251801	3256785	The few Oni courses they did have, I think they had like a 5-song course, a 10-song course, and a 15-song course.
3257186	3262771	And not only did the songs have different difficulties and levels and stuff like that, but they also had modifiers.
3262891	3267195	But for whatever reason, they decided to say, okay, we're just going to make everybody play us on one-speed singles.
3267575	3269938	Which I think, though, did make it more challenging, because...
3270678	3287282	When I played Max, Six Mix, I became too reliant on 1.5 speed, you know, just because it was easier to PA stuff like that, and, you know, I just kind of became reliant on it, using the solo arrows made things a lot easier and stuff like that, and now to go back and have to do everything on one speed, Oni Courses kind of added a little bit of challenge for a little while.
3287302	3288782	It was like, ah, these arrows are so close together.
3289163	3294244	For some reason, when I played Fifth Mix, I didn't have a problem, but going back and trying to play Max with normal arrows was just weird.
3298525	3298645	Oh.
3299285	3299385	Um...
3300317	3320061	And, but, I mean, you can, like, with the idea about the certain settings, you can still do it on one speed, it's just a preset, so, you know, one might be on one speed, and then you might have to play, like, let the beat hit them on three speed or something, like three speed sudden, so you get almost no time to look at the arrows, and, you know, just other stuff like that.
3322214	3332703	I was just saying, probably the reason why they took out the modifiers is because they thought that people might think it's too hard.
3332743	3340529	I mean, there's people that can play hard songs and PA them just fine, but some people can't do Hidden or Sudden.
3340649	3344572	And what are they going to put Stealth on one song?
3344953	3351077	I could see Little working and Shuffle, but I think that's part of the reason why they decided to just not do it.
3352238	3368725	Well, another thing I'd like to see in the upcoming releases of DDR Max is, I know they have this with the 2DX 7-style, I think it was in 6-style too, where they have an expert course for each day of the year, and it's different every day of the year.
3368805	3373307	I forget what they call it, but it's actually, it's a new course every day.
3374927	3378268	Oh yeah, was that started in 7th style or 6th?
3378328	3380288	I think it was started in 6th, right?
3380368	3385169	Yeah, because the home version of 6th style is going to have this, where every day you have a different non-stop course you can play.
3385189	3391171	And the home version of 2DX 6th style is going to have this, where if it's Monday, you've got this set of songs as your non-stop of the day.
3391631	3394851	And the other cool thing is all these courses will be internet ranking, I'm pretty sure.
3398272	3413378	Um, RuneNight13 in the chat room has got an interesting idea here, saying that they should make a mode where if you decide to pick a song in an Oni course, you can add modifiers for a certain amount of points, and then use those points, maybe they can be either points on your battery or unlock points or something.
3414161	3430696	Yeah, I think either, that's about the point I was about to make, make it optional to use the modifiers, and then kind of, I don't know about judging accordingly to that, but yeah, definitely if you want, if it makes it easier for you to do Sudden or Hidden or something like that, then...
3431176	3434017	Definitely, or Shuffle, then I think that'd be a good idea.
3434037	3439618	And that is an interesting concept, you know, making it go towards points or towards the battery.
3439818	3440439	It's a good idea.
3440739	3443059	Okay, I'm going to take a real quick break since this is top of the hour.
3443079	3448261	We'll take a real quick break, and when we come back, we'll talk about new features that ought to be in DDR, but they're not.
3448761	3451222	So you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3451282	3452302	We hope you're having a good time.
3452582	3456623	We do this every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
3457303	3458544	And hope you stay with us.
3458584	3459464	Here's some music for you.
3496388	3497174	and many more.
3564508	3565629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3681912	3683053	Bitch, get a new song.
3705896	3708298	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
3736257	3738579	and I imagine most of you will be coming back next week, I hope?
3738759	3738940	Yeah?
3739020	3739500	Okay, cool.
3739520	3739861	I'll be here.
3740241	3741042	Alright, so...
3742640	3744481	Anyway, we were talking about 401 to break.
3745022	3746903	New things that they could put in DDR.
3747363	3754468	It seems like everybody's got this idea, this really complex, cool point system thing that they want to see in DDR.
3754488	3755969	So I thought maybe we'd talk about some of those ideas.
3756469	3757670	But first off, the question.
3759311	3762153	Konami's now putting out a USA version of Max.
3762854	3767917	You think they're going to put in any other cool new features besides half speed, or do you think they're going to fuck it up?
3769252	3774577	I think, you know, they should put English in it so that we can read what they're saying.
3774617	3775237	That's a cool feature.
3776298	3777259	It's Max USA.
3777299	3778540	Yes, it's going to be in English.
3779561	3780482	But wait, you're Asian.
3780522	3782704	Don't you read and speak Asian?
3783665	3784866	Yes, all of them.
3786367	3786627	All of them?
3786948	3788008	All of the Asians.
3788209	3788849	All the Nises.
3789290	3789630	Oh, okay.
3789650	3791892	Because I thought you guys, you know, it's like same blood.
3791932	3793073	You know, you guys understood each other.
3794254	3795255	Are you racist, sir?
3795797	3799520	I'm being given some insider information in the chat room here.
3799621	3807307	Supposedly from a Konami of America representative himself said, DDR Max USA will have a lot of surprises.
3808548	3810730	And I'm hoping it's not surprise, it stinks.
3812172	3814414	Surprise, I feel the remix.
3814554	3815675	It's like with the same steps.
3816596	3817316	I like I feel.
3817336	3818537	It's going to be Joga singing it.
3819518	3820219	Surprise!
3820279	3821100	It's the Joga Mix!
3821300	3821640	No, no.
3821681	3828648	We do know that there are some Konami reps working very hard on our side, and we do hope that they are listening to what we're saying.
3828708	3835255	We think they definitely do have the ability to give us some very cool stuff that will make the Japanese want to import our stuff for a change.
3835335	3836135	So we'll see what happens.
3838138	3839979	Anyway, any other cool new modes?
3841118	3846943	I think that they should have, instead of all the arrows at the top, they should have them in a little circle in the middle of the screen.
3848023	3852267	And make it like a black hole where all the arrows just kind of do like a suction towards the middle.
3852367	3852747	Samba.
3853027	3853247	Okay.
3853468	3854268	Guitar-o-man.
3854929	3856190	Or poppin' music.
3856850	3862851	has this mode where the little blips or whatever they're called, it looks like clacks.
3862911	3867152	They come towards the front of the screen and right when they hit the front, you have to hit them.
3867532	3874793	Or, as we were talking about earlier in the show, the new Stepmania has the Star Wars effect where the arrows are in the back and the arrows kind of scroll towards the back.
3874833	3875373	It's pretty cool.
3875633	3876553	I wish I'd shown you guys.
3876573	3877934	We were looking at it earlier.
3877974	3880394	Yeah, and then George Lucas shows up and sues you for a million dollars.
3880774	3881714	I have an idea.
3882154	3885535	If you fail a song, this little midget should come out and kick you in the nuts.
3887237	3889361	Unless you're a girl and they'll be like, oh, girls rule.
3890896	3894237	Well, one of the things I thought they should bring back are non-stops.
3894377	3898597	They could do it like they do with Guitar Freaks, where you have three different options.
3898797	3910199	Random non-stop, you have courses, like they'll have themed courses, kind of like Oni courses, but, you know, you can't, obviously they're not as hard, and you don't have to PA them.
3910239	3917461	Maybe just what they do with the order non-stop is they actually have it where you don't gain life, you just lose life as you go along.
3917541	3919001	So, you know, you happen to
3919361	3922082	Really suck at one song, you better hope you do better on the next.
3923523	3927545	And for the non-stops, I don't really see a point unless you don't get life back.
3928246	3935669	Because what they do now for non-stops is whenever you play non-stop, the difficulty is set to level 1 for any non-stop mode.
3935689	3944774	So you can play the hardest song that you would normally fail and pass it really easily, but you'd still almost have no life left because you'd have to do 30 more after that.
3945374	3954456	Irene, the chat room is responding to your idea here, and it's being suggested by DCCS SoCalKicks that maybe the girls could get a foot, but it could vibrate.
3958097	3960937	And that would be the sound you'd be making?
3963178	3965658	They could have a finger come out from the back, you know.
3965678	3969479	Oh, I have a real suggestion.
3969899	3973240	I think... As opposed to a fake one?
3973640	3974140	Yes!
3974970	3975751	Uh, yeah, anyway.
3976191	3982217	Um, so I was thinking maybe they could randomize the arrows at the top so that they're not all in the same spot.
3983037	3989483	So that when it comes up, like, they would change the direction of the arrow, you know, and then you'd have to find out, like, you know.
3989743	3991785	So it's not, it makes it more challenging.
3991805	3992746	Does that sound stupid?
3992846	3994447	What, no, it sounds kind of neat.
3994508	3995148	What would they call it?
3995729	3997390	Fuck you up version.
3997610	3999392	Fuck sword you up or, no, I don't know.
3999672	4001614	Um, like... Roulette style.
4002392	4003893	Random Mode, I don't know.
4003913	4006835	Yeah, Roulette Style, yeah, sure, that sounds good.
4007455	4009237	I think they should bring back Paint Data.
4009837	4012899	For all those who don't remember that, it was in third mix, not popular at all.
4012919	4013299	Paint Data?
4013480	4014420	Like Mario Paint?
4014580	4016662	It's where you can design your own arrow pattern.
4016742	4017562	Yeah, I remember that.
4017702	4021425	I wrote one that said Rob Sucks, and that was awesome.
4021445	4022245	Yeah, it was funny.
4022386	4022846	Yes, it was.
4024487	4025347	What do you think about that, Rob?
4025908	4026388	It wasn't funny.
4027089	4027549	I thought it was.
4027689	4028650	I thought it was rather amusing.
4028670	4029070	I don't like it.
4029983	4032929	You'd make them look like penis heads, you know, one to the left, one to the right.
4033470	4034552	That's so mature of you.
4034572	4037197	Ew, penises.
4037758	4038860	Okay, anyway, so...
4042281	4047063	Any other mode suggestions, things that ought to be in DDR that aren't, type things?
4047763	4061868	You think they're going to do, when Max 2 comes out in Japan, or Max in the USA, I'm talking about the home versions, or Max in the USA, the home version, you think they're going to do an unlocked system similar to the way they were unlocked in the Max 2 Arcade?
4062908	4064210	Obviously not as many points.
4064430	4071357	No, they're going to be lazy, and they're just going to basically take the DDR Max interface that it is right now.
4071677	4076001	Obviously, since all the other home versions have been, after you play so many songs, one appears.
4076061	4078123	But nothing like Max 2 or anything like that.
4079164	4080065	Do you know this for a fact?
4080606	4082107	Yes, I am all-knowing.
4082567	4082988	Oh, jeez.
4083048	4083568	Okay, anyway.
4084830	4085090	Okay.
4085646	4090651	And for the unlocks, I don't really think that they're going to put in 750 points or whatever.
4091371	4092953	Because there's really no point.
4093013	4095555	They get you to buy the game, you're going to unlock the songs anyway.
4095935	4097557	Why even make them longer?
4097597	4099038	Like I said, they just make the points lower.
4101275	4101815	I wonder, though.
4101855	4103556	I don't know.
4103896	4105537	Maybe they'll get rid of the point system altogether.
4105557	4105937	Who knows?
4107017	4111419	How about, since the PlayStation 2 has a clock inside it, how about time releases?
4111659	4114300	And how about we change this with the internal clock ourselves?
4114340	4116280	Suggested by DarkTetsuya in the chatroom.
4116300	4117521	How about time releases?
4118763	4119003	Sure.
4119583	4144616	What I was going to say was they should make all the unlocks new songs because unless they put enough songs to keep us busy because I noticed on Max2 that everyone was playing all the new songs and stuff but all the new songs became old after a while and then you're playing all old songs and some of the unlocks that you're unlocking after 750 points are older songs.
4144656	4146797	I think maybe they should reserve that for new songs.
4147037	4150279	What would you guys think if they brought back link mode?
4151459	4151779	What's that?
4151940	4158663	The DDR link mode where it was linked up with the 2DX substream where one person would be playing the 2DX machine.
4158703	4160004	That's where the Club Appends come from.
4160024	4166407	For those who don't know, if you've ever played Club Append on the Dreamcast or this 1 and 2 Club Append for Second Mix on PlayStation,
4166827	4170088	Those songs were the substream link songs.
4170668	4175929	And where things like Earthlight and Pat Center and stuff like that originally came from, which are now economics.
4176290	4177310	Mflow owns you.
4178310	4186652	I think that would be great because while Brad's playing DDR, I could play 2DX and just pound on all the keys at the same time and really mess them up.
4187473	4192074	What about linking it with other popular session games such as Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania and all that?
4192114	4192734	Mambo Go Go.
4193234	4199316	Whatever happened to that supposed link system they were going to have with B4U's CD or something like that?
4199456	4200037	Oh, yeah.
4200497	4201377	You were telling me about that.
4201477	4209140	Yeah, well, before they were making it sound like, oh, you're going to be able to pop the CD in and have secret songs and stuff like that, but that never happened.
4209780	4215766	Ah, but what about this that they're saying now is going to happen on 2DX6 Style with this V-Rare 2 soundtrack that's coming out?
4216066	4226716	Supposedly, if you pre-order your copy of 2DX6 Style, the home version, from KonamiStyle.com, or, I'm sorry, it's not KonamiStyle.com, it's called KonamiStyle, it's a Japanese site, um...
4228217	4233160	If you order it from there, you'll get a special CD called V-Rare 2, which is some rare songs.
4233180	4234400	They did this for DDR Max.
4234781	4242845	However, what they say is you put this soundtrack CD into your PlayStation 2 after you've loaded up 2DX6 style and it acts as an appendix.
4243325	4245446	And now you can play about five or six new songs.
4245786	4246526	That would be nice.
4248147	4252690	It'd be nice because, you know, I have a couple extra songs, but it wouldn't be nice for people who don't want to spend the extra cash.
4252730	4256613	Because, like me, I'd probably get to order it from Japan Video Games or something.
4258194	4259736	Who didn't pay us for an endorsement, by the way.
4260016	4261877	No, but I mean, let me tell you why I said that.
4261977	4265700	Because you can't order from Konami Style because they do not ship to America.
4265840	4266681	So we are fucked.
4267741	4270543	Us Americans here in America.
4271223	4283571	Now, I think it would be cool if they put a... Because one of my favorite features of third mix was the disc change, where you could go back and play second mix or first mix with the cool interface and the vivid arrows and stuff like that.
4284131	4287974	I thought when they did Konomics, they should have done some kind of link with the first USA.
4288434	4289715	Maybe they can do that with Max.
4289795	4294178	I think that would be awesome to do some kind of disc change to kind of get more life out of those old mixes.
4294418	4294598	Mm-hmm.
4294938	4295479	Yeah, I don't know.
4295519	4300303	I think that'd be cool, because they could play some of the older songs with the speed modifiers and things like that.
4300323	4301344	I think that'd be a good idea.
4301584	4302165	Yeah.
4302245	4303746	Or the solo arrows, all that stuff.
4303966	4305928	Yeah.
4306709	4309091	You guys are both holding your mic, so can you please say something?
4310392	4316418	They shouldn't put two DDR machines together and make, like, what is it, quadruples or something instead of double quadruples?
4316898	4318440	They... Oh, yeah.
4318520	4325467	Put two dancing stages together and have a full, like, four panel... Four stage whatever thing.
4326308	4326628	What is that?
4326668	4327309	Four times four?
4327469	4327909	That's eight.
4328109	4329851	Well, one thing I... Well, there you go.
4330232	4336298	One thing I do realize that they... Since, you know, obviously we have, you know, economics and stuff and they have that edit feature on it.
4336999	4347639	But what they forgot to mention is that the edits don't work with any of their arcade machines because the edits, they have like region encoding, kind of like how you can't play US games on Japanese PlayStation.
4348403	4349223	or vice versa.
4350264	4352845	It'd be nice if the edits worked this time on the actual machines.
4353705	4354305	That's what I think.
4354565	4357626	Also, you know what they should put on the Macs, USA, whatever?
4357846	4362728	They should make, if you're playing single, they should make a hologram that comes out and dances next to you.
4363068	4363948	Alright, anyway.
4366969	4375532	Speculate about the report that Konami of America will have an untitled Konami music game in support of the PlayStation 2 Network card release.
4376412	4377413	I don't know much about that.
4377433	4383958	This is all I'm being told in the chat room, is that there's supposed to be some kind of Konami music game supporting the network card.
4383978	4384658	What kind of ideas?
4384958	4386560	Okay, let's say it's a true idea.
4386600	4387360	What do you guys think it is?
4387921	4388681	Let's say it's a true idea.
4388921	4391263	The network card is what will allow you to play PS2 over the modem.
4391723	4394405	And one music game that's going to be using this is Frequency.
4394425	4397948	You'll be able to play Frequency with people on the other side of the planet or whatever.
4399109	4401270	What do you think they'd be able to do with DDR in this mode?
4404052	4407316	Um, maybe just playing Versus with somebody on the internet.
4407596	4412462	Apparently that quote comes from issue 56 of the official PlayStation magazine, May 2002.
4412882	4415084	What do you think, Matt?
4416894	4417234	I don't know.
4417254	4418015	It sounds dumb.
4418455	4419755	Oh, come on.
4420015	4420836	That's my opinion.
4421016	4422417	I mean, let's see.
4422837	4426659	I mean, online games are going to be cool, but you can't really do a music online game.
4426679	4427959	I mean, it would be kind of dumb.
4428019	4430660	They tried something similar with like a multi-tap version.
4430740	4432661	I think that MTV music generator thing.
4433342	4435303	You can get your friends together and make music.
4435523	4436043	No one cared.
4436323	4441027	Frequency seems like it would work because you're building one instrument at a time.
4441087	4443550	So maybe somebody else could be building the other instruments as you're going.
4443570	4446292	It would be interesting as instruments come and go and things like that.
4448214	4451036	Something that's being suggested in the chat room, maybe it's just internet ranking.
4451657	4459064	Maybe all it's going to do is it's just going to get online and upload your scores and you can see how you compare to the professionals and all that stuff.
4459264	4460205	That sounds feasible.
4462082	4466004	No, even better, what, um, is downloadable music?
4466184	4469325	That was just suggested, downloadable new songs if you have a hard drive.
4469665	4478708	However, from what I hear, I don't know, this is all hearsay, because the whole Final Fantasy XI, I have a friend who's very, very much into Final Fantasy XI, hard disk isn't going to be coming to the U.S.
4478728	4480209	Sony refused to make it for the U.S.
4480329	4482330	I don't know much about this, I'm just kind of going off what I heard.
4483210	4486732	Actually, one of the cool things about the hard disk is actually the interface itself.
4486832	4491795	You can put any just standard IDE hard disk in it.
4492275	4498018	Anything that you can buy at like a software store or anything like that, just that would work with a computer, you can plug it right in.
4498078	4501060	So say you want 10 gig hard drive, buy a 10 gig hard drive.
4501100	4504502	If you want a 120 gig hard drive, buy a 120 gig hard drive.
4504582	4506543	It will work with, it just plugs right in.
4506643	4508003	No, I don't know about that because...
4510265	4512806	The American ones are internal and the Japanese are external?
4513326	4514506	Yeah, but see, here's the thing.
4514947	4518908	The port that it goes in, you just slide it right in.
4518928	4521489	It has the power port right there and an interface.
4521509	4523250	I think there's an adapter problem there, isn't there?
4523330	4524451	No.
4524931	4529433	I believe it was in either PSM or the official PlayStation magazine.
4529933	4539317	One of the two had it actually on there where they showed a picture of the actual interface and that you can buy actual hard drives.
4539518	4541278	And these are just regular hard drives out there.
4542139	4546661	Problem was is they were having compatibility issues with a few different manufacturers.
4546941	4549922	But, I mean, you can buy whatever size hard drive you'd like.
4549942	4553164	Well, that would be nice because Sony's trying to charge an arm and a leg for these hard drives.
4553244	4554184	It's pretty sad.
4554765	4555325	But anyway...
4557185	4563849	Well, I think I'm going to take a quick break because it's getting hotter than hell here in the studio, and I'm going to go get a fan to cool some of us off.
4564549	4570132	And when we come back, we'll talk about more different Bomani kinds of stuff, all sorts of topic ideas.
4570172	4573034	If you have something you want us to talk about, why don't you get on in our chat room.
4573634	4577215	You're just going to join the server.
4577535	4580416	Any other side IRC server, you're just going to want to go ahead and join.
4581037	4584258	One of them, for example, is irc.eggheads.org.
4584598	4586919	And then you're just going to join Channel Orange Lounge.
4587019	4588719	And that's where our chatters are right now.
4589359	4591340	And we're going to take a quick break.
4591380	4595762	And when we come back, we'll be talking about all sorts of more Bomani stuff.
4595782	4596942	Does that sound good to you guys?
4598382	4598663	Yay!
4598723	4599763	All right, here we go.
4710313	4711496	Thanks for watching!
4752560	4754098	I've been stuck this whole time
4891480	4892001	Warning.
4892641	4899346	Orange Lounge Radio's Bombani Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.
4899967	4909895	We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.
4910925	4914488	A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.
4914768	4921973	That's right, our Bomani Music and More program, which can be heard on this live 365 channel for Orange Lounge when we're not on air.
4922453	4933581	So anytime that's not Sunday from 7 to 9pm, there's our Bomani Music and More show with 2DX, DDR, Guitar Freaks, and tracks from Dance Mania and other related music game stuff.
4934401	4935342	All sorts of good stuff.
4936183	4942008	My co-host, DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers, isn't here this week because she's out at Anime Expo.
4942028	4944991	But she has a little segment she likes to do called the FU of the Week.
4945431	4947553	So in her absence, we've been filling in for her.
4948234	4950135	So we've got a nice little FU of the Week.
4950175	4951657	And filling in this week is Brad.
4952912	4953892	Fuck you!
4954493	4958535	You have a... Fuck you, those ambulances that are driving by out front right now and distracting me.
4958835	4959275	Yeah.
4959495	4959995	You have an FU.
4960015	4962857	If you have something more important to do, like save life... Oh, okay.
4963197	4966358	No, really, um... Which one should I fuck you about?
4966398	4967679	There's a lot of things I could fuck you about.
4967999	4969560	Fuck you about them all, so... Okay.
4969600	4970220	What the fuck ever.
4970360	4971401	First, Taco Bell.
4971841	4973842	It said lemon iced tea, and it was not.
4973862	4974902	It was unsweetened iced tea.
4974922	4975583	That sucked.
4975603	4976123	Oh, I was mad.
4976795	4977455	Thank you.
4977475	4978956	Fuck you, Rob.
4979377	4979857	Um, anyway.
4996327	5005156	If you're going to be soaking wet, don't you understand the DDR stage is electronic equipment under you?
5005196	5006557	Don't play if you're soaking wet.
5006617	5006938	Come on.
5007418	5010881	You're going to electrify you or somebody else.
5010962	5013804	Or even worse, when I get on the stage, I'm going to slip and fall and hurt myself.
5013844	5014705	Then I have to go hurt you.
5015266	5015606	Fuck you.
5016347	5016547	Anyway.
5019620	5026607	and also, no, on the topic of Golf Land, Sunsplash, start teching your machines.
5026967	5035175	I know there's a tech there, I'm sure he's fixed stuff, but god damn it, fix the fucking coin slot, it's not that damn hard.
5035475	5041160	Takes two seconds to do and screw the fucking thing in so it doesn't break so fast.
5041480	5042561	Not damn hard.
5042902	5044143	It takes you two seconds.
5044835	5050696	I'm sure you know why you're sitting on your ass doing God knows what you do, or teching this stupid water park.
5050816	5053037	Oh, like we need the water park there.
5053057	5054537	Like anybody goes to the water park.
5054677	5054997	I know.
5055037	5056577	Who does that?
5056697	5057698	I mean, seriously.
5057918	5059338	And those stupid go-karts.
5059378	5060818	I mean, no one uses those either.
5061398	5064139	But, God damn it, just fix the fucking coin slot.
5064539	5066940	I can't spend money if the coin slot is broken.
5067400	5068460	And you know what makes me mad?
5068840	5072361	They'll tech something like Centipede or something.
5072661	5073821	Like some really old...
5074381	5075782	Fuck you, Centipede owns.
5076202	5076782	Fuck you.
5077222	5083345	Yeah, and they want, you know, something that nobody ever plays, you know, before they do DDR or something.
5083365	5086967	And my personal favorite is that they have people that know how to tech.
5087187	5089968	They're standing there teching or looking at the machine.
5089988	5090889	They know what's wrong with it.
5090909	5091749	They know how to fix it.
5092009	5102354	But the management's like, we can't let you touch the machine because we just, one, either don't know where the keys are, or two...
5103515	5129231	You know, you're just training and we're not sure you might fuck the machine up more Even though it's something really simple as Open the door, look at the coin slot Oh, it's a little bit tilted Push coin slot over, coin slot fix Screw in coin slot, close door, machine working You know, maybe they're too busy sitting around in the back You know, pouring themselves a little drink Because all the kids drive them nuts Rob, do you use that sound clip with every show?
5130120	5132642	Yes, because I only have about five sound clips right now.
5133283	5135625	Hey, the sound clips sponsor this show, okay?
5135765	5136225	You know what?
5136305	5145893	I wish you had that sound clip from Clerks where he was playing the Pharaoh game and they actually get him to do the Pharaohing and he's all, don't you have machines to push these blocks around?
5145933	5147754	And he's like, yes, good luck.
5149476	5150677	Maybe next week.
5151658	5153119	Any other FUs while we're at it?
5154508	5156870	And that was the wonderful many voices of Brad.
5156930	5158411	Thank you, many voices of Brad.
5158431	5159311	Wait, one more.
5159572	5160172	F you, Brad.
5160332	5162554	Fuck you, Brad, for not getting Krispy Kreme this week.
5162854	5163374	You suck.
5164315	5165256	Oh, well, you know what?
5165616	5166937	No Krispy Kreme for you.
5168658	5169799	Krispy Kreme after the show.
5170479	5170960	Oh, yeah.
5171020	5172060	Yeah, okay, I have an F you.
5172221	5172661	F you, Brad.
5173081	5174062	No, really, F you.
5174362	5174622	Later.
5175363	5179145	Hey, that, hey, come on now.
5180206	5182068	Well, I mean, that's sweet and all, but we're on the air.
5182088	5182568	Yeah.
5183897	5186898	And while they're at it, why don't they just fix some of these other machines?
5186958	5187938	I mean, Keyboard Mania.
5188058	5189878	Actually, just get rid of Keyboard Mania.
5190298	5191098	No one plays it.
5191859	5193299	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
5193759	5194759	I love Keyboard Mania.
5194979	5199920	Hey, would you rather have Keyboard Mania or Beat Mania 8th Mix?
5200940	5202561	They're never going to get Beat Mania 8th Mix.
5202661	5203761	Well, hey, hey, hey.
5208862	5209442	No, that's 8th.
5211363	5215286	No, is 7th the final, or is the final going to be the 8th mix?
5215486	5216187	8th is final.
5216387	5217247	The final, okay.
5217708	5218308	Because I don't know.
5218709	5223172	Because 5Key, I mean, I love B-Maniac and all, but 7th style is what owns.
5223192	5224273	I mean, 7Key owns.
5224293	5228616	They should put fucking, you know, actual things that say if the machine is broken.
5228896	5232839	Like on Hip Hop Mania, they don't say that it's broken.
5232859	5236142	You put a coin in a coin slot, and, well, it takes the coin.
5236162	5239104	Yeah, and this is at Grosso Golfing, for those of you who don't.
5239404	5241185	Yeah, Roseville, Golfland.
5241545	5246308	Normally, about more than half the stuff is broken because hip-hop mania never works.
5246468	5253151	Like, seriously, the best that you can ever get it is one button gets jammed constantly and the coin slot takes half your money.
5253662	5257644	Just another point, too, Beatmania, the final, 8th Mix, whatever, it's all a sham.
5257984	5260925	Because 5Key still lives on in Beatmania 3.
5260985	5264827	They haven't announced that they're killing Beatmania 3 yet, so just food for thought.
5265167	5269569	Yeah, and, I mean, like, they were supposed to end DDR with DDR Max, weren't they?
5269649	5275131	And, I mean, here comes Max 2, Max 3, you know, so much for Max, like, being Max.
5275971	5276592	Thanks for watching!
5291651	5295212	If they do something stupid internally within the company, maybe that would do it.
5295452	5296753	Who knows, but I don't work at Konami.
5296773	5313338	Let's just hope that we don't have Konami of the United States building these machines, because then we'll get a really buggy-ass version of a machine, kind of like Konomics, and bringing that out where you step on the left arrow twice and the machine explodes or something like that.
5314018	5316799	Even if DDR always dies, we always have Pump It Up.
5319540	5320440	Puke it up, you mean.
5320953	5321814	Pump It Up is tight.
5321894	5323375	I don't know what you're all complaining about.
5324295	5324636	I agree.
5325656	5326297	It's different.
5326717	5336124	At first, I hated it, but then the music was kind of infectious to me, and I really liked a lot of the music and stuff, and now I'm just like, bounce with me, bounce with me, bounce with me, bounce.
5337245	5343369	I like half the music, and I just love how I'm so used to hitting the arrows, like...
5345350	5349611	I'm not used to going diagonally in the middle arrow, and I love the shimmy on that thing.
5349711	5354172	You know, Rob, if you really like the music, why don't you just buy it and dance with it at home?
5356493	5359774	Because I'm white and I can't dance without arrows, so I don't know.
5359794	5362014	Well, who cares?
5362214	5363115	No one's going to see you.
5363235	5373457	Well, actually, you know, they do have the home version of Pump It Up, and also, why don't they just, you know, since, you know, you've got this Marvel vs. SNK and that kind of thing, we can do Pump It Up vs. DDR.
5375629	5381654	Have, like, some... Maybe one of the companies... You know, Konami should just buy that other company and have it.
5381894	5383455	Nine-panel DDR.
5384416	5386017	Oh my god, it's nine-panel DDR!
5386037	5386898	Oh my god, oh my god!
5388499	5389100	Huh.
5389801	5390461	Right.
5391522	5398347	No, I don't see how you could do the, you know, obviously pump it up versus DDR, except for mix the music, you know, into the game.
5398387	5402371	Because you can't, you know, have one side of it be the five-panel and the other side be the four-panel.
5402411	5402851	Why not?
5403151	5405153	That'd be really... Because that'd just fuck everything up.
5406044	5406404	I know.
5406484	5415808	They should just have both panels, you know, like one version is Pump It Up and then you have the panels in the corner in the middle and then one version, you know, DDR.
5416388	5417969	Both of the panels are nine panels.
5418109	5425231	And I am being corrected in the chat room as every time we bring up nine panel DDR, what about Technomotion?
5425271	5426812	That's nine panel dance game.
5427292	5429673	Okay, I don't count the game unless I've played it.
5429853	5433595	And I go to Arcade Infinity occasionally and blaze these.
5434195	5434415	It just...
5435135	5443281	We have to kind of base our knowledge of stuff off stuff we've played or at least kind of heard about, and unfortunately the information on Technomotion isn't that great.
5443381	5453628	So, yeah, okay, there is a nine-panel game that exists, but it's obviously not very big because we don't really hear about it except when the question is brought up, what if they should have a nine-panel DDR?
5456895	5466664	What about that one that they had that was like pressure sensitive on the ground and it had sort of like infrared sensors on the sides, not easy to dance or anything like this is some weird Korean thing.
5466784	5468265	Maybe this was a dream you had, Matt.
5468525	5469006	No, it wasn't.
5469386	5471268	Trust me, the dreams I have are really strange.
5471608	5472709	Okay, we don't need to go into that.
5474971	5476793	Oh boy, I don't know if that's appropriate for the show.
5477113	5477914	Oh, it's appropriate.
5477934	5477974	Oh.
5479042	5485865	I had a really strange dream last night about some alarm clock that was possessed by some sort of thing and it was like causing people to do weird things.
5485925	5486265	It was cool.
5486545	5487566	What, like play DDR?
5488126	5488626	In public?
5489026	5489947	That's pretty strange.
5492395	5493055	I want ParaPara 3rd Mix
5511341	5511701	Why?
5512402	5531215	Because, I like that turn the beat around Oh god, that one, the VCD you brought last week with the turn Alright, that was pretty cool, and if ParaThirdMix would lift up the people's skirts when you do that motion, that would be pretty cool too Dude, they should have that guy in the background, that'd be awesome Ever heard of kilts, girlfriend?
5539571	5542772	Hey, I want Oonga Boonga second mix, okay?
5544313	5546434	This is the gayest conversation we've ever had.
5546914	5547194	Anyway.
5548635	5551036	Para para, Oonga Boonga, and kilts.
5551476	5552957	You can't give us more gay hair than that.
5553437	5554438	Let's just combine them all.
5555178	5556959	And we'll just have a... Well, I mean...
5557856	5559637	Look at ParaPara, it's in purple.
5559657	5563839	You know what, I heard, sorry, I'm like pulling it away from you, give it to me.
5564359	5567801	Yeah, I heard that little kids really do that in Japan.
5567861	5571703	Like, I don't know if it's like a common thing, but they like to mess around with people.
5571883	5577306	They really like put their hands together and make like a gun kind of thing, and they just poke people in their butts.
5578257	5578557	Yeah.
5578778	5579438	It's the truth.
5580179	5581820	We heard it from the horse's mouth.
5582081	5584903	From one of my Japanese exchange student friends.
5585244	5586064	Oh, that explains it.
5586084	5588667	You know, I had that happen to me at a gay bar once, but it turned, no.
5588767	5589588	Was it Japanese?
5589608	5590368	No, I don't know.
5590588	5591469	Yeah, so, no.
5591629	5592991	Some big, like, football player guy.
5593031	5593271	Anyway.
5593571	5594372	I know, it's a cowboy.
5595273	5599056	We're getting a lot of dot, dot, dots in the chat room right now.
5599417	5600177	Blink, blink, blink.
5600578	5601979	I didn't know I was going to tune into this.
5603200	5604501	Boonga, eww!
5604761	5608344	I thought we were going to be talking about DDR stuff and 2DX and all that.
5608684	5610285	Well, you started talking about ParaPara.
5610305	5611146	Yeah, yeah, that's true.
5611166	5611867	What did you expect?
5612087	5615029	Yeah, I fucked everything up when the conversation went to ParaPara.
5615069	5617130	Well, Patapata and Anal Penetration go together.
5617811	5620133	Patapata, it's cool.
5620713	5621213	I don't know.
5621394	5623795	It's not something to obsess over, though.
5623855	5624216	I don't know.
5624576	5626998	As far as I'm concerned, if you want to do that, hey, you know...
5627458	5632262	Not that there's anything wrong with that, but as far as I'm concerned... So what's the next topic?
5632302	5632902	Next topic?
5632942	5634223	Why don't we talk about this?
5634324	5636165	Another Bomani game.
5636966	5641969	Guitar Freak's 8th mix and Drum Mania's 7th mix are currently being location tested around.
5642070	5644812	What do you guys think are some new features these games have?
5645252	5645732	And what do you think?
5646653	5646913	Anyway, go on.
5646933	5647053	And, um...
5676073	5677835	Yeah, they worry too much about what's coming up next.
5677855	5681200	Like, they're thinking about what's coming out on, like, probably Max 5 right now.
5681540	5684824	You know, Max 3 is coming out probably pretty soon.
5684864	5685805	You have to be prepared.
5686426	5686867	You know what?
5686907	5687848	You have to be prepared.
5688248	5689210	Yeah, gotta be prepared.
5689250	5692514	Why not just put it in the next one instead of, like, save it for two more?
5692834	5695035	You know what would be awesome for Drum Mania?
5695075	5696696	You know how in Guitar Freaks when you wail?
5697256	5698516	Yeah, I know.
5698536	5700417	They should have something for Drum Mania.
5700437	5706339	They should have electronic drumsticks, and every time you twirl it in your hand, you should get points or whatever for that.
5706359	5707239	Okay, two things.
5707540	5709520	One, only real drummers can twirl the sticks.
5710021	5711981	Fortunately, I have that skill.
5712261	5714582	Well, if you can't twirl it, then improvise.
5714782	5716323	Pretend like you're twirling it or something.
5716343	5717703	Wave it around in the air.
5717723	5718844	It's not a magic wand.
5719815	5725279	Here, talking about 8th and 7th, which are currently being location tested, here's some new songs that are going to be in it.
5725720	5731344	Breakdown, which a lot of people, when they heard the song on Max 2, said, this should be in Guitar Freak, so now it is.
5731724	5733525	And we got a song called Russian Roulette.
5733565	5737488	I wonder if it's anything like that game show, where if you fuck up, you fall through the floor.
5738169	5739410	That would be so cool.
5739430	5740170	That would be the best song ever.
5740190	5742853	Like, now you get to play Russian Roulette with four drop zones.
5743033	5744174	Click, click, click, click, click, click.
5744514	5744814	Well, I do...
5747153	5749835	You got a good, you suck, drop you to the hole
5768025	5768966	What do you guys think?
5768986	5772530	Because you guys have had a chance now to play Guitar Freak 7th and Drum Mania 6th.
5772570	5773631	What do you guys think about the series?
5773832	5779157	Well, I love Drum Mania and Guitar Freak's Drum Mania more because I actually drum.
5779898	5786825	And I've been in love with that since the first time I ever played it in like 4th Mix a long time ago.
5788007	5794032	and basically they've got lots of modifiers and it's way ahead of DDR in terms of stuff that it can do.
5794572	5798395	But DDR is kind of catching up now with Max 2 and all this other stuff.
5799076	5800677	Oh, big old tiggle bitties?
5800797	5803360	I love Drum Mania.
5803860	5809385	I'm being told by Virtu who's in the chat room saying that Kakumei is rumored to be in it.
5810446	5811246	Kakumei?
5811406	5812107	I don't know.
5812187	5812627	In Drum Mania?
5813550	5814290	What in the world?
5814730	5817532	You know, I forgot what I was going to say, so never mind.
5817712	5825855	They need to put half the songs that were in Keyboard Mania on there, like the Dracula medley and all the other ones that I can't remember right now.
5826075	5828636	But Henry Henry actually has a really, really good drum part.
5828916	5831097	You know, I have a question.
5831177	5838300	Why did they make the difficulties of the songs different from previous mixes?
5839040	5839540	Thanks for watching!
5853755	5856718	No, what they did was, beyond the Nightmare, they only had two settings.
5856738	5858119	They had Basic and Extreme.
5858139	5859961	I'm not sure if, uh, Fifth Mix, Drum Mania.
5860521	5864926	But it was, I think, an 83 or 81 on Extreme.
5865386	5867168	And I forget, like, a 40 on Basic.
5867368	5871432	And then they moved the Extreme down to Advanced and made a new set of Extreme steps.
5872973	5873974	Notes, not steps.
5874335	5875335	Yeah, that would be fun.
5875456	5876336	Smash the drums.
5877137	5884340	I am being told, Virtue sent me a PM and saying that Japo sites are claiming that Kakumei is in Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
5884380	5885260	So take that as it is.
5886301	5887401	It would be interesting.
5887441	5889662	I could see maybe Kakumei being in Drum Mania.
5889682	5890502	I don't know about Guitar Freaks.
5890522	5891703	It doesn't seem to have a guitar part.
5891723	5892583	But you never know.
5892623	5892943	You never know.
5894004	5896905	Some other things that are going to be in there.
5897785	5904927	Power, Another World, Homegirl, Chocolate Philosophy, Kakacha, and Kaiko, my love.
5905608	5910689	And they're saying that they've also changed a lot of the ratings.
5910809	5915991	That one song in particular, Newspaper, used to be a 92 on Extreme, and now it's a 55.
5917012	5919092	So it's like they're taking the scale and making it a lot lower.
5919132	5927035	One thing I noticed about the difficulty, because I always play basic stuff anyways, because I totally suck at Guitar Freaks, the songs get harder as you play through them.
5927435	5937179	Like, for instance, if I were to, say, play, um, I believe, like, Eraser Motor or whatever on my third song or whatever, or whatever, Erase, no, it's, yeah, whatever.
5937599	5941900	Anyways, so if I were to play it on my third song, it'd be like a 40, 43 or something like that.
5941980	5943881	If I play it on my first song, it's like a 20-something.
5944001	5946422	It's, it grades harder as you play through the song.
5946602	5947143	Thank you for watching.
5947183	5947824	See you next time.
5962804	5967707	It seems like they didn't want to go above the number 100 because I think the highest on the earlier versions was 99.
5968068	5976173	So they had to, you know, to make the songs harder and not... You know, like, they don't go over a 10-footer on Max now.
5976413	5979655	So they kind of had to, like, they need to dumb down some of the other ones.
5980695	5981616	Do you see what I'm saying?
5981836	5982116	Yeah.
5982677	5989641	But about what happened with the it gets harder as you go along, that's been like that on all...
5990647	5993150	The Drum Manias and Guitar Freaks and stuff like that.
5993611	5996914	Like on the first song, I could probably pass one of the hardest songs.
5997034	6000078	Well, not one of the hardest, but I could pass a really hard song like Say What You Mean.
6000939	6004082	But if I tried it as my second song, I'd fail like a third of the way through.
6004503	6009649	Just because they want you to pass the first song just so you play more and get better.
6011950	6024759	I'm also being told that Drummania 7th is going to have a total new layout that's going to have genres and artist names, so hopefully we'll be getting some screenshots when they do the location testing in the future, and we'll definitely be talking about that on a future...
6025639	6026140	Thanks for watching!
6043716	6064990	but I'm being told it's going to be remixed for Guitar Freaks which makes sense because if you listen to other stuff that was in both My Sweet Darling was kind of a different mix when you heard it in Guitar Freaks, Drug Mania and Long Train Runnin' I think was a completely different artist so we'll probably expect the same thing from Breakdown so here you go we're going to listen to a couple songs and we're going to come back and wrap it up here on Orange Lounge Radio
6126218	6127620	Thank you for watching!
6451818	6455959	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
6456379	6456519	No!
6456539	6462081	Do we care what people think of us?
6462681	6464562	No!
6464582	6466002	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
6466462	6467443	Yes!
6470559	6472361	Extreme Bomani Radio.
6472621	6475423	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
6475804	6483830	That's us, and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, our live broadcast for July the 7th, 2002.
6484491	6494739	The songs you just heard in that little set were Breakdown by B4U, and then from Dance Maniac 7, that was Serena Paris with Do You Love Somebody, and some people in chat were asking what that one was.
6494799	6498602	Again, for those that don't listen to the Bomani Music and More program, why not?
6498642	6499083	You should be.
6499963	6504466	Always playing 24-7 on this live 365 station when our talk show isn't going.
6505126	6509408	And that's Dance Maniacs songs, because we sometimes throw in some of the Dance Maniac tracks.
6510709	6517793	Also, after that, from 2DX, Love Me Do, because Virtue was complaining we weren't talking enough about 2DX, so I thought I'd play a song for him.
6518093	6520154	For all I know, he hates that song, but whatever.
6521915	6523876	When did Madonna join the staff?
6524497	6525017	Last week.
6525057	6525497	You didn't hear?
6526378	6527178	You didn't get that memo?
6527378	6528599	Damn, we are so famous.
6529790	6530371	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6549667	6550788	www.DarkSakura.com
6563109	6563389	Anybody?
6564290	6565912	Nobody has a story.
6566032	6567032	Irene's got one?
6567093	6567353	Tell me.
6567393	6568594	You said during the break you had one, damn it.
6569134	6586990	It's not anything super special or exciting, but we went to Crestview Lanes, and he was playing on the DDR machine, which is right by the entrance, and this drunk guy, he had a bowling ball with him, and he came up and put it on the ground, and he was watching Brad play, and then he goes really loud.
6587310	6588351	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
6611548	6612448	Woooo!
6612528	6613529	Rock and roll!
6613949	6620130	Oh, once this really long time ago when I was memorizing Bakwa for I don't know why.
6621611	6626072	And I did a hand plant on one part, and this drunk guy was watching me.
6626312	6627552	He was like, oh, I can do that.
6627612	6633533	And so he like, he ran up the machine and tried to do a hand plant, but he ended up like falling right on his ass.
6633934	6635934	And it was like during my song, too.
6636334	6638735	And so it's like, okay, get off the floor.
6638755	6639015	Ha ha!
6640075	6644298	And the same drunk guy, he comes up to Brad and shakes his hand and says, What's your name, man?
6644678	6646820	And Brad's all, Brad, and he's all, Yeah, I'm Joe.
6647741	6649081	Joe Mama!
6649262	6652444	Like, that's never been the joke ever.
6652804	6654985	And then I'm all, Okay, bye, Mr. Mama.
6655166	6659909	Which is kind of ironic, because we had a guy under the nickname Joe Mama in the chat room earlier.
6660289	6662911	Same guy, you be the judge.
6663812	6664592	Coincidence?
6664972	6665733	I think not.
6666987	6669949	Yeah, so that was kind of silly, but nothing entertaining.
6670189	6677114	What about those... Was anybody there a couple nights ago when... Weren't you there, Brad, when the drunk people were there and they were asking you how to play?
6677494	6679536	Oh, yes, this was Friday night?
6679716	6680777	Yes, this was Friday night.
6681677	6684079	Oh, it's so funny watching drunk people come and try to play DDR.
6684119	6685340	I want to see them just vomit.
6685460	6687961	Can you help me learn how to play this game?
6688402	6688582	And then...
6689494	6690655	Thank you for watching!
6712610	6714932	Oh, it's way too easy for me.
6715692	6717253	I get so bored I fall asleep.
6717494	6720836	I fall asleep during those ones and I keep playing and I still full combo it.
6721396	6724018	I think it would make an interesting freestyle competition, honestly.
6724378	6733244	I was thinking if we somehow do another tourney here in Sacramento or Orange Lounge to broadcast from, we should do the shuffle tournament with just the one-footer basic songs.
6734305	6735306	That would be something.
6735526	6737127	Yes, I would love to see you do that, Rob.
6737147	6738768	Show me your white skills.
6738808	6739448	Yeah!
6740829	6742110	Thank you for watching!
6755698	6756919	I have a funny drunk story.
6756979	6757780	Well, it's not really funny.
6757820	6760142	It's just more like self-deprecating, but you guys seem to enjoy that.
6760542	6765767	I was in Vegas once, and of all places, I went to the Hilton at the Star Trek experience.
6766628	6769310	And I had this thing called the Warp Core Breach.
6769510	6769870	Nerd.
6770171	6772713	Which is seven different kinds of Sobey.
6772933	6775535	Oh, that'll fuck you up, that Sobey.
6775675	6776776	Whoa, bad.
6776937	6778158	Seven different kinds of Bacardi.
6778938	6784300	and Sobe and Razzmatazz all mixed in a giant fishbowl with some dry ice.
6785341	6786601	And pissed.
6786801	6789683	I drank probably three quarters of the fishbowl.
6789743	6791423	My friend who I was with drank the other quarter.
6791963	6796966	And I promptly went over to the Circus Circus where we were staying and I got on the USA machine.
6796986	6800107	And this is about the time I was probably playing about an eight foot level, seven, eight foot level.
6800447	6803228	I played Afranova Trick being drunk.
6803348	6807810	And it was just so odd because every time you jump playing that, you just feel like I'm
6807950	6808591	I'm flying!
6809051	6809852	I'm flying!
6809872	6810973	I'm flying!
6811394	6812675	Da-da-da-da-hey!
6812695	6819823	It's the same when you're, like, really tired or, like, you're on drugs or something, like, prescription drugs, I mean, like Vicodin or something.
6820083	6820804	When did you start doing drugs?
6821205	6822005	No, like Vicodin or something.
6822025	6823307	When she started playing Solo 2000.
6823968	6825209	Oh, yes, yes, of course.
6825229	6827051	That nurse made me do it, yeah.
6827151	6828693	But, um, no, like when I...
6829153	6837194	was at the tournament, the scat, and I was on Vicodin because of my tooth being cold and I was playing, and I'm like, this is so weird, it just flows.
6838215	6840035	Yeah, you know, it's weird.
6840475	6842175	I drink beer and I pass out.
6843216	6849317	So yeah, I played Aphrodite Trick and I actually got cheers and a lot of people watching me like, oh dude, look at the guy with the big eyes playing DDR.
6849597	6850057	Big eyes.
6850157	6852277	And then I went probably back to my room and threw up.
6853697	6856898	Oh, maybe we should go a little more detail about the throwing up process, Rob.
6857518	6859600	Which is not the only time the DDRs made me thrown up.
6859680	6861081	But that's for another show.
6861182	6863604	So I'm going to go ahead and end this show.
6865545	6867067	Thanks to everybody for being here tonight.
6867127	6868468	Irene for filling in as co-host.
6868508	6870790	But really, kind of everybody was a co-host tonight.
6870810	6872532	So a big hi to everybody.
6872552	6873092	Thank you, Dave.
6873693	6874514	Any final thoughts, Dave?
6875775	6881661	My final thoughts is that all the songs that people bash on are not that bad.
6882081	6883082	Like Pump It Up and Solo 2000.
6883303	6886766	Okay, that's too... Yeah.
6887006	6887667	Thank you, Rob.
6887687	6889149	That's exactly what I was thinking.
6890090	6891431	That's exactly what I'm talking about.
6891491	6893293	Well, Let Them Move, that's a different story.
6893333	6894074	That's just crap.
6894714	6897697	That's something we're going to be doing in a couple weeks, maybe next week.
6897717	6903221	We'll be doing a version of Listless that I used to do on my old college radio show.
6903301	6906483	We will determine the worst DDR song in history.
6906523	6908845	We'll do that on a future show, so you'll have to show up for that show.
6909526	6913749	Any final thoughts from you, Matt, Loki, our edit master?
6913809	6915690	Be kind to each other, and God bless.
6917271	6918531	Aw, that was so sweet!
6918731	6921832	Let's sacrifice this young one now, please.
6922312	6923392	Is that your final thought, Brad?
6923733	6924713	Oh, okay, it's your experience.
6926093	6926653	Final thought?
6927673	6929174	Um, yeah, let's sacrifice him.
6929614	6929974	Now!
6930794	6931474	Kill the pig!
6931694	6934655	And lastly, from the lovely Rice Princess, any final thoughts from you, Irene?
6936275	6939476	Uh, yeah, yeah, um, Vamani is pretty cool, and I love Brad.
6939676	6939836	Okay.
6941473	6945178	Oh, that was so sweet.
6945218	6956271	This is Rob Roberts, and on behalf of my co-host, Jamie Sakura, DarkSakura, who's out of town, good night to everybody, and we'll see you next Sunday at 7 o'clock.

6977405	6980866	The little critters of nature, they don't know that they're ugly.
6981807	6982787	That's very funny.
6983548	6985189	A fly marrying a bumblebee?
