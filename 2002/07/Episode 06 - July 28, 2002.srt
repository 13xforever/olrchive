Whatever!

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,480
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,780

Technical incompetence. User incompetence right there.

71
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,200
We're going to break. I'll be right back.

72
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:57,200
just a step back

73
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,200
You, you, you, you, you, you

74
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:57,200
You're a iconic mystery.

75
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Never kills any demand.

76
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,200
You're a iconic mystery.

77
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Never kills any demand.

78
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,600
I don't want to lose you

79
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I want to be with you

00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I want to be with you

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,600
I want to be with you

00:07:38,600 --> 00:08:00,480
tell me do you love somebody or need somebody just look around and there's someone for you

83
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,000
It's turning you with our hopes, you've been a

84
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,360
We'll be together in love, and then we'll be fine

85
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,120
Sometimes when you feel like the world

86
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,240
It's turning without you

87
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,240
And you believe it won't make it

88
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,720
Cause you're all alone

89
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,080
There's somebody here for you

90
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,000
Do you feel it too?

91
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Tell me do you love somebody, need somebody

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Just work around and there's someone for you

93
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And start here with us

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We all feel better, we'll be together

95
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And know that everything will be fine

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Know that everything will be fine

97
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Know that everything will be fine

98
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's all of the same when the sun shines on everyone but you

99
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Just open your heart to open and the light comes your way

100
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Remember to call my dear, there's somebody here

101

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No, everything will be fine

106
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Tell me do you love, tell me do you love somebody

107
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Or need somebody Just look around and there's someone for you

108
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:19,320
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

109
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,440
favourite perverse Bomani band, E-Erotic.

110
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,120
Do it all night. Do it with me.

111
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,120
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible. Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher!

112
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,720
In the heat of the night.

113
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,320
Oh God, I think my ears are bleeding.

114
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I liked it.

115
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,120
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next!

116
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Oh, that was cool.

117
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,520
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic. Next!

118
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,520
Come with me, man. Come on, do it with me.

119
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Yes! Yes, that's it! We have a winner!

120
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,520
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

121
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Every Sunday night, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

122
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
You're repeating yourself.

123
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
You are listening. I know. I like to repeat myself.

124
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
I think a star just fell out of the sky at the time.

125
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
It landed on somebody.

126
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
If a star is falling, though, shouldn't she be making a wish on it?

127
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
Yeah, at least she don't fall on me.

128
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Quite the optimistic, aren't we?

129
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Oh, Jamie's been having a Pessimism Week. It's fun.

130
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Does that mean we need to start off with your F.U. of the Week?

131
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Hmm.

132
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,520
All right, I think we need to start off with Jamie's F.U. of the Week.

133
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Oh.

134
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Are you ready to give your F.U. of the Week?

135
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
I have a primary topic.

136
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
You have a primary topic.

137
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Well, all right, then I present to you, Jamie's F.U. of the Week.

138
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,520
My F.U. of the Week is directed toward the lovely Korean servers of Ragnarok Online.

139
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Okay, I'm sure people who read my live journal, who know me, know that I've gotten addicted to this game as of late.

140
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,520
I was happy, I was having a good week, I got goggles, which you can't get on the current beta, I traded half my armor for it.

141
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
And what do goggles do?

142
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
They just look cool.

143
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Okay.

144
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
They do, seriously, all they do is look cool.

145
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
And, um...

146
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Jamie has to be cool.

147
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
Heaven forbid, Jamie's uncool.

148
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,520
I got a one in ten thousand chance item that each creature will drop that one in every ten thousand creatures will drop one.

149
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,520
I got a card, sold it, got more goggles, sold that, got more money.

150
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Now this is Ragnarok or EverQuest?

151
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
This is Ragnarok online.

152
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Ragnarok? It sounded like EverQuest here.

153
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,520
No, this is my own crack. I do not play EverQuest.

154
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Anyway, so I'm all happy and looking forward to getting levels and the server goes down.

155
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,520
And then the server comes back up after I try to sign on to the damn game for an hour.

156
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,520
And then the character server goes down so I try to log on and hey, my character's missing, yay!

157
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:48,520
By the way, for people who do play, if you see that the characters are not showing up, if you make a new one, you will never get your old character back. Isn't that nice?

158
00:12:48,520 --> 00:13:01,520
So, I've been sitting here now for a couple days, not being able to play Ragnarok because either the character server is down, or the main server is down, or just want me to log in, or this other crap.

159
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,520
And so, I'm just ready to say screw it, except I am an addict.

160
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
Now, do you have any other FUs of the week?

161
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Duploeb, damn them.

162
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
I hate Duploeb.

163
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Any particular week?

164
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:22,520
Duploeb, you know how they make Duploeb locks for small children or people who ride the short bus?

165
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Yes.

166
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Duploeb is like that, except it's for, you know, lobotomized newborns.

167
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,520
That's how stupid you have to be to go with Duploeb.

168
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,420
And me, you know, they did such a good job the first time we had Sacre Mani up.

169
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,380
And then, they've been just utter poopy heads lately, you know?

170
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,600
Yes, I'm being filtered.

171
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,440
It's our new Orange Lounge Language Filter 2000.

172
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,320
I figured I used up all of my-

173
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
That's a bunch of bullpoopy!

174
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,760
That's ALF, but you know a movie.

175
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,040
I figured I used up, you know, all of my fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fucks last week,

176
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,320
So I'm gonna be nice today, so fuck them up their asses!

177
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
And...

178
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
I hate them.

179
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
They contain adult language.

180
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
They need to die!

181
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,760
They need to go to hell and die there.

182
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,520
So if anybody wants to give me money, do it now.

183
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
So I can buy a new shirt.

184
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,840
And we'll have a thank you next week.

185
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Yes!

186
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,400
Whoever decides to give me money, I will not do a fuck you in your direction thank you.

187
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,040
And that's it for your fuck you of the week?

188
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,400
I'll think of something else in a minute.

189
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,480
Well I have an F.U. of the week.

190
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,040
I have to play my F.U. of the week theme song.

191
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,760
Because my F.U. of the week...

192
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,720
Because when I start complaining I sound like a chicken, so I have to play this song.

193
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,440
My F.U. of the week

194
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,320
is traffic in San Francisco, especially around the 101-80 junction area.

195
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,320
What a piece of shit. I mean, people there cannot drive at all. They don't know what lane they're supposed to be in.

196
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Doesn't that feel like an F.U. like forever, not just for the week?

197
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,280
Well it pissed me off this week in particular because I was trying to come home today because

198
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,880
I moved, for those that don't know, I moved the show out of the little tiny room into

199
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,080
the big living room tonight because I knew we'd be having more guests.

200
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,160
And I had about, oh probably about 20 minutes to move the computer out here into the big

201
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
room because of traffic.

202
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,720
I'd hoped to have a couple hours.

203
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,760
That didn't quite end up happening.

204
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,480
So my FPU of the week is people who can't drive and cause me to get home late.

205
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,880
You know, I don't foresee that getting any better because people are getting dumber and

206
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,560
dumber and dumber as, you know, time goes on.

207
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,480
We're going to eventually have to evolve from a fuck you of the week to a, you know, a fuck

208
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,000
you with a rabbit horse of the week.

209
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Rabbit horse.

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yes.

211
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,640
Irene is talking about a rabbit horse.

212
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
The rabbit horse.

213
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,780
What am I doing?

214
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,240
It's the rabbit horse with big sharp pointy teeth.

215
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Arr.

216
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Okay, worst radio ever.

217
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,040
You don't make signs with your hands.

218
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
They can't see them.

219
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,660
No.

220
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,140
We don't care what they see, because they don't see it with you.

221
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,460
We're doing this show to entertain ourselves.

222
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,460
Yeah!

223
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,460
To hell with you!

224
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,420
I'm just kidding, stay connected, please, we need ratings.

225
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,260
Don't go anywhere.

226
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,980
We actually care, we just pretend otherwise.

227
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,580
You know, it's cool to not give a shit, so that's what we're doing here tonight.

228
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
Yeah.

229
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,820
Anyway, let's start to our guests, shall we?

230
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,880
Let's save this trainwreck show and talk to the new blood here tonight.

231
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,520
We have some guests, and I'm scooting over to get near the guests.

232
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,040
Everybody say hello to Melody and Mel B. Hi.

233
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,820
So what are you kids doing in town this week?

234
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,480
I don't think that can be put on the radio, sorry.

235
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,600
I mean, what brings you to Sacramento this week?

236
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,480
We just had to see all you wonderful people.

237
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Such a freaking suck-up.

238
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,720
You're trying to make me clean house.

239
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,960
Yeah, I know.

240
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,240
You only showed up so we'd all clean our houses, basically.

241
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,640
My mother sent you.

242
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,880
Damn, my evil plot has been foiled.

243
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
Dear God.

244
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,920
Anyway, um, I'm trying to think, uh, what, what else has been going on lately?

245
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,240
We could talk to Melody and Mel B. How about the CVGL?

246
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,960
You guys are the only ones that are at this big tournament at CVGL last week.

247
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,440
What'd you guys think of it?

248
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,240
Uh, from a freestyle perspective, I would probably rank this as one of the top two or

249
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,080
three freestyle competitions I've ever been to, probably, arguably in America.

250
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,520
It was definitely just, you could have taken the top 15 people out there, they probably

251
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,560
would have placed in any other run of the mill tourney last year.

252
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,600
Bar has gone sky high.

253
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,640
So you think every other tournament now is going to have to live up to this?

254
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,560
It would be unfair, but I would not be surprised.

255
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,280
Good thing about it is, you still have the vets that are coming out there, guys like

256
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,960
Trampower, Lil B, and all that, they're still doing their thing, they're living up to their

257
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,440
reputations, but you have a lot of people coming up from Scandia, from out of state,

258
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,540
There was a kid from Omaha who absolutely wrecked shop out there and they're the new blood and they're still experiencing all this great freestyle

259
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,380
Hype, they're still you know in love with the game in as long as we get those new people up in there

260
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,960
And they're busting their ass. I mean dude. It's gonna be a positive thing for freestyle in general in tourneys

261
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,260
Right on what do you think of the German melody just going to watch and yeah?

262
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,260
How many do you go to a lot of tournaments or I?

263
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,080
Get dragged to a lot of tournaments most of the time

264
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,500
Honestly, this time I did not see a single freestyle because management

265
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,460
sucked ass. They refused to move the machine outside. They created a huge fire

266
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:31,460
hazard indoors. If any of you have been to Castro Valley, it's very small. There

267
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,700
is a small inner room that has the DDR machine and they did not move the damn

268
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,980
machine outside. So it was too dang crowded and the air conditioning was not

269
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,540
working inside either. So management was just being very hard to deal with and

270
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,540
You're getting into an F.U. of the week there.

271
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Okay, well, this would be my F.U. of the millennium, probably, but hey, we had many run-ins with the manager of Castro Valley.

272
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,540
For someone who agreed to hold a tournament, he should have been a lot more accommodating.

273
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,540
I believe Mel was waving desperately, wanting to throw another comment in there.

274
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:10,540
Oh, and I guess I'd have to do a quick F.U. to an 8-ball, because he was the one that chickened out of a judges-only freestyle tournament.

275
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,220
There was gonna be some money on the line, but his excuse to attorney director who you know approached me

276
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,580
He said you want to a freestyle tournament for judges. I'm like hell yeah, and he said well

277
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,380
I won't have anything in time or according to from what I heard around the grapevine

278
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,740
Apparently he thought whatever prize. He was going to get was not worth risking his reputation over

279
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Okay, right

280
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,960
So who are some of the new new freestylers you guys think are

281
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,960
We're going to be hearing about in the next two tournaments just doing awesome jobs and people you might never have heard about that maybe you should start paying attention to.

282
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Well, I think the biggest contingent of freestyles that are blowing up are the ones from Scandia.

283
00:19:50,960 --> 00:20:01,960
That would be guys like Hypnox, he's been around, but he's got guys like Lou Stiles who's absolutely amazing. Anyone who thinks 8-Ball or Dinkot are good pop-blockers, this guy has just taken it to a higher level.

284
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:09,960
He's got Bruce Leroy, he's one of the most charismatic guys out there, and just for people

285
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,000
in general, there was that kid from Omaha I told you about, his name was Tequila, he

286
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,040
just recently joined RTF, which you may or may not know as my crew returned to freestyle.

287
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,760
He was that good that practically after his first routine, guys just wanted him, swept

288
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,520
him up, and he's made quite an impression on everybody.

289
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,960
Tell us a little more about RTF, because that's kind of a, you know, a big, pretty well-known...

290
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,040
Oh, he's going to give you the whole spiel here, give us a breakdown, because anything

291
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,320
else you want to plug here while you're on the show, go for it.

292
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,720
But tell us a little something about RTF, and how it all started, and what it stands

293
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
for and all that.

294
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
All right.

295
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,600
Well, for a quick rundown of the history, RTF started around January of 2001.

296
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,280
It was actually Turner Rochi, the tournament at Metreon.

297
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,480
It was about the time when people...

298
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,260
We got sick of DDR USA, and people at freestyle tournaments weren't really putting up a good

299
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,420
effort they were just sort of improving on stage you wouldn't put in any time

300
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,220
or thought into it and so one of my friends was like don't you remember back

301
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,820
when we actually used to bust ass on freestyle when we actually used to be

302
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,660
creative and you know give a damn and I thought about and although I wasn't one

303
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,460
of those guilty people you know he was just saying yeah we have to go back to

304
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,100
our roots and I was like yeah I'm all for it we gotta return to freestyle and

305
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,620
so the name kind of stuck no it was a lot better than like the Foot Clan or

306
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,940
you know something else that was already taken and so from there you know we just

307
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,940
I just got a few people, at first it was like Shintenshi Mi, Mike Noe, Asian Innovation, then Brand came along.

308
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,940
A few people, and then I think our first major tournament was the Arcade Infinity 2 tourney.

309
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,940
That's when we took Solo 2K.

310
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,940
No, we do not need a Solo sucks anyway, comment.

311
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,940
Yeah, besides, don't you know the new catchphrase is, this DDR sucks?

312
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,940
Yes.

313
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,940
So yeah, that's just pretty much RTF in a nutshell. We like to have a good time.

314
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,940
We're all about just good times and all that stuff. Freestyle is just, you know, one of the things we happen to like to do.

315
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:08,940
As for other plugs, well, DDR Spot, of course, is the site that I helped run along with a couple of the RTF members.

316
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,940
We're about to do kind of a new thing. We got a lot of new stuff coming on right now.

317
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,940
Interviews with Jason Eno is doing stuff about we're usually breaking news with imports and all that kind of stuff

318
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,940
were affiliated with Team Guilo and Bemoniac, so we got a good base of connections. And

319
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,420
uh, basically, keep coming to the site, we're adding a lot of new stuff daily, and who knows,

320
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,980
you just might get knocked on your ass the next time you get there.

321
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,860
Sounds pretty good. Anything you want to plug while you're here, Melody?

322
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,860
Whee!

323
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:43,780
Alright, thank you, well put! You got nothing to plug but your ego today, it's just I'm

324
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,420
here, I'm here because I rule. That's why you're here.

325
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,100
Well, everyone knew that already, though.

326
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,620
melody all these rules

327
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,460
my bad i'm sorry excuse me ma'am

328
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,400
speaking i

00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,940
i noticed that you took a interesting trip out to omaha lately you you

330
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,900
actually went out to help kinda i were you running a tournament out there what

331
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,880
was the deal with that

332
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,820
uh... yeah actually it's a funny story because

333
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,940
i had a friend at tequila actually he caught me on uh... i am or basically on

334
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,860
the three ports

335
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,900
he was saying that their first freestyle tournament that they had absolutely

336
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,300
stuck because the judge was terrible he showed me a videotape of what they did

337
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,340
and he was clearly more talented than everyone else and he ended up taking thirds

338
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,320
so I was like dang you need someone to really run an attorney well

339
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,260
and uh... he said well why don't you come out here and show them how it's done

340
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,700
and I was like

341
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,660
me compete?

342
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,840
and he's like yeah I said well if I had the money sure

343
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,720
and he had a few friends who offered me a whole bunch of ways to come out there

344
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,000
and compete I was like

345
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,260
wait a minute you gonna

346
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,380
pay my way to kick your ass?

347
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,420
I'm like something just didn't register

348
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,420
For a moment, you know, I actually had scruples and I felt bad about it.

349
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,420
So I was like, tell you what, you take that money, you let me run your tournament,

350
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,420
you know, give you the California experience, you probably won't get anywhere else.

351
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,420
And that's kind of, you know, how it ran from there, went to their arcade out there.

352
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,420
And surprisingly enough for an arcade in the Midwest,

353
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,420
you would think they won't have that much to be money or just be that good.

354
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,420
I would say it's probably the most impressive arcade I've been to, like, three levels.

355
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,420
One level is just pure retro with, like, Kung Fu Master, Karate Champ.

356
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,420
And I'm like, a place that has karate chimp, man, how can you beat that?

357
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,560
And Popeye and all that good stuff.

358
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,020
And their bimani was really well stacked.

359
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,300
In fact, that's the only place in America I know that has a linked pada-pada-to-second

360
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,300
mix.

361
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
I was blown away.

362
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,780
And it was actually just nice to get out there and just see how bimani's just really blown

363
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,860
up everywhere in the smallest nook and cranny of America.

364
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,660
I kind of noticed this might be starting to be a trend here, because I know I was reading

365
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,720
another story, another freestyle that went out to I think New York or something to help

366
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,860
run a tournament lately. I don't know if that was 8-Ball or something. Was it? Baltimore.

367
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:49,280
8-Ball did go out to a tournament in, I believe it was Baltimore, Maryland, but he was actually

368
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,680
judging it from what I understand. Do you think this is an interesting trend that seems

369
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,060
to be developing where people from the West Coast are kind of running all over the nation

370
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:05,060
to be competing and judging and running tournaments? It's a plague. It's a plague. Actually, I

371
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,200
think it's just really a matter of promoting money in general because they know Californians,

372
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:17,200
We've been out here since the beginning and a lot of us are well known throughout the community and they think drawing in the name won't draw those hardcore fans come out there.

373
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,200
I said people like that girl from New York, Jen, she came out here twice and twice she's placed.

374
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:30,200
So it shows that people want to come out here or go out there because they love the game and they just want to get out there against the best.

375
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,500
Do you guys think it's ever feasible? I know this is kind of one of those topics that's

376
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,320
one of those like on the popular message boards comes up probably once a month or whatever.

377
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,200
Do you guys think it's feasible to one day have like a national DDR tournament?

378
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,040
Oh, anything's feasible. It's just a matter of actually putting in some manpower and a

379
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:51,360
lot of money behind it. But if they really want it, it can happen. You know, I think

380
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,540
there's enough educated people out there who can judge a freestyle or, you know, set up

381
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:01,460
some kind of almost foolproof rules for PA. It's very feasible. I think people just have

382
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,980
to have the money more than anything.

383
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,240
Where would you like to see that held? Because personally, I'd be rooting for Vegas because

384
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,060
just Vegas rules and they've got tons of stuff to do there. But of course, if you're under

385
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,580
21, it kind of sucks.

386
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,940
We actually had a good crowd, believe it or not, actually in Gulfport, Mississippi. They

387
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,860
have pretty large arcade facilities and some of the casinos there. And of course, you don't

388
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,320
have to be, you know, over 18 to get into the arcades there. Lots of space, too, and

389
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,520
a really good crowd. Anybody else got any questions or anything?

390
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,280
Did everybody run away to go play sixth style, or what's going on? Seems like there's a missing

391
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,880
thing. Anybody else got any questions, things to say? No? Paul's all, you guys.

392
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,760
Is this sixth style here? Paul's like, you got sixth style? Yes, it's

393
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:51,320
in the other room. Go play.

394
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,960
What else do you think would be able to hold a good tourney?

395
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,920
I think Vegas is probably the most popular choice.

396
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,840
I would say L.A. would probably be your next big choice because everyone loves California.

397
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,440
E3 is out there, obviously that's like the entertainment mecca.

398
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,320
So I would think pretty much your main metropolitan, L.A., New York, Chicago would be your top

399
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
three choices.

400
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,120
Seattle would be pretty cool too.

401
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,800
I agree and Seattle's got a lot of really good perfect attack players there too and

402
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,720
they'd be able to probably come up with a really good system, I think, for PA as well.

403
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,840
Read in some stuff that they did for a recent tournament of theirs. Sounds like it could

404
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,160
be fun. It almost sounded like a game show, the way they had it laid out, where people

405
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,400
are taking off songs and putting them back on, and all they needed to do was have a trivia

406
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
challenge.

407
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
You know what I think would be awesome?

408
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,600
No, they don't vote people out.

409
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:43,200
Is to rent a small stadium, like a baseball-type stadium, and get up a big monitor.

410
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
You think they could seriously fill one of those?

411
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,220
Well I'm not saying like a large one, well you know honestly if we had a tourney that

412
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,180
was a national event that would probably be the prime way to do it, would be to have the

413
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,220
machines out there and have a large monitor.

414
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,860
Actually from some of the footage I've seen like in Japan back in 98 or 99 some of their

415
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,120
major tournaments were actually held inside like amphitheaters, inside like concert halls

416
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,000
that kind of thing, there was like an actual stage, there were like spotlights everywhere

417
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
like it was a big production, I have a few videos of that and it looks like a really

418
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
happening thing.

419
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,740
It's certainly been being sucked away in a corner of an arcade.

420
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,620
What if a place like Great America, Paramounts, I'm thinking Paramounts Great America because

421
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,280
when I see that there's some videos that go around the net that happen to be pumping up,

422
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,520
but when I see those videos I'm kind of reminded it looks like an atmosphere where it's kind

423
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,900
of like Great America's little amphitheater which is a fairly good size but it's not huge.

424
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,340
Well part of that is also the organization of the tournament, so from what I learned

425
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,980
from a friend who's in Korea, Pump It Up is actually like, not just an arcade phenomenon,

426
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,860
it's actually things where like YMCAs would actually have Pump It Up teams and like my

427
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,420
friend, he actually had a Pump It Up teacher that he went to, taught him all this stuff

428
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,520
so like they had these factions from different parts of town, they go to these huge events

429
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,220
and that's, and really, a lot of it's not even a contest, it's just an exhibition of

430
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:08,060
people showing off what they can do on different songs, that's part of what DDR is gonna need,

431
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:13,660
It's going to need backing from other companies or little factions that have the means to

432
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,940
get publicity, to get money, and so forth to have these huge events out of Great America,

433
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,940
you know, the amphitheater or wherever.

434
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,700
What would you think of an exhibition style tournament?

435
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,020
I mean, just to have an invitational exhibition style tourney?

436
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,860
Oh, I think it would be great.

437
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,740
I mean, it's gotten to the point where prizes are great and all, but really what it boils

438
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,180
down to is you could really weed out the people who really love the freestyle and just love

439
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
the crowds.

440
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,280
It would be just cool to have an exhibition go out there and just do this, say, you know,

441
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,780
we're doing it for fun, we're doing it for prizes, we just, you know, want to entertain.

442
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,240
And I was also thinking, you know, what about like a, you know how they have the People's

443
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,460
Choice Awards?

444
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,860
What about a People's Choice style tournament?

445
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,860
Have crowd voting?

446
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:00,860
Um, I know 8-Ball wouldn't win.

447
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,860
That was wrong.

448
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,860
The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio?

449
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:10,860
Well, you know, I mean, I'm all about the dirt and all that kind of stuff.

450
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,860
If you don't hear it from me, you're going to hear it from someone else.

451
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,860
But I got love for him. It's like, you know, from a competitive standpoint, I want to kick everyone's ass, everyone's anatomy.

452
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,860
But afterwards, hey, we'll knock down a beer and, you know, we'll let you gloat about what you did ten years ago, but hey.

453
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:32,420
And you kind of have this gasp look of surprise on your face, Molly, anything you want to

454
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,420
add?

455
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,340
That wasn't surprise, that was agreement, Zach.

456
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:44,220
We won't bring up the event from last night.

457
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,060
Inside jokes here tonight.

458
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,060
Oh yes.

459
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,060
Did you have something you wanted to say, Matt?

460
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,940
I thought I saw your hand like halfway up in the air.

461
00:30:50,940 --> 00:31:04,940
I was just going to say, I was reading on the DDR East Coast Invasion boards that J. Dog went to help determine Florida at some point, but I believe it was someone from the DDR Creek boards that I recognized that went to Florida to help determine.

462
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:12,940
I didn't hear about a Florida tournament, you know what I mean, I don't keep tight taps on everyone, but I wouldn't be surprised, J. Dog's a pretty big man in demand, you know.

463
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,940
It was Florida or Atlanta, I can't remember.

464
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Well, if it comes to Atlanta, usually it's Inouan.

465
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,940
He used to do a lot of stuff. He ran a tournament in Atlanta about a year or two ago when he was actually living there.

466
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:30,940
Yeah, all I know is they just love him over in the East Coast. I was trying to get him to listen to the show and plug in.

467
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,940
I guess that's a good question. How do you feel about fanboys and fangirls?

468
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,400
I mean, because DDR, it's like, you know, you're bound to get some fans to download

469
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,080
your videos online, you're fairly well-known freestyler and stuff, and people kind of like

470
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,520
start to get to know you, or you know, want to know more about you and what have you.

471
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,560
Do you think that's kind of weird for being a fan over DDR, or how do you feel about the

472
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,320
whole phenomenon?

473
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,600
I think everyone's a fanboy or fangirl of someone that they love.

474
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,560
I mean, you know, jeez, if I were to meet, like, weird-out like up close five feet away

475
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:10,560
for me. I'd be all, you know, like, oh my gosh, my title, you go put your best self.

476
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,580
You know, but it's, you know, to each their own, I think it's just, you know, a sign of

477
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,300
appreciation, you know, if they appreciate my dance, hey, I'm all for it. It's like,

478
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,140
who would have thunk that just getting up and doing something I do just for fun. People

479
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,220
would download me, they'd try to compromise style, they'd want to find out words and stuff.

480
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,220
It's, you know, they say flattery is honesty and all that is the truest form of whatever.

481
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,620
Imitation is the finest form of flattery, right?

482
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,900
Yes? That's what you're here for. You're there to correct me.

483
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,300
Did I ever tell you about what happened when I was in Mississippi?

484
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,860
Go ahead. I showed up late for the tourney because I was gonna

485
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,100
be in it and the question I got was

486
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,580
when I told people who I was, they were like, oh my god, you're Darth

487
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,420
Socko? Wait, do you know Mel B?

488
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,780
That is truly what I got. And the other question is, do you still have the bat?

489
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,060
Oh, the bathroom miggle too, wow.

490
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,860
But yeah, just a quick on the fanboy's background, I guess it's...

491
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,940
The only time it really tripped, I guess, it really hit me was

492
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:13,220
I was in Canada of all places. I was in Vancouver visiting a friend, and then some guy actually

493
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,940
recognized me from my Santa Monica video. I was like,

494
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:22,140
whoa, out there? Yeah, I gotta admit, it's kinda weird, but at the same time, hey, you know,

495
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,860
I got nothing but love for everyone who's got love back. For me, it's all about the game, but

496
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,860
They like me, hey, it's all good.

497
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,860
They like you, they really like you.

498
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,860
I guess they're not asking me for my pin number for my ATM card, hey, it's all too good.

499
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:42,860
I guess my next question would be for Melody, because it's no secret, I guess she doesn't mind me saying, Melody, Mel B, an item here, right?

500
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,860
Yes, it's okay to say on the show, yeah, duh, okay, just making sure.

501
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:50,860
If you kill all the jokes about Mel and Mel, oh my god, they're the same. I've heard them millions of times.

502
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,860
Some people don't like that stuff coming out on air, but no secret.

503
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,860
So how do you feel about the Mel B. fanboys and fangirls?

504
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,860
It can be rather on the interesting side.

505
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,860
Mel just sits there saying, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

506
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,860
We want to hear the funny, embarrassing stories because that's what radio is for.

507
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,860
Funny, embarrassing stories. No, that's us.

508
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,860
No fanboys or fangirls.

509
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,860
It's kind of something you just have to learn to deal with.

510
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,820
It can be hard, but it's something

511
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,980
I'm starting to come to terms with that he's

512
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,180
going to be out there.

513
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,740
And that it really is a form of flattery.

514
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,340
People really like him, but as long

515
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,900
as they keep their hands off of him, I'm happy.

516
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,540
Because he's mine.

517
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,060
Know what?

518
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,940
She loves the fanboys, hates the fangirls.

519
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,260
Exactly.

520
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,940
Well, yeah, just a quick, funny fanboy story, though,

521
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,540
was I remember Drags One.

522
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,740
That was when I did my After the Game of Love routine.

523
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,000
I was like kind of pimped out in the zebra hat and like the

524
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,980
Feather bow and all that and at one part like my feather boy sort of came apart and like there was a feather that flew around

525
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,900
There was this one team at the time. They were team epsilon. I think and one guy said oh my god

526
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,000
You know this is cool. Can I keep it? I'm like well, okay sure

527
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,300
I see him at a tournament about eight months later. He pulls the AI3 he comes up to me and says hey man I'm ready for drag

528
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,300
I'm like oh, yeah, he busts out his wallet pulls out that feather from the boy. He says he keeps it for good luck

529
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:23,300
I was like, whoa. That's why I came to realize, you know, it's something I got to deal with, you know, and I'm actually all happy about it, hey.

530
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,300
Celebrity.

531
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Hey, you know, I mean, some people like the spotlight, some people hate it. I can embrace it, no problem.

532
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,300
Do you think it's odd at all that DDR is something that kind of creates celebrities?

533
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Um, I've seen Stranger Things create celebrities.

534
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,300
True, true.

535
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:45,300
I guess if you can be a celebrity through Star Trek or, no just kidding, you're a survivor.

536
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,300
So who are you going to take the sponsorship from, Pepsi or Coke?

537
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,300
I would have to go with Pepsi.

538
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,300
Alright. So Pepsi, give them a contract.

539
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:06,300
I'll ask another real quick question. What do you think was the most, because you go to a lot of tournaments all around California and now even some outside of California too.

540
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,300
I got the UK tournament going in October.

541
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,300
You're definitely going to that, huh?

542
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,300
King of Styles III, yes.

543
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,300
Right on.

544
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,300
What do you think to date has been the most, I guess I wouldn't say the best or worst tournament,

545
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,300
because that's too hard to kind of judge, but maybe the most fun tournament that you went to?

546
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,300
Most fun tournament? Ooh, I would have to say...

547
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Probably... I'm going back.

548
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,300
I think probably the most fun tournament was the first ever Metreon tournament.

549
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,980
It was yeah about August to 2000. That's when like NorCal's that was really their first major get-together

550
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:48,140
That's when Medtron was holding it Pepsi was sponsoring KOA was doing their thing and that's you know when I was in freestyle

551
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,180
There were like two tiebreakers I had to go there were two tiebreakers in freestyle like one I had to go against

552
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,820
Mike No for first place, you know, we both like went at it. We had to go through like improv

553
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,560
We had to go through routine. They had to pull almost every

554
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:07,200
tiebreaker in the book, but it was just a lot of fun afterwards, because everyone out

555
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,800
there, it was back before drama really existed and all that, so it was just a sign of the

556
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,800
times when we were all still bonded together by this whole DDR thing, we were all together

557
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,960
before our personal lives sort of took over.

558
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,780
I guess this is going to be an odd question, but was DDR better then?

559
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,800
I think it's not so much it was better, it was just the fascination was still there,

560
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,580
And you know, at the time, we had 1.5 and we really, not a lot of us had third mix or

561
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:40,000
any other mix to compare and yearn for, but nowadays it's like, once DDR comes out, we

562
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,720
like it for a few days and then we're like, well damn, we want something more.

563
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,880
Because we realize how fun DDR can be and it's usually hard to recreate that first genuine

564
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,100
pure love you have for that feeling.

565
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
It's like, you know, crack.

566
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,700
You get the first hit, all you're trying to do is you're trying to replicate that feeling

567
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,700
of the first time.

568
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,700
It never quite happens.

569
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,700
orange lounge is not a doorstruck

570
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,460
stay on the pill, because I won't hurt you, but the next man will.

571
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,460
Those are the words were never said

572
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,260
Just tryin' to get real real

573
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,880
Make sure they laugh and just tryin' to get

574
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,360
Just I vote you gon' stay safe

575
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
Cut the drugs, cut the drugs

576
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:28,400
I'm way too out here, man!

577
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,400
I like it!

578
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Loving you

579
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Loving you

580
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,400
It was such a hard line

581
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Loving you

582
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,400
It was such a hard line

583
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:49,580
I apologize for cutting off the last song there, we were trying to listen to the Outer

584
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:55,760
Limits and I made a technical boo-boo and it got cut off, sorry, so I'll give you another

585
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,420
LED track from Nudisix Style and maybe we'll get back to Outer Limits a little later, so

586
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:07,420
I have my apologies.

587
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:40,420
Kill that machine

588
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,420
1.

589
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,420
B.

590
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,420
2.

591
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,420
3.

592
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,420
4.

593
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,420
5.

594
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,420
6.

595
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,420
7.

596
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,420
8.

597
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,420
9.

598
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,420
10.

599
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,420
11.

600
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,420
12.

601
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,420
13.

602
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,420
16.

603
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,420
17.

604
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,420
18.

605
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,420
19.

606
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,420
20.

607
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,420
21.

608
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,420
22.

609
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,420
23.

610
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,420
24.

611
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,420
25.

612
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,420
26.

613
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,420
27.

614
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,420
27.

615
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,420
28.

616
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,420
29.

617
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:58,900
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio

618
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:14,580
staff meeting.

619
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,860
Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

620
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:24,740
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and in that last set we had a couple of the new

621
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,100
new tracks from the 6 style home version, which is kind of the biggest news in the Bomani

622
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,480
scene this week, is that 6 style was released in Japan, and so of course all the fans of

623
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,440
2DX are importing it here, and it's cool, we were going to talk about it last week when

624
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,620
unfortunately none of us got our copy in time, but we have them this week, I got mine, I

625
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:49,120
finally caved and bought a Japanese Playstation 2 this week just so I could have 6 style.

626
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,800
So it's out in the other room right now and there's people playing it.

627
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,800
What do you think?

628
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,800
What do you guys think of 6 style?

629
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,800
Do we like it?

630
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,800
Woohoo!

631
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,800
God, you people are dead this week!

632
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,800
Well go play it!

633
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
Go in there and play it. If you haven't played it, go in there and play it.

634
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,800
And for, you know, just call everybody who's listening, come on over to Rob's and play it in the other room.

635
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,800
Don't keep the address out, that's all I ask.

636
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,800
Well I think probably the best thing about $6 is for the simple fact that every 2DX machine out here that I know of

637
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,800
has a really stupid freaking unreadable screen and now you can go home and

638
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,800
The movies actually work. I mean, wow.

639
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,800
Who knew that the video for Wow Wow 70s was so fucking cool, huh?

640
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
That is awesome.

641
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:37,800
Don't forget about Bearcade though, because Bearcade does have probably the best quality machine now in California, except for maybe AI that I've played.

642
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:46,800
AI screen is not that great because now the blue and white keys all look green, so it's not bad but not stellar.

643
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,800
The only time I ever played that one was November last year, and I think that was right after it had been replaced.

644
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,800
I haven't been to AI in a while, but just as long.

645
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,800
SHGL's old machine was by far the weirdest one I ever had to play on.

646
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:06,800
I've never seen people just quit in the middle of a game because they got so sick of trying to read the screen.

647
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,800
I usually like to get my whole money's worth when I play 2DX, and I did walk away from the machine when I was there last November.

648
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,960
It was the only machine that I ever had such a bad case of vertigo playing, because the

649
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,480
sides of the screen were burned out in a circle, I thought I had tunnel vision the whole time.

650
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,720
Now does any 2DX machine in the U.S. have working videos, or is this the first time

651
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,660
a lot of us get to see these videos unless we downloaded them online somewhere?

652
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:34,360
For 6 style, the only time I ever saw working videos was temporarily they did work at AI,

653
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,320
but anywhere else I did not see them going.

654
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,320
Interesting.

655
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,200
Any other cool videos you want to point out that people should check out if they get to

656
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,200
play this?

657
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,200
On 6 style?

658
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,320
Well, seeing as how I've only ever played it here at Iguana Girl's house.

659
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,440
I like, I think it's one of the Eurobeat ones.

660
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,440
Linus.

661
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,440
Mel B says Linus.

662
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,480
One of the Eurobeat ones had the bunny from Keyboard Baby.

663
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,120
Pada Pada Pada.

664
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:04,320
I remember playing it and absolutely failing it on 7 key.

665
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,560
And then stopping right in the middle of playing, look over, oh my god, is that the rabbit?

666
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:15,560
Just like that. And it distracted me worse than the evil Satan fetus from 2.50 BPM.

667
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,680
G2 also has a really awesome video, too.

668
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:26,200
That video scares me. It's got, like, trans-circa aliens or something. It's weird stuff. You

669
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,040
expect to see her floating in a glass jar or something. It's pretty scary.

670
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,520
I have to say, as always, the Orange Lounge videos are the best.

671
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,720
I agree. Now, did you notice for about a half second in the Wow Wow 70s video, there's a

672
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,720
There's a shot of the two girls from the MobaMoga video with afros.

673
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,240
The only thing that really distracted me was the building with the fro, which, by the way,

674
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,080
is going to be replacing my Pocari sweat icon on my live channel.

675
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,080
Right on.

676
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,600
Now, Bradley, you're a big 2DX fan, you got any videos that people should be checking

677
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,600
out?

678
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,600
Not so far.

679
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,520
I've been playing too much to actually watch the videos yet.

680
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,520
Sounds good.

681
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,160
Yes, I'd actually just like to sit on my computer monitor and just sit in the background and

682
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,400
just watch it's the one for colors honestly because it's just so pretty and

683
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:13,800
trancy and it's colorful it makes me happy it makes me the color of blue and

684
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:19,800
and oh I was a fool to let you walk away another neat thing about six hours has

685
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,400
new movie mode or movie clip mode where you can watch the videos fullscreen it's

686
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,160
nice you put on autoplay and then just watch the video screen with no notes or

687
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,400
anything that's pretty awesome and a good idea and if anyone has it you can

688
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,400
You can set up a chorus and make it autoplay and it just goes through all the videos.

689
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,400
Just watch like 10 videos in a row if you want to.

690
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,120
videos of like the guys playing all the stuff one-handed, it's got to be the most demoralizing

691
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,600
bit of footage you can ever watch for 2DX.

692
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,680
Those videos just scream, Americans suck at 2DX.

693
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,880
For the people who don't know what Tetujin means, it means Iron Man.

694
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,160
It's named that for a reason.

695
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,720
You know, those are some absolutely fantastic players.

696
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,800
It's like, is that trying to spin off on Iron Chef, like Iron 2DX?

697
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,280
and i don't know it's like you know

698
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,340
like taken for two d x

699
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,700
you know the king of iron fingering

700
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,560
the world

701
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:46,120
never mind i said that there are that part of adult content

702
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,880
uh...

703
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,280
i was referring to this and it's a completely innocent manner

704
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,800
you pervert

705
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,560
i think we know what our last week on orange lounge clip will be

706
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,520
okay you can buy it

707
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,520
I'm gonna go sit back in my chair the rest of the night and let people deliver me donuts and vanilla coke.

708
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,520
Look at this setup we have here. Jamie's kind of sitting in her throne here, the big blue chair.

709
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,520
I'm a goddess, of course.

710
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,520
The rest of us are all sitting on the floor around her.

711
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,520
Hey, I offered the chair.

712
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,520
The chair is mine, too.

713
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,520
The chair is rightfully yours.

714
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,520
I am the Vicodin goddess.

715
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,520
The Vicodin goddess?

716
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,520
Of course.

717
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,520
And what makes you the Vicodin goddess?

718
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,520
Because I'm well medicated.

719
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,520
I have to medicate myself to do the show.

720
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,520
Are you under sedation?

721
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:32,520
Haha, haha, haha, give me that.

722
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,520
SoCalKicks is saying, let us remind you, were you moist yesterday, or last week?

723
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:43,520
Dude, you still haven't sent me my proof that you passed my edit. No GameCube pens for you.

724
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,520
Nice question, Dodge, there.

725
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:52,520
When you send me the proof that you have passed my edit with a 90% perfect attack and full combo,

726
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,240
you know, then I will be nice to you and send you your GameCube pen, maybe if you retract

727
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,240
your question.

728
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,240
Maybe.

729
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,240
We'll see.

730
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,200
We'll see if anybody else can respond to that.

731
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,760
In the meantime, let's break from six style chatter for a minute and let's let Matt, also

732
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,240
known as Loki, give us an update on what's going on in the simulation scene, because

733
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,480
there's a lot of news this week.

734
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,480
Last week he drowned his sims to the pool.

735
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:24,480
Yes, actually I do that very often, it's just very fun to kill them off.

736
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,480
Have an update, SoCalCakes has retracted the question.

737
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,480
Okay, you can have your pen semi-proof.

738
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:43,480
Okay, in the sim world, boards are still down, we still have Team Guilo down, we still have the melting pot down, and also the actual DWI official board down, but there's a bunch of mirrors out there.

739
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:58,480
Really no updates as far as programs go. There was a small update to Dance with Intensity 2.0. It's now 2.0003, which I haven't really seen any changes. The video still doesn't work in the background for me, so that kind of sucks. I'm very disappointed.

740
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:05,180
it. One major news thing is actually going to be with DDR East Coast Invasion or their

741
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:12,460
website, ddreei.com. They're having their second DDR. It's a DWI Turning Mix 2. It's

742
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:17,660
going to be running for the whole month of August. And there's actually a few different

743
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:22,660
things you can enter in. They're going to have a light, standard and heavy entries you

744
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:31,660
Light is for people that are just getting into making DWIs. Standard is, you know, basic, you know, anyone that's kind of seasoned doing DWIs.

745
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:36,660
And then Heavy is just for the elite, which I'll be entering in, because, you know.

746
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,660
No one has the ego here.

747
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:43,660
I have an ego, but yes, I will be entering in this time.

748
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:52,660
Also, they're going to be having a light doubles, which I guess they're going to be doubles edits, which I'll most definitely do also.

749
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:57,660
But that's going to be going on for the month of August, so hopefully we'll see a lot of good stuff come out of that one.

750
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,660
You doubles know.

751
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,660
I'm actually thinking about entering one of these edit contests just because I'm pretty bored.

752
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:09,660
So, I mean, hell, we got this show off the ground. What's that say about free time?

753
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,660
No life plus no talent gets you a talk show.

754
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:16,580
And I did rip that line from Space Coast Coast to Coast, thank you.

755
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:20,940
It's being said in the chat room, Pyroman is saying,

756
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,620
hey, rumor here that StepMania Beta 5

757
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,700
out very soon, possibly tomorrow.

758
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,600
Have you heard anything about that?

759
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,920
No, I haven't, but hopefully it'll work a little better this time.

760
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,480
See, the only thing that I like about StepMania is it's got a lot of

761
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,240
nifty, shiny stuff in it. You know, they have the new features as far as like

762
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,840
modifiers you can do to songs, but

763
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:45,680
The thing I really hate about it is, because I have a huge song collection, it takes forever

764
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,800
to load the damn thing up. I can sit there for about five minutes watching the thing

765
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,040
scroll by because it's reading all my songs, and it just takes forever. Whereas, like,

766
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,640
you know, back in the days with even Delight Delight Reduplication, one of the old simulators,

767
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,840
what it does is it scans, you scan your music list, and it'll build a list, and then that

768
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:09,520
That way it loads instantly every time, same with DWI, same thing.

769
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,320
And StepMania has kind of dumbed it down where it scans your music list every time, so it

770
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,320
takes forever.

771
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,880
So if they just fix that, then maybe I might go over to StepMania, but I'm sticking with

772
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,600
DWI for now.

773
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,120
Oh, I was going to ask our guests some questions, but they ran in the other room to go play

774
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,580
sick style.

775
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,300
So that's all on the simulation front then for now?

776
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,920
That's it until all the boards come back up.

777
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:36,680
Hopefully they won't have any more bandwidth issues with Team Guilo, because I love reading

778
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,280
that board for the news, and then when that goes down, so does the melting pot and DWI.

779
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,520
Paul, you've been awfully quiet all night, do you have anything you want to add?

780
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,400
I've been out of town this week, so I'd just like to tell anyone who goes through the Santa

781
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,840
Cruz Boardwalk to not go to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, because the arcading there is pretty

782
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,840
bad.

783
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,880
The only thing there for nostalgia is the BeatMania Complete Mix is kind of fun to play

784
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:06,360
They do have Percussion Freaks, but no chair, so if you want to play a Percussion Freaks

785
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:11,320
fourth mix with no chair standing up, you'll get real sore, but you'll have fun.

786
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,320
It's kind of a new thing.

787
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,320
Oh yes.

788
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,320
We have...

789
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,320
Oh?

790
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,320
Okay.

791
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,600
I just need to ask you a question about it.

792
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,960
Oh, a personal question, yes.

793
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:22,960
Just one moment here.

794
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,960
I'll let Jamie talk.

795
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:24,960
I have an announcement.

796
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,960
I have a doughnut.

797
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,640
Doughnuts are good for you.

798
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,680
They're full of chocolate vitamins.

799
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,680
Seriously.

800
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:36,760
Okay, we're going to take a quick break because everything's kind of getting distracted now

801
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,760
with sixth style.

802
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,760
It's the top of the hour anyway.

803
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,040
So we're going to take a quick break and we will come right back.

804
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,680
I have to give a few plugs before we go to break though, a few things.

805
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,400
SoCalKicks.com is now up and running.

806
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,600
So SoCalKicks, he has a cool little site there and Jamie's edits are up there, which you

807
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,760
can go download.

816
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,580

817
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,580

818
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:42,300

And also 2dxstyle.net is up and running once again and they've got a nice little button

822
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,500
for us on there.

823
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,500
That was really awesome.

824
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,940
I wasn't expecting to see that so thanks to them for supporting us and we'll support you

825
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:02,980
best we can.

826
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:03,980
So do go visit their site.

827
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:08,800
They now have, they're trying to build a location page of every 2DX machine in the nation and

828
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,600
it is, it's fairly up to date from what I'm being told so go take a look at that if you

829
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,600
get a moment.

830
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:20,600
we're gonna break and we will be right back

831
00:59:43,600 --> 01:00:12,600
Well I'm a chemist, I move the lab ready to explore

832
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,300
I drop the beat for fat rhymes like no one has before

833
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,900
I kicked enough to verse in my speech when I flunk

834
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,300
I'm not like a devil, the suction for the dope or the drugs

835
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,300
So he can teach a drive in the beds

836
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,900

I'm not gonna lie, I'm just kidding.

843
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:46,980
Well I'm a chemist, I move the lab ready to explore

844
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:49,560
I drop the fuck off at rhymes like no one has before

845
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,280
I kick the knelt at verbs in my speech when I flow

846
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,580
I'm not like a devil, that sucks you for the dough of the drugs

847
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,580
So he can teach a drive in the base

Music

915
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,480
to the Orange Lounge Radio.

916
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:16,480
We keep being prong boys.

917
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,480
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio live.

918
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,480
Yes we are.

919
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:26,480
Gosh, I'm just not being friendly with Winamp tonight are we?

920
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,480
I think I'm going to shoot this thing in the head.

921
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,480
It's helped mesmerized by our sponsor, The Swedish Chef.

922
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,480
You know what?

923
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,480
I just threw a fish at him and Rob went crazy.

924
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,480
I think Winamp's mad at me because when I logged in today it said,

925
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,840
I said, upgrade me.

926
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,880
And I said, no, I need to have a show to do.

927
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,160
Mine tells me that every day.

928
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,160
I think it's protesting.

929
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,720
I think it wants to disown me.

930
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,020
I want to say a big hello to everybody in the chat room

931
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:51,880
right now over on IRC.eggheads.org.

932
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,760
Or if you just download M-I-R-C, you're

933
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,720
just going to want to connect to any other side IRC server.

934
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,360
And we're in Channel Orange Lounge.

935
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,240
We're joined tonight by some special guests.

936
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,120
We've got a whole bunch of our regulars here.

937
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,720
And also from out of town, we've got Mel B and Melody.

938
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:10,040
So, everybody's kind of running in and out though, playing sick style as well.

939
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,040
Kind of seeing what's going on there.

940
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:15,280
I don't know, what do you want to talk about now, Jamie?

941
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,160
I'm kind of running out of things to discuss.

942
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:22,080
Well, we're thinking of having a new segment, you know, to sort of, again, focus on the

943
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,160
and more part of our radio show.

944
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,160
Yes.

945
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:29,880
The weekly anime review, which, you know, I think I'm going to review something pretty

946
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,560
old school that Mel brought up earlier today.

947
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:43,400
review of Lupin the Third, more DDR2, Castle of Cagliostro, one of the best anime ever.

948
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:47,360
I see people who are going off on, oh Hellsing is cool, which it is.

949
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,520
I saw Hellsing for the first time last night.

950
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,260
Hellsing owns, but we're reviewing old stuff.

951
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:58,240
This is also another reference to old school gamers here, who happens to remember the game

952
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:05,000
cliffhanger that sort of played like Dragon's Lair and Dragon's Lair II and that other sort

953
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,720
of weird game that featured the cowboy.

954
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:15,320
I don't remember that game offhand, but it was time something.

955
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:21,140
Anyway, the whole thing with Castle of Cagliostro is I don't know how many people have actually

956
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:23,960
watched the Lupin TV series, which was really awesome.

957
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:32,240
So basically, it features him going after a crime syndicate that's been responsible

958
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:39,320
for the counterfeiting for centuries even, funding wars and going after, but there's

959
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:44,240
also a little mystery and a little bit of romance attached to that.

960
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:48,040
It's definitely something that if you rent it once, you'll definitely want to buy it

961
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,680
and certainly for people who love old school anime.

962
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,080
And it's Miyazaki, right?

963
01:14:53,080 --> 01:15:02,220
right yes it was directed by Miyazaki and you know Miyazaki for for people

964
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:06,520
who you know don't know him by name is the man behind studio Ghibli so as in

965
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:14,940
Princess Mononoke, Laputa, Nausicaa that's another one too oh yeah and even

966
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:19,180
before that that that was monkey punch right yes monkey punch is responsible

967
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:23,300
for Lupin. Yeah, that was before he went to the studio to give the... No, no, no. Monkey

968
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:28,980
Punch is the one who did the Lupin comics, who created the character, and also of course

969
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:33,980
was responsible for the early animation. Castle Cagliostro was actually directed by Miyazaki.

970
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:39,980
Oh, okay. Woot woot. So, yes, you know, more of my useless anime trivia. Hey, it's cool.

971
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:44,200
Well, let's talk about one of my mutant powers. We were talking about a few weeks ago on the

972
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,520
show. Actually, I think it was one of the shows you were in here, though. We were talking

973
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:50,080
about DDR and anime, what's the correlation? Actually, no, I think it was your first show

974
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:54,280
back we started talking about this. What is the connection? It seems like a lot of, besides

975
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:58,520
the obvious, they're both from Japan reference, you know, what is there, why does there seem

976
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:05,640
to be this connection between anime and DDR? Well, you know, I've often thought that, and

977
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,760
you don't necessarily have to be into one to be in the other, but I've noticed that

978
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:16,480
a lot of people are into both, you know. Can you say otaku? Otaku. Thank you. And for

979
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,320
For the people who actually really don't know what that means, it's someone who actually

980
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,220
sits at home and doesn't go anywhere.

981
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,220
That is the literal reference.

982
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,220
Otaku means home.

983
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:28,380
Yes, otaku means home.

984
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:35,560
For people who really misuse the word otaku, it actually is, in slang terms, it means somebody

985
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:39,680
who stays in their house all day and never goes out, just sits with their anime.

986
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,760
I know people like that.

987
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,840
For those that are in the chat room right now, I have to point out that Kiehl posted

988
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:51,360
a very funny picture, it kind of reminded me of the movie Office Space, where he's beaten

989
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:57,640
the crap out of his old Macintosh here with a hammer, it's like.2 seconds before impact

990
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,640
here.

991
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,520
Melody seems to be sad here as the Mac fan, uh oh, uh oh.

992
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,080
I'm the only Macintosh user and I must say that shocks and saddens me.

993
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,920
There you go.

994
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:16,440
I remember being 11 or 12 and doing tech support for my school on those old Apples.

995
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:17,840
Oh, it is a pic.

996
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,840
Oh, it's moving.

997
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,240
It kind of looked like a hammer at first glance and far away.

998
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:24,040
It looks like the pic is already through the monitor there on the screen.

999
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,760
My bad.

1000
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,640
And now, a moment of silence to mourn the loss of one more Macintosh.

1001
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:35,680
Three, three, three, oh, snap.

1002
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,160
Oh, poor Melody.

1003
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:42,320
Oh, I promised Irene she could get a second here to share a thought, so now I'd like to

1004
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,860
do a segment called Irene's Thought of the Day.

1005
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:45,860
So here we go.

1006
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:46,860
Deep thoughts by Irene.

1007
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:47,860
Here comes Irene.

1008
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:48,860
Here she is.

1009
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:53,860
I thought you were going to do this, I guess I did it.

1010
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:59,460
Oh, I was just going to let everyone know that procrastination is like masturbation.

1011
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:05,180
You know, it feels good until you realize that you've fucked yourself.

1012
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:10,460
That was deep. That was very deep.

1013
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:14,660
Thank you, thank you so much for that. And remember, wash your hands.

1014
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:23,340
I know it's a little late. I know it's a little late, Irene, but...

1015
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:29,860
You got some ha-has from the chatroom, though. She says thank you, chatroom.

1016
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:33,560
That was actually, though, a very interesting point.

1017
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:37,120
That is actually very true.

1018
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,120
Well thank you, yes it is.

1019
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:43,200
As Rob stares at me, and blinks at me.

1020
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:46,760
Are we just going to talk about masturbation the rest of the show then, or what's the deal?

1021
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,760
Masturbation makes coordination.

1022
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,760
Oh, we're losing listeners!

1023
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,760
Dear God, no!

1024
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:50,760
Bahmani!

1025
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,760
Bahmani!

1026
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,760
No, no, don't you notice that sex brings you in listeners, you know, spank, spank, spank,

1027
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,760
whatever.

1028
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,760
Irene, want to tell us some more about masturbation?

1029
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:11,960
What do you want to know about masturbation?

1030
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:20,760
Well I think masturbation, the definition of masturbation is pleasing yourself sexually.

1031
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,960
And I think guys do it more.

1032
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,300
I don't know. I don't watch people do it, but I think they do it more

1033
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:34,940
It's it's kind of like gin rummy. It's like you don't need a partner if you got a good hand. Yes

1034
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:42,980
Exactly. Oh god. Are we gonna make a bunch of like obscure quotes now or something sexual quotes now, dude

1035
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:46,400
I need good sound bites for the show. So just keep this keep this bit going

1036
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,280
I don't got there nothing else DDR to the egg, whatever talk about

1037
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:57,800
You know, it can be done with things that you find at the grocery store, too.

1038
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,040
Pork fat.

1039
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:04,840
I heard Crisco from somebody once.

1040
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:05,840
Chicken burrito.

1041
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,840
For a girl?

1042
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,840
No!

1043
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,840
From one of my ex-boyfriends.

1044
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:12,720
No, I mean, like, the stuff you can use, a girl can use this stuff.

1045
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,480
I don't think a girl really needs to use anything, do they?

1046
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,480
Your mama.

1047
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:22,480
I know you didn't talk about my moment, now I'm gonna get it.

1048
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:27,480
Okay, and now that we've completely crashed timber...

1049
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,480
Here you go, Rob.

1050
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:34,480
And of course, Rob has replaced the sexy planet.

1051
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,480
Gee, wow, that poor Mac died.

1052
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:42,480
And how about them coal miners? They're all happy.

1053
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:48,480
Let me run to the list here. Oh yes, let's talk about music.

1054
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,480
Music that we...

1055
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,480
I need music.

1056
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:56,480
Besides the B-Mani series, what is some music that you all like to listen to?

1057
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:00,480
No, I got criticized last week for not talking like the announcer, going,

1058
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,480
B-Mani! It's Konami's famous B-Mani series!

1059
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,480
Well, you know, the announcer is wrong, too.

1060
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,480
You know the announcer is wrong, too.

1061
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,480
It's B-Mani.

1062
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:15,480
Also, the announcer in Max 2 doesn't speak Japanese very well, but still.

1063
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:21,880
Anyway, alright music, so I'll tell you what, let's run it around, what's everybody listening

1064
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,380
to this week?

1065
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:26,220
You know, when I was driving home from San Francisco today, I listened to a new radio

1066
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:31,520
station over there, 92.7, which is just dance music all day, and I'm having this, like,

1067
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,900
I'm liking a lot of new trance music lately, like that Heaven song that they play on the

1068
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,980
radio all the freaking time, and these other songs, I'm liking that right now.

1069
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,940
I know it's played out, but I like it.

1070
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:42,940
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

1071
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:47,940
I was also listening to the 92-7, the dance, coming back from San Francisco today.

1072
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:48,940
Good stuff.

1073
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:49,940
I like it.

1074
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:50,940
And I just fell asleep.

1075
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:51,940
Some good shit, huh?

1076
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:52,940
Oh, yeah.

1077
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:53,940
Some good shit.

1078
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:54,940
How about our guests?

1079
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:55,940
What are you kids listening to?

1080
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:58,580
And also, I should ask you guys this, because you weren't here for this show.

1081
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:02,020
What songs do you think should be in a... Thank you, Dave.

1082
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:05,140
What songs do you think should be in a Bomani game that aren't?

1083
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:09,460
Well, as for what I'm listening to, it's rather eclectic.

1084
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:13,460
Normally, one of the things I've been digging a lot lately is a new Red Hot Chili Peppers CD.

1085
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:19,460
That's a really good CD. I think I just turn on By The Way and listen to that track over and over again.

1086
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:25,460
I don't even know how many times, but it's really mellow, but it's quite good.

1087
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:29,460
Most of the time I'm driving all that mellow throw on whatever CD he wants.

1088
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:33,460
It's just kind of whatever he chooses.

1089
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:40,460
I guess for my musical taste, it's sort of run around.

1090
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:46,060
Actually, I guess my first love always will be sort of like the 80s British invasion new

1091
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:47,380
wave movement.

1092
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:50,060
I was one of those kids born on MTV.

1093
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:55,340
My cousin had Betamax and taped MTV three hours a day, bring it over, and I was sucked

1094
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,340
in.

1095
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:59,460
It's that, and my second love will probably have to be the 90s new jack swing movement.

1096
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:06,460
Everyone loves cross colors and hats worn backwards with their tags still in them and hammer pants and BBD and all that good shmaz

1097
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:12,460
I guess that just really says I really don't really dig much of today's music, which is not to say there isn't good ones

1098
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:19,460
But back then, it's not just the fact that music was good, but I guess it's just all the memories that come along with it

1099
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:24,460
That's one of the big things about music, it's not just that it sounds good but you can feel it and you can relate it to things in your life

1100
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:28,460
Or you can feel emotions, that's kind of how I see music

1101
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:34,460
You're here. I agree. Did you make a beta reference in there? A beta reference?

1102
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:37,460
Oh, yeah. A beta, Max. And, you know, if you owned a beta, you were to mass the beta.

1103
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:39,460
Oh!

1104
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:45,460
I just want to tie our conversations into a loop.

1105
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:50,460
I was going back to my playlist, and I found Mr. E's Beautiful Blues, which is on Road Trip,

1106
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:55,460
which you may have seen by the eels, though. And I found a lot of songs I liked by them,

1107
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:59,020
So I actually got all four of their CDs and listened to a lot of that.

1108
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:00,660
And I went to the They Might Be Giants concert.

1109
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:03,820
I had their latest CD, No, and I've gotten two more.

1110
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:06,860
Now actually in the chat room, one of our chatters right now, Three Feet Elite, also

1111
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:08,640
went to the They Might Be Giants concert.

1112
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,340
So he was actually brought that up as well.

1113
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:11,340
Great concert.

1114
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:12,420
It was a lot of fun.

1115
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:15,420
They rocked out on a lot of songs I didn't expect and it was really a new experience.

1116
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:18,900
This is the second one I've been to, besides Red Hot Chili Peppers, it was a lot of fun.

1117
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,900
What was their best song they performed?

1118
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:21,900
Robot Parade.

1119
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:24,460
You've heard Robot Parade, sort of mellowed out.

1120
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,460
They actually rocked out on that a lot.

1121
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:30,460
There's one called On the Drags, which is a Rarities album I got from them.

1122
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:32,460
Just sort of normal rock that they did really well.

1123
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:33,460
It's a lot of fun.

1124
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,460
Cool.

1125
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:38,460
So, anyone else have any other songs they're listening to or any music in particular?

1126
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:41,460
I'm listening to a full spectrum of stuff.

1127
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:46,460
I've been listening to this George Acosta CD I had and just some trance music and stuff.

1128
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:49,460
And I'm also listening to KMFDM.

1129
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:50,460
Ah, cool.

1130
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,460
Attack.

1131
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:59,580
Well, you know, back when I was working at an industrial station, I was working at KSJS

1132
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:04,100
for San Jose State, and one of our favorite jokes running around was KMFDM stood for Kill

1133
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:12,900
Motherfucking Depeche Mode.

1134
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:20,540
For the people who can't hear what's going on away from the microphone, I'm sure for

1135
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:27,700
For people who have been reading the, what are you listening to now, thread on, who have

1136
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:32,180
talked to me since I came back from Anime Expo, know that I've really gotten heavily

1137
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:39,340
back into J-Rock, listening to Pero, to Malice Miser, but my favorite band, and I'm still

1138
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:42,660
upset to this day they disbanded, is Lunacy.

1139
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:46,700
I know a few weeks ago, my pick of the song on there was Crazy About You.

1140
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:53,860
If I had to pick one now, I'd be listening to Rossier 50 times a day.

1141
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:58,660
My whole big thing with J-Rock lately has been it's got the same feel that a lot of

1142
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:03,540
the good 80s rock had, and they've really gone overboard with the glam if you're into

1143
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:09,940
the visual K. For all the J-Rock fans out there, there's a lot of us now.

1144
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:15,100
Okay, I was being told by the chat room, I was given this link and said, don't click

1145
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,100
this link.

1146
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:18,100
What did they say, if you've been eating?

1147
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:22,620
If you've been eating. Okay, here we go. Let's see. Let's see what this takes us to

1148
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:31,540
That's horrible, but this is a family show I

1149
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:36,980
Do not think I'll be eating a cherry muffin anytime soon

1150
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:40,020
That was worse than goat see

1151
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:42,860
That was worse

1152
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:45,860
There are a few things that I could consider worse than that.

1153
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:46,860
WHY?

1154
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:47,860
WHY?

1155
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:48,860
Why did you do that?

1156
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:49,860
I think my eyes are bleeding.

1157
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:53,180
Okay, let's explain for those listeners out there what we just saw.

1158
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,180
I'm picturing a-

1159
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:56,180
Do you want to try to explain that?

1160
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,180
Really?

1161
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:58,180
You really want to try and explain that?

1162
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:59,180
Brad, explain.

1163
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,180
Okay.

1164
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:01,180
Okay.

1165
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:05,380
I'm picturing a five-year-old kid crossing a street covered in broken glass and like

1166
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:12,700
ten, like, UPS vans hit him all at once and they poured popcorn on him or something and

1167
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:19,660
some cherry syrup. It was pretty bad. Hi. Is that good enough visual? No, no, Dave is

1168
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:23,780
asking us to look at this again. I guess I know when to go to the bathroom now. Good

1169
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:30,700
timing there. Yay, yay, pictures. Yeah, I don't think we're going to. No. Go say what's

1170
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:35,980
bad now. Anyway, moving right along. How about some show news? Show news. Some Orange Lounge

1171
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:40,100
show news. Next week on the show, as if we're starting to get guests here. They love us.

1172
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,500
We're joined by Mel B and Melody this week.

1173
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,500
Are you guys having a good time?

1174
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,500
I hope you're having a good time.

1175
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:45,500
Oh, man, we're just kicking it.

1176
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:46,500
It's great.

1177
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,500
That's what we do here.

1178
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,500
We just kind of sit around and talk.

1179
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,700
Just lounging in the orange lounge.

1180
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,940
We're just chilling.

1181
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:56,080
Next week, we're going to have some special guests, but I'm not allowed to tell you who

1182
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,080
they are.

1183
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,900
You can go ahead and say who.

1184
01:27:58,900 --> 01:27:59,900
I can?

1185
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:04,620
Well, if they tell me I can, then I will, but I can tell you this much, there's some

1186
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:07,940
more Bay Area friends of ours that are going to be coming to visit, and there's two of

1187
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:08,940
them.

1188
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:11,780
We'll tell you that much, and if they want to reveal themselves,

1189
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:12,780
then we'll tell you all.

1190
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:14,860
And we're very happy to have them here.

1191
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:17,780
Well, when we do.

1192
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:19,820
Oh, we'll tell you guys during the break.

1193
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:23,140
Yeah, if you were here, part of our live studio audience,

1194
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:26,420
you will know.

1195
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:28,580
The live experience is truly something

1196
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:31,460
that people can live with.

1197
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:34,500
Because it's the only way you're going to get all the inside jokes, really.

1198
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,220
I think one day we're going to, well, I already

1199
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:39,820
said you know I've got the kit to go out to tournaments and I was actually gonna

1200
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:42,740
do this CVGL but unfortunately some personal life things got in the way and

1201
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:52,220
I wasn't able to I wasn't able to cover the tournament I wasn't able to cover

1202
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:55,620
the tournament so later we'll be going out Jamie and I will we go out to places

1203
01:28:55,620 --> 01:29:01,860
we'll take the live remote with us and random people but hopefully one day we're

1204
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:05,140
gonna broadcast this show live from somewhere else like a tournament or

1205
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:09,340
something will be in the that will be in the bathroom it's biggle yeah right

1206
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:18,580
coming to you live from the bathroom at AI you know just make sure that you

1207
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:25,580
don't you know eat in the snack bar before that you'll be fine so so I think

1208
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:28,620
now's a good break time how's that sound we'll take one more break break stuff

1209
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:31,620
then we'll come back we got about a half hour show up so take another quick break

1210
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:35,780
come back, wrap up the show, and put the nail in the coffin of this week's Orange

1211
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:39,860
Lounge. And let's see, what did I promise the chatroom, or what I promised

1212
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:43,880
the chatroom I'd play for him. You promised long train running for our chatroom. I promised long train running, didn't I? Okay, we're

1213
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:50,880
We're going to start it off with some long train running here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1214
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:29,880
Where would you be when you're deaf? Have a lyrical master scream

1215
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,880
If you wanna go faster, taking a train to the next station

1216
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,880
On the dance floor, rocking the nature

1217
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,880
The sound is coming out now, it's a day change

1218
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,880
Play your song loud, dance it, make your body rock

1219
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,880
Long train running and it won't stop

1220
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:45,880
Like a fister, I keep on churning Like a fire, I keep on burning

1221
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,880
Dance around in a place Cause I'm a DJ right to play

1222
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,880
But I got those evil feelings That I will go round and round

1223
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,880
And I still will go going on hard But I'm bound for the end of it

1224
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,880
But I am, what is your plan?

1225
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,880
Well, we can be right now Well, we can be right now

1226
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:08,880
Remember

1227
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,880
And here we go!

1228
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:58,880
The moon is quiet, the day that's almost gone

1229
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:05,880
It seems that something hurts me now

1230
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,880
When you're up to sleep

1231
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,880
The thing that never stops

1232
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:16,880
And you don't have to care to go

1233
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,880
When I think of you

1234
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:28,880
When I think of every other ghost of mine

1235
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,880
The one that you're looking for

1236
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:39,880
Just when I thought I could not be stopped So when the chance came to begin

1237
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:46,680
You are a ghost of my life, the one that I'm always really in

1238
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:49,480
Oh, crap, we went into dead air there for a minute.

1239
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:50,480
My bad.

1240
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:51,480
We're sorry.

1241
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:52,480
I'm going...

1242
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,840
Geez, tonight's just the night of Rob messing everything up, isn't it?

1243
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:56,840
Technical poopy.

1244
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:01,200
It's okay, Rob, we still love you.

1245
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,200
I'm just gonna guess where we were in the song.

1246
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,200
Irene said, who's we?

1247
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:10,200
I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one who's holding me

1248
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:17,200
I must know who you are

1249
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:24,200
I'm a social, I'm inside the light

1250
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:32,200
I'm the most I need, woman

1251
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,400
It's been a long time coming in

1252
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:38,400
When the break of every door

1253
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,200
Is a ghost of mine

1254
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:47,400
And I'm not looking for a home

1255
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:51,400
I could not be a star this way, I can't be true

1256
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:58,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1257
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,400
Oh

1258
01:36:51,400 --> 01:37:14,320
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

Because Bongo demands it

1263
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:46,320
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. It's the night of a million fuck-ups here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1264
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:54,320
I think it's because we have guests here tonight, so it's just like, you know, everything's gonna break down, you know, while we've got people from out of town watching, you know.

1265
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:55,320
But we're very glad to have them here.

1266
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:59,320
The other people here, they've been watching us fuck up week in and week out, so...

1267
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:03,320
Oh! We got somebody else. Devin, come here for a minute.

1268
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:04,320
Welcome to our...

1269
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:08,480
One of my roommate's friends apparently just got back.

1270
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,640
What do you think of this whole thing?

1271
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,040
You don't even...

1272
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,760
You know what Dance Dance Revolution is, correct?

1273
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,480
Yes, I've played a couple times.

1274
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:19,520
You have no freaking clue why people get obsessed with it, right?

1275
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,520
No.

1276
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:25,800
So, knowing that you've got tons of Bomani freaks and addicts listening right now, what

1277
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,220
do you have to say about Bomani?

1278
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:29,080
What do you think about it?

1279
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,960
What the hell is it?

1280
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,600
All the DDRs, all the Dance Dance Revolution and Button Map pounding games.

1281
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,080
You guys are just a bunch of freaks.

1282
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,080
Thank you!

1283
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,080
Yes, thank you very much.

1284
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:40,080
All right.

1285
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,080
Get out of here.

1286
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,080
Get lost.

1287
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,080
I don't want to see you.

1288
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,080
All right.

1289
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,080
Anyway.

1290
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:46,080
Meanwhile.

1291
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,080
He just doesn't know.

1292
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,080
He's not in the know.

1293
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,080
Okay.

1294
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:52,600
I was told over the break that I am allowed to announce our guests that are coming next

1295
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:53,600
week.

1296
01:38:53,600 --> 01:39:00,600
German, please.

1297
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:04,880
Our guest next week will be Jazz and DDR Mike.

1298
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,240
We'll be here in the house next week.

1299
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,240
Yay!

1300
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:11,200
DDR Mike is, I don't know, he's DDR Mike.

1301
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:12,200
He plays in Concord.

1302
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,200
Concord.

1303
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,200
Yes, yes.

1304
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:15,200
They're both Concord people.

1305
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,200
Yes.

1306
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,200
We have more Step Squad people.

1307
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,200
You know, more Step Squad hang out with me.

1308
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,200
Yay.

1309
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,200
All right.

1310
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,200
Woo!

1311
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,200
So they'll be here next week.

1312
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,200
I won't be alone anymore.

1313
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,400
They'll get to plug whatever they want and talk about whatever, so, because we let our

1314
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,400
guests plug things.

1315
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,800
Does anybody else want to plug something in the house?

1316
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:39,040
got gay. We have a request for a toaster and a personal

1317
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:51,400
massage. Back to DDR talk, Matt wanted to talk about

1318
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:56,000
his latest conquest in the DDR world, so let's talk about that.

1319
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,680
Well, right now what I've been trying to do, because, you know, I'm really big into the

1320
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:05,080
editing and the edit hacking, two things that are on the list, one probably before the other.

1321
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:09,800
First one is going to be getting 30-second steps in DDR. I'm pretty close to doing it,

1322
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:15,040
just have to actually test the file first. And the second one will be making Max 2 exclusive

1323
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:19,360
songs, finding the machine ID for that. So that's another thing that's on my list. I

1324
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:24,080
was hoping to have the 30-second steps done by today, but I fell behind, so maybe next

1325
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:29,420
week that is all well well and also speaking of edits I would like to go

1326
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:33,100
ahead and make sure that people don't forget the challenge although you know

1327
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:37,460
soca Hicks can ever send me you know visual proof that he's passed you know

1328
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:41,060
my challenge for look to the sky you know he'll be getting his GameCube pin

1329
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:45,980
but I'll go ahead and repeat that one for anyone who can full combo with a 90%

1330
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:50,860
perfect attack on my look to the sky at it it's called freefall you get a nice

1331
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:56,100
lovely little GameCube pin. First person who sends me proof gets it. And then

1332
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:02,860
there's the one for my DXY edit another, which basically is really evil. In one

1333
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:09,580
second place, in that lovely hell edit contest that Matt had, you will be taken

1334
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:14,060
out to dinner. So the one for that is if you full combo it or 90% perfect attack

1335
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:18,020
it, you know, either or I will take you out to a nice dinner, you know, with

1336
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:22,660
a decent limit on on what you can get will it be a candlelight dinner oh baby

1337
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:31,980
you get smoothed there's gonna be wine and cheese and corn there will be bread

1338
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:42,560
also and cloth napkins oh yeah all right now you know I'm referring to you know

1339
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:45,340
I'm not gonna take you out to like a four-star restaurant you know but maybe

1340
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:53,220
I'll take you out to sushi, or maybe out back if you're lucky.

1341
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:58,220
Of course I won't be touching the meat.

1342
01:41:58,220 --> 01:42:03,700
Anyone who can full combo it or get a 90% perfect attack on my another edit will get

1343
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:04,700
a nice meal for me.

1344
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:08,220
Oh, you guys are going to love it when I find 30 second notes.

1345
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:12,580
I've been playing, actually, the edit I made today that was Gun Test, but it got cut off.

1346
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:15,860
Because at the very end, all eight arrows come down at the same time, or relatively

1347
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:16,860
close to the same time.

1348
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:18,300
It's funny just to watch.

1349
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:21,780
That's when you have a seizure on the pad, you know.

1350
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:25,420
Of course, you know, the involuntary bowel movements are prohibited.

1351
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:32,660
So, and also, I am going to be, now that I have Max at home, I am going to be working

1352
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:41,080
on my other, my next hell edit, probably to Waka-Laka, because, you know, I want to do

1353
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:46,080
just this insanely evil. Wait, how can you do a Waka Waka edit with Max 1? Oh, it wasn't

1354
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:50,340
in there. You mean Blonde Girl? Okay, well forget it. I'm gonna, I wanna pick a super

1355
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:55,820
cute happy song and then do something evil to it. So, hey, if any, okay, if anybody wants

1356
01:42:55,820 --> 01:43:01,200
me to make a hell edit and name it after them, pick me a song and I will make you an edit

1357
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:06,080
to it. This is what happened when Jamie realized that Waka Waka was not in DDR Max 1. Oh my

1358
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,360
I can't believe it.

1359
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:09,360
You want me to kick you?

1360
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,360
Everything's ruined.

1361
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:13,080
You want me to kick you?

1362
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,080
Somebody give me something.

1363
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,760
Where's the Clifford ball?

1364
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,200
The Clifford ball's in the studio, in the other studio.

1365
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,380
We're in the big studio tonight.

1366
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:20,800
The Clifford ball's in the little studio.

1367
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,300
You know, I bought this Clifford ball two weeks ago to throw it at Rob, and I haven't

1368
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:25,300
done it yet.

1369
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:28,000
It, like, lives here now, so.

1370
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Mwahaha.

1371
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
So.

1372
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,280
But, you know.

1373
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:35,000
I can just play random sound effects the rest of the show.

1374
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:41,320
But you know everybody who at least you know posts on the SACBEN money forums know that

1375
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:46,040
Rob is our big gay chilli.

1376
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:51,840
When you a boy, I think you look like a chilli.

1377
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:55,280
Anyway enough with the sound effects.

1378
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,800
I'm not allowed to have fun here.

1379
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:00,360
We are a serious talk show.

1380
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:04,580
What other oh let's talk about let's talk about the future future thing.

1381
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:11,580
What other tournaments are you going to be attending in the future?

1382
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:41,180
That's actually triple threat is the one I'll be going to next because that's on August 1st and 2nd over at Sunnyvale

1383
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:45,740
Golfland check that out. I believe you have DDR spots going to be blowing up the spot with that one

1384
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:48,220
Okay, I have to ask though Thursday and Friday. What's up with that?

1385
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:51,740
Well, let's see

1386
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:55,220
Well, the main thing about trying to schedule turn me on Saturday and Sunday

1387
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:59,980
Well, a lot of people forget is Golfland is like all about the birthday parties and all those kind of things and you know

1388
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:10,980
That's a first priority. Thursday and Friday night, I mean, it's summertime. Most people that, you know, get off work around five or so, and it just kind of works. It's the best thing we can do for now.

1389
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:12,980
Are they going to be doing it at night, or...?

1390
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:15,980
As far as I know, yeah. Like, late afternoon into the night.

1391
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:22,980
I kind of want to go, but unfortunately I've got to work, and when you add a drive on top of that, it's not going to be very much fun for me to get out there, so...

1392
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:27,980
But I wish you guys the best of luck. It does sound like an awesome tournament. Very innovative new stuff that you guys are going to be doing there.

1393
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:33,340
Thank you. Hope it does go well, but that's part of thing about like determined stats bottom especially Mike no runs

1394
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:38,740
It's gone to a point where we kind of seen. Okay, everyone's skill and all that but there's only so much it's like

1395
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:43,780
Really to the casual player or like even observer a PA tournament is like watching grass grow

1396
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:48,140
I mean, it's like golf pre Tiger Woods. You had no interest in it and it was boring

1397
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:49,940
So now we're just trying to you know

1398
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:55,100
Mesh it in a few things like the one thing that we had was the wrestling theme this time around so it's like we have

1399
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:59,100
We have the Survivor Series where teams of four go against each other in PA tourneys.

1400
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:02,100
Do you think people would go to just a freestyle only tournament, though?

1401
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:08,100
Oh, absolutely. Freestyle to me, to make an analogy, it's like the NBA slam dunk contest.

1402
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:13,100
It's not something that has to go hand in hand. You've got to have your PA and your freestyle.

1403
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:18,100
It's cool to have them. Because even at the PA only tournaments, it seems like there's always a little freestyle on the side.

1404
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:20,100
Oh, yeah. Well, freestyle...

1405
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:22,100
It's like you get a free cup of freestyle.

1406
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:25,700
exactly it's just the hint of you know just like in some freestyle term and

1407
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:31,900
some people who PA think they're PAing is looks good and what are some things

1408
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:39,140
in freestyle that piss you off or make you upset Oh melody sitting you have

1409
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:44,380
something you want to say that would be the hand slaps and the knee drops I

1410
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:48,140
don't know it's gone to the point where actually I've gone through quite a few

1411
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:51,420
attorneys where I haven't seen that many hand slaps or knee drops I kind of missed

1412
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:52,420
them.

1413
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:54,540
Does that mean we'll see them in your next routine?

1414
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:55,540
I don't know.

1415
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:59,620
If I get dared to do it, I will do it.

1416
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:00,900
Maybe I'll have to dare.

1417
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:01,900
Okay.

1418
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:04,140
I dare you on this show right here.

1419
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:05,380
Next routine.

1420
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:08,100
Hand slaps and knee drops.

1421
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,100
Not only.

1422
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:10,100
Not only.

1423
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:11,100
As you're finished.

1424
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:12,100
As you're finished.

1425
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:13,100
Alright.

1426
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,100
Just so we got a few witnesses in here.

1427
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:15,100
In the last ten seconds.

1428
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:16,100
Alright.

1429
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:17,100
Handshake deal.

1430
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:18,100
There will be hand slaps and knee drops in my next routine.

1431
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:21,300
Now this is a great deal because I don't have to do a damn thing.

1432
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:23,140
I just get to point at them and make fun of them.

1433
01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:27,900
Yeah, seriously, I guess the things that make me mad about freestyle, it's not so much.

1434
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:29,180
There's really nothing

1435
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:32,980
that makes me mad. Just the only thing I get in order for people who really don't put in effort to, like,

1436
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:36,220
entertain the crowd. The only good thing about that is that they've

1437
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:38,920
made the pot fatter for the winter, but past that, it's

1438
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:41,020
a waste of time really for judges and

1439
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:42,060
for other people.

1440
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,900
I mean, I guess if they get a cheap throw out of it and they paid their money,

1441
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:47,940
I suppose it's all good to pass that.

1442
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:50,380
What would you rather see, you know,

1443
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:54,320
something that's really good improv or something that's been taken

1444
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,200
time to choreograph?

1445
01:47:55,200 --> 01:48:00,280
I think choreography definitely because not only does it show skill but it also shows

1446
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:01,780
like preparation. It shows that

1447
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:07,240
no, instead of coming up with something else, it comes in with a thought and of course you go

1448
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:09,320
through all the goods and bads. It's like a polished product.

1449
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:13,320
Improv, some people can make it look good, you know, it's not easy but at the same time

1450
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:17,400
in improv you pretty much have your bread and butter, you have one style and you stick with it

1451
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,560
whereas in a choreograph

1452
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:22,560
you can kind of integrate all sorts of little things into one big extravaganza

1453
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,880
now in the chat room they said okay dare him to do slaps and knee drops

1454
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:30,560
on dynamite rave and I said okay no we gotta draw the line somewhere it's a

1455
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:31,320
little much

1456
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:34,940
I mean at least doing the hand drops and knee slaps whatever

1457
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:38,240
I know at least let me do it to like

1458
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:42,320
well what's that D2R I guess you know at least make it you know D2R

1459
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:45,720
surprisingly after looking at those steps

1460
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:51,720
They actually look very freestyle-able. Not that I do it, but after this bit, I guess, damned now, you know.

1461
01:48:51,720 --> 01:49:00,720
Well, actually, you know, speaking of songs, you know, what do you think is the best freestyle song in Max 2, as far as the new stuff?

1462
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,720
Secret Rendezvous.

1463
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,720
I would definitely put that up.

1464
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:10,720
Because it's slow enough that you can put an extra beat in between all the notes, and so you can do more stuff.

1465
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:11,720
What would you think?

1466
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:24,720
Well, I think Secret Rendezvous actually on double Facebook is like double light is probably the best thing because especially for some people who play Pump It Up a lot, there's a lot of, it has sort of a five arrow thing where it's like the two middle and then you have like the ups and downs.

1467
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:32,720
So there are some people who if they rock at Pump It Up, they could like totally tear that up. I guess a new song, actually Spin the Disc is still my favorite.

1468
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:45,720
Before I had a tasteless 8-ball joke when you're talking about wasting time for judges, but you know, I came all the way from San Francisco for this. It's turning into one. You know, time has passed, so I'll just hand the mic back to Jamie.

1469
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:52,720
I may not be laughing on the outside, but inside I know I'm just doing cartwheels over that one.

1470
01:49:52,720 --> 01:50:00,720
I'm being suggested by the chatroom that A Minute is also a good freestyle song.

1471
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:06,720
They're saying that Secret Rendezvous is a song about lesbians.

1472
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:10,720
Didn't we talk about that on the show a few weeks ago?

1473
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:14,720
It is a lesbian song. We have the Brad Rant.

1474
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:17,720
Here comes Brad with his Secret Rendezvous Rant.

1475
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:22,360
okay i'm sure we'd all like to think it's about lesbians but it does say in the song

1476
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:26,760
he is mine or something like that unless it's a dyke a bull dyke then okay i guess

1477
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:34,360
no but it's transsexual see uh secret rendezvous it doesn't like take away the coolness of

1478
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:39,960
freestyle by having it about lesbians makes it even cooler and so fabulous so fierce

1479
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:45,520
This is also another good song for freestyle.

1480
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,360
I think that just really goes to show how really important it is to have great commercial

1481
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:52,760
songs in the DDR, any kind of like the Monty game.

1482
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:57,440
It's those songs that you're kind of familiar with, like A Minute or, you know, so fast.

1483
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:02,040
It's like songs from the 70s, a lot of us who grew up in that era or were kids and reminisced

1484
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:03,040
on that song.

1485
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:08,400
That's why I think commercial songs, especially if America got with it, although we've heard

1486
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:12,600
from the DDR Max from E3 for America.

1487
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,800
There's going to be commercial songs on there as well,

1488
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,060
instead of economics, which was a great mix, by the way,

1489
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:18,560
but all Konami originals.

1490
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:19,420
This one's going to be new.

1491
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:21,000
It's going to have some new stuff that's

1492
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,440
never been anywhere else.

1493
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:27,240
I think KOA might be catching up to go off topic a little.

1494
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:29,620
You think it's going to go the way of Euromechs, though?

1495
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:31,880
Because I noticed there was a new little deal there

1496
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:34,160
where they signed, they had some Zomba Records stuff.

1497
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:38,760
So does that mean we're going to get Britney in USDDR?

1498
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,120
Because Britney was on Zomba.

1499
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:41,880
They already have the Britney's Dance Mix.

1500
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:43,640
I don't think that they need to integrate it.

1501
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,100
And I just want to say for a record,

1502
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:47,640
Britney's Dance Beat is a hard freaking game.

1503
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:50,080
No, that is a ridiculously easy game.

1504
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:52,280
It's like the hardest song probably

1505
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:55,360
has the equivalent difficulty of maybe a three-footer.

1506
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:57,600
I want to know why you two have been playing this game.

1507
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:58,000
Dude, I got games.

1508
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Shoot yourselves now.

1509
01:51:59,000 --> 01:51:59,720
Go to hell.

1510
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:00,220
Oh my god.

1511
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:02,280
Games Freedom Pass from Blockbuster.

1512
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:05,280
And then I had to get it because, you know, it's ridiculously stupid.

1513
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:08,280
That's right, Brad. Brittany is easy to find for all you haters out there, Brad.

1514
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:12,280
How can you live with yourself? I mean, you have to go up to the cash register and say,

1515
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:17,280
I want to rent Brittany's dance whatever the fuck that was.

1516
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:21,280
Actually, I played it at E3 when they were demoing it, and the funny thing was, it's like,

1517
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:25,280
they had a challenge. You win a dance pad if you get the highest score.

1518
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,280
Not only did I get the highest score, I beat the freaking guys who were demoing the game.

1519
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:31,280
So, I thought that was just comedy in itself.

1520
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:35,840
The only thing that would make me even want to get that game is my absolute love for the

1521
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,160
first two Bust-A-Move games.

1522
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:43,080
In fact, well, I haven't necessarily played Dance Summit, but, you know, it is not Bust-A-Groove,

1523
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:44,400
it is Bust-A-Move, goddammit.

1524
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:47,200
Okay, there's Spike You in the Week number three.

1525
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,280
I know, but this was from something last night.

1526
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:55,400
I was wearing my Bust-A-Groove shirt, and somebody in Jomadu said, is that from Bust-A-Groove?

1527
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:56,400
Oh, I love that game.

1528
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,400
And I was like, yeah?

1529
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:01,400
Yeah, and I called her a dork and she got all upset.

1530
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,400
No, um...

1531
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:11,400
Oh, the only reason that I would buy the Britney's dance beat is so I could watch Britney Spears in skimpy outfits without having to watch it on MTV.

1532
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,400
It's animated, Dave.

1533
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:16,400
Dude, it's animated video.

1534
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:19,400
Just download porn, Dave. Get on the net and download porn.

1535
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:20,400
Hey, I do.

1536
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,400
Alright, thank you.

1537
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:26,880
Maybe we should get, you know, get someone to hook you up with a copy of, you know, Final

1538
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:27,880
Fuck X or something.

1539
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:28,880
Well, you know, is she...

1540
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:29,880
What the...

1541
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:30,880
Let's hear it for the...

1542
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,880
Your HP tastes so good.

1543
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:32,880
Yeah.

1544
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:33,880
HP got lazy.

1545
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:40,200
Well, you know, she was flipping off a lot of her fans in Mexico and stuff, and if she

1546
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:43,720
just keeps doing that and she loses popularity, maybe she'll turn the porn.

1547
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:44,720
There you go.

1548
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:48,320
First of all, if she fell off the face of the planet and went the way of Mariah Carey,

1549
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:51,720
I'd be happy.

1550
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,920
Ryan Carey is still around, supposedly.

1551
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,400
I mean, nobody seems to care, but she is still around.

1552
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,880
She went into a cuckoo bin for a few months.

1553
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:01,520
I know, but see, the fact is, no one cares.

1554
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:08,720
Anyways, as I was going to say about 10 or 15 comments ago,

1555
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:12,440
DDR Max USA is supposed to have 20 licensed songs.

1556
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:15,360
And I'd like to actually see a lot of the songs from Beat Mania

1557
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:17,820
get ported over to it, because there's a lot of good songs

1558
01:54:17,820 --> 01:54:19,920
that they just don't use anymore.

1559
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:20,560
Really sad.

1560
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:25,560
I was always surprised that Total Recall never made it into DDR.

1561
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:30,560
Well, one of the ones I got actually recently for my sim was the Mjolnir Solid theme.

1562
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:35,560
And I have that for, and I'm also very pleased to see that someone made double steps for it,

1563
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:39,560
so I can't wait to play that one when I get my pads working again.

1564
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:43,560
But yeah, definitely want to see some stuff, more stuff ported from BeatMania over.

1565
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:47,560
So I'm pretty excited to see what they're going to have.

1566
01:54:47,560 --> 01:55:02,560
I know one of them for sure is Overblast, because actually when I saw the trailer for Max for USA, that was the team music they were using, and Jason Deenose, who we all know is in front of the match here on DDR, had told me I was going to use that.

1567
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:05,560
I also want to see Hellscraper.

1568
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,560
Hellscraper, whatever!

1569
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:12,560
Why I use that, just play Mr. Bassman on the Disney Mix, man. It's fast enough and doggone it.

1570
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:14,560
That song sucks!

1571
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:17,560
Hey, let's not call names, people names here, dickhead.

1572
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:20,560
Um, no, the Hellscaper...

1573
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,560
Ducking Hardcore Max?

1574
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,560
Dude, I don't really like Hellscaper that much, I mean, I don't know why...

1575
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:29,560
Oh, Dave, did you play the, um, the simulator he had for the steps for it?

1576
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:30,560
Yes, I did.

1577
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:31,560
It was good, man, come on.

1578
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:34,560
I'd rather play V for the simulator something.

1579
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,560
Tank, that song rocked.

1580
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:40,560
I haven't played that one.

1581
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:43,560
I'm still voting for Total Recall.

1582
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:51,560
I'd like to throw in my vote for Baby Bae Gimme Your Love 2001, the remix that they have on BeatMania 7's mix. That is the most awesomest freaking thing ever.

1583
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,560
And for the people who, you know, you might get a taste of Total Recall at the minute.

1584
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:09,560
But, you know, I think that there are so many good songs, though, that, you know, you had to imagine the staff, the people who choose the songs, the Konami of Japan, just sitting there going,

1585
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:12,040
they're going, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what do we think, what do we think, what

1586
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,560
do we think, what do we think?

1587
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:14,960
Because there's just so much good stuff.

1588
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:19,960
I mean, it's really hard to narrow it down, I think.

1589
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:23,920
I personally would like to see them, though, just instead of going back into their archive,

1590
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:26,320
just kind of make some new stuff up.

1591
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:28,400
Just let LED go to town and I'll be happy.

1592
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:35,240
Let's finally attack, let them go to town, then go visit some of those, just like how

1593
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:39,600
In Japan, they have the Dance Mania series, they're hooked up with Toshiba AMI, and all

1594
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:40,600
that.

1595
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:43,000
Why don't you let them go to town with some people that put out the compilations here,

1596
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,440
like maybe the Ultimate Dance Party or the Trans Party compilations here, that would

1597
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:47,440
be pretty cool.

1598
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:51,680
I think if DDR just went off the Dance Mania Diamond Millennium, hit the compilation, all

1599
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:56,040
in one mix, that one double CD, all in one mix, I think that would be the most greatest

1600
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,040
thing in the world.

1601
01:56:58,040 --> 01:56:59,040
That would be.

1602
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:03,520
Or, you know, like they did with Para Para, hook up with Avex, and throw some of the Avex

1603
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:10,520
stuff in the DDR. The music that I've put out, you know, sponsored by Avex Tracks, was

1604
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:15,540
just some absolutely awesome stuff. Now, I know this was in Disney Mix, but I'd still,

1605
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:21,640
I know, just for comic value, I'd like to see Night of Fire in another DDR mix with

1606
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:27,480
that guy, Bucky, in the background, as the video. Bucky? Well, you weren't here for it.

1607
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:29,480
That was my VCD that I had.

1608
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:33,480
Oh, that's why I was off shuffling through AX.

1609
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:38,160
Oh yeah, they should show the one the turn the beat around video they did where he does

1610
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:42,600
this little thing with his hands and blows this one chick's skirt up.

1611
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:43,600
It was great.

1612
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:46,480
Is that the guy whose theme music was Night of Fire every time he showed it?

1613
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:47,480
Yes, that guy rocks.

1614
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:48,480
Rob told me about this one.

1615
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:49,480
Oh, he's so great.

1616
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:50,480
That sounds like...

1617
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,480
He's my idol.

1618
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:53,480
You gotta have goals.

1619
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:56,840
Irene's yelling in the back they should put in music from Ranma.

1620
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:59,680
We wouldn't you just be happy if they had Genma come out and dance around?

1621
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,800
Hello, I'm a panda.

1622
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:05,200
Be a happy little panda.

1623
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:09,760
Alright, we're getting ready to wrap up the show, so I leave Melody, Mel B, do you guys

1624
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:14,120
have any final comments you'd like to leave us with?

1625
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:18,000
I just wanted to thank you guys for having me on board, I thought this place was just

1626
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
pretty dope.

1627
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:24,520
I'd like to come in on a more regular basis actually, and for everyone else out there,

1628
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:29,200
freestyling, PA-ing, whatever the hell you do, just don't give me that funk or anything

1629
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:36,200
else. I don't want to catch the VD or Herpes or all that other stuff. And check out ddrspot.com,

1630
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:43,240
come to Triple Thread, and if nothing else, just be true to yourself and, well, gosh,

1631
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:50,240
I'm terrible at these inspirational speeches. Be excellent to each other. Party on. We're

1632
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:54,240
We're always glad to have you guys on whenever you feel like coming back.

1633
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:57,240
Yeah, definitely. Come back any time, you guys. You're always welcome.

1634
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:59,240
Even next week, if you guys happen to come to the party Saturday...

1635
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:01,240
Ooh, I didn't say that over the air, did I?

1636
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:02,240
No.

1637
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:04,240
My roommate's back there going,

1638
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:05,240
Oh, God!

1639
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:07,240
Oh, yeah, yes.

1640
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:15,240
I'd like to announce that we'll be hopefully making a trip down to Pleasanton-Qsar on the 10th next week to do SAC Attack 3.

1641
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:18,240
We will have Team SAC back.

1642
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:24,600
take that back anyways but so we'll be down there I heard that they just got a

1643
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:28,760
brand new fifth mix machine so I'll be willing to break that in and kick

1644
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:34,140
anyone's ass in Q's are I will take the orange lounge remote to that location so

1645
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:37,960
if you guys want to meet us there and talk to us and make a cameo on the show

1646
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:40,860
that'd be great maybe we should make a mention of our exploits from the first

1647
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:44,640
team sack it should be from probably about 7 p.m. to midnight we'll probably

1648
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,760
We do like a half day pass down there on that Saturday.

1649
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,720
So just come on down, say hi.

1650
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:51,080
You'll definitely recognize us.

1651
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:51,880
Oh, yes.

1652
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:52,380
All right.

1653
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:53,920
We'll be the ones meeting everybody.

1654
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,840
Next week on the show, we have, don't forget,

1655
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,680
we've got Jazz and DDR Mike are going to be joining us.

1656
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:00,680
And they're some of the regulars over in Concord.

1657
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:02,600
So they'll be joining us next week

1658
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:04,440
to talk about Lord knows what.

1659
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:06,880
But they'll be able to plug whatever they want.

1660
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:07,760
I guess that's it.

1661
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:09,960
Any last thoughts, Jamie?

1662
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:11,240
I want another donut.

1663
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:12,560
All right, good night, everybody.

1664
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:13,680
Thanks for being here.

1665
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:17,400
And we're going to have to do our fortune cookie message on the fly tonight, so we might

1666
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:20,040
get one more fuck up before the show's over, but we're going to try it.

1667
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:21,040
I don't fuck up.

1668
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,040
What are you talking about?

1669
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:23,040
Goodnight everybody.

1670
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,040
No, not that.

1671
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:25,040
It's the sound part.

1672
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:26,040
You'll do just fine.

1673
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:27,040
Here we go.

1674
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,040
Let's try it.

1675
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:29,040
Because I'm perfect.

1676
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,640
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1677
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:35,480

1678
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:41,680

1680
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:47,280
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1681
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:53,500
Because I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, no one gives a fuck.

1682
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:58,560
And as a special bonus, because I was too fucking lazy to edit the sound file, last

1683
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:00,720
week's fortune cookie message of the day.

1684
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:04,520
Kids, that glue you use in school, it's made from dead horses.

1685
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:09,240
No Wilbur, it's just a sprain.

1686
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:12,780
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
