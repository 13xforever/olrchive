[SPEAKER_10]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:19,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Our live talk program begins now.

3
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:29,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio may contain sexual and adult content and many instances of the F-word, which is not safe for children.

4
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,943
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn you, stop calling here.

5
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it 4215, pussy way?

6
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:49,163
[SPEAKER_06]: You bitch!

7
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:50,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let me check the zip code.

8
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:52,184
[SPEAKER_06]: 212, fuck you!

9
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:53,864
[SPEAKER_06]: You have no morals, darling.

10
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:58,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and the scorching case of herpes.

11
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,486
[SPEAKER_06]: She's my great news.

12
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:03,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Mecca lecca hi, mecca hi dee ho.

13
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:05,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.

14
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too!

15
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:08,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucker, yeah?

16
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:09,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm working on it.

17
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:10,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Loser.

18
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:10,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame!

19
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:12,909
[SPEAKER_06]: On the side of my face.

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:26,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut While I go listen to my Britney Spears records I am your singing telegraph

21
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:39,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, excuse me, on planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

22
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:45,577
[SPEAKER_16]: That intro brought to you by Krispy Kreme Donuts, being regurgitated by me as we speak, thank you.

23
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:50,599
[SPEAKER_16]: You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.

24
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,120
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

26
00:01:58,063 --> 00:01:58,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey!

27
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:03,204
[SPEAKER_16]: This is episode number six for July the 28th, 2002.

28
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:09,207
[SPEAKER_16]: We are joined in studio once again by a whole lot of guests, including a few travelers tonight.

29
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,988
[SPEAKER_16]: Say hello, everyone, to a familiar freestyler.

30
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:12,809
[SPEAKER_16]: You might have heard of him.

31
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,610
[SPEAKER_16]: His name's Mel B. Give it up.

32
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:16,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Give what up?

33
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:19,691
[SPEAKER_16]: Do I have to give up freestyling?

34
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:22,772
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I thought you already threatened to do that already.

35
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:23,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

36
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:29,613
[SPEAKER_11]: No, see, every time people think I retire, it's just like, I'm retiring my clothes, I'm retiring my shoes.

37
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:33,394
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's like, I don't know, I just get bored, I guess.

38
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:36,114
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard being perfect with nothing to do.

39
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:42,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mel B. Also, please give it up for the biggest Sharks fan on the planet.

40
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:43,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Say hello to Melody.

41
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:49,771
[SPEAKER_16]: Any witty things you'd like to add to follow up to the... How can I follow that up?

42
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:51,092
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just absolutely impossible.

43
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:54,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to threaten to retire anything here on the show tonight?

44
00:02:55,796 --> 00:02:57,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I think about my sharks, I'm sorry.

45
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:58,698
[SPEAKER_07]: It just doesn't happen.

46
00:02:59,299 --> 00:02:59,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Fair enough.

47
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,061
[SPEAKER_16]: And we've got a lot of other regulars in the house tonight.

48
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:06,624
[SPEAKER_16]: As I go around the room, we've got Brad... I'm Brad.

49
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:07,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Bradley...

50
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:18,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Paul, Matt, Irene, and that's about it.

51
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:19,806
[SPEAKER_16]: That's everybody.

52
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:22,608
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll be talking to all of them a bit later, but first a quick break.

53
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:23,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other thoughts from you?

54
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:26,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a thought.

55
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:26,811
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

56
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:28,753
[SPEAKER_09]: The mouth of a child's plate.

57
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,693
[SPEAKER_09]: I said that wrong.

58
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:31,294
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, let her finish that.

59
00:03:31,314 --> 00:03:32,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, you want to finish that thought now?

60
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Deep thoughts by me.

61
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:38,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any deep thoughts, so just go to break.

62
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,488
[SPEAKER_16]: We already went halfway into break there, my bad.

63
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:42,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry about that.

64
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:44,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Technical inconvenience, there it happens.

65
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,751
[SPEAKER_07]: What, technical incompetence, what?

66
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Technical incompetence, user incompetence right there.

67
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:52,674
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to break, I'll be right back.

68
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:35,615
Thanks for watching!

69
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:37,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

70
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:22,328
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse pomani band, Erotic.

71
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it all night, do it with me.

72
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,570
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

73
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you take vocal lessons?

74
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:29,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill your teacher.

75
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:31,491
[SPEAKER_00]: In the heat of the night.

76
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:34,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

77
00:10:35,353 --> 00:10:36,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it.

78
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:38,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

79
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:38,594
[SPEAKER_16]: Next.

80
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, that was cool.

81
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:46,078
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you even know why you're here?

82
00:10:46,158 --> 00:10:47,839
[SPEAKER_16]: That was just bloody pathetic.

83
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,380
[SPEAKER_16]: Next!

84
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:52,764
[SPEAKER_16]: Come on, do it with me.

85
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:54,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, yes, that's it!

86
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:56,447
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a winner!

87
00:10:57,248 --> 00:11:01,051
[SPEAKER_10]: A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

88
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Every Sunday night, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

89
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:06,894
[SPEAKER_09]: You're repeating yourself.

90
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:07,535
[SPEAKER_16]: You are listening.

91
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:07,875
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

92
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:08,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to repeat myself.

93
00:11:08,516 --> 00:11:10,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a star just fell out of the sky and died.

94
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:12,479
[SPEAKER_09]: It landed on somebody.

95
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,721
[SPEAKER_16]: If a star is falling, though, shouldn't she be making a wish on it?

96
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:16,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I wish you don't follow me.

97
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,725
[SPEAKER_16]: Quite the optimistic, aren't we?

98
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:22,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Jamie's been having a pessimism week.

99
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:23,268
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fun.

100
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,130
[SPEAKER_16]: Does that mean we need to start off with your FU of the week?

101
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

102
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:28,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, I think we need to start off with Jamie's FU of the week.

103
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's F.U.

104
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:31,643
[SPEAKER_16]: of the Week Jamie's F.U.

105
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:31,923
[SPEAKER_09]: of the Week

106
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:52,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm sure people who read my live journal and who know me know that I've gotten addicted to this game as of late.

107
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:53,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I was happy.

108
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:55,044
[SPEAKER_09]: I was having a good week.

109
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:57,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I got goggles, which you can't get on the current beta.

110
00:11:57,608 --> 00:11:58,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I traded half my armor for it.

111
00:11:58,769 --> 00:11:59,691
[SPEAKER_16]: And what do goggles do?

112
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:00,772
[SPEAKER_09]: They just look cool.

113
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:01,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

114
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:04,755
[SPEAKER_09]: They do, seriously, all they do is look cool.

115
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:06,716
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie has to be cool.

116
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:08,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Heaven forbid Jamie's uncool.

117
00:12:08,777 --> 00:12:14,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a 1 in 10,000 chance item that each creature will drop, that 1 in every 10,000 creatures will drop 1.

118
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:17,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a card, sold it, got more goggles, sold that, got more money.

119
00:12:17,422 --> 00:12:19,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Now this is Ragnarok or EverQuest?

120
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:20,244
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Ragnarok Online.

121
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:20,744
[SPEAKER_16]: Ragnarok?

122
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:22,025
[SPEAKER_16]: It's sounding like EverQuest here.

123
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:24,186
[SPEAKER_09]: No, this is my own crack.

124
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:25,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not play EverQuest.

125
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:30,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, so I'm all happy and looking forward to getting levels when the server goes down.

126
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:40,454
[SPEAKER_09]: and then the server comes back up after I try to sign on to the damn game for an hour and then the character server goes down so I try to log on and hey, my character's missing, yay!

127
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:47,016
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, for people who do play, if you see that the characters are not showing up if you make a new one, you will never get your old character back.

128
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:48,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that nice?

129
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:52,237
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I've been sitting here now for

130
00:12:53,254 --> 00:13:01,261
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple days not being able to play Ragnarok because either the character server is down or the main server is down or doesn't just want me to log in or this other crap.

131
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:05,826
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm just ready to say screw it except I am an addict.

132
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,049
[SPEAKER_16]: Now do you have any other FUs of the week?

133
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:10,970
[SPEAKER_09]: DuploWeb, damn them.

134
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:13,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate DuploWeb.

135
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:15,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Any particular reason?

136
00:13:16,784 --> 00:13:22,386
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how they make Duplo blocks for small children or people who ride the short bus?

137
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:23,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

138
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:28,767
[SPEAKER_09]: DuploWeb is like that, except it's for, you know, lobotomized newborns.

139
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:33,309
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how stupid you have to be to go with DuploWeb.

140
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:41,911
[SPEAKER_09]: And me, you know, they did such a good job the first time we had Sackbay Mania, and then they've been just utter poopy heads lately, you know?

141
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:43,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm being filtered.

142
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:48,714
[SPEAKER_16]: It's our new Orange Lounge Language Filter 2000.

143
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:52,436
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I figured I used up all of my... That's a bunch of bull poopy.

144
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:55,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Owl Machino movie.

145
00:13:55,898 --> 00:14:05,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured I used up, you know, all of my fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fucks last week, so I'm gonna be nice today, so fuck them up their asses!

146
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And... I hate them.

147
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:11,128
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to die!

148
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:14,570
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to go to hell and die there.

149
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:18,207
[SPEAKER_09]: So if anybody wants to give me money, do it now.

150
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:21,289
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll have a thank you next week.

151
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:22,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

152
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoever decides to give me money, I will not do a fuck you in your direction.

153
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:27,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

154
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:29,473
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's it for your fuck you of the week?

155
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:31,314
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll think of something else in a minute.

156
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:32,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I have an F you of the week.

157
00:14:33,536 --> 00:14:35,076
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to play my F you of the week theme song.

158
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:41,580
[SPEAKER_16]: Because my F you of the week... Because when I start complaining, I sound like a chicken, so I have to play this song.

159
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:48,964
[SPEAKER_16]: My FU of the week is traffic in San Francisco, especially around the 101-80 junction area.

160
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:51,266
[SPEAKER_16]: What a piece of shit.

161
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:53,429
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the people there cannot drive at all.

162
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:54,770
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't know what lane they're supposed to be in.

163
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Shouldn't that be like an FU forever, not just for the week?

164
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:09,560
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it pissed me off this week in particular because I was trying to come home today because I moved, for those that don't know, I moved the show out of the little tiny room into the big living room tonight because I knew we'd be having more guests.

165
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,142
[SPEAKER_16]: And I had about, oh, probably about 20 minutes to move the computer out here into the big room because of traffic.

166
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:15,863
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd hoped to have a couple hours.

167
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:17,684
[SPEAKER_16]: That didn't quite end up happening.

168
00:15:17,724 --> 00:15:21,366
[SPEAKER_16]: So my FB of the week is people who can't drive and cause me to get home late.

169
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:28,067
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't foresee that getting any better because people are getting dumber and dumber and dumber as, you know, time goes on.

170
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:34,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of, you know, being, you know, we're going to eventually have to evolve from a Funky of the Week to a, you know, Funky with a Rabbit Horse of the Week.

171
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Rabbit Horse.

172
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:39,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

173
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Irene's talking about a rabbit horse.

174
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,730
[SPEAKER_08]: The rabbit horse.

175
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,610
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I doing?

176
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:48,771
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the rabbit horse with big, sharp, pointy teeth.

177
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:49,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Arrgh.

178
00:15:49,963 --> 00:15:51,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, worst radio ever.

179
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:52,724
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't make signs with your hands.

180
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:53,844
[SPEAKER_14]: They can't see them.

181
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:55,885
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

182
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,586
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't care what they see.

183
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:00,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they don't see what we're doing.

184
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:01,727
[SPEAKER_16]: We're doing this show to entertain ourselves.

185
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:02,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

186
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:02,868
[SPEAKER_16]: To hell with you.

187
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:03,948
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just kidding.

188
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:04,488
[SPEAKER_16]: Stay connected.

189
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:05,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Please, we need ratings.

190
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:06,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't go anywhere.

191
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,050
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually care.

192
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,170
[SPEAKER_09]: We just pretend otherwise.

193
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:16,893
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's cool to not give a shit, so that's what we're doing here tonight.

194
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, anyway, let's start to our guests, shall we?

195
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:23,497
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's save this train wreck show and talk to the new blood here tonight.

196
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:26,559
[SPEAKER_16]: We have some guests and I'm scooting over to get near the guests.

197
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody say hello to Melody and Mel B. Hi.

198
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:30,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

199
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,785
[SPEAKER_16]: So what are you kids doing in town this week?

200
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:35,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that can be put on the radio, sorry.

201
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,050
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, what brings you to Sacramento this week?

202
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,493
[SPEAKER_07]: We just had to see all you wonderful people.

203
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:46,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Such a freaking suck-up.

204
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,128
[SPEAKER_09]: You're trying to make me clean house.

205
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:49,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I know.

206
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:53,010
[SPEAKER_16]: You only showed up just so we'd all clean our houses, basically.

207
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't my mother send you?

208
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:57,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, my evil plot has been foiled.

209
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:00,274
[SPEAKER_16]: Dear God.

210
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:03,576
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, I'm trying to think.

211
00:17:04,636 --> 00:17:05,857
[SPEAKER_16]: What else has been going on lately?

212
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:06,937
[SPEAKER_16]: We could talk to Melody and Melvia.

213
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:08,198
[SPEAKER_16]: How about the CBGL?

214
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:10,900
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are the only ones that are at this big tournament at CBGL last week.

215
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,560
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you guys think of it?

216
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:20,750
[SPEAKER_11]: From a freestyle perspective, I would probably rank this as one of the top two or three freestyle competitions I've ever been to, probably, arguably in America.

217
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:28,198
[SPEAKER_11]: It was definitely just, you could have taken the top 15 people out there, they probably would have placed in any other run to middle tourney last year.

218
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Bar has gone sky high.

219
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:35,065
[SPEAKER_16]: So you think every other tournament now is going to have to live up to this?

220
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:38,367
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be unfair, but I would not be surprised.

221
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:43,771
[SPEAKER_11]: The good thing about it is you still have the vets that are coming out there, guys like Trampower, Lil B, and all that.

222
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:44,692
[SPEAKER_11]: They're still doing their thing.

223
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:46,113
[SPEAKER_11]: They're living up to their reputations.

224
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:49,515
[SPEAKER_11]: But you have a lot of people coming up from Scandia, from out of state.

225
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,337
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a kid from Omaha who absolutely wrecked shop out there.

226
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:56,800
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're the new blood, and they're still experiencing all this great freestyle hype.

227
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,261
[SPEAKER_11]: They're still in love with the game.

228
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:06,006
[SPEAKER_11]: And as long as we get those new people up in there and they're busting their ass, I mean, it's going to be a positive thing for freestyle and general attorneys.

229
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:07,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Right on.

230
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,848
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you think of the tournament, Melody?

231
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:09,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Just going to watch.

232
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you go to a lot of tournaments?

233
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:15,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I get dragged to a lot of tournaments most of the time.

234
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:21,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, this time I did not see a single freestyle because management sucked ass.

235
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:24,281
[SPEAKER_07]: They refused to move the machine outside.

236
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:26,422
[SPEAKER_07]: They created a huge fire hazard indoors.

237
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:28,264
[SPEAKER_07]: If any of you have been to Castro Valley...

238
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:31,111
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very small.

239
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:36,899
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a small inner room that has the DDR machine and they did not move the damn machine outside.

240
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,884
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was too dang crowded and the air conditioning was not working inside either.

241
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:44,349
[SPEAKER_07]: So management was just being very hard to deal with.

242
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,592
[SPEAKER_16]: You're getting into an FU of the week there.

243
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:59,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, this would be my FU of the millennium, probably, but hey, we had many run-ins with the manager of Castor Valley, and for someone who agreed to hold the tournament, he should have been a lot more accommodating.

244
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:04,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe Mel was waving desperately, wanting to throw another comment in there.

245
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:10,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and I guess I'd have to do a quick FE2 at 8-Ball because he was the one that chickened out of a judges-only freestyle tournament.

246
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:17,486
[SPEAKER_11]: There was going to be some money on the line, but his excuse to the attorney director who, you know, approached me, said, do you want to do a freestyle tournament for judges?

247
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:18,347
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, hell yeah.

248
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:28,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And he said, well, I won't have anything in time or, according to, from what I heard around the grapevine, apparently he thought whatever prize he was going to get was not worth risking his reputation over.

249
00:19:30,391 --> 00:19:30,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

250
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:31,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

251
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:40,536
[SPEAKER_16]: So who are some of the new freestylers you guys think we're going to be hearing about in the next two tournaments?

252
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:44,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Just doing awesome jobs and people you might never have heard about that maybe you should start paying attention to.

253
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:50,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think the biggest contingent of freestyles that are blowing up are the ones from Scandia.

254
00:19:51,178 --> 00:19:56,463
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be guys like Hypnox, he's been around, but you got guys like Lou Styles, who's absolutely amazing.

255
00:19:56,503 --> 00:20:01,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone who thinks 8-Ball or Dinkot are good pop lockers, this guy has just taken it to a higher level.

256
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:07,655
[SPEAKER_11]: You got, who else, oh yeah, Bruce Leroy, he's one of the most charismatic guys out there.

257
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:12,339
[SPEAKER_11]: and just for people in general, there's that kid from Omaha I told you about.

258
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,240
[SPEAKER_11]: His name was Tequila.

259
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:18,225
[SPEAKER_11]: He just recently joined RTF, which you may or may not know is my crew, Return to Freestyle.

260
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:26,373
[SPEAKER_11]: He was that good that practically after his first routine, guys just wanted him, swept him up, and he's made quite an impression on everybody.

261
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:33,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell us a little more about RTF, because that's kind of a big, pretty well-known... Oh, he's going to give you the whole spiel here.

262
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:37,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Give us a breakdown, because anything else you want to plug here while you're on the show, go for it.

263
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:41,279
[SPEAKER_16]: But tell us a little something about RTF and how it all started and what it stands for and all that.

264
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,291
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, for a quick rundown of the history, RTF started around January of 2001.

265
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:50,293
[SPEAKER_11]: It was actually Turnarocci, the tournament at Metreon.

266
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:57,695
[SPEAKER_11]: It was about the time when people, we got sick of DDR USA, and people at freestyle tournaments weren't really putting up a good effort.

267
00:20:57,735 --> 00:20:59,495
[SPEAKER_11]: They were just sort of improv-ing on stage.

268
00:20:59,515 --> 00:21:02,276
[SPEAKER_11]: You weren't putting any time or thought into it.

269
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:08,258
[SPEAKER_11]: And so one of my friends was like, don't you remember back when we actually used to bust ass on freestyle, when we actually used to be creative and, you know, give a damn?

270
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:14,842
[SPEAKER_11]: and I thought about, and although I wasn't one of those guilty people, you know, he was just saying, yeah, we have to go back to our roots.

271
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:15,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, yeah, I'm all for it.

272
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:17,023
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to return to freestyle.

273
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:18,284
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the name kind of stuck.

274
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:22,266
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it was a lot better than like the Foot Clan or, you know, something else that was already taken.

275
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:23,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember the Foot Clan.

276
00:21:24,508 --> 00:21:26,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And so from there, you know, we just got a few people.

277
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:31,392
[SPEAKER_11]: At first it was like Shintenshi, me, Mike Ngo, Asian Innovation, then Bran came along.

278
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:36,075
[SPEAKER_11]: A few people, and then I think our first major tournament was the Arcade Infinity 2 tourney.

279
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:37,155
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one where I took Solo 2K.

280
00:21:37,235 --> 00:21:37,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

281
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:44,941
[SPEAKER_11]: and, um... No, we do not need a solo sucks anyway comment.

282
00:21:45,742 --> 00:21:48,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, besides, don't you know the new catchphrase is this DDR sucks?

283
00:21:49,524 --> 00:21:49,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

284
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,492
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, that's just pretty much RTF in a nutshell.

285
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:55,553
[SPEAKER_11]: We like to have a good time.

286
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:57,613
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all about just good times and all that stuff.

287
00:21:57,673 --> 00:22:01,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Freestyle is just, you know, one of the things we happen to like to do.

288
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:08,357
[SPEAKER_11]: As for other plugs, well, DDR Spot, of course, is the site that I help run along with a couple of the RTF members.

289
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:11,078
[SPEAKER_11]: We're about to do kind of a new thing.

290
00:22:11,118 --> 00:22:13,299
[SPEAKER_11]: We got a lot of new stuff coming on right now.

291
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:17,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Interviews with Jason Eno's doing like stuff about we're usually breaking news with

292
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:24,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Imports, and all that kind of stuff, because we're affiliated with Team Guilo and Vimaniac, so we've got a good base of connections.

293
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:27,128
[SPEAKER_11]: And basically, keep coming to the site.

294
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:32,572
[SPEAKER_11]: We are adding a lot of new stuff daily, and who knows, you just might get knocked on your ass the next time you get there.

295
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:34,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds pretty good.

296
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:35,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything you want to plug while you're here, Melody?

297
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:37,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Whee!

298
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:39,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, thank you, well put.

299
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:43,300
[SPEAKER_16]: You got nothing to plug but your ego today.

300
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,502
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, I'm here, I'm here because I rule.

301
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:46,423
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why you're here.

302
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:48,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone knew that already, though.

303
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:50,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Melody, all these rules.

304
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:52,228
[SPEAKER_16]: My bad.

305
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:52,708
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

306
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:53,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Excuse me, ma'am.

307
00:22:57,491 --> 00:23:00,693
[SPEAKER_16]: I noticed that you took an interesting trip out to Omaha lately.

308
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:02,033
[SPEAKER_16]: You actually went out to help.

309
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:04,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Were you running a tournament out there, or what was the deal with that?

310
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:17,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, actually, it's a funny story because I had a friend at Tequila, actually, he caught me on IM, or basically on the three courts, and he was saying that their first freestyle tournament that they had absolutely sucked because the judging was terrible.

311
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:24,749
[SPEAKER_11]: He showed me a videotape of what they did, and he was clearly more talented than everyone else, and he ended up taking third, so I was like, dang, you need someone to really run a tourney well.

312
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,495
[SPEAKER_11]: And he said, well, why don't you come out here and show them how it's done?

313
00:23:29,515 --> 00:23:31,278
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, you mean me compete?

314
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:32,159
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's like, yeah.

315
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:33,561
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, well, if I had the money, sure.

316
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:38,308
[SPEAKER_11]: And he basically, he and a few friends offered me a whole bunch of money to come out there and compete.

317
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:41,812
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, wait a minute, you're going to pay my way to kick your ass?

318
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:43,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, something just didn't register.

319
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:47,418
[SPEAKER_11]: And for a moment, you know, I actually had scruples and I felt bad about it.

320
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:54,144
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was like, tell you what, you take that money, you let me run your tournament, you know, give you the California experience you probably won't get anywhere else.

321
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:57,767
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's kind of, you know, how it ran from there, went to their arcade out there.

322
00:23:57,807 --> 00:24:03,392
[SPEAKER_11]: And surprisingly enough, for an arcade in the Midwest, you would think they won't have that much B-Money or just be that good.

323
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:06,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say it's probably the most impressive arcade I've been to in, like, three levels.

324
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:13,936
[SPEAKER_11]: One level is just pure retro with, like, Kung Fu Master, Karate Champ, and, like, a place that has Karate Champ, man, how can you beat that?

325
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:16,017
[SPEAKER_11]: And Popeye and, like, all that good stuff.

326
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:18,158
[SPEAKER_11]: And their Bimani was really well-stacked.

327
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:21,659
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, that's the only place in America I know that has a linked Pot of Pot at second mix.

328
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:29,122
[SPEAKER_11]: I was blown away, and, uh, it was actually just nice to get out there and just see how Bimani's just really, uh, you know, blown up it.

329
00:24:29,142 --> 00:24:31,483
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in, like, the smallest-looking cranny of America.

330
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:37,263
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of noticed this might be starting to be a trend here, because I know I was reading another story.

331
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:40,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Another freestyler went out to, I think, New York or something to help run a tournament lately.

332
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:42,404
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that was 8Ball or somebody.

333
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:42,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Was it?

334
00:24:43,405 --> 00:24:43,885
[SPEAKER_16]: Baltimore.

335
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:50,627
[SPEAKER_07]: 8Ball did go out to a tournament in, I believe it was Baltimore, Maryland, but he was actually judging it, from what I understand.

336
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:59,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you think this is an interesting trend that seems to be developing, where people from the West Coast are kind of running all over the nation to be competing and judging and running tournaments, or...?

337
00:25:02,341 --> 00:25:03,061
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a plague.

338
00:25:04,642 --> 00:25:17,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I think it's just really a matter of promoting Vimani in general because they know Californians, you know, we've been out here since the beginning and a lot of us are, you know, well-known just throughout the community and they think drawing in the name will draw those hardcore fans to come out there.

339
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:22,551
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said, people like that girl from New York, Jen, she came out here twice and twice she's placed.

340
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:29,635
[SPEAKER_11]: So it shows that people want to come out here or, you know, go out there because, you know, they love the game and they just want to get out there against the best.

341
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you guys think it's ever feasible?

342
00:25:32,673 --> 00:25:38,276
[SPEAKER_16]: I know this is kind of one of those topics that's one of those like on the popular message boards comes up probably once a month or whatever.

343
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:42,138
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you guys think it's feasible to one day have like a national DDR tournament?

344
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:43,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, anything's feasible.

345
00:25:43,988 --> 00:25:47,169
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a matter of actually putting in some manpower and a lot of money behind it.

346
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,011
[SPEAKER_11]: But if they really want it, it can happen.

347
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:58,235
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's enough educated people out there who can judge a freestyle or set up some kind of almost foolproof rules for PA.

348
00:25:58,436 --> 00:25:59,696
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very feasible.

349
00:25:59,736 --> 00:26:02,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I think people just have to have the money more than anything.

350
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,120
[SPEAKER_16]: Right on.

351
00:26:04,841 --> 00:26:05,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Where would you like to see that held?

352
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:13,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Because personally, I'd be rooting for Vegas, because just Vegas rules, and they've got tons of stuff to do there, but of course, if you're under 21, it kind of sucks.

353
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:17,972
[SPEAKER_09]: You know where I actually had a good crowd, believe it or not, is actually in Gulfport, Mississippi.

354
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:26,839
[SPEAKER_09]: They have pretty large arcade facilities and some of the casinos there, and of course, you don't have to be over 18 to get into the arcades there.

355
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of space, too, and a really good crowd.

356
00:26:31,481 --> 00:26:33,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Anybody else got any questions or anything?

357
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:35,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Did everybody run away to go play Sixth Style or what's going on?

358
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:37,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Seems like there's a mystery.

359
00:26:37,283 --> 00:26:39,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Anybody else got any questions, things to say?

360
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:39,723
[SPEAKER_16]: No?

361
00:26:40,944 --> 00:26:44,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Paul's like, you got Sixth Style?

362
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,125
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it's in the other room.

363
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:48,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Go, play.

364
00:26:48,686 --> 00:26:53,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, where else do you think we'd be able to hold a good tourney?

365
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:58,937
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Vegas is probably the most popular choice.

366
00:26:58,977 --> 00:27:03,099
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say LA would probably be your next big choice because everyone loves California.

367
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:04,219
[SPEAKER_11]: E3 is out there.

368
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously that's like the entertainment mecca.

369
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,822
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would think pretty much your main metropolitans, LA, New York, Chicago would be your top three choices.

370
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:13,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Seattle would be pretty cool too.

371
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:21,209
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree, and Seattle's got a lot of really good Perfect Attack players there too, and they'd be able to probably come up with a really good system, I think, for PA as well.

372
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,171
[SPEAKER_16]: Reading some stuff that they did for a recent tournament of theirs sounds like it could be fun.

373
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:32,873
[SPEAKER_16]: It almost sounded like a game show, the way they had it laid out, where people are taking off songs and putting them back on, and all they needed to do was have a trivia challenge.

374
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:34,294
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I think would be awesome?

375
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,570
[SPEAKER_16]: No, they don't vote people out.

376
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:42,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Is to rent a small stadium, like a baseball-type stadium, and get up a big monitor.

377
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you think they could seriously fill one of those?

378
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:47,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm not saying a large one.

379
00:27:48,097 --> 00:27:50,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a minor league stadium.

380
00:27:50,498 --> 00:27:57,562
[SPEAKER_09]: If we had a tourney that was a national event, that would probably be the prime way to do it, would be to have the machines out there and have a large monitor.

381
00:27:58,963 --> 00:28:08,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, from some of the footage I've seen in Japan back in 98 or 99, some of their major tournaments were actually held inside amphitheaters, inside concert halls, that kind of thing.

382
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:12,107
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an actual stage, there were spotlights everywhere, it was a big production.

383
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:16,888
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a few videos of that, and it looks like a really happening thing.

384
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:21,089
[SPEAKER_09]: It's certainly being tucked away in the corner of an arcade.

385
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:26,951
[SPEAKER_16]: What if a place like Great America, Paramount's, I'm thinking Paramount's Great America, because when I see that there's this...

386
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:37,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Some videos that go around the net that happen to be Pump It Up, but when I see those videos, I'm kind of reminded it looks like an atmosphere where it's kind of like Great America's little amphitheater, which is, you know, it's a fairly good size, but it's not huge.

387
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:42,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, part of that, you know, is also the organization of the tournaments.

388
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:44,524
[SPEAKER_11]: From what I learned from a friend who's in Korea...

389
00:28:44,964 --> 00:29:05,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Pump It Up is actually, like, not just an arcade phenomenon, it's actually things where, like, YMCAs would actually have Pump It Up teams, and, like, my friend, he actually had a Pump It Up teacher that he went to, taught him all this stuff, so, like, they had these factions from different parts of town, they go to these huge events, and that's, and really, a lot of it's not even a contest, it's just an exhibition of people showing off what they can do on different songs.

390
00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:07,939
[SPEAKER_11]: That's part of what DDR is going to need.

391
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:19,723
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to need almost like backing from other companies or like little factions that have the means to, you know, get publicity, to get money and so forth to have these huge events out of Great America, you know, the amphitheater or wherever.

392
00:29:20,856 --> 00:29:22,677
[SPEAKER_09]: What would you think of an exhibition-style tournament?

393
00:29:23,757 --> 00:29:27,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just to have like an invitational exhibition-style tourney.

394
00:29:28,378 --> 00:29:29,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I think it would be great.

395
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:39,761
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's gotten to the point where prizes are great and all, but really what it boils down to is you could really weed out the people who really love the freestyle and just love the crowds.

396
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:42,782
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be just cool to have an exhibition go out there and just do this.

397
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you know, we're doing it for fun.

398
00:29:43,942 --> 00:29:44,922
[SPEAKER_11]: We ain't doing it for prizes.

399
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:46,523
[SPEAKER_11]: We just, you know, want to entertain.

400
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:51,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I was also thinking, you know, what about like a, you know how they have the People's Choice Awards?

401
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,974
[SPEAKER_09]: What about a People's Choice style tournament?

402
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:55,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Have crowd voting.

403
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I know 8-Ball wouldn't win.

404
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:01,323
[SPEAKER_09]: That was wrong.

405
00:30:02,964 --> 00:30:05,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, um... The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio?

406
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:11,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know me, I mean, I'm all about the dirt and all that kind of stuff.

407
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:13,391
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't hear it from me, you're going to hear it from someone else.

408
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:14,831
[SPEAKER_11]: But I got love for me.

409
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:19,014
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you know, from a competitive standpoint, I want to kick everyone's ass, everyone's an enemy.

410
00:30:19,054 --> 00:30:23,757
[SPEAKER_11]: But afterwards, hey, we'll knock down a beer and, you know, we'll let you gloat about what you did ten years ago, but hey.

411
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:24,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

412
00:30:27,955 --> 00:30:31,057
[SPEAKER_16]: And you kind of have this gasp look of surprise on your face.

413
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:32,098
[SPEAKER_16]: Molly, anything you want to add?

414
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:33,899
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't surprise.

415
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:37,641
[SPEAKER_07]: That was agreement, Sam.

416
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:40,603
[SPEAKER_09]: We won't bring up the event from last night.

417
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Inside jokes here tonight.

418
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:47,859
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you have something you wanted to say, Matt?

419
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,620
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought I saw your hand like halfway up in the air.

420
00:30:51,262 --> 00:30:57,967
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to say I was reading on the DDR East Coast Invasion boards that J-Dog went to help a tournament in Florida at some point.

421
00:30:59,128 --> 00:30:59,809
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe.

422
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:05,153
[SPEAKER_15]: It was someone from the DDR Free boards that I recognized that went to Florida to help a tournament.

423
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:07,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't hear about a Florida tournament.

424
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:10,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't keep tight taps on everyone, but I wouldn't be surprised.

425
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:12,802
[SPEAKER_11]: J-Dog's a pretty big man in demand.

426
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:15,285
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Florida or Atlanta, I can't remember.

427
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:18,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if it comes to Atlanta, usually it's Inawan.

428
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,955
[SPEAKER_11]: He ran a tournament in Atlanta about a year or two ago when he was actually living there.

429
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, all I know is they just, they love him over in the East Coast.

430
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:33,416
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's like, trying to get them to listen to the show and plug in, but... I guess that's a good question.

431
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,957
[SPEAKER_16]: How do you feel about fanboys and fangirls?

432
00:31:36,918 --> 00:31:42,381
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, because DDR, it's like, you know, you're bound to get some fans to download your videos online.

433
00:31:42,421 --> 00:31:46,924
[SPEAKER_16]: You're a fairly well-known freestyler and stuff, and people kind of, like, start to get to know you.

434
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Or, you know, want to know more about you and what have you.

435
00:31:49,746 --> 00:31:50,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you think that's kind of weird?

436
00:31:51,227 --> 00:31:53,508
[SPEAKER_16]: for being a fan over DDR?

437
00:31:53,848 --> 00:31:55,629
[SPEAKER_16]: How do you feel about the whole phenomenon?

438
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:59,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I think everyone's a fanboy or a fangirl of someone that they love.

439
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:09,274
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know, jeez, if I were to meet, like, Weird Al, like, up close, five feet away from me, I'd be all, you know, be like, Oh my gosh, that's how to... You go, boy, with your best self.

440
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:12,977
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, but it's, you know, to each their own.

441
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's just, you know, a sign of appreciation.

442
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,381
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if they appreciate my dance, hey, I'm all for it.

443
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:19,223
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, who would have thunk that?

444
00:32:19,643 --> 00:32:21,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Just getting up and doing something I do just for fun.

445
00:32:21,925 --> 00:32:23,206
[SPEAKER_11]: People would download me.

446
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:24,347
[SPEAKER_11]: They'd try to copy my style.

447
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:26,029
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to find out where I did stuff.

448
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,392
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, you know, they say flattery is honesty and all that.

449
00:32:29,412 --> 00:32:31,093
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the truest form of whatever.

450
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:31,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, ha.

451
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:34,836
[SPEAKER_16]: Imitation is the finest form of flattery, right?

452
00:32:35,516 --> 00:32:36,396
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what you're here for.

453
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:37,277
[SPEAKER_11]: You're there to correct me.

454
00:32:37,937 --> 00:32:40,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I ever tell you about what happened when I was in Mississippi?

455
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

456
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,841
[SPEAKER_09]: I showed up late for the tourney because I was going to be in it.

457
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:51,965
[SPEAKER_09]: The question I got was, when I told people who I was, they were like, Oh my God, you're DarkSakura?

458
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:52,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, do you know Mel B?

459
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:54,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

460
00:32:54,746 --> 00:32:56,087
[SPEAKER_09]: That is truly what I got.

461
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:58,088
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other question is, do you still have the bat?

462
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the bat from Miggle 2, wow.

463
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:05,373
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, just a quick on the fanboys and fangirls.

464
00:33:05,413 --> 00:33:10,355
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the only time it really hit me was when I was in Canada, of all places.

465
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:15,517
[SPEAKER_11]: I was in Vancouver visiting a friend, and then some guy actually recognized me from my Santa Monica video.

466
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:15,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like...

467
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:18,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoa, out there?

468
00:33:18,923 --> 00:33:25,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I gotta admit, it's kind of weird, but at the same time, hey, I got nothing but love for everyone who's got love back.

469
00:33:25,448 --> 00:33:28,371
[SPEAKER_11]: For me, it's all about the game, but if they like me, hey, it's all good.

470
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:30,112
[SPEAKER_11]: They like you, they really like you.

471
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:35,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess they're not asking me for my PIN number for my ATM card, hey, it's all too good.

472
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:43,061
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess my next question would be for Melody, because it's no secret, she doesn't mind me saying, Melody, Mel B, and Idom here, right?

473
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it's okay to say on the show, yeah, duh, okay, just making sure.

474
00:33:46,162 --> 00:33:48,883
[SPEAKER_11]: If you kill all the jokes about Mel and Mel, oh my god, they're the same.

475
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:50,724
[SPEAKER_11]: We've heard them millions of times.

476
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:55,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Some people don't like that stuff coming out on air, but no secret.

477
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:58,307
[SPEAKER_16]: So how do you feel about the Mel B fanboys and fangirls?

478
00:33:59,142 --> 00:34:01,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be rather on the interesting side.

479
00:34:01,546 --> 00:34:06,092
[SPEAKER_07]: As Mel just sits there saying, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

480
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:09,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we want to hear the funny, embarrassing stories because that's what radio's for.

481
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:11,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny, embarrassing story.

482
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,783
[SPEAKER_16]: No, just say it.

483
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:13,744
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's us.

484
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:15,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't fanboys or fangirls.

485
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:20,648
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of something you just have to learn to deal with.

486
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:30,713
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be hard, but it's kind of something I'm starting to come to terms with that he's going to be out there and that it really is a form of flattery.

487
00:34:30,754 --> 00:34:34,115
[SPEAKER_07]: People really like him, but as long as they keep their hands off of him, I'm happy.

488
00:34:34,135 --> 00:34:36,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's mine.

489
00:34:37,614 --> 00:34:39,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Noah, she loves the fanboys, hates the fangirls.

490
00:34:42,284 --> 00:35:03,254
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, just a quick funny fanboy story, though, was I remember Drags 1, that was when I did my After the Game of Love routine, and I was kind of pimped out in the zebra hat and the feather bow and all that, and at one point my feather bow sort of came apart, and there was a feather that flew around, there was this one team, at the time they were Team Epsilon, I think, and one guy said, oh my god, this feather's cool, can I keep it?

491
00:35:03,274 --> 00:35:04,294
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, well, okay, sure.

492
00:35:04,694 --> 00:35:07,776
[SPEAKER_11]: I see him at a tournament about eight months later, he pulled the AI-3,

493
00:35:08,636 --> 00:35:10,377
[SPEAKER_11]: He comes up to me, hey man, I remember you from Drags.

494
00:35:10,397 --> 00:35:11,057
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, oh yeah.

495
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:15,440
[SPEAKER_11]: And he busts out his wallet, pulls out that feather from the boy, he says he keeps it for good luck.

496
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,580
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, ooh.

497
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:22,823
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when I came to realize, you know, it's something I gotta deal with, you know, and I'm actually all happy about it, hey.

498
00:35:23,504 --> 00:35:23,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Celebrity.

499
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:28,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you know, I mean, some people like the spotlight, some people hate it.

500
00:35:28,887 --> 00:35:30,207
[SPEAKER_11]: I can embrace it, no problem.

501
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:33,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you think it's odd at all that DDR is something that kind of creates celebrities?

502
00:35:35,797 --> 00:35:38,498
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen Stranger Things create celebrities.

503
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:42,720
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess if you can be a celebrity through Star Trek or Survivor.

504
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:48,322
[SPEAKER_09]: So who are you going to take the sponsorship from, Pepsi or Coke?

505
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have to go with Pepsi.

506
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:52,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

507
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:55,125
[SPEAKER_09]: So Pepsi, give him a contract.

508
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:58,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Ask another real quick question.

509
00:35:58,798 --> 00:36:06,123
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think was the most... Because you go to a lot of tournaments all around California, and now even some outside of California, too.

510
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:08,205
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got the UK tournament going in October.

511
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:10,006
[SPEAKER_11]: You're definitely going to that, huh?

512
00:36:10,046 --> 00:36:11,127
[SPEAKER_11]: King of Styles 3, yes.

513
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:11,727
[SPEAKER_16]: Right on.

514
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:21,014
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think to date has been the most... I guess I wouldn't say the best or worst tournament, because that's too hard to judge, but maybe the most fun tournament that you went to?

515
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:23,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Most fun tournament?

516
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:25,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have to say...

517
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:31,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably... I'm going back.

518
00:36:31,794 --> 00:36:34,895
[SPEAKER_11]: I think probably the most fun tournament was the first ever Metreon tournament.

519
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:37,956
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, yeah, about August of 2000.

520
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:41,238
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when, like, NorCal's... That was really their first major get-together.

521
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:43,138
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when Metreon was holding it.

522
00:36:43,178 --> 00:36:44,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Pepsi was sponsoring.

523
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:45,739
[SPEAKER_11]: KOA was doing their thing.

524
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's, you know, when I was in freestyle.

525
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:52,182
[SPEAKER_11]: There were, like, two tiebreakers I had to go... There were two tiebreakers in freestyle.

526
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:55,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, one I had to go against Mike No for first place.

527
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:56,104
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we...

528
00:36:56,864 --> 00:36:57,665
[SPEAKER_11]: both went at it.

529
00:36:57,685 --> 00:37:00,106
[SPEAKER_11]: We had to go through improv, we had to go through routine.

530
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:06,290
[SPEAKER_11]: They had to pull almost every tiebreaker in the book, but it was just a lot of fun afterwards.

531
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Because everyone out there, it was back before drama really existed and all that.

532
00:37:10,472 --> 00:37:15,155
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was a sign of times when we were all still bonded together by this whole DDR thing.

533
00:37:15,175 --> 00:37:18,577
[SPEAKER_11]: We were all together before our personal lives sort of took over.

534
00:37:20,017 --> 00:37:22,419
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess this is going to be an odd question, but was DDR better then?

535
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's not so much it was better, it was just the fascination was still there.

536
00:37:28,931 --> 00:37:50,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the time, we had 1.5, not a lot of us had third mix or any other mix to compare and yearn for, but nowadays it's like once DDR comes out, we like it for a few days, then we're like, well damn, we want something more, because we realize how fun DDR can be, and it's usually hard to recreate that first genuine pure love you had for that feeling.

537
00:37:51,022 --> 00:37:51,983
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you know, crack.

538
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:56,388
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you get the first hit, all you're trying to do is you're trying to replicate that feeling of the first time.

539
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:57,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It never quite happens.

540
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge does not endorse drug.

541
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:02,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

542
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:05,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything, anybody else want to add anything, or...

543
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:07,400
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's probably about time we go to a break.

544
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,261
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been on for about a half hour straight, if not more.

545
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:10,802
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to go ahead and go to a break.

546
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,824
[SPEAKER_16]: They were playing Sick Style in the other room.

547
00:38:13,264 --> 00:38:17,087
[SPEAKER_16]: And they were playing Changes, I don't know why, one of the new songs.

548
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:20,709
[SPEAKER_16]: But when we come back, we're going to talk about Sick Style.

549
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:23,832
[SPEAKER_16]: So anybody else want to leave us with any thoughts while I queue up some songs?

550
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:26,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Think.

551
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:27,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Think.

552
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:30,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember to stay on the pill, because I won't hurt you, but the next man will.

553
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:33,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Wiser words were never said.

554
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:47,404
Friend Fortress, Thunderstorms

555
00:43:46,078 --> 00:43:48,459
[SPEAKER_16]: I apologize for cutting off the last song there.

556
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:52,440
[SPEAKER_16]: We were trying to listen to The Outer Limits and I made a technical boo-boo and it got cut off.

557
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,360
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

558
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob pooped on the machine.

559
00:43:54,781 --> 00:43:59,942
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll give you another LED track from New to Six style and maybe we'll get back to Outer Limits a little later.

560
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:01,363
[SPEAKER_16]: So my apologies.

561
00:45:55,857 --> 00:45:59,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

562
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

563
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:02,322
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

564
00:46:04,684 --> 00:46:06,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we care what people think of us?

565
00:46:06,645 --> 00:46:08,507
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

566
00:46:08,527 --> 00:46:09,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

567
00:46:10,408 --> 00:46:13,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes!

568
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:19,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

569
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:34,724
[SPEAKER_16]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and in that last set we had a couple of the new tracks from the Six Style home version which is kind of the biggest news in the Bomani scene this week is that Six Style was released in Japan and so of course all the fans of 2DX are importing it here.

570
00:46:34,924 --> 00:46:35,584
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty.

571
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:36,804
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's cool.

572
00:46:36,824 --> 00:46:41,506
[SPEAKER_16]: We were going to talk about it last week but unfortunately none of us got our copy in time but we have them this week.

573
00:46:41,606 --> 00:46:42,187
[SPEAKER_16]: I got mine.

574
00:46:42,207 --> 00:46:43,307
[SPEAKER_16]: I slept through mine.

575
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:48,330
[SPEAKER_16]: I finally caved and bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 this week just so I could have Six Style.

576
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,211
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it's out in the other room right now and there's people playing it.

577
00:46:51,732 --> 00:46:52,192
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think?

578
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:53,273
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you guys think of Six Style?

579
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:54,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we like it?

580
00:46:55,714 --> 00:46:58,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo!

581
00:46:58,336 --> 00:47:00,097
[SPEAKER_16]: God, you people are dead this week.

582
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:02,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Go play it.

583
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:03,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Go in there and play it.

584
00:47:03,378 --> 00:47:05,240
[SPEAKER_09]: If you haven't played it, go in there and play it.

585
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,782
[SPEAKER_09]: And for, you know, just come on, everybody who's listening, come on over to Rob's and play it in the other room.

586
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:10,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't keep the address out, that's all I ask.

587
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:23,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think probably the best thing about Sixth Hour is for the simple fact that every 2DX machine out here that I know of has a really stupid, freaking unreadable screen, and now you can go home and the movies actually work.

588
00:47:23,725 --> 00:47:24,925
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, wow.

589
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:28,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Who knew that the video for Wow Wow 70s was so fucking cool, huh?

590
00:47:28,347 --> 00:47:28,927
[SPEAKER_09]: That is awesome.

591
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:38,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, don't forget about Bearcade, though, because Bearcade does have probably the best quality machine now in California, except for maybe AI that I've played.

592
00:47:38,211 --> 00:47:38,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

593
00:47:39,131 --> 00:47:43,574
[SPEAKER_11]: AI screen is not that great because now the blue and white keys all look green.

594
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:46,636
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not bad, but not stellar.

595
00:47:47,057 --> 00:47:51,860
[SPEAKER_09]: The only time I ever played that one was November last year, and I think that was right after it had been replaced.

596
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:59,785
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't been to AI in a while, but just as long... SHGL's old machine was by far the weirdest one I ever had to play on.

597
00:48:00,366 --> 00:48:06,410
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never seen people just quit in the middle of a game because they got so sick of trying to read the screens.

598
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:12,111
[SPEAKER_09]: I usually like to get my whole money's worth when I play 2DX and I did walk away from the machine when I was there last November.

599
00:48:12,531 --> 00:48:19,693
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only machine that I ever had such a bad case of vertigo playing because the sides of the screen were burned out in a circle.

600
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:21,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I had tunnel vision the whole time.

601
00:48:21,453 --> 00:48:23,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Now does any 2DX machine in the U.S.

602
00:48:23,474 --> 00:48:29,095
[SPEAKER_16]: have working videos or is this the first time a lot of us get to see these videos unless we downloaded them online somewhere?

603
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:33,298
[SPEAKER_11]: For SixStyle, the only time I ever saw working veils was temporarily.

604
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:37,201
[SPEAKER_11]: They did work at AI, but anywhere else I did not see them going.

605
00:48:37,562 --> 00:48:37,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.

606
00:48:39,203 --> 00:48:43,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other cool videos you want to point out that people should check out if they get to play this?

607
00:48:43,386 --> 00:48:43,967
[SPEAKER_09]: On SixStyle?

608
00:48:44,227 --> 00:48:52,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, seeing as how I've only ever played it here at Iguana Girl's house, I think it's one of the Eurobeat ones.

609
00:48:52,293 --> 00:48:53,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Linus, Mel B says Linus.

610
00:48:54,154 --> 00:48:59,478
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the Eurobeat ones had the bunny from Keyboard Mania.

611
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:03,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember playing it and absolutely failing it on 7-key.

612
00:49:04,222 --> 00:49:07,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And then stopping right in the middle of playing, look over, oh my god, is that the rabbit?

613
00:49:08,425 --> 00:49:09,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like that.

614
00:49:09,806 --> 00:49:12,888
[SPEAKER_09]: And it distracted me worse than the evil Satan fetus from 250 BPM.

615
00:49:17,196 --> 00:49:19,438
[SPEAKER_15]: G2 also has a really awesome video too.

616
00:49:19,478 --> 00:49:20,799
[SPEAKER_15]: That video scares me.

617
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:24,542
[SPEAKER_16]: It's got like trans-circa aliens or something.

618
00:49:24,622 --> 00:49:26,103
[SPEAKER_16]: It's weird stuff.

619
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:28,385
[SPEAKER_16]: You expect to see her floating in a glass jar or something.

620
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:29,105
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pretty scary.

621
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:32,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say, as always, the Orange Lounge videos are the best.

622
00:49:32,588 --> 00:49:32,928
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree.

623
00:49:33,228 --> 00:49:39,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, did you notice for about a half second in the Wow Wow 70s video, there's a shot of the two girls from the Mobile Moga video with afros?

624
00:49:39,633 --> 00:49:39,873
[SPEAKER_09]: I was...

625
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,014
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing that really distracted me was the building with the fro.

626
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:49,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, is going to be replacing my Pocari Sweat icon on my live channel.

627
00:49:49,922 --> 00:49:50,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Right on.

628
00:49:51,384 --> 00:49:52,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, Bradley, you're a big 2DX fan.

629
00:49:52,986 --> 00:49:54,749
[SPEAKER_16]: You got any videos that people should be checking out?

630
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:55,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, not so far.

631
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:57,853
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been playing too much to actually watch the videos yet.

632
00:49:58,534 --> 00:49:58,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds good.

633
00:49:58,974 --> 00:50:03,618
[SPEAKER_09]: You know which one I actually just like to sit on my computer monitor and just sit in the background and just watch?

634
00:50:03,678 --> 00:50:04,980
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the one for colors, honestly.

635
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's just so pretty and trancy.

636
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:08,863
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's colorful.

637
00:50:09,544 --> 00:50:10,905
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me happy.

638
00:50:11,305 --> 00:50:13,087
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me the color of blue.

639
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:16,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was a fool to let you walk away.

640
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:16,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait.

641
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:23,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Another neat thing about SixStyle is it has new movie mode, or movie clip mode, where you can watch the videos full screen.

642
00:50:23,913 --> 00:50:27,516
[SPEAKER_17]: It's nice, you can put it on autoplay and then just watch the video screen with no notes or anything.

643
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:29,378
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty awesome.

644
00:50:29,578 --> 00:50:36,324
[SPEAKER_17]: And a good idea, an idea for anyone who has it, you can do is you can set up a course and make it autoplay and it just goes through all the videos.

645
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:38,967
[SPEAKER_17]: You can just watch like ten videos in a row if you want to.

646
00:50:39,841 --> 00:50:40,442
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that's pretty cool.

647
00:50:40,722 --> 00:50:44,285
[SPEAKER_16]: And actually, it's a good way to hear the anothers, too, because you can just autoplay the anothers.

648
00:50:44,325 --> 00:50:52,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, that's how I heard the Something Wonderful another, because I just beat Something Wonderful on a 7-key for the first time, so I'm not quite ready to tackle the another yet.

649
00:50:52,673 --> 00:50:56,676
[SPEAKER_16]: But since the another now has vocals, I really wanted to hear it, so I played it in full-screen mode.

650
00:50:56,696 --> 00:51:03,122
[SPEAKER_16]: But I have to say, music clip mode scared the hell out of me the first time, because I ran it with Jelly Kiss, and it was like, oh my god, Santa's taking over my screen.

651
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:04,003
[SPEAKER_16]: It's crazy.

652
00:51:04,023 --> 00:51:05,324
[SPEAKER_16]: You got something you want to add?

653
00:51:05,504 --> 00:51:13,407
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, just seeing those videos of, like, the guys playing all the stuff one-handed, it's gotta be the most demoralizing bit of footage you could ever watch for 2DX.

654
00:51:14,628 --> 00:51:18,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Those videos just scream, Americans suck at 2DX.

655
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:22,511
[SPEAKER_09]: For the people who don't know what Tetsujin means, it means Iron Man.

656
00:51:22,771 --> 00:51:24,051
[SPEAKER_09]: It's named that for a reason.

657
00:51:25,072 --> 00:51:27,913
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, those are some absolutely fantastic players.

658
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:32,463
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like, is that trying to spin off on Iron Chef, like Iron 2DX?

659
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:36,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it's like Tekken for 2DX.

660
00:51:37,305 --> 00:51:38,806
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the king of iron fingering.

661
00:51:39,987 --> 00:51:40,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Whoa!

662
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:44,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind, I said another... Remember that part about adult content?

663
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:51,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I was referring to this in a completely innocent manner, you pervert.

664
00:51:52,825 --> 00:51:55,246
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we know what our last week on Orange Lounge clip will be.

665
00:51:57,606 --> 00:51:58,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you can bite me now.

666
00:52:00,527 --> 00:52:05,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go sit back in my chair the rest of the night, let people deliver me donuts and vanilla Coke.

667
00:52:05,168 --> 00:52:06,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Look at this setup we have here.

668
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:09,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie's kind of sitting in her throne here, the big blue chair.

669
00:52:09,148 --> 00:52:10,769
[SPEAKER_09]: The rest of us are all sitting on the floor around her.

670
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:11,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I offered the chair.

671
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:14,009
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair is mine.

672
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:15,050
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair is rightfully yours.

673
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,310
[SPEAKER_09]: I am the Vicodin Goddess.

674
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:17,930
[SPEAKER_16]: The Vicodin Goddess?

675
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:18,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

676
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,851
[SPEAKER_16]: And what makes you the Vicodin Goddess?

677
00:52:19,871 --> 00:52:20,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm well-medicated.

678
00:52:22,511 --> 00:52:24,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to medicate myself to do the show.

679
00:52:24,452 --> 00:52:31,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you under sedation?

680
00:52:31,255 --> 00:52:31,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me that.

681
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:36,017
[SPEAKER_15]: SoCalKicks is saying, let us remind you, were you moist yesterday?

682
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Or last week?

683
00:52:37,578 --> 00:52:40,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, you still haven't sent me my proof that you passed my edit.

684
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,221
[SPEAKER_09]: No GameCube pen for you.

685
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:44,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice question dodge there.

686
00:52:46,042 --> 00:52:57,748
[SPEAKER_09]: When you send me the proof that you have passed my edit with a 90% perfect attack and full combo, then I will be nice to you and send you your GameCube pen, maybe if you retract your question.

687
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:00,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

688
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:01,690
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

689
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,091
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see what he has to respond to that.

690
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:12,176
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime, let's break from six-style chatter for a minute, and let's let Matt, also known as Loki, give us an update on what's going on in the simulation scene, because there's a lot of news this week.

691
00:53:12,576 --> 00:53:14,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week, he drowned his students at the pool.

692
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:22,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, actually I do that very often.

693
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:24,145
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just very fun to kill them off.

694
00:53:24,466 --> 00:53:25,868
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyway, I have an update.

695
00:53:25,948 --> 00:53:27,711
[SPEAKER_15]: SoCalKicks has retracted the question.

696
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:29,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you can have your pen, send me proof.

697
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:43,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, in the sim world, boards are still down, still have Team Guilo down, still have the Melting Pot down, and also the actual DWI official board down, but there's a bunch of mirrors out there.

698
00:53:44,211 --> 00:53:54,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Really no updates as far as programs go, there was a small update to Dance With Intensity 2.0, it's now 2.003, which I haven't really seen any changes.

699
00:53:54,993 --> 00:53:58,554
[SPEAKER_15]: The video still doesn't work in the background for me, so that kind of sucks, I'm very disappointed.

700
00:53:59,895 --> 00:54:07,222
[SPEAKER_15]: One major news thing is actually going to be with DDR East Coast Invasion or their website ddrei.com.

701
00:54:07,563 --> 00:54:11,487
[SPEAKER_15]: They're having their second DWI Tourney Mix 2.

702
00:54:12,368 --> 00:54:15,251
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be running for the whole month of August.

703
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:18,432
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's actually a few different things you can enter in.

704
00:54:18,452 --> 00:54:22,854
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to have a light, standard, and heavy entries you can do.

705
00:54:22,974 --> 00:54:26,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Light is for people that are just getting into making DWIs.

706
00:54:26,195 --> 00:54:31,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Standard is, you know, basic, you know, anyone that's kind of seasoned doing DWIs.

707
00:54:32,057 --> 00:54:35,759
[SPEAKER_15]: And then heavy is just for the elite, which I'll be entering in because, you know.

708
00:54:37,353 --> 00:54:38,534
[SPEAKER_09]: No one has the ego here.

709
00:54:38,554 --> 00:54:40,596
[SPEAKER_15]: You doubles know.

710
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:03,658
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually thinking about entering one of these edit contests just because I'm pretty bored.

711
00:55:04,118 --> 00:55:07,119
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, hell, we got this show off the ground.

712
00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:10,000
[SPEAKER_16]: What's that say about free time?

713
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,940
[SPEAKER_09]: No life plus no talent gets you a talk show.

714
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did rip that line from Space Coast Coast to Coast, thank you.

715
00:55:17,342 --> 00:55:25,044
[SPEAKER_16]: It's being said in the chat room, Pyroman is saying, hey, rumor here that Stepmania Beta 5 out very soon, possibly tomorrow.

716
00:55:25,704 --> 00:55:26,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you heard anything about that?

717
00:55:27,685 --> 00:55:30,606
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I haven't, but hopefully it'll work a little bit better this time.

718
00:55:30,946 --> 00:55:36,267
[SPEAKER_15]: See, the only thing that I like about Step Mania is it's got a lot of nifty, shiny stuff in it.

719
00:55:36,307 --> 00:55:40,408
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, they have the new features as far as, like, modifiers you can use, songs.

720
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:47,149
[SPEAKER_15]: But the thing I really hate about it is, because I have a huge song collection, it takes forever to load the damn thing up.

721
00:55:47,629 --> 00:55:51,910
[SPEAKER_15]: I can sit there for about five minutes watching the thing scroll by because it's reading all my songs.

722
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:53,370
[SPEAKER_15]: and it just takes forever.

723
00:55:53,490 --> 00:56:06,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas, like, you know, back in the days with even, um, Delight Delight Reduplication, one of the old simulators, what it does is it scans, you scan your music list and it'll build a list and that way it loads instantly every time.

724
00:56:06,535 --> 00:56:07,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Same with, uh, DWIs.

725
00:56:08,136 --> 00:56:08,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Same thing.

726
00:56:09,356 --> 00:56:13,838
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, Step Mania is kind of dumbed it down where it scans your music list every time.

727
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:14,918
[SPEAKER_15]: So it takes forever.

728
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:20,641
[SPEAKER_15]: So if they just fix that, then maybe, you know, I might go over to Step Mania, but I'm sticking with DWI for now.

729
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:25,582
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I was going to ask our guests some questions, but they ran in the other room to go play Six Style.

730
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,763
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's all on the simulation front then for now?

731
00:56:29,064 --> 00:56:30,744
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it until all the boards come back up.

732
00:56:30,784 --> 00:56:41,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully they won't have any more bandwidth issues with Team Guilo, because I love reading that board for the news, and then when that goes down, so does the Melting Pot and DWI.

733
00:56:42,728 --> 00:56:44,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul, you've been awfully quiet all night.

734
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:44,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have anything you want to add?

735
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:54,252
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been out of town this week, so I'd just like to tell anyone who goes through the Santa Cruz Boardwalk to not go to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, because the arcade in there is pretty bad.

736
00:56:55,253 --> 00:56:58,194
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing there for Nostalgia is Beatmania Complete Mix.

737
00:56:58,254 --> 00:57:01,737
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of fun to play for Metal Gear Solid, the remix there.

738
00:57:02,157 --> 00:57:04,098
[SPEAKER_18]: And then they do have Percussion Freaks, but no chair.

739
00:57:04,918 --> 00:57:10,542
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you want to play Percussion Freaks 4th Mix with no chair, standing up, you'll get real sore, but you'll have fun.

740
00:57:11,342 --> 00:57:12,283
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of a new thing there.

741
00:57:13,021 --> 00:57:13,702
[SPEAKER_16]: I have an announcement.

742
00:57:13,942 --> 00:57:15,104
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a donut.

743
00:57:15,404 --> 00:57:16,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Donuts are good for you.

744
00:57:18,328 --> 00:57:19,189
[SPEAKER_17]: They're full of chocolate vitamins.

745
00:57:19,209 --> 00:57:19,429
[SPEAKER_17]: Seriously.

746
00:57:34,303 --> 00:57:37,745
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to take a quick break because everything is getting distracted now with 6th style.

747
00:57:37,805 --> 00:57:38,586
[SPEAKER_16]: It's top of the hour anyway.

748
00:57:38,606 --> 00:57:41,007
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to take a quick break and we will come right back.

749
00:57:41,087 --> 00:57:43,128
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to give a few plugs before we go to break though.

750
00:57:43,408 --> 00:57:43,889
[SPEAKER_16]: A few things.

751
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:48,231
[SPEAKER_16]: SoCalKicks.com is now up and running.

752
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,973
[SPEAKER_16]: SoCalKicks, he has a cool little site there.

753
00:57:51,813 --> 00:57:54,434
[SPEAKER_16]: And Jamie's edits are up there, which you can go download.

754
00:57:54,674 --> 00:57:55,354
[SPEAKER_16]: They're very cool.

755
00:57:55,654 --> 00:57:59,575
[SPEAKER_16]: And all sorts of news and things like that, especially, as is in the name, about SoCal.

756
00:57:59,595 --> 00:58:01,835
[SPEAKER_16]: So, SoCalKicks.com, you can visit that.

757
00:58:02,635 --> 00:58:07,316
[SPEAKER_16]: If you haven't heard it yet, we do have an original work by Kiel in rotation this week on the website.

758
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:09,837
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I'm sorry, on the Bimani Music & More program.

759
00:58:09,877 --> 00:58:16,358
[SPEAKER_16]: So, do listen in on the Bimani Music & More program, which runs 24 hours a day on the station when we're not live.

760
00:58:16,478 --> 00:58:19,239
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're starting to take some original works and remixes.

761
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:20,839
[SPEAKER_16]: of Bomani stuff.

762
00:58:20,899 --> 00:58:30,463
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you have anything you want to add for that, send it to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com or any comments and things you want to give on the show, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

763
00:58:31,403 --> 00:58:34,944
[SPEAKER_09]: And because I did promise, so I'd like to say hi to Ash because you said you'd be listening tonight.

764
00:58:36,285 --> 00:58:39,306
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you for helping boost us listeners in your area.

765
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:45,588
[SPEAKER_09]: And hello to everybody who's deciding to listen tonight and we really appreciate the support.

766
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,571
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, thanks everybody for listening tonight.

767
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:48,931
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

768
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:53,453
[SPEAKER_16]: And also 2DXstyle.net is up and running once again.

769
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:57,194
[SPEAKER_16]: And they've got a nice little button for us on there.

770
00:58:57,214 --> 00:58:58,015
[SPEAKER_16]: That was really awesome.

771
00:58:58,035 --> 00:58:58,955
[SPEAKER_16]: I wasn't expecting to see that.

772
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:01,116
[SPEAKER_16]: So thanks to them for supporting us.

773
00:59:01,176 --> 00:59:02,556
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll support you best we can.

774
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:04,717
[SPEAKER_16]: So do go visit their site.

775
00:59:05,118 --> 00:59:08,699
[SPEAKER_16]: They're trying to build a location page of every 2DX machine in the nation.

776
00:59:08,759 --> 00:59:11,360
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's fairly up to date from what I'm being told.

777
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,021
[SPEAKER_16]: So go take a look at that if you get a moment.

778
00:59:13,401 --> 00:59:14,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we're going to go to break.

779
00:59:14,161 --> 00:59:15,582
[SPEAKER_16]: And we will be right back.

780
00:59:35,628 --> 00:59:36,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

781
01:00:09,744 --> 01:00:10,605
Well, I'm a chemist.

782
01:00:10,765 --> 01:00:12,427
I leave the lab ready to explore.

783
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:15,391
I drop the pump for five rhymes like no one has before.

784
01:00:15,451 --> 01:00:17,474
I kick the notes and verbs in my speech when I flow.

785
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam's Moon Soapbox

786
01:01:44,192 --> 01:02:05,687
Well I'm a chemist, I'm in the lab ready to explore I drop the fuck the fat rhymes like no one has before I kick the melted verbs in my speech when I'm flubbed I'm not like a devil that sucks you for the dough or the drugs So he can teach a tribe in the veins I keep the low-pro makin' ends with my friends Free skills, oh shit, I'm flubbin' with mad styles Don't even try to step on my lyrics, I'm mad foul

787
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,563
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

788
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:44,469
Thanks for watching!

789
01:06:34,567 --> 01:06:35,316
Thanks for watching!

790
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:33,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's one of the songs that they skipped over for Parapara Paradise that was from Initial D. This is Dave Rogers running in the 90s.

791
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:35,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Parapara Paradise

792
01:08:07,202 --> 01:08:08,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

793
01:09:02,052 --> 01:09:03,193
[SPEAKER_06]: All I Wanna Get Is You

794
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:18,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your money going

795
01:12:09,717 --> 01:12:13,364
[SPEAKER_14]: The Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Balls

796
01:12:18,954 --> 01:12:22,716
[SPEAKER_16]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio live as we are.

797
01:12:22,956 --> 01:12:26,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Gosh, I'm just not being friendly with Winamp tonight, are we?

798
01:12:26,778 --> 01:12:29,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm going to shoot this thing in the head.

799
01:12:29,239 --> 01:12:31,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob is held mesmerized by our sponsor, the Swedish chef.

800
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:33,281
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

801
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:34,762
[SPEAKER_09]: We just threw a fish at him and Rob went crazy.

802
01:12:34,882 --> 01:12:40,665
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Winamp's mad at me because when I logged in today it said, upgrade me, and I said, no, I need to have a show to do.

803
01:12:40,925 --> 01:12:41,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine tells me that every day.

804
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:42,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's protesting.

805
01:12:42,365 --> 01:12:43,306
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it wants to disown me.

806
01:12:44,764 --> 01:12:58,956
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to say a big hello to everybody in the chat room right now over on irc.egheads.org or if you just download MIRC you're just going to want to connect to any other side IRC server and we're in Channel Orange Lounge.

807
01:12:59,476 --> 01:13:01,077
[SPEAKER_16]: We're joined tonight by some special guests.

808
01:13:01,238 --> 01:13:05,081
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got a whole bunch of our regulars here and also from out of town we've got Mel B and Melody.

809
01:13:05,801 --> 01:13:09,923
[SPEAKER_16]: So, everybody's kind of running in and out, though, playing Sixth Style as well.

810
01:13:10,463 --> 01:13:11,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Kind of seeing what's going on there.

811
01:13:11,623 --> 01:13:15,245
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, what do you want to talk about now, Jamie?

812
01:13:15,285 --> 01:13:17,345
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm kind of running out of things to discuss.

813
01:13:17,525 --> 01:13:23,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're thinking of having a news segment, you know, to sort of, again, focus on the and more part of our radio show.

814
01:13:24,068 --> 01:13:24,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

815
01:13:24,528 --> 01:13:32,371
[SPEAKER_09]: The weekly anime review, which, you know, I think I'm going to review something pretty old school that Mel brought up earlier today.

816
01:13:33,532 --> 01:13:35,655
[SPEAKER_09]: My review of Lupin the Third.

817
01:13:35,755 --> 01:13:36,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, more DDR2.

818
01:13:36,676 --> 01:13:37,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, hey.

819
01:13:37,897 --> 01:13:38,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Castle of Cagliostro.

820
01:13:39,559 --> 01:13:41,322
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the best anime ever.

821
01:13:42,203 --> 01:13:46,668
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I see people who are going off on, oh, Hellsing is cool, which it is.

822
01:13:47,529 --> 01:13:49,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw Hellsing for the first time last night.

823
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:51,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Hellsing owns, but we're reviewing old stuff.

824
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:52,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

825
01:13:52,947 --> 01:13:56,449
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is also another reference to old school gamers here.

826
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:06,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Who happens to remember the game Cliffhanger that sort of played like Dragon's Lair and Dragon's Lair 2 and that other sort of weird game that featured the cowboy?

827
01:14:08,797 --> 01:14:11,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember that game offhand, but it was time something.

828
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:36,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, the whole thing with Castle Cagliostro is, I don't know how many people have actually watched the Lupin TV series, which was really awesome, but basically it features him going after a crime syndicate that's been responsible for the counterfeiting for centuries, even, funding wars.

829
01:14:38,048 --> 01:14:42,931
[SPEAKER_09]: and going after, but there's also a little mystery and a little bit of romance attached to that.

830
01:14:43,051 --> 01:14:47,973
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'd recommend, it's definitely something that if you rent it once, you'll definitely want to buy it.

831
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:50,455
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, certainly for people who love old school anime.

832
01:14:51,675 --> 01:14:53,376
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's Miyazaki, right?

833
01:14:53,596 --> 01:14:55,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it was directed by Miyazaki.

834
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:57,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't go wrong with Miyazaki.

835
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:05,105
[SPEAKER_09]: And Miyazaki, for people who don't know him by name, is the man behind Studio Ghibli.

836
01:15:06,206 --> 01:15:14,092
[SPEAKER_09]: As in Princess Mononoke, Laputa, Nazca, that's another one too.

837
01:15:14,152 --> 01:15:17,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, and even before that, that was Monkey Punch, right?

838
01:15:17,885 --> 01:15:19,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Monkey Punch is responsible for Lupin.

839
01:15:19,727 --> 01:15:21,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was before he went to Studio Ghibli?

840
01:15:22,168 --> 01:15:23,049
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

841
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:30,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Monkey Punch is the one who did the Lupin comics, who created the character, and also, of course, was responsible for the early animation.

842
01:15:31,435 --> 01:15:35,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Castle Cagliostro was actually directed by Miyazaki.

843
01:15:35,498 --> 01:15:38,400
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, you know, more of my useless anime trivia.

844
01:15:39,321 --> 01:15:39,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, it's cool.

845
01:15:40,862 --> 01:15:42,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's another one of my mutant powers.

846
01:15:42,423 --> 01:15:44,385
[SPEAKER_16]: So we were talking about a few weeks ago on the show.

847
01:15:44,445 --> 01:15:46,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, I think it was one of the shows you weren't here, though.

848
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,207
[SPEAKER_16]: We were talking about DDR and anime.

849
01:15:48,227 --> 01:15:48,948
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the correlation?

850
01:15:48,968 --> 01:15:51,269
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, no, I think it was your first show back we started talking about this.

851
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:52,550
[SPEAKER_16]: What is the connection?

852
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:57,193
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like a lot of... Besides the obvious, they're both from Japan reference, you know.

853
01:15:57,373 --> 01:16:00,416
[SPEAKER_16]: What is their... Why does there seem to be this connection between anime and DDR?

854
01:16:00,736 --> 01:16:02,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know...

855
01:16:03,397 --> 01:16:10,421
[SPEAKER_09]: I have often thought that, and you don't necessarily have to be into one to be in the other, but I've noticed that a lot of people are into both.

856
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:13,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you say otaku?

857
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:14,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Otaku.

858
01:16:14,483 --> 01:16:14,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

859
01:16:16,223 --> 01:16:21,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the people who actually really don't know what that means, it's someone who actually sits at home and doesn't go anywhere.

860
01:16:22,046 --> 01:16:23,046
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the literal reference.

861
01:16:23,067 --> 01:16:24,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Otaku means home.

862
01:16:25,187 --> 01:16:26,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, otaku means home.

863
01:16:28,343 --> 01:16:39,468
[SPEAKER_09]: For people who misuse the word otaku, it actually is, in slang terms, it means somebody who stays in their house all day and never goes out, just sits with their anime.

864
01:16:39,769 --> 01:16:42,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I know people like that.

865
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:48,033
[SPEAKER_16]: For those that are in the chat room right now, I have to point out that Kiel posted a very funny picture.

866
01:16:48,073 --> 01:16:53,415
[SPEAKER_16]: It kind of reminded me of the movie Office Space, where he's beating the crap out of his old Macintosh here with a hammer.

867
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:53,955
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like about...

868
01:16:56,137 --> 01:16:57,758
[SPEAKER_16]: 0.2 seconds before impact here.

869
01:16:57,978 --> 01:17:00,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Melody seems to be sad here as the Mac fan.

870
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:00,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh-oh, uh-oh.

871
01:17:01,601 --> 01:17:05,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the only Macintosh user and I must say that shocks and saddens me.

872
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:07,646
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

873
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:16,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember being 11 or 12 and doing tech support for my school on those old apples.

874
01:17:16,726 --> 01:17:17,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it is a pick.

875
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:19,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it's moving.

876
01:17:19,148 --> 01:17:20,929
[SPEAKER_16]: It kind of looked like a hammer at first glance from far away.

877
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:23,952
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks like the pick is already through the monitor there on the screen.

878
01:17:23,992 --> 01:17:24,372
[SPEAKER_16]: My bad.

879
01:17:26,654 --> 01:17:30,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And now, a moment of silence to mourn the loss of one more Macintosh.

880
01:17:31,659 --> 01:17:35,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Three, three, three, oh, snap.

881
01:17:36,304 --> 01:17:37,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, poor Melody.

882
01:17:38,206 --> 01:17:41,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I promised Irene she could get a second here to share a thought.

883
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:44,711
[SPEAKER_16]: So now I'd like to do a segment called Irene's Thought of the Day.

884
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:45,631
[SPEAKER_16]: So here we go.

885
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:46,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Deep Thoughts by Irene.

886
01:17:46,252 --> 01:17:47,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Here comes Irene.

887
01:17:48,454 --> 01:17:48,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Here she is.

888
01:17:51,576 --> 01:17:53,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you were going to do this.

889
01:17:54,038 --> 01:17:58,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I was just going to let everyone know that procrastination is like masturbation.

890
01:17:59,402 --> 01:18:02,144
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it feels good until you realize that you've fucked yourself.

891
01:18:02,164 --> 01:18:03,565
[SPEAKER_08]: That was deep.

892
01:18:08,297 --> 01:18:09,178
[SPEAKER_09]: That was very deep.

893
01:18:10,258 --> 01:18:12,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, thank you so much for that.

894
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:14,541
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember, wash your hands.

895
01:18:14,561 --> 01:18:25,147
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's a little late, I know it's a little late, Irene, but... You got some ha-ha's from the chatroom, though.

896
01:18:27,128 --> 01:18:28,529
[SPEAKER_09]: She says thank you, chatroom.

897
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:33,352
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that was actually, though, a very interesting point.

898
01:18:33,452 --> 01:18:34,573
[SPEAKER_09]: That is actually very true.

899
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:37,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you.

900
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:38,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

901
01:18:38,206 --> 01:18:42,489
[SPEAKER_09]: As Rob stares at me and blinks at me.

902
01:18:42,889 --> 01:18:46,151
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we just going to talk about masturbation the rest of the show, then, or what's the deal?

903
01:18:46,171 --> 01:18:46,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Masturbation.

904
01:18:46,832 --> 01:18:47,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we're losing listeners.

905
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:48,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Dear God, no.

906
01:18:48,513 --> 01:18:49,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Bomani, Bomani.

907
01:18:49,554 --> 01:18:54,117
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, don't you notice that sex brings, you know, in listeners, you know, spank, spank, spank, whatever.

908
01:18:55,718 --> 01:18:57,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Irene, want to tell us some more about masturbation?

909
01:18:57,319 --> 01:19:02,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Irene goes, okay, and comes on over.

910
01:19:07,144 --> 01:19:08,004
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you want to know?

911
01:19:08,925 --> 01:19:10,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about masturbation.

912
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:17,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think masturbation, the definition of masturbation is pleasing yourself sexually.

913
01:19:18,613 --> 01:19:20,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.

914
01:19:20,694 --> 01:19:22,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think guys do it more.

915
01:19:23,596 --> 01:19:23,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

916
01:19:24,857 --> 01:19:25,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

917
01:19:25,818 --> 01:19:27,079
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't watch people do it.

918
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,421
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think they do it more.

919
01:19:30,453 --> 01:19:32,413
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's kind of like gin rummy.

920
01:19:32,453 --> 01:19:34,654
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you don't need a partner if you got a good hand.

921
01:19:34,794 --> 01:19:36,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.

922
01:19:36,454 --> 01:19:41,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God, are we going to make a bunch of, like, obscure quotes now or something?

923
01:19:41,535 --> 01:19:42,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Sexual quotes now?

924
01:19:42,835 --> 01:19:46,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, I need good sound bites for the show, so just keep this bit going.

925
01:19:46,436 --> 01:19:49,296
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't got, there's nothing else DDR, 2DX, whatever to talk about.

926
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:56,338
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it can be done with things that you find at the grocery store, too.

927
01:19:57,818 --> 01:19:58,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Pork fat.

928
01:20:00,126 --> 01:20:01,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard Crisco from somebody once.

929
01:20:04,649 --> 01:20:05,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Chicken burrito.

930
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:06,391
[SPEAKER_11]: For a girl?

931
01:20:07,051 --> 01:20:08,793
[SPEAKER_08]: No, from one of my ex-boyfriends.

932
01:20:09,853 --> 01:20:12,735
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean like the stuff you can use, a girl can use this stuff.

933
01:20:12,776 --> 01:20:15,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think a girl really needs to use anything, do they?

934
01:20:15,438 --> 01:20:15,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Your mama.

935
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you didn't talk about mama.

936
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:24,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and now that we've completely crashed Timber.

937
01:20:24,744 --> 01:20:26,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's get back to Bomani before everyone throws up.

938
01:20:26,525 --> 01:20:28,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, okay.

939
01:20:28,206 --> 01:20:28,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Here you go, Rob.

940
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:31,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, Rob has to play Sexy Planet.

941
01:20:34,672 --> 01:20:36,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Gee, wow, that poor Mac died.

942
01:20:38,255 --> 01:20:39,376
[SPEAKER_09]: And how about them coal miners?

943
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,536
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all happy.

944
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:45,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me run to the list here.

945
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:47,842
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yes, let's talk about music.

946
01:20:48,403 --> 01:20:48,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Music that we...

947
01:20:50,496 --> 01:20:51,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I need music.

948
01:20:51,257 --> 01:20:55,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Besides the Bee-Mani series, what is some music that you all like to listen to?

949
01:20:56,941 --> 01:21:01,203
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I got criticized last week for not talking like the announcer, going, Bee-Mani!

950
01:21:01,784 --> 01:21:03,625
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Konami's famous Bee-Mani series!

951
01:21:03,645 --> 01:21:05,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, the announcer is wrong, too.

952
01:21:06,187 --> 01:21:07,548
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the announcer is wrong, too.

953
01:21:08,268 --> 01:21:09,189
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Bee-Mani.

954
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:13,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the announcer in Max 2 doesn't speak Japanese very well, but still.

955
01:21:13,812 --> 01:21:15,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got out.

956
01:21:16,897 --> 01:21:18,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, well, all right, music.

957
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:21,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll tell you what, let's run it around.

958
01:21:21,065 --> 01:21:22,488
[SPEAKER_09]: What's everybody listening to this week?

959
01:21:23,334 --> 01:21:29,838
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, when I was driving home from San Francisco today, I listened to a new radio station over there, 92.7, which is like just dance music all day.

960
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:38,464
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm having this, like, I'm liking a lot of new trance music lately, like that Heaven song that they play on the radio all the freaking time, and these other songs.

961
01:21:38,504 --> 01:21:39,505
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm liking that right now.

962
01:21:40,045 --> 01:21:41,966
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's played out, but I like it.

963
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:42,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

964
01:21:42,827 --> 01:21:47,790
[SPEAKER_12]: I was also listening to the 92.7, the dance, coming back from San Francisco today.

965
01:21:48,331 --> 01:21:49,552
[SPEAKER_12]: Good stuff.

966
01:21:49,592 --> 01:21:50,412
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just fell asleep then.

967
01:21:50,432 --> 01:21:51,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Some good shit, huh?

968
01:21:51,893 --> 01:21:52,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Some good shit.

969
01:21:53,854 --> 01:21:54,555
[SPEAKER_16]: How about our guests?

970
01:21:54,575 --> 01:21:55,795
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you kids listening to?

971
01:21:56,055 --> 01:21:58,176
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, I should ask you guys this, because you weren't here for this show.

972
01:21:58,756 --> 01:22:01,637
[SPEAKER_16]: What songs do you think should be in a... Thank you, Dave.

973
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,278
[SPEAKER_16]: What songs do you think should be in a Bomani game that aren't?

974
01:22:05,899 --> 01:22:09,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as for what I'm listening to, it's rather eclectic.

975
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:13,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Normally, one of the things I've been digging a lot lately is the new Red Hot Chili Pepper CD.

976
01:22:13,722 --> 01:22:15,483
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really good CD.

977
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:18,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I just turn on By The Way and listen to that track over and over again.

978
01:22:19,927 --> 01:22:32,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know how many times, but it's really mellow, but it's quite good, and then most of the time I'm driving, I'll let Mel throw in whatever CD he wants, so it's just kind of whatever he chooses.

979
01:22:36,343 --> 01:22:40,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess for my musical taste, it's sort of kind of run around.

980
01:22:40,546 --> 01:22:46,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I guess my first love always will be sort of like the 80s British Invasion, New Wave movement.

981
01:22:47,493 --> 01:22:49,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I was, you know, I was one of those kids born on MTV.

982
01:22:50,055 --> 01:22:55,821
[SPEAKER_11]: My cousin had Betamax and like taped MTV three hours a day, bring it over, and you know, I was like sucked in, so...

983
01:22:56,341 --> 01:22:59,422
[SPEAKER_11]: It's that and my second love would probably have to be the 90s New Jack Swing movement.

984
01:22:59,482 --> 01:23:06,343
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, everyone loves cross colors and hats worn backwards with their tags still in them and hammer pants and BBD and all that good schmazz.

985
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:19,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that just really says I really don't really dig much of today's music, which is not to say there isn't good ones, but back then, it's not just the fact that music was good, but I guess it's just all the memories that come along with it.

986
01:23:19,386 --> 01:23:20,946
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of the big things about music.

987
01:23:21,346 --> 01:23:21,546
[SPEAKER_11]: and so on.

988
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:52,388
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going back through my playlists and I found Mr. E's Beautiful Blues, which was on Road Trip, by the Eels, though.

989
01:23:52,969 --> 01:23:58,533
[SPEAKER_18]: And I found a lot of songs I liked by them, so I actually got all four of their CDs and listened to a lot of that.

990
01:23:58,954 --> 01:24:00,675
[SPEAKER_18]: And I went to the They Might Be Giants concert.

991
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:03,657
[SPEAKER_18]: I had their latest CD, No, and I've gotten two more.

992
01:24:03,817 --> 01:24:10,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, actually, in the chat room, one of our chatters right now, 3FeetElite, also went to the They Might Be Giants concert, so he actually brought that up as well.

993
01:24:10,343 --> 01:24:10,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Great concert.

994
01:24:11,063 --> 01:24:11,884
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a lot of fun.

995
01:24:12,384 --> 01:24:15,225
[SPEAKER_18]: They rocked out on a lot of songs I didn't expect, and it was really a new experience.

996
01:24:15,245 --> 01:24:18,326
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the second one I've been to, besides Red Hot Chili Peppers, so it was a lot of fun.

997
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:20,427
[SPEAKER_09]: What was their best song they performed?

998
01:24:21,448 --> 01:24:22,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Your favorite of their performances?

999
01:24:22,528 --> 01:24:24,409
[SPEAKER_18]: You've heard Robot Parade, it's sort of mellowed out.

1000
01:24:24,429 --> 01:24:25,809
[SPEAKER_18]: They actually rocked out on that a lot.

1001
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:31,872
[SPEAKER_18]: And there's one called On the Drags, which is a Rarity's album I got from them, which is just sort of normal rock, but they did it really well.

1002
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:32,732
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a lot of fun.

1003
01:24:36,967 --> 01:24:40,851
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm listening to a full spectrum of stuff.

1004
01:24:40,891 --> 01:24:48,720
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been listening to this George Acosta CD I had, and it's just some trance music and stuff, and I'm also listening to KMFDM.

1005
01:24:49,561 --> 01:24:49,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, cool.

1006
01:24:50,021 --> 01:24:50,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Attack.

1007
01:24:52,844 --> 01:24:55,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, go ahead and repeat that from the microphone.

1008
01:24:56,087 --> 01:25:05,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, back when I was working at Industrial Station, I was working at KSJS for San Jose State, and one of our favorite jokes going around was, KMFDM stood for Kill Motherfucking Depeche Mode.

1009
01:25:08,559 --> 01:25:17,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, for the people who can't hear what's going on away from the microphone...

1010
01:25:20,055 --> 01:25:29,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure for people who have been reading the What Are You Listening To Now thread on Psych by Money or who have talked to me since I came back from Anime Expo,

1011
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:36,067
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1012
01:25:53,211 --> 01:25:59,894
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, my whole big thing with J-Rock lately has been, it's like listening, it's got the same feel that a lot of the good 80s rock had.

1013
01:26:01,054 --> 01:26:09,118
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've really gone overboard with the glam if you're into the visual K. So, for all the J-Rock fans out there, there's a lot of us now.

1014
01:26:09,138 --> 01:26:17,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I was being told by the chatroom, I was given this link and said, don't click this link, what did they say, if you've been eating?

1015
01:26:19,617 --> 01:26:20,297
[SPEAKER_16]: If you've been eating.

1016
01:26:20,357 --> 01:26:20,998
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, here we go.

1017
01:26:21,018 --> 01:26:22,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see what this takes us to.

1018
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:28,922
[SPEAKER_16]: That's horrible.

1019
01:26:30,162 --> 01:26:31,363
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a family show.

1020
01:26:33,864 --> 01:26:37,026
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not think I'll be eating a cherry muffin anytime soon.

1021
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:39,832
[SPEAKER_09]: That was worse than Goatsy.

1022
01:26:41,254 --> 01:26:42,035
[SPEAKER_09]: That was worse.

1023
01:26:43,537 --> 01:26:45,519
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a few things that I could consider worse than that.

1024
01:26:45,559 --> 01:26:46,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1025
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:47,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1026
01:26:47,642 --> 01:26:48,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did you do that?

1027
01:26:48,723 --> 01:26:48,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1028
01:26:48,883 --> 01:26:49,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my eyes are bleeding.

1029
01:26:49,905 --> 01:26:52,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, let's explain for those listeners out there what we just saw.

1030
01:26:53,229 --> 01:26:53,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm picturing...

1031
01:26:55,972 --> 01:27:13,610
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm picturing a five year old kid crossing a street covered in broken glass and ten UPS fans hit him all at once and they poured popcorn on him or something and some cherry syrup.

1032
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:14,331
[SPEAKER_14]: It was pretty bad.

1033
01:27:17,389 --> 01:27:21,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I know when to go... No, no, Dave is asking us to look at this again.

1034
01:27:21,332 --> 01:27:23,174
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess I know when to go to the bathroom now.

1035
01:27:23,714 --> 01:27:24,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Good timing there.

1036
01:27:25,075 --> 01:27:27,477
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay, yay, pictures.

1037
01:27:27,938 --> 01:27:29,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I don't think we're going to... No.

1038
01:27:30,219 --> 01:27:31,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Goat's Day was bad enough.

1039
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:32,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, moving right along.

1040
01:27:32,741 --> 01:27:34,323
[SPEAKER_16]: How about some show news?

1041
01:27:34,903 --> 01:27:35,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Show news.

1042
01:27:35,163 --> 01:27:36,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Some Orange Lounge show news.

1043
01:27:36,825 --> 01:27:39,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Next week on the show, as if... We're starting to get guests here.

1044
01:27:39,827 --> 01:27:42,469
[SPEAKER_16]: We're joined by Mel B and Melody this week.

1045
01:27:42,509 --> 01:27:43,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you guys having a good time?

1046
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:44,231
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope you're having a good time.

1047
01:27:44,251 --> 01:27:45,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man, we're just kicking it.

1048
01:27:45,251 --> 01:27:45,692
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great.

1049
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:47,033
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all we do here.

1050
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:48,234
[SPEAKER_16]: We just kind of sit around and talk.

1051
01:27:48,594 --> 01:27:50,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Just lounging in the Orange Lounge.

1052
01:27:50,636 --> 01:27:51,316
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just chilling.

1053
01:27:51,736 --> 01:27:51,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1054
01:27:52,717 --> 01:27:56,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Next week, we're going to have some special guests, but I'm not allowed to tell you who they are.

1055
01:27:57,381 --> 01:27:58,201
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go ahead and say who.

1056
01:27:58,982 --> 01:27:59,342
[SPEAKER_16]: I can?

1057
01:27:59,563 --> 01:28:02,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, if they tell me I can, then I will.

1058
01:28:02,725 --> 01:28:04,406
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're going to be... I can tell you this much.

1059
01:28:04,426 --> 01:28:08,109
[SPEAKER_16]: There's some more Bay Area friends of ours that are going to be coming to visit, and there's two of them.

1060
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:09,871
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll tell you that much.

1061
01:28:09,911 --> 01:28:12,473
[SPEAKER_16]: And if they want to reveal themselves, then we'll tell you all.

1062
01:28:12,533 --> 01:28:13,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're very happy to have them here.

1063
01:28:14,874 --> 01:28:15,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, when we do...

1064
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:18,765
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll tell you guys during the break.

1065
01:28:18,785 --> 01:28:23,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if you were here, part of our live studio audience, you will know.

1066
01:28:26,387 --> 01:28:30,088
[SPEAKER_09]: The live experience is truly something that people can live with.

1067
01:28:31,448 --> 01:28:33,908
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the only way you're going to get all the inside jokes, really.

1068
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:46,151
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I think one day we're going to, well, I already have said, you know, I've got the kit to go out to tournaments, and I was actually going to do this at CVGL, but unfortunately some personal life things got in the way, and I wasn't able to cover the tournament.

1069
01:28:46,171 --> 01:28:46,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob was asleep.

1070
01:28:51,082 --> 01:28:59,286
[SPEAKER_16]: I wasn't able to cover the tournament, so later we'll be going out, Jamie and I, when we go out to places, we'll take the live remote with us and interview random people.

1071
01:28:59,787 --> 01:29:06,010
[SPEAKER_16]: But hopefully one day, we're going to broadcast this show live from somewhere else, like a tournament or something.

1072
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:07,251
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be in the bathroom, Ms.

1073
01:29:07,271 --> 01:29:07,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Vigil.

1074
01:29:09,192 --> 01:29:11,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Broadcast, coming to you live from the bathroom at AI.

1075
01:29:12,774 --> 01:29:13,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, who farted?

1076
01:29:16,357 --> 01:29:20,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, you know, just make sure that you don't eat in the snack bar before that.

1077
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:21,431
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll be fine.

1078
01:29:22,955 --> 01:29:23,175
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1079
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,540
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think now's a good break time.

1080
01:29:26,681 --> 01:29:27,221
[SPEAKER_16]: How's that sound?

1081
01:29:27,241 --> 01:29:27,901
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll take one more break.

1082
01:29:27,921 --> 01:29:28,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I get to break stuff?

1083
01:29:29,021 --> 01:29:29,582
[SPEAKER_16]: Then we'll come back.

1084
01:29:29,602 --> 01:29:36,124
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got about a half hour show left, so we'll take another quick break, come back, wrap up the show, and put the nail in the coffin of this week's Orange Lounge.

1085
01:29:36,864 --> 01:29:40,445
[SPEAKER_16]: And let's see, what did I promise the chatroom, or what did I promise chatroom my play for?

1086
01:29:40,465 --> 01:29:41,886
[SPEAKER_09]: You promised long train running for our chatroom.

1087
01:29:42,006 --> 01:29:43,446
[SPEAKER_16]: I promised long train running, didn't I?

1088
01:29:43,486 --> 01:29:48,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we're going to start it off with some long train running here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1089
01:30:33,755 --> 01:30:34,709
All recommendations

1090
01:32:52,071 --> 01:32:52,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1091
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:27,233
Thanks for watching!

1092
01:34:47,569 --> 01:34:49,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, crap, we went into dead air there for a minute.

1093
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:49,830
[SPEAKER_16]: My bad.

1094
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:50,511
[SPEAKER_16]: We're sorry.

1095
01:34:50,731 --> 01:34:55,513
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going... Jeez, tonight's just the night of Rob messing everything up, isn't it?

1096
01:34:55,533 --> 01:34:56,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Technical poopy.

1097
01:34:58,174 --> 01:34:59,215
[SPEAKER_09]: SOK, Rob, we still love you.

1098
01:35:01,216 --> 01:35:02,517
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just going to guess where we were in the song.

1099
01:35:02,537 --> 01:35:03,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Irene said, who's we?

1100
01:35:03,477 --> 01:35:07,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's we?

1101
01:37:09,091 --> 01:37:14,113
[SPEAKER_01]: After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

1102
01:37:14,894 --> 01:37:18,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Undersedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.

1103
01:37:19,196 --> 01:37:25,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UndersedationLive.org.

1104
01:37:34,446 --> 01:37:36,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

1105
01:37:36,427 --> 01:37:38,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Bongo demands it.

1106
01:38:04,619 --> 01:38:07,600
[SPEAKER_16]: We got one of my roommate's friends, apparently just got back.

1107
01:38:08,361 --> 01:38:09,421
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think of this whole thing?

1108
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:12,402
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what Dance Dance Revolution is, correct?

1109
01:38:12,823 --> 01:38:13,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I've played a couple times.

1110
01:38:14,163 --> 01:38:16,884
[SPEAKER_16]: But you have no freaking clue why people get obsessed with it, right?

1111
01:38:18,005 --> 01:38:18,145
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1112
01:38:20,526 --> 01:38:27,089
[SPEAKER_16]: So, knowing that you've got tons of Bomani freaks and addicts listening right now, what do you have to say about Bomani?

1113
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:27,810
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think about it?

1114
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:29,831
[SPEAKER_16]: What the hell is it?

1115
01:38:30,891 --> 01:38:34,373
[SPEAKER_16]: All the DDRs, all the Dance Dance Revolution and button-pounding games.

1116
01:38:35,494 --> 01:38:36,954
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are just a bunch of freaks.

1117
01:38:37,214 --> 01:38:37,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you!

1118
01:38:37,775 --> 01:38:38,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, thank you very much.

1119
01:38:38,655 --> 01:38:38,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1120
01:38:39,256 --> 01:38:39,616
[SPEAKER_16]: Get out of here.

1121
01:38:39,656 --> 01:38:39,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Get lost.

1122
01:38:39,896 --> 01:38:40,576
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to see you.

1123
01:38:40,616 --> 01:38:40,776
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1124
01:38:41,437 --> 01:38:41,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1125
01:38:43,118 --> 01:38:44,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Meanwhile... He just doesn't know.

1126
01:38:44,858 --> 01:38:45,519
[SPEAKER_16]: He's not in the know.

1127
01:38:47,363 --> 01:38:52,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I was told over the break that I am allowed to announce our guests that are coming next week.

1128
01:38:52,858 --> 01:38:53,078
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1129
01:39:00,547 --> 01:39:04,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Our guests next week will be Jazz and DDR Mike.

1130
01:39:04,770 --> 01:39:08,072
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll be here in the house next week in the studio.

1131
01:39:08,212 --> 01:39:11,154
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Mike is, I don't know, he's DDR Mike.

1132
01:39:11,174 --> 01:39:12,755
[SPEAKER_16]: He plays in Concord.

1133
01:39:12,855 --> 01:39:14,276
[SPEAKER_16]: They're both Concord peoples.

1134
01:39:15,737 --> 01:39:18,759
[SPEAKER_09]: We have more Step Squad people, you know, more Step Squad to hang out with me.

1135
01:39:19,099 --> 01:39:19,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

1136
01:39:19,379 --> 01:39:19,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, woo!

1137
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,380
[SPEAKER_16]: So they'll be here next week.

1138
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:22,741
[SPEAKER_16]: I won't be alone anymore.

1139
01:39:22,901 --> 01:39:25,723
[SPEAKER_16]: They'll get to plug whatever they want and talk about whatever.

1140
01:39:25,923 --> 01:39:27,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we let our guests plug things.

1141
01:39:27,724 --> 01:39:29,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Does anybody else want to plug something in the house?

1142
01:39:29,845 --> 01:39:30,746
[SPEAKER_16]: That's good, yay.

1143
01:39:31,626 --> 01:39:34,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Hair dryer, toaster, personal massage.

1144
01:39:36,149 --> 01:39:39,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway... We have a request for a toaster and a personal massage.

1145
01:39:40,731 --> 01:39:41,251
[SPEAKER_16]: A vibrator?

1146
01:39:41,372 --> 01:39:41,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1147
01:39:43,273 --> 01:39:43,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway...

1148
01:39:47,714 --> 01:39:49,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Back to DDR Talk.

1149
01:39:49,978 --> 01:39:54,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Matt wanted to talk about his latest conquest in the DDR world, so let's talk about that.

1150
01:39:55,788 --> 01:40:04,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, right now what I've been trying to do, because I'm really big into the editing and the edit hacking, two things that are on the list, one probably before the other.

1151
01:40:04,831 --> 01:40:08,473
[SPEAKER_15]: The first one is going to be getting 30 second steps in DDR.

1152
01:40:08,573 --> 01:40:11,394
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm pretty close to doing it, just have to actually test the file first.

1153
01:40:11,974 --> 01:40:17,296
[SPEAKER_15]: And the second one will be making Max 2 exclusive songs, finding the machine ID for that.

1154
01:40:17,396 --> 01:40:18,817
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's another thing that's on my list.

1155
01:40:19,437 --> 01:40:23,258
[SPEAKER_15]: I was hoping to have the 30 second steps done by today, but I fell behind.

1156
01:40:23,378 --> 01:40:24,239
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe next week.

1157
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:25,940
[SPEAKER_15]: That is all.

1158
01:40:43,041 --> 01:40:49,746
[SPEAKER_09]: For anyone who can full combo with a 90% perfect attack on my Look to the Sky edit, it's called Free Fall.

1159
01:40:50,227 --> 01:40:52,348
[SPEAKER_09]: You get a nice, lovely little GameCube pin.

1160
01:40:52,849 --> 01:40:54,930
[SPEAKER_09]: First person who sends me proof gets it.

1161
01:40:55,871 --> 01:41:02,576
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's the one for my DXY edit, Another, which basically is really evil.

1162
01:41:02,616 --> 01:41:06,039
[SPEAKER_09]: And one second place in that lovely Hell edit contest that Matt had.

1163
01:41:06,059 --> 01:41:06,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1164
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:10,202
[SPEAKER_09]: You will be taken out to dinner.

1165
01:41:10,322 --> 01:41:14,325
[SPEAKER_09]: So the one for that is if you full combo it or 90% perfect attack it.

1166
01:41:14,745 --> 01:41:20,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Either or, I will take you out to a nice dinner with a decent limit on what you can get.

1167
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:21,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Will it be a candlelight dinner?

1168
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:22,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, baby.

1169
01:41:23,512 --> 01:41:24,212
[SPEAKER_09]: You get smoothed.

1170
01:41:28,515 --> 01:41:30,557
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be wine and cheese and corn.

1171
01:41:31,497 --> 01:41:32,298
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be bread also.

1172
01:41:33,779 --> 01:41:34,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And cloth napkins.

1173
01:41:35,981 --> 01:41:36,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1174
01:41:38,633 --> 01:41:39,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1175
01:41:40,214 --> 01:41:46,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you know, I'm referring to, you know, I'm not going to take you out to like a four-star restaurant, you know, but maybe two and a half.

1176
01:41:47,559 --> 01:41:51,982
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'll take you out to sushi or, you know, maybe Outback if you're lucky.

1177
01:41:52,642 --> 01:41:55,224
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, of course, I won't be touching the meat, but, you know.

1178
01:41:57,211 --> 01:42:04,516
[SPEAKER_09]: and anyone who can full combo it or get a 90% perfect attack on my another edit will get a nice meal from me.

1179
01:42:04,796 --> 01:42:07,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you guys are going to love it when I find 30 second notes.

1180
01:42:08,259 --> 01:42:11,841
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been planning, actually, the edit I made today that I was going to test, but it got cut off.

1181
01:42:12,021 --> 01:42:16,745
[SPEAKER_15]: It has at the very end all eight arrows come down at the same time, or relatively close to the same time.

1182
01:42:17,045 --> 01:42:17,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny just to watch.

1183
01:42:18,126 --> 01:42:21,228
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when you have a seizure on the pad.

1184
01:42:21,748 --> 01:42:24,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, you know the involuntary bow movements are prohibited.

1185
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:37,797
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and also, I am going to be, now that I have Max at home, I am going to be working on my other, my next tell edit, probably to Waka Waka.

1186
01:42:38,878 --> 01:42:44,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, I want to do just this insanely evil... Wait, how can you do a Waka Waka edit with Max 1?

1187
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:46,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it wasn't in there.

1188
01:42:46,221 --> 01:42:46,921
[SPEAKER_16]: You mean Blonde Girl?

1189
01:42:47,621 --> 01:42:49,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, forget it.

1190
01:42:49,503 --> 01:42:52,745
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to pick a super cute, happy song and then do something evil to it.

1191
01:42:53,105 --> 01:43:01,512
[SPEAKER_09]: So, hey, if anybody wants me to make a hell edit and name it after them, pick me a song and I will make you an edit to it.

1192
01:43:01,552 --> 01:43:04,755
[SPEAKER_16]: This is what happened when Jamie realized that Waka Waka was not in DDR Max 1.

1193
01:43:04,915 --> 01:43:08,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my goodness, I can't believe it.

1194
01:43:08,337 --> 01:43:09,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's ruined.

1195
01:43:10,259 --> 01:43:11,720
[SPEAKER_09]: You want me to kick you?

1196
01:43:12,788 --> 01:43:14,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody give me some... Where's the Clifford Ball?

1197
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:17,791
[SPEAKER_16]: The Clifford Ball's in the other studio.

1198
01:43:18,131 --> 01:43:19,291
[SPEAKER_16]: We're in the big studio night.

1199
01:43:19,331 --> 01:43:20,552
[SPEAKER_16]: The Clifford Ball's in the little studio.

1200
01:43:20,772 --> 01:43:24,814
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I bought this Clifford Ball two weeks ago to throw it at Rob, and I haven't done it yet.

1201
01:43:25,154 --> 01:43:28,436
[SPEAKER_09]: It, like, lives here now, so... Mwahaha.

1202
01:43:28,916 --> 01:43:34,639
[SPEAKER_16]: So... But, you know... I can just play random sound effects the rest of the show.

1203
01:43:34,939 --> 01:43:36,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you gay?

1204
01:43:37,681 --> 01:43:42,243
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, everybody who at least, you know, posts on the Sackman Money forums know that Rob is our Big Gay Chili.

1205
01:43:45,911 --> 01:43:49,292
[SPEAKER_09]: When you were born, I think you looked like a chili.

1206
01:43:51,733 --> 01:43:53,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, enough with the sound effects.

1207
01:43:53,374 --> 01:43:54,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, enough with the sound effects.

1208
01:43:55,335 --> 01:43:56,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not allowed to have fun here.

1209
01:43:57,776 --> 01:44:00,617
[SPEAKER_09]: We are a serious talk show.

1210
01:44:01,397 --> 01:44:03,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's talk about the future.

1211
01:44:04,478 --> 01:44:06,299
[SPEAKER_16]: What other tournaments are you going to be attending in the future?

1212
01:44:08,664 --> 01:44:11,047
[SPEAKER_11]: For me, I don't know exactly what big ones are coming up.

1213
01:44:11,087 --> 01:44:13,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess there's the one at Mountain Mike's that's coming up next month.

1214
01:44:14,111 --> 01:44:15,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll probably mosey into that.

1215
01:44:15,533 --> 01:44:16,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I'll compete or not.

1216
01:44:16,995 --> 01:44:19,378
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of hard to say right now.

1217
01:44:19,518 --> 01:44:24,724
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to go to the Midwest Showdown, which is next month, but things sort of came through.

1218
01:44:24,785 --> 01:44:27,228
[SPEAKER_11]: In other words, meaning I'm a broke-ass.

1219
01:44:27,708 --> 01:44:32,613
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I was going to have a huge routine for that, but I guess I'll use it for whenever's clever.

1220
01:44:33,794 --> 01:44:37,338
[SPEAKER_11]: The only one that I know that's... Actually, Triple Threat is the one I'll be going to next.

1221
01:44:37,678 --> 01:44:41,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's on August 1st and 2nd over at Sunnyvale Golf Land.

1222
01:44:41,862 --> 01:44:42,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Check that out.

1223
01:44:42,483 --> 01:44:45,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe, yeah, DDR Spot's going to be blowing up the spot with that one.

1224
01:44:45,886 --> 01:44:46,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I have to ask, though.

1225
01:44:46,807 --> 01:44:48,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Thursday and Friday, what's up with that?

1226
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:51,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's see...

1227
01:44:52,336 --> 01:45:01,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the main thing about trying to schedule a tournament on Saturday and Sunday, what a lot of people forget is Golfland is all about the birthday parties and all those kind of things, and that's first priority.

1228
01:45:02,241 --> 01:45:04,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Thursday and Friday night, I mean, it's summertime.

1229
01:45:04,902 --> 01:45:09,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Most people that get off work around 5 or so, and it just kind of works.

1230
01:45:09,124 --> 01:45:10,544
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the best thing we can do for now.

1231
01:45:11,025 --> 01:45:12,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they going to be doing it at night?

1232
01:45:13,386 --> 01:45:15,907
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as I know, yeah, like late afternoon into the night.

1233
01:45:17,024 --> 01:45:22,929
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of want to go, but unfortunately I've got to work, and when you add a drive on top of that, it's not going to be very much fun for me to get out there.

1234
01:45:23,229 --> 01:45:24,410
[SPEAKER_16]: But I wish you guys the best of luck.

1235
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:25,571
[SPEAKER_16]: It does sound like an awesome tournament.

1236
01:45:25,731 --> 01:45:28,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Very innovative new stuff that you guys are going to be doing there.

1237
01:45:28,213 --> 01:45:28,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1238
01:45:28,554 --> 01:45:29,494
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope it does go well.

1239
01:45:29,534 --> 01:45:33,438
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's part of the thing about the tournament stats, especially Mike No Runs.

1240
01:45:33,698 --> 01:45:38,061
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gone to a point where we've kind of seen, okay, everyone's skill and all that, but there's only so much...

1241
01:45:39,548 --> 01:45:39,728
[SPEAKER_11]: P.A.

1242
01:45:39,768 --> 01:45:39,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Tournament

1243
01:46:01,741 --> 01:46:02,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, absolutely.

1244
01:46:02,501 --> 01:46:08,083
[SPEAKER_11]: That's freestyle to me, to make an analogy, it's like the NBA slam dunk contest.

1245
01:46:08,123 --> 01:46:12,545
[SPEAKER_16]: So, it's not something that has to go hand in hand, you know, you've got to have your PA and your freestyle.

1246
01:46:12,845 --> 01:46:13,745
[SPEAKER_16]: It's cool to have them.

1247
01:46:14,225 --> 01:46:17,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Because even at the PA only tournaments, it seems like there's always a little freestyle on the side.

1248
01:46:18,567 --> 01:46:21,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah, well, freestyle... It's like you get a free cup of freestyle.

1249
01:46:21,868 --> 01:46:22,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

1250
01:46:22,768 --> 01:46:29,531
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a hint of, you know, just like in some freestyle tournaments, some people who PA think their PA-ing looks good, and no, it doesn't.

1251
01:46:31,294 --> 01:46:33,355
[SPEAKER_16]: What are some things in freestyle that piss you off?

1252
01:46:35,075 --> 01:46:36,315
[SPEAKER_16]: Or make you upset?

1253
01:46:38,256 --> 01:46:39,837
[SPEAKER_16]: Melody's hitting the... You have something you want to say.

1254
01:46:41,317 --> 01:46:43,498
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the hand slaps and the knee drops.

1255
01:46:45,158 --> 01:46:45,638
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1256
01:46:46,078 --> 01:46:50,620
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gotten to the point where... Actually, I've gone through quite a few tourneys where I haven't seen that many hand slaps or knee drops.

1257
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:51,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of miss them.

1258
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:54,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Does that mean we'll see them in your next routine?

1259
01:46:56,021 --> 01:46:56,281
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1260
01:46:56,321 --> 01:46:57,922
[SPEAKER_11]: If I get there to do it, I will do it.

1261
01:46:59,483 --> 01:47:00,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe I'll have to dare.

1262
01:47:01,025 --> 01:47:03,487
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I dare you on this show right here.

1263
01:47:03,907 --> 01:47:04,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Next, next routine.

1264
01:47:05,209 --> 01:47:06,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Hand slaps and knee drops.

1265
01:47:07,991 --> 01:47:08,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Not only, not only.

1266
01:47:09,533 --> 01:47:10,934
[SPEAKER_16]: As your finish, as your finish.

1267
01:47:11,094 --> 01:47:12,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, just so we got a few witnesses in here.

1268
01:47:12,596 --> 01:47:13,717
[SPEAKER_11]: In the last ten seconds, alright.

1269
01:47:13,797 --> 01:47:14,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Hand shake deal.

1270
01:47:14,778 --> 01:47:16,680
[SPEAKER_11]: There will be hand slaps and knee drops in my next routine.

1271
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Now this is a great deal because I don't have to do a damn thing.

1272
01:47:21,404 --> 01:47:22,866
[SPEAKER_16]: I just get to point at them and make fun of them.

1273
01:47:23,146 --> 01:47:33,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, seriously, I guess, though, things that, I guess, make me mad about freestyle, it's not so much... There's really nothing that makes me mad, just the only thing I get in order is people who really don't put in effort to, like, entertain the crowd.

1274
01:47:33,933 --> 01:47:41,838
[SPEAKER_11]: It's... The only good thing about that is that they've made the pot fatter for the winner, but past that, it's a waste of time, really, for judges and for other people.

1275
01:47:42,178 --> 01:47:46,560
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I guess if they get a cheap throw out of it and they paid their money, I suppose it's all good, but past that...

1276
01:47:47,967 --> 01:47:55,178
[SPEAKER_09]: What would you rather see, you know, something that's really good improv or something that's been taken time to choreograph?

1277
01:47:55,919 --> 01:48:00,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think choreography definitely because not only does it show skill, but it also shows that, you know,

1278
01:48:04,170 --> 01:48:09,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, instead of coming up with something on the spot, it comes up with a thought, and of course you go through all the goods and bads, and it's like a polished product.

1279
01:48:09,654 --> 01:48:22,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Improv, some people can make it look good, you know, it's not easy, but at the same time, in improv, you pretty much have your bread and butter, you have one style and you stick with it, whereas in a choreograph, you can kind of integrate all sorts of little things into one big extravaganza.

1280
01:48:23,641 --> 01:48:27,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, in the chatroom, they said, okay, dare him to do slaps and knee drops on Dynamite Rave.

1281
01:48:28,324 --> 01:48:30,385
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, okay, no, we gotta draw the line somewhere.

1282
01:48:30,405 --> 01:48:31,126
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a little much.

1283
01:48:31,406 --> 01:48:34,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, at least doing the hand drops and knee slaps, whatever.

1284
01:48:36,149 --> 01:48:40,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, at least let me do it to, like, uh, well, what's that, D2R, I guess?

1285
01:48:40,311 --> 01:48:41,952
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, at least make it, you know, get what you want.

1286
01:48:41,972 --> 01:48:42,232
[SPEAKER_11]: D2R!

1287
01:48:43,533 --> 01:48:47,936
[SPEAKER_11]: And surprisingly, after looking at those steps, they actually look very freestyle-able.

1288
01:48:47,976 --> 01:48:51,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that I'd do it, but after this bit, I guess, damned now, you know?

1289
01:48:52,324 --> 01:48:56,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, you know, speaking of songs, what do you think is the best freestyle song in Max 2?

1290
01:48:58,370 --> 01:48:59,752
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as the new stuff.

1291
01:49:01,093 --> 01:49:01,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Secret Rendezvous.

1292
01:49:03,556 --> 01:49:04,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I would definitely put that up.

1293
01:49:04,377 --> 01:49:09,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's slow enough that you can put an extra beat in between all the notes, and so you can do more stuff.

1294
01:49:10,993 --> 01:49:11,434
[SPEAKER_11]: What would you think?

1295
01:49:12,014 --> 01:49:27,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Well I think Secret Rendezvous actually on double bass kick is like double light is probably the best thing because especially for some people who play pump it up a lot there's a lot of it has sort of a five arrow thing where it's like the two middle and then you have like the ups and downs so there are some people who if they rock at pump it up they could like totally tear that up.

1296
01:49:28,651 --> 01:49:31,774
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess a new song actually Spin the Disc is still my favorite.

1297
01:49:33,076 --> 01:49:35,558
[SPEAKER_18]: I may not be laughing on the outside, but inside I know I'm just doing cartwheels over that one.

1298
01:49:56,147 --> 01:50:00,492
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm being suggested by the chatroom that A Minute is also a good freestyle song.

1299
01:50:03,235 --> 01:50:07,539
[SPEAKER_16]: They're saying that Secret Rendezvous is a song about lesbians.

1300
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:09,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't we talk about that on the show a few weeks ago?

1301
01:50:11,659 --> 01:50:12,880
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a lesbian song.

1302
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:15,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh, we have the Brad rant.

1303
01:50:15,181 --> 01:50:17,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Here comes Brad with his secret rendezvous rant.

1304
01:50:17,843 --> 01:50:24,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm sure we'd all like to think it's about lesbians, but it does say in the song, he is mine or something like that.

1305
01:50:24,988 --> 01:50:28,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless it's a dyke, a bull dyke, then okay, I guess that'll pass.

1306
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:29,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Transsexual.

1307
01:50:30,511 --> 01:50:36,236
[SPEAKER_12]: See, Secret Rendezvous, it doesn't take away the coolness of freestyle by having it about lesbians.

1308
01:50:36,716 --> 01:50:37,837
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes it even cooler.

1309
01:50:38,598 --> 01:50:41,781
[SPEAKER_12]: And So Fabulous, So Fierce is also another good song for freestyle.

1310
01:50:45,575 --> 01:50:52,557
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that just really goes to show how really important it is to have great commercial songs in a DDR, any kind of, like, the Monty game.

1311
01:50:52,637 --> 01:50:57,259
[SPEAKER_11]: It's those songs that you're kind of familiar with, like, A Minute or, you know, so fast.

1312
01:50:57,339 --> 01:51:02,641
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like songs from the 70s, a lot of us who, you know, grew up in that era or, like, you know, were kids and reminisce on that song.

1313
01:51:03,081 --> 01:51:06,702
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I think, you know, commercial songs, especially, you know, if America got with it, you know,

1314
01:51:07,262 --> 01:51:18,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Although we've heard from the DDR Max from E3 for America, there's going to be commercial songs on there as well, instead of Konami, which was a great mix by the way, but all Konami originals.

1315
01:51:18,574 --> 01:51:21,858
[SPEAKER_11]: This one's going to be new, it's going to have some new stuff that's never been anywhere else.

1316
01:51:22,539 --> 01:51:24,681
[SPEAKER_11]: I think KOA might be catching up.

1317
01:51:27,299 --> 01:51:29,560
[SPEAKER_16]: You think it's going to go the way of Euromex though?

1318
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:34,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I noticed there was a new little deal there where they signed, they had some Zomba record stuff.

1319
01:51:34,182 --> 01:51:37,504
[SPEAKER_16]: So does that mean we're going to get Britney in USDDR?

1320
01:51:38,624 --> 01:51:39,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Because Britney was on Zomba.

1321
01:51:40,125 --> 01:51:41,806
[SPEAKER_12]: They already have the Britney's Dance Mix.

1322
01:51:41,866 --> 01:51:43,407
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that they need to integrate it.

1323
01:51:43,627 --> 01:51:47,050
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to say for a record, Britney's Downspeed is a hard freaking game.

1324
01:51:47,630 --> 01:51:49,872
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that is a ridiculously easy game.

1325
01:51:50,092 --> 01:51:55,577
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, the hardest song probably has the equivalent difficulty of maybe a three-footer.

1326
01:51:55,737 --> 01:51:57,518
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to know why you two have been playing this game.

1327
01:51:57,558 --> 01:51:59,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, shoot yourselves now, go to hell, oh my god.

1328
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Freedom Pass from Blockbuster!

1329
01:52:02,322 --> 01:52:05,184
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I had to get it because, you know, it's ridiculously stupid.

1330
01:52:05,204 --> 01:52:08,087
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right, Brad, Britney's easy to find for all you haters out there, Brad.

1331
01:52:08,507 --> 01:52:09,368
[SPEAKER_14]: How can you live with yourself?

1332
01:52:09,388 --> 01:52:15,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you have to go up to the cash register and say, I want to rent Britney's Dance, whatever the fuck that was.

1333
01:52:17,472 --> 01:52:24,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I played it at E3 when they were demoing it, and the funny thing was, it's like, they had to challenge you in a dance pad if you get the highest score.

1334
01:52:25,016 --> 01:52:30,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only did I get the highest score, I beat the freaking guys who were demoing the game, so I thought that was just comedy in itself.

1335
01:52:32,088 --> 01:52:37,152
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing that would make me even want to get that game is my absolute love for the first two Bust a Move games.

1336
01:52:37,612 --> 01:52:44,678
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, well, I haven't necessarily played Dance Summit, but, you know, it is not Bust a Groove, it is Bust a Move, goddammit.

1337
01:52:44,738 --> 01:52:46,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, there's Spikey of the Week number three.

1338
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:55,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know, but this was from something last night, I was wearing my Bust a Groove, sorry, Bust a Move shirt, and somebody in Jamla Juice said, is that from Bust a Groove?

1339
01:52:55,626 --> 01:52:59,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I love that game, and I was like, yeah, and I called her a dork and she got all upset.

1340
01:53:01,379 --> 01:53:11,648
[SPEAKER_12]: No, um, oh, the only reason that I would buy the, uh, Britney's dance beat is so I could watch Britney Spears in skimpy outfits without having to watch it on MTV.

1341
01:53:11,668 --> 01:53:13,429
[SPEAKER_12]: It's animated, Dave.

1342
01:53:13,769 --> 01:53:16,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, it's animated video.

1343
01:53:16,932 --> 01:53:18,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Just download porn, Dave.

1344
01:53:18,373 --> 01:53:19,594
[SPEAKER_16]: Get on the net and download porn.

1345
01:53:19,674 --> 01:53:20,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I do.

1346
01:53:20,495 --> 01:53:21,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, thank you.

1347
01:53:22,675 --> 01:53:27,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we should get someone to hook you up with a copy of Final Fuck X or something.

1348
01:53:27,839 --> 01:53:31,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, she was... Your HP tastes so good.

1349
01:53:31,482 --> 01:53:35,225
[SPEAKER_09]: HP got lazy.

1350
01:53:35,926 --> 01:53:43,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, she was flipping off a lot of her fans in Mexico and stuff, and if she just keeps doing that and she loses popularity, maybe she'll turn to porn.

1351
01:53:43,672 --> 01:53:44,152
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

1352
01:53:45,193 --> 01:53:48,796
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, if she fell off the face of the planet and went the way of Mariah Carey, I'd be happy.

1353
01:53:51,704 --> 01:53:53,506
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, but the fact is, no one cares

1354
01:54:04,141 --> 01:54:05,001
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1355
01:54:25,804 --> 01:54:38,176
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the ones I got actually recently for my sim was the Metal Gear Solid theme, and I'm also very pleased to see that someone made double steps for it, so I can't wait to play that one when I get my pads working again.

1356
01:54:39,177 --> 01:54:46,003
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, definitely want to see some more stuff ported from Beatmania over, so I'm pretty excited to see what they're going to have.

1357
01:54:47,074 --> 01:55:01,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, I know one of them for sure is Overblast, because actually when I saw the trailer for Max for USA, that was the theme music they were using, and Jason Eno, who we all know is the product manager of EDR, had told me about that.

1358
01:55:02,021 --> 01:55:04,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want to see Hellscraper.

1359
01:55:05,442 --> 01:55:06,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Hellscape, whatever!

1360
01:55:07,023 --> 01:55:12,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you use that, just play Mr. Bassman on Disney Mix, man, it's fast enough and doggone it.

1361
01:55:12,565 --> 01:55:13,646
[SPEAKER_11]: That song sucks!

1362
01:55:14,767 --> 01:55:16,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, let's not call people names here, dickhead.

1363
01:55:18,548 --> 01:55:22,710
[SPEAKER_14]: No, the Hellscaper... Ducking Hardcore Mix.

1364
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:24,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, I don't really like Hellscaper that much.

1365
01:55:25,150 --> 01:55:29,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Dave, did you play the simulator he had for the steps for it?

1366
01:55:29,712 --> 01:55:30,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I did.

1367
01:55:30,572 --> 01:55:31,352
[SPEAKER_12]: It was good, man.

1368
01:55:32,113 --> 01:55:34,553
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd rather play V for the simulator something.

1369
01:55:35,434 --> 01:55:37,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Tank, that song rocked.

1370
01:55:38,155 --> 01:55:39,055
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't played that one.

1371
01:55:40,915 --> 01:55:42,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still voting for Total Recall.

1372
01:55:43,911 --> 01:55:48,795
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to throw in my vote for Baby Bay Give Me Your Love 2001, the remix that they have on Beatmania 7th Mix.

1373
01:55:48,815 --> 01:55:52,657
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the most awesomest freaking thing ever.

1374
01:55:52,757 --> 01:55:57,241
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the people who, you know, you might get a taste of Total Recall in a minute.

1375
01:55:58,842 --> 01:56:12,792
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I think that there are so many good songs, though, that, you know, you had to imagine, you know, the staff, the people who choose the songs of Konami of Japan just sitting there going, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what do we pick, what do we pick, what do we pick, what do we pick?

1376
01:56:13,376 --> 01:56:14,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's just so much good stuff.

1377
01:56:15,621 --> 01:56:18,367
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really hard to narrow it down, I think.

1378
01:56:20,063 --> 01:56:25,086
[SPEAKER_16]: I personally would like to see them, though, just instead of going back into their archive, just kind of make some new stuff up.

1379
01:56:25,306 --> 01:56:28,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Just let LED go to town and I'll be happy.

1380
01:56:28,228 --> 01:56:29,349
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine with me.

1381
01:56:29,369 --> 01:56:30,749
[SPEAKER_16]: TAC, let them go to town.

1382
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:34,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Then, you know, go visit some of those.

1383
01:56:34,111 --> 01:56:37,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Just like how in Japan they have the Dance Mania series.

1384
01:56:37,573 --> 01:56:39,635
[SPEAKER_16]: They're hooked up with Toshiba EMI and all that.

1385
01:56:39,855 --> 01:56:42,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't you let them go to town with some people that put out the compilations here?

1386
01:56:42,937 --> 01:56:46,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Like maybe the Ultimate Dance Party or the Trans Party compilations here.

1387
01:56:46,259 --> 01:56:46,999
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be pretty cool.

1388
01:56:47,059 --> 01:56:56,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if DDR just went off the Dance Mania Diamond Millennium hit by whoever's left all in one mix that one double CD all in one mix I think that would be the most greatest thing in the world

1389
01:56:58,618 --> 01:57:05,063
[SPEAKER_09]: or, you know, like they did with Parapara, hook up with Avex and throw some of the Avex stuff into DDR.

1390
01:57:06,303 --> 01:57:13,048
[SPEAKER_09]: The music that I've put out, you know, sponsored by Avex Tracks, was just some absolutely awesome stuff.

1391
01:57:13,108 --> 01:57:24,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I know this was in Disney Mix, but I'd still, I know, just for comic value, I'd like to see Night of Fire in another DDR mix with that guy Bucky in the background as the...

1392
01:57:24,475 --> 01:57:25,095
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the video.

1393
01:57:26,436 --> 01:57:27,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you weren't here for it.

1394
01:57:27,416 --> 01:57:28,837
[SPEAKER_15]: That was my VCD that I had.

1395
01:57:30,257 --> 01:57:32,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's why I was off shuffling through AX.

1396
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:34,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

1397
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:42,523
[SPEAKER_15]: They should show the one, the turn and beat around video they did where he does this little thing with his hands and blows this one chick's skirt up.

1398
01:57:42,683 --> 01:57:43,183
[SPEAKER_15]: It was great.

1399
01:57:43,503 --> 01:57:46,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that the guy whose theme music was Night of Fire every time he showed up?

1400
01:57:46,084 --> 01:57:46,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that guy rocks.

1401
01:57:46,784 --> 01:57:48,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob told me about this one.

1402
01:57:48,065 --> 01:57:50,386

[SPEAKER_16]: It's the sound part.

02:00:25,548 --> 02:00:25,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go.

1451
02:00:25,949 --> 02:00:26,389
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's try it.

02:00:27,936 --> 02:00:30,919
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:00:43,310 --> 02:00:46,953
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1456
02:00:48,154 --> 02:00:52,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, no one gives a fuck.

1457
02:00:53,417 --> 02:01:00,406
[SPEAKER_13]: And as a special bonus, because I was too fucking lazy to edit the sound file, last week's fortune cookie message of the day.

1458
02:01:00,766 --> 02:01:04,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Kids, that glue you use in school, it's made from dead horses.

1459
02:01:04,491 --> 02:01:06,954
[SPEAKER_13]: No, Wilbur, it's just a sprain.

1460
02:01:09,236 --> 02:01:12,781
