59254	61595	Kiss my grip, nooch.
61615	63956	Mecca lecca hi, mecca hi-dee-ho.
64056	66176	Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.
66396	67397	Me too!
67497	68277	Fucker, yeah?
68457	70078	I'm working on it.
70158	70578	Loser.
70738	71278	Lame!

90473	98499	Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.
98839	102661	You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.
102982	104983	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
105523	109126	Joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
110207	110687	Welcome back!
111347	113089	Yeah, I'm back, and I'm sad.
114777	116759	I am 100% glad to be back.
116879	118580	The trip was interesting to say the least.
118920	121482	And we'll definitely get into that a little bit more later, right Jamie?
121682	122043	Oh yes!
122263	122563	Alright.
123343	127467	So this is episode number 4 for July the 14th of 2002.
127607	130148	We are joined in studio once again by many, many, many guests.
130229	135973	We've got Matt, Dave, and Paul's here in the house.
136653	136853	And, um...
138208	142131	We'll be talking to all of them a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a real quick break.
142591	143992	Any other opening thoughts from you?
144472	145813	Did you say I get to break stuff?
146173	146794	Sure, if you want.
146954	148035	Just not anything I own.
148115	149175	You can break my roommate's stuff, though.
149195	149696	He's on vacation.
149776	150416	Oh, cool.
150776	152397	I think I'll just break this thing over here.
152998	153738	All right, sounds good.
154479	156920	I'm going to start off this first break with a request here.
156960	158301	Got a couple requests in our chat room.
158321	160263	Why don't you go ahead and join our chat room if you want to.
160303	162284	You just have to join irc.akeheads.org.
164185	169686	or any other side IRC chat server.
170327	173307	One of them would be also karma.othersideirc.net.
173367	175668	And then we're just in Channel Pound Orange Lounge.
175828	176588	It's just that easy.
177248	178369	I've got a few requests in here.
178389	181629	We're going to start it off with from 2DX7Style.
181669	183710	This is Dumond with Never Look Back.
275882	276564	Thanks for watching!
398584	399687	Blow my whistle baby!
399707	400790	Blow my whistle baby!
490090	499016	And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.
499436	500336	Do it all night.
500577	501457	Do it with me.
501897	503318	No, no, that was awful.
503378	504259	Bloody terrible.
504299	505640	Do you take vocal lessons?
505720	506680	Kill your teacher.
507181	508181	In the heat of the night.
508642	510863	Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
512044	512704	I liked it.
513225	514746	Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
514866	515286	Next.
516262	519943	Um, that was cool.
520984	522744	Do you even know why you're here?
522825	524505	That was just bloody pathetic.
524585	525045	Next!
527986	529427	Come on, do it with me.
530367	531608	Yes, yes, that's it!
531968	533108	We have a winner!
533929	537670	A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
538857	541402	That's right, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
541422	546331	Hey, they were saying that the old promos were getting a little old, so we had to make that new one before the show started tonight.
547734	550076	That's right, now we have new old promos to play the hell out with here.
551557	554640	Alrighty, a big hello to everybody, by the way, tonight in our chatroom.
554680	557703	We've got a pretty crowded chatroom there tonight, so thanks everybody for listening in.
557723	561146	And those last few songs were for some people that were listening in the chatroom.
561166	564388	We had Don't Look Back and The Whistle Song were both requested.
564508	567051	And I threw Jet Ningen in there too, because I know a lot of people like that one.
568492	569833	Thank you, Paul, for that lovely hooray.
569893	571194	Yes, we have a hooray from the background.
571374	573236	Speaking of The Whistle Song.
574381	575242	Very interesting.
575763	579106	I personally think it's the most interesting song in Max 2 out of anything.
579346	581408	And it was the one that probably got the biggest reaction in the chatroom.
581428	583490	People going, oh yeah, I really want to hear this song.
583530	584151	I don't know why.
584231	589236	It just really kind of gets in your mind and just messes with you to like, I hate this song.
589276	591138	This is the scrubbiest song on the face of the earth.
591198	593801	When people play this in the arcade, they sing along to it.
594101	595042	And I want to kill myself.
596560	598001	What is it about the whistle song?
598182	608070	It was weird because when it first came out, you know, when Max 2 News was first coming out, people said, oh, that song is going to be the most overplayed Max 2 song because it has the word bitch in it.
608270	610792	Then we find out they censored bitch and it just says baby.
610992	613114	I mean, unless, you know, you're looking at the banner, but whatever.
613374	614816	It says baby in the actual song.
615316	618839	And people are afraid to play it because they don't want to play it out, right?
619680	619960	I guess.
620120	620420	I don't know.
622542	623742	They all play Suguru.
624022	627144	They all play Suguru, which is not even as good as the song.
628144	630606	So then they, instead they play Suguru and play that out.
630866	640350	But no, then it's like all of a sudden somebody actually plays the whistle song and now it's like, oh, people are playing this and it's pretty cool and now the whistle song's a cool song, but now it's getting overplayed again.
640370	643071	It's frustratingly catchy, that's the thing.
643492	644372	It's just infectious.
644432	646213	It gets in my mind and it never gets out.
647914	649655	It feels like burning.
652057	660124	Any other interesting songs that you just kind of totally changed your opinion on in DDR?
660144	662366	An old school song, but love that feeling.
662927	663607	By Changmo?
663747	665029	I hated that song.
665349	666790	Everybody hated that song.
667150	671574	And then it kept coming up on my non-stops on my lovely Dreamcast edition, so I learned to like it.
672015	673236	And then I was the only one who did.
673886	674286	and right on.
674807	691777	Later on tonight we're going to be doing our very own version of Listless here and we are going to be determining the worst Bomani song in history next to Let Them Move because Let Them Move it's already given that wins it's the worst Bomani song in history we're going to determine the number two second worst Bomani song in history tonight.
692153	695740	It was officially the lowest on that list on that old survey that went on DDR Freak.
695960	696842	Do you remember that?
696922	697242	Was it?
697623	699607	I thought that it was Have You Never Been Mellow.
699847	700068	No.
700328	703694	No, Have You Never Been Mellow was ranked a good bit higher than Let Them Move.
704035	704115	Oh.
707248	708568	Love Machine wasn't even number one.
708588	717534	Yeah, see, Have You Never Been Mellow is cool because it was made just to spin around the whole time on the maniac steps.
717574	720897	You can spin the entire thing, and it's pretty fun.
721397	724359	And then you go try to step off the stage, and you fall on your ass.
724639	724979	It's funny.
725800	730543	I thought that was Butterfly, where you just go spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.
730983	732444	Butterfly has a few chops in it.
732965	733905	It can get a little scary.
735146	739149	and it's been done, you know, I don't think anyone can top what's been, it's a classic.
740650	744974	Do you think there will ever be a great butterfly routine from here on out?
745354	748637	Do you think anybody, do you think anybody has the balls to do butterfly anymore?
748737	749958	Let's just ask Kyle Snyder.
751459	754321	Nobody can do butterfly better than Kyle Snyder.
754541	759345	I put out a challenge, I want to see a fucking great, either butterfly or boom boom dollar.
759465	761927	Like somebody needs to just get old school and blow us all away.
764723	770451	I just saw one video, I don't remember, I believe it was off Music Gaming Zone.
770531	774756	It was these two Korean guys doing Boom Boom Dollar, and it was pretty awesome.
774976	782065	I mean, I've seen a lot of crappy routines from Boom Boom Dollar, but that was probably the only one that actually stood out in my mind as being good.
783386	785467	Chat room does seem to agree here.
786187	788628	Snyder owned Butterfly, and that's it.
788748	789089	The end.
789829	794151	So that's two songs he owns, because isn't he the king of Trip Machine Jungle or something like that, too?
794171	795671	He is the butterfly, no Kami-sama.
795731	796071	Right on.
796372	802414	And, oh, Corey, okay, Corey, we have Virtue in the chat room, and he says at CVGL next Saturday he will do it.
803564	806126	I will totally be there to see that.
806307	808208	I hope it's as good as the Burning Heat routine, Gloria.
808228	809209	That's all I have to say.
810810	813152	I don't know if I'm going to make it to CVGL, unfortunately.
813453	814073	I might be there.
814133	820439	But we're hoping, and this is something we want to do in the future, we're going to be taking our little kit out remote.
820519	822180	We've got some remote tape stuff.
822461	825443	And we're going to do some interviews out and about at some different tournaments and things.
825563	827925	And we'll be bringing them back to the show and playing them all for you.
827985	829467	So hopefully Jamie can get out there.
830478	832279	Let's see who wants to give Jamie a lift.
833780	835361	I'm taking donations now.
835861	843045	If I go, I will definitely take you, but I do have Under Sedation Live on Saturday night, which I committed to, so I'd have to run back early just so I can make that show.
844926	845227	Anyhow.
846207	851412	Why don't we get into Jamie's FU of the Week, because a lot of what we want to talk about today revolves around Jamie's FU of the Week.
851892	863723	So I am going to turn it over to Jamie, and she's going to give us, like she does every week, we've had to fill in for her the past few weeks because she's been gone, but she has an FU of the Week every week, and so Jamie, tell us your FU of the Week.
864504	868307	My FU of the Week has to do with Anime Expo.
868888	869749	First of all...
871113	875735	I was going expecting to see some new anime, something that I hadn't seen before.
876115	879277	They played the same crap that you can buy at Suncoast.
879937	884859	This is stuff that I've either already had for months or a couple stuff for years.
885803	887865	and it was all just this commercial crap.
888125	893970	And then I go in the dealer's room, okay, last year I was so excited, I was going to make Jungle, buy a bunch of laser discs, $5 a game.
894431	902258	They had like five laser discs that were $5, all the rest were $30, $40, which is still good for a laser disc, but still, you know, I want my $5 laser disc.
902378	904620	I walked out of AX last year with 20 laser discs.
905200	906401	This year, not a win.
906841	912243	Although, I did get this really cool little Initial D racing car thingy that's like the size of my thumb.
912363	913744	I will say that is very cool.
913864	914664	Oh, it's adorable.
914704	916765	That almost makes the whole trip worth it right there.
916865	923508	I've decided that I'm officially going to get a 1983 Toyota Corolla hatchback and paint it up like the Initial D car.
924648	927469	They had one there, and it was adorable, and I was picturing it.
927889	929689	And another thing, this is my other rant.
929749	931769	Okay, the cosplay was great.
931809	936850	There were lots of people in really awesome costumes, and I found a massive angel pictuary group.
937470	942351	But I was in my Mad Hatter costume, which if anybody wants to see, it looks like I'll find you pictures later.
942851	946552	But people kept asking me if I was doing J-Rock cosplay.
947312	949332	I'm like, no, I'm not from Malice Miser!
949593	950693	No, go away, leave me alone.
950953	952113	But I got glomped a lot, so that was cool.
953351	955894	Do explain to all of us what a glomp is, for those that don't know.
956154	958596	It's when people randomly run up to you and latch on to you.
959377	961699	Right on.
961719	965403	When you get hugged by screaming fanboys and fangirls.
965423	967304	Don't you get glomped when you play DDR, Dave?
968105	972329	Yes, I get glomped by beautiful women wearing bikinis.
973090	974131	And then you wake up!
976153	977414	Ladies love the knee drops.
978638	981120	He breaks out as no old school A-team.
981440	990588	Dave, for those that don't know, is the guy that likes to play Demon Road over at Roseville Golf Land, and he likes to do the knee drops on Paranoia while he's trying to do an Oni.
990828	991349	That is winner.
994009	997993	What's even better is for the people who can do that and actually make it through the course.
999254	999854	Freestyling.
999994	1003077	Do you think that's going to be a new trend, is freestyling the Oni courses?
1003377	1004719	It's like, what's left to do?
1005339	1006880	Yeah, I freestyle Waka Laka.
1007201	1009843	It's hard, but you can throw in a few stuff there.
1010364	1013686	Like, not much, but Paranoia definitely adds more stuff.
1013746	1017310	Like, you can spin and hand plant, knee drop, all that stuff.
1018050	1018430	Rad.
1019111	1025316	Oh, hey Dave, Virtue's challenging you in the chat room to a freestyle only.
1025976	1027557	You better back that up.
1028078	1029919	You better bring it.
1030239	1041228	I know that I definitely could not even do Demon Road at all without freestyling, but with freestyling I'd make it to at most the fifth song if I really did well.
1043267	1045628	Actually, I'd like to issue out a challenge of my own, too.
1045988	1048589	Oh, it's challenge night here on Orange Lodge.
1048609	1050249	A few people already know of this challenge.
1052890	1056991	Actually, my edit is on SoCalCakes' page right now, my DXY edit another.
1057911	1062072	For whoever full combos it or gets a 90% perfect attack, I will take them out to dinner.
1062893	1063833	And what kind of dinner?
1063973	1065713	Who will be on the course for this lovely dinner?
1065833	1067314	Sushi, of course.
1068714	1071555	Or, you know, something, you know, maybe Outback.
1073547	1074208	Yeah, I got an idea.
1074248	1075709	How about we go to Hometown Buffet?
1075729	1077390	Hometown Buffet!
1078491	1080412	The true Sacramento Cowtown way.
1080432	1081953	We're going to go Hometown Buffet!
1082013	1083214	No, no, no, no.
1083414	1084535	We will go to JJ North.
1084555	1085096	They're a little better.
1086537	1086957	They're tastier.
1087217	1088758	You know, I live right up... I have cheesecake.
1089019	1092821	The studio here is right up the street from a nice little oriental buffet.
1093262	1094923	I see Corey's comment there.
1095003	1097385	I will make sure that you get a copy of this one way or another.
1097947	1099568	Also, it is available.
1100068	1104530	I figured out finally how to update our website all nicely, so we did update the links page today.
1104851	1108552	And the very last link there leads to one of the listeners of the show, SoCalKicks.
1108592	1110473	He has a nice little page there, and it has edits on it.
1110934	1112694	And Jamie's edits are downloadable there.
1112815	1116837	He said it might be broken, but I know he'll fix it, especially after I just plugged his site here.
1116877	1118237	He'll figure out a way to fix it now.
1118257	1122339	I can also mirror those edits on SackbyMoney.com and on DarkSakura.com.
1122900	1127282	I also have another challenge attached to my Look to the Sky edit for whoever full combos it.
1127963	1129085	I'll give you a GameCube pin.
1131170	1134416	Speaking of edits, actually, I should start posting mine on my website there.
1134457	1137263	Maybe I'll post that link next week or something like that.
1140330	1140970	Sounds cool.
1141811	1148714	So going back to Anime Expo, there's a question I want to ask, and I think a lot of people want to know the answer to this.
1148894	1158920	Why is it that there seems to be this correlation between anime and DDR?
1159440	1169405	Besides the obvious that they're both from Japan, I mean, that's the obvious, why is it that a lot of people, not everybody, but I'd say a good 90% of people who love DDR love anime?
1169997	1178825	You know, I've actually found out that a lot of the people that I used to know online through my anime channels are people that are now like kind of big in the DDR world too.
1180826	1183369	Like a few people actually in Step Squad.
1184269	1184489	Right.
1184610	1188473	I knew them online before I knew them by DDR.
1190234	1191355	And by the way, hi Step Squad.
1191395	1191636	Woo!
1191816	1192036	Okay.
1192657	1192937	Anyway.
1193917	1203725	But I also, you know, I think it was really cool that actually this is one of the coolest things about AX is that AI supplied a bunch of machines for an arcade there.
1203985	1207328	They had a Max that was actually in a 1.5 cabinet.
1207968	1208368	Oh, right on.
1208388	1214893	They had Guitar Freaks 5th, Germania 4th, which I absolutely butchered my hands on.
1215534	1219137	They had a Beatmania 3rd there, the 3rd core, Beatmania 3 core.
1220963	1232049	Now, maybe I'm wrong here, because the chat room is telling me I've got SoCalKick saying he doesn't watch anime, Joe Mama says he watches maybe three animes, and Virtue says they're the same because it's Japo.
1233650	1235531	Like I said, besides the obvious, they're both from Japan.
1235751	1236631	Any comments from you guys?
1236671	1239653	What do you think about the correlation between DDR and anime?
1239693	1240073	Why is it?
1241068	1247212	The last time I watched anything that could be from Japan in cartoons was when I was in 6th grade and watched Pokemon.
1248313	1249053	Pokemon Ohms!
1249153	1249654	Oh yeah.
1250314	1251175	That was real quality.
1251435	1258359	I went to see the very first movie and I was all by myself in the theater with one of my best friends, Amanda, who plays DDR in the Bay Area, some of you might know her.
1258860	1260040	And we had so much fun.
1260381	1260781	But that's all.
1261443	1272831	I just think that some people who like DDR like anime, because lots of people who like video games are into computer nerd type people, like Matt here.
1273391	1277674	And I'm sure that he likes tons of stuff, because he spends hours and hours on the computer.
1277995	1278915	And so it's pretty fun.
1279336	1281177	That was just the most interesting face he just made.
1282031	1282991	Well, it is true.
1283051	1286813	I mean, it's been, I don't know, 20 hours a day on the computer.
1288214	1289394	Pretty close to that, at least.
1291935	1299298	The correlation between anime and DDR, I think it's just because when people are into the Japanese pop culture, they're into everything.
1299418	1302160	Anime, the music, the video games.
1302240	1304040	It's just kind of all one package deal.
1304121	1309823	So that's probably why right there is because you find a lot of crossovers with that kind of thing.
1310083	1317106	Is it kind of like similar to the correlation between the Renaissance Faire, Star Trek, and Bondage in S&M?
1321047	1328790	Well, they all have scantily clad women in them at one point or another, so then, hey, we'll play anything with boobs.
1330191	1330751	Definitely.
1333132	1335033	So, anything else you want to add on that, Jamie?
1335512	1337473	I think it's time to bring the lusty wench into the chat room.
1339013	1345756	But no, it's basically, it's just like what Matt said, I think it's the whole fan base there.
1345776	1347837	You know, you get into one, you hear about the next.
1348337	1353379	Like, my newest obsession is the whole J-Rock visual K thing, because, well, they're pretty men in makeup.
1353499	1355099	Tell me about the J-Rock obsession.
1355139	1358541	What is it about the J-Rock that's just... Because I notice it's like, you're...
1359481	1370392	For those that don't know, the Bomani Music and More program, which is on this station when we're not live, all the music, we have every week, Jamie picks a song and I pick a song to play that's not in any Bomani game, but we think it should be.
1370732	1373655	And Jamie picked a J-rock song, Luna Sea.
1373675	1374996	I'm such a whore for Luna Sea.
1375036	1379941	With Crazy For You for a Guitar Freak song, which would be a pretty damn good Guitar Freak song, I have to agree with you.
1380661	1382803	But I notice you're becoming obsessed with the J-rock lately.
1382843	1383184	What's up?
1383544	1388727	I kind of was for a little bit, and then I got really back into it during AX.
1389247	1397991	I actually bought a Hide plushie, as in Hide from X-Japan, who killed himself in a very, very controversial whole thing, but that's another story.
1398831	1403234	Anyway, I picked up a Luna C set over at AX.
1403314	1404134	There were lots of people.
1404174	1405935	There were the gacked sex kittens.
1406435	1407716	outside of the Hyatt Hotel.
1408416	1410377	So it was all over the place at AX.
1410557	1413799	Lots of people doing Mana from Malice Miser cosplay.
1414640	1419742	And I got back and just went and found all of my old MP3s and was really into it again.
1419762	1421603	It was visual K-Owns.
1425105	1426126	Corey is challenging you.
1426186	1427807	He says that Glay is better than Lunacy.
1427867	1428267	What do you think?
1428903	1430584	I'm a whore for lunacy, I'm sorry.
1430704	1432685	I love everything they've done.
1432965	1436687	Like, Rozier is my favorite song that they've done, and love song.
1436947	1437207	Right on.
1438007	1445091	Also, DarkTetsuya is reminding us that in Guitar Freak's 8th mix, which is being location tested right now, there is going to be a Gak song covered in it, so that would be pretty cool.
1445451	1448472	And also, DarkTetsuya, he's saying, what's wrong with Renaissance Terror?
1448853	1452835	There's nothing wrong with a Renaissance Terror, just like there's nothing wrong with Star Trek, and there's nothing wrong with Bondage.
1452895	1453335	It's all good.
1453895	1454616	Whatever you're into.
1455537	1457058	They all involve leather of some kind.
1457298	1460121	You've got your Klingons for your leather, your blood pie.
1460161	1460581	There you go.
1460641	1461602	It's a leather correlation.
1461682	1463704	And they are into big time S&M.
1463924	1467287	Now, do you think that anime and DDR, maybe it's the shoes?
1468588	1469108	Well, I don't know.
1469128	1471690	I've been wearing the same pair of shoes for a year.
1472231	1474133	It's the sexy nurses, exactly.
1475013	1479397	You know, it's the whole, you know, because Solo is going to make us all go to hell.
1479477	1480398	But Solo sucks anyways.
1482859	1484281	So, anything else on anime?
1484742	1489950	Well, I would probably have to say that, you know, to each their own.
1490070	1493214	Anime is a pretty, you know, versatile genre, you know.
1493235	1498022	I mean, it encompasses so much you can do anything with animation now, you know.
1498866	1505051	And DDR, you know, they've actually started having references to DDR, to Beimani in some different anime now.
1505352	1506593	I can't think of any off the top of my head.
1506993	1513959	You know, even Konami is putting their Beimani into their other games, like Tokimeki Memorial, Dancing Summer Vacation, which I have.
1515260	1516241	And other things like that.
1517842	1520945	Alright, well, if we're done with the anime topic... Oh, sure.
1520965	1521265	There's one.
1522455	1526196	Actually, many of the songs from Initial D are in Parapara.
1526577	1530078	Also, there's an anime you might be familiar with that had a promoting reference, King of the Hill.
1531158	1533839	I don't know if it counts as anime.
1533899	1536020	It's kind of more like Scribble May or something.
1536960	1538201	I'd say it's more like Scribble May.
1539281	1543683	Anywho, I'm being fed a lot of news here.
1544263	1550366	Corey Virtue is somehow in the know, and he's giving me all this news here that he wants me to share with you and get your reaction.
1550406	1555128	Not only in the chat room, but those of you here in the studio that might be hearing some of this news for the first time.
1555188	1561971	So, I'm presenting to you a little segment we call, Corey Gives Sky the News, and he reports it over the show.
1565193	1567054	Okay, so we have an eighth mix.
1568630	1575177	Apparently, if you use auto-bass, or auto-whatever, instead of giving you a perfect, it's now going to give you an auto.
1575478	1578040	And it's not going to count as part of your combo.
1578060	1579182	What do you guys think of that?
1580143	1582726	Yeah, I heard that before, but he didn't say auto-bass.
1582746	1584728	He just said, instead of perfects, you get auto.
1584808	1586209	I'm like, what the hell?
1586550	1587451	There's no perfects?
1588183	1593384	They better take the short people into account, like... Yeah, there should be a Jamie instead of me if we can get into Jamie's.
1594084	1599526	Well, no, it's like, if I'm at Spiegel, the thing is too damn tall for me to reach the damn bass pedal.
1599546	1602106	They should have a chair that comes with it that just boosts up.
1602126	1602766	Jamie Detective.
1602826	1609628	You know, for every version of Drum Mania that they put out, they need to send a free stool and a booster seat for me.
1610808	1611368	Sorry, Drum Mania 7.
1611408	1611709	Did I say 6?
1611809	1612089	My bad.
1613989	1615410	They need to make the bass pedal higher.
1616471	1617892	They need to have adjustable bass pedals.
1618233	1623897	So the new Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, they're going to have auto instead of perfect.
1623937	1624698	So that's pretty cool.
1624738	1633025	It'll give you incentive to play with the auto bass, but for those of us that are hype challenged in one way or another, we're just going to have to get more magazines or a smaller chair or something.
1634062	1639645	Also in the news, you're going to be able to set different difficulty levels for one player and two player for Guitar Freaks.
1639685	1642446	So one person can do beginner, the other can do extreme or whatever.
1643747	1648029	You can also change the difficulty of the extra stage before you enter it.
1648970	1650771	Oh, that's cool.
1650811	1655333	So you can do all your songs on Maniac and then be a chicken and do a basic extra stage or vice versa.
1655793	1659075	You just want the Maniac extra stage, just use a bunch of crappy songs to get to it.
1660814	1670562	Also, there's going to be reverse mode in it too, so you can flip it, just like DDR's reverse mode, and now the notes can come to the bottom, so it can be like Beat Guitar Mania.
1672099	1675020	That would be like, you know, rocker mode.
1675340	1685602	And also, in another Bomani Game News, I'm not sure what the source is for this, must be a Japo site or something, he says that Beatmania 3 will be the last one too.
1685642	1692723	They are going to be putting out Beatmania 3, the final as well, to correlate with the final 5 key, regular Beatmania.
1693023	1695584	That really makes sense because they hardly use the pedal anyway.
1698514	1700875	Oh, Paul's throwing his hands up behind me with the music in the background.
1700895	1701715	He's one of our hoochie mamas.
1702316	1707238	Alright, thank you very much to... So you're a hoochie mama then?
1707478	1709999	Thank you very much to Virtue for providing all that news for us.
1710419	1711579	This is what I was told to do.
1712260	1713100	I've been following through.
1713820	1714801	No one else put their hands up.
1716775	1717376	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1735072	1736133	No, it's not like that.
1736173	1744241	We're kind of the underdogs there, and it's all about the stupid swim park they have there, and the laser tag, and Beachhead 2000.
1744601	1748665	Although, Dave, tell them about your new trick for people when they're playing Beachhead 2000 for little kids.
1749326	1750327	Oh yeah, Beachhead.
1750407	1755292	I think Paul might have done this too, but I do it now a lot to little kids.
1755732	1759236	It has a counterweight to balance out the level of the...
1759935	1782293	the controller that goes on your head because it kind of does the VR virtual reality type thing where you place the controller on your head with the little two joysticks coming off the bottom and so the counterweight is behind the screen and it kind of goes and you can kind of fit back behind all the games and if you push down the counterweight then their controller that you know they've got their face
1782973	1784595	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
1798388	1799309	I think this is all in theory.
1799329	1801050	I don't know if you can give us a shot.
1802411	1804652	I actually tried it several times yesterday.
1805112	1812837	But the only problem is, since I'm behind the machine, I can't see the look on their face when they poke their head out of the VR game.
1812917	1814658	And look around going, what's going on?
1815219	1819762	What we'll do, maybe we'll take the remote out to Roseville Golf Land this Wednesday and we'll try that on some people.
1820703	1822705	Orange Lounge bloopers and practical jokes.
1823005	1824807	Orange Lounge amazing bloopers.
1824967	1826668	Smile, you're on Orange Lounge camera.
1828269	1829651	Hopefully we'll get those on the website for you.
1829671	1831252	So ways to fuck with people on Beachhead.
1831292	1833534	Have you guys figured out a way to mess with people in Sumo yet?
1833834	1845524	For those that haven't seen Sumo, it looks like you're climbing into a giant Pokeball and playing these, like on a big screen TV you've got these big plane games and stuff and the ball moves as you fly the plane.
1845544	1847986	I don't know, I still thought it was funny when someone tried to climb on top of one.
1850294	1859225	Oh yes, imagine this big red bubble with somebody piling in it, you know, going all Evangelion on somebody, and then there's somebody on top, and then there's people on the side.
1859545	1860306	They're trying to get you.
1861267	1861988	They're trying to get you!
1862108	1862689	I swear they are!
1862969	1863850	They want your brain!
1864391	1865852	But I wasn't sniffing your spicy brain.
1866653	1868916	Any other ideas on how to mess with people on other games?
1870020	1874266	No ideas yet, but I'm sure that you can just take a couple of hammers and pound on the game.
1874286	1876188	So, you know, it's like shake it back and forth.
1876228	1876969	What's going on?
1877029	1877750	I'm not losing.
1877790	1878591	I'm not getting hit.
1878911	1881335	Have someone play Gunblade and then have them try to write something.
1882476	1883217	It's a keyboard mania.
1883257	1884238	It's a rightful punishment.
1884479	1885560	We'll strike back for our home.
1885940	1887062	Our poor keyboard manias.
1887302	1895325	I want to know how to mess with the Gauntlet Legends players, because those are the ones, they're obsessive over the game as we are with ours.
1896605	1901447	I've seen people there all day long, you know, Red Valkyrie is about to die, oh, I better put in another 20 bucks.
1901567	1902727	Remember, don't shoot food.
1903502	1910564	No, see, they play it so much, they pull up the chair, and I know a couple of guys who I just watched them play it.
1910804	1918586	It's like they accidentally leave it on free play for two minutes, so they punch in 99 credits, and they sit there all day, and then whenever someone comes along, they dictate to them what to do.
1918766	1924227	It's like, okay, you go sacrifice yourself in front of the big fire-breathing dragon while I sit back and launch my little attacks.
1924867	1929133	No, but I think that we should go in all dressed up like the characters.
1929574	1933940	It's like Red Ogre has entered the building and we should just sit there playing the game.
1934461	1936865	Dressed up, it's like move aside, it's our turn to play.
1937085	1938787	Make them play the old gauntlet.
1939689	1940269	The other game.
1941631	1943332	Oh, make them play the old school gauntlet.
1943352	1944852	That old school gauntlet rules, though.
1944872	1947653	But they don't have an old school gauntlet machine at RVGL, unfortunately.
1947673	1949054	We need to have them put that in the UltraGate.
1949194	1950134	I thought of the other game.
1950274	1950935	You know what I noticed?
1950955	1956557	Is that when people make fun of you while you're playing DDR, they instantly go and play the WrestleMania game.
1956577	1960298	So I want to know how to mess with those people that are playing.
1960438	1961999	The WWF game.
1962379	1963880	The one that's right in the front as you walk in.
1963900	1964760	Go to Slim Jim's, Adam.
1964800	1965120	I don't know.
1965440	1969062	I think playing that awful WWF game in Gauntlet Legends is just punishment for now.
1969122	1970102	Until Day of Reckoning!
1970800	1971401	It'll burn!
1972222	1973043	Just come up to him.
1973303	1974405	It's like wearing a bandana.
1974685	1975767	Snap into a Slim Jim.
1976147	1977128	Oh, yeah!
1977289	1977609	Take it!
1980272	1981354	I think it's time for a break.
1981374	1981995	What do you guys think?
1983189	1984149	I get to break more stuff?
1984589	1988090	Alright, we got lots of things to celebrate in the 2DX world this week.
1988130	1990810	We have 2DX 6 Style coming out in just four more days.
1991391	1991831	Yay!
1992191	1999332	For the Japanese PlayStation 2s, so you can order your import machine and then play some 2DX at home.
1999812	2005233	Also, I'm being told that after a few weeks of downtime, 2DXStyle.net is back up and running.
2005313	2011734	So if you haven't visited them yet, go visit our links page, and they've got a link on it to 2DX Style.
2012134	2019563	and if you don't know our website, it's at orangelounge.skie.cx and visit that one too while you're at it.
2020524	2025750	So, in honor of these such momentous 2DX events, I'm going to play a whole set of 2DX songs for you.
2025770	2026631	What do you say?
2027032	2028173	I say, okay!
2028313	2029615	Alright, we'll be right back.

2775410	2779536	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
2779776	2781459	Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?
2781519	2781879	No!
2782000	2785625	Do we care what people think of us?
2785985	2788068	No!
2788108	2789530	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
2789991	2790952	Yes!
2793997	2818578	Extreme Bobani Radio That's us, Orange Lounge Radio Yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio This is episode number four for this July the 14th, 2002 A long break there of all 2DX songs We had Colors from Six Styles A from Seventh Style Cracker from Fifth Style for the home version In My Eyes, Fifth Style, Frozen Ray
2819278	2832192	from Six Style, and an old school one, Shine On, from 2DX Second Style, which the chatroom commented, uh, wanna talk as best, although I don't think it was in reference to that song, that's by Shore Eye, actually, 2DX Second Style, I might be corrected on that, though.
2833353	2839660	Anyway, we took a long break, because we were prepping for this segment that we're gonna do, which we're gonna call Listless.
2841161	2841862	That's right.
2843368	2849991	We are going to determine the worst song in Bomani history besides Let Them Move.
2850291	2855614	Let Them Move is already assumed to be the worst song in Bomani history, so that's not a factor.
2855634	2859916	We're going to determine the second worst song in Bomani history right here, so...
2861036	2866362	We've got everybody on the panel here who's written down their top three choices for worst Bomani song ever.
2866402	2868544	They've ordered it in the numbers three to one.
2869025	2871928	We're going to name off what we think the worst Bomani song is ever and why.
2872749	2874151	And after that...
2875959	2877861	We'll get to eliminate one choice from the list.
2877921	2880203	I'll have a list of 15 choices because there's five of us here.
2880483	2884727	And then each of us will get to take one choice off of the list.
2885567	2895115	And then after that, with the 10 songs that will be remaining, the chatroom gets to vote and determine what is the worst song in Bomani history next to Let Them Move.
2895135	2897257	So if you're in the chatroom right now, you'll get to participate in this.
2897277	2902522	It'll be your vote that determines what the worst song is in Bomani history next to Let Them Move.
2904122	2907187	So let's start with Jamie.
2907688	2910933	What was your number three worst Bomani song in history?
2911754	2913858	I really, really hate Let the Beat Hit Em.
2914338	2915881	Let the Beat Hit Em, all right.
2916738	2918358	I don't really care for that version.
2936884	2937204	All right.
2937625	2939686	My number three worst Mamani song in history.
2939766	2941428	I'm so going to get smacked for this.
2941768	2946412	I know I'm going to get smacked for this, but for some reason I just don't like this song when I hear it.
2946912	2948894	My number three choice is Graduistic Cyber.
2949634	2951356	It's Gradiusic Cyber.
2951436	2951856	Whatever.
2951876	2952657	It's Gradius.
2952677	2953858	That song is cool.
2953878	2954658	I'm going to kick you.
2954999	2956780	Anyway, my number
2956820	2968534	Number three pick is Bye Bye Baby Balloon because, well, they already made it like three times and then they put a new name on it and some freeze arrows and so it does not deserve to be Bulani music.
2969035	2972479	Well, it kind of does because all the other ones are the same thing, but, you know.
2974059	2974479	Yes, Paul.
2974720	2975420	Double Trouble.
2999437	3000557	Guitar Freaks Number 3 Bus Stop
3022034	3022695	That's all it is.
3022855	3023395	I agree.
3023896	3025738	The oldies in Disney's Rave.
3025818	3026459	What was that?
3026499	3028180	Why did they put all these oldies in Disney's Rave?
3028200	3029261	Mr. Bassman owns.
3029301	3030443	Okay, Mr. Bassman does own.
3030463	3030923	I'll give you that.
3031043	3032445	Mr. Bassman owns Dropout.
3033085	3035307	But Bus Stop and what's the other one that annoys the hell out of me?
3035327	3036589	There's another old school song.
3036649	3037450	Macarena.
3037510	3038250	Okay, there's that.
3038270	3038991	That's a given.
3039612	3042314	And Johnny B. Goode.
3042655	3042855	No.
3042995	3043616	That was fun.
3044381	3047584	It's something that you heard in grade school and you did during the Disney review.
3047704	3048945	It works for DDR.
3048985	3049406	I don't know.
3049966	3050286	All right.
3051327	3052889	Everybody's number threes picks are out.
3052909	3059295	We have Let the Beat Hit Em, Graduistic Cyber, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble, and Bus Stops.
3059395	3060175	Number two choices.
3060236	3060556	Jamie.
3061397	3062758	Number two would be Buell.
3064868	3081984	I hate Buell Buell is a good one, that's a good one, very good My number two choice was another 2DX song Oh, you're correcting my spelling on what he says I'm typing these out so we can see the list of what we have so we can eliminate things later
3082885	3090792	My number two choice for worst Bomani song, and I might get smacked for this because it's another 2DX song, but I really just don't like this song.
3091153	3093635	It would be Kamikaze from 2DX4Style.
3094656	3095357	I hate that song.
3096519	3098500	I've never actually heard that song.
3098921	3106464	But my number two is, I first heard it on the DDR USA, My Fire, because that song is just terrible.
3106525	3107565	You don't like My Fire.
3108125	3108586	No, I don't.
3108606	3109186	Blasphemer.
3109686	3110647	That's old school.
3110767	3111407	It's enough to be retro.
3111427	3112748	That was my favorite song back then.
3113746	3115647	Butterfly in Boom Boom Dollar Old School.
3115667	3116508	This is just crap.
3116828	3117929	This is on 1.5.
3118209	3120710	First it was cool, then it was very uncool, and now it's retro-cool.
3121091	3122512	It's gone through the cycle.
3122572	3123092	Retro-cool.
3123132	3126674	My number two is a very generic choice for a song.
3127014	3132158	It just has the diva part, it has the rap part, everything that would be characteristic in a DDR song, and it's all done badly.
3132178	3132938	Detour.
3133559	3134779	It's just a bad song.
3134819	3136921	You gotta get that on there.
3139392	3141074	Oh man, I don't know if I can top that one.
3142635	3154907	Let's see, my second pick would have to go to Chodo, I guess, from DDR Club Mix, and also his second mix, Link Version.
3155808	3160012	I don't even, that was just, it was a Laughin' Pete track, and it was just awesome.
3160072	3161534	How in the hell do you even spell that one?
3161554	3162775	I don't even think I've played that one.
3164537	3173592	Let's see here, C-H-O-T-T-O, and then the second part of it is K-I-I-N-T-E-N-A.
3175435	3176176	Bye, laugh, and peace.
3176537	3177138	And it sucks.
3179298	3187760	We're getting screamed at from the chat room for some of our number two choices, which again were Buell, Kamikaze, My Fire, D2R, and Chotokitene.
3188460	3191541	A lot of people disagree with Kamikaze.
3192281	3196822	Corey is crying because he loves D2R and doesn't understand why none of us seem to like it.
3199043	3202263	Alright, number one picks for worst Bomani song ever.
3202363	3203964	That's my vote to Strangle Politary.
3204044	3204604	I mean, sorry.
3205104	3205844	Queens, Jamaica.
3206544	3207405	Queens, Jamaica.
3207525	3207725	Wow.
3207745	3208765	I hate Queens, Jamaica.
3209600	3217142	I hate Queens, Jamaica because way back when on the old hip-hop mania machine that we had, everybody made me freaking play that song and I hate it.
3217423	3220384	And it's also on my fifth mix non-stop.
3221064	3223585	And it always comes up right after my favorite song.
3224445	3225425	So, I hate it.
3226445	3226806	Alright.
3228466	3232988	My number one choice for worst Bomani song in history besides Let Them Move would be Jam Jam Reggae.
3233648	3234748	Yum Yum Ragu.
3235168	3236789	I'm sorry, I just, it's annoying.
3236869	3236909	No.
3236949	3237369	No worries.
3238948	3239869	Whoa!
3240429	3241190	No.
3241850	3248454	Okay, um, my least favorite song is, uh, I'm going on Corey's naming because I don't know the name.
3248534	3257440	It's, uh, Under Control, which is the encore stage for long version songs for guitar, seventh mix, uh, uh, drum mania sixth mix.
3257540	3260462	And the reason why I picked it is because it's just grunge music.
3260582	3261223	It's terrible.
3261703	3264225	It belongs not in Bomani.
3264245	3268468	It belongs in, like, underground crap music that's not even made into CDs.
3269128	3271189	And I avoid playing it by failing.
3271609	3279552	I fail the extra stage, which is One Phrase Blues, which is an awesome song, just so I don't even have to hear the beginning of that song.
3279612	3280292	It's so bad.
3281213	3283834	Alright, Under Control, worst Pomani song of the day has been in.
3283934	3289436	Some really bad songs, you know, have a nice thing about them, like Detour was hilarious, the best worst song ever.
3289756	3291617	Jem Jem Reggae has some fun steps on Maniac.
3291937	3295861	But this song, I heard about it, heard it before, and it was coming in the DDR, I was like, oh, that's alright.
3296182	3303730	And I play the song, and the steps are so slow, which is an awful song in the DDR, the steps are tub-thumping, had the worst steps in the DDR, and I was so pissed about it.
3304371	3305552	God, what a bad song.
3306353	3307774	Don't think you're going to get much argument there.
3307794	3309977	Yeah, but it gets, it gets not down, but it gets up again.
3311018	3311959	You're never going to keep it down.
3313007	3316408	Alright, Matt, you're the final choice on the list.
3316929	3320010	Alright, there was just, like I said, so many to choose from.
3322030	3328333	I was going to say, now, Jam Jam Reggae, and I'm talking about the original one from Beatmania, because that one is damn awful.
3329173	3334675	But then again, there was another one from Beatmania that was also very awful, and that would be Love So Groovy.
3335075	3336176	Love So Groovy.
3336956	3338797	I hate that song, it's just awful.
3339898	3341519	That was originally one of my picks, too.
3342740	3343961	All right, so the big list here.
3344001	3344321	Here we go.
3344361	3348584	This is all 15 choices, and we're going to now eliminate one song at a time.
3348624	3363153	We have Let the Beat Hit Em, Graduistic Cyber, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble, Bus Stop, Fuel, Kamikaze, My Fire, D2R, Choto Katana, Queens, Jamaica, Jam Jam Reggae, Under Control, Tub Thumping, and Love So Groovy.
3363533	3369397	Once we get this narrowed down to 10, the chat room will get to vote on what they think is the worst song.
3370037	3372658	I think some of these songs are so bad that we never bothered to get them.
3372678	3372738	Woo!
3372898	3374118	And there was much rejoicing.
3374138	3374198	Yay!
3374238	3376139	Graduous Exciber has to come off.
3376159	3377279	That is my freaking song.
3377319	3379760	Which I finally, finally managed to beat and sing.
3398889	3400410	Alright, so it gets saved.
3401271	3403632	I, yeah, he would kill me, but he's not here, ha ha ha.
3404453	3411758	I am going to grant a pardon to I'm Sorry Dave, but Under Control is fucking hilarious, and it goes off the list.
3413379	3414500	Song's so bad.
3415241	3422466	Okay, well, then I guess I'll just have to take off Jam Jam Reggae off the list, because that song rocks on Doubles Maniac.
3422626	3422906	It's so cool.
3426432	3432319	Um, you know, it was from 1.5, and it is a cool, retro-cool song, my fire, and it's taken off the list.
3432660	3433060	I agree.
3433941	3435303	I totally agree with that one.
3435964	3443432	And I don't know about the steps in Tump Thumping, I thought it was damn easy, so I had a really cool edit for it, so I'm gonna have to take Tump Thumping off the list there.
3443452	3443572	Hey!
3443592	3443653	Hey.
3447099	3447499	I don't care.
3447659	3448260	Take it off the list.
3449480	3450741	Everybody boo Matt, please.
3452041	3453282	Yay!
3454342	3457924	Alright, so we've taken five songs off the list, and these are the ten that are left.
3458624	3472191	Let the Beat Hit Em, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble, Bus Stop, Beul, Kamikaze, D2R, Chotokatena, Queens, Jamaica, and Love So Groovy.
3473472	3474873	It's too late to add little bits.
3475053	3476114	It's too late to add songs.
3476154	3476714	There's the ten.
3476734	3477775	I just posted them in chat room.
3478035	3480877	Chat room, send me a private message, please, with your vote.
3480957	3484680	Just saying my vote is whatever for the worst Vamani song ever.
3486931	3490553	In the meantime, we're going to take a really quick break while you guys vote.
3490573	3495995	So just send me a private message in the channel saying my vote is and whatever you're picking for worst Bomani song.
3496015	3501717	And we'll tally up the votes and we'll come back and let you know the worst Bomani song in history next to Let Them Move.
3502397	3503257	You have something to say, Jamie?
3504077	3504237	No.
3504258	3505398	Okay.
3505518	3506918	I can't believe you picked Gratis Exciber.
3509939	3512140	I'm sure there's got to be a song you hate that I like.
3512460	3514101	Well, what else were you thinking of putting on your list?
3514406	3520130	Well, I did have Love So Groovy on there, and I really hate D2R.
3520430	3525574	I like the music, but I hate Politary singing, so I'd have to ask anything with her singing.
3526485	3526805	Alright.
3528648	3533154	Let's play something we talked about being over... We'll do one... Do I have... No.
3533294	3536578	Let's do some of the Max tracks.
3536598	3538060	Let's do some of the Max exclusive tracks.
3538080	3538821	People like these songs.
3538921	3542486	We're going to take a quick break here, and we'll be right back with the worst Bomani song in history.
3542526	3544248	I'm waiting for your votes in the chat room right now.
3565088	3582056	But when she caught his eye, ain't no man can fight the demon He knew he had to try to make love again Mother let him know, she was in the mood for talking So then he began to play the game Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been hurt
3606721	3625189	And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream The best thing for you, no, you can count on me, believe me And what this lady, you know what she found in me Is a lady, the kind of lady that can give you what you need Baby, the kind of lady that will never leave you lonely And what this lady, finally she found me, oh, I love you
3859515	3860375	Bitch, get a new song.
3883524	3885945	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
3886025	3888166	That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3888206	3898249	It's just after 8 o'clock, a little bit closer to 8.07 here in the middle of our fourth episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live where we are right in the middle of determining the worst song in Bomani history.
3899109	3900251	Next to Let Them Move.
3900291	3905516	Let Them Move is already a given that it's first place, so we're doing the next worst Bomani song ever.
3905856	3908519	And the votes are in.
3908799	3923053	We've asked everybody in our chatroom to vote on the list which we had, which consisted of Let The Beat Hit Them, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble, Bus Stop, Buell, Kamikaze, D2R, Choto Katana,
3923593	3926135	Queens, Jamaica, and Love So Groovy.
3926635	3927956	And we do have a winner.
3928736	3932679	In third place is Let The Beat Hit Them.
3933119	3935100	Yay!
3936221	3939403	I don't know how that corresponds to Let The Beat Hit Them, but I thought it was a funny sound file.
3940303	3944646	In second place for Worst Bomani Song Ever, Buell.
3944666	3944766	Buell.
3947216	3949899	Oh my goodness, I can't believe it.
3950320	3951521	Everything's ruined.
3951882	3954625	Everything's ruined by Buell.
3955306	3957208	Buell, the second worst Bomani song in history.
3957669	3965499	And the worst Bomani song in history, next to Let Them Move, is Bye Bye Baby Balloon.
3967915	3971380	We're just going to flush that one down the toilet and pretend it didn't exist.
3971781	3973724	Bye Bye Baby Balloon was the winner.
3974705	3975226	Loser.
3975607	3978091	Oh yeah, I guess the winner of losing.
3978131	3979433	First place loser.
3980828	3981449	It sucks so bad.
3981489	3982849	Bye-bye, Baby Balloon.
3982950	3985531	It was so bad, they didn't even put it in Max 2.
3985591	3988093	It just got taken right off of Max and flushed down the toilet.
3988133	3989294	Wait, you've got to think of it this way.
3989674	3992116	Buell sucks even more because he can't even lose right.
3992476	3994918	He has to come in second at being the worst song ever.
3995598	3996299	Good point, good point.
3996659	4000121	No, unfortunately, I do not have a drumroll sound, but I do have this.
4002063	4003984	For when Paul tells his next joke on the show.
4006215	4006695	Okay.
4008296	4010817	That's pressure.
4010877	4014358	I had this tower of vanilla Coke cans that I was building up that just fell over.
4014378	4016518	I'm surprised you guys didn't hear the sound of that.
4016558	4017819	My leaning tower of vanilla Coke.
4018159	4018479	Anyway.
4019760	4021020	Oh, I have to... Yes?
4021520	4033224	Actually, you know, for all of the songs, I think, that are so terrible, we do have to remember that because these songs are so bad, they give value to the songs that are really good.
4034264	4034664	Good point.
4035105	4035385	Good point.
4036446	4037566	So we need our bad songs.
4038027	4042090	Maybe in a future edition, do you think we'd have the balls to do the best Bomani song ever?
4042690	4043150	Oh, totally.
4043411	4043671	All right.
4043911	4046373	Then we'll do that.
4046473	4048834	Do we have the balls here at this radio station?
4048854	4052957	We've got balls bigger than anybody because they're inflatable, like our egos.
4055099	4056260	Balls of them all.
4058863	4061306	Okay, tournaments.
4061767	4063609	There were some tournaments this weekend.
4063629	4064731	There was a tournament up in Reno.
4064791	4067254	Unfortunately, none of us were able to get up there and go.
4067394	4069316	I don't even know what the results were yet, unfortunately.
4069857	4072080	But are you guys going to be going to any upcoming tournaments?
4072100	4074223	It seems like there's so many tournaments going on lately.
4075004	4076606	You think it's just because it's summertime or...
4077791	4079371	I think that's because people are bored.
4080191	4081272	So they just want to have a tournament?
4082092	4082792	Did you hear about now?
4082832	4083432	This is cool.
4083552	4086113	There's going to be a tournament at SVGL.
4086293	4090654	They're having the... I unfortunately don't recall the right name of it, but I'm sure I'll be correct in the chat room.
4090674	4092994	It's something like the DDR Royal Rumble, basically.
4093794	4098455	They're going to be having a perfect attack tournament that's kind of tied in a little bit to wrestling.
4098755	4101216	They're going to have a tag team thing, and they're going to have a rumble.
4101656	4102476	And then they're going to have...
4103556	4106177	What do you guys think about tournaments on weekdays?
4106337	4107338	It blows because people have jobs.
4107358	4110559	I can't really comment on jobs or responsibilities, but I'll be there.
4130871	4135673	Well, I can't really comment on that either, but I've got Summer School, which totally blows even more.
4136614	4138755	I don't care, Perfect Attack is boring, don't want to go.
4139415	4150340	Okay, but you have to admit though, you have to admit Matt, even though Perfect Attack is boring, the stuff they're doing with this tournament is going to make it a little more exciting, because they're going to have the music, and the big costumes, and everything, just like Rosalind.
4151755	4156898	That's just like watching that 80s show and then the final episode of that 80s show.
4157219	4160501	It's just a little bit better, but it still sucks.
4161261	4164763	No, I don't really know what this Royal Rumble they're talking about.
4165964	4168446	Everyone pile on the machine and stomp on one arrow.
4169292	4170633	No, it doesn't work like that, unfortunately.
4170673	4171894	Although that would be fun, I think.
4172194	4176697	But the way they're doing the Royal Rumble is basically you're going to draw a number randomly from 1 through 30.
4177677	4181059	And the first two people will go up, and whoever wins stays on the machine.
4181579	4190085	Now, to prevent the last person from just coming up there, say the first guy beats 29 people and then loses the last guy, that would really suck for him.
4190385	4197209	So they have this little system they're using called chips, where if you beat so many people, you get a chip, and basically it moves you back to the end of the line.
4197509	4197951	DarkSakura.com
4203288	4204268	That's a very good idea.
4204509	4205309	It is a very good idea.
4205689	4213893	I'm still wanting to have, like, you know, Guitar Freaks Drum Mania Visual K. I'm very surprised there hasn't been any kind of Drum Mania Guitar Freaks tournament.
4214473	4215813	That would be really simple to do.
4215874	4222196	Rob, if we ever do have another tournament here in Sacramento, that we have to use my idea of PA with answering trivia questions.
4222777	4228179	And whenever you get one wrong, then you get beaten with, like, some object, and the object's continually...
4228559	4230100	The Orange Bat of Doom
4258979	4273005	and, god damn, there wasn't any... That was the most boring thing ever, just waiting for freestyle to come around, just watching all the people get up on the machine, complaining that the buttons aren't working, and they have to stop, and they have to test the buttons, and the buttons were working.
4273525	4274645	It is so boring.
4275246	4284990	I mean, oh, and Folsom, when we had our SCAT tournament, I mean, it was even worse, because then you got it... You had the whole thing, you know, just packed, and then...
4286130	4286830	There's nothing to do.
4286951	4293374	But I do have to admit, at the very end of the Perfect Attack and the Folsom Tournament where they had to do the verses, that was cool.
4294254	4296356	But like I said, the rest of it sucked.
4298397	4300658	That's why this year we're not having a tourney named after feces.
4302153	4304334	No, instead we're going to find another crude word to name it after.
4304614	4307895	I notice you've got some listings here of some upcoming tournaments.
4307915	4310936	Let's see what some other local tournaments... Well, we're not just a local show.
4310976	4312576	We'll talk about some of the abroad tournaments.
4312936	4315257	It looks like there's a pretty popular tournament.
4315577	4316577	Oh, this is kind of local.
4316677	4320738	This is going to be a tournament at Mountain Mike's in Concord on August 17th.
4322279	4323139	The Dollar Mendy.
4323239	4323899	The Dollar Mendy.
4324640	4326180	And another Chinak Chinak tournament.
4326400	4329703	Which is interesting because I believe it's going to be a no-bar machine.
4329783	4335108	I don't know if they were going to take the bars off for Perfect Attack as well, but I know for Freestyle there is going to be no bar on the machine.
4335909	4338151	If I recall, I do believe that the bar will be removed.
4338331	4343797	For Perfect Attack, if it isn't removed, then if you grab the bar and you don't look like you're falling down, you'll get disqualified.
4344677	4346880	Who uses the bar for Perfect Attack anyway?
4347540	4348681	There's people who rape the bar.
4349282	4350363	That's disgusting.
4351021	4352242	I don't see it in tournaments though.
4352362	4354422	I don't think I've ever seen anyone grab the bar in a tournament.
4354562	4355343	I've seen it happen.
4355503	4355803	Really?
4356763	4362426	I mean, the only time I think I really see people grab the bar would be on fast songs.
4362586	4367388	When Dropout was first, you know, the new song to beat, everybody, all the cool kids want to beat Dropout.
4368168	4370749	Some people held the bar for that, and then of course Max and Max Unlimited.
4370989	4373170	I can't say that I've ever really held on to the bar.
4373647	4380030	I... I... When I was learning how to beat Max 300, I was using it for a while, but then I was like, you know what?
4380110	4380371	No.
4380811	4385393	I just want to do this with my feet because it doesn't seem... It doesn't seem right unless I can do it with my feet.
4385433	4387554	At Max Unlimited, I haven't allowed myself to touch the bar at all.
4387734	4394678	I'm really bad at Max 300 and Max Unlimited, but I've gotten further through them without using the bar than I have using it because it just totally throws off my center of balance.
4394898	4395138	Mm-hmm.
4395919	4398880	You know, the bar is there, I think, to catch yourself if you're falling.
4398940	4399020	Yep.
4399040	4400081	You know, for emergencies.
4400141	4400321	Yep.
4400721	4401422	You know, I...
4402242	4405326	And you know, the original solo machines, the Japanese solo machines, they don't have a bar on them.
4405947	4409771	So... Anyway, we have more tournaments.
4410212	4412935	Yeah, can you go back to that listing of tournaments there that you had up on the screen a minute?
4413996	4416059	Look at some other tournaments that seem to be pretty popular.
4417941	4420664	Use the little... There you go.
4420684	4421185	There we go.
4423345	4428428	We're having a moment while we... Okay, we're looking at some other popular looking tournaments that are coming up.
4428448	4431490	Of course, there's the big one at Castro Valley Golf Land on July 20th.
4432791	4435773	The week right after that, they're having one in Rohnert Park, Scandia.
4437915	4441977	The same day as the big Mountain Mikes in Concord, they're going to be having one in SoCal.
4442017	4443818	Now, this one's kind of a controversial tournament.
4444199	4451463	They're having the Rays Game Center tournament, and it's kind of a bit controversial because it's not DDR Drags, which is a little bit...
4452304	4454789	Kind of a constant controversy on some message boards.
4455009	4459196	I was told in no uncertain terms that when I was in San Diego I was not to go to Rays.
4460484	4462345	I guess some interesting things going on there.
4462365	4473592	I don't know if we want to get into it on the show, but apparently they've decided, the owner of the place decided to make a change with who's going to be running the tournament and not going over well with some people down there.
4474293	4478935	But they are still going to be doing a tournament on the 17th, same day as the one in Concord.
4478995	4481417	So unfortunately that's going to split things up a bit.
4481537	4485840	I know Drags 2, I went down to Drags 2, which was about a year ago, and one of the best...
4486540	4487480	Best tournaments I went to.
4487500	4488361	It was a great road trip.
4488381	4488921	It was a lot of fun.
4488961	4490622	I really like road tripping sometimes.
4492282	4493002	I had to miss it.
4493062	4494283	I was home all by myself.
4494503	4494883	Cry.
4495343	4495663	Bummer.
4496143	4496964	Can we go back to the list?
4497084	4497604	Yes, please.
4499205	4502726	When is the 17th of the 8th month?
4502826	4503746	On the 17th!
4503846	4504466	No, no, no.
4504546	4506007	Of the 8th month of the year.
4506387	4507607	Because I don't know.
4508288	4511389	I'm like Captain Not Look at Obvious Stuff.
4512489	4514450	It is a Saturday, to my knowledge, yeah.
4514850	4515231	Midwest Showdown 2
4533307	4535589	and they've got some other tournaments coming.
4535609	4537271	I don't see anything too far off the calendar.
4537291	4540854	It seems like August 17th is really the last thing that's planned.
4541354	4543917	Are the results for yesterday's tournament in Reno up there?
4543977	4546739	Why don't we go ahead and read those off if we've got them.
4548521	4549141	They might not be up yet.
4553888	4556310	Go to Dollar Mendy's Summer Vacation, no bar, in Concord.
4582446	4586008	You know, should you drive farther for a tournament that may not be good or have no bar?
4586228	4587469	And some tasty pizza.
4587489	4589750	Remember, Paul, it's a national show.
4590010	4591971	It's actually an international show.
4592191	4593732	I do have listeners in Japan.
4594092	4600456	The cool thing is on the Live365 stats, I can see where the listeners are listening from, and I do have listeners listening in from Japan, so that's pretty cool, huh?
4600536	4601376	That's pretty sweet.
4601536	4602117	They're robots.
4602637	4603197	They are robots.
4603858	4604538	All over the place.
4604578	4608100	We have listeners in Canada as well and all sorts of places now.
4608379	4609280	Poppin' Music Poppin' Music 8
4637057	4638019	I like poppin' music.
4638039	4638499	I do too.
4638699	4639701	I love poppin' music.
4639741	4640662	I think it's so cool.
4641023	4643326	But why is it that it's kind of forgotten?
4643366	4644087	You never hear it talked about?
4644950	4655277	Okay, poppin' music is just like, hey, I got an idea, let's take 2DX, lose the turntable, make all the buttons really, really big and colorful.
4655758	4656999	Wow, that sounds great.
4657539	4659520	Sounds like some kind of Fruit Roll-Ups, you know, mistake.
4659560	4660941	Like, what did we pour on the buttons?
4661001	4661762	Why are they getting so big?
4662062	4664184	But I think it's because pop music isn't in a lot of arcades.
4664444	4666866	It's more of like a novelty thing that people don't really play that much.
4667066	4669988	Poppin' music is pretty challenging, though.
4670348	4674191	I thought I could get right up and play it, and I totally failed like Cutie Honey on Adamelo 2.
4674631	4678132	Do you think it's just because the machines are so scattered amongst the U.S.?
4678172	4687594	You don't really see them in the... There's no pop-in music machines, to my knowledge, anyway, in the Bay Area, which is where, you know, the majority of your board posters come from, because it was the first area that had Bomani.
4688535	4691175	SoCal has a couple machines, Arcade Infinity.
4691335	4693536	I've been there playing... It's a fun game.
4693816	4695437	I like the ones when you have to hit four at once.
4695477	4697337	You kind of have to use your forearms to hit the buttons.
4697417	4698097	It's pretty crazy.
4698377	4699198	Yeah, karate chop!
4699718	4700118	And, um...
4701578	4705861	Also, I think they have a machine in Seattle, but they're kind of spotty, the location of the machine.
4705881	4709063	Do you think that's the only reason people look at... Sort of out of sight, out of mind.
4709504	4713866	At AI, why play poppin' music when you can play Mambo-O-Gogo?
4714167	4723193	I mean, that's all I... Because Mambo-O-Gogo has like ten songs, and once you've played them all... Personally, I find Mambo-O-Gogo to be kind of easy, personally.
4723893	4729717	Even on the hard mode, it's... You can play it with all nine of the things and get like... You can beat the hardest song on that?
4730385	4738070	I don't know if I played the hardest song, but I played Hard Mode, and it wasn't, you know, 2DX is harder for me, but I guess that's a given.
4739451	4742373	So what's the information on the, what do you want to tell us about Poppin' Music 8, Matt?
4742633	4746316	Okay, well, this information comes from BimaniStyle.com.
4747056	4749638	We've got, looks like a couple features here.
4750239	4763849	First off, there's going to be a mode called Beat Pop, which is basically, you have instead of the nice little, I guess, stuff they normally have falling down the screen, you have lines just like Beat Mania, that type of thing, kind of makes it look more like that.
4764450	4772076	They have a sort of a dark mode called Soft Discretion Line, and it just turns the indicator a little bit darker, so it's...
4775158	4778920	And then they have one that's really cool that's called Disjointed Speed Mode.
4779580	4796909	And what that is, is where, for instance, if it were to be applied to DDR, you'd have the left arrow going at 4 speed, you'd have the up arrow going at 2 speed, maybe the right arrow at 1 speed, and then maybe, I don't know, the down arrow or something at another speed.
4797149	4799610	So basically you have all the arrows going at different speeds.
4800291	4802772	Disjointed Speed sounds like some weird band name.
4803212	4804653	It would be really hard to play.
4804813	4810717	So that's kind of pretty much all the new features that are going to be coming out for that.
4811497	4816700	As far as the song list goes, there's a couple of songs coming over from different Bomani.
4817040	4819662	You've got Candy, the vocal version from Max 2.
4820342	4827587	You have, well, let's see here, Boa Boa Lady from Beatmania.
4828127	4829208	Much better than Jam Jam Reggae.
4829969	4834518	Let's see here, Linus, I think that was 2DX, Sixstyle.
4836441	4837644	Let's see here, we've got...
4841795	4842356	Jet World
4872155	4873636	Okay, driving this into the ground here.
4873656	4874136	Oh, that's all right.
4874156	4875237	When you think of it, you can let us know.
4876077	4878058	We're actually having a request, though, from the chat room.
4878458	4879779	They want an update.
4879799	4882460	Matt, you seem to be our simulator expert here.
4882940	4884161	What's going on in the sim world?
4884861	4886221	Because we haven't talked about it yet, this show.
4886301	4887462	So they want to hear what's going on.
4887768	4890229	Alright, well, some stuff going.
4891269	4898132	Right now, pretty much two things that we've been waiting for have been the new versions of Step Mania and Dance With Intensity.
4898172	4903134	Dance With Intensity, we're still waiting for them to actually release a beta of version 2.
4904074	4906515	Step Mania has been coming out with new betas.
4906555	4908916	They have beta 4 now, which is alright.
4908956	4910216	I've been trying it out.
4910236	4914418	I'm still sticking with Dance With Intensity because it loads up really fast.
4915078	4915919	and that's what I seem to like.
4916039	4922386	I'll rather have faster loading over all the, you know, kind of bonus features that they've got there.
4923166	4937381	For Step Mania, I don't know if it was just Beta 3 or just the computer that I played it on, but two-thirds of the time or more when you ever hit an up and down jump arrow or whenever you held one of the up and down jump arrows and tried to hit...
4938081	4947089	Well, held up and down arrow, or either one of them tried to hit the other one, it wouldn't register, or it would register just as like a boo or a good or something.
4947589	4952934	So I don't know if that's just on all beta 3 or just on the computer that I use.
4953642	4977537	I'm not really sure about that one but the other thing that's going to be going on is the contest that they had for the DWI contest they had put out by DDR East Coast Invasion is they're actually doing voting right now and it should have been wrapped up today according to their boards but I still haven't seen anything on that yet and the melting pot boards are still messed up
4977941	4982205	Now I am getting a rumor here that DWI2, one of the new features, is going to be a groove meter.
4982905	4983766	So that'll be pretty cool.
4983966	4984787	I wouldn't doubt it.
4984847	4992933	He's been looking for a good code for it, you know, some good source code to actually generate those, much like, you know, Stepmania has.
4993354	4994795	Really big deal.
4994855	4997257	I mean, I saw that with Stepmania 2.
4997297	5000239	I was just like, okay, so I don't look at that anyways.
5001780	5002141	Okay.
5003942	5004723	Thank you very much.
5005506	5011650	All right, we're going to take another quick break, and when we come back, we'll interact with the chat room a little more, talk about whatever they want us to talk about.
5011710	5013911	We have some other topics here that we can get into if we want.
5014611	5017793	And, God, who knows what else we're going to talk about here on Orange Lounge.
5017853	5020995	Maybe we'll just say screw Bomani, and we'll just talk about other stuff.
5021495	5021795	I don't know.
5022316	5023716	Anyway, you're listening to Orange Lounge.
5023736	5024597	How are you doing over there, Jamie?
5025618	5026338	I'm on the floor.
5026518	5027218	You're on the floor?
5027339	5028979	Do you want to kick Matt out of the chair?
5030040	5030720	Can I just kick him?
5031081	5031341	Okay.
5032023	5032363	Cool.
5032803	5034244	Or I can get you another chair if you want.
5034264	5034884	Don't worry about it.
5036285	5037685	Alright, we'll be back in a little bit.

5514381	5522224	Warning, Orange Lounge Radio's Bonnie Music and More program might be dangerous for you to listen to in the kitchen.
5522244	5532848	We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.
5533828	5537369	A friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.
5537689	5540870	That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5540930	5542371	We're here until 9 o'clock tonight.
5543391	5544792	And I'm going to turn it over to Paul.
5545473	5553519	Paul likes to do a little segment every week here, when he's here, where he's going to wrap up what's going on on the local message boards, local and abroad.
5553559	5555941	Whatever message board he wants to talk about, he's giving us the wrap-up.
5556001	5557162	So go for it, Paul.
5557282	5558302	I have to give you some music, though.
5561685	5571352	Well, on the Sacramento Money Board, there's a little action in, you know, great, being grown up, but you're obese.
5571372	5571412	Uh...
5572598	5578461	On Sacamani, we've been going over and talking about, after our crazy broken bread, we've been seeing, you know, how much stuff has been broken out in the game.
5579501	5583643	Now, since it's been us helping out, and we've decided that we're going to get a letter together.
5583763	5592948	Jessica, the Gwana girl, has gone to play in the drafts with us together, and we're going to go over it, and form a letter together, and I'll send it in, and talk about that.
5593108	5595329	And, um, so the discussion has been going on.
5598450	5601352	Some people still can't post in the right introductory thread and everything else.
5602113	5603013	That's just a little concern.
5603133	5604934	You've got to get that mic a little closer to your mouth, Paul.
5604994	5607256	It's just like you're going to shove it all in your mouth.
5607416	5608196	Take it all at once.
5608276	5608716	Take it all.
5609657	5610577	I'm just going to blow that whistle.
5610878	5613579	I'm just glad that we've been actually getting something together after complaining for so long.
5613599	5615280	So I thought we'd just note that.
5615360	5618582	Anyone who's interested should talk to people about that.
5620532	5621953	Any other boards you want to give us a lowdown on?
5622434	5624175	You know, not much has been happening too much.
5624195	5628459	A lot of boards have slowed down just because people have been divided, and I haven't been on DDR Freak in a long time.
5628479	5630000	Same old, same old on DDR Freak.
5631301	5632122	All right, so that's a wrap-up.
5632162	5632843	Same old shit.
5632863	5633283	Hooray!
5634484	5635085	Thank you, Paul.
5635365	5635885	Yay!
5638167	5643272	I'm being given a link here in the chat rooms for us to discuss, so let's just bring it up here live on air.
5644435	5645655	Rumors, rumors, rumors.
5645715	5649556	I know these have to be... These are all rumors and who knows what's going on.
5650216	5651477	Oh, this is an interesting rumor.
5651737	5656818	This kind of has to go with the message board wrap-up because this has been posted on DDR Free causing quite the stir here.
5657598	5667080	Says, Konami USA has issued a press release saying they will seize all unauthorized 5th, 6th, and 7th mixed games with the help of local law enforcement.
5668021	5671161	I'm sure I know what site they'll be looking at to find out where these machines are located.
5672562	5673302	Thoughts, people?
5674127	5676828	Well, first of all, I'd like to actually read that press release.
5676908	5677729	Is there a link on there?
5678509	5679249	There is not.
5679470	5679990	What do you know?
5680010	5681450	Hmm.
5681771	5683071	Makes one think.
5683691	5694617	You know, if someone's going to put up a rumor of that magnitude, the only way I would believe it is either, one, seeing the press release, or two, having it posted by KOA on the board.
5694717	5695017	Yep.
5695917	5701660	So, until I have, you know, legitimate proof, I call that a big pile of sticky poop.
5702420	5704581	Let's see what people are saying about that.
5705682	5707723	BS, BS, BS, BS, BS, BS.
5708844	5710184	Pretty much everybody says that's BS.
5710345	5712586	That they're going to be wasting their time and stuff.
5713066	5717248	They're claiming that Konami of America is going to make an announcement tomorrow.
5717428	5718329	So I guess we'll see.
5718729	5720670	We'll see if there's any truth to that rumor.
5720890	5722451	We'll see if miracles will ever start.
5722471	5723031	That's right.
5724690	5730015	You know, if you've seen how many people in green shirts are going around Golfland now with the racetrack and stuff, they have an evil army.
5730476	5732758	There's no way anything's getting out of there.
5733038	5735901	Would you tie yourself to the DDR machine if it was going to be taken away?
5739053	5741154	Tyne, you know, I think I'd just stick with the Guitar Breaks.
5741174	5745737	The people would be distracted, no one would be playing, I could get a few games in, it'd be alright.
5746157	5748878	I'd like to see how they're going to actually pull this off.
5748938	5754421	I mean, how many machines do we have in California alone, let alone the whole United States?
5754762	5755142	Plenty.
5755182	5758944	I mean, where the hell are they, what the hell are they going to do with those tournaments, the USA Mixes?
5759064	5764467	And they can't read the machine locations page on DDR Freak with their tiny Asian eyes, so I don't know how this is going to work out.
5765256	5765936	That's wrong.
5766136	5766757	That's wrong.
5767437	5774921	But no, you know, if they're going to do that for Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania, why not do it for DDR2?
5775001	5779303	Why not go get all those pop music machines, all five of them that we have in the country?
5780004	5783746	Or, you know, go hunt down Dance Maniacs or the like.
5783846	5785466	Or, you know, go get the Korean machines.
5785506	5786747	Why not, you know, hit them too?
5788208	5789128	Quick, they're coming.
5789188	5790389	Get the Max 2 and run.
5793170	5794271	You had something you wanted to add, Matt?
5795639	5796199	Okay, never mind.
5796579	5802901	Pretty much, we're being told in the chatroom, they pretty much agree that it seems to sound like a bunch of BS to you guys.
5803261	5803901	It's poopy!
5804322	5809363	Oh, DarkTetsuya is offering, though, if anybody wants to come play the Max 3 beta at his house before the cops take it away.
5810003	5810723	Dude, I'm there.
5812364	5813804	This is for you, DarkTetsuya.
5814925	5815165	Alright.
5816305	5818246	That sound will never get old for me, I'm sorry.
5819486	5819626	Um...
5824139	5824679	Dead Air!
5824699	5824940	Dead Air!
5851839	5856921	In two weeks on this show, on the 28th, there's about a 50-50 chance we're going to have a very special guest.
5856961	5858422	Two very special guests here that night.
5859002	5863024	I can't say who because it's not confirmed yet, but you'll definitely want to tune in to that show in two weeks.
5863104	5873669	We'll hopefully have somebody who knows Jamie and I very, very well, who's sure to bring up a lot of dirt on us, and a very famous freestyler also should be here.
5873889	5876570	You sound like you're actually promoting our show.
5876950	5877650	What's up with that?
5878230	5879251	I know, what's up with that?
5880143	5880643	DarkSakura.com
5905672	5906953	Everybody knows my email address anyway.
5908375	5909977	Your email address is accessible on the website.
5909997	5911939	All the porn people just love to send me stuff.
5915042	5917504	Okay, let's see.
5917544	5920047	What other topics do I have written down here for things we can do?
5922209	5923410	We have a hold.
5924031	5924972	Wait one second.
5927895	5928856	Let me pass the mic over.
5930822	5935563	All right, I'm just reading this off of Konami America's site, totally unrelated to what we were just talking about here.
5936563	5942745	It's talking about that this guy, John Benson and Ward Evans, are DDR fanatics.
5942905	5947046	They're creators of Dance Machine, a short film about the world's biggest DDR fan.
5947466	5952427	The movie won the coveted CLAMD or 2002 CLAMDance Film Festival.
5952467	5953328	The CLAMDance?
5954148	5955408	In Newport, Rhode Island.
5956068	5958429	So hopefully we'll never see that on video.
5958700	5959120	You know what?
5959541	5962923	If we have a DDR movie, I have a real good idea for this.
5963463	5967866	People have been making DDR players, celebrities and stuff.
5967906	5970088	I know Corey's in the chat room and he's been getting some of that.
5970108	5971769	You know Corey's screen name?
5971789	5972529	I want to talk to Corey.
5972889	5973410	People like that.
5973650	5977813	And so I think that as anyone like Mike, people have heard about this movie.
5977833	5983176	A little kid finds his shoes, becomes like Michael Jordan, starts dunking on everybody, gets in the NBA.
5983417	5986298	I want someone to find maybe like Corey's old underpants.
5986659	5987859	Let's say Corey on the name tag.
5987899	5988460	He'll put them on.
5989020	5999065	Please make me like Cory, and he'll come to the PA competition, maybe the triple threat, you know, start owning everyone, this little scrub that everyone sees playing USA, and just kills everyone, and it's a whole new phenomenon.
5999345	6002566	And then he finds out, you know, the underwear wasn't what it is, it was the magic inside.
6002806	6006088	I think that would make a good... Put down the pipe, Jesus.
6006368	6008850	Remember that old business though about DDR Freak the movie?
6009511	6009791	Yes.
6009811	6014555	With all the scripts that floated around that made it into this utter, you know, crappy teeny movie?
6014915	6015175	Uh-huh.
6015215	6018738	That would have just been, that would have been boycotting that.
6018798	6021981	I will say this on the show right now, something I haven't told anybody.
6022822	6026667	I'm writing a screenplay that involves DDR heavily.
6027348	6028209	That's all I'll say.
6028769	6030912	Oh, we have another guest who just walked into the room.
6031894	6033175	Bongo demands this.
6033275	6034777	Introduce yourself, new guest.
6035278	6036480	That's your real self.
6044475	6046797	I have a bit of a problem with that.
6047077	6048359	The big gay perilous.
6051162	6052443	Our token cross-dresser.
6054965	6055546	Oh, great.
6055586	6058669	Now I'm forever known as the absolutely gay cross-dresser.
6058749	6061893	Hey, Matt, bring up the official site for that movie thing.
6062273	6062994	Are you trying to do that?
6063754	6065156	They have a click here.
6065791	6073057	Yeah, there's some, and we're being, one person in the chat room says they did see it and they didn't like it, so your first review is a big thumbs down.
6073517	6079161	The DDR movie about the biggest DDR fan that won the Clamdance award.
6079842	6080722	There's a movie?
6082304	6082664	It's what?
6085011	6086972	www.johnandward.com We'll bring it up.
6087132	6092515	I'm even more alarmed that as opposed to there being a movie, there's a clam dance festival.
6093436	6093616	I know.
6094577	6095877	I think that's the big news here.
6095937	6097718	Not that there's a movie out, but there's a clam dance.
6097739	6103502	That just makes me think it's like some big, you know, like, lesbian gathering.
6103542	6105583	You know what brings to mind a clam dance festival?
6107404	6108545	That's what brings to mind.
6108805	6110706	Was that the sound of a dying mutant clam?
6110846	6111827	A clam opening up.
6112027	6112387	Roar!
6112407	6112487	Roar!
6116304	6119027	When you have the signal, beat like a dying camel.
6119847	6124031	We're going to take a real fast break and we're going to come back and wrap up the show because we don't have much time left.
6124091	6125333	So stay with us.
6125353	6126313	We're going to take a real quick break.
6127034	6127795	We'll be right back.
6219912	6220813	Happy New Year!
6220853	6221755	Happy New Year!
6221815	6223658	Happy New Year, everybody!
6223718	6224620	Happy New Year!
6224660	6225541	Happy New Year!
6266102	6283636	I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your everybody I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll stay to you every night I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your celebrity I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your everybody I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll be your everybody I'll be your, I'll be your, I'll stay to you every night
6299970	6310037	Happy New Year, Happy New Year, Happy New Year, Happy Wedding Happy New Year, Happy New Year, I say to you everyday Happy New Year, Happy New Year, Happy Sunset Wedding
6328232	6329435	Thank you for watching!
6424224	6433150	And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse pomani band, Erotic.
6433591	6434471	Do it all night.
6434732	6435592	Do it with me.
6436032	6437453	No, no, that was awful.
6437533	6438394	Bloody terrible.
6438454	6439775	Do you take vocal lessons?
6439855	6440836	Kill your teacher.
6441316	6442317	In the heat of the night.
6442797	6444999	Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
6446180	6446840	I liked it.
6447360	6448902	Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
6449002	6449422	Next.
6451331	6454134	Um, that was cool.
6455135	6456878	Do you even know why you're here?
6456898	6458680	That was just bloody pathetic!
6458720	6459201	Next!
6462124	6463586	Come on, do it with me.
6464527	6464727	Yes!
6465148	6465769	Yes, that's it!
6466129	6467211	We have a winner!
6468061	6471886	A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6471987	6474049	Yes, a star is born every second.
6475251	6479356	A star being born over there on the other computer in the house.
6479737	6481980	We were watching that short movie that we were referencing earlier.
6482020	6483121	What is the name of that, Matt?
6484503	6487526	Dance Machine is also proof that while every moment a star is born every moment a star explodes too
6506155	6530116	Never have I felt more sorry for mid-age men who think that they're young I've never seen a guy that old playing DDR, that's amazing There's always Kobe Hey, and Nick Nolte owns a DDR machine That's true, that's true Nick Nolte owns one and he takes lots of items too Yeah, but Nick Nolte didn't win, you know, Best Comedy He didn't win the Clam Dance Award In San Francisco, okay
6532120	6534023	The Clam Dance Award is a lesbian award.
6534564	6537228	So is he like, you know... Is it kind of like Flashdance?
6537308	6538330	What a feeling.
6541835	6543077	It's always better with clams.
6544523	6546004	And that's the quote of Ryan for the evening.
6546604	6552887	Also during that break, I took a chance to look at the newly remodeled 2DX style and I give it my seal of approval.
6552927	6553487	It's very pretty.
6553507	6557650	They have a little pretty opening movie when you go into the site and it's all nicely remodeled.
6557750	6559050	So do pay that a visit.
6559210	6561491	That's linked from our links page if you want to check that out.
6561511	6563192	2DX style gets the kudos of the evening.
6564333	6565493	We'll go buy you a candy bar, Corey.
6567114	6571057	and also 3FeetElite, who is the puppeteer.
6571137	6575861	I will go buy a box of Kudos and deliver them to you.
6576501	6579203	They have some nice forums over there.
6579484	6581605	Do you think the DDR community is too saturated with forums?
6581625	6582466	Do you think there's too many?
6585860	6586060	and so on.
6607005	6608226	And the uncles you don't talk to much.
6609027	6610968	You know, the uncles you don't talk to, they're kind of crazy.
6611528	6612429	They don't speak good English.
6613209	6616711	Yeah, and Sakmamani's just like, Yay, we're happy.
6616812	6617872	Don't flame on people.
6618032	6618813	Wee!
6618913	6620534	It's because we love everybody.
6622702	6625143	So you don't think there's just an overabundance of sites?
6625223	6628643	What about when boards shut down, like DDR spots did?
6631064	6637545	Do you think they just thought, you know, maybe this is a little much, there is a lot of boards, or, you know, I'm not on the staff, I don't know what's going on.
6638065	6640586	That's not something I feel that I can really comment on.
6640606	6647547	True, I know, we probably can't really say much about it, but I'm just kind of saying, do you think maybe it was too many boards, or...
6648075	6653137	Well, like, as far as for one purpose, okay, you know, it's hard to get used to that.
6653177	6656358	Even Ryan.
6656618	6660739	Like, sort of like the alternate board used to be GDCon, and people would talk about that and go on there eventually.
6660939	6663340	And it sort of got split between that and MonkeySpline and other network.
6663840	6667563	It's kind of good to have the big, big city, but then it's also good to have a couple little suburbs too that are fun.
6679851	6685913	My observation with the GDCoon forums is that a lot of people who were booted from DDR Freak ended up there too.
6686473	6688434	But it was still another place.
6688654	6698457	The big thing I like about having such a wide selection of forums is that you can see how their community works.
6699118	6700778	Each one of them has their own feel.
6700958	6703139	You have the one that's a little bit more irreverent.
6703439	6706020	You have your other that's more all-encompassing.
6706400	6707981	DDR Freak I think is more all-encompassing.
6708021	6709021	I really, really like that.
6710200	6714443	You know, we have our little, you know, happy inbred family at Sakumai.
6716244	6716665	Okay.
6717405	6723029	No, no, you know, we have, I think we're really getting that good sense of community.
6723069	6728452	I'm really at least hoping that, you know, a lot of the good feelings from back in the old days come back.
6729333	6731114	And we talk about porn there, too.
6731434	6732535	Yes, we talk about porn.
6732555	6734076	We have our own hentai thread, thank you.
6734356	6735217	And we're all going to YaoiCon.
6735237	6735557	YaoiCon.
6736584	6736764	Wee!
6736824	6738668	I'm not going to YaoiCon.
6738728	6741072	I don't know what you people are smoking with all the gas.
6741292	6742494	You're coming to YaoiCon.
6742514	6743015	I'm not!
6743095	6744177	We're making you dress up.
6744197	6745359	We're making you cosplay.
6745519	6746381	Alright, alright.
6746601	6748664	You get to wear the frilly black lace.
6749332	6751933	So we like lots of different forums.
6752013	6753433	It's cool to have a lot of different forums.
6753713	6757214	Everybody has their own different personality, and you just choose to hang out with the people you want to.
6758314	6760435	One other topic I wanted to bring up.
6762656	6764736	Hearing DDR songs in interesting places.
6764816	6769577	I don't necessarily mean on the radio, but do you guys ever hear DDR songs in very strange places?
6769897	6771338	Places you didn't expect to hear them at?
6771358	6771818	In the mall.
6772358	6776340	For once, I picked up this CD this week that just happened to have Ordinary World on it.
6776360	6777020	It was very odd.
6777040	6779802	It was like this trans compilation CD, and then all of a sudden there's Ordinary World.
6779862	6781883	It's like, wow, DDR in my nightmares.
6782163	6787285	This DJ at one of my school dances was playing all this bad techno music, and all of a sudden Stomp To My Beat comes up, and that's where it's taken.
6787365	6793048	Yeah, we went over this before, but Stomp To My... Why is everyone shoving two microphones in my face?
6793128	6795989	Like, I get one, and Jamie's like, here, here, take it, take it.
6796369	6796970	Get the dual voice effect.
6796990	6799691	When we were all at Brookfield, and I played Stomp To My Beat from the kitchen.
6800151	6829515	Yeah, and, um, but, we went over this a while ago, and yeah, stomped on my beat, I've heard it a while, but I think that I've listened to DDR music so much, that whenever I think I hear something, I have to take, like, a second, listen to it, because I'm not sure if it's just my mind playing tricks on me, because now I've listened to so much, and some of the stuff sounds so similar, I'm listening to Dropout, and it sounds like, yeah, I'm dead around, or something like that, it's, I, it just doesn't compute, I've listened to so much.
6830236	6848057	I think it's getting more annoying on the idea that you listen to the radio and some of this DDR stuff comes on or you have a CD where you're listening to the DDR stuff comes on you don't know which is getting pulled from which because I know Stomp to My Beat was a pretty popular techno song before it got pulled into DDR so I'm wondering if more isn't coming along those lines
6848883	6854247	It's also sad that, you know, with some of us being the ages that we are, that we actually remember the original songs.
6854287	6860351	They were like, I remember the original Sky High that was redone by DJ Miko.
6861251	6874180	And, you know, even being an anime fan, I will sit and listen to Freckles and the Japanese lyrics, like the opening to Rurouni Kenshin goes in my head, and the original Hot Limit by TM Revolution, which, by the way, everybody should listen to because it's awesome.
6874200	6874480	Yeah.
6874660	6877702	Okay, I had the weirdest thing happen.
6877983	6887470	I was watching MTV for, like, the once in, like, the last two years, and I heard Oops, I Did It Again, and it's so weird that they ripped off, like, DDR Fifth Mix.
6887490	6887970	Shut up!
6888030	6889571	Because I have no idea why.
6889591	6889651	Boo!
6890972	6893574	I mean, it's just like, whoa.
6894895	6896396	Yeah, Oops, He Did It Again.
6897217	6898218	Hey, that song was cool.
6898878	6902541	You know... Anyway... It's just, you know...
6903519	6910862	I think that not only are our lives, I guess, influenced by Behmany, but, you know, Behmany is influenced by the way that the world has been, too.
6912182	6913883	You know, the music has evolved.
6914363	6916323	And it's evolved with, you know, people's tastes.
6916363	6917544	You know, it evolves with the times.
6917624	6924026	And, you know, that's another really cool thing is that you're more likely now to hear something that's been in a Behmany game.
6924639	6924939	Mike Dornan
6952876	6954541	It's like the Mattel Chocobot Hour.
6954922	6955263	Yeah.
6957850	6958330	Any other comments?
6958730	6960351	All right, I think we're going to wrap up the show here.
6960791	6962091	Thanks to everybody for listening.
6962111	6963452	We have got a really good turnout tonight.

6972075	6974836	So we're going to do rebroadcasts Monday night at 7 o'clock.

6976756	6979257	And then at 9 o'clock, we bring you a classic show.
6979717	6984259	So we're going to go ahead and replay the first episode this week for those that missed it.
6985399	6989203	I'd like to thank all of my friends who said that they'd be listening in tonight.
6989403	6991625	And for our two listeners in Japan.

7022487	7027932	We've got all sorts of music, 2DX, DDR, everything including Dance Mania and other music games.
7029491	7035153	So now Rob, are we going to be adding that list of songs we would like to hear in Bimani?
7035293	7037794	Because I remember we were talking about that.
7038354	7042315	Yeah, a couple weeks ago we were talking about the songs that we think should be in Bimani that aren't yet.
7042675	7044696	Yeah, some of those songs do show up.
7044716	7050458	Jamie and I put in a pick a week on the music stuff and we'll be adding some of the stuff that was talked about that show also.
7050518	7053038	Who knows, perhaps we can make that a contest for the future.

7078644	7079464	I guess that's about it.
7079504	7081205	Anybody else have any closing words?

7089568	7091088	Bongo demands it.
7091788	7095290	I think that only one cuss word was said this entire show.
7096110	7096730	And I said it.
7096850	7098831	Will you care to remedy that situation then, Dave?
7099811	7104733	No, I can't copy Brad because last time he was just busting out.
7106701	7107261	Shitty Poopy.
