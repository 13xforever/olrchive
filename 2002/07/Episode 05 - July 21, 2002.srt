00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All your days are belong to us.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio may contain sexual and adult content, and many instances of the F-word, which is not safe for children.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
One, two, one, two, three, four, three, two, one.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
God damn you! Stop calling here! Isn't this 4215 pussy wave?

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You bitch! Now let me check that this goes 2, 1, 2, fuck you!

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You have no money.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You don't.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of purpose.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Kiss my grass, mooch.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Mecha lecha hi, mecha hidey ho.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Me too!

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Uh, fucker, yeah?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm working on it.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Loser.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Lame!

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
On the front of my face.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Breathing.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Breathless.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Heaving breath.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut while I go listen to my written experience

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
records.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,360
I am your singing telegram.

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,340
Somewhere inside the state of California in the great nation of the United States of America

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,520
on the planet earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,880
You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,280
My name is Rob Roberts but you might know me as Sky.

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:02:03,800
We are joined in studio once again by many, many guests.

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Say hello everybody.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Hello.

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,040
I'm going to introduce everybody one by one real fast.

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
We got Irene.

34
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Brad.

35
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
We have Brad.

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Brad.

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
We have Joe.

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Yeah.

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
We have Dave.

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
We have Matt.

41
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
Hello.

42
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
That's everybody.

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Hi.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Alright.

45
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
We have Bradley.

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Oh, Bradley's here.

47
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Finally.

48
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,960
Yes, he shows up.

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Our moral support.

50
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,040
That's probably the only time you're going to hear him the whole show.

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,440
Alright, we'll be talking to all our guests a little bit later, but first we're going

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,800
to take a very quick break.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,320
Any other opening thoughts for you, Jimmy?

54
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,040
I think that right now that I still love Bradley because he brought me a Twinbee book.

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Ooh!

56
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,560
Twinbee is ownage.

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Very neat.

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
Very neat.

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,280
I wish our webcam was working so I could show the elation here on the webcam, but unfortunately

60
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,340
if you do try to go to the webcam on our site it isn't working right now, but we will have

61
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,560
that back next week because we have a big, big show next week and we'll talk more about

62
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,780
that a little bit later.

63
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,320
I have to say happy birthday, Joe Mama, and we're going to play some music right now.

64
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,920
We're going to start it off with something Jamie requested, which I think is very cool.

65
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,220
Do you want to introduce this for us?

66
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,560
This one is, I'm sure everyone is familiar with a particular song from 2DX 3rd Style

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
by DJ Taka.

68
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
This one is remixed by Naoki. Enjoy.

69
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
You

70
00:07:48,560 --> 00:08:18,000
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

71
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
favorite perverse baumannii band, Erotic.

72
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,500
Do it all night. Do it with me.

73
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,000
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

74
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,500
Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher.

75
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,000
In the heat of the night.

76
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

77
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,500
I liked it.

78
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next.

79
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,000
Um...

80
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,500
That was cool.

81
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Do you even know why you're here?

82
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,000
But that was just bloody pathetic, next!

83
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, come on baby, come on, do it with me.

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,500
Yes, yes, that's it, we have a winner!

85
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,000
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

86
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,500
Yes, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

87
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,500
I just repeated myself, but that's okay, because I can do anything I want on this show.

88
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,000
We have the power, we control the vertical, there's no vertical or horizontal on the radio.

89
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,280
We control the audio.

90
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,640
I could drop everybody like that.

91
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,920
But we're not going to do that.

92
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,200
No, I'm not going to do that, because I notice we're actually

93
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,320
starting to get some listeners.

94
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,160
This is pretty cool.

95
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,760
I'm liking this.

96
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
And we love you all.

97
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
If you want to say hi to us, why don't you

98
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,580
come join us in our chat room?

99
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,360
You're just going to get any IRC program, like MIRC

100
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,440
is a popular one.

101
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,980
And then as your server, you're going

102
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,400
to choose any other side IRC server,

103
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,920
like IRC.eggheads.org is one.

104
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,760
or you can join

105
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,100
othersideirc.net

106
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,540
I believe it's karma.othersideirc.net

107
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,520
and all you're going to do once you get on one of those servers is join Channel Orange Lounge

108
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,860
uh... some people seem to really like some music in that set uh... the last set we

109
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,740
had 0.59 by DJ Taka but that was remixed by Naoki

110
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,240
a piano version there

111
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,020
uh... seemed to be pretty well liked

112
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,060
also after that we had a very popular drum mania song Dynamite

113
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,960
and we're playing some songs for you tonight on the show that we don't

114
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,460
normally play on our Bomani music and more, but we will be soon. That's something we're

115
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,860
going to be working on through the next week. We're going to be increasing our Bomani music

116
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,320
and more music by a lot, because a lot more of you are starting to listen to it, so we

117
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,660
think it's starting to get stale for some of you have the same songs, so we're going

118
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,980
to kind of refresh. We're going to freshen it up a little.

119
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,100
We're going to emphasize on the more. Yes. So there'll be more stuff, and you'll

120
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,740
love it, so tune in any time we're not on the air.

121
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,420
And if you don't love it, we know where you live.

122
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,900
That's right.

123
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,500
If you want to hear any part of this show being rebroadcast, join Monday nights from

124
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,300
seven o'clock until eleven o'clock.

125
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,460
We do rebroadcasts of the live Orange Lounge show.

126
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,660
We'll do from seven to nine is tonight's show, and then nine to eleven is a classic Orange

127
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,580
Lounge, which is a pretty ballsy thing to say, considering we're only on episode five.

128
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,700
Oh, but do you mean every episode's a classic?

129
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Thank you, Jamie.

130
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Well put.

131
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Yay.

132
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
All right.

133
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Yay.

134
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,500
Boy, we've just got these big egos tonight, I don't know what it is, I think it's something

135
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
in the air.

136
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,020
I don't have a big ego, I'm intensely modest.

137
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,500
It's the California heat.

138
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,100
I have some big news for the show.

139
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,300
Next week on the show, we're going to have our very first special guests.

140
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,140
Guests, not just one special guest, but two special guests here on the show next week,

141
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,140
next Sunday.

142
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,140
Yes.

143
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,220
Would you care to tell them about our lovely guests we're going to have, Jamie?

144
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,260
I don't know, do you think we should make it a surprise?

145
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,860
Well, I've already told half the people in this room, but nobody online knows, I don't think.

146
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:39,160
Well, we're actually having over Melody and Mel B,

147
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,860
and they're going to be our guests on the show, and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them, because...

148
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:51,060
Oh God, I have to move everything out and deliver, because this room's cramped as it is when we do the show here, so...

149
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,260
I'd have to say so, and quite toasty, and moist.

150
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,160
Are you feeling a little moist tonight, Chami?

151
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,800
every night on the show. As Irene makes this face.

152
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,080
Orange Lounge Radio makes a moist-as-a-snack cake.

153
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,200
It could be a squishy.

154
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,240
Anyway, yes. Uh, no.

155
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,640
So next week should be a good show because Mel B will be here to talk about

156
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,240
freestyle stuff. I don't know,

157
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,040
I don't know what we'll talk to him about. Maybe about his retirement. Didn't he retire

158
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,680
and then he kinda came back out of retirement?

159
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,120
kind of like Jordan? I don't know. We'd have to ask.

160
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,040
Okay, we'll have to ask him what's up with that. We'll ask him what's up with that.

161
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,680
And then we also have Melody, and I know a lot of you don't know Melody. She goes by

162
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,920
Sharks Girl on the online boards and stuff,

163
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,680
but she's very cool and she's a very good friend of Jamie and I, and she will

164
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,740
dig up tons of dirt on us, guaranteed.

165
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,560
She can't wait. Melody is a fantastic person to know, anyway.

166
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,280
In the chat room they're asking, wasn't Mel B one of the Spice Girls?

167
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,520
No, we're not having that Mel B on the show. God, no.

168
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:59,240
Unless I get to, you know, use her gigantic teeth for target practice.

169
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,480
This is the freestyle Mel B. I don't know what the last tournament was that he won.

170
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Do you have any idea?

171
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,600
What some of his big routines were?

172
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,480
I know he had a really good one at SCAT.

173
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,880
He had to do an improv routine to Boom Boom Dollar, which was hilarious.

174
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
There was also the Silent Hill one.

175
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,320
Does everyone know who Mel B is?

176
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,400
I don't see that.

177
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Most people, if you download videos from DDR Freak or any site that offers videos of freestyle

178
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,960
competitions from the Bay Area, you're going to probably find a MLB video.

179
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,040
I think most people are familiar with his work.

180
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,320
I can actually confirm that from people in Mississippi, in Alabama, where I was going

181
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,640
to play DDR at Boomtown, and they're like, you're from California, oh my God, do you

182
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,640
know MLB?

183
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,120
Yes.

184
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
That's what I got.

185
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,640
He's a celebrity, man, come on.

186
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,760
He's a DDR celebrity and he'll be here in house next week.

187
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,560
Do you think that's special to be a DDR celebrity?

188
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,880
Yeah, why not?

189
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,560
I'm a DDR celebrity.

190
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
And why are you a DDR celebrity?

191
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,180
Because I am.

192
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,280
There was that, wait, I can't say that name on this radio station can I, but that one

193
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:18,400
instance with this unnamed person, we don't have the name, that made her a celebrity.

194
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,880
You know, the whole Rice Princess thing.

195
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Oh yeah, whatever, whatever.

196
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
We don't need to go into that, sorry.

197
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,480
I don't mean to bring the children to a crashing halt or anything, come on.

198
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
Yeah!

199
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
But no.

200
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,720
You know, it's kind of funny though, I've noticed that if you have any sort of prominent

201
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,320
name on DDR Freak especially, people are like, oh my god, that's you!

202
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,600
Because that happened to me when I was in Mississippi!

203
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,040
They're like, alright, they got their fifth mix machine at the Boomtown Casino in Biloxi,

204
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Biloxi, Mississippi, and they had never seen a fifth mix before.

205
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,440
This is after Max II had just come out.

206
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,760
I get up on there, I play my usual thing.

207
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,400
I have this tradition where I always start off with Superstar Maniac.

208
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,960
It doesn't really matter what machine it's on.

209
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:12,000
I just played this big maniac set, and for the first time I full combo'd a dropout trick

210
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
hidden something.

211
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,760
I just was playing around.

212
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,120
And they're like, oh my God, who are you?

213
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,600
I was like, oh, well, I go by DarkSakura.

214
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
That's you?

215
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Oh my God.

216
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,920
So it's like if you have a prominent name on any of the national boards or anything

217
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,260
like that, then people know who you are and they're like, oh my God, that's you.

218
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,260
It's just really weird.

219
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,600
And then for me, they're like, you're Mormon?

220
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,600
What the hell?

221
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Yeah.

222
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,240
Sorry, our chat room is getting insanely popular, so I was opting a few people there to help

223
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,360
police the chat room when we can't take an eye on things here.

224
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,560
It is pretty big today.

225
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,560
Yes.

226
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Hello, everybody.

227
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,120
Hello, everybody in chat room.

228
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,840
Wow, we even have the...

229
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,440
Let's see who we have in the chat room today.

230
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,400
We have SoCalCakes, Jamama, we have lots of people.

231
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Wow.

232
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:16,400
It's the people who are actually here! Wow, Bradley, you're in two places at once! How special!

233
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,400
Okay.

234
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
It's your evil twin, Skippy.

235
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:30,400
I just gave ops to people that are long-time listeners to the show here, so I thought they'd be able to police alright, because they know what we do here on the show.

236
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
And just what do we do?

237
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Anyway, well, we just talk about anything Bamani and then just other crap that we feel like talking about. We'll talk about whatever we want here on the show, right?

238
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,400
We talk about it. If it exists, we can talk about it.

239
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Anyway, so we have Mel B and Melody coming next week. That's big news for the show.

240
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,400
We're going to be expanding our playlist, Other Big News for the Show.

241
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,400
We might also be starting to do some other random live things.

242
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Uh oh.

243
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,400
So we might be doing some live music programs. That's something Jamie and I have been talking about.

244
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
We'll have to see.

245
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,380
okay other big news this week this is something I wanted to do do tonight is

246
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,920
I wanted to do a special show for six style because six style was just

247
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,840
released for home this week the home version and how many of us have it on

248
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,200
order and we all have it on order that's the problem that's why we can't do a

249
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:26,300
tribute to six style tonight because nobody here has it yet none of us seem

250
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,280
to have it we know some people out there do have it thankfully but we're not

251
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,320
getting ours till mid next week so we couldn't do our six style tribute

252
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,680
However, I've got some tracks from the V-Rare 2 CD, and if you preordered stuff from Konami

253
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,000
style, then you would have gotten this special CD, this V-Rare 2 CD, which had some tracks

254
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,880
on it, and I'm going to play some of those tracks for you.

255
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,880
And rumor is that this also works as an appendisk, although I haven't had that confirmed yet,

256
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,680
so I don't know what's going to happen with that.

257
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,160
Okay, so we're going to do a tribute to 6th Style next week, because we'll have it, and

258
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
we can...

259
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,920
even more special because it will be show number six. It will be show number six.

260
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:11,280
It will be show six style, yeah. Okay.

261
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,800
So... So what else do you want to talk about? You want to take another break real fast?

262
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,120
Well, why don't we go ahead and let them

263
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,280
hear something different for a bit. Okay, let's play those songs. Let's go ahead and

264
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,000
play those songs from the V-Rare 2 CD.

265
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We're going to come back and we're going to talk about the big news this week about the

266
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,720
concerning the Konami of America coin-op division. We'll talk about that when we get back.

267
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,720
In the meantime, I'm going to play Megoo with Stick Around and L.E.D. with the Mix-Up Dungeon J.

268
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,120
And I'm having a request in the chatroom for Strong Jagger, so maybe we'll work that into. So here you go.

269
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:37,000
So many days we wasted under the sky, watching the sun go up and the color came.

270
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So many nights we ended up completely stunned

271
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Aren't you really alive that she, she's having the same thing?

272
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
With you, with you, with you

273
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
They knew me but this whole time

274
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I wanna be with you, with you, with you

275
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Wherever you are, they see you in my arms

276
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Why do we speak out loud like this?

277
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'd like to share a little more by talking

278
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
How can we keep repeating the same old lines?

279
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Who am I with any secrets for you?

280
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why do we speak out loud like this?

281
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you

282
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
How do we know we'll be together?

283
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'd rather do it this way, man

284
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

285
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So many hugs we showed every one a time I need to care what they ever thought of us

286
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So many kisses starting up a hundred sparks

287
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,500
Shedding a bite that's like the rain

288
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,000
And people who don't share the same

289
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
To you, to you, to you

290
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The world is called a disappear

291
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,000
I sit close to you, to you, to you

292
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I hear your heartbeat

293
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
In harmony with mine

294
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Why do we speak a lot like this?

295
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'd like to share the little more by talking

296
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
How can we keep repeating the same old lies?

297
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You and I, let everything disappear

298
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Why do we speak a lot like this?

299
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you

300
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
How do we know we'll be together?

301
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'll always do it the same as you

302
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Land of the wandering, land of the true

303
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Land of the woman, make her be the one

304
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So many moments, I don't want to keep my voice inside

305
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:32,240
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

306
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,240
Extreme Babati Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

307
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,160
version and an LED with a strong Jäger, as in Jägermeister, and it was exciting!

308
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
The full version.

309
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,240
I'm tingly just from hearing that song.

310
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,720
Oh, you've been moist and tingly tonight, Jamie.

311
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Yes, I feel like I have a disease.

312
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,520
I have the rakimimonia and the boogie-woogie flu.

313
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,760
Irene's got this look on her face, I'm like, dear God.

314
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,280
This show has resorted to potty jokes.

315
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,400
Okay, anyway.

316
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,640
We'd like to give our condolences to a long-time supporter of Orange Lounge Radio.

317
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,600
He's been around since the first couple episodes, that's SCK, SoCalKicks, had a website and

318
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,940
unfortunately due to some server issues, it is no more.

319
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,800
He has no website right now.

320
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,380
He can't host it anyway, so if you have any posting space that you'd like to host a cool

321
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,060
little DER website all about the SoCal scene and then some, he has a lot of information

322
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,760
about U.S. Bahmani releases, domestic Bahmani releases, he's always up to news on that kind

323
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,880
of stuff, and he has a good little edit database going, so go ahead and send us an email at

324
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,720
orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com and we'll pass it along to him.

325
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,920
I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

326
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
And you're welcome.

327
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,360
Anyway, because he's saying thank you in the chat room, so you're welcome.

328
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,560
Yes, you're very welcome.

329
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,120
You've been a long time supporter of the show.

330
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,320
You hosted my edit.

331
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
That's really cool.

332
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Yes.

333
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,880
Also, we've got some news going on.

334
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,320
yesterday was the big guy castro valley golf land tournament and uh...

335
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,920
well that kind of goes into uh... an f u of the week actually for me anyway but

336
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,120
we want to give but jamie's f u of the week

337
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,200
first so let's let jamie give her f u of the week

338
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,340
okay my f u of the week is directed towards

339
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,980
drum roll please

340
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,640
at&t

341
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,860
at&t

342
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,280
at&t

343
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,060
the only company that i've seen that has the death star as their logo

344
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,900
Yes, they are truly the evil empire.

345
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,740
I have been

346
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,060
at home unemployed now

347
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,620
happily, well not really, you know, having one. Anyway, that's off the subject.

348
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,740
Anyway, I've been sitting at home for the past, you know, week and a half trying to go online

349
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,060
and play my addiction Ragnarok online

350
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,500
only to have my cable crap out.

351
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,260
I will be sitting online

352
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,660
happily gaining levels, disconnected from the server. What?

353
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:20,340
I go downstairs, look at my little connector thing for my modem, and it's blinking lights

354
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,160
all over the place, and then it just stops.

355
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,580
So I have to hop on dial-up, then it comes back, then I have to get back on, and it does

356
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,900
this at least five times a day.

357
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,540
AT&T is truly a company run by the Antichrist.

358
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,820
Anyway, so I'm looking for a new service.

359
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,900
If anybody has good suggestions, I'm open to them.

360
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,340
AT&T just needs to die.

361
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:48,140
I also hate AT&T, because we have their cable, and they charge us way too much for it, and

362
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,140
we don't get BBC America, and we don't get M2.

363
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,540
So what am I supposed to do for watching music videos, because MTV sure as hell doesn't play

364
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
them.

365
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,540
That's for damn sure.

366
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:03,540
You know, MTV hasn't played videos since, like, the 90s began.

367
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:11,340
Well, no, they played videos up through them, because we had 120 Minutes, we had, um...

368
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:18,180
yeah but like MTV has sorority life the new reality show took place in Davis by

369
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:25,380
the way more the reason not to watch I saw when they put the rocks up on the

370
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,540
side of the hill oh is that is that what they all do by the big bridge that was a

371
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:35,540
pledge thingy now the hell with MTV I have an FU of the week as well I just

372
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,380
thought of this before the show started I decided I needed a theme song for my

373
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,380
a few of the week as well, so I just went cool.

374
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,380
Well, mine's cooler.

375
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,380
Yours is cooler, but...

376
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,380
Mine's fucked up.

377
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,380
Anyway, my issue...

378
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,380
Oh, it's being suggested that your F.U. of the Week should have been this.

379
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,380
Duploeb.

380
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,380
Yes.

381
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,380
Freakin' Duploeb.

382
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Okay.

383
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,380
I can't fuck you of the week part two.

384
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,380
Fuckin' Duploeb.

385
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,380
Fuck them right in their noses.

386
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,380
Because their ass just doesn't get it.

387
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,380
I have been working for nearly a month on DarkSakura.com

388
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:16,380
Getting my pages up. It looks really pretty. Too bad nobody else can see it.

389
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,380
Because I keep getting these emails that say, we're relocating the server. Oh, we relocated again.

390
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,380
Oh, the server's now shoved somewhere up our ass. You know, we're puking it now.

391
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,380
So, at this point, I'm not ready to say, fuck DuploWeb again.

392
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:34,380
And for the people in the chatroom who are wondering, go to www.duploweb.com and you'll see how crappy they are.

393
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:41,380
So, I'm looking for a new service for that as well. If you have suggestions, please let me know, as long as you pay for it.

394
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Okay! Can I finish? Can I finish? Can I finish?

395
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,380
No! No, my turn! I have part three, and my other fucking week goes toward my big toe.

396
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,380
No.

397
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,380
Alright. I'm gonna try to do my F.U. of the week now.

398
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,380
No.

399
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,380
If I may.

400
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,380
Oh, one more thing, one more thing.

401
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,380
Jesus Christ.

402
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:15,460
My F.U. of the week is Jamie, because she, no. My F.U. of the week is my sleep schedule,

403
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:22,700
because not only did I sleep until 3 o'clock today, I slept for 13 hours last night. I

404
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:30,800
I slept yesterday just long enough to miss CVGL completely.

405
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,480
I was going to go for a couple hours and it was great because I had my little remote kit

406
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,400
I was going to take and I was going to do interviews for this show and I was going to

407
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,160
do all this stuff and hopefully get to meet some people and get interviews with the winners

408
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
and all that stuff.

409
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:52,200
But I slept too damn much so I did not get to go to CVGL.

410
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,480
My problem is my clock, and for that I give an F you to my sleep clock.

411
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,960
We're also taking suggestions and collections to buy a new alarm clock.

412
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,160
I'm being told to get an alarm clock?

413
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
Doesn't work.

414
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
It didn't work this weekend.

415
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
I didn't have my alarm.

416
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,200
We can buy one and duct tape it to your head.

417
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:15,600
I wasn't sleeping at my own house, and that's all that needs to be said.

418
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,040
We have a suggestion from...

419
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
Irene, yes.

420
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
What is this?

421
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,960
I said take laxatives before you go to bed so you'll have to take a shit really bad in

422
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,800
the morning and you'll be forced to wake up.

423
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,960
I need to say something to Jabberwocky in the chat room.

424
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,560
I can't understand anything you're saying at all, I'm sorry.

425
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,560
Moving right along.

426
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,480
Oh yes, and a poopy pancake to you.

427
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,880
That relates, by the way, to the other show, Undersonationlive.org.

428
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,880
Listen to it.

429
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,880
It broadcasts on Saturday night.

430
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
If you like this, you'll love that.

431
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Let's talk about the winners at CVGL, because I wanted to talk about that.

432
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,880
Do you still have that up on the screen over there, Matt?

433
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
Who won?

434
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,880
I know some people that listened to this show ended up placing, so that's pretty cool.

435
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,880
We have passed the microphone now to Matt.

436
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,880
Okay, for Perfect Attack, first place went to Virtu, Corey.

437
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,880
Congratulations.

438
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
Go Corey.

439
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:16,880
Second place went to Tigger Eugene, or I hope I pronounced that right.

440
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,320
And then third place went to Emphasis.

441
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
Well you go!

442
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:27,560
And for Freestyle, let me see here real quick.

443
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:35,340
Okay third place went to Hypnotics with his secret rendezvous routine.

444
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,340
Second place went to...

445
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,340
That's a local boy!

446
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,400
Go Hypnotics!

447
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,680
Second place went to Nobody Gen for their high is off you routine.

448
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,680
And also first place went to Sweet Banana A.J. for the on jazz routine.

449
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,820
My sweet, my sweet banana.

450
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,740
Every time I hear that song I think of the abra abracadabra.

451
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,260
Have you noticed how many para para songs are rip offs of old 80 tunes that steal the

452
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,580
tunes?

453
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,300
There's that one and then there's, Irene you know some of these.

454
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,020
The para songs that sound like other normal songs.

455
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,500
The Ghostbusters song.

456
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
Which one's that?

457
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
That would be.

458
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Oh deluxe.

459
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,900
Oh, deluxe, duh duh duh duh duh duh.

460
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,900
No, that's, um, Aishimasu.

461
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,900
Aishimasu.

462
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,900
Nope.

463
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,900
Aishimasu.

464
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
Yes.

465
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,900
Uh, what else?

466
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,140
There was another one that rips off, I was thinking Highway to Hell, but that's High

467
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,260
Energy from DDR Solo, which just sounds just like Highway to Hell.

468
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,260
Well, also, they'll pick, like, like, song titles.

469
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,260
Highway to Hell!

470
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,260
What?

471
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:34,020
They'll pick song titles, too, and make up whole, you know, Eurobeat songs, like, you

472
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,220
know, Like a Virgin and, um, what was the other one that had Dulce Dance So Close to

473
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,220
Me?

474
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,220
I don't know.

475
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,220
Dulce Dance So Close?

476
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:50,140
The whole thing is that just about every song that was in Para Para was on one of the million

477
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,140
Initial D soundtracks.

478
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
And they all say fire.

479
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,140
I'm sorry?

480
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,140
I'm sorry, Ari?

481
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,140
They all say fire.

482
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,140
Yes, they all say fire.

483
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,140
Yes.

484
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,320
Gosh, PPP is a really old thing to be talking about, but actually locally it's still kind

485
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
of new to us.

486
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,180
We haven't had a machine until about two months ago, so anyway.

487
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,860
But Para Para, I don't know, it's kind of getting old for me, but whatever.

488
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:14,540
yes ron i think i have an answer to your not waking up uh... oh yes i remember

489
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,380
on that

490
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,200
tech tv on the uh... showed screensavers they reviewed an alarm clock called the

491
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,000
screaming me me one ten

492
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,080
basically it's an a hundred and ten decibel alarm clock which is the

493
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,020
equivalent to a jet although i own another no

494
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,360
my old remain with my very first roommate will i moved out of the dorms

495
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,620
in college moved into an apartment and my roommate how one of those clocks

496
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,600
it was just one of us

497
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,440
it was a clock it was an alarm clock for deaf people

498
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,420
is what it was

499
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,700
it was so loud every time I went off keep in mind my old apartment I lived

500
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,380
right by train tracks so every time a train went by

501
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,740
I could sleep right through that but I his alarm clock always woke me up it

502
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,780
sounded like a plane was landing in his room it was just like

503
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,180
it was so incredibly loud

504
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,100
you would not even believe. What was funny is also

505
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,380
they were reviewing the fact that there's Screaming Me 220

506
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,420
which I just can't imagine that.

507
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:13,420
who actually want to be deaf.

508
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,380
I could only live with that guy for six months, him and his clock.

509
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,260
Or maybe it's like for, you know, rock stars who are deaf anyway.

510
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,660
Don't you think?

511
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,140
Yeah, I just got back from the show last night. Ahh! My ear!

512
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,020
You know, like that.

513
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,180
I apologize to any speakers that were blown out by my impersonation of my

514
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:37,540
old roommate's alarm clock and he held the microphone pretty far away

515
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,900
that'll get we're having a suggestion in the chat room from pyro man saying to

516
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,060
wake up to let them move every morning that was fun that'll get you right out

517
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,700
of bed let's just go this way that won't make me get out of bed that'll make me

518
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:53,620
want to end my life the screen maybe 220 can be heard up uh up to a mile away

519
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,580
oh my god

520
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:01,580
No. No.

521
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,580
Also, in case you missed last week's show, by the way, we did determine the worst Maimani

522
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:10,580
song in history next to Let Them Move, and it was Bye Bye Baby Balloon. So Bye Bye Baby

523
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,380
Balloon will never be played on this. And this wasn't just our decision, we helped,

524
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,180
but it was the chat room that ultimately decided that Bye Bye Baby Balloon was the worst Maimani

525
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,180
song ever.

526
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,180
It's a good dimension in one of our provos.

527
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,580
It does. It does get a mention, but we, you know.

528
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,580
But we won't play the song.

529
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,580
Yeah, we won't play it.

530
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:32,580
If anyone has heard the promo, it's declared as crap, so that's why.

531
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,580
And crap stinks, so flush it.

532
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:43,580
Anyway, let's talk about another big news item. This has been the biggest news in the DDR scene in forever.

533
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,580
I'm going to read this. This was in Replay Magazine, which is an industry magazine for arcade coin-ops.

534
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,380
and they said, Konami's US coin-op office is to close.

535
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,180
The Konami of America's coin-op office in Buffalo Grove, Illinois will close its

536
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,460
doors at the end of September with future game sales being handled

537
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,760
by an as yet to be named third-party exclusive distributor in the US.

538
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,460
Factory execs in the US have yet to issue a public statement confirming the

539
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,140
move, so it is still kinda hearsay at this point, but

540
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,540
it's pretty much been widely determined. There was speculation before this news item hit

541
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,940
and now it's kinda just being more and more confirmed.

542
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:21,420
Anyway, the Japanese manufacturer, which has a consumer game office in California

543
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,940
and gaming operations in Nevada,

544
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,140
will maintain a small service department to handle support for its existing units

545
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,860
in the field,

546
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,160
like all those silent scope machines. According to what

547
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,080
Replay Magazine has so far, Konami is also expected to exhibit

548
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,540
at this fall's AMOA Expo in Las Vegas, possibly

549
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,980
with their new sales and marketing partner. And that's been a quite an

550
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,500
interesting story lately.

551
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,020
People are saying, oh, that's it, DDR is dead in the US.

552
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,220
I wouldn't go that far.

553
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,800
I think that's kind of screaming that the sky is falling.

554
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,400
It never once said that they were going to, you know, not manufacture the games 100%.

555
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,580
They have another distributor.

556
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,900
And they still don't appear to give a shit about imports, so hey, I think we're going

557
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
to be okay.

558
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,980
No, so that's another thing, Austin, to put an end to that rumor that was brought to our

559
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:14,540
attention last week too regarding them hunting down drummania machines and taking them out.

560
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,840
Go after all two copies of pop music that are in the country.

561
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,540
So we still don't know what's going to happen with DDR.

562
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,540
This could be a good thing.

563
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,800
I mean, maybe this third party distributor is going to take something like Max2, just

564
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,000
make it, you know, maybe have some, I don't know how it all works really in the industry.

565
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,660
Maybe Konami makes it better or they help make it better and then put it out.

566
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:40,020
Maybe this third-party distributor is going to listen to us really good and get some good

567
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,020
stuff.

568
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:46,260
Working at a video distributor company, a lot of the companies out there that manufacture

569
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,180
machines and distribute them, they want to cut costs and the only way they can do that

570
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,940
is not distribute them and go third-party and that way it saves on them having shipping

571
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,860
facilities and all that kind of stuff.

572
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,180
So they're going to cut costs that way.

573
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,580
It doesn't mean they're not going to make any gains, they're just going through someone

574
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:06,200
else that distribute them, which is really common in all the industries out there.

575
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,780
Do you think maybe it's possible that this third-party distributor is going to come out

576
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,820
and go, okay, we've got a problem with these imports, because we're trying to put out a

577
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,700
new USA mix here, and we've got a problem with your imports?

578
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,700
You think that might happen?

579
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
No.

580
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,140
They have nothing to say with it.

581
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:27,140
All the distributors do is take someone's game and basically sells that product to whoever.

582
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,140
That's all they do.

583
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,600
They don't do anything as far as recalling games.

584
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,700
all Konami so they're nothing but highly trained monkeys basically yes I'm

585
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:41,140
getting nodded yes and you DDR max USA not affected from what we hear so far

586
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,400
still looking to be a damn good release it's going to be the biggest home

587
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:51,020
release of DDR ever 65 something songs who knows but maybe possibly the only

588
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:54,300
thing that could be affected is any kind of arcade link who knows what happens

589
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,940
maybe they don't know what's gonna happen yeah they're still selling the

590
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:05,160
their own home games online. I mean, Konami makes, you know, a good number of

591
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,480
games. And even so, you know, they've still got, you know, like they're

592
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,480
keeping that small servicing up and, you know, they still have tons of classic

593
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,480
games out that are going to be servicing, like the Turtles in Time that Rosebud

594
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:26,560
Goffin. That game is so cool. Yes, we are geeks. But anyway, we digress. You know,

595
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,980
They've got so many games that have been released as far as arcade games that are going to need

596
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,580
that servicing in the future, so it's a good thing that they keep that office open.

597
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,780
Their distributor is not really going to be able to do much about that anyway.

598
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,500
Jabberwocky has a very good point in our chat room, saying it's not a bad move.

599
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,780
Look at the movie industry.

600
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,780
They work the exact same way, and they're pretty darn good at distributing the movies

601
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,180
to the theaters.

602
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,740
So maybe this is just going to get DDR out there even more.

603
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,740
I can even say that.

604
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:01,300
You did kind of just say the same damn thing, but you worked for, thinking about it as video

605
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,300
and thinking about the actual movies, two kind of different things, I think.

606
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,300
It's a different process.

607
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,620
I worked in the mortgage industry for two years.

608
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:14,260
A mortgage company or a bank is often going to buy out a third-party servicer to handle

609
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:20,740
loans collections because it's too much money that's going to cost them to train, to have

610
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:24,760
these people hired trained to take care of the employee base.

611
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,560
If you look at it from that standpoint as well, Konami is a corporation.

612
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,260
That's going to save them a lot of money over time and less money that they spend on actually

613
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,900
having to worry about the distribution.

614
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,000
That could be more money put into other things.

615
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,360
It sounds like all in all it's not the end of the world.

616
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,640
It could only maybe some things are going to change, but it sounds like for the most

617
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,420
part it can't be a totally bad thing.

618
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,420
It might just be better.

619
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,540
It might get DDR some more exposure.

620
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,680
They're going to hopefully do some things that Konami wasn't able to do.

621
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,640
Max USA still sounds like it's going to be pretty kick-ass.

622
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,320
That is going to be a winner.

623
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,060
20 new songs that haven't been in any mix yet.

624
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:06,400
We haven't heard anything else other than Overblast being in it and the initial song

625
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,120
list that was posted on all the big Bimani websites.

626
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,340
We're going to, as soon as we hear anything else about new Max stuff, we will not only

627
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,700
announce that on the show, we'll get those songs into rotation soon too so you can hear

628
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,060
what they sound like.

629
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,500
I think we're going to go ahead and take another quick break, and then we're going to come

630
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:28,620
back and talk about the new Euro mix, which is quite possibly what the new USA mix could

631
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,940
be, could have been, who knows.

632
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:33,780
We're going to talk about that, what the British folks and all of Europe is going to be seeing

633
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,780
pretty soon.

634
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:35,780
In the meantime, I'm going to take a quick break.

635
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:40,340
I'm going to start it off with something that the chat room has just been yelling to hear

636
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,340
played, and so we're going to hear Miracle Moon, and we're going to hear the version

637
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:49,300
of this remix by LED, just because I've got two versions, and that's the one I somewhat

638
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,380
prefer although some people are saying, play the original, play LED, play the original.

639
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,440
Well, play LED, but if you want to play the original, the original is also in rotation

640
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,780
in our Bomani Music & More show, which plays all the time when we're not doing this live

641
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:05,120
bit. And after that, we're going to hear another LED track, Mix Up Denjin J, which is another,

642
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,560
the full version we're going to hear, which is another one of these six-style hidden tracks.

643
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,080
So it's going to be somewhat of a long break, but we'll come back right about eight o'clock.

644
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:20,080
and I'll try to get to as many requests as I can before the night's up.

645
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,560
Oh, you're the answer, let's go

646
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,680
We should go back to our room, should we go?

647
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,280
We should go, should we go?

648
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,520
We could go back to our room, we should go

649
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,400
I'm the king that came up

650
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,240
He said that I can't do

651
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,080
Do you believe in love?

652
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,560
Yes, I'm the king that came up

653
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,520
I'm the king that came up

654
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,720
Yay, now it's time to die, die, die

655
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,520
No, no, no, no, no, no

656
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,520
It's time to die, die, die

657
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,520
Don't you think you can get it, go, go

658
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,020
Yay, yay, yay, yay

659
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,520
Don't you think you're leaving now?

660
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,520
There's time to stay with you

661
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,520
Oh

662
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,520
music

663
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,540
music

664
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:11,540
music

665
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:16,540
music

666
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:21,540
music

667
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,540
Oh

668
00:57:51,540 --> 00:58:04,540
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

669
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,820
the Orange Dance Way of Learning Music and More show?

670
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:14,380
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

671
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,620
It's unearthly.

672
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:20,700
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

673
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,660
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, it's like one big giant spaceship.

674
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:29,180
It's about the top of the hour, 8 o'clock, we've got one more hour of the live show for

675
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,180
you tonight.

676
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:34,940
And we want to start off this hour talking about some big news, Euromix 2 is coming out

677
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:35,940
very soon.

678
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:40,260
Matt, do you want to give us a little rundown on what's going on with Euromix 2?

679
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:47,740
Okay, well Euromix 1 was out in the UK for quite a while now, it's been using the old

680
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:54,380
third MIX engine that we're all familiar with from USA. However, it's really old, so they

681
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:59,680
decided to update their new thing. It's actually EuroMIX 2 or EuroMAX. It's probably going

682
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,660
to use either, I'm guessing, the DDR MAX 2 engine for it. One of the other things, other

683
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:12,220
than it being in a new format, the MAX 2 format, it's going to have a nice new cabinet to go

684
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:30,260
go along with it.

685
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,260
and also Zomba records.

686
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,260
Like Britney Spears' Zomba?

687
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,260
Yes. Oh, dear God.

688
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,260
But, well, it's okay.

689
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:45,260
They've got a few songs I've heard of, like 5678 by the Steps.

690
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:49,260
Oh, you know what, Matt? I actually have 5678 by Steps queued up here, so let's hear a little bit of this.

691
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,260
Aren't I good here?

692
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,260
We've got one of these songs, so here's a preview of what one of the new Euromix songs is going to be like.

693
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,260
I'm just going to play a little bit of it here for you.

694
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:03,400
Not to begin, no comedies, no comedies, no comedies

695
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,380
Kinda a little bit of repetitive here

696
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,100
Not to begin, no comedies, no comedies, no comedies

697
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,620
No, this is not the song that Billy had to dance to. That song was called tragedy

698
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:21,360
This is kinda what's on it. Probably gonna have a lot of little 12th notes in it or something

699
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,980
Well actually, it sounds much like cowgirl or something like that

700
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:37,220
That's funny because one of the other songs in there is going to be Cotton Eye Joe, which

701
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,500
is a country sounding song.

702
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,900
Yeah, Cotton Eye Joe is going to be in there.

703
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:44,700
And unfortunately it looks like Let the Move is going to be on there too.

704
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:48,260
That means that people get to hear me scream loudly.

705
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,260
I guess.

706
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,260
See.

707
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:53,220
This again, in case you missed it, playing in the background is 5, 6, 7, 8 by Steps,

708
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,060
which is going to be one of the new songs in Euromix.

709
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:59,900
Some of the other new songs will be Caribbean Queen by Billy Ocean.

710
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,660
Erin's Party, Come and Get It by Erin Carter.

711
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,740
Oh, God.

712
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:06,940
I'm wet.

713
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,540
Don't Try to Stop It by Roman Holiday.

714
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:13,940
Let's see, I Want You to Want Me by Solid Harmony.

715
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,700
Is that, I want you to want me.

716
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:20,140
Probably a cover of the old Cheap Trick song.

717
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:24,180
And the vibe is right by Ruby Turner.

718
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:29,220
And let's see, we've got Stomp also by The Steps, the same people that are doing 5, 6,

719
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,220
7, 8.

720
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,860
I bet you Steps has broken up already.

721
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,180
They broke up last year, so it's probably a similar kind of thing to like Smile DK where

722
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:38,020
they're getting all these songs from bands that have been broken up.

723
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,020
Probably.

724
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:43,420
Then we have That Is In, This Is Now by High Five.

725
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:48,580
What's pretty cool though is they've actually got a lot of the stuff from older mixes that

726
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:53,420
we don't have in our Max 2, but some of it's pretty good. They're getting some of the Max

727
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:59,880
2 stuff like Living in America and the Reflex and that kind of thing. Also, they're getting

728
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:06,880
some of the Oni songs that, you know, were in Max 2 that we aren't getting. Like Hysteria,

729
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:14,180
is one of them right? Hysteria 2001 and D4U, the KOGG3 mix. They're getting those and Spin

730
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,180
And spin the disc and all that stuff.

731
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:18,180
Brad's in the corner whining.

732
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:22,180
Also, they're going to be having some DDR Max 3 songs in there.

733
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,180
Yes, they've got some new...

734
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,180
What?

735
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,180
These are some of the new originals that we should probably expect for Max 3.

736
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,180
They have Vanity Angel by Fix.

737
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:38,180
Memories, it's a new Naoki featuring a Poly Terry song.

738
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:43,180
Then we have Crash by Mr. Brian and the Final Band.

739
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:46,260
Wait, wait, back the train the fuck up.

740
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,780
Politari is a very talented young lady, and I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate you guys

741
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,940
talking about her like that.

742
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,180
But Brad, it sucks.

743
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,180
I know.

744
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,180
She can hold a tune.

745
01:02:56,180 --> 01:03:01,260
Excuse me, the Naoki teaching Politari oni mode has got to be the best oni mode there

746
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,260
is.

747
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,260
Oni, of course.

748
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,260
Oh, here we go.

749
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,260
Hold on a minute, Brad.

750
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:06,260
Go through your little thing.

751
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,980
I have something to say about that, Brad.

752
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:08,980
Hold on just a minute.

753
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:09,980
Your digital reply.

754
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:10,980
Hold on, let's see.

755
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:11,980
I've got my reply here somewhere.

756
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:12,980
You can't browse through it.

757
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:13,980
Where is it?

758
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:14,980
Oh, yes.

759
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:15,980
Here it is.

760
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,340
Oh, that makes me feel warm inside.

761
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:23,340
Warm and squishy?

762
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:29,460
You know, there have been, I can't say that the music is bad, but Paula Terry can't hold

763
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,460
a tune.

764
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:31,460
I'll say this.

765
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:32,460
I'll say this.

766
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,460
I like Email Me.

767
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,460
That's a cool one.

768
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,540
And I like, yeah, it's Paula Terry.

769
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,340
And I like, yeah, it's Paula Terry.

770
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,700
And I like, I like Still in My Heart.

771
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,700
I do like that song.

772
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,700
But, like, Destiny? Yuck!

773
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:47,700
Okay, this is musical harassment, and I don't have to take it. I'm leaving.

774
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,700
Just go play your Game Boy. Go play your Game Boy.

775
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,700
Okay, Matt wants to give us news now. Matt, you want to talk?

776
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,700
We have news.

777
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,700
Yeah, you hate Polterra too, don't you?

778
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,700
Are you gay?

779
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,700
You take it in the ass.

780
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,700
What the hell? That was random.

781
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:06,700
Are you gay?

782
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:11,220
No, no and no.

783
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,220
Let's see here.

784
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:16,380
One of the things that they don't mention in here is Max Unlimited.

785
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,700
So probably my guess would be is they're having some sort of unlock thing.

786
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:20,700
They're just being a secret.

787
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,700
They're making a secret.

788
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:25,100
Oh yeah, it's going to be a hidden track, whoop-de-doo.

789
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:28,020
Then they're probably getting Burning Heat as another hidden track.

790
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:31,060
So they're probably going to have some hidden tracks and a similar unlock system to Max

791
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,060
2.

792
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:33,060
Hooray for them.

793
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:37,120
You know, I'm still planning on eventually one of these days making an edit for Burning

794
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:45,160
Heat and calling it Prep H. You know, I think that would be a very good, you know, title

795
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:50,160
for this test.

796
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,300
Brad went and got backups.

797
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,300
I like Politary. She's pretty cool.

798
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,300
Okay, bye.

799
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,300
That's all you're gonna do?

800
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,300
You know what?

801
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,300
Save her and fuck her!

802
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,300
Okay. Bye.

803
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:14,300
I don't know. How many people in the chatroom like Politary?

804
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,300
Well, let's take a quick vote.

805
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:21,300
Who in the chatroom likes Politary and who thinks Politary just needs to go away?

806
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:26,300
Yes, go ahead and send in your votes and we'll see what the majority says.

807
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:31,300
How many times are we going to talk about Polteri on the show?

808
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,300
How many times can I work into puking sound?

809
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:39,300
How many songs total does it look like Euromix is going to be having?

810
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:45,300
Well, let me see here.

811
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,300
A lot. I don't know.

812
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,300
You don't have to count, just kind of guess.

813
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:55,300
I believe they're supposed to have 65 songs other than...

814
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,300
Let me see here...

815
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,300
A lot?

816
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,300
Oh, stick with a lot.

817
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,300
Okay, and the chat room says,

818
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,300
Politary dies, Politary fucking owns.

819
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,300
Politary is as cool as the center of hell.

820
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:10,300
Politary sucks, if I were a redhead I'd do a rotten.

821
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:14,300
Politary is a no-talent whore, and I vote for Usama Kubota.

822
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,300
Are you still going off on Politary?

823
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:25,140
For whoever said that Politary was as cool as the center of hell, you had to have read

824
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:28,060
the Inferno if you meant that in a good way.

825
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,900
Politary is really awesome.

826
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,180
She's from Australia.

827
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,180
So is Kylie Minogue.

828
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:36,620
So is Olivia Newton-John, and she did Xanadu.

829
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,660
And Kylie Minogue is good too.

830
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,660
Yeah.

831
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:43,260
So is, wait, no, she has to say it.

832
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,260
Okay, sounds like 68.

833
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,260
68.

834
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,260
That's the word.

835
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:50,780
So I wonder, could this be some kind of example of what we could be seeing with US Max?

836
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:53,740
Because that's about how many songs are supposed to be in US Max.

837
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:59,380
Well, okay, here'd be the difference here.

838
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:05,020
Okay, US Max, some of the songs wouldn't work just right, especially when it comes to editing

839
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,020
them.

840
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:11,060
We're going to have probably a Britney Spears song in there, one or two.

841
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:16,060
I'm sure there's going to be a boy band somewhere around here.

842
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,060
Maybe Cher even.

843
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:21,060
Boycott the boy band.

844
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:30,060
Okay, first of all, I will personally write a scathing letter to Konami of America if there is any...

845
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:35,060
You know, okay, I know that there's people who like boy bands, but don't expect...

846
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:38,660
Don't expect, you know, I'm going to do exactly the same thing I did with the mix, if I did

847
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:42,580
it again in fifth mix, and never play it and go plug my ears when it's on.

848
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:47,660
We're here, somebody's been quite adamant in here, no, we will not have boy bands, so

849
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,420
somebody with some insider information there.

850
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:52,660
And then there's going to be the Let Them Trance, you know, the trance version of Let

851
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,660
Them Move, of course.

852
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,060
That was horrible, boom!

853
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:01,660
A trance version of Let Them Move.

854
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:05,500
You know, I'm going to continue to always show my support for Konami, even if, you know,

855
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,420
we happen to do get a lot of, you know, get some crappy boy bands and let them move.

856
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:14,620
You know, there are legitimately people who like those songs, although those people also

857
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:16,860
probably have had lobotomies too.

858
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:17,860
So.

859
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,720
I'm sorry, hold on.

860
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,660
Have you seen a picture of Politary?

861
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:22,660
No.

862
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:23,660
You know who she looks like?

863
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:24,660
Who?

864
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:28,180
That chick on Magnolia that's the druggie.

865
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,180
I don't remember her name.

866
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,180
Yeah, okay.

867
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,180
I know what you're talking about.

868
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:35,700
like her she's all skinny and like blonde and really like anorexic looking

869
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:40,220
and stuff and she wears really dark lipstick well thank you for that that

870
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:49,660
little hint it has been confirmed by the way by a economy of America

871
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:53,140
representative that DDR max USA will have no let them move whatsoever no

872
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:58,700
mixes no nothing now the British one is going to have let them move I mean the

873
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:03,260
to each their own that's what I always say however you know if the majority

874
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:06,740
says that we know we don't want this then I'm glad that they're finally

875
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:10,420
listening to that guys have you heard the new the new song by out phase it's

876
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:16,060
it's a new let them move remix it's awesome and out phase let them move

877
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:19,060
You think that actually might be cool, the doll face?

878
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,060
No.

879
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:25,060
Okay, so Euromix 2. Right.

880
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,060
But we love Konami.

881
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,060
Right.

882
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,060
Somebody sent me a file. I don't...

883
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,060
Oh, I got a picture. Hold on, I'm going to open this up.

884
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,060
I should not leave my file transferred.

885
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,060
No, I shouldn't even be saying that. That's on right away.

886
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,060
Uh-oh.

887
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,060
There we go, there's a picture of Paula Terry.

888
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,060
Hey, it's Paula Terry.

889
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,060
Hey.

890
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:45,060
Paula Terry looks like she wants to be a goth girl.

891
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:48,060
She does look kind of goth, don't you think?

892
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:50,060
So maybe she's slightly cool.

893
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,060
Maybe. We'll see.

894
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,060
Cool like the grave.

895
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:58,060
She needs to just maybe do some nude photography instead of singing.

896
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:01,060
And we get a yes from Brad.

897
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:05,060
Thank you for sending me that file. I appreciate it.

898
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:08,060
Pyro Man sent me that file. Thank you very much.

899
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:14,060
Thank you for the lovely picture of the lovely and not-so-talented Politary.

900
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,060
Is there any? Yes, Matt has come in.

901
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:22,060
Well, also, the new cabinet that your Mix 2 is going to have, that's actually going to be the same thing for Max 3.

902
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,060
They're upgrading, I guess, the hardware for that, too.

903
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,060
Speak it big and shiny.

904
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,060
You know what? It is about time they did that, though, don't you think?

905
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:31,060
Because Max 2, it seems like they're really pushing the limits of Max 2.

906
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:36,060
And everybody keeps saying they need to have a DDR mix that has everything in it.

907
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:43,060
They need to have a DDR mix that has every song in it that they ever did, including Strictly Business and Editor.

908
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:48,060
As long as they have a better thing for it than what was in 4th Plus, because it took forever to go through the songs on all music.

909
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:56,060
Yeah, my experience having a song list that's like huge like that, especially running my sim, I've got 800 some songs.

910
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:00,060
Going through the list to try to find what you're looking for is a real bitch.

911
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:05,060
Well, that's kind of why I like the 5th Mixing Up, you know, little navigational thing.

912
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:09,060
I mean, you can put it in alphabetical order or order by difficulty or speed or something like that.

913
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,060
That's pretty good, don't you think?

914
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:16,680
Now do you think they're actually going to call it DDR Max 3 Subtitled Dance Dance Revolution

915
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,680
A-tard Mix?

916
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,680
A-tard.

917
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,680
Oh, God.

918
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,680
A-tard.

919
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,680
We need A-tard.

920
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,680
A-tard.

921
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,480
You know like how when you beat the ONI courses it says you got to the A-tard stage?

922
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,920
Brad finally gets that joke.

923
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,560
But Brad doesn't play online much, so he doesn't.

924
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,440
I don't have the internet.

925
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,440
What's the internet?

926
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,440
Internet?

927
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,720
Oh, I invented that.

928
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,720
That's right, Brad.

929
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,720
And we're on real radio.

930
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,040
Oh, yes, Miss Al Gore down there on the floor invented the internet, yeah.

931
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,040
They're playing Polteri out there. They're playing Love Again.

932
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,040
And that's why I'm very lucky for the shows here.

933
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,040
Since we weren't cool enough to get 6th style this week, we're...

934
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,040
Polteri rules!

935
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:59,040
What's the intranet? I want one of those. I'll get me one of them.

936
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:03,040
We just got new rams today. We got more rams in my computer.

937
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:07,040
That was bad. Anyway, enough about Polteri.

938
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,040
The show's getting really lame.

939
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,040
Hitting? Hitting lame?

940
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,040
Hey, we are cool.

941
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,040
Next!

942
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,040
So, what's next on our list?

943
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,040
Oh, this is for you, Brad.

944
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,040
Anyway, that's just the Brad theme.

945
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,040
Every time Brad walks into the room, it opens his mouth.

946
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,040
I don't get it. Our Germany is broken.

947
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,040
Our symbol is broken.

948
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,040
Is that a rim job?

949
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,040
Our hi-hat is the broken one.

950
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,520
How about a report on the condition of the machines in Goughland?

951
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,860
We try to make this a big show, an international show to everybody, because we have people

952
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,680
that listen to the show in Chile, in the Dominican Republic.

953
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:51,560
We have people listening to the show, people in Japan, Japan is the third highest country

954
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,080
next to the US and Canada, and Minnesota.

955
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,720
Minnesota is part of the US, you dumbass.

956
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:04,960
Actually, for all of our international listeners, no, we're not the prime example of all Americans.

957
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,000
Americans, we're just, you know, the cool people.

958
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Yeah, we're the best ones.

959
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,320
Everybody wishes they were like us.

960
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,240
But we do sometimes, since we are kind of locally based, all the guests you see on the

961
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:22,200
show do come from the same area and play mostly at the same arcade, sometimes we like to rant

962
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,880
about our local arcades, so you want to give an update, status update on all the machines.

963
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:26,880
All right.

964
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,360
Or Mal was just there today, he can help out too.

965
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:32,480
Well, last I noticed, and please correct me if I'm wrong, last I noticed starting with

966
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,000
the farthest corner by the bathroom.

967
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,640
BeatMania or HipHopMania Complete Mix 2 is still having issues with their drop loading

968
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,520
coin flop, which they need to actually replace like the one at Milpitas Golf Land.

969
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,320
Also the screen's really tweaking out now.

970
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,320
That's to be expected.

971
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,160
The machine's been there for how long?

972
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,160
Like at least two years.

973
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,560
Yeah, it's really tweaking.

974
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:58,640
I played it from the day that they got it in, so even though I was really sucky at it.

975
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,520
Guitar Freaks is actually working.

976
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,140
The controllers seem to be fine.

977
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:09,140
was great. Drummania, the hi-hat is broken. That, for the people who don't really bother

978
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:14,460
themselves with the names of the different sensors, that is the far left symbol.

979
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:18,020
Also, Guitar Freaks is still in the CD-ROM era thing.

980
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,300
Oh it is? Are they sessioning? Did you notice?

981
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:26,140
I don't play session because it sucks. Hey, session is fun. Oh, Keyboardmania. It

982
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:31,180
looks like they finally got the keyboards replaced in time for someone to rip off the

983
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:35,180
far right key on the second controller side.

984
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,180
We will find them and murder them.

985
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:44,180
Yeah, I heard a screw was missing on one of the guitar things.

986
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:49,300
Also, with keyword mania, I guess they have been having problems with people stealing

987
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:52,060
the keys again, so they actually turned the whole machine around.

988
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:56,020
So now the front is facing where the back was and so no one can play it and no one can

989
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,020
tamper with it.

990
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:01,060
Quite honestly, I think they should do with that as they did with Guitar Freak's fifth

991
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:05,560
mix when we first got it in, and put it by the back counter so that the staff can better

992
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,560
keep an eye on it.

993
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,560
Oh, definitely.

994
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:11,060
I mean, it's not session anymore, so it doesn't really matter where it's at.

995
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:15,500
It's a little bit better to be slightly inconvenienced to walk, oh, the few feet to the back of the

996
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:20,820
building, as opposed to having them destroy a game that a lot of people really like.

997
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:26,580
Let's see, DVR USA, well, I personally don't know because I don't play it.

998
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:28,620
It seems to be working all right.

999
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:32,620
Max 2 seemed to be just fine when I was playing on it.

1000
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,620
It's still loud.

1001
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:37,620
Base is way too high and it's still eating coins every now and then.

1002
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,620
Same with Drummania starting to do that now too.

1003
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,620
That's just all that takes is maintenance and then fixing the...

1004
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:45,620
That's because they don't like to screw the coins so that's where it's supposed to be.

1005
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:47,620
Hey, just let them sit there.

1006
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:49,620
Para Para worked just fine.

1007
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:53,620
I did actually notice some sensor issues.

1008
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:56,620
It looks like one of the sides has drooped down just a little bit.

1009
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:00,760
people have been, you know, hopping up there and holding on to the thing. You know, I don't

1010
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:04,380
blame them for not being able to read the warning since it's in Japanese, but still,

1011
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:07,460
you know, they should know better. It's common sense. Unfortunately, not enough people have

1012
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,460
it.

1013
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,640
Yeah, they have, like, the swing on the bar.

1014
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:16,940
And on another note, most of the coin slots on Turtles in Time is broken. I am upset.

1015
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:17,940
That is all.

1016
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:21,180
Yes. And that's all the best news to me.

1017
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:25,740
Well, thank you for that lovely update. All right, we're going to take another quick break.

1018
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:30,900
And when we come back, we're going to talk about, why don't we go ahead and do the best

1019
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:34,140
2DX song to celebrate kind of sick style a little bit.

1020
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:37,820
We'll talk about, we'll try to narrow down what the best 2DX song in history is.

1021
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:38,820
That works for me.

1022
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:39,820
Sounds fun to you guys.

1023
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:40,820
All right.

1024
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:44,380
So we'll come back and we're going to do a little segment we call List List with the

1025
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,100
best 2DX song ever.

1026
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:50,340
And you guys in the chat room are going to be the ones that ultimately decide what it

1027
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,340
is.

1028
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,820
So get on in our chat room right away.

1029
01:16:52,820 --> 01:17:01,940
on irc.eggheads.org or karma.othersideirc.net, just any other side IRC server that you can

1030
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:07,340
think of and you're just going to join Channel Orange Lounge and you guys can help us pick

1031
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:12,380
the best 2DX song ever. And in this break we're going to hear a couple more requests

1032
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:19,380
and uh... will be right back

1033
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:22,380
Ooh, my little pretty one, pretty one When you gonna give me some time, Sharona

Such a dirty mind, I always get it up

All the time, choppin' under time

1045
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:42,380
Oh,

1046
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:49,380
oh,

1047
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:56,380
oh,

1048
01:20:56,380 --> 01:21:03,380
oh,

1049
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:05,380
I

1050
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:10,380
This is fucked up!

1051
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:36,380
and

1052
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:39,380
cause

1053
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:42,380
and

1054
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:45,380
and

1055
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:48,380
and

1056
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,380
and

1057
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:54,380
and

1058
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:57,380
and

1059
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:00,380
and

1060
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:56,460
That's right, the Swedish chef endorsing Orange Lounge Radio there.

1061
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:59,600
We tend to do a lot of very random things on this show, just to warn you.

1062
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,440
You know it's funny because a lot of people when cafe comes on they go,

1063
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:07,440
Cafe! Oh my god! I love this song! Cafe! And then, oh, it's a promo.

1064
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,440
Here we go.

1065
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,960
Now we are going to determine the best

1066
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,600
2DX song

1067
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,640
ever.

1068
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:14,780
Ever, ever, ever.

1069
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:18,120
And to do that we're going to do a little segment we call List List.

1070
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:23,840
And participating today in the List List segment will be myself, Jamie, Matt,

1071
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,600
Joe,

1072
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,700
Bradley, and uh... Brad and Irene,

1073
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:29,220
So Sarah Koppel, they're basically essentially one person,

1074
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:31,680
so they'll be doing one big list as one person.

1075
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,380
And what we're going to do is each of us

1076
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:36,180
are going to name off our top three songs.

1077
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:38,700
And then we get to go around, and everybody

1078
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:42,420
will get to eliminate one song from the big list.

1079
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,020
And then after that, we'll have a list of, let's see,

1080
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:47,840
12 songs, unless there's some duplication.

1081
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,940
We might have a little less, but there'll be 12 or less songs.

1082
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:53,680
And that's when you three, or you guys in the chat room,

1083
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,800
get to pick your top three songs.

1084
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,860
and we'll do a vote over a really quick break.

1085
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,360
We'll do about a three minute break

1086
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,960
that you guys will have to vote.

1087
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,400
So, and we're already getting people

1088
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,840
screaming in the chat room their votes,

1089
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,740
but remember you guys can only vote for stuff

1090
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:06,580
that ends up on the list.

1091
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:08,120
So if your stuff doesn't end up on the list,

1092
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,640
sorry, it just can't be considered.

1093
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,520
You're only gonna be able to vote

1094
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,120
for stuff that's on the list.

1095
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,880
So why don't we go ahead and start?

1096
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,240
So let's go ahead and start.

1097
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,520
Jamie, why don't you go ahead and start?

1098
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,360
Fine.

1099
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,180
Your number three tune.

1100
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,000
My number three is colors.

1101
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,880
Colors.

1102
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:23,880
Any reason why?

1103
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:33,880
I've been listening. That's like one of the few songs to recently come out for 2DX that I've literally listened to 10 times in a row because I absolutely love the song.

1104
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,880
Okay.

1105
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:41,880
Yeah, it's just... I don't know. It actually just sort of reminded me of a bunch of stuff, so I like it.

1106
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:49,880
Alright, and just a note to the chat room, please don't flood your votes. We hear you loud and clear the first line, so you don't have to type it 60 times, your votes.

1107
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,940
Okay, number three, my number three pick would be Star Mine.

1108
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,300
I would say it would be one of the best 2DX songs.

1109
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,020
And Waving Fun.

1110
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:59,060
Okay.

1111
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:01,160
And yes, the video has a big part to do with that.

1112
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,000
So who's gonna go next?

1113
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,160
Joe, you wanna go next?

1114
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,280
Cracker.

1115
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:10,260
I don't know.

1116
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:12,460
Yes, we have the vote for Cracker.

1117
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,620
Japanese hip hop is funny.

1118
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:17,420
Yes, it is.

1119
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:20,060
All right, and for Matt.

1120
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:25,940
All right, my number three has to be between,

1121
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:28,060
I guess it's going to have to be A.

1122
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:30,140
It's going to be A is your number three choice, A

1123
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,020
from seventh style.

1124
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,020
A?

1125
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,060
All right.

1126
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,020
Thank you very much.

1127
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,020
Any other reasons you don't want to elaborate why,

1128
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:38,620
or just because you like it?

1129
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,420
I like piano ambiance.

1130
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:41,540
OK.

1131
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:45,020
And next we have Bradley.

1132
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:49,020
I've actually decided, so I'll go with number three as Kalkuta.

1133
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:52,020
Kalkuta! Kalkuta!

1134
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:56,020
It's a fun song, and it has my favorite sequence in it to play.

1135
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:57,020
Alright.

1136
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,020
Next up, Brad and Irene.

1137
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:00,020
That's one person.

1138
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:02,020
Our number three will have to be I Feel.

1139
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:04,020
I Feel, huh?

1140
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:05,020
Okay.

1141
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,020
Why do you like that one?

1142
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,020
Because the kyramoga owns all of you.

1143
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:12,020
I Feel is a great song.

1144
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,020
Get the rimshot!

1145
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:14,020
I mean the rimshot!

1146
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:15,020
Wait, hold on.

1147
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:16,020
I don't have the rimshot.

1148
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,020
Wait, wait.

1149
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:18,020
I guess I do.

1150
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:19,020
Thank you.

1151
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:20,020
I feel fulfilled.

1152
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:21,020
Okay.

1153
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:22,020
I feel...

1154
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:23,020
Oh.

1155
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:24,020
Your number two choice, Jamie.

1156
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:25,020
My number two choice?

1157
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,020
Okay.

1158
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:27,020
I actually did scratch off, you know, my Fuck You song, Schlagwerk, because, well, it kind

1159
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:28,020
of fell off once I heard Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock.

1160
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:29,020
Ah.

1161
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,020
That one, not only is it one of my favorite to listen to, but it's also one of my favorite

1162
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:31,020
to listen to.

1163
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,020
Yeah.

1164
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,020
Yeah.

1165
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:38,420
Well, it kind of fell off once I heard Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock.

1166
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:43,700
That one, not only is it one of my favorites to listen to, it's probably one of my favorites

1167
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:48,820
to play, except for that, you know, I either get the scratching or I don't, so it's a fun

1168
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:49,820
one overall.

1169
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:51,860
Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock, good choice.

1170
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:57,860
My number two pick for best 2DX song ever would be Love is Dreaminess, just because

1171
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:02,260
the video is cool, I love the song, I love the vocals in it, so Love is Dreaminess.

1172
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:06,260
We have a comment about its difficulty.

1173
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:10,260
It's just too damn hard. I just played it like five minutes ago, I think.

1174
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:14,260
That song and

1175
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:18,260
one other, or probably the last two I have left to pass in Light 7 on

1176
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:22,260
fifth style, is Love the Streaminess and

1177
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:26,260
Regulus, also known as the Cardcaptor Sakura theme.

1178
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:30,260
Anyway, next is Matt. Alright, my next one is

1179
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:35,860
going to have to be Nemesis. Nemesis, alright. From 7th Style. 6th Style. Oh, 6th Style,

1180
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:40,020
I'm sorry, whoops, my bad. 6th Style. Why would you choose Nemesis? It's an awesome

1181
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:45,460
trance song. What can I say? Okay, works for me. How about Joe? What was your number too

1182
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:51,900
big? SOS. SOS, also another Dr. Bombay song, why is that? I don't know, it's just crazy

1183
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:55,820
I guess. The video is absolutely funny. Well put, well put, it's fucking crazy, alright.

1184
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:59,820
Wait, I'm sorry, I need to ask the speed version or Dr. Bombay's version?

1185
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:01,820
Speed, I guess.

1186
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:06,820
The speed version? Okay, so it's not Dr. Bombay, we're talking about the speed version by, I believe it's Dr.

1187
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:08,820
It's not Dr. Bombay.

1188
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:09,820
Dr. Jekyll, thank you.

1189
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:10,820
Dr. Jekyll.

1190
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:14,820
Alright, passing off to Bradley.

1191
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:18,820
I guess I'll go for my second pick, I'll go for Elder Wall.

1192
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:24,820
I like it as soon as I heard it on Fizstyle and I can play it every time I play a game.

1193
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:25,820
Outer wall.

1194
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:27,820
You can do that, outer wall.

1195
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:30,820
Yeah, that was actually my wallpaper for the longest time.

1196
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:31,820
Right on.

1197
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:35,820
When they released all the Fizstyle pictures, I had outer wall up there for like three months.

1198
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:38,820
Okay, so we got everybody's number three and number two choices.

1199
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:39,820
No, oh, I'm sorry.

1200
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:40,820
You got to get Brad's.

1201
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:41,820
No, we have Brad's.

1202
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:42,820
Don't forget me.

1203
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:43,820
Okay.

1204
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:50,820
Um, I'd have to say my number two is Gravity by TAC, and you want to know why? Because TAC owns you all.

1205
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:53,820
I'm kind of surprised the amount of Seventh Style songs that are showing up here is kind of...

1206
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:56,820
Seventh Style is really good. Oh, that's a funny joke I read.

1207
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:02,820
Well, no, see, that's the reason why actually I like it, because it sounds like another incarnation of one of my favorite songs, Electro Tune, so...

1208
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:03,820
Way to go, TAC.

1209
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,820
Okay, that works. All right.

1210
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:06,820
It's just a TAC attack.

1211
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:08,820
Okay, so now everybody's...

1212
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:12,820
And we're already getting booed by a lot of people in the chat room for our choices, but you know...

1213
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:14,820
Well, you get to vote later.

1214
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:17,820
Yeah, you get to vote. Anyway, you'll get to determine the final list.

1215
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:19,820
You'll also get a fuck you of a week next week.

1216
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:20,820
Alright.

1217
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:27,820
Alright. Number one choices. So your personal favorite 2DX song ever. Jamie.

1218
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:32,820
Okay. As if people can't figure out what mine is going to be, it's going to be reincarnation.

1219
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:33,820
Reincarnation.

1220
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:37,820
And Brad totally called it.

1221
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:43,180
Well, of course this has got to be reincarnation, because I sat and was pissed at that song

1222
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:44,180
for weeks.

1223
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:49,300
The first time I passed it on 7 key, my cat walks behind my PS2 and unplugs it, and then

1224
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:53,460
I didn't pass it since until I actually got a third style from my friend while I was off

1225
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:54,700
at Anime Expo.

1226
01:30:54,700 --> 01:31:00,220
Okay, so my number one song, and I absolutely fell in love with this song the first time

1227
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:02,660
I heard it, and it really is the song that just hooked me into 2DX.

1228
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:05,820
I always thought it was cool, this is the song that hooked me into it, Deadline was

1229
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:11,720
my number one favorite Bimani song ever so Joe why don't you give us your number

1230
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:18,720
one pick I also like this one in a fifth and economics it's absolute by DJ Taka

1231
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:25,320
yes his Takas so he rolls it's absolutely cool yes absolutely a good

1232
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:30,880
choice there all right Matt your number one pick my number one pick has to be in

1233
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:01,880
70 is hard.

1234
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,400
So here we go, the very last one on the list.

1235
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,400
Brad's number one choice.

1236
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:06,720
R number one.

1237
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:07,720
The envelope, please.

1238
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:10,720
Oh, this is actually my number one.

1239
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,800
I chose Love, Will.

1240
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:13,800
Love, Will.

1241
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,800
That's a great song.

1242
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:25,200
Alright, a lot of Rick on here, RIC, I see Love, Will in my eyes, I Feel, a lot of him

1243
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,200
on there.

1244
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:27,200
Quite a bit of LED, too.

1245
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,200
Well, yeah, they're all Kiriyamaoka.

1246
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,200
Yeah, alright.

1247
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:30,200
Alright.

1248
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,200
Okay.

1249
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:34,480
Yeah, um, surprisingly V did not show up on the list.

1250
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,480
That kind of surprised me.

1251
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,560
I thought somebody would say it.

1252
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,120
I didn't say it because I thought somebody else would say it, but...

1253
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,920
It's because we could name the Katimu version.

1254
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,520
V did not show up on the list, but A did, somehow.

1255
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,520
So...

1256
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,520
We couldn't put the V vocal on there.

1257
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,640
How about we all make a cumulative vote of V?

1258
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,080
We just want to add V on the list?

1259
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,080
Just...

1260
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,080
Yeah.

1261
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,080
Alright, we're going to put V on there.

1262
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,080
V's on there.

1263
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:58,920
Okay, so now we have 19 songs, and we're going to now eliminate 6 of them.

1264
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,240
And this is kind of a hard choice, because these are all really good songs on here.

1265
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:04,320
So we're going to have to take off six of them.

1266
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,320
So starting with Jamie.

1267
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,320
Huh.

1268
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:12,120
I actually am taking off SOS Speed.

1269
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,120
SOS Speed is gone.

1270
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:16,200
I really personally cannot stand that version.

1271
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:19,280
I actually even refuse to play it at home, so.

1272
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,440
We're already getting bitched out in the chatroom for our list, so we haven't even eliminated

1273
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,440
songs yet.

1274
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,440
Sorry, Joe.

1275
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,440
All right.

1276
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,480
SOS is out of there.

1277
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:32,000
uh... i have to eliminate one huh uh...

1278
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,120
i

1279
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:35,800
i don't know i'm gonna get rid

1280
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,980
you know i just

1281
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:40,800
i don't like this song in two d x i think it's just a song that should've

1282
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,200
should've been only

1283
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:46,840
in uh... keyboard mania i mean repressed though i just don't i don't care for it

1284
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,540
didn't press it's uh...

1285
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:51,620
it's a keyboard mania so i just don't like it to you x i'm sorry

1286
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:54,080
all right uh... next week

1287
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,160
joe what do you want to take out the list

1288
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,160
Let me see.

1289
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:04,160
Oh man, this is a tough one. I dunno... I'd probably take off, like...

1290
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,160
God...

1291
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,160
Give me a sec...

1292
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,160
Oh...

1293
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,160
A

1294
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,160
You're taking off A! Oh!

1295
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:18,160
Oh!

1296
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:22,160
It's just too new. It's just too new to be the best one ever.

1297
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:26,160
Alright, so we have Matt's choice next.

1298
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:31,160
And I swear this isn't out of bitterness.

1299
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:34,160
Cracker!

1300
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,160
You know what, I have to agree, that was my other choice.

1301
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:42,160
Alright, next we have Bradley.

1302
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:46,160
Bradley is taking one off. What do you want?

1303
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:50,160
Okay, look through the list here.

1304
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:58,660
And I'll probably offend a lot of people, but just because I don't like the singing very well in this song, it might grow on me someday, but I don't like Colors all that much yet.

1305
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:03,160
Colors? Oh, wow! You know, I'm good at Colors!

1306
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,660
I'm gonna call into the corner and cry.

1307
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,160
Alright, Colors is gone, sorry.

1308
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:12,160
Alright, next we have Brad, well, like, you know. But I can't hate Bradley because he brought me Twendy.

1309
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:26,180
So that leaves us with our final list, and they're going to vote on this in the chat

1310
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:27,260
room right now.

1311
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:31,700
The only way I'm going to count your vote, you have to send me a private message with

1312
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:32,700
your vote.

1313
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:36,480
So I'm in the chat room, it's S-K-I-E, and I have a little bar, it says O-L. You have

1314
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,780
to send me your vote as a private message or it doesn't count, okay?

1315
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:41,060
Here's the final list.

1316
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:48,580
We have Star Mine, I Feel, Infinite Prayer, Love is Dreaminess, Nemesis, Outer Wall, Gravity,

1317
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:54,220
Reincarnation, Deadline, Absolute, In My Eyes, Love Will, and V.

1318
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:58,580
That's a whole big list and remember your vote only counts if you send it to me as a

1319
01:35:58,580 --> 01:35:59,580
private message.

1320
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:04,500
So, we're going to give you three minutes to do it, so send me those right now and in

1321
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:07,880
the meantime we're going to hear the full version of Moment, a pretty cool Five Key

1322
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:14,880
keep being a song here you go

1323
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:12,880
Hontou wa mina kutei

1324
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:18,880
Just make a real moment

1325
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:24,880
Latafume luta kere

1326
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:29,880
Sono irisaki gashiru

1327
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:34,880
Kakomo mila imo

1328
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,880
Oh

1329
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:10,880
Stay at every moment

1330
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:16,880
I'm not afraid of you

1331
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:21,880
I'm not afraid of you

1332
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:26,880
I'm not afraid of you

1333
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,880
Just make a real moment

1334
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:57,400
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

1335
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:04,760
Under Sedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica, Saturdays, 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m.

1336
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:11,760
at understudationlive.org

1337
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:25,280
that's right you are listening to orange lounge radio where we've been

1338
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:30,120
determining via our chat room in a little process we call listless

1339
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,720
the best 2DX song ever

1340
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,560
So our chat room has voted. We came up with our own little lists here.

1341
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:41,720
Chat room didn't agree with our lists. They didn't agree with some of the songs we knocked off, but that's just the way it works. We're sorry.

1342
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:45,360
But the chat room has voted, and we do have a winner.

1343
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:50,960
We have a few winners. We have, in third place for Best 2DX Song Ever is...

1344
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,480
Star Mine!

1345
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,720
Yay!

1346
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:57,720
Second place for Best 2DX Song Ever...

1347
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:58,920
Love Will!

1348
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:01,240
Yay!

1349
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,040
and

1350
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:10,400
the best to the x on as voted by our chat room

1351
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:15,400
absolute was voted the best to the x are there are

1352
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,200
and i don't know

1353
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:17,520
expected

1354
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,560
i don't know what has to do with them

1355
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,840
what if it has to do with the fact that this also happens to be in that

1356
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,360
d r whatever

1357
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,800
at but absolutely happy

1358
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:32,080
I mean, when you listen to Absolut, how can you just not want to stand up and dance a

1359
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,640
little jig to it or something?

1360
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:38,080
It's kind of like it got that medieval sounding thing to it, and it's just like, I'm in the

1361
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:42,040
castle and I'm going to go joust, and I'm going to eat big slaps of beef.

1362
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:45,880
The only joust that I do is on the Atari 5200, thank you.

1363
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:49,880
Alright, so once again, third place was Star Mine.

1364
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:53,960
I'm sorry, wait, hold on one second.

1365
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:57,640
When I hear Absolut, I definitely do not think of like, going and jousting.

1366
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:00,520
Where the hell did that come from?

1367
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:04,980
It comes from the fact that Ultracade happens to be right there, which has joust in it.

1368
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:05,980
So when...

1369
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:08,560
You've been watching too much Alanis Morissette videos, haven't you?

1370
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,320
Her precious illusions, medieval...

1371
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,400
I didn't even think of that, no, no.

1372
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,880
They don't joust in that video, shut up.

1373
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:14,880
Go make a jousting freestyle.

1374
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:15,880
Shut up!

1375
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:18,320
Go make a jousting freestyle for DDR.

1376
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,320
Maybe I will.

1377
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,320
I just might.

1378
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,560
But you have to come out on the bird.

1379
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,720
You have to have the bird from joust.

1380
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:26,720
Will you be my bird, Jamie?

1381
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:52,560
Just before you finish this, I'd like to say that I am very displeased with all of you

1382
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:58,160
Because you took off the best songs, all of the songs I picked, and my opinion is the

1383
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,500
only one that matters.

1384
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,500
I am God.

1385
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:01,500
What?

1386
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,500
Okay.

1387
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:03,500
I didn't.

1388
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:04,500
I'm good.

1389
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:05,500
Wait, where's my vomit?

1390
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:06,500
Do the vomit.

1391
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:07,500
Do the vomit.

1392
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:08,500
Give me the vomit.

1393
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:13,180
You have to say, show me the vomit.

1394
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:14,180
Show me the vomit.

1395
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:15,180
You can't handle the truth.

1396
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,180
Okay, I'm sorry.

1397
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:17,180
Guys, I love you guys.

1398
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:18,180
I'm sorry.

1399
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:21,180
Okay, I'm sorry. Guys, I love you guys.

1400
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:24,180
Apologize to the chat room and say you're sorry and you love them.

1401
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:29,180
I love you guys, chat room. How many people do we have in the chat room right now?

1402
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:30,180
Thirteen.

1403
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:32,180
Okay, I love you. All thirteen of you.

1404
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:33,180
All at once?

1405
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:35,180
Because Brad and I are the only people that have taste.

1406
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:40,180
Oh, Jamie! As if I wasn't harsh enough.

1407
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:44,180
No, you all have good taste. Absolutely is a good choice from the majority.

1408
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:47,180
Yeah, I think absolute is pretty. It's fair. It's fair.

1409
01:43:47,180 --> 01:43:52,020
Alright, on the total, in another part of the country, in another dimension, we have

1410
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:53,020
other news.

1411
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:54,020
Yes, Matt?

1412
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:57,580
Well, let's see here, since there's not really much sim news going on, since all the websites

1413
01:43:57,580 --> 01:44:05,660
are down because of bandwidth issues, we have one thing, the DDR East Coast Invasion DWI

1414
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:09,260
contest, the results are in, and I'm very disappointed with them.

1415
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:12,100
Now, that's your own personal damn opinion, by the way.

1416
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:16,800
Hey, it's my personal opinion, you know, being the sort of sim expert here, and I've played

1417
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:17,800
all of these

1418
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:20,640
i'll give you that out of the people in this room you would be the same expert

1419
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:21,760
okay has you been

1420
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,920
you've been playing step mania do you know i know that before they were like

1421
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:28,160
cool look like max and all that so i'll give you that yeah okay well

1422
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:33,800
third-place uh... was evolution uh... i believe it was

1423
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:36,640
by a mercury storm

1424
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:40,780
memory serves me right i believe is evolution time is pop mix

1425
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:42,120
remember correctly

1426
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:46,960
uh... second place was naturally by the money really which should have taken it

1427
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,440
and you know i'm very disappointed uh...

1428
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:53,360
and first place was healing vision half mix which is like a remix of healing

1429
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,320
vision with

1430
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,920
healing vision angelic mixed together which

1431
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,520
really got their retarded

1432
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:02,040
by cn only and they got pretty little strongly there about that which is

1433
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:02,960
retarded

1434
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,720
now i'd like to add that if i had entered i would probably

1435
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:06,900
now one but

1436
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,320
that's just me

1437
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:13,320
I thought you were going to be doing an entry with, can I say what you were going to do?

1438
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:20,320
You were going to go ahead and do an era Good Cool Fat Mix, the kind of rap version era, which is by the way on our playlist for Bomani Music and More.

1439
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:29,320
I was doing that and I kind of slacked off and procrastinated on it and didn't quite get it done.

1440
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:34,320
So that's why I don't have it and I was even playing and making my own video and that would have made me win.

1441
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:38,040
but you know unfortunately I didn't get a chance to enter it and they're still

1442
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:41,460
gonna have some more contests so I'll plan on entering those I'll get some

1443
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:45,860
done I've got a list of stuff I've got to make but you know I haven't had time

1444
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:49,860
okay you just haven't had that you've been too lazy well actually the last

1445
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:53,040
couple weeks I haven't had air conditioning and I couldn't sit at home

1446
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:57,940
and program you know steps in like 102 degrees in my house so I said you know

1447
01:45:57,940 --> 01:46:03,060
the health it and went and played DVR and said chat room does a lot of fans

1448
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:09,100
of the half mix there in the chat room. They seem to like it, some of them. Just to each

1449
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:14,940
their own, I suppose. It was good, but it wasn't the best. Let's just put it out there.

1450
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:21,140
Them's fighting words, Matt. Next time I will show them up. I'll be there. You'll be there

1451
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:25,100
with bells on. Yes, I will be there. The next contest that they have, I will enter. You

1452
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:31,100
will see Loki plaster something on there, so I will definitely enter. Alright, we trust

1453
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:34,260
Looking forward to it.

1454
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:37,400
On another completely random subject, something else we're going to be doing in the future

1455
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:40,820
on Orange Lounge, we're going to be showcasing some original work.

1456
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:44,900
We've got a supporter of the show who's in the chatroom right now, goes by the name Akil,

1457
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:50,700
and he's going to be loaning us one of his MP3s, he wants to hopefully get into DDR.

1458
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:54,480
We're going to showcase that in our Bomani Music and More program, and some people have

1459
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,680
been sending us some of their own homemade remixes.

1460
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:01,420
So Jamie and I are going to tear through some of those, and we might put a couple of those

1461
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:05,440
up in a rotation, because we don't want to just draw the line on Bimani songs.

1462
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:09,380
As you know, in our music show, we do sometimes put in songs we think ought to be in Bimani.

1463
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:13,560
We put in some Parappa stuff just for laughs and other things, Pump It Up stuff, just because

1464
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,560
it might as well be Bimani.

1465
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:20,960
Something that we could even take live bands, if there's a local band in the area, we support

1466
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,400
Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

1467
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,400
Sure, sure.

1468
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:30,400
If you've made a song and you think it deserves to be in DDR, 2DX, any of those games,

1469
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,400
I say it's good enough for our station, so send it to us and we'll listen to it.

1470
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:36,400
Yes, I have already gotten a few remixes, so Jamie and I are going through those.

1471
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:43,400
I was sent a Hysteria remix by JB, and I believe there's also supposed to be a remix of Cowgirl

1472
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:46,400
that he's going to send me pretty soon, so I'll have to take a listen to those.

1473
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:49,400
And Kiel also has a pretty good Papaya mix there.

1474
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:50,400
Oh yeah, I love that.

1475
01:47:50,400 --> 01:48:01,400
He'll go ahead and, if I ask him to, go ahead, Kiel, plug your website there in the chatroom, and he's got a great Papaya mix there, so if you're in the chatroom, go check that out, it's pretty funny. Pretty good stuff.

1476
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:05,400
And I say funny because Papaya makes me laugh, just her voice, I don't know. Yes.

1477
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:14,400
And I'd like to say that I do have some of Kiel's songs in my sim, I've got those off of the Imani Rulers site, and they're pretty good, I like them.

1478
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,400
So lots of support, keep up the good work.

1479
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,400
Cool. So we're going to be doing that soon. That's the future direction Orange Lounge Radio is going to be taking.

1480
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:27,400
Gosh, I think we're damn near out of topics to talk about, so how about we just talk about other stuff?

1481
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:32,400
How's your guys' week been going? Any funny DDR stories from the week?

1482
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:35,400
Oh, well I think we might have toxic mold in our apartment.

1483
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:36,400
Why's that?

1484
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:40,400
Because I'm coughing up like thick white shit in the morning every morning.

1485
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,400
Ew!

1486
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:45,080
And no, wait, but the more important thing is it's making it hard for me to play DDR.

1487
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:47,760
That's the most important thing.

1488
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,960
Aw, you can't beat those Oni Choruses with these and your Double.

1489
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:55,880
Well, no, man, Max Unlimited is really hard when you get into it and you're coughing up shit.

1490
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:58,840
The way Brad plays DDR is really hilarious.

1491
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:02,120
The way he dances when he does Doubles, it's like

1492
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:07,360
the center of his body is completely on the other pad as to where his legs are.

1493
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,840
And he's embarrassed. He's turning the color pink here, but it's so true. It's cool.

1494
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:16,980
I love watching Brad do doubles because like it looks like those videos you ever seen those videos where they split the screen in half

1495
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:20,920
And like the heads over here and the feet over here. That's what Brad looks like when he dances

1496
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,360
But his style is absolutely awesome

1497
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:26,520
And it's lanky lanky style

1498
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:32,740
Yes, you know, I'm still think it's pretty cool to be able to pass catastrophes, you know

1499
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:36,960
I don't care what said to say. Oh, we could pass the ball. We don't count I keep counts

1500
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:43,480
so damn it. I passed my 16th catastrophic, yay. I passed Kakame the first time I played

1501
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:46,840
it. God, that song was easy. I feel it was freaking easy.

1502
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:50,920
You've been playing the katas since, what, second, third mix? I don't know. When did

1503
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:54,400
you start playing the katas? I first started trying them when third mix

1504
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:57,840
had just come out. I had second mix at home. Now, is it just me or are the katas getting

1505
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:02,840
easier? You know, they are. My knee gave out on me

1506
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:06,840
trying dead end last night, but dead end is still hard to me. However, I was thinking

1507
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:10,700
that Kakamei was going to be this end-all difficult song because Burning Heat was so

1508
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:15,000
freaking evil and Kakamei was just so damn easy.

1509
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,840
And I feel, you know, people were saying, oh, I feel is so hard because the steps don't

1510
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:19,840
make sense.

1511
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,880
The steps make perfect sense if you just listen to the music.

1512
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:27,380
That song was absolutely, it, Kakamei was slightly easier, but I feel it was easier

1513
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:28,380
than some seven-footers.

1514
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:29,680
I mean, it was that easy.

1515
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:31,800
Yeah, I mean, I've definitely agreed.

1516
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:35,160
I just have to say Jamie's opinion is spreading faster than Anna Nicole Smith's legs right

1517
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:36,160
now.

1518
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,800
Okay, I

1519
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:42,960
Have to definitely agree that the cat is it being way easier the one the only few cat is I can't pass her off of

1520
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:48,000
Third mix, you know, we've got Afro Nova which I'm talking about doubles here. Well, actually probably singles too

1521
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,520
Okay, so I've got Afro Nova dead end. Well dead end that could pass singles, but not doubles and paranoia rebirth

1522
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,680
I can't pass on doubles. I

1523
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,240
Have my list somewhere. I'll go get it

1524
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:04,800
I think they're just making I think they're doing away with cat is and while we have is like, you know foot rankings now

1525
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,800
I don't see the word cata or anything like that anymore

1526
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:14,040
And I think they're making the 10-footers the so-called cata's now because all the new nine-footers are just way too easy

1527
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:15,800
And I really hope Konami

1528
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:19,760
You know takes their head out of their ass and fixes it because I like the really hard

1529
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:26,320
You know the super hardness of like you know max 300 next unlimited, but I want more songs like Afro Nova

1530
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:31,760
Doubles maniac you know something like that's not extremely hard, but yet still a good workout

1531
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:36,840
Now, one of my favorite katas, something I kind of liked about Max 2, was that a lot

1532
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:39,480
of the steps started to go with the music a little better.

1533
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:42,780
It kind of made a lot of the katas were actually fun to dance to, as opposed to just being

1534
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:45,520
like a bunch of really fast eighth notes, you know?

1535
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:49,040
One of my favorite katas, and I know this is an overplayed song, but just bear with

1536
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:52,860
me, Sugaru, I think is one of the coolest katas because the dance goes with the music

1537
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:55,280
so well that it's really fun to dance to.

1538
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,920
What do you, do you agree with me, or?

1539
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,400
Yeah, it's very good.

1540
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:01,400
Sugaru was one of the ones they really, I think, they did a great job on.

1541
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:06,080
I think that's one of the few Max 2 songs I could say they did not you know skimp on for us

1542
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,520
But I have to say something before we go on somebody in there

1543
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:12,260
It seems like a couple people don't seem to like primeval. Oh my god

1544
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:18,640
Can you guys beat it on maniac doubles because try doing it down at AX where they have like dust all over it

1545
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:20,720
And you're sliding all over

1546
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:23,540
AI that's what I think you Jamie AI

1547
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:24,880
Oh my god

1548
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:27,380
Everybody in the entire arcade turned around to watch me

1549
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:31,680
me try to beat that thing because you can't play, you can't stick to the machine on Afro

1550
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:32,680
Nova Primeval Devils.

1551
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:33,680
It's just, ugh.

1552
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:34,680
So, yeah.

1553
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:35,680
Let's see you try it.

1554
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:40,280
You know what I have, this is my opinion of what Akata should be, is a song that you should

1555
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:46,480
not be able to beat your first time, and at least three on max two, I have gone and beaten

1556
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:47,480
instantly.

1557
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:49,080
Well, like, you know, some of the songs were actually the first time I'd actually ever

1558
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:52,080
tried them, the ones they upgraded to Nine Footers.

1559
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:55,760
Well, I mean, of course I've done, you know, Burning the Floor, because, you know, that

1560
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:56,760
was my song.

1561
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:59,880
know that that was probably a mistake on Konami's part.

1562
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:04,680
Like end of the century, I beat it first try and they upgraded it to a nine.

1563
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:06,680
I'd finally just gotten around to trying it.

1564
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:10,920
Paranoia case, not paranoia, yeah, case set, the clean mix.

1565
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:11,920
They upgraded that to a nine.

1566
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:15,440
You have to remember also, Jimmy, you're getting better, so you're going to start beating more

1567
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:16,440
things on the first try.

1568
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:18,840
You still shouldn't be able to beat a nine footer your first time.

1569
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:23,220
Do you think that's why they've invented, I guess, so to speak, the ten footer?

1570
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:25,720
Because now they're going to start adding songs that are ten feet that you're just not

1571
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:28,360
going to be able to beat your first time although there's going to be people out

1572
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:31,360
there that just you know they're so good at DDR at this point you know they're

1573
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:34,040
going to beat it the first time because there's nothing Konami can do. I still

1574
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:36,720
think the game you know I'm glad I put in the Oni courses because that keeps

1575
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:40,320
the challenge but that's like a PA challenge they need to have I mean

1576
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:43,800
there's not really any way to increase the difficulty past where it is there's

1577
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:47,320
not really a way I mean unless you're going to be stuff I can't pass today

1578
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:51,580
that's the one that gives me issues. You could do you could do a six panel if

1579
01:53:51,580 --> 01:53:55,160
they made six panel more than just solo I mean could that be a new challenge?

1580
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:56,160
still kills me.

1581
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,920
Yeah, I mean, Six Metal's a little crazy, but...

1582
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:59,640
Solo sucks anyway.

1583
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:03,640
They need to stop making difficult songs and make fun songs.

1584
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:07,520
I mean, there's a lot of steps out there that are pretty difficult, but the steps are just

1585
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:08,520
not fun.

1586
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:11,400
Like, Hakumei, it sort of flows but doesn't.

1587
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:16,880
I feel it kind of feels like you're in a car with someone trying to learn to drive.

1588
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:20,680
It just starts going, stops, starts going, stops, starts going, stops.

1589
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:22,800
I feel it follows the back pattern in the music.

1590
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:23,800
Well, it does.

1591
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:24,880
It's just like every edit I make.

1592
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:29,480
It does, but the problem is maybe that doesn't flow quite as well as they could have done

1593
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,480
it.

1594
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:34,080
See, I didn't really think it did not flow, but then again, that's what I listened to.

1595
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,080
It's just weird.

1596
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:36,080
It's weird to dance to.

1597
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,440
It's so kind of like off and weird.

1598
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,800
I didn't think it was weird at all.

1599
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:44,000
But then again, for anybody who's ever played any of the edits that I make, you know what

1600
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,400
it is that I listen to in the music.

1601
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:51,320
Which is a pretty popular thing to do with edits, to find another instrument in the song.

1602
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:55,120
One thing I always, I think, are interesting about catas is the ones where your feet kind

1603
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:56,920
of make another instrument.

1604
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:59,320
An example of this I think would be either a Santa Milette or Orion.

1605
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:03,000
I guess Santa Milet is not really a cata, but you know, it's a difficult song.

1606
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,720
And Orion, 7-8, it's like your feet kind of make another instrument.

1607
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:09,300
Those are kind of cool catas because they take a while to kind of learn how to play

1608
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:13,120
that instrument, and then your feet kind of make a new tune.

1609
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:14,120
I kind of think those catas are fun.

1610
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,120
That's sort of the basis for another.

1611
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:16,120
Yeah.

1612
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:17,120
For my D-X-Y, I did another.

1613
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:21,040
Which the challenge is still out there if you want free food, okay?

1614
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:23,800
You want to just run over your challenge one more time?

1615
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:24,800
Okay.

1616
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:31,480
For anybody who can either full combo or 90% perfect attack my DXY edit another, I will

1617
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:35,800
take you out to a dinner of up to $15.

1618
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:36,800
How does that sound?

1619
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:40,600
Of course, provided I can afford it.

1620
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:43,480
Keep in mind, I'm unemployed right now, I may have to owe you a rain check, but I will

1621
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:50,120
definitely, the first person who does it, you are getting taken out to a nice dinner.

1622
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:56,260
what do we hear I want my GC okay okay yes this has to go for the second the

1623
01:55:56,260 --> 01:56:03,920
second challenge for whoever can full combo my look to the sky at it was a you

1624
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:09,220
know at least a 90% perfect attack then you get a free game cue pin which is

1625
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:15,920
still in my purse Oh tennies if you can send me proof that it's been passed to

1626
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:22,280
then send me a photo of the screen, you know, or a video or something. Send me, you know,

1627
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:25,360
physical proof and I will be sending you a GameCube pen.

1628
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:30,480
All right. Pretty cool. We still have three minutes left. Anybody got any other closing

1629
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:34,480
thoughts? Just for anything. It doesn't have to be Bomani. Anything you guys want to talk

1630
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:42,840
about? Yeah. My spoon is too big. Austin Powers 3 coming out this Friday. Oh, yeah. Same jokes

1631
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:47,560
I don't think they can do that.

1632
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:49,000
I don't care.

1633
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,880
I want to go see it.

1634
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:56,480
Everyone is pointing them at me?

1635
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:57,480
We can't pick it up.

1636
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:58,480
We want comments from Irene.

1637
01:56:58,480 --> 01:56:59,480
I'm sorry.

1638
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:02,640
All I was going to say is that I got a different car.

1639
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:03,640
Wow.

1640
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:04,640
Congratulations.

1641
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,640
You finally got rid of the Golf, right?

1642
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:06,640
Yeah.

1643
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:07,640
All right.

1644
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:08,640
Way to go.

1645
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:09,640
Actually, I need people to do me a favor.

1646
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:10,640
What's that?

1647
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:11,640
For people, it doesn't matter what part of the country you're in.

1648
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:20,080
I asked some people to help me find an 83 Toyota Corolla AE86 hatchback, so I can have

1649
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:23,360
my trainer one ended up like the initial D-car.

1650
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:26,360
If anyone can find one or has one for sale, let me know.

1651
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:30,160
I will buy it.

1652
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:32,760
And Eight-Legged Freaks was okay.

1653
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:33,760
Go see it though.

1654
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:34,760
That looks so retarded.

1655
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:36,600
It was a drive-in movie.

1656
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:37,600
It looks retarded.

1657
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:38,600
Okay.

1658
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:39,600
I went and saw it.

1659
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:40,600
I based my opinion on the trailers.

1660
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:48,800
best way to describe it. It was better than Tremors, but not quite as good as Gremlins.

1661
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:52,580
It was just campy. It was meant to be campy. It was meant to be stupid. The whole point

1662
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:57,360
is that it has very little plot. You just watch a bunch of people try to survive spiders,

1663
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:00,620
and that's the whole movie. It's a drive-in movie. It's meant to be cheesy and corny.

1664
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:08,060
It's paying homage to all those giant monster movies of the 50s.

1665
01:58:08,060 --> 01:58:09,060
It was better.

1666
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:14,140
You know, arachnophobia, when I saw that, I went to go make out with somebody.

1667
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:15,140
You dog!

1668
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:18,780
They didn't have eight legs, did they?

1669
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:20,860
I wasn't watching the movie.

1670
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:24,180
Okay, on that note, I believe we are going to put the nail in the coffin of this show

1671
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,740
now.

1672
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:26,740
Join us next week.

1673
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:30,760
Once again, we're going to be joined by special guests Mel B and Melody are going to be here

1674
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:33,220
to talk about, oh, God knows what.

1675
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:38,380
And after this show's over, why don't you listen to our Bamani Music and More program,

1676
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:42,260
playing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when this show is not on the air.

1677
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:46,940
And we're going to be putting new stuff this week into the rotation, all sorts of new crap,

1678
01:58:46,940 --> 01:58:49,740
including some of the stuff you heard tonight on the show.

1679
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:51,580
And I believe that's about it.

1680
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:53,540
I can't think of anything else you want to say, Jimmy?

1681
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:57,980
I'm going to go officially brain dead once the show's over, so I have nothing else to

1682
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:58,980
say.

1683
01:58:58,980 --> 01:58:59,980
Alright, sounds good.

1684
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:01,660
Thanks everybody for listening, we'll see you next week at 7 o'clock.

1685
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:05,180
If you missed any part of the show, we'll be rebroadcasting tonight's show tomorrow

1686
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:07,520
night at seven o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

1687
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,520
Have a good night everybody.

1688
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:09,520
Thanks for listening.

1689
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,520
Good night.

1690
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:11,520
Good night.

1691
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,540

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

1696
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:34,220
Remember kids, that glue you use in school, it's made from dead horses!

1697
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:37,220
No Wilbur, it's just a sprain!
