1
00:00:02,228 --> 00:00:04,750
[SPEAKER_12]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:08,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Our live talk program begins now.

3
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:29,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio may contain sexual and adult content and many instances of the F-word, which is not safe for children.

4
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:46,864
[SPEAKER_15]: God damn you, stop calling here.

5
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:48,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't it 4215, pussy whee?

6
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:50,066
[SPEAKER_15]: You bitch!

7
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:53,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Now let me check that this goes 2-1-2, fuck you!

8
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:54,828
[SPEAKER_15]: You have no morals, darling.

9
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:59,830
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of herpes.

10
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Kiss my great nooch.

11
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:04,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Mecca lecca hi, mecca hi-dee-ho.

12
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:06,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.

13
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:08,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Me too!

14
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:08,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Fucker, yeah?

15
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working on it.

16
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:11,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Loser.

17
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:11,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Lame!

18
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:13,916
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the size of my face.

19
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:19,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.

20
00:01:19,808 --> 00:01:25,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.

21
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:27,019
[SPEAKER_15]: I am your singing colleague.

22
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:39,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

23
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:43,438
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned in to the Balamani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Balamani.

24
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:45,960
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

25
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:49,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

26
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:51,505
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

27
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:52,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I am doing.

28
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:53,127
[SPEAKER_11]: And you?

29
00:01:53,387 --> 00:01:54,188
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you, gentlemen?

30
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:55,509
[SPEAKER_11]: All your best, sir.

31
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,010
[SPEAKER_11]: We love you a lot.

32
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:00,933
[SPEAKER_03]: This is episode number five for July the 21st of 2002.

33
00:02:01,353 --> 00:02:03,734
[SPEAKER_03]: We are joined in studio once again by many, many guests.

34
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:04,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello, everybody.

35
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:08,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to introduce everybody one by one real fast.

36
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:09,635
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Irene.

37
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:11,276
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Brad.

38
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:13,336
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Joe.

39
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:14,877
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Dave.

40
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:16,797
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Matt.

41
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:18,678
[SPEAKER_03]: That's everybody.

42
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:20,378
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Bradley.

43
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:23,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Bradley's here, finally.

44
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:23,419
Wee!

45
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:25,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he shows up.

46
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:26,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Our moral support.

47
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:28,417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably the only time you're going to hear him the whole show.

48
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:34,800
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll be talking to all our guests a little bit later, but first we're going to take a very quick break.

49
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other opening thoughts?

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm seeing this right now that I still love Bradley because he brought me a Twinbee book.

51
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:41,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh!

52
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:42,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Twinbee is ownage.

53
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:45,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Very neat, very neat.

54
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:47,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish our webcam was working so I could show...

55
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:54,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could show the elation here on the webcam, but unfortunately, if you do try to go to the webcam on our site, it isn't working right now.

56
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:56,298
[SPEAKER_03]: But we will have that back next week.

57
00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:00,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have a big, big show next week, and we'll talk more about that a little bit later.

58
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say, happy birthday, Joe Mama.

59
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:04,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy birthday!

60
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:06,324
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play some music right now.

61
00:03:06,344 --> 00:03:10,086
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start it off with something Jamie requested, which I think is very cool.

62
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,327
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to introduce this for us?

63
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:18,476
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is, I'm sure everyone is familiar with a particular song from 2DX Third Style by DJ Taka.

64
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:19,938
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is remixed by Naoki.

65
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:20,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

66
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:35,068
Thanks for watching!

67
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,597
Thank you for watching.

68
00:07:35,637 --> 00:07:37,478
See you next time.

69
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:20,897
[SPEAKER_12]: And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

70
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:22,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it all night.

71
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:23,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it with me.

72
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,960
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

73
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you take vocal lessons?

74
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Kill your teacher!

75
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:29,882
[SPEAKER_16]: In the heat of the night.

76
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:32,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

77
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:34,404
[SPEAKER_16]: I liked it.

78
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:36,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

79
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:36,965
[SPEAKER_17]: Next!

80
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:44,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Um... That was cool... Do you even know why you're here?

81
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:46,218
[SPEAKER_17]: That was just bloody pathetic!

82
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:46,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Next!

83
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on, Ava.

84
00:08:49,702 --> 00:08:51,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on, do it with me.

85
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:52,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes!

86
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:53,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's it!

87
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:54,768
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a winner!

88
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:59,403
[SPEAKER_12]: A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

89
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:04,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

90
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:08,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I just repeated myself, but that's okay, because I can do anything I want on this show.

91
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:10,469
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the power.

92
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:11,810
[SPEAKER_11]: We control the vertical.

93
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,611
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no vertical or horizontal on the radio.

94
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:15,212
[SPEAKER_11]: We control the audio.

95
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:16,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I could drop everybody like that.

96
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:18,781
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to do that.

97
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:22,222
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not going to do that because I noticed we're actually starting to get some listeners.

98
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:23,082
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty cool.

99
00:09:23,122 --> 00:09:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm liking this.

100
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:25,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And we love you all.

101
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:28,204
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to say hi to us, why don't you come join us in our chat room?

102
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:32,105
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to get any IRC program, like MIRC is a popular one.

103
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:39,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as your server, you're going to choose any other side IRC server, like irc.eggheads.org is one.

104
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:46,230
[SPEAKER_03]: or you can join OthersideIRC.net, or I believe it's Caram at OthersideIRC.net.

105
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And all you're going to do once you get on one of those servers, you're just going to join Channel Orange Lounge.

106
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:52,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people seem to really like some music in that set.

107
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:58,755
[SPEAKER_03]: The last set we had 0.59 by DJ Taka, but that was remixed by Naoki, a piano version there.

108
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:00,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Seemed to be pretty well liked.

109
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:04,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Also after that we had a very popular drum mania song, Dynamite.

110
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:05,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

111
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:35,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jamie.

112
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:35,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Well put.

113
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:35,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

114
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:36,234
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

115
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:04,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, we've just got these big egos tonight.

116
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is.

117
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something in the air.

118
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:07,881
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a big ego.

119
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:08,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm intensely modest.

120
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the California heat.

121
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:13,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some big news for the show.

122
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:17,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week on the show, we're going to have our very first special guests.

123
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:18,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Guests.

124
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:23,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just one special guest, but two special guests here on the show next week, next Sunday.

125
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:26,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you care to tell them about our lovely guests we're going to have, Jamie?

126
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:27,548
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

127
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:28,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think we should make it a surprise?

128
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:28,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

129
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:32,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've already told half the people in this room, but nobody online knows, I don't think.

130
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

131
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:38,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we're actually having over Melody and Mel B. Yep.

132
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:45,074
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're going to be our guests on the show, and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them.

133
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:46,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

134
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:50,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to move everything out into the living room because this room is cramped as it is when we do the show here.

135
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:53,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd have to say so, and quite toasty and moist.

136
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:56,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you feeling a little moist tonight, Jamie?

137
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:58,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, every night on the show.

138
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:03,514
[SPEAKER_11]: As Irene makes this face.

139
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio makes you moist as a snack cake.

140
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,015
[SPEAKER_11]: You're squishy.

141
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:11,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, yes.

142
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:13,076
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

143
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So next week should be a good show because Mel B will be here to talk about freestyle stuff.

144
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:19,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what we'll talk to him about.

145
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe about his retirement.

146
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:23,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't he retire and then he kind of came back out of retirement?

147
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:24,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like Jordan.

148
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:24,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

149
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,620
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

150
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:49,190
[SPEAKER_03]: In the chat room, they're asking, wasn't Mel B one of the Spice Girls?

151
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:51,332
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're not having that Mel B on the show.

152
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:52,032
[SPEAKER_03]: God, no.

153
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:55,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless I get to, you know, use her gigantic teeth for Tarka practice.

154
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:04,358
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the freestyle Mel B. I don't know what the last tournament was that he won.

155
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:05,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any idea?

156
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what some of his big routines were.

157
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:09,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he had a really good one at SCAD.

158
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,000
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a good routine.

159
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,802
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to do an improv routine to Boom Boom Dollar, which was hilarious.

160
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:15,203
[SPEAKER_11]: There was also the Silent Hill one.

161
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:17,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Does everyone know who Mel B is?

162
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:20,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see that.

163
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:29,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people, if you download videos from DDR Freak or any site that offers videos of freestyle competitions from the Bay Area, you're going to probably find a Mel B video.

164
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:31,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most people are familiar with his work.

165
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:39,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I can actually confirm that from people in Mississippi, in Alabama, where I was going to play DDR at Boomtown.

166
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:41,078
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, you're from California?

167
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:42,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God, do you know Mel B?

168
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:42,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

169
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:45,573
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I got.

170
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:47,575
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a celebrity, man.

171
00:13:47,635 --> 00:13:47,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

172
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:51,479
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a DDR celebrity, and he'll be here in-house next week.

173
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:57,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's special, to be a DDR celebrity?

174
00:13:57,946 --> 00:13:58,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, why not?

175
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:00,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a DDR celebrity.

176
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:04,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And why are you a DDR celebrity?

177
00:14:05,715 --> 00:14:06,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I am.

178
00:14:07,574 --> 00:14:11,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was that, um, wait, I can't say that name on this radio station, can I?

179
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:15,401
[SPEAKER_04]: But that one instance with this, the, uh, unnamed person, we don't have the name.

180
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:16,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what?

181
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,603
[SPEAKER_04]: That made her a celebrity.

182
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:19,724
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the whole rice princess.

183
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:20,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, whatever, whatever.

184
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:21,886
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to go into that, sorry.

185
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:26,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean to bring the show to a crashing halt or anything, come on.

186
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:30,574
[SPEAKER_11]: But, no, um, you know, it's kind of funny, though, I've noticed that, like,

187
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:31,500
[SPEAKER_11]: D.D.R.

188
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:31,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Freak

189
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:47,946
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, um, cause, alright, they got their fifth mix machine in at the Boomtown Casino in, um, Biloxi, Mississippi.

190
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:51,728
[SPEAKER_11]: And they had never seen a fifth mix before.

191
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:53,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is after Max 2 had just come out.

192
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:59,952
[SPEAKER_11]: So I get up on there, I play my usual thing, you know, I have this tradition where I always start off with Superstar Maniac.

193
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:01,893
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't really matter what machine it's on.

194
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:09,417
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, I just played, like, this big Maniac set and, like, for the first time I full comboed, uh, what did I play?

195
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Dropout, Trick, Hidden, something.

196
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,579
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I just was playing around.

197
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,061
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're like, oh my god, who are you?

198
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:19,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, oh, well, I go by DarkSakura.

199
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:20,942
[SPEAKER_11]: That's you?

200
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:22,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god!

201
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:33,188
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's like if you have a prominent name on any of the national boards or anything like that, then people know who you are and they're like, oh my god, that's you.

202
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:34,969
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just really weird.

203
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for me, they're like, you're Mormon?

204
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:38,031
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

205
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:41,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

206
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:44,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncomfortable.

207
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:52,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, our chat room is getting insanely popular, so I was opting a few people there to help police the chat room when we can't take an eye on things here.

208
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,259
[SPEAKER_03]: It is pretty big today.

209
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:54,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

210
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, everybody.

211
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody in chat room.

212
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, we even have the... Let's see who we have in the chat room today.

213
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,543
[SPEAKER_11]: We have SoCalKicks, Joe Mama.

214
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:09,305
[SPEAKER_11]: We have... God, lots of people.

215
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, it's the people who are actually here.

216
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:15,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, Bradley, you're in two places at once.

217
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:16,026
[SPEAKER_11]: How special.

218
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:20,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

219
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,149
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your evil twin skippy.

220
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:29,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I just gave ops to people that are long-time listeners to the show here, so I thought they'd be able to police all right, because they know what we do here on the show.

221
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:31,494
[SPEAKER_11]: and just what do we do.

222
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:37,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, will we just talk about anything Bomani and then just other crap that we feel like talking about?

223
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,337
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about whatever we want here on the show, right?

224
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:40,477
[SPEAKER_11]: We talk about it.

225
00:16:40,777 --> 00:16:42,258
[SPEAKER_11]: If it exists, we can talk about it.

226
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:42,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

227
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:48,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so we have Mel B and Melody coming next week.

228
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,020
[SPEAKER_03]: That's big news for the show.

229
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,060
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be expanding our playlist, other big news for the show.

230
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:56,542
[SPEAKER_03]: We might also be starting to do some other random live things.

231
00:16:57,242 --> 00:16:57,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh.

232
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:57,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh.

233
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:58,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

234
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,741
[SPEAKER_03]: None of us seem to have it.

235
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:32,564
[SPEAKER_03]: We know some people out there do have it, thankfully, but we're not getting ours until mid-next week, so we couldn't do our six-style tribute tonight.

236
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:47,512
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I've got some tracks from the V-Rare 2 CD, and if you pre-ordered stuff from Konami Style, then you would have gotten this special CD, this V-Rare 2 CD, which had some tracks on it, and I'm going to play some of those tracks for you.

237
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:54,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And rumor is that this also works as an appendix, although I haven't had that confirmed yet, so I don't know what's going to happen with that.

238
00:17:56,047 --> 00:18:03,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're going to do a tribute to Sixth Style next week because we'll have it and we can... That'll be even more special because it'll be show number six.

239
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:04,849
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be show number six.

240
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:07,310
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be show six style, yeah.

241
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:07,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

242
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:13,192
[SPEAKER_03]: So... So what else do you want to talk about?

243
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:14,352
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to take another break real fast?

244
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:14,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to...

245
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:19,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, why don't we go ahead and let them hear something different for a bit?

246
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:21,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, let's play those songs.

247
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:23,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go ahead and play those songs from the VRare 2 CD.

248
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:29,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to come back and we're going to talk about the big news this week concerning the Konami of America coin-op division.

249
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:30,772
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that when we get back.

250
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:42,360
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, I'm going to play Megu with Stick Around and LED with the Mix-Up Dungeon J. And I'm having a request in the chat room for a Strong Jager, so maybe we'll work that in, too.

251
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:42,860
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.

252
00:23:11,422 --> 00:23:12,087
Thanks for watching!

253
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:32,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

254
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:34,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to be exactly like Hollywood?

255
00:28:34,315 --> 00:28:34,675
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

256
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:38,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we care what people think of us?

257
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:40,861
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

258
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:42,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

259
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes!

260
00:28:46,813 --> 00:28:48,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Extreme Babani Radio.

261
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:51,536
[SPEAKER_12]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

262
00:28:51,776 --> 00:28:58,039
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we just played for you some stuff from the 6th Style V-Rare 2 CD.

263
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:00,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Some hidden tracks that you can find in 6th Style.

264
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Megu with Stick Around, the full version, and LED with a strong Jaeger.

265
00:29:05,383 --> 00:29:06,343
[SPEAKER_03]: As in Jaegermeister.

266
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:07,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was exciting.

267
00:29:07,364 --> 00:29:07,944
[SPEAKER_03]: The full version.

268
00:29:08,184 --> 00:29:10,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm tingly just from hearing that song.

269
00:29:10,786 --> 00:29:12,787
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been moist and tingly tonight, Jamie.

270
00:29:12,907 --> 00:29:14,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I feel like I have a disease.

271
00:29:15,652 --> 00:29:18,174
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the racking pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.

272
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:20,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene's got this look on her face of like, dear God.

273
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:23,297
[SPEAKER_03]: This show is resorted to potty jokes.

274
00:29:24,257 --> 00:29:25,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, anyway.

275
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:30,561
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to give our condolences to a long-time supporter of Orange Lounge Radio.

276
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,343
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been around since the first couple episodes.

277
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:35,224
[SPEAKER_03]: That's SCK SoCalKicks.

278
00:29:35,264 --> 00:29:39,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Had a website, and unfortunately due to some server issues, it is no more.

279
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:41,709
[SPEAKER_03]: He has no website right now.

280
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:42,129
[SPEAKER_03]: He can't...

281
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:43,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Host it!

282
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:50,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so if you have any posting space that you'd like to host, a cool little DDR website all about the SoCal scene and then some.

283
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:52,913
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a lot of information about U.S.

284
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:55,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Bomani releases, domestic Bomani releases.

285
00:29:55,675 --> 00:29:57,115
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always up to news on that kind of stuff.

286
00:29:57,615 --> 00:30:00,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And he has a good little edit database going.

287
00:30:00,557 --> 00:30:06,379
[SPEAKER_03]: So go ahead and send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and we'll pass it along to him.

288
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:07,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

289
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:09,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're welcome.

290
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, because he's saying thank you in the chatroom.

291
00:30:11,863 --> 00:30:12,223
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're welcome.

292
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you're very welcome.

293
00:30:13,464 --> 00:30:14,645
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been a long time supporter of the show.

294
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:16,026
[SPEAKER_11]: You hosted my edits.

295
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:16,787
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really cool.

296
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:17,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

297
00:30:17,947 --> 00:30:20,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we've got some news going on.

298
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday was the big Castro Valley Golf Land Tournament.

299
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:28,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, that kind of goes into an FU of the Week, actually, for me anyway.

300
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:31,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want to give Jamie's FU of the Week first.

301
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:34,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's let Jamie give her FU of the Week.

302
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:42,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, my FU of the week is directed towards, drumroll please, AT&T.

303
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,537
[SPEAKER_03]: AT&T.

304
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:44,817
[SPEAKER_11]: AT&T.

305
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:48,818
[SPEAKER_11]: The only company that I've seen that has the Death Star as their logo.

306
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:50,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they are truly the evil empire.

307
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:55,380
[SPEAKER_11]: I have been at home, unemployed, now...

308
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:56,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Happily.

309
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:57,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not really.

310
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, that's off the subject.

311
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:07,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I've been sitting at home for the past week and a half trying to go online and play my addiction, Ragnarok Online, only to have my cable crap out.

312
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:13,593
[SPEAKER_11]: I will be sitting online, happily gaining levels, even if disconnected from the server.

313
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:14,033
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

314
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:22,075
[SPEAKER_11]: I go downstairs, look at my little connector thing for my modem, and it's blinking lights all over the place, and then it just stops.

315
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:29,140
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to hop on dial-up, then it comes back, then I have to get back on, and it does this at least five times a day.

316
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,041
[SPEAKER_11]: AT&T is truly a company run by the Antichrist.

317
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:36,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so I'm looking for new service.

318
00:31:36,782 --> 00:31:39,262
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody has good suggestions, I'm open to them.

319
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:40,963
[SPEAKER_11]: AT&T just needs to die.

320
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:51,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I also hate AT&T because we have their cable, and they charge us way too much for it, and we don't get BBC America, and we don't get M2.

321
00:31:52,062 --> 00:31:54,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So what am I supposed to do for watching music videos?

322
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:55,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Because MTV sure as hell doesn't play them.

323
00:31:56,703 --> 00:31:57,703
[SPEAKER_11]: That's for damn sure.

324
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:03,044
[SPEAKER_11]: MTV hasn't played videos since, like, the 90s began.

325
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:07,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, they played videos up through them because we had 120 Minutes, we had...

326
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but like, MTV has Sorority Life.

327
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:16,525
[SPEAKER_06]: The new reality show!

328
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:18,447
[SPEAKER_06]: It took place in Davis, by the way.

329
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:20,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, that is true.

330
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,791
[SPEAKER_11]: More than the reason not to watch.

331
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:23,734
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually did see that at AX.

332
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:25,937
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw when they put the rocks up on the side of the hill.

333
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:29,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is that what they all do by the big bridge?

334
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,821
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a pledge thingy.

335
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:32,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, to hell with MTV.

336
00:32:32,942 --> 00:32:34,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an FU of the Week as well.

337
00:32:35,283 --> 00:32:36,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought of this before the show started.

338
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:40,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided I needed a theme song for my FU of the Week as well.

339
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:41,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, mine's cooler.

340
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yours is cooler.

341
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:43,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Mine's fucked up.

342
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:51,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, my issue... Oh, it's being suggested that your FU of the Week should have been this.

343
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:52,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Duplo Web.

344
00:32:52,572 --> 00:32:52,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

345
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:54,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Freaking Duplo Web.

346
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:56,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

347
00:32:57,074 --> 00:33:00,156
[SPEAKER_11]: I have been working for nearly a month on DarkSakura.com.

348
00:33:00,176 --> 00:33:01,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting my pages up.

349
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:01,937
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks really pretty.

350
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:03,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad nobody else can see it.

351
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:24,003
[SPEAKER_11]: because I keep getting these emails that say, we're relocating the server, oh, we relocated again, oh, the server's now shoved somewhere up our ass, you know, we're puking it now.

352
00:33:24,744 --> 00:33:29,066
[SPEAKER_11]: So, at this point, I'm about ready to say, fuck DuploWeb again.

353
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:33,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And for the people in the chatroom who are wondering, go to www.duploweb.com and you'll see how crappy they are.

354
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:37,329
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'm looking for a new service for that as well.

355
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:40,591
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have suggestions, please let me know, as long as you pay for it.

356
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:43,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, can I finish?

357
00:33:43,816 --> 00:33:44,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

358
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:44,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

359
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:45,357
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

360
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:45,918
[SPEAKER_10]: No, my turn!

361
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:46,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

362
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:46,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

363
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:49,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I have part three, and my other fuck of the week goes toward my big toe.

364
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:49,941
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

365
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:53,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

366
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:53,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

367
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:55,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna try to do my FU of the week now.

368
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:55,987
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

369
00:33:56,307 --> 00:33:56,727
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may.

370
00:33:56,747 --> 00:33:57,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, one more thing, one more thing.

371
00:33:57,628 --> 00:33:58,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Jesus Christ.

372
00:33:58,209 --> 00:33:58,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here you go.

373
00:34:03,393 --> 00:34:05,755
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week is Jamie, because she, no.

374
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:06,216
[SPEAKER_03]: My...

375
00:34:09,187 --> 00:34:12,510
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week is my sleep schedule.

376
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:20,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Because not only did I sleep until 3 o'clock today, I slept for 13 hours last night.

377
00:34:22,618 --> 00:34:24,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I slept yesterday.

378
00:34:25,678 --> 00:34:30,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I slept yesterday just long enough to miss CVGL completely.

379
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:43,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to go for a couple hours and it was great because I had my little remote kit I was going to take and I was going to do interviews for this show and I was going to do all this stuff and hopefully get to meet some people and get interviews with winners and all that stuff.

380
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:45,355
[SPEAKER_03]: But I slept too damn much.

381
00:34:45,855 --> 00:34:48,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did not get to go to CVGL.

382
00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:49,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

383
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:57,524
[SPEAKER_03]: My problem is my clock and for that I give an F you to my sleep clock.

384
00:34:57,544 --> 00:35:00,286
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also taking suggestions and collections to buy Robin your alarm clock.

385
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm being told to get an alarm clock.

386
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:03,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work.

387
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:04,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work this weekend.

388
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:05,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have my one.

389
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:08,070
[SPEAKER_11]: We can buy one and duct tape it to your head.

390
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:14,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sleeping at my own house and that's all that needs to be said.

391
00:35:15,535 --> 00:35:17,157
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a suggestion from Irene.

392
00:35:17,237 --> 00:35:17,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene, yes.

393
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:18,578
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?

394
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:24,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I said take laxatives before you go to bed so you'll have to take a shit really bad in the morning and you'll be forced to wake up.

395
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:27,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to say something to Jabberwocky in the chat room.

396
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:29,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't understand anything you're saying at all.

397
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:30,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

398
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

399
00:35:34,362 --> 00:35:35,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving right along.

400
00:35:35,262 --> 00:35:36,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, and a poopy pancake to you.

401
00:35:36,964 --> 00:35:38,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, moving right along.

402
00:35:38,424 --> 00:35:40,966
[SPEAKER_03]: That relates, by the way, to the other show.

403
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:45,229
[SPEAKER_03]: UnderstationLive.org Listen to it.

404
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,390
[SPEAKER_03]: It broadcasts on Saturday night.

405
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,631
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like this, you'll love that.

406
00:35:47,751 --> 00:35:48,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

407
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:49,111
[SPEAKER_11]: The 630 to 930.

408
00:35:49,612 --> 00:35:52,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about the winners at CVGL, because I wanted to talk about that.

409
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:54,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still have that up on the screen over there, Matt?

410
00:35:56,175 --> 00:35:56,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Who won?

411
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some people that listen to this show ended up placing, so that's pretty cool.

412
00:35:59,676 --> 00:36:01,697
[SPEAKER_11]: We will pass the microphone now to Matt.

413
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:07,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, for Perfect Attack, first place went to Virtu, no, Corey.

414
00:36:08,923 --> 00:36:09,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

415
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:10,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, Corey!

416
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:15,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Second place went to Tigger Eugene, or I hope I pronounced that right.

417
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:18,874
[SPEAKER_06]: And then third place went to Emphasis.

418
00:36:20,235 --> 00:36:20,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you go!

419
00:36:22,037 --> 00:36:24,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And for Freestyle, let me see here real quick.

420
00:36:27,634 --> 00:36:33,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, third place went to Hypnotics with his Secret Rendezvous routine.

421
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:36,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Second place went to... That's a local boy!

422
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:37,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Go Hypnotics!

423
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:37,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo!

424
00:36:38,203 --> 00:36:42,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Second place went to Nobody Gin for their High Is Off You routine.

425
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:50,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And also first place went to Sweet Banana AJ for the jazz routine.

426
00:36:50,414 --> 00:36:52,456
[SPEAKER_03]: My sweet, my sweet banana...

427
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:56,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I hear that song, I think of the Abra, Abra.

428
00:36:56,692 --> 00:37:00,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you noticed how many Parapara songs are rip-offs of old 80 tunes that steal the tunes?

429
00:37:01,456 --> 00:37:04,198
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that one, and then there's... Irene, you know some of these.

430
00:37:04,278 --> 00:37:06,360
[SPEAKER_03]: The Parasongs that sound like other normal songs.

431
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,801
The Ghostbusters song.

432
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:08,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one's that?

433
00:37:09,042 --> 00:37:13,146
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be... Oh, Deluxe.

434
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:15,688
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's Aishitai Masu.

435
00:37:15,788 --> 00:37:16,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Aishitai Masu.

436
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:16,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

437
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,020
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?

438
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,041
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one that rips off.

439
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:24,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking Highway to Hell, but that's High Energy from DDR Solo.

440
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sounds just like Highway to Hell.

441
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:35,008
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll pick song titles too and make up whole Eurobeat songs, like Like a Virgin.

442
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:38,350
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the other one that had Don't Stand So Close to Me?

443
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

444
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't Stand So Close?

445
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:41,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, whatever.

446
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:51,273
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know, the whole thing is that just about every song that was in Parapara was on one of the million initial D soundtracks.

447
00:37:53,214 --> 00:37:54,055
[SPEAKER_11]: And they all say fire.

448
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:54,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Ari?

449
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:55,716
[SPEAKER_03]: They all say fire.

450
00:37:55,736 --> 00:37:56,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they all say fire.

451
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:02,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, PVP is a really old thing to be talking about, but actually, locally, it's still kind of new to us.

452
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,649
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had a machine until about two months ago.

453
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:09,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but para para, I don't know, it's kind of getting old for me, but whatever.

454
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:12,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I think I have an answer to your not waking up.

455
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:13,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

456
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:20,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember on Tech TV, on the show The Screensavers, they reviewed an alarm clock called the Screaming Mimi 110.

457
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:25,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's a 110 decibel alarm clock, which is equivalent to a jet airplane.

458
00:38:25,758 --> 00:38:25,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

459
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:26,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

460
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:33,361
[SPEAKER_03]: My old roommate, my very first roommate, when I moved out of the dorms in college, I moved into an apartment, and my roommate had one of those clocks.

461
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:34,641
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just one of those clocks.

462
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:35,302
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a clock.

463
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:38,103
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an alarm clock for deaf people, is what it was.

464
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:40,203
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so loud every time it went off.

465
00:38:40,964 --> 00:38:46,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, my old apartment, I lived right by train tracks, so every time a train went by, I could sleep right through that.

466
00:38:46,766 --> 00:38:48,687
[SPEAKER_03]: But his alarm clock always woke me up.

467
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:50,247
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounded like a plane was landing in his room.

468
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:50,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like...

469
00:38:52,648 --> 00:38:55,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so incredibly loud, you would not even believe.

470
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:04,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what was funny is also, they were reviewing the fact that there's Screaming Me 220, which I just can't imagine that.

471
00:39:05,835 --> 00:39:07,816
[SPEAKER_11]: That's for people who actually want to be deaf.

472
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:13,679
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a long call for people who want to be deaf.

473
00:39:14,259 --> 00:39:16,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I could only live with that guy for six months.

474
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and his clock.

475
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:20,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe it's like for, you know, rock stars who are deaf anyway.

476
00:39:21,283 --> 00:39:21,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you think?

477
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:33,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize to any speakers that were blown out by my impersonation of my old roommate's alarm clock.

478
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,181
[SPEAKER_11]: And he held the microphone pretty far away.

479
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:42,873
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having a suggestion in the chatroom from Pyroman saying to wake up to let them move every morning.

480
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:45,395
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll get you right out of bed.

481
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:46,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just put it this way.

482
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:47,397
[SPEAKER_03]: That won't make me get out of bed.

483
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:48,618
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll make me want to end my life.

484
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,462
[SPEAKER_03]: The screaming 220 can be heard up to a mile away.

485
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:54,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

486
00:39:54,744 --> 00:39:58,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, no.

487
00:39:58,528 --> 00:39:58,648
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

488
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:00,330
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

489
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:07,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, in case you missed last week's show, by the way, we did determine the worst Mamani song in history next to Let Them Move.

490
00:40:07,857 --> 00:40:09,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

491
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:12,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bye Bye Baby Balloon will never be played on this.

492
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And this wasn't just our decision.

493
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:14,082
[SPEAKER_03]: We helped.

494
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:18,265
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was the chat room that ultimately decided that Bye Bye Baby Balloon was the worst Mamani song ever.

495
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,767
[SPEAKER_11]: It still gets a mention in one of our provos.

496
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:20,647
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.

497
00:40:20,747 --> 00:40:21,388
[SPEAKER_03]: It does get a mention.

498
00:40:21,408 --> 00:40:22,269
[SPEAKER_03]: But we, you know.

499
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:23,350
[SPEAKER_11]: But we won't play the song.

500
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:23,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we won't play it.

501
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:30,661
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone hasn't heard the promo, it's declared as crap.

502
00:40:31,202 --> 00:40:32,003
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's why.

503
00:40:33,205 --> 00:40:34,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And crap stinks, so flush it.

504
00:40:35,048 --> 00:40:35,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

505
00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:38,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about another big news item.

506
00:40:38,844 --> 00:40:43,087
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been the biggest news in the DDR scene in forever.

507
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read this.

508
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:48,510
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in Replay Magazine, which is an industry magazine for arcade coin-ops.

509
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, Konami's U.S.

510
00:40:50,711 --> 00:40:52,212
[SPEAKER_03]: coin-op office is to close.

511
00:40:52,552 --> 00:41:03,539
[SPEAKER_03]: The Konami of America's coin-op office in Buffalo Grove, Illinois will close its doors at the end of September with future game sales being handled by an as-yet-to-be-named third-party exclusive distributor in the U.S.,

512
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:05,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Factory execs in the U.S.

513
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,843
[SPEAKER_03]: have yet to issue a public statement confirming the move.

514
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:11,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is still kind of hearsay at this point, but it's pretty much been widely determined.

515
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:16,891
[SPEAKER_03]: There was speculation before this news item hit, and now it's kind of just being more and more confirmed.

516
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:29,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the Japanese manufacturer, which has a consumer game office in California and gaming operations in Nevada, will maintain a small service department to handle support for its existing units in the field, like all those silent scope machines.

517
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:40,530
[SPEAKER_03]: According to what Replay Magazine has so far, Konami is also expected to exhibit at this fall's AMOA Expo in Las Vegas, possibly with their new sales and marketing partner.

518
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's been quite an interesting story lately.

519
00:41:43,953 --> 00:41:47,976
[SPEAKER_03]: People are saying, oh, that's it, DDR is dead in the US.

520
00:41:49,096 --> 00:41:50,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't go that far.

521
00:41:50,277 --> 00:41:52,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's kind of screaming that the sky is falling.

522
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:57,282
[SPEAKER_11]: It never once said that they were going to, you know, not manufacture the games 100%.

523
00:41:58,342 --> 00:41:59,543
[SPEAKER_11]: They have another distributor.

524
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:04,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And they still don't appear to give a shit about imports, so hey, I think we're going to be okay.

525
00:42:04,806 --> 00:42:13,211
[SPEAKER_11]: No, so that's another thing, Austin, to put an end to that rumor that was brought to our attention last week, too, regarding, you know, them hunting down Dromania machines and taking them out.

526
00:42:13,852 --> 00:42:18,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, go after, you know, all two copies of pop music that are in, you know, the country.

527
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So we still don't know what's going to happen with DDR.

528
00:42:21,412 --> 00:42:22,473
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be a good thing.

529
00:42:22,513 --> 00:42:30,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe this third-party distributor is going to take something like Max 2, just make it, you know, maybe have some... I don't know how it all works, really, in the industry.

530
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:34,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Konami makes it better, or they help make it better, and then, you know, put it out.

531
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:38,673
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe this third-party distributor is going to listen to us, you know, really good.

532
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:49,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, working at a video distributor company, it's pretty much a lot of the companies out there that manufacture machines and distribute them, they want to cut costs.

533
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:52,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only way they can do that is not distribute them and go third party.

534
00:42:52,596 --> 00:42:57,397
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way it saves on them having shipping facilities and all that kind of stuff.

535
00:42:57,797 --> 00:42:59,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're going to cut costs that way.

536
00:42:59,138 --> 00:43:00,498
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't mean they're not going to make any gains.

537
00:43:00,518 --> 00:43:05,199
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going through someone else to distribute them, which is really common in all the industries out there.

538
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:16,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think maybe it's possible that this third party distributor is going to come out and go, okay, we've got a problem with these imports because we're trying to put out a new USA mix here and we've got a problem with your imports.

539
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:17,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that might happen?

540
00:43:17,717 --> 00:43:19,338
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they have nothing to say with it.

541
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:26,865
[SPEAKER_06]: All the distributors do is take someone's game and basically sell that product to whoever.

542
00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:27,806
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all they do.

543
00:43:27,886 --> 00:43:30,328
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't do anything as far as recalling games.

544
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:31,228
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all Konami.

545
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:33,410
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're nothing but highly trained monkeys, basically.

546
00:43:34,371 --> 00:43:35,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm getting nodded yes.

547
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:41,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And DDR Max USA, not affected from what we hear so far.

548
00:43:41,636 --> 00:43:43,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Still looking to be a damn good release.

549
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:45,698
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be the biggest home release of DDR ever.

550
00:43:45,718 --> 00:43:47,158
[SPEAKER_03]: 65-something songs.

551
00:43:48,979 --> 00:43:49,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

552
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,442
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe possibly the only thing that could be affected is any kind of arcade link.

553
00:43:53,502 --> 00:43:54,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows what happens?

554
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:55,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they don't know what's going to happen yet.

555
00:43:55,483 --> 00:43:56,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only coin-op.

556
00:43:56,423 --> 00:43:56,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

557
00:43:56,663 --> 00:44:02,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the thing is, they're still selling their own home games online.

558
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:05,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Konami makes, you know, a good number of games.

559
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:10,567
[SPEAKER_11]: And even so, you know, they've still got, you know, like they're keeping that small servicing up.

560
00:44:10,587 --> 00:44:15,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, they still have tons of classic games out that are going to be servicing, like the Turtles in Time at Roseville Golf Land.

561
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:18,450
[SPEAKER_11]: That game is so cool.

562
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:21,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we are geeks.

563
00:44:24,514 --> 00:44:26,616
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, we digress.

564
00:44:27,296 --> 00:44:36,063
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got so many games that have been released as far as arcade games that are going to need that servicing in the future, so it's a good thing that they keep that office open.

565
00:44:36,504 --> 00:44:39,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Their distributor is not really going to be able to do much about that anyway.

566
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:42,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Jabberwocky has a very good point in our chat room.

567
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:44,292
[SPEAKER_03]: It's saying it's not a bad move.

568
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:45,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the movie industry.

569
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:50,578
[SPEAKER_03]: They work the exact same way, and they're pretty darn good at distributing the movies to the theaters.

570
00:44:51,139 --> 00:44:53,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe this is just going to get DDR out there even more.

571
00:44:54,782 --> 00:44:55,523
[SPEAKER_11]: I can even say that.

572
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:55,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

573
00:44:56,264 --> 00:44:58,085
[SPEAKER_03]: You did kind of just say the same damn thing.

574
00:44:58,126 --> 00:44:59,307
[SPEAKER_03]: But you work for...

575
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:04,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Thinking about it as video and thinking about the actual movie is two different things.

576
00:45:04,888 --> 00:45:07,549
[SPEAKER_11]: I worked in the mortgage industry for two years.

577
00:45:07,669 --> 00:45:24,672
[SPEAKER_11]: A mortgage company or a bank is often going to buy out a third-party servicer to handle loans, collections, because it's too much money that's going to cost them to train, to have these people hired, trained to take care of the employee base.

578
00:45:24,752 --> 00:45:28,473
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look at it from that standpoint as well, Konami is a corporation.

579
00:45:29,433 --> 00:45:31,774
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to save them a lot of money over time.

580
00:45:32,374 --> 00:45:35,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Less money that they spend on actually having to worry about the distribution.

581
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:38,836
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be more money put into other things.

582
00:45:38,976 --> 00:45:41,616
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like it's not the end of the world.

583
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:46,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some things are going to change, but it sounds like for the most part, it can't be a totally bad thing.

584
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:48,078
[SPEAKER_03]: It might just be better.

585
00:45:48,098 --> 00:45:49,399
[SPEAKER_03]: It might get DDR some more exposure.

586
00:45:49,419 --> 00:45:52,019
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to hopefully do some things that Konami wasn't able to do.

587
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:56,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And Max USA still sounds like it's going to be pretty kick-ass.

588
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,401
[SPEAKER_11]: That is going to be a winner.

589
00:45:58,905 --> 00:46:01,386
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 new songs that haven't been in any mix yet

590
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:21,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching.

591
00:46:21,495 --> 00:46:21,855
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.

592
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:41,338
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

593
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:09,200
[SPEAKER_03]: and MixUpDenjinJ, which is the full version we're going to hear, which is another one of these six-style hidden tracks.

594
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,026
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be somewhat of a long break, but we'll come back right about 8 o'clock.

595
00:47:13,146 --> 00:47:15,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll try to get to as many requests as I can for the night's up.

596
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:50,932
Thanks for watching!

597
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:07,013
Thanks for watching!

598
00:52:32,854 --> 00:52:33,655
Thanks for watching!

599
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:26,818
Thanks for watching!

600
00:55:07,982 --> 00:55:08,606
Thanks for watching!

601
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,639
Thanks for watching!

602
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:07,680
Thanks for watching!

603
00:58:00,862 --> 00:58:06,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge by Money Music and More show?

604
00:58:06,807 --> 00:58:13,953
[SPEAKER_02]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

605
00:58:14,293 --> 00:58:16,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unearthly.

606
00:58:16,495 --> 00:58:20,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

607
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Euromix 2 Euromix 2

608
00:58:40,305 --> 00:58:45,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, Euromix 1 was out in the UK for quite a while now.

609
00:58:45,871 --> 00:58:51,637
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been using the old third mix engine that we're all familiar with from USA.

610
00:58:52,538 --> 00:58:56,482
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it's really old, so they decided to update their new thing.

611
00:58:56,522 --> 00:58:58,504
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually Euromix 2 or Euromax.

612
00:58:59,284 --> 00:59:03,389
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably going to use either, I'm guessing it would be the DDR Max 2 engine for it.

613
00:59:03,869 --> 00:59:04,489
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

614
00:59:24,702 --> 00:59:28,004
[SPEAKER_06]: The song list is pretty good, actually.

615
00:59:28,045 --> 00:59:32,328
[SPEAKER_06]: They've teamed up with EMI Records and also Zumba Records.

616
00:59:33,289 --> 00:59:34,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Britney Spears' Zumba?

617
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:35,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

618
00:59:35,912 --> 00:59:36,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dear God.

619
00:59:36,732 --> 00:59:39,375
[SPEAKER_06]: But, well, it's okay.

620
00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:44,719
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a few songs I've heard of, like 5678 by The Steps.

621
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:45,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know what, Matt?

622
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have 5678 by The Steps queued up here, so let's hear a little bit of this.

623
00:59:50,097 --> 00:59:51,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't I good here?

624
00:59:51,158 --> 00:59:52,318
[SPEAKER_03]: We got one of these songs.

625
00:59:52,358 --> 00:59:55,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a preview of what one of the new Euromix songs is going to be like.

626
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to play a little bit of it here for you.

627
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,141
Kind of a little bit repetitive here.

628
00:59:59,161 --> 01:00:01,562
No, this is not the song that Billy had to dance to.

629
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,123
That song was called Tragedy.

630
01:00:15,512 --> 01:00:17,132
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of what it's on.

631
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:21,134
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of probably going to have a lot of little 12th notes in it or something.

632
01:00:21,154 --> 01:00:24,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, it sounds much like Cowgirl or something like that.

633
01:00:27,175 --> 01:00:28,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, something like that.

634
01:00:28,856 --> 01:00:29,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Boot scootin' baby.

635
01:00:29,716 --> 01:00:31,456
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like club country music.

636
01:00:31,516 --> 01:00:32,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know.

637
01:00:32,757 --> 01:00:38,438
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny because one of the other songs in there is going to be Cotton Eye Joe, which is a country sounding song.

638
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,319
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Cotton Eye Joe is going to be in there.

639
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:44,220
[SPEAKER_19]: And unfortunately, it looks like Let Them Move is going to be on there, too.

640
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,542
[SPEAKER_11]: That means that people get to hear me scream loudly.

641
01:00:48,363 --> 01:00:48,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

642
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:55,089
[SPEAKER_03]: This again, in case you missed it, playing in the background is 5678 by Steps, which is going to be one of the new songs in Euromix.

643
01:00:55,130 --> 01:01:02,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the other new songs will be Caribbean Queen by Billy Ocean, Aaron's Party, Come and Get It by Aaron Carter.

644
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:03,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

645
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wet.

646
01:01:06,981 --> 01:01:09,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't try to stop it by Roman Holiday.

647
01:01:10,563 --> 01:01:13,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, I Want You to Want Me by Solid Harmony.

648
01:01:14,025 --> 01:01:16,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that I want you to want me?

649
01:01:16,766 --> 01:01:18,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably a cover of the old Cheap Trick song.

650
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:22,529
[SPEAKER_06]: The Vibe is Right by Ruby Turner.

651
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:28,973
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, let's see, we've got Stomp, also by the Steps, same people that are doing 5, 6, 7, 8.

652
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:31,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I bet you, Steps is broken up already.

653
01:01:31,834 --> 01:01:37,157
[SPEAKER_03]: They broke up last year, so it's probably a similar kind of thing to, like, SmileDK, where they're getting all these songs from bands that have been broken up.

654
01:01:37,637 --> 01:01:38,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

655
01:01:38,457 --> 01:01:41,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, see, then we have That Is In, This Is Now by High Five.

656
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:51,526
[SPEAKER_06]: What's pretty cool though is they've actually got a lot of the stuff from older mixes that we don't have in our Max 2, but some of it's pretty good.

657
01:01:51,846 --> 01:01:56,730
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting some of the Max 2 stuff like Living in America and the Reflex and that kind of thing.

658
01:01:58,111 --> 01:02:05,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they're getting some of the Oni songs that were in Max 2 that we aren't getting.

659
01:02:06,296 --> 01:02:08,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Hysteria is one of them, right?

660
01:02:08,457 --> 01:02:11,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Hysteria 2001 and D4U, the KOGG3 mix.

661
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:16,362
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting those and Spin the Disc and all that stuff.

662
01:02:16,402 --> 01:02:17,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad's in the corner whining.

663
01:02:18,684 --> 01:02:22,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they're going to be having some DDR Max 3 songs in there.

664
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:29,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they've got some new... These are some of the new originals that we should probably expect for Max 3.

665
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:34,235
[SPEAKER_06]: They have Vanity Angel by Fix.

666
01:02:34,295 --> 01:02:37,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Memories, it's a new Naoki featuring Paula Terry song.

667
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:42,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have Crash by Mr. Brian and the Final Band.

668
01:02:43,161 --> 01:02:45,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, back the train the fuck up.

669
01:02:46,283 --> 01:02:50,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Paula Terry is a very talented young lady, and I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate you guys talking about her like that.

670
01:02:51,427 --> 01:02:53,068
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but, Brad, it sucks.

671
01:02:53,209 --> 01:02:54,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was the only...

672
01:02:56,491 --> 01:03:01,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, the Naoki teaching voluntary Oni mode has got to be the best Oni mode there is.

673
01:03:01,994 --> 01:03:02,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Oni, of course.

674
01:03:03,434 --> 01:03:05,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here we go, here we go.

675
01:03:05,155 --> 01:03:06,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Go through your little thing.

676
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:07,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I have something to say about that, Brad.

677
01:03:07,856 --> 01:03:08,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, just a minute.

678
01:03:08,737 --> 01:03:09,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Your digital reply.

679
01:03:09,457 --> 01:03:10,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, let's see.

680
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:12,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my reply here somewhere.

681
01:03:12,178 --> 01:03:12,979
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't browse through your reply.

682
01:03:12,999 --> 01:03:13,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is it?

683
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:14,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, here it is.

684
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that makes me feel warm inside.

685
01:03:19,202 --> 01:03:19,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Warm and squishy.

686
01:03:23,225 --> 01:03:29,991
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there have been, I can't say that the music is bad, but Politary can't hold a tune.

687
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:31,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say this, I'll say this.

688
01:03:31,452 --> 01:03:39,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Email Me, that's a cool one, and I like, yeah, it's Politary, and I like, yeah, it's Politary, and I like, I like Still in My Heart.

689
01:03:39,739 --> 01:03:40,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like that song.

690
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,682
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, Destiny, yuck.

691
01:03:43,983 --> 01:03:46,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is musical harassment, and I don't have to take it.

692
01:03:47,085 --> 01:03:47,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm leaving.

693
01:03:48,766 --> 01:03:50,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go play your Game Boy.

694
01:03:50,348 --> 01:03:51,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Go play your Game Boy.

695
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:53,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Matt wants to give us news now.

696
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:54,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt, you want to talk?

697
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:54,971
[SPEAKER_03]: We have news.

698
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:56,832
[SPEAKER_04]: You hate Politeira too, don't you?

699
01:03:58,973 --> 01:03:59,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you gay?

700
01:04:01,515 --> 01:04:02,215
[SPEAKER_04]: You're taking the ass.

701
01:04:02,796 --> 01:04:03,456
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell?

702
01:04:03,956 --> 01:04:04,717
[SPEAKER_06]: That was random.

703
01:04:05,577 --> 01:04:05,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you gay?

704
01:04:06,098 --> 01:04:08,159
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, and no.

705
01:04:11,068 --> 01:04:11,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

706
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:15,550
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that they don't mention in here is Max Unlimited.

707
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:19,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably my guess would be they're having some sort of unlocked thing.

708
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:21,092
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just being a secret.

709
01:04:21,112 --> 01:04:21,653
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making it a secret.

710
01:04:21,673 --> 01:04:23,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it's going to be a hidden track.

711
01:04:23,053 --> 01:04:23,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoop-de-doo.

712
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they're probably getting Burning Heat as another hidden track.

713
01:04:27,995 --> 01:04:31,397
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're probably going to have some hidden tracks and a similar unlocked system to Max too.

714
01:04:31,917 --> 01:04:32,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray for them.

715
01:04:33,718 --> 01:04:38,380
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm still planning on eventually one of these days making an edit for Burning Heat and calling it Prep H.

716
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:47,628
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think that would be a very good title for this test.

717
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh, uh-oh.

718
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad went and got backups.

719
01:04:52,371 --> 01:04:53,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Politary.

720
01:04:53,352 --> 01:04:54,173
[SPEAKER_08]: She's pretty cool.

721
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:55,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, bye.

722
01:04:55,153 --> 01:04:56,494
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

723
01:04:56,614 --> 01:04:57,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, bye.

724
01:05:11,781 --> 01:05:12,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

725
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,083
[SPEAKER_11]: How many people in the chatroom like Politary?

726
01:05:14,843 --> 01:05:15,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a quick vote.

727
01:05:17,165 --> 01:05:20,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Who in the chatroom likes Politary and who thinks Politary just needs to go away?

728
01:05:21,508 --> 01:05:21,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

729
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:26,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead and send in your votes and we'll see what the majority says.

730
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:32,115
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times are we going to talk about Politary on the show?

731
01:05:32,636 --> 01:05:34,217
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times can I work into puking sound?

732
01:05:35,157 --> 01:05:37,499
[SPEAKER_03]: How many songs total does it look like Euromix is going to be having?

733
01:05:39,411 --> 01:05:40,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me see here.

734
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:45,800
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot.

735
01:05:46,221 --> 01:05:47,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

736
01:05:47,702 --> 01:05:48,482
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to count.

737
01:05:48,522 --> 01:05:49,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of guess.

738
01:05:49,063 --> 01:05:55,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe they're supposed to have 65 songs other than... I don't know.

739
01:05:55,427 --> 01:05:56,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see here.

740
01:05:56,588 --> 01:05:56,948
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot?

741
01:05:58,389 --> 01:05:59,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll stick with a lot.

742
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:02,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and the chat room says, Politary dies.

743
01:06:03,072 --> 01:06:04,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Politary fucking owns.

744
01:06:04,513 --> 01:06:06,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Politary is as cool as the center of hell.

745
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:07,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Politary sucks.

746
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:09,877
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were a redhead, I'd do a rotten.

747
01:06:10,177 --> 01:06:11,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Politary is a no-talent whore.

748
01:06:12,138 --> 01:06:13,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And I vote for Osamu Kubota.

749
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:14,259
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

750
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:18,684
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

751
01:06:21,306 --> 01:06:26,772
[SPEAKER_11]: For whoever said that Politary was as cool as the center of hell, you had to have read The Inferno if you meant that in a good way.

752
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:30,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Politary is really awesome.

753
01:06:30,776 --> 01:06:32,077
[SPEAKER_11]: She's from Australia.

754
01:06:32,918 --> 01:06:33,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so is Kylie Minogue.

755
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:36,421
[SPEAKER_11]: So is Olivia Newton-John, and she did Xanadu.

756
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:37,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kylie Minogue's good, too.

757
01:06:43,274 --> 01:06:43,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it sounds like 68.

758
01:06:44,854 --> 01:06:45,834
[SPEAKER_11]: 68, that's the word.

759
01:06:46,074 --> 01:06:50,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I wonder, could this be some kind of example of what we could be seeing with USMAX?

760
01:06:50,615 --> 01:06:53,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's about how many songs are supposed to be in USMAX.

761
01:06:55,256 --> 01:06:57,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I onto something?

762
01:06:57,296 --> 01:06:58,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, here would be the difference here.

763
01:06:59,457 --> 01:07:05,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, USMAX, some of the songs wouldn't work just right, especially when it comes to editing them.

764
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:10,219
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have probably a Britney Spears song in there, one or two.

765
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:12,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Aaron Carter, David and Backstreet Boys.

766
01:07:12,859 --> 01:07:15,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's going to be a boy band somewhere around here.

767
01:07:17,062 --> 01:07:18,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Cher even.

768
01:07:19,684 --> 01:07:20,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Boycott the boy band.

769
01:07:24,148 --> 01:07:38,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, first of all, I will personally write a scathing letter to Konami of America if there is any... You know, okay, I know that there's people who like boy bands, but don't expect... You know, I'm going to do exactly the same thing I did with the mix of Oops!

770
01:07:38,499 --> 01:07:41,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I Did It Again and Fifth Mix and never play it and go plug my ears when it's on.

771
01:07:43,311 --> 01:07:43,691
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here.

772
01:07:44,312 --> 01:07:45,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's been quite adamant in here.

773
01:07:45,612 --> 01:07:47,473
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we will not have boy bands.

774
01:07:47,593 --> 01:07:49,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody with some insider information there.

775
01:07:49,374 --> 01:07:54,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's going to be the Let Them Trance, you know, the trance version of Let Them Move, of course.

776
01:07:56,314 --> 01:07:57,134
[SPEAKER_06]: That was horrible.

777
01:07:57,635 --> 01:07:58,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Boo!

778
01:07:58,695 --> 01:07:59,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I've let them move.

779
01:08:01,597 --> 01:08:09,240
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm going to continue to always show my support for Konami, even if, you know, we happen to do get a lot of, you know, get some crappy boy bands and let them move.

780
01:08:09,861 --> 01:08:16,104
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there are legitimately people who like those songs, although those people also probably have had lobotomies, too.

781
01:08:17,184 --> 01:08:19,385
[SPEAKER_13]: So... I'm sorry, hold on.

782
01:08:19,645 --> 01:08:21,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen a picture of Politary?

783
01:08:21,605 --> 01:08:21,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no.

784
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:23,306
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who she looks like?

785
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:23,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Who?

786
01:08:24,026 --> 01:08:26,127
[SPEAKER_08]: That chick on Magnolia that's the druggie?

787
01:08:27,667 --> 01:08:29,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't remember her name.

788
01:08:29,168 --> 01:08:30,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay, I know who you're talking about.

789
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:31,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she looks like her.

790
01:08:31,568 --> 01:08:36,230
[SPEAKER_08]: She's all skinny and, like, blonde and really, like, anorexic looking and stuff.

791
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:37,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And she wears really dark lipstick.

792
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:39,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for that.

793
01:08:40,151 --> 01:08:41,831
[SPEAKER_03]: That little, uh, hint.

794
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,712
[SPEAKER_08]: It really gives a shit, you know, yeah.

795
01:08:46,019 --> 01:08:52,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it has been confirmed, by the way, by Economy of America represented, that DDR Max USA will have no Let Them Move whatsoever.

796
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:55,042
[SPEAKER_03]: No mixes, no nothing.

797
01:08:55,182 --> 01:08:55,882
[SPEAKER_11]: I had remembered that.

798
01:08:55,922 --> 01:08:58,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the British one is going to have Let Them Move.

799
01:08:58,463 --> 01:09:00,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the thing is, to each their own, that's what I always say.

800
01:09:00,943 --> 01:09:07,485
[SPEAKER_11]: However, you know, if the majority says that we know we don't want this, then I'm glad that they're finally listening to that.

801
01:09:07,565 --> 01:09:10,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, have you heard the new song by Outphase?

802
01:09:10,326 --> 01:09:11,906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a new Let Them Move remix.

803
01:09:11,946 --> 01:09:12,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

804
01:09:12,806 --> 01:09:14,547
[SPEAKER_11]: And Outphase, Let Them Move.

805
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:18,656
[SPEAKER_11]: You know that actually might be cool?

806
01:09:18,676 --> 01:09:20,419
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

807
01:09:22,764 --> 01:09:25,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so Euromix 2, right.

808
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:26,531
[SPEAKER_11]: But we love Konami.

809
01:09:28,114 --> 01:09:28,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

810
01:09:30,556 --> 01:09:31,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody sent me a file.

811
01:09:32,717 --> 01:09:33,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I got a picture.

812
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:34,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

813
01:09:34,298 --> 01:09:35,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to open this up.

814
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:37,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I should not leave my file transferred.

815
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:38,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't even be saying that.

816
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:39,660
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on right away.

817
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:40,400
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

818
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,620
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a picture of Politary.

819
01:09:43,181 --> 01:09:45,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Politary looks like she wants to be a goth girl.

820
01:09:45,762 --> 01:09:47,803
[SPEAKER_03]: She does look kind of goth, don't you think?

821
01:09:48,627 --> 01:09:49,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe she's slightly cool.

822
01:09:50,168 --> 01:09:50,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

823
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:51,068
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

824
01:09:51,429 --> 01:09:52,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool like the grave.

825
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:57,111
[SPEAKER_03]: She needs to just maybe do some nude photography instead of singing.

826
01:09:57,672 --> 01:10:00,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get a yes from Brad.

827
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:02,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for sending me that file.

828
01:10:03,014 --> 01:10:03,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

829
01:10:05,656 --> 01:10:06,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Pyro Man sent me that file.

830
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:07,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

831
01:10:08,077 --> 01:10:11,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the lovely picture of the lovely and not-so-talented Politary.

832
01:10:14,388 --> 01:10:15,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Matt has a comment.

833
01:10:16,809 --> 01:10:21,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, also, the new cabinet that your Mix 2 is going to have, that's actually going to be the same thing for Max 3.

834
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:23,952
[SPEAKER_06]: They're upgrading, I guess, the hardware for that, too.

835
01:10:24,332 --> 01:10:25,733
[SPEAKER_11]: We can get big and shiny.

836
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:26,393
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

837
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:28,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It is about time they did that, though, don't you think?

838
01:10:28,374 --> 01:10:30,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Max 2, it seems like they're really pushing the limits of Max 2.

839
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:36,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody keeps saying they need to have a DDR mix that has everything in it.

840
01:10:36,617 --> 01:10:36,877
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S,

841
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:04,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of why I like the 5th Mixin' Up, you know, little navigational thing.

842
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:09,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can put it in alphabetical order or order by difficulty or speed or something like that.

843
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,507
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty good, don't you think?

844
01:11:11,148 --> 01:11:17,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, do you think they're actually going to call it DDR Max 3 Subtitle Dance Dance Revolution Aderd Mix?

845
01:11:17,811 --> 01:11:18,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Aderd!

846
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:18,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.

847
01:11:18,991 --> 01:11:19,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Aderd?

848
01:11:19,612 --> 01:11:20,112
[SPEAKER_11]: We need Aderd.

849
01:11:20,132 --> 01:11:20,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Aderd.

850
01:11:21,132 --> 01:11:24,354
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, how when you beat the Oni courses, it says you got to the Aderd stage?

851
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:27,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad finally gets that joke.

852
01:11:27,875 --> 01:11:29,476
[SPEAKER_03]: But Brad doesn't play online much, so he doesn't.

853
01:11:30,678 --> 01:11:31,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the internet.

854
01:11:32,339 --> 01:11:33,259
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the internet?

855
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I invented that.

856
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,101
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, Brad.

857
01:11:36,281 --> 01:11:37,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're on real radio.

858
01:11:38,182 --> 01:11:40,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, Miss Al Gore down there on the floor invented the internet, yeah.

859
01:11:42,784 --> 01:11:44,385
[SPEAKER_08]: They're playing Paul and Terry out there.

860
01:11:44,405 --> 01:11:45,205
[SPEAKER_08]: They're playing Love Again.

861
01:11:45,505 --> 01:11:47,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why... It's out in the other room.

862
01:11:47,106 --> 01:11:49,107
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 2DX's fifth style going on.

863
01:11:49,147 --> 01:11:51,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we weren't cool enough to get sixth style this week, we're...

864
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:56,174
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the intranet?

865
01:11:56,915 --> 01:11:57,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I want one of those.

866
01:11:57,796 --> 01:11:58,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get me one of them.

867
01:11:58,997 --> 01:12:00,639
[SPEAKER_04]: We just got new rams today.

868
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:02,801
[SPEAKER_04]: We got more rams in my computer.

869
01:12:03,062 --> 01:12:03,983
[SPEAKER_11]: That was bad.

870
01:12:05,544 --> 01:12:07,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, enough about Paul and Terry.

871
01:12:07,266 --> 01:12:08,347
[SPEAKER_03]: This show's getting really lame.

872
01:12:08,627 --> 01:12:12,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you are cool.

873
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:14,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Next!

874
01:12:17,141 --> 01:12:18,582
[SPEAKER_11]: So, what's next?

875
01:12:18,602 --> 01:12:19,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is for you, Brad.

876
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:20,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

877
01:12:22,063 --> 01:12:23,123
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the Brad theme.

878
01:12:23,163 --> 01:12:25,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time Brad walks in the room and opens his mouth.

879
01:12:26,464 --> 01:12:26,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

880
01:12:27,004 --> 01:12:28,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Our germania is broken.

881
01:12:29,985 --> 01:12:30,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Our symbol is broken.

882
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:31,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that say rim job?

883
01:12:32,326 --> 01:12:32,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Our hi-hat.

884
01:12:32,926 --> 01:12:33,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, rim shot.

885
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:34,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Rim shot.

886
01:12:34,787 --> 01:12:37,408
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, how about a report on the condition of the machines at Golfland?

887
01:12:38,147 --> 01:12:39,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Minnesota is part of the U.S., you dumbass.

888
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:05,294
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, you know, for all of our international listeners, no, we're not, you know, the prime example of all Americans.

889
01:13:05,394 --> 01:13:06,534
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just, you know, the cool people.

890
01:13:07,355 --> 01:13:08,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're the best ones.

891
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:11,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody wishes they were like us.

892
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:21,003
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do sometimes, since we are kind of locally based, all the guests you see on the show do come from the same area and play mostly at the same arcade.

893
01:13:21,343 --> 01:13:23,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we like to rant about our local arcade.

894
01:13:23,284 --> 01:13:25,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to give an update, status update on all the machines.

895
01:13:25,886 --> 01:13:26,226
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

896
01:13:26,386 --> 01:13:27,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Matt was just there today.

897
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:28,027
[SPEAKER_03]: He can help out, too.

898
01:13:28,047 --> 01:13:28,287
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

899
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:43,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, last I noticed, and please correct me if I'm wrong, last I noticed, starting with the farthest corner by the bathroom, Beatmania, well, Hip Hop Mania, Complete Mix 2, is still having issues with their drop-loading coin swap, which they need to actually replace, like the one at Milpitas Golf Land.

900
01:13:43,525 --> 01:13:45,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the screen's really tweaking out now.

901
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,069
[SPEAKER_11]: That's to be expected.

902
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,610
[SPEAKER_11]: The machine's been there for how long?

903
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:50,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, at least two years?

904
01:13:51,212 --> 01:13:52,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's really twisted.

905
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:56,817
[SPEAKER_11]: I played it from the day that they got it in, so, even though I was really sucky at it.

906
01:13:58,398 --> 01:13:59,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Guitar Freaks is actually working.

907
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,861
[SPEAKER_11]: The controllers seem to be fine.

908
01:14:01,901 --> 01:14:02,641
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that was great.

909
01:14:03,582 --> 01:14:05,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Drum Mania, the hi-hat is broken.

910
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:13,935
[SPEAKER_11]: That, for the people who don't really bother themselves with the names of the different censors, that is the far left symbol.

911
01:14:14,836 --> 01:14:17,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Guitar Breaks is still doing the CD-ROM error thing.

912
01:14:18,099 --> 01:14:18,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it is?

913
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:18,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

914
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:19,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they sessioning?

915
01:14:20,441 --> 01:14:20,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you notice?

916
01:14:21,482 --> 01:14:23,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't play session because it sucks.

917
01:14:23,914 --> 01:14:24,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Session is fun.

918
01:14:25,135 --> 01:14:25,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Keyboard Mania.

919
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:33,460
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like they finally got the keyboards replaced in time for someone to rip off the far right key on the second controller side.

920
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh boy.

921
01:14:34,521 --> 01:14:35,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

922
01:14:35,161 --> 01:14:36,322
[SPEAKER_11]: We will find them and murder them.

923
01:14:36,342 --> 01:14:37,163
[SPEAKER_19]: About GF.

924
01:14:37,503 --> 01:14:41,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I heard a screw was missing on one of the guitar things.

925
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:51,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, with Keyword Mania, I guess they have been having problems with people stealing the keys again, so they actually turned the whole machine around.

926
01:14:51,998 --> 01:14:56,642
[SPEAKER_06]: So now the front is facing where the back was, and so no one can play it, and no one can tamper with it.

927
01:14:56,862 --> 01:15:06,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Quite honestly, I think they should do with that as they did with Guitar Freak's fifth mix when we first got it in, and put it by the back counter so that the staff can better keep an eye on it.

928
01:15:06,389 --> 01:15:06,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, definitely.

929
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:10,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not session anymore, so it doesn't really matter where it's at.

930
01:15:10,972 --> 01:15:20,479
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little bit better to be slightly inconvenienced to walk, oh, the few feet to the back of the building, as opposed to having them destroy a game that a lot of people really like.

931
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:26,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, DDR USA, well, I personally don't know because I don't play it.

932
01:15:26,543 --> 01:15:27,704
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to be working alright.

933
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:32,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Max 2 seemed to be just fine when I was playing on it.

934
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:33,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still loud.

935
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:37,631
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still, you know, bass is way too high and it's still eating coins every now and then.

936
01:15:37,671 --> 01:15:39,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Same with Drum Mania is starting to do that now, too.

937
01:15:40,481 --> 01:15:42,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's just, all that takes is maintenance and then fixing them.

938
01:15:42,662 --> 01:15:45,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's because they don't like to screw the coin sides to where they're supposed to be.

939
01:15:45,962 --> 01:15:47,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, get them to sit there.

940
01:15:47,483 --> 01:15:49,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, para para worked just fine.

941
01:15:49,603 --> 01:15:52,424
[SPEAKER_11]: I did actually notice some sensor issues.

942
01:15:53,604 --> 01:15:56,365
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like one of the sides has drooped down just a little bit.

943
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I think people have been, you know, hopping up there and holding on to the thing.

944
01:15:59,866 --> 01:16:05,407
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't blame them for not being able to read the warning since it's in Japanese, but still, you know, they should know better.

945
01:16:05,447 --> 01:16:06,128
[SPEAKER_11]: It's common sense.

946
01:16:06,188 --> 01:16:07,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, not enough people have it.

947
01:16:09,292 --> 01:16:13,878
[SPEAKER_11]: And on another note, most of the coin slots on Turtles in Time is broken.

948
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:14,860
[SPEAKER_11]: I am upset.

949
01:16:16,743 --> 01:16:17,183
[SPEAKER_06]: That is all.

950
01:16:17,784 --> 01:16:17,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

951
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:21,109
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all.

952
01:16:21,129 --> 01:16:22,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for that lovely update.

953
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:24,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to take another quick break.

954
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:31,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we come back, we're going to talk about... Why don't we go ahead and do the best 2DX song?

955
01:16:32,482 --> 01:16:34,522
[SPEAKER_03]: To celebrate Kind of Sick style a little bit.

956
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:37,683
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to narrow it down to what the best 2DX song in history is.

957
01:16:38,543 --> 01:16:39,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds fun to you guys?

958
01:16:40,604 --> 01:16:45,908
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll come back and we're going to do a little segment we call List List with the best 2DX song ever.

959
01:16:46,008 --> 01:16:50,531
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys in the chat room are going to be the ones that ultimately decide what it is.

960
01:16:50,871 --> 01:16:52,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So get on in our chat room right away.

961
01:16:52,713 --> 01:17:04,881
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on irc.eggheads.org or karma.othersideirc.net Just any other side IRC server that you can think of and you're just going to join Channel Orange Lounge.

962
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:08,924
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys can help us pick the best 2DX song ever.

963
01:17:09,545 --> 01:17:13,919
[SPEAKER_03]: and in this break we're going to hear a couple more requests and we'll be right back.

964
01:18:38,397 --> 01:18:39,118
Thanks for watching!

965
01:22:13,047 --> 01:22:13,458
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura

966
01:23:44,885 --> 01:23:50,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Balls

967
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever, ever, ever.

968
01:24:14,797 --> 01:24:17,498
[SPEAKER_03]: And to do that, we're going to do a little segment we call Listless.

969
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:26,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And participating today in the Listless segment will be myself, Jamie, Matt, Joe, Bradley, and Brad and Irene.

970
01:24:26,684 --> 01:24:31,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Since they're a couple, they're basically essentially one person, so they'll be doing one big list as one person.

971
01:24:32,047 --> 01:24:41,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're going to do is each of us are going to name off our top three songs, and then we get to go around and everybody will get to eliminate one song from the big list.

972
01:24:42,413 --> 01:25:11,537
[SPEAKER_03]: and then after that we'll have a list of let's see 12 songs unless there's some duplication we might have a little less but there'll be 12 or less songs and that's when you three or you guys in the chat room get to pick your top three songs and we'll do a vote over a really quick break we'll do about a three minute break that you guys will have to vote so and we're already getting people screaming in the chat room their votes but remember you guys can only vote for stuff that ends up on the list so if your stuff doesn't end up on the list sorry it just can't be considered you're only going to be able to vote for stuff that's on the list

973
01:25:12,062 --> 01:25:12,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Colors

974
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:23,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Any reason why?

975
01:25:24,782 --> 01:25:33,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been listening, that's like one of the few songs to recently come out for 2DX that I've literally listened to ten times in a row because I absolutely love the song.

976
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:34,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

977
01:25:35,471 --> 01:25:41,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's just, I don't know, it actually just sort of reminded me of a bunch of stuff, so I like it.

978
01:25:42,968 --> 01:25:45,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a note to the chat room, please don't flood your votes.

979
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:49,431
[SPEAKER_03]: We hear you loud and clear the first line, so you don't have to type it 60 times, your votes.

980
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:53,513
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three pick would be Star Mine.

981
01:25:53,933 --> 01:25:56,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say it would be one of the best 2DX songs.

982
01:25:56,154 --> 01:25:56,975
[SPEAKER_11]: And Waving Fun.

983
01:25:59,156 --> 01:26:01,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the video has a big part to do with that.

984
01:26:01,137 --> 01:26:01,897
[SPEAKER_03]: So who's going to go next?

985
01:26:01,937 --> 01:26:07,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe, you want to go next?

986
01:26:07,359 --> 01:26:07,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Cracker.

987
01:26:09,467 --> 01:26:10,087
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

988
01:26:10,187 --> 01:26:12,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we have the vote for Cracker.

989
01:26:13,388 --> 01:26:15,108
[SPEAKER_18]: Japanese hip-hop is funny.

990
01:26:15,628 --> 01:26:16,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is.

991
01:26:17,389 --> 01:26:18,529
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, and for Matt.

992
01:26:20,029 --> 01:26:29,771
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, my number three has to be... I guess it's going to have to be A. It's going to be A as your number three choice.

993
01:26:29,991 --> 01:26:31,211
[SPEAKER_03]: A from Seventh Style.

994
01:26:31,231 --> 01:26:31,251
[SPEAKER_03]: A?

995
01:26:31,991 --> 01:26:32,251
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

996
01:26:33,011 --> 01:26:33,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

997
01:26:33,931 --> 01:26:34,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other reasons?

998
01:26:34,472 --> 01:26:36,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to elaborate why or just because you like it?

999
01:26:38,604 --> 01:26:39,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Piano Ambient.

1000
01:26:40,365 --> 01:26:40,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1001
01:26:41,625 --> 01:26:42,646
[SPEAKER_11]: And next we have Bradley.

1002
01:26:44,847 --> 01:26:45,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I'll decide.

1003
01:26:46,347 --> 01:26:48,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually decided, so I'll go with number three as Calcutta.

1004
01:26:49,388 --> 01:26:50,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcutta!

1005
01:26:50,589 --> 01:26:51,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcutta!

1006
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:55,831
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun song and it has my favorite sequence in it to play.

1007
01:26:56,391 --> 01:26:56,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1008
01:26:58,132 --> 01:27:00,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, Brad and Irene as one person.

1009
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:02,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Our number three will have to be I Feel.

1010
01:27:02,694 --> 01:27:03,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I Feel, ah.

1011
01:27:04,694 --> 01:27:05,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1012
01:27:05,475 --> 01:27:06,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do you like that one?

1013
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:08,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel it's a great song.

1014
01:27:08,106 --> 01:27:09,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Your number two choice, Jamie.

1015
01:27:26,855 --> 01:27:27,675
[SPEAKER_11]: My number two choice?

1016
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:37,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I actually did scratch off, you know, my Fuck You song, Slugwork, because, well, it kind of fell off once I heard Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock.

1017
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:49,285
[SPEAKER_11]: That one, not only is it one of my favorites to listen to, it's probably one of my favorites to play, except for that, you know, I either get the scratching or I don't, so it's a fun one overall.

1018
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:50,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock.

1019
01:27:50,991 --> 01:27:51,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Good choice.

1020
01:27:51,832 --> 01:27:56,337
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two pick for best 2DX song ever would be Love is Dreaminess.

1021
01:27:56,377 --> 01:27:57,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Love is Crack.

1022
01:27:57,278 --> 01:27:58,719
[SPEAKER_03]: The video is cool.

1023
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the song.

1024
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:00,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the vocals in it.

1025
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:01,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Love is Dreaminess.

1026
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:05,707
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a comment about its difficulty.

1027
01:28:07,324 --> 01:28:08,184
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just too damn hard.

1028
01:28:08,224 --> 01:28:12,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I just played it like five minutes ago, I think.

1029
01:28:13,007 --> 01:28:24,732
[SPEAKER_11]: That song and one other, or probably the last two I have left to pass in Light Seven on Fifth Style is Love is Dreaminess and Regulus, also known as the Cardcaptor Sakura theme.

1030
01:28:25,892 --> 01:28:26,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, next is Matt.

1031
01:28:28,598 --> 01:28:31,540
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, my next one is going to have to be Nemesis.

1032
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Nemesis, all right.

1033
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:34,361
[SPEAKER_03]: From Seventh Style.

1034
01:28:34,961 --> 01:28:35,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Sixth Style.

1035
01:28:35,521 --> 01:28:35,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Sixth Style.

1036
01:28:35,882 --> 01:28:36,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1037
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:36,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops, my bad.

1038
01:28:37,002 --> 01:28:37,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Sixth Style.

1039
01:28:37,983 --> 01:28:38,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you choose Nemesis?

1040
01:28:39,543 --> 01:28:40,644
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an awesome trance song.

1041
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:41,644
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I say?

1042
01:28:42,925 --> 01:28:43,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, works for me.

1043
01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:44,425
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Joe?

1044
01:28:44,966 --> 01:28:45,686
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your number two pick?

1045
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:47,987
[SPEAKER_03]: S.O.S.

1046
01:28:48,007 --> 01:28:48,287
[SPEAKER_03]: S.O.S.

1047
01:28:48,347 --> 01:28:49,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Another Dr. Bombay song.

1048
01:28:49,548 --> 01:28:49,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?

1049
01:28:50,538 --> 01:28:52,439
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, it's just crazy, I guess.

1050
01:28:52,919 --> 01:28:54,099
[SPEAKER_09]: The video is absolutely funny.

1051
01:28:54,139 --> 01:28:55,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Well put, well put, it's fucking crazy.

1052
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:55,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1053
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I'm sorry, I need to ask, the speed version or Dr. Bombay's version?

1054
01:29:00,942 --> 01:29:01,702
[SPEAKER_19]: Speed, I guess.

1055
01:29:01,942 --> 01:29:08,864
[SPEAKER_03]: The speed, okay, so it's not Dr. Bombay, we're talking about the speed version by, I believe it's Dr. It's not Dr. Bombay.

1056
01:29:08,965 --> 01:29:09,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Jekyll, thank you.

1057
01:29:09,925 --> 01:29:10,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Jekyll.

1058
01:29:10,925 --> 01:29:13,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, passing off to Bradley.

1059
01:29:15,549 --> 01:29:16,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go for my second pick.

1060
01:29:16,789 --> 01:29:18,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go for Outer Wall.

1061
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:19,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Outer Wall!

1062
01:29:19,870 --> 01:29:21,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I liked it as soon as I heard it on FifthStyle.

1063
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:23,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I can play it every time I play a game.

1064
01:29:26,031 --> 01:29:26,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Outer Wall.

1065
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:27,832
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do that?

1066
01:29:27,892 --> 01:29:28,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Outer Wall?

1067
01:29:28,432 --> 01:29:31,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was actually my wallpaper for the longest time.

1068
01:29:31,112 --> 01:29:31,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.

1069
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:35,993
[SPEAKER_11]: When they released all the FifthStyle pictures, I had Outer Wall up there for like three months.

1070
01:29:36,233 --> 01:29:38,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we got everybody's number three and number two choices.

1071
01:29:38,994 --> 01:29:39,594
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sorry.

1072
01:29:39,614 --> 01:29:40,314
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to get Brad's.

1073
01:29:40,354 --> 01:29:40,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we have Brad.

1074
01:29:41,995 --> 01:29:42,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget me.

1075
01:29:43,235 --> 01:29:43,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1076
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'd have to say my number two is Gravity by TAC.

1077
01:29:47,902 --> 01:29:48,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to know why?

1078
01:29:49,122 --> 01:29:50,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Because TAC owns you all.

1079
01:29:50,743 --> 01:29:53,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised the amount of Seventh Style songs that are showing up here.

1080
01:29:53,744 --> 01:29:54,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Seventh Style is really good.

1081
01:29:55,164 --> 01:29:56,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a funny joke, Irene.

1082
01:29:56,925 --> 01:30:02,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, see, that's the reason why actually I like it, because it sounds like another incarnation of one of my favorite songs, Electro Tune.

1083
01:30:02,407 --> 01:30:04,008
[SPEAKER_04]: So, way to go, TAC.

1084
01:30:04,108 --> 01:30:04,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that works.

1085
01:30:05,268 --> 01:30:05,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1086
01:30:05,849 --> 01:30:06,769
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just Attack, Attack.

1087
01:30:07,133 --> 01:30:14,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so now everybody's... And we're already getting booed by a lot of people in the chat room for our choices, but you know... Well, you get to vote later.

1088
01:30:14,878 --> 01:30:15,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you get to vote.

1089
01:30:15,638 --> 01:30:17,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you'll get to determine the final list.

1090
01:30:17,839 --> 01:30:19,740
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll also get a buggy of a week next week.

1091
01:30:20,001 --> 01:30:20,281
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1092
01:30:21,942 --> 01:30:22,242
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1093
01:30:22,582 --> 01:30:23,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's number one choices.

1094
01:30:23,963 --> 01:30:27,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So your personal favorite 2DX song ever.

1095
01:30:27,205 --> 01:30:27,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie.

1096
01:30:28,354 --> 01:30:32,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, as if people can't figure out what mine is going to be, it's going to be Reincarnation.

1097
01:30:33,237 --> 01:30:34,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Reincarnation.

1098
01:30:34,037 --> 01:30:38,320
[SPEAKER_11]: And Brad totally called it.

1099
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:39,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Good choice, good choice.

1100
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, of course it's got to be Reincarnation, because I sat and was pissed at that song for weeks.

1101
01:30:43,943 --> 01:30:48,386
[SPEAKER_11]: The first time I passed it on 7Key, my cat walks behind my PS2 and unplugs it.

1102
01:30:49,146 --> 01:30:54,129
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I didn't pass it since until I actually got a third style from my friend while I was off at Anime Expo.

1103
01:30:54,952 --> 01:31:02,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so my number one song, and I just, I absolutely fell in love with this song the first time I heard it, and it really is the song that just hooked me into 2DX.

1104
01:31:02,655 --> 01:31:04,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I always thought it was cool, this is the song that hooked me into it.

1105
01:31:05,076 --> 01:31:08,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Deadline was my number one favorite Mamani song ever.

1106
01:31:09,778 --> 01:31:12,019
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Joe, why don't you give us your number one pick?

1107
01:31:14,102 --> 01:31:16,384
[SPEAKER_19]: I also like this one in Fifth Economics.

1108
01:31:16,464 --> 01:31:18,806
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Absolute by DJ Taka.

1109
01:31:19,306 --> 01:31:19,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1110
01:31:21,688 --> 01:31:22,508
[SPEAKER_19]: He rules.

1111
01:31:22,629 --> 01:31:23,869
[SPEAKER_11]: It's absolutely cool.

1112
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:25,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely a good choice there.

1113
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:28,473
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Matt, your number one pick.

1114
01:31:29,694 --> 01:31:32,096
[SPEAKER_06]: My number one pick has to be In My Eyes from Fifth Economics.

1115
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:33,437
[SPEAKER_03]: In My Eyes, okay.

1116
01:31:35,538 --> 01:31:37,119
[SPEAKER_11]: That one is not an easy one either.

1117
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:38,801
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Bradley.

1118
01:31:42,583 --> 01:31:43,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley's number one choice.

1119
01:31:43,923 --> 01:31:48,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I know Brad's going to say another one that could be my favorite, but I'm going to go with Presto.

1120
01:31:49,325 --> 01:31:50,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Presto, okay.

1121
01:31:50,205 --> 01:31:51,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could pass it, but I haven't gotten there.

1122
01:31:51,866 --> 01:31:54,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Got 72% once, but... All right, Presto.

1123
01:31:55,007 --> 01:31:58,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Presto is number one 2DX favorite song.

1124
01:31:58,908 --> 01:32:01,689
[SPEAKER_11]: And you should see the another if you think the 7T is hard.

1125
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:04,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go, the very last one on the list.

1126
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:05,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad's number one choice.

1127
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:05,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Our number one.

1128
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:07,471
[SPEAKER_04]: The envelope, please.

1129
01:32:08,991 --> 01:32:10,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is actually my number one.

1130
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:12,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I chose Love Will...

1131
01:32:12,655 --> 01:32:14,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Will That's a great song Oh!

1132
01:32:17,408 --> 01:32:19,609
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of Rick on here, RIC.

1133
01:32:20,489 --> 01:32:22,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Lovewill in my eyes.

1134
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel a lot of him on there.

1135
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:26,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a bit of LED, too.

1136
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:28,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, they're all Kiriyama Oka, so.

1137
01:32:28,811 --> 01:32:29,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all right.

1138
01:32:30,911 --> 01:32:34,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, surprisingly, V did not show up on the list.

1139
01:32:34,352 --> 01:32:35,312
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of surprised me.

1140
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought somebody would say it.

1141
01:32:36,633 --> 01:32:38,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say it because I thought somebody else would say it.

1142
01:32:38,033 --> 01:32:39,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we couldn't name the Katimu version.

1143
01:32:39,834 --> 01:32:42,674
[SPEAKER_03]: V did not show up on the list, but A did somehow, so.

1144
01:32:42,774 --> 01:32:44,375
[SPEAKER_11]: We couldn't put the V vocal on there.

1145
01:32:44,655 --> 01:32:45,215
How about we all...

1146
01:32:45,775 --> 01:32:49,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Make a cumulative vote of V We just want to add V on the list?

1147
01:32:49,879 --> 01:33:06,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have a group vote of V V's on there Okay, so now we have 19 songs And we're going to now eliminate 6 of them And this is kind of a hard choice Because these are all really good songs on here So we're going to have to take off 6 of them So starting with Jamie

1148
01:33:07,429 --> 01:33:10,432
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to eliminate one, huh?

1149
01:33:32,348 --> 01:33:34,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I... I don't know.

1150
01:33:34,749 --> 01:33:38,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get rid... You know, I just... I don't like this song in 2DX.

1151
01:33:39,171 --> 01:33:43,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just a song that should have been only in Keyboard Mania.

1152
01:33:43,553 --> 01:33:44,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting rid of Presto.

1153
01:33:44,793 --> 01:33:46,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't... I don't care for it.

1154
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:47,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, Presto.

1155
01:33:48,655 --> 01:33:49,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Keyboard Mania song.

1156
01:33:49,716 --> 01:33:50,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't like it in 2DX.

1157
01:33:50,696 --> 01:33:50,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1158
01:33:51,696 --> 01:33:53,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, next we have Joe's book.

1159
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:55,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe, what do you want to take out the list?

1160
01:33:56,218 --> 01:33:56,959
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me see.

1161
01:33:59,440 --> 01:33:59,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1162
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,981
[SPEAKER_19]: Man, this is a tough one.

1163
01:34:02,141 --> 01:34:02,641
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1164
01:34:02,761 --> 01:34:05,443
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd probably take off, like, God.

1165
01:34:07,444 --> 01:34:11,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Give me a sec.

1166
01:34:13,508 --> 01:34:16,910
[SPEAKER_03]: A. You're taking off A. Oh.

1167
01:34:18,171 --> 01:34:18,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1168
01:34:18,371 --> 01:34:20,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too new.

1169
01:34:20,332 --> 01:34:22,173
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too new to be the best one ever.

1170
01:34:22,594 --> 01:34:23,054
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1171
01:34:23,374 --> 01:34:23,874
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1172
01:34:24,235 --> 01:34:25,375
[SPEAKER_03]: A is gone.

1173
01:34:26,156 --> 01:34:26,476
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1174
01:34:28,681 --> 01:34:29,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt, you're next.

1175
01:34:29,482 --> 01:34:30,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And I swear this isn't out of bitterness.

1176
01:34:31,924 --> 01:34:32,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Cracker.

1177
01:34:32,824 --> 01:34:33,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Cracker!

1178
01:34:36,848 --> 01:34:38,329
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, I have to agree.

1179
01:34:38,349 --> 01:34:40,551
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my other choice.

1180
01:34:40,711 --> 01:34:41,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, next we have Bradley.

1181
01:34:42,992 --> 01:34:44,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley is taking one off.

1182
01:34:45,074 --> 01:34:45,535
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want?

1183
01:34:46,575 --> 01:34:49,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like colors all that much yet.

1184
01:35:01,606 --> 01:35:05,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to call into the corner and cry.

1185
01:35:05,749 --> 01:35:07,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Colors is gone, sorry.

1186
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:08,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, next we have Brad.

1187
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:11,832
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can't hate Bradley because he brought me Twindi.

1188
01:35:13,553 --> 01:35:14,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbye, Calcutta.

1189
01:35:15,054 --> 01:35:17,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, goodbye, Calcutta.

1190
01:35:17,755 --> 01:35:20,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Calcutta is gone.

1191
01:35:20,057 --> 01:35:21,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Driving the taxi out of Calcutta.

1192
01:35:22,722 --> 01:35:26,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that leaves us with our final list, and they're going to vote on this in the chat room right now.

1193
01:35:27,228 --> 01:35:32,354
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way I'm going to count your vote, you have to send me a private message with your vote.

1194
01:35:32,414 --> 01:35:35,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm in the chat room as S-K-I-E, and I have a little bar that says O-L.

1195
01:35:36,178 --> 01:35:39,322
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to send me your vote as a private message, or it doesn't count.

1196
01:35:39,402 --> 01:35:40,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's the final list.

1197
01:35:41,384 --> 01:35:55,175
[SPEAKER_03]: StarMine, I Feel, Infinite Prayer, Love is Dreaminess, Nemesis, Outer Wall, Gravity, Reincarnation, Deadline, Absolute, In My Eyes, Love Will, and V. That's a whole big list.

1198
01:35:55,215 --> 01:35:59,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, your vote only counts if you send it to me as a private message.

1199
01:35:59,999 --> 01:36:02,501
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to give you three minutes to do it.

1200
01:36:02,581 --> 01:36:04,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So send me those right now.

1201
01:36:04,322 --> 01:36:08,706
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime, we're going to hear the full version of Moment, a pretty cool five-key BB&E song.

1202
01:36:08,746 --> 01:36:09,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.

1203
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,182
Thanks for watching!

1204
01:39:51,681 --> 01:39:56,646
[SPEAKER_00]: After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.

1205
01:39:57,475 --> 01:40:01,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Under Sedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.

1206
01:40:01,757 --> 01:40:07,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UnderSedationLive.org.

1207
01:40:17,131 --> 01:40:18,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

1208
01:40:19,112 --> 01:40:21,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Bongo demands it.

1209
01:40:45,356 --> 01:40:46,217
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a few winners.

1210
01:40:46,357 --> 01:40:52,081
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, in third place, for best 2DX song ever is, StarMine!

1211
01:40:52,501 --> 01:40:54,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1212
01:40:54,843 --> 01:40:58,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Second place for best 2DX song ever, Love Will.

1213
01:40:58,786 --> 01:40:59,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1214
01:40:59,747 --> 01:41:00,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, alright.

1215
01:41:01,488 --> 01:41:08,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And, the best 2DX song, as voted by our chatroom, Tremble Please.

1216
01:41:08,773 --> 01:41:09,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Tremble Please.

1217
01:41:10,587 --> 01:41:13,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolute was voted the best 2DX song ever.

1218
01:41:41,147 --> 01:41:41,548
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

1219
01:41:41,668 --> 01:41:44,829
[SPEAKER_11]: The only joust that I do is on the Atari 5200.

1220
01:41:45,129 --> 01:41:45,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1221
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:46,470
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1222
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:49,831
[SPEAKER_03]: So once again, third place was StarMine.

1223
01:41:49,911 --> 01:41:50,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1224
01:41:51,092 --> 01:41:51,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, hold on one second.

1225
01:41:52,012 --> 01:41:52,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Second place.

1226
01:41:52,632 --> 01:41:53,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, what?

1227
01:41:53,873 --> 01:41:57,634
[SPEAKER_05]: When I hear Absolute, I definitely do not think of, like, going and jousting.

1228
01:41:58,435 --> 01:42:00,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell did that come from?

1229
01:42:00,476 --> 01:42:04,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes from the fact that Ultracade happens to be right there, which has joust in it.

1230
01:42:04,918 --> 01:42:05,618
[SPEAKER_03]: So when...

1231
01:42:06,297 --> 01:42:08,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen so much Alanis Morissette videos, haven't you?

1232
01:42:08,518 --> 01:42:11,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Her precious illusions, medieval... I didn't even think of that.

1233
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:11,960
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

1234
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:13,580
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't joust in that video.

1235
01:42:14,001 --> 01:42:15,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

1236
01:42:15,581 --> 01:42:17,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Go make a jousting freestyle for DDR.

1237
01:42:18,063 --> 01:42:18,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I will.

1238
01:42:19,423 --> 01:42:20,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I just might.

1239
01:42:20,364 --> 01:42:21,724
[SPEAKER_11]: But you have to come out on the bird.

1240
01:42:22,445 --> 01:42:23,945
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to have the bird from Joust.

1241
01:42:24,626 --> 01:42:25,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you be my bird, Jamie?

1242
01:42:25,906 --> 01:42:26,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no!

1243
01:42:27,828 --> 01:42:30,850
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'll like go mutate you on or something.

1244
01:42:33,011 --> 01:42:34,312
[SPEAKER_11]: In my secret nest.

1245
01:42:34,332 --> 01:42:35,733
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be the big flying alligator.

1246
01:42:36,473 --> 01:42:39,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have something you wanted to say?

1247
01:42:39,955 --> 01:42:41,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally unrelated to this.

1248
01:42:41,716 --> 01:42:42,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a new topic?

1249
01:42:42,937 --> 01:42:43,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a new topic.

1250
01:42:43,957 --> 01:42:44,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, new topic.

1251
01:42:45,578 --> 01:42:46,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's finish the old topic.

1252
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:47,039
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go to your new topic.

1253
01:42:47,785 --> 01:42:54,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Just before you finish this, I'd like to say that I'm very displeased with all of you because you took off the best songs.

1254
01:42:55,207 --> 01:42:56,107
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the songs I picked.

1255
01:42:56,727 --> 01:42:59,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And my opinion is the only one that matters.

1256
01:42:59,688 --> 01:43:00,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I am God!

1257
01:43:00,448 --> 01:43:01,488
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1258
01:43:01,668 --> 01:43:01,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1259
01:43:02,948 --> 01:43:03,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't.

1260
01:43:04,049 --> 01:43:06,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

1261
01:43:07,269 --> 01:43:08,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, where's my vomit?

1262
01:43:08,229 --> 01:43:08,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the vomit.

1263
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:09,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the vomit.

1264
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:10,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me the vomit.

1265
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:12,550
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to say, show me the vomit.

1266
01:43:13,091 --> 01:43:14,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Show me the vomit!

1267
01:43:14,211 --> 01:43:14,951
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't tell the truth.

1268
01:43:18,419 --> 01:43:19,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm sorry.

1269
01:43:19,561 --> 01:43:21,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, I love you guys.

1270
01:43:21,583 --> 01:43:23,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, apologize to the chatroom and say you're sorry and you love them.

1271
01:43:24,507 --> 01:43:25,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you guys, chatroom.

1272
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:28,813
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people do we have in the chatroom right now?

1273
01:43:29,634 --> 01:43:29,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Thirteen.

1274
01:43:30,626 --> 01:43:32,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I love you, all 13 of you.

1275
01:43:33,088 --> 01:43:33,508
[SPEAKER_04]: All at once.

1276
01:43:33,528 --> 01:43:34,949
[SPEAKER_11]: But Brad and I are the only people that have taste.

1277
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:36,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Jamie!

1278
01:43:38,652 --> 01:43:39,833
[SPEAKER_04]: As if I wasn't harsh enough.

1279
01:43:40,613 --> 01:43:42,154
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you all have good taste.

1280
01:43:42,294 --> 01:43:44,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolute was a good choice from the majority.

1281
01:43:44,716 --> 01:43:45,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think Absolute's pretty.

1282
01:43:46,157 --> 01:43:47,058
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fair, it's fair.

1283
01:43:47,098 --> 01:43:52,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, on a total, in another part of the country, in another dimension, we have other news.

1284
01:43:52,862 --> 01:43:53,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Matt?

1285
01:43:53,543 --> 01:43:54,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's see here.

1286
01:43:54,543 --> 01:43:59,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Since there's not really much sim news going on, since all the websites are down because of bandwidth issues...

1287
01:44:00,047 --> 01:44:08,716
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one thing, the DDR East Coast Invasion DWI contest the results are in, and I'm very disappointed with them.

1288
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:11,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's your own personal damn opinion, by the way.

1289
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:17,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's my personal opinion, you know, being the sort of sim expert here, and I've played all of these.

1290
01:44:17,805 --> 01:44:18,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you that.

1291
01:44:18,426 --> 01:44:20,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of the people in this room, you would be the sim expert.

1292
01:44:20,627 --> 01:44:24,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you've been playing StepMania, DWI, and all that before.

1293
01:44:24,270 --> 01:44:26,291
[SPEAKER_03]: They were cool and looked like Max and all that.

1294
01:44:26,311 --> 01:44:26,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll give you that.

1295
01:44:26,992 --> 01:44:27,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.

1296
01:44:27,532 --> 01:44:30,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, third place was Evolution.

1297
01:44:30,695 --> 01:44:33,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was... It's not above it.

1298
01:44:33,097 --> 01:44:33,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1299
01:44:33,817 --> 01:44:41,480
[SPEAKER_06]: by Mercury Storm, and if my memory serves me right, I believe it was the Evolution Time is Pop mix, if I remember correctly.

1300
01:44:42,721 --> 01:44:48,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Second place was Naturally by Bimani Ruler, which should have taken it, and, you know, I'm very disappointed.

1301
01:44:49,504 --> 01:44:59,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And first place was Healing Vision Half Mix, which is like a remix of Healing Vision with Healing Vision and Angelic mixed together, which is really goddamn retarded by CMCM.

1302
01:44:59,569 --> 01:45:01,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel a little strongly there about that, don't you?

1303
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:02,610
[SPEAKER_06]: It is retarded.

1304
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:07,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'd like to add that if I had entered, I would have probably won, but that's just me.

1305
01:45:08,792 --> 01:45:09,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

1306
01:45:09,612 --> 01:45:12,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were going to be doing an entry with... Can I say what you were going to do?

1307
01:45:12,713 --> 01:45:13,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go ahead.

1308
01:45:13,513 --> 01:45:19,875
[SPEAKER_03]: You were going to go ahead and do an era good, cool, fat mix, the kind of rap version era, which is, by the way, on our playlist for Bomani Music and More.

1309
01:45:20,135 --> 01:45:28,678
[SPEAKER_06]: You were going to do a... I was doing that, and I kind of slacked off and procrastinated on it and didn't quite get it done.

1310
01:45:29,498 --> 01:45:45,568
[SPEAKER_06]: so that's why I don't have it and I was even planning to make my own video and that would have made me win but unfortunately I didn't get a chance to enter it and they're still going to have some more contests so I'll plan on entering those I'll get some done I've got a list of stuff I've got to make but I haven't had time

1311
01:45:46,676 --> 01:45:47,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you just haven't had time.

1312
01:45:47,577 --> 01:45:48,318
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been too lazy.

1313
01:45:48,518 --> 01:45:51,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, over the last couple weeks, I haven't had air conditioning.

1314
01:45:52,041 --> 01:45:56,826
[SPEAKER_06]: And I couldn't sit at home and program, you know, steps in, like, 102 degrees in my house.

1315
01:45:56,926 --> 01:45:59,629
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said, you know, the hell with it, and went and played DDR instead.

1316
01:46:01,150 --> 01:46:04,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom does... A lot of fans of the Half Mix there in the chatroom.

1317
01:46:05,835 --> 01:46:07,056
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem to like it, some of them.

1318
01:46:07,937 --> 01:46:09,999
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, just to each their own, I suppose.

1319
01:46:11,247 --> 01:46:13,008
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good, but it wasn't the best.

1320
01:46:13,148 --> 01:46:14,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1321
01:46:14,830 --> 01:46:16,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Them's fighting words, Matt.

1322
01:46:16,911 --> 01:46:18,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, next time I will show them up.

1323
01:46:18,713 --> 01:46:19,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1324
01:46:19,794 --> 01:46:20,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be there.

1325
01:46:20,695 --> 01:46:21,856
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be there with bells on.

1326
01:46:21,956 --> 01:46:22,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I will be there.

1327
01:46:22,816 --> 01:46:24,998
[SPEAKER_06]: The next contest that they have, I will enter.

1328
01:46:25,078 --> 01:46:28,101
[SPEAKER_06]: You will see Loki plastered to something on there.

1329
01:46:28,281 --> 01:46:29,662
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will definitely enter.

1330
01:46:29,742 --> 01:46:30,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1331
01:46:30,663 --> 01:46:31,144
[SPEAKER_03]: We trust you.

1332
01:46:31,764 --> 01:46:32,544
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking forward to it.

1333
01:46:53,534 --> 01:47:15,474
[SPEAKER_03]: and some people have been sending us some of their own homemade remixes so Jamie and I are going to tear through some of those and we might put a couple of those up in a rotation because we don't want to just draw the line on Bomani songs as you know in our music show we do sometimes put in songs we think ought to be in Bomani we put in some Parappa stuff just for laughs and other things pump it up stuff just because it might as well be Bomani

1334
01:47:15,794 --> 01:47:18,036
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking we could even take live bands.

1335
01:47:18,316 --> 01:47:22,159
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's a local band in the area, we'd support Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.

1336
01:47:22,199 --> 01:47:22,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, sure.

1337
01:47:22,919 --> 01:47:32,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything you think, if you've made a song and you think it deserves to be in DDR, 2DX, any of those games, I say it's good enough for our station, so send it to us and we'll listen to it.

1338
01:47:32,987 --> 01:47:35,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I have already gotten a few remixes, so Jamie and I are going through those.

1339
01:47:36,429 --> 01:47:46,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I was sent a Hysteria remix by JB, and I believe there's also supposed to be a remix of Cowgirl that he's going to send me pretty soon, so I'll have to take a listen to those.

1340
01:47:46,556 --> 01:47:49,297
[SPEAKER_03]: And Kiel also has a pretty good papaya mix there.

1341
01:47:49,578 --> 01:47:50,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, I love that.

1342
01:47:50,658 --> 01:48:00,645
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll go ahead, and if I ask him to, go ahead Kiel, plug your website there in the chat room, and he's got a great papaya mix there, so if you're in the chat room, go check that out, it's pretty funny, pretty good stuff.

1343
01:48:01,485 --> 01:48:03,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I say funny because papaya makes me laugh, just her voice, I don't know.

1344
01:48:04,207 --> 01:48:12,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and I'd like to say that I do have some of Kiel's songs in my sim I've got those off of the Monty Ruler site and they're pretty good, I like them

1345
01:48:14,522 --> 01:48:15,503
[SPEAKER_10]: So lots of support.

1346
01:48:15,563 --> 01:48:16,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep up the good work.

1347
01:48:16,363 --> 01:48:16,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

1348
01:48:17,144 --> 01:48:18,165
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be doing that soon.

1349
01:48:18,185 --> 01:48:20,326
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a future direction Orange Lounge Radio is going to be taking.

1350
01:48:22,428 --> 01:48:25,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, I think we're damn near out of topics to talk about.

1351
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:27,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So how about we just talk about other stuff?

1352
01:48:27,652 --> 01:48:28,653
[SPEAKER_03]: How's your guys' week been going?

1353
01:48:30,334 --> 01:48:32,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Any funny DDR stories from the week?

1354
01:48:32,276 --> 01:48:35,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I think we might have toxic mold in our apartment.

1355
01:48:35,818 --> 01:48:36,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?

1356
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm coughing up like...

1357
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:39,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1358
01:48:55,922 --> 01:48:58,684
[SPEAKER_03]: The way Brad plays DDR is really hilarious.

1359
01:48:58,905 --> 01:49:00,886
[SPEAKER_03]: The way he dances when he does doubles.

1360
01:49:01,306 --> 01:49:07,031
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the center of his body is completely on the other pad as to where his legs are.

1361
01:49:07,472 --> 01:49:08,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's embarrassed.

1362
01:49:08,613 --> 01:49:09,453
[SPEAKER_03]: He's turning the color pink here.

1363
01:49:09,473 --> 01:49:10,034
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's so true.

1364
01:49:10,074 --> 01:49:10,654
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.

1365
01:49:10,994 --> 01:49:15,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I love watching Brad do doubles because it looks like those videos.

1366
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:18,821
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever seen those videos where they split the screen in half and the head's over here and the feet's over here?

1367
01:49:19,221 --> 01:49:20,943
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Brad looks like when he dances.

1368
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:23,490
[SPEAKER_11]: But his style is absolutely awesome.

1369
01:49:23,911 --> 01:49:24,131
It is.

1370
01:49:24,731 --> 01:49:25,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's lanky.

1371
01:49:25,971 --> 01:49:26,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Lanky style.

1372
01:49:27,491 --> 01:49:27,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1373
01:49:28,552 --> 01:49:32,512
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm still think it's pretty cool to be able to pass Catastrophics.

1374
01:49:32,552 --> 01:49:33,633
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't care what someone says.

1375
01:49:33,693 --> 01:49:35,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we can pass them all.

1376
01:49:35,073 --> 01:49:35,773
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't keep count.

1377
01:49:36,193 --> 01:49:36,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep count.

1378
01:49:36,953 --> 01:49:38,074
[SPEAKER_11]: So, damn it.

1379
01:49:38,494 --> 01:49:40,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I passed my 16th Catastrophic.

1380
01:49:40,534 --> 01:49:41,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

1381
01:49:41,274 --> 01:49:43,515
[SPEAKER_11]: I passed Kakumei like the first time I played it.

1382
01:49:43,595 --> 01:49:44,275
[SPEAKER_11]: God, that song was...

1383
01:49:44,595 --> 01:49:46,677
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel was freaking easy.

1384
01:49:46,697 --> 01:49:50,360
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been playing the katas since, like, what, second, third mix?

1385
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:50,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1386
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:52,042
[SPEAKER_03]: When did you start playing the katas?

1387
01:49:52,102 --> 01:49:55,024
[SPEAKER_11]: I first started trying them when third mix had just come out.

1388
01:49:55,044 --> 01:49:56,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I had second mix at home.

1389
01:49:56,385 --> 01:49:58,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, is it just me or are the katas getting easier?

1390
01:49:58,948 --> 01:50:05,452
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they are, like, um, you know, I went and tried, uh, well, my knee gave out on me trying Dead End last night, but, you know, Dead End is still hard to me.

1391
01:50:05,752 --> 01:50:14,297
[SPEAKER_11]: However, you know, I was thinking that Kakame was going to be this end-all difficult song, because Burning Heat was so freaking evil, and Kakame was just so damn easy.

1392
01:50:14,897 --> 01:50:19,159
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel, you know, people were saying, oh, I feel is so hard because the steps don't make sense.

1393
01:50:19,339 --> 01:50:21,741
[SPEAKER_11]: The steps make perfect sense if you just listen to the music.

1394
01:50:21,781 --> 01:50:23,582
[SPEAKER_11]: That song was absolutely, it...

1395
01:50:24,202 --> 01:50:28,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Cacame was slightly easier, but I feel it was easier than some seven-footers.

1396
01:50:28,589 --> 01:50:29,570
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it was that easy.

1397
01:50:29,850 --> 01:50:31,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I definitely agree.

1398
01:50:31,873 --> 01:50:35,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to say, Jamie's opinion is spreading faster in Anna Nicole Smith's legs right now.

1399
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:36,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1400
01:50:38,115 --> 01:50:40,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to definitely agree that the cadets have been way easier.

1401
01:50:40,537 --> 01:50:43,499
[SPEAKER_06]: The only few cadets that I can't pass are off of third mix.

1402
01:50:43,519 --> 01:50:46,581
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we've got Afranova, which I'm talking about doubles here.

1403
01:50:46,962 --> 01:50:48,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, probably singles too.

1404
01:50:48,643 --> 01:50:50,464
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got Afranova, Dead End.

1405
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:52,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dead End I can pass singles, but not doubles.

1406
01:50:52,606 --> 01:50:53,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And Paranoia Rebirth.

1407
01:50:54,367 --> 01:50:55,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't pass that on doubles.

1408
01:50:56,556 --> 01:50:58,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my list somewhere I'll go get it

1409
01:51:16,230 --> 01:51:18,053
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, takes their head out of their ass and fixes it.

1410
01:51:18,093 --> 01:51:28,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I like the really hard, you know, the super hardness of like, you know, Max 300, Max Unlimited, but I want more songs like Afronova doubles Maniac, you know.

1411
01:51:28,647 --> 01:51:32,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that's not extremely hard, but yet still a good workout, you know.

1412
01:51:32,941 --> 01:51:39,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, one of my favorite katas, something I kind of liked about Max, too, was that a lot of the steps started to go with the music a little better.

1413
01:51:39,542 --> 01:51:44,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of made a lot of the katas were actually fun to dance to, as opposed to just being like a bunch of really fast eighth notes.

1414
01:51:44,743 --> 01:51:55,146
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of my favorite katas, and I know this is an overplayed song, but just bear with me, Sugaru, I think is one of the coolest katas because the dance goes with the music so well that it's really fun to dance to.

1415
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:56,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you agree with me, or...?

1416
01:51:56,946 --> 01:51:57,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's very good.

1417
01:51:58,447 --> 01:52:01,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Suaru was one of the ones they really, I think, they did a great job on.

1418
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:06,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of the few Max 2 songs I could say they did not, you know, skimp on for us.

1419
01:52:06,414 --> 01:52:07,615
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to say something before we go on.

1420
01:52:07,975 --> 01:52:11,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody in there, it seems like a couple people don't seem to like Primeval.

1421
01:52:11,858 --> 01:52:14,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, can you guys beat it on Maniac Doubles?

1422
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:18,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Because try doing it down at AX where they have, like, dust all over it.

1423
01:52:18,703 --> 01:52:19,184
[SPEAKER_04]: AI?

1424
01:52:19,204 --> 01:52:22,526
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're sliding all over... AI, that's what I meant.

1425
01:52:22,547 --> 01:52:23,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jamie.

1426
01:52:23,107 --> 01:52:23,147
[SPEAKER_04]: AI.

1427
01:52:24,568 --> 01:52:35,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, everybody in the entire arcade turned around to watch me try to beat that thing, because you can't play, you can't stick to the machine on Afronova Primeval Devils, it's just... So yeah, let's see you try it.

1428
01:52:35,671 --> 01:52:42,092
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, this is my opinion of what a kata should be, is a song that you should not be able to beat your first time.

1429
01:52:42,952 --> 01:52:46,953
[SPEAKER_11]: And at least three on Max 2, I have gone and beaten instantly.

1430
01:52:46,993 --> 01:52:50,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, like, you know, some of the songs were actually the first time I'd actually ever tried them, the ones they upgraded.

1431
01:52:50,994 --> 01:52:51,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Paranoia, K-Set, Clean Mix

1432
01:53:10,786 --> 01:53:11,707
[SPEAKER_11]: They upgraded that to a 9.

1433
01:53:11,807 --> 01:53:13,368
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to remember also, Jimmy, you're getting better.

1434
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:16,090
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you're going to start beating more things on the first time.

1435
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:18,832
[SPEAKER_11]: You still shouldn't be able to beat a 9-footer your first time.

1436
01:53:18,852 --> 01:53:22,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's why they've invented, I guess, so to speak, the 10-footer?

1437
01:53:23,055 --> 01:53:26,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Because now they're going to start adding songs that are 10 feet that you're just not going to be able to beat your first time.

1438
01:53:27,238 --> 01:53:32,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Although there's going to be people out there that just, you know, they're so good at DDR at this point, you know, they're going to beat it the first time.

1439
01:53:32,542 --> 01:53:33,603
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing Konami can do.

1440
01:53:33,803 --> 01:53:38,687
[SPEAKER_11]: I still think the game, you know, I'm glad they put in the Oni courses because that keeps the challenge, but that's like a PA challenge.

1441
01:53:39,107 --> 01:53:43,010
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to have, I mean, there's not really any way to increase the difficulty past where it is.

1442
01:53:43,670 --> 01:53:44,611
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not really a way.

1443
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:47,453
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know there's going to be stuff I can't pass today.

1444
01:53:47,493 --> 01:53:49,194
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one that gives me issues.

1445
01:53:49,615 --> 01:53:51,476
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do a six panel.

1446
01:53:51,556 --> 01:53:55,219
[SPEAKER_03]: If they made six panel more than just solo, I mean, could that be a new challenge?

1447
01:53:55,239 --> 01:53:55,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Six panel still kills me.

1448
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, six panel is a little crazy.

1449
01:53:57,781 --> 01:53:58,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Solo sucks anyway.

1450
01:53:59,602 --> 01:54:00,342
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1451
01:54:20,794 --> 01:54:22,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel follows the back pattern in the music.

1452
01:54:22,835 --> 01:54:23,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it does.

1453
01:54:23,475 --> 01:54:24,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Every edit I make.

1454
01:54:24,856 --> 01:54:29,617
[SPEAKER_06]: It does, but the problem is maybe that doesn't flow quite as well as they could have done it.

1455
01:54:30,518 --> 01:54:33,979
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I didn't really think it did not flow, but then again, that's what I listened to.

1456
01:54:34,019 --> 01:54:35,460
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird to dance to.

1457
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,620
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so kind of like off and weird.

1458
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:38,921
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't think it was weird at all.

1459
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:39,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Backbeats

1460
01:55:02,956 --> 01:55:06,597
[SPEAKER_03]: and Orion78, it's like your feet kind of make another instrument.

1461
01:55:06,637 --> 01:55:12,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are kind of cool katas because they take a while to kind of learn how to play that instrument and then your feet kind of make a new tune.

1462
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:13,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of think those katas are fun.

1463
01:55:13,780 --> 01:55:20,143
[SPEAKER_11]: That was sort of the basis for another, for my DXY edit another, which the challenge is still out there if you want free food, okay?

1464
01:55:20,943 --> 01:55:22,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to just run over your challenge one more time?

1465
01:55:23,684 --> 01:55:35,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, for anybody who can either full combo or 90% perfect attack my DXY edit another, I will take you out to a dinner of up to $15.

1466
01:55:35,781 --> 01:55:36,662
[SPEAKER_11]: How does that sound?

1467
01:55:36,682 --> 01:55:37,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, provided I can afford it.

1468
01:55:39,925 --> 01:55:41,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, keep in mind, I'm unemployed right now.

1469
01:55:41,826 --> 01:55:47,747
[SPEAKER_11]: I may have to owe you a rain check, but I will definitely, the first person who does it, you are getting taken out to a nice dinner.

1470
01:55:50,008 --> 01:55:50,788
[SPEAKER_11]: And what do we hear?

1471
01:55:51,568 --> 01:55:52,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I want my GC.

1472
01:55:52,889 --> 01:55:53,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay.

1473
01:55:54,169 --> 01:55:56,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, this has to go for the second challenge.

1474
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:09,877
[SPEAKER_11]: And for whoever can full combo my Look to the Sky edit with at least a 90% perfect attack, then you get a free GameCube pen, which is still in my purse.

1475
01:56:10,197 --> 01:56:13,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Woohoo!

1476
01:56:13,739 --> 01:56:20,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, if you can send me proof that it's been passed, then send me a photo of the screen, or video or something.

1477
01:56:21,144 --> 01:56:24,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Send me physical proof and I will be sending you a GameCube pen.

1478
01:56:25,527 --> 01:56:26,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, pretty cool.

1479
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:29,390
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have about three minutes left.

1480
01:56:29,410 --> 01:56:30,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody got any other closing thoughts?

1481
01:56:30,811 --> 01:56:31,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for anything.

1482
01:56:31,511 --> 01:56:32,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't have to be Bomani.

1483
01:56:32,751 --> 01:56:34,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you guys want to talk about?

1484
01:56:35,232 --> 01:56:36,572
[SPEAKER_09]: My spoon is too big.

1485
01:56:38,472 --> 01:56:40,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Austin Powers 3 coming out this Friday.

1486
01:56:40,833 --> 01:56:41,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

1487
01:56:42,313 --> 01:56:44,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Same jokes as Austin 1 and 2, I bet you anything.

1488
01:56:45,034 --> 01:56:45,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Same jokes.

1489
01:56:46,274 --> 01:56:47,255
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they can do that.

1490
01:56:47,715 --> 01:56:48,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1491
01:56:49,115 --> 01:56:50,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go see it.

1492
01:56:54,255 --> 01:56:55,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, everyone's pointing them back?

1493
01:56:55,995 --> 01:56:57,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we can't pick it up.

1494
01:56:57,336 --> 01:56:58,556
[SPEAKER_07]: We want comments from Irene.

1495
01:56:59,076 --> 01:56:59,796
I'm sorry.

1496
01:57:00,276 --> 01:57:02,057
[SPEAKER_07]: All I was going to say is that I got a different car.

1497
01:57:02,217 --> 01:57:02,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1498
01:57:02,837 --> 01:57:03,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

1499
01:57:03,697 --> 01:57:04,897
[SPEAKER_03]: You finally got rid of the Golf, right?

1500
01:57:05,037 --> 01:57:05,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1501
01:57:05,477 --> 01:57:06,137
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, way to go.

1502
01:57:06,218 --> 01:57:07,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I need people to do me a favor.

1503
01:57:08,078 --> 01:57:08,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh, what's that?

1504
01:57:09,098 --> 01:57:16,740
[SPEAKER_11]: For people, it doesn't matter what part of the country you're in, I need some people to help me find an 83 Toyota Corolla AE86 hatchback.

1505
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:18,060
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite a request.

1506
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:21,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, so I can have my Trano ended up like the initial D car.

1507
01:57:21,561 --> 01:57:22,681
[SPEAKER_11]: You want fries for that?

1508
01:57:23,301 --> 01:57:26,302
[SPEAKER_11]: If anyone can find one or has one for sale, let me know.

1509
01:57:26,422 --> 01:57:26,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I will buy it.

1510
01:57:30,023 --> 01:57:31,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And Eight-Legged Freaks was okay.

1511
01:57:32,664 --> 01:57:33,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Go see it, though.

1512
01:57:33,484 --> 01:57:35,044
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks so retarded.

1513
01:57:35,084 --> 01:57:36,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a drive-in movie.

1514
01:57:36,365 --> 01:57:37,365
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks retarded.

1515
01:57:37,425 --> 01:57:38,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I went and saw it.

1516
01:57:38,825 --> 01:57:40,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I based my opinion on the trailers.

1517
01:57:40,226 --> 01:57:41,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my best way to describe it.

1518
01:57:42,046 --> 01:57:47,768
[SPEAKER_06]: It was better than Tremors, but not quite as good as Gremlins.

1519
01:57:48,788 --> 01:57:49,968
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just campy.

1520
01:57:50,028 --> 01:57:51,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It was meant to be campy.

1521
01:57:51,049 --> 01:57:52,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It was meant to be stupid.

1522
01:57:52,069 --> 01:57:54,389
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole point is that it has very little plot.

1523
01:57:54,409 --> 01:57:56,590
[SPEAKER_06]: You just watch a bunch of people try to survive spiders.

1524
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:58,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the whole movie.

1525
01:57:58,230 --> 01:57:59,011
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a drive-in movie.

1526
01:57:59,051 --> 01:58:00,391
[SPEAKER_06]: It's meant to be cheesy and corny.

1527
01:58:00,451 --> 01:58:03,612
[SPEAKER_06]: It's paying homage to all those giant monster movies of the 50s.

1528
01:58:07,493 --> 01:58:08,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Arachnophobia was better.

1529
01:58:09,033 --> 01:58:12,374
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, arachnophobia, when I saw that, I went to go make out with somebody.

1530
01:58:14,054 --> 01:58:15,074
[SPEAKER_04]: You dog!

1531
01:58:15,094 --> 01:58:17,175
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have eight legs, did they?

1532
01:58:18,883 --> 01:58:20,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't watching the movie.

1533
01:58:34,202 --> 01:58:41,950
[SPEAKER_03]: After this show is over, why don't you give a listen to our Bomani Music and More program, playing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when this show is not on the air.

1534
01:58:42,170 --> 01:58:48,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to be putting new stuff this week into the rotation, all sorts of new crap, including some of the stuff you heard tonight on the show.

1535
01:58:49,598 --> 01:58:51,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that's about it.

1536
01:58:51,980 --> 01:58:53,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you want to say, Jamie?

1537
01:58:53,602 --> 01:58:57,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go officially brain dead once the show is over, so I have nothing else to say.

1538
01:58:58,126 --> 01:58:58,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

1539
01:58:58,946 --> 01:58:59,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks everybody for listening.

1540
01:58:59,927 --> 01:59:01,788
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next week at 7 o'clock.

1541
01:59:01,828 --> 01:59:07,310
[SPEAKER_03]: If you missed any part of the show, we'll be rebroadcasting tonight's show tomorrow night at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

1542
01:59:07,410 --> 01:59:08,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night everybody.

1543
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:08,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening.

1544
01:59:08,891 --> 01:59:09,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Good night.

1545
01:59:10,797 --> 01:59:12,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember kids, that glue you use in school?

1546
01:59:13,059 --> 01:59:14,580
[SPEAKER_12]: It's made from dead horses!

1547
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:16,201
[SPEAKER_12]: No Wilbur, it's just a sprain!

1548
01:59:39,136 --> 01:59:42,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
