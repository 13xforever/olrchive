00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
All your days are belong to us.

00:22.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio may contain sexual and adult content, and many instances of the F-word, which is not safe for children.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
One, two, one, two, three, four, three, two, one.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
God damn you! Stop calling here! Isn't this 4215 pussy wave?

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
You bitch! Now let me check that this goes 2, 1, 2, fuck you!

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
You have no money.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
You don't.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of purpose.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Kiss my grass, mooch.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Mecha lecha hi, mecha hidey ho.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Me too!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Uh, fucker, yeah?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm working on it.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Loser.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Lame!

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
On the front of my face.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Breathing.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Breathless.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Heaving breath.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut while I go listen to my written experience

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
records.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.360
I am your singing telegram.

01:31.360 --> 01:35.340
Somewhere inside the state of California in the great nation of the United States of America

01:35.340 --> 01:39.520
on the planet earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

01:39.520 --> 01:43.880
You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.280
My name is Rob Roberts but you might know me as Sky.

01:46.280 --> 02:03.800
We are joined in studio once again by many, many guests.

02:03.800 --> 02:04.800
Say hello everybody.

02:04.800 --> 02:05.800
Hello.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.040
I'm going to introduce everybody one by one real fast.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.040
We got Irene.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.040
Brad.

02:11.040 --> 02:12.040
We have Brad.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.040
Brad.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.040
We have Joe.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.040
Yeah.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.040
We have Dave.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.040
We have Matt.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.040
Hello.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.040
That's everybody.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.040
Hi.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.040
Alright.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.040
We have Bradley.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.040
Oh, Bradley's here.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.040
Finally.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.960
Yes, he shows up.

02:25.960 --> 02:26.960
Our moral support.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.040
That's probably the only time you're going to hear him the whole show.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.440
Alright, we'll be talking to all our guests a little bit later, but first we're going

02:32.440 --> 02:35.800
to take a very quick break.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.320
Any other opening thoughts for you, Jimmy?

02:37.320 --> 02:41.040
I think that right now that I still love Bradley because he brought me a Twinbee book.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.040
Ooh!

02:42.040 --> 02:43.560
Twinbee is ownage.

02:43.560 --> 02:44.560
Very neat.

02:44.560 --> 02:45.560
Very neat.

02:45.560 --> 02:52.280
I wish our webcam was working so I could show the elation here on the webcam, but unfortunately

02:52.280 --> 02:55.340
if you do try to go to the webcam on our site it isn't working right now, but we will have

02:55.340 --> 02:59.560
that back next week because we have a big, big show next week and we'll talk more about

02:59.560 --> 03:00.780
that a little bit later.

03:00.780 --> 03:06.320
I have to say happy birthday, Joe Mama, and we're going to play some music right now.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.920
We're going to start it off with something Jamie requested, which I think is very cool.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.220
Do you want to introduce this for us?

03:12.220 --> 03:17.560
This one is, I'm sure everyone is familiar with a particular song from 2DX 3rd Style

03:17.560 --> 03:18.560
by DJ Taka.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.560
This one is remixed by Naoki. Enjoy.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.560
You

07:48.560 --> 08:18.000
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
favorite perverse baumannii band, Erotic.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.500
Do it all night. Do it with me.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.000
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.500
Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.000
In the heat of the night.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.500
I liked it.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.500
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.000
Um...

08:40.000 --> 08:42.500
That was cool.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
Do you even know why you're here?

08:44.500 --> 08:47.000
But that was just bloody pathetic, next!

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Oh, come on baby, come on, do it with me.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.500
Yes, yes, that's it, we have a winner!

08:55.500 --> 09:00.000
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.500
Yes, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

09:04.500 --> 09:09.500
I just repeated myself, but that's okay, because I can do anything I want on this show.

09:09.500 --> 09:14.000
We have the power, we control the vertical, there's no vertical or horizontal on the radio.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.280
We control the audio.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.640
I could drop everybody like that.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.920
But we're not going to do that.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.200
No, I'm not going to do that, because I notice we're actually

09:21.200 --> 09:22.320
starting to get some listeners.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.160
This is pretty cool.

09:23.160 --> 09:23.760
I'm liking this.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.640
And we love you all.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.200
If you want to say hi to us, why don't you

09:27.200 --> 09:28.580
come join us in our chat room?

09:28.580 --> 09:31.360
You're just going to get any IRC program, like MIRC

09:31.360 --> 09:32.440
is a popular one.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.980
And then as your server, you're going

09:33.980 --> 09:36.400
to choose any other side IRC server,

09:36.400 --> 09:39.920
like IRC.eggheads.org is one.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.760
or you can join

09:41.760 --> 09:44.100
othersideirc.net

09:44.100 --> 09:46.540
I believe it's karma.othersideirc.net

09:46.540 --> 09:50.520
and all you're going to do once you get on one of those servers is join Channel Orange Lounge

09:50.520 --> 09:53.860
uh... some people seem to really like some music in that set uh... the last set we

09:53.860 --> 09:57.740
had 0.59 by DJ Taka but that was remixed by Naoki

09:57.740 --> 09:59.240
a piano version there

09:59.240 --> 10:01.020
uh... seemed to be pretty well liked

10:01.020 --> 10:05.060
also after that we had a very popular drum mania song Dynamite

10:05.060 --> 10:07.960
and we're playing some songs for you tonight on the show that we don't

10:07.960 --> 10:11.460
normally play on our Bomani music and more, but we will be soon. That's something we're

10:11.460 --> 10:14.860
going to be working on through the next week. We're going to be increasing our Bomani music

10:14.860 --> 10:19.320
and more music by a lot, because a lot more of you are starting to listen to it, so we

10:19.320 --> 10:21.660
think it's starting to get stale for some of you have the same songs, so we're going

10:21.660 --> 10:23.980
to kind of refresh. We're going to freshen it up a little.

10:23.980 --> 10:29.100
We're going to emphasize on the more. Yes. So there'll be more stuff, and you'll

10:29.100 --> 10:31.740
love it, so tune in any time we're not on the air.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.420
And if you don't love it, we know where you live.

10:33.420 --> 10:34.900
That's right.

10:34.900 --> 10:39.500
If you want to hear any part of this show being rebroadcast, join Monday nights from

10:39.500 --> 10:41.300
seven o'clock until eleven o'clock.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.460
We do rebroadcasts of the live Orange Lounge show.

10:43.460 --> 10:48.660
We'll do from seven to nine is tonight's show, and then nine to eleven is a classic Orange

10:48.660 --> 10:52.580
Lounge, which is a pretty ballsy thing to say, considering we're only on episode five.

10:52.580 --> 10:55.700
Oh, but do you mean every episode's a classic?

10:55.700 --> 10:56.700
Thank you, Jamie.

10:56.700 --> 10:57.700
Well put.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.700
Yay.

10:58.700 --> 10:59.700
All right.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.700
Yay.

11:00.700 --> 11:06.500
Boy, we've just got these big egos tonight, I don't know what it is, I think it's something

11:06.500 --> 11:07.500
in the air.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.020
I don't have a big ego, I'm intensely modest.

11:09.020 --> 11:11.500
It's the California heat.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.100
I have some big news for the show.

11:14.100 --> 11:18.300
Next week on the show, we're going to have our very first special guests.

11:18.300 --> 11:23.140
Guests, not just one special guest, but two special guests here on the show next week,

11:23.140 --> 11:24.140
next Sunday.

11:24.140 --> 11:25.140
Yes.

11:25.140 --> 11:27.220
Would you care to tell them about our lovely guests we're going to have, Jamie?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.260
I don't know, do you think we should make it a surprise?

11:29.260 --> 11:33.860
Well, I've already told half the people in this room, but nobody online knows, I don't think.

11:33.860 --> 11:39.160
Well, we're actually having over Melody and Mel B,

11:39.160 --> 11:45.860
and they're going to be our guests on the show, and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them, because...

11:45.860 --> 11:51.060
Oh God, I have to move everything out and deliver, because this room's cramped as it is when we do the show here, so...

11:51.060 --> 11:54.260
I'd have to say so, and quite toasty, and moist.

11:54.260 --> 11:57.160
Are you feeling a little moist tonight, Chami?

11:57.160 --> 12:03.800
every night on the show. As Irene makes this face.

12:03.800 --> 12:07.080
Orange Lounge Radio makes a moist-as-a-snack cake.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.200
It could be a squishy.

12:10.200 --> 12:13.240
Anyway, yes. Uh, no.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.640
So next week should be a good show because Mel B will be here to talk about

12:16.640 --> 12:18.240
freestyle stuff. I don't know,

12:18.240 --> 12:22.040
I don't know what we'll talk to him about. Maybe about his retirement. Didn't he retire

12:22.040 --> 12:23.680
and then he kinda came back out of retirement?

12:23.680 --> 12:27.120
kind of like Jordan? I don't know. We'd have to ask.

12:27.120 --> 12:30.040
Okay, we'll have to ask him what's up with that. We'll ask him what's up with that.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.680
And then we also have Melody, and I know a lot of you don't know Melody. She goes by

12:33.680 --> 12:35.920
Sharks Girl on the online boards and stuff,

12:35.920 --> 12:39.680
but she's very cool and she's a very good friend of Jamie and I, and she will

12:39.680 --> 12:41.740
dig up tons of dirt on us, guaranteed.

12:41.740 --> 12:45.560
She can't wait. Melody is a fantastic person to know, anyway.

12:45.560 --> 12:49.280
In the chat room they're asking, wasn't Mel B one of the Spice Girls?

12:49.280 --> 12:52.520
No, we're not having that Mel B on the show. God, no.

12:52.520 --> 12:59.240
Unless I get to, you know, use her gigantic teeth for target practice.

12:59.240 --> 13:04.480
This is the freestyle Mel B. I don't know what the last tournament was that he won.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.480
Do you have any idea?

13:06.480 --> 13:07.600
What some of his big routines were?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.480
I know he had a really good one at SCAT.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.880
He had to do an improv routine to Boom Boom Dollar, which was hilarious.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.680
There was also the Silent Hill one.

13:15.680 --> 13:19.320
Does everyone know who Mel B is?

13:19.320 --> 13:21.400
I don't see that.

13:21.400 --> 13:26.400
Most people, if you download videos from DDR Freak or any site that offers videos of freestyle

13:26.400 --> 13:29.960
competitions from the Bay Area, you're going to probably find a MLB video.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.040
I think most people are familiar with his work.

13:32.040 --> 13:38.320
I can actually confirm that from people in Mississippi, in Alabama, where I was going

13:38.320 --> 13:41.640
to play DDR at Boomtown, and they're like, you're from California, oh my God, do you

13:41.640 --> 13:43.640
know MLB?

13:43.640 --> 13:45.120
Yes.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.120
That's what I got.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.640
He's a celebrity, man, come on.

13:48.640 --> 13:54.760
He's a DDR celebrity and he'll be here in house next week.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.560
Do you think that's special to be a DDR celebrity?

13:57.560 --> 13:59.880
Yeah, why not?

13:59.880 --> 14:03.560
I'm a DDR celebrity.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.560
And why are you a DDR celebrity?

14:05.560 --> 14:08.180
Because I am.

14:08.180 --> 14:12.280
There was that, wait, I can't say that name on this radio station can I, but that one

14:12.280 --> 14:18.400
instance with this unnamed person, we don't have the name, that made her a celebrity.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.880
You know, the whole Rice Princess thing.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.880
Oh yeah, whatever, whatever.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.880
We don't need to go into that, sorry.

14:21.880 --> 14:26.480
I don't mean to bring the children to a crashing halt or anything, come on.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.480
Yeah!

14:27.480 --> 14:28.480
But no.

14:28.480 --> 14:33.720
You know, it's kind of funny though, I've noticed that if you have any sort of prominent

14:33.720 --> 14:38.320
name on DDR Freak especially, people are like, oh my god, that's you!

14:38.320 --> 14:40.600
Because that happened to me when I was in Mississippi!

14:40.600 --> 14:47.040
They're like, alright, they got their fifth mix machine at the Boomtown Casino in Biloxi,

14:47.040 --> 14:52.040
Biloxi, Mississippi, and they had never seen a fifth mix before.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.440
This is after Max II had just come out.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.760
I get up on there, I play my usual thing.

14:56.760 --> 15:00.400
I have this tradition where I always start off with Superstar Maniac.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.960
It doesn't really matter what machine it's on.

15:03.960 --> 15:12.000
I just played this big maniac set, and for the first time I full combo'd a dropout trick

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
hidden something.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.760
I just was playing around.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.120
And they're like, oh my God, who are you?

15:17.120 --> 15:20.600
I was like, oh, well, I go by DarkSakura.

15:20.600 --> 15:21.600
That's you?

15:21.600 --> 15:22.600
Oh my God.

15:22.600 --> 15:27.920
So it's like if you have a prominent name on any of the national boards or anything

15:27.920 --> 15:34.260
like that, then people know who you are and they're like, oh my God, that's you.

15:34.260 --> 15:35.260
It's just really weird.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.600
And then for me, they're like, you're Mormon?

15:37.600 --> 15:40.600
What the hell?

15:40.600 --> 15:42.600
Yeah.

15:42.600 --> 15:49.240
Sorry, our chat room is getting insanely popular, so I was opting a few people there to help

15:49.240 --> 15:52.360
police the chat room when we can't take an eye on things here.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.560
It is pretty big today.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.560
Yes.

15:55.560 --> 15:56.560
Hello, everybody.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.120
Hello, everybody in chat room.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.840
Wow, we even have the...

16:01.840 --> 16:03.440
Let's see who we have in the chat room today.

16:03.440 --> 16:09.400
We have SoCalCakes, Jamama, we have lots of people.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
Wow.

16:10.400 --> 16:16.400
It's the people who are actually here! Wow, Bradley, you're in two places at once! How special!

16:16.400 --> 16:20.400
Okay.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.400
It's your evil twin, Skippy.

16:22.400 --> 16:30.400
I just gave ops to people that are long-time listeners to the show here, so I thought they'd be able to police alright, because they know what we do here on the show.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.400
And just what do we do?

16:31.400 --> 16:39.400
Anyway, well, we just talk about anything Bamani and then just other crap that we feel like talking about. We'll talk about whatever we want here on the show, right?

16:39.400 --> 16:43.400
We talk about it. If it exists, we can talk about it.

16:43.400 --> 16:49.400
Anyway, so we have Mel B and Melody coming next week. That's big news for the show.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.400
We're going to be expanding our playlist, Other Big News for the Show.

16:52.400 --> 16:57.400
We might also be starting to do some other random live things.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.400
Uh oh.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.400
So we might be doing some live music programs. That's something Jamie and I have been talking about.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.400
We'll have to see.

17:04.400 --> 17:09.380
okay other big news this week this is something I wanted to do do tonight is

17:09.380 --> 17:12.920
I wanted to do a special show for six style because six style was just

17:12.920 --> 17:16.840
released for home this week the home version and how many of us have it on

17:16.840 --> 17:20.200
order and we all have it on order that's the problem that's why we can't do a

17:20.200 --> 17:26.300
tribute to six style tonight because nobody here has it yet none of us seem

17:26.300 --> 17:29.280
to have it we know some people out there do have it thankfully but we're not

17:29.280 --> 17:32.320
getting ours till mid next week so we couldn't do our six style tribute

17:32.320 --> 17:39.680
However, I've got some tracks from the V-Rare 2 CD, and if you preordered stuff from Konami

17:39.680 --> 17:45.000
style, then you would have gotten this special CD, this V-Rare 2 CD, which had some tracks

17:45.000 --> 17:47.880
on it, and I'm going to play some of those tracks for you.

17:47.880 --> 17:51.880
And rumor is that this also works as an appendisk, although I haven't had that confirmed yet,

17:51.880 --> 17:55.680
so I don't know what's going to happen with that.

17:55.680 --> 18:00.160
Okay, so we're going to do a tribute to 6th Style next week, because we'll have it, and

18:00.160 --> 18:01.160
we can...

18:01.160 --> 18:04.920
even more special because it will be show number six. It will be show number six.

18:04.920 --> 18:11.280
It will be show six style, yeah. Okay.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.800
So... So what else do you want to talk about? You want to take another break real fast?

18:14.800 --> 18:18.120
Well, why don't we go ahead and let them

18:18.120 --> 18:22.280
hear something different for a bit. Okay, let's play those songs. Let's go ahead and

18:22.280 --> 18:24.000
play those songs from the V-Rare 2 CD.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
We're going to come back and we're going to talk about the big news this week about the

18:27.000 --> 18:30.720
concerning the Konami of America coin-op division. We'll talk about that when we get back.

18:30.720 --> 18:37.720
In the meantime, I'm going to play Megoo with Stick Around and L.E.D. with the Mix-Up Dungeon J.

18:37.720 --> 18:43.120
And I'm having a request in the chatroom for Strong Jagger, so maybe we'll work that into. So here you go.

19:07.720 --> 19:37.000
So many days we wasted under the sky, watching the sun go up and the color came.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
So many nights we ended up completely stunned

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
Aren't you really alive that she, she's having the same thing?

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
With you, with you, with you

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
They knew me but this whole time

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
I wanna be with you, with you, with you

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Wherever you are, they see you in my arms

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Why do we speak out loud like this?

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
I'd like to share a little more by talking

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
How can we keep repeating the same old lines?

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Who am I with any secrets for you?

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
Why do we speak out loud like this?

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
How do we know we'll be together?

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
I'd rather do it this way, man

20:33.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

20:44.000 --> 20:59.000
So many hugs we showed every one a time I need to care what they ever thought of us

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
So many kisses starting up a hundred sparks

21:06.000 --> 21:09.500
Shedding a bite that's like the rain

21:09.500 --> 21:12.000
And people who don't share the same

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
To you, to you, to you

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
The world is called a disappear

21:18.500 --> 21:22.000
I sit close to you, to you, to you

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I hear your heartbeat

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
In harmony with mine

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Why do we speak a lot like this?

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
I'd like to share the little more by talking

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
How can we keep repeating the same old lies?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
You and I, let everything disappear

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
Why do we speak a lot like this?

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
How do we know we'll be together?

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
I'll always do it the same as you

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
Land of the wandering, land of the true

22:03.000 --> 22:10.000
Land of the woman, make her be the one

22:10.000 --> 22:19.000
So many moments, I don't want to keep my voice inside

28:10.000 --> 28:32.240
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

28:32.240 --> 28:39.240
Extreme Babati Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

29:02.240 --> 29:07.160
version and an LED with a strong Jäger, as in Jägermeister, and it was exciting!

29:07.160 --> 29:08.160
The full version.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.240
I'm tingly just from hearing that song.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.720
Oh, you've been moist and tingly tonight, Jamie.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.720
Yes, I feel like I have a disease.

29:14.720 --> 29:18.520
I have the rakimimonia and the boogie-woogie flu.

29:18.520 --> 29:21.760
Irene's got this look on her face, I'm like, dear God.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.280
This show has resorted to potty jokes.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.400
Okay, anyway.

29:26.400 --> 29:30.640
We'd like to give our condolences to a long-time supporter of Orange Lounge Radio.

29:30.640 --> 29:36.600
He's been around since the first couple episodes, that's SCK, SoCalKicks, had a website and

29:36.600 --> 29:39.940
unfortunately due to some server issues, it is no more.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.800
He has no website right now.

29:41.800 --> 29:47.380
He can't host it anyway, so if you have any posting space that you'd like to host a cool

29:47.380 --> 29:52.060
little DER website all about the SoCal scene and then some, he has a lot of information

29:52.060 --> 29:56.760
about U.S. Bahmani releases, domestic Bahmani releases, he's always up to news on that kind

29:56.760 --> 30:02.880
of stuff, and he has a good little edit database going, so go ahead and send us an email at

30:02.880 --> 30:06.720
orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com and we'll pass it along to him.

30:06.720 --> 30:08.920
I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

30:08.920 --> 30:09.920
And you're welcome.

30:09.920 --> 30:12.360
Anyway, because he's saying thank you in the chat room, so you're welcome.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.560
Yes, you're very welcome.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.120
You've been a long time supporter of the show.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.320
You hosted my edit.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.320
That's really cool.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.320
Yes.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.880
Also, we've got some news going on.

30:20.880 --> 30:25.320
yesterday was the big guy castro valley golf land tournament and uh...

30:25.320 --> 30:28.920
well that kind of goes into uh... an f u of the week actually for me anyway but

30:28.920 --> 30:31.120
we want to give but jamie's f u of the week

30:31.120 --> 30:36.200
first so let's let jamie give her f u of the week

30:36.200 --> 30:39.340
okay my f u of the week is directed towards

30:39.340 --> 30:40.980
drum roll please

30:40.980 --> 30:42.640
at&t

30:42.640 --> 30:43.860
at&t

30:43.860 --> 30:45.280
at&t

30:45.280 --> 30:49.060
the only company that i've seen that has the death star as their logo

30:49.060 --> 30:51.900
Yes, they are truly the evil empire.

30:51.900 --> 30:53.740
I have been

30:53.740 --> 30:56.060
at home unemployed now

30:56.060 --> 30:59.620
happily, well not really, you know, having one. Anyway, that's off the subject.

30:59.620 --> 31:03.740
Anyway, I've been sitting at home for the past, you know, week and a half trying to go online

31:03.740 --> 31:06.060
and play my addiction Ragnarok online

31:06.060 --> 31:08.500
only to have my cable crap out.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.260
I will be sitting online

31:10.260 --> 31:14.660
happily gaining levels, disconnected from the server. What?

31:14.660 --> 31:20.340
I go downstairs, look at my little connector thing for my modem, and it's blinking lights

31:20.340 --> 31:23.160
all over the place, and then it just stops.

31:23.160 --> 31:27.580
So I have to hop on dial-up, then it comes back, then I have to get back on, and it does

31:27.580 --> 31:29.900
this at least five times a day.

31:29.900 --> 31:33.540
AT&T is truly a company run by the Antichrist.

31:33.540 --> 31:36.820
Anyway, so I'm looking for a new service.

31:36.820 --> 31:39.900
If anybody has good suggestions, I'm open to them.

31:39.900 --> 31:42.340
AT&T just needs to die.

31:42.340 --> 31:48.140
I also hate AT&T, because we have their cable, and they charge us way too much for it, and

31:48.140 --> 31:52.140
we don't get BBC America, and we don't get M2.

31:52.140 --> 31:55.540
So what am I supposed to do for watching music videos, because MTV sure as hell doesn't play

31:55.540 --> 31:56.540
them.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.540
That's for damn sure.

31:58.540 --> 32:03.540
You know, MTV hasn't played videos since, like, the 90s began.

32:03.540 --> 32:11.340
Well, no, they played videos up through them, because we had 120 Minutes, we had, um...

32:11.340 --> 32:18.180
yeah but like MTV has sorority life the new reality show took place in Davis by

32:18.180 --> 32:25.380
the way more the reason not to watch I saw when they put the rocks up on the

32:25.380 --> 32:30.540
side of the hill oh is that is that what they all do by the big bridge that was a

32:30.540 --> 32:35.540
pledge thingy now the hell with MTV I have an FU of the week as well I just

32:35.540 --> 32:39.380
thought of this before the show started I decided I needed a theme song for my

32:39.380 --> 32:41.380
a few of the week as well, so I just went cool.

32:41.380 --> 32:42.380
Well, mine's cooler.

32:42.380 --> 32:43.380
Yours is cooler, but...

32:43.380 --> 32:45.380
Mine's fucked up.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.380
Anyway, my issue...

32:48.380 --> 32:51.380
Oh, it's being suggested that your F.U. of the Week should have been this.

32:51.380 --> 32:52.380
Duploeb.

32:52.380 --> 32:53.380
Yes.

32:53.380 --> 32:54.380
Freakin' Duploeb.

32:54.380 --> 32:55.380
Okay.

32:55.380 --> 32:59.380
I can't fuck you of the week part two.

32:59.380 --> 33:01.380
Fuckin' Duploeb.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.380
Fuck them right in their noses.

33:03.380 --> 33:06.380
Because their ass just doesn't get it.

33:06.380 --> 33:11.380
I have been working for nearly a month on DarkSakura.com

33:11.380 --> 33:16.380
Getting my pages up. It looks really pretty. Too bad nobody else can see it.

33:16.380 --> 33:21.380
Because I keep getting these emails that say, we're relocating the server. Oh, we relocated again.

33:21.380 --> 33:24.380
Oh, the server's now shoved somewhere up our ass. You know, we're puking it now.

33:24.380 --> 33:29.380
So, at this point, I'm not ready to say, fuck DuploWeb again.

33:29.380 --> 33:34.380
And for the people in the chatroom who are wondering, go to www.duploweb.com and you'll see how crappy they are.

33:34.380 --> 33:41.380
So, I'm looking for a new service for that as well. If you have suggestions, please let me know, as long as you pay for it.

33:41.380 --> 33:44.380
Okay! Can I finish? Can I finish? Can I finish?

33:44.380 --> 33:49.380
No! No, my turn! I have part three, and my other fucking week goes toward my big toe.

33:49.380 --> 33:50.380
No.

33:52.380 --> 33:55.380
Alright. I'm gonna try to do my F.U. of the week now.

33:55.380 --> 33:56.380
No.

33:56.380 --> 33:57.380
If I may.

33:57.380 --> 33:58.380
Oh, one more thing, one more thing.

33:58.380 --> 33:59.380
Jesus Christ.

33:59.380 --> 34:15.460
My F.U. of the week is Jamie, because she, no. My F.U. of the week is my sleep schedule,

34:15.460 --> 34:22.700
because not only did I sleep until 3 o'clock today, I slept for 13 hours last night. I

34:22.700 --> 34:30.800
I slept yesterday just long enough to miss CVGL completely.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.480
I was going to go for a couple hours and it was great because I had my little remote kit

34:34.480 --> 34:38.400
I was going to take and I was going to do interviews for this show and I was going to

34:38.400 --> 34:43.160
do all this stuff and hopefully get to meet some people and get interviews with the winners

34:43.160 --> 34:44.160
and all that stuff.

34:44.160 --> 34:52.200
But I slept too damn much so I did not get to go to CVGL.

34:52.200 --> 34:57.480
My problem is my clock, and for that I give an F you to my sleep clock.

34:57.480 --> 34:59.960
We're also taking suggestions and collections to buy a new alarm clock.

34:59.960 --> 35:03.160
I'm being told to get an alarm clock?

35:03.160 --> 35:04.160
Doesn't work.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.160
It didn't work this weekend.

35:05.160 --> 35:06.160
I didn't have my alarm.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.200
We can buy one and duct tape it to your head.

35:08.200 --> 35:15.600
I wasn't sleeping at my own house, and that's all that needs to be said.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.040
We have a suggestion from...

35:17.040 --> 35:18.040
Irene, yes.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.040
What is this?

35:19.040 --> 35:22.960
I said take laxatives before you go to bed so you'll have to take a shit really bad in

35:22.960 --> 35:25.800
the morning and you'll be forced to wake up.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.960
I need to say something to Jabberwocky in the chat room.

35:27.960 --> 35:34.560
I can't understand anything you're saying at all, I'm sorry.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.560
Moving right along.

35:35.560 --> 35:38.480
Oh yes, and a poopy pancake to you.

35:38.480 --> 35:44.880
That relates, by the way, to the other show, Undersonationlive.org.

35:44.880 --> 35:45.880
Listen to it.

35:45.880 --> 35:46.880
It broadcasts on Saturday night.

35:46.880 --> 35:47.880
If you like this, you'll love that.

35:47.880 --> 35:52.880
Let's talk about the winners at CVGL, because I wanted to talk about that.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.880
Do you still have that up on the screen over there, Matt?

35:54.880 --> 35:55.880
Who won?

35:55.880 --> 35:59.880
I know some people that listened to this show ended up placing, so that's pretty cool.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.880
We have passed the microphone now to Matt.

36:02.880 --> 36:07.880
Okay, for Perfect Attack, first place went to Virtu, Corey.

36:07.880 --> 36:08.880
Congratulations.

36:08.880 --> 36:09.880
Go Corey.

36:09.880 --> 36:16.880
Second place went to Tigger Eugene, or I hope I pronounced that right.

36:16.880 --> 36:20.320
And then third place went to Emphasis.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.320
Well you go!

36:21.320 --> 36:27.560
And for Freestyle, let me see here real quick.

36:27.560 --> 36:35.340
Okay third place went to Hypnotics with his secret rendezvous routine.

36:35.340 --> 36:36.340
Second place went to...

36:36.340 --> 36:37.340
That's a local boy!

36:37.340 --> 36:38.400
Go Hypnotics!

36:38.400 --> 36:44.680
Second place went to Nobody Gen for their high is off you routine.

36:44.680 --> 36:50.680
And also first place went to Sweet Banana A.J. for the on jazz routine.

36:50.680 --> 36:53.820
My sweet, my sweet banana.

36:53.820 --> 36:56.740
Every time I hear that song I think of the abra abracadabra.

36:56.740 --> 37:00.260
Have you noticed how many para para songs are rip offs of old 80 tunes that steal the

37:00.260 --> 37:01.580
tunes?

37:01.580 --> 37:04.300
There's that one and then there's, Irene you know some of these.

37:04.300 --> 37:07.020
The para songs that sound like other normal songs.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.500
The Ghostbusters song.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.500
Which one's that?

37:09.500 --> 37:10.500
That would be.

37:10.500 --> 37:11.500
Oh deluxe.

37:11.500 --> 37:13.900
Oh, deluxe, duh duh duh duh duh duh.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.900
No, that's, um, Aishimasu.

37:15.900 --> 37:16.900
Aishimasu.

37:16.900 --> 37:17.900
Nope.

37:17.900 --> 37:18.900
Aishimasu.

37:18.900 --> 37:19.900
Yes.

37:19.900 --> 37:20.900
Uh, what else?

37:20.900 --> 37:23.140
There was another one that rips off, I was thinking Highway to Hell, but that's High

37:23.140 --> 37:26.260
Energy from DDR Solo, which just sounds just like Highway to Hell.

37:26.260 --> 37:28.260
Well, also, they'll pick, like, like, song titles.

37:28.260 --> 37:29.260
Highway to Hell!

37:29.260 --> 37:30.260
What?

37:30.260 --> 37:34.020
They'll pick song titles, too, and make up whole, you know, Eurobeat songs, like, you

37:34.020 --> 37:38.220
know, Like a Virgin and, um, what was the other one that had Dulce Dance So Close to

37:38.220 --> 37:39.220
Me?

37:39.220 --> 37:40.220
I don't know.

37:40.220 --> 37:41.220
Dulce Dance So Close?

37:41.220 --> 37:50.140
The whole thing is that just about every song that was in Para Para was on one of the million

37:50.140 --> 37:51.140
Initial D soundtracks.

37:51.140 --> 37:53.140
And they all say fire.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.140
I'm sorry?

37:54.140 --> 37:55.140
I'm sorry, Ari?

37:55.140 --> 37:56.140
They all say fire.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.140
Yes, they all say fire.

37:57.140 --> 37:58.140
Yes.

37:58.140 --> 38:02.320
Gosh, PPP is a really old thing to be talking about, but actually locally it's still kind

38:02.320 --> 38:03.320
of new to us.

38:03.320 --> 38:07.180
We haven't had a machine until about two months ago, so anyway.

38:07.180 --> 38:09.860
But Para Para, I don't know, it's kind of getting old for me, but whatever.

38:09.860 --> 38:14.540
yes ron i think i have an answer to your not waking up uh... oh yes i remember

38:14.540 --> 38:15.380
on that

38:15.380 --> 38:19.200
tech tv on the uh... showed screensavers they reviewed an alarm clock called the

38:19.200 --> 38:21.000
screaming me me one ten

38:21.000 --> 38:24.080
basically it's an a hundred and ten decibel alarm clock which is the

38:24.080 --> 38:27.020
equivalent to a jet although i own another no

38:27.020 --> 38:30.360
my old remain with my very first roommate will i moved out of the dorms

38:30.360 --> 38:33.620
in college moved into an apartment and my roommate how one of those clocks

38:33.620 --> 38:34.600
it was just one of us

38:34.600 --> 38:37.440
it was a clock it was an alarm clock for deaf people

38:37.440 --> 38:38.420
is what it was

38:38.420 --> 38:42.700
it was so loud every time I went off keep in mind my old apartment I lived

38:42.700 --> 38:45.380
right by train tracks so every time a train went by

38:45.380 --> 38:48.740
I could sleep right through that but I his alarm clock always woke me up it

38:48.740 --> 38:50.780
sounded like a plane was landing in his room it was just like

38:50.780 --> 38:54.180
it was so incredibly loud

38:54.180 --> 38:58.100
you would not even believe. What was funny is also

38:58.100 --> 39:02.380
they were reviewing the fact that there's Screaming Me 220

39:02.380 --> 39:06.420
which I just can't imagine that.

39:06.420 --> 39:13.420
who actually want to be deaf.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.380
I could only live with that guy for six months, him and his clock.

39:17.380 --> 39:21.260
Or maybe it's like for, you know, rock stars who are deaf anyway.

39:21.260 --> 39:23.660
Don't you think?

39:23.660 --> 39:27.140
Yeah, I just got back from the show last night. Ahh! My ear!

39:27.140 --> 39:29.020
You know, like that.

39:29.020 --> 39:32.180
I apologize to any speakers that were blown out by my impersonation of my

39:32.180 --> 39:37.540
old roommate's alarm clock and he held the microphone pretty far away

39:37.540 --> 39:40.900
that'll get we're having a suggestion in the chat room from pyro man saying to

39:40.900 --> 39:45.060
wake up to let them move every morning that was fun that'll get you right out

39:45.060 --> 39:47.700
of bed let's just go this way that won't make me get out of bed that'll make me

39:47.700 --> 39:53.620
want to end my life the screen maybe 220 can be heard up uh up to a mile away

39:53.620 --> 39:56.580
oh my god

39:56.580 --> 40:01.580
No. No.

40:01.580 --> 40:05.580
Also, in case you missed last week's show, by the way, we did determine the worst Maimani

40:05.580 --> 40:10.580
song in history next to Let Them Move, and it was Bye Bye Baby Balloon. So Bye Bye Baby

40:10.580 --> 40:14.380
Balloon will never be played on this. And this wasn't just our decision, we helped,

40:14.380 --> 40:18.180
but it was the chat room that ultimately decided that Bye Bye Baby Balloon was the worst Maimani

40:18.180 --> 40:19.180
song ever.

40:19.180 --> 40:20.180
It's a good dimension in one of our provos.

40:20.180 --> 40:22.580
It does. It does get a mention, but we, you know.

40:22.580 --> 40:23.580
But we won't play the song.

40:23.580 --> 40:24.580
Yeah, we won't play it.

40:24.580 --> 40:32.580
If anyone has heard the promo, it's declared as crap, so that's why.

40:32.580 --> 40:34.580
And crap stinks, so flush it.

40:34.580 --> 40:43.580
Anyway, let's talk about another big news item. This has been the biggest news in the DDR scene in forever.

40:43.580 --> 40:48.580
I'm going to read this. This was in Replay Magazine, which is an industry magazine for arcade coin-ops.

40:48.580 --> 40:52.380
and they said, Konami's US coin-op office is to close.

40:52.380 --> 40:56.180
The Konami of America's coin-op office in Buffalo Grove, Illinois will close its

40:56.180 --> 40:59.460
doors at the end of September with future game sales being handled

40:59.460 --> 41:03.760
by an as yet to be named third-party exclusive distributor in the US.

41:03.760 --> 41:07.460
Factory execs in the US have yet to issue a public statement confirming the

41:07.460 --> 41:10.140
move, so it is still kinda hearsay at this point, but

41:10.140 --> 41:13.540
it's pretty much been widely determined. There was speculation before this news item hit

41:13.540 --> 41:16.940
and now it's kinda just being more and more confirmed.

41:16.940 --> 41:21.420
Anyway, the Japanese manufacturer, which has a consumer game office in California

41:21.420 --> 41:22.940
and gaming operations in Nevada,

41:22.940 --> 41:27.140
will maintain a small service department to handle support for its existing units

41:27.140 --> 41:27.860
in the field,

41:27.860 --> 41:31.160
like all those silent scope machines. According to what

41:31.160 --> 41:35.080
Replay Magazine has so far, Konami is also expected to exhibit

41:35.080 --> 41:38.540
at this fall's AMOA Expo in Las Vegas, possibly

41:38.540 --> 41:41.980
with their new sales and marketing partner. And that's been a quite an

41:41.980 --> 41:43.500
interesting story lately.

41:43.500 --> 41:49.020
People are saying, oh, that's it, DDR is dead in the US.

41:49.020 --> 41:50.220
I wouldn't go that far.

41:50.220 --> 41:52.800
I think that's kind of screaming that the sky is falling.

41:52.800 --> 41:58.400
It never once said that they were going to, you know, not manufacture the games 100%.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.580
They have another distributor.

42:00.580 --> 42:03.900
And they still don't appear to give a shit about imports, so hey, I think we're going

42:03.900 --> 42:04.900
to be okay.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.980
No, so that's another thing, Austin, to put an end to that rumor that was brought to our

42:07.980 --> 42:14.540
attention last week too regarding them hunting down drummania machines and taking them out.

42:14.540 --> 42:19.840
Go after all two copies of pop music that are in the country.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.540
So we still don't know what's going to happen with DDR.

42:21.540 --> 42:22.540
This could be a good thing.

42:22.540 --> 42:26.800
I mean, maybe this third party distributor is going to take something like Max2, just

42:26.800 --> 42:31.000
make it, you know, maybe have some, I don't know how it all works really in the industry.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.660
Maybe Konami makes it better or they help make it better and then put it out.

42:35.660 --> 42:40.020
Maybe this third-party distributor is going to listen to us really good and get some good

42:40.020 --> 42:41.020
stuff.

42:41.020 --> 42:46.260
Working at a video distributor company, a lot of the companies out there that manufacture

42:46.260 --> 42:50.180
machines and distribute them, they want to cut costs and the only way they can do that

42:50.180 --> 42:55.940
is not distribute them and go third-party and that way it saves on them having shipping

42:55.940 --> 42:57.860
facilities and all that kind of stuff.

42:57.860 --> 42:59.180
So they're going to cut costs that way.

42:59.180 --> 43:01.580
It doesn't mean they're not going to make any gains, they're just going through someone

43:01.580 --> 43:06.200
else that distribute them, which is really common in all the industries out there.

43:06.200 --> 43:09.780
Do you think maybe it's possible that this third-party distributor is going to come out

43:09.780 --> 43:13.820
and go, okay, we've got a problem with these imports, because we're trying to put out a

43:13.820 --> 43:16.700
new USA mix here, and we've got a problem with your imports?

43:16.700 --> 43:17.700
You think that might happen?

43:17.700 --> 43:18.700
No.

43:18.700 --> 43:20.140
They have nothing to say with it.

43:20.140 --> 43:27.140
All the distributors do is take someone's game and basically sells that product to whoever.

43:27.140 --> 43:28.140
That's all they do.

43:28.140 --> 43:30.600
They don't do anything as far as recalling games.

43:30.600 --> 43:34.700
all Konami so they're nothing but highly trained monkeys basically yes I'm

43:34.700 --> 43:41.140
getting nodded yes and you DDR max USA not affected from what we hear so far

43:41.140 --> 43:44.400
still looking to be a damn good release it's going to be the biggest home

43:44.400 --> 43:51.020
release of DDR ever 65 something songs who knows but maybe possibly the only

43:51.020 --> 43:54.300
thing that could be affected is any kind of arcade link who knows what happens

43:54.300 --> 43:58.940
maybe they don't know what's gonna happen yeah they're still selling the

43:58.940 --> 44:05.160
their own home games online. I mean, Konami makes, you know, a good number of

44:05.160 --> 44:09.480
games. And even so, you know, they've still got, you know, like they're

44:09.480 --> 44:12.480
keeping that small servicing up and, you know, they still have tons of classic

44:12.480 --> 44:15.480
games out that are going to be servicing, like the Turtles in Time that Rosebud

44:15.480 --> 44:26.560
Goffin. That game is so cool. Yes, we are geeks. But anyway, we digress. You know,

44:26.560 --> 44:32.980
They've got so many games that have been released as far as arcade games that are going to need

44:32.980 --> 44:36.580
that servicing in the future, so it's a good thing that they keep that office open.

44:36.580 --> 44:40.780
Their distributor is not really going to be able to do much about that anyway.

44:40.780 --> 44:44.500
Jabberwocky has a very good point in our chat room, saying it's not a bad move.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.780
Look at the movie industry.

44:45.780 --> 44:49.780
They work the exact same way, and they're pretty darn good at distributing the movies

44:49.780 --> 44:51.180
to the theaters.

44:51.180 --> 44:54.740
So maybe this is just going to get DDR out there even more.

44:54.740 --> 44:55.740
I can even say that.

44:55.740 --> 45:01.300
You did kind of just say the same damn thing, but you worked for, thinking about it as video

45:01.300 --> 45:04.300
and thinking about the actual movies, two kind of different things, I think.

45:04.300 --> 45:05.300
It's a different process.

45:05.300 --> 45:07.620
I worked in the mortgage industry for two years.

45:07.620 --> 45:14.260
A mortgage company or a bank is often going to buy out a third-party servicer to handle

45:14.260 --> 45:20.740
loans collections because it's too much money that's going to cost them to train, to have

45:20.740 --> 45:24.760
these people hired trained to take care of the employee base.

45:24.760 --> 45:29.560
If you look at it from that standpoint as well, Konami is a corporation.

45:29.560 --> 45:34.260
That's going to save them a lot of money over time and less money that they spend on actually

45:34.260 --> 45:35.900
having to worry about the distribution.

45:35.900 --> 45:39.000
That could be more money put into other things.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.360
It sounds like all in all it's not the end of the world.

45:41.360 --> 45:44.640
It could only maybe some things are going to change, but it sounds like for the most

45:44.640 --> 45:47.420
part it can't be a totally bad thing.

45:47.420 --> 45:48.420
It might just be better.

45:48.420 --> 45:49.540
It might get DDR some more exposure.

45:49.540 --> 45:52.680
They're going to hopefully do some things that Konami wasn't able to do.

45:52.680 --> 45:56.640
Max USA still sounds like it's going to be pretty kick-ass.

45:56.640 --> 45:58.320
That is going to be a winner.

45:58.320 --> 46:02.060
20 new songs that haven't been in any mix yet.

46:02.060 --> 46:06.400
We haven't heard anything else other than Overblast being in it and the initial song

46:06.400 --> 46:11.120
list that was posted on all the big Bimani websites.

46:11.120 --> 46:15.340
We're going to, as soon as we hear anything else about new Max stuff, we will not only

46:15.340 --> 46:18.700
announce that on the show, we'll get those songs into rotation soon too so you can hear

46:18.700 --> 46:21.060
what they sound like.

46:21.060 --> 46:23.500
I think we're going to go ahead and take another quick break, and then we're going to come

46:23.500 --> 46:28.620
back and talk about the new Euro mix, which is quite possibly what the new USA mix could

46:28.620 --> 46:29.940
be, could have been, who knows.

46:29.940 --> 46:33.780
We're going to talk about that, what the British folks and all of Europe is going to be seeing

46:33.780 --> 46:34.780
pretty soon.

46:34.780 --> 46:35.780
In the meantime, I'm going to take a quick break.

46:35.780 --> 46:40.340
I'm going to start it off with something that the chat room has just been yelling to hear

46:40.340 --> 46:44.340
played, and so we're going to hear Miracle Moon, and we're going to hear the version

46:44.340 --> 46:49.300
of this remix by LED, just because I've got two versions, and that's the one I somewhat

46:49.300 --> 46:52.380
prefer although some people are saying, play the original, play LED, play the original.

46:52.380 --> 46:55.440
Well, play LED, but if you want to play the original, the original is also in rotation

46:55.440 --> 46:58.780
in our Bomani Music & More show, which plays all the time when we're not doing this live

46:58.780 --> 47:05.120
bit. And after that, we're going to hear another LED track, Mix Up Denjin J, which is another,

47:05.120 --> 47:09.560
the full version we're going to hear, which is another one of these six-style hidden tracks.

47:09.560 --> 47:13.080
So it's going to be somewhat of a long break, but we'll come back right about eight o'clock.

47:13.080 --> 47:20.080
and I'll try to get to as many requests as I can before the night's up.

48:13.080 --> 48:17.560
Oh, you're the answer, let's go

48:17.560 --> 48:20.680
We should go back to our room, should we go?

48:20.680 --> 48:24.280
We should go, should we go?

48:24.280 --> 48:26.520
We could go back to our room, we should go

48:26.520 --> 48:29.400
I'm the king that came up

48:29.400 --> 48:33.240
He said that I can't do

48:33.240 --> 48:37.080
Do you believe in love?

48:37.080 --> 48:39.560
Yes, I'm the king that came up

48:39.560 --> 48:42.520
I'm the king that came up

48:42.520 --> 48:45.720
Yay, now it's time to die, die, die

48:45.720 --> 48:47.520
No, no, no, no, no, no

48:47.520 --> 48:49.520
It's time to die, die, die

48:49.520 --> 48:52.520
Don't you think you can get it, go, go

48:52.520 --> 48:54.020
Yay, yay, yay, yay

48:54.020 --> 48:56.520
Don't you think you're leaving now?

48:56.520 --> 49:00.520
There's time to stay with you

52:56.520 --> 52:58.520
Oh

53:56.520 --> 54:01.520
music

54:01.520 --> 54:06.540
music

54:06.540 --> 54:11.540
music

54:11.540 --> 54:16.540
music

54:16.540 --> 54:21.540
music

55:51.540 --> 55:53.540
Oh

57:51.540 --> 58:04.540
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

58:04.540 --> 58:06.820
the Orange Dance Way of Learning Music and More show?

58:06.820 --> 58:14.380
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

58:14.380 --> 58:16.620
It's unearthly.

58:16.620 --> 58:20.700
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

58:20.700 --> 58:25.660
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, it's like one big giant spaceship.

58:25.660 --> 58:29.180
It's about the top of the hour, 8 o'clock, we've got one more hour of the live show for

58:29.180 --> 58:30.180
you tonight.

58:30.180 --> 58:34.940
And we want to start off this hour talking about some big news, Euromix 2 is coming out

58:34.940 --> 58:35.940
very soon.

58:35.940 --> 58:40.260
Matt, do you want to give us a little rundown on what's going on with Euromix 2?

58:40.260 --> 58:47.740
Okay, well Euromix 1 was out in the UK for quite a while now, it's been using the old

58:47.740 --> 58:54.380
third MIX engine that we're all familiar with from USA. However, it's really old, so they

58:54.380 --> 58:59.680
decided to update their new thing. It's actually EuroMIX 2 or EuroMAX. It's probably going

58:59.680 --> 59:05.660
to use either, I'm guessing, the DDR MAX 2 engine for it. One of the other things, other

59:05.660 --> 59:12.220
than it being in a new format, the MAX 2 format, it's going to have a nice new cabinet to go

59:12.220 --> 59:30.260
go along with it.

59:30.260 --> 59:33.260
and also Zomba records.

59:33.260 --> 59:35.260
Like Britney Spears' Zomba?

59:35.260 --> 59:37.260
Yes. Oh, dear God.

59:37.260 --> 59:39.260
But, well, it's okay.

59:39.260 --> 59:45.260
They've got a few songs I've heard of, like 5678 by the Steps.

59:45.260 --> 59:49.260
Oh, you know what, Matt? I actually have 5678 by Steps queued up here, so let's hear a little bit of this.

59:49.260 --> 59:51.260
Aren't I good here?

59:51.260 --> 59:55.260
We've got one of these songs, so here's a preview of what one of the new Euromix songs is going to be like.

59:55.260 --> 59:57.260
I'm just going to play a little bit of it here for you.

59:57.260 --> 01:00:03.400
Not to begin, no comedies, no comedies, no comedies

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.380
Kinda a little bit of repetitive here

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.100
Not to begin, no comedies, no comedies, no comedies

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:11.620
No, this is not the song that Billy had to dance to. That song was called tragedy

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:21.360
This is kinda what's on it. Probably gonna have a lot of little 12th notes in it or something

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.980
Well actually, it sounds much like cowgirl or something like that

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:37.220
That's funny because one of the other songs in there is going to be Cotton Eye Joe, which

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.500
is a country sounding song.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.900
Yeah, Cotton Eye Joe is going to be in there.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:44.700
And unfortunately it looks like Let the Move is going to be on there too.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:48.260
That means that people get to hear me scream loudly.

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.260
I guess.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.260
See.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.220
This again, in case you missed it, playing in the background is 5, 6, 7, 8 by Steps,

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.060
which is going to be one of the new songs in Euromix.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:59.900
Some of the other new songs will be Caribbean Queen by Billy Ocean.

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.660
Erin's Party, Come and Get It by Erin Carter.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.740
Oh, God.

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.940
I'm wet.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:10.540
Don't Try to Stop It by Roman Holiday.

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:13.940
Let's see, I Want You to Want Me by Solid Harmony.

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.700
Is that, I want you to want me.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.140
Probably a cover of the old Cheap Trick song.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:24.180
And the vibe is right by Ruby Turner.

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:29.220
And let's see, we've got Stomp also by The Steps, the same people that are doing 5, 6,

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.220
7, 8.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.860
I bet you Steps has broken up already.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.180
They broke up last year, so it's probably a similar kind of thing to like Smile DK where

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.020
they're getting all these songs from bands that have been broken up.

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.020
Probably.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:43.420
Then we have That Is In, This Is Now by High Five.

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:48.580
What's pretty cool though is they've actually got a lot of the stuff from older mixes that

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:53.420
we don't have in our Max 2, but some of it's pretty good. They're getting some of the Max

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:59.880
2 stuff like Living in America and the Reflex and that kind of thing. Also, they're getting

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:06.880
some of the Oni songs that, you know, were in Max 2 that we aren't getting. Like Hysteria,

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:14.180
is one of them right? Hysteria 2001 and D4U, the KOGG3 mix. They're getting those and Spin

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.180
And spin the disc and all that stuff.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:18.180
Brad's in the corner whining.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:22.180
Also, they're going to be having some DDR Max 3 songs in there.

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.180
Yes, they've got some new...

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:27.180
What?

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:30.180
These are some of the new originals that we should probably expect for Max 3.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:34.180
They have Vanity Angel by Fix.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:38.180
Memories, it's a new Naoki featuring a Poly Terry song.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:43.180
Then we have Crash by Mr. Brian and the Final Band.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.260
Wait, wait, back the train the fuck up.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.780
Politari is a very talented young lady, and I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate you guys

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:51.940
talking about her like that.

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.180
But Brad, it sucks.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.180
I know.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.180
She can hold a tune.

01:02:56.180 --> 01:03:01.260
Excuse me, the Naoki teaching Politari oni mode has got to be the best oni mode there

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.260
is.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.260
Oni, of course.

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.260
Oh, here we go.

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.260
Hold on a minute, Brad.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.260
Go through your little thing.

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.980
I have something to say about that, Brad.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:08.980
Hold on just a minute.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.980
Your digital reply.

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:10.980
Hold on, let's see.

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:11.980
I've got my reply here somewhere.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:12.980
You can't browse through it.

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:13.980
Where is it?

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:14.980
Oh, yes.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.980
Here it is.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:19.340
Oh, that makes me feel warm inside.

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:23.340
Warm and squishy?

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:29.460
You know, there have been, I can't say that the music is bad, but Paula Terry can't hold

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.460
a tune.

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:31.460
I'll say this.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.460
I'll say this.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.460
I like Email Me.

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:34.460
That's a cool one.

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.540
And I like, yeah, it's Paula Terry.

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.340
And I like, yeah, it's Paula Terry.

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.700
And I like, I like Still in My Heart.

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.700
I do like that song.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.700
But, like, Destiny? Yuck!

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:47.700
Okay, this is musical harassment, and I don't have to take it. I'm leaving.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:51.700
Just go play your Game Boy. Go play your Game Boy.

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:54.700
Okay, Matt wants to give us news now. Matt, you want to talk?

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.700
We have news.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.700
Yeah, you hate Polterra too, don't you?

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.700
Are you gay?

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.700
You take it in the ass.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.700
What the hell? That was random.

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:06.700
Are you gay?

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:11.220
No, no and no.

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.220
Let's see here.

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:16.380
One of the things that they don't mention in here is Max Unlimited.

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:19.700
So probably my guess would be is they're having some sort of unlock thing.

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.700
They're just being a secret.

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.700
They're making a secret.

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:25.100
Oh yeah, it's going to be a hidden track, whoop-de-doo.

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:28.020
Then they're probably getting Burning Heat as another hidden track.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:31.060
So they're probably going to have some hidden tracks and a similar unlock system to Max

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.060
2.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.060
Hooray for them.

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:37.120
You know, I'm still planning on eventually one of these days making an edit for Burning

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:45.160
Heat and calling it Prep H. You know, I think that would be a very good, you know, title

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:50.160
for this test.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.300
Brad went and got backups.

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.300
I like Politary. She's pretty cool.

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.300
Okay, bye.

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.300
That's all you're gonna do?

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:04.300
You know what?

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.300
Save her and fuck her!

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.300
Okay. Bye.

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:14.300
I don't know. How many people in the chatroom like Politary?

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.300
Well, let's take a quick vote.

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:21.300
Who in the chatroom likes Politary and who thinks Politary just needs to go away?

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:26.300
Yes, go ahead and send in your votes and we'll see what the majority says.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:31.300
How many times are we going to talk about Polteri on the show?

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:34.300
How many times can I work into puking sound?

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:39.300
How many songs total does it look like Euromix is going to be having?

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:45.300
Well, let me see here.

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:47.300
A lot. I don't know.

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.300
You don't have to count, just kind of guess.

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:55.300
I believe they're supposed to have 65 songs other than...

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.300
Let me see here...

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.300
A lot?

01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.300
Oh, stick with a lot.

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.300
Okay, and the chat room says,

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.300
Politary dies, Politary fucking owns.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.300
Politary is as cool as the center of hell.

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:10.300
Politary sucks, if I were a redhead I'd do a rotten.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:14.300
Politary is a no-talent whore, and I vote for Usama Kubota.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.300
Are you still going off on Politary?

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:25.140
For whoever said that Politary was as cool as the center of hell, you had to have read

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:28.060
the Inferno if you meant that in a good way.

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.900
Politary is really awesome.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.180
She's from Australia.

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.180
So is Kylie Minogue.

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:36.620
So is Olivia Newton-John, and she did Xanadu.

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.660
And Kylie Minogue is good too.

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:39.660
Yeah.

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:43.260
So is, wait, no, she has to say it.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.260
Okay, sounds like 68.

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.260
68.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.260
That's the word.

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:50.780
So I wonder, could this be some kind of example of what we could be seeing with US Max?

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:53.740
Because that's about how many songs are supposed to be in US Max.

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:59.380
Well, okay, here'd be the difference here.

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:05.020
Okay, US Max, some of the songs wouldn't work just right, especially when it comes to editing

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.020
them.

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:11.060
We're going to have probably a Britney Spears song in there, one or two.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:16.060
I'm sure there's going to be a boy band somewhere around here.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.060
Maybe Cher even.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:21.060
Boycott the boy band.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:30.060
Okay, first of all, I will personally write a scathing letter to Konami of America if there is any...

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:35.060
You know, okay, I know that there's people who like boy bands, but don't expect...

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.660
Don't expect, you know, I'm going to do exactly the same thing I did with the mix, if I did

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:42.580
it again in fifth mix, and never play it and go plug my ears when it's on.

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:47.660
We're here, somebody's been quite adamant in here, no, we will not have boy bands, so

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.420
somebody with some insider information there.

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:52.660
And then there's going to be the Let Them Trance, you know, the trance version of Let

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.660
Them Move, of course.

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.060
That was horrible, boom!

01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:01.660
A trance version of Let Them Move.

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:05.500
You know, I'm going to continue to always show my support for Konami, even if, you know,

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:09.420
we happen to do get a lot of, you know, get some crappy boy bands and let them move.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:14.620
You know, there are legitimately people who like those songs, although those people also

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:16.860
probably have had lobotomies too.

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:17.860
So.

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.720
I'm sorry, hold on.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.660
Have you seen a picture of Politary?

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:22.660
No.

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:23.660
You know who she looks like?

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:24.660
Who?

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:28.180
That chick on Magnolia that's the druggie.

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.180
I don't remember her name.

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:30.180
Yeah, okay.

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.180
I know what you're talking about.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:35.700
like her she's all skinny and like blonde and really like anorexic looking

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:40.220
and stuff and she wears really dark lipstick well thank you for that that

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:49.660
little hint it has been confirmed by the way by a economy of America

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:53.140
representative that DDR max USA will have no let them move whatsoever no

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:58.700
mixes no nothing now the British one is going to have let them move I mean the

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:03.260
to each their own that's what I always say however you know if the majority

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:06.740
says that we know we don't want this then I'm glad that they're finally

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:10.420
listening to that guys have you heard the new the new song by out phase it's

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:16.060
it's a new let them move remix it's awesome and out phase let them move

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:19.060
You think that actually might be cool, the doll face?

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.060
No.

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:25.060
Okay, so Euromix 2. Right.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.060
But we love Konami.

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.060
Right.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.060
Somebody sent me a file. I don't...

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.060
Oh, I got a picture. Hold on, I'm going to open this up.

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.060
I should not leave my file transferred.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.060
No, I shouldn't even be saying that. That's on right away.

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.060
Uh-oh.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:41.060
There we go, there's a picture of Paula Terry.

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:42.060
Hey, it's Paula Terry.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.060
Hey.

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:45.060
Paula Terry looks like she wants to be a goth girl.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.060
She does look kind of goth, don't you think?

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.060
So maybe she's slightly cool.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.060
Maybe. We'll see.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.060
Cool like the grave.

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:58.060
She needs to just maybe do some nude photography instead of singing.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:01.060
And we get a yes from Brad.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:05.060
Thank you for sending me that file. I appreciate it.

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:08.060
Pyro Man sent me that file. Thank you very much.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:14.060
Thank you for the lovely picture of the lovely and not-so-talented Politary.

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:16.060
Is there any? Yes, Matt has come in.

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:22.060
Well, also, the new cabinet that your Mix 2 is going to have, that's actually going to be the same thing for Max 3.

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.060
They're upgrading, I guess, the hardware for that, too.

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.060
Speak it big and shiny.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.060
You know what? It is about time they did that, though, don't you think?

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:31.060
Because Max 2, it seems like they're really pushing the limits of Max 2.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:36.060
And everybody keeps saying they need to have a DDR mix that has everything in it.

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:43.060
They need to have a DDR mix that has every song in it that they ever did, including Strictly Business and Editor.

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:48.060
As long as they have a better thing for it than what was in 4th Plus, because it took forever to go through the songs on all music.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:56.060
Yeah, my experience having a song list that's like huge like that, especially running my sim, I've got 800 some songs.

01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:00.060
Going through the list to try to find what you're looking for is a real bitch.

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:05.060
Well, that's kind of why I like the 5th Mixing Up, you know, little navigational thing.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:09.060
I mean, you can put it in alphabetical order or order by difficulty or speed or something like that.

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:11.060
That's pretty good, don't you think?

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:16.680
Now do you think they're actually going to call it DDR Max 3 Subtitled Dance Dance Revolution

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680
A-tard Mix?

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.680
A-tard.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.680
Oh, God.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.680
A-tard.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680
We need A-tard.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.680
A-tard.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.480
You know like how when you beat the ONI courses it says you got to the A-tard stage?

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.920
Brad finally gets that joke.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:30.560
But Brad doesn't play online much, so he doesn't.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.440
I don't have the internet.

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.440
What's the internet?

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.440
Internet?

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.720
Oh, I invented that.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.720
That's right, Brad.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.720
And we're on real radio.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.040
Oh, yes, Miss Al Gore down there on the floor invented the internet, yeah.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:45.040
They're playing Polteri out there. They're playing Love Again.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.040
And that's why I'm very lucky for the shows here.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.040
Since we weren't cool enough to get 6th style this week, we're...

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.040
Polteri rules!

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:59.040
What's the intranet? I want one of those. I'll get me one of them.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.040
We just got new rams today. We got more rams in my computer.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.040
That was bad. Anyway, enough about Polteri.

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.040
The show's getting really lame.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.040
Hitting? Hitting lame?

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.040
Hey, we are cool.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.040
Next!

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.040
So, what's next on our list?

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.040
Oh, this is for you, Brad.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.040
Anyway, that's just the Brad theme.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.040
Every time Brad walks into the room, it opens his mouth.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:29.040
I don't get it. Our Germany is broken.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.040
Our symbol is broken.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.040
Is that a rim job?

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.040
Our hi-hat is the broken one.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.520
How about a report on the condition of the machines in Goughland?

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.860
We try to make this a big show, an international show to everybody, because we have people

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.680
that listen to the show in Chile, in the Dominican Republic.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:51.560
We have people listening to the show, people in Japan, Japan is the third highest country

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:55.080
next to the US and Canada, and Minnesota.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:59.720
Minnesota is part of the US, you dumbass.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:04.960
Actually, for all of our international listeners, no, we're not the prime example of all Americans.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.000
Americans, we're just, you know, the cool people.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Yeah, we're the best ones.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.320
Everybody wishes they were like us.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:18.240
But we do sometimes, since we are kind of locally based, all the guests you see on the

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.200
show do come from the same area and play mostly at the same arcade, sometimes we like to rant

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.880
about our local arcades, so you want to give an update, status update on all the machines.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:26.880
All right.

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.360
Or Mal was just there today, he can help out too.

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:32.480
Well, last I noticed, and please correct me if I'm wrong, last I noticed starting with

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.000
the farthest corner by the bathroom.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.640
BeatMania or HipHopMania Complete Mix 2 is still having issues with their drop loading

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:43.520
coin flop, which they need to actually replace like the one at Milpitas Golf Land.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.320
Also the screen's really tweaking out now.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.320
That's to be expected.

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.160
The machine's been there for how long?

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.160
Like at least two years.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.560
Yeah, it's really tweaking.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:58.640
I played it from the day that they got it in, so even though I was really sucky at it.

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.520
Guitar Freaks is actually working.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.140
The controllers seem to be fine.

01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:09.140
was great. Drummania, the hi-hat is broken. That, for the people who don't really bother

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:14.460
themselves with the names of the different sensors, that is the far left symbol.

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:18.020
Also, Guitar Freaks is still in the CD-ROM era thing.

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:21.300
Oh it is? Are they sessioning? Did you notice?

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:26.140
I don't play session because it sucks. Hey, session is fun. Oh, Keyboardmania. It

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:31.180
looks like they finally got the keyboards replaced in time for someone to rip off the

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:35.180
far right key on the second controller side.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.180
We will find them and murder them.

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:44.180
Yeah, I heard a screw was missing on one of the guitar things.

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:49.300
Also, with keyword mania, I guess they have been having problems with people stealing

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.060
the keys again, so they actually turned the whole machine around.

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:56.020
So now the front is facing where the back was and so no one can play it and no one can

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.020
tamper with it.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:01.060
Quite honestly, I think they should do with that as they did with Guitar Freak's fifth

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:05.560
mix when we first got it in, and put it by the back counter so that the staff can better

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.560
keep an eye on it.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.560
Oh, definitely.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.060
I mean, it's not session anymore, so it doesn't really matter where it's at.

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:15.500
It's a little bit better to be slightly inconvenienced to walk, oh, the few feet to the back of the

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:20.820
building, as opposed to having them destroy a game that a lot of people really like.

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:26.580
Let's see, DVR USA, well, I personally don't know because I don't play it.

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.620
It seems to be working all right.

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:32.620
Max 2 seemed to be just fine when I was playing on it.

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.620
It's still loud.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:37.620
Base is way too high and it's still eating coins every now and then.

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.620
Same with Drummania starting to do that now too.

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:42.620
That's just all that takes is maintenance and then fixing the...

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:45.620
That's because they don't like to screw the coins so that's where it's supposed to be.

01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.620
Hey, just let them sit there.

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:49.620
Para Para worked just fine.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:53.620
I did actually notice some sensor issues.

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.620
It looks like one of the sides has drooped down just a little bit.

01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:00.760
people have been, you know, hopping up there and holding on to the thing. You know, I don't

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:04.380
blame them for not being able to read the warning since it's in Japanese, but still,

01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:07.460
you know, they should know better. It's common sense. Unfortunately, not enough people have

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:08.460
it.

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.640
Yeah, they have, like, the swing on the bar.

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:16.940
And on another note, most of the coin slots on Turtles in Time is broken. I am upset.

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:17.940
That is all.

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:21.180
Yes. And that's all the best news to me.

01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:25.740
Well, thank you for that lovely update. All right, we're going to take another quick break.

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:30.900
And when we come back, we're going to talk about, why don't we go ahead and do the best

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:34.140
2DX song to celebrate kind of sick style a little bit.

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:37.820
We'll talk about, we'll try to narrow down what the best 2DX song in history is.

01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:38.820
That works for me.

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:39.820
Sounds fun to you guys.

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:40.820
All right.

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:44.380
So we'll come back and we're going to do a little segment we call List List with the

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:46.100
best 2DX song ever.

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:50.340
And you guys in the chat room are going to be the ones that ultimately decide what it

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.340
is.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.820
So get on in our chat room right away.

01:16:52.820 --> 01:17:01.940
on irc.eggheads.org or karma.othersideirc.net, just any other side IRC server that you can

01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:07.340
think of and you're just going to join Channel Orange Lounge and you guys can help us pick

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:12.380
the best 2DX song ever. And in this break we're going to hear a couple more requests

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:19.380
and uh... will be right back

All the time, choppin' under time

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:42.380
Oh,

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:49.380
oh,

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:56.380
oh,

01:20:56.380 --> 01:21:03.380
oh,

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.380
I

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:10.380
This is fucked up!

01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:36.380
and

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:39.380
cause

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:42.380
and

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:45.380
and

01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:48.380
and

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:51.380
and

01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:54.380
and

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:57.380
and

01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:00.380
and

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:56.460
That's right, the Swedish chef endorsing Orange Lounge Radio there.

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.600
We tend to do a lot of very random things on this show, just to warn you.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:02.440
You know it's funny because a lot of people when cafe comes on they go,

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:07.440
Cafe! Oh my god! I love this song! Cafe! And then, oh, it's a promo.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.440
Here we go.

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.960
Now we are going to determine the best

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.600
2DX song

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.640
ever.

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.780
Ever, ever, ever.

01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:18.120
And to do that we're going to do a little segment we call List List.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:23.840
And participating today in the List List segment will be myself, Jamie, Matt,

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.600
Joe,

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:26.700
Bradley, and uh... Brad and Irene,

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:29.220
So Sarah Koppel, they're basically essentially one person,

01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.680
so they'll be doing one big list as one person.

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.380
And what we're going to do is each of us

01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:36.180
are going to name off our top three songs.

01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.700
And then we get to go around, and everybody

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:42.420
will get to eliminate one song from the big list.

01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:45.020
And then after that, we'll have a list of, let's see,

01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:47.840
12 songs, unless there's some duplication.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.940
We might have a little less, but there'll be 12 or less songs.

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:53.680
And that's when you three, or you guys in the chat room,

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:55.800
get to pick your top three songs.

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.860
and we'll do a vote over a really quick break.

01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.360
We'll do about a three minute break

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.960
that you guys will have to vote.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.400
So, and we're already getting people

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.840
screaming in the chat room their votes,

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.740
but remember you guys can only vote for stuff

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:06.580
that ends up on the list.

01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:08.120
So if your stuff doesn't end up on the list,

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:09.640
sorry, it just can't be considered.

01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.520
You're only gonna be able to vote

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.120
for stuff that's on the list.

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.880
So why don't we go ahead and start?

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.240
So let's go ahead and start.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.520
Jamie, why don't you go ahead and start?

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.360
Fine.

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:18.180
Your number three tune.

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.000
My number three is colors.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:20.880
Colors.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:23.880
Any reason why?

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:33.880
I've been listening. That's like one of the few songs to recently come out for 2DX that I've literally listened to 10 times in a row because I absolutely love the song.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.880
Okay.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:41.880
Yeah, it's just... I don't know. It actually just sort of reminded me of a bunch of stuff, so I like it.

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:49.880
Alright, and just a note to the chat room, please don't flood your votes. We hear you loud and clear the first line, so you don't have to type it 60 times, your votes.

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:53.940
Okay, number three, my number three pick would be Star Mine.

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.300
I would say it would be one of the best 2DX songs.

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.020
And Waving Fun.

01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.060
Okay.

01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:01.160
And yes, the video has a big part to do with that.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.000
So who's gonna go next?

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.160
Joe, you wanna go next?

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:08.280
Cracker.

01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:10.260
I don't know.

01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:12.460
Yes, we have the vote for Cracker.

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.620
Japanese hip hop is funny.

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:17.420
Yes, it is.

01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:20.060
All right, and for Matt.

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:25.940
All right, my number three has to be between,

01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:28.060
I guess it's going to have to be A.

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:30.140
It's going to be A is your number three choice, A

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.020
from seventh style.

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.020
A?

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.060
All right.

01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:34.020
Thank you very much.

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:36.020
Any other reasons you don't want to elaborate why,

01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:38.620
or just because you like it?

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.420
I like piano ambiance.

01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:41.540
OK.

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:45.020
And next we have Bradley.

01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:49.020
I've actually decided, so I'll go with number three as Kalkuta.

01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:52.020
Kalkuta! Kalkuta!

01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:56.020
It's a fun song, and it has my favorite sequence in it to play.

01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.020
Alright.

01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:59.020
Next up, Brad and Irene.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.020
That's one person.

01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:02.020
Our number three will have to be I Feel.

01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:04.020
I Feel, huh?

01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:05.020
Okay.

01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:07.020
Why do you like that one?

01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:09.020
Because the kyramoga owns all of you.

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:12.020
I Feel is a great song.

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:13.020
Get the rimshot!

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:14.020
I mean the rimshot!

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.020
Wait, hold on.

01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:16.020
I don't have the rimshot.

01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:17.020
Wait, wait.

01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:18.020
I guess I do.

01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:19.020
Thank you.

01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:20.020
I feel fulfilled.

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.020
Okay.

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:22.020
I feel...

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:23.020
Oh.

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:24.020
Your number two choice, Jamie.

01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:25.020
My number two choice?

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:26.020
Okay.

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.020
I actually did scratch off, you know, my Fuck You song, Schlagwerk, because, well, it kind

01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.020
of fell off once I heard Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock.

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:29.020
Ah.

01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:30.020
That one, not only is it one of my favorite to listen to, but it's also one of my favorite

01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:31.020
to listen to.

01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:32.020
Yeah.

01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:33.020
Yeah.

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:38.420
Well, it kind of fell off once I heard Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock.

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:43.700
That one, not only is it one of my favorites to listen to, it's probably one of my favorites

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:48.820
to play, except for that, you know, I either get the scratching or I don't, so it's a fun

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:49.820
one overall.

01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:51.860
Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock, good choice.

01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:57.860
My number two pick for best 2DX song ever would be Love is Dreaminess, just because

01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:02.260
the video is cool, I love the song, I love the vocals in it, so Love is Dreaminess.

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:06.260
We have a comment about its difficulty.

01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:10.260
It's just too damn hard. I just played it like five minutes ago, I think.

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:14.260
That song and

01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:18.260
one other, or probably the last two I have left to pass in Light 7 on

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:22.260
fifth style, is Love the Streaminess and

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:26.260
Regulus, also known as the Cardcaptor Sakura theme.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:30.260
Anyway, next is Matt. Alright, my next one is

01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:35.860
going to have to be Nemesis. Nemesis, alright. From 7th Style. 6th Style. Oh, 6th Style,

01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:40.020
I'm sorry, whoops, my bad. 6th Style. Why would you choose Nemesis? It's an awesome

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:45.460
trance song. What can I say? Okay, works for me. How about Joe? What was your number too

01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:51.900
big? SOS. SOS, also another Dr. Bombay song, why is that? I don't know, it's just crazy

01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:55.820
I guess. The video is absolutely funny. Well put, well put, it's fucking crazy, alright.

01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:59.820
Wait, I'm sorry, I need to ask the speed version or Dr. Bombay's version?

01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:01.820
Speed, I guess.

01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:06.820
The speed version? Okay, so it's not Dr. Bombay, we're talking about the speed version by, I believe it's Dr.

01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:08.820
It's not Dr. Bombay.

01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:09.820
Dr. Jekyll, thank you.

01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:10.820
Dr. Jekyll.

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:14.820
Alright, passing off to Bradley.

01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:18.820
I guess I'll go for my second pick, I'll go for Elder Wall.

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:24.820
I like it as soon as I heard it on Fizstyle and I can play it every time I play a game.

01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:25.820
Outer wall.

01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:27.820
You can do that, outer wall.

01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:30.820
Yeah, that was actually my wallpaper for the longest time.

01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:31.820
Right on.

01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:35.820
When they released all the Fizstyle pictures, I had outer wall up there for like three months.

01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:38.820
Okay, so we got everybody's number three and number two choices.

01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:39.820
No, oh, I'm sorry.

01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:40.820
You got to get Brad's.

01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:41.820
No, we have Brad's.

01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:42.820
Don't forget me.

01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:43.820
Okay.

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:50.820
Um, I'd have to say my number two is Gravity by TAC, and you want to know why? Because TAC owns you all.

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:53.820
I'm kind of surprised the amount of Seventh Style songs that are showing up here is kind of...

01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:56.820
Seventh Style is really good. Oh, that's a funny joke I read.

01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:02.820
Well, no, see, that's the reason why actually I like it, because it sounds like another incarnation of one of my favorite songs, Electro Tune, so...

01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:03.820
Way to go, TAC.

01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.820
Okay, that works. All right.

01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:06.820
It's just a TAC attack.

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:08.820
Okay, so now everybody's...

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:12.820
And we're already getting booed by a lot of people in the chat room for our choices, but you know...

01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:14.820
Well, you get to vote later.

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:17.820
Yeah, you get to vote. Anyway, you'll get to determine the final list.

01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:19.820
You'll also get a fuck you of a week next week.

01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:20.820
Alright.

01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:27.820
Alright. Number one choices. So your personal favorite 2DX song ever. Jamie.

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:32.820
Okay. As if people can't figure out what mine is going to be, it's going to be reincarnation.

01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:33.820
Reincarnation.

01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:37.820
And Brad totally called it.

01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:43.180
Well, of course this has got to be reincarnation, because I sat and was pissed at that song

01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:44.180
for weeks.

01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:49.300
The first time I passed it on 7 key, my cat walks behind my PS2 and unplugs it, and then

01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:53.460
I didn't pass it since until I actually got a third style from my friend while I was off

01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:54.700
at Anime Expo.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:31:00.220
Okay, so my number one song, and I absolutely fell in love with this song the first time

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:02.660
I heard it, and it really is the song that just hooked me into 2DX.

01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:05.820
I always thought it was cool, this is the song that hooked me into it, Deadline was

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:11.720
my number one favorite Bimani song ever so Joe why don't you give us your number

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:18.720
one pick I also like this one in a fifth and economics it's absolute by DJ Taka

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:25.320
yes his Takas so he rolls it's absolutely cool yes absolutely a good

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:30.880
choice there all right Matt your number one pick my number one pick has to be in

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:01.880
70 is hard.

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:04.400
So here we go, the very last one on the list.

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:05.400
Brad's number one choice.

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.720
R number one.

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:07.720
The envelope, please.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.720
Oh, this is actually my number one.

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.800
I chose Love, Will.

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:13.800
Love, Will.

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.800
That's a great song.

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:25.200
Alright, a lot of Rick on here, RIC, I see Love, Will in my eyes, I Feel, a lot of him

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.200
on there.

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.200
Quite a bit of LED, too.

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.200
Well, yeah, they're all Kiriyamaoka.

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.200
Yeah, alright.

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.200
Alright.

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:31.200
Okay.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:34.480
Yeah, um, surprisingly V did not show up on the list.

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.480
That kind of surprised me.

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:36.560
I thought somebody would say it.

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.120
I didn't say it because I thought somebody else would say it, but...

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.920
It's because we could name the Katimu version.

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.520
V did not show up on the list, but A did, somehow.

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.520
So...

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.520
We couldn't put the V vocal on there.

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:48.640
How about we all make a cumulative vote of V?

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.080
We just want to add V on the list?

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.080
Just...

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.080
Yeah.

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.080
Alright, we're going to put V on there.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.080
V's on there.

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:58.920
Okay, so now we have 19 songs, and we're going to now eliminate 6 of them.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:02.240
And this is kind of a hard choice, because these are all really good songs on here.

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.320
So we're going to have to take off six of them.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.320
So starting with Jamie.

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.320
Huh.

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:12.120
I actually am taking off SOS Speed.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.120
SOS Speed is gone.

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:16.200
I really personally cannot stand that version.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:19.280
I actually even refuse to play it at home, so.

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:22.440
We're already getting bitched out in the chatroom for our list, so we haven't even eliminated

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:23.440
songs yet.

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.440
Sorry, Joe.

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.440
All right.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.480
SOS is out of there.

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:32.000
uh... i have to eliminate one huh uh...

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.120
i

01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.800
i don't know i'm gonna get rid

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:36.980
you know i just

01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:40.800
i don't like this song in two d x i think it's just a song that should've

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.200
should've been only

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:46.840
in uh... keyboard mania i mean repressed though i just don't i don't care for it

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.540
didn't press it's uh...

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:51.620
it's a keyboard mania so i just don't like it to you x i'm sorry

01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:54.080
all right uh... next week

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.160
joe what do you want to take out the list

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.160
Let me see.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.160
Oh man, this is a tough one. I dunno... I'd probably take off, like...

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.160
God...

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:10.160
Give me a sec...

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.160
Oh...

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.160
A

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.160
You're taking off A! Oh!

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:18.160
Oh!

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:22.160
It's just too new. It's just too new to be the best one ever.

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:26.160
Alright, so we have Matt's choice next.

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:31.160
And I swear this isn't out of bitterness.

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:34.160
Cracker!

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.160
You know what, I have to agree, that was my other choice.

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:42.160
Alright, next we have Bradley.

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.160
Bradley is taking one off. What do you want?

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:50.160
Okay, look through the list here.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:58.660
And I'll probably offend a lot of people, but just because I don't like the singing very well in this song, it might grow on me someday, but I don't like Colors all that much yet.

01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:03.160
Colors? Oh, wow! You know, I'm good at Colors!

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.660
I'm gonna call into the corner and cry.

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.160
Alright, Colors is gone, sorry.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:12.160
Alright, next we have Brad, well, like, you know. But I can't hate Bradley because he brought me Twendy.

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:26.180
So that leaves us with our final list, and they're going to vote on this in the chat

01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:27.260
room right now.

01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:31.700
The only way I'm going to count your vote, you have to send me a private message with

01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:32.700
your vote.

01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:36.480
So I'm in the chat room, it's S-K-I-E, and I have a little bar, it says O-L. You have

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.780
to send me your vote as a private message or it doesn't count, okay?

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:41.060
Here's the final list.

01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:48.580
We have Star Mine, I Feel, Infinite Prayer, Love is Dreaminess, Nemesis, Outer Wall, Gravity,

01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:54.220
Reincarnation, Deadline, Absolute, In My Eyes, Love Will, and V.

01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:58.580
That's a whole big list and remember your vote only counts if you send it to me as a

01:35:58.580 --> 01:35:59.580
private message.

01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:04.500
So, we're going to give you three minutes to do it, so send me those right now and in

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:07.880
the meantime we're going to hear the full version of Moment, a pretty cool Five Key

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:14.880
keep being a song here you go

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:12.880
Hontou wa mina kutei

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:18.880
Just make a real moment

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:24.880
Latafume luta kere

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.880
Sono irisaki gashiru

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:34.880
Kakomo mila imo

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.880
Oh

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:10.880
Stay at every moment

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:16.880
I'm not afraid of you

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.880
I'm not afraid of you

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:26.880
I'm not afraid of you

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:31.880
Just make a real moment

01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:57.400
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.

01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:04.760
Under Sedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica, Saturdays, 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m.

01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:11.760
at understudationlive.org

01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:25.280
that's right you are listening to orange lounge radio where we've been

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:30.120
determining via our chat room in a little process we call listless

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.720
the best 2DX song ever

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:36.560
So our chat room has voted. We came up with our own little lists here.

01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:41.720
Chat room didn't agree with our lists. They didn't agree with some of the songs we knocked off, but that's just the way it works. We're sorry.

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:45.360
But the chat room has voted, and we do have a winner.

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:50.960
We have a few winners. We have, in third place for Best 2DX Song Ever is...

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.480
Star Mine!

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:54.720
Yay!

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:57.720
Second place for Best 2DX Song Ever...

01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:58.920
Love Will!

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.240
Yay!

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.040
and

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:10.400
the best to the x on as voted by our chat room

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:15.400
absolute was voted the best to the x are there are

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:16.200
and i don't know

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.520
expected

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.560
i don't know what has to do with them

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:23.840
what if it has to do with the fact that this also happens to be in that

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.360
d r whatever

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.800
at but absolutely happy

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:32.080
I mean, when you listen to Absolut, how can you just not want to stand up and dance a

01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.640
little jig to it or something?

01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:38.080
It's kind of like it got that medieval sounding thing to it, and it's just like, I'm in the

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:42.040
castle and I'm going to go joust, and I'm going to eat big slaps of beef.

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:45.880
The only joust that I do is on the Atari 5200, thank you.

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:49.880
Alright, so once again, third place was Star Mine.

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:53.960
I'm sorry, wait, hold on one second.

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:57.640
When I hear Absolut, I definitely do not think of like, going and jousting.

01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:00.520
Where the hell did that come from?

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:04.980
It comes from the fact that Ultracade happens to be right there, which has joust in it.

01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:05.980
So when...

01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:08.560
You've been watching too much Alanis Morissette videos, haven't you?

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:10.320
Her precious illusions, medieval...

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.400
I didn't even think of that, no, no.

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:13.880
They don't joust in that video, shut up.

01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:14.880
Go make a jousting freestyle.

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:15.880
Shut up!

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:18.320
Go make a jousting freestyle for DDR.

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:19.320
Maybe I will.

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.320
I just might.

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.560
But you have to come out on the bird.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.720
You have to have the bird from joust.

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.720
Will you be my bird, Jamie?

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:52.560
Just before you finish this, I'd like to say that I am very displeased with all of you

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:58.160
Because you took off the best songs, all of the songs I picked, and my opinion is the

01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:59.500
only one that matters.

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:00.500
I am God.

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:01.500
What?

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:02.500
Okay.

01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:03.500
I didn't.

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:04.500
I'm good.

01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:05.500
Wait, where's my vomit?

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:06.500
Do the vomit.

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:07.500
Do the vomit.

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:08.500
Give me the vomit.

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:13.180
You have to say, show me the vomit.

01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:14.180
Show me the vomit.

01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:15.180
You can't handle the truth.

01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.180
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:17.180
Guys, I love you guys.

01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:18.180
I'm sorry.

01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:21.180
Okay, I'm sorry. Guys, I love you guys.

01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:24.180
Apologize to the chat room and say you're sorry and you love them.

01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:29.180
I love you guys, chat room. How many people do we have in the chat room right now?

01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:30.180
Thirteen.

01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:32.180
Okay, I love you. All thirteen of you.

01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:33.180
All at once?

01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:35.180
Because Brad and I are the only people that have taste.

01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:40.180
Oh, Jamie! As if I wasn't harsh enough.

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:44.180
No, you all have good taste. Absolutely is a good choice from the majority.

01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:47.180
Yeah, I think absolute is pretty. It's fair. It's fair.

01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:52.020
Alright, on the total, in another part of the country, in another dimension, we have

01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:53.020
other news.

01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.020
Yes, Matt?

01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:57.580
Well, let's see here, since there's not really much sim news going on, since all the websites

01:43:57.580 --> 01:44:05.660
are down because of bandwidth issues, we have one thing, the DDR East Coast Invasion DWI

01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:09.260
contest, the results are in, and I'm very disappointed with them.

01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:12.100
Now, that's your own personal damn opinion, by the way.

01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:16.800
Hey, it's my personal opinion, you know, being the sort of sim expert here, and I've played

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:17.800
all of these

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:20.640
i'll give you that out of the people in this room you would be the same expert

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:21.760
okay has you been

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:24.920
you've been playing step mania do you know i know that before they were like

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:28.160
cool look like max and all that so i'll give you that yeah okay well

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:33.800
third-place uh... was evolution uh... i believe it was

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:36.640
by a mercury storm

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:40.780
memory serves me right i believe is evolution time is pop mix

01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:42.120
remember correctly

01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:46.960
uh... second place was naturally by the money really which should have taken it

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:49.440
and you know i'm very disappointed uh...

01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:53.360
and first place was healing vision half mix which is like a remix of healing

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.320
vision with

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.920
healing vision angelic mixed together which

01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:58.520
really got their retarded

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:02.040
by cn only and they got pretty little strongly there about that which is

01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:02.960
retarded

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.720
now i'd like to add that if i had entered i would probably

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.900
now one but

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.320
that's just me

01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:13.320
I thought you were going to be doing an entry with, can I say what you were going to do?

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:20.320
You were going to go ahead and do an era Good Cool Fat Mix, the kind of rap version era, which is by the way on our playlist for Bomani Music and More.

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:29.320
I was doing that and I kind of slacked off and procrastinated on it and didn't quite get it done.

01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:34.320
So that's why I don't have it and I was even playing and making my own video and that would have made me win.

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:38.040
but you know unfortunately I didn't get a chance to enter it and they're still

01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:41.460
gonna have some more contests so I'll plan on entering those I'll get some

01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:45.860
done I've got a list of stuff I've got to make but you know I haven't had time

01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:49.860
okay you just haven't had that you've been too lazy well actually the last

01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:53.040
couple weeks I haven't had air conditioning and I couldn't sit at home

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:57.940
and program you know steps in like 102 degrees in my house so I said you know

01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:03.060
the health it and went and played DVR and said chat room does a lot of fans

01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:09.100
of the half mix there in the chat room. They seem to like it, some of them. Just to each

01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:14.940
their own, I suppose. It was good, but it wasn't the best. Let's just put it out there.

01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:21.140
Them's fighting words, Matt. Next time I will show them up. I'll be there. You'll be there

01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:25.100
with bells on. Yes, I will be there. The next contest that they have, I will enter. You

01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:31.100
will see Loki plaster something on there, so I will definitely enter. Alright, we trust

01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:34.260
Looking forward to it.

01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:37.400
On another completely random subject, something else we're going to be doing in the future

01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.820
on Orange Lounge, we're going to be showcasing some original work.

01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:44.900
We've got a supporter of the show who's in the chatroom right now, goes by the name Akil,

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:50.700
and he's going to be loaning us one of his MP3s, he wants to hopefully get into DDR.

01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:54.480
We're going to showcase that in our Bomani Music and More program, and some people have

01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.680
been sending us some of their own homemade remixes.

01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:01.420
So Jamie and I are going to tear through some of those, and we might put a couple of those

01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:05.440
up in a rotation, because we don't want to just draw the line on Bimani songs.

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:09.380
As you know, in our music show, we do sometimes put in songs we think ought to be in Bimani.

01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:13.560
We put in some Parappa stuff just for laughs and other things, Pump It Up stuff, just because

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.560
it might as well be Bimani.

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:20.960
Something that we could even take live bands, if there's a local band in the area, we support

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.400
Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:23.400
Sure, sure.

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:30.400
If you've made a song and you think it deserves to be in DDR, 2DX, any of those games,

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:33.400
I say it's good enough for our station, so send it to us and we'll listen to it.

01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:36.400
Yes, I have already gotten a few remixes, so Jamie and I are going through those.

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:43.400
I was sent a Hysteria remix by JB, and I believe there's also supposed to be a remix of Cowgirl

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:46.400
that he's going to send me pretty soon, so I'll have to take a listen to those.

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:49.400
And Kiel also has a pretty good Papaya mix there.

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:50.400
Oh yeah, I love that.

01:47:50.400 --> 01:48:01.400
He'll go ahead and, if I ask him to, go ahead, Kiel, plug your website there in the chatroom, and he's got a great Papaya mix there, so if you're in the chatroom, go check that out, it's pretty funny. Pretty good stuff.

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:05.400
And I say funny because Papaya makes me laugh, just her voice, I don't know. Yes.

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:14.400
And I'd like to say that I do have some of Kiel's songs in my sim, I've got those off of the Imani Rulers site, and they're pretty good, I like them.

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:16.400
So lots of support, keep up the good work.

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.400
Cool. So we're going to be doing that soon. That's the future direction Orange Lounge Radio is going to be taking.

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:27.400
Gosh, I think we're damn near out of topics to talk about, so how about we just talk about other stuff?

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:32.400
How's your guys' week been going? Any funny DDR stories from the week?

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.400
Oh, well I think we might have toxic mold in our apartment.

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:36.400
Why's that?

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:40.400
Because I'm coughing up like thick white shit in the morning every morning.

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:41.400
Ew!

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:45.080
And no, wait, but the more important thing is it's making it hard for me to play DDR.

01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:47.760
That's the most important thing.

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:50.960
Aw, you can't beat those Oni Choruses with these and your Double.

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.880
Well, no, man, Max Unlimited is really hard when you get into it and you're coughing up shit.

01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:58.840
The way Brad plays DDR is really hilarious.

01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:02.120
The way he dances when he does Doubles, it's like

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:07.360
the center of his body is completely on the other pad as to where his legs are.

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:10.840
And he's embarrassed. He's turning the color pink here, but it's so true. It's cool.

01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:16.980
I love watching Brad do doubles because like it looks like those videos you ever seen those videos where they split the screen in half

01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:20.920
And like the heads over here and the feet over here. That's what Brad looks like when he dances

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:23.360
But his style is absolutely awesome

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.520
And it's lanky lanky style

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:32.740
Yes, you know, I'm still think it's pretty cool to be able to pass catastrophes, you know

01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:36.960
I don't care what said to say. Oh, we could pass the ball. We don't count I keep counts

01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:43.480
so damn it. I passed my 16th catastrophic, yay. I passed Kakame the first time I played

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:46.840
it. God, that song was easy. I feel it was freaking easy.

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:50.920
You've been playing the katas since, what, second, third mix? I don't know. When did

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:54.400
you start playing the katas? I first started trying them when third mix

01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:57.840
had just come out. I had second mix at home. Now, is it just me or are the katas getting

01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:02.840
easier? You know, they are. My knee gave out on me

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:06.840
trying dead end last night, but dead end is still hard to me. However, I was thinking

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:10.700
that Kakamei was going to be this end-all difficult song because Burning Heat was so

01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:15.000
freaking evil and Kakamei was just so damn easy.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.840
And I feel, you know, people were saying, oh, I feel is so hard because the steps don't

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:19.840
make sense.

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.880
The steps make perfect sense if you just listen to the music.

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:27.380
That song was absolutely, it, Kakamei was slightly easier, but I feel it was easier

01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:28.380
than some seven-footers.

01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:29.680
I mean, it was that easy.

01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:31.800
Yeah, I mean, I've definitely agreed.

01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:35.160
I just have to say Jamie's opinion is spreading faster than Anna Nicole Smith's legs right

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.160
now.

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:37.800
Okay, I

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:42.960
Have to definitely agree that the cat is it being way easier the one the only few cat is I can't pass her off of

01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:48.000
Third mix, you know, we've got Afro Nova which I'm talking about doubles here. Well, actually probably singles too

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.520
Okay, so I've got Afro Nova dead end. Well dead end that could pass singles, but not doubles and paranoia rebirth

01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:55.680
I can't pass on doubles. I

01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.240
Have my list somewhere. I'll go get it

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:04.800
I think they're just making I think they're doing away with cat is and while we have is like, you know foot rankings now

01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:06.800
I don't see the word cata or anything like that anymore

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:14.040
And I think they're making the 10-footers the so-called cata's now because all the new nine-footers are just way too easy

01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.800
And I really hope Konami

01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:19.760
You know takes their head out of their ass and fixes it because I like the really hard

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:26.320
You know the super hardness of like you know max 300 next unlimited, but I want more songs like Afro Nova

01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:31.760
Doubles maniac you know something like that's not extremely hard, but yet still a good workout

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:36.840
Now, one of my favorite katas, something I kind of liked about Max 2, was that a lot

01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:39.480
of the steps started to go with the music a little better.

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:42.780
It kind of made a lot of the katas were actually fun to dance to, as opposed to just being

01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:45.520
like a bunch of really fast eighth notes, you know?

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:49.040
One of my favorite katas, and I know this is an overplayed song, but just bear with

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:52.860
me, Sugaru, I think is one of the coolest katas because the dance goes with the music

01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:55.280
so well that it's really fun to dance to.

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.920
What do you, do you agree with me, or?

01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.400
Yeah, it's very good.

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:01.400
Sugaru was one of the ones they really, I think, they did a great job on.

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:06.080
I think that's one of the few Max 2 songs I could say they did not you know skimp on for us

01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:08.520
But I have to say something before we go on somebody in there

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:12.260
It seems like a couple people don't seem to like primeval. Oh my god

01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:18.640
Can you guys beat it on maniac doubles because try doing it down at AX where they have like dust all over it

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:20.720
And you're sliding all over

01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:23.540
AI that's what I think you Jamie AI

01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:24.880
Oh my god

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:27.380
Everybody in the entire arcade turned around to watch me

01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:31.680
me try to beat that thing because you can't play, you can't stick to the machine on Afro

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:32.680
Nova Primeval Devils.

01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.680
It's just, ugh.

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:34.680
So, yeah.

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:35.680
Let's see you try it.

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:40.280
You know what I have, this is my opinion of what Akata should be, is a song that you should

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:46.480
not be able to beat your first time, and at least three on max two, I have gone and beaten

01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.480
instantly.

01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:49.080
Well, like, you know, some of the songs were actually the first time I'd actually ever

01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:52.080
tried them, the ones they upgraded to Nine Footers.

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:55.760
Well, I mean, of course I've done, you know, Burning the Floor, because, you know, that

01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:56.760
was my song.

01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:59.880
know that that was probably a mistake on Konami's part.

01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:04.680
Like end of the century, I beat it first try and they upgraded it to a nine.

01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:06.680
I'd finally just gotten around to trying it.

01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:10.920
Paranoia case, not paranoia, yeah, case set, the clean mix.

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:11.920
They upgraded that to a nine.

01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:15.440
You have to remember also, Jimmy, you're getting better, so you're going to start beating more

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.440
things on the first try.

01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:18.840
You still shouldn't be able to beat a nine footer your first time.

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:23.220
Do you think that's why they've invented, I guess, so to speak, the ten footer?

01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:25.720
Because now they're going to start adding songs that are ten feet that you're just not

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:28.360
going to be able to beat your first time although there's going to be people out

01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:31.360
there that just you know they're so good at DDR at this point you know they're

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:34.040
going to beat it the first time because there's nothing Konami can do. I still

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.720
think the game you know I'm glad I put in the Oni courses because that keeps

01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:40.320
the challenge but that's like a PA challenge they need to have I mean

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:43.800
there's not really any way to increase the difficulty past where it is there's

01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:47.320
not really a way I mean unless you're going to be stuff I can't pass today

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:51.580
that's the one that gives me issues. You could do you could do a six panel if

01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:55.160
they made six panel more than just solo I mean could that be a new challenge?

01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.160
still kills me.

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.920
Yeah, I mean, Six Metal's a little crazy, but...

01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:59.640
Solo sucks anyway.

01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:03.640
They need to stop making difficult songs and make fun songs.

01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:07.520
I mean, there's a lot of steps out there that are pretty difficult, but the steps are just

01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:08.520
not fun.

01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:11.400
Like, Hakumei, it sort of flows but doesn't.

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:16.880
I feel it kind of feels like you're in a car with someone trying to learn to drive.

01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:20.680
It just starts going, stops, starts going, stops, starts going, stops.

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:22.800
I feel it follows the back pattern in the music.

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:23.800
Well, it does.

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:24.880
It's just like every edit I make.

01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.480
It does, but the problem is maybe that doesn't flow quite as well as they could have done

01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:30.480
it.

01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:34.080
See, I didn't really think it did not flow, but then again, that's what I listened to.

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.080
It's just weird.

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.080
It's weird to dance to.

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.440
It's so kind of like off and weird.

01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:39.800
I didn't think it was weird at all.

01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:44.000
But then again, for anybody who's ever played any of the edits that I make, you know what

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.400
it is that I listen to in the music.

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:51.320
Which is a pretty popular thing to do with edits, to find another instrument in the song.

01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:55.120
One thing I always, I think, are interesting about catas is the ones where your feet kind

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:56.920
of make another instrument.

01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:59.320
An example of this I think would be either a Santa Milette or Orion.

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.000
I guess Santa Milet is not really a cata, but you know, it's a difficult song.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.720
And Orion, 7-8, it's like your feet kind of make another instrument.

01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:09.300
Those are kind of cool catas because they take a while to kind of learn how to play

01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:13.120
that instrument, and then your feet kind of make a new tune.

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:14.120
I kind of think those catas are fun.

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.120
That's sort of the basis for another.

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:16.120
Yeah.

01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:17.120
For my D-X-Y, I did another.

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:21.040
Which the challenge is still out there if you want free food, okay?

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:23.800
You want to just run over your challenge one more time?

01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:24.800
Okay.

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:31.480
For anybody who can either full combo or 90% perfect attack my DXY edit another, I will

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:35.800
take you out to a dinner of up to $15.

01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:36.800
How does that sound?

01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:40.600
Of course, provided I can afford it.

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:43.480
Keep in mind, I'm unemployed right now, I may have to owe you a rain check, but I will

01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:50.120
definitely, the first person who does it, you are getting taken out to a nice dinner.

01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:56.260
what do we hear I want my GC okay okay yes this has to go for the second the

01:55:56.260 --> 01:56:03.920
second challenge for whoever can full combo my look to the sky at it was a you

01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:09.220
know at least a 90% perfect attack then you get a free game cue pin which is

01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:15.920
still in my purse Oh tennies if you can send me proof that it's been passed to

01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:22.280
then send me a photo of the screen, you know, or a video or something. Send me, you know,

01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:25.360
physical proof and I will be sending you a GameCube pen.

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:30.480
All right. Pretty cool. We still have three minutes left. Anybody got any other closing

01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:34.480
thoughts? Just for anything. It doesn't have to be Bomani. Anything you guys want to talk

01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:42.840
about? Yeah. My spoon is too big. Austin Powers 3 coming out this Friday. Oh, yeah. Same jokes

01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:47.560
I don't think they can do that.

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:49.000
I don't care.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.880
I want to go see it.

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:56.480
Everyone is pointing them at me?

01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:57.480
We can't pick it up.

01:56:57.480 --> 01:56:58.480
We want comments from Irene.

01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:59.480
I'm sorry.

01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:02.640
All I was going to say is that I got a different car.

01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:03.640
Wow.

01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:04.640
Congratulations.

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:05.640
You finally got rid of the Golf, right?

01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:06.640
Yeah.

01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:07.640
All right.

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.640
Way to go.

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:09.640
Actually, I need people to do me a favor.

01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:10.640
What's that?

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:11.640
For people, it doesn't matter what part of the country you're in.

01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:20.080
I asked some people to help me find an 83 Toyota Corolla AE86 hatchback, so I can have

01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:23.360
my trainer one ended up like the initial D-car.

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:26.360
If anyone can find one or has one for sale, let me know.

01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:30.160
I will buy it.

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.760
And Eight-Legged Freaks was okay.

01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:33.760
Go see it though.

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:34.760
That looks so retarded.

01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:36.600
It was a drive-in movie.

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:37.600
It looks retarded.

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.600
Okay.

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:39.600
I went and saw it.

01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:40.600
I based my opinion on the trailers.

01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:48.800
best way to describe it. It was better than Tremors, but not quite as good as Gremlins.

01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:52.580
It was just campy. It was meant to be campy. It was meant to be stupid. The whole point

01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:57.360
is that it has very little plot. You just watch a bunch of people try to survive spiders,

01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:00.620
and that's the whole movie. It's a drive-in movie. It's meant to be cheesy and corny.

01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:08.060
It's paying homage to all those giant monster movies of the 50s.

01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:09.060
It was better.

01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:14.140
You know, arachnophobia, when I saw that, I went to go make out with somebody.

01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:15.140
You dog!

01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:18.780
They didn't have eight legs, did they?

01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:20.860
I wasn't watching the movie.

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:24.180
Okay, on that note, I believe we are going to put the nail in the coffin of this show

01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:25.740
now.

01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:26.740
Join us next week.

01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:30.760
Once again, we're going to be joined by special guests Mel B and Melody are going to be here

01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:33.220
to talk about, oh, God knows what.

01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:38.380
And after this show's over, why don't you listen to our Bamani Music and More program,

01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:42.260
playing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when this show is not on the air.

01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:46.940
And we're going to be putting new stuff this week into the rotation, all sorts of new crap,

01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:49.740
including some of the stuff you heard tonight on the show.

01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:51.580
And I believe that's about it.

01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:53.540
I can't think of anything else you want to say, Jimmy?

01:58:53.540 --> 01:58:57.980
I'm going to go officially brain dead once the show's over, so I have nothing else to

01:58:57.980 --> 01:58:58.980
say.

01:58:58.980 --> 01:58:59.980
Alright, sounds good.

01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:01.660
Thanks everybody for listening, we'll see you next week at 7 o'clock.

01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:05.180
If you missed any part of the show, we'll be rebroadcasting tonight's show tomorrow

01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:07.520
night at seven o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:08.520
Have a good night everybody.

01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:09.520
Thanks for listening.

01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:10.520
Good night.

01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:11.520
Good night.
