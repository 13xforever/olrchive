00:02.228 --> 00:04.750
[SPEAKER_12]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:05.371 --> 00:08.233
[SPEAKER_12]: Our live talk program begins now.

00:19.922 --> 00:29.910
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio may contain sexual and adult content and many instances of the F-word, which is not safe for children.

00:44.423 --> 00:46.864
[SPEAKER_15]: God damn you, stop calling here.

00:46.924 --> 00:48.945
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't it 4215, pussy whee?

00:49.365 --> 00:50.066
[SPEAKER_15]: You bitch!

00:50.126 --> 00:53.147
[SPEAKER_15]: Now let me check that this goes 2-1-2, fuck you!

00:53.167 --> 00:54.828
[SPEAKER_15]: You have no morals, darling.

00:54.928 --> 00:59.830
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of herpes.

00:59.850 --> 01:02.191
[SPEAKER_05]: Kiss my great nooch.

01:02.231 --> 01:04.612
[SPEAKER_05]: Mecca lecca hi, mecca hi-dee-ho.

01:04.692 --> 01:06.973
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.

01:07.053 --> 01:08.193
[SPEAKER_15]: Me too!

01:08.454 --> 01:08.954
[SPEAKER_15]: Fucker, yeah?

01:09.194 --> 01:10.114
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working on it.

01:10.835 --> 01:11.295
[SPEAKER_07]: Loser.

01:11.435 --> 01:11.935
[SPEAKER_15]: Lame!

01:12.335 --> 01:13.916
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the size of my face.

01:14.881 --> 01:19.748
[SPEAKER_15]: Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.

01:19.808 --> 01:25.536
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.

01:25.557 --> 01:27.019
[SPEAKER_15]: I am your singing colleague.

01:31.227 --> 01:39.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

01:39.415 --> 01:43.438
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned in to the Balamani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Balamani.

01:43.859 --> 01:45.960
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

01:46.061 --> 01:49.944
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

01:50.945 --> 01:51.505
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

01:52.026 --> 01:52.526
[SPEAKER_11]: I am doing.

01:52.847 --> 01:53.127
[SPEAKER_11]: And you?

01:53.387 --> 01:54.188
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you, gentlemen?

01:54.949 --> 01:55.509
[SPEAKER_11]: All your best, sir.

01:55.529 --> 01:57.010
[SPEAKER_11]: We love you a lot.

01:58.052 --> 02:00.933
[SPEAKER_03]: This is episode number five for July the 21st of 2002.

02:01.353 --> 02:03.734
[SPEAKER_03]: We are joined in studio once again by many, many guests.

02:03.774 --> 02:04.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello, everybody.

02:06.514 --> 02:08.975
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to introduce everybody one by one real fast.

02:09.015 --> 02:09.635
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Irene.

02:10.735 --> 02:11.276
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Brad.

02:12.596 --> 02:13.336
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Joe.

02:14.296 --> 02:14.877
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Dave.

02:16.097 --> 02:16.797
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Matt.

02:18.037 --> 02:18.678
[SPEAKER_03]: That's everybody.

02:19.538 --> 02:20.378
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Bradley.

02:21.998 --> 02:23.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Bradley's here, finally.

02:23.359 --> 02:23.419
Wee!

02:24.736 --> 02:25.456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he shows up.

02:25.936 --> 02:26.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Our moral support.

02:26.677 --> 02:28.417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably the only time you're going to hear him the whole show.

02:29.978 --> 02:34.800
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll be talking to all our guests a little bit later, but first we're going to take a very quick break.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other opening thoughts?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.541
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm seeing this right now that I still love Bradley because he brought me a Twinbee book.

02:40.782 --> 02:41.102
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh!

02:41.542 --> 02:42.922
[SPEAKER_11]: Twinbee is ownage.

02:43.382 --> 02:45.483
[SPEAKER_03]: Very neat, very neat.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.344
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish our webcam was working so I could show...

02:48.954 --> 02:54.857
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could show the elation here on the webcam, but unfortunately, if you do try to go to the webcam on our site, it isn't working right now.

02:54.877 --> 02:56.298
[SPEAKER_03]: But we will have that back next week.

02:56.859 --> 03:00.401
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have a big, big show next week, and we'll talk more about that a little bit later.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.602
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say, happy birthday, Joe Mama.

03:04.143 --> 03:04.883
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy birthday!

03:05.163 --> 03:06.324
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play some music right now.

03:06.344 --> 03:10.086
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start it off with something Jamie requested, which I think is very cool.

03:10.366 --> 03:11.327
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to introduce this for us?

03:12.128 --> 03:18.476
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is, I'm sure everyone is familiar with a particular song from 2DX Third Style by DJ Taka.

03:18.496 --> 03:19.938
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is remixed by Naoki.

03:20.178 --> 03:20.399
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy.

06:34.467 --> 06:35.068
Thanks for watching!

07:34.236 --> 07:35.597
Thank you for watching.

07:35.637 --> 07:37.478
See you next time.

08:12.213 --> 08:20.897
[SPEAKER_12]: And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

08:21.137 --> 08:22.038
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it all night.

08:22.298 --> 08:23.158
[SPEAKER_16]: Do it with me.

08:23.599 --> 08:25.960
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.340
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you take vocal lessons?

08:27.420 --> 08:28.381
[SPEAKER_16]: Kill your teacher!

08:28.881 --> 08:29.882
[SPEAKER_16]: In the heat of the night.

08:30.342 --> 08:32.563
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

08:33.743 --> 08:34.404
[SPEAKER_16]: I liked it.

08:34.904 --> 08:36.445
[SPEAKER_17]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

08:36.565 --> 08:36.965
[SPEAKER_17]: Next!

08:37.908 --> 08:44.456
[SPEAKER_17]: Um... That was cool... Do you even know why you're here?

08:44.536 --> 08:46.218
[SPEAKER_17]: That was just bloody pathetic!

08:46.298 --> 08:46.758
[SPEAKER_17]: Next!

08:47.840 --> 08:49.662
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on, Ava.

08:49.702 --> 08:51.204
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on, do it with me.

08:52.085 --> 08:52.305
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes!

08:52.705 --> 08:53.346
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's it!

08:53.686 --> 08:54.768
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a winner!

08:55.621 --> 08:59.403
[SPEAKER_12]: A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

09:00.164 --> 09:04.106
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

09:04.866 --> 09:08.528
[SPEAKER_03]: I just repeated myself, but that's okay, because I can do anything I want on this show.

09:09.389 --> 09:10.469
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the power.

09:10.549 --> 09:11.810
[SPEAKER_11]: We control the vertical.

09:11.830 --> 09:13.611
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no vertical or horizontal on the radio.

09:13.911 --> 09:15.212
[SPEAKER_11]: We control the audio.

09:15.332 --> 09:16.733
[SPEAKER_03]: I could drop everybody like that.

09:18.081 --> 09:18.781
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to do that.

09:18.801 --> 09:22.222
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not going to do that because I noticed we're actually starting to get some listeners.

09:22.242 --> 09:23.082
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty cool.

09:23.122 --> 09:23.643
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm liking this.

09:23.723 --> 09:25.163
[SPEAKER_03]: And we love you all.

09:25.263 --> 09:28.204
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to say hi to us, why don't you come join us in our chat room?

09:28.504 --> 09:32.105
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to get any IRC program, like MIRC is a popular one.

09:32.405 --> 09:39.427
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as your server, you're going to choose any other side IRC server, like irc.eggheads.org is one.

09:40.027 --> 09:46.230
[SPEAKER_03]: or you can join OthersideIRC.net, or I believe it's Caram at OthersideIRC.net.

09:46.530 --> 09:50.011
[SPEAKER_03]: And all you're going to do once you get on one of those servers, you're just going to join Channel Orange Lounge.

09:50.771 --> 09:52.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people seem to really like some music in that set.

09:53.272 --> 09:58.755
[SPEAKER_03]: The last set we had 0.59 by DJ Taka, but that was remixed by Naoki, a piano version there.

09:59.435 --> 10:00.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Seemed to be pretty well liked.

10:01.075 --> 10:04.377
[SPEAKER_03]: Also after that we had a very popular drum mania song, Dynamite.

10:05.057 --> 10:05.778
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

10:34.853 --> 10:35.273
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jamie.

10:35.294 --> 10:35.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Well put.

10:35.534 --> 10:35.794
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

10:35.994 --> 10:36.234
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

11:01.599 --> 11:04.980
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, we've just got these big egos tonight.

11:05.020 --> 11:05.780
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is.

11:05.840 --> 11:06.881
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something in the air.

11:06.941 --> 11:07.881
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a big ego.

11:07.901 --> 11:08.801
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm intensely modest.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the California heat.

11:11.602 --> 11:13.203
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some big news for the show.

11:13.803 --> 11:17.984
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week on the show, we're going to have our very first special guests.

11:18.465 --> 11:18.805
[SPEAKER_03]: Guests.

11:18.985 --> 11:23.486
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just one special guest, but two special guests here on the show next week, next Sunday.

11:24.246 --> 11:26.987
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you care to tell them about our lovely guests we're going to have, Jamie?

11:27.267 --> 11:27.548
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

11:27.568 --> 11:28.768
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think we should make it a surprise?

11:28.788 --> 11:28.848
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

11:29.249 --> 11:32.390
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've already told half the people in this room, but nobody online knows, I don't think.

11:33.070 --> 11:33.470
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

11:33.831 --> 11:38.512
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we're actually having over Melody and Mel B. Yep.

11:39.352 --> 11:45.074
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're going to be our guests on the show, and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them.

11:45.975 --> 11:46.355
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

11:46.855 --> 11:50.936
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to move everything out into the living room because this room is cramped as it is when we do the show here.

11:51.136 --> 11:53.537
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd have to say so, and quite toasty and moist.

11:54.737 --> 11:56.338
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you feeling a little moist tonight, Jamie?

11:57.173 --> 11:58.313
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, every night on the show.

12:02.034 --> 12:03.514
[SPEAKER_11]: As Irene makes this face.

12:03.974 --> 12:06.975
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio makes you moist as a snack cake.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.015
[SPEAKER_11]: You're squishy.

12:10.415 --> 12:11.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, yes.

12:12.836 --> 12:13.076
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

12:13.816 --> 12:17.697
[SPEAKER_03]: So next week should be a good show because Mel B will be here to talk about freestyle stuff.

12:17.757 --> 12:19.697
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what we'll talk to him about.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe about his retirement.

12:21.477 --> 12:23.598
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't he retire and then he kind of came back out of retirement?

12:23.818 --> 12:24.478
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like Jordan.

12:24.638 --> 12:24.978
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

12:25.840 --> 12:26.620
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

12:46.589 --> 12:49.190
[SPEAKER_03]: In the chat room, they're asking, wasn't Mel B one of the Spice Girls?

12:49.531 --> 12:51.332
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're not having that Mel B on the show.

12:51.372 --> 12:52.032
[SPEAKER_03]: God, no.

12:52.652 --> 12:55.994
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless I get to, you know, use her gigantic teeth for Tarka practice.

12:59.135 --> 13:04.358
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the freestyle Mel B. I don't know what the last tournament was that he won.

13:04.378 --> 13:05.478
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any idea?

13:06.239 --> 13:07.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what some of his big routines were.

13:07.659 --> 13:09.080
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he had a really good one at SCAD.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.000
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a good routine.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.802
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to do an improv routine to Boom Boom Dollar, which was hilarious.

13:12.822 --> 13:15.203
[SPEAKER_11]: There was also the Silent Hill one.

13:15.643 --> 13:17.944
[SPEAKER_11]: Does everyone know who Mel B is?

13:19.425 --> 13:20.606
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see that.

13:21.166 --> 13:29.691
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people, if you download videos from DDR Freak or any site that offers videos of freestyle competitions from the Bay Area, you're going to probably find a Mel B video.

13:29.711 --> 13:31.532
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most people are familiar with his work.

13:32.193 --> 13:39.837
[SPEAKER_11]: I can actually confirm that from people in Mississippi, in Alabama, where I was going to play DDR at Boomtown.

13:39.857 --> 13:41.078
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, you're from California?

13:41.138 --> 13:42.058
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God, do you know Mel B?

13:42.118 --> 13:42.178
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

13:44.952 --> 13:45.573
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I got.

13:46.634 --> 13:47.575
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a celebrity, man.

13:47.635 --> 13:47.955
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

13:48.576 --> 13:51.479
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a DDR celebrity, and he'll be here in-house next week.

13:54.743 --> 13:57.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's special, to be a DDR celebrity?

13:57.946 --> 13:58.707
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, why not?

13:59.949 --> 14:00.990
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a DDR celebrity.

14:03.533 --> 14:04.954
[SPEAKER_03]: And why are you a DDR celebrity?

14:05.715 --> 14:06.256
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I am.

14:07.574 --> 14:11.337
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was that, um, wait, I can't say that name on this radio station, can I?

14:11.778 --> 14:15.401
[SPEAKER_04]: But that one instance with this, the, uh, unnamed person, we don't have the name.

14:15.681 --> 14:16.221
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what?

14:16.241 --> 14:17.603
[SPEAKER_04]: That made her a celebrity.

14:18.343 --> 14:19.724
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the whole rice princess.

14:19.985 --> 14:20.845
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, whatever, whatever.

14:20.865 --> 14:21.886
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to go into that, sorry.

14:22.327 --> 14:26.610
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean to bring the show to a crashing halt or anything, come on.

14:27.351 --> 14:30.574
[SPEAKER_11]: But, no, um, you know, it's kind of funny, though, I've noticed that, like,

14:31.420 --> 14:31.500
[SPEAKER_11]: D.D.R.

14:31.540 --> 14:31.681
[SPEAKER_11]: Freak

14:41.463 --> 14:47.946
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, um, cause, alright, they got their fifth mix machine in at the Boomtown Casino in, um, Biloxi, Mississippi.

14:48.947 --> 14:51.728
[SPEAKER_11]: And they had never seen a fifth mix before.

14:51.848 --> 14:53.729
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is after Max 2 had just come out.

14:54.189 --> 14:59.952
[SPEAKER_11]: So I get up on there, I play my usual thing, you know, I have this tradition where I always start off with Superstar Maniac.

15:00.352 --> 15:01.893
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't really matter what machine it's on.

15:02.733 --> 15:09.417
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, I just played, like, this big Maniac set and, like, for the first time I full comboed, uh, what did I play?

15:11.118 --> 15:13.039
[SPEAKER_11]: Dropout, Trick, Hidden, something.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.579
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I just was playing around.

15:14.919 --> 15:17.061
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're like, oh my god, who are you?

15:17.601 --> 15:19.922
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, oh, well, I go by DarkSakura.

15:20.422 --> 15:20.942
[SPEAKER_11]: That's you?

15:21.423 --> 15:22.003
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god!

15:22.523 --> 15:33.188
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's like if you have a prominent name on any of the national boards or anything like that, then people know who you are and they're like, oh my god, that's you.

15:34.189 --> 15:34.969
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just really weird.

15:35.730 --> 15:37.351
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for me, they're like, you're Mormon?

15:37.531 --> 15:38.031
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

15:40.973 --> 15:41.413
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

15:44.474 --> 15:44.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncomfortable.

15:44.975 --> 15:52.018
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, our chat room is getting insanely popular, so I was opting a few people there to help police the chat room when we can't take an eye on things here.

15:53.218 --> 15:54.259
[SPEAKER_03]: It is pretty big today.

15:54.379 --> 15:54.579
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

15:55.359 --> 15:56.419
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, everybody.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.560
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody in chat room.

15:58.380 --> 16:03.422
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, we even have the... Let's see who we have in the chat room today.

16:03.442 --> 16:05.543
[SPEAKER_11]: We have SoCalKicks, Joe Mama.

16:06.624 --> 16:09.305
[SPEAKER_11]: We have... God, lots of people.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.765
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, it's the people who are actually here.

16:13.225 --> 16:15.246
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, Bradley, you're in two places at once.

16:15.406 --> 16:16.026
[SPEAKER_11]: How special.

16:19.968 --> 16:20.428
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

16:20.548 --> 16:22.149
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your evil twin skippy.

16:22.529 --> 16:29.652
[SPEAKER_03]: I just gave ops to people that are long-time listeners to the show here, so I thought they'd be able to police all right, because they know what we do here on the show.

16:30.754 --> 16:31.494
[SPEAKER_11]: and just what do we do.

16:31.814 --> 16:37.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, will we just talk about anything Bomani and then just other crap that we feel like talking about?

16:37.596 --> 16:39.337
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about whatever we want here on the show, right?

16:39.757 --> 16:40.477
[SPEAKER_11]: We talk about it.

16:40.777 --> 16:42.258
[SPEAKER_11]: If it exists, we can talk about it.

16:42.558 --> 16:42.858
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

16:43.798 --> 16:48.119
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so we have Mel B and Melody coming next week.

16:48.139 --> 16:49.020
[SPEAKER_03]: That's big news for the show.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.060
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be expanding our playlist, other big news for the show.

16:52.461 --> 16:56.542
[SPEAKER_03]: We might also be starting to do some other random live things.

16:57.242 --> 16:57.542
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh.

16:57.562 --> 16:57.843
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh.

16:57.863 --> 16:58.143
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

17:25.720 --> 17:26.741
[SPEAKER_03]: None of us seem to have it.

17:26.801 --> 17:32.564
[SPEAKER_03]: We know some people out there do have it, thankfully, but we're not getting ours until mid-next week, so we couldn't do our six-style tribute tonight.

17:33.024 --> 17:47.512
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I've got some tracks from the V-Rare 2 CD, and if you pre-ordered stuff from Konami Style, then you would have gotten this special CD, this V-Rare 2 CD, which had some tracks on it, and I'm going to play some of those tracks for you.

17:47.792 --> 17:54.436
[SPEAKER_03]: And rumor is that this also works as an appendix, although I haven't had that confirmed yet, so I don't know what's going to happen with that.

17:56.047 --> 18:03.609
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're going to do a tribute to Sixth Style next week because we'll have it and we can... That'll be even more special because it'll be show number six.

18:03.629 --> 18:04.849
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be show number six.

18:04.969 --> 18:07.310
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be show six style, yeah.

18:07.490 --> 18:07.850
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

18:11.271 --> 18:13.192
[SPEAKER_03]: So... So what else do you want to talk about?

18:13.212 --> 18:14.352
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to take another break real fast?

18:14.372 --> 18:14.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to...

18:15.441 --> 18:19.764
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, why don't we go ahead and let them hear something different for a bit?

18:20.104 --> 18:21.545
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, let's play those songs.

18:21.565 --> 18:23.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go ahead and play those songs from the VRare 2 CD.

18:24.247 --> 18:29.711
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to come back and we're going to talk about the big news this week concerning the Konami of America coin-op division.

18:29.751 --> 18:30.772
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that when we get back.

18:30.792 --> 18:42.360
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, I'm going to play Megu with Stick Around and LED with the Mix-Up Dungeon J. And I'm having a request in the chat room for a Strong Jager, so maybe we'll work that in, too.

18:42.500 --> 18:42.860
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.

23:11.422 --> 23:12.087
Thanks for watching!

28:28.209 --> 28:32.333
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

28:32.553 --> 28:34.275
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to be exactly like Hollywood?

28:34.315 --> 28:34.675
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

28:34.815 --> 28:38.398
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we care what people think of us?

28:39.019 --> 28:40.861
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

28:40.881 --> 28:42.322
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

28:42.762 --> 28:43.823
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes!

28:46.813 --> 28:48.634
[SPEAKER_12]: Extreme Babani Radio.

28:48.874 --> 28:51.536
[SPEAKER_12]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

28:51.776 --> 28:58.039
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we just played for you some stuff from the 6th Style V-Rare 2 CD.

28:58.539 --> 29:00.840
[SPEAKER_03]: Some hidden tracks that you can find in 6th Style.

29:00.860 --> 29:04.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Megu with Stick Around, the full version, and LED with a strong Jaeger.

29:05.383 --> 29:06.343
[SPEAKER_03]: As in Jaegermeister.

29:06.563 --> 29:07.344
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was exciting.

29:07.364 --> 29:07.944
[SPEAKER_03]: The full version.

29:08.184 --> 29:10.045
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm tingly just from hearing that song.

29:10.786 --> 29:12.787
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been moist and tingly tonight, Jamie.

29:12.907 --> 29:14.208
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I feel like I have a disease.

29:15.652 --> 29:18.174
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the racking pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.

29:18.634 --> 29:20.755
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene's got this look on her face of like, dear God.

29:21.656 --> 29:23.297
[SPEAKER_03]: This show is resorted to potty jokes.

29:24.257 --> 29:25.939
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, anyway.

29:26.339 --> 29:30.561
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to give our condolences to a long-time supporter of Orange Lounge Radio.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.343
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been around since the first couple episodes.

29:33.363 --> 29:35.224
[SPEAKER_03]: That's SCK SoCalKicks.

29:35.264 --> 29:39.527
[SPEAKER_03]: Had a website, and unfortunately due to some server issues, it is no more.

29:39.927 --> 29:41.709
[SPEAKER_03]: He has no website right now.

29:41.809 --> 29:42.129
[SPEAKER_03]: He can't...

29:42.729 --> 29:43.149
[SPEAKER_03]: Host it!

29:43.529 --> 29:50.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so if you have any posting space that you'd like to host, a cool little DDR website all about the SoCal scene and then some.

29:50.733 --> 29:52.913
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a lot of information about U.S.

29:53.454 --> 29:55.635
[SPEAKER_03]: Bomani releases, domestic Bomani releases.

29:55.675 --> 29:57.115
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always up to news on that kind of stuff.

29:57.615 --> 30:00.117
[SPEAKER_03]: And he has a good little edit database going.

30:00.557 --> 30:06.379
[SPEAKER_03]: So go ahead and send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and we'll pass it along to him.

30:06.759 --> 30:07.640
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

30:08.861 --> 30:09.361
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're welcome.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, because he's saying thank you in the chatroom.

30:11.863 --> 30:12.223
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're welcome.

30:12.243 --> 30:13.144
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you're very welcome.

30:13.464 --> 30:14.645
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been a long time supporter of the show.

30:15.045 --> 30:16.026
[SPEAKER_11]: You hosted my edits.

30:16.206 --> 30:16.787
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really cool.

30:16.947 --> 30:17.127
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

30:17.947 --> 30:20.189
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we've got some news going on.

30:20.950 --> 30:23.812
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday was the big Castro Valley Golf Land Tournament.

30:24.312 --> 30:28.836
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, that kind of goes into an FU of the Week, actually, for me anyway.

30:28.876 --> 30:31.418
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want to give Jamie's FU of the Week first.

30:31.798 --> 30:34.160
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's let Jamie give her FU of the Week.

30:36.275 --> 30:42.277
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, my FU of the week is directed towards, drumroll please, AT&T.

30:42.757 --> 30:43.537
[SPEAKER_03]: AT&T.

30:43.977 --> 30:44.817
[SPEAKER_11]: AT&T.

30:45.257 --> 30:48.818
[SPEAKER_11]: The only company that I've seen that has the Death Star as their logo.

30:49.078 --> 30:50.899
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they are truly the evil empire.

30:52.059 --> 30:55.380
[SPEAKER_11]: I have been at home, unemployed, now...

30:56.129 --> 30:56.509
[SPEAKER_11]: Happily.

30:56.789 --> 30:57.409
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not really.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.430
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, that's off the subject.

30:59.670 --> 31:07.712
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I've been sitting at home for the past week and a half trying to go online and play my addiction, Ragnarok Online, only to have my cable crap out.

31:08.592 --> 31:13.593
[SPEAKER_11]: I will be sitting online, happily gaining levels, even if disconnected from the server.

31:13.753 --> 31:14.033
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

31:14.733 --> 31:22.075
[SPEAKER_11]: I go downstairs, look at my little connector thing for my modem, and it's blinking lights all over the place, and then it just stops.

31:23.078 --> 31:29.140
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have to hop on dial-up, then it comes back, then I have to get back on, and it does this at least five times a day.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.041
[SPEAKER_11]: AT&T is truly a company run by the Antichrist.

31:33.821 --> 31:36.742
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so I'm looking for new service.

31:36.782 --> 31:39.262
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody has good suggestions, I'm open to them.

31:39.723 --> 31:40.963
[SPEAKER_11]: AT&T just needs to die.

31:42.460 --> 31:51.682
[SPEAKER_03]: I also hate AT&T because we have their cable, and they charge us way too much for it, and we don't get BBC America, and we don't get M2.

31:52.062 --> 31:54.063
[SPEAKER_03]: So what am I supposed to do for watching music videos?

31:54.103 --> 31:55.743
[SPEAKER_03]: Because MTV sure as hell doesn't play them.

31:56.703 --> 31:57.703
[SPEAKER_11]: That's for damn sure.

31:59.904 --> 32:03.044
[SPEAKER_11]: MTV hasn't played videos since, like, the 90s began.

32:04.545 --> 32:07.805
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, they played videos up through them because we had 120 Minutes, we had...

32:12.099 --> 32:14.182
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but like, MTV has Sorority Life.

32:14.963 --> 32:16.525
[SPEAKER_06]: The new reality show!

32:17.286 --> 32:18.447
[SPEAKER_06]: It took place in Davis, by the way.

32:19.649 --> 32:20.350
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, that is true.

32:20.370 --> 32:21.791
[SPEAKER_11]: More than the reason not to watch.

32:22.352 --> 32:23.734
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually did see that at AX.

32:23.754 --> 32:25.937
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw when they put the rocks up on the side of the hill.

32:27.139 --> 32:29.760
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is that what they all do by the big bridge?

32:29.960 --> 32:31.821
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a pledge thingy.

32:31.841 --> 32:32.802
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, to hell with MTV.

32:32.942 --> 32:34.363
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an FU of the Week as well.

32:35.283 --> 32:36.964
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought of this before the show started.

32:37.825 --> 32:40.186
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided I needed a theme song for my FU of the Week as well.

32:40.286 --> 32:41.086
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, mine's cooler.

32:41.426 --> 32:42.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yours is cooler.

32:42.207 --> 32:43.067
[SPEAKER_10]: Mine's fucked up.

32:45.749 --> 32:51.431
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, my issue... Oh, it's being suggested that your FU of the Week should have been this.

32:51.852 --> 32:52.492
[SPEAKER_11]: Duplo Web.

32:52.572 --> 32:52.852
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.173
[SPEAKER_11]: Freaking Duplo Web.

32:55.794 --> 32:56.074
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

32:57.074 --> 33:00.156
[SPEAKER_11]: I have been working for nearly a month on DarkSakura.com.

33:00.176 --> 33:01.157
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting my pages up.

33:01.177 --> 33:01.937
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks really pretty.

33:01.957 --> 33:03.659
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad nobody else can see it.

33:16.440 --> 33:24.003
[SPEAKER_11]: because I keep getting these emails that say, we're relocating the server, oh, we relocated again, oh, the server's now shoved somewhere up our ass, you know, we're puking it now.

33:24.744 --> 33:29.066
[SPEAKER_11]: So, at this point, I'm about ready to say, fuck DuploWeb again.

33:29.226 --> 33:33.988
[SPEAKER_11]: And for the people in the chatroom who are wondering, go to www.duploweb.com and you'll see how crappy they are.

33:34.948 --> 33:37.329
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'm looking for a new service for that as well.

33:37.770 --> 33:40.591
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have suggestions, please let me know, as long as you pay for it.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.636
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, can I finish?

33:43.816 --> 33:44.216
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

33:44.336 --> 33:44.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

33:45.157 --> 33:45.357
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

33:45.377 --> 33:45.918
[SPEAKER_10]: No, my turn!

33:45.938 --> 33:46.338
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

33:46.358 --> 33:46.638
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

33:46.658 --> 33:49.581
[SPEAKER_10]: I have part three, and my other fuck of the week goes toward my big toe.

33:49.761 --> 33:49.941
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

33:52.824 --> 33:53.044
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

33:53.124 --> 33:53.384
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

33:53.584 --> 33:55.086
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna try to do my FU of the week now.

33:55.706 --> 33:55.987
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

33:56.307 --> 33:56.727
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may.

33:56.747 --> 33:57.568
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, one more thing, one more thing.

33:57.628 --> 33:58.088
[SPEAKER_10]: Jesus Christ.

33:58.209 --> 33:58.969
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here you go.

34:03.393 --> 34:05.755
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week is Jamie, because she, no.

34:06.136 --> 34:06.216
[SPEAKER_03]: My...

34:09.187 --> 34:12.510
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week is my sleep schedule.

34:14.992 --> 34:20.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Because not only did I sleep until 3 o'clock today, I slept for 13 hours last night.

34:22.618 --> 34:24.399
[SPEAKER_03]: I slept yesterday.

34:25.678 --> 34:30.482
[SPEAKER_03]: I slept yesterday just long enough to miss CVGL completely.

34:30.862 --> 34:43.653
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to go for a couple hours and it was great because I had my little remote kit I was going to take and I was going to do interviews for this show and I was going to do all this stuff and hopefully get to meet some people and get interviews with winners and all that stuff.

34:44.033 --> 34:45.355
[SPEAKER_03]: But I slept too damn much.

34:45.855 --> 34:48.557
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did not get to go to CVGL.

34:49.138 --> 34:49.278
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

34:52.140 --> 34:57.524
[SPEAKER_03]: My problem is my clock and for that I give an F you to my sleep clock.

34:57.544 --> 35:00.286
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also taking suggestions and collections to buy Robin your alarm clock.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.847
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm being told to get an alarm clock.

35:02.947 --> 35:03.688
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work.

35:03.748 --> 35:04.708
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work this weekend.

35:04.728 --> 35:05.469
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have my one.

35:05.509 --> 35:08.070
[SPEAKER_11]: We can buy one and duct tape it to your head.

35:08.271 --> 35:14.875
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sleeping at my own house and that's all that needs to be said.

35:15.535 --> 35:17.157
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a suggestion from Irene.

35:17.237 --> 35:17.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene, yes.

35:18.137 --> 35:18.578
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?

35:19.078 --> 35:24.602
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I said take laxatives before you go to bed so you'll have to take a shit really bad in the morning and you'll be forced to wake up.

35:25.876 --> 35:27.937
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to say something to Jabberwocky in the chat room.

35:28.158 --> 35:29.959
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't understand anything you're saying at all.

35:29.999 --> 35:30.419
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

35:31.140 --> 35:31.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

35:34.362 --> 35:35.142
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving right along.

35:35.262 --> 35:36.603
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, and a poopy pancake to you.

35:36.964 --> 35:38.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, moving right along.

35:38.424 --> 35:40.966
[SPEAKER_03]: That relates, by the way, to the other show.

35:41.887 --> 35:45.229
[SPEAKER_03]: UnderstationLive.org Listen to it.

35:45.269 --> 35:46.390
[SPEAKER_03]: It broadcasts on Saturday night.

35:46.430 --> 35:47.631
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like this, you'll love that.

35:47.751 --> 35:48.011
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

35:48.571 --> 35:49.111
[SPEAKER_11]: The 630 to 930.

35:49.612 --> 35:52.813
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about the winners at CVGL, because I wanted to talk about that.

35:52.853 --> 35:54.314
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still have that up on the screen over there, Matt?

35:56.175 --> 35:56.595
[SPEAKER_03]: Who won?

35:56.655 --> 35:59.656
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some people that listen to this show ended up placing, so that's pretty cool.

35:59.676 --> 36:01.697
[SPEAKER_11]: We will pass the microphone now to Matt.

36:03.197 --> 36:07.682
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, for Perfect Attack, first place went to Virtu, no, Corey.

36:08.923 --> 36:09.724
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

36:09.804 --> 36:10.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, Corey!

36:11.506 --> 36:15.831
[SPEAKER_06]: Second place went to Tigger Eugene, or I hope I pronounced that right.

36:16.832 --> 36:18.874
[SPEAKER_06]: And then third place went to Emphasis.

36:20.235 --> 36:20.956
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you go!

36:22.037 --> 36:24.360
[SPEAKER_06]: And for Freestyle, let me see here real quick.

36:27.634 --> 36:33.599
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, third place went to Hypnotics with his Secret Rendezvous routine.

36:35.121 --> 36:36.762
[SPEAKER_06]: Second place went to... That's a local boy!

36:36.942 --> 36:37.643
[SPEAKER_06]: Go Hypnotics!

36:37.703 --> 36:37.963
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo!

36:38.203 --> 36:42.767
[SPEAKER_06]: Second place went to Nobody Gin for their High Is Off You routine.

36:44.509 --> 36:50.034
[SPEAKER_06]: And also first place went to Sweet Banana AJ for the jazz routine.

36:50.414 --> 36:52.456
[SPEAKER_03]: My sweet, my sweet banana...

36:53.729 --> 36:56.271
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I hear that song, I think of the Abra, Abra.

36:56.692 --> 37:00.615
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you noticed how many Parapara songs are rip-offs of old 80 tunes that steal the tunes?

37:01.456 --> 37:04.198
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that one, and then there's... Irene, you know some of these.

37:04.278 --> 37:06.360
[SPEAKER_03]: The Parasongs that sound like other normal songs.

37:06.540 --> 37:07.801
The Ghostbusters song.

37:08.442 --> 37:08.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one's that?

37:09.042 --> 37:13.146
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be... Oh, Deluxe.

37:13.846 --> 37:15.688
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's Aishitai Masu.

37:15.788 --> 37:16.308
[SPEAKER_03]: Aishitai Masu.

37:16.809 --> 37:16.969
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

37:19.820 --> 37:20.020
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?

37:20.040 --> 37:21.041
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one that rips off.

37:21.401 --> 37:24.683
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking Highway to Hell, but that's High Energy from DDR Solo.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.204
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sounds just like Highway to Hell.

37:26.244 --> 37:35.008
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll pick song titles too and make up whole Eurobeat songs, like Like a Virgin.

37:35.028 --> 37:38.350
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the other one that had Don't Stand So Close to Me?

37:38.370 --> 37:39.250
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

37:39.270 --> 37:40.171
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't Stand So Close?

37:40.511 --> 37:41.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, whatever.

37:43.567 --> 37:51.273
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know, the whole thing is that just about every song that was in Parapara was on one of the million initial D soundtracks.

37:53.214 --> 37:54.055
[SPEAKER_11]: And they all say fire.

37:54.075 --> 37:54.735
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Ari?

37:54.755 --> 37:55.716
[SPEAKER_03]: They all say fire.

37:55.736 --> 37:56.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they all say fire.

37:58.666 --> 38:02.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, PVP is a really old thing to be talking about, but actually, locally, it's still kind of new to us.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.649
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had a machine until about two months ago.

38:06.449 --> 38:09.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but para para, I don't know, it's kind of getting old for me, but whatever.

38:10.391 --> 38:12.692
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I think I have an answer to your not waking up.

38:13.392 --> 38:13.773
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

38:13.873 --> 38:20.035
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember on Tech TV, on the show The Screensavers, they reviewed an alarm clock called the Screaming Mimi 110.

38:21.036 --> 38:25.718
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's a 110 decibel alarm clock, which is equivalent to a jet airplane.

38:25.758 --> 38:25.938
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

38:26.158 --> 38:26.858
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

38:27.118 --> 38:33.361
[SPEAKER_03]: My old roommate, my very first roommate, when I moved out of the dorms in college, I moved into an apartment, and my roommate had one of those clocks.

38:33.701 --> 38:34.641
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just one of those clocks.

38:34.661 --> 38:35.302
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a clock.

38:35.382 --> 38:38.103
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an alarm clock for deaf people, is what it was.

38:38.523 --> 38:40.203
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so loud every time it went off.

38:40.964 --> 38:46.746
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, my old apartment, I lived right by train tracks, so every time a train went by, I could sleep right through that.

38:46.766 --> 38:48.687
[SPEAKER_03]: But his alarm clock always woke me up.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.247
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounded like a plane was landing in his room.

38:50.287 --> 38:50.708
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like...

38:52.648 --> 38:55.590
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so incredibly loud, you would not even believe.

38:56.270 --> 39:04.494
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what was funny is also, they were reviewing the fact that there's Screaming Me 220, which I just can't imagine that.

39:05.835 --> 39:07.816
[SPEAKER_11]: That's for people who actually want to be deaf.

39:11.138 --> 39:13.679
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a long call for people who want to be deaf.

39:14.259 --> 39:16.280
[SPEAKER_03]: I could only live with that guy for six months.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and his clock.

39:17.441 --> 39:20.202
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe it's like for, you know, rock stars who are deaf anyway.

39:21.283 --> 39:21.683
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you think?

39:27.449 --> 39:33.097
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize to any speakers that were blown out by my impersonation of my old roommate's alarm clock.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.181
[SPEAKER_11]: And he held the microphone pretty far away.

39:38.269 --> 39:42.873
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having a suggestion in the chatroom from Pyroman saying to wake up to let them move every morning.

39:44.214 --> 39:45.395
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll get you right out of bed.

39:45.415 --> 39:46.296
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just put it this way.

39:46.336 --> 39:47.397
[SPEAKER_03]: That won't make me get out of bed.

39:47.417 --> 39:48.618
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll make me want to end my life.

39:48.819 --> 39:52.462
[SPEAKER_03]: The screaming 220 can be heard up to a mile away.

39:53.783 --> 39:54.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

39:54.744 --> 39:58.388
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, no.

39:58.528 --> 39:58.648
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

39:59.910 --> 40:00.330
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

40:01.331 --> 40:07.436
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, in case you missed last week's show, by the way, we did determine the worst Mamani song in history next to Let Them Move.

40:07.857 --> 40:09.698
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was Bye Bye Baby Balloon.

40:09.998 --> 40:12.260
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bye Bye Baby Balloon will never be played on this.

40:12.300 --> 40:13.581
[SPEAKER_03]: And this wasn't just our decision.

40:13.621 --> 40:14.082
[SPEAKER_03]: We helped.

40:14.362 --> 40:18.265
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was the chat room that ultimately decided that Bye Bye Baby Balloon was the worst Mamani song ever.

40:18.285 --> 40:19.767
[SPEAKER_11]: It still gets a mention in one of our provos.

40:20.267 --> 40:20.647
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.

40:20.747 --> 40:21.388
[SPEAKER_03]: It does get a mention.

40:21.408 --> 40:22.269
[SPEAKER_03]: But we, you know.

40:22.589 --> 40:23.350
[SPEAKER_11]: But we won't play the song.

40:23.370 --> 40:23.930
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we won't play it.

40:26.493 --> 40:30.661
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone hasn't heard the promo, it's declared as crap.

40:31.202 --> 40:32.003
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's why.

40:33.205 --> 40:34.387
[SPEAKER_11]: And crap stinks, so flush it.

40:35.048 --> 40:35.269
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

40:37.363 --> 40:38.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about another big news item.

40:38.844 --> 40:43.087
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been the biggest news in the DDR scene in forever.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.407
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read this.

40:44.427 --> 40:48.510
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in Replay Magazine, which is an industry magazine for arcade coin-ops.

40:48.870 --> 40:50.671
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, Konami's U.S.

40:50.711 --> 40:52.212
[SPEAKER_03]: coin-op office is to close.

40:52.552 --> 41:03.539
[SPEAKER_03]: The Konami of America's coin-op office in Buffalo Grove, Illinois will close its doors at the end of September with future game sales being handled by an as-yet-to-be-named third-party exclusive distributor in the U.S.,

41:04.139 --> 41:05.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Factory execs in the U.S.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.843
[SPEAKER_03]: have yet to issue a public statement confirming the move.

41:07.923 --> 41:11.626
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is still kind of hearsay at this point, but it's pretty much been widely determined.

41:11.646 --> 41:16.891
[SPEAKER_03]: There was speculation before this news item hit, and now it's kind of just being more and more confirmed.

41:17.551 --> 41:29.382
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the Japanese manufacturer, which has a consumer game office in California and gaming operations in Nevada, will maintain a small service department to handle support for its existing units in the field, like all those silent scope machines.

41:29.982 --> 41:40.530
[SPEAKER_03]: According to what Replay Magazine has so far, Konami is also expected to exhibit at this fall's AMOA Expo in Las Vegas, possibly with their new sales and marketing partner.

41:40.570 --> 41:43.332
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's been quite an interesting story lately.

41:43.953 --> 41:47.976
[SPEAKER_03]: People are saying, oh, that's it, DDR is dead in the US.

41:49.096 --> 41:50.017
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't go that far.

41:50.277 --> 41:52.539
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's kind of screaming that the sky is falling.

41:52.719 --> 41:57.282
[SPEAKER_11]: It never once said that they were going to, you know, not manufacture the games 100%.

41:58.342 --> 41:59.543
[SPEAKER_11]: They have another distributor.

42:00.484 --> 42:04.406
[SPEAKER_03]: And they still don't appear to give a shit about imports, so hey, I think we're going to be okay.

42:04.806 --> 42:13.211
[SPEAKER_11]: No, so that's another thing, Austin, to put an end to that rumor that was brought to our attention last week, too, regarding, you know, them hunting down Dromania machines and taking them out.

42:13.852 --> 42:18.995
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, go after, you know, all two copies of pop music that are in, you know, the country.

42:19.750 --> 42:21.352
[SPEAKER_03]: So we still don't know what's going to happen with DDR.

42:21.412 --> 42:22.473
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be a good thing.

42:22.513 --> 42:30.843
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe this third-party distributor is going to take something like Max 2, just make it, you know, maybe have some... I don't know how it all works, really, in the industry.

42:30.863 --> 42:34.968
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Konami makes it better, or they help make it better, and then, you know, put it out.

42:35.048 --> 42:38.673
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe this third-party distributor is going to listen to us, you know, really good.

42:39.293 --> 42:49.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, working at a video distributor company, it's pretty much a lot of the companies out there that manufacture machines and distribute them, they want to cut costs.

42:49.135 --> 42:52.576
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only way they can do that is not distribute them and go third party.

42:52.596 --> 42:57.397
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way it saves on them having shipping facilities and all that kind of stuff.

42:57.797 --> 42:59.118
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're going to cut costs that way.

42:59.138 --> 43:00.498
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't mean they're not going to make any gains.

43:00.518 --> 43:05.199
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going through someone else to distribute them, which is really common in all the industries out there.

43:06.140 --> 43:16.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think maybe it's possible that this third party distributor is going to come out and go, okay, we've got a problem with these imports because we're trying to put out a new USA mix here and we've got a problem with your imports.

43:16.601 --> 43:17.343
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that might happen?

43:17.717 --> 43:19.338
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they have nothing to say with it.

43:19.519 --> 43:26.865
[SPEAKER_06]: All the distributors do is take someone's game and basically sell that product to whoever.

43:26.945 --> 43:27.806
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all they do.

43:27.886 --> 43:30.328
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't do anything as far as recalling games.

43:30.428 --> 43:31.228
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all Konami.

43:31.289 --> 43:33.410
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're nothing but highly trained monkeys, basically.

43:34.371 --> 43:35.432
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm getting nodded yes.

43:36.853 --> 43:41.195
[SPEAKER_03]: And DDR Max USA, not affected from what we hear so far.

43:41.636 --> 43:43.376
[SPEAKER_03]: Still looking to be a damn good release.

43:43.436 --> 43:45.698
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be the biggest home release of DDR ever.

43:45.718 --> 43:47.158
[SPEAKER_03]: 65-something songs.

43:48.979 --> 43:49.359
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

43:49.460 --> 43:53.442
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe possibly the only thing that could be affected is any kind of arcade link.

43:53.502 --> 43:54.222
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows what happens?

43:54.362 --> 43:55.463
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they don't know what's going to happen yet.

43:55.483 --> 43:56.283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only coin-op.

43:56.423 --> 43:56.643
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

43:56.663 --> 44:02.145
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the thing is, they're still selling their own home games online.

44:02.185 --> 44:05.506
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Konami makes, you know, a good number of games.

44:05.766 --> 44:10.567
[SPEAKER_11]: And even so, you know, they've still got, you know, like they're keeping that small servicing up.

44:10.587 --> 44:15.809
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, they still have tons of classic games out that are going to be servicing, like the Turtles in Time at Roseville Golf Land.

44:16.409 --> 44:18.450
[SPEAKER_11]: That game is so cool.

44:20.830 --> 44:21.951
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we are geeks.

44:24.514 --> 44:26.616
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, we digress.

44:27.296 --> 44:36.063
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got so many games that have been released as far as arcade games that are going to need that servicing in the future, so it's a good thing that they keep that office open.

44:36.504 --> 44:39.086
[SPEAKER_11]: Their distributor is not really going to be able to do much about that anyway.

44:40.829 --> 44:42.891
[SPEAKER_03]: Jabberwocky has a very good point in our chat room.

44:43.011 --> 44:44.292
[SPEAKER_03]: It's saying it's not a bad move.

44:44.412 --> 44:45.553
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the movie industry.

44:45.733 --> 44:50.578
[SPEAKER_03]: They work the exact same way, and they're pretty darn good at distributing the movies to the theaters.

44:51.139 --> 44:53.941
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe this is just going to get DDR out there even more.

44:54.782 --> 44:55.523
[SPEAKER_11]: I can even say that.

44:55.543 --> 44:55.823
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

44:56.264 --> 44:58.085
[SPEAKER_03]: You did kind of just say the same damn thing.

44:58.126 --> 44:59.307
[SPEAKER_03]: But you work for...

45:00.207 --> 45:04.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Thinking about it as video and thinking about the actual movie is two different things.

45:04.888 --> 45:07.549
[SPEAKER_11]: I worked in the mortgage industry for two years.

45:07.669 --> 45:24.672
[SPEAKER_11]: A mortgage company or a bank is often going to buy out a third-party servicer to handle loans, collections, because it's too much money that's going to cost them to train, to have these people hired, trained to take care of the employee base.

45:24.752 --> 45:28.473
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look at it from that standpoint as well, Konami is a corporation.

45:29.433 --> 45:31.774
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to save them a lot of money over time.

45:32.374 --> 45:35.795
[SPEAKER_11]: Less money that they spend on actually having to worry about the distribution.

45:35.835 --> 45:38.836
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be more money put into other things.

45:38.976 --> 45:41.616
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like it's not the end of the world.

45:42.517 --> 45:46.918
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some things are going to change, but it sounds like for the most part, it can't be a totally bad thing.

45:46.958 --> 45:48.078
[SPEAKER_03]: It might just be better.

45:48.098 --> 45:49.399
[SPEAKER_03]: It might get DDR some more exposure.

45:49.419 --> 45:52.019
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to hopefully do some things that Konami wasn't able to do.

45:52.499 --> 45:56.521
[SPEAKER_03]: And Max USA still sounds like it's going to be pretty kick-ass.

45:56.541 --> 45:57.401
[SPEAKER_11]: That is going to be a winner.

45:58.905 --> 46:01.386
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 new songs that haven't been in any mix yet

46:20.473 --> 46:21.474
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching.

46:21.495 --> 46:21.855
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.

46:39.097 --> 46:41.338
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:03.010 --> 47:09.200
[SPEAKER_03]: and MixUpDenjinJ, which is the full version we're going to hear, which is another one of these six-style hidden tracks.

47:09.660 --> 47:13.026
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be somewhat of a long break, but we'll come back right about 8 o'clock.

47:13.146 --> 47:15.830
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll try to get to as many requests as I can for the night's up.

50:49.890 --> 50:50.932
Thanks for watching!

52:03.751 --> 52:07.013
Thanks for watching!

52:32.854 --> 52:33.655
Thanks for watching!

54:26.375 --> 54:26.818
Thanks for watching!

55:07.982 --> 55:08.606
Thanks for watching!

56:38.670 --> 56:39.639
Thanks for watching!

57:06.838 --> 57:07.680
Thanks for watching!

58:00.862 --> 58:06.527
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge by Money Music and More show?

58:06.807 --> 58:13.953
[SPEAKER_02]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

58:14.293 --> 58:16.255
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unearthly.

58:16.495 --> 58:20.218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

58:20.580 --> 58:21.081
[SPEAKER_03]: Euromix 2 Euromix 2

58:40.305 --> 58:45.671
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, Euromix 1 was out in the UK for quite a while now.

58:45.871 --> 58:51.637
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been using the old third mix engine that we're all familiar with from USA.

58:52.538 --> 58:56.482
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it's really old, so they decided to update their new thing.

58:56.522 --> 58:58.504
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually Euromix 2 or Euromax.

58:59.284 --> 59:03.389
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably going to use either, I'm guessing it would be the DDR Max 2 engine for it.

59:03.869 --> 59:04.489
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

59:24.702 --> 59:28.004
[SPEAKER_06]: The song list is pretty good, actually.

59:28.045 --> 59:32.328
[SPEAKER_06]: They've teamed up with EMI Records and also Zumba Records.

59:33.289 --> 59:34.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Britney Spears' Zumba?

59:35.391 --> 59:35.671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

59:35.912 --> 59:36.632
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dear God.

59:36.732 --> 59:39.375
[SPEAKER_06]: But, well, it's okay.

59:39.575 --> 59:44.719
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a few songs I've heard of, like 5678 by The Steps.

59:44.780 --> 59:45.500
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know what, Matt?

59:45.520 --> 59:48.983
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have 5678 by The Steps queued up here, so let's hear a little bit of this.

59:50.097 --> 59:51.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't I good here?

59:51.158 --> 59:52.318
[SPEAKER_03]: We got one of these songs.

59:52.358 --> 59:55.420
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a preview of what one of the new Euromix songs is going to be like.

59:55.440 --> 59:56.680
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to play a little bit of it here for you.

59:57.440 --> 59:59.141
Kind of a little bit repetitive here.

59:59.161 --> 01:00:01.562
No, this is not the song that Billy had to dance to.

01:00:01.602 --> 01:00:03.123
That song was called Tragedy.

01:00:15.512 --> 01:00:17.132
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of what it's on.

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:21.134
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of probably going to have a lot of little 12th notes in it or something.

01:00:21.154 --> 01:00:24.154
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, it sounds much like Cowgirl or something like that.

01:00:27.175 --> 01:00:28.416
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, something like that.

01:00:28.856 --> 01:00:29.696
[SPEAKER_03]: Boot scootin' baby.

01:00:29.716 --> 01:00:31.456
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like club country music.

01:00:31.516 --> 01:00:32.217
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know.

01:00:32.757 --> 01:00:38.438
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny because one of the other songs in there is going to be Cotton Eye Joe, which is a country sounding song.

01:00:38.458 --> 01:00:40.319
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Cotton Eye Joe is going to be in there.

01:00:40.859 --> 01:00:44.220
[SPEAKER_19]: And unfortunately, it looks like Let Them Move is going to be on there, too.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.542
[SPEAKER_11]: That means that people get to hear me scream loudly.

01:00:48.363 --> 01:00:48.804
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

01:00:50.045 --> 01:00:55.089
[SPEAKER_03]: This again, in case you missed it, playing in the background is 5678 by Steps, which is going to be one of the new songs in Euromix.

01:00:55.130 --> 01:01:02.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the other new songs will be Caribbean Queen by Billy Ocean, Aaron's Party, Come and Get It by Aaron Carter.

01:01:03.117 --> 01:01:03.858
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.261
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wet.

01:01:06.981 --> 01:01:09.122
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't try to stop it by Roman Holiday.

01:01:10.563 --> 01:01:13.845
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, I Want You to Want Me by Solid Harmony.

01:01:14.025 --> 01:01:16.426
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that I want you to want me?

01:01:16.766 --> 01:01:18.467
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably a cover of the old Cheap Trick song.

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:22.529
[SPEAKER_06]: The Vibe is Right by Ruby Turner.

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:28.973
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, let's see, we've got Stomp, also by the Steps, same people that are doing 5, 6, 7, 8.

01:01:29.153 --> 01:01:31.794
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I bet you, Steps is broken up already.

01:01:31.834 --> 01:01:37.157
[SPEAKER_03]: They broke up last year, so it's probably a similar kind of thing to, like, SmileDK, where they're getting all these songs from bands that have been broken up.

01:01:37.637 --> 01:01:38.097
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

01:01:38.457 --> 01:01:41.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, see, then we have That Is In, This Is Now by High Five.

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:51.526
[SPEAKER_06]: What's pretty cool though is they've actually got a lot of the stuff from older mixes that we don't have in our Max 2, but some of it's pretty good.

01:01:51.846 --> 01:01:56.730
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting some of the Max 2 stuff like Living in America and the Reflex and that kind of thing.

01:01:58.111 --> 01:02:05.996
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they're getting some of the Oni songs that were in Max 2 that we aren't getting.

01:02:06.296 --> 01:02:08.397
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Hysteria is one of them, right?

01:02:08.457 --> 01:02:11.099
[SPEAKER_06]: Hysteria 2001 and D4U, the KOGG3 mix.

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:16.362
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting those and Spin the Disc and all that stuff.

01:02:16.402 --> 01:02:17.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad's in the corner whining.

01:02:18.684 --> 01:02:22.226
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, they're going to be having some DDR Max 3 songs in there.

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:29.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they've got some new... These are some of the new originals that we should probably expect for Max 3.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:34.235
[SPEAKER_06]: They have Vanity Angel by Fix.

01:02:34.295 --> 01:02:37.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Memories, it's a new Naoki featuring Paula Terry song.

01:02:39.938 --> 01:02:42.900
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have Crash by Mr. Brian and the Final Band.

01:02:43.161 --> 01:02:45.523
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, back the train the fuck up.

01:02:46.283 --> 01:02:50.767
[SPEAKER_04]: Paula Terry is a very talented young lady, and I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate you guys talking about her like that.

01:02:51.427 --> 01:02:53.068
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but, Brad, it sucks.

01:02:53.209 --> 01:02:54.530
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was the only...

01:02:56.491 --> 01:03:01.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, the Naoki teaching voluntary Oni mode has got to be the best Oni mode there is.

01:03:01.994 --> 01:03:02.574
[SPEAKER_04]: Oni, of course.

01:03:03.434 --> 01:03:05.115
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here we go, here we go.

01:03:05.155 --> 01:03:06.256
[SPEAKER_03]: Go through your little thing.

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:07.816
[SPEAKER_03]: I have something to say about that, Brad.

01:03:07.856 --> 01:03:08.717
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, just a minute.

01:03:08.737 --> 01:03:09.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Your digital reply.

01:03:09.457 --> 01:03:10.218
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, let's see.

01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:12.158
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my reply here somewhere.

01:03:12.178 --> 01:03:12.979
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't browse through your reply.

01:03:12.999 --> 01:03:13.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is it?

01:03:13.539 --> 01:03:14.299
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, here it is.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.921
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that makes me feel warm inside.

01:03:19.202 --> 01:03:19.862
[SPEAKER_11]: Warm and squishy.

01:03:23.225 --> 01:03:29.991
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there have been, I can't say that the music is bad, but Politary can't hold a tune.

01:03:30.291 --> 01:03:31.112
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say this, I'll say this.

01:03:31.452 --> 01:03:39.619
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Email Me, that's a cool one, and I like, yeah, it's Politary, and I like, yeah, it's Politary, and I like, I like Still in My Heart.

01:03:39.739 --> 01:03:40.480
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like that song.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.682
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, Destiny, yuck.

01:03:43.983 --> 01:03:46.565
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is musical harassment, and I don't have to take it.

01:03:47.085 --> 01:03:47.525
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm leaving.

01:03:48.766 --> 01:03:50.308
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go play your Game Boy.

01:03:50.348 --> 01:03:51.168
[SPEAKER_04]: Go play your Game Boy.

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:53.950
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Matt wants to give us news now.

01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:54.491
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt, you want to talk?

01:03:54.511 --> 01:03:54.971
[SPEAKER_03]: We have news.

01:03:55.671 --> 01:03:56.832
[SPEAKER_04]: You hate Politeira too, don't you?

01:03:58.973 --> 01:03:59.954
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you gay?

01:04:01.515 --> 01:04:02.215
[SPEAKER_04]: You're taking the ass.

01:04:02.796 --> 01:04:03.456
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell?

01:04:03.956 --> 01:04:04.717
[SPEAKER_06]: That was random.

01:04:05.577 --> 01:04:05.878
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you gay?

01:04:06.098 --> 01:04:08.159
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, and no.

01:04:11.068 --> 01:04:11.708
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:15.550
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that they don't mention in here is Max Unlimited.

01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:19.772
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably my guess would be they're having some sort of unlocked thing.

01:04:19.792 --> 01:04:21.092
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just being a secret.

01:04:21.112 --> 01:04:21.653
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making it a secret.

01:04:21.673 --> 01:04:23.013
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it's going to be a hidden track.

01:04:23.053 --> 01:04:23.734
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoop-de-doo.

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:27.955
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they're probably getting Burning Heat as another hidden track.

01:04:27.995 --> 01:04:31.397
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're probably going to have some hidden tracks and a similar unlocked system to Max too.

01:04:31.917 --> 01:04:32.477
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray for them.

01:04:33.718 --> 01:04:38.380
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm still planning on eventually one of these days making an edit for Burning Heat and calling it Prep H.

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:47.628
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think that would be a very good title for this test.

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:49.750
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh, uh-oh.

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:51.271
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad went and got backups.

01:04:52.371 --> 01:04:53.172
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Politary.

01:04:53.352 --> 01:04:54.173
[SPEAKER_08]: She's pretty cool.

01:04:54.833 --> 01:04:55.133
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, bye.

01:04:55.153 --> 01:04:56.494
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

01:04:56.614 --> 01:04:57.155
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, bye.

01:05:11.781 --> 01:05:12.181
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.083
[SPEAKER_11]: How many people in the chatroom like Politary?

01:05:14.843 --> 01:05:15.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a quick vote.

01:05:17.165 --> 01:05:20.927
[SPEAKER_03]: Who in the chatroom likes Politary and who thinks Politary just needs to go away?

01:05:21.508 --> 01:05:21.748
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:05:22.569 --> 01:05:26.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead and send in your votes and we'll see what the majority says.

01:05:26.351 --> 01:05:32.115
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times are we going to talk about Politary on the show?

01:05:32.636 --> 01:05:34.217
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times can I work into puking sound?

01:05:35.157 --> 01:05:37.499
[SPEAKER_03]: How many songs total does it look like Euromix is going to be having?

01:05:39.411 --> 01:05:40.355
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me see here.

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:45.800
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot.

01:05:46.221 --> 01:05:47.662
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:05:47.702 --> 01:05:48.482
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to count.

01:05:48.522 --> 01:05:49.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of guess.

01:05:49.063 --> 01:05:55.207
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe they're supposed to have 65 songs other than... I don't know.

01:05:55.427 --> 01:05:56.007
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see here.

01:05:56.588 --> 01:05:56.948
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot?

01:05:58.389 --> 01:05:59.289
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll stick with a lot.

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:02.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and the chat room says, Politary dies.

01:06:03.072 --> 01:06:04.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Politary fucking owns.

01:06:04.513 --> 01:06:06.334
[SPEAKER_03]: Politary is as cool as the center of hell.

01:06:06.614 --> 01:06:07.555
[SPEAKER_03]: Politary sucks.

01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:09.877
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were a redhead, I'd do a rotten.

01:06:10.177 --> 01:06:11.698
[SPEAKER_03]: Politary is a no-talent whore.

01:06:12.138 --> 01:06:13.599
[SPEAKER_03]: And I vote for Osamu Kubota.

01:06:14.099 --> 01:06:14.259
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.684
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

01:06:21.306 --> 01:06:26.772
[SPEAKER_11]: For whoever said that Politary was as cool as the center of hell, you had to have read The Inferno if you meant that in a good way.

01:06:26.792 --> 01:06:30.315
[SPEAKER_11]: Politary is really awesome.

01:06:30.776 --> 01:06:32.077
[SPEAKER_11]: She's from Australia.

01:06:32.918 --> 01:06:33.839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so is Kylie Minogue.

01:06:34.639 --> 01:06:36.421
[SPEAKER_11]: So is Olivia Newton-John, and she did Xanadu.

01:06:36.541 --> 01:06:37.582
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kylie Minogue's good, too.

01:06:43.274 --> 01:06:43.894
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it sounds like 68.

01:06:44.854 --> 01:06:45.834
[SPEAKER_11]: 68, that's the word.

01:06:46.074 --> 01:06:50.595
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I wonder, could this be some kind of example of what we could be seeing with USMAX?

01:06:50.615 --> 01:06:53.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's about how many songs are supposed to be in USMAX.

01:06:55.256 --> 01:06:57.276
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I onto something?

01:06:57.296 --> 01:06:58.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, here would be the difference here.

01:06:59.457 --> 01:07:05.038
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, USMAX, some of the songs wouldn't work just right, especially when it comes to editing them.

01:07:06.318 --> 01:07:10.219
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have probably a Britney Spears song in there, one or two.

01:07:10.239 --> 01:07:12.039
[SPEAKER_06]: Aaron Carter, David and Backstreet Boys.

01:07:12.859 --> 01:07:15.901
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's going to be a boy band somewhere around here.

01:07:17.062 --> 01:07:18.143
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Cher even.

01:07:19.684 --> 01:07:20.985
[SPEAKER_11]: Boycott the boy band.

01:07:24.148 --> 01:07:38.459
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, first of all, I will personally write a scathing letter to Konami of America if there is any... You know, okay, I know that there's people who like boy bands, but don't expect... You know, I'm going to do exactly the same thing I did with the mix of Oops!

01:07:38.499 --> 01:07:41.962
[SPEAKER_11]: I Did It Again and Fifth Mix and never play it and go plug my ears when it's on.

01:07:43.311 --> 01:07:43.691
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here.

01:07:44.312 --> 01:07:45.552
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's been quite adamant in here.

01:07:45.612 --> 01:07:47.473
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we will not have boy bands.

01:07:47.593 --> 01:07:49.354
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody with some insider information there.

01:07:49.374 --> 01:07:54.177
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's going to be the Let Them Trance, you know, the trance version of Let Them Move, of course.

01:07:56.314 --> 01:07:57.134
[SPEAKER_06]: That was horrible.

01:07:57.635 --> 01:07:58.095
[SPEAKER_06]: Boo!

01:07:58.695 --> 01:07:59.656
[SPEAKER_11]: I've let them move.

01:08:01.597 --> 01:08:09.240
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm going to continue to always show my support for Konami, even if, you know, we happen to do get a lot of, you know, get some crappy boy bands and let them move.

01:08:09.861 --> 01:08:16.104
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there are legitimately people who like those songs, although those people also probably have had lobotomies, too.

01:08:17.184 --> 01:08:19.385
[SPEAKER_13]: So... I'm sorry, hold on.

01:08:19.645 --> 01:08:21.185
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen a picture of Politary?

01:08:21.605 --> 01:08:21.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no.

01:08:22.186 --> 01:08:23.306
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who she looks like?

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:23.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Who?

01:08:24.026 --> 01:08:26.127
[SPEAKER_08]: That chick on Magnolia that's the druggie?

01:08:27.667 --> 01:08:29.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't remember her name.

01:08:29.168 --> 01:08:30.608
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay, I know who you're talking about.

01:08:30.708 --> 01:08:31.528
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she looks like her.

01:08:31.568 --> 01:08:36.230
[SPEAKER_08]: She's all skinny and, like, blonde and really, like, anorexic looking and stuff.

01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:37.630
[SPEAKER_08]: And she wears really dark lipstick.

01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:39.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for that.

01:08:40.151 --> 01:08:41.831
[SPEAKER_03]: That little, uh, hint.

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:43.712
[SPEAKER_08]: It really gives a shit, you know, yeah.

01:08:46.019 --> 01:08:52.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it has been confirmed, by the way, by Economy of America represented, that DDR Max USA will have no Let Them Move whatsoever.

01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:55.042
[SPEAKER_03]: No mixes, no nothing.

01:08:55.182 --> 01:08:55.882
[SPEAKER_11]: I had remembered that.

01:08:55.922 --> 01:08:58.042
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the British one is going to have Let Them Move.

01:08:58.463 --> 01:09:00.823
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the thing is, to each their own, that's what I always say.

01:09:00.943 --> 01:09:07.485
[SPEAKER_11]: However, you know, if the majority says that we know we don't want this, then I'm glad that they're finally listening to that.

01:09:07.565 --> 01:09:10.266
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, have you heard the new song by Outphase?

01:09:10.326 --> 01:09:11.906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a new Let Them Move remix.

01:09:11.946 --> 01:09:12.606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

01:09:12.806 --> 01:09:14.547
[SPEAKER_11]: And Outphase, Let Them Move.

01:09:16.792 --> 01:09:18.656
[SPEAKER_11]: You know that actually might be cool?

01:09:18.676 --> 01:09:20.419
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

01:09:22.764 --> 01:09:25.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so Euromix 2, right.

01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:26.531
[SPEAKER_11]: But we love Konami.

01:09:28.114 --> 01:09:28.355
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

01:09:30.556 --> 01:09:31.757
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody sent me a file.

01:09:32.717 --> 01:09:33.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I got a picture.

01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:34.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

01:09:34.298 --> 01:09:35.058
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to open this up.

01:09:35.418 --> 01:09:37.039
[SPEAKER_03]: I should not leave my file transferred.

01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:38.679
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't even be saying that.

01:09:38.719 --> 01:09:39.660
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on right away.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:40.400
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.620
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a picture of Politary.

01:09:43.181 --> 01:09:45.462
[SPEAKER_11]: Politary looks like she wants to be a goth girl.

01:09:45.762 --> 01:09:47.803
[SPEAKER_03]: She does look kind of goth, don't you think?

01:09:48.627 --> 01:09:49.828
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe she's slightly cool.

01:09:50.168 --> 01:09:50.468
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

01:09:50.688 --> 01:09:51.068
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

01:09:51.429 --> 01:09:52.409
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool like the grave.

01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:57.111
[SPEAKER_03]: She needs to just maybe do some nude photography instead of singing.

01:09:57.672 --> 01:10:00.713
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get a yes from Brad.

01:10:01.333 --> 01:10:02.994
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for sending me that file.

01:10:03.014 --> 01:10:03.575
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

01:10:05.656 --> 01:10:06.716
[SPEAKER_03]: Pyro Man sent me that file.

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:07.216
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

01:10:08.077 --> 01:10:11.939
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the lovely picture of the lovely and not-so-talented Politary.

01:10:14.388 --> 01:10:15.749
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Matt has a comment.

01:10:16.809 --> 01:10:21.291
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, also, the new cabinet that your Mix 2 is going to have, that's actually going to be the same thing for Max 3.

01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:23.952
[SPEAKER_06]: They're upgrading, I guess, the hardware for that, too.

01:10:24.332 --> 01:10:25.733
[SPEAKER_11]: We can get big and shiny.

01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:26.393
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:10:26.473 --> 01:10:28.354
[SPEAKER_03]: It is about time they did that, though, don't you think?

01:10:28.374 --> 01:10:30.995
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Max 2, it seems like they're really pushing the limits of Max 2.

01:10:31.375 --> 01:10:36.117
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody keeps saying they need to have a DDR mix that has everything in it.

01:10:36.617 --> 01:10:36.877
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S,

01:11:00.903 --> 01:11:04.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of why I like the 5th Mixin' Up, you know, little navigational thing.

01:11:04.885 --> 01:11:09.087
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can put it in alphabetical order or order by difficulty or speed or something like that.

01:11:09.567 --> 01:11:10.507
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty good, don't you think?

01:11:11.148 --> 01:11:17.391
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, do you think they're actually going to call it DDR Max 3 Subtitle Dance Dance Revolution Aderd Mix?

01:11:17.811 --> 01:11:18.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Aderd!

01:11:18.391 --> 01:11:18.911
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.

01:11:18.991 --> 01:11:19.311
[SPEAKER_11]: Aderd?

01:11:19.612 --> 01:11:20.112
[SPEAKER_11]: We need Aderd.

01:11:20.132 --> 01:11:20.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Aderd.

01:11:21.132 --> 01:11:24.354
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, how when you beat the Oni courses, it says you got to the Aderd stage?

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:27.535
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad finally gets that joke.

01:11:27.875 --> 01:11:29.476
[SPEAKER_03]: But Brad doesn't play online much, so he doesn't.

01:11:30.678 --> 01:11:31.999
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the internet.

01:11:32.339 --> 01:11:33.259
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the internet?

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.000
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I invented that.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.101
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, Brad.

01:11:36.281 --> 01:11:37.641
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're on real radio.

01:11:38.182 --> 01:11:40.923
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, Miss Al Gore down there on the floor invented the internet, yeah.

01:11:42.784 --> 01:11:44.385
[SPEAKER_08]: They're playing Paul and Terry out there.

01:11:44.405 --> 01:11:45.205
[SPEAKER_08]: They're playing Love Again.

01:11:45.505 --> 01:11:47.086
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why... It's out in the other room.

01:11:47.106 --> 01:11:49.107
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 2DX's fifth style going on.

01:11:49.147 --> 01:11:51.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we weren't cool enough to get sixth style this week, we're...

01:11:54.833 --> 01:11:56.174
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the intranet?

01:11:56.915 --> 01:11:57.756
[SPEAKER_04]: I want one of those.

01:11:57.796 --> 01:11:58.537
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get me one of them.

01:11:58.997 --> 01:12:00.639
[SPEAKER_04]: We just got new rams today.

01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:02.801
[SPEAKER_04]: We got more rams in my computer.

01:12:03.062 --> 01:12:03.983
[SPEAKER_11]: That was bad.

01:12:05.544 --> 01:12:07.246
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, enough about Paul and Terry.

01:12:07.266 --> 01:12:08.347
[SPEAKER_03]: This show's getting really lame.

01:12:08.627 --> 01:12:12.972
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you are cool.

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:14.453
[SPEAKER_11]: Next!

01:12:17.141 --> 01:12:18.582
[SPEAKER_11]: So, what's next?

01:12:18.602 --> 01:12:19.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is for you, Brad.

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:20.882
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

01:12:22.063 --> 01:12:23.123
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the Brad theme.

01:12:23.163 --> 01:12:25.364
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time Brad walks in the room and opens his mouth.

01:12:26.464 --> 01:12:26.964
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

01:12:27.004 --> 01:12:28.065
[SPEAKER_04]: Our germania is broken.

01:12:29.985 --> 01:12:30.526
[SPEAKER_11]: Our symbol is broken.

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:31.526
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that say rim job?

01:12:32.326 --> 01:12:32.906
[SPEAKER_11]: Our hi-hat.

01:12:32.926 --> 01:12:33.687
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, rim shot.

01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:34.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Rim shot.

01:12:34.787 --> 01:12:37.408
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, how about a report on the condition of the machines at Golfland?

01:12:38.147 --> 01:12:39.989
[SPEAKER_03]: Minnesota is part of the U.S., you dumbass.

01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:05.294
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, you know, for all of our international listeners, no, we're not, you know, the prime example of all Americans.

01:13:05.394 --> 01:13:06.534
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just, you know, the cool people.

01:13:07.355 --> 01:13:08.155
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're the best ones.

01:13:09.916 --> 01:13:11.217
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody wishes they were like us.

01:13:14.259 --> 01:13:21.003
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do sometimes, since we are kind of locally based, all the guests you see on the show do come from the same area and play mostly at the same arcade.

01:13:21.343 --> 01:13:23.224
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we like to rant about our local arcade.

01:13:23.284 --> 01:13:25.745
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to give an update, status update on all the machines.

01:13:25.886 --> 01:13:26.226
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:13:26.386 --> 01:13:27.326
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Matt was just there today.

01:13:27.366 --> 01:13:28.027
[SPEAKER_03]: He can help out, too.

01:13:28.047 --> 01:13:28.287
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:43.425
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, last I noticed, and please correct me if I'm wrong, last I noticed, starting with the farthest corner by the bathroom, Beatmania, well, Hip Hop Mania, Complete Mix 2, is still having issues with their drop-loading coin swap, which they need to actually replace, like the one at Milpitas Golf Land.

01:13:43.525 --> 01:13:45.388
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the screen's really tweaking out now.

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.069
[SPEAKER_11]: That's to be expected.

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:48.610
[SPEAKER_11]: The machine's been there for how long?

01:13:49.051 --> 01:13:50.892
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, at least two years?

01:13:51.212 --> 01:13:52.613
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's really twisted.

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:56.817
[SPEAKER_11]: I played it from the day that they got it in, so, even though I was really sucky at it.

01:13:58.398 --> 01:13:59.819
[SPEAKER_11]: Guitar Freaks is actually working.

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:01.861
[SPEAKER_11]: The controllers seem to be fine.

01:14:01.901 --> 01:14:02.641
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that was great.

01:14:03.582 --> 01:14:05.724
[SPEAKER_11]: Drum Mania, the hi-hat is broken.

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:13.935
[SPEAKER_11]: That, for the people who don't really bother themselves with the names of the different censors, that is the far left symbol.

01:14:14.836 --> 01:14:17.819
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Guitar Breaks is still doing the CD-ROM error thing.

01:14:18.099 --> 01:14:18.479
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it is?

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:18.820
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:19.641
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they sessioning?

01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:20.942
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you notice?

01:14:21.482 --> 01:14:23.324
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't play session because it sucks.

01:14:23.914 --> 01:14:24.755
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Session is fun.

01:14:25.135 --> 01:14:25.935
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Keyboard Mania.

01:14:26.095 --> 01:14:33.460
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like they finally got the keyboards replaced in time for someone to rip off the far right key on the second controller side.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.321
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh boy.

01:14:34.521 --> 01:14:35.041
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

01:14:35.161 --> 01:14:36.322
[SPEAKER_11]: We will find them and murder them.

01:14:36.342 --> 01:14:37.163
[SPEAKER_19]: About GF.

01:14:37.503 --> 01:14:41.485
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I heard a screw was missing on one of the guitar things.

01:14:45.113 --> 01:14:51.418
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, with Keyword Mania, I guess they have been having problems with people stealing the keys again, so they actually turned the whole machine around.

01:14:51.998 --> 01:14:56.642
[SPEAKER_06]: So now the front is facing where the back was, and so no one can play it, and no one can tamper with it.

01:14:56.862 --> 01:15:06.349
[SPEAKER_11]: Quite honestly, I think they should do with that as they did with Guitar Freak's fifth mix when we first got it in, and put it by the back counter so that the staff can better keep an eye on it.

01:15:06.389 --> 01:15:06.969
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, definitely.

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:10.412
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not session anymore, so it doesn't really matter where it's at.

01:15:10.972 --> 01:15:20.479
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little bit better to be slightly inconvenienced to walk, oh, the few feet to the back of the building, as opposed to having them destroy a game that a lot of people really like.

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:26.043
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, DDR USA, well, I personally don't know because I don't play it.

01:15:26.543 --> 01:15:27.704
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to be working alright.

01:15:27.924 --> 01:15:32.027
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Max 2 seemed to be just fine when I was playing on it.

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:33.428
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still loud.

01:15:33.708 --> 01:15:37.631
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still, you know, bass is way too high and it's still eating coins every now and then.

01:15:37.671 --> 01:15:39.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Same with Drum Mania is starting to do that now, too.

01:15:40.481 --> 01:15:42.642
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's just, all that takes is maintenance and then fixing them.

01:15:42.662 --> 01:15:45.942
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's because they don't like to screw the coin sides to where they're supposed to be.

01:15:45.962 --> 01:15:47.083
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, get them to sit there.

01:15:47.483 --> 01:15:49.583
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, para para worked just fine.

01:15:49.603 --> 01:15:52.424
[SPEAKER_11]: I did actually notice some sensor issues.

01:15:53.604 --> 01:15:56.365
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like one of the sides has drooped down just a little bit.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:59.526
[SPEAKER_11]: I think people have been, you know, hopping up there and holding on to the thing.

01:15:59.866 --> 01:16:05.407
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't blame them for not being able to read the warning since it's in Japanese, but still, you know, they should know better.

01:16:05.447 --> 01:16:06.128
[SPEAKER_11]: It's common sense.

01:16:06.188 --> 01:16:07.608
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, not enough people have it.

01:16:09.292 --> 01:16:13.878
[SPEAKER_11]: And on another note, most of the coin slots on Turtles in Time is broken.

01:16:14.319 --> 01:16:14.860
[SPEAKER_11]: I am upset.

01:16:16.743 --> 01:16:17.183
[SPEAKER_06]: That is all.

01:16:17.784 --> 01:16:17.984
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:16:19.166 --> 01:16:21.109
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all.

01:16:21.129 --> 01:16:22.712
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for that lovely update.

01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:24.999
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to take another quick break.

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:31.902
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we come back, we're going to talk about... Why don't we go ahead and do the best 2DX song?

01:16:32.482 --> 01:16:34.522
[SPEAKER_03]: To celebrate Kind of Sick style a little bit.

01:16:34.542 --> 01:16:37.683
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to narrow it down to what the best 2DX song in history is.

01:16:38.543 --> 01:16:39.204
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds fun to you guys?

01:16:40.604 --> 01:16:45.908
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll come back and we're going to do a little segment we call List List with the best 2DX song ever.

01:16:46.008 --> 01:16:50.531
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys in the chat room are going to be the ones that ultimately decide what it is.

01:16:50.871 --> 01:16:52.412
[SPEAKER_03]: So get on in our chat room right away.

01:16:52.713 --> 01:17:04.881
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on irc.eggheads.org or karma.othersideirc.net Just any other side IRC server that you can think of and you're just going to join Channel Orange Lounge.

01:17:05.221 --> 01:17:08.924
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys can help us pick the best 2DX song ever.

01:17:09.545 --> 01:17:13.919
[SPEAKER_03]: and in this break we're going to hear a couple more requests and we'll be right back.

01:18:38.397 --> 01:18:39.118
Thanks for watching!

01:22:13.047 --> 01:22:13.458
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura

01:23:44.885 --> 01:23:50.267
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Balls

01:24:13.696 --> 01:24:14.377
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever, ever, ever.

01:24:14.797 --> 01:24:17.498
[SPEAKER_03]: And to do that, we're going to do a little segment we call Listless.

01:24:18.239 --> 01:24:26.464
[SPEAKER_03]: And participating today in the Listless segment will be myself, Jamie, Matt, Joe, Bradley, and Brad and Irene.

01:24:26.684 --> 01:24:31.767
[SPEAKER_03]: Since they're a couple, they're basically essentially one person, so they'll be doing one big list as one person.

01:24:32.047 --> 01:24:41.813
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're going to do is each of us are going to name off our top three songs, and then we get to go around and everybody will get to eliminate one song from the big list.

01:24:42.413 --> 01:25:11.537
[SPEAKER_03]: and then after that we'll have a list of let's see 12 songs unless there's some duplication we might have a little less but there'll be 12 or less songs and that's when you three or you guys in the chat room get to pick your top three songs and we'll do a vote over a really quick break we'll do about a three minute break that you guys will have to vote so and we're already getting people screaming in the chat room their votes but remember you guys can only vote for stuff that ends up on the list so if your stuff doesn't end up on the list sorry it just can't be considered you're only going to be able to vote for stuff that's on the list

01:25:12.062 --> 01:25:12.263
[SPEAKER_09]: Colors

01:25:23.041 --> 01:25:23.602
[SPEAKER_11]: Any reason why?

01:25:24.782 --> 01:25:33.629
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been listening, that's like one of the few songs to recently come out for 2DX that I've literally listened to ten times in a row because I absolutely love the song.

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:34.910
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:25:35.471 --> 01:25:41.896
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's just, I don't know, it actually just sort of reminded me of a bunch of stuff, so I like it.

01:25:42.968 --> 01:25:45.710
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a note to the chat room, please don't flood your votes.

01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:49.431
[SPEAKER_03]: We hear you loud and clear the first line, so you don't have to type it 60 times, your votes.

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:53.513
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three pick would be Star Mine.

01:25:53.933 --> 01:25:56.094
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say it would be one of the best 2DX songs.

01:25:56.154 --> 01:25:56.975
[SPEAKER_11]: And Waving Fun.

01:25:59.156 --> 01:26:01.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the video has a big part to do with that.

01:26:01.137 --> 01:26:01.897
[SPEAKER_03]: So who's going to go next?

01:26:01.937 --> 01:26:07.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe, you want to go next?

01:26:07.359 --> 01:26:07.900
[SPEAKER_03]: Cracker.

01:26:09.467 --> 01:26:10.087
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

01:26:10.187 --> 01:26:12.188
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we have the vote for Cracker.

01:26:13.388 --> 01:26:15.108
[SPEAKER_18]: Japanese hip-hop is funny.

01:26:15.628 --> 01:26:16.228
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is.

01:26:17.389 --> 01:26:18.529
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, and for Matt.

01:26:20.029 --> 01:26:29.771
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, my number three has to be... I guess it's going to have to be A. It's going to be A as your number three choice.

01:26:29.991 --> 01:26:31.211
[SPEAKER_03]: A from Seventh Style.

01:26:31.231 --> 01:26:31.251
[SPEAKER_03]: A?

01:26:31.991 --> 01:26:32.251
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:26:33.011 --> 01:26:33.691
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

01:26:33.931 --> 01:26:34.452
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other reasons?

01:26:34.472 --> 01:26:36.572
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to elaborate why or just because you like it?

01:26:38.604 --> 01:26:39.744
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Piano Ambient.

01:26:40.365 --> 01:26:40.725
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:26:41.625 --> 01:26:42.646
[SPEAKER_11]: And next we have Bradley.

01:26:44.847 --> 01:26:45.787
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully I'll decide.

01:26:46.347 --> 01:26:48.928
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually decided, so I'll go with number three as Calcutta.

01:26:49.388 --> 01:26:50.569
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcutta!

01:26:50.589 --> 01:26:51.549
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcutta!

01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:55.831
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun song and it has my favorite sequence in it to play.

01:26:56.391 --> 01:26:56.671
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:26:58.132 --> 01:27:00.153
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, Brad and Irene as one person.

01:27:00.333 --> 01:27:02.173
[SPEAKER_04]: Our number three will have to be I Feel.

01:27:02.694 --> 01:27:03.834
[SPEAKER_04]: I Feel, ah.

01:27:04.694 --> 01:27:05.135
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:27:05.475 --> 01:27:06.055
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do you like that one?

01:27:07.125 --> 01:27:08.086
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel it's a great song.

01:27:08.106 --> 01:27:09.868
[SPEAKER_04]: Your number two choice, Jamie.

01:27:26.855 --> 01:27:27.675
[SPEAKER_11]: My number two choice?

01:27:28.376 --> 01:27:37.280
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I actually did scratch off, you know, my Fuck You song, Slugwork, because, well, it kind of fell off once I heard Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock.

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:49.285
[SPEAKER_11]: That one, not only is it one of my favorites to listen to, it's probably one of my favorites to play, except for that, you know, I either get the scratching or I don't, so it's a fun one overall.

01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:50.971
[SPEAKER_03]: Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock.

01:27:50.991 --> 01:27:51.352
[SPEAKER_03]: Good choice.

01:27:51.832 --> 01:27:56.337
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two pick for best 2DX song ever would be Love is Dreaminess.

01:27:56.377 --> 01:27:57.158
[SPEAKER_03]: Love is Crack.

01:27:57.278 --> 01:27:58.719
[SPEAKER_03]: The video is cool.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:27:59.640
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the song.

01:27:59.901 --> 01:28:00.882
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the vocals in it.

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:01.863
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Love is Dreaminess.

01:28:03.645 --> 01:28:05.707
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a comment about its difficulty.

01:28:07.324 --> 01:28:08.184
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just too damn hard.

01:28:08.224 --> 01:28:12.746
[SPEAKER_05]: I just played it like five minutes ago, I think.

01:28:13.007 --> 01:28:24.732
[SPEAKER_11]: That song and one other, or probably the last two I have left to pass in Light Seven on Fifth Style is Love is Dreaminess and Regulus, also known as the Cardcaptor Sakura theme.

01:28:25.892 --> 01:28:26.793
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, next is Matt.

01:28:28.598 --> 01:28:31.540
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, my next one is going to have to be Nemesis.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.000
[SPEAKER_03]: Nemesis, all right.

01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:34.361
[SPEAKER_03]: From Seventh Style.

01:28:34.961 --> 01:28:35.401
[SPEAKER_03]: Sixth Style.

01:28:35.521 --> 01:28:35.862
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Sixth Style.

01:28:35.882 --> 01:28:36.082
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:36.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops, my bad.

01:28:37.002 --> 01:28:37.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Sixth Style.

01:28:37.983 --> 01:28:38.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you choose Nemesis?

01:28:39.543 --> 01:28:40.644
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an awesome trance song.

01:28:41.024 --> 01:28:41.644
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I say?

01:28:42.925 --> 01:28:43.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, works for me.

01:28:43.945 --> 01:28:44.425
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Joe?

01:28:44.966 --> 01:28:45.686
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your number two pick?

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:47.987
[SPEAKER_03]: S.O.S.

01:28:48.007 --> 01:28:48.287
[SPEAKER_03]: S.O.S.

01:28:48.347 --> 01:28:49.508
[SPEAKER_03]: Another Dr. Bombay song.

01:28:49.548 --> 01:28:49.928
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?

01:28:50.538 --> 01:28:52.439
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, it's just crazy, I guess.

01:28:52.919 --> 01:28:54.099
[SPEAKER_09]: The video is absolutely funny.

01:28:54.139 --> 01:28:55.420
[SPEAKER_03]: Well put, well put, it's fucking crazy.

01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:55.860
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:59.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I'm sorry, I need to ask, the speed version or Dr. Bombay's version?

01:29:00.942 --> 01:29:01.702
[SPEAKER_19]: Speed, I guess.

01:29:01.942 --> 01:29:08.864
[SPEAKER_03]: The speed, okay, so it's not Dr. Bombay, we're talking about the speed version by, I believe it's Dr. It's not Dr. Bombay.

01:29:08.965 --> 01:29:09.805
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Jekyll, thank you.

01:29:09.925 --> 01:29:10.305
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Jekyll.

01:29:10.925 --> 01:29:13.046
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, passing off to Bradley.

01:29:15.549 --> 01:29:16.709
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go for my second pick.

01:29:16.789 --> 01:29:18.590
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go for Outer Wall.

01:29:19.150 --> 01:29:19.850
[SPEAKER_03]: Outer Wall!

01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:21.890
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I liked it as soon as I heard it on FifthStyle.

01:29:22.110 --> 01:29:23.711
[SPEAKER_02]: I can play it every time I play a game.

01:29:26.031 --> 01:29:26.271
[SPEAKER_11]: Outer Wall.

01:29:26.291 --> 01:29:27.832
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do that?

01:29:27.892 --> 01:29:28.372
[SPEAKER_03]: Outer Wall?

01:29:28.432 --> 01:29:31.012
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was actually my wallpaper for the longest time.

01:29:31.112 --> 01:29:31.432
[SPEAKER_11]: Right on.

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:35.993
[SPEAKER_11]: When they released all the FifthStyle pictures, I had Outer Wall up there for like three months.

01:29:36.233 --> 01:29:38.934
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we got everybody's number three and number two choices.

01:29:38.994 --> 01:29:39.594
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sorry.

01:29:39.614 --> 01:29:40.314
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to get Brad's.

01:29:40.354 --> 01:29:40.874
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we have Brad.

01:29:41.995 --> 01:29:42.875
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget me.

01:29:43.235 --> 01:29:43.455
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.001
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'd have to say my number two is Gravity by TAC.

01:29:47.902 --> 01:29:48.602
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to know why?

01:29:49.122 --> 01:29:50.663
[SPEAKER_04]: Because TAC owns you all.

01:29:50.743 --> 01:29:53.524
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised the amount of Seventh Style songs that are showing up here.

01:29:53.744 --> 01:29:54.644
[SPEAKER_03]: Seventh Style is really good.

01:29:55.164 --> 01:29:56.545
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a funny joke, Irene.

01:29:56.925 --> 01:30:02.307
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, see, that's the reason why actually I like it, because it sounds like another incarnation of one of my favorite songs, Electro Tune.

01:30:02.407 --> 01:30:04.008
[SPEAKER_04]: So, way to go, TAC.

01:30:04.108 --> 01:30:04.628
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that works.

01:30:05.268 --> 01:30:05.548
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:30:05.849 --> 01:30:06.769
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just Attack, Attack.

01:30:07.133 --> 01:30:14.818
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so now everybody's... And we're already getting booed by a lot of people in the chat room for our choices, but you know... Well, you get to vote later.

01:30:14.878 --> 01:30:15.538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you get to vote.

01:30:15.638 --> 01:30:17.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you'll get to determine the final list.

01:30:17.839 --> 01:30:19.740
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll also get a buggy of a week next week.

01:30:20.001 --> 01:30:20.281
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:30:21.942 --> 01:30:22.242
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:30:22.582 --> 01:30:23.903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's number one choices.

01:30:23.963 --> 01:30:27.105
[SPEAKER_03]: So your personal favorite 2DX song ever.

01:30:27.205 --> 01:30:27.485
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie.

01:30:28.354 --> 01:30:32.717
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, as if people can't figure out what mine is going to be, it's going to be Reincarnation.

01:30:33.237 --> 01:30:34.017
[SPEAKER_03]: Reincarnation.

01:30:34.037 --> 01:30:38.320
[SPEAKER_11]: And Brad totally called it.

01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:39.280
[SPEAKER_03]: Good choice, good choice.

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:43.643
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, of course it's got to be Reincarnation, because I sat and was pissed at that song for weeks.

01:30:43.943 --> 01:30:48.386
[SPEAKER_11]: The first time I passed it on 7Key, my cat walks behind my PS2 and unplugs it.

01:30:49.146 --> 01:30:54.129
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I didn't pass it since until I actually got a third style from my friend while I was off at Anime Expo.

01:30:54.952 --> 01:31:02.635
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so my number one song, and I just, I absolutely fell in love with this song the first time I heard it, and it really is the song that just hooked me into 2DX.

01:31:02.655 --> 01:31:04.416
[SPEAKER_03]: I always thought it was cool, this is the song that hooked me into it.

01:31:05.076 --> 01:31:08.478
[SPEAKER_03]: Deadline was my number one favorite Mamani song ever.

01:31:09.778 --> 01:31:12.019
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Joe, why don't you give us your number one pick?

01:31:14.102 --> 01:31:16.384
[SPEAKER_19]: I also like this one in Fifth Economics.

01:31:16.464 --> 01:31:18.806
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Absolute by DJ Taka.

01:31:19.306 --> 01:31:19.586
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:31:21.688 --> 01:31:22.508
[SPEAKER_19]: He rules.

01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:23.869
[SPEAKER_11]: It's absolutely cool.

01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:25.851
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely a good choice there.

01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:28.473
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Matt, your number one pick.

01:31:29.694 --> 01:31:32.096
[SPEAKER_06]: My number one pick has to be In My Eyes from Fifth Economics.

01:31:32.236 --> 01:31:33.437
[SPEAKER_03]: In My Eyes, okay.

01:31:35.538 --> 01:31:37.119
[SPEAKER_11]: That one is not an easy one either.

01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:38.801
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Bradley.

01:31:42.583 --> 01:31:43.523
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley's number one choice.

01:31:43.923 --> 01:31:48.625
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I know Brad's going to say another one that could be my favorite, but I'm going to go with Presto.

01:31:49.325 --> 01:31:50.185
[SPEAKER_02]: Presto, okay.

01:31:50.205 --> 01:31:51.726
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could pass it, but I haven't gotten there.

01:31:51.866 --> 01:31:54.407
[SPEAKER_02]: Got 72% once, but... All right, Presto.

01:31:55.007 --> 01:31:58.848
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Presto is number one 2DX favorite song.

01:31:58.908 --> 01:32:01.689
[SPEAKER_11]: And you should see the another if you think the 7T is hard.

01:32:01.849 --> 01:32:04.030
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go, the very last one on the list.

01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:05.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad's number one choice.

01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:05.810
[SPEAKER_03]: Our number one.

01:32:06.710 --> 01:32:07.471
[SPEAKER_04]: The envelope, please.

01:32:08.991 --> 01:32:10.832
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is actually my number one.

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:12.012
[SPEAKER_08]: I chose Love Will...

01:32:12.655 --> 01:32:14.433
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Will That's a great song Oh!

01:32:17.408 --> 01:32:19.609
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of Rick on here, RIC.

01:32:20.489 --> 01:32:22.089
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Lovewill in my eyes.

01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:25.670
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel a lot of him on there.

01:32:26.150 --> 01:32:26.790
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a bit of LED, too.

01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:28.511
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, they're all Kiriyama Oka, so.

01:32:28.811 --> 01:32:29.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all right.

01:32:30.911 --> 01:32:34.292
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, surprisingly, V did not show up on the list.

01:32:34.352 --> 01:32:35.312
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of surprised me.

01:32:35.333 --> 01:32:36.253
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought somebody would say it.

01:32:36.633 --> 01:32:38.013
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say it because I thought somebody else would say it.

01:32:38.033 --> 01:32:39.654
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we couldn't name the Katimu version.

01:32:39.834 --> 01:32:42.674
[SPEAKER_03]: V did not show up on the list, but A did somehow, so.

01:32:42.774 --> 01:32:44.375
[SPEAKER_11]: We couldn't put the V vocal on there.

01:32:44.655 --> 01:32:45.215
How about we all...

01:32:45.775 --> 01:32:49.839
[SPEAKER_11]: Make a cumulative vote of V We just want to add V on the list?

01:32:49.879 --> 01:33:06.154
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have a group vote of V V's on there Okay, so now we have 19 songs And we're going to now eliminate 6 of them And this is kind of a hard choice Because these are all really good songs on here So we're going to have to take off 6 of them So starting with Jamie

01:33:07.429 --> 01:33:10.432
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to eliminate one, huh?

01:33:32.348 --> 01:33:34.569
[SPEAKER_03]: I... I don't know.

01:33:34.749 --> 01:33:38.891
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get rid... You know, I just... I don't like this song in 2DX.

01:33:39.171 --> 01:33:43.493
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just a song that should have been only in Keyboard Mania.

01:33:43.553 --> 01:33:44.493
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting rid of Presto.

01:33:44.793 --> 01:33:46.114
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't... I don't care for it.

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:47.915
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, Presto.

01:33:48.655 --> 01:33:49.636
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Keyboard Mania song.

01:33:49.716 --> 01:33:50.656
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't like it in 2DX.

01:33:50.696 --> 01:33:50.996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

01:33:51.696 --> 01:33:53.537
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, next we have Joe's book.

01:33:54.158 --> 01:33:55.518
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe, what do you want to take out the list?

01:33:56.218 --> 01:33:56.959
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me see.

01:33:59.440 --> 01:33:59.600
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:01.981
[SPEAKER_19]: Man, this is a tough one.

01:34:02.141 --> 01:34:02.641
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

01:34:02.761 --> 01:34:05.443
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd probably take off, like, God.

01:34:07.444 --> 01:34:11.187
[SPEAKER_19]: Give me a sec.

01:34:13.508 --> 01:34:16.910
[SPEAKER_03]: A. You're taking off A. Oh.

01:34:18.171 --> 01:34:18.291
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

01:34:18.371 --> 01:34:20.212
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too new.

01:34:20.332 --> 01:34:22.173
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too new to be the best one ever.

01:34:22.594 --> 01:34:23.054
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:34:23.374 --> 01:34:23.874
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:34:24.235 --> 01:34:25.375
[SPEAKER_03]: A is gone.

01:34:26.156 --> 01:34:26.476
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:34:28.681 --> 01:34:29.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt, you're next.

01:34:29.482 --> 01:34:30.823
[SPEAKER_06]: And I swear this isn't out of bitterness.

01:34:31.924 --> 01:34:32.364
[SPEAKER_06]: Cracker.

01:34:32.824 --> 01:34:33.465
[SPEAKER_06]: Cracker!

01:34:36.848 --> 01:34:38.329
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, I have to agree.

01:34:38.349 --> 01:34:40.551
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my other choice.

01:34:40.711 --> 01:34:41.551
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, next we have Bradley.

01:34:42.992 --> 01:34:44.614
[SPEAKER_03]: Bradley is taking one off.

01:34:45.074 --> 01:34:45.535
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want?

01:34:46.575 --> 01:34:49.437
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like colors all that much yet.

01:35:01.606 --> 01:35:05.428
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to call into the corner and cry.

01:35:05.749 --> 01:35:07.309
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Colors is gone, sorry.

01:35:07.450 --> 01:35:08.630
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, next we have Brad.

01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:11.832
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can't hate Bradley because he brought me Twindi.

01:35:13.553 --> 01:35:14.514
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbye, Calcutta.

01:35:15.054 --> 01:35:17.195
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, goodbye, Calcutta.

[SPEAKER_11]: Driving the taxi out of Calcutta.

[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that leaves us with our final list, and they're going to vote on this in the chat room right now.

01:35:27.228 --> 01:35:32.354

01:35:32.414 --> 01:35:35.798
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm in the chat room as S-K-I-E, and I have a little bar that says O-L.

01:35:36.178 --> 01:35:39.322
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to send me your vote as a private message, or it doesn't count.

01:35:39.402 --> 01:35:40.604

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.182

[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

[SPEAKER_11]: Tremble Please.

[SPEAKER_03]: Absolute was voted the best 2DX song ever.

01:41:41.147 --> 01:41:41.548
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

01:41:41.668 --> 01:41:44.829
[SPEAKER_11]: The only joust that I do is on the Atari 5200.

01:41:45.129 --> 01:41:45.469
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

01:41:46.210 --> 01:41:46.470
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:49.831
[SPEAKER_03]: So once again, third place was StarMine.

01:41:49.911 --> 01:41:50.331
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

01:41:51.092 --> 01:41:51.912
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, hold on one second.

01:41:52.012 --> 01:41:52.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Second place.

01:41:52.632 --> 01:41:53.112
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, what?

01:41:53.873 --> 01:41:57.634
[SPEAKER_05]: When I hear Absolute, I definitely do not think of, like, going and jousting.

01:41:58.435 --> 01:42:00.055
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell did that come from?

01:42:00.476 --> 01:42:04.497
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes from the fact that Ultracade happens to be right there, which has joust in it.

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:05.618
[SPEAKER_03]: So when...

01:42:06.297 --> 01:42:08.478
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen so much Alanis Morissette videos, haven't you?

01:42:08.518 --> 01:42:11.479
[SPEAKER_08]: Her precious illusions, medieval... I didn't even think of that.

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:11.960
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:13.580
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't joust in that video.

01:42:14.001 --> 01:42:15.221
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

01:42:15.581 --> 01:42:17.462
[SPEAKER_05]: Go make a jousting freestyle for DDR.

01:42:18.063 --> 01:42:18.943
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I will.

01:42:19.423 --> 01:42:20.244
[SPEAKER_05]: I just might.

01:42:20.364 --> 01:42:21.724
[SPEAKER_11]: But you have to come out on the bird.

01:42:22.445 --> 01:42:23.945
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to have the bird from Joust.

01:42:24.626 --> 01:42:25.746
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you be my bird, Jamie?

01:42:25.906 --> 01:42:26.387
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no!

01:42:27.828 --> 01:42:30.850
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'll like go mutate you on or something.

01:42:33.011 --> 01:42:34.312
[SPEAKER_11]: In my secret nest.

01:42:34.332 --> 01:42:35.733
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be the big flying alligator.

01:42:36.473 --> 01:42:39.375
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have something you wanted to say?

01:42:39.955 --> 01:42:41.696
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally unrelated to this.

01:42:41.716 --> 01:42:42.717
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a new topic?

01:42:42.937 --> 01:42:43.897
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a new topic.

01:42:43.957 --> 01:42:44.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, new topic.

01:42:45.578 --> 01:42:46.379
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's finish the old topic.

01:42:46.399 --> 01:42:47.039
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go to your new topic.

01:42:47.785 --> 01:42:54.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Just before you finish this, I'd like to say that I'm very displeased with all of you because you took off the best songs.

01:42:55.207 --> 01:42:56.107
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the songs I picked.

01:42:56.727 --> 01:42:59.087
[SPEAKER_04]: And my opinion is the only one that matters.

01:42:59.688 --> 01:43:00.428
[SPEAKER_04]: I am God!

01:43:00.448 --> 01:43:01.488
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

01:43:01.668 --> 01:43:01.908
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:43:02.948 --> 01:43:03.448
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't.

01:43:04.049 --> 01:43:06.489
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

01:43:07.269 --> 01:43:08.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, where's my vomit?

01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.770
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the vomit.

01:43:09.170 --> 01:43:09.830
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the vomit.

01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:10.610
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me the vomit.

01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:12.550
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to say, show me the vomit.

01:43:13.091 --> 01:43:14.151
[SPEAKER_04]: Show me the vomit!

01:43:14.211 --> 01:43:14.951
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't tell the truth.

01:43:18.419 --> 01:43:19.341
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm sorry.

01:43:19.561 --> 01:43:21.103
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, I love you guys.

01:43:21.583 --> 01:43:23.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, apologize to the chatroom and say you're sorry and you love them.

01:43:24.507 --> 01:43:25.909
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you guys, chatroom.

01:43:27.170 --> 01:43:28.813
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people do we have in the chatroom right now?

01:43:29.634 --> 01:43:29.894
[SPEAKER_04]: Thirteen.

01:43:30.626 --> 01:43:32.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I love you, all 13 of you.

01:43:33.088 --> 01:43:33.508
[SPEAKER_04]: All at once.

01:43:33.528 --> 01:43:34.949
[SPEAKER_11]: But Brad and I are the only people that have taste.

01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.971
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Jamie!

01:43:38.652 --> 01:43:39.833
[SPEAKER_04]: As if I wasn't harsh enough.

01:43:40.613 --> 01:43:42.154
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you all have good taste.

01:43:42.294 --> 01:43:44.256
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolute was a good choice from the majority.

01:43:44.716 --> 01:43:45.897
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think Absolute's pretty.

01:43:46.157 --> 01:43:47.058
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fair, it's fair.

01:43:47.098 --> 01:43:52.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, on a total, in another part of the country, in another dimension, we have other news.

01:43:52.862 --> 01:43:53.282
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Matt?

01:43:53.543 --> 01:43:54.403
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's see here.

01:43:54.543 --> 01:43:59.387
[SPEAKER_06]: Since there's not really much sim news going on, since all the websites are down because of bandwidth issues...

01:44:00.047 --> 01:44:08.716
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one thing, the DDR East Coast Invasion DWI contest the results are in, and I'm very disappointed with them.

01:44:09.977 --> 01:44:11.999
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's your own personal damn opinion, by the way.

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:17.465
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's my personal opinion, you know, being the sort of sim expert here, and I've played all of these.

01:44:17.805 --> 01:44:18.365
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you that.

01:44:18.426 --> 01:44:20.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of the people in this room, you would be the sim expert.

01:44:20.627 --> 01:44:24.210
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you've been playing StepMania, DWI, and all that before.

01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:26.291
[SPEAKER_03]: They were cool and looked like Max and all that.

01:44:26.311 --> 01:44:26.832
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll give you that.

01:44:26.992 --> 01:44:27.492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.

01:44:27.532 --> 01:44:30.294
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, third place was Evolution.

01:44:30.695 --> 01:44:33.057
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was... It's not above it.

01:44:33.097 --> 01:44:33.397
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

01:44:33.817 --> 01:44:41.480
[SPEAKER_06]: by Mercury Storm, and if my memory serves me right, I believe it was the Evolution Time is Pop mix, if I remember correctly.

01:44:42.721 --> 01:44:48.444
[SPEAKER_06]: Second place was Naturally by Bimani Ruler, which should have taken it, and, you know, I'm very disappointed.

01:44:49.504 --> 01:44:59.549
[SPEAKER_06]: And first place was Healing Vision Half Mix, which is like a remix of Healing Vision with Healing Vision and Angelic mixed together, which is really goddamn retarded by CMCM.

01:44:59.569 --> 01:45:01.730
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel a little strongly there about that, don't you?

01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:02.610
[SPEAKER_06]: It is retarded.

01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:07.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'd like to add that if I had entered, I would have probably won, but that's just me.

01:45:08.792 --> 01:45:09.292
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

01:45:09.612 --> 01:45:12.513
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were going to be doing an entry with... Can I say what you were going to do?

01:45:12.713 --> 01:45:13.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go ahead.

01:45:13.513 --> 01:45:19.875
[SPEAKER_03]: You were going to go ahead and do an era good, cool, fat mix, the kind of rap version era, which is, by the way, on our playlist for Bomani Music and More.

01:45:20.135 --> 01:45:28.678
[SPEAKER_06]: You were going to do a... I was doing that, and I kind of slacked off and procrastinated on it and didn't quite get it done.

01:45:29.498 --> 01:45:45.568
[SPEAKER_06]: so that's why I don't have it and I was even planning to make my own video and that would have made me win but unfortunately I didn't get a chance to enter it and they're still going to have some more contests so I'll plan on entering those I'll get some done I've got a list of stuff I've got to make but I haven't had time

01:45:46.676 --> 01:45:47.557
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you just haven't had time.

01:45:47.577 --> 01:45:48.318
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been too lazy.

01:45:48.518 --> 01:45:51.761
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, over the last couple weeks, I haven't had air conditioning.

01:45:52.041 --> 01:45:56.826
[SPEAKER_06]: And I couldn't sit at home and program, you know, steps in, like, 102 degrees in my house.

01:45:56.926 --> 01:45:59.629
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said, you know, the hell with it, and went and played DDR instead.

01:46:01.150 --> 01:46:04.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom does... A lot of fans of the Half Mix there in the chatroom.

01:46:05.835 --> 01:46:07.056
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem to like it, some of them.

01:46:07.937 --> 01:46:09.999
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, just to each their own, I suppose.

01:46:11.247 --> 01:46:13.008
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good, but it wasn't the best.

01:46:13.148 --> 01:46:14.589
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:16.871
[SPEAKER_03]: Them's fighting words, Matt.

01:46:16.911 --> 01:46:18.693
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, next time I will show them up.

01:46:18.713 --> 01:46:19.754
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

01:46:19.794 --> 01:46:20.675
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be there.

01:46:20.695 --> 01:46:21.856
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be there with bells on.

01:46:21.956 --> 01:46:22.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I will be there.

01:46:22.816 --> 01:46:24.998
[SPEAKER_06]: The next contest that they have, I will enter.

01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:28.101
[SPEAKER_06]: You will see Loki plastered to something on there.

01:46:28.281 --> 01:46:29.662
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will definitely enter.

01:46:29.742 --> 01:46:30.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:46:30.663 --> 01:46:31.144
[SPEAKER_03]: We trust you.

01:46:31.764 --> 01:46:32.544
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking forward to it.

01:46:53.534 --> 01:47:15.474
[SPEAKER_03]: and some people have been sending us some of their own homemade remixes so Jamie and I are going to tear through some of those and we might put a couple of those up in a rotation because we don't want to just draw the line on Bomani songs as you know in our music show we do sometimes put in songs we think ought to be in Bomani we put in some Parappa stuff just for laughs and other things pump it up stuff just because it might as well be Bomani

01:47:15.794 --> 01:47:18.036
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking we could even take live bands.

01:47:18.316 --> 01:47:22.159
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's a local band in the area, we'd support Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.

01:47:22.199 --> 01:47:22.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, sure.

01:47:22.919 --> 01:47:32.967
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything you think, if you've made a song and you think it deserves to be in DDR, 2DX, any of those games, I say it's good enough for our station, so send it to us and we'll listen to it.

01:47:32.987 --> 01:47:35.929
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I have already gotten a few remixes, so Jamie and I are going through those.

01:47:36.429 --> 01:47:46.035
[SPEAKER_03]: I was sent a Hysteria remix by JB, and I believe there's also supposed to be a remix of Cowgirl that he's going to send me pretty soon, so I'll have to take a listen to those.

01:47:46.556 --> 01:47:49.297
[SPEAKER_03]: And Kiel also has a pretty good papaya mix there.

01:47:49.578 --> 01:47:50.618
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, I love that.

01:47:50.658 --> 01:48:00.645
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll go ahead, and if I ask him to, go ahead Kiel, plug your website there in the chat room, and he's got a great papaya mix there, so if you're in the chat room, go check that out, it's pretty funny, pretty good stuff.

01:48:01.485 --> 01:48:03.927
[SPEAKER_03]: I say funny because papaya makes me laugh, just her voice, I don't know.

01:48:04.207 --> 01:48:12.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and I'd like to say that I do have some of Kiel's songs in my sim I've got those off of the Monty Ruler site and they're pretty good, I like them

01:48:14.522 --> 01:48:15.503
[SPEAKER_10]: So lots of support.

01:48:15.563 --> 01:48:16.323
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep up the good work.

01:48:16.363 --> 01:48:16.644
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

01:48:17.144 --> 01:48:18.165
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be doing that soon.

01:48:18.185 --> 01:48:20.326
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a future direction Orange Lounge Radio is going to be taking.

01:48:22.428 --> 01:48:25.250
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, I think we're damn near out of topics to talk about.

01:48:25.330 --> 01:48:27.632
[SPEAKER_03]: So how about we just talk about other stuff?

01:48:27.652 --> 01:48:28.653
[SPEAKER_03]: How's your guys' week been going?

01:48:30.334 --> 01:48:32.135
[SPEAKER_03]: Any funny DDR stories from the week?

01:48:32.276 --> 01:48:35.598
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I think we might have toxic mold in our apartment.

01:48:35.818 --> 01:48:36.198
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?

01:48:36.639 --> 01:48:38.060
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm coughing up like...

01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:39.101
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

01:48:55.922 --> 01:48:58.684
[SPEAKER_03]: The way Brad plays DDR is really hilarious.

01:48:58.905 --> 01:49:00.886
[SPEAKER_03]: The way he dances when he does doubles.

01:49:01.306 --> 01:49:07.031
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the center of his body is completely on the other pad as to where his legs are.

01:49:07.472 --> 01:49:08.572
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's embarrassed.

01:49:08.613 --> 01:49:09.453
[SPEAKER_03]: He's turning the color pink here.

01:49:09.473 --> 01:49:10.034
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's so true.

01:49:10.074 --> 01:49:10.654
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.

01:49:10.994 --> 01:49:15.098
[SPEAKER_03]: I love watching Brad do doubles because it looks like those videos.

01:49:15.118 --> 01:49:18.821
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever seen those videos where they split the screen in half and the head's over here and the feet's over here?

01:49:19.221 --> 01:49:20.943
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Brad looks like when he dances.

01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:23.490
[SPEAKER_11]: But his style is absolutely awesome.

01:49:23.911 --> 01:49:24.131
It is.

01:49:24.731 --> 01:49:25.451
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's lanky.

01:49:25.971 --> 01:49:26.591
[SPEAKER_11]: Lanky style.

01:49:27.491 --> 01:49:27.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:49:28.552 --> 01:49:32.512
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm still think it's pretty cool to be able to pass Catastrophics.

01:49:32.552 --> 01:49:33.633
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't care what someone says.

01:49:33.693 --> 01:49:35.053
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we can pass them all.

01:49:35.073 --> 01:49:35.773
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't keep count.

01:49:36.193 --> 01:49:36.913
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep count.

01:49:36.953 --> 01:49:38.074
[SPEAKER_11]: So, damn it.

01:49:38.494 --> 01:49:40.454
[SPEAKER_11]: I passed my 16th Catastrophic.

01:49:40.534 --> 01:49:41.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

01:49:41.274 --> 01:49:43.515
[SPEAKER_11]: I passed Kakumei like the first time I played it.

01:49:43.595 --> 01:49:44.275
[SPEAKER_11]: God, that song was...

01:49:44.595 --> 01:49:46.677
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel was freaking easy.

01:49:46.697 --> 01:49:50.360
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been playing the katas since, like, what, second, third mix?

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:50.720
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:52.042
[SPEAKER_03]: When did you start playing the katas?

01:49:52.102 --> 01:49:55.024
[SPEAKER_11]: I first started trying them when third mix had just come out.

01:49:55.044 --> 01:49:56.045
[SPEAKER_11]: I had second mix at home.

01:49:56.385 --> 01:49:58.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, is it just me or are the katas getting easier?

01:49:58.948 --> 01:50:05.452
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they are, like, um, you know, I went and tried, uh, well, my knee gave out on me trying Dead End last night, but, you know, Dead End is still hard to me.

01:50:05.752 --> 01:50:14.297
[SPEAKER_11]: However, you know, I was thinking that Kakame was going to be this end-all difficult song, because Burning Heat was so freaking evil, and Kakame was just so damn easy.

01:50:14.897 --> 01:50:19.159
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel, you know, people were saying, oh, I feel is so hard because the steps don't make sense.

01:50:19.339 --> 01:50:21.741
[SPEAKER_11]: The steps make perfect sense if you just listen to the music.

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:23.582
[SPEAKER_11]: That song was absolutely, it...

01:50:24.202 --> 01:50:28.468
[SPEAKER_11]: Cacame was slightly easier, but I feel it was easier than some seven-footers.

01:50:28.589 --> 01:50:29.570
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it was that easy.

01:50:29.850 --> 01:50:31.613
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I definitely agree.

01:50:31.873 --> 01:50:35.418
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to say, Jamie's opinion is spreading faster in Anna Nicole Smith's legs right now.

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:36.840
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:50:38.115 --> 01:50:40.517
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to definitely agree that the cadets have been way easier.

01:50:40.537 --> 01:50:43.499
[SPEAKER_06]: The only few cadets that I can't pass are off of third mix.

01:50:43.519 --> 01:50:46.581
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we've got Afranova, which I'm talking about doubles here.

01:50:46.962 --> 01:50:48.323
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, probably singles too.

01:50:48.643 --> 01:50:50.464
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got Afranova, Dead End.

01:50:50.624 --> 01:50:52.366
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dead End I can pass singles, but not doubles.

01:50:52.606 --> 01:50:53.646
[SPEAKER_06]: And Paranoia Rebirth.

01:50:54.367 --> 01:50:55.468
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't pass that on doubles.

01:50:56.556 --> 01:50:58.257
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my list somewhere I'll go get it

01:51:16.230 --> 01:51:18.053
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, takes their head out of their ass and fixes it.

01:51:18.093 --> 01:51:28.587
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I like the really hard, you know, the super hardness of like, you know, Max 300, Max Unlimited, but I want more songs like Afronova doubles Maniac, you know.

01:51:28.647 --> 01:51:32.072
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that's not extremely hard, but yet still a good workout, you know.

01:51:32.941 --> 01:51:39.522
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, one of my favorite katas, something I kind of liked about Max, too, was that a lot of the steps started to go with the music a little better.

01:51:39.542 --> 01:51:44.723
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of made a lot of the katas were actually fun to dance to, as opposed to just being like a bunch of really fast eighth notes.

01:51:44.743 --> 01:51:55.146
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of my favorite katas, and I know this is an overplayed song, but just bear with me, Sugaru, I think is one of the coolest katas because the dance goes with the music so well that it's really fun to dance to.

01:51:55.166 --> 01:51:56.446
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you agree with me, or...?

01:51:56.946 --> 01:51:57.927
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's very good.

01:51:58.447 --> 01:52:01.330
[SPEAKER_04]: Suaru was one of the ones they really, I think, they did a great job on.

01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:06.133
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of the few Max 2 songs I could say they did not, you know, skimp on for us.

01:52:06.414 --> 01:52:07.615
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to say something before we go on.

01:52:07.975 --> 01:52:11.117
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody in there, it seems like a couple people don't seem to like Primeval.

01:52:11.858 --> 01:52:14.260
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, can you guys beat it on Maniac Doubles?

01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:18.683
[SPEAKER_04]: Because try doing it down at AX where they have, like, dust all over it.

01:52:18.703 --> 01:52:19.184
[SPEAKER_04]: AI?

01:52:19.204 --> 01:52:22.526
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're sliding all over... AI, that's what I meant.

01:52:22.547 --> 01:52:23.087
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jamie.

01:52:23.107 --> 01:52:23.147
[SPEAKER_04]: AI.

01:52:24.568 --> 01:52:35.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, everybody in the entire arcade turned around to watch me try to beat that thing, because you can't play, you can't stick to the machine on Afronova Primeval Devils, it's just... So yeah, let's see you try it.

01:52:35.671 --> 01:52:42.092
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what, this is my opinion of what a kata should be, is a song that you should not be able to beat your first time.

01:52:42.952 --> 01:52:46.953
[SPEAKER_11]: And at least three on Max 2, I have gone and beaten instantly.

01:52:46.993 --> 01:52:50.514
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, like, you know, some of the songs were actually the first time I'd actually ever tried them, the ones they upgraded.

01:52:50.994 --> 01:52:51.995
[SPEAKER_11]: Paranoia, K-Set, Clean Mix

01:53:10.786 --> 01:53:11.707
[SPEAKER_11]: They upgraded that to a 9.

01:53:11.807 --> 01:53:13.368
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to remember also, Jimmy, you're getting better.

01:53:13.728 --> 01:53:16.090
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you're going to start beating more things on the first time.

01:53:16.130 --> 01:53:18.832
[SPEAKER_11]: You still shouldn't be able to beat a 9-footer your first time.

01:53:18.852 --> 01:53:22.375
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's why they've invented, I guess, so to speak, the 10-footer?

01:53:23.055 --> 01:53:26.938
[SPEAKER_03]: Because now they're going to start adding songs that are 10 feet that you're just not going to be able to beat your first time.

01:53:27.238 --> 01:53:32.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Although there's going to be people out there that just, you know, they're so good at DDR at this point, you know, they're going to beat it the first time.

01:53:32.542 --> 01:53:33.603
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing Konami can do.

01:53:33.803 --> 01:53:38.687
[SPEAKER_11]: I still think the game, you know, I'm glad they put in the Oni courses because that keeps the challenge, but that's like a PA challenge.

01:53:39.107 --> 01:53:43.010
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to have, I mean, there's not really any way to increase the difficulty past where it is.

01:53:43.670 --> 01:53:44.611
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not really a way.

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:47.453
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know there's going to be stuff I can't pass today.

01:53:47.493 --> 01:53:49.194
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one that gives me issues.

01:53:49.615 --> 01:53:51.476
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do a six panel.

01:53:51.556 --> 01:53:55.219
[SPEAKER_03]: If they made six panel more than just solo, I mean, could that be a new challenge?

01:53:55.239 --> 01:53:55.939
[SPEAKER_03]: Six panel still kills me.

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, six panel is a little crazy.

01:53:57.781 --> 01:53:58.541
[SPEAKER_06]: Solo sucks anyway.

01:53:59.602 --> 01:54:00.342
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:54:20.794 --> 01:54:22.815
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel follows the back pattern in the music.

01:54:22.835 --> 01:54:23.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it does.

01:54:23.475 --> 01:54:24.355
[SPEAKER_06]: Every edit I make.

01:54:24.856 --> 01:54:29.617
[SPEAKER_06]: It does, but the problem is maybe that doesn't flow quite as well as they could have done it.

01:54:30.518 --> 01:54:33.979
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I didn't really think it did not flow, but then again, that's what I listened to.

01:54:34.019 --> 01:54:35.460
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird to dance to.

01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:37.620
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so kind of like off and weird.

01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:38.921
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't think it was weird at all.

01:54:39.679 --> 01:54:39.979
[SPEAKER_11]: Backbeats

01:55:02.956 --> 01:55:06.597
[SPEAKER_03]: and Orion78, it's like your feet kind of make another instrument.

01:55:06.637 --> 01:55:12.780
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are kind of cool katas because they take a while to kind of learn how to play that instrument and then your feet kind of make a new tune.

01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:13.760
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of think those katas are fun.

01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:20.143
[SPEAKER_11]: That was sort of the basis for another, for my DXY edit another, which the challenge is still out there if you want free food, okay?

01:55:20.943 --> 01:55:22.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to just run over your challenge one more time?

01:55:23.684 --> 01:55:35.741
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, for anybody who can either full combo or 90% perfect attack my DXY edit another, I will take you out to a dinner of up to $15.

01:55:35.781 --> 01:55:36.662
[SPEAKER_11]: How does that sound?

01:55:36.682 --> 01:55:37.924
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, provided I can afford it.

01:55:39.925 --> 01:55:41.806
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, keep in mind, I'm unemployed right now.

01:55:41.826 --> 01:55:47.747
[SPEAKER_11]: I may have to owe you a rain check, but I will definitely, the first person who does it, you are getting taken out to a nice dinner.

01:55:50.008 --> 01:55:50.788
[SPEAKER_11]: And what do we hear?

01:55:51.568 --> 01:55:52.689
[SPEAKER_11]: I want my GC.

01:55:52.889 --> 01:55:53.789
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay.

01:55:54.169 --> 01:55:56.269
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, this has to go for the second challenge.

01:55:59.090 --> 01:56:09.877
[SPEAKER_11]: And for whoever can full combo my Look to the Sky edit with at least a 90% perfect attack, then you get a free GameCube pen, which is still in my purse.

01:56:10.197 --> 01:56:13.699
[SPEAKER_11]: Woohoo!

01:56:13.739 --> 01:56:20.364
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, if you can send me proof that it's been passed, then send me a photo of the screen, or video or something.

01:56:21.144 --> 01:56:24.826
[SPEAKER_11]: Send me physical proof and I will be sending you a GameCube pen.

01:56:25.527 --> 01:56:26.687
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, pretty cool.

01:56:28.290 --> 01:56:29.390
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have about three minutes left.

01:56:29.410 --> 01:56:30.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody got any other closing thoughts?

01:56:30.811 --> 01:56:31.451
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for anything.

01:56:31.511 --> 01:56:32.451
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't have to be Bomani.

01:56:32.751 --> 01:56:34.992
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you guys want to talk about?

01:56:35.232 --> 01:56:36.572
[SPEAKER_09]: My spoon is too big.

01:56:38.472 --> 01:56:40.473
[SPEAKER_03]: Austin Powers 3 coming out this Friday.

01:56:40.833 --> 01:56:41.333
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

01:56:42.313 --> 01:56:44.694
[SPEAKER_03]: Same jokes as Austin 1 and 2, I bet you anything.

01:56:45.034 --> 01:56:45.854
[SPEAKER_03]: Same jokes.

01:56:46.274 --> 01:56:47.255
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they can do that.

01:56:47.715 --> 01:56:48.575
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

01:56:49.115 --> 01:56:50.175
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go see it.

01:56:54.255 --> 01:56:55.975
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, everyone's pointing them back?

01:56:55.995 --> 01:56:57.316
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we can't pick it up.

01:56:57.336 --> 01:56:58.556
[SPEAKER_07]: We want comments from Irene.

01:56:59.076 --> 01:56:59.796
I'm sorry.

01:57:00.276 --> 01:57:02.057
[SPEAKER_07]: All I was going to say is that I got a different car.

01:57:02.217 --> 01:57:02.617
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

01:57:02.837 --> 01:57:03.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

01:57:03.697 --> 01:57:04.897
[SPEAKER_03]: You finally got rid of the Golf, right?

01:57:05.037 --> 01:57:05.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:57:05.477 --> 01:57:06.137
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, way to go.

01:57:06.218 --> 01:57:07.818
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I need people to do me a favor.

01:57:08.078 --> 01:57:08.578
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh, what's that?

01:57:09.098 --> 01:57:16.740
[SPEAKER_11]: For people, it doesn't matter what part of the country you're in, I need some people to help me find an 83 Toyota Corolla AE86 hatchback.

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:18.060
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite a request.

01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:21.541
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, so I can have my Trano ended up like the initial D car.

01:57:21.561 --> 01:57:22.681
[SPEAKER_11]: You want fries for that?

01:57:23.301 --> 01:57:26.302
[SPEAKER_11]: If anyone can find one or has one for sale, let me know.

01:57:26.422 --> 01:57:26.962
[SPEAKER_11]: I will buy it.

01:57:30.023 --> 01:57:31.964
[SPEAKER_06]: And Eight-Legged Freaks was okay.

01:57:32.664 --> 01:57:33.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Go see it, though.

01:57:33.484 --> 01:57:35.044
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks so retarded.

01:57:35.084 --> 01:57:36.285
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a drive-in movie.

01:57:36.365 --> 01:57:37.365
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks retarded.

01:57:37.425 --> 01:57:38.625
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I went and saw it.

01:57:38.825 --> 01:57:40.186
[SPEAKER_06]: I based my opinion on the trailers.

01:57:40.226 --> 01:57:41.446
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my best way to describe it.

01:57:42.046 --> 01:57:47.768
[SPEAKER_06]: It was better than Tremors, but not quite as good as Gremlins.

01:57:48.788 --> 01:57:49.968
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just campy.

01:57:50.028 --> 01:57:51.029
[SPEAKER_06]: It was meant to be campy.

01:57:51.049 --> 01:57:52.029
[SPEAKER_06]: It was meant to be stupid.

01:57:52.069 --> 01:57:54.389
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole point is that it has very little plot.

01:57:54.409 --> 01:57:56.590
[SPEAKER_06]: You just watch a bunch of people try to survive spiders.

01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:58.190
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the whole movie.

01:57:58.230 --> 01:57:59.011
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a drive-in movie.

01:57:59.051 --> 01:58:00.391
[SPEAKER_06]: It's meant to be cheesy and corny.

01:58:00.451 --> 01:58:03.612
[SPEAKER_06]: It's paying homage to all those giant monster movies of the 50s.

01:58:07.493 --> 01:58:08.493
[SPEAKER_11]: Arachnophobia was better.

01:58:09.033 --> 01:58:12.374
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, arachnophobia, when I saw that, I went to go make out with somebody.

01:58:14.054 --> 01:58:15.074
[SPEAKER_04]: You dog!

01:58:15.094 --> 01:58:17.175
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have eight legs, did they?

01:58:18.883 --> 01:58:20.065
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't watching the movie.

01:58:34.202 --> 01:58:41.950
[SPEAKER_03]: After this show is over, why don't you give a listen to our Bomani Music and More program, playing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when this show is not on the air.

01:58:42.170 --> 01:58:48.737
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to be putting new stuff this week into the rotation, all sorts of new crap, including some of the stuff you heard tonight on the show.

01:58:49.598 --> 01:58:51.199
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that's about it.

01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:53.241
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you want to say, Jamie?

01:58:53.602 --> 01:58:57.966
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go officially brain dead once the show is over, so I have nothing else to say.

01:58:58.126 --> 01:58:58.686
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

01:58:58.946 --> 01:58:59.907
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks everybody for listening.

01:58:59.927 --> 01:59:01.788
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next week at 7 o'clock.

01:59:01.828 --> 01:59:07.310
[SPEAKER_03]: If you missed any part of the show, we'll be rebroadcasting tonight's show tomorrow night at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

01:59:07.410 --> 01:59:08.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night everybody.

01:59:08.230 --> 01:59:08.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening.

01:59:08.891 --> 01:59:09.351
[SPEAKER_11]: Good night.

01:59:10.797 --> 01:59:12.999
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember kids, that glue you use in school?

01:59:13.059 --> 01:59:14.580
[SPEAKER_12]: It's made from dead horses!

01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:16.201
[SPEAKER_12]: No Wilbur, it's just a sprain!

01:59:39.136 --> 01:59:42.684
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
