Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, excuse me, on planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.
That intro brought to you by Krispy Kreme Donuts, being regurgitated by me as we speak, thank you.
You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bomani.
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
Hey!
This is episode number six for July the 28th, 2002.
We are joined in studio once again by a whole lot of guests, including a few travelers tonight.
Say hello, everyone, to a familiar freestyler.
You might have heard of him.
His name's Mel B. Give it up.
Give what up?
Do I have to give up freestyling?
No, I thought you already threatened to do that already.
Oh, yeah.
No, see, every time people think I retire, it's just like, I'm retiring my clothes, I'm retiring my shoes.
You know, it's like, I don't know, I just get bored, I guess.
It's hard being perfect with nothing to do.
Thank you, Mel B. Also, please give it up for the biggest Sharks fan on the planet.
Say hello to Melody.
Any witty things you'd like to add to follow up to the... How can I follow that up?
It's just absolutely impossible.
Do you want to threaten to retire anything here on the show tonight?
I think about my sharks, I'm sorry.
It just doesn't happen.
Fair enough.
And we've got a lot of other regulars in the house tonight.
As I go around the room, we've got Brad... I'm Brad.
Bradley...
Paul, Matt, Irene, and that's about it.
That's everybody.
So we'll be talking to all of them a bit later, but first a quick break.
Any other thoughts from you?
I have a thought.
What?
The mouth of a child's plate.
I said that wrong.
Well, let her finish that.
Wait, you want to finish that thought now?
Deep thoughts by me.
I don't have any deep thoughts, so just go to break.
We already went halfway into break there, my bad.
Sorry about that.
Technical inconvenience, there it happens.
What, technical incompetence, what?
Technical incompetence, user incompetence right there.
We're going to break, I'll be right back.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse pomani band, Erotic.
Do it all night, do it with me.
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.
Do you take vocal lessons?
Kill your teacher.
In the heat of the night.
Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
I liked it.
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
Next.
Um, that was cool.
Do you even know why you're here?
That was just bloody pathetic.
Next!
Come on, do it with me.
Yes, yes, that's it!
We have a winner!
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Every Sunday night, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
You're repeating yourself.
You are listening.
I know.
I like to repeat myself.
I think a star just fell out of the sky and died.
It landed on somebody.
If a star is falling, though, shouldn't she be making a wish on it?
Yeah, I wish you don't follow me.
Quite the optimistic, aren't we?
Oh, Jamie's been having a pessimism week.
It's fun.
Does that mean we need to start off with your FU of the week?
Hmm.
Alright, I think we need to start off with Jamie's FU of the week.
Jamie's F.U.
of the Week Jamie's F.U.
of the Week
Okay, I'm sure people who read my live journal and who know me know that I've gotten addicted to this game as of late.
I was happy.
I was having a good week.
I got goggles, which you can't get on the current beta.
I traded half my armor for it.
And what do goggles do?
They just look cool.
Okay.
They do, seriously, all they do is look cool.
Jamie has to be cool.
Heaven forbid Jamie's uncool.
I got a 1 in 10,000 chance item that each creature will drop, that 1 in every 10,000 creatures will drop 1.
I got a card, sold it, got more goggles, sold that, got more money.
Now this is Ragnarok or EverQuest?
This is Ragnarok Online.
Ragnarok?
It's sounding like EverQuest here.
No, this is my own crack.
I do not play EverQuest.
Anyway, so I'm all happy and looking forward to getting levels when the server goes down.
and then the server comes back up after I try to sign on to the damn game for an hour and then the character server goes down so I try to log on and hey, my character's missing, yay!
By the way, for people who do play, if you see that the characters are not showing up if you make a new one, you will never get your old character back.
Isn't that nice?
So, I've been sitting here now for
A couple days not being able to play Ragnarok because either the character server is down or the main server is down or doesn't just want me to log in or this other crap.
And so I'm just ready to say screw it except I am an addict.
Now do you have any other FUs of the week?
DuploWeb, damn them.
I hate DuploWeb.
Any particular reason?
You know how they make Duplo blocks for small children or people who ride the short bus?
Yes.
DuploWeb is like that, except it's for, you know, lobotomized newborns.
That's how stupid you have to be to go with DuploWeb.
And me, you know, they did such a good job the first time we had Sackbay Mania, and then they've been just utter poopy heads lately, you know?
Yes, I'm being filtered.
It's our new Orange Lounge Language Filter 2000.
You know, I figured I used up all of my... That's a bunch of bull poopy.
Owl Machino movie.
I figured I used up, you know, all of my fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fucks last week, so I'm gonna be nice today, so fuck them up their asses!
And... I hate them.
They need to die!
They need to go to hell and die there.
So if anybody wants to give me money, do it now.
And we'll have a thank you next week.
Yes.
Whoever decides to give me money, I will not do a fuck you in your direction.
Thank you.
And that's it for your fuck you of the week?
I'll think of something else in a minute.
Well, I have an F you of the week.
I have to play my F you of the week theme song.
Because my F you of the week... Because when I start complaining, I sound like a chicken, so I have to play this song.
My FU of the week is traffic in San Francisco, especially around the 101-80 junction area.
What a piece of shit.
I mean, the people there cannot drive at all.
They don't know what lane they're supposed to be in.
Shouldn't that be like an FU forever, not just for the week?
Well, it pissed me off this week in particular because I was trying to come home today because I moved, for those that don't know, I moved the show out of the little tiny room into the big living room tonight because I knew we'd be having more guests.
And I had about, oh, probably about 20 minutes to move the computer out here into the big room because of traffic.
I'd hoped to have a couple hours.
That didn't quite end up happening.
So my FB of the week is people who can't drive and cause me to get home late.
You know, I don't foresee that getting any better because people are getting dumber and dumber and dumber as, you know, time goes on.
Instead of, you know, being, you know, we're going to eventually have to evolve from a Funky of the Week to a, you know, Funky with a Rabbit Horse of the Week.
Rabbit Horse.
Yes.
Irene's talking about a rabbit horse.
The rabbit horse.
What am I doing?
It's the rabbit horse with big, sharp, pointy teeth.
Arrgh.
Okay, worst radio ever.
You don't make signs with your hands.
They can't see them.
No.
We don't care what they see.
Because they don't see what we're doing.
We're doing this show to entertain ourselves.
Yeah.
To hell with you.
I'm just kidding.
Stay connected.
Please, we need ratings.
Don't go anywhere.
We actually care.
We just pretend otherwise.
You know, it's cool to not give a shit, so that's what we're doing here tonight.
Yeah, anyway, let's start to our guests, shall we?
Let's save this train wreck show and talk to the new blood here tonight.
We have some guests and I'm scooting over to get near the guests.
Everybody say hello to Melody and Mel B. Hi.
Hello.
So what are you kids doing in town this week?
I don't think that can be put on the radio, sorry.
I mean, what brings you to Sacramento this week?
We just had to see all you wonderful people.
Such a freaking suck-up.
You're trying to make me clean house.
Yeah, I know.
You only showed up just so we'd all clean our houses, basically.
Didn't my mother send you?
Damn, my evil plot has been foiled.
Dear God.
Anyway, I'm trying to think.
What else has been going on lately?
We could talk to Melody and Melvia.
How about the CBGL?
You guys are the only ones that are at this big tournament at CBGL last week.
What did you guys think of it?
From a freestyle perspective, I would probably rank this as one of the top two or three freestyle competitions I've ever been to, probably, arguably in America.
It was definitely just, you could have taken the top 15 people out there, they probably would have placed in any other run to middle tourney last year.
Bar has gone sky high.
So you think every other tournament now is going to have to live up to this?
It would be unfair, but I would not be surprised.
The good thing about it is you still have the vets that are coming out there, guys like Trampower, Lil B, and all that.
They're still doing their thing.
They're living up to their reputations.
But you have a lot of people coming up from Scandia, from out of state.
There was a kid from Omaha who absolutely wrecked shop out there.
And they're the new blood, and they're still experiencing all this great freestyle hype.
They're still in love with the game.
And as long as we get those new people up in there and they're busting their ass, I mean, it's going to be a positive thing for freestyle and general attorneys.
Right on.
What did you think of the tournament, Melody?
Just going to watch.
Do you go to a lot of tournaments?
I get dragged to a lot of tournaments most of the time.
Honestly, this time I did not see a single freestyle because management sucked ass.
They refused to move the machine outside.
They created a huge fire hazard indoors.
If any of you have been to Castro Valley...
It's very small.
There is a small inner room that has the DDR machine and they did not move the damn machine outside.
So it was too dang crowded and the air conditioning was not working inside either.
So management was just being very hard to deal with.
You're getting into an FU of the week there.
Okay, well, this would be my FU of the millennium, probably, but hey, we had many run-ins with the manager of Castor Valley, and for someone who agreed to hold the tournament, he should have been a lot more accommodating.
I believe Mel was waving desperately, wanting to throw another comment in there.
Oh, and I guess I'd have to do a quick FE2 at 8-Ball because he was the one that chickened out of a judges-only freestyle tournament.
There was going to be some money on the line, but his excuse to the attorney director who, you know, approached me, said, do you want to do a freestyle tournament for judges?
I'm like, hell yeah.
And he said, well, I won't have anything in time or, according to, from what I heard around the grapevine, apparently he thought whatever prize he was going to get was not worth risking his reputation over.
Okay.
Right.
So who are some of the new freestylers you guys think we're going to be hearing about in the next two tournaments?
Just doing awesome jobs and people you might never have heard about that maybe you should start paying attention to.
Well, I think the biggest contingent of freestyles that are blowing up are the ones from Scandia.
That would be guys like Hypnox, he's been around, but you got guys like Lou Styles, who's absolutely amazing.
Anyone who thinks 8-Ball or Dinkot are good pop lockers, this guy has just taken it to a higher level.
You got, who else, oh yeah, Bruce Leroy, he's one of the most charismatic guys out there.
and just for people in general, there's that kid from Omaha I told you about.
His name was Tequila.
He just recently joined RTF, which you may or may not know is my crew, Return to Freestyle.
He was that good that practically after his first routine, guys just wanted him, swept him up, and he's made quite an impression on everybody.
Tell us a little more about RTF, because that's kind of a big, pretty well-known... Oh, he's going to give you the whole spiel here.
Give us a breakdown, because anything else you want to plug here while you're on the show, go for it.
But tell us a little something about RTF and how it all started and what it stands for and all that.
All right, well, for a quick rundown of the history, RTF started around January of 2001.
It was actually Turnarocci, the tournament at Metreon.
It was about the time when people, we got sick of DDR USA, and people at freestyle tournaments weren't really putting up a good effort.
They were just sort of improv-ing on stage.
You weren't putting any time or thought into it.
And so one of my friends was like, don't you remember back when we actually used to bust ass on freestyle, when we actually used to be creative and, you know, give a damn?
and I thought about, and although I wasn't one of those guilty people, you know, he was just saying, yeah, we have to go back to our roots.
And I was like, yeah, I'm all for it.
We've got to return to freestyle.
And so the name kind of stuck.
You know, it was a lot better than like the Foot Clan or, you know, something else that was already taken.
I remember the Foot Clan.
And so from there, you know, we just got a few people.
At first it was like Shintenshi, me, Mike Ngo, Asian Innovation, then Bran came along.
A few people, and then I think our first major tournament was the Arcade Infinity 2 tourney.
That's the one where I took Solo 2K.
Okay.
and, um... No, we do not need a solo sucks anyway comment.
Yeah, besides, don't you know the new catchphrase is this DDR sucks?
Yes.
So yeah, that's just pretty much RTF in a nutshell.
We like to have a good time.
We're all about just good times and all that stuff.
Freestyle is just, you know, one of the things we happen to like to do.
As for other plugs, well, DDR Spot, of course, is the site that I help run along with a couple of the RTF members.
We're about to do kind of a new thing.
We got a lot of new stuff coming on right now.
Interviews with Jason Eno's doing like stuff about we're usually breaking news with
Imports, and all that kind of stuff, because we're affiliated with Team Guilo and Vimaniac, so we've got a good base of connections.
And basically, keep coming to the site.
We are adding a lot of new stuff daily, and who knows, you just might get knocked on your ass the next time you get there.
Sounds pretty good.
Anything you want to plug while you're here, Melody?
Whee!
Alright, thank you, well put.
You got nothing to plug but your ego today.
It's just, I'm here, I'm here because I rule.
That's why you're here.
Everyone knew that already, though.
Melody, all these rules.
My bad.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I noticed that you took an interesting trip out to Omaha lately.
You actually went out to help.
Were you running a tournament out there, or what was the deal with that?
Yeah, actually, it's a funny story because I had a friend at Tequila, actually, he caught me on IM, or basically on the three courts, and he was saying that their first freestyle tournament that they had absolutely sucked because the judging was terrible.
He showed me a videotape of what they did, and he was clearly more talented than everyone else, and he ended up taking third, so I was like, dang, you need someone to really run a tourney well.
And he said, well, why don't you come out here and show them how it's done?
And I was like, you mean me compete?
And he's like, yeah.
I said, well, if I had the money, sure.
And he basically, he and a few friends offered me a whole bunch of money to come out there and compete.
I was like, wait a minute, you're going to pay my way to kick your ass?
I'm like, something just didn't register.
And for a moment, you know, I actually had scruples and I felt bad about it.
So I was like, tell you what, you take that money, you let me run your tournament, you know, give you the California experience you probably won't get anywhere else.
And that's kind of, you know, how it ran from there, went to their arcade out there.
And surprisingly enough, for an arcade in the Midwest, you would think they won't have that much B-Money or just be that good.
I would say it's probably the most impressive arcade I've been to in, like, three levels.
One level is just pure retro with, like, Kung Fu Master, Karate Champ, and, like, a place that has Karate Champ, man, how can you beat that?
And Popeye and, like, all that good stuff.
And their Bimani was really well-stacked.
In fact, that's the only place in America I know that has a linked Pot of Pot at second mix.
I was blown away, and, uh, it was actually just nice to get out there and just see how Bimani's just really, uh, you know, blown up it.
We're in, like, the smallest-looking cranny of America.
I kind of noticed this might be starting to be a trend here, because I know I was reading another story.
Another freestyler went out to, I think, New York or something to help run a tournament lately.
I don't know if that was 8Ball or somebody.
Was it?
Baltimore.
8Ball did go out to a tournament in, I believe it was Baltimore, Maryland, but he was actually judging it, from what I understand.
Do you think this is an interesting trend that seems to be developing, where people from the West Coast are kind of running all over the nation to be competing and judging and running tournaments, or...?
It's a plague.
Actually, I think it's just really a matter of promoting Vimani in general because they know Californians, you know, we've been out here since the beginning and a lot of us are, you know, well-known just throughout the community and they think drawing in the name will draw those hardcore fans to come out there.
And I said, people like that girl from New York, Jen, she came out here twice and twice she's placed.
So it shows that people want to come out here or, you know, go out there because, you know, they love the game and they just want to get out there against the best.
Do you guys think it's ever feasible?
I know this is kind of one of those topics that's one of those like on the popular message boards comes up probably once a month or whatever.
Do you guys think it's feasible to one day have like a national DDR tournament?
Oh, anything's feasible.
It's just a matter of actually putting in some manpower and a lot of money behind it.
But if they really want it, it can happen.
I think there's enough educated people out there who can judge a freestyle or set up some kind of almost foolproof rules for PA.
It's very feasible.
I think people just have to have the money more than anything.
Right on.
Where would you like to see that held?
Because personally, I'd be rooting for Vegas, because just Vegas rules, and they've got tons of stuff to do there, but of course, if you're under 21, it kind of sucks.
You know where I actually had a good crowd, believe it or not, is actually in Gulfport, Mississippi.
They have pretty large arcade facilities and some of the casinos there, and of course, you don't have to be over 18 to get into the arcades there.
Lots of space, too, and a really good crowd.
Anybody else got any questions or anything?
Did everybody run away to go play Sixth Style or what's going on?
Seems like there's a mystery.
Anybody else got any questions, things to say?
No?
Paul's like, you got Sixth Style?
Yes, it's in the other room.
Go, play.
I don't know, where else do you think we'd be able to hold a good tourney?
I think Vegas is probably the most popular choice.
I would say LA would probably be your next big choice because everyone loves California.
E3 is out there.
Obviously that's like the entertainment mecca.
So I would think pretty much your main metropolitans, LA, New York, Chicago would be your top three choices.
Seattle would be pretty cool too.
I agree, and Seattle's got a lot of really good Perfect Attack players there too, and they'd be able to probably come up with a really good system, I think, for PA as well.
Reading some stuff that they did for a recent tournament of theirs sounds like it could be fun.
It almost sounded like a game show, the way they had it laid out, where people are taking off songs and putting them back on, and all they needed to do was have a trivia challenge.
You know what I think would be awesome?
No, they don't vote people out.
Is to rent a small stadium, like a baseball-type stadium, and get up a big monitor.
Do you think they could seriously fill one of those?
Well, I'm not saying a large one.
Like a minor league stadium.
If we had a tourney that was a national event, that would probably be the prime way to do it, would be to have the machines out there and have a large monitor.
Actually, from some of the footage I've seen in Japan back in 98 or 99, some of their major tournaments were actually held inside amphitheaters, inside concert halls, that kind of thing.
There was an actual stage, there were spotlights everywhere, it was a big production.
I have a few videos of that, and it looks like a really happening thing.
It's certainly being tucked away in the corner of an arcade.
What if a place like Great America, Paramount's, I'm thinking Paramount's Great America, because when I see that there's this...
Some videos that go around the net that happen to be Pump It Up, but when I see those videos, I'm kind of reminded it looks like an atmosphere where it's kind of like Great America's little amphitheater, which is, you know, it's a fairly good size, but it's not huge.
Well, part of that, you know, is also the organization of the tournaments.
From what I learned from a friend who's in Korea...
Pump It Up is actually, like, not just an arcade phenomenon, it's actually things where, like, YMCAs would actually have Pump It Up teams, and, like, my friend, he actually had a Pump It Up teacher that he went to, taught him all this stuff, so, like, they had these factions from different parts of town, they go to these huge events, and that's, and really, a lot of it's not even a contest, it's just an exhibition of people showing off what they can do on different songs.
That's part of what DDR is going to need.
It's going to need almost like backing from other companies or like little factions that have the means to, you know, get publicity, to get money and so forth to have these huge events out of Great America, you know, the amphitheater or wherever.
What would you think of an exhibition-style tournament?
I mean, just to have like an invitational exhibition-style tourney.
Oh, I think it would be great.
I mean, it's gotten to the point where prizes are great and all, but really what it boils down to is you could really weed out the people who really love the freestyle and just love the crowds.
It would be just cool to have an exhibition go out there and just do this.
Hey, you know, we're doing it for fun.
We ain't doing it for prizes.
We just, you know, want to entertain.
I was also thinking, you know, what about like a, you know how they have the People's Choice Awards?
What about a People's Choice style tournament?
Have crowd voting.
Um, I know 8-Ball wouldn't win.
That was wrong.
Okay, um... The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio?
Well, you know me, I mean, I'm all about the dirt and all that kind of stuff.
If you don't hear it from me, you're going to hear it from someone else.
But I got love for me.
It's like, you know, from a competitive standpoint, I want to kick everyone's ass, everyone's an enemy.
But afterwards, hey, we'll knock down a beer and, you know, we'll let you gloat about what you did ten years ago, but hey.
Okay.
And you kind of have this gasp look of surprise on your face.
Molly, anything you want to add?
That wasn't surprise.
That was agreement, Sam.
We won't bring up the event from last night.
Inside jokes here tonight.
Did you have something you wanted to say, Matt?
I thought I saw your hand like halfway up in the air.
I was just going to say I was reading on the DDR East Coast Invasion boards that J-Dog went to help a tournament in Florida at some point.
I believe.
It was someone from the DDR Free boards that I recognized that went to Florida to help a tournament.
I didn't hear about a Florida tournament.
I don't keep tight taps on everyone, but I wouldn't be surprised.
J-Dog's a pretty big man in demand.
It was Florida or Atlanta, I can't remember.
Well, if it comes to Atlanta, usually it's Inawan.
He ran a tournament in Atlanta about a year or two ago when he was actually living there.
Yeah, all I know is they just, they love him over in the East Coast.
So it's like, trying to get them to listen to the show and plug in, but... I guess that's a good question.
How do you feel about fanboys and fangirls?
I mean, because DDR, it's like, you know, you're bound to get some fans to download your videos online.
You're a fairly well-known freestyler and stuff, and people kind of, like, start to get to know you.
Or, you know, want to know more about you and what have you.
Do you think that's kind of weird?
for being a fan over DDR?
How do you feel about the whole phenomenon?
I think everyone's a fanboy or a fangirl of someone that they love.
I mean, you know, jeez, if I were to meet, like, Weird Al, like, up close, five feet away from me, I'd be all, you know, be like, Oh my gosh, that's how to... You go, boy, with your best self.
You know, but it's, you know, to each their own.
I think it's just, you know, a sign of appreciation.
You know, if they appreciate my dance, hey, I'm all for it.
It's like, who would have thunk that?
Just getting up and doing something I do just for fun.
People would download me.
They'd try to copy my style.
They want to find out where I did stuff.
It's, you know, they say flattery is honesty and all that.
It's the truest form of whatever.
Ah, ha.
Imitation is the finest form of flattery, right?
That's what you're here for.
You're there to correct me.
Did I ever tell you about what happened when I was in Mississippi?
Go ahead.
I showed up late for the tourney because I was going to be in it.
The question I got was, when I told people who I was, they were like, Oh my God, you're DarkSakura?
Wait, do you know Mel B?
Wow.
That is truly what I got.
And the other question is, do you still have the bat?
Oh, the bat from Miggle 2, wow.
But yeah, just a quick on the fanboys and fangirls.
I guess the only time it really hit me was when I was in Canada, of all places.
I was in Vancouver visiting a friend, and then some guy actually recognized me from my Santa Monica video.
I was like...
Whoa, out there?
Yeah, I gotta admit, it's kind of weird, but at the same time, hey, I got nothing but love for everyone who's got love back.
For me, it's all about the game, but if they like me, hey, it's all good.
They like you, they really like you.
I guess they're not asking me for my PIN number for my ATM card, hey, it's all too good.
I guess my next question would be for Melody, because it's no secret, she doesn't mind me saying, Melody, Mel B, and Idom here, right?
Yes, it's okay to say on the show, yeah, duh, okay, just making sure.
If you kill all the jokes about Mel and Mel, oh my god, they're the same.
We've heard them millions of times.
Some people don't like that stuff coming out on air, but no secret.
So how do you feel about the Mel B fanboys and fangirls?
It can be rather on the interesting side.
As Mel just sits there saying, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Now we want to hear the funny, embarrassing stories because that's what radio's for.
Funny, embarrassing story.
No, just say it.
No, that's us.
Don't fanboys or fangirls.
It's kind of something you just have to learn to deal with.
It can be hard, but it's kind of something I'm starting to come to terms with that he's going to be out there and that it really is a form of flattery.
People really like him, but as long as they keep their hands off of him, I'm happy.
Because he's mine.
Noah, she loves the fanboys, hates the fangirls.
But yeah, just a quick funny fanboy story, though, was I remember Drags 1, that was when I did my After the Game of Love routine, and I was kind of pimped out in the zebra hat and the feather bow and all that, and at one point my feather bow sort of came apart, and there was a feather that flew around, there was this one team, at the time they were Team Epsilon, I think, and one guy said, oh my god, this feather's cool, can I keep it?
I'm like, well, okay, sure.
I see him at a tournament about eight months later, he pulled the AI-3,
He comes up to me, hey man, I remember you from Drags.
I'm like, oh yeah.
And he busts out his wallet, pulls out that feather from the boy, he says he keeps it for good luck.
I was like, ooh.
That's when I came to realize, you know, it's something I gotta deal with, you know, and I'm actually all happy about it, hey.
Celebrity.
Hey, you know, I mean, some people like the spotlight, some people hate it.
I can embrace it, no problem.
Do you think it's odd at all that DDR is something that kind of creates celebrities?
I've seen Stranger Things create celebrities.
I guess if you can be a celebrity through Star Trek or Survivor.
So who are you going to take the sponsorship from, Pepsi or Coke?
I would have to go with Pepsi.
Alright.
So Pepsi, give him a contract.
Ask another real quick question.
What do you think was the most... Because you go to a lot of tournaments all around California, and now even some outside of California, too.
I've got the UK tournament going in October.
You're definitely going to that, huh?
King of Styles 3, yes.
Right on.
What do you think to date has been the most... I guess I wouldn't say the best or worst tournament, because that's too hard to judge, but maybe the most fun tournament that you went to?
Most fun tournament?
I would have to say...
Probably... I'm going back.
I think probably the most fun tournament was the first ever Metreon tournament.
It was, yeah, about August of 2000.
That's when, like, NorCal's... That was really their first major get-together.
That's when Metreon was holding it.
Pepsi was sponsoring.
KOA was doing their thing.
And that's, you know, when I was in freestyle.
There were, like, two tiebreakers I had to go... There were two tiebreakers in freestyle.
Like, one I had to go against Mike No for first place.
You know, we...
both went at it.
We had to go through improv, we had to go through routine.
They had to pull almost every tiebreaker in the book, but it was just a lot of fun afterwards.
Because everyone out there, it was back before drama really existed and all that.
So it was a sign of times when we were all still bonded together by this whole DDR thing.
We were all together before our personal lives sort of took over.
I guess this is going to be an odd question, but was DDR better then?
I think it's not so much it was better, it was just the fascination was still there.
And at the time, we had 1.5, not a lot of us had third mix or any other mix to compare and yearn for, but nowadays it's like once DDR comes out, we like it for a few days, then we're like, well damn, we want something more, because we realize how fun DDR can be, and it's usually hard to recreate that first genuine pure love you had for that feeling.
It's like, you know, crack.
You know, you get the first hit, all you're trying to do is you're trying to replicate that feeling of the first time.
It never quite happens.
Orange Lounge does not endorse drug.
Alright.
Anything, anybody else want to add anything, or...
I think it's probably about time we go to a break.
We've been on for about a half hour straight, if not more.
So I'm going to go ahead and go to a break.
They were playing Sick Style in the other room.
And they were playing Changes, I don't know why, one of the new songs.
But when we come back, we're going to talk about Sick Style.
So anybody else want to leave us with any thoughts while I queue up some songs?
Think.
Think.
Remember to stay on the pill, because I won't hurt you, but the next man will.
Wiser words were never said.
Friend Fortress, Thunderstorms
I apologize for cutting off the last song there.
We were trying to listen to The Outer Limits and I made a technical boo-boo and it got cut off.
Sorry.
Rob pooped on the machine.
So I'll give you another LED track from New to Six style and maybe we'll get back to Outer Limits a little later.
So my apologies.
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?
No!
Do we care what people think of us?
No!
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and in that last set we had a couple of the new tracks from the Six Style home version which is kind of the biggest news in the Bomani scene this week is that Six Style was released in Japan and so of course all the fans of 2DX are importing it here.
It's pretty.
And it's cool.
We were going to talk about it last week but unfortunately none of us got our copy in time but we have them this week.
I got mine.
I slept through mine.
I finally caved and bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 this week just so I could have Six Style.
And so it's out in the other room right now and there's people playing it.
What do you think?
What do you guys think of Six Style?
Do we like it?
Woohoo!
God, you people are dead this week.
Go play it.
Go in there and play it.
If you haven't played it, go in there and play it.
And for, you know, just come on, everybody who's listening, come on over to Rob's and play it in the other room.
Don't keep the address out, that's all I ask.
Well, I think probably the best thing about Sixth Hour is for the simple fact that every 2DX machine out here that I know of has a really stupid, freaking unreadable screen, and now you can go home and the movies actually work.
I mean, wow.
Who knew that the video for Wow Wow 70s was so fucking cool, huh?
That is awesome.
Well, don't forget about Bearcade, though, because Bearcade does have probably the best quality machine now in California, except for maybe AI that I've played.
Yeah.
AI screen is not that great because now the blue and white keys all look green.
So it's not bad, but not stellar.
The only time I ever played that one was November last year, and I think that was right after it had been replaced.
I haven't been to AI in a while, but just as long... SHGL's old machine was by far the weirdest one I ever had to play on.
I've never seen people just quit in the middle of a game because they got so sick of trying to read the screens.
I usually like to get my whole money's worth when I play 2DX and I did walk away from the machine when I was there last November.
That's the only machine that I ever had such a bad case of vertigo playing because the sides of the screen were burned out in a circle.
I thought I had tunnel vision the whole time.
Now does any 2DX machine in the U.S.
have working videos or is this the first time a lot of us get to see these videos unless we downloaded them online somewhere?
For SixStyle, the only time I ever saw working veils was temporarily.
They did work at AI, but anywhere else I did not see them going.
Interesting.
Any other cool videos you want to point out that people should check out if they get to play this?
On SixStyle?
Well, seeing as how I've only ever played it here at Iguana Girl's house, I think it's one of the Eurobeat ones.
Linus, Mel B says Linus.
One of the Eurobeat ones had the bunny from Keyboard Mania.
I remember playing it and absolutely failing it on 7-key.
And then stopping right in the middle of playing, look over, oh my god, is that the rabbit?
Just like that.
And it distracted me worse than the evil Satan fetus from 250 BPM.
G2 also has a really awesome video too.
That video scares me.
It's got like trans-circa aliens or something.
It's weird stuff.
You expect to see her floating in a glass jar or something.
It's pretty scary.
I have to say, as always, the Orange Lounge videos are the best.
I agree.
Now, did you notice for about a half second in the Wow Wow 70s video, there's a shot of the two girls from the Mobile Moga video with afros?
I was...
The only thing that really distracted me was the building with the fro.
Which, by the way, is going to be replacing my Pocari Sweat icon on my live channel.
Right on.
Now, Bradley, you're a big 2DX fan.
You got any videos that people should be checking out?
Well, not so far.
I've been playing too much to actually watch the videos yet.
Sounds good.
You know which one I actually just like to sit on my computer monitor and just sit in the background and just watch?
It's the one for colors, honestly.
Because it's just so pretty and trancy.
And it's colorful.
It makes me happy.
It makes me the color of blue.
Oh, I was a fool to let you walk away.
Wait.
Another neat thing about SixStyle is it has new movie mode, or movie clip mode, where you can watch the videos full screen.
It's nice, you can put it on autoplay and then just watch the video screen with no notes or anything.
That's pretty awesome.
And a good idea, an idea for anyone who has it, you can do is you can set up a course and make it autoplay and it just goes through all the videos.
You can just watch like ten videos in a row if you want to.
Oh, that's pretty cool.
And actually, it's a good way to hear the anothers, too, because you can just autoplay the anothers.
Like, that's how I heard the Something Wonderful another, because I just beat Something Wonderful on a 7-key for the first time, so I'm not quite ready to tackle the another yet.
But since the another now has vocals, I really wanted to hear it, so I played it in full-screen mode.
But I have to say, music clip mode scared the hell out of me the first time, because I ran it with Jelly Kiss, and it was like, oh my god, Santa's taking over my screen.
It's crazy.
You got something you want to add?
I don't know, just seeing those videos of, like, the guys playing all the stuff one-handed, it's gotta be the most demoralizing bit of footage you could ever watch for 2DX.
Those videos just scream, Americans suck at 2DX.
For the people who don't know what Tetsujin means, it means Iron Man.
It's named that for a reason.
You know, those are some absolutely fantastic players.
It's like, is that trying to spin off on Iron Chef, like Iron 2DX?
I don't know, it's like Tekken for 2DX.
You know, the king of iron fingering.
Whoa!
Never mind, I said another... Remember that part about adult content?
I was referring to this in a completely innocent manner, you pervert.
I think we know what our last week on Orange Lounge clip will be.
Okay, you can bite me now.
I'm going to go sit back in my chair the rest of the night, let people deliver me donuts and vanilla Coke.
Look at this setup we have here.
Jamie's kind of sitting in her throne here, the big blue chair.
The rest of us are all sitting on the floor around her.
Hey, I offered the chair.
The chair is mine.
The chair is rightfully yours.
I am the Vicodin Goddess.
The Vicodin Goddess?
Of course.
And what makes you the Vicodin Goddess?
Because I'm well-medicated.
I have to medicate myself to do the show.
Are you under sedation?
Give me that.
SoCalKicks is saying, let us remind you, were you moist yesterday?
Or last week?
Dude, you still haven't sent me my proof that you passed my edit.
No GameCube pen for you.
Nice question dodge there.
When you send me the proof that you have passed my edit with a 90% perfect attack and full combo, then I will be nice to you and send you your GameCube pen, maybe if you retract your question.
Maybe.
We'll see.
We'll see what he has to respond to that.
In the meantime, let's break from six-style chatter for a minute, and let's let Matt, also known as Loki, give us an update on what's going on in the simulation scene, because there's a lot of news this week.
Last week, he drowned his students at the pool.
Yes, actually I do that very often.
It's just very fun to kill them off.
But anyway, I have an update.
SoCalKicks has retracted the question.
Okay, you can have your pen, send me proof.
Okay, in the sim world, boards are still down, still have Team Guilo down, still have the Melting Pot down, and also the actual DWI official board down, but there's a bunch of mirrors out there.
Really no updates as far as programs go, there was a small update to Dance With Intensity 2.0, it's now 2.003, which I haven't really seen any changes.
The video still doesn't work in the background for me, so that kind of sucks, I'm very disappointed.
One major news thing is actually going to be with DDR East Coast Invasion or their website ddrei.com.
They're having their second DWI Tourney Mix 2.
It's going to be running for the whole month of August.
And there's actually a few different things you can enter in.
They're going to have a light, standard, and heavy entries you can do.
Light is for people that are just getting into making DWIs.
Standard is, you know, basic, you know, anyone that's kind of seasoned doing DWIs.
And then heavy is just for the elite, which I'll be entering in because, you know.
No one has the ego here.
You doubles know.
I'm actually thinking about entering one of these edit contests just because I'm pretty bored.
So, I mean, hell, we got this show off the ground.
What's that say about free time?
No life plus no talent gets you a talk show.
And I did rip that line from Space Coast Coast to Coast, thank you.
It's being said in the chat room, Pyroman is saying, hey, rumor here that Stepmania Beta 5 out very soon, possibly tomorrow.
Have you heard anything about that?
No, I haven't, but hopefully it'll work a little bit better this time.
See, the only thing that I like about Step Mania is it's got a lot of nifty, shiny stuff in it.
You know, they have the new features as far as, like, modifiers you can use, songs.
But the thing I really hate about it is, because I have a huge song collection, it takes forever to load the damn thing up.
I can sit there for about five minutes watching the thing scroll by because it's reading all my songs.
and it just takes forever.
Whereas, like, you know, back in the days with even, um, Delight Delight Reduplication, one of the old simulators, what it does is it scans, you scan your music list and it'll build a list and that way it loads instantly every time.
Same with, uh, DWIs.
Same thing.
And, you know, Step Mania is kind of dumbed it down where it scans your music list every time.
So it takes forever.
So if they just fix that, then maybe, you know, I might go over to Step Mania, but I'm sticking with DWI for now.
Oh, I was going to ask our guests some questions, but they ran in the other room to go play Six Style.
So that's all on the simulation front then for now?
That's it until all the boards come back up.
Hopefully they won't have any more bandwidth issues with Team Guilo, because I love reading that board for the news, and then when that goes down, so does the Melting Pot and DWI.
Paul, you've been awfully quiet all night.
Do you have anything you want to add?
I've been out of town this week, so I'd just like to tell anyone who goes through the Santa Cruz Boardwalk to not go to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, because the arcade in there is pretty bad.
The only thing there for Nostalgia is Beatmania Complete Mix.
It's kind of fun to play for Metal Gear Solid, the remix there.
And then they do have Percussion Freaks, but no chair.
So if you want to play Percussion Freaks 4th Mix with no chair, standing up, you'll get real sore, but you'll have fun.
It's kind of a new thing there.
I have an announcement.
I have a donut.
Donuts are good for you.
They're full of chocolate vitamins.
Seriously.
We're going to take a quick break because everything is getting distracted now with 6th style.
It's top of the hour anyway.
We're going to take a quick break and we will come right back.
I have to give a few plugs before we go to break though.
A few things.
SoCalKicks.com is now up and running.
SoCalKicks, he has a cool little site there.
And Jamie's edits are up there, which you can go download.
They're very cool.
And all sorts of news and things like that, especially, as is in the name, about SoCal.
So, SoCalKicks.com, you can visit that.
If you haven't heard it yet, we do have an original work by Kiel in rotation this week on the website.
So, I'm sorry, on the Bimani Music & More program.
So, do listen in on the Bimani Music & More program, which runs 24 hours a day on the station when we're not live.
And we're starting to take some original works and remixes.
of Bomani stuff.
So if you have anything you want to add for that, send it to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com or any comments and things you want to give on the show, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
And because I did promise, so I'd like to say hi to Ash because you said you'd be listening tonight.
And thank you for helping boost us listeners in your area.
And hello to everybody who's deciding to listen tonight and we really appreciate the support.
Yes, thanks everybody for listening tonight.
Awesome.
And also 2DXstyle.net is up and running once again.
And they've got a nice little button for us on there.
That was really awesome.
I wasn't expecting to see that.
So thanks to them for supporting us.
And we'll support you best we can.
So do go visit their site.
They're trying to build a location page of every 2DX machine in the nation.
And it's fairly up to date from what I'm being told.
So go take a look at that if you get a moment.
Okay, we're going to go to break.
And we will be right back.
Thank you for watching!
Well, I'm a chemist.
I leave the lab ready to explore.
I drop the pump for five rhymes like no one has before.
I kick the notes and verbs in my speech when I flow.
Adam's Moon Soapbox
Well I'm a chemist, I'm in the lab ready to explore I drop the fuck the fat rhymes like no one has before I kick the melted verbs in my speech when I'm flubbed I'm not like a devil that sucks you for the dough or the drugs So he can teach a tribe in the veins I keep the low-pro makin' ends with my friends Free skills, oh shit, I'm flubbin' with mad styles Don't even try to step on my lyrics, I'm mad foul

Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Here's one of the songs that they skipped over for Parapara Paradise that was from Initial D. This is Dave Rogers running in the 90s.
Parapara Paradise
Thank you for watching!
All I Wanna Get Is You
Get your money going
The Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Balls
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio live as we are.
Gosh, I'm just not being friendly with Winamp tonight, are we?
I think I'm going to shoot this thing in the head.
Rob is held mesmerized by our sponsor, the Swedish chef.
You know what?
We just threw a fish at him and Rob went crazy.
I think Winamp's mad at me because when I logged in today it said, upgrade me, and I said, no, I need to have a show to do.
Mine tells me that every day.
I think it's protesting.
I think it wants to disown me.
I want to say a big hello to everybody in the chat room right now over on irc.egheads.org or if you just download MIRC you're just going to want to connect to any other side IRC server and we're in Channel Orange Lounge.
We're joined tonight by some special guests.
We've got a whole bunch of our regulars here and also from out of town we've got Mel B and Melody.
So, everybody's kind of running in and out, though, playing Sixth Style as well.
Kind of seeing what's going on there.
I don't know, what do you want to talk about now, Jamie?
I'm kind of running out of things to discuss.
Well, we're thinking of having a news segment, you know, to sort of, again, focus on the and more part of our radio show.
Yes.
The weekly anime review, which, you know, I think I'm going to review something pretty old school that Mel brought up earlier today.
My review of Lupin the Third.
Hey, more DDR2.
Yeah, hey.
Castle of Cagliostro.
One of the best anime ever.
You know, I see people who are going off on, oh, Hellsing is cool, which it is.
I saw Hellsing for the first time last night.
Oh, Hellsing owns, but we're reviewing old stuff.
Okay.
And this is also another reference to old school gamers here.
Who happens to remember the game Cliffhanger that sort of played like Dragon's Lair and Dragon's Lair 2 and that other sort of weird game that featured the cowboy?
I don't remember that game offhand, but it was time something.
Anyway, the whole thing with Castle Cagliostro is, I don't know how many people have actually watched the Lupin TV series, which was really awesome, but basically it features him going after a crime syndicate that's been responsible for the counterfeiting for centuries, even, funding wars.
and going after, but there's also a little mystery and a little bit of romance attached to that.
You know, I'd recommend, it's definitely something that if you rent it once, you'll definitely want to buy it.
And, you know, certainly for people who love old school anime.
And it's Miyazaki, right?
Yes, it was directed by Miyazaki.
Can't go wrong with Miyazaki.
And Miyazaki, for people who don't know him by name, is the man behind Studio Ghibli.
As in Princess Mononoke, Laputa, Nazca, that's another one too.
Oh yeah, and even before that, that was Monkey Punch, right?
Yes, Monkey Punch is responsible for Lupin.
Yeah, that was before he went to Studio Ghibli?
No, no, no.
Monkey Punch is the one who did the Lupin comics, who created the character, and also, of course, was responsible for the early animation.
Castle Cagliostro was actually directed by Miyazaki.
So, yes, you know, more of my useless anime trivia.
Hey, it's cool.
Well, it's another one of my mutant powers.
So we were talking about a few weeks ago on the show.
Actually, I think it was one of the shows you weren't here, though.
We were talking about DDR and anime.
What's the correlation?
Actually, no, I think it was your first show back we started talking about this.
What is the connection?
It seems like a lot of... Besides the obvious, they're both from Japan reference, you know.
What is their... Why does there seem to be this connection between anime and DDR?
Well, you know...
I have often thought that, and you don't necessarily have to be into one to be in the other, but I've noticed that a lot of people are into both.
Can you say otaku?
Otaku.
Thank you.
And for the people who actually really don't know what that means, it's someone who actually sits at home and doesn't go anywhere.
That is the literal reference.
Otaku means home.
Yes, otaku means home.
For people who misuse the word otaku, it actually is, in slang terms, it means somebody who stays in their house all day and never goes out, just sits with their anime.
I know people like that.
For those that are in the chat room right now, I have to point out that Kiel posted a very funny picture.
It kind of reminded me of the movie Office Space, where he's beating the crap out of his old Macintosh here with a hammer.
It's like about...
0.2 seconds before impact here.
Melody seems to be sad here as the Mac fan.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
I'm the only Macintosh user and I must say that shocks and saddens me.
There you go.
I remember being 11 or 12 and doing tech support for my school on those old apples.
Oh, it is a pick.
Oh, it's moving.
It kind of looked like a hammer at first glance from far away.
It looks like the pick is already through the monitor there on the screen.
My bad.
And now, a moment of silence to mourn the loss of one more Macintosh.
Three, three, three, oh, snap.
Oh, poor Melody.
Oh, I promised Irene she could get a second here to share a thought.
So now I'd like to do a segment called Irene's Thought of the Day.
So here we go.
Deep Thoughts by Irene.
Here comes Irene.
Here she is.
I thought you were going to do this.
Oh, I was just going to let everyone know that procrastination is like masturbation.
You know, it feels good until you realize that you've fucked yourself.
That was deep.
That was very deep.
Thank you, thank you so much for that.
And remember, wash your hands.
I know it's a little late, I know it's a little late, Irene, but... You got some ha-ha's from the chatroom, though.
She says thank you, chatroom.
You know, that was actually, though, a very interesting point.
That is actually very true.
Well, thank you.
Yes, it is.
As Rob stares at me and blinks at me.
Are we just going to talk about masturbation the rest of the show, then, or what's the deal?
Masturbation.
Oh, we're losing listeners.
Dear God, no.
Bomani, Bomani.
No, no, don't you notice that sex brings, you know, in listeners, you know, spank, spank, spank, whatever.
Irene, want to tell us some more about masturbation?
Irene goes, okay, and comes on over.
What do you want to know?
Tell us about masturbation.
Well, I think masturbation, the definition of masturbation is pleasing yourself sexually.
I think so.
And I think guys do it more.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know.
I don't watch people do it.
But I think they do it more.
You know, it's kind of like gin rummy.
It's like, you don't need a partner if you got a good hand.
Yes, exactly.
Oh, God, are we going to make a bunch of, like, obscure quotes now or something?
Sexual quotes now?
Dude, I need good sound bites for the show, so just keep this bit going.
I don't got, there's nothing else DDR, 2DX, whatever to talk about.
You know, it can be done with things that you find at the grocery store, too.
Pork fat.
I heard Crisco from somebody once.
Chicken burrito.
For a girl?
No, from one of my ex-boyfriends.
No, I mean like the stuff you can use, a girl can use this stuff.
I don't think a girl really needs to use anything, do they?
Your mama.
I know you didn't talk about mama.
Okay, and now that we've completely crashed Timber.
Yeah, let's get back to Bomani before everyone throws up.
Yeah, okay.
Here you go, Rob.
And of course, Rob has to play Sexy Planet.
Gee, wow, that poor Mac died.
And how about them coal miners?
They're all happy.
Let me run to the list here.
Oh, yes, let's talk about music.
Music that we...
I need music.
Besides the Bee-Mani series, what is some music that you all like to listen to?
No, I got criticized last week for not talking like the announcer, going, Bee-Mani!
It's Konami's famous Bee-Mani series!
Well, you know, the announcer is wrong, too.
You know the announcer is wrong, too.
It's Bee-Mani.
Also, the announcer in Max 2 doesn't speak Japanese very well, but still.
I just got out.
Anyway, well, all right, music.
So I'll tell you what, let's run it around.
What's everybody listening to this week?
You know, when I was driving home from San Francisco today, I listened to a new radio station over there, 92.7, which is like just dance music all day.
I'm having this, like, I'm liking a lot of new trance music lately, like that Heaven song that they play on the radio all the freaking time, and these other songs.
I'm liking that right now.
I know it's played out, but I like it.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
I was also listening to the 92.7, the dance, coming back from San Francisco today.
Good stuff.
And I just fell asleep then.
Some good shit, huh?
Some good shit.
How about our guests?
What are you kids listening to?
And also, I should ask you guys this, because you weren't here for this show.
What songs do you think should be in a... Thank you, Dave.
What songs do you think should be in a Bomani game that aren't?
Well, as for what I'm listening to, it's rather eclectic.
Normally, one of the things I've been digging a lot lately is the new Red Hot Chili Pepper CD.
That's a really good CD.
I think I just turn on By The Way and listen to that track over and over again.
I don't even know how many times, but it's really mellow, but it's quite good, and then most of the time I'm driving, I'll let Mel throw in whatever CD he wants, so it's just kind of whatever he chooses.
I guess for my musical taste, it's sort of kind of run around.
Actually, I guess my first love always will be sort of like the 80s British Invasion, New Wave movement.
I was, you know, I was one of those kids born on MTV.
My cousin had Betamax and like taped MTV three hours a day, bring it over, and you know, I was like sucked in, so...
It's that and my second love would probably have to be the 90s New Jack Swing movement.
I mean, everyone loves cross colors and hats worn backwards with their tags still in them and hammer pants and BBD and all that good schmazz.
I guess that just really says I really don't really dig much of today's music, which is not to say there isn't good ones, but back then, it's not just the fact that music was good, but I guess it's just all the memories that come along with it.
That's one of the big things about music.
and so on.
I was going back through my playlists and I found Mr. E's Beautiful Blues, which was on Road Trip, by the Eels, though.
And I found a lot of songs I liked by them, so I actually got all four of their CDs and listened to a lot of that.
And I went to the They Might Be Giants concert.
I had their latest CD, No, and I've gotten two more.
Now, actually, in the chat room, one of our chatters right now, 3FeetElite, also went to the They Might Be Giants concert, so he actually brought that up as well.
Great concert.
It was a lot of fun.
They rocked out on a lot of songs I didn't expect, and it was really a new experience.
This is the second one I've been to, besides Red Hot Chili Peppers, so it was a lot of fun.
What was their best song they performed?
Your favorite of their performances?
You've heard Robot Parade, it's sort of mellowed out.
They actually rocked out on that a lot.
And there's one called On the Drags, which is a Rarity's album I got from them, which is just sort of normal rock, but they did it really well.
It was a lot of fun.
I'm listening to a full spectrum of stuff.
I've been listening to this George Acosta CD I had, and it's just some trance music and stuff, and I'm also listening to KMFDM.
Ah, cool.
Attack.
Here, go ahead and repeat that from the microphone.
Well, you know, back when I was working at Industrial Station, I was working at KSJS for San Jose State, and one of our favorite jokes going around was, KMFDM stood for Kill Motherfucking Depeche Mode.
Well, for the people who can't hear what's going on away from the microphone...
I'm sure for people who have been reading the What Are You Listening To Now thread on Psych by Money or who have talked to me since I came back from Anime Expo,
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
It's like, my whole big thing with J-Rock lately has been, it's like listening, it's got the same feel that a lot of the good 80s rock had.
And they've really gone overboard with the glam if you're into the visual K. So, for all the J-Rock fans out there, there's a lot of us now.
Okay, I was being told by the chatroom, I was given this link and said, don't click this link, what did they say, if you've been eating?
If you've been eating.
Okay, here we go.
Let's see what this takes us to.
That's horrible.
This is a family show.
I do not think I'll be eating a cherry muffin anytime soon.
That was worse than Goatsy.
That was worse.
There are a few things that I could consider worse than that.
Why?
Why?
Why did you do that?
Why?
I think my eyes are bleeding.
Okay, let's explain for those listeners out there what we just saw.
I'm picturing...
I'm picturing a five year old kid crossing a street covered in broken glass and ten UPS fans hit him all at once and they poured popcorn on him or something and some cherry syrup.
It was pretty bad.
I guess I know when to go... No, no, Dave is asking us to look at this again.
I guess I know when to go to the bathroom now.
Good timing there.
Yay, yay, pictures.
Yeah, I don't think we're going to... No.
Goat's Day was bad enough.
Anyway, moving right along.
How about some show news?
Show news.
Some Orange Lounge show news.
Next week on the show, as if... We're starting to get guests here.
We're joined by Mel B and Melody this week.
Are you guys having a good time?
I hope you're having a good time.
Oh man, we're just kicking it.
It's great.
That's all we do here.
We just kind of sit around and talk.
Just lounging in the Orange Lounge.
We're just chilling.
Yes.
Next week, we're going to have some special guests, but I'm not allowed to tell you who they are.
You can go ahead and say who.
I can?
Well, if they tell me I can, then I will.
But we're going to be... I can tell you this much.
There's some more Bay Area friends of ours that are going to be coming to visit, and there's two of them.
So we'll tell you that much.
And if they want to reveal themselves, then we'll tell you all.
And we're very happy to have them here.
Well, when we do...
We'll tell you guys during the break.
Yeah, if you were here, part of our live studio audience, you will know.
The live experience is truly something that people can live with.
This is the only way you're going to get all the inside jokes, really.
You know, I think one day we're going to, well, I already have said, you know, I've got the kit to go out to tournaments, and I was actually going to do this at CVGL, but unfortunately some personal life things got in the way, and I wasn't able to cover the tournament.
Rob was asleep.
I wasn't able to cover the tournament, so later we'll be going out, Jamie and I, when we go out to places, we'll take the live remote with us and interview random people.
But hopefully one day, we're going to broadcast this show live from somewhere else, like a tournament or something.
We'll be in the bathroom, Ms.
Vigil.
Broadcast, coming to you live from the bathroom at AI.
Dude, who farted?
Anyway, you know, just make sure that you don't eat in the snack bar before that.
You'll be fine.
So...
So I think now's a good break time.
How's that sound?
We'll take one more break.
Do I get to break stuff?
Then we'll come back.
We've got about a half hour show left, so we'll take another quick break, come back, wrap up the show, and put the nail in the coffin of this week's Orange Lounge.
And let's see, what did I promise the chatroom, or what did I promise chatroom my play for?
You promised long train running for our chatroom.
I promised long train running, didn't I?
Okay, we're going to start it off with some long train running here on Orange Lounge Radio.
All recommendations
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Oh, crap, we went into dead air there for a minute.
My bad.
We're sorry.
I'm going... Jeez, tonight's just the night of Rob messing everything up, isn't it?
Technical poopy.
SOK, Rob, we still love you.
I'm just going to guess where we were in the song.
Irene said, who's we?
Who's we?
After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree head first.
Undersedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.
Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UndersedationLive.org.
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Because Bongo demands it.
We got one of my roommate's friends, apparently just got back.
What do you think of this whole thing?
You know what Dance Dance Revolution is, correct?
Yes, I've played a couple times.
But you have no freaking clue why people get obsessed with it, right?
No.
So, knowing that you've got tons of Bomani freaks and addicts listening right now, what do you have to say about Bomani?
What do you think about it?
What the hell is it?
All the DDRs, all the Dance Dance Revolution and button-pounding games.
You guys are just a bunch of freaks.
Thank you!
Yes, thank you very much.
Alright.
Get out of here.
Get lost.
I don't want to see you.
Alright.
Anyway.
Meanwhile... He just doesn't know.
He's not in the know.
Okay, I was told over the break that I am allowed to announce our guests that are coming next week.
So...
Our guests next week will be Jazz and DDR Mike.
We'll be here in the house next week in the studio.
DDR Mike is, I don't know, he's DDR Mike.
He plays in Concord.
They're both Concord peoples.
We have more Step Squad people, you know, more Step Squad to hang out with me.
Yay.
Alright, woo!
So they'll be here next week.
I won't be alone anymore.
They'll get to plug whatever they want and talk about whatever.
Because we let our guests plug things.
Does anybody else want to plug something in the house?
That's good, yay.
Hair dryer, toaster, personal massage.
Anyway... We have a request for a toaster and a personal massage.
A vibrator?
Alright.
Anyway...
Back to DDR Talk.
Matt wanted to talk about his latest conquest in the DDR world, so let's talk about that.
Well, right now what I've been trying to do, because I'm really big into the editing and the edit hacking, two things that are on the list, one probably before the other.
The first one is going to be getting 30 second steps in DDR.
I'm pretty close to doing it, just have to actually test the file first.
And the second one will be making Max 2 exclusive songs, finding the machine ID for that.
So that's another thing that's on my list.
I was hoping to have the 30 second steps done by today, but I fell behind.
So maybe next week.
That is all.
For anyone who can full combo with a 90% perfect attack on my Look to the Sky edit, it's called Free Fall.
You get a nice, lovely little GameCube pin.
First person who sends me proof gets it.
And then there's the one for my DXY edit, Another, which basically is really evil.
And one second place in that lovely Hell edit contest that Matt had.
Okay.
You will be taken out to dinner.
So the one for that is if you full combo it or 90% perfect attack it.
Either or, I will take you out to a nice dinner with a decent limit on what you can get.
Will it be a candlelight dinner?
Oh, baby.
You get smoothed.
There's going to be wine and cheese and corn.
There will be bread also.
And cloth napkins.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Now, you know, I'm referring to, you know, I'm not going to take you out to like a four-star restaurant, you know, but maybe two and a half.
You know, I'll take you out to sushi or, you know, maybe Outback if you're lucky.
You know, of course, I won't be touching the meat, but, you know.
and anyone who can full combo it or get a 90% perfect attack on my another edit will get a nice meal from me.
Oh, you guys are going to love it when I find 30 second notes.
I've been planning, actually, the edit I made today that I was going to test, but it got cut off.
It has at the very end all eight arrows come down at the same time, or relatively close to the same time.
It's funny just to watch.
That's when you have a seizure on the pad.
Of course, you know the involuntary bow movements are prohibited.
So, and also, I am going to be, now that I have Max at home, I am going to be working on my other, my next tell edit, probably to Waka Waka.
Because, you know, I want to do just this insanely evil... Wait, how can you do a Waka Waka edit with Max 1?
Oh, it wasn't in there.
You mean Blonde Girl?
Okay, well, forget it.
I want to pick a super cute, happy song and then do something evil to it.
So, hey, if anybody wants me to make a hell edit and name it after them, pick me a song and I will make you an edit to it.
This is what happened when Jamie realized that Waka Waka was not in DDR Max 1.
Oh my goodness, I can't believe it.
Everything's ruined.
You want me to kick you?
Somebody give me some... Where's the Clifford Ball?
The Clifford Ball's in the other studio.
We're in the big studio night.
The Clifford Ball's in the little studio.
You know, I bought this Clifford Ball two weeks ago to throw it at Rob, and I haven't done it yet.
It, like, lives here now, so... Mwahaha.
So... But, you know... I can just play random sound effects the rest of the show.
Are you gay?
But, you know, everybody who at least, you know, posts on the Sackman Money forums know that Rob is our Big Gay Chili.
When you were born, I think you looked like a chili.
Anyway, enough with the sound effects.
Yes, enough with the sound effects.
I'm not allowed to have fun here.
We are a serious talk show.
Let's talk about the future.
What other tournaments are you going to be attending in the future?
For me, I don't know exactly what big ones are coming up.
I guess there's the one at Mountain Mike's that's coming up next month.
I'll probably mosey into that.
I don't know if I'll compete or not.
It's kind of hard to say right now.
I was going to go to the Midwest Showdown, which is next month, but things sort of came through.
In other words, meaning I'm a broke-ass.
So, I was going to have a huge routine for that, but I guess I'll use it for whenever's clever.
The only one that I know that's... Actually, Triple Threat is the one I'll be going to next.
Because that's on August 1st and 2nd over at Sunnyvale Golf Land.
Check that out.
I believe, yeah, DDR Spot's going to be blowing up the spot with that one.
Okay, I have to ask, though.
Thursday and Friday, what's up with that?
Well, let's see...
Well, the main thing about trying to schedule a tournament on Saturday and Sunday, what a lot of people forget is Golfland is all about the birthday parties and all those kind of things, and that's first priority.
Thursday and Friday night, I mean, it's summertime.
Most people that get off work around 5 or so, and it just kind of works.
It's the best thing we can do for now.
Are they going to be doing it at night?
As far as I know, yeah, like late afternoon into the night.
I kind of want to go, but unfortunately I've got to work, and when you add a drive on top of that, it's not going to be very much fun for me to get out there.
But I wish you guys the best of luck.
It does sound like an awesome tournament.
Very innovative new stuff that you guys are going to be doing there.
Thank you.
I hope it does go well.
But that's part of the thing about the tournament stats, especially Mike No Runs.
It's gone to a point where we've kind of seen, okay, everyone's skill and all that, but there's only so much...
P.A.
Tournament
Oh, absolutely.
That's freestyle to me, to make an analogy, it's like the NBA slam dunk contest.
So, it's not something that has to go hand in hand, you know, you've got to have your PA and your freestyle.
It's cool to have them.
Because even at the PA only tournaments, it seems like there's always a little freestyle on the side.
Oh, yeah, well, freestyle... It's like you get a free cup of freestyle.
Yeah, exactly.
It's just a hint of, you know, just like in some freestyle tournaments, some people who PA think their PA-ing looks good, and no, it doesn't.
What are some things in freestyle that piss you off?
Or make you upset?
Melody's hitting the... You have something you want to say.
That would be the hand slaps and the knee drops.
I don't know.
It's gotten to the point where... Actually, I've gone through quite a few tourneys where I haven't seen that many hand slaps or knee drops.
I kind of miss them.
Does that mean we'll see them in your next routine?
I don't know.
If I get there to do it, I will do it.
Maybe I'll have to dare.
Okay, I dare you on this show right here.
Next, next routine.
Hand slaps and knee drops.
Not only, not only.
As your finish, as your finish.
Alright, just so we got a few witnesses in here.
In the last ten seconds, alright.
Hand shake deal.
There will be hand slaps and knee drops in my next routine.
Now this is a great deal because I don't have to do a damn thing.
I just get to point at them and make fun of them.
Yeah, seriously, I guess, though, things that, I guess, make me mad about freestyle, it's not so much... There's really nothing that makes me mad, just the only thing I get in order is people who really don't put in effort to, like, entertain the crowd.
It's... The only good thing about that is that they've made the pot fatter for the winner, but past that, it's a waste of time, really, for judges and for other people.
I mean, I guess if they get a cheap throw out of it and they paid their money, I suppose it's all good, but past that...
What would you rather see, you know, something that's really good improv or something that's been taken time to choreograph?
Well, I think choreography definitely because not only does it show skill, but it also shows that, you know,
Like, instead of coming up with something on the spot, it comes up with a thought, and of course you go through all the goods and bads, and it's like a polished product.
Improv, some people can make it look good, you know, it's not easy, but at the same time, in improv, you pretty much have your bread and butter, you have one style and you stick with it, whereas in a choreograph, you can kind of integrate all sorts of little things into one big extravaganza.
Now, in the chatroom, they said, okay, dare him to do slaps and knee drops on Dynamite Rave.
And I said, okay, no, we gotta draw the line somewhere.
That's a little much.
I mean, at least doing the hand drops and knee slaps, whatever.
I know, at least let me do it to, like, uh, well, what's that, D2R, I guess?
You know, at least make it, you know, get what you want.
D2R!
And surprisingly, after looking at those steps, they actually look very freestyle-able.
Not that I'd do it, but after this bit, I guess, damned now, you know?
Well, actually, you know, speaking of songs, what do you think is the best freestyle song in Max 2?
As far as the new stuff.
Secret Rendezvous.
I would definitely put that up.
Because it's slow enough that you can put an extra beat in between all the notes, and so you can do more stuff.
What would you think?
Well I think Secret Rendezvous actually on double bass kick is like double light is probably the best thing because especially for some people who play pump it up a lot there's a lot of it has sort of a five arrow thing where it's like the two middle and then you have like the ups and downs so there are some people who if they rock at pump it up they could like totally tear that up.
I guess a new song actually Spin the Disc is still my favorite.
I may not be laughing on the outside, but inside I know I'm just doing cartwheels over that one.
I'm being suggested by the chatroom that A Minute is also a good freestyle song.
They're saying that Secret Rendezvous is a song about lesbians.
Didn't we talk about that on the show a few weeks ago?
It is a lesbian song.
Uh-oh, we have the Brad rant.
Here comes Brad with his secret rendezvous rant.
Okay, I'm sure we'd all like to think it's about lesbians, but it does say in the song, he is mine or something like that.
Unless it's a dyke, a bull dyke, then okay, I guess that'll pass.
Transsexual.
See, Secret Rendezvous, it doesn't take away the coolness of freestyle by having it about lesbians.
It makes it even cooler.
And So Fabulous, So Fierce is also another good song for freestyle.
I think that just really goes to show how really important it is to have great commercial songs in a DDR, any kind of, like, the Monty game.
It's those songs that you're kind of familiar with, like, A Minute or, you know, so fast.
It's like songs from the 70s, a lot of us who, you know, grew up in that era or, like, you know, were kids and reminisce on that song.
That's why I think, you know, commercial songs, especially, you know, if America got with it, you know,
Although we've heard from the DDR Max from E3 for America, there's going to be commercial songs on there as well, instead of Konami, which was a great mix by the way, but all Konami originals.
This one's going to be new, it's going to have some new stuff that's never been anywhere else.
I think KOA might be catching up.
You think it's going to go the way of Euromex though?
Because I noticed there was a new little deal there where they signed, they had some Zomba record stuff.
So does that mean we're going to get Britney in USDDR?
Because Britney was on Zomba.
They already have the Britney's Dance Mix.
I don't think that they need to integrate it.
And I just want to say for a record, Britney's Downspeed is a hard freaking game.
No, that is a ridiculously easy game.
It's like, the hardest song probably has the equivalent difficulty of maybe a three-footer.
I want to know why you two have been playing this game.
Dude, shoot yourselves now, go to hell, oh my god.
Freedom Pass from Blockbuster!
And then I had to get it because, you know, it's ridiculously stupid.
That's right, Brad, Britney's easy to find for all you haters out there, Brad.
How can you live with yourself?
I mean, you have to go up to the cash register and say, I want to rent Britney's Dance, whatever the fuck that was.
Actually, I played it at E3 when they were demoing it, and the funny thing was, it's like, they had to challenge you in a dance pad if you get the highest score.
Not only did I get the highest score, I beat the freaking guys who were demoing the game, so I thought that was just comedy in itself.
The only thing that would make me even want to get that game is my absolute love for the first two Bust a Move games.
In fact, well, I haven't necessarily played Dance Summit, but, you know, it is not Bust a Groove, it is Bust a Move, goddammit.
Okay, there's Spikey of the Week number three.
Yeah, I know, but this was from something last night, I was wearing my Bust a Groove, sorry, Bust a Move shirt, and somebody in Jamla Juice said, is that from Bust a Groove?
Oh, I love that game, and I was like, yeah, and I called her a dork and she got all upset.
No, um, oh, the only reason that I would buy the, uh, Britney's dance beat is so I could watch Britney Spears in skimpy outfits without having to watch it on MTV.
It's animated, Dave.
Dude, it's animated video.
Just download porn, Dave.
Get on the net and download porn.
Hey, I do.
Alright, thank you.
Maybe we should get someone to hook you up with a copy of Final Fuck X or something.
Well, you know, she was... Your HP tastes so good.
HP got lazy.
Well, you know, she was flipping off a lot of her fans in Mexico and stuff, and if she just keeps doing that and she loses popularity, maybe she'll turn to porn.
There you go.
First of all, if she fell off the face of the planet and went the way of Mariah Carey, I'd be happy.
I know, but the fact is, no one cares
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
One of the ones I got actually recently for my sim was the Metal Gear Solid theme, and I'm also very pleased to see that someone made double steps for it, so I can't wait to play that one when I get my pads working again.
But yeah, definitely want to see some more stuff ported from Beatmania over, so I'm pretty excited to see what they're going to have.
Yeah, well, I know one of them for sure is Overblast, because actually when I saw the trailer for Max for USA, that was the theme music they were using, and Jason Eno, who we all know is the product manager of EDR, had told me about that.
I also want to see Hellscraper.
Hellscape, whatever!
Why don't you use that, just play Mr. Bassman on Disney Mix, man, it's fast enough and doggone it.
That song sucks!
Hey, let's not call people names here, dickhead.
No, the Hellscaper... Ducking Hardcore Mix.
Dude, I don't really like Hellscaper that much.
Oh, Dave, did you play the simulator he had for the steps for it?
Yes, I did.
It was good, man.
I'd rather play V for the simulator something.
Tank, that song rocked.
I haven't played that one.
I'm still voting for Total Recall.
I'd like to throw in my vote for Baby Bay Give Me Your Love 2001, the remix that they have on Beatmania 7th Mix.
That is the most awesomest freaking thing ever.
And for the people who, you know, you might get a taste of Total Recall in a minute.
But, you know, I think that there are so many good songs, though, that, you know, you had to imagine, you know, the staff, the people who choose the songs of Konami of Japan just sitting there going, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what do we pick, what do we pick, what do we pick, what do we pick?
Because there's just so much good stuff.
It's really hard to narrow it down, I think.
I personally would like to see them, though, just instead of going back into their archive, just kind of make some new stuff up.
Just let LED go to town and I'll be happy.
That's fine with me.
TAC, let them go to town.
Then, you know, go visit some of those.
Just like how in Japan they have the Dance Mania series.
They're hooked up with Toshiba EMI and all that.
Why don't you let them go to town with some people that put out the compilations here?
Like maybe the Ultimate Dance Party or the Trans Party compilations here.
That would be pretty cool.
I think if DDR just went off the Dance Mania Diamond Millennium hit by whoever's left all in one mix that one double CD all in one mix I think that would be the most greatest thing in the world
or, you know, like they did with Parapara, hook up with Avex and throw some of the Avex stuff into DDR.
The music that I've put out, you know, sponsored by Avex Tracks, was just some absolutely awesome stuff.
Now, I know this was in Disney Mix, but I'd still, I know, just for comic value, I'd like to see Night of Fire in another DDR mix with that guy Bucky in the background as the...
That's the video.
Well, you weren't here for it.
That was my VCD that I had.
Oh, that's why I was off shuffling through AX.
Oh, yeah.
They should show the one, the turn and beat around video they did where he does this little thing with his hands and blows this one chick's skirt up.
It was great.
Is that the guy whose theme music was Night of Fire every time he showed up?
Yes, that guy rocks.
Rob told me about this one.
That sounds like... He's my idol.
You gotta have goals Hello, I'm a panda Alright, we're getting ready to wrap up the show So I leave Melody, Mel B, you guys have any final comments you'd like to leave us with?
I just wanted to thank you guys for having me on board.
I thought this place is just pretty dope.
I'd like to come in on a more regular basis, actually.
And for everyone else out there, keep freestyling, PA'ing, whatever the hell you do.
Just don't give me that funk or anything else.
I don't want to catch the VD or herpes or all that other stuff.
and check out ddrspot.com, come to Triple Thread and if nothing else, just be true to yourself and well, gosh, I'm terrible at these inspirational speeches.
Be excellent to each other.
Party on.
We're always glad to have you guys on whenever you feel like coming back.
Yeah, definitely.
Come back anytime, you guys.
You're always welcome.
Even next week, if you guys happen to come to the party Saturday.
Oh, I didn't say that over the air, did I?
No.
My roommate's back there going, Oh, God!
Oh, yeah, yes.
I'd like to announce that we'll be hopefully making a trip down to Pleasanton Cusar on the 10th next week to do Sack Attack 3.
We will have Team Sack back.
Take that back.
Anyways, so we'll be down there.
I heard that they just got a brand new fifth mix machine, so I'll be willing to break that in and kick anyone's ass in Cusar.
I will take the Orange Lounge remote to that location.
So if you guys want to meet us there and talk to us and make a cameo on the show, that would be great.
Maybe we should make a mention of our exploits from the first Team Sack.
It should be from probably about 7pm to midnight.
We'll probably do like a half day pass in there on that Saturday.
So just come on down and say hi.
You'll definitely recognize us.
Oh, yes.
We'll be the ones beating everybody.
Next week on the show, we have, don't forget, we've got Jazz and DDR Mike are going to be joining us, and they're some of the regulars over in Concord.
So they'll be joining us next week to talk about Lord knows what, but they'll be able to plug whatever they want.
I guess that's it.
Any last thoughts, Jamie?
I want another donut.
Alright, goodnight everybody.
Thanks for being here.
We're going to have to do our fortune cookie message on the fly tonight, so we might get one more fuck up before the show's over, but we're going to try it.
I don't fuck up.
What are you talking about?
Goodnight everybody.
No, not that.
It's the sound part.
You'll do just fine.
Here we go.
Let's try it.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura, and Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
Because I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, no one gives a fuck.
And as a special bonus, because I was too fucking lazy to edit the sound file, last week's fortune cookie message of the day.
Kids, that glue you use in school, it's made from dead horses.
No, Wilbur, it's just a sprain.
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
