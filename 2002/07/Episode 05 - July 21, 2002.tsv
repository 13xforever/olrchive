2228	4750	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5371	8233	Our live talk program begins now.
19922	29910	Orange Lounge Radio may contain sexual and adult content and many instances of the F-word, which is not safe for children.
44423	46864	God damn you, stop calling here.
46924	48945	Isn't it 4215, pussy whee?
49365	50066	You bitch!
50126	53147	Now let me check that this goes 2-1-2, fuck you!
53167	54828	You have no morals, darling.
54928	59830	I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of herpes.
59850	62191	Kiss my great nooch.
62231	64612	Mecca lecca hi, mecca hi-dee-ho.
64692	66973	Oh my god, I hate throwing up in public.
67053	68193	Me too!
68454	68954	Fucker, yeah?
69194	70114	I'm working on it.
70835	71295	Loser.
71435	71935	Lame!
72335	73916	I'm the size of my face.
74881	79748	Breathing, breath, heaving breath, heaving whatever.
79808	85536	Now you all just sit there and keep your mouths shut while I go listen to my Britney Spears records.
85557	87019	I am your singing colleague.
91227	99074	Somewhere inside the state of California, in the great nation of the United States of America, on the planet Earth, Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.
99415	103438	You're tuned in to the Balamani Scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Balamani.
103859	105960	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
106061	109944	Joining me as always, my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.
110945	111505	How are you doing?
112026	112526	I am doing.
112847	113127	And you?
113387	114188	How are you, gentlemen?
114949	115509	All your best, sir.
115529	117010	We love you a lot.
118052	120933	This is episode number five for July the 21st of 2002.
121353	123734	We are joined in studio once again by many, many guests.
123774	124574	Say hello, everybody.
126514	128975	I'm going to introduce everybody one by one real fast.
129015	129635	We got Irene.
130735	131276	We have Brad.
132596	133336	We have Joe.
134296	134877	We have Dave.
136097	136797	We have Matt.
138037	138678	That's everybody.
139538	140378	We have Bradley.
141998	143339	Oh, Bradley's here, finally.
143359	143419	Wee!
144736	145456	Yes, he shows up.
145936	146657	Our moral support.
146677	148417	That's probably the only time you're going to hear him the whole show.
149978	154800	All right, we'll be talking to all our guests a little bit later, but first we're going to take a very quick break.
155720	156880	Any other opening thoughts?
157000	160541	I'm seeing this right now that I still love Bradley because he brought me a Twinbee book.
160782	161102	Ooh!
161542	162922	Twinbee is ownage.
163382	165483	Very neat, very neat.
165643	167344	I wish our webcam was working so I could show...
168954	174857	I wish I could show the elation here on the webcam, but unfortunately, if you do try to go to the webcam on our site, it isn't working right now.
174877	176298	But we will have that back next week.
176859	180401	Because we have a big, big show next week, and we'll talk more about that a little bit later.
180881	183602	I have to say, happy birthday, Joe Mama.
184143	184883	Happy birthday!
185163	186324	We're going to play some music right now.
186344	190086	We're going to start it off with something Jamie requested, which I think is very cool.
190366	191327	You want to introduce this for us?
192128	198476	This one is, I'm sure everyone is familiar with a particular song from 2DX Third Style by DJ Taka.
198496	199938	This one is remixed by Naoki.
200178	200399	Enjoy.
394467	395068	Thanks for watching!
454236	455597	Thank you for watching.
455637	457478	See you next time.
492213	500897	And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.
501137	502038	Do it all night.
502298	503158	Do it with me.
503599	505960	No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.
506000	507340	Do you take vocal lessons?
507420	508381	Kill your teacher!
508881	509882	In the heat of the night.
510342	512563	Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
513743	514404	I liked it.
514904	516445	Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
516565	516965	Next!
517908	524456	Um... That was cool... Do you even know why you're here?
524536	526218	That was just bloody pathetic!
526298	526758	Next!
527840	529662	Come on, Ava.
529702	531204	Come on, do it with me.
532085	532305	Yes!
532705	533346	Yes, that's it!
533686	534768	We have a winner!
535621	539403	A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
540164	544106	Yes, a star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
544866	548528	I just repeated myself, but that's okay, because I can do anything I want on this show.
549389	550469	We have the power.
550549	551810	We control the vertical.
551830	553611	There's no vertical or horizontal on the radio.
553911	555212	We control the audio.
555332	556733	I could drop everybody like that.
558081	558781	We're not going to do that.
558801	562222	No, I'm not going to do that because I noticed we're actually starting to get some listeners.
562242	563082	This is pretty cool.
563122	563643	I'm liking this.
563723	565163	And we love you all.
565263	568204	If you want to say hi to us, why don't you come join us in our chat room?
568504	572105	You're just going to get any IRC program, like MIRC is a popular one.
572405	579427	And then as your server, you're going to choose any other side IRC server, like irc.eggheads.org is one.
580027	586230	or you can join OthersideIRC.net, or I believe it's Caram at OthersideIRC.net.
586530	590011	And all you're going to do once you get on one of those servers, you're just going to join Channel Orange Lounge.
590771	592692	Some people seem to really like some music in that set.
593272	598755	The last set we had 0.59 by DJ Taka, but that was remixed by Naoki, a piano version there.
599435	600515	Seemed to be pretty well liked.
601075	604377	Also after that we had a very popular drum mania song, Dynamite.
605057	605778	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
634853	635273	Thank you, Jamie.
635294	635514	Well put.
635534	635794	Yay.
635994	636234	All right.
661599	664980	Boy, we've just got these big egos tonight.
665020	665780	I don't know what it is.
665840	666881	I think it's something in the air.
666941	667881	I don't have a big ego.
667901	668801	I'm intensely modest.
668901	670162	It's the California heat.
671602	673203	I have some big news for the show.
673803	677984	Next week on the show, we're going to have our very first special guests.
678465	678805	Guests.
678985	683486	Not just one special guest, but two special guests here on the show next week, next Sunday.
684246	686987	Would you care to tell them about our lovely guests we're going to have, Jamie?
687267	687548	I don't know.
687568	688768	Do you think we should make it a surprise?
688788	688848	Yes.
689249	692390	Well, I've already told half the people in this room, but nobody online knows, I don't think.
693070	693470	Okay.
693831	698512	Well, we're actually having over Melody and Mel B. Yep.
699352	705074	And they're going to be our guests on the show, and I get to clean house all week to be ready for them.
705975	706355	Oh, God.
706855	710936	I have to move everything out into the living room because this room is cramped as it is when we do the show here.
711136	713537	I'd have to say so, and quite toasty and moist.
714737	716338	Are you feeling a little moist tonight, Jamie?
717173	718313	Oh, every night on the show.
722034	723514	As Irene makes this face.
723974	726975	Orange Lounge Radio makes you moist as a snack cake.
729195	730015	You're squishy.
730415	731596	Anyway, yes.
732836	733076	No.
733816	737697	So next week should be a good show because Mel B will be here to talk about freestyle stuff.
737757	739697	I don't know what we'll talk to him about.
740217	741457	Maybe about his retirement.
741477	743598	Didn't he retire and then he kind of came back out of retirement?
743818	744478	Kind of like Jordan.
744638	744978	I don't know.
745840	746620	DarkSakura.com
766589	769190	In the chat room, they're asking, wasn't Mel B one of the Spice Girls?
769531	771332	No, we're not having that Mel B on the show.
771372	772032	God, no.
772652	775994	Unless I get to, you know, use her gigantic teeth for Tarka practice.
779135	784358	This is the freestyle Mel B. I don't know what the last tournament was that he won.
784378	785478	Do you have any idea?
786239	787639	Or what some of his big routines were.
787659	789080	I know he had a really good one at SCAD.
789440	790000	He had a good routine.
790020	792802	He had to do an improv routine to Boom Boom Dollar, which was hilarious.
792822	795203	There was also the Silent Hill one.
795643	797944	Does everyone know who Mel B is?
799425	800606	I don't see that.
801166	809691	Most people, if you download videos from DDR Freak or any site that offers videos of freestyle competitions from the Bay Area, you're going to probably find a Mel B video.
809711	811532	I think most people are familiar with his work.
812193	819837	I can actually confirm that from people in Mississippi, in Alabama, where I was going to play DDR at Boomtown.
819857	821078	They're like, you're from California?
821138	822058	Oh my God, do you know Mel B?
822118	822178	Yes.
824952	825573	That's what I got.
826634	827575	He's a celebrity, man.
827635	827955	Come on.
828576	831479	He's a DDR celebrity, and he'll be here in-house next week.
834743	837085	Do you think that's special, to be a DDR celebrity?
837946	838707	Yeah, why not?
839949	840990	I'm a DDR celebrity.
843533	844954	And why are you a DDR celebrity?
845715	846256	Because I am.
847574	851337	Well, there was that, um, wait, I can't say that name on this radio station, can I?
851778	855401	But that one instance with this, the, uh, unnamed person, we don't have the name.
855681	856221	Yeah, what?
856241	857603	That made her a celebrity.
858343	859724	You know, the whole rice princess.
859985	860845	Oh, yeah, whatever, whatever.
860865	861886	We don't need to go into that, sorry.
862327	866610	I don't mean to bring the show to a crashing halt or anything, come on.
867351	870574	But, no, um, you know, it's kind of funny, though, I've noticed that, like,
871420	871500	D.D.R.
871540	871681	Freak
881463	887946	They're like, um, cause, alright, they got their fifth mix machine in at the Boomtown Casino in, um, Biloxi, Mississippi.
888947	891728	And they had never seen a fifth mix before.
891848	893729	And this is after Max 2 had just come out.
894189	899952	So I get up on there, I play my usual thing, you know, I have this tradition where I always start off with Superstar Maniac.
900352	901893	It doesn't really matter what machine it's on.
902733	909417	And, um, I just played, like, this big Maniac set and, like, for the first time I full comboed, uh, what did I play?
911118	913039	Dropout, Trick, Hidden, something.
913579	914579	You know, I just was playing around.
914919	917061	And they're like, oh my god, who are you?
917601	919922	I was like, oh, well, I go by DarkSakura.
920422	920942	That's you?
921423	922003	Oh my god!
922523	933188	So, it's like if you have a prominent name on any of the national boards or anything like that, then people know who you are and they're like, oh my god, that's you.
934189	934969	It's just really weird.
935730	937351	And then for me, they're like, you're Mormon?
937531	938031	What the hell?
940973	941413	Yeah.
944474	944955	Uncomfortable.
944975	952018	Sorry, our chat room is getting insanely popular, so I was opting a few people there to help police the chat room when we can't take an eye on things here.
953218	954259	It is pretty big today.
954379	954579	Yes.
955359	956419	Hello, everybody.
956540	957560	Hello, everybody in chat room.
958380	963422	Wow, we even have the... Let's see who we have in the chat room today.
963442	965543	We have SoCalKicks, Joe Mama.
966624	969305	We have... God, lots of people.
971004	972765	Wow, it's the people who are actually here.
973225	975246	Wow, Bradley, you're in two places at once.
975406	976026	How special.
979968	980428	Okay.
980548	982149	It's your evil twin skippy.
982529	989652	I just gave ops to people that are long-time listeners to the show here, so I thought they'd be able to police all right, because they know what we do here on the show.
990754	991494	and just what do we do.
991814	997576	Anyway, will we just talk about anything Bomani and then just other crap that we feel like talking about?
997596	999337	We'll talk about whatever we want here on the show, right?
999757	1000477	We talk about it.
1000777	1002258	If it exists, we can talk about it.
1002558	1002858	Okay.
1003798	1008119	Anyway, so we have Mel B and Melody coming next week.
1008139	1009020	That's big news for the show.
1009040	1012060	We're going to be expanding our playlist, other big news for the show.
1012461	1016542	We might also be starting to do some other random live things.
1017242	1017542	Uh-oh.
1017562	1017843	Uh-oh.
1017863	1018143	Uh-oh.
1045720	1046741	None of us seem to have it.
1046801	1052564	We know some people out there do have it, thankfully, but we're not getting ours until mid-next week, so we couldn't do our six-style tribute tonight.
1053024	1067512	However, I've got some tracks from the V-Rare 2 CD, and if you pre-ordered stuff from Konami Style, then you would have gotten this special CD, this V-Rare 2 CD, which had some tracks on it, and I'm going to play some of those tracks for you.
1067792	1074436	And rumor is that this also works as an appendix, although I haven't had that confirmed yet, so I don't know what's going to happen with that.
1076047	1083609	Okay, so we're going to do a tribute to Sixth Style next week because we'll have it and we can... That'll be even more special because it'll be show number six.
1083629	1084849	It'll be show number six.
1084969	1087310	It'll be show six style, yeah.
1087490	1087850	Okay.
1091271	1093192	So... So what else do you want to talk about?
1093212	1094352	You want to take another break real fast?
1094372	1094672	Do you want to...
1095441	1099764	Well, why don't we go ahead and let them hear something different for a bit?
1100104	1101545	Okay, well, let's play those songs.
1101565	1103887	Let's go ahead and play those songs from the VRare 2 CD.
1104247	1109711	We're going to come back and we're going to talk about the big news this week concerning the Konami of America coin-op division.
1109751	1110772	We'll talk about that when we get back.
1110792	1122360	In the meantime, I'm going to play Megu with Stick Around and LED with the Mix-Up Dungeon J. And I'm having a request in the chat room for a Strong Jager, so maybe we'll work that in, too.
1122500	1122860	So here we go.
1391422	1392087	Thanks for watching!
1708209	1712333	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
1712553	1714275	Do you want to be exactly like Hollywood?
1714315	1714675	No!
1714815	1718398	Do we care what people think of us?
1719019	1720861	No!
1720881	1722322	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
1722762	1723823	Yes!
1726813	1728634	Extreme Babani Radio.
1728874	1731536	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
1731776	1738039	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we just played for you some stuff from the 6th Style V-Rare 2 CD.
1738539	1740840	Some hidden tracks that you can find in 6th Style.
1740860	1744843	Megu with Stick Around, the full version, and LED with a strong Jaeger.
1745383	1746343	As in Jaegermeister.
1746563	1747344	And it was exciting.
1747364	1747944	The full version.
1748184	1750045	I'm tingly just from hearing that song.
1750786	1752787	You've been moist and tingly tonight, Jamie.
1752907	1754208	Yes, I feel like I have a disease.
1755652	1758174	I have the racking pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.
1758634	1760755	Irene's got this look on her face of like, dear God.
1761656	1763297	This show is resorted to potty jokes.
1764257	1765939	Okay, anyway.
1766339	1770561	We'd like to give our condolences to a long-time supporter of Orange Lounge Radio.
1770602	1773343	He's been around since the first couple episodes.
1773363	1775224	That's SCK SoCalKicks.
1775264	1779527	Had a website, and unfortunately due to some server issues, it is no more.
1779927	1781709	He has no website right now.
1781809	1782129	He can't...
1782729	1783149	Host it!
1783529	1790693	Anyway, so if you have any posting space that you'd like to host, a cool little DDR website all about the SoCal scene and then some.
1790733	1792913	He has a lot of information about U.S.
1793454	1795635	Bomani releases, domestic Bomani releases.
1795675	1797115	He's always up to news on that kind of stuff.
1797615	1800117	And he has a good little edit database going.
1800557	1806379	So go ahead and send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com and we'll pass it along to him.
1806759	1807640	I'm sure he'd appreciate it.
1808861	1809361	And you're welcome.
1809641	1811843	Anyway, because he's saying thank you in the chatroom.
1811863	1812223	So you're welcome.
1812243	1813144	Yes, you're very welcome.
1813464	1814645	You've been a long time supporter of the show.
1815045	1816026	You hosted my edits.
1816206	1816787	That's really cool.
1816947	1817127	Yes.
1817947	1820189	Also, we've got some news going on.
1820950	1823812	Yesterday was the big Castro Valley Golf Land Tournament.
1824312	1828836	And, well, that kind of goes into an FU of the Week, actually, for me anyway.
1828876	1831418	But we want to give Jamie's FU of the Week first.
1831798	1834160	So let's let Jamie give her FU of the Week.
1836275	1842277	Okay, my FU of the week is directed towards, drumroll please, AT&T.
1842757	1843537	AT&T.
1843977	1844817	AT&T.
1845257	1848818	The only company that I've seen that has the Death Star as their logo.
1849078	1850899	Yes, they are truly the evil empire.
1852059	1855380	I have been at home, unemployed, now...
1856129	1856509	Happily.
1856789	1857409	Well, not really.
1857589	1859430	Anyway, that's off the subject.
1859670	1867712	Anyway, I've been sitting at home for the past week and a half trying to go online and play my addiction, Ragnarok Online, only to have my cable crap out.
1868592	1873593	I will be sitting online, happily gaining levels, even if disconnected from the server.
1873753	1874033	What?
1874733	1882075	I go downstairs, look at my little connector thing for my modem, and it's blinking lights all over the place, and then it just stops.
1883078	1889140	So I have to hop on dial-up, then it comes back, then I have to get back on, and it does this at least five times a day.
1889840	1893041	AT&T is truly a company run by the Antichrist.
1893821	1896742	Anyway, so I'm looking for new service.
1896782	1899262	If anybody has good suggestions, I'm open to them.
1899723	1900963	AT&T just needs to die.
1902460	1911682	I also hate AT&T because we have their cable, and they charge us way too much for it, and we don't get BBC America, and we don't get M2.
1912062	1914063	So what am I supposed to do for watching music videos?
1914103	1915743	Because MTV sure as hell doesn't play them.
1916703	1917703	That's for damn sure.
1919904	1923044	MTV hasn't played videos since, like, the 90s began.
1924545	1927805	Well, no, they played videos up through them because we had 120 Minutes, we had...
1932099	1934182	Yeah, but like, MTV has Sorority Life.
1934963	1936525	The new reality show!
1937286	1938447	It took place in Davis, by the way.
1939649	1940350	Ah, that is true.
1940370	1941791	More than the reason not to watch.
1942352	1943734	I actually did see that at AX.
1943754	1945937	I saw when they put the rocks up on the side of the hill.
1947139	1949760	Oh, is that what they all do by the big bridge?
1949960	1951821	That was a pledge thingy.
1951841	1952802	Ah, to hell with MTV.
1952942	1954363	I have an FU of the Week as well.
1955283	1956964	I just thought of this before the show started.
1957825	1960186	I decided I needed a theme song for my FU of the Week as well.
1960286	1961086	Well, mine's cooler.
1961426	1962167	Yours is cooler.
1962207	1963067	Mine's fucked up.
1965749	1971431	Anyway, my issue... Oh, it's being suggested that your FU of the Week should have been this.
1971852	1972492	Duplo Web.
1972572	1972852	Yes.
1973172	1974173	Freaking Duplo Web.
1975794	1976074	Okay.
1977074	1980156	I have been working for nearly a month on DarkSakura.com.
1980176	1981157	Getting my pages up.
1981177	1981937	It looks really pretty.
1981957	1983659	Too bad nobody else can see it.
1996440	2004003	because I keep getting these emails that say, we're relocating the server, oh, we relocated again, oh, the server's now shoved somewhere up our ass, you know, we're puking it now.
2004744	2009066	So, at this point, I'm about ready to say, fuck DuploWeb again.
2009226	2013988	And for the people in the chatroom who are wondering, go to www.duploweb.com and you'll see how crappy they are.
2014948	2017329	So, I'm looking for a new service for that as well.
2017770	2020591	If you have suggestions, please let me know, as long as you pay for it.
2022054	2023636	Okay, can I finish?
2023816	2024216	Can I finish?
2024336	2024817	Can I finish?
2025157	2025357	No!
2025377	2025918	No, my turn!
2025938	2026338	Can I finish?
2026358	2026638	Can I finish?
2026658	2029581	I have part three, and my other fuck of the week goes toward my big toe.
2029761	2029941	No.
2032824	2033044	Alright.
2033124	2033384	Okay.
2033584	2035086	I'm gonna try to do my FU of the week now.
2035706	2035987	No.
2036307	2036727	If I may.
2036747	2037568	Oh, one more thing, one more thing.
2037628	2038088	Jesus Christ.
2038209	2038969	Okay, here you go.
2043393	2045755	My FU of the week is Jamie, because she, no.
2046136	2046216	My...
2049187	2052510	My FU of the week is my sleep schedule.
2054992	2060977	Because not only did I sleep until 3 o'clock today, I slept for 13 hours last night.
2062618	2064399	I slept yesterday.
2065678	2070482	I slept yesterday just long enough to miss CVGL completely.
2070862	2083653	I was going to go for a couple hours and it was great because I had my little remote kit I was going to take and I was going to do interviews for this show and I was going to do all this stuff and hopefully get to meet some people and get interviews with winners and all that stuff.
2084033	2085355	But I slept too damn much.
2085855	2088557	So I did not get to go to CVGL.
2089138	2089278	So...
2092140	2097524	My problem is my clock and for that I give an F you to my sleep clock.
2097544	2100286	We're also taking suggestions and collections to buy Robin your alarm clock.
2100306	2101847	I'm being told to get an alarm clock.
2102947	2103688	It doesn't work.
2103748	2104708	It didn't work this weekend.
2104728	2105469	I didn't have my one.
2105509	2108070	We can buy one and duct tape it to your head.
2108271	2114875	I wasn't sleeping at my own house and that's all that needs to be said.
2115535	2117157	We have a suggestion from Irene.
2117237	2117797	Irene, yes.
2118137	2118578	What is this?
2119078	2124602	Oh, I said take laxatives before you go to bed so you'll have to take a shit really bad in the morning and you'll be forced to wake up.
2125876	2127937	I need to say something to Jabberwocky in the chat room.
2128158	2129959	I can't understand anything you're saying at all.
2129999	2130419	I'm sorry.
2131140	2131360	Anyway.
2134362	2135142	Moving right along.
2135262	2136603	Oh, yes, and a poopy pancake to you.
2136964	2138184	Anyway, moving right along.
2138424	2140966	That relates, by the way, to the other show.
2141887	2145229	UnderstationLive.org Listen to it.
2145269	2146390	It broadcasts on Saturday night.
2146430	2147631	If you like this, you'll love that.
2147751	2148011	Anyway.
2148571	2149111	The 630 to 930.
2149612	2152813	Let's talk about the winners at CVGL, because I wanted to talk about that.
2152853	2154314	Do you still have that up on the screen over there, Matt?
2156175	2156595	Who won?
2156655	2159656	I know some people that listen to this show ended up placing, so that's pretty cool.
2159676	2161697	We will pass the microphone now to Matt.
2163197	2167682	Okay, for Perfect Attack, first place went to Virtu, no, Corey.
2168923	2169724	Congratulations.
2169804	2170385	Go, Corey!
2171506	2175831	Second place went to Tigger Eugene, or I hope I pronounced that right.
2176832	2178874	And then third place went to Emphasis.
2180235	2180956	Well, you go!
2182037	2184360	And for Freestyle, let me see here real quick.
2187634	2193599	Okay, third place went to Hypnotics with his Secret Rendezvous routine.
2195121	2196762	Second place went to... That's a local boy!
2196942	2197643	Go Hypnotics!
2197703	2197963	Woo!
2198203	2202767	Second place went to Nobody Gin for their High Is Off You routine.
2204509	2210034	And also first place went to Sweet Banana AJ for the jazz routine.
2210414	2212456	My sweet, my sweet banana...
2213729	2216271	Every time I hear that song, I think of the Abra, Abra.
2216692	2220615	Have you noticed how many Parapara songs are rip-offs of old 80 tunes that steal the tunes?
2221456	2224198	There's that one, and then there's... Irene, you know some of these.
2224278	2226360	The Parasongs that sound like other normal songs.
2226540	2227801	The Ghostbusters song.
2228442	2228982	Which one's that?
2229042	2233146	That would be... Oh, Deluxe.
2233846	2235688	No, that's Aishitai Masu.
2235788	2236308	Aishitai Masu.
2236809	2236969	Yes.
2239820	2240020	What else?
2240040	2241041	There's another one that rips off.
2241401	2244683	I was thinking Highway to Hell, but that's High Energy from DDR Solo.
2244743	2246204	It just sounds just like Highway to Hell.
2246244	2255008	They'll pick song titles too and make up whole Eurobeat songs, like Like a Virgin.
2255028	2258350	What was the other one that had Don't Stand So Close to Me?
2258370	2259250	I don't know.
2259270	2260171	Don't Stand So Close?
2260511	2261171	Yeah, whatever.
2263567	2271273	But you know, the whole thing is that just about every song that was in Parapara was on one of the million initial D soundtracks.
2273214	2274055	And they all say fire.
2274075	2274735	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Ari?
2274755	2275716	They all say fire.
2275736	2276657	Yes, they all say fire.
2278666	2282888	Gosh, PVP is a really old thing to be talking about, but actually, locally, it's still kind of new to us.
2282948	2285649	We haven't had a machine until about two months ago.
2286449	2289751	Anyway, but para para, I don't know, it's kind of getting old for me, but whatever.
2290391	2292692	Rob, I think I have an answer to your not waking up.
2293392	2293773	Oh, yes.
2293873	2300035	I remember on Tech TV, on the show The Screensavers, they reviewed an alarm clock called the Screaming Mimi 110.
2301036	2305718	Basically, it's a 110 decibel alarm clock, which is equivalent to a jet airplane.
2305758	2305938	Oh, no.
2306158	2306858	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
2307118	2313361	My old roommate, my very first roommate, when I moved out of the dorms in college, I moved into an apartment, and my roommate had one of those clocks.
2313701	2314641	It wasn't just one of those clocks.
2314661	2315302	It was a clock.
2315382	2318103	It was an alarm clock for deaf people, is what it was.
2318523	2320203	It was so loud every time it went off.
2320964	2326746	Keep in mind, my old apartment, I lived right by train tracks, so every time a train went by, I could sleep right through that.
2326766	2328687	But his alarm clock always woke me up.
2328727	2330247	It sounded like a plane was landing in his room.
2330287	2330708	It was just like...
2332648	2335590	It was so incredibly loud, you would not even believe.
2336270	2344494	Well, what was funny is also, they were reviewing the fact that there's Screaming Me 220, which I just can't imagine that.
2345835	2347816	That's for people who actually want to be deaf.
2351138	2353679	That's a long call for people who want to be deaf.
2354259	2356280	I could only live with that guy for six months.
2356320	2357141	Him and his clock.
2357441	2360202	Or maybe it's like for, you know, rock stars who are deaf anyway.
2361283	2361683	Don't you think?
2367449	2373097	I apologize to any speakers that were blown out by my impersonation of my old roommate's alarm clock.
2373458	2375181	And he held the microphone pretty far away.
2378269	2382873	We're having a suggestion in the chatroom from Pyroman saying to wake up to let them move every morning.
2384214	2385395	That'll get you right out of bed.
2385415	2386296	Let's just put it this way.
2386336	2387397	That won't make me get out of bed.
2387417	2388618	That'll make me want to end my life.
2388819	2392462	The screaming 220 can be heard up to a mile away.
2393783	2394724	Oh my god.
2394744	2398388	Uh, no.
2398528	2398648	No.
2399910	2400330	No.
2401331	2407436	Also, in case you missed last week's show, by the way, we did determine the worst Mamani song in history next to Let Them Move.
2407857	2409698	And it was Bye Bye Baby Balloon.
2409998	2412260	So Bye Bye Baby Balloon will never be played on this.
2412300	2413581	And this wasn't just our decision.
2413621	2414082	We helped.
2414362	2418265	But it was the chat room that ultimately decided that Bye Bye Baby Balloon was the worst Mamani song ever.
2418285	2419767	It still gets a mention in one of our provos.
2420267	2420647	It does.
2420747	2421388	It does get a mention.
2421408	2422269	But we, you know.
2422589	2423350	But we won't play the song.
2423370	2423930	Yeah, we won't play it.
2426493	2430661	If anyone hasn't heard the promo, it's declared as crap.
2431202	2432003	So, that's why.
2433205	2434387	And crap stinks, so flush it.
2435048	2435269	Anyway.
2437363	2438824	Let's talk about another big news item.
2438844	2443087	This has been the biggest news in the DDR scene in forever.
2443107	2444407	I'm going to read this.
2444427	2448510	This was in Replay Magazine, which is an industry magazine for arcade coin-ops.
2448870	2450671	And they said, Konami's U.S.
2450711	2452212	coin-op office is to close.
2452552	2463539	The Konami of America's coin-op office in Buffalo Grove, Illinois will close its doors at the end of September with future game sales being handled by an as-yet-to-be-named third-party exclusive distributor in the U.S.,
2464139	2465320	Factory execs in the U.S.
2465380	2467843	have yet to issue a public statement confirming the move.
2467923	2471626	So it is still kind of hearsay at this point, but it's pretty much been widely determined.
2471646	2476891	There was speculation before this news item hit, and now it's kind of just being more and more confirmed.
2477551	2489382	Anyway, the Japanese manufacturer, which has a consumer game office in California and gaming operations in Nevada, will maintain a small service department to handle support for its existing units in the field, like all those silent scope machines.
2489982	2500530	According to what Replay Magazine has so far, Konami is also expected to exhibit at this fall's AMOA Expo in Las Vegas, possibly with their new sales and marketing partner.
2500570	2503332	And that's been quite an interesting story lately.
2503953	2507976	People are saying, oh, that's it, DDR is dead in the US.
2509096	2510017	I wouldn't go that far.
2510277	2512539	I think that's kind of screaming that the sky is falling.
2512719	2517282	It never once said that they were going to, you know, not manufacture the games 100%.
2518342	2519543	They have another distributor.
2520484	2524406	And they still don't appear to give a shit about imports, so hey, I think we're going to be okay.
2524806	2533211	No, so that's another thing, Austin, to put an end to that rumor that was brought to our attention last week, too, regarding, you know, them hunting down Dromania machines and taking them out.
2533852	2538995	Like, you know, go after, you know, all two copies of pop music that are in, you know, the country.
2539750	2541352	So we still don't know what's going to happen with DDR.
2541412	2542473	This could be a good thing.
2542513	2550843	I mean, maybe this third-party distributor is going to take something like Max 2, just make it, you know, maybe have some... I don't know how it all works, really, in the industry.
2550863	2554968	Maybe Konami makes it better, or they help make it better, and then, you know, put it out.
2555048	2558673	You know, maybe this third-party distributor is going to listen to us, you know, really good.
2559293	2569055	Well, working at a video distributor company, it's pretty much a lot of the companies out there that manufacture machines and distribute them, they want to cut costs.
2569135	2572576	And the only way they can do that is not distribute them and go third party.
2572596	2577397	And that way it saves on them having shipping facilities and all that kind of stuff.
2577797	2579118	So they're going to cut costs that way.
2579138	2580498	It doesn't mean they're not going to make any gains.
2580518	2585199	They're just going through someone else to distribute them, which is really common in all the industries out there.
2586140	2596260	Do you think maybe it's possible that this third party distributor is going to come out and go, okay, we've got a problem with these imports because we're trying to put out a new USA mix here and we've got a problem with your imports.
2596601	2597343	Do you think that might happen?
2597717	2599338	No, they have nothing to say with it.
2599519	2606865	All the distributors do is take someone's game and basically sell that product to whoever.
2606945	2607806	That's all they do.
2607886	2610328	They don't do anything as far as recalling games.
2610428	2611228	That's all Konami.
2611289	2613410	So they're nothing but highly trained monkeys, basically.
2614371	2615432	Yes, I'm getting nodded yes.
2616853	2621195	And DDR Max USA, not affected from what we hear so far.
2621636	2623376	Still looking to be a damn good release.
2623436	2625698	It's going to be the biggest home release of DDR ever.
2625718	2627158	65-something songs.
2628979	2629359	Who knows?
2629460	2633442	But maybe possibly the only thing that could be affected is any kind of arcade link.
2633502	2634222	Who knows what happens?
2634362	2635463	Maybe they don't know what's going to happen yet.
2635483	2636283	It's only coin-op.
2636423	2636643	Yeah.
2636663	2642145	I mean, the thing is, they're still selling their own home games online.
2642185	2645506	I mean, Konami makes, you know, a good number of games.
2645766	2650567	And even so, you know, they've still got, you know, like they're keeping that small servicing up.
2650587	2655809	And, you know, they still have tons of classic games out that are going to be servicing, like the Turtles in Time at Roseville Golf Land.
2656409	2658450	That game is so cool.
2660830	2661951	Yes, we are geeks.
2664514	2666616	But anyway, we digress.
2667296	2676063	They've got so many games that have been released as far as arcade games that are going to need that servicing in the future, so it's a good thing that they keep that office open.
2676504	2679086	Their distributor is not really going to be able to do much about that anyway.
2680829	2682891	Jabberwocky has a very good point in our chat room.
2683011	2684292	It's saying it's not a bad move.
2684412	2685553	Look at the movie industry.
2685733	2690578	They work the exact same way, and they're pretty darn good at distributing the movies to the theaters.
2691139	2693941	So maybe this is just going to get DDR out there even more.
2694782	2695523	I can even say that.
2695543	2695823	Yeah, I know.
2696264	2698085	You did kind of just say the same damn thing.
2698126	2699307	But you work for...
2700207	2704868	Thinking about it as video and thinking about the actual movie is two different things.
2704888	2707549	I worked in the mortgage industry for two years.
2707669	2724672	A mortgage company or a bank is often going to buy out a third-party servicer to handle loans, collections, because it's too much money that's going to cost them to train, to have these people hired, trained to take care of the employee base.
2724752	2728473	If you look at it from that standpoint as well, Konami is a corporation.
2729433	2731774	That's going to save them a lot of money over time.
2732374	2735795	Less money that they spend on actually having to worry about the distribution.
2735835	2738836	That could be more money put into other things.
2738976	2741616	It sounds like it's not the end of the world.
2742517	2746918	Maybe some things are going to change, but it sounds like for the most part, it can't be a totally bad thing.
2746958	2748078	It might just be better.
2748098	2749399	It might get DDR some more exposure.
2749419	2752019	They're going to hopefully do some things that Konami wasn't able to do.
2752499	2756521	And Max USA still sounds like it's going to be pretty kick-ass.
2756541	2757401	That is going to be a winner.
2758905	2761386	20 new songs that haven't been in any mix yet
2780473	2781474	Thank you for watching.
2781495	2781855	See you next time.
2799097	2801338	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2823010	2829200	and MixUpDenjinJ, which is the full version we're going to hear, which is another one of these six-style hidden tracks.
2829660	2833026	So it's going to be somewhat of a long break, but we'll come back right about 8 o'clock.
2833146	2835830	And I'll try to get to as many requests as I can for the night's up.
3049890	3050932	Thanks for watching!
3123751	3127013	Thanks for watching!
3152854	3153655	Thanks for watching!
3266375	3266818	Thanks for watching!
3307982	3308606	Thanks for watching!
3398670	3399639	Thanks for watching!
3426838	3427680	Thanks for watching!
3480862	3486527	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge by Money Music and More show?
3486807	3493953	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
3494293	3496255	It's unearthly.
3496495	3500218	It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
3500580	3501081	Euromix 2 Euromix 2
3520305	3525671	Okay, well, Euromix 1 was out in the UK for quite a while now.
3525871	3531637	It's been using the old third mix engine that we're all familiar with from USA.
3532538	3536482	However, it's really old, so they decided to update their new thing.
3536522	3538504	It's actually Euromix 2 or Euromax.
3539284	3543389	It's probably going to use either, I'm guessing it would be the DDR Max 2 engine for it.
3543869	3544489	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3564702	3568004	The song list is pretty good, actually.
3568045	3572328	They've teamed up with EMI Records and also Zumba Records.
3573289	3574791	Like Britney Spears' Zumba?
3575391	3575671	Yes.
3575912	3576632	Oh, dear God.
3576732	3579375	But, well, it's okay.
3579575	3584719	They've got a few songs I've heard of, like 5678 by The Steps.
3584780	3585500	Oh, you know what, Matt?
3585520	3588983	I actually have 5678 by The Steps queued up here, so let's hear a little bit of this.
3590097	3591138	Aren't I good here?
3591158	3592318	We got one of these songs.
3592358	3595420	So here's a preview of what one of the new Euromix songs is going to be like.
3595440	3596680	I'm just going to play a little bit of it here for you.
3597440	3599141	Kind of a little bit repetitive here.
3599161	3601562	No, this is not the song that Billy had to dance to.
3601602	3603123	That song was called Tragedy.
3615512	3617132	This is kind of what it's on.
3617313	3621134	It's kind of probably going to have a lot of little 12th notes in it or something.
3621154	3624154	Well, actually, it sounds much like Cowgirl or something like that.
3627175	3628416	Yeah, something like that.
3628856	3629696	Boot scootin' baby.
3629716	3631456	It's like club country music.
3631516	3632217	I don't even know.
3632757	3638438	That's funny because one of the other songs in there is going to be Cotton Eye Joe, which is a country sounding song.
3638458	3640319	Yeah, Cotton Eye Joe is going to be in there.
3640859	3644220	And unfortunately, it looks like Let Them Move is going to be on there, too.
3645520	3647542	That means that people get to hear me scream loudly.
3648363	3648804	I guess.
3650045	3655089	This again, in case you missed it, playing in the background is 5678 by Steps, which is going to be one of the new songs in Euromix.
3655130	3662476	Some of the other new songs will be Caribbean Queen by Billy Ocean, Aaron's Party, Come and Get It by Aaron Carter.
3663117	3663858	Oh, God.
3665800	3666261	I'm wet.
3666981	3669122	Don't try to stop it by Roman Holiday.
3670563	3673845	Let's see, I Want You to Want Me by Solid Harmony.
3674025	3676426	Is that I want you to want me?
3676766	3678467	Probably a cover of the old Cheap Trick song.
3680208	3682529	The Vibe is Right by Ruby Turner.
3684030	3688973	and, um, let's see, we've got Stomp, also by the Steps, same people that are doing 5, 6, 7, 8.
3689153	3691794	Now, I bet you, Steps is broken up already.
3691834	3697157	They broke up last year, so it's probably a similar kind of thing to, like, SmileDK, where they're getting all these songs from bands that have been broken up.
3697637	3698097	Probably.
3698457	3701519	Uh, see, then we have That Is In, This Is Now by High Five.
3703340	3711526	What's pretty cool though is they've actually got a lot of the stuff from older mixes that we don't have in our Max 2, but some of it's pretty good.
3711846	3716730	They're getting some of the Max 2 stuff like Living in America and the Reflex and that kind of thing.
3718111	3725996	Also, they're getting some of the Oni songs that were in Max 2 that we aren't getting.
3726296	3728397	Like Hysteria is one of them, right?
3728457	3731099	Hysteria 2001 and D4U, the KOGG3 mix.
3733140	3736362	They're getting those and Spin the Disc and all that stuff.
3736402	3737383	Brad's in the corner whining.
3738684	3742226	Also, they're going to be having some DDR Max 3 songs in there.
3744491	3749973	Yes, they've got some new... These are some of the new originals that we should probably expect for Max 3.
3750013	3754235	They have Vanity Angel by Fix.
3754295	3757757	Memories, it's a new Naoki featuring Paula Terry song.
3759938	3762900	Then we have Crash by Mr. Brian and the Final Band.
3763161	3765523	Wait, wait, back the train the fuck up.
3766283	3770767	Paula Terry is a very talented young lady, and I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate you guys talking about her like that.
3771427	3773068	But, but, Brad, it sucks.
3773209	3774530	I thought it was the only...
3776491	3781553	Excuse me, the Naoki teaching voluntary Oni mode has got to be the best Oni mode there is.
3781994	3782574	Oni, of course.
3783434	3785115	Oh, here we go, here we go.
3785155	3786256	Go through your little thing.
3786316	3787816	I have something to say about that, Brad.
3787856	3788717	Hold on, just a minute.
3788737	3789437	Your digital reply.
3789457	3790218	Hold on, let's see.
3790958	3792158	I've got my reply here somewhere.
3792178	3792979	You can't browse through your reply.
3792999	3793399	Where is it?
3793539	3794299	Oh, yes, here it is.
3796360	3797921	Oh, that makes me feel warm inside.
3799202	3799862	Warm and squishy.
3803225	3809991	You know, there have been, I can't say that the music is bad, but Politary can't hold a tune.
3810291	3811112	I'll say this, I'll say this.
3811452	3819619	I like Email Me, that's a cool one, and I like, yeah, it's Politary, and I like, yeah, it's Politary, and I like, I like Still in My Heart.
3819739	3820480	I do like that song.
3820900	3823682	But like, Destiny, yuck.
3823983	3826565	Okay, this is musical harassment, and I don't have to take it.
3827085	3827525	I'm leaving.
3828766	3830308	Just go play your Game Boy.
3830348	3831168	Go play your Game Boy.
3832029	3833950	Okay, Matt wants to give us news now.
3833970	3834491	Matt, you want to talk?
3834511	3834971	We have news.
3835671	3836832	You hate Politeira too, don't you?
3838973	3839954	Are you gay?
3841515	3842215	You're taking the ass.
3842796	3843456	What the hell?
3843956	3844717	That was random.
3845577	3845878	Are you gay?
3846098	3848159	No, no, no, and no.
3851068	3851708	Let's see here.
3852249	3855550	One of the things that they don't mention in here is Max Unlimited.
3856330	3859772	So probably my guess would be they're having some sort of unlocked thing.
3859792	3861092	They're just being a secret.
3861112	3861653	They're making it a secret.
3861673	3863013	Oh yeah, it's going to be a hidden track.
3863053	3863734	Whoop-de-doo.
3864994	3867955	Then they're probably getting Burning Heat as another hidden track.
3867995	3871397	So they're probably going to have some hidden tracks and a similar unlocked system to Max too.
3871917	3872477	Hooray for them.
3873718	3878380	You know, I'm still planning on eventually one of these days making an edit for Burning Heat and calling it Prep H.
3882445	3887628	You know, I think that would be a very good title for this test.
3888009	3889750	Uh-oh, uh-oh.
3890090	3891271	Brad went and got backups.
3892371	3893172	I like Politary.
3893352	3894173	She's pretty cool.
3894833	3895133	Okay, bye.
3895153	3896494	You know what?
3896614	3897155	Okay, bye.
3911781	3912181	I don't know.
3912241	3914083	How many people in the chatroom like Politary?
3914843	3915884	Let's take a quick vote.
3917165	3920927	Who in the chatroom likes Politary and who thinks Politary just needs to go away?
3921508	3921748	Yes.
3922569	3926171	Go ahead and send in your votes and we'll see what the majority says.
3926351	3932115	How many times are we going to talk about Politary on the show?
3932636	3934217	How many times can I work into puking sound?
3935157	3937499	How many songs total does it look like Euromix is going to be having?
3939411	3940355	Well, let me see here.
3945180	3945800	A lot.
3946221	3947662	I don't know.
3947702	3948482	You don't have to count.
3948522	3949043	Just kind of guess.
3949063	3955207	I believe they're supposed to have 65 songs other than... I don't know.
3955427	3956007	Let me see here.
3956588	3956948	A lot?
3958389	3959289	I'll stick with a lot.
3959790	3962792	Okay, and the chat room says, Politary dies.
3963072	3964193	Politary fucking owns.
3964513	3966334	Politary is as cool as the center of hell.
3966614	3967555	Politary sucks.
3968416	3969877	If I were a redhead, I'd do a rotten.
3970177	3971698	Politary is a no-talent whore.
3972138	3973599	And I vote for Osamu Kubota.
3974099	3974259	So...
3975100	3978684	You know what?
3981306	3986772	For whoever said that Politary was as cool as the center of hell, you had to have read The Inferno if you meant that in a good way.
3986792	3990315	Politary is really awesome.
3990776	3992077	She's from Australia.
3992918	3993839	Yeah, so is Kylie Minogue.
3994639	3996421	So is Olivia Newton-John, and she did Xanadu.
3996541	3997582	And Kylie Minogue's good, too.
4003274	4003894	Okay, it sounds like 68.
4004854	4005834	68, that's the word.
4006074	4010595	Now I wonder, could this be some kind of example of what we could be seeing with USMAX?
4010615	4013096	Because that's about how many songs are supposed to be in USMAX.
4015256	4017276	Am I onto something?
4017296	4018757	Well, okay, here would be the difference here.
4019457	4025038	Okay, USMAX, some of the songs wouldn't work just right, especially when it comes to editing them.
4026318	4030219	We're going to have probably a Britney Spears song in there, one or two.
4030239	4032039	Aaron Carter, David and Backstreet Boys.
4032859	4035901	I'm sure there's going to be a boy band somewhere around here.
4037062	4038143	Maybe Cher even.
4039684	4040985	Boycott the boy band.
4044148	4058459	Okay, first of all, I will personally write a scathing letter to Konami of America if there is any... You know, okay, I know that there's people who like boy bands, but don't expect... You know, I'm going to do exactly the same thing I did with the mix of Oops!
4058499	4061962	I Did It Again and Fifth Mix and never play it and go plug my ears when it's on.
4063311	4063691	We're here.
4064312	4065552	Somebody's been quite adamant in here.
4065612	4067473	No, we will not have boy bands.
4067593	4069354	So somebody with some insider information there.
4069374	4074177	And then there's going to be the Let Them Trance, you know, the trance version of Let Them Move, of course.
4076314	4077134	That was horrible.
4077635	4078095	Boo!
4078695	4079656	I've let them move.
4081597	4089240	You know, I'm going to continue to always show my support for Konami, even if, you know, we happen to do get a lot of, you know, get some crappy boy bands and let them move.
4089861	4096104	You know, there are legitimately people who like those songs, although those people also probably have had lobotomies, too.
4097184	4099385	So... I'm sorry, hold on.
4099645	4101185	Have you seen a picture of Politary?
4101605	4101886	Uh, no.
4102186	4103306	You know who she looks like?
4103466	4103646	Who?
4104026	4106127	That chick on Magnolia that's the druggie?
4107667	4109148	Um, I don't remember her name.
4109168	4110608	Yeah, okay, I know who you're talking about.
4110708	4111528	Yeah, she looks like her.
4111568	4116230	She's all skinny and, like, blonde and really, like, anorexic looking and stuff.
4116290	4117630	And she wears really dark lipstick.
4118610	4119371	Well, thank you for that.
4120151	4121831	That little, uh, hint.
4121851	4123712	It really gives a shit, you know, yeah.
4126019	4132861	Yes, it has been confirmed, by the way, by Economy of America represented, that DDR Max USA will have no Let Them Move whatsoever.
4133041	4135042	No mixes, no nothing.
4135182	4135882	I had remembered that.
4135922	4138042	Now, the British one is going to have Let Them Move.
4138463	4140823	I mean, the thing is, to each their own, that's what I always say.
4140943	4147485	However, you know, if the majority says that we know we don't want this, then I'm glad that they're finally listening to that.
4147565	4150266	Guys, have you heard the new song by Outphase?
4150326	4151906	It's a new Let Them Move remix.
4151946	4152606	It's awesome.
4152806	4154547	And Outphase, Let Them Move.
4156792	4158656	You know that actually might be cool?
4158676	4160419	You know?
4162764	4165249	Okay, so Euromix 2, right.
4165770	4166531	But we love Konami.
4168114	4168355	Right.
4170556	4171757	Somebody sent me a file.
4172717	4173837	Oh, I got a picture.
4173917	4174258	Hold on.
4174298	4175058	I'm going to open this up.
4175418	4177039	I should not leave my file transferred.
4177319	4178679	I shouldn't even be saying that.
4178719	4179660	That's on right away.
4180060	4180400	There we go.
4180440	4181620	That's a picture of Politary.
4183181	4185462	Politary looks like she wants to be a goth girl.
4185762	4187803	She does look kind of goth, don't you think?
4188627	4189828	So maybe she's slightly cool.
4190168	4190468	Maybe.
4190688	4191068	We'll see.
4191429	4192409	Cool like the grave.
4193950	4197111	She needs to just maybe do some nude photography instead of singing.
4197672	4200713	And we get a yes from Brad.
4201333	4202994	Thank you for sending me that file.
4203014	4203575	I appreciate it.
4205656	4206716	Pyro Man sent me that file.
4206736	4207216	Thank you very much.
4208077	4211939	Thank you for the lovely picture of the lovely and not-so-talented Politary.
4214388	4215749	Yes, Matt has a comment.
4216809	4221291	Well, also, the new cabinet that your Mix 2 is going to have, that's actually going to be the same thing for Max 3.
4221851	4223952	They're upgrading, I guess, the hardware for that, too.
4224332	4225733	We can get big and shiny.
4226013	4226393	You know what?
4226473	4228354	It is about time they did that, though, don't you think?
4228374	4230995	Because Max 2, it seems like they're really pushing the limits of Max 2.
4231375	4236117	And everybody keeps saying they need to have a DDR mix that has everything in it.
4236617	4236877	DJ Ranma S,
4260903	4264845	Well, that's kind of why I like the 5th Mixin' Up, you know, little navigational thing.
4264885	4269087	I mean, you can put it in alphabetical order or order by difficulty or speed or something like that.
4269567	4270507	That's pretty good, don't you think?
4271148	4277391	Now, do you think they're actually going to call it DDR Max 3 Subtitle Dance Dance Revolution Aderd Mix?
4277811	4278171	Aderd!
4278391	4278911	Oh, God.
4278991	4279311	Aderd?
4279612	4280112	We need Aderd.
4280132	4280612	Aderd.
4281132	4284354	You know, like, how when you beat the Oni courses, it says you got to the Aderd stage?
4286315	4287535	Brad finally gets that joke.
4287875	4289476	But Brad doesn't play online much, so he doesn't.
4290678	4291999	I don't have the internet.
4292339	4293259	What's the internet?
4294080	4295000	Oh, I invented that.
4295600	4296101	That's right, Brad.
4296281	4297641	And we're on real radio.
4298182	4300923	Oh, yes, Miss Al Gore down there on the floor invented the internet, yeah.
4302784	4304385	They're playing Paul and Terry out there.
4304405	4305205	They're playing Love Again.
4305505	4307086	And that's why... It's out in the other room.
4307106	4309107	We have 2DX's fifth style going on.
4309147	4311188	Since we weren't cool enough to get sixth style this week, we're...
4314833	4316174	What's the intranet?
4316915	4317756	I want one of those.
4317796	4318537	I'll get me one of them.
4318997	4320639	We just got new rams today.
4320859	4322801	We got more rams in my computer.
4323062	4323983	That was bad.
4325544	4327246	Anyway, enough about Paul and Terry.
4327266	4328347	This show's getting really lame.
4328627	4332972	Hey, you are cool.
4333913	4334453	Next!
4337141	4338582	So, what's next?
4338602	4339422	Oh, this is for you, Brad.
4340602	4340882	Anyway.
4342063	4343123	That's just the Brad theme.
4343163	4345364	Every time Brad walks in the room and opens his mouth.
4346464	4346964	I don't get it.
4347004	4348065	Our germania is broken.
4349985	4350526	Our symbol is broken.
4350546	4351526	Does that say rim job?
4352326	4352906	Our hi-hat.
4352926	4353687	Oh, rim shot.
4353767	4354287	Rim shot.
4354787	4357408	You know, how about a report on the condition of the machines at Golfland?
4358147	4359989	Minnesota is part of the U.S., you dumbass.
4379110	4385294	And actually, you know, for all of our international listeners, no, we're not, you know, the prime example of all Americans.
4385394	4386534	We're just, you know, the cool people.
4387355	4388155	Yeah, we're the best ones.
4389916	4391217	Everybody wishes they were like us.
4394259	4401003	But we do sometimes, since we are kind of locally based, all the guests you see on the show do come from the same area and play mostly at the same arcade.
4401343	4403224	Sometimes we like to rant about our local arcade.
4403284	4405745	So you want to give an update, status update on all the machines.
4405886	4406226	All right.
4406386	4407326	Or Matt was just there today.
4407366	4408027	He can help out, too.
4408047	4408287	All right.
4408487	4423425	Well, last I noticed, and please correct me if I'm wrong, last I noticed, starting with the farthest corner by the bathroom, Beatmania, well, Hip Hop Mania, Complete Mix 2, is still having issues with their drop-loading coin swap, which they need to actually replace, like the one at Milpitas Golf Land.
4423525	4425388	Also, the screen's really tweaking out now.
4426088	4427069	That's to be expected.
4427089	4428610	The machine's been there for how long?
4429051	4430892	Like, at least two years?
4431212	4432613	Yeah, it's really twisted.
4432694	4436817	I played it from the day that they got it in, so, even though I was really sucky at it.
4438398	4439819	Guitar Freaks is actually working.
4440500	4441861	The controllers seem to be fine.
4441901	4442641	You know, that was great.
4443582	4445724	Drum Mania, the hi-hat is broken.
4447209	4453935	That, for the people who don't really bother themselves with the names of the different censors, that is the far left symbol.
4454836	4457819	Also, Guitar Breaks is still doing the CD-ROM error thing.
4458099	4458479	Oh, it is?
4458640	4458820	Yeah.
4458980	4459641	Are they sessioning?
4460441	4460942	Did you notice?
4461482	4463324	I don't play session because it sucks.
4463914	4464755	Hey, Session is fun.
4465135	4465935	Oh, Keyboard Mania.
4466095	4473460	It looks like they finally got the keyboards replaced in time for someone to rip off the far right key on the second controller side.
4473560	4474321	Oh boy.
4474521	4475041	Anyway.
4475161	4476322	We will find them and murder them.
4476342	4477163	About GF.
4477503	4481485	Yeah, I heard a screw was missing on one of the guitar things.
4485113	4491418	Also, with Keyword Mania, I guess they have been having problems with people stealing the keys again, so they actually turned the whole machine around.
4491998	4496642	So now the front is facing where the back was, and so no one can play it, and no one can tamper with it.
4496862	4506349	Quite honestly, I think they should do with that as they did with Guitar Freak's fifth mix when we first got it in, and put it by the back counter so that the staff can better keep an eye on it.
4506389	4506969	Oh, definitely.
4507370	4510412	I mean, it's not session anymore, so it doesn't really matter where it's at.
4510972	4520479	It's a little bit better to be slightly inconvenienced to walk, oh, the few feet to the back of the building, as opposed to having them destroy a game that a lot of people really like.
4521340	4526043	Let's see, DDR USA, well, I personally don't know because I don't play it.
4526543	4527704	It seems to be working alright.
4527924	4532027	Okay, Max 2 seemed to be just fine when I was playing on it.
4532327	4533428	It's still loud.
4533708	4537631	It's still, you know, bass is way too high and it's still eating coins every now and then.
4537671	4539973	Same with Drum Mania is starting to do that now, too.
4540481	4542642	Well, that's just, all that takes is maintenance and then fixing them.
4542662	4545942	Well, that's because they don't like to screw the coin sides to where they're supposed to be.
4545962	4547083	Hey, get them to sit there.
4547483	4549583	Well, para para worked just fine.
4549603	4552424	I did actually notice some sensor issues.
4553604	4556365	It looks like one of the sides has drooped down just a little bit.
4556385	4559526	I think people have been, you know, hopping up there and holding on to the thing.
4559866	4565407	You know, I don't blame them for not being able to read the warning since it's in Japanese, but still, you know, they should know better.
4565447	4566128	It's common sense.
4566188	4567608	Unfortunately, not enough people have it.
4569292	4573878	And on another note, most of the coin slots on Turtles in Time is broken.
4574319	4574860	I am upset.
4576743	4577183	That is all.
4577784	4577984	Yes.
4579166	4581109	And that's all.
4581129	4582712	Well, thank you for that lovely update.
4583379	4584999	Alright, we're going to take another quick break.
4585620	4591902	And when we come back, we're going to talk about... Why don't we go ahead and do the best 2DX song?
4592482	4594522	To celebrate Kind of Sick style a little bit.
4594542	4597683	We'll try to narrow it down to what the best 2DX song in history is.
4598543	4599204	Sounds fun to you guys?
4600604	4605908	So we'll come back and we're going to do a little segment we call List List with the best 2DX song ever.
4606008	4610531	And you guys in the chat room are going to be the ones that ultimately decide what it is.
4610871	4612412	So get on in our chat room right away.
4612713	4624881	We're on irc.eggheads.org or karma.othersideirc.net Just any other side IRC server that you can think of and you're just going to join Channel Orange Lounge.
4625221	4628924	And you guys can help us pick the best 2DX song ever.
4629545	4633919	and in this break we're going to hear a couple more requests and we'll be right back.
4718397	4719118	Thanks for watching!
4933047	4933458	DarkSakura
5024885	5030267	Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Balls
5053696	5054377	Ever, ever, ever.
5054797	5057498	And to do that, we're going to do a little segment we call Listless.
5058239	5066464	And participating today in the Listless segment will be myself, Jamie, Matt, Joe, Bradley, and Brad and Irene.
5066684	5071767	Since they're a couple, they're basically essentially one person, so they'll be doing one big list as one person.
5072047	5081813	And what we're going to do is each of us are going to name off our top three songs, and then we get to go around and everybody will get to eliminate one song from the big list.
5082413	5111537	and then after that we'll have a list of let's see 12 songs unless there's some duplication we might have a little less but there'll be 12 or less songs and that's when you three or you guys in the chat room get to pick your top three songs and we'll do a vote over a really quick break we'll do about a three minute break that you guys will have to vote so and we're already getting people screaming in the chat room their votes but remember you guys can only vote for stuff that ends up on the list so if your stuff doesn't end up on the list sorry it just can't be considered you're only going to be able to vote for stuff that's on the list
5112062	5112263	Colors
5123041	5123602	Any reason why?
5124782	5133629	I've been listening, that's like one of the few songs to recently come out for 2DX that I've literally listened to ten times in a row because I absolutely love the song.
5133850	5134910	Okay.
5135471	5141896	Yeah, it's just, I don't know, it actually just sort of reminded me of a bunch of stuff, so I like it.
5142968	5145710	Just a note to the chat room, please don't flood your votes.
5145910	5149431	We hear you loud and clear the first line, so you don't have to type it 60 times, your votes.
5151772	5153513	My number three pick would be Star Mine.
5153933	5156094	I would say it would be one of the best 2DX songs.
5156154	5156975	And Waving Fun.
5159156	5161097	Yes, the video has a big part to do with that.
5161137	5161897	So who's going to go next?
5161937	5167279	Joe, you want to go next?
5167359	5167900	Cracker.
5169467	5170087	I don't know.
5170187	5172188	Yes, we have the vote for Cracker.
5173388	5175108	Japanese hip-hop is funny.
5175628	5176228	Yes, it is.
5177389	5178529	All right, and for Matt.
5180029	5189771	All right, my number three has to be... I guess it's going to have to be A. It's going to be A as your number three choice.
5189991	5191211	A from Seventh Style.
5191231	5191251	A?
5191991	5192251	All right.
5193011	5193691	Thank you very much.
5193931	5194452	Any other reasons?
5194472	5196572	Do you want to elaborate why or just because you like it?
5198604	5199744	I like Piano Ambient.
5200365	5200725	Okay.
5201625	5202646	And next we have Bradley.
5204847	5205787	Hopefully I'll decide.
5206347	5208928	I've actually decided, so I'll go with number three as Calcutta.
5209388	5210569	Calcutta!
5210589	5211549	Calcutta!
5212249	5215831	It's a fun song and it has my favorite sequence in it to play.
5216391	5216671	Alright.
5218132	5220153	Next up, Brad and Irene as one person.
5220333	5222173	Our number three will have to be I Feel.
5222694	5223834	I Feel, ah.
5224694	5225135	Okay.
5225475	5226055	Why do you like that one?
5227125	5228086	I feel it's a great song.
5228106	5229868	Your number two choice, Jamie.
5246855	5247675	My number two choice?
5248376	5257280	Okay, I actually did scratch off, you know, my Fuck You song, Slugwork, because, well, it kind of fell off once I heard Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock.
5258280	5269285	That one, not only is it one of my favorites to listen to, it's probably one of my favorites to play, except for that, you know, I either get the scratching or I don't, so it's a fun one overall.
5269750	5270971	Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock.
5270991	5271352	Good choice.
5271832	5276337	My number two pick for best 2DX song ever would be Love is Dreaminess.
5276377	5277158	Love is Crack.
5277278	5278719	The video is cool.
5278800	5279640	I love the song.
5279901	5280882	I love the vocals in it.
5281042	5281863	So, Love is Dreaminess.
5283645	5285707	We have a comment about its difficulty.
5287324	5288184	It's just too damn hard.
5288224	5292746	I just played it like five minutes ago, I think.
5293007	5304732	That song and one other, or probably the last two I have left to pass in Light Seven on Fifth Style is Love is Dreaminess and Regulus, also known as the Cardcaptor Sakura theme.
5305892	5306793	Anyway, next is Matt.
5308598	5311540	All right, my next one is going to have to be Nemesis.
5311960	5313000	Nemesis, all right.
5313340	5314361	From Seventh Style.
5314961	5315401	Sixth Style.
5315521	5315862	Oh, Sixth Style.
5315882	5316082	I'm sorry.
5316102	5316762	Whoops, my bad.
5317002	5317402	Sixth Style.
5317983	5318983	Why would you choose Nemesis?
5319543	5320644	It's an awesome trance song.
5321024	5321644	What can I say?
5322925	5323705	Okay, works for me.
5323945	5324425	How about Joe?
5324966	5325686	What was your number two pick?
5327447	5327987	S.O.S.
5328007	5328287	S.O.S.
5328347	5329508	Another Dr. Bombay song.
5329548	5329928	Why is that?
5330538	5332439	I don't know, it's just crazy, I guess.
5332919	5334099	The video is absolutely funny.
5334139	5335420	Well put, well put, it's fucking crazy.
5335520	5335860	Alright.
5336200	5339501	Wait, I'm sorry, I need to ask, the speed version or Dr. Bombay's version?
5340942	5341702	Speed, I guess.
5341942	5348864	The speed, okay, so it's not Dr. Bombay, we're talking about the speed version by, I believe it's Dr. It's not Dr. Bombay.
5348965	5349805	Dr. Jekyll, thank you.
5349925	5350305	Dr. Jekyll.
5350925	5353046	Alright, passing off to Bradley.
5355549	5356709	I'll go for my second pick.
5356789	5358590	I'll go for Outer Wall.
5359150	5359850	Outer Wall!
5359870	5361890	Because I liked it as soon as I heard it on FifthStyle.
5362110	5363711	I can play it every time I play a game.
5366031	5366271	Outer Wall.
5366291	5367832	You can do that?
5367892	5368372	Outer Wall?
5368432	5371012	Yeah, that was actually my wallpaper for the longest time.
5371112	5371432	Right on.
5371532	5375993	When they released all the FifthStyle pictures, I had Outer Wall up there for like three months.
5376233	5378934	Okay, so we got everybody's number three and number two choices.
5378994	5379594	No, I'm sorry.
5379614	5380314	You've got to get Brad's.
5380354	5380874	Oh, we have Brad.
5381995	5382875	Don't forget me.
5383235	5383455	Okay.
5383840	5387001	Um, I'd have to say my number two is Gravity by TAC.
5387902	5388602	And you want to know why?
5389122	5390663	Because TAC owns you all.
5390743	5393524	I'm kind of surprised the amount of Seventh Style songs that are showing up here.
5393744	5394644	Seventh Style is really good.
5395164	5396545	Oh, that's a funny joke, Irene.
5396925	5402307	Well, no, see, that's the reason why actually I like it, because it sounds like another incarnation of one of my favorite songs, Electro Tune.
5402407	5404008	So, way to go, TAC.
5404108	5404628	Yeah, that works.
5405268	5405548	Alright.
5405849	5406769	It's just Attack, Attack.
5407133	5414818	Okay, so now everybody's... And we're already getting booed by a lot of people in the chat room for our choices, but you know... Well, you get to vote later.
5414878	5415538	Yeah, you get to vote.
5415638	5417799	Anyway, you'll get to determine the final list.
5417839	5419740	You'll also get a buggy of a week next week.
5420001	5420281	All right.
5421942	5422242	All right.
5422582	5423903	It's number one choices.
5423963	5427105	So your personal favorite 2DX song ever.
5427205	5427485	Jamie.
5428354	5432717	Okay, as if people can't figure out what mine is going to be, it's going to be Reincarnation.
5433237	5434017	Reincarnation.
5434037	5438320	And Brad totally called it.
5438420	5439280	Good choice, good choice.
5439480	5443643	Well, of course it's got to be Reincarnation, because I sat and was pissed at that song for weeks.
5443943	5448386	The first time I passed it on 7Key, my cat walks behind my PS2 and unplugs it.
5449146	5454129	And then I didn't pass it since until I actually got a third style from my friend while I was off at Anime Expo.
5454952	5462635	Okay, so my number one song, and I just, I absolutely fell in love with this song the first time I heard it, and it really is the song that just hooked me into 2DX.
5462655	5464416	I always thought it was cool, this is the song that hooked me into it.
5465076	5468478	Deadline was my number one favorite Mamani song ever.
5469778	5472019	So, Joe, why don't you give us your number one pick?
5474102	5476384	I also like this one in Fifth Economics.
5476464	5478806	It's Absolute by DJ Taka.
5479306	5479586	Yes.
5481688	5482508	He rules.
5482629	5483869	It's absolutely cool.
5484250	5485851	Yes, absolutely a good choice there.
5486231	5488473	All right, Matt, your number one pick.
5489694	5492096	My number one pick has to be In My Eyes from Fifth Economics.
5492236	5493437	In My Eyes, okay.
5495538	5497119	That one is not an easy one either.
5498220	5498801	All right, Bradley.
5502583	5503523	Bradley's number one choice.
5503923	5508625	Yeah, because I know Brad's going to say another one that could be my favorite, but I'm going to go with Presto.
5509325	5510185	Presto, okay.
5510205	5511726	I wish I could pass it, but I haven't gotten there.
5511866	5514407	Got 72% once, but... All right, Presto.
5515007	5518848	Okay, Presto is number one 2DX favorite song.
5518908	5521689	And you should see the another if you think the 7T is hard.
5521849	5524030	So here we go, the very last one on the list.
5524250	5525130	Brad's number one choice.
5525170	5525810	Our number one.
5526710	5527471	The envelope, please.
5528991	5530832	Oh, this is actually my number one.
5531092	5532012	I chose Love Will...
5532655	5534433	Love Will That's a great song Oh!
5537408	5539609	A lot of Rick on here, RIC.
5540489	5542089	I see Lovewill in my eyes.
5543710	5545670	I feel a lot of him on there.
5546150	5546790	Quite a bit of LED, too.
5546810	5548511	Well, yeah, they're all Kiriyama Oka, so.
5548811	5549411	Yeah, all right.
5550911	5554292	Okay, yeah, surprisingly, V did not show up on the list.
5554352	5555312	That kind of surprised me.
5555333	5556253	I thought somebody would say it.
5556633	5558013	I didn't say it because I thought somebody else would say it.
5558033	5559654	Because we couldn't name the Katimu version.
5559834	5562674	V did not show up on the list, but A did somehow, so.
5562774	5564375	We couldn't put the V vocal on there.
5564655	5565215	How about we all...
5565775	5569839	Make a cumulative vote of V We just want to add V on the list?
5569879	5586154	Yeah, we have a group vote of V V's on there Okay, so now we have 19 songs And we're going to now eliminate 6 of them And this is kind of a hard choice Because these are all really good songs on here So we're going to have to take off 6 of them So starting with Jamie
5587429	5590432	I have to eliminate one, huh?
5612348	5614569	I... I don't know.
5614749	5618891	I'm going to get rid... You know, I just... I don't like this song in 2DX.
5619171	5623493	I think it's just a song that should have been only in Keyboard Mania.
5623553	5624493	I'm getting rid of Presto.
5624793	5626114	I just don't... I don't care for it.
5626854	5627915	Dude, Presto.
5628655	5629636	It's a Keyboard Mania song.
5629716	5630656	I just don't like it in 2DX.
5630696	5630996	I'm sorry.
5631696	5633537	Alright, next we have Joe's book.
5634158	5635518	Joe, what do you want to take out the list?
5636218	5636959	Let me see.
5639440	5639600	Yeah.
5640640	5641981	Man, this is a tough one.
5642141	5642641	I don't know.
5642761	5645443	I'd probably take off, like, God.
5647444	5651187	Give me a sec.
5653508	5656910	A. You're taking off A. Oh.
5658171	5658291	Oh.
5658371	5660212	It's just too new.
5660332	5662173	It's just too new to be the best one ever.
5662594	5663054	All right.
5663374	5663874	All right.
5664235	5665375	A is gone.
5666156	5666476	All right.
5668681	5669422	Matt, you're next.
5669482	5670823	And I swear this isn't out of bitterness.
5671924	5672364	Cracker.
5672824	5673465	Cracker!
5676848	5678329	You know what, I have to agree.
5678349	5680551	That was my other choice.
5680711	5681551	Alright, next we have Bradley.
5682992	5684614	Bradley is taking one off.
5685074	5685535	What do you want?
5686575	5689437	I don't like colors all that much yet.
5701606	5705428	I'm going to call into the corner and cry.
5705749	5707309	Alright, Colors is gone, sorry.
5707450	5708630	Alright, next we have Brad.
5708690	5711832	But I can't hate Bradley because he brought me Twindi.
5713553	5714514	Goodbye, Calcutta.
5715054	5717195	Yes, goodbye, Calcutta.
5717755	5720037	Alright, Calcutta is gone.
5720057	5721998	Driving the taxi out of Calcutta.
5722722	5726827	Okay, so that leaves us with our final list, and they're going to vote on this in the chat room right now.
5727228	5732354	The only way I'm going to count your vote, you have to send me a private message with your vote.
5732414	5735798	So I'm in the chat room as S-K-I-E, and I have a little bar that says O-L.
5736178	5739322	You have to send me your vote as a private message, or it doesn't count.
5739402	5740604	Okay, here's the final list.
5741384	5755175	StarMine, I Feel, Infinite Prayer, Love is Dreaminess, Nemesis, Outer Wall, Gravity, Reincarnation, Deadline, Absolute, In My Eyes, Love Will, and V. That's a whole big list.
5755215	5759538	And remember, your vote only counts if you send it to me as a private message.
5759999	5762501	So we're going to give you three minutes to do it.
5762581	5764262	So send me those right now.
5764322	5768706	And in the meantime, we're going to hear the full version of Moment, a pretty cool five-key BB&E song.
5768746	5769026	Here you go.
5774060	5775182	Thanks for watching!
5814906	5815026	Thanks for watching!
5991681	5996646	After listening to three hours of them, you'll want to ski into a tree headfirst.
5997475	6001257	Under Sedation Live with Travis, Rob, and Jessica.
6001757	6007720	Saturdays, 6.30pm to 9.30pm Pacific Standard Time at UnderSedationLive.org.
6017131	6018892	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
6019112	6021894	Because Bongo demands it.
6045356	6046217	We have a few winners.
6046357	6052081	We have, in third place, for best 2DX song ever is, StarMine!
6052501	6054082	Yay!
6054843	6058586	Second place for best 2DX song ever, Love Will.
6058786	6059666	Yay!
6059747	6060847	Alright, alright.
6061488	6068753	And, the best 2DX song, as voted by our chatroom, Tremble Please.
6068773	6069233	Tremble Please.
6070587	6073709	Absolute was voted the best 2DX song ever.
6101147	6101548	No, no.
6101668	6104829	The only joust that I do is on the Atari 5200.
6105129	6105469	Thank you.
6106210	6106470	All right.
6106510	6109831	So once again, third place was StarMine.
6109911	6110331	I'm sorry.
6111092	6111912	Wait, hold on one second.
6112012	6112612	Second place.
6112632	6113112	Yes, what?
6113873	6117634	When I hear Absolute, I definitely do not think of, like, going and jousting.
6118435	6120055	Where the hell did that come from?
6120476	6124497	It comes from the fact that Ultracade happens to be right there, which has joust in it.
6124918	6125618	So when...
6126297	6128478	I've seen so much Alanis Morissette videos, haven't you?
6128518	6131479	Her precious illusions, medieval... I didn't even think of that.
6131560	6131960	No, no.
6132020	6133580	They don't joust in that video.
6134001	6135221	Shut up.
6135581	6137462	Go make a jousting freestyle for DDR.
6138063	6138943	Maybe I will.
6139423	6140244	I just might.
6140364	6141724	But you have to come out on the bird.
6142445	6143945	You have to have the bird from Joust.
6144626	6145746	Will you be my bird, Jamie?
6145906	6146387	Oh, no!
6147828	6150850	No, I'll like go mutate you on or something.
6153011	6154312	In my secret nest.
6154332	6155733	You'll be the big flying alligator.
6156473	6159375	Did you have something you wanted to say?
6159955	6161696	Totally unrelated to this.
6161716	6162717	Do you have a new topic?
6162937	6163897	I have a new topic.
6163957	6164878	Alright, new topic.
6165578	6166379	Let's finish the old topic.
6166399	6167039	We'll go to your new topic.
6167785	6174907	Just before you finish this, I'd like to say that I'm very displeased with all of you because you took off the best songs.
6175207	6176107	All of the songs I picked.
6176727	6179087	And my opinion is the only one that matters.
6179688	6180428	I am God!
6180448	6181488	What?
6181668	6181908	Okay.
6182948	6183448	I didn't.
6184049	6186489	I'm good.
6187269	6188049	Wait, where's my vomit?
6188229	6188770	Do the vomit.
6189170	6189830	Do the vomit.
6190010	6190610	Give me the vomit.
6190750	6192550	You have to say, show me the vomit.
6193091	6194151	Show me the vomit!
6194211	6194951	You can't tell the truth.
6198419	6199341	Okay, I'm sorry.
6199561	6201103	Guys, I love you guys.
6201583	6203966	Now, apologize to the chatroom and say you're sorry and you love them.
6204507	6205909	I love you guys, chatroom.
6207170	6208813	How many people do we have in the chatroom right now?
6209634	6209894	Thirteen.
6210626	6212007	Okay, I love you, all 13 of you.
6213088	6213508	All at once.
6213528	6214949	But Brad and I are the only people that have taste.
6215990	6216971	Oh, Jamie!
6218652	6219833	As if I wasn't harsh enough.
6220613	6222154	No, you all have good taste.
6222294	6224256	Absolute was a good choice from the majority.
6224716	6225897	Yeah, I think Absolute's pretty.
6226157	6227058	It's fair, it's fair.
6227098	6232582	Alright, on a total, in another part of the country, in another dimension, we have other news.
6232862	6233282	Yes, Matt?
6233543	6234403	Well, let's see here.
6234543	6239387	Since there's not really much sim news going on, since all the websites are down because of bandwidth issues...
6240047	6248716	We have one thing, the DDR East Coast Invasion DWI contest the results are in, and I'm very disappointed with them.
6249977	6251999	Now that's your own personal damn opinion, by the way.
6252200	6257465	Hey, it's my personal opinion, you know, being the sort of sim expert here, and I've played all of these.
6257805	6258365	I'll give you that.
6258426	6260487	Out of the people in this room, you would be the sim expert.
6260627	6264210	Because you've been playing StepMania, DWI, and all that before.
6264270	6266291	They were cool and looked like Max and all that.
6266311	6266832	So I'll give you that.
6266992	6267492	Yeah, okay.
6267532	6270294	Well, third place was Evolution.
6270695	6273057	I believe it was... It's not above it.
6273097	6273397	Let's see.
6273817	6281480	by Mercury Storm, and if my memory serves me right, I believe it was the Evolution Time is Pop mix, if I remember correctly.
6282721	6288444	Second place was Naturally by Bimani Ruler, which should have taken it, and, you know, I'm very disappointed.
6289504	6299549	And first place was Healing Vision Half Mix, which is like a remix of Healing Vision with Healing Vision and Angelic mixed together, which is really goddamn retarded by CMCM.
6299569	6301730	Feel a little strongly there about that, don't you?
6301750	6302610	It is retarded.
6302990	6307491	Now, I'd like to add that if I had entered, I would have probably won, but that's just me.
6308792	6309292	Oh, I see.
6309612	6312513	I thought you were going to be doing an entry with... Can I say what you were going to do?
6312713	6313313	Yeah, go ahead.
6313513	6319875	You were going to go ahead and do an era good, cool, fat mix, the kind of rap version era, which is, by the way, on our playlist for Bomani Music and More.
6320135	6328678	You were going to do a... I was doing that, and I kind of slacked off and procrastinated on it and didn't quite get it done.
6329498	6345568	so that's why I don't have it and I was even planning to make my own video and that would have made me win but unfortunately I didn't get a chance to enter it and they're still going to have some more contests so I'll plan on entering those I'll get some done I've got a list of stuff I've got to make but I haven't had time
6346676	6347557	Okay, you just haven't had time.
6347577	6348318	You've been too lazy.
6348518	6351761	Well, actually, over the last couple weeks, I haven't had air conditioning.
6352041	6356826	And I couldn't sit at home and program, you know, steps in, like, 102 degrees in my house.
6356926	6359629	So I said, you know, the hell with it, and went and played DDR instead.
6361150	6364513	Chatroom does... A lot of fans of the Half Mix there in the chatroom.
6365835	6367056	They seem to like it, some of them.
6367937	6369999	So, I don't know, just to each their own, I suppose.
6371247	6373008	It was good, but it wasn't the best.
6373148	6374589	Oh, okay.
6374830	6376871	Them's fighting words, Matt.
6376911	6378693	Hey, next time I will show them up.
6378713	6379754	Seriously.
6379794	6380675	I'll be there.
6380695	6381856	You'll be there with bells on.
6381956	6382796	Yes, I will be there.
6382816	6384998	The next contest that they have, I will enter.
6385078	6388101	You will see Loki plastered to something on there.
6388281	6389662	So I will definitely enter.
6389742	6390043	Alright.
6390663	6391144	We trust you.
6391764	6392544	We're looking forward to it.
6413534	6435474	and some people have been sending us some of their own homemade remixes so Jamie and I are going to tear through some of those and we might put a couple of those up in a rotation because we don't want to just draw the line on Bomani songs as you know in our music show we do sometimes put in songs we think ought to be in Bomani we put in some Parappa stuff just for laughs and other things pump it up stuff just because it might as well be Bomani
6435794	6438036	I'm thinking we could even take live bands.
6438316	6442159	If there's a local band in the area, we'd support Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
6442199	6442799	Sure, sure.
6442919	6452967	So anything you think, if you've made a song and you think it deserves to be in DDR, 2DX, any of those games, I say it's good enough for our station, so send it to us and we'll listen to it.
6452987	6455929	And yes, I have already gotten a few remixes, so Jamie and I are going through those.
6456429	6466035	I was sent a Hysteria remix by JB, and I believe there's also supposed to be a remix of Cowgirl that he's going to send me pretty soon, so I'll have to take a listen to those.
6466556	6469297	And Kiel also has a pretty good papaya mix there.
6469578	6470618	Oh yes, I love that.
6470658	6480645	He'll go ahead, and if I ask him to, go ahead Kiel, plug your website there in the chat room, and he's got a great papaya mix there, so if you're in the chat room, go check that out, it's pretty funny, pretty good stuff.
6481485	6483927	I say funny because papaya makes me laugh, just her voice, I don't know.
6484207	6492528	Yes, and I'd like to say that I do have some of Kiel's songs in my sim I've got those off of the Monty Ruler site and they're pretty good, I like them
6494522	6495503	So lots of support.
6495563	6496323	Keep up the good work.
6496363	6496644	Cool.
6497144	6498165	So we're going to be doing that soon.
6498185	6500326	That's a future direction Orange Lounge Radio is going to be taking.
6502428	6505250	Gosh, I think we're damn near out of topics to talk about.
6505330	6507632	So how about we just talk about other stuff?
6507652	6508653	How's your guys' week been going?
6510334	6512135	Any funny DDR stories from the week?
6512276	6515598	Oh, well, I think we might have toxic mold in our apartment.
6515818	6516198	Why is that?
6516639	6518060	Because I'm coughing up like...
6518340	6519101	Thank you for watching!
6535922	6538684	The way Brad plays DDR is really hilarious.
6538905	6540886	The way he dances when he does doubles.
6541306	6547031	It's like the center of his body is completely on the other pad as to where his legs are.
6547472	6548572	And he's embarrassed.
6548613	6549453	He's turning the color pink here.
6549473	6550034	But it's so true.
6550074	6550654	It's cool.
6550994	6555098	I love watching Brad do doubles because it looks like those videos.
6555118	6558821	You ever seen those videos where they split the screen in half and the head's over here and the feet's over here?
6559221	6560943	That's what Brad looks like when he dances.
6561750	6563490	But his style is absolutely awesome.
6563911	6564131	It is.
6564731	6565451	And it's lanky.
6565971	6566591	Lanky style.
6567491	6567871	Yes.
6568552	6572512	You know, I'm still think it's pretty cool to be able to pass Catastrophics.
6572552	6573633	You know, I don't care what someone says.
6573693	6575053	Oh, we can pass them all.
6575073	6575773	We don't keep count.
6576193	6576913	I keep count.
6576953	6578074	So, damn it.
6578494	6580454	I passed my 16th Catastrophic.
6580534	6581074	Yay.
6581274	6583515	I passed Kakumei like the first time I played it.
6583595	6584275	God, that song was...
6584595	6586677	I feel was freaking easy.
6586697	6590360	You've been playing the katas since, like, what, second, third mix?
6590400	6590720	I don't know.
6590740	6592042	When did you start playing the katas?
6592102	6595024	I first started trying them when third mix had just come out.
6595044	6596045	I had second mix at home.
6596385	6598167	Now, is it just me or are the katas getting easier?
6598948	6605452	You know, they are, like, um, you know, I went and tried, uh, well, my knee gave out on me trying Dead End last night, but, you know, Dead End is still hard to me.
6605752	6614297	However, you know, I was thinking that Kakame was going to be this end-all difficult song, because Burning Heat was so freaking evil, and Kakame was just so damn easy.
6614897	6619159	And I feel, you know, people were saying, oh, I feel is so hard because the steps don't make sense.
6619339	6621741	The steps make perfect sense if you just listen to the music.
6621781	6623582	That song was absolutely, it...
6624202	6628468	Cacame was slightly easier, but I feel it was easier than some seven-footers.
6628589	6629570	I mean, it was that easy.
6629850	6631613	Yeah, I mean, I definitely agree.
6631873	6635418	I just have to say, Jamie's opinion is spreading faster in Anna Nicole Smith's legs right now.
6636320	6636840	Okay.
6638115	6640517	I have to definitely agree that the cadets have been way easier.
6640537	6643499	The only few cadets that I can't pass are off of third mix.
6643519	6646581	You know, we've got Afranova, which I'm talking about doubles here.
6646962	6648323	Well, actually, probably singles too.
6648643	6650464	So I've got Afranova, Dead End.
6650624	6652366	Well, Dead End I can pass singles, but not doubles.
6652606	6653646	And Paranoia Rebirth.
6654367	6655468	I can't pass that on doubles.
6656556	6658257	I have my list somewhere I'll go get it
6676230	6678053	You know, takes their head out of their ass and fixes it.
6678093	6688587	Because I like the really hard, you know, the super hardness of like, you know, Max 300, Max Unlimited, but I want more songs like Afronova doubles Maniac, you know.
6688647	6692072	Something like that's not extremely hard, but yet still a good workout, you know.
6692941	6699522	Now, one of my favorite katas, something I kind of liked about Max, too, was that a lot of the steps started to go with the music a little better.
6699542	6704723	It kind of made a lot of the katas were actually fun to dance to, as opposed to just being like a bunch of really fast eighth notes.
6704743	6715146	You know, one of my favorite katas, and I know this is an overplayed song, but just bear with me, Sugaru, I think is one of the coolest katas because the dance goes with the music so well that it's really fun to dance to.
6715166	6716446	Do you agree with me, or...?
6716946	6717927	Yeah, it's very good.
6718447	6721330	Suaru was one of the ones they really, I think, they did a great job on.
6721350	6726133	I think that's one of the few Max 2 songs I could say they did not, you know, skimp on for us.
6726414	6727615	But I have to say something before we go on.
6727975	6731117	Somebody in there, it seems like a couple people don't seem to like Primeval.
6731858	6734260	Oh my god, can you guys beat it on Maniac Doubles?
6734460	6738683	Because try doing it down at AX where they have, like, dust all over it.
6738703	6739184	AI?
6739204	6742526	And you're sliding all over... AI, that's what I meant.
6742547	6743087	Thank you, Jamie.
6743107	6743147	AI.
6744568	6755350	Oh my god, everybody in the entire arcade turned around to watch me try to beat that thing, because you can't play, you can't stick to the machine on Afronova Primeval Devils, it's just... So yeah, let's see you try it.
6755671	6762092	You know what, this is my opinion of what a kata should be, is a song that you should not be able to beat your first time.
6762952	6766953	And at least three on Max 2, I have gone and beaten instantly.
6766993	6770514	Well, like, you know, some of the songs were actually the first time I'd actually ever tried them, the ones they upgraded.
6770994	6771995	Paranoia, K-Set, Clean Mix
6790786	6791707	They upgraded that to a 9.
6791807	6793368	You have to remember also, Jimmy, you're getting better.
6793728	6796090	So, you know, you're going to start beating more things on the first time.
6796130	6798832	You still shouldn't be able to beat a 9-footer your first time.
6798852	6802375	Do you think that's why they've invented, I guess, so to speak, the 10-footer?
6803055	6806938	Because now they're going to start adding songs that are 10 feet that you're just not going to be able to beat your first time.
6807238	6812402	Although there's going to be people out there that just, you know, they're so good at DDR at this point, you know, they're going to beat it the first time.
6812542	6813603	There's nothing Konami can do.
6813803	6818687	I still think the game, you know, I'm glad they put in the Oni courses because that keeps the challenge, but that's like a PA challenge.
6819107	6823010	They need to have, I mean, there's not really any way to increase the difficulty past where it is.
6823670	6824611	There's not really a way.
6824651	6827453	I mean, I know there's going to be stuff I can't pass today.
6827493	6829194	That's the one that gives me issues.
6829615	6831476	You could do a six panel.
6831556	6835219	If they made six panel more than just solo, I mean, could that be a new challenge?
6835239	6835939	Six panel still kills me.
6836160	6837581	Yeah, I mean, six panel is a little crazy.
6837781	6838541	Solo sucks anyway.
6839602	6840342	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6860794	6862815	I feel follows the back pattern in the music.
6862835	6863375	Well, it does.
6863475	6864355	Every edit I make.
6864856	6869617	It does, but the problem is maybe that doesn't flow quite as well as they could have done it.
6870518	6873979	See, I didn't really think it did not flow, but then again, that's what I listened to.
6874019	6875460	It's weird to dance to.
6875520	6877620	It's so kind of like off and weird.
6877640	6878921	I didn't think it was weird at all.
6879679	6879979	Backbeats
6902956	6906597	and Orion78, it's like your feet kind of make another instrument.
6906637	6912780	Those are kind of cool katas because they take a while to kind of learn how to play that instrument and then your feet kind of make a new tune.
6912800	6913760	I kind of think those katas are fun.
6913780	6920143	That was sort of the basis for another, for my DXY edit another, which the challenge is still out there if you want free food, okay?
6920943	6922744	Do you want to just run over your challenge one more time?
6923684	6935741	Okay, for anybody who can either full combo or 90% perfect attack my DXY edit another, I will take you out to a dinner of up to $15.
6935781	6936662	How does that sound?
6936682	6937924	Of course, provided I can afford it.
6939925	6941806	Well, keep in mind, I'm unemployed right now.
6941826	6947747	I may have to owe you a rain check, but I will definitely, the first person who does it, you are getting taken out to a nice dinner.
6950008	6950788	And what do we hear?
6951568	6952689	I want my GC.
6952889	6953789	Okay, okay.
6954169	6956269	Yes, this has to go for the second challenge.
6959090	6969877	And for whoever can full combo my Look to the Sky edit with at least a 90% perfect attack, then you get a free GameCube pen, which is still in my purse.
6970197	6973699	Woohoo!
6973739	6980364	Oh, if you can send me proof that it's been passed, then send me a photo of the screen, or video or something.
6981144	6984826	Send me physical proof and I will be sending you a GameCube pen.
6985527	6986687	Alright, pretty cool.
6988290	6989390	We still have about three minutes left.
6989410	6990791	Anybody got any other closing thoughts?
6990811	6991451	Just for anything.
6991511	6992451	Doesn't have to be Bomani.
6992751	6994992	Anything you guys want to talk about?
6995232	6996572	My spoon is too big.
6998472	7000473	Austin Powers 3 coming out this Friday.
7000833	7001333	Oh yeah.
7002313	7004694	Same jokes as Austin 1 and 2, I bet you anything.
7005034	7005854	Same jokes.
7006274	7007255	I don't think they can do that.
7007715	7008575	I don't care.
7009115	7010175	I want to go see it.
7014255	7015975	Yeah, everyone's pointing them back?
7015995	7017316	Because we can't pick it up.
7017336	7018556	We want comments from Irene.
7019076	7019796	I'm sorry.
7020276	7022057	All I was going to say is that I got a different car.
7022217	7022617	Wow.
7022837	7023657	Congratulations.
7023697	7024897	You finally got rid of the Golf, right?
7025037	7025457	Yeah.
7025477	7026137	All right, way to go.
7026218	7027818	Actually, I need people to do me a favor.
7028078	7028578	Huh, what's that?
7029098	7036740	For people, it doesn't matter what part of the country you're in, I need some people to help me find an 83 Toyota Corolla AE86 hatchback.
7037080	7038060	That's quite a request.
7038100	7041541	Because, so I can have my Trano ended up like the initial D car.
7041561	7042681	You want fries for that?
7043301	7046302	If anyone can find one or has one for sale, let me know.
7046422	7046962	I will buy it.
7050023	7051964	And Eight-Legged Freaks was okay.
7052664	7053224	Go see it, though.
7053484	7055044	It looks so retarded.
7055084	7056285	It was a drive-in movie.
7056365	7057365	It looks retarded.
7057425	7058625	Okay, I went and saw it.
7058825	7060186	I based my opinion on the trailers.
7060226	7061446	Here's my best way to describe it.
7062046	7067768	It was better than Tremors, but not quite as good as Gremlins.
7068788	7069968	It was just campy.
7070028	7071029	It was meant to be campy.
7071049	7072029	It was meant to be stupid.
7072069	7074389	The whole point is that it has very little plot.
7074409	7076590	You just watch a bunch of people try to survive spiders.
7077270	7078190	And that's the whole movie.
7078230	7079011	It's a drive-in movie.
7079051	7080391	It's meant to be cheesy and corny.
7080451	7083612	It's paying homage to all those giant monster movies of the 50s.
7087493	7088493	Arachnophobia was better.
7089033	7092374	You know, arachnophobia, when I saw that, I went to go make out with somebody.
7094054	7095074	You dog!
7095094	7097175	They didn't have eight legs, did they?
7098883	7100065	I wasn't watching the movie.
7114202	7121950	After this show is over, why don't you give a listen to our Bomani Music and More program, playing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, when this show is not on the air.
7122170	7128737	And we're going to be putting new stuff this week into the rotation, all sorts of new crap, including some of the stuff you heard tonight on the show.
7129598	7131199	And I believe that's about it.
7131980	7133241	Anything else you want to say, Jamie?
7133602	7137966	I'm going to go officially brain dead once the show is over, so I have nothing else to say.
7138126	7138686	Alright, sounds good.
7138946	7139907	Thanks everybody for listening.
7139927	7141788	We'll see you next week at 7 o'clock.
7141828	7147310	If you missed any part of the show, we'll be rebroadcasting tonight's show tomorrow night at 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
7147410	7148130	Have a good night everybody.
7148230	7148791	Thanks for listening.
7148891	7149351	Good night.
7150797	7152999	Remember kids, that glue you use in school?
7153059	7154580	It's made from dead horses!
7154660	7156201	No Wilbur, it's just a sprain!
7179136	7182684	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
