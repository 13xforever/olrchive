You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Our live talk program begins now.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
All your days are belong to us.

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
God damn you, stop calling here! Isn't this 4, 2, 1, 5 pussy wave? You bitch!

00:50.000 --> 00:52.500
Let me check the zip code. You want to fuck you?

00:52.500 --> 00:54.000
You have no morals.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of herpes.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.500
Kiss my grass, mooch.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.000
Mecha licka hi, mecha hiney ho.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Oh my god, I hate growing up in public.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.500
Me too!

01:07.500 --> 01:08.500
Fucker yet?

01:08.500 --> 01:10.000
I'm working on it.

01:10.000 --> 01:10.500
Loser.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.000
Lame!

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
On the side of my face.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Breathing.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Grassless.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Heaving grass.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Heaving.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Whatever.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
Now you all just sit there and keep your mouth shut while I go listen to my written experience records.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
The next director's up. I am your singing telegram.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Somewhere inside the state of California in the great nation of the United States of America on the planet Earth,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio is now on the air.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
You're tuned in to the Bimani scene's newest and greatest radio station of all things Bimani.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
Joining me, as always, is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, also known as DarkSakura.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Welcome back!

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah, I'm back, and I'm sad.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
I am 100% glad to be back. The trip was interesting, to say the least.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
And we'll definitely get into that a little bit more later, right, Jamie?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, yes!

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Alright.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
So, this is episode number four for July the 14th of 2002.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
We are joined in studio once again by many, many, many guests.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
We've got Matt, Dave, hello, Dave's here, and Paul's here in the house.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
And we'll be talking to all of them a little bit more later, but first we're going to take a real quick break.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Any other opening thoughts from you, Miss?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Did you say I get to break stuff?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Sure, if you want. Just not anything I own.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
You can break my roommate's stuff, though. He's on vacation.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Oh, cool. I think I'll just break this thing over here.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
All right, sounds good.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
I'm going to start off this first break with a request here.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.800
a couple requests in our chat room. Why don't you go ahead and join our chat room if you

02:39.800 --> 02:49.800
want to. You just have to join IRC.Akeheads.org or any other side IRC chat server. One of

02:49.800 --> 02:55.200
them would be also karma.othersideirc.net and then we're just in Channel Pound Orange

02:55.200 --> 02:58.880
Lounge. It's just that easy. I've got a few requests in here. We're going to start it

02:58.880 --> 03:05.880
off with from Chutiex7style, this is Dumond with Never Look Back.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.380
I'm just here to stay

03:33.380 --> 03:34.880
I'm here to stay

05:34.880 --> 05:41.880
Masi o alu de yudanga nebo se mana koten

05:41.880 --> 05:45.880
Asuri nan kashii ni naga za

05:45.880 --> 05:48.880
Solano kara dakara

05:48.880 --> 05:51.880
Nagale washi go mita

05:51.880 --> 05:54.880
Iyasore washi ga u

05:54.880 --> 06:00.880
Mada hiru managori

06:30.880 --> 06:54.880
Blow my whistle, baby Open up and put it in

06:54.880 --> 06:55.880
Lick it

07:08.880 --> 07:10.880
Throw it like you made it blow

07:10.880 --> 07:36.160
Let me hear you say, Louder Let me hear you say, Louder

07:36.160 --> 07:39.160
Is that what you call loud?

07:40.160 --> 07:42.160
Come on, let me hear you say

07:43.160 --> 07:45.160
Let me hear you say

07:47.160 --> 07:49.160
Louder

07:50.160 --> 07:51.160
I said louder

07:51.160 --> 08:10.160
You need to bring the beat back Blow my whistle, baby

08:10.160 --> 08:15.880
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

08:15.880 --> 08:18.880
Do it all night. Do it with me.

08:18.880 --> 08:23.880
No, no. That was awful. Bloody terrible. Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.880
In the heat of the night.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.880
Oh, God. I think my ears are bleeding.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.880
I liked it.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.880
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next.

08:32.880 --> 08:37.880
Oh, that was cool.

08:37.880 --> 08:42.880
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic. Next.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.880
That was just bloody pathetic. Next!

08:44.880 --> 08:49.880
Come on baby, come on, do it with me.

08:49.880 --> 08:53.880
Yes, yes, that's it! We have a winner!

08:53.880 --> 08:58.880
A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.880
That's right, A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

09:01.880 --> 09:06.880
Hey, they were saying that the old promos were getting a little old, so we had to make that new one before the show started tonight.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.880
Now we have new old promos.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.880
That's right, now we have new old promos to play the hell out with here.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.900
Alrighty, a big hello to everybody by the way tonight in our chat room, we've got a

09:14.900 --> 09:17.920
pretty crowded chat room there tonight, so thanks everybody for listening in, and those

09:17.920 --> 09:21.920
last few songs were for some people that were listening in the chat room, we had Don't Look

09:21.920 --> 09:25.980
Back and The Whistle Song were both requested, and I threw Jet Ninja in there too because

09:25.980 --> 09:28.640
I know a lot of people like that one.

09:28.640 --> 09:29.640
Thank you Paul for that lovely hooray.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.400
Yes we have a hooray from the background.

09:31.400 --> 09:37.460
Speaking of The Whistle Song, very interesting, I personally think it's the most interesting

09:37.460 --> 09:40.960
song in Max 2 out of anything. And it was the one that probably got the biggest reaction

09:40.960 --> 09:43.720
in the chat room. People going, oh yeah, I really want to hear this song, I don't know

09:43.720 --> 09:48.840
why, it just really kind of gets in your mind and just messes with you to like, I hate this

09:48.840 --> 09:52.200
song, this is the scrubbiest song on the face of the earth, when people play this in the

09:52.200 --> 09:57.680
arcade, they sing along to it, and I want to kill myself. What is it about the whistle

09:57.680 --> 10:02.180
saw? It was weird because when it first came out, you know, when Max 2 News was first coming

10:02.180 --> 10:06.200
out, people said, oh, that song is going to be the most overplayed Max 2 song because

10:06.200 --> 10:10.920
it has the word bitch in it. Then we find out they censored bitch and it just says baby.

10:10.920 --> 10:15.160
I mean, unless you're looking at the banner, but whatever. It says baby in the actual song.

10:15.160 --> 10:20.040
And people are afraid to play it because they don't want to play it out, right? I guess?

10:20.040 --> 10:26.640
I don't know. They all play Sugaru. They all play Sugaru, which is not even as good as

10:26.640 --> 10:32.040
the song. So instead they play Sugaru, play that out. But then it's like all of a sudden

10:32.040 --> 10:35.760
somebody actually plays the whistle song and now it's like, oh, people are playing this

10:35.760 --> 10:39.580
and it's pretty cool, and now the Whistle song is a cool song, but now it's getting

10:39.580 --> 10:43.540
overplayed again. It's frustratingly catchy, that's the thing.

10:43.540 --> 10:46.780
It's just infectious, it gets in my mind, and it never gets out.

10:46.780 --> 10:56.820
It feels like burning! My brain! Any other interesting songs that you just

10:56.820 --> 11:02.960
kind of totally changed your opinion on? Old school song, but love that feeling.

11:02.960 --> 11:08.880
I hated that song, everybody hated that song, and then it kept coming up on my non-stops

11:08.880 --> 11:12.120
on my lovely Dreamcast edition, so I learned to like it.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.960
And then I was the only one who did.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.700
Later on tonight we're going to be doing our very own version of Listless here, and we

11:18.700 --> 11:24.560
are going to be determining the worst Bahmani song in history next to Let Them Move, because

11:24.560 --> 11:28.680
Let Them Move, it's already given that wins, it's the worst Bahmani song in history.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.840
We're going to determine the number two, second worst Bahmani song in history tonight.

11:31.840 --> 11:35.840
It was officially the lowest on that list on that old survey that went on DDRFreak.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.840
Do you remember that?

11:36.840 --> 11:37.840
Was it?

11:37.840 --> 11:39.840
I thought that it was Have You Never Been Mellow?

11:39.840 --> 11:40.840
No.

11:40.840 --> 11:41.840
No.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.840
Have You Never Been Mellow was ranked a good bit higher than Let Them Move.

11:44.840 --> 11:49.840
Love Machine wasn't even number one, so that lived.

11:49.840 --> 11:50.840
Yeah.

11:50.840 --> 11:56.160
See, Have You Never Been Mellow is cool because it was made just to spin around the whole

11:56.160 --> 11:57.600
time on the maniac steps.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.840
You can spin the entire thing and it's pretty fun.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.840
You can do that on the trick steps too.

12:00.840 --> 12:04.880
And then you go try to step off the stage and you fall on your ass. It's funny

12:04.880 --> 12:10.120
I thought that was a butterfly where you just go spin spin spin spin spin spin aye yi yi yi yi

12:10.760 --> 12:17.240
Butterfly has a few chops in it and get a little scary and it's been done. You know. I don't think anyone can top

12:17.520 --> 12:19.520
What's been classic?

12:20.200 --> 12:24.860
Do you think there will ever be a great butterfly routine from here on out?

12:24.860 --> 12:28.860
Do you think anybody has the balls to do Butterfly anymore?

12:28.860 --> 12:30.860
Let's just ask Kyle Snyder.

12:30.860 --> 12:34.860
I put out a challenge. I put out a challenge.

12:34.860 --> 12:38.860
I want to see a fucking great either Butterfly or Boom Boom Dollar.

12:38.860 --> 12:42.860
Like somebody needs to just get old school and blow us all away.

12:42.860 --> 12:46.860
There's already been some really good Boom Boom Dollar routines I guess.

12:46.860 --> 12:50.860
I saw one video, I don't remember, I believe it was off Music Gaming Zone.

12:50.860 --> 12:54.860
These two Korean guys doing Booboom Dollar and it was pretty awesome.

12:54.860 --> 12:59.100
I mean, I've seen a lot of crappy routines from Booboom Dollar, but that was probably

12:59.100 --> 13:03.620
the only one that actually stood out my mind as being good.

13:03.620 --> 13:09.880
Chat room does seem to agree here, Snyder owned Butterfly and that's it, the end.

13:09.880 --> 13:13.780
So that's two songs he owns, because isn't he the king of Trip Machine Jungle or something

13:13.780 --> 13:14.780
like that too?

13:14.780 --> 13:16.440
He is a butterfly no kamisama.

13:16.440 --> 13:21.720
And oh, Cory, ok Cory, we have Virtu in the chat room and he says at CVGL next Saturday

13:21.720 --> 13:23.360
he will do it.

13:23.360 --> 13:26.200
I will totally be there to do that.

13:26.200 --> 13:30.720
I hope it's as good as the burning heat routine Cory, that's all I have to say.

13:30.720 --> 13:34.800
I don't know if I'm going to make it to CVGL unfortunately, I might be there, but we're

13:34.800 --> 13:38.960
hoping, and this is something we want to do in the future, we're going to be taking our

13:38.960 --> 13:43.600
little kit out remote, we've got some remote tape stuff, and we're going to do some interviews

13:43.600 --> 13:46.420
out and about at some different tournaments and things, and we'll be bringing them back

13:46.420 --> 13:48.020
to the show and playing them all for you.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.620
So hopefully Jamie can get out there.

13:50.620 --> 13:53.660
Let's see who wants to give Jamie a lift.

13:53.660 --> 13:55.880
I'm taking donations now.

13:55.880 --> 13:59.740
If I go, I will definitely take you, but I do have Understation Live on Saturday night,

13:59.740 --> 14:03.660
which I committed to, so I'd have to run back early just so I can make that show.

14:03.660 --> 14:09.000
So anyhow, why don't we get into Jamie's F.U. of the Week, because a lot of what we want

14:09.000 --> 14:11.960
to talk about today revolves around Jamie's F.U. of the Week.

14:11.960 --> 14:15.920
So I am going to turn it over to Jamie and she's going to give us, like she does every

14:15.920 --> 14:19.800
week, we've had to fill in for her the past few weeks because she's been gone, but she

14:19.800 --> 14:24.520
has an F.U. of the week every week and so Jamie, tell us your F.U. of the week.

14:24.520 --> 14:29.160
My F.U. of the week has to do with Anime Expo.

14:29.160 --> 14:35.640
First of all, I was going expecting to see some new anime, something that I hadn't seen

14:35.640 --> 14:36.640
before.

14:36.640 --> 14:40.020
They played the same crap that you can buy at Suncoast.

14:40.020 --> 14:46.180
This is stuff that I've either already had for months or a couple stuff for years, and

14:46.180 --> 14:48.200
it was all just this commercial crap.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.660
And then I go in the dealer's room, okay, last year I was so excited, I was like, I'm

14:51.660 --> 14:54.480
in a jungle, buy a bench laserdisc, $5 game.

14:54.480 --> 14:59.000
They had like five laserdiscs that were $5, all the rest were $30, $40, which is still

14:59.000 --> 15:02.340
good for laserdiscs, but still, you know, I want my $5 laserdiscs.

15:02.340 --> 15:05.300
I walked out of AX last year with 20 laserdiscs.

15:05.300 --> 15:10.740
This year, not a one, although I did see this really cool little Initial D racing car thingy

15:10.740 --> 15:12.260
that's like the size of my thumb.

15:12.260 --> 15:13.820
I will say that is very cool.

15:13.820 --> 15:14.820
Oh, it's adorable.

15:14.820 --> 15:16.780
That almost makes the whole trip worth it right there.

15:16.780 --> 15:21.900
I've decided that I'm officially going to get a 1983 Toyota Corolla hatchback and paint

15:21.900 --> 15:24.700
it up like the Initial D car.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.960
They had one there and it was adorable and I just picture of you.

15:27.960 --> 15:31.700
And another thing, this is my other ramp, okay, the cosplay was great.

15:31.700 --> 15:37.200
There were lots of people in really awesome costumes, and I found a massive angel pictuary group.

15:37.200 --> 15:42.700
But I was in my Mad Hatter costume, which if anybody wants to see, it looks like I'll find you pictures later.

15:42.700 --> 15:47.200
But people kept asking me if I was doing J-Rock cosplay.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.700
I'm like, no, I'm not from Alice Meyser! No, go away, leave me alone.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.200
But I got glomps a lot, so that was cool.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.200
Do explain to all of us what a glomp is, for those that don't know.

15:56.200 --> 15:59.200
It's when people randomly run up to you and latch onto you.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.200
Right on.

16:01.200 --> 16:05.560
When you get hugged by screaming fanboys and fangirls.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.880
Don't you get glumped when you play DDR, Dave?

16:07.880 --> 16:13.160
Yes, I get glumped by beautiful women wearing bikinis.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.160
And then you wake up!

16:16.160 --> 16:19.080
Ladies love the knee drops.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.800
It breaks out as no old school A-team.

16:20.800 --> 16:25.680
Dave, for those that don't know, is the guy that likes to play Demon Road over at Roseville

16:25.680 --> 16:30.940
Golf Land, and he likes to do the knee drops on Paranoia while he's trying to do an oni.

16:30.940 --> 16:31.940
That is winter.

16:31.940 --> 16:40.060
What's even better is for the people who can do that and actually make it through the course.

16:40.060 --> 16:43.420
You think that's going to be a new trend, is freestyling the only courses?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.060
It's like, what's left to do?

16:45.060 --> 16:47.300
Yeah, I freestyle waka-laka.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.820
It's hard, but you can throw in a few stuff there.

16:50.820 --> 16:53.940
Not much, but Paranoia definitely adds more stuff.

16:53.940 --> 16:57.940
You can spin and hand plant, knee drop, all that stuff.

16:57.940 --> 16:58.940
Rad.

16:58.940 --> 17:03.940
Hey Dave, Virtu's challenging you in the chat room to a freestyle oni.

17:03.940 --> 17:04.940
Ooooh.

17:04.940 --> 17:05.940
Ooooh.

17:05.940 --> 17:06.940
Well, I think...

17:06.940 --> 17:07.940
You better back that up.

17:07.940 --> 17:10.100
You better bring it.

17:10.100 --> 17:16.740
I know that I definitely could not even do Demon Road at all without freestyling, but

17:16.740 --> 17:21.500
with freestyling I'd make it to, at most, the fifth song, if I really did well.

17:21.500 --> 17:25.780
You know, actually I'd like to issue out a challenge of my own too.

17:25.780 --> 17:28.020
Oh, well it's challenge night here on Orange Lodge.

17:28.020 --> 17:34.900
A few people already know of this challenge, but actually my edit is on SoCalCakes page

17:34.900 --> 17:37.940
right now, my DXY edit another.

17:37.940 --> 17:43.300
For whoever full combos it or gets a 90% perfect attack, I will take them out to dinner.

17:43.300 --> 17:44.300
What kind of dinner?

17:44.300 --> 17:46.140
What will be on the course for this lovely dinner?

17:46.140 --> 17:53.580
Sushi, of course, or something maybe out back.

17:53.580 --> 17:54.580
I got an idea.

17:54.580 --> 17:55.580
How about we go to Hometown Buffet?

17:55.580 --> 17:56.580
Hometown Buffet!

17:56.580 --> 18:04.420
the true Sacramento cow town way we're gonna go home we will go to JJ North

18:04.420 --> 18:09.700
there a little better you know I live right of cake we live the studio here is

18:09.700 --> 18:14.380
right up the street from a nice little oriental buffet I see Cory's comment

18:14.380 --> 18:18.260
there I will make sure that you get a copy of this one way or another also uh

18:18.260 --> 18:23.020
it is available I've figured out finally how to update our website all nicely so

18:23.020 --> 18:27.460
We did update the links page today, and the very last link there leads to one of the listeners

18:27.460 --> 18:28.460
of the show, SoCalKicks.

18:28.460 --> 18:32.580
He has a nice little page there, and it has edits on it, and Jamie's edits are downloadable

18:32.580 --> 18:33.580
there.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.380
He said it might be broken, but I know he'll fix it, especially after I just plugged his

18:36.380 --> 18:37.380
site here.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.380
He'll figure out a way to fix it now.

18:38.380 --> 18:42.820
I can also mirror those edits on sacbemani.com and on darksacra.com.

18:42.820 --> 18:47.260
I also have another challenge attached to my Look to the Sky edit for whoever full combos

18:47.260 --> 18:48.260
it.

18:48.260 --> 18:51.180
I'll give you a GameCube pin.

18:51.180 --> 18:54.460
Speaking of edits, actually, I should start posting mine on my website there.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.540
Maybe I'll post that link next week or something like that.

18:57.540 --> 19:00.300
All right, cool.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.780
Sounds cool.

19:01.780 --> 19:05.900
So going back to Anime Expo, there's a question I want to ask.

19:05.900 --> 19:08.820
And I think a lot of people want to know the answer to this.

19:08.820 --> 19:19.460
Why is it that there seems to be this correlation between anime and DDR,

19:19.460 --> 19:23.980
Besides the obvious that they're both from Japan, I mean that's the obvious, why is it

19:23.980 --> 19:29.260
that a lot of people, not everybody, but I'd say a good 90% of people who love DDR love

19:29.260 --> 19:30.260
anime?

19:30.260 --> 19:33.320
You know, I've actually found out that a lot of the people that I used to know online through

19:33.320 --> 19:40.940
my anime channels are people that are now like kind of big in the DDR world too.

19:40.940 --> 19:44.480
a few people actually in Step Squad.

19:44.480 --> 19:50.300
I knew them online before I knew them by DDR.

19:50.300 --> 19:54.080
And by the way, hi Step Squad, whoo, okay, anyway.

19:54.080 --> 19:57.260
But I also, you know, I think it was really cool that actually this is one of the coolest

19:57.260 --> 20:04.000
things about AX is that AI supplied a bunch of machines for an arcade there.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.500
They had a Max that was actually in a 1.5 cabinet.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.500
Oh, right on.

20:08.500 --> 20:15.700
They had Guitar Freak 5th, Drummania 4th, which I absolutely butchered my hands on.

20:15.700 --> 20:22.140
That had Beatmania 3rd there, the 3rd core, the Mania 3 core.

20:22.140 --> 20:25.200
Maybe I'm wrong here, because the chat room is telling me I've got Soka Gex saying he

20:25.200 --> 20:30.660
doesn't watch anime, Joe Mama says he watches maybe 3 animes, and Virtu says they are the

20:30.660 --> 20:33.760
same because it's Jappo.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.860
Like I said, besides the obvious, they're both from Japan.

20:35.860 --> 20:36.860
Any comments from you guys?

20:36.860 --> 20:40.860
What do you think about the correlation between DDR and anime? Why is it?

20:40.860 --> 20:47.860
The last time I watched anything that could be from Japan in cartoons was when I was in sixth grade and watched Pokemon.

20:47.860 --> 20:48.860
Like maybe three times.

20:48.860 --> 20:49.860
Pokemon, oh!

20:49.860 --> 20:51.860
Oh yeah, that was real quality.

20:51.860 --> 20:58.860
I went to see the very first movie and I was all by myself in the theater with one of my best friends, Amanda, who plays DDR in the Bay Area, some of you might know her.

20:58.860 --> 21:01.860
And we had so much fun, but that's all.

21:01.860 --> 21:08.540
I think that some people who like DDR like anime because lots of people who like video

21:08.540 --> 21:13.500
games are into computer nerd-type people like Matt here.

21:13.500 --> 21:18.180
I'm sure that he likes tons of stuff because he spends hours and hours on the computer.

21:18.180 --> 21:19.180
So it's pretty fun.

21:19.180 --> 21:22.300
That was just the most interesting face you just made.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.300
It is true.

21:23.300 --> 21:28.340
It's been 20 hours a day on the computer.

21:28.340 --> 21:31.940
Pretty close to that, at least.

21:31.940 --> 21:37.660
The correlation between anime and DDR, I think it's just because when people are into Japanese

21:37.660 --> 21:43.060
pop culture, they're into everything, anime, the music, the video games, it's kind of all

21:43.060 --> 21:49.140
one package deal, so that's probably why right there is because you find a lot of crossovers

21:49.140 --> 21:50.140
with that kind of thing.

21:50.140 --> 21:55.980
Is it kind of like similar to the correlation between the Renaissance Faire, Star Trek,

21:55.980 --> 22:05.200
and bondage and S&M? Well, they all have scantily clad women in them at one point or another,

22:05.200 --> 22:14.520
so then, hey, we'll play anything with boobs. Definitely. So, anything else you want to

22:14.520 --> 22:21.160
add on that, Jamie? I think it's time to bring the lusty wench into the chat room. But, no,

22:21.160 --> 22:25.800
it's basically, it's just like what Matt said, I think it's the whole fan base there. You

22:25.800 --> 22:28.200
You know, you get into one, you hear about the next.

22:28.200 --> 22:32.760
Like, my newest obsession is the whole J-Rock visual K thing, because, well, they're pretty

22:32.760 --> 22:33.760
men in makeup.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.240
Tell me about the J-Rock obsession.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.520
What is it about the J-Rock that's just...

22:37.520 --> 22:39.520
Because I notice it's like, you're...

22:39.520 --> 22:42.440
For those that don't know, the Bamani Music and More program, which is on this station

22:42.440 --> 22:47.120
when we're not live, all the music, we have every week, Jamie picks a song, and I pick

22:47.120 --> 22:50.800
a song to play that's not in any Bamani game, but we think it should be.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.560
And Jamie picked a J-Rock song, Luna C.

22:53.560 --> 22:54.920
Such a whore for Luna C.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.920
with Crazy For You for a Guitar Freak song, which would be a pretty damn good Guitar Freak

22:58.920 --> 23:00.700
song, I have to agree with you.

23:00.700 --> 23:03.440
But I noticed you're becoming obsessed with the J-Rock lately, what's up?

23:03.440 --> 23:09.160
I kind of was for a little bit, and then I got really back into it during AX.

23:09.160 --> 23:14.640
I actually bought a HIDE plushie, as in HIDE from Edge Japan, who killed himself in a very,

23:14.640 --> 23:19.080
very controversial whole thing, but that's another story.

23:19.080 --> 23:23.400
Anyway, I picked up a Luna C set over at AX.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.400
There were lots of people.

23:24.400 --> 23:29.720
There were the gacked sex kittens outside of the Hyatt Hotel, so it was all over the

23:29.720 --> 23:30.720
place at AX.

23:30.720 --> 23:35.480
Lots of people doing mana from Malus Miser cosplay.

23:35.480 --> 23:40.920
I got back and just went and found all of my old MP3s and was really into it again.

23:40.920 --> 23:45.320
Visual K owns.

23:45.320 --> 23:46.320
Corey is challenging you.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.920
He says that Glaze is better than Lunacy.

23:47.920 --> 23:48.920
What do you think?

23:48.920 --> 23:49.920
I'm a whore for Lunacy.

23:49.920 --> 23:50.920
I'm sorry.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.040
I love everything they've done.

23:53.040 --> 23:58.140
Like Rosier is my favorite song that they've done and Love Song.

23:58.140 --> 24:01.780
Also Dark Tetsuya is reminding us that in Guitar Freak's 8th Mix, which is being location

24:01.780 --> 24:04.820
tested right now, there is going to be a Gax song covered in it, so that will be pretty

24:04.820 --> 24:05.820
cool.

24:05.820 --> 24:08.960
And also, Dark Tetsuya, he's saying, what's wrong with Renaissance hair?

24:08.960 --> 24:11.500
There's nothing wrong with a Renaissance hair, just like there's nothing wrong with Star

24:11.500 --> 24:13.980
Trek and there's nothing wrong with Bondage, it's all good.

24:13.980 --> 24:14.980
Whatever you're into.

24:14.980 --> 24:19.120
They all involve leather of some kind, you know, you've got your Klingons for your leather

24:19.120 --> 24:20.220
and your blood pie.

24:20.220 --> 24:21.760
There you go, it's a leather correlation.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.760
and they are into big time S&M.

24:51.760 --> 24:56.200
genre you know I mean it encompasses so much you can do anything with animation

24:56.200 --> 25:01.760
now you know and DDR you know that they've actually started having

25:01.760 --> 25:05.880
references to DDR to be money and some different anime now I can't think of any

25:05.880 --> 25:09.080
up top my head you know even Konami is putting their

25:09.080 --> 25:12.300
bemoni into their other games like Tokimeki Memorial dancing summer

25:12.300 --> 25:19.400
vacation which I have and other things like that all right well if we're done

25:19.400 --> 25:25.480
with the anime topic oh sure many of the songs from initial D are in Para Para

25:25.480 --> 25:28.800
right on also there's an anime you might be familiar with the head of my

25:28.800 --> 25:34.440
reference King of the hill I don't know if it counts as anime it's kind of more

25:34.440 --> 25:41.160
like scribble may or something I'd say it's more like scribble may any who I'm

25:41.160 --> 25:45.720
being given I'm being fed a lot of news here I as Corey vertu is somehow in the

25:45.720 --> 25:48.800
know and he's giving me all this news here that he wants me to share with you

25:48.800 --> 25:53.680
and get your reaction, not only in the chatroom, but those of you here in the studio that might

25:53.680 --> 25:57.160
be hearing some of this news for the first time. So, I'm presenting to you a little segment

25:57.160 --> 26:09.160
we call, Cory Gives Sky the News, and he reports it over the show. Okay, so we have an 8 mix.

26:09.160 --> 26:13.720
Apparently if you use auto-base, or auto-whatever, instead of giving you a perfect, it's now

26:13.720 --> 26:18.000
going to give you an auto and it's not going to count as part of your combo.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.960
What do you guys think of that?

26:19.960 --> 26:23.960
Yeah, I heard that before but he didn't say autobase, he just said instead of perfects

26:23.960 --> 26:24.960
you get auto.

26:24.960 --> 26:25.960
I'm like, what the hell?

26:25.960 --> 26:26.960
There's no perfects.

26:26.960 --> 26:27.960
They better take the short people into account.

26:27.960 --> 26:28.960
Yeah, there should be a Jamie in the game for me to get the Jamie.

26:28.960 --> 26:29.960
Well, no.

26:29.960 --> 26:30.960
It's like if I'm at Spickels, the thing is too damn tall for me to reach the damn base

26:30.960 --> 26:31.960
pedal.

26:31.960 --> 26:32.960
If you have a chair that comes with it, then just boost up.

26:32.960 --> 26:33.960
Jamie detected.

26:33.960 --> 26:34.960
No, for everybody.

26:34.960 --> 26:39.960
It's like, if I'm at Spickels, the thing is too damn tall for me to reach the damn bass pedal.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.960
It's the type of chair that comes with it that just boosts up. Jamie detected.

26:42.960 --> 26:49.960
You know, for every version of Drummania that they put out, they need to send a free stool and a booster seat for me.

26:49.960 --> 26:53.960
Sorry, Drummania 7. Did I say 6? My bad.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.960
They need to make the bass pedal higher.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.960
You can have, like, adjustable bass pedal.

26:57.960 --> 27:03.960
So the new Guitar Freaks and Drummania, they're going to have auto instead of perfect.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.960
So that's pretty cool. It'll give you incentive to play with the auto bass.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.960
But for those of us that are hype challenged in one way or another,

27:09.960 --> 27:13.960
we're just going to have to get more magazines or a smaller chair or something.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.960
Also in the news, you're going to be able to set different difficulty levels

27:16.960 --> 27:18.960
for one player and two player for Guitar Freaks.

27:18.960 --> 27:22.960
So one person can do beginner and the other can do extreme or whatever.

27:22.960 --> 27:27.960
You can also change the difficulty of the extra stage before you enter it.

27:27.960 --> 27:29.960
Oh, that's cool.

27:29.960 --> 27:34.960
So you can do all your songs on Maniac and then be a chicken and do a basic extra stage or vice versa.

27:34.960 --> 27:39.960
You just want the Maniac extra stage, just use a bunch of crappy songs to get to it.

27:39.960 --> 27:47.960
Also, there's going to be reverse mode in it too, so you can flip it just like DDR's reverse mode and now the notes can come to the bottom.

27:47.960 --> 27:51.960
So it can be like beat, guitar, mania.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.960
That would be like, you know, rocker mode.

27:54.960 --> 27:59.960
And also, in another Bomani Game News, I'm not sure what the source is for this,

27:59.960 --> 28:01.960
must be a Jappo site or something.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.960
He says that Beatmania 3 will be the last one too.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.960
They are going to be putting out Beatmania 3, the final as well,

28:07.960 --> 28:12.960
to correlate with the final five key, regular Beatmania.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.960
That really makes sense because they hardly use the pedal anyway.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.960
Oh, Paul's throwing his handset behind me.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.960
It's one of our hoochie mommas.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.960
So you're a hoochie momma then?

28:27.960 --> 28:34.960
much to Vertu for providing all that news for us.

28:57.960 --> 29:03.780
And it's all about the stupid swim park they have there and the laser tag and Beachhead

29:03.780 --> 29:04.780
2000.

29:04.780 --> 29:07.660
Although, Dave, tell them about your new trick for people when they're playing Beachhead

29:07.660 --> 29:09.000
2000 for little kids.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.880
Oh yeah, Beachhead, I'm not, I think Paul might have done this too, but I do it now

29:13.880 --> 29:15.720
like a lot to little kids.

29:15.720 --> 29:21.320
It has a counterweight to balance out the level of the controller that goes on your

29:21.320 --> 29:26.000
head because it kind of does the VR, virtual reality type thing, where you place the controller

29:26.000 --> 29:29.540
on your head with the little two joysticks coming off the bottom.

29:29.540 --> 29:36.280
So the counterweight is behind the screen and you can kind of fit back behind all the

29:36.280 --> 29:41.860
games and if you push down the counterweight then their controller that they've got their

29:41.860 --> 29:45.520
face pushed into lifts off the ground.

29:45.520 --> 29:49.380
And so you see these little kids holding on for dear life to the game.

29:49.380 --> 29:52.540
So if you push the counterweight down you feel a kind of struggle and then it sort of

29:52.540 --> 29:55.900
lifts off the ground and then you can hear like shouting and the parents going

29:55.900 --> 29:57.780
what the fuck is this what's going on

29:57.780 --> 30:01.100
I think this is all in theory, I don't know if you gave us a shot

30:01.100 --> 30:04.780
I actually tried it several times yesterday

30:04.780 --> 30:08.860
but the only problem is since I'm behind the machine I can't see the look on

30:08.860 --> 30:10.700
their face when they poke their head out of the

30:10.700 --> 30:14.740
VR game and look around going what's going on

30:14.740 --> 30:18.740
What we'll do, maybe we'll take the remote out to Rosso Golf Land this Wednesday and we'll try

30:18.740 --> 30:20.100
that on some people

30:20.100 --> 30:23.100
orange louse bloopers and practical jokes

30:23.100 --> 30:25.100
orange louse amazing bloopers

30:25.100 --> 30:27.100
smile you're on orange louse camera

30:27.100 --> 30:29.100
hopefully we'll get those on the website for you

30:29.100 --> 30:31.100
so a ways to fuck with people in beachhead

30:31.100 --> 30:33.100
have you guys figured out a way to mess with people in sumo yet?

30:33.100 --> 30:35.100
for those that haven't seen sumo

30:35.100 --> 30:36.100
the giant pokeball

30:36.100 --> 30:38.100
it looks like you're climbing into a giant pokeball

30:38.100 --> 30:40.100
and playing these like on a big screen tv

30:40.100 --> 30:43.100
you've got these big plane games and stuff

30:43.100 --> 30:45.100
and the ball moves as you fly the plane

30:45.100 --> 30:48.100
i still thought it was funny when someone tried to climb on top of one

30:48.100 --> 30:56.220
Oh yes, imagine this big red bubble with somebody piloting it, going all Evangelion on somebody,

30:56.220 --> 30:59.860
and then there's somebody on top, and then there's people on the side, they're trying

30:59.860 --> 31:00.860
to get you.

31:00.860 --> 31:01.860
They're trying to get you!

31:01.860 --> 31:02.860
I swear they are!

31:02.860 --> 31:03.860
They want your brain!

31:03.860 --> 31:06.740
But I wasn't sniffing your spicy brain.

31:06.740 --> 31:10.040
Any other ideas on how to mess with people on other games?

31:10.040 --> 31:14.140
No ideas yet, but I'm sure that you can just take a couple of hammers and pound on the

31:14.140 --> 31:15.140
game.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.340
It's like, shake it back and forth.

31:16.340 --> 31:17.340
What's going on?

31:17.340 --> 31:20.820
losing i'm not getting hit have someone play gun blade and then have them try to

31:20.820 --> 31:22.420
write something

31:22.420 --> 31:24.540
because you are made at the right for punishment

31:24.540 --> 31:25.880
strike back for all

31:25.880 --> 31:29.400
i've worked in working here i want to know how to mess with the gauntlet

31:29.400 --> 31:32.340
legends players because those are the ones

31:32.340 --> 31:36.540
their abscesses obsessive over the game as we are with ours i mean i a m date

31:36.540 --> 31:39.060
i've seen people there all day long you know

31:39.060 --> 31:42.220
red velcro is about to die a letter put in another twenty nine hundred don't

31:42.220 --> 31:43.500
shoot food

31:43.500 --> 31:46.820
nosy they played so much they people up the chair

31:46.820 --> 31:50.660
And what I've seen, I know a couple of guys like who I just watched them play it.

31:50.860 --> 31:53.060
It's like they accidentally leave it on free play for two minutes.

31:53.060 --> 31:55.940
So they punch in ninety nine credits and they sit there all day.

31:56.140 --> 31:58.660
And then whenever someone comes along, they dictate to them what to do.

31:58.860 --> 32:02.300
It's like, OK, you go sacrificing yourself in front of the big fire breathing dragon

32:02.500 --> 32:04.620
while I sit back and watch my little attacks.

32:04.820 --> 32:09.380
No, but I think that we should go in all dressed up like the characters.

32:09.580 --> 32:13.140
It's like Red Ogre has entered the building and we should just sit there

32:13.140 --> 32:17.200
playing the game dressed up it's like move aside it's our turn to play make

32:17.200 --> 32:22.440
them play the old gauntlet the other day old one oh make them play the old-school

32:22.440 --> 32:25.620
gauntlet that old-school gauntlet rules so but they don't have an old-school

32:25.620 --> 32:28.860
gauntlet machine at RV GL unfortunately needing haven't put that in the ultra

32:28.860 --> 32:31.780
game I thought of the other game you know I noticed that when people make

32:31.780 --> 32:36.220
fun of you while you're playing DDR they instantly go and play the WrestleMania

32:36.220 --> 32:41.620
game so I want to know how to mess with those people that are put the the WWF

32:41.620 --> 32:43.620
The one that's right in the front as you walk in?

32:43.620 --> 32:44.620
Those Slim Jims, Adam, I don't know.

32:44.620 --> 32:48.620
I think playing that awful WWF game in Gauntlet Legends is just punishment for now.

32:48.620 --> 32:51.620
Until the Day of Reckoning, which they will burn!

32:51.620 --> 32:56.620
Just come up to them, it's like wearing a bandana, snap into a Slim Jim, oh yeah!

32:56.620 --> 32:57.620
Take it!

32:59.620 --> 33:01.620
I think it's time for a break, what do you guys think?

33:01.620 --> 33:03.620
Uh, I get to break more stuff?

33:03.620 --> 33:07.620
Alright, we got lots of things to celebrate in the 2DX world this week.

33:07.620 --> 33:10.620
We have 2DX 6 style coming out in just four more days.

33:10.620 --> 33:18.100

33:18.100 --> 33:24.200
some 2DX at home. Also, I'm being told that after a few weeks of downtime, 2DXstyle.net

You are my destiny

40:29.740 --> 40:35.740
There's no need to be

40:35.740 --> 40:39.740
There's no need to be

40:39.740 --> 40:43.740
You are my destiny

44:13.740 --> 44:32.420
I'm trying to lie for you, I'm trying to fight for me

44:32.420 --> 44:36.420
When you lose it's me, you're everything

44:36.420 --> 44:41.420
I'm trying to lie for you, I'm trying to fight for me

44:41.420 --> 44:52.420
You know what you want, you're different But that's not you, sure I will see you through

44:52.420 --> 45:01.420
No time for sleepin' when I can't take control Understand, oh, oh, oh

45:01.420 --> 45:06.420
You need to set you free Keepin' the pace of time

45:06.420 --> 45:09.420
I'd like to take a ride

45:10.420 --> 45:13.420
You can't halfway move it too soon

45:13.420 --> 45:15.420
There's no truth in what you give

45:15.420 --> 45:18.420
And you can't deny

45:20.420 --> 45:22.420
You're new to hope

45:22.420 --> 45:27.420
All that you wish for is to have it

45:28.420 --> 45:30.420
You're flying evil

45:30.420 --> 45:32.420
Have fun while you can

45:32.420 --> 45:34.420
And remember

46:04.420 --> 46:34.340
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

46:34.340 --> 46:38.340
Bimani Radio. That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

46:38.340 --> 46:42.340
Yes, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio. This is episode number four

46:42.340 --> 46:46.340
for this July the 14th, 2002.

46:46.340 --> 46:50.340
A long break there of all 2DX songs. We had Colors from

46:50.340 --> 46:54.340
Six Styles, A from Seventh Style, Cracker from

46:54.340 --> 46:58.340
Fifth Style for the home version, In My Eyes Fifth Style, Frozen Ray

46:58.340 --> 47:02.340
from Sixth Style, and an old school one, Shine On from 2DX

47:02.340 --> 47:07.420
second style, which the chat room commented, uh, one of Taka's best, although I don't think

47:07.420 --> 47:11.300
it was in reference to that song. That's by Shorai, actually, 2DX second style. I might

47:11.300 --> 47:16.460
be corrected on that, though. Anyway, we took a long break because we are prepping for this

47:16.460 --> 47:23.920
segment that we're gonna do, which we're gonna call Listless. That's right. We are going

47:23.920 --> 47:31.160
to determine the worst song in Bamani history, besides Let Them Move. Let Them Move is already

47:31.160 --> 47:36.160
assumed to be the worst song of Bahmani history, so that's not a factor. We're gonna determine

47:36.160 --> 47:42.120
the second worst song in Bahmani history right here. So, we've got everybody on the panel

47:42.120 --> 47:47.000
here who's written down their top three choices for worst Bahmani song ever. They've ordered

47:47.000 --> 47:50.840
it in the numbers three to one, and we're gonna name off what we think the worst Bahmani

47:50.840 --> 47:57.840
song is ever and why. And after that, we'll get to eliminate one choice from the list.

47:57.840 --> 48:01.800
I'll have a list of 15 choices because there's five of us here and then each of us will get to

48:02.320 --> 48:07.520
Take one choice off of the list and then after that with the ten songs

48:07.520 --> 48:10.780
It'll be remaining the chat room gets to vote and determine

48:10.780 --> 48:15.000
What is the worst song in Bimani history next to let them move?

48:15.000 --> 48:17.200
So if you're in the chat room right now, you'll get to participate in this

48:17.200 --> 48:22.440
It'll be your vote that determines what the worst song is in Bimani history next to let them move

48:23.720 --> 48:25.720
so let's start with

48:25.720 --> 48:31.480
What was your number three worst Bimani song in history?

48:31.480 --> 48:34.440
I really, really hate Let the Beat Hit Em.

48:34.440 --> 48:36.440
Let the Beat Hit Em, alright.

48:36.440 --> 48:42.280
Although, you know, I made history by willingly playing the song last night on Max.

48:42.280 --> 48:43.680
You actually played Let the Beat Hit Em last night?

48:43.680 --> 48:47.680
That's because I like the Max one, but I don't like the first one that they had.

48:47.680 --> 48:49.240
What was in third mix?

48:49.240 --> 48:52.160
I really, really don't like it at all.

48:52.160 --> 48:55.000
I think it might have been a solo song originally, is where it came from originally.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.640
I don't really care for that version.

48:57.640 --> 49:01.620
My number three worst Bimani song in history, I'm so going to get smacked for this.

49:01.620 --> 49:05.280
I know I'm going to get smacked for this, but for some reason I just don't like this

49:05.280 --> 49:06.920
song when I hear it.

49:06.920 --> 49:09.720
My number three choice is Graduistic Cyber.

49:09.720 --> 49:10.720
It's Gradiuzic Cyber.

49:10.720 --> 49:11.720
Whatever.

49:11.720 --> 49:12.720
Gradius.

49:12.720 --> 49:13.720
Gradius.

49:13.720 --> 49:14.720
That song is cool.

49:14.720 --> 49:15.720
I'm going to kick you.

49:15.720 --> 49:21.200
Anyway, my number three pick is Bye Bye Baby Balloon because, well they already made it

49:21.200 --> 49:25.680
like three times and then they put a new name on it and some freeze arrows and so

49:25.680 --> 49:30.520
it does not deserve to be Lonnie music well it kind of does because all the

49:30.520 --> 49:37.040
other ones are the same thing but yes ball number three I had a lot of fun

49:37.040 --> 49:42.120
playing this on drum mania before when guitar bricks was free fixed and it was

49:42.120 --> 49:44.800
just a really cool song and finally I played on a tarp it's you know I've done

49:44.800 --> 49:48.480
with them with them and I and the guitar part just breaks out in this awful like

49:48.480 --> 49:57.480
Scotts, it could be like, double trouble has the worst guitar freaks part I've ever played and it really disappointed me so I just had to put that on there.

49:57.480 --> 49:58.480
Double trouble.

49:58.480 --> 50:01.480
For guitar freaks, for guitar freaks this is.

50:01.480 --> 50:05.480
Oh god, there's like way too many songs I could list on here.

50:05.480 --> 50:10.480
Um, two, unfortunately I was kind of sticking with DDR here but um, two that really stick out of my mind.

50:10.480 --> 50:12.480
Well you gotta just give them your number three choice.

50:12.480 --> 50:17.480
Alright fine. Number three would have to go to, are you ready to do the bus stop from Disneyland?

50:17.480 --> 50:19.680
Oh, that's a good one.

50:19.680 --> 50:22.080
That song sucks.

50:22.080 --> 50:22.880
That's all it is.

50:22.880 --> 50:23.920
I agree.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.520
The oldies in Disney's Rave, what was that?

50:26.520 --> 50:28.640
Why did they put all these oldies in Disney's Rave?

50:28.640 --> 50:29.320
Mr. Bassman owns.

50:29.320 --> 50:30.520
OK, Mr. Bassman does own.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.360
I'll give you that.

50:31.360 --> 50:33.080
Mr. Bassman owns Dropout.

50:33.080 --> 50:33.880
But Bus Stop?

50:33.880 --> 50:35.360
What's the other one that annoys the hell out of me?

50:35.360 --> 50:36.680
There's another old school song.

50:36.680 --> 50:37.480
Macarena.

50:37.480 --> 50:38.400
OK, there's that.

50:38.400 --> 50:39.480
That's a given.

50:39.480 --> 50:42.600
And Johnny B. Goode.

50:42.600 --> 50:43.120
No.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.360
That was fun.

50:44.360 --> 50:46.240
It's something that you heard in grade school,

50:46.240 --> 50:47.680
You did it during the Disney reveal.

50:47.680 --> 50:49.000
It works for DDR.

50:49.000 --> 50:49.960
I don't know.

50:49.960 --> 50:52.920
All right, everybody's number three's picks are out.

50:52.920 --> 50:57.720
We have Let the Beat Hit Em, Graduistics Cyber, Bye Bye Baby

50:57.720 --> 50:59.360
Balloon, Double Trouble, and Bus Stops.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.240
Number two choices.

51:00.240 --> 51:01.360
Jamie.

51:01.360 --> 51:04.680
Number two would be Buell.

51:04.680 --> 51:06.360
I hate Buell.

51:06.360 --> 51:07.240
Buell is a good one.

51:07.240 --> 51:08.000
That's a good one.

51:08.000 --> 51:08.600
Very good.

51:08.600 --> 51:15.840
My number two choice was another 2DX song.

51:15.840 --> 51:18.860
you're correct you're correcting my spelling on what is this I'm typing

51:18.860 --> 51:22.060
these out so we can see the list of what we have so we can eliminate things later

51:22.060 --> 51:27.780
my number two choice for worst Bomani song and I might get smacked for this

51:27.780 --> 51:31.140
because it's another 2dx song but I really just don't like this song it

51:31.140 --> 51:37.560
would be a kamikaze from 2d export style I hate that song kamikaze I've never

51:37.560 --> 51:43.420
actually heard that song but my number two is I first heard it on the DDR USA

51:43.420 --> 51:46.420
My Fire, because that song is just terrible.

51:46.420 --> 51:47.420
You don't like My Fire?

51:47.420 --> 51:48.420
No, I don't.

51:48.420 --> 51:49.420
Blasphemer.

51:49.420 --> 51:50.420
That's old school.

51:50.420 --> 51:51.420
It's enough to be retro.

51:51.420 --> 51:52.420
That was my favorite song back then.

51:52.420 --> 51:55.420
No, see, Butterfly and Boom Boom Dollar are old school.

51:55.420 --> 51:56.420
This is just crap.

51:56.420 --> 51:57.420
This is on 1.5.

51:57.420 --> 52:00.420
First it was cool, then it was very uncool, and now it's retro cool.

52:00.420 --> 52:01.420
It's gone through the cycle.

52:01.420 --> 52:02.420
Retro cool.

52:02.420 --> 52:06.420
Okay, my number two is a very generic choice for a course song.

52:06.420 --> 52:10.420
It just has the diva part, it has the rap part, everything that would be characteristic

52:10.420 --> 52:12.420
in a DDR song, and it's all done badly.

52:12.420 --> 52:17.420
It's just a bad song. You gotta get that on there.

52:17.420 --> 52:22.420
Aw man, I don't know if I can top that one.

52:22.420 --> 52:35.420
Let's see, my second pick would have to go to Choto from DDR Club Mix and also second mix Link version.

52:35.420 --> 52:40.420
I don't even, that was just, it was a Laugh and Peace track and it was just awful.

52:40.420 --> 52:44.420
How in the hell do you even spell that one? I don't even think I've played that one.

52:44.420 --> 52:48.420
Let's see here, uh, C-H-O-T-T-O.

52:48.420 --> 52:55.420
And then, um, the second part of it is K-I-I-N-T-E-N-A.

52:55.420 --> 52:59.420
By Laugh and Peace. And it sucks.

52:59.420 --> 53:02.340
getting screamed at from the chat room for some of our number two choices which

53:02.340 --> 53:10.020
again were Buell, Kamikaze, My Fire, D2R, and Choto Kitene. A lot of people

53:10.020 --> 53:14.820
disagree with Kamikaze. Cory is crying because he loves D2R and doesn't

53:14.820 --> 53:20.900
understand why none of us seem to like it. All right, number one picks for worst

53:20.900 --> 53:25.300
Vemani song ever. That's my vote to strangle Polteri, I mean sorry, Queens

53:25.300 --> 53:30.300
Jamaica. Queens Jamaica, wow. I hate Queens Jamaica. I hate Queens Jamaica

53:30.300 --> 53:35.100
because way back when on the old hip-hop mania machine that we had, everybody made

53:35.100 --> 53:39.860
me freakin play that song and I hate it. And it's also on my on my 5th mixed

53:39.860 --> 53:45.500
non-stop and it always comes up right after my favorite song. So I hate it.

53:45.500 --> 53:51.500
Alright, my number one choice for Worship Imani song in history besides Let Them Move

53:51.500 --> 53:53.500
would be Jam Jam Reggae.

53:53.500 --> 54:00.500
I'm sorry, I just, it's annoying, no.

54:00.500 --> 54:01.500
No.

54:01.500 --> 54:08.500
Okay, my least favorite song is, I'm going on Corey's naming because I don't know the

54:08.500 --> 54:14.420
name, it's Under Control, which is the encore stage for long version songs for guitar, seventh

54:14.420 --> 54:20.660
mix, a Drummania VI mix, and the reason why I picked it is because it's just grunge music.

54:20.660 --> 54:27.460
It's terrible. It belongs not in Bamani, it belongs in underground crap music that's not

54:27.460 --> 54:34.460
even made in the CDs. And I avoid playing it by failing. I fail the extra stage, which

54:34.580 --> 54:38.860
is one phrase blues, which is an awesome song, just so I don't even have to hear the beginning

54:38.860 --> 54:40.500
of that song. It's so bad.

54:40.500 --> 54:49.500
Some really bad songs have a nice thing about them, like Detour was like hilarious, the best worst song ever.

54:49.500 --> 54:55.500
Jim Jim Regge has some fun steps on Maniac, but this song, I heard about it before, and it was coming in the DDR, I was like, oh that's alright.

54:55.500 --> 55:03.500
And then I played the song and the steps are so slow, which is an awful song on the DDR, the steps are tub thumping, had the worst steps on the DDR, and I was so pissed about it.

55:03.500 --> 55:05.500
God, what a bad song.

55:05.500 --> 55:07.500
Don't think you're going to get much argument there.

55:07.500 --> 55:10.500
Yeah, but it gets knocked down, but it gets up again.

55:10.500 --> 55:12.500
You're never going to keep it down.

55:12.500 --> 55:13.500
Alright.

55:13.500 --> 55:16.500
Matt, you're the final choice on the list.

55:16.500 --> 55:17.500
Alright.

55:17.500 --> 55:21.500
There was just, like I said, so many to choose from.

55:21.500 --> 55:23.500
I was going to say now Jam Jam Reggae.

55:23.500 --> 55:28.500
And I'm talking about the original one from BeatMania, because that one is damn awful.

55:28.500 --> 55:34.500
But then again, there was another one from BeatMania that was also very awful, and that would be Love So Groovy.

55:34.500 --> 55:36.500
Love So Groovy.

55:36.500 --> 55:41.580
I hate that song it's just awful. That was originally one of my picks too.

55:41.580 --> 55:45.180
Alright so the big list here here we go this is all

55:45.180 --> 55:49.020
15 choices and we're gonna now eliminate one song at a time we have

55:49.020 --> 55:53.500
Let the Beat Hit Em, Graduistics Cyber, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble,

55:53.500 --> 55:56.900
Bus Stop, Veal, Kamikaze, My Fire, D2R,

55:56.900 --> 56:01.620
Choto Katana, Queens Jamaica, Jam Jam Reggae, Under Control, Tub Thumping,

56:01.620 --> 56:05.580
and Love So Groovy. Once we get this narrowed down to 10 the chat room will

56:05.580 --> 56:11.100
get to vote on what they think is the worst song ever.

56:11.100 --> 56:12.100
And then we're going to play it.

56:12.100 --> 56:13.100
No, I'm just kidding.

56:13.100 --> 56:14.100
I think some of the songs are so bad that we'd never bother to get them.

56:14.100 --> 56:17.500
And it will be banned forever from the Orange Lounge playlist.

56:17.500 --> 56:20.620
It will never, ever be played on Orange Lounge, ever.

56:20.620 --> 56:22.420
And there was much rejoicing.

56:22.420 --> 56:23.420
Yay!

56:23.420 --> 56:24.420
All right.

56:24.420 --> 56:28.860
So, Jamie, from this list of 15, which one are you granting a pardon to?

56:28.860 --> 56:30.460
Gratiosic Cyber has to come off.

56:30.460 --> 56:31.860
I have a feeling you would.

56:31.860 --> 56:33.580
Gratiosic Cyber has to come off.

56:33.580 --> 56:34.580
That is my freaking song.

56:34.580 --> 56:35.580
Alright.

56:35.580 --> 56:38.580
I finally, finally managed to beat him, then.

56:38.580 --> 56:40.580
Alright, so it gets saved.

56:40.580 --> 56:44.580
I, yeah, he would kill me, but he's not here, ha ha ha.

56:44.580 --> 56:50.580
I am going to grant a pardon to I'm Sorry Dave, but Under Control is fucking hilarious,

56:50.580 --> 56:52.580
and it goes off the list.

56:52.580 --> 56:54.580
This song's so bad.

56:54.580 --> 57:00.580
Okay, well, then I guess I'll just have to take off Jim Jim Reggae off the list, because

57:00.580 --> 57:07.580
song rocks on doubles maniac

57:07.660 --> 57:14.160
it was from one point five and it's a cool retro cool song my fire needs to take it off the list

57:14.160 --> 57:15.940
totally agree with that one

57:15.940 --> 57:19.140
and i don't know about the steps in tump thumping i thought it was damn easy so i

57:19.140 --> 57:24.140
had a really cool edit for it so i'm gonna have to take tump thumping off the list there

57:24.140 --> 57:27.100
hey! that would have won!

57:27.100 --> 57:28.800
i don't care take it off the list

57:28.800 --> 57:36.600
everybody boo Matt please yay all right so we've taken five songs off the list

57:36.600 --> 57:41.080
and these are the ten that are left let the beat hit them bye bye baby balloon

57:41.080 --> 57:49.080
double trouble bus stop Buell kamikaze d2r Choto Katana

57:49.080 --> 57:56.040
Queens Jamaica and love so groovy it's so it's too late to add songs

57:56.040 --> 57:58.040

57:58.040 --> 58:00.960

58:00.960 --> 58:06.880

58:20.880 --> 58:22.400
next to Let Them Move.

58:22.400 --> 58:24.040
You have something to say, Jimmy?

58:24.040 --> 58:25.040
No.

58:25.040 --> 58:25.560
OK.

58:25.560 --> 58:27.560
I can't believe you picked Grady as Xyber.

58:55.560 --> 58:58.840
Max tracks. Let's do some of the Max exclusive tracks. People like these songs.

58:58.840 --> 59:01.560
We're going to take a quick break here and we'll be right back with the worst

59:01.560 --> 59:03.560
I'm waiting for your votes in the chat room right now.

59:31.560 --> 59:35.560
Mother let her know that she was in the mood for talking

59:35.560 --> 59:38.560
So when he began to play the game

59:38.560 --> 59:42.560
Before he knew it he had told her how much he'd been hurting

59:42.560 --> 59:45.560
How he was hoping she was not the same

59:45.560 --> 59:48.560
Could this be the kind of way that I'm thinking

59:48.560 --> 59:52.560
After all of this time, could this be true love?

59:52.560 --> 59:56.560
And she says, boy, you don't have to love no more

59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.560
I'll give the love you need till you holler in love, guaranteed

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:03.560
I'd like to live for I'm a kind lady

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.560
You've been hard to be so but I am the cure

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.560
And when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.560
The best day boy you know you can count on me

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.560
Believe me, this lady

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.560
You know what you found in me

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.560
Is a lady, kind of lady

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.560
That can give you what you need

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.560
Maybe a kind lady

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.560
That will never leave you lonely

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.560
And maybe this lady

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.560
Finally, you're coming up like I love you

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.560

This is the first time I've heard this song in my life.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:16.560
I've heard this song in my life.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:23.560
I've heard this song in my life.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:29.560
This is all I need to know

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.560
This is all I need to know

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.560
This is all I need to know

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.560
This is all I need to know

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.560
I'm the king that I came for

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.560
This is it, I can do

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.560
Do you believe in love?

01:03:51.560 --> 01:04:17.400

Baby give me the hum, d nerdy num, d nerdy num, d nerdy num, d nerdynum!

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:46.760
bitch get a new song an open letter from orange lounge radio that's right you are

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.800
listening to orange lounge radio it's just after eight o'clock a little bit

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.400
closer to 807 here in the middle of our fourth episode of orange lounge radio

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:57.400
life where we are right in the middle of determining the worst song in baumannii

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.960
history next to let them move let them move is already a given that it's a

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:06.520
first place so we're doing the next worst baumannii song ever and the votes

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:11.760
are in. We've asked everybody in our chat room to vote on the list which we had

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:18.120
which consisted of Let the Beat Hit Them, Bye Bye Baby Balloon, Double Trouble, Bus

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:26.880
Stop, Buell, Kamikaze, D2R, Choto Katana, Queens Jamaica, and Love So Groovy. And we

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:36.800
do have a winner in third place is let the beat hit them I don't know how that

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.200
corresponds to let the beat hit them but I thought it was a funny sound file in

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.520
second place for worst of the money song ever

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:52.640
Buell oh my goodness I can't believe it everything's ruined everything's ruined

01:05:52.640 --> 01:06:00.560
by Buell. Buell, the second worst Bamani song in history. And the worst Bamani song in history

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:09.320
next to Let Them Move is Bye Bye Baby Balloon. We're just going to flush that one down the

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:16.600
toilet and pretend it didn't exist. Bye Bye Baby Balloon was the winner. Oh yeah, I guess

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:20.760
the winner of losing first-place loser

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.440
it's like said that i i think the balloon it was so bad that they didn't

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:28.360
even put it in max to it just got taken right off a max and flushed up but you

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.640
gotta think of it this way

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.520
you'll succeed more cuz he can even lose right

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:35.600
yes to come second it being the worst song ever

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.560
good point to point

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:42.040
no unfortunately i do not have a drum roll sound but i do have this

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:46.160
for what all tells next joke on the show

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.160
Okay.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.160
That's pressure.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:54.480
I had this tower of vanilla Coke cans that I was building up that just fell over.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.480
I'm surprised you guys didn't hear the sound of that.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.480
My Leaning Tower of Vanilla Coke.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.480
Anyway.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.480
Oh, I have to...

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.480
Yes?

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:07.480
Actually, you know, for all of the songs I think that are so terrible, we do have to

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:12.840
remember that because these songs are so bad, they give value to the songs that are really

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.840
good.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.840
Good point.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.840
Good point.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:21.920
Maybe in a future edition, do you think we'd have the balls to do the best Bomani song

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:22.920
ever?

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:23.920
Oh, totally.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.920
Alright.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.920
Well, we'll do that.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.840
Do we have the balls here at this radio station?

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:39.000
We've got balls bigger than anybody because they're inflatable, like our egos.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.840
Okay, tournaments.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:45.220
There were some tournaments this weekend, there was a tournament up in Reno, unfortunately

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:48.400
none of us were able to get up there and go I don't even know what the results

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.620
were yet unfortunately but are you guys going to be going to any upcoming

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:55.020
tournaments? It seems like there's so many tournaments going on lately what you

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:59.260
think it's just because of summertime or? I think that's because people are bored

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.700
so they just want to have a tournament? Did you hear about now this is cool there's

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:08.220
going to be a tournament at SVGL they're having the and I unfortunately don't

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.760
recall the right name of it but I'm sure I'll be correct in the chat room it's

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:14.700
something like the DDR Royal Rumble basically they're gonna be having a

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:18.900
a perfect attack tournament that's kind of tied in a little bit to wrestling.

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:22.140
They're going to have a tag team thing, they're going to have a rumble, and then they're going

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:26.660
to have a typical kind of bracketed perfect attack tournament as well.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:27.660
Triple threat, thank you.

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:33.100
It's being called the DER triple threat tournament, but they're having it on Thursday and Friday,

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:36.220
so that kind of sucks for me because I can't go.

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:39.620
It's like all the weekends are booked, so now they're having to do weekdays for tournaments.

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.700
What do you guys think about tournaments on weekdays?

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:48.540
blows for because people have jobs. I can't really comment on jobs or responsibilities but I'll be

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:55.460
there. Well I can't really comment on that either but I've got so much school. Totally blows even

01:08:55.460 --> 01:09:00.980
more. I don't care perfect attack is boring don't want to go. Okay but you have to admit though you

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:04.140
have to admit Matt even though perfect attack is boring the stuff they're doing with this

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:08.540
tournament is gonna make it a little more exciting because they're gonna have the music and the big

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:11.940
costumes and everything just so I grew up.

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:17.340
That's just like watching that 80s show and then the final episode of that 80s show.

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:22.020
It's just a little bit better, but it still sucks.

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:26.300
I don't really know what this Royal Rumble they're talking about.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.860
Everyone pile on the machine and stomp on one arrow.

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:32.340
No, it doesn't work like that unfortunately, although that would be fun I think.

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:36.100
The way they're doing the Royal Rumble is basically you're going to draw a number randomly

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.800
from one through thirty.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:43.400
the first two people go up and whoever wins stays on the machine. Now to prevent the last

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:48.200
person from just coming up there, say the first guy beats 29 people and then loses the

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.000
last guy, that would really suck for him. So they have this little system they're using

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.080
called chips where if you beat so many people you get a chip and basically it moves you

01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.240
back to the end of the line and you can come back on after the 30th person. So that's kind

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.880
of how they're doing the Royal Rumble so that should be interesting. That's a very good

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880
Good idea.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.880
It is a very good idea.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:09.080
I'm still wanting to have guitar freaks, drum mania, visual kei.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:14.560
I'm very surprised there hasn't been any kind of drum mania, guitar freaks.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.800
That would be really simple to do.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.700
Rob, if we ever do have another tournament here in Sacramento, that we have to use my

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.860
idea of PA with answering trivia questions.

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:28.080
And whenever you get one wrong, you get beaten with some object, and the object's continually

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.080
getting more...

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.080
The orange bat of doom.

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.840
Yeah, well, that'll start out as the first thing, and then it'll move up to bean bag

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.600
bags, and then other stuff that hurts more, and so you lose your concentration faster.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.600
I underestimate the orange bat. I think he needs to be reminded.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.760
The orange bat should be the final boss of whatever that is.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.540
The final boss of the tournament. By the way, Matt, you made a Virtu cry that Perfect Attack

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:56.020
isn't boring, because he really practices. Well, I think back to one of my first tournament

01:10:56.020 --> 01:11:02.920
experiences, which was MGL1, and, God damn, there wasn't any... That was the most boring

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.160
thing ever, just waiting for Freesale to come around, just watching all the people get up

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.920
on the machine, complaining that the buttons aren't working, and they have to stop, and

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:17.160
they have to test the buttons, and the buttons were working. It is so boring. Oh, and Folsom,

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:23.200
when we had our SCAT tournament, it was even worse, because then you had the whole thing

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:29.120
just packed, and then there's nothing to do. But, I do have to admit, at the very end of

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.920
the perfect attack in the Folsom tournament where they had to do the versus. That was

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:39.800
cool. But like I said, the rest of it sucked. That's why this year we're not having a tourney

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:44.540
named after feces. No, instead we're going to find another crude word to name it after.

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:48.340
I notice you've got some listings here of some upcoming tournaments. Let's see what

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:51.600
some other local tournaments. Well, we're not just a local show. We'll talk about some

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.180
of the abroad tournaments. It looks like there's a pretty popular tournament. Oh, this is kind

01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:57.180
a local.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:06.640
There's going to be a tournament at Mountain Mike's in Concord on August 17th, which is

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.740
interesting because I believe it's going to be a no-bar machine.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:12.620
I don't know if they were going to take the bars off for Perfect Attack as well, but I

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.060
know for Freestyle there is going to be no bar on the machine.

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:18.500
If I recall, I do believe that the bar will be removed, but...

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.580
Perfect Attack, if it isn't removed, then if you grab the bar and you don't look like

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:24.700
you're falling down, you'll get disqualified.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.700
Who uses the bar for perfect attack anyway?

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.700
There's people who rape the bar.

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.700
That's disgusting.

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:34.700
I don't see it in tournaments, though. I don't think I've ever seen anyone grab the bar in a tournament.

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.700
I've seen it happen.

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:36.700
Really?

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:42.700
I mean, the only time I think I really see people grab the bar would be on Fast songs.

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:47.700
When Dropout was first, you know, the new song to beat, everybody, all the cool kids want to beat Dropout.

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:50.700
Some people have held the bar for that, and then of course Max and Max Unlimited.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.700
I can't say that I've ever really held on to the bar.

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:59.620
When I was learning how to beat MAX 300, I was using it for a while, but then I was like,

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:00.620
you know what?

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:01.620
No.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:05.140
I just want to do this with my feet because it doesn't seem right unless I can do it with

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.140
my feet.

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:07.700
At MAX Unlimited, I haven't allowed myself to touch the bar at all.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:11.380
I'm really bad at MAX 300 and MAX Unlimited, but I've gotten further through them without

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:16.140
using the bar than I have using it because it just totally throws off my center of balance.

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:22.620
The bar is there, I think, to catch yourself if you're falling for emergencies.

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:28.760
the original solo machines, the Japanese solo machines, they don't have a bar on them, so.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.760
We have more tournaments.

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:34.040
Yeah, can you go back to that listing of tournaments there that you had up on the screen there?

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.000
Look at some other tournaments that seem to be pretty popular.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Use the little...

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Use the rules for...

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
There you go.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
There we go.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.840
We're having a moment while we...

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:48.440
Okay, we're looking at some other popular looking tournaments that are coming up.

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:52.840
Of course, there's the big one at Castor Valley Golf Land on July 20th.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.940
The week right after that, they're having one in Rohnert Park, Scandia.

01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:01.480
The same day as the big Mountain Mikes in Concord, they're going to be having one in

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.480
SoCal.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.280
Now, this one's kind of a controversial tournament.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.560
They're having the Rays Game Center tournament, and it's kind of a bit controversial because

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:14.920
it's not DDR Drags, which has caused some controversy on some message boards.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:20.400
I was told in no uncertain terms that when I was in San Diego I was not to go to Ray's.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.400
I guess some interesting things going on there, I don't know if we want to get into it on

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:29.480
the show, but apparently they've decided, the owner of the place decided to make a change

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:33.520
with who's going to be running the tournament and not going over well with some people down

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:34.520
there.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:39.040
But they are still going to be doing a tournament on the 17th, same day as the one in Concord.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.400
So unfortunately that's going to split things up a bit.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:47.020
I know Drags 2, I went down to Drags 2 which was about a year ago and one of the best tournaments

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.020
I went to.

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.020
It was a great road trip.

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.020
It was a lot of fun.

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:51.020
I really like road tripping sometimes.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.020
I had to miss it.

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.020
I was home all by myself, crying.

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.020
Bummer.

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.020
Can we go back to the list?

01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.020
Yes, please.

01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:08.160
When is the 17th of the 8th month of the year because I don't know.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.160
I'm like captain, not look at obvious stuff.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.160
It is Saturday, to my knowledge, yeah.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.160
Okay, we have the list back up.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:22.160
We've got, they're going to be doing a tournament in Texas on July 19th and 20th.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.160
Kind of interesting there.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.160
The ones on Friday, Fridays are kind of interesting.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:31.160
They're going to have a tournament in Salinas on August 3rd.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.160
Midwest Showdown 2.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.160
And they've got some other tournaments coming.

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.400
too far off the calendars. He was like, August 17th is really the last thing that's planned.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.480
Are there results for yesterday's tournament in Reno up there? Why don't we go ahead and

01:15:45.480 --> 01:16:02.480
read those off if we've got them. They might not be up yet. Okay, we'll research that.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.840
room kind of wondering, ooh, should I go to the tournament at Ray's? Should I not? Well,

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:13.280
I guess I just didn't, just, it's kind of, do you want to, you know, be a part of the

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.440
boycott or whatever's going on or not? Or do you just want to just look past all that

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.440
and just go after it?

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.440
Your soul hangs in the balance.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.480
Go to Dollar Mandy's Summer Vacation. No bar. In Concord. You know, she'd drive farther

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:26.120
for a tournament that's maybe not be good or have no bar.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.360
And some tasty pizza.

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.120
Remember, Paul, it's an international, it's a national show. It's actually an international

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.160
show. I do have listeners in Japan. The cool thing is, on the live 365 stats, I can see

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.560
where the listeners are listening from, and I do have listeners listening in from Japan,

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:40.560
so that's pretty cool, huh?

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.560
That's pretty sweet.

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.560
They're robots.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:47.640
They are robots. All over the place. We have listeners in Canada as well, and all sorts

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.640
of places.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:53.240
So, it'd be about eight hours earlier and another time, I believe, right over there

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.240
now?

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.240
Yes, so...

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:59.240
My ex-roommate, actually, she may be one of the people listening, so Candace, if you're

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.240
listening, hi.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240
Right on.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.120
Okay, so I think we've beaten the tournament topic into the ground.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:10.560
Another topic that we wanted to talk about, Poppin' Music.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.340
There's a brand new Poppin' Music coming out, Poppin' Music 8, and is it just me or does

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.920
nobody seem to care?

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:17.920
I like Poppin' Music!

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:18.920
I do too!

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.920
I love Poppin' Music!

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.920
I suck at it!

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:21.920
I think it's so cool!

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.400
But why is it that it's kind of forgotten?

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.080
You never hear it talked about.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:37.080
Poppin' music is just like, hey, I got an idea. Let's take 2DX, lose the turntable, make all the buttons really, really big and colorful. Wow, that sounds great.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:42.080
It sounds like some kind of fruit roll-ups mistake. Like, what do we pour on the buttons? Why are they getting so big?

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:47.080
But I think it's because pop music isn't a lot of arcades. It's more of like a novelty thing that people don't really play that much.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:54.080
Poppin' music is pretty challenging, though. I thought I could get right up and play it, and I totally failed like Cutie Honey on Auto-Malo 2.

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.380
Do you think it's just because the machines are so scattered amongst the U.S., you don't

01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:59.800
really see them in the...

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.280
There's no pop and music machines, to my knowledge, anyway, in the Bay Area, which is where the

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:08.620
majority of your board posters come from, because it was the first area that had Bomani.

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:12.840
SoCal has a couple machines, Arcade Infinity, I've been there, I play them...

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:13.840
It's a fun game.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.600
I like the ones when you have to hit four at once, you kind of have to use your forearms

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:18.280
to hit the buttons, it's pretty crazy.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.840
Yeah, karate chop!

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:25.680
And also, I think they have a machine in Seattle, but they're kind of spotty, the location of

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:26.680
the machine.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.920
Do you think that's the only reason people look at it?

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.560
Sort of out of sight, out of mind.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:34.080
At AI, why play pop-in music when you can play Mambo-a-Go-Go?

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.960
I mean, that's all I have to say.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.280
Because Mambo-a-Go-Go has like ten songs, and once you've played them all...

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:44.000
Personally, I find Mambo-a-Go-Go to be kind of easy, personally.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Even on the hard mode.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
You can play it with all nine of the things and get like, you can beat the hardest song on that?

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I don't know if I played the hardest song, but I played hard mode and it wasn't, you know, 2DX is harder for me, but I guess that's a given.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Do we have the pop music gate?

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
So what's the information on the, what do you want to tell us about pop and music gate, Matt?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Okay, well, this information comes from BimaniStyle.com. We've got, looks like a couple features here.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:24.000
First off, there's going to be a mode called Beat Pop, which is basically you have, instead of the nice little, I guess, stuff they normally have falling down the screen, you have lines just like Beat Mania, that type of thing, kind of makes it look more like that.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:39.000
They have a sort of a dark mode called Soft Discretion Line, and it just turns the indicator a little bit darker, so it's kind of like dark mode, and then they have one that's really cool that's called Disjointed Speed Mode.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.640
And, what that is, is where, for instance, if it were to be applied to DDR, you'd have

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:50.220
like the left arrow going at four speed, you'd have the up arrow going at two speed, maybe

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:56.040
the right arrow at one speed, and then maybe, I don't know, the down arrow or something

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.040
at another speed.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:00.400
So, basically, if all the arrows going at different speeds, or in this case...

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:03.240
It's going at speeds, sounds like some weird band name.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.280
It would be really hard to play.

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:11.280
That's kind of pretty much all the new features that are going to be coming out for that.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:17.280
As far as the song list goes, there's a couple songs coming over from different Bomani.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.280
You've got Candy, the vocal version from Max 2.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:27.280
You have Boa Boa Lady from BeatMania.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.640
you've got a much better jam jam right now let's see here

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:34.640
Linus I think that was 2d x 6 style

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:38.240
let's see here we've got

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.520
I'll see jet world

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:46.520
that's gonna be coming over to it and then just a whole bunch attracts

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:51.040
much new stuff any a familiar artists on there with new stuff talk attack

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:54.320
LED any those artists making a appearance on the new pop music

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:57.320
Actually, to be honest, it doesn't have the artist's names in here.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.320
Oh, bummer.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:03.320
The only one that I do recognize from Beatmania would be...

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.320
Oh, shoot.

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:09.320
I can't remember the name.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.320
Did, um...

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.320
Okay, driving this into the ground here.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.320
Oh, that's all right. When you think of it, you can let us know.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:18.320
We're actually having a request, though, from the chat room.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.320
They want an update, Matt.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:25.360
seem to be our simulator expert here. What's going on in the Sim world? Because we haven't

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.760
talked about it yet this show, so they want to hear what's going on.

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:34.560
Alright, well, Sim stuff going on. Right now, pretty much two things that we've been waiting

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:39.160
for have been the new versions of StepMania and Dance with Intensity. Dance with Intensity,

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:45.480
we're still waiting for them to actually release a beta of version two. StepMania has been

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:49.880
coming out with new betas. They have beta four now, which is alright. I've been trying

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:54.880
I'm still sticking with Dance with Intensity because it loads up really fast.

01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:02.880
That's why I seem to like it. I'd rather have the faster loading over all the bonus features that they've got there.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:09.880
For StepMania, I don't know if it was just Beta 3 or just the computer that I played it on,

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.880
but two-thirds of the time or more when you ever hit an up and down jump arrow

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:18.700
Whenever you held one of the up and down jump arrows and tried to hit, well held the up

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:22.820
and down arrow, or either one of them tried to hit the other one, it wouldn't register

01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:27.620
or it would register just as like a boo or a good or something.

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:33.500
So I don't know if that's just on all beta 3 or just on the computer that I use.

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:34.980
I'm not really sure about that one.

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:40.260
But the other thing that's going to be going on is the contest that they had for, the DWI

01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:47.260
as they had put out by DDR East Coast Invasion is they're actually doing voting right now

01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:52.940
and it should have been wrapped up today according to their boards but I still haven't seen anything

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:57.980
on that yet and the melting pot boards are still messed up.

01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:01.860
Now I am getting a rumor here that DWI2, one of the new features, is going to be a groove

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:02.860
meter.

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:03.860
So that will be pretty cool.

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:04.940
I wouldn't doubt it.

01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:10.420
He's been looking for a good code for, you know, some good source codes to actually generate

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.540
those much like, you know, StepMania has.

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:14.820
Really big deal.

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:17.260
I mean, I saw that with StepMania too.

01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:21.220
I was just like, okay, so I don't look at that anyways.

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:22.220
Okay.

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:24.100
Thank you very much.

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.100
All right.

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:28.820
We're going to take another quick break and when we come back, we'll interact with the

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:31.740
chat room a little more, talk about whatever they want us to talk about.

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:36.160
have some other topics here that we can get into if we want. And God, who knows what else

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.620
we're going to talk about here on Orange Lounge. Maybe we'll just say, screw Bomani, and we'll

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:43.700
just talk about other stuff. I don't know. Anyway, you're listening to Orange Lounge.

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:48.060
How are you doing over there, Jamie? I'm on the floor. You're on the floor? Do you want

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:53.720
to kick Matt out of the chair? Can I just kick him? Okay. Cool. Or I can get you another

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:56.200
chair if you want. Don't worry about it.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:03.200
Alright, we'll be back in a little bit.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.200
Hi, everybody!

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.200
Hello, hello.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.200

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.200
Mic, mic test.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.200
We must hear your comments, brother.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.200
D.G.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.200
Number one, D.U.

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.200
D.U.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.200
D.U.

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.200
D.U.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.200
Hey, everybody.

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.200
Haro, haro.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.200
Mic test.

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.200
Mic, mic test.

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:47.200
I am DJ Shinda.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.200
I am a senior kylin abroad.

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.200
I am number one DJ.

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.200
I am number one.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:54.200
Let's go.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:58.200
I am DJ Shinda.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.200
I am DJ Kojima.

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:03.200
I am DJ Tani.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.200
Tani.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.200
Oh

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:11.200
Thank you!

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:39.200
How I'm twisted and deceitful, all love to face people

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.200
Taking me for some kind of fool

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.200
How I'm pretending to be so nice

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:48.200
Let me give you my advice, I don't need you

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:52.200
Screaming in the sky, dressed up in lights

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.200
It's the neck that you're playing

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.200
How I'm fresh, you recognize me

01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:01.200
And you criticize me, what's going on?

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:04.200
Don't stop your bitching cause you're so fair

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:07.200
Bitchin' behind my back, honey I don't need that

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.200
Don't kick it to the curb because I heard you through

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.200
They tryin' to get in my face

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.200
I'm watchin' hard to make mistakes

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.200
Don't make me stay, don't stop your vision on me

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.200
Oh, oh, that's so narrow-minded

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.200
But they're so unsighted, they're just counterfeit

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:42.200
Oh, oh, hot and cold, you're the wind

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:45.800
Some more clothes man, who are you tryna get?

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:52.440
And, to see people, I'm so shallow, put yourself in my place

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:59.240
The fairy tells you spin and sound and circle, bend, stand, but I'm at a rock

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.720
So stop your bitch and catch yourself there

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:05.560
Stare a bitch from behind my back, who me, I don't need that

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:09.000
So kick it to the curb because I heard you through the stage

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.700
Kinda scared in my head, so why too hard to make mistakes?

01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:14.700
So stop your bitchin' on me

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Stop your bitchin' on me

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:30.000
Stop your bitchin' on me

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:59.920
Who's that Pokemon?

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:01.920
It's CANDO!

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:08.920
Oh, baby.

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:35.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:41.920
Think about it

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.920
Move on now

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.920
Let your body feel the beat

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:51.920
Come on, wake up

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:55.920
Let our energy change and beat

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.920
And in the back of your mind I smile

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:03.920
Burning blood so bright

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:05.920
Just reach out, he's off and out

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.920
He'll be the star tonight

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:10.920
Get with it

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.920
Finalize

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.920
You gotta chance it

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.920
You know you should do it

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.920
When you're dead, my man

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:19.920
Pass him by

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.920
And set him strong, but

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:27.920
You're not the answer to keep me warm

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:37.920
Hey, hey, hey

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:40.920
I just believe

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.920
You're gonna feel it, yeah, yeah

01:31:44.920 --> 01:32:07.640
We have reported incidents where exposed listening to this program in the kitchen has caused

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:13.800
people to bust out a Sharpie pen, draw arrows on the tiles, and start stomping away.

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.800
a friendly public service announcement from Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:20.800
That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.800
We're here until 9 o'clock tonight.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.800
And I'm going to turn it over to Paul.

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:28.800
Paul likes to do a little segment every week here, when he's here,

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.800
where he's going to wrap up what's going on on the local message boards,

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:33.800
local and abroad.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.800
Whatever message board he wants to talk about, he's giving us the wrap-up.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:36.800
So go for it, Paul.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.800
I have to give you some music, though.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:50.800
Well, um, on the second money board we were a little active in, oh great, in growing up, but you're obese.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:58.800
On the second money we've been going over and talking about, after our crazy smoking break, we were just saying, you know, how much stuff happened to the smoke out of it in the game.

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:03.800
Now since it's been us helping out, and we've decided that we're going to do a letter together.

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:08.800
Jessica, the iguana girl, has gotten to do a draft together, and we're going to go over it,

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:12.800
and form a letter together, and I'll send it in, and talk about that on tour.

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:17.800
And so the discussion is just going on.

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:21.800
You know, some people still can't post in the right introductory thread and everything else.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.800
That's just a little concerned.

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.800
You've got to get that mic a little closer to your mouth, Paul.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.800
you're going to shove it all in your mouth and take it all at once.

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.800
Take it all.

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:30.800
I'm just going to blow that whistle.

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.800
I'm just glad that we've been actually getting something together after complaining for so long.

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:34.800
I thought we'd just note that.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:39.800
Anyone who's interested should talk to people about that.

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:41.800
Any other boards you want to give us a lowdown on?

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.800
You know, not much has been happening too much.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.800
A lot of boards have slowed down just because people have been divided,

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.800
and I haven't been on DDR free for a long time.

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:50.800
Same old, same old on DDR free.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.800
Alright, so that's a wrap up.

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:52.800
Same old shit.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.800
Hooray.

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.800
Thank you, Paul.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.900
machines with the help of local law enforcement.

01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:32.560
I'm sure I know what site they'll be looking at to find out where these machines are located.

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:33.560
Thoughts?

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.560
People?

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:38.600
Well, first of all, I'd like to actually read that press release, is there a link on there?

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:39.600
There is not!

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.600
What do you know?

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.600
Hmmm, makes one think.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:49.600
You know, if someone's going to put up a rumor of that magnitude, the only way I would believe

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:54.720
it is either one, seeing the press release or two, having it posted by KOA on the board.

01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:01.720
So, until I have legitimate proof, I call that a big pile of sticky poo.

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:04.720
Let's see what people are saying about that.

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:07.720
BS, BS, BS, BS, BS, BS.

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:09.720
Pretty much everybody says that's BS.

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:12.720
That they're going to be wasting their time and stuff.

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:16.720
They're claiming that Konami of America is going to make an announcement tomorrow.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:18.720
So, I guess we'll see.

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:20.720
We'll see if there's any truth to that rumor.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:21.720
We'll see if miracles will ever start.

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:22.720
That's right.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.720
That's right.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:28.840
Have you seen how many people in green shirts are going around Golf Land now with the racetrack

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:29.840
and stuff?

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:30.840
They have an evil army.

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:33.120
There's no way anything's getting out of there.

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.520
Would you tie yourself to the DDR machine if it was going to be taken away?

01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.680
Tying, you know?

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.400
I think I'd just stick with the guitar freaks then.

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:45.240
If people would be distracted, no one would be playing, I could get a few games in, it'd

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:46.240
be alright.

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.520
I'd like to see how they're going to actually pull this off.

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:56.360
How many machines do we have in California alone, let alone the whole United States?

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:59.160
What the hell are they going to do with those, turn them into the USA mixes?

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.800
And they can't read the machine locations page on DDR Freak with their tiny Asian eyes,

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:05.520
so I don't know how this is going to work out.

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.520
That's wrong.

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:07.520
That's wrong.

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:15.080
But no, if they're going to do that for Guitar Freaks in Dramania, why not do it for DDR2?

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:20.000
Why not go get all those pop music machines, all five of them that we have in the country,

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.560
or you know, go hunt down dance maniacs, or the like, or you know, go get the Korean machines.

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.880
Why not, you know, hit them too?

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:28.880
Quick!

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:29.880
They're coming!

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:30.880
Get the Macs too and run!

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:35.080
You had something you wanted to add, Matt?

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:36.080
No?

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:37.080
Okay, never mind.

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:41.040
Pretty much we're being told in the chat room, they pretty much agree that it seems to sound

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.080
like a bunch of BS to you guys.

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:44.080
It's poopy!

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:50.080
Oh, Dark Tetsuya's offering, though. If anybody wants to come play the Max 3 beta at his house before the cops take it away, hahaha.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:52.080
Dude, I'm there.

01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.080
This is for you, Dark Tetsuya.

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:56.080
Alright.

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:59.080
That sound will never get old for me, I'm sorry.

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:07.080
I'm trying to read the chat room here.

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:14.120
Yes, we are being given this flood of information in text format on our lovely...

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:18.600
So we don't know what's happening with all that Konami of America stuff, but I'm sure

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:24.320
that if things get too out of hand, Jason Enos will make a post and tell us all what's

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.320
going on.

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.800
And in fact, I would really like to get an interview with him, and that's something I'm

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.720
aiming for with a future show.

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:35.440
Speaking of future shows, in two weeks on this show, on the 28th, there's about a 50-50

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:38.940
chance we're going to have a very special guest, two very special guests here that night.

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:42.080
I can't say who because it's not confirmed yet, but you'll definitely want to tune in

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:46.480
to that show in two weeks. We'll hopefully have somebody who knows Jamie and I very,

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:53.140
very well, who's sure to bring up a lot of dirt on us, and a very famous freestyler also

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:54.140
should be here.

01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:58.100
Rob, you sound like you're actually promoting our show. What's up with that?

01:37:58.100 --> 01:37:59.280
I know, what's up with that?

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.100
It's because our show rules.

01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:02.100
We own.

01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:07.100
That'll be a good show, if we get it. As soon as I get it confirmed, we'll bring it up.

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:09.100
I'll let you know who's coming.

01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:12.100
One little point, if you don't mind me going back to the Guitar Freak show or anything.

01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:13.100
Sure.

01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:17.100
If anybody happens to see anything about that, go ahead and feel free to email me.

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:23.100
My email address is darksakra.aol.com, so go ahead and send me information if you find anything.

01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.100
Alrighty.

01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:28.100
Everybody knows my email address anyway, I don't know.

01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:30.100
Your email address is accessible on the website.

01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:35.260
All the porn people just love to send me stuff.

01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:37.320
Okay, um...

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:41.180
Let's see, what other topics do I have written down here for things we can do?

01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:42.300
Hearing? Oh!

01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.200
We have a hold.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.940
Wait one second.

01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:47.980
Alright.

01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:50.940
Let me pass the mic over.

01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:56.060
Alright, I'm just reading this off of Konami of America's site, totally unrelated to what we were just talking about here.

01:38:56.060 --> 01:39:02.100
uh... is talking about that this guy john benson and word evans are uh...

01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:06.180
the air fanatics their creators of dance machine a short film about the world's

01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.600
biggest cdr fan

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:12.460
the movie one can that coveted clam d or two thousand two clinton's film fest

01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:14.260
but when i'm down

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:16.220
in newport rhode island

01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:17.260
so uh...

01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:21.020
hopefully we'll never see that on video you-know-what if we have a ddr movie

01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:23.700
i have a real good idea for this

01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:27.700
People have been making DDR players, celebrities, and stuff.

01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.700
I know Corey's in the chat room and he's been getting some of that.

01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:31.700
You know Corey's screen name?

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:32.700
I want to talk to Corey.

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:33.700
People like that.

01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:37.700
And so I think that as anyone like Mike, people have heard about this movie.

01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:41.700
A little kid finds his shoes, becomes like Michael Jordan, starts dunking on everybody,

01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:42.700
gets in the NBA.

01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:46.700
I want someone to find maybe Corey's old underpants.

01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:47.700
They'll say Corey on the name tag.

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:48.700
He'll put them on.

01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:52.700
Please make me like Corey and he'll come to the PA competition, maybe the triple threat.

01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:56.500
You know, he started owning everyone, this little scrub that everyone sees playing USA,

01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.300
and just kills everyone, and it's a whole new phenomenon.

01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:03.100
And then he finds out, you know, the underwear wasn't what it is, it was the magic inside.

01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:03.900
I think that would make a good...

01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:04.500
Do you remember that old...

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.300
Put down the pipe, Jesus.

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:09.400
Do you remember that old business, though, about DDR Freak the movie?

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:09.700
Yes.

01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:14.800
With all the scripts that floated around that made it into this, this utter, you know, crappy teeny movie?

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.100
Uh-huh.

01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:18.600
That would have just been, that would have been boycotting that.

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:22.400
I will say this on the show right now, something I haven't told anybody.

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:28.400
I'm writing a screenplay that involves DDR heavily, that's all I'll say.

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:31.400
Oh, we have another guest who just walked into the room.

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:32.400
We have Bongo!

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.400
Bongo demands us.

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.400
Introduce yourself, new guest.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.400
What is Bongo, or is my other...

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.400
That's your other, that's your real self.

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.400
Hi, Ryan.

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:44.400
Yay, SDM.

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:47.400
I have a bit of a problem with that.

01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:51.400
The big gay perilous.

01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:58.400
Oh, great. Now I'm forever known as the absolutely gay cross-dresser.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:03.400
Hey, Matt, bring up the official site for that movie thing. Are you trying to do that?

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:05.400
They have a click here.

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:13.400
One person in the chat room says they did see it and they didn't like it, so your first review is a big thumbs down.

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:19.400
The DDR movie about the biggest DDR fan that won the clam dance award.

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:27.800
there's a movie it's what John and ward.com will bring it up I'm even more

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:33.760
alarmed that as opposed to there being a movie there's a clam dance I know that

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:37.160
I think that's the big news here not that there's a movie out but there's a

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:43.680
big you know like lesbian gathering you know you know what that bring you know

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:49.240
it brings to mind a clam dance festival that's what brings to mind was that the

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:49.240
sound of a dying mutant clam? A clam opening up.

01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:59.240
Would you have the signal? Beat like a dying camel.

01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:04.240
We're going to take a real fast break and we're going to come back and wrap up the show because we don't have much time left.

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.880
So stay with us, we're going to take a real quick break, we'll be right back.

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:51.840
We like to be after the behavior What you doin' over there?

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.840
Come on, let's do this really well

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.640
People are feelin' afraid of scooby mergers

01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:56.640
Don't know what to do

01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:57.940
Hey, what you got in your hand?

01:42:57.940 --> 01:42:58.740
Man, it's amazing

01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:00.040
Put it away, it's gonna go bang

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.240
Blow my brain, ha

01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:02.740
I'm gonna call someone insane

01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:04.340
With an ass, a seed, axe

01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:06.340
So, let's leave this nigga today

01:43:06.340 --> 01:43:07.640
Just for the sake of your love

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:09.240
Make sure to laugh and express your gaze

01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.940
Just our vote, you gon' say, say

01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:12.940
Cut the drugs, cut the drugs

01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:25.880
I feel you, I feel you, I feel you everywhere I feel you, I feel you, I say to you every night

01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:02.880
I'm leaving, I'm leaving

01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:07.880
I can't help it, I'm a little too old for life

01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:13.880
I'm taking my time, I'm taking my time

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:19.880
You can't come alive, you can't come through the light

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:36.880
You gotta keep it bad, keep it living

01:46:36.880 --> 01:47:05.680
and now it's time for

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:10.600
Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:13.280
perverse baumanni band, Erotic.

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:15.680
Do it all night. Do it with me.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:20.980
No, no! That was awful! Bloody terrible! Do you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher!

01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:22.480
In the heat of the night.

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:25.180
Oh, God! I think my ears are bleeding!

01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:26.980
I liked it!

01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:29.680
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula! Next!

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:33.880
Umm... that was cool.

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:38.880
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic! Next!

01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:46.880
Yes! Yes, that's it! We have a winner!

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:50.880
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:53.880
Yes, a star is born every second.

01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:58.880
A star being born over there on the other computer in the house.

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:02.120
in the house. We were watching that short movie that we were referencing earlier. What

01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:07.700
is the name of that, Matt? It's called Dance Machine, and I just posted the link up there

01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:10.920
in the chat room. Those of you that aren't in the chat room, go ahead and join us. It's

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:17.800
not too late. Over on, just join the server, IRC.eggheads.org, and we're in Channel Orange

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:18.800
Lounge.

01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:22.820
Dance Machine has also proved that while every moment a star is born, every moment a star

01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:26.340
explodes too.

01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:31.340
Never have I felt more sorry for mid-aged men who think that they're young.

01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:34.340
I've never seen a guy that old playing DDR. That's amazing.

01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:37.340
And there's Kobe. There's always Kobe.

01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:39.340
And Nick Nolte owns a DDR machine.

01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:40.340
That's true. That's true.

01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:43.340
Nick Nolte owns one and he takes lots of vitamins too.

01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:47.340
Yeah, but Nick Nolte didn't win, you know, Best Comedy and Alice's Clam Dance Award.

01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:51.340
He didn't win the Clam Dance Award in San Francisco, okay?

01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:54.340
But the Clam Dance Award is a lesbian award.

01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:57.220
So is he like, you know, is it kind of like Flashdance?

01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:01.700
What a feeling, wack, wack.

01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:04.260
It's always better with fans.

01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:06.460
And that's the quote of Ryan for the evening.

01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:08.780
Also, during that break, I took a chance

01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:11.460
to look at the newly remodeled 2DX style,

01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:12.900
and I give it my seal of approval.

01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:13.500
It's very pretty.

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:14.900
They have a little pretty opening movie

01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:17.660
when you go into the site, and it's it's all nicely remodeled.

01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:19.060
So do pay that a visit.

01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:20.660
And that's linked from our links page.

01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:21.900
If you want to check that out.

01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:24.300
2DX style gets the kudos of the evening.

01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:27.180
We'll go buy you a candy bar, Cory.

01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:29.540
And also Three Feet Elite, who is the puppeteer.

01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:34.620
I will go buy a box of kudos and deliver them to you.

01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:35.620
They can split it.

01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:36.620
They're tasty.

01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:39.500
They have some nice forums over there, also.

01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:40.500
Do you think the DDR community...

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:41.740
This is a question I've been wanting to ask for a while.

01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:44.060
Do you think the DDR community is too saturated with forums?

01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:46.180
Do you think there's too many?

01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:47.180
Never been too many.

01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:51.060
I mean, each one of them has their own feel, and it's like you get that weird little trippy

01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:58.060
maybe sends a family there. Except, say, DDR Freak is the big extended family that's supposed

01:49:58.660 --> 01:49:59.900
to cover everything.

01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:02.220
With lots of interesting children.

01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:07.480
Yeah, you know, you have that family, maybe a little more to the south. And the uncles

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:11.480
you don't talk to much. You know, the uncles you don't talk to, they're kind of crazy.

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:14.080
They don't speak good English.

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:18.500
And Sacramani's just like, yay, we're happy, don't flame on people, whee!

01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.500
That's because we love everybody!

01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:57.260
As far as for one purpose, it's hard to get used to that, even Ryan.

01:50:57.260 --> 01:51:00.700
The alternate board used to be GDCon and people would talk about that and go on there eventually.

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:04.700
That sort of got split between that and MonkeysFly and other network because things would happen

01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:08.460
and now neither of those boards get much activity so it's better to have, I think, stuff centered

01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:09.460
in one place.

01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:14.780
Not too much because DDR Freak does have a little, it's sort of overflowing with activity.

01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:15.780
It's hard to handle.

01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:19.100
the big, big city, but then it's also good to have a couple of little suburbs too that

01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:20.100
are fun.

01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:23.620
My observation with the GD Coon forums is that a lot of people who were, you know, sort

01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:28.200
of booted from DDR Freak ended up there too, but you know, it was, it was still another

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.200
place that got it.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:35.280
The big thing I like about, about having such a wide selection of forums is that, you know,

01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:40.740
you can see how their community works, you know, each one of them has their own feel,

01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:44.380
you know, you have the one that's a little bit more irreverent, you have your other that's

01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:45.380
It's more sort of all-encompassing.

01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:46.380
DDR Freak, I think, is more all-encompassing.

01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:50.700
I really, really like that.

01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:55.740
We have our little happy inbred family at Saqdumani.

01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:57.220
Okay.

01:51:57.220 --> 01:51:59.140
No.

01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:03.140
We have, I think, we're really getting that good sense of community.

01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:07.900
I'm really, at least, hoping that a lot of the good feelings from back in the old days

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:09.380
come back.

01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:11.220
And we talk about porn there, too.

01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:12.540
Yes, we talk about porn.

01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:14.220
We have our own hentai thread, thank you.

01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:18.300
and we're all going to YALIcon.

01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:21.200
I'm not going to YALIcon. I don't know what you people are smoking with all the games.

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:25.420
You're coming to YALIcon. We're making you dress up. We're making you cosplay.

01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:28.700
Alright, alright. You get to wear the frilly black lace.

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:32.860
So we like we like lots of different forums. It's cool to have a lot of

01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:34.620
different forums. Kind of everybody has their own

01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:37.980
different personality and you just choose to hang out with the people you want to.

01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:41.540
One other topic I wanted to bring up

01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:46.660
Hearing DDR songs in interesting places, I don't necessarily mean on the radio, but do

01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:50.860
you guys ever hear like DDR songs in very strange places, places you didn't expect to

01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:51.860
hear them at?

01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:56.080
Like, for once, I picked up this CD this week that just happened to have Ordinary World

01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:57.080
on it.

01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.080
It was very odd.

01:52:58.080 --> 01:52:59.860
It was like this trance compilation CD, and then all of a sudden there was Ordinary World.

01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:00.860
It's like, wow.

01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:01.860
DDR in my nightmares.

01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:05.340
This DJ at one of my school dances was playing all this bad techno music, and all of a sudden

01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:08.500
Stomp to My Beat comes up, and that's very distinctive.

01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.740
We went over this before, but Stomp to My...

01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:13.180
Why is everyone shoving two microphones in my face?

01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:16.420
Like I get one and Jamie's like, here, here, take it, take it.

01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:17.420
Get the dual voice effect.

01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:20.180
We were all at Brookfield and then I stomped my beat from the kitchen.

01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:21.180
Yeah.

01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:24.840
And um, but we went over this a while ago and yeah, stomped my beat.

01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:30.060
I've heard it a while, but I think that I've listened to DDR music so much that whenever

01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:35.740
I think I hear something, I have to take like a second listen to it because I'm not sure

01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:40.660
if it's just my mind playing kicks on me because now I've listened to so much and some of the

01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:45.000
stuff sounds so similar, I'm listening to Dropout and it sounds like, yeah, I'm dead

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.800
around or something like that. It just doesn't compute. I've listened to so much.

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:53.380
I think it's getting more annoying on the idea that, you know, you listen to the radio

01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:57.500
and some of this DDR stuff comes on, or you have a CD where you're listening to DDR stuff

01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:01.060
comes on. You don't know which is getting pulled from which, because I know Stomp to

01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:05.940
My Beat was a pretty popular techno song before it got pulled into DDR, so I'm wondering if

01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:08.740
more isn't coming along those lines.

01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:13.220
It's also sad that with some of us being the ages that we are, that we actually remember

01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:14.820
the original songs they were.

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:23.220
I remember the original, Sky High, that was redone by DJ Mikko.

01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:26.900
Even being an anime fan, I will sit and listen to freckles and the Japanese lyrics, like

01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:31.660
the opening Toru Roni Kenshin goes in my head, and the original Hot Limit by TM Revolution,

01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:35.620
which by the way, everybody should listen to because it's awesome.

01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:37.940
I had the weirdest thing happen.

01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:43.980
I was watching MTV for like the once in like the last two years and I heard oops I did

01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:44.980
it again.

01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:49.980
It's so weird that they ripped off like DDR fifth next to me because I have no idea why.

01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:53.900
I mean, it's just like, whoa.

01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:56.620
Yeah, oops he did it again.

01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:58.940
Hey, that song is cool.

01:54:58.940 --> 01:54:59.940
You know.

01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:00.940
Anyway.

01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:06.620
It's, it's just, you know, I think that not only are our lives, I guess influenced by

01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:13.340
Bamani, but Bamani is influenced by the way that the world has been too. The music has

01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:18.940
evolved and it's evolved with people's taste, it evolves with the times and that's another

01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:23.660
really cool thing is that you're more likely now to hear something that's been in a Bamani

01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:24.660
game.

01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:28.580
Do you think it's just like when we hear Bamani songs on CDs, places we didn't expect it to?

01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:33.240
Do you think it's like we kind of feel like, hey, this is our game and this is our pastime

01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:36.460
and it's kind of like wow it's kind of funny it's like the rest of the world's

01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:40.020
kind of in on the secret too is it? Well I think actually it's more like you know

01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:44.220
like remember watching He-Man and She-Ra back when you were little it was a tool

01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:49.460
to sell the toys. They made me pay money as a tool to sell Dance Mania CDs who

01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:59.100
knows. Like the Mattel Chocobot Hour. Yeah. Any other comments? All right I think

01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:02.180
we're gonna wrap up the show here um thanks to everybody for listening we

01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:05.060
I've got a really good turnout tonight, thank you everybody in the chatroom, I hope you

01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:09.460
join us every Sunday night from 7pm until 9pm.

01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:13.260
Also we're going to start doing rebroadcasts on Monday night, so we're going to do rebroadcasts

01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:17.860
Monday night at 7 o'clock, you can hear all of tonight's show, and then at 9 o'clock we

01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:19.760
bring you a classic show.

01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:24.220
So we're going to go ahead and replay the first episode this week for those that missed

01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:25.220
it.

01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:29.660
I'd like to thank all of my friends who said that they'd be listening in tonight, and for

01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:33.620
for our two listeners in Japan, and for...

01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:35.420
We have listeners in Japan?

01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:37.060
Yes, we have listeners in Japan.

01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:39.900
I would like to thank our listeners on the East Coast,

01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:43.220
West Coast, South Coast, Gulf Coast,

01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:44.780
whatever coast there happens to be,

01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:46.260
the coast in your own mind.

01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:47.820
And again, do join in.

01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:52.340
Visit our website at orangelounge.skie.cx

01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:54.540
and get all the information on our station.

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:56.660
And when this live talk program isn't on the air,

01:56:56.660 --> 01:56:59.300
do tune into our Bomani Music & More program

01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:05.440
runs 24 hours a day on this dial-up stream. We've got all sorts of music, 2DX, DDR, everything

01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:11.700
including dance mania and other music games. So now, Rob, are we going to be adding that

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:19.700
list of songs we would like to hear in Bimani? A couple weeks ago we were talking about the

01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:24.220
songs that we think should be in Bimani that aren't yet. Yeah, some of those songs do show

01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:28.700
up. Jamie and I put in a pickle week on the music stuff and we'll be adding some of the

01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:32.100
stuff that was talked about that show also. Who knows, perhaps we could make that a contest

01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:36.940
for the future, you know. And yeah, if you guys want to send us email, it's orangeloungeradio,

01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:41.520
that's all one word, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com. Your suggestions for music you

01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:45.900
think should be on the station, even if it's not in a mamati game, if it should be, why?

01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:48.900
Let us know and then tell us. Send us a sound clip of your voice, say who you are and what

01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:54.240
you think should be in, you know. You might find yourself a local celebrity. You got it.

01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:58.560
So thanks everybody for listening, and we'll see you next Sunday.

01:57:58.560 --> 01:57:59.560
I guess that's about it.

01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:01.520
Anybody else have any closing words they want to say?

01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:04.720
Thanks all of you for being here, Ryan, even though you were only here 15 minutes.

01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:05.720
Thanks everyone else.

01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:08.000
But hey, he's here, and that's the important part.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
That's right.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.420
He's into Orange Lounge, Bongo demands it!

01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:16.160
I think that only one cuss word was said this entire show.

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.160
And I said it, I think.

01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:19.640
Will you care to remedy that situation then, Dave?

01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:20.640
Uh, no.

01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:23.640
I can't copy Brad, because last time he was just talking about it.

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:27.640
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, shitty poopy.

01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:31.640
There's a quote.

01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:35.640
Remember folks, this show is brought to you by DVDA.

01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:39.640
