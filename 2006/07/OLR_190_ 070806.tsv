14514	24325	Tonight, Sony stirs up major controversy with a new billboard, Nintendo gives President Bush a birthday present, and does Microsoft have some secret Christmas plans?
32520	35504	Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
51656	53378	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
74420	76060	We brought on our good buddy Shane.
76080	76480	How you doing?
76680	77481	I'm doing good.
77541	78541	Also known as Miklatov.
78901	79161	Yep.
79461	81761	And now Shane is actually, he's being hardcore tonight.
81781	83322	He's actually playing a game during the show.
83702	84662	I'm multitasking.
85362	86642	I'm hardcore every show.
87962	89383	You usually play games too, don't you?
89643	90663	Well, you do them on break.
91783	93423	I'll be doing the music break and then he comes back.
93443	95264	Sometimes you yell at me if I play them during the show.
95284	96724	Well, because it gets distracting.
96744	97504	Even this is distracting.
97524	98344	You just turn it down.
98904	100405	I don't know how to work a Mac.
101065	102485	He's playing on my Mac.
103170	104370	What are you playing?
104390	105451	You're playing World of Warcraft, right?
105471	107031	I'm playing World of Warcraft.
107071	107291	Fun.
108111	108392	All right.
108752	112193	We're going to get into the show real quick, but just first a couple housekeeping announcements.
113593	115373	Of course, we are taping a day early this week.
115413	117054	We are live on Saturday, not Sunday.
117774	123976	So if you'd like to join us, if you're listening live to OrangeLaunchRadio.com right now on the Saturday evening, head on over to our chat room, OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
123996	124636	Click on chat.
124876	128017	We will be back to our regular taping schedules next week.
128413	150266	So Sunday the 16th at 6pm Pacific Time, we're taping live on our station, OrangeLawnTrader.com But of course, you can always catch up via our podcast feed, which is also at OrangeLawnTrader.com Also tonight it's only going to be a one part show, there's not going to be a part B this week But just like last week, it ended up being at least an hour and a half, if not more So that's probably what tonight's show is going to end up being a little bit of too
150891	152292	So let's get it started.
152312	155073	We always like to start off with what we've been playing this week.
155193	156954	Loki, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?
157094	160336	I've been trying to finish Blazing Angels the entire game.
160716	163218	And I have 6 out of 7 achievements, so that's all that matters.
163238	164699	Achievement points, whore.
164799	169901	I've already beaten the game, and I can tell you this much, the game sucks really bad.
170662	171702	Why do you keep playing?
171943	178086	I got it for free, and I want to finish the achievement points before I send it back to its, you know,
178895	181237	Use Game Grave at GameStop
201890	203271	All the missions are basically the same.
203471	206872	And some, like, the missions are, you know, pretty similar difficulties.
207072	210533	And then some are just, like, way out there, like, way too damn hard.
210813	212114	And I don't get why they did that.
212554	214374	And then it goes, like, super easy afterwards.
214454	215755	So, whatever.
216075	216975	But I'm almost done.
217015	222397	All I gotta do now is I have to play through these standard arcade modes, which you have to play with 32 different planes.
222437	224878	So I have to play it 32 times all the way through.
225878	253164	and basically you take on like four different waves of planes and it's really boring but once I do that I'll have the last achievement so that's all the matters um and I don't know if the multiplayer online's any good but I know the multiplayer split screen's kind of lame so I don't know be worth checking out I did also get to play the Chromehounds demo which is pretty awesome and um you know unfortunately the mechs are pretty slow in it so I
253666	254987	You know, I did play a little bit more of that.
255227	257868	Can't wait for the final game to come out, I think, this week.
258769	260790	And then Prey, also played some of that.
260910	263091	That game reminds me so much of Duke Nukem 3D.
263651	264712	It's just crazy.
264732	275798	They actually have inside the arcade where you first start off in the bar, there's an arcade game that's like Pac-Man, and you can actually play the arcade game in there, which is kind of neat.
276398	283202	So, very interactive, just like Duke Nukem 3D, and kind of similar to Doom 3 in how dark and, you know,
284397	292059	Dead Rising, Saints Row, Enchanted Arms My gaming week, I was in Canada most of the week on vacation, so I took a vacation from the internet and gaming a lot in general, but I did
311687	312768	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
339002	340943	and Gradius 4 I don't think I've ever played before.
340963	346546	I've played 5, I've played 3, I've played 2 on emulators because it was only out in Japan, I believe.
348387	352610	But now I've gotten a chance to play all the Gradius games and it makes a good collection.
354091	357833	They enhanced Gradius 1 and 2 a little bit so that it's widescreen.
358613	364837	It's not perfectly the PSP's resolution, you can downsize it to the regular resolution, but it works well on the widescreen.
364857	367218	You don't feel like the game's stretched or anything like that.
367908	369430	The game plays pretty smoothly.
369750	374934	I would say my favorite game out of the bunch is Gradius Gaiden, probably Gradius 3, my least favorite, just because I don't...
375213	376494	I just don't like the way that game starts.
376554	378115	I don't like the first stage in it.
378195	381358	The difficulty curve in that one seems to be a lot higher than the other games.
382058	385261	But it's a good game for rekindling all your favorite Gradius memories.
385301	388123	Like, oh, it's the Easter Island heads and all that stuff.
389364	392206	The only other thing that probably bothered me about the game was the price.
392266	394428	I mean, it was $39.99 for the game.
394848	402594	And while it's a real great, you know, it's still a pretty good value, it's kind of surprising that old games are demanding $40.
403254	404135	But I guess it's just because
404734	406657	You get so many of them, and they did rehash it.
407258	407939	It's a good buy.
407960	409883	I would recommend it, especially if you're into shooters.
410564	413268	It's a good no-attention-span shooter.
413288	415071	You just pick it up, go, have fun with it.
415644	445250	I also like that you can save your progress anywhere so you can just save and come back later instead of having to start over every time like the old versions of Gradius the other disappointment is that I don't see Salamander unless it's an unlock I need to check GameFAQs to see if maybe I just haven't unlocked it yet because I haven't actually beat any of the Gradius games yet while I've had it because I keep having ADD I go back and forth to all the different games and I couldn't get the up up down down left right left right BA code to work mainly because there is no BA buttons on the PSP but I press what I think would be BA but it doesn't seem to work
445711	446451	Thanks for watching!
471789	473891	So Konami's got some good stuff coming out?
473911	474151	Who knows?
474171	474611	Except for me.
499378	500799	and people that work there in Konami.
501980	506902	Then I also played some Wendon this week because I love that game a lot.
507603	526253	And my computer at home broke so I can't play WoW there so to pass the time I downloaded Bejeweled 2 on Xbox Live Arcade and that game, I always loved Bejeweled and I don't think it works too well on the 360 but it's got really good music so it was worth it.
528054	528995	I think it's pretty.
529537	530237	I'll give it that.
530677	531098	The game?
531378	531938	Or the music?
533518	533899	The game.
534159	536099	It looks nice on HD and all that good stuff.
536119	545103	It looks nice, but it's not as easy to play because when you play it on computer you have your mouse and you can go really quick to whatever little jewel you want to swap.
545603	549884	But this one you have to move up three times and left three times.
551665	554446	So I don't think it plays well, but the music's really good.
555106	557627	And I guess the only other thing I've done this week is at work
558103	561691	We follow a certain site's... Can I say that site right there?
561731	562192	I don't know.
562352	562813	Yeah, that's fine.
563134	568546	We follow the GameFAQ's Best Series Ever contest, and we put money on it.
569255	574119	So I've been paying very close attention to that this week, and I'm very upset by what's going on today.
574599	575780	What's happening today right now?
575840	580203	Halo is losing to Castlevania, and I picked Halo to win over Castlevania.
580463	582445	They do those little tournaments once in a while.
582485	584606	I know they do the best video game characters.
584686	586368	It's like $130 at work is on the line here.
586388	587468	Halo is like two games.
587528	589130	I wouldn't really call it a series.
590230	592012	Granted, there's a third game coming out, but...
592512	594233	That's not much of a series.
594293	597014	Oh, but they're only two of the most popular games of all time.
597034	602316	Yeah, but how many systems has Castlevania been on versus how many systems that Halo's been on?
602376	610759	Well, yeah, I would vote Castlevania, personally, but that's just because... Yeah, I would have too, but you have to think, okay, these people that come to the site, what do they like more?
611039	612740	And I thought maybe they like Halo more.
613160	613620	I was wrong.
613660	617142	Apparently they like Fire Emblem more than Silent Hill because they're idiots.
617242	617482	What?
617702	618883	Fire Emblem or Silent Hill?
639969	643551	Oh, I'm looking in our chatroom over at OrangeLotsRadio.com, click on chat.
643971	647093	And GK128, I guess, is in some sort of betting pool, too.
647133	648934	He says, Halo's loss fucked me, too.
649334	650955	I chose Halo to go three rounds.
651435	652736	Oh, that's terrible.
653056	653737	Because you know what?
653797	657319	Halo wouldn't have won over Kingdom Hearts, which is the next two in.
658019	660441	So, no, Halo couldn't make three rounds.
660461	661641	Which series did you pick to win it all?
662122	666424	I had the final two being Final Fantasy and Zelda, and I have Zelda winning.
667423	669965	I don't know, Final Fantasy, a lot of fanboys
691465	693346	and come on, Final Fantasy VII person?
693967	695428	Everybody loves Final Fantasy VII.
695448	698549	I know, Cloud, Aeris, Sephiroth.
698690	700591	I think it was Sephiroth versus Cloud for a little bit.
700611	701772	Tidus and Yuna.
701892	702732	I mean, come on.
703553	707055	I was just trying to use my knowledge from last year because I didn't win last year.
707095	707875	I didn't even come close.
708376	709817	This year I'm doing better, though, at least.
709837	710917	Cecil from IV.
712098	712378	Who?
712558	714780	Locke, the treasure hunter from VI.
715680	716241	I'm not a thief.
716941	717481	All right, forget it.
717581	718362	I like Edgar better.
720356	720876	Thanks for watching!
738086	739727	Didn't Pirates come out this week, too?
741207	747149	It was supposed to come out last week, and I think it got delayed to the 5th, and yeah, it came out finally.
748070	749390	Not that anybody cares.
749750	750911	It was a decent game.
751331	752271	Pirates of the Caribbean?
752291	753172	Yeah, I saw it at E3.
753212	754552	They gave us a little demo.
755092	757553	Bethesda actually invited us to a thingy we went to.
758093	760434	It was better than the PSP game, I can tell you that.
760454	764556	I was more impressed with their Star Trek game they're making, but the Pirates game seemed pretty solid.
765776	767417	For a movie title, you don't expect...
768260	768760	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
787847	788708	I don't know.
789308	791571	I'm going to probably check it out when it comes out in September.
792451	794173	And of course, Reservoir Dogs.
794653	798077	That's got me interested now that they explained why it was banned in Australia.
798137	799258	You know, where's my Kill Bill game?
799278	799798	Why was it banned?
800659	801200	Where's your what game?
801360	802441	Do you listen to this show?
802761	803522	Just out of curiosity?
803922	805103	No.
805143	805744	Where's your what game?
806465	806845	Kill Bill.
807285	807686	Kill Bill?
807846	808006	Yeah.
810216	811137	Red Steel.
811417	812518	Red Steel is probably close enough.
812698	818061	Turn off all the color on your TV and then play some really gory game and there you go.
818101	819761	There's your Kill Bill game.
820862	822983	Misty in our chatroom says, Who needs new games?
823023	825845	I've been playing the hell out of Emerald and Tetris Worlds on GBA.
828406	831148	Jeremy Todd 1 wants to know if Battle for Middle Earth 2 is any good.
831188	832468	He's thinking about getting it for PC.
832528	833169	How's the first one?
833189	833649	I like that.
834246	836247	Well, it got pretty decent reviews.
837047	852111	Like I said, though, it doesn't really look that... I used to love RTS games, especially the Command & Conquer series, but I think I liked it mainly because I could use... I could cheat and make my own characters, almost.
852672	855452	And I think that was more fun to me than actually playing through the game.
855793	858833	But I do like... I love the online from Red Alert.
858873	859934	That was my favorite game.
859954	860614	You know,
860919	861780	Back in my day Back in my day
884316	887578	Bandit sent me a private message in chat saying he had a great gaming week.
887618	891199	His local arcade just got DDR Supernova and his legs are killing him.
891400	892160	It's definitely worth it.
892180	895001	I guess DDR Supernova is starting to get into arcades there.
895021	899824	And of course, I know a large part of our fan base has followed us from the Bomani days when we talked a lot about those type of games.
899844	904306	Of course, I'm definitely looking forward to checking out the final build of Dance Dance Revolution Supernova.
904426	908608	We just got them in the bay at the Golf Lands, but of course we've had it at Konami forever.
909388	911129	and... Well, la-di-da.
911529	924112	And I'm curious to hear what people think of the timing, because, I mean, I haven't played it enough to, like, really figure out if it's bad or not, but I'm hearing reports that it's pretty dang terrible.
924492	933254	So, if anybody has played it, like that one guy, whoever you just said, I would be interested in hearing what he has to say.
933694	936955	Alright, well, let's get into some gaming news, and we'll come back to chatroom comments a little later.
937675	937735	Um...
938399	947623	Oh, I do want to point out real fast, I did look up Gradius on GameFAQs, and I don't see anything about there being the hidden game.
948884	955267	So that kind of disappoints me, that they don't have Salamander locked away in it.
955407	956207	That makes me kind of sad.
957248	958528	Anyway, let's get into some news.
958548	960209	This made a lot of people sad this week.
960429	964311	Certainly was a polarizing topic in the gaming community.
965195	970198	You might have heard Sony actually put out an ad for their ceramic white PSP.
970598	974421	Now, the ad actually only ran on billboards in the Netherlands.
974501	978843	But of course, thanks to the internet, the image has circulated worldwide.
979344	982986	And if you haven't seen the image yet, go to just about any major gaming site.
983006	983986	You can see a picture of this.
984046	990230	It's basically a white woman with white hair wearing a white outfit kind of grabbing this billboard.
990598	992919	Black Woman with Black Hair in a Black Outfit
1014351	1015633	Sony Spokesperson GamesIndustry.biz
1036650	1043472	Central to this campaign has been the creation of some stunningly photographed imagery that has been used on large billboards throughout Holland.
1043912	1051735	All of the 100 or so images created for the campaign have been designed to show this contrast in colors of the PSPs and have no other messages or purpose.
1052435	1052795	Hmm.
1053376	1054956	What do you guys think of this?
1055036	1057457	I think people are stupid for reacting about it.
1057517	1057897	Really?
1058297	1058858	Yeah, really.
1058918	1059598	I think it's retarded.
1060058	1062619	And in fact, some of the other pictures that they showed weren't that bad.
1062679	1066160	I mean, they showed like, you know, a cut in half and basically one's white, one's
1066841	1070583	Black, not necessarily showing the women, you know, poking each other or whatever.
1070943	1074684	But it's a fucking ad in another country.
1075025	1080367	And the thing that pisses me off the most is when politicians over here are going, I don't want to see that in my neighborhood.
1080527	1085669	Well, your neighborhood is all the way up in fucking, you know, what, Denmark is where it was?
1086249	1089631	I mean, it's stupid that, especially Congressman Yee.
1090531	1092412	That guy's a dumbass and needs to shut up.
1092432	1092492	Why?
1094110	1096492	Make a political statement about something that's in another country.
1096532	1098113	They'll do what they fucking want.
1098173	1100555	They have nudity on television over in the UK.
1100755	1102636	You don't see them going, Oh my God!
1102876	1103717	Oh my God!
1104017	1105438	Two people of different color.
1105719	1108080	I have never seen that in my entire life.
1108361	1110022	And oh my God, it's so racist.
1110042	1113484	To be a devil's advocate here for a minute though, Sony, I mean, just, you know, give the aside.
1113544	1115166	I'm not really sure how I feel about this.
1115246	1115466	I don't...
1116588	1128303	I think the image is a little odd and it doesn't exactly make me excited about the... I kind of go, well that's certainly going to get attention, which I guess an advertising campaign is supposed to do, but it's kind of one of those...
1129793	1133094	I wouldn't put an image like that out advertising Orange Lounge Radio, that's for sure.
1133935	1136396	You know what the worst thing about that image is?
1136716	1136916	What?
1137436	1139657	That Europe's getting the white PSP and we're not.
1139837	1140717	That made me angry.
1140757	1143559	That's the only thing that I really got from that.
1143619	1149621	Okay, my point though is that Sony is a worldwide company, though, and they do release products here in the United States.
1149961	1154465	And granted, when they're going to do something like this, thanks to the internet, this image has made it worldwide.
1154485	1159589	It's going to show up in magazines here, not as an ad, but just the buzz about it.
1159670	1162072	And Sony being a worldwide company who does put out products here.
1163153	1165835	Wow, yeah, it's such a wonderful advertising campaign.
1165855	1171440	Like the last one with the really annoying, sketchy squirrels and dust balls that talked about the PSP.
1172000	1175223	Oh yeah, it made me want to really go out and buy a PSP, just like this one.
1175263	1177365	This does not make me want to go out and buy a PSP.
1178260	1182042	They really need to cut off the cancerous PR department of Sony.
1182102	1185104	That's what the problem stems from.
1186324	1189046	People that get to do the advertising are retarded.
1189446	1191867	I think this advertisement is actually okay.
1191987	1193128	It really doesn't bother me.
1193488	1202433	And a couple of my co-workers, when we saw that ad, the first time we just looked at it not very intensely, I didn't even see the black woman there, actually.
1202793	1205074	I was like, oh, a white chick advertising the PSP.
1205294	1206455	What's racist about that?
1207316	1207636	Oh, I see it.
1234978	1238679	And there's some that are not even really that bad.
1239319	1239820	Interesting.
1240240	1243901	So do you think the media just latched onto this one image and now it's become this big misunderstanding?
1243961	1247702	Yeah, because they have Slow News Week and they really need something to talk about.
1248362	1249443	Interesting perspective.
1251743	1255605	Going to the chat room, Funnydale says, Thank God Sony never released the PSP in yellow.
1256565	1256885	Oh boy.
1257669	1258770	Oh, I want to say stuff.
1259070	1259450	All right.
1259990	1260330	Anyway.
1260350	1260910	But I won't.
1261090	1261411	All right.
1261471	1264672	So anyway, some striking imagery there.
1264772	1269854	Definitely provoking reaction, which I guess an ad campaign is supposed to do.
1269914	1270794	But is it ethical?
1270994	1271775	That's the question.
1272155	1273975	So definitely looking forward to your feedback.
1273995	1275976	And we definitely want to get your feedback on this issue.
1276336	1279638	And we'll tell you a little more information on how you can do that a little later in the program.
1280918	1283399	It wouldn't be the first time that they're advertising, you know,
1284244	1284744	and so on.
1309127	1310088	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1334276	1340979	That, of course, has been fixed and still no official word from Sony about what their PR firm did.
1341079	1343380	But it's still kind of funny seeing an Apple logo on there.
1344120	1346041	And, you know, I don't know.
1346261	1355205	Another speculation was that they were using some Apple software, a product called Apple Shake, to create the file.
1355285	1359567	And they were using a beta, not beta, but a demo version that wasn't allowed.
1359687	1361208	So it kept a watermark on there.
1361516	1362917	That, to me, is incredibly funny.
1363157	1366479	Yeah, I'd read that theory, too, that they were using the trial software.
1366519	1366879	That's funny.
1366899	1368821	Because Sony never steals from anybody.
1369261	1369621	Ever.
1369701	1370622	Okay, look, though.
1370682	1371122	Come on.
1371402	1372403	It's their PR firm.
1372443	1374384	I know it has nothing to do with Sony.
1374424	1374805	No, no.
1374865	1378187	I know it's easy to pick on Sony in this day and age after E3, but come on.
1378267	1383210	I mean, you either have Apples or PCs at your place of employment.
1383270	1385191	Even Sony probably uses these type of computers.
1385211	1391055	The thing is, though, is it's actually from, you know, it's from, like,
1391966	1394929	An actual flash file from what looks like the iPod side.
1395009	1402635	In fact, they've disassembled it, taken that part out of the background, which is like the smoke effect, looks like smoke dropping from the ceiling, kind of rolling along the ground stuff.
1403195	1409201	And they've taken it out, and just that one section they've isolated, and it's clearly stolen from something.
1409221	1411182	Well, maybe that's just a stock effect in the program.
1411542	1414865	No, it's something clearly stolen from something else.
1414985	1415466	Interesting.
1415506	1417467	So somebody... It's in trouble.
1417668	1419209	But it's just kind of sloppy.
1420353	1420633	Whatever.
1420653	1421454	It is funny, though.
1421754	1427137	People are speculating, oh my god, what if the announcement happens with... No, not going to happen.
1428738	1443205	Somebody in our chat room, TigerClaw, reminded me of something I was supposed to mention earlier during the last story about the ad, is that Control-Alt-Delete, the comic, ran a pretty funny response to the ad that had a skinny white guy and a fat white guy, and it was an ad for the DS Lite.
1443626	1443926	Get it?
1444006	1444286	Yeah.
1444696	1446197	So, I thought that was pretty funny.
1446377	1447678	That's creative marketing.
1447938	1449298	Well, that's just... It was real.
1449438	1450619	It's a creative response.
1451680	1453541	And a very interesting comic.
1454741	1459564	Anyway... They should get something like a DS on an operating table with, like, a liposuction tube.
1459924	1462645	And then, like, that would be a good advertising campaign.
1462685	1465967	Or, like, a picture of, you know, Oprah when she was big and Oprah when she was skinny.
1466007	1467488	Or any celebrity this last week.
1467528	1469729	Like, you know, Roseanne.
1470382	1470502	P.S.
1470522	1470742	Goatsy
1491909	1492549	You make me sad.
1493689	1505012	Speaking of Sony and kicking them while they're down, it almost seems like, it looks like Sony has been ordered to pay $243 million in back taxes to the Japanese government.
1505372	1509453	These taxes are related to transactions between the games division and the U.S.
1509513	1514894	subsidiary of the company, as well as overseas transactions relating to CD and DVD making.
1515554	1516694	Sony had a comment on this.
1516754	1521455	Sony and SCEI believe that their allocation of income for the periods in question was appropriate.
1521775	1525116	and they have paid the proper amount of taxes in each of the jurisdictions.
1525877	1528358	Man, these guys just aren't getting a break this year.
1528398	1530559	This is... The bad news keeps on coming.
1531599	1534240	It's like beating a dead hooker over and over and over again.
1534441	1536081	Which you could do in one of their games.
1536261	1536702	Exactly.
1537382	1539303	But it's also on the Xbox, to be fair.
1539963	1548327	But anyways, that's not really the bad part about it, but analysts are saying that the PS3 could be third in the next-gen console race, and mainly the...
1549235	1558577	The basis of this is that their brand strength is not enough to get people to spend the $600 on their system.
1559437	1570319	It's not like where you had the PlayStation 2 come out at a better time and for a lot less, whereas that fueled the whole DVD launch.
1572159	1574940	Nowadays, it's like, do you really need Blu-ray?
1575180	1575400	I mean,
1576451	1576771	I don't know.
1577071	1578412	Sony believes we do.
1579052	1580693	Sony would like you to think that you need Blu-ray.
1580713	1581973	Sony also thinks we need UMD stuff.
1581993	1582813	But here's the thing though.
1583213	1585934	I mean, my thought on it is Blu-ray, I don't need it.
1586074	1587695	And I don't need HD DVD either.
1587915	1592777	So, I mean, not really a fault in Sony for bringing on the Blu-ray.
1592957	1594658	Because you can use that for their games and stuff.
1594678	1597238	That's fine to have their own proprietary format for the games.
1597539	1603301	So even if it doesn't work as a DVD video system or whatever, it'll still work for their games.
1603921	1604161	Well,
1604784	1606305	Same goes with HD DVD.
1606345	1607326	I don't think I need that either.
1608887	1615032	I would benefit from an HD DVD player or even Blu-ray, but when the price is right, that's my issue.
1615213	1624961	My issue with Sony right now is that, like the name for Nintendo's new system, I've gotten almost over the fact that the only model worth getting is the $600 one.
1625321	1630926	They just haven't shown anything that's going to be out anytime soon that looks even remotely interesting.
1630946	1633908	I look at the launch list and I'm like, so what?
1634358	1637499	And in fact, there was like a game, like for example, I was like, ooh, Full Auto 2.
1637659	1643461	Ooh, I gotta, you know, that's a really good, you know, I love Full Auto, you know, almost, you know, maybe I should get the system for that.
1643641	1646502	Oh wait, Full Auto 2's coming out for the Xbox 360 later on.
1647162	1648683	Okay, well I don't need to get the system then.
1649059	1650680	You know, what would they have that's exclusive?
1650740	1651260	Motorstorm?
1651440	1652281	Meh, lame.
1652441	1655782	Maybe they'll have Phantavision 2, and then I'll actually have a reason to do that.
1655882	1658524	Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy XIII.
1658544	1660065	Are they going to be launched?
1660085	1661065	No, but they're great.
1661765	1664687	I'm just saying, you will have to get a PS3 eventually if you want to play this game.
1664707	1665988	When it goes down in price.
1666008	1667408	That's great that Metal Gear Solid 4's coming out.
1667448	1669369	Xbox 360's been out a year and hasn't gone down in price.
1670310	1676473	You know, I don't think that it's going to drop in price anytime soon, and you know, until there's some better games out there, I'm not buying one.
1676873	1677453	But you know what?
1677473	1678074	Hey, whatever.
1678134	1678374	I mean...
1679417	1685782	They could totally pull it out and say, you know, they could have some big secret stuff that they're not talking about and that would be, you know, really amazing.
1685822	1687023	Well, it ain't the Eye of Judgment.
1688485	1689626	That is the worst idea.
1689646	1691607	It was that card game, right?
1691647	1692968	Yeah, it's the card game.
1693068	1694289	Here's the thing about the Eye of Judgment.
1694810	1696571	I don't know how the hell they're going to execute this.
1696992	1702296	Because, to be honest, the Eye toy sucks for, you know, that type of gameplay.
1702476	1705679	And the way that they're set up, they have this, like, really elaborate, like,
1708240	1714282	I don't see how it's going to be possible to do this, even reasonably why you would want to do this in the first place.
1714742	1721463	It was a great idea as a proof of concept thing, but as a game, I don't see it happening.
1721963	1723243	I don't get how they're going to do it.
1723283	1724564	Chatroom wanted to correct me on something.
1724624	1733826	Xbox 360 has actually only been out nine months, not a year, but the price isn't going to drop by November either, as far as we know.
1733886	1735546	I still stand by what I said.
1735566	1735846	It still can...
1736964	1740388	The only reason it would have had to is if PS3 announced it was coming out for $499.
1740488	1743832	Or $399, whatever the Xbox reason is.
1743892	1747016	I don't think they're not going to drop the price of the 360.
1747617	1753504	If anything, they may drop it later, like once first quarter comes around next year.
1754145	1756888	But they might drop the price of the Xbox.
1758343	1760204	Banda makes an interesting comment in our chat room.
1760324	1764325	I want a PS3 for the games too, but Sony doesn't want to make a console just for games.
1764665	1771288	If it weren't for that damn Blu-ray crap, I like... PS3 is going to be sold more as your living room centerpiece.
1771308	1775650	It's your movie, game, internet, picture, I don't know, system.
1776030	1778331	Do you think that's going to win Sony any points from people?
1778811	1780892	No, not at all.
1780952	1781572	Well, here's the thing.
1781612	1785093	I have a PSP as well, and what do I use it for?
1785233	1786374	I use it for games.
1786634	1786934	I don't...
1787974	1788955	I don't have any pictures on it.
1789256	1791017	I don't have any movies on it.
1791178	1797223	Okay, but I've heard from listeners who download our show on their PSP, and we have the PSP websites, which are pretty kick-butt.
1797263	1800767	So some people out there are getting used to some of the other functions of the PSP.
1801448	1802709	I like the web stuff on the PSP.
1802729	1805792	You know what's funny, too, about the whole PS3 thing?
1805932	1808054	It's still floating around out there that they're saying that
1809058	1813782	It's possible that Sony may do that thing to eliminate used game sales.
1815864	1816725	I don't buy it.
1817325	1825071	They're trying to push for digital distribution, and I really think they're trying it out with this PSP emulation thing.
1825231	1830776	If it works well for that, they're going to move it to... I bet you that's probably going to be on the PS3 when that comes out.
1830976	1832297	Alright, let's keep it moving here.
1832697	1834079	I want to talk about this on the PSP.
1834139	1836781	I think this is actually a pretty cool idea here.
1837081	1840044	This was a story that ran on Kotaku.
1840084	1851193	A graduate student, Jonas Heilscher, put together this interesting piece that he put on YouTube that is this game where you go around and you're looking for access points.
1851533	1859980	And as you collect the access points, you get a distinct color, shape, or sound based based on whatever that MAC address is of the point that you find.
1860593	1866217	and what you do is you fill this three by three grid with shapes trying to get three in a row as you find the points.
1866717	1872941	Now, if you ever get an unsecure access point though, it might wipe the grid clean or act as a wild card.
1873021	1879024	So basically the game encourages you to get out and walk, which I think is a neat idea.
1879725	1882006	But that's kind of a cool concept for a game.
1882046	1883447	I mean, it's nothing that
1883752	1886834	I don't think would ever be sold, but it was a cute tech demo idea.
1887395	1890237	That reminds me of when they were going to release a GPS thing.
1890437	1891258	Yeah, geocaching.
1891278	1892158	It made me think of that too.
1892999	1894780	That would be a great idea for the PSP.
1894800	1896221	I think it would be a lot of fun.
1896241	1903587	Can you imagine, this might sound really cheesy, but take one of those TV shows like Treasure Hunters, The Game, or something that could rely on geocaching.
1904127	1909451	Not that you would really travel around the world for real, but maybe something that interacts with the geocache to kind of
1909929	1915491	You know, encourage people to go outside and use their PSPs and kind of interact in a whole different way.
1916111	1916851	I think that would be a neat idea.
1916871	1918231	But the screen sucks outside.
1919071	1919412	I think.
1919532	1920772	Yeah, that's a good point.
1920812	1922552	The LCD screens really do suck.
1922612	1924573	Can't you get something, though, that kind of helps that?
1924593	1928034	An umbrella?
1928054	1931835	Well, if you design the lights, lighting and everything correctly, it might work okay.
1933835	1938337	It does require firmware 2.0 to play and they do plan on putting it on their site in the near future.
1938397	1938957	It's Pixel 6
1940319	1940940	So check it out.
1940960	1942180	The name of the game is Collectic.
1942420	1943641	So that's actually pretty cool.
1944281	1955225	And kind of back to what we were talking about before, both Sega and Ubisoft want the PS3 to drop in price.
1956186	1969311	They're basically saying that it's too expensive and they're worried that because it is so expensive that it might not be competitive enough with the Xbox 360 and not as many units may sell
1970032	1984607	and of course that affects them especially when they're releasing games on those consoles because they're unable to make as many or sell as many on that system so you know that's kind of a I think that's a shared sentiment from everybody that they want the price to drop but
1985182	1995846	Didn't crazy Sony guy, I forget his name, Kaz Harai or whatever, didn't he say that he's not even guaranteeing that the price of games would be $59.99 or whatever?
1996607	1997667	Yeah, he said it could be more.
1998287	2002129	It could be, but that's not a good way to sell your console.
2002589	2005230	It's not a console, it's a media center.
2006110	2006590	Oh, I'm sorry.
2007471	2009712	Yeah, so, interesting.
2010032	2010412	Interesting.
2011360	2013221	All right, let's switch consoles for a minute here.
2013261	2015243	Let's go over and talk about the Nintendo Wii.
2015283	2016964	This shouldn't be a surprise to anybody.
2017725	2021988	A lot of people like to joke about the power brick that comes with the Xbox 360 because that thing is huge.
2022348	2030154	Well, pictures have leaked of the Wii's power supply, and it's not so big, but it's about the size of the GameCube power supply.
2030234	2033196	But honestly, is this a huge surprise considering that
2033780	2037542	I wouldn't be surprised if it was running on the same power supply as the GameCube.
2037562	2038102	But it's just like the...
2052382	2057830	The PlayStation 2, how you can use all the audio cables and video cables with the PlayStation 1.
2058010	2060233	Oh hell, those Nintendo cables you can use.
2060293	2064339	I think it's the same cables for Super Nintendo all the way through GameCube.
2064700	2066322	You can use that same AV thing.
2067323	2068084	That's pretty cool.
2068104	2069226	That's the way to do it, I think.
2070049	2071611	Well, I mean, it's just an AV cable.
2072252	2074315	I mean, that kind of technology doesn't change.
2074355	2086773	But what is interesting is even though we know that the Wii is not going to support high def 720 or whatever, maybe they'll still release, you know, red, green, blue.
2087281	2087861	Progressive?
2089242	2089583	Component?
2089603	2090103	Damn it, thank you.
2090143	2090623	Component.
2090924	2092325	Maybe they'll still release component cables.
2092465	2094646	Didn't GameCube for a little while have component cables?
2095147	2096428	They're just really hard to come by now.
2096448	2099470	Even on the Xbox, remember the Xbox, some of the games were actually 720p.
2100150	2100971	Very few, but yeah.
2101091	2114201	Very few, but still, I mean, I would like to see, you know, sure their focus is not going to be high def, but if someone wants to do a high def game to maybe allow some way to do that, I think that would be kind of cool.
2115562	2115842	I don't know.
2116462	2121144	Because I remember some of the games for the GameCube were progressive scan as well.
2122684	2127145	Well, you had a few that were widescreen at least, like F-Zero is pretty kick-ass.
2127626	2128746	Yeah, so I don't know.
2129886	2135228	But it's not because I don't have component cables for the GameCube because they're so freaking hard to find.
2135268	2136048	I still don't have them.
2136088	2138769	I have a digital out on the GameCube, but I just don't have those cables.
2139369	2144351	You know, F-Zero just doesn't look as good as, you know,
2144918	2147639	Even an Xbox game that did have the component cables.
2147679	2148700	So, I don't know.
2149960	2156923	Alright, speaking of Nintendo, there was announcements made about their brand new line of games that's going to be coming out.
2156943	2164146	Kind of like the Touch Generations, whereas those were not really games per se, but more of kind of
2164738	2168461	for everybody type stuff, you know, or Nintendogs and Brain Training, etc.
2169301	2174665	Well, now they have a brand new lineup called Bit Generations, and these actually look pretty sweet.
2175445	2186053	Included in that are going to be, you know, puzzle and rhythm games designed for the Game Boy Advance, including DotStream, Boldish, Dialhex,
2187059	2206837	Digidrive, Orbital, Colorist, and Sound Voyager and they're all really simple looking games but they all look really cool actually and pretty fun to play and they're going to be for about $25 in American and will ship in the second and fourth weeks in July in Japan
2208152	2209933	Some other new games are coming out for the DS.
2209973	2211474	Not just the DS, but the PSP.
2212155	2214997	And they're coming from one of my favorite developers, Q Entertainment.
2215197	2216758	You know I love Luminous and Meteos.
2216778	2218599	Those are two of my favorite games that came out last year.
2218920	2220161	Well, there are new games coming out.
2220201	2222742	I'm not talking about Luminous 2 or Every Extend Extra.
2222782	2223683	I'm talking about some other stuff.
2224484	2230008	Famitsu Magazine is reporting that Bandai Namco is going to be publishing two new Q Entertainment games.
2230108	2233190	One is going to be out for the PSP, and it's called Gun P.R.
2233230	2234651	It's short for Gun P. Reverse.
2235191	2240274	And the DS is going to get a game that translates to the name Connect the Sounds, Gun P. Reverse.
2240834	2246438	Both are music-based puzzle games, and they're based on a 1999 WonderSwan game called Gun P.,
2247359	2260209	too bad Jamie's not here because she'd probably actually know that one because I never owned a Wonderswan but she did oh no, duh, I mean I do have a Wonderswan thanks to a gracious listener but I have one game for it I don't really play a lot of Wonderswan games maybe I should check this one out though
2261866	2269169	Basically, for those that haven't played it, it's got square pieces and they all have a diagonal line and it rises from the bottom of the screen to the top.
2269229	2273931	You move the pieces up and down, trying to get a line going from left to right.
2274451	2276372	The panels will then disappear if you do this.
2276952	2280293	The game ends early if the pieces get to the top of the field.
2280834	2287016	On the PSP version, there'll be emphasis on music and video, kind of like Luminous, how it had skins.
2287595	2294478	But on the DS, it's going to be more stylus emphasized as opposed to having the skins.
2294518	2300020	However, the game will still make sounds when you clear panel, and it'll try to line up the sounds with the background music.
2300080	2301541	So that should be interesting.
2302441	2303922	It sounds a lot like that game.
2304202	2305303	It's a PopCap game.
2306203	2307224	It's the fireworks.
2308224	2310945	It's like a festival game with the fireworks.
2310985	2311966	I can't even remember the name of it now.
2312846	2313686	I'm sure someone chatted.
2313726	2314186	No idea.
2314367	2315327	I'm sure someone chatted.
2316220	2317101	It's a little different though.
2317121	2320043	You turn these, but you're trying to line things up from left to right.
2320063	2322605	And when you do that, these fireworks go off and you get points.
2323125	2324386	It's a cheesy game.
2324466	2329289	It might be a cool game for our latest Nintendo DS owner here.
2330410	2337034	President Bush was actually given a Nintendo DS and brain training for his 60th birthday.
2337094	2338355	I wonder what Nintendo's trying to tell him.
2338595	2339415	That he's stupid.
2341096	2347061	And they attach the letter to it and says, Don't worry, turning 60 is an exciting milestone.
2347181	2353967	As you know, you've joined the millions of other baby boomers in an invigorating new decade of your life.
2354407	2358070	And like many boomers, you may be looking for ways to keep your mind sharp.
2358491	2359512	That's where we come in.
2360733	2365176	Please accept our gift of a new Nintendo DS Lite and a copy of Brain Age.
2365296	2367178	Train your brain in minutes a day.
2367638	2369440	And what do you think actually ended up happening to that?
2370189	2370570	I don't know.
2379141	2379641	He might.
2380162	2384404	He's, you know, a normal guy despite, you know, the fact I disagree with the politics or whatever.
2384444	2385205	He seems to be a normal guy.
2385225	2386065	Well, he has a lot of time off.
2386105	2387086	So he has a lot of time off.
2387206	2388087	Maybe he'll check it out.
2388107	2389828	You know, something to do on Air Force One.
2389868	2390228	I don't know.
2390888	2391109	All right.
2391129	2391409	Who knows?
2391489	2394491	It's actually a super secret spy device to find out what's going on.
2394531	2399194	Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat room seems to think President Bush probably won't even be able to turn the damn DS light on.
2399214	2400775	That's true.
2400875	2401595	You guys are harsh.
2401795	2403757	I don't get these fangled computer things.
2403777	2404037	Yeah.
2405979	2406820	All right.
2406940	2410363	Now, if you are craving for some new games, we have some release dates for you.
2410403	2411224	And I'm going to start it off.
2411264	2416889	I know Jamie's not here tonight, but I don't want to neglect the UK audience because we have some awesome UK listeners.
2417610	2421374	You know, I think next year, I know I keep saying I want to go to Australia, but I'm torn.
2421434	2423075	I either want to go to Australia or I want to go to UK.
2423175	2423596	One of the two.
2424076	2426979	So I'll probably do one next year and then one the year after that.
2427019	2427940	And that's assuming I'm rich.
2429554	2429974	So we'll see.
2430015	2433418	Anyway, here's some release dates here for the UK.
2433498	2443108	You guys have coming out on the 14th, you have Cars coming out on some various platforms, everything from GameCube, PS2, and Xbox, all the way to the PC and portable platforms as well.
2444111	2446092	Pirates of the Caribbean, The Legend of Jack Sparrow
2462719	2464021	on the Xbox 360.
2464101	2476015	Looking ahead a little bit to the week of the 21st, you guys are getting in the UK, Def Jam Fight for New York, The Takeover on the PSP, Infected on the PSP, and Field Commander on the PSP from Ubisoft.
2476316	2479099	Also coming out for the PlayStation 2, World Super Police.
2479760	2481362	Big week next week in the UK for Sony.
2481946	2484228	Lots of stuff for the US too, especially if you have a 360.
2484969	2487911	You're going to be getting Prey, of course.
2488812	2489372	Awesome game.
2489732	2491053	Chromehounds, also on the 360.
2491093	2500681	And then finally, if you don't have a 360, they have Sprint Cars or the Knoxville, which is, I don't know, a game you probably won't want to pick up.
2501281	2504744	Of course, the following week, you've got lots of stuff.
2504864	2508167	NCAA Football 2007, of course, on PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PSP.
2511493	2517216	Monster House, Super Dragon Ball Z, Painkiller, Zen-Eyed I don't know, just kind of one of the Japanese shooter games.
2517276	2519217	Kind of like Raiden 3 or something.
2542509	2543049	XBOX 360 Faceplates
2561573	2563254	In other words, it's just Halo graphics with a number 3 on it.
2582130	2583210	Viva Piñata I hate that franchise
2612393	2614516	It's kind of like the snakes on the plane thing for me.
2615597	2628432	Also, there was a new Wii game announced, and I don't know if you're going to be excited by this, because I played the PlayStation 2 version of it, and I didn't like it too much, but Rampage World Tour, or Total Destruction, I mean.
2628572	2629253	Where'd you hear that?
2629313	2629994	Is that another thing?
2630214	2631335	It's through my work, yeah.
2631355	2631996	That seems like a...
2632643	2641727	Odd release, you're right, that game seems a little dated Rampage Total Destruction is going to be coming out on the Wii It's going to be $29.99 Are they going to enhance it at all, you think?
2641947	2661436	Probably not, not for $29.99 It's supposed to be out in December I don't know, I didn't like the PlayStation 2 game I thought that it was very unbalanced and just not very fun to play But hey, you know what, it's just another game for us So expect that out in December Any other release date news?
2663134	2665636	I think that's all I've got that's brand new.
2666958	2669060	Lots of PS3 games coming, that's for sure.
2670381	2672363	Oh, it looks like we're getting a call on the Skype line.
2672403	2674264	Let's go to the Skype line and see who's there.
2674345	2674685	Hello?
2675586	2676066	Hello!
2676467	2677628	Hey, Jamie, is that you?
2678428	2678929	Yeah.
2679029	2679810	Where are you at?
2680470	2681171	San Jose.
2681491	2681952	San Jose.
2681992	2683093	What's going on in San Jose today?
2683851	2690757	California Extreme, it's a big coin-op and pinball convention thing.
2690817	2696201	Yeah, the husband kidnapped me, but I figured it's good stuff for Orange Lounge.
2701670	2703270	Pretty much old games, new games.
2703290	2704691	They have Mambo, a Go-Go.
2705271	2707832	They have actually Hip Hop Mania 2.
2708512	2710112	There's a couple of DDRs.
2710452	2713333	There's a couple of prototype pinballs that I got to play.
2713793	2719274	One of them is Kingpin and the other one is Big Bang Bar, which our old listeners will know that I've been into that one for a while.
2719634	2721015	What exactly do they do at this show?
2721055	2725596	Is this just everybody brings their games out and people play them or is it trying to sell machines or what are they doing there?
2726383	2728985	You bring three games, you're in as an exhibitor, you get in for free.
2729666	2733228	Other than that, you pay a decent amount to get in.
2733289	2736371	Like, we paid $30 each just for Saturday.
2737432	2737872	And what do they do?
2737892	2739033	They just let you play games all day?
2739774	2740154	Pretty much.
2740674	2744137	And there's other little panels going on and different things like that.
2744497	2747079	But really, I'm just following all the games around.
2747139	2752143	They actually have a marquee for a Hercules game, which was Atari's biggest pinball machine.
2752163	2752604	Okay.
2753624	2756445	What are some interesting games that you've actually got a chance to play today?
2757506	2758066	Big Bang Bar.
2758946	2764208	I just got my butt handed to me on Black Knight 2000, which is one of my favorite machines ever.
2766629	2768790	Dan played Arabian Nights, which I thought was pretty cool.
2768830	2775433	It's got like a genie and you hit the lamp and it turns around and you get a different score and everything.
2776774	2778855	I actually did play some Beatmania.
2778895	2779555	I couldn't help myself.
2781218	2787040	and I mainly was just walking around taking pictures for the first part of it, but I'm actually going to go back in and play things.
2787140	2788281	There's a few things I want to try.
2788681	2789161	Very cool.
2789201	2790942	Are the pictures going to go on the website later this week?
2791622	2792443	They absolutely will.
2792523	2795664	I also do have some video footage of some of the more rare games, too.
2795684	2796684	You know, there's a tapper there.
2797645	2799165	Oh, like root beer tapper?
2799705	2800246	No, tapper.
2800906	2802086	Like Budweiser tapper?
2802727	2803267	Like beer.
2803646	2805928	That's awesome, because I love Budweiser, Tapper.
2806148	2808529	They have a Poo-Yan machine.
2808549	2810171	Oh, I remember Poo-Yan.
2811311	2812032	A long time.
2812432	2814033	Wow, yeah, I had that on the Commodore 64.
2814494	2815054	That's awesome.
2815774	2818556	They also have the Ultra Kade cocktail machines.
2819317	2820598	Oh, like to sit down and play?
2821576	2822777	Yeah, well, the bar top.
2823117	2826298	They have a few of the tables.
2826778	2835022	They actually have the little boxing game, which is like you look down inside of it and you're seeing from the top view of two boxers.
2835042	2836782	They also actually have the mechanical boxing game.
2838623	2840644	So what else are you going to get accomplished today while you're there?
2841924	2853351	I'm going to play a lot more Black Knight 2000 and a lot more Big Bang Bar and hopefully I can run into some of the people who own these machines and ask them about their maintenance and what they've gone into them.
2853932	2855112	Is this something they do every year?
2856073	2857214	Yeah, they do this every year.
2857334	2869161	In fact, last year, not last year, but the year before that, we tried to go to Classic Gaming Expo and it was really, really slow because this had just finished the week before and nobody wanted to bring their machines back.
2870422	2870922	Oh, interesting.
2871162	2874223	So you've got a lot of stuff from classic stuff to new stuff.
2874243	2875503	Do you see a lot of new stuff there?
2876843	2878023	There's The Grid.
2878623	2879023	It was there.
2880404	2882264	DDR, like it was a DDR Extreme.
2882284	2883064	There was a Solo.
2883144	2884404	There was a Mambo Go Go.
2884604	2889225	But nothing like super new, like Soul Calibur 3 Arcade or anything?
2889245	2890405	They don't have anything super new there?
2891446	2894306	No, nothing like really, really, really new.
2894426	2897927	But there was a Super Scope, not Super Scope, Silent Scope EX.
2898367	2898587	Huh.
2898967	2899107	And...
2900982	2909167	Just a few of the newer machines that most of it's like late 80s, early 90s.
2909307	2913270	There are a few pens from the 40s and 50s.
2913790	2917773	So is this something where people go to buy machines from private collectors?
2918533	2920515	This isn't something where they're selling to arcades.
2920535	2924137	This is something where they're selling to hardcore collectors with lots of money, right?
2924687	2925687	They're selling to collectors.
2925948	2930590	And not everything is really expensive, but that Hip Hop Mania machine I was playing, $400.
2932351	2934692	In great condition, much better than Golf Lens ever was.
2934892	2935492	Wow.
2935532	2936092	Well, cool.
2936132	2937633	So are you going to buy anything?
2937693	2939074	Are you and Dan coming back with anything?
2940114	2940614	Joke's Back and Forth
2964011	2964731	Oh my gosh.
2964971	2965231	Wow.
2965671	2965851	Wow.
2966251	2966492	Yeah.
2966632	2968232	That's why it was a big deal for me to play one.
2968512	2970732	Anything else you want to share about the show with the listeners and anything?
2971653	2972713	I'm still going tomorrow.
2972753	2975153	If anyone's in the Bay Area or nearby, come check it out.
2975433	2975893	It's worth it.
2976774	2977034	All right.
2977074	2977574	Very cool.
2977654	2979014	So what's the name of the show again?
2979034	2979754	Do they have a website?
2980634	2981795	California Extreme.
2981835	2984435	Actually, you can just do a Google hunt for it.
2985055	2988096	It's caextreme.com, I think, or .org.
2988356	2988576	Okay.
2989116	2989676	Very cool.
2990056	2990336	All right.
2990596	2991857	Well, thanks for calling in.
2991897	2993457	We miss you, and we'll see you next week, okay?
2994721	2995241	Alright, later!
3028865	3029926	Why don't you start us off, Loki?
3031127	3034170	Fuck you, the stupid people who can't park correctly.
3034690	3042518	And I'm sorry this also kind of goes to Christopher, he parked like a bitch, taking up two goddamn spaces with his car.
3042858	3048964	We saw a woman last night driving a stupid minivan, parks in like four spaces, and just walks right out.
3049583	3051144	Dumb bitches from Alaska, though.
3051184	3052344	I don't know if that makes a difference.
3052364	3052904	It doesn't.
3053044	3056145	But, you know, still I kind of stare at her like, you're an idiot.
3056245	3056846	Goddamn.
3056906	3065749	I mean, I understand there's not a lot of people in the parking lot, but when you take up four spaces because you're too fucking lazy to park correctly, I hate people like that.
3065769	3068490	And I'm sorry it always seems to be, you know, women in cars.
3068850	3074472	But then again, you get, you know, punk-ass bitches who drive their fucking giant trucks that take up six spaces, too.
3075272	3077553	Or the ones that park with the goddamn, you know...
3078283	3083746	U-Haul or some sort of trailer on there and they take up six spaces because they park, you know, across all of them.
3084026	3084626	Fuck you.
3085187	3089049	You do not need to be going to the movies if you have a goddamn trailer on your truck.
3089149	3090970	So just leave it at home.
3092250	3095832	I'd like to give an F you for what I believe is the second week in a row to the sun.
3096993	3099154	You might remember last week on the show I had a sunburn.
3099194	3099634	Well, guess what?
3099654	3102456	When I was in Canada, I went to Canada with my best friend.
3102476	3104817	That's where I was on vacation while I wasn't here on Sunday.
3105936	3108837	and we decided one day randomly we were just going to walk.
3108857	3112478	We were going to walk across this bridge, Berard Bridge, because somebody had told us it was fun.
3112498	3115879	So we walked across, ate some lunch, and we walked back and we were like, let's just keep on walking.
3116339	3125982	So we walked all the way to this place called Stanley Park, which is this huge park in Vancouver that's bigger than Central Park, and we walked the entire perimeter of Stanley Park.
3126442	3132184	Now, this whole time I'm worried that I might get a sunburn again, so I'm asking my friend John, I'm like, do I have, am I turning colors, am I turning pink?
3132204	3133424	He's like, no, you look fine, you look fine.
3133871	3138815	Well, we get back to the hotel after this walk, which, you know, the perimeter of Stanley Park is 10 kilometers.
3139155	3140857	So add into that all the other walking we did.
3140877	3143579	We probably walked more like 10 miles by the time all is said and done.
3144260	3146902	And then we get back to the hotel room, and I'm bright pink.
3147002	3148423	I'm like, John, I'm bright pink.
3148443	3149504	He's like, you didn't look pink earlier.
3149544	3151105	And I'm getting redder and redder and redder.
3151926	3154648	Oh my god, I had the world's worst summer, and it was horrible.
3154948	3159052	But, and I know this isn't more of an F you, but I will say a big thank you.
3159813	3170656	to Canada's pharmacies because they sell certain drugs in Canada you can't get here in the US and one of them is aloe vera gel with lidocaine in it which is like numbing stuff that you have to get with prescription here.
3170716	3175718	Made my sunburn feel much more bearable but still I had to miss Saturday night clubbing so I was upset with that.
3176078	3177698	Otherwise I love Canada.
3177818	3178478	I love it.
3178598	3183840	I love Vancouver and I want to go back and yeah but I wish I just had more money to travel.
3183900	3184660	Maybe I'll just move there.
3185681	3187141	I'll ditch this show and move to Canada.
3188507	3189868	Shane, do you have any angst you want to get out?
3192088	3193309	Um, no.
3194789	3197230	I don't think I'm angry about anything right now.
3198410	3198710	Alright.
3200851	3202471	Well then F you for not being angsty.
3202951	3205632	F you to me for not being angsty.
3205872	3206192	Alright.
3206512	3207032	Hooray.
3208033	3211654	Moving on with some more news back into the gaming news.
3211694	3216595	The Final Fantasy 3 DS Wi-Fi feature may have been revealed and it's
3217449	3218050	Thanks for watching!
3241351	3244512	Adventure the World with Friends or something a little more.
3244812	3252415	Maybe, now to be fair, maybe this is just one element and there's more to come, but if this is it, it's kind of weak.
3253175	3254756	I mean, I guess it's better than nothing.
3255176	3257637	It's better than nothing, but it's a little weak.
3258417	3258898	A little lame.
3260178	3260918	I'll still buy it, though.
3260938	3261339	Don't get me wrong.
3261359	3261699	I'll still buy it.
3261719	3262179	I'm all over that game.
3262199	3266160	They're going to have another game for instant messaging and another game that you have to pop in.
3266180	3267721	You're all, okay, I've got to email my friend.
3268157	3269138	in Final Fantasy 3.
3269298	3273501	Oh, I got to chat with him using Metroid Prime Hunters.
3273641	3275943	Oh, I got to... No.
3277064	3277584	It's kind of lame.
3278325	3282127	But anyways, kind of on a little bit of a different topic here.
3283008	3288372	Square Enix's president was interviewed by IGN here.
3289313	3291114	Or they have the interview on IGN, I should say.
3292072	3303618	and he was talking about basically different things, online gaming, kind of where he sees things going and a little bit about testing their games before they go out, for example.
3304278	3314224	And one of the things he says is because of the way that they have the systems now where you can patch them later on, extensive testing is not needed to release a game.
3315404	3320707	Hopefully that's not a trend we're going to start seeing where these games go out like, yeah, it's okay, I'll fix it later.
3321482	3322283	It doesn't matter if it doesn't work.
3322303	3323864	You might be out of a job, Miklatov.
3325165	3325626	Why?
3325846	3329329	Well, because if they don't need testing on the games, they're just going to patch everything.
3329569	3331871	I haven't tested a game in forever.
3331931	3333513	Oh, you're moving on up the corporate ladder now, huh?
3333533	3334574	Yeah, I'm going up the corporate ladder.
3334594	3335955	But you can't talk about what you do, huh?
3336015	3336515	No, I can't.
3336535	3336896	It's lame.
3336916	3343381	Anyways, the quote here is that game makers have until now incurred great costs during development for debugging.
3343822	3347345	He said, basically, perhaps we can reduce the cost.
3348494	3355018	and suggest that the availability of software updates, developers won't have to work so hard to find the zaniest bugs.
3356419	3362162	And Wada didn't use the word patch strictly, but, you know, that's what his translator said.
3362222	3367345	You know, I'm all for patching games to fix bugs, but at the same time, don't use that as a crutch.
3367405	3368506	I mean, if your game has a
3368971	3370452	You know, crippling bug in it.
3370492	3373293	You can't release it out there and crash people's systems.
3373593	3378375	Don't you remember, like, wasn't there bugs in some Sony game that would, like, fry your memory card or something like that?
3378395	3379195	A lot of them.
3379415	3381456	Yeah, I mean, you can't... That's not cool.
3382137	3383297	You can't just patch that.
3383337	3388599	You gotta get that out in the testing process and make sure that, you know, you're not gonna release a game that's gonna fry my memory card.
3388619	3390560	I understand, like, some things are a little different.
3390620	3393562	Like, for example, the duping glitch in Oblivion.
3393602	3396523	I mean, obviously, that's something that they couldn't have...
3397143	3399646	Found, you know, without really going through there.
3399846	3405472	And no one's saying that the games have to be perfect, but like, for example, the Jaws game that came out that was super duper glitchy.
3406141	3410924	You know, something like that where they can go back and they need to really fix before it goes out.
3411004	3416588	But if you find, like, a bug or an exploit, and even still, I say with the Oblivion exploit, leave it in there.
3416628	3417969	That's your own, you know, bug.
3418009	3419330	And if people want to use it, great.
3419350	3419830	They'll use it.
3419990	3422091	Otherwise, it's not really hurting anything.
3422111	3425353	Okay, Minkletop, you're saying more things in chat than you're saying on this show.
3425514	3426434	Share your opinion here.
3426634	3430937	Okay, my opinion is that, you know, buggy games come out all the time.
3431417	3432258	And it's not like...
3432967	3435709	Just because they're saying, oh, we'll release updates for them.
3435849	3438511	It's not like they're going to quit finding bugs or anything.
3438551	3446177	It's not like testing is going to stop because they have this new way to fix bugs that accidentally get shipped.
3446537	3449480	It's not like you're going to get a really crappy game.
3450100	3452142	Well, you are going to get a really crappy game from somebody, I'm sure.
3452662	3458607	But it's not like you're going to get one that hasn't been tested at all and there's going to be tons and tons of bugs.
3458967	3462810	Just some things happen to fall through the system sometimes.
3464634	3465054	Alright.
3465134	3466955	Like the demo disc, yeah, for Beautiful Joe 2.
3467915	3469396	Because that was really terrible.
3470216	3471076	Was that one of the culprits?
3471216	3473217	Yeah, that erased your memory card.
3473237	3474057	Yeah, okay, I remember that.
3475838	3478138	I said I never played it, thankfully, or I might have been a little upset.
3479939	3480079	Yeah.
3480928	3487211	Alright, well, you might know that the Xbox 360 had this huge shortage problem when it first came out.
3487251	3499637	Well, it's being reported that ATI and Silicon Integrated Systems have said that orders for their chips used in the Wii and the Xbox 360 are picking up in preparation for the holiday season.
3499697	3504019	So it looks like, especially hearing that the Wii's on there is a good sign.
3504039	3509402	That means Nintendo is apparently already starting to crank out these systems in preparation for their launch, but of course
3509858	3523560	Xbox 360 is not going to go another Christmas without plenty of systems on the shelves for everyone especially so they can really get out there and compete with the PlayStation 3 because you'll have a lot of folks making their final decisions this holiday season so it'll be very interesting.
3523803	3535605	Yes, and on top of that, it's also interesting that they mention that the Wii is in production because, according to a CNN Money story, they're saying that it's been in production at least since June 21st.
3536385	3547367	And considering the fact that the PlayStation 3 hasn't even begun production yet, and the 360 only had about 69 days before the sale date, that bodes well for gamers if you're looking for the Wii.
3547547	3553048	And it also means that an October or even possibly September launch is very likely.
3553992	3559414	I doubt it's going to be a September launch because they said specifically that it's going to be in the fourth quarter.
3559895	3562916	And, well, you know, September is not the fourth quarter.
3563796	3570659	And anyways, they're supposed to actually be announcing the official date and price for the Wii in September.
3570819	3573480	So until then, we'll just have to wait.
3573540	3576802	But that's more evidence that, you know, it could be coming out in October.
3578303	3593566	at least hopefully they're making it sound like there's not going to be shortages and according to what I've heard at my work we actually might get some at launch which means that there shouldn't be shortages out there because if they're giving them distribution at launch then that's a good sign.
3593746	3594507	That's a very good sign.
3594907	3599968	Now, are you still sticking to that October 18th date that you leaked out a while ago on the show?
3600368	3600688	So far.
3601248	3605689	Because in our system we had our assistant buyer change all the dates on me to...
3606922	3612585	I think they did that just because they're tired of putting different dates in there for everything.
3613125	3618227	And it's kind of what they're doing with the PS3 stuff until they find out more about that.
3618908	3622089	But all the pre-booked dates are still where they were before.
3622209	3625771	So it's still looking October from what I've seen so far.
3626031	3627912	And even if
3630802	3636266	It's gotta be October, because I know there was another story that was like Sports Illustrated for kids or whatever, saying November 6th.
3636706	3642991	I think that's too close to the PS3 launch to make it successful, and I think that they would want to launch at least a month in advance.
3643231	3645833	I think we need a friendly reminder, because we have somebody in our chatroom.
3645873	3649355	Bandit says, where does Loki work that he gets all these dates?
3649435	3651236	Is it GameStop, EB?
3651477	3652918	I don't work for GameStop or EB.
3652958	3654299	I work for a game distributor.
3654359	3656900	We sell to retail stores.
3657441	3657721	We're a
3658257	3659718	So you're one step up on the food chain.
3659778	3660219	Sort of.
3660399	3667665	GameStop and EB, they get their dates from a system that's put in by their buyers at corporate or wherever their office is.
3669026	3676171	We get our dates straight from the publishers when they give us updates every week or so.
3676552	3681516	And I look four or five times a day to see if there's a new date or a different change or anything.
3681576	3682096	And I look
3683610	3684211	Very hard.
3685251	3687273	Even then, sometimes the dates change around.
3687293	3689355	Sometimes they're wrong and sometimes I gotta fix them.
3689475	3696701	Like, for example, our purchasing people made a goof and they put Lair saying that it was on PlayStation 2 and I had to correct them.
3697142	3699263	Tell them, no, you're wrong, it's a PlayStation 3 game.
3699283	3704908	And they make goofs because they have a guy working for them that does the date entering that's kind of brand new to it.
3705028	3711774	So he messes up sometimes and puts wrong dates or maybe lists the name wrong sometimes.
3712134	3716497	But for the most part, you know, we do get our information straight from their sales staff.
3716757	3723901	And a lot of times before, you'll hear it at GameStop because, you know, their sales staff are really loose-lipped sometimes.
3724041	3728424	And they'll leak out, like, I don't know, the entire E3 lineup for Konami, for example.
3729264	3731145	Alright, I guess we brought two earlier this year.
3731726	3733507	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
3733687	3737710	Every week we like to go into the mailbag and read some emails that came to us from our listeners.
3737750	3739851	And yes, I realize DarkSakura is not here tonight.
3739911	3741232	She's usually the one that goes to the mailbag.
3741612	3744815	However, she gave me permission in her absence to go in there and pull out some letters.
3745335	3747096	So let's go to the mailbag.
3747817	3751339	And of course, you guys can always send us emails.
3751419	3755662	It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com So let me put on these
3756317	3758578	Slightly used gloves, hazmat gloves.
3758738	3759499	Dig into the mailbag.
3759559	3762261	First email comes to us from an unsigned name.
3762461	3766663	It's not signed, but the email address has Andrew in it, so I'm assuming the guy's name is Andrew.
3767604	3773547	Well, I am new here and I've only listened to one podcast, but I really enjoyed it and could tell that everyone there really knew their games.
3773907	3774168	Thank you.
3774808	3783173	The reason I sent this email was that I got a DS and so far only have Mario Kart, and I really want to know what are, in your opinion, the best games out for the DS?
3783706	3790494	and some that have a close release date so I can buy one I know that is good and see if I can get them really cheap on the net.
3790935	3791916	Any help is appreciated.
3793186	3793827	Phoenix Wright.
3794167	3795088	Oh my god, Phoenix Wright.
3795148	3797629	If you can find it, Phoenix Wright is pretty hard to find.
3797649	3798690	They're doing a reprint again.
3798710	3799891	You can go on Capcom site right now.
3799911	3801612	Capcom is selling them out pretty quick.
3801812	3804374	If you can get one at Capcom site, great.
3804394	3806896	But they're printing them as much as they can.
3807256	3810059	Because they have to print them over in Hong Kong or something like that.
3810079	3811780	And then ship them over in a batch.
3811980	3814021	And then those sell out almost instantly.
3814081	3818785	If you can't get an American one, the recently re-released Japanese one does have an English option.
3819229	3822531	And since the DS is region free, you can import that and play it.
3822571	3823632	And it's totally worth it.
3823772	3827874	I would say what you probably want to do, Tetris DS, of course.
3827934	3828755	You know, great stuff.
3828815	3829755	New Super Mario Bros.
3829856	3831877	is very popular.
3831917	3833578	If you like the old ones, I think you'll get a kick out of it.
3833598	3834378	New Super Mario Bros.
3834418	3834999	is pretty cool.
3835019	3840022	I actually want to get some of those bit generation games that are coming out on the Game Boy Advance because they look pretty cool.
3840542	3841903	I would recommend highly Meteos.
3841923	3844164	If you like puzzlers at all, definitely get your hands on Meteos.
3844224	3845025	It's still a good value.
3845745	3848047	And I think it's actually pretty cheap, you can find it out there.
3848087	3853129	I think they were doing a clear out of them at, I think, Toys R Us or something?
3853710	3856351	Yeah, it really depends what type of games you like.
3856812	3859853	But the DS has some solid hits in every genre right now.
3860334	3861334	Except racing.
3861634	3863115	What about Mario Kart?
3863135	3864656	That doesn't count, because it's fun.
3864696	3871420	Go check out the new section over at GameStop, or even go check out the bargain bins down at Toys R Us or KB...
3872370	3873991	Our second email of three tonight comes from Seth.
3874011	3876331	Hi, my name is Seth and I'm 15 and I listen to the podcast every week.
3890575	3919681	the past couple episodes you've been discussing the new laws that are being made in states such as Louisiana I think these laws are ridiculous I'm young and I play violent games I don't ever get the urge to go outside and shoot people if I played a Harry Potter game which I don't I wouldn't go outside with my mom's broom and jump off the roof because I think I can fly I believe that the government is just trying to find an excuse for why kids are going out and shooting up their schools thanks for having such a great show I listen to OLR every week well thanks for the kind words hey you know what
3921035	3921958	Pretty smart kid there.
3923443	3927136	With the Harry Potter reference, that's a pretty interesting comparison there.
3927858	3931580	Exactly, and I mean, look at, what was it, that movie, The Boy Who Could Fly?
3932021	3934863	Did he have, like, a high, you know, rate of suicides after that movie?
3934883	3936884	Because, I mean, he jumped off his roof and started flying.
3937264	3939366	You know, did we see kids, you know, just trying to kill themselves?
3939386	3941647	Well, now, kids do imitate, try to imitate the movie sometimes, though.
3941667	3951574	Like, remember, I'm trying to think, what was that one where, like, it had a scene where people were lying down in the middle of the road, and some kids tried to imitate that, and of course got run over, and then they, like, re-released the movie with that scene edited?
3951594	3951674	Yeah.
3952558	3953759	It was years ago, God.
3954039	3955801	I know what you're talking about.
3956261	3956922	It's stupid.
3958143	3959244	It's just media in general.
3959264	3962406	They want to blame media because, obviously, it's not the parents' fault.
3962686	3964828	Never the parents' fault.
3965989	3968991	I think they're starting to get it, but they're just not quite.
3970092	3977118	Especially, this is only going to be brought up again once Scarface comes out, once Reservoir Dogs comes out.
3977458	3981642	This fourth quarter is really bad when it comes to this whole violent game thing.
3983632	3990276	All right, let's go to our last email tonight, which comes to us from GrinWithoutACat.
3991157	3993779	This must be like a ShazireCat type thing.
3993859	3994519	That's a pretty cool name.
3995300	3995700	Hi, guys.
3995720	3997721	I've been listening to the podcast for a couple months now.
3997781	4005106	I'm in the UK, so it's a little bit late for me to stay up to listen live, as some brave soul did the other week, but I look forward to each download.
4005647	4010830	I wanted to respond to what the PMS and FragDoll clans had to say about the beauty pageant at the gaming event,
4010970	4011631	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4029821	4031302	The word hypocrites comes to mind.
4032203	4037188	Also, GrimWithoutACat goes on to say, I think an OLR gaming group is a great idea.
4037548	4044775	I'm planning to get a 360 in September as I'm really interested in live and making my gaming experiences more sociable, but I keep hearing enjoyment of live...
4047932	4048373	Relays?
4048473	4049614	I think that's a misspelled word there.
4049654	4051736	Live games on a good friend's list.
4052176	4054378	And all my gaming friends are PC-only gamers.
4054498	4055239	Relays, I think.
4055259	4056340	That's what it was supposed to be.
4056560	4057641	Oh, I was just reading it wrong.
4057681	4061043	Okay, but I keep hearing enjoyment of live relies on a good friend's list.
4061083	4061364	Thank you.
4061704	4063826	And all my gaming friends are PC-only gamers.
4064126	4067769	So to have a group of friendly faces to ease me into online gaming would be welcome.
4069110	4072313	On the second point there, I can say, I love this.
4072373	4074715	If you go to the forums, there's like a thread that
4074994	4075274	Counter-Strike
4093394	4095555	I don't know, in some mod or something.
4095976	4100859	And it's really funny because if you look at the picture, the screenshot somebody took, the gun is pointed right at your face, Loki.
4100879	4101199	It's great.
4102660	4103860	But then, no, I thought this was cool too.
4103880	4109384	I guess there's a Guild Wars clan as well, and somebody just posted a picture of their cape, and it's like an orange cape.
4109804	4116008	And they couldn't really put their own logo on it, but they put something that looked like Sakura blossoms on it for Dark Sakura.
4116128	4116348	Get it?
4117038	4117918	I thought that's cute.
4118099	4118559	I love it.
4118659	4119859	Our listeners are so awesome.
4119979	4123320	So check out that thread on our forums and you can find some gamers.
4123340	4125321	There's even an Xbox Live Gamer Tag Exchange.
4125641	4127202	And I even give out my gamer tag.
4127222	4127582	I don't care.
4127622	4129763	My gamer tag is on there and I have a bunch of friends.
4130503	4133064	Sadly enough, I am paying for live, but I don't really play over live.
4133584	4133924	I don't get it.
4134285	4135045	I do once in a while.
4135506	4138608	Yeah, I really need to get down to... I'll play Halo 3 when it's out for sure.
4138628	4141350	It's just I don't really have that many good games that I want to play.
4141410	4144052	Like, Burnout, even over live, I don't really care for it that much.
4144072	4144953	I thought Burnout was fun.
4144993	4147155	I'm just not good at it, so it doesn't give me incentive to play.
4147335	4148676	I want to play Chromehounds over live.
4148716	4149557	I think that'd be fun.
4149577	4157883	Because Chromehounds is actually going to allow you to do clans, so I think that's something that they really need because, I don't know, you don't really have that over live.
4157903	4159064	All right.
4159739	4161041	Thank you guys so much for the emails.
4161061	4161802	We really appreciate it.
4161822	4164086	If you guys want to send us an email as well, you can always do that.
4164126	4167151	It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
4168253	4172419	Also, we started a new segment last week called the Voicemails of the Week.
4172499	4174843	We wanted to try something a little different using our Skype line.
4175131	4180395	And we invited you guys to send us some voicemails in regards to a particular topic.
4180976	4187060	And some of you guys called in about the topic, but one of the voicemails we're going to play tonight has nothing to do with the topic at hand, but it's still kind of funny, so we'll play it.
4187601	4192765	And I was very overwhelmed with the response when I went in there to go look.
4193125	4195246	I'll tell you guys off air how much we got.
4195286	4195787	It was pretty cool.
4196007	4196547	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4225077	4232519	Hello Orange Lounge Radio, this is the all-infamous Fury Lover answering your question of the voicemail of the week.
4233099	4242781	I actually pre-order certain games that I would like to buy that I know would get, uh, that would be sold out.
4243581	4252983	And I think the advantages of actually pre-ordering games are, um, are actually quite good because, uh, if you pre-order a game from
4253666	4261968	Trusted sources like GameStop or EB Games, you know you'll have the game when it comes out or whenever you want to get it.
4262509	4269811	But pre-ordering games from things like FYE and stuff like that is just...
4271207	4271648	Horrible.
4272068	4274070	So yeah, that's all I have to say.
4274270	4274711	Thank you.
4274931	4275211	Bye.
4275391	4276532	Thanks for the voicemail, Yuri Lover.
4276973	4280516	I think it's interesting because it sounds like he trusts some stores but he doesn't trust others.
4280696	4286342	And it's true because some stores I think actually do buy direct from the publishers and some don't.
4286482	4291547	So they might get them late or might not get them at all or they're relying on some other source to get them.
4291707	4293248	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4317626	4318747	I'm not as interested in that game.
4318787	4321509	I might pick it up, but I'm much more interested in XII.
4321549	4323091	Dirt Disturbance isn't really Final Fantasy.
4323131	4325072	I mean, sure, it's Vincent, but it's not really Final Fantasy.
4325212	4331838	You know, having a modded PS2 really opens the options for me as far as where I can get that game.
4332618	4334720	Alright, let's go to our next voicemail.
4335901	4336622	Hello, OLR.
4336642	4338523	This is Razorburn2021.
4338884	4341506	Your question, I believe, was about pre-ordering games and...
4342290	4346532	If I don't have to, I try not to pre-order games.
4347252	4359137	I believe there was an argument that I'd read a year or two, something like that ago, in the arcade about the problems with pre-ordering games is that that's kind of how game stores gauge what they should stock.
4359377	4366160	And you talked about games like Point Blank DS that are difficult to find, and that's because generally no one pre-orders them.
4366520	4369142	So if I don't have to, I try not to.
4369282	4370182	I don't recommend it.
4371315	4377879	I don't generally have to pre-order movies, I don't generally have to pre-order CDs or several other things that I like to buy.
4378019	4381581	I would just like if I could go into a game store and purchase what I want to.
4382341	4383321	I appreciate your show.
4383622	4384282	Have a good day.
4384844	4385544	Thanks for the voicemail.
4385564	4391727	I think that was an interesting one because he gives a good argument for why you should pre-order games, but then says he doesn't do it.
4391767	4397649	But I like that he gave the kind of comparison there about the I don't pre-order movies or CDs.
4398709	4402391	I seem to recall though, I seem to remember a day where you could pre-order CDs.
4402771	4404472	Who buys CDs anymore anyway?
4404492	4406514	Why would you need to pre-order them?
4406794	4409356	I actually do buy CDs.
4409476	4410137	I use iTunes.
4410177	4412299	I'm glad the internet's there.
4412479	4421666	I do every now and then like going into a CD store like Tower and going through their dance section or their import section and just listening to what they've got.
4421906	4423848	A lot of times it's hard to find stuff.
4424088	4426150	That's kind of why I turn to the internet because...
4426837	4438434	You can't find something because it was only on a single vinyl, and I'm not going to buy a $10 record, even though I do have two turntables I don't ever use.
4438735	4439275	A microphone?
4440417	4440637	Huh?
4440798	4441098	Forget it.
4442825	4445226	Hey, this is Makran, and
4468129	4474334	I was just listening to the podcast that I got during iTunes and the poos.
4474574	4484762	Now, I'm not sure if you all got your thoughts together in a complete box together in this area enough.
4485082	4493148	Could you elaborate on your feelings about the gayest name of a video game accessory and or console ever created?
4494109	4494549	That's it.
4494750	4495050	Bye.
4496328	4498189	Gayest name of a video game accessory.
4498289	4500289	That's a random question.
4500549	4503470	Well, did you hear about the Tekken butt plug, actually?
4503550	4503911	That's easy.
4503931	4506791	The Rez Transfibrator.
4506831	4508672	The Rez Transfibrator, of course.
4508832	4509993	The Transfibrator is...
4512717	4515579	I think it's someone that was on E when they figured out that one.
4516000	4517981	Dude, it vibrates with the music.
4518021	4520043	That's awesome.
4520283	4523085	It feels totally good when I'm on E and I'm touching it.
4523225	4528369	You know, a week later and I still don't believe that Pooh's thing that they're going to call the Sony controller the Pooh's.
4528449	4529270	That's a load of crap.
4529290	4530951	That's a load of Pooh is what it is.
4531131	4531631	I don't buy it.
4533942	4538226	If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, and I weep for Sony, because that's, I mean, God.
4538946	4545312	We have been kicking, I mean, the gaming community has been kicking those guys non-stop since E3, and this is just another, like, oh my God.
4546613	4550536	If they called it the poos, that would be the candy sprinkles on the icing of the cake.
4550576	4551717	I mean, that's all it would really be.
4551777	4555841	You don't need it, but it's there, and you gotta appreciate it.
4555941	4560385	So, I don't think it's gonna matter what they call the controller, because...
4561172	4561612	Thank you for watching.
4561632	4562113	See you next time.
4581698	4586921	And if you could use your finger, I mean, hypothetically, you could use, you know what, forget wherever that thought's going.
4587541	4589102	I think that's it for the voicemails of the week.
4589843	4599328	Overall, though, it seems like you guys, the kind of general consensus I was getting from the voicemails is that you guys prefer pre-ordering for certain games, but not everything.
4599988	4602610	Thank you guys for your voicemails, and sorry to those folks we didn't get around to.
4602990	4604831	If you would like to leave us this voicemail, please do.
4604871	4606931	The number is 916-226-9067.
4608472	4610472	But remember, that may be a toll call.
4610512	4614433	So please, if you don't pay the bills, ask whoever does their permission first.
4615073	4618574	Or use a cell phone because a lot of times they get free long distance.
4618815	4620495	But make sure it does before you call.
4621695	4623356	Again, if you're not paying the bill, you better ask.
4624276	4625056	Or you can use Skype.
4625096	4628117	You can call us on Orange Launch Radio at Skype anytime when we're not live.
4628157	4629418	And you also get the voicemail that way.
4629458	4630958	And I think we did get a couple voicemails that way.
4631538	4636120	The question we have for you guys, you know we want your opinions on this, the whole Sony billboard controversy.
4636540	4637340	What do you guys think of that?
4637580	4640501	I mean, is it being overblown?
4640782	4642322	Do people have a right to be upset?
4642422	4644303	Was it in good taste, bad taste?
4644603	4645983	What do you think of that whole controversy?
4646003	4647644	I'd love to hear from you guys on that one.
4647964	4650505	And we'll play some of our favorite voicemails next week.
4651205	4652126	Meanwhile, back to the news.
4652726	4655847	Yes, and speaking about strange stuff.
4657165	4664650	DOA's, I can't even pronounce his name, but Itagaki, that's right.
4665691	4667212	This is why I'm not Japanese.
4667332	4672976	Anyways, he admits to being quite intoxicated while creating DOA4.
4674057	4678620	And he's all pretty much, I'm drinking pretty much full time.
4678980	4685265	Of course, there are ups and downs, waves of how I drink in terms of the amount, but it's long periods of time.
4686798	4693699	In the last 10 years, not that you asked this question, I think I had better ideas when I was drinking whiskey.
4694620	4701381	When I'm drinking shochu, that's a conservative drink, so the ideas are not that great.
4701741	4707622	Beer is just like water to me, so it helps me and everything else loosen up a bit.
4708162	4711203	It doesn't really contribute to coming up with ideas.
4712478	4715159	Everything is explained on why there was a Dead or Alive volleyball game now.
4715560	4716300	Everything is explained.
4717220	4719261	Because most people, when they heard that, were like, what?
4720202	4720702	That explains it.
4720742	4721743	It also explains why.
4721963	4723824	Come on, that guy is such a rock star.
4724064	4727886	I mean, seriously, when you look at pictures of him and see him in interviews, he's just a freaking rock star.
4727926	4730627	I mean, he's like the Tommy Lee of game designs, right?
4730687	4734229	You know he's the type of person that probably thrashes hotel rooms.
4734571	4739875	Setser with a fat cigar in his mouth while he's probably, you know, designing games and stuff.
4739895	4741216	It's no surprise to me that he's in it.
4741236	4751404	Now I kind of wish that Weeble was kind of like handling DOA, the movie, because if it got, you know, all fucked up, this guy could come beat the crap out of him, Japanese style.
4751424	4752765	Break a bottle over his head.
4753365	4754546	Exactly.
4755026	4758949	He should put himself in the next DOA game, because that would be awesome.
4759069	4761351	I would love to play him in DOA.
4761711	4763833	That might sell another copy of the game for me.
4765362	4766483	I haven't played DOA 4, it was fun.
4787688	4788769	You'll probably enjoy this.
4789549	4791950	The Bob Ross game that's coming out.
4792850	4795432	Bob Ross Interactive is actually having a contest right now.
4795472	4803936	It started on July 4th, and they are accepting work, but only those that are created using Bob Ross' patented wet-on-wet technique.
4804596	4805536	Why are you giggling?
4805917	4807357	Because that was funny sounding.
4807797	4810959	Here's the wet-on-wet technique for those who haven't watched the show.
4810999	4814320	You put a base coat of their paint on it, and then you...
4816170	4816490	Happy Trees
4839463	4842584	and I believe you can actually visit www.bobross.com for more of the details.
4842624	4843304	Bob Ross, beyond grave.
4867648	4869350	Oh yeah.
4869390	4874034	Anyways, speaking of stuff that's, I don't know, dead.
4875415	4880880	The PSP security on the firmware, that's pretty much dead.
4881460	4883402	Because, now you can downgrade.
4883762	4886124	Again, if you happen to own a 2.6 or 2.7
4889217	4890377	2.5 or 2.6 firmware.
4890838	4891398	That's right, folks.
4891418	4892279	You can downgrade.
4892859	4894140	Gradius upgraded me to 2.6.
4895141	4895961	Yeah.
4896082	4900325	Well, Grand Theft Auto was probably one of the ones that got you to 2.5.
4900565	4901485	2.6 for me was Katamari.
4901806	4908490	But they have decrypted 2.5 and 2.6, and now there is a downgrader.
4908991	4914435	And actually, if you visit PSP Updates, they have tons of different downgraders that you can get to do that, including...
4915492	4916293	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4936894	4939336	Why don't they just get the homebrew to work on 2.6?
4941098	4941518	They have.
4941598	4942159	Okay, good.
4942479	4943140	They have that.
4943180	4947824	They also have this thing where you can actually run... I haven't been following PSP hacking for a while.
4947844	4951287	You can run 1.5, and it will give you the features of 2.5.
4951407	4956691	So you have the RSS features, the web browser, and you can play 2.5 games on there.
4956751	4958793	Wi-Fi doesn't quite work well, though, with that.
4959214	4961115	But still kind of neat that they're doing it.
4961496	4962777	And, you know...
4963925	4964465	I don't know.
4965246	4967287	I don't really follow the Homebrew stuff as much anymore.
4967307	4969329	Do they have a Nintendo emulator for 2.6 firmware?
4970469	4972170	It's basically anything works with 2.6.
4972291	4973271	Interesting.
4973431	4977974	Although, the thing with 2.6 is you have to have Grand Theft Auto in order to do all these workarounds.
4978054	4985359	So, yeah, you may want to downgrade or something or just don't play emulators on there because whatever.
4986000	4987260	Get a DS for that.
4987801	4989122	There's a lot of stuff for that.
4989562	4992364	But there's not... I can't play Kid Icarus on my DS yet.
4993536	4993836	But I don't!
4993856	4994177	But I don't!
5014285	5015206	You can use this game.
5015406	5017007	It's basically Step Mania for the PSP.
5017367	5022651	So if you do end up downgrading to 1.5, check out PSP Revolution version 0.2.
5023011	5026333	That would be really fun to play on a handheld.
5026894	5029335	And they've added... DDR on the Game Boy is stupid.
5029375	5029635	I'm sorry.
5029696	5030556	There's no way around it.
5030576	5036980	They've added theme support and arrow speed modifiers as well as AUG music files are now supported.
5037981	5038121	And...
5039582	5042028	Yeah, marathon songs and all that sort of stuff.
5042108	5048043	So check it out if you're really interested in Step Mania on your PSP.
5050146	5052247	All right, well, completely changing gears here.
5052287	5056849	We haven't talked a whole lot about Microsoft tonight because, you know, Xbox 360, it's out.
5057049	5062032	There's not a lot, you know, and it's got their games coming out, so we don't have quite the rumors that we have with Sony and Nintendo.
5062072	5064973	However, Microsoft does have some rumors of their own.
5066094	5074558	It's been reported by Bloomberg that Microsoft may be working on an iPod killer that's supposed to hit shelves this Christmas.
5075498	5075758	Quote,
5104870	5116594	You can assume that, especially with, I would say, that whole Xbox Live Anywhere thing that's going to be on the cell phones and all that, this might play into that or something else.
5116774	5119956	I would say maybe Xbox Live Arcade stuff.
5119996	5120536	Possibly.
5120936	5122297	Possibly, so don't count it out.
5122357	5124058	I mean, if this whole thing is true to me.
5124078	5127761	They do have Xbox Live Arcade for the PC as well, I mean, so.
5128321	5133865	And if you ever visit zone.msn.com, I think it is, The Zone, they have gaming badges.
5134086	5137128	It's set up very similar to how Xbox Live works.
5137188	5138569	It's very interesting, so.
5138953	5139093	MSN
5166417	5174341	You know, I almost see them doing something like the Nomad for the original Xbox in something like this.
5174381	5181705	That's kind of where I'm seeing this going, is maybe like a portable Xbox, like an original one where it plays the old Xbox games.
5181745	5185127	So they don't really have to make new games, but I don't know.
5185227	5189269	I think it might be a little late to do something like that, but I thought.
5189529	5195412	GK128 in our chatroom says, It figures Microsoft is coming out with a Super MP3 player just as I bought a fancy new one.
5197111	5200236	Don't worry, Apple put out the video iPods like a week after I bought mine.
5201204	5201865	Yeah, jerks.
5202285	5209590	Well, something that's definitely going to be implemented with probably this is going to be some sort of e-distribution, especially of music and movies.
5210030	5217675	But of course, Sony is talking about doing games because their first priority, of course, is games with the PS3, right?
5217815	5227602	Anyways, so they're definitely talking about doing something to the sense of Xbox Live's marketplace where you can be able to download arcade-type games.
5228022	5234287	Games, and according to an article that was on Gamasutra, definitely something that they're going to be doing.
5234607	5240432	Certainly being able to sell growably online makes it easier to reach international and remote markets.
5240952	5244795	On the business side, it also lowers the cost of sales and eliminates inventory risk.
5244915	5247777	It should help curtail used game sales and piracy.
5248598	5253381	I don't like the whole used game sales thing, but I can understand the piracy, I guess.
5254062	5255523	Something tells me that's not going to work.
5255834	5256254	DarkSakura,
5279605	5280385	You shouldn't be doing that.
5280465	5301931	But anyways, so yeah, definitely they're going to be doing something probably similar to, actually, I'm thinking putting on PlayStation 1 games to be able to download straight to the hard drive, being that the size of the files should be a lot smaller, and they're also going to be doing something similar with the PSP, so if they can do it on the PSP, they can definitely do it on the PS3, so that's kind of a given.
5302351	5308773	And also, maybe even later on down the lines, being able to stream all, you know, real PS3 games, so...
5310290	5311651	Something that they're interested in.
5311691	5313392	What's kind of interesting, though, is their comment here.
5313432	5313652	Oh, really?
5313672	5314192	So, I don't know.
5334318	5335439	All right, we'll see how that goes.
5336799	5338280	But I do have something real quick.
5338340	5338601	Oh, sure.
5339221	5345545	The PlayStation Beyond site that launched during Game Developers Conference this year, and you always see this Play Beyond thing.
5345585	5347986	How much do you want to bet that they're calling their marketplace Beyond?
5349007	5349607	Just a thought.
5350788	5351608	That's an interesting thought.
5352849	5353689	Because that's a big game.
5353769	5355050	It makes sense.
5355070	5356211	Maybe it'll all tie together in the end.
5357391	5362255	Anyway, changing gears here, Empire Interactive, been some rumblings out of there this week.
5362655	5366898	The Flat Out franchise is going to be coming to the Xbox 360.
5366958	5369059	It's called Flat Out Total Carnage.
5369359	5373302	And for those of you guys not familiar with this series, it originally came out July last year.
5373903	5379667	It's got destructible cars, kind of like a racing game, and of course scenery, and it's got sadistic minigames inside it.
5379947	5386051	You go into barriers at high speed, you eject the driver to hit targets like a giant dartboard or bowling pins.
5387392	5389373	I've never heard you talk about this game.
5389714	5391575	I played it last year when it first came out.
5391955	5394837	It's a pretty fun game.
5395317	5399220	This year they rebuilt the whole game from the ground up, so it's a lot better, a lot faster.
5399500	5402101	It seems like a cross between Burnout and Destruction Derby.
5402721	5406902	And you also have a whole ton of mini-games called the Ragdoll Olympics type stuff.
5407303	5410023	And you can basically eject your driver out.
5410284	5412164	One, for example, is baseball.
5412484	5420387	And you eject your driver out, and he flies up towards this giant baseball bat and is smacked with the baseball bat, and you fling his body into a mitt.
5421525	5422366	I can tell you this much.
5422386	5423747	That sounds so stupid but fun.
5423767	5427751	You can play these mini games and they will keep you entertained for hours.
5428291	5429272	Especially you.
5429292	5432234	You probably sat there and giggled for like an hour.
5432294	5432935	Oh, yes I did.
5433476	5439201	I played the high jump, like, I don't know, for at least a half an hour just like looking at the thing.
5439421	5440001	And it was fun.
5440061	5441142	It's a pretty fun game.
5441182	5442383	This one looks a lot better.
5442463	5443564	Flat Out 2 is coming out.
5443744	5444165	That's right.
5444385	5446407	Xbox, PC, and PlayStation 2.
5447304	5449532	Yeah, I think I'm the... August 1st.
5449693	5450074	This fall.
5450115	5450877	Well, they're saying this fall.
5450917	5451520	August 1st.
5451540	5452242	They're wrong.
5452684	5453166	Oh, we'll see.
5455023	5462328	Empire Interactive is coming out with a PSP version of Taito Legends and is also working on a version of Ford Street Racing for the PSP as well.
5462548	5464109	Ooh, goody, Ford Street Racing.
5464189	5466010	That's just such an awesome game.
5466651	5467271	I haven't played it.
5467391	5468172	Don't really have an opinion on it.
5468212	5473635	Lame-o is what you might call that game, but yeah.
5474556	5478458	Anyway, something that's not quite as lame as Ford Street Racing there.
5480039	5483242	Zelda is actually... There's a homebrew Zelda.
5484195	5486542	for mobile phones, and they're calling it Zelda.
5487947	5491749	That's kind of funny because when you think of Zelda, you think of Wind Waker.
5491969	5493830	Or Phantom Hourglass, even.
5493850	5501534	Well, it's funny you should mention that because they actually are using the Minish Cap graphics, so it kind of looks a little bit like Wind Waker.
5502655	5505156	And sort of, you know, Wind Waker and Zelda.
5505216	5508958	I thought Minish Cap looked more like the old school Super Nintendo one.
5508978	5511059	Yeah, it kind of... But here's a few things.
5511079	5512180	Too bad it wasn't as fun.
5512740	5515362	But anyways, there's actually, you know...
5516102	5517743	Some pretty impressive graphics on there.
5518883	5522944	They have the latest demo, which is working on M.I.D.P.2 compatible phones.
5524205	5527186	There's actually a way you can check it out to see if you have it or not.
5528166	5530507	A compatible phone, a lot of them out there.
5530547	5533108	I don't even know how the hell to put this on my phone, to be honest.
5534328	5537830	If you're interested, though, they also have a PC version.
5538790	5539590	It should be interesting.
5539630	5544332	If you want to check and see what kind of phone you have, if it'll work, there's a website.
5544592	5544712	It's
5545592	5552353	rumkin.com slash tools slash sprint slash index.php rumplestillskin.com
5557536	5558616	I'll check that out.
5558636	5560377	That's a cell phone game I might be able to get into.
5560737	5561478	Oh, actually, I'm sorry.
5561518	5571783	This is the website, jbenchmark.com slash phonedetails.jsp and that'll let you know what kind of phone you have and if it supports that.
5572323	5573103	So that's kind of neat.
5573584	5576365	And the PC version I'm kind of willing to check out and I'm
5577168	5579249	I believe his website has gone down since
5598720	5599221	Check it out.
5599421	5600503	They have some screenshots.
5600563	5601885	It looks pretty sweet.
5602025	5604989	And you can download the PC and the mobile version for that.
5605069	5605570	Very cool.
5605790	5607573	Just a matter of time before Nintendo shuts them down, right?
5608114	5609696	Why doesn't Nintendo get into cell phone gaming?
5609716	5609936	I know I...
5611431	5612352	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5638130	5640512	But I was somewhat pleased.
5640552	5649018	It's still not as good as a Game Boy Advance version of it, but, you know, I'm... Now, this homebrew version is actually a remake of number one.
5649578	5651279	Right, yeah, I'd heard that, that it was a remake of number one.
5651299	5651760	That's pretty cool.
5652260	5654201	All right, one other quick story on mobile gaming.
5654241	5654842	This is interesting.
5655862	5661286	Now, you know that women in gaming don't get a whole lot of coverage sometimes.
5661306	5664628	It's a controversial subject, you know, are they really into games, da-da-da-da-da.
5665149	5665349	But...
5665802	5668744	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5691007	5692688	because they don't know what a good game is.
5722388	5722788	Interesting.
5724029	5724370	I don't know.
5724850	5725631	Why do you think that is?
5725711	5736760	Just because, you know, cell phone games are easy to pick up or that maybe the games they put out on cell phones tend to be more puzzle games, pop cap type of games that reach the non-gamer in general.
5736860	5739122	Not just women, but the non-gamer in general.
5739502	5742905	Because, you know, obviously not all women are non-gamers.
5742965	5746888	We have one that co-hosts this show and, you know, we're talking about, you know,
5747861	5753025	Plus those cell phone games are very simple, so then women can understand them.
5753045	5754446	Well, it's not just one, but the non-gamer.
5754807	5755167	Women.
5755407	5755867	Whatever.
5757108	5757969	Hate mail coming in.
5758229	5759951	You can address those cards and letters to Shane.
5760791	5762413	He doesn't have an Orange Tantra to account, though.
5762433	5764074	We won't give him one after that, that's for sure.
5766316	5767056	You know what's interesting, though?
5767076	5771680	I was mentioning before Nintendo will probably shut that Zelda thing down, but they're really not in cell phone gaming.
5772020	5776444	And it seems like if Nintendo's trying to make this real, you know, we want to reach all the non-gamers...
5777111	5780112	This should be evidence to them that maybe they ought to get into mobile gaming.
5780152	5786755	And I, again, am not a big fan of mobile gaming, but I would think it would be kind of cool if I could play Ice Climber on my cell phone or something.
5786876	5787116	Maybe.
5787276	5788276	I don't know.
5789277	5789997	What do you guys think?
5791001	5794365	We're going to open up the Skype line right now if you guys want to call in on any subject really.
5794405	5798050	If you have a question or comment or whatever you want to say, our Skype line is open.
5798070	5801234	For more information, go to www.orangeloungeradio.com.
5801254	5802555	Click on Interact With Us.
5803016	5805659	Or you can always give us a call on our normal phone line.
5805699	5805880	It's 916-226-9067.
5809003	5813624	Remember, kids, that it might be a toll call if you don't live next door to us.
5814725	5817705	Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, do you have any quick last-minute stories, anybody?
5819266	5819766	Uh, no.
5820186	5823167	But, um, I don't know, I think this is kind of interesting.
5823547	5835030	I was trying to look up and see what my phone had, but unfortunately, I am stupid, and I don't know what kind of... I know I have a Samsung phone, but the model number is... something I don't know.
5835410	5837771	And so, yeah, that makes it tough.
5838986	5840607	GK128 My grandmother lives off of shitty pogo games.
5840627	5842308	Their simplicity and fun to non-gamers is the draw.
5842328	5845390	If Nintendo wants women to get into gaming, they need to come out with a vacuum controller.
5845450	5846151	You guys are horrible.
5867853	5869374	We're only speaking the truth.
5870475	5876580	The views and opinions expressed by Miklatov are not necessarily those of the rest of us.
5876620	5878462	Anyway, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5878502	5878922	Who's this?
5879883	5884227	You should know by now who it is as much as I call every single week.
5884327	5886168	I know, we get the same callers every week.
5886408	5888370	You know, I have to say this though, callers.
5889571	5894055	I lurk sometimes on some message forums that people don't know I lurk on.
5894930	5897817	and I saw some people talking smack about Orange Lounge Radio.
5900142	5901805	You know what they say the weak point of the show is?
5903349	5904231	The call-in segments.
5906047	5910510	So, you know, we open up this show to folks to call in because we want it to be your show.
5910550	5912971	We don't want to be here and be all, oh, we're better than you, da-da-da.
5912991	5914432	We want this to be your show as well.
5915033	5918395	But I just want you guys to know, people on the interweb are talking shit about you.
5918475	5919035	But it's okay.
5919055	5921997	They talk shit about DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all the time as well.
5922037	5922698	So what can you do?
5923018	5923318	Fuck them.
5923438	5924939	It's okay because I got your back, so.
5925119	5925379	I know.
5925559	5926220	You'll protect us.
5926340	5927080	What's on your mind, Ranma?
5927941	5928401	Not much.
5928421	5930022	There's a couple of things I want to talk about.
5930122	5932884	Now, as you brought up about people talking smack,
5933502	5938565	I remember from Anime Next they had a group there called otakugeneration.net doing a podcast.
5938965	5942167	They gave me their card and I said, hey, have you heard of Orange Dogs Radio?
5942488	5946470	And one of the guys said, yeah, I've heard of them, but their show isn't all that good.
5946730	5949792	So I was like, well, I am close friends with the staff.
5950393	5950993	He did a 180.
5951053	5952374	I'm like, oh, their show is great.
5952394	5953194	They're awesome.
5953435	5953855	Don't hurt me.
5957321	5958683	You know what, though?
5958703	5962128	I don't think indie podcasters should be bashing on each other.
5962268	5963349	I don't think it's a smart move.
5963409	5965613	I think the indie podcasters should be coming together.
5966594	5967896	I've never listened to that program.
5967936	5969358	I don't know anybody over that program.
5970139	5970460	Whatever.
5970480	5972102	I have nothing bad to say about them because I wouldn't.
5972402	5974883	If I did have something bad to say about them, I wouldn't say it at all.
5975183	5981786	Because I think indie podcasters have to work together because we have to work against corporate dollars and all this corporate stuff.
5982046	5985488	Which, by the way, reminds me about the whole podcast awards thing.
5985508	5987769	The nominations are open right now for the podcast awards.
5988889	6015209	PodcastWords.com obviously we would love it if you would consider nominating us again in the gaming podcast category but honestly guys as long as an independent podcaster wins it I'm happy and across the board and I encourage you to nominate other independent podcasters in the other categories as well this is how we get the word of mouth out and I think independent podcasters should be working on promoting each other not cutting each other down because then that's when the corporates will just sneak through and win
6015709	6021957	I have plenty of bad things I can say about corporate podcasts, but I try not to be negative.
6022017	6022879	Anyway, sorry.
6023339	6023760	Tangent.
6024020	6024340	My bad.
6024381	6024801	Your call.
6024841	6025402	It's okay.
6026023	6027344	Send me a bunch of cards.
6027605	6028946	Otacon is like in a month.
6029047	6029848	I'll pass them out.
6030128	6030428	All right.
6031069	6033773	And if there's any haters, I want you to cut them for me.
6034525	6034905	Of course.
6035205	6036245	Alright, what else is on your mind, Ranma?
6036845	6040966	Okay, there's a couple of things I spoke with Jamie about that I didn't get to tell you guys.
6041086	6046888	Now, there was talk some time back about older Super NES games that you had a load time.
6047368	6048688	And one of them was Street Fighter Alpha 2.
6048868	6050328	Oh, okay.
6050368	6053869	Now, there's another game I remember renting from the video store.
6054029	6055629	It was Batman Returns.
6055829	6059930	Every time you went to the next level, it went to black and it said, now loading.
6060190	6062111	Two minutes later, I'm in the next level.
6062251	6062831	For real?
6063604	6063804	Yes.
6064324	6067066	Wow, I thought I played the Batman Returns game too.
6067106	6068947	Wasn't that like a Final Fight type game?
6069688	6073150	Sort of, but it was like really stick figure-ish like Streak of Rage.
6073930	6074170	Huh.
6076011	6076432	Interesting.
6076672	6080154	Well, I mean, it wasn't, again, it was one of those movie franchise games that wasn't that great.
6080774	6083115	Most movie franchise games kind of suck.
6083436	6085177	Most, but there are, you know, some that stand out.
6085197	6087238	But anyway, okay, well that's,
6087901	6088821	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6112981	6114062	Parasol Stars.
6114602	6115563	Oh!
6115583	6118045	TurboGrafx-16, baby!
6118085	6119506	Yeah, I've played Parasol Stars.
6119546	6121828	I keep forgetting that's technically in the Bubble Bobble world.
6122169	6124991	No, they had a version of Parasol Stars, I want to say, on Nintendo as well.
6125071	6126292	It was crap, but it was there.
6126973	6127673	Are you serious?
6127833	6128554	I want to say.
6128634	6128954	I don't know.
6129555	6132077	It might have been one of those really bad Asian hacks.
6132097	6137461	You know they're releasing Bubble Bobble Revolution and Rainbow Islands Revolution for the DS pretty soon.
6138682	6139803	Must have this now.
6139823	6139903	What?
6142731	6144933	As long as Parasol Stars is in there, I'll buy it.
6145113	6145314	I know.
6145414	6145894	It's not.
6146515	6148257	I wish they would put these games in as unlocks.
6148277	6152281	That's why I made sad faces when Salamander wasn't in the Gradius Collections.
6152301	6154783	You guys know it as Life Force if you don't deal with the importance.
6154803	6155484	I love Life Force.
6155524	6156825	Yeah, that's like one of the best ones.
6156865	6158067	It's not in the collection.
6158087	6158487	Yes, I agree.
6158527	6158907	Sad.
6159693	6166897	Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami
6183717	6189559	Okay, Loki, you talked about last week how the anime video games aren't doing as successful as expected.
6189899	6191380	I can tell you one of the reasons why.
6192900	6206785	One of the reasons is because some of these games are already being played on import at anime cons, and then when these companies bring them over, the main thing that the fans complain about, they want the Japanese voices, and they are originally taken out.
6206986	6209707	They take them all out, and the fans don't really want to buy them.
6209887	6210827	Well, stop doing that.
6213098	6215180	That's what they do in Soul Calibur.
6215200	6216241	You can pick between the two.
6217042	6218383	I love that, especially Toshinden 3.
6218423	6219904	That's one of my all-time favorites.
6221366	6225489	I mean, I got Naruto, but Ninja, and I'm dealing with half the voices.
6225509	6226270	I'm like, come on.
6226490	6231715	When they did that half-assed Inuyasha fighting game, you had the option of Japanese and English voices.
6231955	6235558	I mean, when they did the 2D fighter from PS1, they threw us a bone.
6235598	6236199	I'm like, come on.
6236299	6236980	Let's go for it.
6237000	6237380	All right.
6237768	6239049	Well, Ranma, this call's running long.
6239069	6239869	We've got to let you go, buddy.
6239909	6240849	We want to get some other folks in.
6240869	6241810	But thank you so much for the call.
6241850	6242330	Have a good one, okay?
6242350	6242710	Hey, no problem.
6242770	6243991	I kind of took up most of your time.
6244031	6244611	I apologize.
6245011	6245392	No problem.
6245412	6245672	It's fine.
6245732	6246272	It's all good.
6246412	6246612	All right.
6246632	6247453	You're on every week anyway.
6247493	6247693	All right.
6247713	6247913	Later.
6250290	6251531	All right, Skype line's open.
6251551	6252593	We'll take one more call.
6253073	6256037	We don't have a lot of time for a lot of calls tonight, so one more call.
6256057	6257278	Here's someone else who calls in every week.
6257598	6258659	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6258679	6259080	Who's this?
6259400	6260041	RavensDolphin.
6260281	6261583	Hi, what's on your mind, RavensDolphin?
6262203	6262624	One thing.
6262884	6264967	Do you like online rental games?
6265047	6266889	I know you mentioned about pre-ordering.
6267129	6269411	How about going to the next stream, online rental?
6270192	6271053	GameFly GameFly
6288595	6290856	It's hard for me to comment on it because I haven't really used it first hand.
6291056	6292496	And I don't want to comment on something I haven't used.
6292836	6299077	But it's something I... If I cancel my Netflix, which I'm probably going to, I will probably shift over to Gamefly.
6299357	6301998	Because I just play more games than I watch movies.
6302678	6303318	I just really do.
6303518	6304058	What do you think?
6304078	6304638	Do you use it?
6305878	6308139	I just signed up today and I'm just trying it out.
6308899	6310339	What do you think so far?
6310559	6313400	How is the setup online and everything and the ease of getting started?
6314180	6314400	Listen.
6316124	6316824	Super seamless.
6317245	6319886	All you have to do is just create your game queue and they'll send it to you.
6320366	6320866	Unlimited.
6321406	6323687	And that's what I like because games are getting expensive.
6323948	6325248	Sony wants to put $100 to $50 per game now.
6329291	6336256	It's going to be very interesting to see what the online rental market is going to do to some of the game ideas.
6336997	6340399	I guess this kind of stuff is getting bigger and bigger, so interesting.
6340960	6342061	I am tempted to check it out.
6343482	6345904	We do a podcast that lots of people listen to.
6345964	6347305	Can't one of these companies give us a free one?
6349062	6351443	Okay, maybe that's just my ego getting in the way, I guess.
6352664	6357126	I might check it out, but again, I don't want to have that and Netflix, although I have a friend that has them both.
6357706	6362068	A coworker of mine uses it and seems to like it, so I'll check it out one of these days.
6362948	6364229	But for now, I'm more of a collector.
6364469	6371772	I bet if DarkSakura would hear, that would be her angle on it, is that she likes to collect them, so she likes to own them and actually have them.
6372503	6379085	I am very glad to say I do know one that does rent Legend games, but I can't remember it.
6380485	6380785	All right.
6381365	6381846	All right, buddy.
6381866	6382686	Well, thanks for the call.
6382746	6383506	Have a good one, okay?
6384446	6384966	All right.
6385086	6385326	All right.
6385366	6386887	We'll see you later.
6388087	6388327	Bye.
6388527	6388907	Bye-bye.
6390828	6391928	I found something interesting.
6392068	6394249	What's that?
6394329	6397230	I found a picture of an Xbox 360.
6397270	6397390	Uh-huh.
6398826	6408011	Motherboard, and they're saying that it's going to get an HDMI out upgrade, and that they're putting an HDMI out port right next to the... Wait, no, bad, I already have an Xbox.
6408792	6409972	Well... Shit!
6410013	6411713	So that, this is on Kotaku.
6411874	6417297	Let's go trade them into GameStop, and then we can put that credit towards a new one.
6417317	6424101	Not that I really need an HDMI out, but I think that's kind of interesting that they have that on there.
6424861	6425181	Alright.
6425762	6427443	Well, any more stories anybody has?
6427783	6428023	Loki?
6428737	6429297	I don't have anything.
6432039	6433399	I don't think I have anything either.
6434520	6438862	Well, then I think we're going to go ahead and wrap it up, so let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
6439182	6440843	Shane, thank you for sitting in with us tonight.
6440883	6443284	I noticed you actually put World of Warcraft away at some point.
6443664	6446265	Yeah, it was annoying to play and listen to people.
6446485	6447986	Oh, I'm sorry we ruined your night.
6448346	6448827	Final thought.
6450187	6451508	Women shouldn't be allowed to vote.
6454244	6456525	Oh, Loki, your final thought.
6456645	6461047	My final thought is actually the official statement from Sony regarding the Apple logo on their site.
6461567	6473291	In a recent update to PlayStation 3's section of the US PlayStation.com website, an external error was made during the upload process, and the Apple icon was mistakenly placed on the site.
6473611	6476913	We immediately fixed the problem and apologize for any confusion this may have caused.
6477793	6478753	They copied!
6479074	6481755	They stole it from somebody, but they're not copping to it.
6481795	6482775	Sony bad, Sony.
6484391	6486252	My final thought is I want ice cream.
6486952	6493314	Thank you guys for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting independent video game radio.

6499436	6500437	Nominate us.
6500597	6500917	Damn it.
6501557	6503778	I actually have something I'm supposed to say on there.
6503818	6504478	What's that?
6504498	6504838	Okay.
6505458	6506899	I hate Sky is Cool.
6507509	6509030	I think that's what I was supposed to say.
6509050	6514854	So you can't cut that out like you want to.
6515094	6515595	That's it.
6516595	6517676	Have a great week, everybody.
6517736	6520638	We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
