00:33.380 --> 00:36.180

throughout the afternoon on Tuesday. So check that out. We're here to talk about

01:16.800 --> 01:21.360
video games and get right back into the news. Who's starting us off tonight?

01:21.360 --> 01:22.360
That would be me.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.880
All right, Queen Dark Sakura, what's up?

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
Hell yeah.

01:25.880 --> 01:30.600
Actually, we've got some good news for our European listeners.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.960
Actually, it's also good news for our American listeners.

01:33.960 --> 01:38.600
There was a release from Nintendo of America stating that there was a small number of DS

01:38.600 --> 01:44.240
lights that had a crack in the casing on the left-hand side of the hinge, and it's just

01:44.240 --> 01:49.600
above the power connector, and it's like 0.02% of the units have it, so they're fixing those

01:49.600 --> 01:50.600
for free.

01:50.600 --> 01:55.000
Nintendo of Europe basically has announced that any faulty DS lights will

01:55.000 --> 01:58.760
be repaired for free as long as the fault in question is covered under the

01:58.760 --> 02:04.720
valid warranty. So basically they're saying that if you have a problem with

02:04.720 --> 02:09.920
it you need to contact the local customer service area for a

02:09.920 --> 02:14.680
Nintendo. The DS lights carry a one-year warranty for manufacturing defects. If

02:14.680 --> 02:20.280
it's covered under the warranty it will be repaired for free. So if you live in

02:20.280 --> 02:25.680
the UK the number to call for Nintendo's customer service and I have no idea how

02:25.680 --> 02:35.120
the phone numbers work at 0 8 7 0 6 0 6 0 2 4 7 open 8 30 to 7 p.m. at national

02:35.120 --> 02:41.360
rate you can also email at Nintendo service center at codestorm.co.uk and

02:41.360 --> 02:47.960
that center spelled American way I think yeah um it's the whole my DS is on crack

02:47.960 --> 02:52.840
saga is very interesting what's been going on with this because the Nintendo

02:52.840 --> 02:56.060
kind of first came out and said it's not a problem but then just a couple days

02:56.060 --> 02:58.960
later they kind of did this and not just in the UK but I know they got something

02:58.960 --> 03:02.940
similar going on in the US as well both the DS lights I've seen on miklotov has

03:02.940 --> 03:07.200
one of my roommate extrovert has one and they're not cracking yet so neither yeah

03:07.200 --> 03:10.600
oh that's right you got one too it doesn't seem like it's this huge

03:10.600 --> 03:14.600
epidemic but it's very interesting that Nintendo is kind of listening to the

03:14.600 --> 03:21.040
internet buzz and kind of saving their ass from internet skewing left and right.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.040
It's kind of interesting.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.040
It's good customer service.

03:23.040 --> 03:27.640
Well, they might actually be skewing the numbers of how many DS lights are cracked.

03:27.640 --> 03:32.640
For example, this was pointed out actually by Max Consul Reader, there's a photo taken

03:32.640 --> 03:38.160
at the New York City flagship Nintendo World Store and guess what?

03:38.160 --> 03:45.620
Six to seven or you know six to eight of the DS lights in the store had the cracks.

03:45.620 --> 03:50.640
Some of them were hairline cracks that were developing and some were just full blown cracks.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.600
So that doesn't sound like.02% to me.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.680
So food for thought.

03:58.680 --> 04:04.920
Anyways speaking of other things including the DS here we've got a brand new game coming

04:04.920 --> 04:13.600
to the DS which is actually kind of an interesting name. It translates to Mario Nation Gears

04:13.600 --> 04:21.200
and there's going to be 100 varieties of mechs which not all of them will be simple two legged

04:21.200 --> 04:25.960
robots. Some of the machines will resemble insects while some others transform the vehicles

04:25.960 --> 04:32.680
and they'll have a variety of weapons from bows to firearms. Sounds very interesting

04:32.680 --> 04:37.320
It says the game is going to be played in full 3D, and the bottom screen is going to

04:37.320 --> 04:42.880
show the mech controls, which can be operated using the touch stylus.

04:42.880 --> 04:48.920
And I don't know, very interesting, especially with this game, also kind of with Mario Nation

04:48.920 --> 04:52.600
Gear, maybe a Mario themed mech game, that's kind of...

04:52.600 --> 04:54.720
Because Mario has to be in everything!

04:54.720 --> 05:00.920
Exactly, but yeah, I don't know, it's a different type of game, that's for sure.

05:00.920 --> 05:06.420
All right, well we go from a new DS game to a classic DS game, or what's quickly becoming

05:06.420 --> 05:08.940
a classic, Animal Crossing Wild World.

05:08.940 --> 05:12.860
I don't know, I got a little sick of this game a while ago, but I know some folks still

05:12.860 --> 05:14.420
play the hell out of it.

05:14.420 --> 05:15.420
Dark Sakura.

05:15.420 --> 05:17.020
Hey, it's because my friends play it.

05:17.020 --> 05:18.900
Nothing wrong with that, it's a fun game.

05:18.900 --> 05:22.780
And guess what, maybe some new life coming very soon to Animal Crossing Wild World, thanks

05:22.780 --> 05:25.100
to your local Toys R Us.

05:25.100 --> 05:30.740
They're going to have DS download stations at Toys R Us with six exclusive virtual gifts.

05:30.740 --> 05:37.380
You can get a one up mushroom, a star, a fire bar, I know you love fire, gold flag, a question

05:37.380 --> 05:38.920
box and a pipe.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.400
And you can use this to decorate your virtual house and make all your internet friends jealous

05:42.400 --> 05:43.900
that you went to Toys R Us.

05:43.900 --> 05:47.700
You can get these downloads through July 29th at your Toys R Us.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.860
Are you going to do that, Dark Sakura?

05:49.860 --> 05:55.060
I might, just so that I can, I'm going to probably get rid of my bathroom that I'm building

05:55.060 --> 05:58.180
in my house and make a Nintendo room so that my HRA score goes up.

05:58.180 --> 06:00.300
Did you ever rebuild your shrine to fire?

06:00.300 --> 06:01.300
No, I did not.

06:01.300 --> 06:05.140
I have a bathroom and I have a room with a bath in it.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.300
I have the outdoor bath.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.500
I have my huge-ass Japanese room.

06:08.500 --> 06:12.220
I have a classic room, because I always make a classic room, and I have a green room, although

06:12.220 --> 06:14.820
the green room might be turned into a shrine to fire.

06:14.820 --> 06:17.980
I do, however, have the bonfire.

06:17.980 --> 06:19.380
I just haven't used it.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.900
All right.

06:20.900 --> 06:25.140
Yeah, now for those that don't know, Dark Sakura on the GameCube version of Animal Crossing

06:25.140 --> 06:29.780
had a shrine to fire that I always felt compelled to visit.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.480
One of the items was just a giant camp fire, right?

06:31.480 --> 06:32.480
That was a big bonfire.

06:32.480 --> 06:36.240
And then you had all these drums that would play, and all the little gyro thingies, or

06:36.240 --> 06:38.300
whatever those are called, that would gyrate around...

06:38.300 --> 06:42.780
Bowing down to the fire, and the music was like...

06:42.780 --> 06:44.880
It was the Japanese festival music.

06:44.880 --> 06:45.880
Scary.

06:45.880 --> 06:46.880
Scary stuff.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.440
And they had like biwa loots in the back.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.600
Hitstun says you should play Second Life and get a Shrine of Fire in Second Life.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.600
I've thought about it.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.760
It's one of those virtual world games.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.480
I've checked out briefly.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.480
I need to...

06:59.480 --> 07:03.000
to it. Okay. Jimmy at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. I know, I think

07:03.000 --> 07:06.780
our buddies at All Games have something set up there and I think our pictures in

07:06.780 --> 07:07.840
the game because of that

07:07.840 --> 07:11.320
but I don't know if there's an Orange Lounge area. Maybe I should be.

07:11.320 --> 07:15.160
Well, we just kinda hang out in the All Games area, which is fine.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.320
Oh, thank you Andrew. Andrew's gonna make us one. Alright.

07:18.320 --> 07:23.020
Anyway, um, let's keep it moving I guess.

07:23.020 --> 07:26.800
Well, I like Animal Crossing a whole lot

07:26.800 --> 07:28.740
you well know

07:28.740 --> 07:31.740
So, uh, guess what? I'm all hyper and excited about

07:32.580 --> 07:39.140
double to know Marie the movie hooray for those who don't know what that means it means animal forest which was

07:39.660 --> 07:46.500
The Japanese name of Animal Crossing. I actually own that game, you know, I have the GameCube one in Japanese

07:46.620 --> 07:52.100
But that's another story. Um, I thought it was a Nintendo 64 game originally originally it was yes

07:52.100 --> 07:58.820
Oh, but I have the GameCube one gotcha because I have the the whole unlock disk thing

08:00.140 --> 08:04.540
And actually the reason I bought it was to help my help my reading skills go up

08:04.540 --> 08:10.340
but anyway, um, but yeah, they have released there is a a

08:12.660 --> 08:16.300
Movie coming out. It's got a cute trailer online

08:17.140 --> 08:21.420
In fact, if you want to go see the official website for it

08:21.420 --> 08:25.660
it's at Doubutsu no Mori dash movie dot JP

08:25.660 --> 08:29.220
I'll spell that out for people who don't know how

08:29.220 --> 08:33.180
D-O-U-B-U-T-S-U-N-O-M-O-R-I

08:33.180 --> 08:36.980
dash movie dot JP slash index dot HTML

08:36.980 --> 08:41.220
it has interactive content online and also the trailer is available

08:41.220 --> 08:44.500
online if you do not know how to read Japanese

08:44.500 --> 08:49.900
guess I have a quick follow up on the Second Life thing apparently all

08:49.900 --> 08:53.420
gamesville actually was taken down funnydale says the guy who set it up had

08:53.420 --> 08:56.700
to delete the arena lounge from second life because he needed to save money

08:56.700 --> 09:01.820
cry so well we'll just have to build it again

09:01.820 --> 09:05.020
except this time it'll be the orange lounge mega dome but you know

09:05.020 --> 09:09.420
we'll have all games make it boredom of course as well

09:09.420 --> 09:16.140
yeah well that's that's very interesting but um anywho um

09:16.140 --> 09:21.340
I was going to mention there were some actual new Wii pages that were on the Nintendo site,

09:21.340 --> 09:26.220
the official Nintendo site there, and super secret stuff was on there.

09:26.220 --> 09:31.540
Of course, it's kind of funny because the Wii pages ended up being on there, but they

09:31.540 --> 09:33.020
weren't finished yet.

09:33.020 --> 09:35.740
And so, yeah.

09:35.740 --> 09:41.860
But basically what we found out is that, of course, the Wii is going to be using the same

09:41.860 --> 09:48.300
friend codes that we all love to hate on the DS, so that was very interesting, as well

09:48.300 --> 09:55.220
as Wii Music is going to be a full blown game for the Wii, which is pretty awesome. And

09:55.220 --> 09:59.940
Wii Music for those who might not remember during E3 was kind of like that demo where

09:59.940 --> 10:07.500
you're conducting the orchestra, so very interesting. Among other things, of course, more information

10:07.500 --> 10:12.960
about the Wii Connect 24, and just kind of talking about some of the upcoming games,

10:12.960 --> 10:15.760
most of which were announced at E3.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.120
But of course, if you want to check it out now, you can't because Nintendo pulled down

10:19.120 --> 10:20.960
the site and all the links.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.560
You know someone saved the cache file.

10:23.560 --> 10:27.880
No, but I do have screenshots, and I will hopefully upload them later.

10:27.880 --> 10:28.880
Sweet!

10:28.880 --> 10:30.680
Did you get to check this out yourself before they took it out?

10:30.680 --> 10:35.820
No, I got to check out the screenshots of the website.

10:35.820 --> 10:41.140
So it was interesting though, to be honest it wasn't anything that we hadn't already

10:41.140 --> 10:42.140
really known.

10:42.140 --> 10:43.140
No earth-shattering news.

10:43.140 --> 10:48.340
Nothing new, no new like games announced or anything like that, so.

10:48.340 --> 10:52.620
Alright, well if you are excited to get your chance to play the Wii, you might get your

10:52.620 --> 10:54.620
chance a little sooner than you thought.

10:54.620 --> 10:59.840
According to Punk News, the Nintendo Fusion Tour this year, you know how Nintendo sponsors

10:59.840 --> 11:03.220
this tour, the music fest every year they take around the country, I think didn't they

11:03.220 --> 11:05.560
have Evanescence one year I want to say?

11:05.560 --> 11:09.760
Maybe I'm on crack, I don't know, but they have different artists that do this.

11:09.760 --> 11:14.780
They're actually going to feature the Wii console at Nintendo Fusion, and you will be

11:14.780 --> 11:17.740
able to try the console for yourselves hands-on.

11:17.740 --> 11:23.100
Hopefully no five-hour lines like E3, but seeing as probably that many people that were

11:23.100 --> 11:27.360
in that line wouldn't be able to fit into a freaking arena, I don't know, hopefully

11:27.360 --> 11:30.720
your chances will be much better to actually get a chance to play the Wii.

11:30.720 --> 11:35.220
So if you're not feeling so hot about the bands, hey, go and you can play the Wii while

11:35.220 --> 11:40.200
the main bands on stage, but then again, that is an awful lot of money just to play a Wii,

11:40.200 --> 11:45.380
so you really have to be a true Nintendo fanboy or fangirl to want to do that.

11:45.380 --> 11:49.740
But hey, if you go, have fun and email us and tell us how it went for you.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.740
Exactly.

11:51.740 --> 11:55.100
And it's kind of funny, though, about the whole Wii thing.

11:55.100 --> 12:03.020
Actually, there was reports that EA had leaked the release date for the Wii in the UK.

12:03.020 --> 12:08.500
And well the date ends up being November 3rd, 2006.

12:08.500 --> 12:14.020
And this was attached to the game Need for Speed Carbon which was posted as I guess a

12:14.020 --> 12:16.220
launch title.

12:16.220 --> 12:23.520
What's interesting though is that happens to be about, oh I don't know, just about two

12:23.520 --> 12:29.820
weeks or so after the October 18th day.

12:29.820 --> 12:36.000
And remember how we were speculating October 18th would be the actual launch day for the

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Wii of the United States.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.480
It makes sense that there would be a two-week delay until the Wii came out in the UK.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.880
I seem to remember we talked about some story on the show before, though, that supported

12:46.880 --> 12:51.200
a six-week delay for the UK, and that's why some release dates had leaked for the

12:51.200 --> 12:53.400
UK, like Red Steel or something.

12:53.400 --> 13:01.720
You have to go back in the archives a few episodes, but that UK delay seems to shift

13:01.720 --> 13:05.080
around when they bring up these different ideas for release dates.

13:05.080 --> 13:12.400
I don't know, but to be honest though, November 3rd as the release date for Need for Speed

13:12.400 --> 13:19.100
Carbon sounds, I don't know, it sounds a little bit late to me, because I know Carbon's coming

13:19.100 --> 13:23.080
out in October in the United States.

13:23.080 --> 13:32.080
I don't know, if that were true, if that actually was the launch date for the UK, I would say that the 18th is pretty feasible for the United States.

13:32.080 --> 13:46.080
But right now it's just completely rumor based, and even rumor based on seeing this date, because there are obviously titles that come out a week or two later than the release date.

13:46.080 --> 13:50.080
So, I don't know. Interesting nonetheless.

13:50.080 --> 14:05.080
I'd have to say so. Well, as far as the release dates go, I actually do have a list of release dates for the 28th in the UK, if anybody is interested.

14:05.080 --> 14:10.080
Sure, I want to know, even though I don't live there, but I know our friends that live there want to know.

14:10.080 --> 14:17.840
Civ City Rome is coming out, Civilization 4 Warlords, Field Commander Formula 106, Juiced

14:17.840 --> 14:25.240
Eliminator, Pac-Man World 3 on the PC, Shin Megami Tensei, Siphon Filter, Dark Mirror,

14:25.240 --> 14:33.560
The Ant Bully, Tokyo Extreme Racer, and Tringo on Game Boy Advance.

14:33.560 --> 14:40.580
The US isn't getting much more stuff being released, but anyways, let's see here, Tech

14:40.580 --> 14:45.120
in Dark Resurrection, which is going to be a pretty big game of course, Painkiller Hell

14:45.120 --> 14:51.000
Wars is going to be coming out so far, I think that game actually might be delayed again,

14:51.000 --> 14:58.860
but who knows, Civ IV Warlords for the PC, Civ City Rome also on the PC, other than that,

14:58.860 --> 15:04.700
I think, what was it, Ant Bully is coming out on the consoles and the portables.

15:04.700 --> 15:05.900
That's about it.

15:05.900 --> 15:11.780
There's a big, you know, blank space there until the week of the 31st, which you're going

15:11.780 --> 15:14.900
to be getting flat out to in Barnyard and stuff like that.

15:14.900 --> 15:18.260
I was going to say, August is getting closer and closer, and that's when we're going to

15:18.260 --> 15:21.660
start seeing at least some 360 titles and stuff.

15:21.660 --> 15:24.860
Three more weeks until my fucking Dead Rising comes out.

15:24.860 --> 15:27.000
That is going to make me a very happy camper.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.460
Even I'm pretty excited about Dead Rising.

15:28.460 --> 15:33.340
In Dead Rising, every video I see of Dead Rising is more kick ass than the last.

15:33.340 --> 15:36.140
I like the undead.

15:36.140 --> 15:37.740
You must be interested in Dead Rising, too, though.

15:37.740 --> 15:40.560
I mean getting to kill zombies with anything you want.

15:40.560 --> 15:41.820
I love zombies.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.560
I especially love watching them score.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.840
You are a zombie some days.

15:45.840 --> 15:46.840
Some days.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.940
I've seen you in the morning.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.120
You have seen me in the morning.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.120
I'm like...

15:50.120 --> 15:53.860
It's like in that scene in Shaun of the Dead where he's just getting up and stumbling to

15:53.860 --> 15:54.860
the door.

15:54.860 --> 15:55.860
U Vaccine!

15:55.860 --> 15:56.860
Like that.

15:56.860 --> 15:57.860
I love that movie.

15:57.860 --> 16:01.620
Alrighty, well thank you for the release date news, and

16:01.620 --> 16:05.220
you know, I feel sometimes left out when we do release dates, because Dark Sakura

16:05.220 --> 16:07.540
does them and Loki does them, so I'm gonna figure out

16:07.540 --> 16:11.260
like what our third... You can do the Ugandan one.

16:11.260 --> 16:14.460
I forgot to mention some stuff, I was gonna confirm a few things.

16:14.460 --> 16:17.820
There's a Rumor Control, or not Rumor Control,

16:17.820 --> 16:20.980
Retail Radar thing, Retard Radar.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.620
Now Retail Radar segment that they did on GameSpot,

16:24.620 --> 16:28.500
It was talking about Oblivion on the PS3 which I've been seeing for weeks now

16:28.500 --> 16:32.860
by the way. Yes, it is on the PS3. It is coming out. We have

16:32.860 --> 16:36.900
a date now. It's like November 2nd or something like that.

16:36.900 --> 16:40.740
It's coming out on the PSP in March too, which I thought was really

16:40.740 --> 16:41.420
interesting.

16:41.420 --> 16:45.620
PS3 is not out till November 17th question?

16:45.620 --> 16:49.700
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said PS3. No, PS3 is in November.

16:49.700 --> 16:53.260
My bad. Yeah, so I thought that was really interesting.

16:53.260 --> 16:56.420
That's all I got.

16:56.420 --> 16:59.540
As I was saying, I feel left out when it comes to release dates.

16:59.540 --> 17:03.020
I need to figure out what our third most listened to country is and do the release

17:03.020 --> 17:03.980
dates for there.

17:03.980 --> 17:07.220
I think it's Australia. You should do the Australian release dates.

17:07.220 --> 17:11.100
I'll look into that, or maybe I could rotate around some of the other

17:11.100 --> 17:12.060
countries that listen to us.

17:12.060 --> 17:15.660
Honestly, maybe we should start covering Japanese release dates. Actually, that's not a bad idea.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.820
Maybe we could go back and forth or something. We'll see what to do.

17:18.820 --> 17:22.500
I'll have to tutor you.

17:22.500 --> 17:26.580
No, if we go there, then we're switching, and you can do Japanese release dates, I'll

17:26.580 --> 17:31.220
do UK release dates, and that's easier for me, because I've never taken a class.

17:31.220 --> 17:33.420
Anyway, we'll talk about that at our next staff meeting.

17:33.420 --> 17:37.580
For now, let's talk about what Microsoft might be talking about at their staff meetings,

17:37.580 --> 17:40.420
Blu-ray, and what the hell they're going to be doing about it.

17:40.420 --> 17:46.860
Well, actually, Major Nelson actually interviewed Amir Majidimer on his latest podcast, I suppose,

17:46.860 --> 17:52.060
or I'm sorry, blogcast, as he calls it, and his group, Amir's group at Microsoft, oversees

17:52.060 --> 17:57.580
the audio-video compression technologies and had something interesting to say about Blu-ray.

17:57.580 --> 18:04.600
According to Majidamir, Blu-ray moves the recording surface very close to the top layer

18:04.600 --> 18:10.180
of the disk, protected by just a very thin coating, and this makes maintaining the high

18:10.180 --> 18:15.720
reliability of disks during the actual manufacturing process much more difficult.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.220
This factor is a really big difference between Blu-ray and HD-DVD.

18:19.220 --> 18:25.420
Well, HD-DVD, like traditional DVDs, actually protects its data between two layers of protective

18:25.420 --> 18:30.940
plastic above and below, thus making the manufacturing of the disks much more reliable.

18:30.940 --> 18:36.940
So kind of interesting there, the differences between the two formats, because I don't know,

18:36.940 --> 18:42.180
I guess when you look at them on an HD TV, there probably won't be a whole lot of difference,

18:42.180 --> 18:46.460
but it's hard for me to say when I haven't seen a lot of demos of Blu-ray.

18:46.460 --> 18:52.780
We shall see if Sony's next format takes off or ends up going the way of UMD.

18:52.780 --> 18:53.780
We'll see.

18:53.780 --> 18:56.300
I've been hearing not good about it, though.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.300
We'll see.

18:57.300 --> 18:58.300
I don't know.

18:58.300 --> 19:01.860
I'm thinking maybe it's just because it's easy to pick on Sony right now, but I try

19:01.860 --> 19:04.940
to keep some hope, but it gets harder and harder every day.

19:04.940 --> 19:13.060
Anyways, there's some actual funny stuff coming out here from an EA employee who admitted

19:13.060 --> 19:20.060
to releasing crappy games. I know EA is kind of a scapegoat here, but they do have a lot

19:21.020 --> 19:25.900
of games that are just ports, especially the next gen stuff. You may remember the Xbox

19:25.900 --> 19:32.120
360 launch and how a lot of the games were just ports of the current gen stuff with slightly

19:32.120 --> 19:38.780
more high res graphics or whatever. But anyways, there's actually a YouTube video out there

19:38.780 --> 19:47.280
now that you can play, and it's kind of interesting. A little bit of a funny, you know, funny little

19:47.280 --> 19:52.280
thing there. So, check it out.

19:52.280 --> 19:59.480
Alright, well, crappy games do not make us happy gamers, and when we're not happy, we

19:59.480 --> 20:00.480
We get ranty.

20:00.480 --> 20:15.560
Why don't you start us off with our favorite segment, the FUs of the week, DarkSagra.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.760
Oh my god, it's so hot.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.880
FU to the hot.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.720
Dear son, piss off.

20:23.720 --> 20:30.400
I want it to be dark, even more I want it to stay dry, and even more than that I want

20:30.400 --> 20:34.400
it to be a nice 72 degrees outside.

20:34.400 --> 20:40.200
With slight overcast, and okay maybe not dry, maybe a little touch of water in the air so

20:40.200 --> 20:42.380
that it doesn't hurt to breathe.

20:42.380 --> 20:48.080
I tried breathing outside and it felt like I was breathing plaster.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.900
It sucked.

20:49.900 --> 20:56.300
So an F.U. goes to our 113 degrees today.

20:56.300 --> 20:59.660
Even worse that it's night time and 95 degrees.

20:59.660 --> 21:02.740
I had our thermostat sit down to 70.

21:02.740 --> 21:04.740
It read 85.

21:04.740 --> 21:07.140
That's not right.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.420
Celsius maybe.

21:08.420 --> 21:12.700
And a sub F.U. to everyone who complains about the quote humidity Rob.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.700
Oh screw off.

21:13.700 --> 21:14.700
Piss off.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.260
Piss off right back at you.

21:17.260 --> 21:18.820
It's not humid.

21:18.820 --> 21:25.460
I'm gonna have to say F you to my cable being out, or not my cable, but my internet being

21:25.460 --> 21:26.460
out at home.

21:26.460 --> 21:29.860
Comcast decided to take a crap because, uh, did you pay the bill?

21:29.860 --> 21:31.860
Yes, I paid the bill.

21:31.860 --> 21:35.900
Yes, because that's why my internet stops working and my cable's fine, because I didn't

21:35.900 --> 21:36.900
pay the bill.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.900
That doesn't make any sense at all.

21:38.900 --> 21:46.540
Anyways, um, so yeah, um, that really sucks and I couldn't, um, read news and check out

21:46.540 --> 21:47.540
porn I guess.

21:47.540 --> 21:51.700
So, that made me a very sad Loki.

21:51.700 --> 21:57.460
My FU of the week goes to Coldstone for being a diet's worst enemy.

21:57.460 --> 21:59.620
I'm a victim of deliciousness, what can I say?

21:59.620 --> 22:00.620
Andrew!

22:00.620 --> 22:02.740
Who's been awfully quiet this segment.

22:02.740 --> 22:04.500
Surely you have something for this.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.500
Oh hell yes.

22:05.500 --> 22:11.620
Alright, I'm going to have to repeat that FU to the hot with a few things added on.

22:11.620 --> 22:16.060
FU to the shitty air conditioner that is in our house.

22:16.060 --> 22:20.980
temperature climbs up, air conditioner decides to take a shit, and it's suddenly 95 degrees

22:20.980 --> 22:25.500
in the house. No wonder you're here tonight. At night! No wonder you're here tonight. And

22:25.500 --> 22:32.500
it's so hot, it has never been so hot in my house that my computer will not run games.

22:33.280 --> 22:38.180
My video card overheats and takes a shit, locks up the system within two minutes. Wow.

22:38.180 --> 22:42.660
is that hot. What are you gonna do?

22:42.660 --> 22:46.820
I don't know. You're gonna have to run to target and get a room?

22:46.820 --> 22:49.940
I think I will spend the night in the lawn and sleep in sprinklers.

22:49.940 --> 22:53.140
That is the only course of action for me.

22:53.140 --> 22:56.940
Gosh.

22:56.940 --> 23:01.060
Well good luck to you, sucker. End the angst. Alright, yes, let's end the angst.

23:01.060 --> 23:06.340
Let's end the angst and get to our listeners, because they rock!

23:06.340 --> 23:09.260
we love our listeners and we have a segment that we've been doing for a

23:09.260 --> 23:12.020
couple weeks now called the voicemails of the week and we'd love to get your

23:12.020 --> 23:12.860
feedback

23:12.860 --> 23:16.160
on different topics and last week's topic that we gave to you guys for the

23:16.160 --> 23:17.180
voicemails of the week

23:17.180 --> 23:21.940
was our games too easy. We have two voicemails we want to play for you tonight

23:21.940 --> 23:25.780
and here's the first feedback on the our games too easy topic.

23:25.780 --> 23:30.340
My name is Jack Monkey Upload and basically I'm sending you a question of the week

23:30.340 --> 23:34.140
and games back in the day were a lot cheaper to make

23:34.140 --> 23:39.340
And you'd only have like two guys, two or three guys, and it only takes them a couple months to make a game.

23:39.340 --> 23:47.340
And I spent most of their time making the game itself, and the levels were like really easy to make, it wouldn't take that much time.

23:47.340 --> 23:55.640
But nowadays, the levels for like these, the new games are spent with like hundreds of maybe thousands of people.

23:55.640 --> 24:02.140
And like a lot of them are artists that just maybe work on just the levels, and some of them I only worked on the end levels.

24:02.140 --> 24:08.140
and you spend like tens of millions of dollars on a game, you want everyone to play like the majority of the way through.

24:08.140 --> 24:13.640
Because if most people only play through like half a million dollars worth of your game,

24:13.640 --> 24:17.640
then you might as well just spend half a million on it instead of spending ten million.

24:17.640 --> 24:25.640
Yeah, I think this trend is also going to increase because next-gen games are getting really expensive,

24:25.640 --> 24:32.640
So you're going to see games that like anybody can complete just so they'll get through the majority of it and see everything.

24:32.640 --> 24:37.640
Alright, that's all I wanted to say. I'll listen to you guys again.

25:02.640 --> 25:09.600
Actually at Classic Gaming Expo, I went to a panel for the guy who did, um, oh god I can't

25:09.600 --> 25:15.360
remember the names, who did, um, like, uh, combat in Pac-Man, in Battlezone, in a lot

25:15.360 --> 25:21.540
of those, uh, old, uh, you know, Atari classics, and they're, you know, basically saying about

25:21.540 --> 25:26.880
how they were expected to crank out, you know, arcade perfect versions, as close to perfect

25:26.880 --> 25:32.000
versions of arcade games, and how, you know, what they had to work with then, and yeah,

25:32.000 --> 25:37.120
was a lot cheaper to produce back then. I mean given inflation though and the cost of production

25:37.760 --> 25:42.560
even comparatively it was still probably cheaper to make games then. Took less time even though

25:42.560 --> 25:47.520
they were basically hand coding and didn't have the tools to do it. You know they would create

25:47.520 --> 25:53.280
their own tools from scratch. I think though that now because we have such a greater capacity a lot

25:53.280 --> 25:58.080
more does go into it and you do have more people you got to pay it does cost more. So yeah they

25:58.080 --> 26:02.920
They have to make these levels cost effective, and on top of that, they also have to think

26:02.920 --> 26:05.760
about the attention span of the average gamer today, too.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.640
Andrew, do you have a thought, too?

26:08.640 --> 26:15.920
My take on it is, nowadays, game making is a big business, it's like Hollywood, and it's

26:15.920 --> 26:19.840
not so much that we're playing games anymore as that we're watching them, we're experiencing

26:19.840 --> 26:23.120
them, and they've got to have the deep storyline, all that kind of stuff.

26:23.120 --> 26:30.200
You take how hard games like, say, Ghouls'n'Ghosts was, and then you compare it to, you know,

26:30.200 --> 26:34.760
this isn't a completely fair analogy, you compare it to Prey, which just came out.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.640
It's not so much you're playing a game anymore, you're playing a movie.

26:37.640 --> 26:41.540
So much went into it, and there's just one way that they want you to play through it

26:41.540 --> 26:44.560
so you experience the way that they want you to do it.

26:44.560 --> 26:51.560
Now, Prey is one of the most easy first-person shooters I've ever played in my life.

26:51.560 --> 26:57.320
isn't saying much, but it's just there's one way that they want you to play it

26:57.320 --> 27:02.540
and usually it's the easiest way because they want you to finish it. They want you

27:02.540 --> 27:06.260
to experience the whole thing. Prey is also interesting when you talk about

27:06.260 --> 27:09.860
those big budgets and stories because like it doesn't... I was talking about

27:09.860 --> 27:13.560
this in my review of the demo last week. There's no real cutscenes in Prey, at

27:13.560 --> 27:16.700
least it seems like. Everything is very seamless. Yeah, they took a cue from

27:16.700 --> 27:20.980
Half-Life 2. Well, from Doom 3, really, and its engine. But yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah,

27:20.980 --> 27:23.080
Yeah, it all kind of comes back to that.

27:23.080 --> 27:26.080
I sort of like the cinematic element games though.

27:26.080 --> 27:27.080
I do too.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.080
I think Prey is a beautiful game.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.080
Did anyone ever play Berserk on Dreamcast?

27:30.080 --> 27:35.040
Oh, I was going to say Berserk on Atari 2600 with the bouncy happy face, but no, I haven't

27:35.040 --> 27:36.040
played the...

27:36.040 --> 27:39.040
Actually, it came out before we got the anime over here and I started actually picking up

27:39.040 --> 27:44.960
the fan subs after that and downloading manga scans just because it was like freaking playing

27:44.960 --> 27:45.960
through the anime.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.720
It was so perfect.

27:47.720 --> 27:48.720
There was so much good...

27:48.720 --> 27:51.680
I like the games, though, that give a more in-depth story.

27:51.680 --> 27:55.280
I think that it has a lot of the action that you want,

27:55.280 --> 27:58.240
but at the same time, you're compelled to keep playing

27:58.240 --> 28:00.840
because the story is so good.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.360
Well, let's hear another voicemail

28:02.360 --> 28:04.980
from our second voicemail and last voicemail for tonight

28:04.980 --> 28:07.180
on this same topic.

28:07.180 --> 28:08.640
Hey, what's up, Orange Onions Radio?

28:08.640 --> 28:10.600
This is PDF40 from Michigan.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.560
And I think about the video games getting harder.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.120
I don't think they're getting harder.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.080
I think they're getting less accessible for people.

28:18.080 --> 28:23.840
Like back when Pac-Man and stuff was out, the controllers had a lot less buttons, it

28:23.840 --> 28:31.240
was just like an A and a B. It's not that they're getting harder, it's just less accessible.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.240
Think of it.

28:32.240 --> 28:37.520
Back then there was only 2D games, and now we have a whole other dimension, and there's

28:37.520 --> 28:43.360
a ton more objectives nowadays, and the controllers have so many more buttons on them.

28:43.360 --> 28:48.200
Even though it's easier to beat the game, they're just harder to play.

28:48.200 --> 28:52.240
So I just think video games are now less accessible to the average person.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.480
They're just easier to us because we're gamers.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.480
Thanks guys, see ya.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.480
Interesting.

28:57.480 --> 29:02.240
Kind of talking about the accessibility to everybody.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.560
So what do you guys think?

29:04.560 --> 29:05.560
That's a very valid point.

29:05.560 --> 29:10.760
I mean, actually I think that that's the point that Nintendo is trying to do with the Wii

29:10.760 --> 29:15.980
controller trying to simplify things and make it to where it's more attractive.

29:15.980 --> 29:18.140
In one degree, it's not as simple.

29:18.140 --> 29:21.480
To another degree, I think it's very simplifying.

29:21.480 --> 29:24.160
You move your hand, that's all you do.

29:24.160 --> 29:29.880
I think that that whole accessibility thing of being able to actually get into it, being

29:29.880 --> 29:35.100
able to pick up the controller and know what to do with it, I think that's a lot of the

29:35.100 --> 29:36.840
issue that we have these days.

29:36.840 --> 29:43.080
it more accessible to people who don't have the patience to read the damn manual.

29:43.080 --> 29:46.720
A lot of people don't. I mean, you're going to have a hard time telling a non-gamer to

29:46.720 --> 29:49.000
read the manual. I'm sorry, that's bitter tech support coming

29:49.000 --> 29:51.620
through again. Yeah, right. Anyway, thank you guys so much

29:51.620 --> 29:55.360
for the voicemails of the week, and of course we don't always have enough time to play everything

29:55.360 --> 29:58.320
that we get, but we do try to listen to all of the voicemails. Actually, we do listen

29:58.320 --> 30:02.540
to every single voicemail, and we really appreciate you guys calling in. If you want to leave

30:02.540 --> 30:03.540
us a voicemail.

30:03.540 --> 30:06.380
The number is 916-226-9067.

30:06.380 --> 30:08.860
Please keep in mind that is not a toll-free call.

30:08.860 --> 30:12.700
If you don't pay the bill, ask whoever does their permission first.

30:12.700 --> 30:16.140
Or if you want to do it the free way, you just download a little program called Skype,

30:16.140 --> 30:21.620
it's very popular, and you can call username OrangeLoungeRadio and leave us your voicemail

30:21.620 --> 30:22.620
that way.

30:22.620 --> 30:23.620
Here's your topic for this week.

30:23.620 --> 30:28.360
We just had Loki tell us a story about EA talking about releasing crappy games and kind

30:28.360 --> 30:29.900
of apologizing for that.

30:29.900 --> 30:37.180
We want to know what company do you think needs to be apologizing for a video game right about now or a piece of hardware?

30:37.660 --> 30:39.660
So we'll leave that to you guys

30:39.840 --> 30:42.120
Whatever you want call in all right

30:43.220 --> 30:44.940
I mean

30:44.940 --> 30:49.180
20 years later does Atari still actually 22 years later does Atari?

30:53.020 --> 30:56.900
Don't let dark soccer influence you we want to know what you think on this topic

30:56.900 --> 31:02.380
So please call us any time during the week and leave us a voicemail speaking of things that of entities that suck

31:02.700 --> 31:07.740
It looks like Sony's trying to make our friends over in the UK bend over and take it

31:07.740 --> 31:12.100
just like they're doing for us as in there there is a

31:13.100 --> 31:19.820
Notice that was out that both the 20 gigabyte and 60 gigabyte versions of PlayStation 3 are going to be out in the UK

31:19.820 --> 31:22.420
However, not both of them on launch day

31:22.420 --> 31:29.140
They're working by consulting with some of the different merchandisers to, you know,

31:29.140 --> 31:33.020
basically set up the different SKUs for both items.

31:33.620 --> 31:42.000
There is a note that though it may not necessarily be both at launch.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.100
In fact, there's a quote here from David Wilson from Sony UK saying

31:46.100 --> 31:47.920
that he actually doesn't know.

31:47.920 --> 31:54.120
Um, he explained that Sony has to face, um, what the challenge would be of offering a

31:54.120 --> 31:58.480
choice without confusing the consumers, meeting the needs of the retailers, et cetera, blah

31:58.480 --> 31:59.480
blah blah.

31:59.480 --> 32:05.080
Um, however, they are actually saying though that for preordering a PlayStation 3, it is

32:05.080 --> 32:08.780
going to be a hundred and thirty pounds, a hundred and fifty pounds.

32:08.780 --> 32:10.760
That's a, uh, retail suggestion.

32:10.760 --> 32:11.760
Hmm.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.280
Well, we'll see.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.760
That's expensive, man.

32:15.760 --> 32:20.720
Yeah, poor guys in the UK getting screwed on those prices.

32:20.720 --> 32:23.680
Their tax rate's higher over there too, so they get double screwed, don't they?

32:23.680 --> 32:31.480
Yeah, well the final price is again, it's November 17th in Europe, 600 Euros, converting

32:31.480 --> 32:34.240
to 425 pounds in the UK.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.240
Interesting.

32:35.240 --> 32:41.000
Well, they're going to need to make all the money that they can because according to an

32:41.000 --> 32:46.160
an IBM engineer is making a comment about their chip yields for the cell processor and

32:46.160 --> 32:51.940
how hard it is to get these chips to be made right.

32:51.940 --> 32:57.480
Basically he's saying that for every sheet that they press, 10-20% of them work.

32:57.480 --> 32:58.480
And that's it.

32:58.480 --> 33:06.280
And it costs, say for example, $1,000 to produce a wafer with 100 chips on it.

33:06.280 --> 33:11.360
And if only 10 or 20 of those are going to be working, that increases the cost of the

33:11.360 --> 33:13.880
system significantly.

33:13.880 --> 33:17.280
So that's not very good.

33:17.280 --> 33:21.920
But yeah, I don't know, this is not good for anything.

33:21.920 --> 33:25.740
And I'm wondering if you've got a problem with, you know, before we were speculating

33:25.740 --> 33:30.000
that there are going to be shortages on the systems anyways, imagine if you will, that

33:30.000 --> 33:35.860
let's just say you've got the blu-ray shortages, you have the cell processor chip shortages

33:35.860 --> 33:41.100
or expenses or whatever I mean are we gonna see a lot of these consoles at

33:41.100 --> 33:44.900
launch and is the launch even going to be happening when they say they are well

33:44.900 --> 33:49.060
now I think this story just barely missed the cut for tonight but I seem to

33:49.060 --> 33:52.140
remember reading somewhere that the ps3s have actually gone into production now

33:52.140 --> 33:56.140
at this point finally so and I unfortunately have a lot more details

33:56.140 --> 33:58.780
than that but you know it's all you pretty much mean no ps3s are finally on

33:58.780 --> 34:03.820
their way so I mean you see that Sony's gearing up for this you know with with a

34:03.820 --> 34:06.340
a lot of people are starting to get nervous, like are they going to have enough time, well

34:06.340 --> 34:11.520
now okay maybe they could do this, but wow this chip thing really has me wondering, but

34:11.520 --> 34:13.400
how long have they been going at the chips?

34:13.400 --> 34:18.260
I don't know, but they basically, this was coming from the Guardian technology blog,

34:18.260 --> 34:24.120
and they were saying, this is just an assumption of how much it costs to produce a chip, since

34:24.120 --> 34:29.820
you have to do a whole wafer at a time, you say for example you can produce 100 chips

34:29.820 --> 34:35.760
per wafer. And if there's no defects at all, you get 100 good chips for $10 each. Now,

34:35.760 --> 34:41.360
if the defect rate is 99%, you only get one chip per wafer and it costs you $1000. So

34:41.360 --> 34:48.360
if 10-20% of the chips are working, that's pretty expensive. And that's assuming there's

34:48.360 --> 34:54.340
not going to be any glitches or whatever with this stuff. I don't know. It's not good, but

34:54.340 --> 34:59.540
you know what? I think that they're going to be able to find some way to keep the cost

34:59.540 --> 35:04.780
down obviously you know they know what they're doing so we'll see all right I

35:04.780 --> 35:09.220
you know I got a look at chat room going on here blaze revolution says it's 17

35:09.220 --> 35:15.380
and a quarter percent in the UK for the tax that's vicious Wow let's see

35:15.380 --> 35:20.180
ol army Eddie says $200 to pre-order a ps3 here and I know he's in Vancouver

35:20.180 --> 35:25.300
because I was talking about my recent vacation with him let's see what else

35:25.300 --> 35:29.260
blaze revolution simply says push back the release date then go back and fix

35:29.260 --> 35:31.220
this crap

35:31.220 --> 35:33.420
they're not going to do that you know

35:33.420 --> 35:37.900
and ravens dolphin says it's a rumor sky a rumor

35:37.900 --> 35:41.420
it's everything's rumored until you know they come out and say it and they're not

35:41.420 --> 35:44.920
gonna so you know what we'll just find out when the launch happens and we'll see what

35:44.920 --> 35:47.940
you know what's going on here comes the doom and gloom too we have anoosh says

35:47.940 --> 35:51.480
uh... i'm sorry if i pronounce that wrong i always have to apologize for that

35:51.480 --> 35:55.820
says uh... anoosh says the end of sony core is close

35:55.820 --> 35:58.900
and uh... quicksilver says i think sony is screwed

35:58.900 --> 36:02.820
I don't think it's going to be the end of them. No, they're a huge company. They still have

36:02.820 --> 36:03.380
wagas.

36:03.380 --> 36:06.700
And the whole thing is they could come out with something you know really

36:06.700 --> 36:10.340
remarkable that we don't know about that they're just kinda keep it under wraps.

36:10.340 --> 36:14.340
The thing is right now though, it's kind of just you know the trend where

36:14.340 --> 36:16.620
everyone's posting you know doom and gloom stories about them.

36:16.620 --> 36:19.580
We're not going to know until we actually see the launch of what's going on.

36:19.580 --> 36:20.980
Because say for example

36:20.980 --> 36:24.900
they're only getting you know twenty percent per you know yield or whatever.

36:24.900 --> 36:28.060
They're obviously not going to just stick with that you know oh damn you know eighty

36:28.060 --> 36:31.260
percent of those don't work oh well I guess we'll just have to produce more no they're

36:31.260 --> 36:34.940
going to figure out why they're not working and fix that problem no they're going to bring

36:34.940 --> 36:39.380
out a new peripheral called the ibotoi laser in our chat room says uh laser one two three

36:39.380 --> 36:43.500
four five three one says uh no sony has a good plan it's easier to just replace everything

36:43.500 --> 36:47.140
than it is to qa yeah remember when remember when all we had to worry about was discrete

36:47.140 --> 36:52.460
errors now look at all this shit remember back on um for the first playstation um how

36:52.460 --> 36:57.180
you know you'd have to end up turning your system upside down or sideways because the

36:57.180 --> 36:58.300
laser mechanism.

36:58.300 --> 37:02.500
Wasn't aligned right? Exactly. They started actually just selling replacement parts for

37:02.500 --> 37:03.180
thirteen bucks.

37:03.180 --> 37:06.340
This might be

37:06.340 --> 37:09.540
it for Sony and PlayStation. I don't know.

37:09.540 --> 37:13.220
I don't know. I don't know if I'd go that far. Well,

37:13.220 --> 37:16.700
anyway, we've been talking a lot about chips and

37:16.700 --> 37:20.140
this is something interesting you could do with that chip inside your DS Lite.

37:20.140 --> 37:24.500
You know how you can like overclock your computer? Well, a Japanese gamer has

37:24.500 --> 37:27.140
figured out a way to overclock your DS

37:27.140 --> 37:32.540
light. Now obviously this is not an easy process but if you want to check it out

37:32.540 --> 37:36.940
you can head over to Engadget. They ran a story on July 19th on how to

37:36.940 --> 37:41.300
overclock your Nintendo DS and this process will probably take you several

37:41.300 --> 37:46.620
hours. You have to open up your DS light, drill a hold in the side, solder several

37:46.620 --> 37:51.300
different areas on it, and make sure you don't touch too much of the bad areas

37:51.300 --> 37:55.100
that will break the whole damn thing. And now this has been translated into

37:55.100 --> 37:58.640
English if you want to take a look at this I believe the site is ndshotmod.com

37:58.640 --> 38:05.680
but of course remember this would be violating your warranty nice proof of

38:05.680 --> 38:11.360
concept but what exactly is it supposed to accomplish it just overclocking it's

38:11.360 --> 38:17.360
just for homebrew stuff I don't know this essentially what this hack will do

38:17.360 --> 38:20.200
reports are saying it will actually physically increase the speed of

38:20.200 --> 38:25.880
of visuals and sound between 1.4 times and 1.7 times which means it's pretty

38:25.880 --> 38:30.520
much unplayable it's uncontrollable high-pitched music and rather a pain in

38:30.520 --> 38:34.600
the butt to be playing so this is something you do you thought why are

38:34.600 --> 38:38.880
you where got fast only because you're like a hardcore hacker like the same

38:38.880 --> 38:44.000
type of person that would install Linux on a toaster this is for you have fun

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Have fun.

38:45.000 --> 38:49.640
VX Jason XB, this is something he'd do, right?

38:49.640 --> 38:53.240
No, actually I know several people who are engineers who would do it.

38:53.240 --> 38:57.440
Personally, I think the better hack that they had was for the original DS where you can

38:57.440 --> 39:02.680
actually make it as bright as a DS Lite using a firmware upgrade.

39:02.680 --> 39:08.600
I'm still plenty pleased with my Game Boy Advance and After Burner.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.760
That was awesome.

39:09.760 --> 39:14.560
And speaking of awesome, I have another story.

39:14.560 --> 39:20.520
Cartoon Network has a new massively multiplayer online game coming out.

39:20.520 --> 39:26.280
They're working with, I guess it's Griggan Entertainment, to make one that will have

39:26.280 --> 39:31.400
Blue, Ben 10, Mac, and the kids next door.

39:31.400 --> 39:40.020
And I love Kotaku because the writing is so honest and, you know, takes no prisoners.

39:40.020 --> 39:43.240
Basically saying that it sounds like a formula for instant crap.

39:43.240 --> 39:49.640
However, there's a couple, um, Toontown Online, what?

39:49.640 --> 39:52.280
Disney has a Toontown Online thing for...

39:52.280 --> 39:53.280
Shush!

39:53.280 --> 39:54.280
Stop distracting me!

39:54.280 --> 39:55.280
Shush!

39:55.280 --> 39:56.280
Where's the ferret when we need it?

39:56.280 --> 39:57.280
I don't even know.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.280
He died.

39:58.280 --> 40:05.120
The game is going to be a free download, um, it's actually, you'll have a subscription

40:05.120 --> 40:09.520
service that you'll have to pay for and you can just download the game, but it will be

40:09.520 --> 40:16.860
an East meets West approach that, um, sort of like going to be having your Western cartoon

40:16.860 --> 40:22.120
characters mixing it up with anime, and they said that it should be out around spring 2008.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.560
Interesting.

40:24.560 --> 40:27.800
I think, I agree with the formula for crap, honestly.

40:27.800 --> 40:32.240
Now, my question is, will they put in some of the Adult Swim stuff? Like, could we

40:32.240 --> 40:35.720
have Pee-Wee's Playhouse and Saved by the Bell? That would rock.

40:35.720 --> 40:40.460
Seriously, um, I want to say Extrovert Sister

40:40.460 --> 40:43.640
and, um, Miggletove were watching Pee-Wee's Playhouse the other night and I kinda

40:43.640 --> 40:44.700
caught a little bit of it.

40:44.700 --> 40:48.160
So frickin' funny. I mean, seriously,

40:48.160 --> 40:51.320
that was the kinda crack we were fed as kids. That's awesome.

40:51.320 --> 40:54.920
I know that show is that show is badass anyway

40:54.920 --> 40:58.080
I have remember being so freaked out cuz what was the Cowboys name

40:58.080 --> 41:03.100
I don't know but it wasn't Lawrence Fisher in the place there was

41:03.100 --> 41:08.440
cowboy Bob I someone in chat is only being young and being freaked out by

41:08.440 --> 41:08.960
Curtis

41:08.960 --> 41:12.840
tell me Curtis thank you doctor saying that he are you he says I can't do the

41:12.840 --> 41:15.080
pajama party cuz asleep in the nude

41:15.080 --> 41:19.480
Wow I remember

41:19.480 --> 41:22.600
being so traumatized by this when I was little

41:22.600 --> 41:25.840
and I really traumatized thinking you know he's

41:25.840 --> 41:29.800
he's naked you know what fuckin traumatized me about peewee

41:29.800 --> 41:33.440
Herman and all that stuff when I was little is the movie Peewee's Big

41:33.440 --> 41:34.120
Adventure

41:34.120 --> 41:37.640
you remember the scene when he gets in the truck and there's large Marge

41:37.640 --> 41:42.360
yeah story and then it's just the face she does the face and it looked

41:42.360 --> 41:45.860
a lot like this the whole thing

41:45.860 --> 41:47.860
It was dark and scary.

41:47.860 --> 41:49.860
It scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.

41:49.860 --> 41:51.860
I mean, my god.

41:51.860 --> 41:53.860
No wonder I came out so fucked up. Alright, anyway.

41:53.860 --> 41:55.860
Anyways, uh...

41:55.860 --> 41:57.860
Sorry.

41:57.860 --> 41:59.860
Tonight's been a night of randomness. Can I have the last cookie?

42:01.860 --> 42:03.860
Give Rob the cookie!

42:03.860 --> 42:05.860
On to other things.

42:05.860 --> 42:07.860
You know, there are other game networks out there

42:07.860 --> 42:09.860
other than G4TV

42:09.860 --> 42:11.860
and even G4, you might not even

42:11.860 --> 42:13.860
consider a game network anymore, but

42:13.860 --> 42:20.640
one of those is actually put out by Voom HD, and they have a channel called Gameplay HD.

42:20.640 --> 42:26.120
And they're actually going to be adding coverage for the World Series of Video Games, Microsoft's

42:26.120 --> 42:30.440
Project Anthem 3 tournament, and NCSoft's Guild War Factions competition.

42:30.440 --> 42:36.440
And they're going to be having a bunch of different kind of like ESPN type of coverage

42:36.440 --> 42:37.660
on this.

42:37.660 --> 42:41.640
And it's kind of interesting that they're going to be giving so much coverage to this

42:41.640 --> 42:42.640
kind of stuff.

42:42.640 --> 42:47.280
Um, I'm gonna give another cheap plug for our buddies at all games. I'm Scott and Lawrence had

42:49.020 --> 42:53.120
One of the guys I'm sorry, I forgot his name from gameplay HD on their show

42:53.620 --> 42:56.940
Last week and I know it got on dig like it was a really big deal

42:56.940 --> 43:01.100
I even got on dig but go check out their archives all games calm and listen to the interview

43:01.900 --> 43:03.900
Because it's great

43:04.340 --> 43:10.420
Gameplay HD knows what they're doing. This channel needs to make it big. I mean right now they're stuck on satellite

43:10.420 --> 43:15.700
I guess but it sounds like they have plans to expand which is good. I hope it happens fast for them

43:16.060 --> 43:20.380
I feel sad because we have Comcast cable here in this part of town

43:20.380 --> 43:23.980
So as long as this is seen as a competition to g4

43:23.980 --> 43:27.060
we probably get it anytime soon, but I'm gonna cross my fingers because

43:27.940 --> 43:30.140
It sounds like they know what they're doing with this network

43:30.140 --> 43:35.700
And I'm very excited to see what comes of it and I think a lot of us that feel like g4 was a joke

43:36.460 --> 43:38.460
in its later years anyway

43:38.460 --> 43:42.460
are going to be much happier by what Gameplay HD is going to bring.

43:42.460 --> 43:44.460
So, check it out.

43:44.460 --> 43:48.460
So, basically this agreement right now with Gameplay HD, like I said,

43:48.460 --> 43:52.460
includes the three circuits of the 2006 World Series of Video Games.

43:52.460 --> 44:01.460
The Land War competition in Louisville, Kentucky, which is being held June 16th through the 19th, 2006.

44:01.460 --> 44:05.460
And it will be airing on the channel September 13th through the 15th.

44:05.460 --> 44:31.460
DreamHack LAN party in Jokopin, Sweden, I guess, which was held June 17th through the 21st, and will be airing on the 28th and 29th of September, as well as the Intel Summer Championship in Dallas, which was held back in July 5th through the 9th, and still will be determined when they're going to actually put it on there.

44:31.460 --> 44:35.700
lots of stuff for the World Series of video game and then of course PGR3

44:35.700 --> 44:38.940
and Guild Wars. It should be interesting.

44:38.940 --> 44:44.060
Very interesting. You know, they sound like ESPN for games.

44:44.060 --> 44:48.540
That is so awesome. That's what they needed. That's what Arena on G4 always needed to be.

44:48.540 --> 44:52.780
They're a really, you know, young company. I mean, they just launched the network

44:52.780 --> 44:56.780
back in February, February 1st. Well, when you listen to the guy on the interview,

44:56.780 --> 45:02.780
He's a gamer! Perfect! That's what we need! Is a game station run by a gamer? Who would have thought?

45:02.780 --> 45:08.780
I don't think he runs it, but I don't remember exactly the relation, but I apologize, but I'm going off the top of my head. I don't have any notes on that.

45:08.780 --> 45:17.780
But if you do happen to get Dish Network and you have HD, the channel can be found on Dish Channel 9485.

45:17.780 --> 45:21.780
Seriously? It makes me want to switch to satellite. Why not?

45:21.780 --> 45:26.780
The only reason is because I save on the internet by having the game on the internet through the same company.

45:26.780 --> 45:29.780
And I live in an apartment and it's kind of hard to get satellite here.

45:29.780 --> 45:31.780
But I'm seriously thinking about it for when I move.

45:31.780 --> 45:32.780
Which is soon.

45:32.780 --> 45:34.780
Thinking about it. We'll see.

45:34.780 --> 45:36.780
Don't you get TiVo? Or now it's DirecTV.

45:36.780 --> 45:37.780
Now it's DirecTV.

45:37.780 --> 45:41.780
And I want to apologize because I think a couple weeks ago on the show I said it was DirecTV that had Gameplay HD.

45:41.780 --> 45:44.780
And I keep forgetting there's two competing companies.

45:44.780 --> 45:46.780
So I apologize for my satellite ignorance.

45:46.780 --> 45:50.780
But keep in mind when you live in an apartment, it's a little harder to get satellite.

45:50.780 --> 45:55.940
Anyway, now we kind of saved this for towards the end of the show, because I'll be damned

45:55.940 --> 46:00.480
if it doesn't seem like every week we're hearing about some damn Wii button, Wii flap, Wii

46:00.480 --> 46:02.820
secret compartment that you can put your Wii in.

46:02.820 --> 46:04.400
I don't know what they're coming...

46:04.400 --> 46:05.400
Your weed?

46:05.400 --> 46:06.400
Get it?

46:06.400 --> 46:07.400
Huh?

46:07.400 --> 46:08.400
Anything?

46:08.400 --> 46:09.400
Har.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.400
Har.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.400
Well, get this.

46:11.400 --> 46:14.660
There was a new promo picture in the latest issue of Nintendo Power that seems to indicate

46:14.660 --> 46:18.180
that there is yet another damn Wii button.

46:18.180 --> 46:21.860
And it looks like it's some type of new Z button, kind of like the one that's on the

46:21.860 --> 46:25.420
GameCube's controller, like a little teeny shoulder thing.

46:25.420 --> 46:28.940
No idea how the hell you're going to reach it, because you'd have to have another thumb

46:28.940 --> 46:34.420
growing out of your thumb to hit it, but maybe it's like a volume control for the internal

46:34.420 --> 46:35.420
speaker?

46:35.420 --> 46:37.460
That's a theory that's going around right now.

46:37.460 --> 46:40.980
But if that's going to be one you're supposed to frequently hit in the game, that is going

46:40.980 --> 46:45.780
to be a pain in the ass, as if playing with a remote control is not going to be weird

46:45.780 --> 46:46.780
enough.

46:46.780 --> 46:50.140
played 83 it felt okay to me it didn't feel like the wrist cramp that it

46:50.140 --> 46:51.300
sounded like on paper

46:51.300 --> 46:54.620
I don't know if it's just me that felt that way interesting

46:54.620 --> 47:01.060
alright anyway we're gonna open up the Skype line right now it's www.orangeloungeloungeradio.com

47:01.060 --> 47:03.460

47:20.660 --> 47:21.660
tonight?

47:21.660 --> 47:22.660
There's one!

47:22.660 --> 47:23.660
What's up?

47:23.660 --> 47:24.660
At least from me.

47:24.660 --> 47:29.620
The Luminous 2 soundtrack has been revealed, I'd also like to thank Tiger Call for the

47:29.620 --> 47:32.620
link.

47:32.620 --> 47:38.540
Going to be in Luminous 2, we have Beck Black Tambourine, Black Eyed Peas Pump It, Chemical

47:38.540 --> 47:43.060

47:51.140 --> 47:56.380
Law, and so Random Song by New Order, which New Order I can't go wrong with.

47:56.380 --> 47:57.380
That is so weird.

47:57.380 --> 48:01.100
It's just a weird lineup, but Luminous is definitely going mainstream.

48:01.100 --> 48:02.980
As long as Mondo Grosso is coming back, I'm cool.

48:02.980 --> 48:06.220
Well those actually are going to be the ones with videos.

48:06.220 --> 48:11.460
Also ones without videos are going to be Junkie XL, Breezer, Stigmato, Inc. with Reality Check,

48:11.460 --> 48:16.060
And also there will be more tracks from the Japanese artists, Mondo Grosso, Kenishi, and

48:16.060 --> 48:17.060
Tech Writers.

48:17.060 --> 48:18.060
All right.

48:18.060 --> 48:22.340
Well, let's go Skyplane, we're getting a call.

48:22.340 --> 48:24.660
There's a couple calls have already come in that we've missed, but we want to get the

48:24.660 --> 48:25.900
Luminous 2 news out there.

48:25.900 --> 48:26.900
So call back.

48:26.900 --> 48:28.620
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:28.620 --> 48:29.620
Who's this?

48:29.620 --> 48:30.620
Hi.

48:30.620 --> 48:31.620
It's Ravenstaufen.

48:31.620 --> 48:32.620
Hey, Ravenstaufen.

48:32.620 --> 48:33.820
What's on your mind, buddy?

48:33.820 --> 48:34.820
The UMD.

48:34.820 --> 48:38.720
What do you want to talk about with UMDs?

48:38.720 --> 48:41.920
I want to talk about the UMD is dead because of

48:41.920 --> 48:45.600
BitTorrent. Really? What's your theory there?

48:45.600 --> 48:49.680
Why? I mentioned this before and I said

48:49.680 --> 48:52.680
that I've been getting all my movies and all my stuff from BitTorrent

48:52.680 --> 48:56.120
and this is what someone should do. They should put everything on BitTorrent.

48:56.120 --> 49:00.400
So you basically admit that you steal your movies?

49:00.400 --> 49:04.120
Yes. Which is fun. Look, at least you're honest, okay? I don't, you know, I'm not

49:04.120 --> 49:07.300
trying to say it makes you a bad person or whatever but you know you're

49:07.300 --> 49:10.520
what the MPAA is not happy with right now.

49:10.520 --> 49:14.180
So let me ask you this, let me turn around and ask you this,

49:14.180 --> 49:17.720
what would be a way that you would legitimately pay for movies?

49:17.720 --> 49:21.060
What would make you stop using BitTorrent and legitimately pay for movies?

49:21.060 --> 49:24.540
It's probably going to sound really cheesy as hell, but

49:24.540 --> 49:29.060
the Sony Connect service, but I really think they got a good model and I think

49:29.060 --> 49:29.820
it's gonna work.

49:29.820 --> 49:33.900
Okay, so like on one hand you give Sony a little bit of shit for the UMD

49:33.900 --> 49:38.220
but on the other hand, give them some props for the Sony Connect. Yeah, I think they got a good

49:38.220 --> 49:42.720
good plan going with this. If they tried to connect us with the Xbox Live model

49:42.720 --> 49:45.840
but not like it, like charge like little games for the PSP

49:45.840 --> 49:49.580
and like movies, I think they really have something to go with

49:49.580 --> 49:52.540
but that's just me.

49:52.540 --> 49:56.100
It's interesting you bring up Xbox because I'm waiting for the day when

49:56.100 --> 49:59.920
Xbox does this. All they need is a bigger hard drive on that thing and you know

49:59.920 --> 50:02.320
with the active downloads and everything you could

50:02.320 --> 50:05.800
totally and easily download movies on that thing hell

50:05.800 --> 50:11.040
you can already download you know music videos in the little behind the scenes

50:11.040 --> 50:12.440
clips in HD and I

50:12.440 --> 50:16.000
hell I'm downloading HD clips just because they're HD things

50:16.000 --> 50:19.560
that I can look at on my HDTV and go ooh pretty you know

50:19.560 --> 50:23.200
just imagine when they start adding movies in HD digitally I mean

50:23.200 --> 50:27.880
I don't know I mean I hate to change the topic to Xbox but I just kinda keep

50:27.880 --> 50:29.640
thinking about it's only a matter of time

50:29.640 --> 50:30.640
It's only a matter of time

50:30.640 --> 50:32.860
before Microsoft does something like this, I think.

50:32.860 --> 50:33.740
I agree.

50:33.740 --> 50:35.100
Oh, one more thing.

50:35.100 --> 50:35.940
What's up?

50:36.940 --> 50:38.900
I was surfing singular.com

50:38.900 --> 50:41.460
and they have a little ringtone

50:41.460 --> 50:44.280
for the internet is for porn from Avenue Q.

50:45.740 --> 50:47.520
Why did that make you think of us?

50:49.260 --> 50:50.820
Because it's so random.

50:50.820 --> 50:53.200
It's just like, and I'm going to purchase it soon.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.060
So everyone that I walked down the street

50:55.060 --> 50:56.400
when my phone rings has gone,

50:56.400 --> 50:59.300
the internet is really, really great.

50:59.300 --> 51:00.900
for porn

51:00.900 --> 51:05.060
wow we have some crazy listeners at OLR also one of her cage band songs

51:05.060 --> 51:07.520
I know ages ago ages ago anyway

51:07.520 --> 51:10.680
Ravenstaufen thanks so much for the call we appreciate your insight alright have a good one

51:10.680 --> 51:13.120
and I hope they don't come after you and sue you okay

51:13.120 --> 51:17.160
oh they won't it's just a pseudonym not your real name if they try to sue you

51:17.160 --> 51:19.560
you can counter sue them for invasion of privacy

51:19.560 --> 51:21.580
and for search without a warrant

51:21.580 --> 51:27.080
thanks dark sakura you're welcome legal advice from orange lounge radio

51:27.080 --> 51:31.080
you go to law school? No I've taken a lot of business law but honestly the people

51:31.080 --> 51:37.660
that were counter suing the RIAA and the MPAA were using those tactics for

51:37.660 --> 51:42.220
counter suits. Let's go to another call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's

51:42.220 --> 51:48.240
this? It's Legend of Zaku. Hi buddy what's on your mind? Um just the fact that you

51:48.240 --> 51:52.080
know seconding the whole UMD thing and the whole format wars as we'd like to

51:52.080 --> 51:56.720
see it. Honestly at the end of the day you know it's gonna hurt the consumer

51:56.720 --> 52:01.520
they're going to stick with the DVD regardless because no one's ready to shift right no one's

52:01.520 --> 52:06.640
ready to shift to a new format especially when there's like god knows how many are already out

52:06.640 --> 52:13.840
there should the playstation 3 have had a umd slot um it really i i don't know i don't then

52:13.840 --> 52:19.280
they'll be copying nintendo and trying to you try to play a portable gaming system on a console

52:19.920 --> 52:25.280
like you do with the game boy no i'm talking about for movies oh for me i guess gaming is one thing

52:25.280 --> 52:28.640
I guess, hypothetically, why not play the games too? Why not?

52:28.640 --> 52:32.280
Yeah, I mean... How's that copying Nintendo?

52:32.280 --> 52:36.560
Because they did it with the Game Boy, you know, the Game Boy player, the little

52:36.560 --> 52:37.200
device...

52:37.200 --> 52:40.200
I don't know if I call it copying, I just call it smart.

52:40.200 --> 52:43.660
Make your games playable on more systems

52:43.660 --> 52:47.480
or more and more places. Oh well, whatever. It's fine.

52:47.480 --> 52:50.920
But the bottom line is this, I mean,

52:50.920 --> 52:55.160
I mean, Hollywood is pretty much split on both formats. It's like,

52:55.160 --> 52:57.160
Half is gonna support you know

52:57.440 --> 53:02.680
HD DVD the other half is blu-ray and the same thing happened with DVD and Divx though

53:02.680 --> 53:05.940
And look how long the war lasted well Divx got out

53:05.940 --> 53:12.640
And you know only lasted three years while DVDs still running because Divx downright sucked. I mean the model was was

53:13.240 --> 53:19.080
Idiotic it was doomed to fail whereas DVD. You know people you know it wasn't easy to go for it

53:19.080 --> 53:24.480
I wasn't all blu-ray idiotic. I just don't really know enough about it, which is just childish

53:24.480 --> 53:28.640
it's just it's just sophomoric all right any other thoughts you want to share

53:28.640 --> 53:35.500
with our listeners let me see the fact that I've really never got your opinion

53:35.500 --> 53:41.820
on how mobile gaming and you know what's your take on mobile gaming okay I can

53:41.820 --> 53:44.720
say a lot about mobile gaming I'm not a big fan of it what do you want to know

53:44.720 --> 53:49.920
well granted I already started a job in the mobile gaming industry make games

53:49.920 --> 53:55.260
that don't suck so don't oh yeah don't got licenses for stuff okay don't put

53:55.260 --> 54:00.020
the games that were built for PlayStations and we're not done stop

54:00.020 --> 54:04.020
don't put those games on mobile it doesn't work the game that I'm working

54:04.020 --> 54:07.700
on already sold a million I'm working on the Spanish version of it what it

54:07.700 --> 54:13.500
bejeweled no it's it's more like a it's a question base game more like a game

54:13.500 --> 54:17.760
show see those the type of games that work on cell phones are the type of

54:17.760 --> 54:22.600
of games that you play on PopCap that's where it's at for mobile games like the

54:22.600 --> 54:29.080
little niche one yeah casual games, uber casual games yes those are the

54:29.080 --> 54:31.240
types of games that work on mobile because those type of people playing

54:31.240 --> 54:36.440
mobile games are uber casual gamers the gamer gamers have a DS or a PSP right

54:36.440 --> 54:40.600
unless they created some sort of cell phone similar you know exceeding the

54:40.600 --> 54:45.320
capabilities of the n-gauge and it had you know the marketing and

54:45.320 --> 54:49.320
Well, the problem with the N-Gage is that it was a phone first, gaming system second,

54:49.320 --> 54:52.320
but yet it thought it was a gaming system first in the market.

54:52.320 --> 54:54.320
Yeah, two platforms in the N-Gage.

54:54.320 --> 54:58.320
One is the proprietary one, which the games are based on,

54:58.320 --> 55:01.320
and also Java, if I recall correctly, Symbian,

55:01.320 --> 55:05.320
so it was three platforms, two of which were pretty open.

55:05.320 --> 55:08.320
So you're working on a Spanish version of a game, Habla Español?

55:08.320 --> 55:12.320
Yeah, I understand a lot more than I speak.

55:12.320 --> 55:15.400
more than I speak, I lost my fluency when I came here.

55:15.400 --> 55:16.240
That's fine.

55:16.240 --> 55:17.480
All right, buddy, we gotta let you go,

55:17.480 --> 55:19.080

55:30.640 --> 55:32.120
Oh, and here comes a call.

55:32.120 --> 55:35.040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

55:35.040 --> 55:36.600
Hi, this is Eddie.

55:36.600 --> 55:39.160
Hey, Eddie, what's on your mind, buddy?

55:39.160 --> 55:40.500
Yeah, I just wanted to comment

55:40.500 --> 55:47.780
like another part of the PSP okay yeah basically what I'm really confused about

55:47.780 --> 55:53.900
is how Sony is doing this whole huge you know homebrew war on the PSP right mm-hmm

55:53.900 --> 56:01.180
and on the ps3 they're now using Linux as their operating system on the ps3

56:01.180 --> 56:07.420
which is kind of opening the door for you know homebrew so why is it that

56:07.420 --> 56:13.260
they're battling homebrew on platform and then like welcoming it with open arms on another.

56:13.260 --> 56:16.700
I'm gonna throw this to our homebrew expert. Loki, do you have a thought on this?

56:16.700 --> 56:19.580
Because the PlayStation 3 is a computer.

56:21.180 --> 56:22.620
Why would that- so?

56:23.500 --> 56:24.220
So that's why.

56:24.220 --> 56:27.260
Why does Sony have one policy here and another policy here?

56:27.260 --> 56:30.540
Because I'm sure that they're, you know, thinking that their bases are covered with,

56:31.660 --> 56:35.900
you know, the PlayStation 3 and the fact that the PlayStation 3 needs all the help it can get to

56:35.900 --> 56:42.080
sell so how well okay but how long before a Nintendo emulator comes out for

56:42.080 --> 56:49.660
the ps3 two days well exactly then then shouldn't like actually happens

56:49.660 --> 56:55.180
shouldn't like Sony be battling that too and it's gonna be a lot harder for them

56:55.180 --> 56:58.720
to do since they're using Linux and it's hard and you know and if I remember

56:58.720 --> 57:03.080
correctly that they can also boot into other languages not well not as

57:03.080 --> 57:07.160
operating systems you know they're even saying they can maybe install you know

57:07.160 --> 57:12.140
Windows or OS X or something on there which I don't know that's gonna be hard

57:12.140 --> 57:15.620
to regulate unless they have some sort of crippled version of Linux on there

57:15.620 --> 57:18.560
that doesn't allow certain things to run or something I don't know how they're

57:18.560 --> 57:24.180
gonna do that yeah ps3 version running Windows that that'll be the day it'd be

57:24.180 --> 57:30.060
the great irony well yeah that's all I wanted to say all right well thank you

57:30.060 --> 57:32.940
very much for the call have a good one and we'll see what happens with Sony's

57:32.940 --> 57:37.380
policy. I kind of think the gimped version of Linux is a more... I think

57:37.380 --> 57:40.300
that's kind of what we're looking at is the reality of what's gonna happen, but

57:40.300 --> 57:46.680
we'll see. Yeah, I guess so. Thank you. All right, not a problem. Thanks for the call. All right, sorry, I'm

57:46.680 --> 57:49.940
trying to fix my mouse here. It just kind of... the batteries just died during that

57:49.940 --> 57:54.420
call there, so I'm trying to get reorganized here. Sorry about that.

57:54.420 --> 57:57.540
That's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight. Thank you guys so much for

57:57.540 --> 58:01.460
calling in. We appreciate your insight, and if you didn't get through tonight or

58:01.460 --> 58:05.140
or if you were that person that had connection problems, you can always leave us a voicemail.

58:05.140 --> 58:06.740
We love voicemails.

58:06.740 --> 58:09.580
And you can listen earlier in the show if you want to see how to leave us a voicemail

58:09.580 --> 58:11.780
of the week and what our topic is this week.

58:11.780 --> 58:13.260
Any more last minute stories, folks?

58:13.260 --> 58:14.260
Yes.

58:14.260 --> 58:15.260
All right, Loki, what's up?

58:15.260 --> 58:16.580
Well, a couple things about the Wii.

58:16.580 --> 58:21.660
Because as I was mentioning in the story before, well, before about the secret pages on the

58:21.660 --> 58:23.780
Wii, I did find those finally.

58:23.780 --> 58:25.660
Someone had them on FileShare.

58:25.660 --> 58:27.140
Or let's see here.

58:27.140 --> 58:31.200
We've got a few things with, of course, they're saying the Nintendo Wi-Fi service is going

58:31.200 --> 58:38.160
to be free just like it is for the DS and they were saying you know of course

58:38.160 --> 58:43.640
the frame code system and that type of thing. What I also found was interesting

58:43.640 --> 58:51.160
they renamed WarioWare to WarioWare Dojo now instead of Brawl so that's kind of

58:51.160 --> 58:55.960
neat or not WarioWare Super Smash Brothers what the hell am I talking

58:55.960 --> 59:02.640
about. Anyways, on top of that, that wasn't the most neat thing I found. There was kind

59:02.640 --> 59:11.720
of an interview in GamePro with the people behind Red Steel. And they were talking about

59:11.720 --> 59:18.400
the multiplayer. And basically the creative director, Nicholas Eppert, he had this to

59:18.400 --> 59:23.520
say about the multiplayer. He says, you'll have up to four players. If they play together

59:23.520 --> 59:31.720
in split screen we can only say that the fight will not only be on screen. So that's maybe

59:31.720 --> 59:35.780
either referring to the fact that six people on the couch flailing about, it's gonna be

59:35.780 --> 59:42.700
very difficult to do in that kind of environment, or that there's gonna be some sort of different

59:42.700 --> 59:48.220
type of multiplayer in room or something. I'm sorry, games on Mario Party Wii are about

59:48.220 --> 59:52.260
to get very violent in this house because Mario Party, as it is, is a cutthroat competition

59:52.260 --> 59:53.260
around these parts.

59:53.260 --> 59:58.160
Mario Party Wii is just begging for violence, it's going to be sad.

59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.860
I was just, now that my mouse works again, I was reading some comments there in chat

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:06.940
room and Black Boy commented, I need OSX on my PS3.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:10.180
Kind of a shout out to an old operating system that some folks have forgot about.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:12.820
Is that the same Black Boy I met at Arena once?

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:13.820
I wonder.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.620
If it is, hi buddy.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:22.060
Some other things I was going to mention, Kojima of course is at Comic Con and one of

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:27.140
the fans asked him a few things about Metal Gear Solid, including, well they were saying

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:32.260
that it's going to be in playable form at next C3, which duh, and that it's going to

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:38.440
be in 1080p and there was no way for it to fit on DVD-9.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.840
So I mean that's not too much, not a big surprise.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:47.760
So I think we talked about this last week about how the Xbox 360 is possibly going to

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:57.120
get a bundle with Project Gotham Racing 3, a 1250 point card, and 3 months of Xbox Live

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.120
Gold.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.120
Well it's sort of been confirmed.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.360
It's starting to appear in retailers computers now.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:08.280
They have the PGR 3 bundle in Toys R Us computer.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:17.560
being sold for about the same price as a premium system and also was confirmed to be, let's

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:25.240
see, that was in like a Canadian Toys R Us, apparently there's another chain called BJ's

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:30.240
that's going to be carrying it in Circuit City's flyer in the newspaper.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.760
They show the price for $489.99 US for the Project Gotham Racing 3 bundle.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.500
It says it includes a pro console, a second wireless controller, play and charge kit,

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.500
and a copy of PGR3.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:46.140
But that sounds more like a bundle that's being done through that site.

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:52.020
Apparently online they have the same type of thing, and there's like a $30 off web deal

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:53.460
or something, I don't know.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:59.460
But something that may be coming soon, who knows, we'll probably find out pretty soon.

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:05.260
I'm just reading in chat right now, DJ Jenai said, I downloaded the Paris Hilton game,

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:08.500
And PK Akira 88 goes, get out!

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:12.260
Somebody said something and PK Akira 88 says, no, I mean get off my internet.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.260
Haha.

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:14.260
Aww.

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.260
Harsh folks in chat room.

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.340
Hey, I got a question for you, because you were just talking about Project Gotham, so

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:24.820
speaking of racing games, somebody was sending me a private message, I think it was CKY Mike,

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.660
asking about Burnout 5 on PS3.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.900
Have you heard anything about Burnout?

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.500
No, it's probably coming out in the fall, that would be my guess.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.380
So it is coming for Playstation 3?

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.380
I'm sure they're...

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:41.380
Duh! They're coming out with another Burnout game. I mean, it's gonna be Burnout something. It is coming out probably in the fall.

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:49.380
That's kind of a given. It's just like saying, oh yeah, next year Madden 08's coming out. I mean, come on. It's not a big surprise.

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:58.380
But my guess, if anything, it would be probably coming out in March-ish, because that's when the Xbox 360 one came out last year.

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:03.460
obviously it's not coming out in September like it did last year for the

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:08.540
current gen stuff so if I were to guess that's a March probably for burnout I

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:13.820
know there's a lot of stuff September is gonna be a packed month for games in

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:19.500
October is even worse I mean just Final Fantasy 12 crack fine coming finally

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:23.860
coming in October yeah you won't see me no you can push more and more towards

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:28.620
November. God damn them. So yeah. Well it's coming out Halloween, how much further back

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:32.820
can you push to November? I don't know. But anyway. I swear to God, Squeenix, if you rob

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:39.000
me of Final Fantasy for another year, I am, it's not gonna be pretty. You need to stomp

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.120
and pout. I will stomp and pout in front of the Squeenix building and there will be video

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:49.400
on YouTube. You know, all it comes down to me is just Saints Row and fucking Dead Rising.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.840
gonna be my games for August and I don't know there's a lot of games coming out

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.680
in August but a lot that I don't want like Bomberman X zero I mean it looks

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:08.120
like Bomberman and so that could be kind of fun but uh I found out I gotta buy

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:13.920
cars on the 360 for Nelly. Why? For achievement points? No cuz she want but I will get

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.520
achievement points on that no but she wants she wants that game. What's up with

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.340
Nelly getting into games lately you've talked about her playing bejeweled

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:24.900
cloning Clyde now she must play cars is she she wants me to buy elite beat agents

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:28.900
for her is she slowly becoming a gamer no is this marriage thing corrupting her

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:42.240
ChromeHounds squad. Maybe we should do like an OLR army. Battle! Battle Royale! I'll buy

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:49.040
the game just to blow the shit out of Scott's mech. And Bobby! Bring it Bobby! See that's

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.960
the only thing about ChromeHounds online is I wonder if they actually just have multiplayer,

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.840
like standard multiplayer, not that online, perpetual online thing. I gotta check that

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.920
out because I haven't really delved into the multiplayer that much. Hmm. No, I haven't

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.000
That would be fun though an inner show battle royale. I'm all for that

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.760
I'm all for an inner show battle royale at some point on one of those games and stuff and we've talked about doing a

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:18.120
Tournament thingy using all game, but we'll talk. We'll save that for another show. We want to end tonight's show

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.320
So have a great night

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:26.680
Thank you so much for downloading us and supporting internet radio. You guys are awesome and we do this show for you

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.880
Have a great night. We'll see you next week.
