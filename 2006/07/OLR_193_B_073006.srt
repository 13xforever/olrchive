13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,820
which just moved to Monday nights at five o'clock Pacific Standard Time, eight o'clock

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,700
Eastern Standard Time.

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,760
And now let's get back into some gaming news.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,600
I'm going to start us off, if you guys are okay with that, Dark Soccer and Loki.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
I'm sorry, no.

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Okay, go ahead.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,400
We didn't talk a lot last segment about the Wii, so I want to bring up a story about the

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Wii.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,000
This is a rumor going around, and I emphasize the word rumor here, that Nintendo is sending

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,120
out free Wii dev kits.

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,200
It's a rumor from an insider that wrote to Kotaku.com.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,400
According to Kotaku, it seems Nintendo is giving Wii development kits to smaller studios.

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,940
A developer in a coastal American city apparently received a package from Nintendo, and nobody

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,760
was aware it was even inside, but the box was opened, and there was a Wii dev kit inside.

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,860
Now this could be seen multiple ways.

28
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,840
This might be a way for Wii to get indie developers to make games for the console, and it certainly

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,760
would show a shift in Nintendo's attitude towards third-party supporters, maybe recognizing

30
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,100
where some of the mistakes were with the GameCube.

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,540
It's kind of like, hey, we really want third parties, indies, everybody on board with this.

32
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,380
So certainly interesting if it's true, but it may not be true.

33
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,420
It's still a rumor at this time.

34
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,900
Well, the dev kits weren't that expensive anyways.

35
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,140
I think they were like grand or two.

36
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,140
I would hope not considering the hardware is supposed to not be as, you know, much.

37
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,500
Well, they put out a email now that has their DS lineup.

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,100
Oh, cool.

39
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,500
Here's what's coming out.

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,020
There is October 9th, Clubhouse Games, Nintendo's Dalmatian version on October 16th, October

41
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,500
23rd magical star sign, and 30th there's a Pokemon Ranger and Children of Mana, oooh

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,380
Children of Mana.

43
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,220
November 6th has Elite Beat Agents, 13th Yoshi's Island, December 4th is Custom Robo Arena

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,300
and Kirby's Squeak Squad.

45
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,900
You know what's pretty awesome about that Clubhouse Games?

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,900
It's over Wi-Fi with all 48 games that are going to be in it, and, which might come into

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,900
the show, PictoChat over Wi-Fi.

48
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,100
Oh, that's right, I remember hearing about that.

49
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,940
Isn't this game already out somewhere else?

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,940
It's called something else in other countries.

51
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,300
No, it's coming out in the UK.

52
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,820
It's called 48 Collection or something like that.

53
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,900
Because that's where, when I first read about the game, that's what it was called.

55
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,020
Now, none of these games are nothing spectacular, right?

56
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,020
No, it's like card games and stuff.

57
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,440
of those, like, Hoyle collections that are available on the PC, but being able to play

58
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,460
it over Wi-Fi with PictoChat, hooray, drawn genitalia galore while playing hearts.

59
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,460
Strip poker.

60
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,140
No, you can't do strip, that's for the Xbox 360 cam.

61
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,780
Oh, come on, you can do that over PictoChat, if you're a good enough artist.

62
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,780
You're lame.

63
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,060
Well, we all know where games of strip poker break out.

64
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,340
Summer camp! And Nintendo is actually holding a summer camp of their own.

65
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,420
It's called Camp Hyrule. Now, it's not a real camp.

66
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,120
I mean, obviously it's about video games. Come on, the idea is to stay indoors.

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,300
It's a virtual camp. Now, not a lot is known about this. Camp Hyrule is going to

68
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,540
have activities like

69
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,220
chats, games, art activities, and other surprises, courtesy of Nintendo Power.

70
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,580
If you want to sign up you can get a virtual cabin

71
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,980
and you're going to share this with other gamers and I guess they'll be also like

72
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,380
maybe a camp counselor who works for Nintendo

73
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,540
who's... I have no idea. Nobody really knows what to expect from this thing.

74
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,900
There's a quote here though,

75
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,780
if you like to talk about video games, play practical jokes and rub elbows with

76
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,260
Nintendo's expert gamers,

77
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,020
then get ready to meet new friends at Nintendo's Camp Hyrule 2006

78
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,300
and win prizes like t-shirts and magazines. Subscriptions

79
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,260
while you're at it. Coming the week of August 14th through 18th, 2006,

80
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,260
the rumored theme this year might be the Legend of Zelda, the Phantom Hourglass,

81
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,620
Nintendo Wii, and Super Mario Galaxy. Interesting because I noticed in Dark

82
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,620
Sakura's list of what's coming out for the DS,

83
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,500
Phantom Hourglass wasn't even there. So, I don't know what that means.

84
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,180
Well, there was rumors that it was going to be delayed till next year.

85
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,540
Oh, now Blaze Revolution in chat says Camp Hyrule is nothing new, they've been doing

86
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,540
it for at least five years.

87
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,540
Yeah, they've been doing it for a while.

88
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,540
Really?

89
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,540
I've never heard of it.

90
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,540
What do they do?

91
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,540
I don't know.

92
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,540
How did they miss this?

93
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,540
We've been doing this show how long now?

94
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,540
And I've never heard of this.

95
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,540
Ever.

96
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,540
Well, this is on the Nintendo site, nintendo.com, so if you don't read that site, you probably

97
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
won't.

98
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,260
Well, I do sometimes, but I don't know, alright, fine.

99
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,980
So I've apparently been living in a cave the past ten years, so fine.

100
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,420
Are any of you guys doing Camp Hyrule?

101
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,420
Nope.

102
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,900
No, I didn't sign up either. I was like investment all the time you might

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,320
Somebody needs to do it. Someone has to you know what you need to go represent the oil army for us. Why not?

104
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,140
So I'm hey, I I remember Nestor and Howard I could get on hit the damn show

105
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,400
That's me. We need it. We need our folks. We need an OLR cabin. We need fuck it

106
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,680
We need camp OLR. Come on, Ol army assemble. It'll be on that. You know chess board in front of your apartment complex

107
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:02,680
I totally want to have a Camp-O-L-R. That would be fun. Actually, I want to do a real, like, con thing or something, but we'll see. Someday.

108
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Orange Con?

109
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Orange Con. That would be rad. Someday, when we have lots and lots of money, we'll see what happens.

110
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
No.

111
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Anyways, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, but one thing that did happen is an AMD and ATI merger.

112
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,560
merger. Thank you for your enthusiasm, by the way. Yeah, I don't think that's going

113
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:32,360
to happen anytime soon. By the way, great transition. Love you, Loki. Anyways, yes,

114
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:41,520
the $5.4 billion transaction took place last week with AMD purchasing ATI, and now you've

115
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,560
got a big combination of both processors and graphics chips. Where will this lead? Who

116
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,000
Who the fuck knows? That's where it's gonna lead.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,360
Probably gonna see some ATI, you know,

118
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,740
based graphics chips

119
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,320
on AMD motherboards.

120
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,680
So this is great news though for your PC gamer, I guess, but

121
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,520
I always used to buy AMD chips for my PCs

122
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,520
and ATI cards, so I guess that works. Excellent.

123
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,320
well what I'm worried about what if you're a AMD user with an Nvidia

124
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,800
video card who then

125
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,560
fuck you you suck! I don't know. Go buy a Mac

126
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,720
Oh snap! Go buy a Mac!

127
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,320
Hold on here! Let's get back on the Sandy bus!

128
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,480
Okay listen. I get my Mac

129
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,120
in very soon. God dammit, just when I thought we had

130
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,240
with the hate mail for loki would stop coming in

131
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,600
anyways

132
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,920
how about we just turn this right around how about we turn this bus around right

133
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,480
now

134
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,720
we're talking we're talking about pc's and gaming that mac wouldn't be in there

135
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
gee i wish somebody had a story to save us right about now

136
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,960
you know that female otaku need love too really in japan you can rent a friend

137
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,000
wait wait wait are they horny gamer girls

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,320
yeah did you find out about this on myspace no it's on kotaku okay just as bad i'm kidding

139
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:30,800
we love you they're cool five dollars no no it's actually 12 000 yen for two and a half hours of

140
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,800
friendship wait now but this is not like a a whore thing this is no no girls for other girls

141
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,720
this is called the secret otaku support commission they rent out women who are

142
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,000
knowledgeable in video game culture to girl gamers who got no friends if I want

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,840
to pay for friends I join a frat as it says sorry so many college memories just

144
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,680
came back to me as it said by Seiji Hirokawa who is their creator and

145
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,780
operator funny that it's a man this is we're an otaku dispatch agency that

146
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:14,000
caters exclusively to a female clientele. Many women otaku don't have other women otaku

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,760
to talk to and they get pretty lonely. That's where we come in. They charge 12,000 yen,

148
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,760
basically 120 bucks for two and a half hours of friendship. Are you a lonely, lonely girl?

149
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,760
Pick up the phone! Have you been a bad, lonely girl playing your video games all night long?

150
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,160
Do you want someone to play your games with?

151
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,640
Do you want someone to come over and have a pillow fight with you?

152
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,720
Well Otaku, female rental service is for you!

153
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,720
This is very... I don't know, there's just something kinda scary about it. Maybe it's just

154
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,280
that cultural difference or whatever,

155
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,440
but there's something almost predatory about this whole thing. I don't know.

156
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,640
Is it just me? Jamie, would you pay for this? No, I have friends.

157
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,600
That's true! I'd pay for that. That's right, you had a pillow fight this weekend, I forgot.

158
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:11,120
Anyway, you know, I'm not too surprised that a man is selling women to, you know, clientele.

159
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,280
I mean pimps have been around for ages, so.

160
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:22,840
But what I'm really surprised about is why an Asian chick that likes games and otaku

161
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,540
stuff can't get some nerdy guy to be her friend, I mean, come on.

162
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,880
That's where we need to be importing them, okay?

163
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,940
like you know there's Russian wives we need to get the Asian gamer chicks to

164
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,480
come in import them in you know and cuz we've got the demand here they have a

165
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:47,580
supply there it's perfect screw that just export me I'm done with that yes

166
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,880
please can we look into that I'm just kidding

167
00:10:49,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Wow that's awesome that is excellent news I'm scared now the chat rooms got

168
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,360
the wrong idea of me we have juiced in in our chat room I don't know how else

169
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,800
to pronounce I think it's just Justin but it's an elite speak it looks like

170
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,040
juiced in just it says I think sky is suited well for a phone sex line that's

171
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,280
kind of scary to me that's not that's not my bag baby

172
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:27,080
Anyways, speaking of women, a certain game coming out soon, Dead Rising, which is awesome,

173
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:33,240
rewards you for taking erotic pictures of women.

174
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,360
Actually one of the genres of pictures you can take in the game, besides horror and drama

175
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,280
and stuff like that, is erotic, erotica, and they have a perfect picture of one of the

176
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,220
leads in there I guess in fishnet stockings and lingerie and you're taking pictures of

177
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,520
her and one of the focal points is her breasts and it's perfect and you get prestige points

178
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
for that.

179
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,920
It's kind of like experience points in the games.

180
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:03,140
But it's kind of interesting though because you can also take erotic zombie pictures.

181
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,560
Erotic zombie pictures?

182
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Yes.

183
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,380
Erotic zombie pictures.

184
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,280
Why didn't they just call the game that?

185
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,160
Why didn't they just call the damn game Erotic Zombie Pictures?

186
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,160
You know how many more copies would have sold?

187
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Listen, this is an important Civil 2000 series, okay?

188
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,480
This is a cool game.

189
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
But how many more copies would have sold?

190
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,520
You know, Dead Rising, you had to tell me about what this game was about before I was

191
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
interested in it, and I actually had to see the preview.

192
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,640
But if you had told me there was a game on the market called, you know, Erotic Zombie

193
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,760
Pictures, I would have been like, say no more, sold, sold!

194
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,800
I didn't know that was your bag.

195
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:48,200
Well I think it's pretty awesome, but apparently you can also get points by just pretty much

196
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
doing everything.

197
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,600
I love this, this is actually translated from Famitsu magazine, and they have, it says,

198
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,960
and this is the exact, you know, English translation, if the sexy survivor you rescue by the chance

199
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,960
arrival which photographs the seductive scene because also sexy acquisition PP increases

200
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
PP being prestige points, you dirty bastards out there.

201
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,760
Okay, I, I'm, okay. Whether just the woman also, it is...

202
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,120
How can you not comment on that? How can you, how can you just overlook that? Blatant reference

203
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,120
there. Hey, the dead is rising.

204
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,160
Welcome to the last episode of Orange Launch Radio, everybody. It was lovely knowing you

205
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,120
these past four years. Unfortunately, the jokes, we've suffocated ourselves on the bad

206
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,160
jokes tonight, and we're dying.

207
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,120
It's going to be an awesome game.

208
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
It's going to be my fault!

209
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,440
It's going to be an awesome game. Just buy it for the awesomeness in the game. I mean,

210
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,280
I knew right away when they saw the little publicity shots of who the character is going

211
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:00,320
be in the game i mean we're talking like horny otaku you know women in this so i have a quote

212
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,080
from mystery science 3000 to quote okay in regards to the whole taking pictures of half naked girls

213
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:13,280
erotic zombie pictures yeah well whoopdy shit that that's that's your outlook on that aren't

214
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:20,000
you excited to be taking erotic pictures of zombies i love zombies but not that much

215
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,280
much. Bruce Campbell, yes. I need the human chin to come talk to me. Can you use, like,

216
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,000
because you can use anything to kill things in Dead Rising, right? Yes. Can you use pants?

217
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,640
I don't know. It depends on if you mean in the American sense or the British sense, because

218
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,960
if you use someone's stinky pants, then yes, probably. You can dress up like a little kid

219
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,440
and you can wear stinky pants. By the way, if Bruce Campbell is listening to this podcast,

220
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,360
hang out with us. We want to interview you.

221
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,500
I remember seeing in the preview that the guy was running around in his skivvies for

222
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,880
part of the little preview trailer. So did he kill someone with his pants? What did he

223
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,400
do?

224
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,540
He took his pants off.

225
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,160
It's more because of the erotic zombie pictures?

226
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:09,240
It's more free. I don't know. The real, like, it's just weird, okay? You take weird pictures

227
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,320
and stuff. I don't know how far it goes into the erotic stuff, but whatever.

228
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,240
Hey, hey, none of this shark jumping talk.

229
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Oh, Chat Room? No we haven't. No we haven't.

230
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,240
If we jump the shark, that happened a long time ago, like, you know.

231
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,240
If we jump the shark, we are going to literally jump over a shark.

232
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
We jumped the shark episode 2.

233
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Jamie skipped town on episode 2 of Orange Launch Radio, if you guys remember.

234
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Alright, anyway, let's move on, please.

235
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,240
PlayStation 2, How We Love Thee, and your cheap games,

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,000
But it's the next series according to a leak from Circuit City, which I never would meet very soon

245
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,960
Yeah, I'll have the release coming soon. Probably awesome also getting greatest hits

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,140
I just want to mention real quick is the PSP and these are also going to be $19.99 ATV

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,540

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
That's awesome.

250
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,100
If I remember correctly also, I believe the Game Boy Advance was having some more greatest

251
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,900
hits coming including, what was it, Mario Kart and, oh man, just a bunch of other Game

252
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Boy Advance games.

253
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,740
I remember there was about five of them that they're adding to their, whatever they call

254
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,520
their greatest hits I think is like these are my favorite stories cheaper

255
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:53,600
games cheaper games always yes excellent stuff but um I'm GS 68 says no luminous

256
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,280
for the lose yeah that kind of sucks well they want to suck all the money they

257
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,460
can out of that stupid thing but whatever I have a personal bone to pick

258
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,920
about luminous why I couldn't get luminous to install on my phone oh that

259
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,580
you try to get the cell version yeah I don't know it was out yeah and it

260
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,460
wouldn't install stupid network I'm totally gonna try and see if I can get

261
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:23,940
that game sweet anyways the former manager of Sony as a third-party

262
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:31,460
relations has left and actually went to Ubisoft which is kind of interesting so

263
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,420
you know people leaving Sony I guess that's not really big news what is big

264
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:43,020
news is they're saying that they've sent out over 10,000 PS3 dev kits, so wow, lots of

265
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,660
dev kits going out there, but all the dev kits in the world won't make that system any

266
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,420
cheaper.

267
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
But that's pretty cool.

268
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,980
Yes, but it might get more games worthy of you to talk about.

269
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,540
More games, more exclusive games, and it's a good thing that they've sent them out, because

270
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:03,300
before I remember they were saying that it's really costly to develop for it, and so those

271
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:11,700
10,000 you know dev kits to over 208 companies in 11 countries nice and as

272
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,540
apparently the largest on any PlayStation platform to date so that's

273
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,420
actually pretty cool that's pretty cool speaking of cool and actually you know

274
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:27,420
we brought this up last week with their release dates mm-hmm

275
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:34,340
EA is bringing out Sims 2 pets. There's some details on this. It actually is

276
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,080
gonna be a PC expansion standalone for PS2, GameCube, PSP, Nintendo DS, and Game

277
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,180
Boy Advance. You can have kitty cat, and puppy dogs, and guinea pigs, and birds, and

278
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:55,300
whatever else they decide to put in there. You can create your own pet and

279
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,260
and customize everything from fur to body, personality, you can make them

280
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,580
smart puppies or stupid guinea pigs.

281
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,420
Evil purple penguins? Yes, Rob, evil purple penguins. Yay!

282
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,900
You can name them, um, Bob.

283
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,780
Oh, uh, Arimasa wants to know, snakes? On a plane?

284
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,660
Ba dum bum. Yeah. Um, you can teach your pets to shake, roll over, play dead,

285
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:28,160
you know dig up dead bodies that type of thing. Now if you catch your puppies

286
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,620
digging in the garden or scratching up the furniture you'll have to spank. And

287
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,020
you'll be taking them to go get spayed or neutered. You can also use codes where

288
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:43,580
you can share accessories for markings that type of thing. So basically you can

289
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,100
make skins for your pets. Different versions will have different things. PC

290
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,460
will let you have designer pets like labrapoodles and puggles and schnoodles.

291
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Can you breed hamsters with dogs?

292
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,460
No. I don't know. Can I breed a pig with an elephant?

293
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,460
Exactly. Hey! In your

294
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,460
Create-A-Pet you can actually create them as unique pedigrees and put them online.

295
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,460
They can actually have career paths which is a show pet, security

296
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,460
or service with five job levels apiece.

297
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,460
The PS2 GameCube PSP versions will let you take them for a walk in the park.

298
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,220
But they make friends with other animals.

299
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:28,420
Does the hamster have an employment path of sex toy?

300
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,260
Yes.

301
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,940
It comes with a cardboard tube.

302
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,820
Can you take erotic pictures of the pets?

303
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,500
Can you kill them by drowning them?

304
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,900
Like low key, like stupid humans?

305
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,140
So those are the PS2 GameCube and PSP are all getting

306
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,740
like Nintendogs version, basically.

307
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,580
Do the parrots have large talons?

308
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,980
Hey, shut up.

309
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:53,960
on the DS. You can have a pet care center and other owners can come to have you take

310
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,580
care of their pets. You have shops and you can earn money by having a pet shop, basically.

311
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,220
And the Game Boy Advance one will have different careers for the sim, including veterinarian

312
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,220
and pet trainer.

313
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,980
I hope they can become rabid. Blaze Revolution in our chatroom, orangelanotrainer.com, click

314
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,820

317
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,180
just give us Spore, we're good. Yeah, this is sounding a little too much like, what was

318
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:39,580
it, RTS, Impossible Creatures, if you remember that. Ooh. You're so hardcore. Anyways, speaking

319
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:46,700
have cool stuff coming out. The Wii, basically Ubisoft in the UK has confirmed that Red Steel

320
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:54,340
is coming out in November in the UK. What does that mean to us though? Well, not a damn

321
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,620
thing. A couple of things though. Red Steel is supposed to be the launch title. Now, Red

322
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,140
Steel is supposed to be coming, or the Wii is supposed to be coming out before Playstation

323
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:10,220
3 that we know. So, for example, the Playstation 3 is coming out in mid-November. So therefore

324
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,900
this has to be coming out early November. Well, in the UK, in the UK it's probably going

325
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:22,100
to be getting the Wii a few weeks after us. What's a couple weeks before November? October

326
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:30,180
18th. Aha! It's like almost like six degrees of Kevin Bacon there. I am so sick of all

327
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,100
these news stories about the Wii's speculated release date.

328
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,460
I mean, the damn thing will come out when it comes out.

329
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,660
That being said, Activision slipped up and might have revealed the Wii release date this

330
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,620
week, because Activision sent out this spreadsheet of all their upcoming games, and one of the

331
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,100
games that's listed on there is Tony Hawk Downhill Jam, and the ship date?

332
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
October.

333
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,740
Now, they don't say the day, but they say it's in October, which seems to confirm that

334
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,280
the Wii is coming out in October.

335
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,840
which date I had in my system when, you know, they put Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam. Uh, that's

336
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
right.

337
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,600
I'm gonna kind of feel bad if it doesn't come out October 18th. I'm gonna feel like Reggie

338
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,880
personally fucked with us.

339
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,560
He's all, I'll show you. Think you know when it's coming out, bastards.

340
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,560
Ah, you like, how you like them apples?

341
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,360
Ari Mossin in chat says Zelda Twilight Princess is scheduled for November, though, and that

342
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,240
game's coming out on launch day.

343
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,400
Yeah, but there's been no official date announced for Twilight Princess because

344
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,200
that's gonna be the day that the Wii comes out, so obviously they're not gonna

345
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,880
announce that.

346
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,720
Yeah, by the way, Twilight Princess is coming out this day. Oh, crap!

347
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,280
They're not gonna do that. Guys, we have a huge scoop for you guys.

348
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,720
The Wii is out right now. In fact, go to your local GameStopper EB Games and ask

349
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,360
for one.

350
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,680
They'll love you for it. And if the store tells you they don't have them yet, they're

351
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,800
playing a joke on you. Go to another store and ask.

352
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,480
Exactly. Please, I hope you guys know I'm kidding.

353
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Please don't. It's super secret.

354
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,240
And there's nothing one of those employees at those stores loves more

355
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,160
than people coming in going, do you have the Wii yet?

356
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,080
Anyways, speaking of

357
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,320
lies and speculation,

358
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,080
there's been a lot of rumors going around to what

359
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,640
some of the secrets of the Wii and what they might be, so

360
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:33,640
Anyways, some speculation here we've got for ya, including this is apparently from wii.qj.net

361
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:40,640
and they've got a little article here about some of the stuff to expect that an insider told them.

362
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
You know, insider.

363
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Anyways, the full scope of the Wii controller details have yet to be revealed by Pixar and Nintendo

364
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,360
and says, although I cannot elaborate any further, let me say that Nintendo should show

365
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,520
that movement in 3D space will allow experiences outside of just the TV screen and it's not

366
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,240
3D projection related.

367
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,200
But this also kind of, if you think about it, goes back to that one article we had about

368
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,600
Red Steel and how some of the multiplayer won't take place on TV, which is interesting.

369
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,780
The first game that's going to be shown to the public that will demonstrate the full

370
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:25,680
scope of the Wii controller potential will be Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2, which

371
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,620
is also scheduled for October by the way.

372
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,460
That's for all systems, including the Wii.

373
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,340
The sensor bar was in all actuality in no use at E3.

374
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:46,840
What it will allow hasn't been shown yet, which I don't know what that's supposed to

375
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,680
mean but interesting.

376
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,900
And it says, according to people who are working close with everyday events and Nintendo research

377
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,440
and development, Nintendo Wii specifications were far and away developed solely for the

378
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,540
machine.

379
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,400
And it says apparently that the specs keep changing on it.

380
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,600
so that there's plans on maybe doing a Wii headset and it says for the online capability

381
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:17,600
and they might even go further in having it have a gyroscope inside of the headset.

382
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
For game use.

383
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,440
Interesting.

384
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,800
Some of it far-fetched, some of it maybe?

385
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,480
I don't know.

386
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,640
We'll see.

387
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
It's a lot of speculation.

388
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,800
You know, it's just so frustrating because Sony talks too much and Nintendo doesn't talk

389
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
enough.

390
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,280
Yeah. Why can't they just, maybe they need to shuffle their corporate structures a little

391
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,840
bit and then you know we get some people, some loudmouths on Nintendo and some quieter

392
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:49,720
people at Sony. It would be beautiful. I don't know, but these, these rumors frustrate me

393
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,360
to no end and make me angsty. How do you feel about that Dark Sakura? Do you get angsty

394
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:12,440
of these rumors. Here come the FU's of the week, boys and girls. My FU of the week goes

395
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,640
toward websites that use flash ads that have sound on them. Like when you go on MySpace

396
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:27,080
in here. Smack the bug to win a million dollars! Or like whatever site that was playing the

397
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,520
sounds of death, and I couldn't find what adit was to turn it off. Just a big, stinky

398
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,080
pile of poo on that.

399
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
Loki.

400
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:42,880
Um, you know, FU to IGN, and FU to IGN for one reason, and I've covered this before.

401
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,760
Jessica Chobot. I don't like her. And the reason I don't like her is because she's...

402
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,880
it's like a Paris Hilton situation here. Famous for no apparent reason. Famous because of

403
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,520
something stupid. Famous because she licked a PSP. Come on now. And now they have her

404
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:05,240
in like this 17 volume whatever right now feature where she talks about stuff and has

405
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,680
stupid pictures and this one of course she has snakes on her because of snakes on a plane.

406
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:17,300
snakes on the chest I guess lame come on folks I mean stop pouring her out she's

407
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:24,360
nobody stop trying to make her somebody my f-you of the week goes to my facial

408
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,480
hair for growing too fast as you can see I was too lazy to shave today or

409
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,880
yesterday and I practically have a beard at this point so an F you to the and an

410
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,880
And F.U. to the inflating cost of razors.

411
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Magus!

412
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Yo, my F.U. this week is the same as last week.

413
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,880
F.U. to my air conditioner.

414
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Apparently the compressor took a shit, they have to replace the whole unit.

415
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,880
Oh no, we're not going to replace the whole unit, we're just going to fix the one we have.

416
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,880
You know, make a decision and get to it because it's still like 90 degrees in my den.

417
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,880
My computer will not work right, and it's just a big pain in the ass.

418
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Alright.

419
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Thanks for keeping the angst quick tonight, guys.

420
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
It allows us to move on to another story.

421
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Anyways, speaking of fun stuff, this week, Fusion Frenzy 2 was announced.

422
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,880
And for those who might not remember, it was a really cool game that was on the Xbox.

423
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,880
And it's basically a collection of about, you know, 40 or so mini-games.

424
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,040
Well this time they're going to be having more mini games as well over 40 and set on

425
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,800
seven different planets as well as online multiplayer matches and tournaments and it

426
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,760
says players will be able to use tournament cards they've earned for a variety of purposes

427
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:46,080
including selecting the next game to be played or choosing the next planet to go to.

428
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,840
So it sounds like a pretty fun little 360 game and it's set to hit the stores this holiday

429
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
season.

430
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Well if you're having a hard time playing through Fusion Frenzy 1, maybe you ought to

431
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,400
get a tutor.

432
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,000
The Wall Street Journal has recently run a report on gamers who are using their skills

433
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,300
to help pay the rent and basically what they are doing is they are setting up this whole

434
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,860
enterprise here.

435
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:20,480
Seeing as gamers that work all day have not a lot of time to perfect their skills, gaming-lessons.com

436
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:29,180
has this guy, Tom Taylor, who you pay $45 for an hour, and he will turn you into an

437
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,760
expert master chief.

438
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:39,700
What do you guys think about hiring tutors to get better at games?

439
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:46,200
It's I guess an interesting idea for them to use to make money, but no.

440
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,480
By the way, if you're questioning whether this is legit or anything, what can this guy

441
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,280
do for me this is the guy who also just signed like this big fat quarter million

442
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,760
dollar contract to play halo essentially okay well how are you gonna teach me to

443
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,000
play something other than halo oh that's right well maybe you know if the

444
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,480
business model works here then it can work you know elsewhere so what kind of

445
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,880
a tutor is he I mean that's like saying I owe a master at fractions okay can you

446
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,120
teach me some multiplication I'm a master at fractions no I don't know it's

447
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,600
This is kind of dumb.

448
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
I'm actually kind of curious.

449
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,360
I want to look at this site real quick.

450
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,360
It's gaming-lessons.com.

451
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
Hmm.

452
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,040
They have a gaming lessons store available?

453
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
They have some...

454
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,760
It looks like they have some free, you know, that sold out lessons.

455
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Wow.

456
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
People are buying these.

457
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Sounds oddly familiar.

458
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:43,120
Sounds like that whole Penny Arcade Academy of 2000, only without the tanks and piranhas.

459
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,360
Wow.

460
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,360
Interesting stuff.

461
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,360
I'm just kind of tearing through the site here.

462
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,400
Yeah, it talks about the major league gaming signing crazy

463
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,880
That's like getting a professional baseball player to come tutor to you though in a way, right? I

464
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,760
Mean guess people wouldn't laugh at that idea. So why does this seem a little silly? I would laugh at that idea

465
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,460
All right fair enough if you have a comment on that you could always send it into our mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio

466
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:16,080
Calm and every week dark soccer likes to dig into the mailbag and pull out her favorite letters that hopefully aren't too moldy

467
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,960
yeah some of them had some funk on them and it was it was a convention funk not

468
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,600
as bad as fanboy funk all right anyway she's gonna open up that mailbag right

469
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,840
now kids and pull out some of her favorite letters to share with us right

470
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:37,240
now one of our emails comes from ion six seven one not gonna read the whole thing

471
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,040
but he calls us the OL army generals I think that's pretty funny

472
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:48,020
that's senior sergeant to you I actually generals above sergeant whatever it

473
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,400
doesn't matter I'm making a Warcraft joke but whatever okay and if you guys

474
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,560
are music game fans do you have any favorite game soundtracks from any game

475
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:00,360
music game or not my favorite is definitely jets at radio wow that's a

476
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,720
really broad question I mean you want like recent game soundtracks or old

477
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,080
school stuff long gun midnight max oh I love long gun as far as like a non

478
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,600
Oh, yeah, that's got a great soundtrack for driving heck I I'll use that soundtrack. Well at least the cuts

479
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
I have I don't have the whole thing I need to re-get it

480
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,480
I'll use the cuts when I play Xbox 360 driving games like instead of EA tracks because I don't really like a lot of that

481
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,880
Stuff I'll listen to that music while playing driving games. It's awesome. I've told you you have access to all my stuff

482
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
I know I just keep forgetting um

483
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,840
Dance dance revolution third mix had a kick-ass soundtrack in my opinion

484
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,840
If you want to go new school. If you want to go like really old school, I like soundtracks like Super Metroid, but it's really old.

485
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Loki, anything you want to suggest?

486
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,840
What was a really fun one I had? Well, I had my car Gran Turismo, the first one.

487
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,840
That had a pretty decent soundtrack.

488
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Rez had a pretty good soundtrack.

489
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Ooh yeah, Rez.

490
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
And Space Channel 5!

491
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Yeah, I played that forever in my car.

492
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:12,860
hmm I don't know I'm really recently like I can't really see burner revenge

493
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:19,020
because a lot of the music I didn't like other than junkie XL but oh hello I

494
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:24,260
mean why you had some pretty good stuff Justin and chat wins symphony of the

495
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,300
night when actually actually actually I have many it's I love symphony and that

496
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,820
soundtrack especially the Saturn one they had the remixes of bloody tears and

497
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,820
Vampire Hunter.

498
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,820
Oh yes.

499
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:40,380
But, um, I actually will take my co- I actually burned off all the, uh, sound- all the music

500
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:46,520
off of my, um, uh, Rondo of Blood, just to listen to the remixed versions of all the

501
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,000
old school Castlevania tunes.

502
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,300
That and there's just, uh, there's music in that that's just so awesome and it's all

503
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,600
Redbook audio so you can actually play this on soundtrack.

504
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,840
Wow, Rama and Chad just gave us a useless trivia fact.

505
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,920
The girl that did the voice of Ulala on Space Channel 5 now works at Home Depot in New York

506
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,340
city how's that smile yeah she also still does apparently still does

507
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,740
conventions but but works at Home Depot I wonder she but she go up and down the

508
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:20,220
aisles you know going choo-choo-choo she used to be the the real-life anime girl

509
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:26,780

510
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:35,340
crowd at Coast Con about five years ago home lighting to get in where I and I

512
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,740
bad sorry okay I was going down a troublesome path I needed to be shown

513
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,180
the light that the Grand Theft Auto new wave one oh cuz it's all my favorite

514
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,820
80s oh yeah the 80 like seven discs of 80s music and stuff good and one of it

515
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:00,660
was new wave so uh actually I've been really getting into the Kingdom Hearts

516
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,940
2 soundtrack though because I had put the Tron music on repeat so you've got

517
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,780
about 50 different soundtrack suggestions from us so have fun buying

518
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,140
all those legally just bringing up some of the Final Fantasy hate to in this

519
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,500
email he actually wanted to tell me to rock on with Aerith dying but he's

520
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,300
basically displeased with the fanboys on the internet he has a one-up club for

521
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,020
people you know who are in the same games as he is and people are all like

522
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:28,780
And he tried to ask them nicely not to and they were like being rude back

523
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,060
So it was like, you know what? That's the nature of the internet

524
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,760
You know there I think isn't there an abuse report. I'm biting my tongue so bad right now

525
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,880
You don't even know so I'm just get off of one up start a Yahoo group

526
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,620
Okay, how's that that's fine

527
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,460
Start a real website anyway moving on

528
00:36:52,460 --> 00:37:00,680
Our friend Rob with two B's sent us an email, here's some fuel for the fire the next time

529
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,520
you discuss watching your own children.

530
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,180
My nephews visited yesterday, their mom had no clue which games they owned.

531
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:13,460
It turns out that only the ones I gave them, all appropriate for kids, are the ones they

532
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,460
had.

533
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,820
But talking with the kids made me realize something, your children will be exposed to

534
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,480
almost every game made through their friends.

535
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,120
That's a rough realization, despite your best efforts, little Johnny Doe will have Resident

536
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,440
Evil on his DS because Mommy bought it for him.

537
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,920
Johnny will show the other kids regardless of age, including your own.

538
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,520
Therefore, as long as one's parent doesn't care which games their kids play, no amount

539
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,880
of laws will be effective or even practical in keeping that game away from your own children

540
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,920
unless you live under a rock.

541
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,680
You can only battle this type of outside influence by teaching your kids to understand what is

542
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,200
real, what is fantasy, and why they're different.

543
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Amen!

544
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
Exactly.

545
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Nail on the head.

546
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Also, now this is something that I had actually half thought of getting for myself, we'd been

547
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,840
discussing it.

548
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:07,600
We got an email from, oh I think our connection just hiccuped, anyway, we got an email from

549
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:22,520
Gareth, who asked about the GP2X, which is the sequel to the GP32, which comes from Korea.

550
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,420
It's an open source handheld system.

551
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,580
You can load, as he says in here, I can play loads of classic emulated games, watch videos

552
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,060
and podcasts all on one device. It's at gp2x.com

553
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,520
or gp2x.co.uk

554
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,100
By the way, I want to thank the listeners. This is a

555
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,100
completely different random topic. I don't remember who suggested it to me, but

556
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,580
somebody suggested the

557
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,980
front row application for the Mac and like how you can install it on a Mac

558
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,260
that it didn't really come with

559
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,820
and that's been great for my laptop for like video podcasts and movies and

560
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,440
stuff. So you talking about a device that would play all that

561
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,160
Kind of made me think of that so I've decided when I buy my Mac. I'm gonna be getting the virtual XP

562
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,640
I forgot who told me about that, but thank you

563
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Anyway, sorry

564
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,160
And

565
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,880
then

566
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,560
one comes the last one I'm gonna

567
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,320
Point out tonight is actually a question that comes from a skater, dude

568
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,480
Hey Orangels Radio, I was wondering about how the DS sales are dramatically larger than

569
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
the PSP sales.

570
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,760
Do you think it is because the DS is cheaper or what?

571
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,840
Please give me your thoughts.

572
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Love the show.

573
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,760
So I think there's crazy people out there that bought a DS and a DS Lite when it came

574
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
back out.

575
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,340
Yeah, I'd agree.

576
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,020
I didn't do that, but I will get a DS Lite when they come out with the new colors because

577
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,080
I'm not going to be suckered into buying one of these white ones and then, you know, a

578
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,360
a few months later, ooh, pretty blue, pretty pink,

579
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,280
pretty green, or whatever else they're going to release.

580
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,660
What if they come out pretty blue

581
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,360
and you really want it pretty like red or something,

582
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,520
and then red comes out?

583
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Then I'll just be mad.

584
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,320
I like my white one.

585
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,000
I'll be flat up mad.

586
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,080
I just, you know, there'll be a cooler color that all the cool

587
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,600
kids want.

588
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,920
So why do you have a white one?

589
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,920
Any more emails?

590
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,240
Dear Rob, STFU.

591
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,400
OK, thanks, bye.

592
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
Any more emails?

593
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,320
No, there aren't.

594
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,100
We should have more emails sent to us at mailbag at orangelaunsradio.com.

595
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:34,400
Tell us how much you love it when I make those jokes that make Jamie uncomfortable.

596
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,920
Hope to hear from you soon.

597
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
Exactly.

598
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,680
And in the meantime, while you're waiting to send emails or something, or need something

599
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:50,660
send emails about, perhaps the creator of Electroplankton's brand new project, the

600
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,620
Tenori On, would be something that you'll want to talk about.

601
00:40:53,620 --> 00:41:01,460
And basically Toshio EY is coming up with this brand new device, it's basically a 16

602
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:08,560
by 16 grid of LCD switches, or LED switches, which are used to actually play music.

603
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,860
and you can kind of use this to create your own mixes. He actually has a website that

604
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:26,200
you can visit, which is www.global.yamaha.com slash design slash tenori dash on, which is

605
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:33,680
T-E-N-O-R-I dash O-N. And you can check it out. The device looks pretty interesting.

606
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:40,880
he says that anybody can use it to make music, and it looks kind of sexy.

607
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,580
So kind of a neat little device there.

608
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,280
And if it's anything like electroplankton, it should be pretty awesome.

609
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,460
Well, I know some people that played a lot of electroplankton, in fact, so much they

610
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,640
were addicted.

611
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,000
And you might remember on a previous program, episode of Orange Launch Radio, we talked

612
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,840
about the Dutch Game Addiction Clinic, and we were talking about all that, the folks

613
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,280
that were signing up to go to this clinic.

614
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
Well guess what?

615
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,080
Ever since this hit some of the mainstream news, apparently the gaming treatment program

616
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:17,040
has been inundated with calls from parents wanting to get their kids in this.

617
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,560
Clinic director Keith Bakker explained, computer game addiction is obviously an even greater

618
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,860
problem than we imagined.

619
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Everything okay?

620
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,860
No, nothing.

621
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,860
Okay.

622
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,860
Just making sure.

623
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,860
Just makin' sure, hoo!

624
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,860
Hmm, sounded like there was something bad goin' on over there.

625
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,860
Um, you're having a little too much fun here.

626
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,860
I can say something about that name, however, I don't want to reveal where I...

627
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,860
Does the game addiction thing strike a chord with you?

628
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,860
No, I'm not addicted. Much.

629
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,860
Alright, uh, it is conceded that video game addiction, also by the same guy,

630
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,860
quote, is not a chemical dependency, but it's got everything of an obsessive-compulsive disorder

631
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,740
disorder and all the other stuff that comes with chemical dependencies.

632
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,380
Hmm, interesting.

633
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,500
You know, and I know there was another related story that talked about some guy was so addicted

634
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,980
to video games that he never left his room and he peed in a bottle or something like

635
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,980
that.

636
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,980
That's awesome.

637
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,380
Okay, dude, that guy had more problems with being addicted to video games because I don't

638
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,020
know in what universe that's considered sanitary by any means.

639
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,180
That's obsessive compulsive disorder.

640
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,960
Yeah, there's something else going on there.

641
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,200
That's more than game addiction.

642
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,200
That's craziness.

643
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,200
I don't know.

644
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,580
It needs professional help, absolutely.

645
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:31,700
I don't know. But I'm kind of weary about these people just, you know, having the parents

646
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:37,620
call in and say, oh yeah, my kids are addicted to games because they just play them a lot

647
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,940
and stuff. And it kind of reminds me of that But I'm a Cheerleader movie.

648
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,340
Why is our chat room supporting the peeing in a bottle thing? I mean, is this just an

649
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:50,460
internet chat thing? We have Eddie saying, pee in a bottle, for the win. Cage says, peeing

650
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:56,320
in a bottle is awesome, it's liberating. Okay, the only time when it's ever socially acceptable

651
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,840
to pee in a bottle is when you just can't pull over for some reason.

652
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
At the doctor's office.

653
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Okay, fine. That's different.

654
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,160
Or if you have cancer and have a colostomy and have to pee in a bottle.

655
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:15,560
Fine. Those are all medically necessary reasons, but I mean, because you're too lazy to put

656
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,600
down the controller for five seconds, a Halo 2, and go pee, it doesn't take that long to

657
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
pee.

658
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Poop sock.

659
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,300
I don't even want to go to number two. I don't even want to go there. This show's

660
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,960
Fucked up enough as it is

661
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,040
You know the show's gone down the toilet and I mean that do you think that's crazy

662
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:42,240
Well, you know the talk of the Xbox 360 dropping down to 299 that is crazy talk and that's a pisser

663
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,560
exactly says

664
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,480
Michael our analyst Michael patcher as pretty has a

665
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:56,800
to pretty much explain why this isn't going to happen. And the reason why is, Microsoft

666
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,440
Brass has informed the Xbox division that it must turn a profit or at least break even

667
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,640
in the fiscal 2007 year, which ends on June 30th of next year. He explains that that means

668
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:14,080
that the price cuts on the Xbox 360 will only come if the box costs less to produce, ship

669
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:20,960
and market than wholesale price. But the best guess is the box currently costs around $400

670
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:27,640
to $450 to produce and it's likely that the company can get that down to below $400 later

671
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:33,840
this year. However, just because of the price of manufacturing drops does not mean that

672
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:39,360
they're going to drop the price. It just means they make more profit. So the only reason

673
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,140
they'll drop the price to $2.99 is say the PS3 comes out and they're like oh

674
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:49,020
yeah by the way when we said it was gonna come out for $4.99 actually $2.99

675
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,340
is the price that we're gonna come out for it then they'll drop the price so

676
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:58,220
not gonna happen no don't hold your breath there's better games coming out

677
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,460
in the fall you know when all those games come out then you can decide which

678
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,420
system you want well you know who's actually thinking that they're gonna be

679
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:20,420
doing a lot of profit. That would be Nintendo. They're going Wii. They actually, um, Nintendo

680
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:27,140
has actually just put out their results for their quarter ending last month. Are they

681
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:33,620
going Wii in a bottle? I didn't want anybody to go there. I really didn't. Please let the

682
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:38,980
the lady finish her story basically DS is pulling in so much profit basically

683
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:45,900
they've sold 21 million DS's and 4.1 million DS lights they've also sold more

684
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:53,180
than 78 million games Nintendo's basically projecting that from April of

685
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:57,740
this year through March of next they will sell another 17 million DS's and

686
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:06,140
75 million games, um, they were actually higher than their E3 predictions, um, actually they're

687
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:10,180
still supporting Game Boy Advance, they're expecting to sell another 2.5 million Game

688
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:19,260
Boy Advances, uh, 30 million games for the system, um, now, they basically have, uh,

689
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,740
ditched the, uh, micro, I own a micro.

690
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:27,220
God, I remember seeing that at E3, I'm like, wow, that's the dumbest idea I've seen yet.

691
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:31,280
Actually like my micro because when I was really bored standing around in line

692
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:38,160
I had my micro on my mom my lanyard around my throat my neck and I could pick it up whenever I got really bored and

693
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,000
Play me some Kingdom Hearts

694
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,220
It was or you know puzzle as playing a pocket fighter not like a fighter a puzzle fighter

695
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,180
Now this is the interesting part Nintendo's got some predictions about the Wii as I had mentioned

696
00:47:53,180 --> 00:48:00,180
basically for over the next five or six months they're going to be selling the system

697
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:05,180
they're expecting 6 million consoles and 17 million games

698
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,180
Ambitious, you think they can do it?

699
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,180
Oh yeah, it's Nintendo

700
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:18,180
Yeah, but you know, GameCube, Nintendo 64, not so, well GameCube was actually, GameCube was actually pretty good

701
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,180
Wii versus PS3, no contest

702
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,180
No contest.

703
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,420
At this point, absolutely, but I don't know.

704
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:30,020
The Sony fanboy in me still thinks Sony might be up to something, but we'll see.

705
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,020

Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

715
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,940
Who's this?

716
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,940
Can you hear me now?

717
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,940
Yes, I can hear you just fine.

718
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,940
What's on your mind?

719
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,940
Uh, there's not much.

720
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,940
Wait, who is this?

721
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,940
Introduce yourself to the listeners.

722
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,940
I know who this is.

723
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,340
Yeah, at least one person knows who I am.

724
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,500
Hey, I know who you are too, but the new listeners might not.

725
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Who is this?

726
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,700
It is the one and only Rahnema from the East Coast.

727
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,020
Hey Rahnema from the East Coast, what's on your mind?

728
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:18,020
Um, I was kind of surprised with the whole E3 thing, but then again, I'm not at the same

729
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,020
time.

730
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:23,120
I mean E3 is like

731
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,980
the thing that you go to but yet you probably have to sell

732
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:30,340
one of your kidneys just to get in you know. Not really

733
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,720
I mean I have to be honest it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be

734
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,460
If you have a legitimate reason for being there it's really not hard to get in

735
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:38,840
there

736
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,060
Yeah but you know

737
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:46,060
but the way I see it you know as I said in the article

738
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:50,580
mini E3 is going to be happening. I don't see it going to Comic Con,

739
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,140
not in a long shot. I don't see it. Do you think somebody else is going to start

740
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,780
something that's similar to E3?

741
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:00,380
Well we already have something going as much of its East Coast as we were screaming

742
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,340
about in the chat room earlier tonight, which was

743
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,620
Digital Life. What makes you think Digital Life is going to be the new E3?

744
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:10,620
Well first off, it only takes like 25 bucks to get in for the full weekend.

745
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,660
It's spacious and it's like you got

746
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:17,700
Gaming in one section talk about the latest technology on one

747
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,640
Nothing, but free demos of stuff to walk away with plus you have freaking cosplayers. They're having a great time

748
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,160
Hmm

749
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,120
What so this is a show that's open to the public yeah

750
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:38,200
Is this the direction that a show like e3 or whatever hopes to become the next e3

751
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,660
Is that a direction that they should be taking is to be a public show you think I?

752
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,500
I tend to think so. I mean the way they have this have it up like maybe the first day

753
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:52,340
Important industry people only then open to the public for everyone else. I

754
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:57,980
Don't think so. Why not? Well, if you do e3 public, it's gonna be a clusterfuck

755
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:04,140
I mean think of how it is right now just with how many people are there. Can you imagine like double that?

756
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,700
You yes, I can it's called New York Comic Con

757
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,780
Interesting

758
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:16,980
Well anyway in New York City, but then again, you know, LA is pretty big too and is a you know

759
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,820
Good place to have something like that. So I don't know how much bigger New York City could be. I mean, yes, it's New York City

760
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,100
There's no, you know

761
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,700
Shortage of places to stay or anything like that

762
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,740
But it's you know

763
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:33,220
I don't know you see on plus side New York City is like this melt all types of great stuff

764
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:37,220
But on the downside where the Jacob Javits Center is for digital life

765
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:42,120
It's like in a 15-minute walk to the most local hotel unless you cross the

766
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,100
river to Jersey. I mean for something like this you'd have to bank on the fact

767
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:51,560
that most people will be taking the bus and the subways to get to and fro.

768
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:57,160
Well interesting. It actually generates more revenue for the city.

769
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,560
I hope so because they're not raising, they're not hiking up the fares

770
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,680
for another year. Do you see something like that realistically happening in the

771
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,500
next couple years the show getting bigger and bigger and yeah I tend to

772
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,540
think so yeah all right well we'll see what happens if it gets big enough we'll

773
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,900
have to come out there you know that of course I have to send you my list of all

774
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,020
the cons I'm hitting up next year so you can come on out hey of course with no E3

775
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,980
this year that might mean I can make an East Coast con exactly that's what I'm

776
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,700
thinking too is like hey travel budget back so maybe I can go somewhere so I

777
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,740
you know in digital life something I've been wanting to do for a while and it's

778
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,580
It's like a geek's paradise.

779
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:37,900
The first day I went, they had teams from local high schools having a contest of how

780
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:42,220
fast they could build a computer from start to finish, including boot up to Windows.

781
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:46,360
And I just realized I'm going to be in New York City in October, and I haven't said anything

782
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,060
about this on the show yet, but I'm planning on going to New York City in October, but

783
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,060
it's the wrong weekend.

784
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,060
I won't be there for digital life.

785
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,060
It's going to be towards the end of October.

786
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,060
What date?

787
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,060
I don't know for sure yet.

788
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:59,180
I'll have more details later, because I'll definitely go to the Nintendo store or something

789
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,660
and meet fans if they want to come out.

790
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,860
I'll be at Y-Con.

791
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,260
I'll be your security guard.

792
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:08,900
Alright, uh, yeah, so, oh god, I shouldn't have said anything on the New York City thing.

793
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,220
Yeah, that's going to happen in October, but I'll say more about that later.

794
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,220
But anything else?

795
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,220
SkyCon, New York City.

796
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,220
Whatever.

797
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,580
Anything else you want to say?

798
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,460
That's basically it, and I'm loving the show, because if you didn't notice, I was feeling

799
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,980
sick earlier, but listening made me feel better, so.

800
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,260
Laughter heals everything.

801
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,260
Thank you so much.

802
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,260
Appreciate it.

803
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,260
All right, nurse.

804
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,260
Later.

805
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,260
Oh, you know what?

806
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,260
Let's move E3 to YowieCon.

807
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,260
I like that idea.

808
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,940
Ooh, that's a pretty boy nookie.

809
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,780
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

810
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,780
Who's this?

811
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,780
Hi.

812
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,780
This is Eddie.

813
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,780
Hi, Eddie.

814
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,780
What's on your mind, buddy?

815
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:48,460
I just wanted to comment on the E3 going public thing.

816
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,180
Realistically, I really don't think that's going to happen.

817
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:57,580
I mean, E3 is there for industry people to get stuff done.

818
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:03,020
And if you have one day that's open to the industry and the rest is open to the public,

819
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,740
I don't think there's enough time for people to get things done.

820
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:11,960
And well, if they open it to both the industry and the public at the same time, the industry

821
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,580
people doesn't want to be tripping over all these fanboys who are there to see the latest

822
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,580
game.

823
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,580
Right.

824
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,160
So what would your suggestion be for the independents?

825
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,500
What do the Kenshi folks do now?

826
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:31,540
I actually think the IndyCon is a pretty good idea, but I still don't think it should be

827
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,540
open to the public.

828
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:42,280
I think it should still be an industry-only thing where publishers can't go to find new

829
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,580
materials to publish, I guess.

830
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,580
Alright.

831
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,620
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

832
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,620
No, not really.

833
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,620
Alright.

834
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,620
Well, thanks for your thoughts.

835
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,620
Yeah.

836
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,420
It's not a problem.

837
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,420
We like doing it, because fine folks like yourself call us every week.

838
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,420
All right.

839
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,420
All right, have a good one, buddy.

840
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,420
Thank you.

841
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,420
Later.

842
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:03,420
We'll do one more call.

843
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,420
All right.

844
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,340
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

845
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,340
Who's this?

846
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,460
It's Ravenstaufen again.

847
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,460
Sorry about that.

848
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,460
That's all right.

849
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,460
Much better connection.

850
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,460
Porn torrents off this time?

851
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,460
Yes.

852
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,460
Much better.

853
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,460
All right.

854
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,460
Porno tubes off?

855
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,460
Yes.

856
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,460
Excellent.

857
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,460
Porno tubes off.

858
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,460
All right.

859
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,460
Let's try this again.

860
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,460
What did you want to call in about?

861
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,460
E3.

862
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:30,060
to going to be canceled I think it's going to be downsized. Oh no we never

863
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:34,900
said canceled. Oh well okay well yeah we did we said we said canceled as we know

864
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:40,100
it. I have no doubt the ESA is gonna do something but the question is is that

865
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,260
something going to be good enough and that's what I ask you is that something

866
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:49,180
going to be good enough? I don't know I I think I don't know it might be bad news

867
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:53,980
for Nintendo and Sony, don't they have like these splatchy plazads and everything to go

868
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,620
all out for this thing?

869
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:00,620
Yes, but what's to stop Nintendo from doing a, you know, well hell, they're doing their

870
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,060
Fusion Tour.

871
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:06,100
I mean they can take that stuff on the road, and rumor is there was something going around

872
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:10,580
on one of the, Kotaku or something, saying that they were going to be doing a special

873
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,580
tour.

874
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,380
I don't know if it was the Fusion Tour or something separate, but they were going to

875
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,380
take their show on the road.

876
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:18,180
There's nothing to stop Sony from doing something similar, having a huge event in LA.

877
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,260
All these guys could still do press conferences.

878
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,900
It's just going to be weird because E3 kind of brought it

879
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,220
all together.

880
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,440
And now you're going to have, I think at least in 2007,

881
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,340
you're just going to have a clusterfuck of all these random events.

882
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,180
It's going to be really weird.

883
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,180
That's going to be funny, all this clusterfuck

884
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,740
of all these things.

885
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,260
It might be an interesting time in 2007.

886
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:42,020
True, but for us little guys who don't really

887
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:46,940
have a travel budget, who like to bring the news to you guys, we're screwed.

888
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,260
I mean, maybe not so much us.

889
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,900
We're fortunate enough to be in the Bay Area-ish.

890
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,660
I mean, Bay Area is a 90-minute drive.

891
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,360
So realistically, we can get to most events over there pretty

892
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:55,860
easy.

893
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,300
But I feel sorry for a lot of other folks

894
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,460
who don't have that same luxury being able to drive.

895
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,940
And not every company is in the Bay Area.

896
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,980
Some are in LA, which is a little harder to get to.

897
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,860
And some are in, you know, what, Canada, other countries.

898
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,700
Hell, one of the nicest people we talked to at E3 this year

899
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,540
were those folks from Spain that were developed in the,

900
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,100
what was it?

901
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,820
It was like American Pie Meets Grand Theft Auto.

902
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:21,280
I can't remember the name of the game now, but what was it called summer something that summer summer heat or something?

903
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,720
Yeah, it was it was funny cuz I had a lot of a guy stealing a panties on the cover. It was funny

904
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:31,240
I think I'll show our listeners ravens dolphin. Yeah, you left this out of your note

905
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,760
PSP got a firmware update

906
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:42,260
2.2 point eight last week. Yeah. Yeah, go listen last week show buddy. Uh, it came out. I mean, oh, yeah

907
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,260
Oh yeah, we didn't have it on the show the other night because we already talked about that it was coming out.

908
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,260
What do you think? Did you download it?

909
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:54,260
It's on the PSP. I have to put it in. I didn't really have a chance to test it out yet.

910
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:58,260
Alright, call us back next week after you've tested it out because I haven't upgraded mine yet. I'm a little lazy.

911
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:03,260
Oh, one more thing about the PSP and the DS Lite sales.

912
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,260
Go for it. Yeah.

913
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,260
Well, this is my opinion why the DS is doing better

914
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:12,300
because it's targeted to little kids and people that like

915
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,180
things. Nintendo's a little kid company. I'm not being mean, that's what they say.

916
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:19,780
Okay. It's a family-friendly company.

917
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:23,340
Yeah, it's a family-friendly company and when people see it they go,

918
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,620
ah, friendly. But then Sony has

919
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:30,180
family-friendly stuff on it too. Well, yeah.

920
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:34,040
But they also have Grand Theft Auto. Sony's looking for that luxury liner. They

921
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,480
They want you to get your money.

922
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,680
This thing is not cheap either.

923
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,800
Alright, well, thanks for sharing your thoughts.

924
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,800
Appreciate it.

925
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,840
Sorry about the bad quality the first time.

926
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,880
That's okay.

927
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,880
It'll be edited out like it was never there.

928
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,880
Oh, thank you.

929
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,560
Our podcast listeners are going to go, what are they talking about?

930
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,640
That first call's not even there.

931
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,640
Have a good one.

932
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,640
You too.

933
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,640
Bye.

934
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,260
Now, I just want our podcast folks to know we really don't edit a lot on the show.

935
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,260
We really don't.

936
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,260
We like to keep things pure here.

937
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:04,260
the only things we really added out dead air and bad Skype calls and there's a really bad

938
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:04,860
connection

939
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:08,700
so just wanted you guys to know that. Alright one more call it's another New Yorker so

940
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,380
this should be fun

941
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:14,220
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this? It's one and only Legend of Zaku

942
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,940
Oh another New Yorker on the line let me guess Digital Life? New E3?

943
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,900
Yeah of course that's that's obviously that's the same thing I was

944
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,380
yeah same thing as Rama said. Alright then what are your thoughts on this why is

945
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:28,500
Digital Life to be the new E3 besides the fact it's in your backyard?

946
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:34,820
Basically is I mean you're breaking down e3 and spreading it across the country. That's pretty much what is gonna happen next year

947
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:42,420
I'm gonna restate this. I'm gonna you know, I'm gonna second the statements. I already said it's a cluster fuck. It'll be a

948
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,180
What will happen is is that?

949
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:50,900
The elements that made e3 really successful in the in the earlier days in the in the first few ones

950
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:56,380
Like, you know allowing the public to to go in is basically gonna help the little you know

951
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:01,180
the other smaller shows which are gonna just they're gonna steal E3's lightning

952
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:06,180
like that and E3 on the other hand will now you know it's a wake-up call for

953
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,500
them it's a wake-up call for the industry for the you know for the fact

954
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:14,340
that this show went out it was just flooded with hype too much fat when

955
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:19,320
basically the whole purpose of E3 was to focus on you know the hardcore content

956
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,420
Zaku when was the public ever allowed in E3? I think in the earlier days

957
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:29,700
according to the Wikipedia it wasn't really that the public was allowed but I

958
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,980
mean my understanding is it was pretty easy to get in yes that's basically what

959
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:37,460
I'm saying okay let me restate that it was a lot easier to get all right fine

960
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:42,940
whatever okay so basically by adding the element of having the public involved

961
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,860
then you build a pipe you bring the hype to the people directly but at the same

962
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:50,340
time we're not one of the dangers about that is that people are gonna play these

963
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:55,620
demos at E3 and then go, well that game sucks, and when it wasn't really half finished.

964
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:59,500
The problem is that it's just too many people that aren't supposed to be there, and that's

965
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:04,540
one of the risks associated with opening a show of that magnitude to the public.

966
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,020
It will be too crowded.

967
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,260
I want to hear from some developers.

968
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:11,280
I'm excited for tomorrow, Monday, because I'm excited to hear from some developers about

969
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,780
what their plans are, because you know the commercial gaming folks that have access to

970
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,840
people like that are going to be asking those questions.

971
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:24,520
I'm really curious to see what they say the big three will do right they'll create their own shows with the same hype as e3

972
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:29,960
Yeah, and it's basically God. I hope I have enough frequent flyer miles. Yeah, that's true

973
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:35,640
If anything you could just outsource your your journalists, you know, you're you're reporting to other people online

974
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,480
Hey

975
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:43,560
we've always said we've always said we love to get reports from other people that can go to shows like this when we can't but

976
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,320
Nobody knows it

977
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:52,300
Yeah, but this would be a good call then to reiterate that well here is consider it reiterated email me

978
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:59,880
You can email myself personally or seal mail the mailbag. Hell. Yeah email Loki. He'll say sure go for it. Hey

979
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,340
But you do the mailbag. So yeah

980
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,360
No email 23rd maggots, so he'll make sure we find out

981
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:14,800
That's the best way to do it, by just spreading out, having like a network.

982
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:20,140
And so basically you'll come down to that, it'll be spread out.

983
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:24,800
When you're covering these shows, follow the OL Army principle of don't be a dick.

984
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:28,720
And remember, you don't represent Orange Lounge Radio, I just want to let the listeners

985
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,120
know that.

986
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,600
But if you want to send us fan stuff out there that you taped for us as a gift to us, go

987
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,600
for it.

988
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,600
Love it.

989
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:41,600
I mean, you can count all these other guys as contributors, and that's basically what we'll become anyways.

990
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,600
Yeah, works for me.

991
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,600
Nothing but good contributors.

992
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,600
Alright, Zaku, then go to Digital Life at your camcorder and send us some stuff back, alright?

993
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,600
I'll get you something from there, like I did last year.

994
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,600
Sounds- oh, that's right, our poster, remember, from Digital Life last year, so.

995
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,600
Alright, it's hanging up right here, right over Jamie's head.

996
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,600
Right.

997
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,600
In all of its Illustrator glory.

998
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,600
Hanging right next to the Jay and Silent Bob, all you motherfuckers are gonna pay.

999
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,800
are going to pay. You are the one who is going to wear the Bollicker's poster. Alright, Zaku,

1000
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:19,120
have a good one. Alright, you too. Bye. Well, that was an animated Skype line tonight. Half

1001
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:23,360
the calls were from New York City. I love New York City. Not a problem with New York

1002
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:28,520
City. I'm looking forward to going there very soon. New York City? Somebody get a rope.

1003
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:32,200
I haven't been to New York since I was in high school.

1004
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:36,200
It's a fun place. I played at Carnegie Hall. There's always stuff to do in New York City.

1005
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,840
It's true. Any last minute stories before we get into the final story of the night?

1006
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:45,120
I don't think so.

1007
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,600
Then I guess we go to the final story of the night. Oh, I'm sorry,

1008
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,720
I did have one. You lie! No, I was

1009
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:57,640
not lying. It's impossible! I was gonna mention there's a demo out there now

1010
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:02,040
if you have upgraded your PSP the firmware 2.8 for mercury meltdown

1011
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,960
so you can check that out for free and

1012
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,920
so I don't know I thought that was kind of neat not a

1013
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,080
reason I would go and upgrade mine to 2.8 although I should because

1014
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,680
I don't know I have nothing better to do with it but um

1015
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,120
yeah check it out anyways

1016
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,400
no that's it alright then let's go to our last story of the evening

1017
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,400
let's let's talk about what's wrong with this world

1018
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,240
and why Brazil just couldn't win the World Cup

1019
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,040
well the reason why they couldn't win the World Cup

1020
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,360
sex and PlayStation 2

1021
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:46,760
that's right. At least that's what they're blaming and I thought that was kind of funny

1022
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,360
but anywho

1023
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,680
yeah so

1024
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:59,720
Apparently, the reason why they're, you know, lead footballers out there, you know, getting

1025
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:05,200
too sexed up, which is apparently, I guess, against their rules during the World Cup,

1026
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:11,740
and playing too much FIFA 06 on PlayStation 2.

1027
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:17,400
Good at the game, but not good at the actual game, so it kinda sucks for him.

1028
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:23,160
Alright, then I think it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the

1029
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,160
DarkSakura, you've got a mic in your hand, why don't you start us off.

1030
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:33,160
Two, reject false icons, and I like beer.

1031
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,160
Loki, your final thought.

1032
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:40,160
My final thought is the king of all cosmos for some reason,

1033
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,160
it's the number five top gayest video game characters out there.

1034
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,160
What's number one?

1035
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,160
Tingle, or uh, Tingle, I think.

1036
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,160
Makes sense.

1037
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:54,440
uh... my final thought is uh... chicken wrapped in bacon

1038
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,280
twenty-three maggots your final thought

1039
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:00,540
I went to espattus for the first time this week so you know brazilian

1040
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,720
grill for those that

1041
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,060
don't know what kind of food that is

1042
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,660
it's just big hunks of meat getting thrown on your plate

1043
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:08,140
uh... maggots your final thought thanks for being here tonight

1044
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:12,100
