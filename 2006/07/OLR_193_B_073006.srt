4
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:23,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 193.

5
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:27,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Inching closer and closer to that magic 200 number.

10
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:59,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And now let's get back into some gaming news.

11
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:03,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start us off, if you guys are okay with that, DarkSakura and Loki.

12
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:04,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, no.

13
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, go ahead.

14
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:07,105
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't talk a lot last segment about the Wii.

15
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:09,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to bring up a story about the Wii.

16
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:15,989
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a rumor going around, and I emphasize the word rumor here, that Nintendo is sending out free Wii dev kits.

17
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:19,430
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a rumor from an insider that wrote to Kotaku.com.

18
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,014
[SPEAKER_02]: According to Kotaku, it seems Nintendo is giving Wii development kits to smaller studios.

19
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:32,259
[SPEAKER_02]: A developer in a coastal American city apparently received a package from Nintendo, and nobody was aware what was even inside.

20
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,221
[SPEAKER_02]: But the box was opened, and there was a Wii dev kit inside.

21
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this could be seen multiple ways.

22
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:52,005
[SPEAKER_02]: This might be a way for we to get indie developers to make games for the console, and it certainly would show a shift in Nintendo's attitude towards third-party supporters, maybe recognizing where some of the mistakes were with the GameCube.

23
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,508
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, hey, we really want third parties, indies, everybody on board with this.

24
00:01:56,548 --> 00:02:01,292
[SPEAKER_02]: So, certainly interesting if it's true, but it may not be true.

25
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:01,752
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still

26
00:02:02,584 --> 00:02:03,424
[SPEAKER_02]: A rumor at this time.

27
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:05,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the dev kits weren't that expensive anyways.

28
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they were like a grand or two.

29
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:10,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would hope not, considering the hardware is supposed to not be as much.

30
00:02:10,527 --> 00:02:15,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they put out an email now that has their DS lineup.

31
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:16,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, cool!

32
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:19,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what's coming out.

33
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:28,392
[SPEAKER_03]: There is October 9th Clubhouse Games, Nintendogs Dalmatian version on October 16th, October 23rd Magical Star Sign,

34
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:32,047
[SPEAKER_03]: In 30th, there's a Pokemon Ranger and Children of Mana.

35
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Children of Mana.

36
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,289
[SPEAKER_03]: November 6th has Elite Beat Agents.

37
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:37,930
[SPEAKER_03]: 13th, Yoshi's Island.

38
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,671
[SPEAKER_03]: December 4th is Custom Robo Arena and Kirby's Squeak Squad.

39
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:45,012
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's pretty awesome about that Clubhouse Games?

40
00:02:45,273 --> 00:02:45,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

41
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:49,834
[SPEAKER_09]: It's over Wi-Fi with all 48 games that are going to be in it.

42
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:50,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

43
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:55,397
[SPEAKER_09]: And, which might come into the show, PictoChat over Wi-Fi.

44
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right.

45
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember hearing about that.

46
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't this game already out somewhere else?

47
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called something else in other countries.

48
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,211
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's coming out in the UK.

49
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,732
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called 48 Collection or something like that.

50
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:06,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:08,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I first read about the game, that's what it was called.

52
00:03:09,112 --> 00:03:11,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, none of these games are nothing spectacular, right?

53
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:15,353
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of reminds me of those Hoyle collections that are available on the PC.

54
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:20,194
[SPEAKER_02]: But being able to play it over Wi-Fi with PictoChat, hooray.

55
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:23,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Drawn genitalia galore while playing Hearts.

56
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:25,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer Camp

57
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,241
[SPEAKER_02]: and Nintendo is actually holding a summer camp of their own.

58
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:47,503
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Camp Hyrule.

59
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:49,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's not a real camp.

60
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:51,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously it's about video games.

61
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:53,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, the idea is to stay indoors.

62
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:54,649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a virtual camp.

63
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:57,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not a lot is known about this.

64
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:59,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Camp Hyrule is going to have activities like

65
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.

66
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:01,895
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.

67
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:23,773
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a quote here, though.

68
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:35,190
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like to talk about video games, play practical jokes, and rub elbows with Nintendo's expert gamers, then get ready to meet new friends at Nintendo's Camp Hyrule 2006 and win prizes like T-shirts and magazines.

69
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:36,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Subscriptions while you're at it.

70
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:47,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming the week of August 14th through 18th, 2006, the rumored theme this year might be The Legend of Zelda, The Phantom Hourglass, Nintendo Wii, and Super Mario Galaxy.

71
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:53,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting because I noticed in DarkSakura's list of what's coming out for the DS, Phantom Hourglass wasn't even there.

72
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:55,427
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know what that means.

73
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:57,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was rumors that it was going to be delayed until next year.

74
00:04:58,849 --> 00:04:59,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

75
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:03,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, now Blaze Revolution in chat says Camp Hyrule is nothing new.

76
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,577
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been doing it for at least five years.

77
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:05,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they've been doing it for a while.

78
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:05,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

79
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:06,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of it.

80
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:07,460
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they do?

81
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

82
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,021
[SPEAKER_02]: How did I miss this?

83
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,422
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing this show how long now?

84
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:11,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never heard of this.

85
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:12,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Ever.

86
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:18,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is on the Nintendo site, Nintendo.com, so if you don't read that site, you probably won't.

87
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I do sometimes, but I don't know.

88
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:21,912
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fine.

89
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:25,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apparently have been living in a cave the past ten years, so fine.

90
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:27,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Are any of you guys doing Camp Hyrule?

91
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:27,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

92
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:28,636
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

93
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:29,837
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't sign up either.

94
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:32,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, eh, investment of my time.

95
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,060
[SPEAKER_02]: You might?

96
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I might.

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody needs to do it.

98
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone has to.

99
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:35,962
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

100
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:37,783
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to go represent the OL Army for us.

101
00:05:38,064 --> 00:05:38,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

102
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:41,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I remember Nestor and Howard.

103
00:05:41,346 --> 00:05:42,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I could get on this.

104
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:43,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Pimp the damn show.

105
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:44,489
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I mean.

106
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:45,149
[SPEAKER_02]: We need our folks.

107
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:46,530
[SPEAKER_02]: We need an OLR cabin.

108
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,711
[SPEAKER_02]: We need it.

109
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:48,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck it.

110
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:49,713
[SPEAKER_08]: We need Camp OLR.

111
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:50,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

112
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,434
[SPEAKER_08]: OL Army, assemble.

113
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:54,757
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be on that chess board in front of your apartment complex.

114
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:57,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally want to have a Campo LR.

115
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,493
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

116
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:03,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I want to do a real con thing or something, but we'll see.

117
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange con?

118
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:07,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange con.

119
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:07,778
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be rad.

120
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Someday, when we have lots and lots of money, we'll see what happens.

121
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:21,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, but one thing that did happen is an AMD and ATI merger.

122
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:22,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your enthusiasm, by the way.

123
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:23,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but...

124
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:25,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.

125
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,089
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, great transition.

126
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:29,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you, Loki.

127
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:46,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, yes, the $5.4 billion transaction took place last week with AMD purchasing ATI, and now you've got a big combination of both processors and graphics chips.

128
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:47,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Where will this lead?

129
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:49,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Who the fuck knows?

130
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:51,547
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where it's going to lead.

131
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:59,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably going to see some ATI-based graphics chips on AMD motherboards.

132
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:01,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

133
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:05,534
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is great news, though, for your PC gamer, I guess.

134
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:11,118
[SPEAKER_09]: But I always used to buy AMD chips for my PCs and ATI cards.

135
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:12,799
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess that works.

136
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

137
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:21,905
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm worried about, what if you're an AMD user with an NVIDIA video card?

138
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:23,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

139
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Then fuck you.

140
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,230
[SPEAKER_09]: You suck.

141
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:28,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

142
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:29,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Then go buy a Mac.

143
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:32,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Go buy a Mac.

144
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:35,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on here.

145
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:38,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get back on the Sandy bus.

146
00:07:39,594 --> 00:07:40,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, listen.

147
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:42,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I get my Mac in very soon.

148
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:43,276
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it.

149
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Just when I thought the hate mail for Loki would stop coming in.

150
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:50,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

151
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:50,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

152
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,932
[SPEAKER_03]: How about we just turn this right around?

153
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:56,273
[SPEAKER_09]: How about we turn this bus around right now?

154
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:58,535
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about PCs and gaming.

155
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:00,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Mac wouldn't be in there.

156
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:03,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Gee, I wish somebody had a story to save us right about now.

157
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:06,241
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that female otaku need love too?

158
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:07,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

159
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:09,003
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan, you can rent a friend.

160
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:11,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait.

161
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:13,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they horny gamer girls?

162
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:15,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, did you find out about this on Myspace?

163
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:17,329
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

164
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:18,726
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Kotaku.

165
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:19,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

166
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:20,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as bad.

167
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:20,407
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

168
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:21,308
[SPEAKER_03]: How much?

169
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:23,169
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you, Kotaku.

170
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,430
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cool.

171
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Five dollars.

172
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:26,891
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

173
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:31,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually 12,000 yen for two and a half hours of friendship.

174
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait.

175
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:34,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, but this is not like a whore thing.

176
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:35,276
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

177
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:36,857
[SPEAKER_02]: This is girls for other girls.

178
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:40,579
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called the Secret Otaku Support Commission.

179
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:47,203
[SPEAKER_03]: They rent out women who are knowledgeable in video game culture to girl gamers who got no friends.

180
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:55,321
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to pay for friends, I join a frat.

181
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, so many college memories just came back to me.

182
00:08:57,702 --> 00:09:03,124
[SPEAKER_03]: As it's said by Seiji Hirokawa, who is their creator and operator.

183
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:04,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny that it's a man.

184
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:10,826
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, we're an otaku dispatch agency that caters exclusively to female clientele.

185
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:16,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Many women otaku don't have other women otaku to talk to, and they get pretty lonely.

186
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:16,968
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we come in.

187
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:24,253
[SPEAKER_03]: They charge 12,000 yen, basically 120 bucks for two and a half hours of friendship.

188
00:09:24,593 --> 00:09:27,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you a lonely, lonely girl?

189
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:28,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick up the phone!

190
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:33,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been a bad, lonely girl playing your video games all night long?

191
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:37,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want someone to play your games with?

192
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want someone to come over and have a pillow fight with you?

193
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:44,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Otaku Female Rental Service is for you!

194
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:46,832
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very... I don't know.

195
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,333
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just something kind of scary about it.

196
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:52,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just the cultural difference or whatever, but there's something almost predatory about this whole thing.

197
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:53,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

198
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:54,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just me?

199
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:55,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, would you pay for this?

200
00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:57,496
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have friends.

201
00:09:58,737 --> 00:09:59,117
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

202
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:00,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd pay for that.

203
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:01,117
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

204
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:02,118
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a pillow fight this weekend.

205
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:02,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot.

206
00:10:03,158 --> 00:10:05,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway... Rob, shh.

207
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:11,141
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm not too surprised that a man is selling women to, you know, clientele.

208
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:14,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, pimps have been around for ages, so... But...

209
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:25,612
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm really surprised about is why an Asian chick that likes games and otaku stuff can't get some nerdy guy to be her friend.

210
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:26,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on.

211
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:29,653
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where we need to be importing them, okay?

212
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like, you know, there's Russian wives.

213
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:34,434
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to get the Asian gamer chicks to come in.

214
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:39,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Import them in, you know, and... Because we've got the demand here.

215
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:40,335
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the supply there.

216
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:41,336
[SPEAKER_09]: It's perfect.

217
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:42,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw that.

218
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Just export me.

219
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:45,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done with that.

220
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:48,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

221
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:48,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we look into that?

222
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:49,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

223
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:51,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

224
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:55,692
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

225
00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:58,155
[SPEAKER_09]: That is excellent news.

226
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm scared.

227
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:01,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the chat room's got the wrong idea of me.

228
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:03,899
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Justin in our chat room.

229
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:04,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how else to pronounce it.

230
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just Justin, but it's in elite speak.

231
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:07,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Justin.

232
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:10,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Justin says, I think Sky is suited well for a phone sex line.

233
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:12,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of scary to me.

234
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:14,488
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not my bag, baby.

235
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:16,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

236
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:17,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please, anyways.

237
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:28,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of women, a certain game coming out soon, Dead Rising, which is awesome, rewards you for...

238
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:56,732
[SPEAKER_09]: taking erotic pictures of women um actually yeah one of the genres of pictures you can take in the game besides you know horror and drama and stuff like that is erotic erotica and they have a perfect picture of one of the leads in there i guess in fishnet stockings and lingerie and uh you're taking pictures of her and one of the focal points is her breasts and it's perfect and you get um prestige points for that it's kind of like experience points in the games but it's kind of interesting though because um

239
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,832
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also take erotic zombie pictures.

240
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:04,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Erotic zombie pictures?

241
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:04,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

242
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:06,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Erotic zombie pictures.

243
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Why didn't they just call the game that?

244
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:13,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't they just call the damn game erotic zombie pictures?

245
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:15,089
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how many more copies would have sold?

246
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,510
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a simple 2000 series, okay?

247
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,872
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a cool game.

248
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:21,910
[SPEAKER_02]: How many more copies would have sold?

249
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead Rising, you had to tell me about what this game was about before I was interested in it.

250
00:12:26,232 --> 00:12:27,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had to see the preview.

251
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:34,456
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you told me there was a game on the market called Erotic Zombie Pictures, I would have been like, say no more.

252
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:34,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Sold.

253
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:35,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Sold!

254
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:38,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know that was your bag.

255
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:42,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think it's pretty awesome.

256
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:47,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, you can also get points by just

257
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:48,673
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, pretty much doing everything.

258
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:49,314
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this.

259
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,154
[SPEAKER_09]: This is actually translated from Famitsu Magazine.

260
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:58,517
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have, it says, and this is the exact, you know, English translation.

261
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:10,041
[SPEAKER_09]: If the sexy survivor you rescue by the chance arrival which photographs the seductive scene because also sexy acquisition PP increases.

262
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:11,941
[SPEAKER_09]: PP being prestige points.

263
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:13,502
[SPEAKER_09]: You dirty bastards out there.

264
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:16,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm, okay.

265
00:13:16,903 --> 00:13:17,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it,

266
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:22,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Just The Woman, also, it is... How can you not comment on that?

267
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,244
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you just overlook that blatant reference there?

268
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:28,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, the debt is rising.

269
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:30,167
Oh, God.

270
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah.

271
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:36,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio, everybody.

272
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It was lovely knowing you these past four years.

273
00:13:38,174 --> 00:13:42,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the jokes, we've suffocated ourselves on the bad jokes tonight, and we're dying.

274
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:44,200
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be an awesome game.

275
00:13:45,503 --> 00:13:46,344
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna be an awesome game.

276
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:48,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Just buy it for the awesomeness in the game.

277
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:53,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I knew right away when they saw the little publicity shots of who the characters are gonna be in the game.

278
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:57,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we're talking like horny otaku women.

279
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:06,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a quote from Mystery Science 3000 to quote in regards to the whole taking pictures of half-naked girls.

280
00:14:06,237 --> 00:14:07,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Erotic zombie pictures?

281
00:14:08,218 --> 00:14:09,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whoop-dee-shit.

282
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:13,041
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your outlook on that?

283
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:15,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you excited to be taking erotic pictures?

284
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I love zombies, but not that much.

285
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:22,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce Campbell, yes.

286
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:25,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I need the human chin to come talk to me.

287
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:29,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you use, like, because you can use anything to kill things in Dead Rising, right?

288
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:29,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

289
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:30,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you use pants?

290
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:32,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

291
00:14:33,314 --> 00:14:39,319
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on if you mean in the American sense or the British sense because if you use someone's stinky pants, then yes, probably.

292
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:44,144
[SPEAKER_09]: You can dress up like a little kid and you can wear stinky pants.

293
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:48,007
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, if Bruce Campbell is listening to this podcast, come hang out with us.

294
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:48,788
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to interview you.

295
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,626
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

296
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,783
[SPEAKER_09]: The rule, like, it's just weird, okay?

297
00:15:07,843 --> 00:15:09,764
[SPEAKER_09]: You take weird pictures and stuff.

298
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:13,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how far it goes into the erotic stuff, but whatever.

299
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:16,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, none of this shark jumping talk.

300
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:17,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, chat room?

301
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,609
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we haven't.

302
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:19,309
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we haven't.

303
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,290
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

304
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,631
[SPEAKER_02]: If we jump the shark, that happened a long time ago.

305
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:26,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know... If we jump the shark, we are going to literally jump over a shark.

306
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:28,335
[SPEAKER_02]: We jumped the shark episode two.

307
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:32,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie skipped town on episode two of Orange Launch Radio, if you guys remember.

308
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:34,118
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, let's move on.

309
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:35,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

310
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:45,202
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2, how we love thee and your cheap games because there's cheaper games coming out for the PlayStation 2 thanks to a new greatest hits collection.

311
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:59,868
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, 1999 will buy you Jack X, Combat Racing, SOCOM 3, Sly 3, Honor Among Thieves, Ratchet Deadlocked, and sure to excite folks everywhere, Shadow of the Colossus.

312
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:01,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

313
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:11,022
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea when that is supposedly coming out, but it's the next series according to a leak from Circuit City, which I imagine will be very soon.

314
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:13,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll have the release coming soon, probably.

315
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:13,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

316
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:16,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Also getting greatest hits, I just want to mention real quick, is the PSP.

317
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are also going to be $19.99.

318
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:25,952
[SPEAKER_02]: ATV Off-Road Fury, Ape Escape On The Loose, Hot Shots Golf, Twisted Metal Head-On, and Wipeout Pier.

319
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:28,135
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68 says no Luminous for the lose

320
00:16:55,478 --> 00:16:56,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that kind of sucks.

321
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they want to suck all the money they can out of that stupid thing.

322
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,500
[SPEAKER_09]: But, whatever.

323
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:03,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a personal bone to pick about Luminous.

324
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:03,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

325
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:06,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't get Luminous 2 to install on my phone.

326
00:17:07,664 --> 00:17:09,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you tried to get the cell version?

327
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:09,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

328
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:10,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know it was out.

329
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:13,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it wouldn't install, stupid network.

330
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally going to try and see if I can get that game.

331
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:17,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

332
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, the former manager of Sony's...

333
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:29,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Third Party Relations has left and actually went to Ubisoft, which is kind of interesting.

334
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, people leaving Sony, I guess that's not really big news.

335
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:40,696
[SPEAKER_09]: What is big news is they're saying that they've sent out over 10,000 PS3 dev kits.

336
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:44,238
[SPEAKER_09]: So, wow, lots of dev kits going out there.

337
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,861
[SPEAKER_09]: But all the dev kits in the world won't make that system any cheaper.

338
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but it might get more games worthy of you to talk about.

339
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:53,037
[SPEAKER_02]: More games, I'm hoping.

340
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:54,118
[SPEAKER_09]: More exclusive games.

341
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:56,800
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a good thing they've sent them out.

342
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Because before, I remember they were saying that it's really costly to develop for it.

343
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:09,447
[SPEAKER_09]: And so those 10,000 dev kits to over 208 companies in 11 countries.

344
00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:10,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

345
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:16,952
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's apparently the largest on any PlayStation platform to date.

346
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:18,313
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's actually pretty cool.

347
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:19,933
[SPEAKER_03]: That is pretty cool.

348
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:25,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of cool, and actually, you know, we brought this up last week with the release dates.

349
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,030
[SPEAKER_03]: EA is bringing out Sims 2 Pets.

350
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:32,655
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some details on this.

351
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:40,712
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually is going to be a PC expansion, standalone for PS2, GameCube, PSP, Nintendo DS, and Game Boy Advance.

352
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:47,776
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have kitty cat, and puppy dogs, and guinea pigs, and birds, and whatever else they decide to put in there.

353
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,017
[SPEAKER_03]: You can create... Penguins?

354
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:51,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, raw penguins.

355
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

356
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:53,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

357
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:01,403
[SPEAKER_03]: You can create your own pet, and customize everything from fur to body, personality, you can make them smart puppies, or...

358
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:03,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid guinea pigs.

359
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:04,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Evil purple penguins?

360
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:07,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Rob, evil purple penguins.

361
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:08,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

362
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:10,719
[SPEAKER_03]: You can name them Bob.

363
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Ari Masa wants to know snakes?

364
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:15,523
[SPEAKER_03]: On a plane?

365
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:18,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Ba-dum-bum.

366
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

367
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:26,031
[SPEAKER_03]: You can teach your pets to shake, roll over, play dead, you know, dig up dead bodies, that type of thing.

368
00:19:27,172 --> 00:19:31,595
[SPEAKER_03]: No, if you catch your puppies digging in the garden or scratching up the furniture, you'll have to spank.

369
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:34,793
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'll be taking them to go get spayed or neutered.

370
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:43,038
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also use codes where you can share accessories, fur, markings, that type of thing.

371
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,919
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you can make skins for your pets.

372
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Different versions will have different things.

373
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:52,544
[SPEAKER_03]: PC will let you have designer pets like labrapoodles and puggles and schnoodles.

374
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:56,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you breed hamsters with dogs?

375
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:57,066
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

376
00:19:57,086 --> 00:19:57,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Or cats?

377
00:19:57,526 --> 00:19:57,887
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

378
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I breed a pig with an elephant?

379
00:20:00,928 --> 00:20:01,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

380
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:01,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

381
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:07,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And your creative pet, you can actually create them as unique pedigrees and put them online.

382
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:15,555
[SPEAKER_03]: They can actually have career paths, which is a show pet security or service with five job levels apiece.

383
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:20,037
[SPEAKER_03]: The PS2, GameCube, PSP versions will let you take them for a walk in the park.

384
00:20:20,377 --> 00:20:21,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they make friends with other animals.

385
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:27,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the hamster have an employment path of sex toy?

386
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:28,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

387
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes with a cardboard tube.

388
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you take erotic pictures of the pets?

389
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:37,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you kill them by drowning them?

390
00:20:37,594 --> 00:20:42,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the PS2, GameCube, and PSP, are all getting like Nintendogs version, basically.

391
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the parrots have large talons?

392
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:46,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, shut up.

393
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:54,692
[SPEAKER_03]: On the DS, you can have a pet care center, and other owners can come to have you take care of their pets.

394
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:56,054
[SPEAKER_03]: You have shops and...

395
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:59,873
[SPEAKER_03]: You can earn money by having a pet shop, basically.

396
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:05,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Game Boy Advance one will have different careers for the sim, including veterinarian and pet trainer.

397
00:21:05,854 --> 00:21:06,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they can become rabid.

398
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:12,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Blaze Revolution in our chatroom, orangelawntrainer.com, click on chat, says, I want a Liger.

399
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:14,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that Napoleon Dynamite.

400
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:15,375
[SPEAKER_02]: So funny.

401
00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:17,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I want an Octocat, actually.

402
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,496
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Kibbles and Bits says, man, we need Spore already.

403
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:23,397
[SPEAKER_02]: In talks of all these, you know, make your animals game.

404
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give us Spore.

405
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:27,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it, EA, just give us Spore.

406
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:27,785
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.

407
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is sounding a little too much like, what was it, RTS?

408
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:32,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Impossible Creatures, if you remember that.

409
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:36,807
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so hardcore.

410
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:49,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, speaking of cool stuff coming out, the Wii, basically, Ubisoft in the UK has confirmed that Red Steel's coming out in November in the UK.

411
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:52,210
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that mean to us, though?

412
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Well...

413
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:54,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a damn thing.

414
00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:55,490
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple things, though.

415
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Red Steel is supposed to be a launch title.

416
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Red Steel is supposed to be coming, or the Wii is supposed to be coming out before the PlayStation 3.

417
00:22:03,993 --> 00:22:04,473
[SPEAKER_09]: That we know.

418
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:09,194
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for example, the PlayStation 3 is coming out in mid-November.

419
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:12,155
[SPEAKER_09]: So, therefore, this has to be coming out early November.

420
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:17,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in the UK, and the UK is probably going to be getting the Wii a few weeks after us.

421
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,878
[SPEAKER_09]: What's a couple weeks before November?

422
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:22,099
[SPEAKER_09]: October 18th.

423
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:34,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so sick of all these news stories about the Wii's speculated release date.

424
00:22:34,123 --> 00:22:36,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the damn thing will come out when it comes out.

425
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:40,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess which date I had in my system when they put Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam.

426
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:40,843
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

427
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:08,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to kind of feel bad if it doesn't come out October 18th.

428
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:10,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to feel like Reggie personally fucked with us.

429
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:15,597
[SPEAKER_09]: He's all, I'll show you, think you know when it's coming out, bastards.

430
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:19,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, how you like them apples?

431
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:25,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari Mawson in chat says Zelda Twilight Princess is scheduled for November, though, and that game's coming out on launch day.

432
00:23:26,384 --> 00:23:30,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but there's been no official date announced for Twilight Princess because...

433
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,742
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be the day that the Wii comes out, so obviously they're not going to announce that.

434
00:23:35,143 --> 00:23:37,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, by the way, Twilight Princess is coming out this day.

435
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:39,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, crap.

436
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:40,547
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to do that.

437
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:42,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, we have a huge scoop for you guys.

438
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:43,769
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii is out right now.

439
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:47,251
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, go to your local GameStop or EB Games and ask for one.

440
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:48,252
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll love you for it.

441
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:53,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the store tells you they don't have them yet, they're playing a joke on you.

442
00:23:53,636 --> 00:23:54,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to another store and ask.

443
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:56,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

444
00:23:57,118 --> 00:23:58,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, I hope you guys know I'm kidding.

445
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't.

446
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:01,384
[SPEAKER_09]: It's super secret.

447
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:08,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's nothing one of those employees at those stores loves more than people coming in going, Do you have the Wii yet?

448
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:22,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, speaking of lies and speculation, there's been a lot of rumors going around to what some of the secrets of the Wii and what they might be.

449
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:29,014
[SPEAKER_09]: So, anyways, some speculation here we've got for you, including this is apparently from...

450
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:37,728
[SPEAKER_09]: The full scope of the Wii controller details have yet to be revealed by Pixar and Nintendo Although I cannot elaborate

451
00:24:53,082 --> 00:25:03,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further, let me say that Nintendo should show that movement in 3D space will allow experiences outside of just the TV screen, and it's not 3D projection related.

452
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:13,701
[SPEAKER_09]: But this also kind of, if you think about it, goes back to that one article we had about Red Steel and how some of the multiplayer won't take place on TV, which is interesting.

453
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:27,658
[SPEAKER_09]: The first game that's going to be shown to the public that will demonstrate the full scope of the Wii controller potential will be Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2, which is also scheduled for October, by the way.

454
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,142
[SPEAKER_09]: That's for all systems, including the Wii.

455
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:41,377
[SPEAKER_09]: The sensor bar was in all actuality in no use at E3.

456
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:44,279
[SPEAKER_09]: What it will allow hasn't been shown yet.

457
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:48,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but interesting.

458
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:59,929
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, according to people who are working close with everyday events at Nintendo Research and Development, Nintendo Wii specifications were far and away developed solely for the machine.

459
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:03,536
[SPEAKER_09]: and says apparently that the specs keep changing on it.

460
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:18,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Also that there's plans on maybe doing a Wii headset for the online capability and they might even go further in having it have a gyroscope inside of the headset for game use.

461
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:19,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

462
00:26:21,383 --> 00:26:24,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it far-fetched, some of it maybe.

463
00:26:24,944 --> 00:26:25,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

464
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:26,905
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

465
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:27,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Roar.

466
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Here come the FUs of the week, boys and girls.

467
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:15,377
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes toward websites that use flash ads that have sound on them.

468
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:23,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you go on Myspace and you hear SMACK THE BUG to win a million dollars.

469
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:29,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like whatever site that was playing the sounds of death and I couldn't find what ad it was to turn it off.

470
00:27:31,224 --> 00:27:33,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a big, stinky pile of poo on that.

471
00:27:34,497 --> 00:27:59,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, um, you know, FU to IGN, and FU to IGN for one reason, and I've covered this before, Jessica Chobot, I don't like her, and the reason I don't like her is because she's, it's like a Paris Hilton situation here, famous for no apparent reason, famous because of something stupid, famous because she licked a PSP, come on now, and now they have her in like this

472
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,236
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week goes to my facial hair for growing too fast.

473
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:05,557
[SPEAKER_09]: As you can see, I was too lazy to shave today.

474
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:05,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Or yesterday.

475
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,591
[SPEAKER_02]: and I practically have a beard at this point.

476
00:28:32,572 --> 00:28:35,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So, an FU to the, and an FU to the inflating cost of razors.

477
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:38,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus!

478
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:44,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, my, uh, FU this week is the same as last week.

479
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:46,500
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to my air conditioner.

480
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the compressor took a shit, they have to replace the whole unit.

481
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, we're not gonna replace the whole unit, we're just gonna fix all we have.

482
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:58,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, make a decision and get to it because it's still like 90 degrees in my den.

483
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:03,167
[SPEAKER_08]: My computer will not work right, and it's just a big pain in the ass.

484
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:05,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

485
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for keeping the angst quick tonight, guys.

486
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:10,453
[SPEAKER_09]: It allows us to move on to another story.

487
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:16,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, speaking of fun stuff, this week Fusion Frenzy 2 was announced.

488
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those who might not remember, it was a really cool game that was on the Xbox.

489
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:27,127
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's basically a collection of about, you know, 40 or so minigames.

490
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:45,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this time they're going to be having more mini-games as well, over 40, and set on seven different planets, as well as online multiplayer matches and tournaments, and it says players will be able to use tournament cards they've earned for a variety of purposes, including selecting the next game to be played or choosing the next planet to go to.

491
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:51,200
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it sounds like a pretty fun little 360 game, and it's set to hit the stores this holiday season.

492
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're having a hard time playing through Fusion Frenzy 1, maybe you ought to get a tutor!

493
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:03,887
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wall Street Journal has recently run a report on gamers who are using their skills to help pay the rent.

494
00:30:04,827 --> 00:30:08,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what they're doing is they're setting up this whole enterprise here.

495
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:22,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing as gamers that work all day have not a lot of time to perfect their skills, gaming-lessons.com has this guy, Tom Taylor,

496
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:30,483
[SPEAKER_02]: who you pay $45 for an hour and he will turn you into an expert master chief.

497
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:35,487
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think about hiring tutors to get better at games?

498
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:43,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I guess, an interesting idea for them to use to make money, but no.

499
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:44,856
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

500
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:50,106
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, if you're questioning whether this is legit or anything, what can this guy do for me?

501
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:55,890
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the guy who also just signed this big fat quarter million dollar contract to play Halo, essentially.

502
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well how's he going to teach me to play something other than Halo?

503
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:01,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

504
00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:06,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Well maybe if the business model works here, then it can work elsewhere.

505
00:31:06,136 --> 00:31:07,057
[SPEAKER_09]: So what kind of a tutor is he?

506
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:11,634
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like saying, I'm a master at fractions.

507
00:31:11,975 --> 00:31:14,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, can you teach me some multiplication?

508
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:16,037
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a master at fractions.

509
00:31:17,138 --> 00:31:17,498
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

510
00:31:18,518 --> 00:31:18,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

511
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,419
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of dumb.

512
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually kind of curious.

513
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to look at this site real quick.

514
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:24,962
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gaming-lessons.com.

515
00:31:25,942 --> 00:31:26,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

516
00:31:26,903 --> 00:31:28,844
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a gaming lessons store available?

517
00:31:28,864 --> 00:31:32,466
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like they have some free, you know, sold-out lessons.

518
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:32,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

519
00:31:33,246 --> 00:31:33,987
[SPEAKER_02]: People are buying these.

520
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:35,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds oddly familiar.

521
00:31:35,408 --> 00:31:37,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like that whole Penny Arcade Academy of...

522
00:31:38,444 --> 00:31:41,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I would laugh at that idea.

523
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fair enough.

524
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:09,984
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a comment on that, you can always send it into our mailbag, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

525
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:16,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And every week, DarkSakura likes to dig into the mailbag and pull out her favorite letters that hopefully aren't too moldy.

526
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them had some funk on them.

527
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:20,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And was it convention funk?

528
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as bad as fanboy funk.

529
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:23,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

530
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:29,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, she's going to open up that mailbag right now, kids, and pull out some of her favorite letters to share with us right now.

531
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:35,266
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our emails comes from Ion671.

532
00:32:35,726 --> 00:32:39,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to read the whole thing, but he calls us the OL Army Generals.

533
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:40,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty funny.

534
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:43,249
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Senior Sergeant to you.

535
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, General is above Sergeant.

536
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, it doesn't matter.

537
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making a Warcraft joke, but whatever.

538
00:32:51,211 --> 00:32:52,332
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are music game fans.

539
00:32:52,352 --> 00:32:55,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any favorite game soundtracks from any game, music game or not?

540
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:56,893
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite is definitely Jet Set Radio.

541
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's a really broad question.

542
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you want like recent game soundtracks or old school stuff?

543
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:06,452
[SPEAKER_03]: You were singing Wonga Midnight Maximum.

544
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:08,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love Wonga.

545
00:33:08,092 --> 00:33:11,813
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as like a non-rhythm game, oh yeah, that's got a great soundtrack for driving.

546
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:16,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck, I'll use that soundtrack, well at least the cuts I have, I don't have the whole thing, I need to re-get it.

547
00:33:17,214 --> 00:33:19,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use the cuts when I play Xbox 360 driving games.

548
00:33:20,115 --> 00:33:27,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Like instead of EA tracks, because I don't really like a lot of that stuff, I'll listen to that music while playing driving games.

549
00:33:27,157 --> 00:33:27,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

550
00:33:28,021 --> 00:33:29,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I've told you you have access to all my stuff.

551
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:31,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I just keep forgetting.

552
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:36,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix had a kick-ass soundtrack, in my opinion.

553
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:38,507
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go new school.

554
00:33:38,527 --> 00:33:44,069
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go really old school, I like soundtracks like Super Metroid, but it's really old.

555
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, anything you want to suggest?

556
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:48,552
[SPEAKER_09]: What was a really fun one I had?

557
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:51,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I had my car, Gran Turismo, the first one.

558
00:33:51,894 --> 00:33:54,895
[SPEAKER_09]: That had a pretty decent soundtrack.

559
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:55,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Rez?

560
00:33:56,707 --> 00:33:57,427
[SPEAKER_09]: and Space Channel 5.

561
00:33:57,467 --> 00:34:00,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Justin and Chat wins Symphony of the Night.

562
00:34:25,593 --> 00:34:25,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Win.

563
00:34:26,394 --> 00:34:30,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, actually, actually, I have many... I love Symphony of the Night soundtrack, especially the Saturn one.

564
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:33,420
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the remixes of Bloody Tears and Vampire Hunter.

565
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:33,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

566
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:48,254
[SPEAKER_03]: But I actually will take my... I actually burned off all the music off of my Rondo of Blood just to listen to the remixed versions of all the old school Castlevania tunes.

567
00:34:48,814 --> 00:34:49,675
[SPEAKER_03]: That and there's just...

568
00:34:50,814 --> 00:34:50,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Choo!

569
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:50,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Choo!

570
00:34:51,114 --> 00:34:51,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Choo!

571
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:21,705
[SPEAKER_03]: She used to be the real life anime girl is what her whole deal was.

572
00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:29,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently she gave a shot of her business to the crowd at CoastCon about five years ago.

573
00:35:30,327 --> 00:35:30,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Home lighting.

574
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:32,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Kitchenware.

575
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:37,129
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get this from an eyewitness, by the way.

576
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email before I say something really bad.

577
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going down a troublesome path.

578
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed to be shown the light.

579
00:35:45,951 --> 00:35:47,191
[SPEAKER_03]: The Grand Theft Auto New Wave one.

580
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:47,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

581
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:48,568
[SPEAKER_03]: A-Ryth Dying

582
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:18,773
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's basically displeased with the fanboys on the internet.

583
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:28,980
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a one-up club for people who are into the same games as he is and people are all like blah blah blah blah blah and he tried to ask them nicely not to and they were being rude back.

584
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,882
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, that's the nature of the internet.

585
00:36:32,902 --> 00:36:34,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I think isn't there an abuse report?

586
00:36:34,383 --> 00:36:36,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm biting my tongue so bad right now you don't even know.

587
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:38,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Get off of one-up, start a Yahoo group.

588
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:42,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

589
00:36:43,629 --> 00:36:43,989
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?

590
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,690
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

591
00:36:45,467 --> 00:36:48,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Get off of Yahoo and go to OrangeLunchRadio.com Exactly.

592
00:36:48,848 --> 00:36:50,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang out with us.

593
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:50,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Start a website.

594
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:51,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Start a real website.

595
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:52,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving on.

596
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Our friend Rob with two B's sends us an email.

597
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:58,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

598
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:02,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some fuel for the fire the next time you discuss watching your own children.

599
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:05,854
[SPEAKER_03]: My nephews visited yesterday.

600
00:37:05,894 --> 00:37:07,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Their mom had no clue which games they owned.

601
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:08,935
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns out that Neil...

602
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:13,607
[SPEAKER_03]: that only the ones I gave them, all appropriate for kids, are the ones they had.

603
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:15,527
[SPEAKER_03]: But talking with the kids made me realize something.

604
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:18,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Your children will be exposed to almost every game made through their friends.

605
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:20,670
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a rough realization.

606
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:25,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite your best efforts, little Johnny Doe will have Resident Evil on his DS because Mommy bought it for him.

607
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:28,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny will show the other kids, regardless of age, including your own.

608
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:38,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, as long as one's parent doesn't care which games their kids play, no amount of laws will be effective or even practical in keeping that game away from your own children unless you live under a rock.

609
00:37:38,877 --> 00:37:44,518
[SPEAKER_03]: You can only battle this type of outside influence by teaching your kids to understand what is real, what is fantasy, and why they're different.

610
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:45,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen!

611
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:47,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Nail on the head.

612
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, now this is something that I had actually half thought of getting for myself.

613
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:56,841
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd been discussing it.

614
00:37:57,701 --> 00:38:02,543
[SPEAKER_03]: We got an email from... Ooh, I think our connection just hiccuped.

615
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:07,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we got an email from...

616
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:21,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Gareth, who asked about the GP2X, which is the sequel to the GP32, which comes from Korea.

617
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:25,893
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an open source handheld system.

618
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:34,495
[SPEAKER_03]: You can load, as he says in here, I can play loads of classic emulated games, watch videos and podcasts all on one device.

619
00:38:34,535 --> 00:38:35,235
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at GP2X.com.

620
00:38:38,297 --> 00:38:40,438
[SPEAKER_03]: or gp2x.co.uk.

621
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:44,959
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I want to thank the listeners.

622
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:46,440
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a completely different random topic.

623
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:55,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember who suggested it to me, but somebody suggested the front row application for the Mac and how you can install it on a Mac that it didn't really come with.

624
00:38:55,782 --> 00:38:59,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been great for my laptop for video podcasts and movies and stuff.

625
00:38:59,844 --> 00:39:02,424
[SPEAKER_02]: You talking about a device that would play all that kind of made me think of that.

626
00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:07,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I've decided when I buy my Mac, I'm going to be getting the Virtual XP.

627
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:09,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot who told me about that, but thank you.

628
00:39:10,603 --> 00:39:12,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.

629
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:25,426
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one comes, the last one I'm going to point at tonight is actually a question that comes from Skater Dude.

630
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:32,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Orange Nails Radio, I was wondering about how the DS sales are dramatically larger than the PSP sales.

631
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:34,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it is because the DS is cheaper or what?

632
00:39:34,968 --> 00:39:35,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Please give me your thoughts.

633
00:39:35,908 --> 00:39:36,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the show.

634
00:39:38,035 --> 00:39:38,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I like my white light.

635
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:09,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, there'll be a cooler color that all the cool kids want.

636
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:11,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do you have a white one?

637
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:15,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more emails?

638
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:16,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, Rob.

639
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:17,290
[SPEAKER_03]: S-T-F-U.

640
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thanks.

641
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:19,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

642
00:40:19,431 --> 00:40:20,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more emails?

643
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:21,973
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there aren't.

644
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:32,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we should have more emails sent to us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Tell us how much you love it when I make those jokes that make Jamie uncomfortable.

645
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:34,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope to hear from you

646
00:40:45,888 --> 00:40:53,330
[SPEAKER_09]: The creator of Electroplankton's brand new project, the Tenori On, would be something that you'll want to talk about.

647
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:59,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, Toshio Iwai is coming up with this brand new device.

648
00:40:59,472 --> 00:41:08,135
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a 16 by 16 grid of LCD switches, or LED switches, which are used to actually play music.

649
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:11,916
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can kind of use this to create your own mixes

650
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:28,941
[SPEAKER_09]: He actually has a website that you can visit, which is www.global.yamaha.com slash design slash tenori dash on, which is T-E-N-O-R-I dash O-N.

651
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:30,982
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can check it out.

652
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:33,723
[SPEAKER_09]: The device looks pretty interesting.

653
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:39,826
[SPEAKER_09]: He says that anybody can use it to make music, and it looks kind of sexy.

654
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:42,780
[SPEAKER_09]: So kind of a neat little device there.

655
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's anything like electroplankton, it should be pretty awesome.

656
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:49,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know some people that played a lot of electroplankton.

657
00:41:49,782 --> 00:41:51,322
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, so much they were addicted.

658
00:41:51,562 --> 00:41:58,504
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might remember on a previous program, episode of Orange Launch Radio, we talked about the Dutch Game Addiction Clinic.

659
00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:03,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were talking about all that, the folks that were signing up to go to this clinic.

660
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:03,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?

661
00:42:04,206 --> 00:42:08,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since this hit some of the mainstream news, apparently...

662
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:14,926
[SPEAKER_02]: The gaming treatment program has been inundated with calls from parents wanting to get their kids in this.

663
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:23,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Clinic director Keith Becker explained, Computer game addiction is obviously an even greater problem than we imagined.

664
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything okay?

665
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,451
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nothing.

666
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:28,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

667
00:42:30,432 --> 00:42:31,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Just making sure.

668
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:34,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounded like there was something bad going on over there.

669
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:38,982
[SPEAKER_03]: You're having a little too much fun here.

670
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:44,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say something about that name, however, I don't want to reveal where I... Does the game addiction thing strike a chord with you?

671
00:42:45,484 --> 00:42:46,264
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not addicted.

672
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:46,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Much.

673
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:59,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, it is conceded that video game addiction, also by the same guy, quote, is not a chemical dependency, but it's got everything of an obsessive-compulsive disorder and all the other stuff that comes with chemical dependencies.

674
00:43:00,268 --> 00:43:01,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, interesting.

675
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:05,269
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I know there was another related story that talked about some guy was so addicted to video games...

676
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:09,233
[SPEAKER_02]: that he never left his room and he peed in a bottle or something like that.

677
00:43:09,313 --> 00:43:10,453
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

678
00:43:10,774 --> 00:43:17,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, dude, that guy had more problems of being addicted to video games because I don't know in what universe that's considered sanitary by any means.

679
00:43:17,777 --> 00:43:19,218
[SPEAKER_03]: That's obsessive compulsive disorder.

680
00:43:19,238 --> 00:43:20,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's something else going on there.

681
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:22,019
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more than game addiction.

682
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,140
[SPEAKER_02]: That's craziness.

683
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:23,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

684
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,382
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs professional help, absolutely.

685
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:27,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

686
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:38,114
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm kind of weary about these people just having the parents call in and say, oh yeah, my kids are addicted to games because they just play them a lot and stuff.

687
00:43:38,134 --> 00:43:40,716
[SPEAKER_09]: And it kind of reminds me of that But I'm a Cheerleader movie.

688
00:43:41,857 --> 00:43:44,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is our chat room supporting the peeing in a bottle thing?

689
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is this just an internet chat thing?

690
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:48,923
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Eddie saying, pee in a bottle for the win.

691
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Cage says, peeing in a bottle is awesome.

692
00:43:51,485 --> 00:43:52,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's liberating.

693
00:43:52,907 --> 00:43:59,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the only time when it's ever socially acceptable to pee in a bottle is when you just can't pull over for some reason.

694
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,691
[SPEAKER_02]: At the doctor's office.

695
00:44:01,831 --> 00:44:02,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fine.

696
00:44:03,092 --> 00:44:08,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you have cancer and have a colostomy and have to pee in a bottle.

697
00:44:08,194 --> 00:44:08,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

698
00:44:08,655 --> 00:44:10,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all medically necessary reasons.

699
00:44:10,655 --> 00:44:20,920
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, because you're too lazy to put down the controller for five seconds of Halo 2 and go pee, it doesn't take that long to pee.

700
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:22,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Poop socks.

701
00:44:23,107 --> 00:44:24,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to go to number two.

702
00:44:24,568 --> 00:44:25,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to go there.

703
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,432
[SPEAKER_02]: This show's fucked up enough as it is.

704
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:32,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this show's gone down the toilet, and I mean that.

705
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:41,363
[SPEAKER_09]: If you think that's crazy, well, you know, the talk of the Xbox 360 dropping down to $2.99, that is crazy talk.

706
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:42,404
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pisser.

707
00:44:43,505 --> 00:44:44,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

708
00:44:44,466 --> 00:44:49,010
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, um, our analyst Michael Patcher has, um,

709
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:53,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much explain why this isn't going to happen.

710
00:44:54,316 --> 00:45:05,180
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason why is Microsoft Brass has informed the Xbox division that it must turn a profit or at least break even in the fiscal 2007 year, which ends in June 30th of next year.

711
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:16,305
[SPEAKER_09]: He explains that that means that the price cuts on the Xbox 360 will only come if the box costs less to produce, ship, and market than wholesale price.

712
00:45:16,985 --> 00:45:19,606
[SPEAKER_09]: But the best guess is the box currently costs around $4 to $5

713
00:45:20,066 --> 00:45:20,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

714
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:50,702
[SPEAKER_09]: The only reason they'll drop the price to $2.99 is say the PS3 comes out and they're like, Oh yeah, by the way, when we said it was going to come out for $4.99, actually $2.99 is the price that we're going to come out for it.

715
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:51,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Then they'll drop the price.

716
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:53,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Not going to happen.

717
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,046
[SPEAKER_09]: No, don't hold your breath.

718
00:45:57,286 --> 00:45:58,847
[SPEAKER_09]: There's better games coming out in the fall.

719
00:45:59,568 --> 00:46:03,250
[SPEAKER_09]: When all those games come out, then you can decide which system you want.

720
00:46:03,632 --> 00:46:09,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know who's actually thinking that they're going to be doing a lot of profit?

721
00:46:10,615 --> 00:46:11,515
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be Nintendo.

722
00:46:12,776 --> 00:46:16,817
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going Wii.

723
00:46:18,858 --> 00:46:26,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo has actually just put out their results for their quarter ending last month.

724
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:28,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going Wii in a bottle?

725
00:46:29,522 --> 00:46:30,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want anybody to go there.

726
00:46:31,023 --> 00:46:31,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I really didn't.

727
00:46:33,718 --> 00:46:38,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, DS is pulling in so much profit.

728
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:42,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they've sold 21 million DSs and 4.1 million DS lights.

729
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:48,636
[SPEAKER_03]: They've also sold more than 78 million games.

730
00:46:49,837 --> 00:46:59,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's basically projecting that from April of this year through March of next, they will sell another 17 million DSs and 75 million games.

731
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:03,848
[SPEAKER_03]: They were actually higher than their E3 predictions.

732
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they're still supporting Game Boy Advance.

733
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,994
[SPEAKER_03]: They're expecting to sell another 2.5 million Game Boy Advances.

734
00:47:12,194 --> 00:47:40,722
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 million games for the system now they basically have ditched the micro I own a micro I remember when seeing that at E3 I'm like wow that's the dumbest idea I've seen yet I actually like my micro because when I was really bored standing around in line I had my micro on my lanyard around my neck and I could pick it up whenever I got really bored and play me some Kingdom Hearts it was

735
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:43,547
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, I was playing Pocket Fighter.

736
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:45,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Pocket Fighter, Puzzle Fighter.

737
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:50,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is the interesting part.

738
00:47:50,532 --> 00:47:53,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's got some predictions about the Wii, as I had mentioned.

739
00:47:54,975 --> 00:48:00,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, for over the next five or six months, they're going to be selling the system.

740
00:48:00,618 --> 00:48:05,081
[SPEAKER_03]: They're expecting six million consoles and 17 million games.

741
00:48:06,782 --> 00:48:07,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Ambitious.

742
00:48:07,882 --> 00:48:08,523
[SPEAKER_02]: You think they can do it?

743
00:48:09,123 --> 00:48:09,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

744
00:48:09,704 --> 00:48:09,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Nintendo.

745
00:48:10,024 --> 00:48:10,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

746
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:18,254
[SPEAKER_02]: GameCube, Nintendo 64, GameCube was actually pretty good.

747
00:48:18,534 --> 00:48:20,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii vs. PS3.

748
00:48:20,956 --> 00:48:21,616
[SPEAKER_02]: No contest.

749
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:24,217
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, absolutely.

750
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:25,018
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

751
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:27,979
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sony fanboy in me still thinks Sony might be up to something.

752
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:28,659
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

753
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:29,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

754
00:48:30,526 --> 00:48:32,867
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think about anything we've talked about tonight?

755
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:33,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a call.

756
00:48:33,748 --> 00:48:34,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Skype line is open.

757
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:37,329
[SPEAKER_02]: It's www.orangeloungeradio.com.

760
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:47,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 916-226-9067.

761
00:48:47,934 --> 00:48:49,675
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always pick up the phone and do it that way.

762
00:48:50,015 --> 00:48:52,416
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking forward to your calls right now.

763
00:48:53,877 --> 00:48:54,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

764
00:48:54,857 --> 00:48:55,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

765
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:56,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me now?

766
00:48:56,598 --> 00:48:57,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I can hear you just fine.

767
00:48:57,799 --> 00:48:58,319
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

768
00:48:59,324 --> 00:49:01,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Ranma, from the East Coast, what's on your mind?

769
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:01,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, so...

770
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:29,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, E3 is like the thing that you go to, but yet you probably have to sell one of your kidneys just to get in, you know?

771
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

772
00:49:30,876 --> 00:49:33,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have to be honest, it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.

773
00:49:35,397 --> 00:49:38,698
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a legitimate reason for being there, it's really not hard to get in there.

774
00:49:40,419 --> 00:49:40,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

775
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:41,919
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know.

776
00:49:43,382 --> 00:49:44,683
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

777
00:50:12,495 --> 00:50:20,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like you got gaming in one section, talk about the latest technology in one, nothing but free demos and stuff to walk away with.

778
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:23,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus you have freaking cosplayers there having a great time.

779
00:50:28,874 --> 00:50:30,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a show that's open to the public?

780
00:50:31,037 --> 00:50:31,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

781
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:40,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the direction that a show like E3 or whatever hopes to become the next E3, is that a direction that they should be taking?

782
00:50:40,595 --> 00:50:42,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Is to be a public show, you think?

783
00:50:43,157 --> 00:50:44,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to think so.

784
00:50:44,398 --> 00:50:52,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the way they should have it up, like maybe the first day, important industry people only, then open to the public for everyone else.

785
00:50:53,165 --> 00:50:53,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

786
00:50:54,226 --> 00:50:54,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

787
00:50:55,047 --> 00:50:58,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you do E3 public, it's going to be a clusterfuck.

788
00:50:58,149 --> 00:50:59,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, think of how it is right now.

789
00:51:01,032 --> 00:51:01,972
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people are there?

790
00:51:02,232 --> 00:51:04,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine double that?

791
00:51:05,393 --> 00:51:06,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I can.

792
00:51:06,494 --> 00:51:07,894
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called New York Comic Con.

793
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:10,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

794
00:51:13,415 --> 00:51:18,757
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, LA is pretty big too, and it's a good place to have something like that.

795
00:51:18,797 --> 00:51:20,837
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how much bigger New York City could be.

796
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yes, it's New York City.

797
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:28,219
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no shortage of places to stay or anything like that, but I don't know.

798
00:51:28,749 --> 00:51:33,292
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, on the plus side, New York City is like this melt for all types of great stuff.

799
00:51:33,452 --> 00:51:43,057
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the downside, where the Jacob Javits Center is for digital life, it's like a 15-minute walk to the most local hotel unless you cross the river to Jersey.

800
00:51:43,618 --> 00:51:50,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for something like this, you'd have to bank on the fact that most people will be taking the bus and the subways to get to and fro.

801
00:51:52,383 --> 00:51:53,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, interesting.

802
00:51:53,603 --> 00:51:56,245
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually generates more revenue for the city.

803
00:51:57,468 --> 00:52:01,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I hope so, because then I'm hiking up the fares for another year.

804
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:04,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see something like that realistically happening in the next couple years?

805
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:05,953
[SPEAKER_02]: The show getting bigger and bigger?

806
00:52:06,754 --> 00:52:08,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I tend to think so, yeah.

807
00:52:08,275 --> 00:52:10,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, we'll see what happens.

808
00:52:10,696 --> 00:52:12,657
[SPEAKER_02]: If it gets big enough, we'll have to come out there, you know that.

809
00:52:13,398 --> 00:52:17,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I have to send you my list of all the cons I'm hitting up next year, so you three can come on out.

810
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:21,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, of course, with no E3 this year, that might mean I can make an East Coast con.

811
00:52:21,203 --> 00:52:25,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, that's what I'm thinking too, is like, hey, travel budget back, so maybe I can go somewhere.

812
00:52:26,475 --> 00:52:28,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Digital Life is something I've been wanting to do for a while.

813
00:52:30,576 --> 00:52:32,457
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a geek's paradise.

814
00:52:32,537 --> 00:52:41,699
[SPEAKER_05]: The first day I went, they had teams from local high schools having a contest of how fast they could build a computer from start to finish, including boot up to Windows.

815
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:45,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I just realized I'm going to be in New York City in October.

816
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:50,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't said anything about this on the show yet, but I'm planning on going to New York City in October, but it's the wrong weekend.

817
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't be there for Digital Life.

818
00:52:52,222 --> 00:52:53,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be towards the end of October.

819
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:54,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know for sure yet.

820
00:52:54,932 --> 00:53:00,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have more details later because I'll definitely go to the Nintendo store or something and meet fans if they want to come out.

821
00:53:00,698 --> 00:53:01,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be at Wicon.

822
00:53:02,901 --> 00:53:03,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be your security guard.

823
00:53:03,982 --> 00:53:08,847
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I shouldn't have said anything on the New York City thing.

824
00:53:08,867 --> 00:53:11,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's going to happen in October, but I'll say more about that later.

825
00:53:12,311 --> 00:53:14,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be at SkyCon New York City.

826
00:53:14,253 --> 00:53:14,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

827
00:53:15,114 --> 00:53:16,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to say?

828
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:42,045
[SPEAKER_02]: uh that's basically it and I'm loving the show because if you didn't notice I was feeling sick earlier but listening made me feel better so laughter heals everything thank you so much appreciate it no problem have a good one buddy later later oh you know what let's move E3 to YowieCon I like that idea oh that's a pretty boy Nikki hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this uh hi this is Eddie hi Eddie what's on your mind buddy

829
00:53:43,752 --> 00:53:47,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to comment on the E3 going public thing.

830
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:50,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistically, I really don't think that's going to happen.

831
00:53:51,859 --> 00:53:56,022
[SPEAKER_01]: E3 is there for industry people to get stuff done.

832
00:53:58,304 --> 00:54:05,851
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have one day that's open to the industry and the rest is open to the public, I don't think there's enough time for people to get things done.

833
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:10,915
[SPEAKER_01]: If they open it to both the industry and the public at the same time,

834
00:54:11,533 --> 00:54:17,898
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry people doesn't want to be tripping over, you know, all these fanboys who are there to see, you know, the latest game.

835
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:18,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

836
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:21,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would your suggestion be for the independents?

837
00:54:21,101 --> 00:54:22,542
[SPEAKER_02]: What do the Kenshiya folks do now?

838
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:32,571
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think the IndieCon is a pretty good idea, but I still don't think it should be open to the public.

839
00:54:32,631 --> 00:54:39,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should still be, you know, an industry-only thing where, you know, like,

840
00:54:40,672 --> 00:54:41,132
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

841
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:48,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

842
00:54:49,936 --> 00:54:50,536
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not really.

843
00:54:50,716 --> 00:54:50,936
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

844
00:54:50,956 --> 00:54:51,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for your thoughts.

845
00:54:52,437 --> 00:54:52,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

846
00:54:52,897 --> 00:54:53,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the show.

847
00:54:54,618 --> 00:54:55,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem.

848
00:54:55,398 --> 00:54:58,279
[SPEAKER_02]: We like doing it because fine folks like yourself call us every week.

849
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,220
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

850
00:54:59,400 --> 00:54:59,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, buddy.

851
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:00,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

852
00:55:01,781 --> 00:55:02,521
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do one more call.

853
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,102
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

854
00:55:05,382 --> 00:55:06,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

855
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:06,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

856
00:55:07,276 --> 00:55:09,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Raven Stoffen again, sorry about that.

857
00:55:09,258 --> 00:55:10,579
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright, much better connection.

858
00:55:10,699 --> 00:55:11,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn Torn's off this time?

859
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:12,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

860
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:13,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better.

861
00:55:13,541 --> 00:55:14,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Pornotube's off?

862
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:17,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Pornotube's off.

863
00:55:17,765 --> 00:55:19,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's try this again.

864
00:55:19,346 --> 00:55:20,287
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you want to call in about?

865
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:26,892
[SPEAKER_06]: E3, and like you said, I don't think it's going to be cancelled.

866
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be downsized.

867
00:55:29,294 --> 00:55:31,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, we never said cancelled.

868
00:55:31,436 --> 00:55:32,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, yeah, we did.

869
00:55:32,637 --> 00:55:35,079
[SPEAKER_02]: We said cancelled as we know it.

870
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:41,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no doubt the ESA is going to do something, but the question is, is that something going to be good enough?

871
00:55:41,656 --> 00:55:42,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I ask you.

872
00:55:42,677 --> 00:55:44,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something going to be good enough?

873
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:45,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

874
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, I don't know.

875
00:55:48,242 --> 00:55:50,304
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be bad news for Nintendo and Sony.

876
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:55,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't they have like these flashy plaz ads and everything to go all out for this thing?

877
00:55:56,405 --> 00:56:01,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but what's to stop Nintendo from doing a... Well, hell, they're doing their Fusion Tour.

878
00:56:02,127 --> 00:56:03,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they can take that stuff on the road.

879
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:10,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And rumor is there was something going around on Kotaku or something saying that they were going to be doing a special tour.

880
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:12,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was the Fusion Tour or something separate.

881
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:14,212
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were going to take their show on the road.

882
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:17,693
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing to stop Sony from doing something similar, having a huge event in LA.

883
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:19,974
[SPEAKER_02]: All these guys could still do press conferences.

884
00:56:20,274 --> 00:56:23,415
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be weird because E3 kind of brought it all together.

885
00:56:24,235 --> 00:56:29,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're going to have, I think at least in 2007, you're just going to have a clusterfuck of all these random events.

886
00:56:30,316 --> 00:56:31,357
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be really weird.

887
00:56:32,157 --> 00:56:35,198
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be funny, all this clusterfuck of all these things.

888
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:37,618
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be an interesting time in 2007.

889
00:56:39,298 --> 00:56:46,020
[SPEAKER_02]: True, but for us little guys who don't really have a travel budget, who like to bring the news to you guys, we're screwed.

890
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:48,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe not so much us.

891
00:56:48,278 --> 00:56:50,499
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fortunate enough to be in the Bay Area-ish.

892
00:56:50,899 --> 00:56:55,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Bay Area is a 90-minute drive, so realistically we can get to most events over there pretty easy.

893
00:56:55,622 --> 00:57:01,205
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I feel sorry for a lot of other folks who don't have that same luxury of being able to drive.

894
00:57:01,445 --> 00:57:02,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And not every company is in the Bay Area.

895
00:57:02,946 --> 00:57:07,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are in L.A., which is a little harder to get to, and some are in, you know what, Canada, other countries.

896
00:57:07,868 --> 00:57:12,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, one of the nicest people we talked to at E3 this year were those folks from Spain that were developing the...

897
00:57:13,766 --> 00:57:14,026
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

898
00:57:14,046 --> 00:57:15,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like American Pie meets Grand Theft Auto.

899
00:57:15,787 --> 00:57:16,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the name of the game now.

900
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:18,069
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it called?

901
00:57:18,629 --> 00:57:19,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer something.

902
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer Heat or something?

903
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was funny because it had a guy stealing panties on the cover.

904
00:57:25,353 --> 00:57:25,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny.

905
00:57:25,934 --> 00:57:28,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners, Raven Stolfen?

906
00:57:29,456 --> 00:57:31,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you left this out of your note.

907
00:57:31,857 --> 00:57:34,779
[SPEAKER_06]: PSP got a firmware update.

908
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:34,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 2.8.

909
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:36,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we talked about that last week.

910
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go listen to last week's show, buddy.

911
00:57:39,742 --> 00:57:40,362
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out.

912
00:57:40,763 --> 00:57:41,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

913
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:45,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, we didn't have it on the show roll tonight because we already talked about that it was coming out.

914
00:57:46,777 --> 00:57:47,237
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

915
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:47,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you download it?

916
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:49,959
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the PSP.

917
00:57:49,979 --> 00:57:51,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to put it in.

918
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really have a chance to test it out yet.

919
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:57,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, call us back next week after you've tested it out because I haven't upgraded mine yet.

920
00:57:57,264 --> 00:57:57,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little lazy.

921
00:57:58,965 --> 00:57:59,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one more thing.

922
00:57:59,966 --> 00:58:00,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

923
00:58:01,006 --> 00:58:02,947
[SPEAKER_06]: About the PSP and the DS Lite sales.

924
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:03,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it.

925
00:58:03,488 --> 00:58:03,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

926
00:58:04,873 --> 00:58:12,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is my opinion why the DS is doing better, because it's targeted to little kids and people that like things.

927
00:58:12,817 --> 00:58:14,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo's a little kid company.

928
00:58:14,218 --> 00:58:15,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not being mean.

929
00:58:15,118 --> 00:58:16,019
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they say.

930
00:58:16,899 --> 00:58:17,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

931
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a family-friendly company.

932
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:24,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a family-friendly company, and when people see it, they go, oh, friendly.

933
00:58:24,623 --> 00:58:28,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But Sony has family-friendly stuff on it, too.

934
00:58:29,164 --> 00:58:33,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, but Sony's looking for that luxury liner.

935
00:58:33,947 --> 00:58:35,227
[SPEAKER_06]: They want you to get your money.

936
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:37,148
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing is not cheap either.

937
00:58:39,049 --> 00:58:39,350
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

938
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:40,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for sharing your thoughts.

939
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:41,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

940
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about the bad quality the first time.

941
00:58:43,632 --> 00:58:44,412
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

942
00:58:44,832 --> 00:58:46,533
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be edited out like it was never there.

943
00:58:47,114 --> 00:58:47,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

944
00:58:47,814 --> 00:58:49,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Our podcast listeners are going to go, what are they talking about?

945
00:58:50,436 --> 00:58:51,516
[SPEAKER_02]: That first call's not even there.

946
00:58:51,556 --> 00:58:52,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

947
00:58:52,577 --> 00:58:52,877
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

948
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:53,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

949
00:58:54,728 --> 00:58:58,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want our podcast folks to know we really don't edit a lot on the show.

950
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:58,750
[SPEAKER_02]: We really don't.

951
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:00,151
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to keep things pure here.

952
00:59:00,171 --> 00:59:04,773
[SPEAKER_02]: The only things we really edit out, dead air and bad Skype calls, and there's a really bad connection.

953
00:59:04,914 --> 00:59:06,294
[SPEAKER_02]: So just wanted you guys to know that.

954
00:59:06,354 --> 00:59:07,235
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, one more call.

955
00:59:07,755 --> 00:59:09,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another New Yorker, so this should be fun.

956
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:11,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

957
00:59:11,317 --> 00:59:11,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

958
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:14,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one and only Legend of Zaku.

959
00:59:14,308 --> 00:59:15,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, another New Yorker on the line.

960
00:59:15,949 --> 00:59:16,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me guess.

961
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Digital Life?

962
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:17,911
[SPEAKER_02]: New E3?

963
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:19,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, of course.

964
00:59:20,592 --> 00:59:23,514
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the same thing as Ranma said.

965
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:25,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, then what are your thoughts on this?

966
00:59:25,115 --> 00:59:28,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is Digital Life to be the new E3 besides the fact it's in your backyard?

967
00:59:28,518 --> 00:59:33,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you're breaking down E3 and spreading it across the country.

968
00:59:33,121 --> 00:59:34,962
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much what is going to happen next year.

969
00:59:36,551 --> 00:59:37,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to restate this.

970
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:40,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to second the statements I already said.

971
00:59:40,754 --> 00:59:41,494
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a clusterfuck.

972
00:59:41,594 --> 01:00:01,825
[SPEAKER_07]: What will happen is that the elements that made E3 really successful in the earlier days, in the first few ones, like allowing the public to go in, is basically going to help the other smaller shows, which are going to steal E3's lightning like that.

973
01:00:02,817 --> 01:00:19,369
[SPEAKER_07]: and E3 on the other hand well now you know it's a wake-up call for them it's a wake-up call for the industry for the you know for the fact that this show went out it was just flooded with hype too much fat when basically the whole purpose of E3 was to focus on you know the hardcore content.

974
01:00:19,509 --> 01:00:21,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Zaku when was the public ever allowed in E3?

975
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:24,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in the earlier days according to the Wikipedia.

976
01:00:26,681 --> 01:00:32,366
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't really that the public was allowed, but my understanding is it was pretty easy to get in.

977
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:34,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's basically what I'm saying.

978
01:00:35,008 --> 01:00:35,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me restate that.

979
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:36,930
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot easier to get in.

980
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:37,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fine, whatever.

981
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:44,055
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, by adding the element of having the public involved, then you build up hype.

982
01:00:44,095 --> 01:00:46,177
[SPEAKER_07]: You bring the hype to the people directly.

983
01:00:46,397 --> 01:00:52,943
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, one of the dangers about that is that people are going to play these demos at E3 and then go, well, that game sucks.

984
01:00:53,886 --> 01:00:54,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

985
01:00:54,326 --> 01:00:55,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it wasn't really half finished.

986
01:00:55,607 --> 01:00:58,609
[SPEAKER_07]: And the problem is that it's just too many people that aren't supposed to be there.

987
01:00:59,209 --> 01:01:04,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's one of the risks associated with letting, you know, opening a show of that magnitude to the public.

988
01:01:04,672 --> 01:01:05,613
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be too crowded.

989
01:01:06,073 --> 01:01:07,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear from some developers.

990
01:01:07,313 --> 01:01:12,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for tomorrow, Monday, because I'm excited to hear from some developers about what their plans are.

991
01:01:12,356 --> 01:01:12,977
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

992
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:15,559
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hope I have enough frequent flyer miles.

993
01:01:29,057 --> 01:01:30,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.

994
01:01:30,177 --> 01:01:35,999
[SPEAKER_07]: If anything, you could just outsource your reporting to other people online.

995
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:44,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we've always said we would love to get reports from other people that can go to shows like this when we can't, but nobody does it.

996
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but this would be a good call to reiterate that.

997
01:01:50,264 --> 01:01:51,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Consider it reiterated.

998
01:01:52,524 --> 01:01:56,085
[SPEAKER_02]: You can email myself personally, or you'll mail the mailbag.

999
01:01:56,365 --> 01:01:57,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, email Loki.

1000
01:01:58,326 --> 01:01:59,668
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll say, sure, go for it.

1001
01:01:59,748 --> 01:02:01,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, email me.

1002
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,192
[SPEAKER_02]: But you do the mailbag, so I kind of already said that.

1003
01:02:04,212 --> 01:02:04,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, email me anyway.

1004
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:06,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, email 23rd Magus.

1005
01:02:06,314 --> 01:02:07,435
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll make sure we find out.

1006
01:02:08,276 --> 01:02:09,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like I get any other email anyway.

1007
01:02:09,778 --> 01:02:12,841
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the best way to do it, by just spreading out, having a network.

1008
01:02:14,722 --> 01:02:35,087
[SPEAKER_02]: and so basically it'll come down to that it'll be spread out when you're covering these shows follow the OL Army principle of don't be a dick and remember you don't represent Orange Lounge Radio I just want to let the listeners know that but if you want to send us fan stuff out there that you taped for us as a gift to us, go for it

1009
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:36,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

1010
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,320
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to get fan stuff in here.

1011
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,221
[SPEAKER_07]: You can count all these other guys as contributors.

1012
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:41,642
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically what we'll become anyways.

1013
01:02:41,662 --> 01:02:43,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it works for me.

1014
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:44,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing but good contributors.

1015
01:02:44,642 --> 01:02:48,404
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Zaku, then go to Digital Life with your camcorder and send us some stuff back, all right?

1016
01:02:48,944 --> 01:02:51,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you something from there like I did last year.

1017
01:02:51,524 --> 01:02:52,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right, our poster.

1018
01:02:53,205 --> 01:02:54,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember from Digital Life last year.

1019
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:57,306
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, it's hanging up right here, right over Jamie's head.

1020
01:02:58,401 --> 01:03:00,702
[SPEAKER_03]: In all of its illustrator glory.

1021
01:03:00,742 --> 01:03:04,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Hanging right next to the Jay and Silent Bob, all you motherfuckers are going to pay.

1022
01:03:04,103 --> 01:03:05,764
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the one who's going to wear the Bollickers poster.

1023
01:03:05,784 --> 01:03:08,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Zaku, have a good one.

1024
01:03:08,745 --> 01:03:09,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you too.

1025
01:03:09,505 --> 01:03:09,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1026
01:03:16,048 --> 01:03:18,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was an animated Skype line tonight.

1027
01:03:18,989 --> 01:03:20,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Half the calls were from New York City.

1028
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:22,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I love New York City.

1029
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:23,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem in New York City.

1030
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:25,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to going there very soon.

1031
01:03:25,271 --> 01:03:26,291
[SPEAKER_02]: New York City!

1032
01:03:26,952 --> 01:03:27,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody get a rope.

1033
01:03:28,844 --> 01:03:32,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been to New York since I was in high school.

1034
01:03:32,445 --> 01:03:33,245
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fun place.

1035
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:34,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I played at Carnegie Hall.

1036
01:03:34,546 --> 01:03:36,166
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always stuff to do in New York City.

1037
01:03:36,266 --> 01:03:36,666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

1038
01:03:37,626 --> 01:03:40,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Any last minute stories before we get into the final story of the night?

1039
01:03:44,428 --> 01:03:45,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

1040
01:03:45,148 --> 01:03:46,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I guess we go to the final story of the night.

1041
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:49,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I did have one.

1042
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:49,750
[SPEAKER_09]: You lie!

1043
01:03:51,986 --> 01:03:53,266
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was not lying.

1044
01:03:53,627 --> 01:03:55,267
[SPEAKER_09]: It's impossible!

1045
01:03:55,547 --> 01:04:01,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to mention there's a demo out there now if you have upgraded your PSP the firmware 2.8 for Mercury Meltdown.

1046
01:04:02,449 --> 01:04:03,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can check that out for free.

1047
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:08,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I thought that was kind of neat.

1048
01:04:09,572 --> 01:04:12,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a reason I would go and upgrade mine to 2.8.

1049
01:04:12,593 --> 01:04:13,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I should because...

1050
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:16,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I have nothing better to do with it.

1051
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:18,851
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, check it out.

1052
01:04:19,451 --> 01:04:22,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, no, that's it.

1053
01:04:24,613 --> 01:04:26,333
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, then let's go to our last story of the evening.

1054
01:04:26,853 --> 01:04:35,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about what's wrong with this world and why Brazil just couldn't win the World Cup.

1055
01:04:35,796 --> 01:04:38,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the reason why they couldn't win the World Cup?

1056
01:04:40,137 --> 01:04:41,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Sex and PlayStation 2.

1057
01:04:42,998 --> 01:04:43,699
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1058
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:45,099
[SPEAKER_09]: At least that's what they're blaming.

1059
01:04:45,532 --> 01:04:47,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought that was kind of funny.

1060
01:04:49,793 --> 01:04:50,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Anywho.

1061
01:04:52,955 --> 01:05:09,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so apparently the reason why there are lead footballers out there getting too sexed up, which is apparently, I guess, against their rules during the World Cup, and playing too much FIFA 06 on PlayStation 2.

1062
01:05:11,621 --> 01:05:14,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Good at the game, but not good at the actual game.

1063
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:45,116
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of sucks for him alright then I think it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night DarkSakura, you got a mic in your hand why don't you start us off two reject false icons and I like beer Loki, your final thought my final thought is the king of all cosmos for some reason is the number five top gayest video game characters out there what's number one?

1064
01:05:50,740 --> 01:06:10,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Espatuse for the first time this week Brazilian grill for those that don't know what kind of food that is It's just big hunks of meat getting thrown on your plate Magus, your final thought, thanks for being here tonight Pie, Pete to the moon
