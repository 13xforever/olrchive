1
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:28,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, July 23rd, 2006, details on PSP updates from Comic-Con, World of Warcraft undergoes controversial changes in its expansion, and brace yourselves for Animal Crossing the Movie.

2
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they're controversial, Andrew.

3
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:35,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Mobile

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,621
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

5
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:27,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki is also here, our tech master Loki That was a horrible joke I know How you doing?

6
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:36,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing okay And also our very special guest, or spatial guest taking up space Say hello to Andrew Loktar, bitches How you doing?

7
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:49,138
[SPEAKER_11]: For the Horde We're here to talk about video game news that doesn't suck Sometimes we talk about sucky news This is actually a little bit of a slow news week So we might have some news of suck tonight I don't know, we'll see

8
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:50,248
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

9
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:12,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the same ones you own?

10
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:13,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the same ones I own.

11
00:02:13,256 --> 00:02:18,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a lot of Last Action Hero today, except it's really hot in the garage and I wanted to die.

12
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,922
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went back in and tried not to become a corpse since I had to do the show today.

13
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:23,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

14
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:24,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played with Legos last night.

15
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:25,944
[SPEAKER_11]: But you baked cookies.

16
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:26,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I baked cookies.

17
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:29,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Amongst your boredom, so that's great.

18
00:02:29,206 --> 00:02:31,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, and my cookies are made of awesome and win.

19
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:34,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And chocolate.

20
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,612
[SPEAKER_11]: You could almost make a sequel to the Milkshake song out of that.

21
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,813
[SPEAKER_11]: My cookies are made of awesome and win, man.

22
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played any Blades of the Angels this week, jackass.

23
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow!

24
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:14,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow!

25
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you finally get rid of it?

26
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:16,761
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not yet.

27
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:18,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have to finish it, even though it sucks.

28
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:30,246
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I played more Grand Theft Auto, because that's awesome, and actually I'm going to be cleaning out some of my games here pretty soon, so I do need to finish Blades of the Angels, because that's got to go back.

29
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:34,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'm selling back Katamari, me and my Katamari.

30
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:34,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Just

31
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:35,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm bored of that game.

32
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:37,355
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's so cute and fun!

33
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:39,015
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so cute, but who cares?

34
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:40,595
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't care.

35
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:45,016
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, other than that, what else did I play?

36
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:53,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I played a little bit more Ridge Racer and... Oh, I watched Nelly play Cloning Clyde.

37
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:55,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I play more Frogger, too.

38
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:56,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlock that TV.

39
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:57,567
[SPEAKER_02]: What's cloning client all about?

40
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I didn't have time to really download it and check it out.

41
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:01,668
[SPEAKER_11]: You've been watching her play and you have no idea what's going on.

42
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:05,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I've been watching her play it from the couch while I'm watching TV.

43
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:09,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like it's basically solving puzzles.

44
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,171
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to kill all these robots in the level before you're allowed to exit.

45
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have 20 different levels or so.

46
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:22,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And you basically can clone yourself as well as be able to transform into different things.

47
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:24,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus it has exploding chickens that you get to kick.

48
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:26,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that's really fun.

49
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I always wanted to play a game where I can kick chickens, that's great.

50
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:35,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, but, um, you know, it's nice to see that they're actually putting out some new, um, live arcade games.

51
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:44,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I don't know, um, I was trying to get a hold of the Saints Row demo, but I haven't made it over to, like, a GameStop or something to pre-order the game yet.

52
00:04:45,107 --> 00:04:51,632
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently it did pop up on the German server for a little bit, and some people were able to nab it before it

53
00:04:52,452 --> 00:05:00,838
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my instant message buddies said he got a copy of the September magazine, original Xbox, whatever it's called, magazine, and it's in there.

54
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:04,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know it was out yet, but I'll pick that one up instead then.

55
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:05,242
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

56
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:08,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio, helping you find what you need.

57
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:09,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

58
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:10,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else?

59
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:12,847
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it, I think.

60
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:14,628
[SPEAKER_11]: GameTap Service Rehab

61
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:34,613
[SPEAKER_11]: GameTap Upgraded

62
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:04,205
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of the games they picked are really random.

63
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:11,911
[SPEAKER_11]: You can kind of tell that they're sort of testing this right now because a lot of the games are not two-player simultaneous games.

64
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:16,655
[SPEAKER_11]: They're games like Pac-Man, which is one of the most popular multiplayer games on there right now, is Pac-Man.

65
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:20,638
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and the way multiplayer Pac-Man works is like I play, then you play, then I play.

66
00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:21,579
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it kind of trades off.

67
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,405
[SPEAKER_11]: But they do have some same-time multiplayer games on there right now, like Joust.

68
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:42,086
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's pretty exciting because that means that, you know, this is probably the first step in the direction of Street Fighter 2, other popular two-player arcade games, you know, in the future.

69
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:46,147
[SPEAKER_11]: My only complaint about the whole thing is that it was a really weird setup.

70
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:53,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it took a minute for me to figure out, okay, what's the difference between being an orange name and clicking on instant match and being, you know...

71
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:55,643
[SPEAKER_11]: GameTap has that technology and is likely to move forward.

72
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:23,893
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

73
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:44,426
[SPEAKER_11]: GameTap needed something like that to justify why you should pay for it

74
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

75
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:24,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that's not a bad sign.

76
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:28,100
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope their business is doing well, but I think things like this will help.

77
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,624
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think if they ever are able to get it working on Macs, that's going to be a huge help, too.

78
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:33,765
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be a huge, huge help.

79
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:36,548
[SPEAKER_11]: So, anyway, that was pretty much my gaming week.

80
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:41,873
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do, you know, I've talked a lot of positive things about it, but I really do recommend it, and I enjoy it.

81
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:42,553
[SPEAKER_11]: What, Loki?

82
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:48,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like, because if they got that working on Macs, that would, you know, multiply the amount of games that Mac can play by, like, 100.

83
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:50,489
[SPEAKER_11]: It would.

84
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:51,410
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually would.

85
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,650
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be pretty cool.

86
00:08:54,071 --> 00:09:05,416
[SPEAKER_11]: No, seriously though, you know, you give Macs a hard time, but okay, obviously one of the things that people always say is you can't really play as many games on a Mac, so having GameTap would be a pretty cool little upgrade, so it really would.

87
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:06,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Andrew, how was your gaming week?

88
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:08,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Not bad.

89
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:15,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I was getting in some World of Warcraft on the test servers, testing out the new Rogue Talent Review.

90
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty impressed by that.

91
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:18,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

92
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Also took the time to finish up Tales of Legendia, an English program.

93
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:29,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Still pissed off that they never took the time to do voice acting for the second half of the game.

94
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Good game there, Namco.

95
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:35,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Also starting to get into Wild Arms 3, which is a pretty decent RPG.

96
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:36,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Recommended.

97
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:39,606
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about all that I've done this week.

98
00:09:42,305 --> 00:10:05,634
[SPEAKER_11]: We have some folks in our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat talking about the whole GameTap thing, talking about it there Some love there for Joust, two player simultaneous there from VXJasonXV Yuri Lover wants to know when GameTap's going to get multiplayer Ridge Racer Something tells me that, well they do have other Kill it with fire They do have, I know that joke is kind of like really old now

99
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:09,878
[SPEAKER_11]: They do have other Namco games on there, but I don't know if that would really work.

100
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:13,019
[SPEAKER_11]: PlayStation's not one of the systems they emulate right now.

101
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,100
[SPEAKER_11]: They have Dreamcasts.

102
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,540
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

103
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,682
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're emulating Dreamcasts, why not emulate Soul Calibur?

104
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:19,983
[SPEAKER_11]: My God, would that not be... There we go.

105
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:23,684
[SPEAKER_11]: My God, do you know how many freaking GameTap subscriptions that would sell right there?

106
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:25,045
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know.

107
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's just too much of a pain in the ass.

108
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:27,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

109
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, I'm hoping it's the start of something good.

110
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:32,288
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they're talking a little bit about...

111
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:35,265
[SPEAKER_11]: versus GameTap.

112
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:43,072
[SPEAKER_11]: VidPower says, so GameTap is like Xbox Live Arcade now, but then RSF says GameTap and Xbox Live Arcade are different business models, which is true.

113
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:54,143
[SPEAKER_11]: GameTap doesn't have achievements either, and it doesn't have voice chat, but at the same time, you pay one flat fee for access to 500 some odd games, whereas...

114
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Xbox Live Arcade, you're paying $5, $10 a game.

115
00:10:57,578 --> 00:10:58,778
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just a different business model.

116
00:10:58,798 --> 00:10:59,698
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends whatever you like.

117
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:07,801
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's probably the direction GameTab is going in, but that's not really a big surprise because, you know, Xbox Live is successful.

118
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:09,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Who wouldn't want a little piece of that business?

119
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:10,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

120
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:12,482
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

121
00:11:12,502 --> 00:11:15,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Jada2006 agrees that Soul Calibur would be awesome.

122
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:16,783
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go.

123
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:18,023
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

124
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,784
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go and get into some news now, some gaming news.

125
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:23,925
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

126
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:29,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and what a perfect way to start us off by talking about the PSP and how there's going to be yet another firmware upgrade.

127
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:32,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one's going to be 2.8.

128
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:47,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to add video RSS feeds, so you can download those wonderful video podcasts out there, as well as a bunch of other fun stuff, probably security things to prevent you from running homebrew and all that wonderful stuff up.

129
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:53,239
[SPEAKER_02]: This was also coming from Comic Con 2006, which they're kind of displaying some of the stuff right now.

130
00:11:53,499 --> 00:12:07,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the other things that are actually happening, they were showing off some of their brand new Sony Kinect stuff where they're going to try to get it where you can download movies to your PSP's memory stick there.

131
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:10,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing as they won't be selling UMDs much longer, it makes sense.

132
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:12,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, they were saying that there's 350 UMD...

133
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:20,748
[SPEAKER_11]: I think downloadable movies is a smart move right now.

134
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,008
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to do it.

135
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:22,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

136
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:27,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I will use it that much, but you never know.

137
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:31,452
[SPEAKER_11]: I travel a lot, as you guys have been listening to this show a while now.

138
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:35,673
[SPEAKER_11]: It might be kind of tempting to download a movie before I go on the plane next time.

139
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:40,475
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the other things that's coming with that firmware update as well

140
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,012
[SPEAKER_02]: is there going to be including a demo of World Tour Soccer 2?

141
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:49,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if you're excited about that.

142
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:54,517
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes the grand total of demos that they've put out so far to a whopping two or three.

143
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:57,098
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty pathetic.

144
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:02,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think you would want to put tons of demos out there so that they buy your games.

145
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:06,503
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think Sony's making a bit of a mistake with that, but I don't know.

146
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:06,963
[SPEAKER_11]: You look at Xbox 360...

147
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Marketplace, and so, so many demos.

148
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Some good news, though.

149
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Video ad is something that they're working on right now.

150
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:23,592
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing they aren't working on, though, is improving the text entry system on there and no plans for a first-party keyboard.

151
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:26,576
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, that sucks.

152
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:28,766
[SPEAKER_11]: So all this was announced at Comic-Con, right?

153
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:29,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

154
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,327
[SPEAKER_11]: So what was Sony doing there?

155
00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:34,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Comic-Con's become almost like... It's become like Nerd-Con, hasn't it?

156
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:35,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

157
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:42,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It's less of comics and more of, here's what's coming out movies, here's what's coming out comics, here's what's coming out toys, games.

158
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:45,515
[SPEAKER_11]: But in a way, doesn't comics kind of tie into all that?

159
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:47,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, comics ties into movies.

160
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:52,479
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the big, grossing movies lately have been comic book-based, like Batman Begins was an awesome movie.

161
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:53,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

162
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,660
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, same thing with games.

163
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,902
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of games based off comic book franchises as well, usually because of the movies, but, you know.

164
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:02,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, exactly, but it's just, it's become a huge nerd fest, so.

165
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:03,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, that's kind of neat.

166
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:06,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's funny, because I was telling my friend the other day, I want to go to Comic Con.

167
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,085
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, why?

168
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:08,066
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't read comic books.

169
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:11,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, well, but there's cool stuff.

170
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:13,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

171
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:16,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's something to look forward to.

172
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,451
[SPEAKER_02]: However, though, just, you know, for people that aren't in the know,

173
00:14:20,222 --> 00:14:20,863
[SPEAKER_02]: DevHook

174
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is out right now.

175
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:41,339
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on version 0.45.

176
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:52,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that you can actually fully emulate the 2.71 firmware and basically run it with all the functionality of 2.71 as well as homebrew stuff.

177
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're also using this to load on custom firmwares as well.

178
00:14:56,828 --> 00:15:00,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And that on top of the mod chip that's coming out for it.

179
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how much longer are these firmware updates really going to be a problem?

180
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:06,894
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something interesting.

181
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,080
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

182
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be interested in the new upgrades, especially for the movie thing.

183
00:15:12,802 --> 00:15:18,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I might have to buy one movie online just to see what it's like, just to review it for you guys here on Orange Launch Radio.

184
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:18,505
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

185
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:31,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if I remember correctly, if I read correctly on this, at least this is the case with those, how we talked about last week, how they're including a one gigabyte memory stick and you have four movies that you can download to that.

186
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:35,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the movies aren't full screen, which is really lame.

187
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:39,768
[SPEAKER_02]: They're that 320 by whatever on the PSP.

188
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:40,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Normal TV ratio.

189
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:41,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

190
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:42,708
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a little bit of a bummer.

191
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:43,369
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really lame.

192
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:44,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Not cool.

193
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:45,289
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

194
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:51,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, speaking of movies, of course, last week on the show we talked about how Target had gotten rid of UMDs from their shelves.

195
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:53,051
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in the process of phasing that out.

196
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:59,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, recently, United Press International spoke to the Senior VP of Marketing at Sony Computer Entertainment.

197
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:04,399
[SPEAKER_11]: His name is Peter Dial, and this is what he said, basically, about all this negative press.

198
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,284
[SPEAKER_11]: It basically comes down to too many releases.

199
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:08,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a quote.

200
00:16:08,874 --> 00:16:16,661
[SPEAKER_11]: We have seen studios cut back on releasing their full content on UMD, as unlike the DVD market, the PSP consumer is targeted.

201
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:25,289
[SPEAKER_11]: We are committed to helping the studios better understand our product and our consumer, and will continue to educate them as we evolve and enhance the functionality of the PSP.

202
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:34,417
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically it just kind of sounds like they're not saying they're done yet, but I don't know.

203
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:44,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I also think it comes down to a space issue too because those UMDs can't hold a whole lot and to fit more content on top of that, it's tough.

204
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:46,182
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just you can't really fit it.

205
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:52,505
[SPEAKER_02]: That and also they're not making a lot of money on UMDs, so why bother putting exclusive content on there in the first place?

206
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:53,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Why even bother?

207
00:16:54,225 --> 00:17:03,709
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting though that the guy referenced the whole fact that the PSP is a targeted market because we were kind of saying that when the PSP first came out and you saw the list of the launch movies that

208
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,110
[SPEAKER_11]: that were coming out for the PSP.

209
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:12,376
[SPEAKER_11]: It was kind of like, wow, you have a lot of very teenage boy movies coming on PSP, but that, I guess, is the target market.

210
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:17,761
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not exactly going to sell a bunch of UMDs of Steel Magnolias on PSP.

211
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:19,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I would totally buy that movie.

212
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:20,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Me too, but we'd be the only two.

213
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:22,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I wouldn't buy that movie.

214
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, then I'd be the only one.

215
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:25,548
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be the only one.

216
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to say I owned it.

217
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:30,632
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually not really that huge on that movie, but just to say I own it.

218
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:31,613
[SPEAKER_11]: I was excited about it.

219
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:32,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Death Race 2000

220
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:53,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Death Race 3000

221
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:16,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Snakes on a Plane

222
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:39,602
[SPEAKER_11]: For UMD, I guess.

223
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Campaigning to get that released on UMD.

224
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:43,865
[SPEAKER_11]: So you could actually watch it in a plane.

225
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you know they're not going to show that as the in-flight movie.

226
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:47,608
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be funny, though.

227
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,369
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be actually pretty funny.

228
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:51,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I would fly on an airline that showed that as the in-flight movie.

229
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:53,132
[SPEAKER_11]: What about movies like Red Eye?

230
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:54,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet Southwest would do something like that.

231
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:59,798
[SPEAKER_11]: because they're just sort of... Southwest is too poor to show movies.

232
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:03,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but if they did show a movie... Fly the ghetto skies.

233
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:16,263
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, if they did show a movie, I bet that'd be one that they would put up right away because they have some snarky people doing their little... Okay, if the plane starts to go down, this probably won't matter because I'll be dead anyway.

234
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I said that on one of my flights.

235
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember who is putting out snakes on a plane, but...

236
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine with the motion picture?

237
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:27,836
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how they always create a stupid themed ride based on it?

238
00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:30,778
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have the snakes on a plain roller coaster at some point.

239
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:32,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awful.

240
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on back to games.

241
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, who needs them?

242
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:39,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, we do.

243
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:41,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'd miss my games too much.

244
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I love games very much.

245
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:48,185
[SPEAKER_05]: But at any rate, speaking of a game that I've been stuck on for a little bit,

246
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:50,329
[SPEAKER_05]: World of Warcraft.

247
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:57,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know how you've got Shamans for Horde and Paladins on Alliance?

248
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:01,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now they're going to be... And nothing will ever change to upset that balance of the force, right?

249
00:20:02,513 --> 00:20:03,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullshit!

250
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:04,874
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

251
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:11,596
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually are now having Alliance Shamans and Horde Paladins.

252
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,858
[SPEAKER_05]: The new races are going to be pulling them in with the whole...

253
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Upgrade for Burning Crusade.

254
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:20,603
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be Blood Off Paladins.

255
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:24,106
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be... I know I'm going to mispronounce... Draenei.

256
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:25,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Draeno.

257
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:26,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Draeno.

258
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:27,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Draeno.

259
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Their faces look like something you'd want to use Draeno on, actually.

260
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,514
[SPEAKER_11]: They use the power of unclogging.

261
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:38,117
[SPEAKER_11]: You know why those particular races were picked, right?

262
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:40,219
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know Andrew's going to have to comment on this.

263
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,040
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the biggest wow-horn in the room.

264
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just get this out.

265
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:42,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

266
00:20:43,562 --> 00:20:43,662
[SPEAKER_11]: You...

267
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:48,406
[SPEAKER_11]: You had to have blood elves on the Horde side because the Horde needed a pretty character.

268
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Because everybody on the Horde side is ugly.

269
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the zombies are pretty.

270
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,816
[SPEAKER_11]: You needed the Drani people on the Alliance side because the Alliance needed uglies.

271
00:20:58,596 --> 00:20:59,657
[SPEAKER_04]: The Alliance already has uglies.

272
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:01,239
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand, but you know, it's just...

273
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:08,964
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what the fish-faced Dranae remind me of?

274
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:14,649
[SPEAKER_02]: That Kikoman music video thing where they've got the fish-faced creature.

275
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,431
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it reminds me of.

276
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, did you have more story?

277
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:19,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

278
00:21:20,935 --> 00:21:32,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but if you want to know some of the word behind that, there's actually a post on the World of Warcraft forums where they're giving the background to the decision for doing all that.

279
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:35,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently there's a forum shitstorm about it.

280
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:39,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Just talking about how A, it butchers balance.

281
00:21:39,518 --> 00:21:40,899
[SPEAKER_07]: A, it makes things more balanced.

282
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,184
[SPEAKER_05]: They are actually giving certain abilities for each class, though, that are class-specific.

283
00:21:46,864 --> 00:21:49,267
[SPEAKER_07]: And B, they say it's butchering lore, and it's kind of funny how...

284
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:54,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the people on the forums wouldn't give a damn about lore anyway if we beat them upside the head.

285
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:56,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you call yourself earlier to be a lore whore?

286
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:57,439
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a lore whore.

287
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so as the WoW whore, lore whore, the only one in this room with a level 60, what do you personally feel about this whole change?

288
00:22:05,086 --> 00:22:13,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're going to have to wait and see, story-wise, how Metzen decides to write his way into and out of this one, see if it makes sense.

289
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Balance-wise, though, I think it's a good change.

290
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:27,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Horde has been complaining how Shamans have been really underpowered for PvE content, raid content, how all they get to do is heal and lay down totems and don't get any kind of buffs like, say, Blessings like Paladins do.

291
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:33,709
[SPEAKER_07]: And Alliance has been whining that, oh, we don't have the PvP strength because we don't have Shamans.

292
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:34,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

293
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you're going to have Shamans and now you're going to have Paladins.

294
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:38,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Best of both worlds.

295
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:48,376
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, the thing is, when that expansion first hits, the servers are going to be inundated with Blood Elf Paladins and Trani, Trani, whatever.

296
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:50,597
[SPEAKER_11]: That should be the Quit Your Bitching update.

297
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:53,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Blizzard does a lot of those.

298
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:58,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I really have two minds about that, though, but I'm hoping it'll be a good thing.

299
00:22:58,322 --> 00:23:03,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'll probably play a Blood Elf Paladin, you know, just to do, say I've done it.

300
00:23:03,945 --> 00:23:07,887
[SPEAKER_07]: It's making me seriously reconsider making a Blood Elf Priest and changing him to a Paladin.

301
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:08,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

302
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:14,746
[SPEAKER_11]: I think everybody is thinking in the back of their mind, depending on whether they play more Horde or more Alliance, which kind of character.

303
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:18,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I think most of us are Horde players, you know, kind of thinking in the back of our mind what we're going to make our Blood Elf.

304
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:21,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, everybody is going to make one of these new ones.

305
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:22,689
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just interesting to me.

306
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:26,450
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already got it set from the start, but I don't want to be a squishy healer.

307
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:29,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Not on a PvP server.

308
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:30,411
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I found out.

309
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Being a priest on a PvP server is like asking for a beating.

310
00:23:33,993 --> 00:23:37,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you have a Death Wish or your, for instance, Spect Shadow.

311
00:23:37,754 --> 00:23:38,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha ha.

312
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:39,425
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

313
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So when's Burning Crusade coming out?

314
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:44,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty soon, right?

315
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:48,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Estimated release date of October, but they'll probably be closer to December.

316
00:23:49,193 --> 00:23:49,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

317
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:57,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Final Fantasy XI, we can't have a WoW story without talking about the other MMO that a lot of us have played on and off.

318
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, who gives a crap?

319
00:23:59,141 --> 00:23:59,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

320
00:23:59,402 --> 00:24:03,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little done with Final Fantasy XI, but this was exciting news.

321
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:06,688
[SPEAKER_11]: They announced earlier this week that there was a sequel being made to Final Fantasy XI.

322
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:10,721
[SPEAKER_11]: And that news came out about six or seven days ago.

323
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:16,567
[SPEAKER_11]: And then a few days later, no, unfortunately, it looks like Squeenix put out a little...

324
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:25,092
[SPEAKER_11]: As the company announced in May 2005, it is currently developing an online title for next-gen platforms, including game consoles and PCs.

325
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:29,715
[SPEAKER_11]: However, this title is being developed as a completely new MMORPG.

326
00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:36,438
[SPEAKER_11]: We will disclose further details of this title, including which platforms it's going to be on, immediately after any relevant decisions are made.

327
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:40,361
[SPEAKER_11]: But they didn't exactly say, we're not doing Final Fantasy XI, too.

328
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:44,202
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just saying, we're not going to tell you either way.

329
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:46,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy XIII, another title!

330
00:24:47,204 --> 00:24:50,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Will it involve dress-up, just like that other direct sequel?

331
00:24:50,526 --> 00:24:53,588
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously, I think it's going to be... The dress-up was great!

332
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:55,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it was all too Charlie's Angels, though.

333
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,670
[SPEAKER_05]: That was what made it great.

334
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,251
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like the ultimate girl Final Fantasy.

335
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:03,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend of Zaku in our chatroom seems to think it's Front Mission Online that they're talking about.

336
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:04,213
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be awesome!

337
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:05,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I think it's going to be Fantasy Earth Online.

338
00:25:06,174 --> 00:25:08,756
[SPEAKER_07]: They had run a couple articles about it last year.

339
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:12,118
[SPEAKER_07]: How the Enix part of Square Enix was going to do Fantasy Earth.

340
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Raven's Dolphin in chat has an interesting perspective.

341
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's not Final Fantasy XI Part 2.

342
00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:18,802
[SPEAKER_11]: He says Final Fantasy XIV, the MMO.

343
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:19,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

344
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:20,883
[SPEAKER_11]: God forbid.

345
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:21,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

346
00:25:21,964 --> 00:25:24,766
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to do one called Final Fantasy The End of Things.

347
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:27,567
[SPEAKER_02]: They said what it was in E3 2005.

348
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:32,410
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a whole bunch of stuff that was coming out in E3 2005 that wasn't there for 2006.

349
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was Fantasy.

350
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:38,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it was another MMO not of Final Fantasy.

351
00:25:38,814 --> 00:25:39,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just...

352
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:47,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, remember how everybody thought World of Mana was a game and everybody like creamed their pants because it's like, you know, oh my god, Secret of Mana Online, how awesome would that be?

353
00:25:47,557 --> 00:25:49,538
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

354
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:55,000
[SPEAKER_11]: World of Mana is like all these new Mana games where it's a marketing thing, not an actual game.

355
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it'll be cool no matter what it is.

356
00:25:59,622 --> 00:25:59,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

357
00:26:01,554 --> 00:26:05,836
[SPEAKER_11]: One other thing I just want to mention real quick, Final Fantasy XI is not without any love or upgrades.

358
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:14,260
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're playing the Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy XI, you may have noticed that you don't get any achievement points for all those hours upon hours that you pour into the game.

359
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it looks like Final Fantasy XI will be getting 32 achievements on Xbox.

360
00:26:19,842 --> 00:26:21,523
[SPEAKER_11]: This is thanks to Xbox.com.

361
00:26:21,883 --> 00:26:25,425
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all secret achievements right now, so we don't even know what they are.

362
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,006
[SPEAKER_11]: But if it's 32 achievements, that would be about 30 to 40 points apiece.

363
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:35,717
[SPEAKER_11]: The rumor is that with the next Final Fantasy XI patch, you will now be able to get achievements.

364
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:45,142
[SPEAKER_11]: My question is, since I'm a dummy and I haven't canceled my account over there yet and I'm still paying for it, could I just log in with my character and since he's a certain level and done stuff already, am I going to unlock all these achievements suddenly?

365
00:26:45,182 --> 00:26:47,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Assuming that those are what the achievements are for.

366
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:48,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't know.

367
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:49,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

368
00:26:49,597 --> 00:26:51,938
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be... Congratulations!

369
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,359
[SPEAKER_11]: You bought a new expansion!

370
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:54,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Times 32.

371
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,000
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be interesting because they could be... You're right.

372
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,861
[SPEAKER_11]: They could be things relevant to Chocobo Racing or things that are going to be the new things that they put in Final Fantasy XI.

373
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:05,202
[SPEAKER_11]: The achievements may not even have anything to do with the rest of the game.

374
00:27:05,222 --> 00:27:05,762
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be interesting.

375
00:27:05,782 --> 00:27:07,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it could be just stuff like winning a game of Ballista.

376
00:27:08,823 --> 00:27:09,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Possibly.

377
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:13,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, something that you can do over and over again.

378
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:13,945
Yeah.

379
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:14,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

380
00:27:15,182 --> 00:27:18,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we shall soon see when the next patch goes out to Final Fantasy XI.

381
00:27:20,303 --> 00:27:20,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

382
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:23,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, another news here.

383
00:27:27,184 --> 00:27:36,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Xbox Live, you know how they're doing this Xbox Live Wednesday thing where they're releasing brand new games coming out every Wednesday.

384
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:39,887
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, next week we are getting Galaga, which is awesome.

385
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,185
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course after that Street Fighter 2 and after that Pac-Man.

386
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:49,211
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are going to be about 50 live arcade games by the end of the year, which is great.

387
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is coming from Major Nelson.

388
00:27:53,957 --> 00:27:55,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically...

389
00:27:56,428 --> 00:27:57,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Night of the Round, Golden Axe

390
00:28:22,924 --> 00:28:23,965
[SPEAKER_11]: All those games sound awesome.

391
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's going to be pretty awesome.

392
00:28:25,786 --> 00:28:30,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Contra and stuff are going to be coming out as well.

393
00:28:30,548 --> 00:28:31,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Contra and Super Contra.

394
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:33,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Just all this Luminous Live, of course.

395
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So lots of good games to look up before the end of the year.

396
00:28:37,072 --> 00:28:39,493
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least they're going to be supporting live arcade for a while.

397
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:41,214
[SPEAKER_11]: All righty.

398
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:49,312
[SPEAKER_11]: One other thing that's going to be coming to Xbox Live pretty soon is a table tennis demo.

399
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:56,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Rockstar Games confirmed that a table tennis demo is on the way and this was through Major Nelson.

400
00:28:57,215 --> 00:29:06,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Major Nelson blogged, I happen to be down talking to the folks that work with Rockstar and they told me it would be okay for me to mention that there is a demo on its way to the marketplace for table tennis.

401
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I also found out that the demo is single and two player but not live play.

402
00:29:12,341 --> 00:29:13,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Live play is kind of, you know,

403
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:20,150
[SPEAKER_11]: If he gave them everything, I don't know if there'd be much point to buying the game, despite the fact that there are additional characters and arenas and things like that.

404
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,151
[SPEAKER_11]: But this will be good.

405
00:29:21,631 --> 00:29:26,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Folks wanting to find out if they want to spend the money on the game or not, even though it is next-gen budget-priced.

406
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:26,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

407
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:33,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of stuff coming in live, I think I mentioned last week Texas Hold'em announced it was going to be free.

408
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:33,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that's not the case.

409
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It ends up being that they haven't decided on a price point yet, but it's definitely not going to be free.

410
00:29:40,123 --> 00:29:40,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

411
00:29:41,502 --> 00:29:47,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, you know, probably, you know, decent price, but no handouts this time, unfortunately.

412
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:50,706
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was something we reported on last week, right?

413
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:52,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was, that it was going to be free.

414
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,228
[SPEAKER_02]: That was originally the announcement, but apparently not.

415
00:29:57,728 --> 00:30:01,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently they found out, hey, you know what, we can make money off this, so let's do that.

416
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:07,201
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, Microsoft is seeing some pretty good Xbox 360 sales.

417
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:19,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Microsoft reported that the earnings for its fourth quarter, which ended June 30, 2006, because it's a fiscal year, they got $2.3 billion in profits on revenue of $11.8 billion.

418
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:25,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Its server and tools division was the fastest growing sector, having $3.18 billion of quarterly income.

419
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,353
[SPEAKER_11]: When you get to Xbox revenue,

420
00:30:32,557 --> 00:30:34,499
[SPEAKER_11]: This would be Xbox and Xbox 360.

421
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:37,401
[SPEAKER_11]: This increased about $503 million or 129%.

422
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:41,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, that being attributed to Xbox 360.

423
00:30:41,544 --> 00:30:49,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the home entertainment division, unfortunately for them, had an operating loss of $414 million for the quarter.

424
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:56,735
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're saying that the biggest reason for this is because they lose money on each Xbox 360 sold.

425
00:30:58,116 --> 00:31:00,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of some interesting profits and stuff.

426
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:01,660
[SPEAKER_11]: from Microsoft.

427
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,002
[SPEAKER_11]: If you'd like to follow that, or if you own stock in Microsoft, I bet you really want to know about that information.

428
00:31:23,373 --> 00:31:24,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one moment, folks.

429
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:24,814
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting reorganized.

430
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:31,539
[SPEAKER_05]: There actually is another game coming out on Xbox 360.

431
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:43,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's more in the realm of the unconfirmed rumor, but it's been stated that Guitar Hero is coming to the Xbox 360.

432
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:51,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft hasn't commented yet, but Red Octane is actually working on the PS2 sequel and a 360 version.

433
00:31:53,493 --> 00:31:55,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, that's to look forward to.

434
00:31:57,426 --> 00:32:08,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's interesting.

435
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:09,872
[SPEAKER_11]: What would you think?

436
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:17,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that Guitar Hero would see a lot of its fanbase moving over to Xbox with this, or is this just a way for Guitar Hero to expand its fanbase, or what?

437
00:32:17,817 --> 00:32:18,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Both.

438
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:21,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Online play That would be a huge selling point for Xbox version, that's for sure

439
00:32:46,526 --> 00:32:54,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's interesting because the story talks about Guitar Hero 2, but in DDR, yeah, the games are similar, but they're not really the same.

440
00:32:54,211 --> 00:33:01,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultramix offers completely different types of features than the Extreme and I'm assuming Supernova are going to be offering.

441
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:04,599
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of, I don't know, it's a little bit apples and oranges to me.

442
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:09,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they could do, I think it would just be different on Xbox or should be different.

443
00:33:10,694 --> 00:33:35,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, and including, you know, since we're talking about Guitar Hero here, there was actually a MySpace blog post put out by the Guitar Hero team, and it was actually entitled Ghoul's Night Out, which teases a logo to possibly a brand new game with the skull and cross guitars with the title Ghoul, and Ghoul...

444
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks to be an acronym for something.

445
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:41,749
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting, though, is no one really knows what exactly that means.

446
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:54,132
[SPEAKER_02]: People are, you know, suspecting maybe it's like a Guitar Hero Online User League or something like that or some sort of, you know, some sort of online play or maybe even the Xbox 360 game.

447
00:33:54,312 --> 00:34:00,173
[SPEAKER_02]: But, of course, right now, nothing more than a logo, nothing more than speculation, so at least they're working on something.

448
00:34:00,253 --> 00:34:02,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Just trying to get the fanboys talking.

449
00:34:02,514 --> 00:34:03,774
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically, and it's working.

450
00:34:03,894 --> 00:34:04,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at us.

451
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:06,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix

452
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:23,131
[SPEAKER_11]: and so on.

453
00:34:47,779 --> 00:34:52,363
[SPEAKER_11]: And it looked like it had stationary backgrounds, which for a plug-and-play device wouldn't be too surprising.

454
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:54,285
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't put a whole lot in those things.

455
00:34:54,705 --> 00:34:59,290
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's very interesting, these plug-and-play dance pads.

456
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,671
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen these before.

457
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:13,503
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw the crappy 8-bit Nintendo-style dance pads at the mall before, but now Konami looks like they're going to be endorsing these official ones and kind of a more kid audience going for the DDR Disney mix.

458
00:35:14,002 --> 00:35:23,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, and speaking of wonderful plug-and-play DDR type things, Konami is putting out Strawberry Shortcake Dance Dance Revolution.

459
00:35:24,112 --> 00:35:37,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can play as Strawberry Shortcake in Dance Dance Revolution with the equally cheesy dance pad that looks like, I don't know, basically getting any five-year-old pre-teen girl super excited about...

460
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:41,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumping around to her favorite Strawberry Shortcake song.

461
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:46,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, to be honest, I didn't think there was that many Strawberry Shortcake songs out there.

462
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think there were that many either.

463
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:50,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even think Strawberry Shortcake was still popular.

464
00:35:51,678 --> 00:35:53,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, where's My Little Pony?

465
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,521
[SPEAKER_05]: My Little Pony's out again too.

466
00:35:56,562 --> 00:35:58,804
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it would have been Bratz DDR, if nothing else.

467
00:35:59,545 --> 00:36:05,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, remember those, I don't remember whatever came of this, but they were talking about a DDR TV show.

468
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:06,239
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

469
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:30,994
[SPEAKER_02]: D.D.R.

470
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:31,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardcore

471
00:36:51,434 --> 00:36:54,615
[SPEAKER_11]: that maybe the parents will want a DDR for themselves, so on and so on.

472
00:36:54,655 --> 00:36:58,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I look at it in the same way that they got the Oha style one in Japan, honestly.

473
00:36:58,276 --> 00:36:59,157
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

474
00:36:59,197 --> 00:36:59,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

475
00:36:59,757 --> 00:37:00,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a good point.

476
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:07,559
[SPEAKER_02]: And this features such wonderful songs like the theme music, Straw-ba-ba-ba-berry shortcake.

477
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:12,121
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently Strawberry Shortcake has a stutter.

478
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,361
[SPEAKER_02]: That's excellent.

479
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:16,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Straw-ba-ba-ba-ba-shortcake!

480
00:37:16,662 --> 00:37:17,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah!

481
00:37:18,523 --> 00:37:18,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

482
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:19,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

483
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:23,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Blaze Revolution says, I bought DDR Disney Mix for my sister and I played it for her.

484
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:24,538
[SPEAKER_11]: LOL.

485
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,159
[SPEAKER_11]: That brings the family together.

486
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:26,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have both of them.

487
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:30,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Except I didn't get the Nintendo 64 one.

488
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:35,087
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, DDR Disney Mix did have something that was pretty revolutionary for DDR at the time.

489
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:36,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Magic.

490
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:38,066
[SPEAKER_05]: DanceMagic is fabulous.

491
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:40,668
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the best part of the game.

492
00:37:40,768 --> 00:37:43,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, for the hardcore DDR fans, that was the whole reason to own it.

493
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:48,176
[SPEAKER_11]: That and Electrical Parade, says VidPower, except Electrical Parade wasn't in the US version.

494
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:49,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Only in the Japanese one.

495
00:37:49,177 --> 00:37:52,340
[SPEAKER_11]: You had to get Disney's Rave, the Japanese version.

496
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney's Rave, though, did have a few better songs, I have to say.

497
00:37:55,844 --> 00:37:56,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It had the Macarena.

498
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:00,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember you making me play that in Milpitas.

499
00:38:01,004 --> 00:38:03,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, okay, Rob, pick me a song.

500
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:06,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Macarena, I hate you.

501
00:38:07,346 --> 00:38:08,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Mr. Bassman.

502
00:38:09,007 --> 00:38:09,687
[SPEAKER_02]: That song's awesome.

503
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,328
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, but it's like slow.

504
00:38:11,348 --> 00:38:16,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Mr. Bassman a few weeks ago, and I nearly died because I was out of shape.

505
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:22,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeremy Todd 1 suggests DDR Pirates of the Caribbean, the game where you have to dance to dodge the skeletons.

506
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:28,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, if DDR Disney does well, you can expect a whole bunch of freaking clones of it.

507
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:32,838
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when you do a jig and the stage moves like you're on a boat.

508
00:38:33,238 --> 00:38:34,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew, why are you making a face?

509
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,601
[SPEAKER_11]: You're about to swallow your bottom lip there.

510
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:38,282
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my sad panda face.

511
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:41,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Why, though?

512
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:44,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't exposure for the DDR brand a good thing for the fanbase?

513
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:46,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Not when it's freaking Disney.

514
00:38:46,248 --> 00:38:47,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave it to Kingdom Hearts or something.

515
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Kingdom Hearts?

516
00:38:49,591 --> 00:38:50,752
[SPEAKER_07]: No more DDR Disney.

517
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:53,163
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

518
00:39:16,162 --> 00:39:17,744
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole part was bad enough.

519
00:39:17,904 --> 00:39:23,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately it's not going to happen since there was a partnership between Konami and Buena Vista to put out a ton more games.

520
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:27,237
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to see a lot more of these before they go away.

521
00:39:28,527 --> 00:39:29,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will never go away, by the way.

522
00:39:30,288 --> 00:39:31,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray, hooray.

523
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:50,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, speaking of DDR, Ohasta, and things that just won't go away, every week here on this program, we have DarkSakura's Website of the Week segment because she serves the web up and down and left and right and back and forth, inside and out, looking for sites that you need to be visiting right now.

524
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,041
[SPEAKER_11]: So, DarkSakura, where should the kids be going in their browsers right now?

525
00:39:54,844 --> 00:39:56,325
[SPEAKER_05]: World of Datecraft World of Datecraft

526
00:40:25,168 --> 00:40:32,189
[SPEAKER_05]: The website is wowdate.fullwiki.com Yeah, I'll spell it out.

527
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:37,871
[SPEAKER_05]: w-o-w-d-a-t-e dot f-u-l-l-w-i-k-i dot com Which I will not spell.

528
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:39,491
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can't spell com, go back to school.

529
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:45,312
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, this site is a dating site for people on World of Warcraft.

530
00:40:46,172 --> 00:40:49,913
[SPEAKER_05]: How to meet people who may or may not be of the gender they specify.

531
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:53,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, wait.

532
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:54,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Or the age that they specify.

533
00:40:54,974 --> 00:41:00,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this a site for me to put up a personal ad for my WoW character or a personal ad for me?

534
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:07,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know my friend, this sick, sick woman she is, has a MySpace for her WoW character.

535
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:12,168
[SPEAKER_05]: This is apparently real profiles.

536
00:41:12,688 --> 00:41:13,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can put your pictures.

537
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:19,354
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also couples on here, too, I guess, looking for other couples to experiment with.

538
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:20,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

539
00:41:20,455 --> 00:41:23,257
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Datecraft, where everybody looks like the Horde.

540
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:36,344
[SPEAKER_05]: So you never know that that 18-year-old woman from Cleveland might really be a 56-year-old man from Albany, Georgia.

541
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:38,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, it's a post-op.

542
00:41:38,345 --> 00:41:38,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Woman.

543
00:41:40,777 --> 00:41:41,938
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all right, all right.

544
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:45,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Confession, I do play a female orc warlock, okay?

545
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:46,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

546
00:41:46,682 --> 00:41:49,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I will never play a male character in any MMO ever again.

547
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:51,186
[SPEAKER_11]: I will always play female characters.

548
00:41:51,246 --> 00:41:51,786
[SPEAKER_11]: You know why?

549
00:41:52,587 --> 00:41:53,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Free stuff.

550
00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:54,849
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

551
00:41:55,169 --> 00:41:55,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Free stuff?

552
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,650
[SPEAKER_11]: It's sad and true.

553
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Even on board, free stuff.

554
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:00,213
[SPEAKER_11]: You people are making me very ill.

555
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Slash dance for silver.

556
00:42:02,095 --> 00:42:02,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Works every time.

557
00:42:03,716 --> 00:42:08,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Even bipedal cows get free stuff.

558
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:10,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I play with my coworkers and they give me money.

559
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:12,814
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like it either.

560
00:42:13,134 --> 00:42:14,194
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like that difference.

561
00:42:14,214 --> 00:42:14,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Then don't do it!

562
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Take the moral high ground!

563
00:42:16,556 --> 00:42:16,836
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

564
00:42:17,657 --> 00:42:18,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Free stuff, Jamie!

565
00:42:19,898 --> 00:42:24,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I can actually get away with cuting on a game and having them give me money.

566
00:42:25,122 --> 00:42:27,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, if you can, shake what the Earth Mother gave you.

567
00:42:30,545 --> 00:42:33,847
[SPEAKER_11]: VidPower says 99.9% of female night elves are guys.

568
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:34,668
[SPEAKER_11]: True.

569
00:42:34,808 --> 00:42:35,828
[SPEAKER_11]: This is truth.

570
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:36,569
[SPEAKER_07]: True statement.

571
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:38,203
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

572
00:43:07,956 --> 00:43:14,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Back on Virtual On, my two characters were either Fae-En or the big bulky one with the big gun.

573
00:43:15,298 --> 00:43:19,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was like, who I can shoot you from over here and you can't get close to me.

574
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:23,620
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I liked about Ragnarok Online when I played that is... Nobody's ugly?

575
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:26,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, because everybody looks the same.

576
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:29,322
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing you could do is you could cross-dress on Ragnarok Online.

577
00:43:29,362 --> 00:43:30,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, remember I used to have the giant bow?

578
00:43:31,022 --> 00:43:32,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I had the giant bow in my hair.

579
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:32,863
[SPEAKER_11]: That was awesome.

580
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:34,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have that picture.

581
00:43:34,477 --> 00:43:35,357
[SPEAKER_05]: It used to be my cell phone.

582
00:43:35,377 --> 00:43:35,837
[SPEAKER_05]: My rogue has a dress.

583
00:43:36,137 --> 00:43:36,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

584
00:43:37,978 --> 00:43:39,499
[SPEAKER_07]: My rogue has a spare dress.

585
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:43,381
[SPEAKER_07]: For when the roleplay gets kind of weird.

586
00:43:44,642 --> 00:43:45,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Dot, dot, dot.

587
00:43:45,282 --> 00:43:46,643
[SPEAKER_11]: The show's starting to get a little weird.

588
00:43:47,464 --> 00:43:51,726
[SPEAKER_05]: And you admit this on the airway in front of several thousand downloaders.

589
00:43:51,746 --> 00:43:52,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

590
00:43:52,406 --> 00:43:53,447
[SPEAKER_07]: You can, uh, no.

591
00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:57,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can message him at this is 23rd Megan.

592
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:57,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's this?

593
00:43:58,009 --> 00:43:58,830
[SPEAKER_11]: At World of Warcraft.

594
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:02,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Will you do a search for 21-year-olds in the Sacramento area?

595
00:44:02,813 --> 00:44:04,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I want to see if Andrew comes up.

596
00:44:05,056 --> 00:44:06,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, will you look for some profiles in our area?

597
00:44:07,298 --> 00:44:08,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we should respond to one.

598
00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:09,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you on here, Andrew?

599
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to find you?

600
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:10,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet.

601
00:44:14,384 --> 00:44:15,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I will do that just for shits.

602
00:44:16,886 --> 00:44:18,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I will indulge you on that.

603
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it actually lets you look in area.

604
00:44:22,812 --> 00:44:23,813
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there's a guy.

605
00:44:23,853 --> 00:44:25,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I found a guy in Baton Rouge.

606
00:44:25,574 --> 00:44:26,035
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not bad.

607
00:44:27,725 --> 00:44:30,447
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a little far, but it's some long-distance dating.

608
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:31,188
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

609
00:44:31,228 --> 00:44:32,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, even though we're giving this crap a hard time.

610
00:44:32,709 --> 00:44:35,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I found a person who looks like Tran, as in Big Alien.

611
00:44:38,837 --> 00:44:39,617
[SPEAKER_11]: From Australia.

612
00:44:40,158 --> 00:44:41,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though we're giving this crap a hard time.

613
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:46,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to be devil's advocate for a minute talking about wow dating and all that stuff.

614
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:57,227
[SPEAKER_11]: When it comes to long distance relationships, isn't wow like a way that you could, and please don't take this as me saying I do this because I don't, but like I've heard of other people doing this.

615
00:44:57,587 --> 00:45:02,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't wow kind of a way that you could like be with somebody even though you're not?

616
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,040
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

617
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:10,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you can adventure and do things together with somebody in a virtual form, even though you're not there, really there.

618
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:18,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, when Dan and I first met, we would just hang out on an AOL chat for, like, ever.

619
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, at the time, that's what we had.

620
00:45:20,171 --> 00:45:21,312
[SPEAKER_05]: We played Gemstone for a little while.

621
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:25,475
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, back in the day, Gemstone.

622
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:26,215
[SPEAKER_11]: And Slingo?

623
00:45:26,776 --> 00:45:27,837
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I hate Slingo.

624
00:45:28,097 --> 00:45:28,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

625
00:45:28,457 --> 00:45:29,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played Tetranet.

626
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:31,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a Tetranet girl.

627
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:33,821
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, it's...

628
00:45:35,518 --> 00:45:43,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose it's sort of a way to at least see a part of you together with the person you're interested in.

629
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:49,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And online relationships can make long distance easier, I think.

630
00:45:50,685 --> 00:45:53,946
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, nothing's going to make up for the face-to-face meeting.

631
00:45:54,086 --> 00:45:58,108
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you start wanking to the in-game sprites, that might be a little... No, no, no, that's not going to happen.

632
00:45:59,805 --> 00:46:00,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

633
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:01,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Something you need to share?

634
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:01,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, no.

635
00:46:02,247 --> 00:46:06,430
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're the one who's been buying out the plastic covers at Fry's.

636
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:07,971
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was you on YouTube.

637
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:08,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

638
00:46:10,073 --> 00:46:11,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Under Wankmaster.

639
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:19,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, though, online gaming can be kind of a touchy thing with relationships.

640
00:46:20,555 --> 00:46:23,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially in party-based games, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy.

641
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:31,086
[SPEAKER_07]: If your significant other isn't, say, pulling his or her weight, that could lead to an even bigger argument than you can ever have in person.

642
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:33,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

643
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,810
[SPEAKER_07]: So you think WoW could actually cause fights?

644
00:46:36,011 --> 00:46:37,392
[SPEAKER_07]: It could cause a whole lot of fights.

645
00:46:37,912 --> 00:46:38,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

646
00:46:38,994 --> 00:46:41,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if one of them happens to be a healer.

647
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking through chat here.

648
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:47,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of thought it would be a little... You can actually get married on Ragnarok on the Korean servers.

649
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:49,553
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it would be a little more lit up in chat.

650
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:50,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do we never get this stuff?

651
00:46:50,654 --> 00:46:54,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Yuri Lover in chat says, when I play WoW, I get free tampons and condoms.

652
00:46:54,756 --> 00:46:57,738
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea how that works, but okay.

653
00:46:57,778 --> 00:46:58,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Hack!

654
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,139
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be in the next patch, probably.

655
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:01,340
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a hell of a hack.

656
00:47:04,162 --> 00:47:05,743
[SPEAKER_11]: What exactly would a tampon do for you?

657
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:06,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus two to stamina?

658
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:07,964
[SPEAKER_11]: What exactly?

659
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:15,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think that they should do the hat idea like they had in Ragnarok with the poo hat and the apple of archer.

660
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:23,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeremy Todd 1 says the WoW dating service is just for nerds who can tell their friends that they have a girlfriend.

661
00:47:24,814 --> 00:47:25,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so?

662
00:47:25,855 --> 00:47:26,956
[SPEAKER_11]: I resemble that remark.

663
00:47:27,196 --> 00:47:30,338
[SPEAKER_11]: EvilCheese666 says ultimate WoW pickup line.

664
00:47:30,658 --> 00:47:32,639
[SPEAKER_11]: So, hey baby, you grind here often?

665
00:47:33,425 --> 00:47:33,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice!

666
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:35,287
[SPEAKER_05]: That one's great.

667
00:47:36,068 --> 00:47:37,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll show you my Arcanite Reaper.

668
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:42,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I didn't say that on the... What'd you say?

669
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:43,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked my proficiencies, by the way.

670
00:47:43,595 --> 00:47:44,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what's that?

671
00:47:44,616 --> 00:47:48,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked tailoring and herbalism.

672
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Fun.

673
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:51,963
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can, you know, go get Gloomweed.

674
00:47:53,725 --> 00:47:56,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Your lover says he plays Triple X WoW, so now where are you going?

675
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:56,848
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can make...

676
00:47:57,566 --> 00:48:01,947
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make clothes with hemp and you can... I can make hemp clothes and be a hippie.

677
00:48:02,727 --> 00:48:03,808
[SPEAKER_01]: A hippie zombie.

678
00:48:04,768 --> 00:48:06,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we probably should go on to the next topic now.

679
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:08,589
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

680
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:09,629
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

681
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:10,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe later.

682
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,090
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll come back to it later.

683
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:12,030
[SPEAKER_11]: This is huge.

684
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:12,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is huge.

685
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,431
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a rumor, but it could be huge.

686
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:21,833
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know that we've been speculating for a long time that Apple wants to get into the gaming market.

687
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:26,736
[SPEAKER_11]: and also there's been speculation out there that Apple and Nintendo want to get into bed together.

688
00:48:28,037 --> 00:48:34,341
[SPEAKER_11]: So that just makes this story... Actually, Apple and Nintendo have been dating on World of Warcraft, believe it or not.

689
00:48:36,303 --> 00:48:47,727
[SPEAKER_11]: No, seriously, there is a rumor going around on MacRumors, and it's saying that Apple is currently planning on making classic Nintendo games playable on the next iPod.

690
00:48:48,047 --> 00:48:55,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the website is not able to confirm this speculation, but, you know, it does fit into that whole fanboy dream, doesn't it?

691
00:48:56,010 --> 00:49:00,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, MacRumors says that it's going to be playable with a special accessory.

692
00:49:02,712 --> 00:49:03,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever that is.

693
00:49:03,893 --> 00:49:05,193
[SPEAKER_02]: That special accessory...

694
00:49:06,095 --> 00:49:06,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Transvibrator.

695
00:49:07,576 --> 00:49:12,438
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's... Special Accessory is another game system.

696
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:14,940
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think, Loki?

697
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,961
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really curious to see what you think about this.

698
00:49:16,981 --> 00:49:18,381
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I need your input on this.

699
00:49:18,882 --> 00:49:19,442
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I think?

700
00:49:19,562 --> 00:49:21,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, well, that would be disruption.

701
00:49:21,123 --> 00:49:27,646
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always talking about the... I think it's all, you know, bullshit just because I don't think that they would want their classics to be played on iPod.

702
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:32,989
[SPEAKER_02]: One, you couldn't do it on iPod anyways because, I mean, come on, the iPod is not meant for gaming.

703
00:49:33,249 --> 00:49:33,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

704
00:49:34,301 --> 00:49:39,783
[SPEAKER_11]: But, okay, but let's say, like, iPods have that little slot at the bottom that you usually put the USB charger into.

705
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:41,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you wouldn't know that, but they do.

706
00:49:41,703 --> 00:49:45,445
[SPEAKER_11]: You could easily plug a joystick in there, or like a little NES-style controller.

707
00:49:45,705 --> 00:49:46,085
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

708
00:49:46,565 --> 00:49:47,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaming system on the go.

709
00:49:47,465 --> 00:49:47,945
[SPEAKER_11]: I could see it.

710
00:49:48,346 --> 00:49:49,626
[SPEAKER_11]: You couldn't do it with the current setup.

711
00:49:49,646 --> 00:49:51,286
[SPEAKER_11]: You would have to have this attachment, but you could do it.

712
00:49:51,587 --> 00:49:53,507
[SPEAKER_11]: But the question is, would they want to?

713
00:49:53,627 --> 00:49:58,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Because my thought when reading this was, well, what about virtual console and being able to download to your DS?

714
00:49:58,889 --> 00:49:59,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

715
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:02,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I'm speculating with that.

716
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:04,151
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't said you'll officially be able to do that.

717
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:08,072
[SPEAKER_11]: But logically, you'll be able to download some stuff to the DS.

718
00:50:08,132 --> 00:50:09,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not virtual console games?

719
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:11,233
[SPEAKER_11]: So why would Nintendo compete with itself?

720
00:50:12,374 --> 00:50:13,654
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't compete with itself.

721
00:50:13,674 --> 00:50:16,195
[SPEAKER_02]: They would use it probably just to help promote themselves.

722
00:50:16,295 --> 00:50:16,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

723
00:50:16,635 --> 00:50:18,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think... So you're thinking 1Z, 2Z games?

724
00:50:18,396 --> 00:50:20,417
[SPEAKER_02]: But who's going to buy the accessory for 1Z, 2Z games?

725
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:21,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

726
00:50:21,077 --> 00:50:22,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the thing, too.

727
00:50:22,338 --> 00:50:28,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they would do that because just because you're playing retro games on your iPod does not make you want to buy...

728
00:50:30,626 --> 00:50:39,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how they're going to make money off this.

729
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:47,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if you buy each individual title or whatever and download it to your iPod, I guess that would be kind of neat, but whatever.

730
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,271
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, I don't think this is going to happen.

731
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:52,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Apple is trying to grow a gaming penis and isn't doing a good job of it.

732
00:50:58,302 --> 00:51:00,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Apple does have a booth at E3 every year.

733
00:51:00,284 --> 00:51:04,066
[SPEAKER_11]: It's little, and it's in the back, and you have to have an invite to get there, but they're there.

734
00:51:04,487 --> 00:51:09,250
[SPEAKER_11]: But I always kind of assumed it was for their graphics or type stuff that they can do for computer.

735
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:11,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, and then let's see.

736
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Macman says they're announcing a new iPod this August.

737
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:14,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's no surprise.

738
00:51:15,194 --> 00:51:17,495
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to announce a new iPod to sell them this Christmas.

739
00:51:17,815 --> 00:51:22,078
[SPEAKER_11]: But my thought was it's going to be the movie iPod because it's already been going around.

740
00:51:22,118 --> 00:51:24,920
[SPEAKER_11]: They want to put that in iTunes, so that makes sense.

741
00:51:25,612 --> 00:51:26,593
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think about this, Jamie?

742
00:51:26,613 --> 00:51:30,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Would this make you want a game on the iPod, having NES games on it?

743
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:33,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it'd be something to do at work.

744
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:34,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding, no.

745
00:51:34,578 --> 00:51:35,738
[SPEAKER_05]: In between the Animal Crossing?

746
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:37,660
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't play Animal Crossing at work anymore.

747
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I take a nap.

748
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:40,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.

749
00:51:41,462 --> 00:51:42,222
[SPEAKER_05]: My doctor told me to.

750
00:51:44,264 --> 00:51:44,704
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.

751
00:51:44,724 --> 00:51:45,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I would do it.

752
00:51:45,344 --> 00:51:46,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Say that I'm stuck in line...

753
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:55,928
[SPEAKER_05]: for the bathroom at the Riptide Arcade, which I was standing in for 25 minutes.

754
00:51:56,508 --> 00:51:56,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

755
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:57,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It gave me something to do.

756
00:52:00,132 --> 00:52:00,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

757
00:52:01,826 --> 00:52:02,126
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

758
00:52:03,306 --> 00:52:03,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

759
00:52:04,127 --> 00:52:10,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of other portable music systems, the Zune has been officially confirmed by Microsoft.

760
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:24,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It is coming, and it's actually all will be revealed soon, according to them, in a brand-new Billboard magazine article, which is going to be talking about it and how they also plan to release additional Zune-branded devices.

761
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:28,352
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a fun little website you can go view, which...

762
00:52:29,468 --> 00:52:30,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

763
00:52:49,531 --> 00:52:59,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So one kind of interesting thing though, they said that it will reportedly include access to digital media and a wide range of Windows-powered devices.

764
00:53:00,274 --> 00:53:08,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And also they're saying that it's going to be something that aspires to be one part MySpace, one part iTunes, and part Xbox Live.

765
00:53:09,216 --> 00:53:19,078
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what exactly that's supposed to mean, but they're saying that maybe after this you're going to see probably a video player and possibly a portable games device.

766
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:22,283
[SPEAKER_02]: All branded with this brand new Zune thing.

767
00:53:23,384 --> 00:53:25,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this have anything to do with gaming though?

768
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:27,868
[SPEAKER_09]: In the end, do you think anything gaming will come of this?

769
00:53:28,188 --> 00:53:41,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, one thing that was interesting about that, and I remember reading this a while back, is the Zune is actually going to be fit with a processor that's a bit more powerful than you would really need for playing music on it.

770
00:53:42,737 --> 00:53:49,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something comparable to maybe like a PSP or even more powerful than that, which is interesting when you think about it.

771
00:53:51,441 --> 00:53:51,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

772
00:53:52,722 --> 00:53:55,063
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's interesting you brought up the whole MySpace thing too.

773
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:56,603
[SPEAKER_11]: MySpace is interesting.

774
00:53:56,663 --> 00:53:58,364
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, Orange Launch Radio has a MySpace.

775
00:53:58,464 --> 00:53:59,625
[SPEAKER_11]: You should add us as your friend today.

776
00:53:59,705 --> 00:54:01,225
[SPEAKER_11]: MySpace.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

777
00:54:01,265 --> 00:54:01,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

778
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:03,666
[SPEAKER_11]: But MySpace is huge right now.

779
00:54:03,727 --> 00:54:06,348
[SPEAKER_11]: What is it, like the fourth most visited site on the internet?

780
00:54:06,668 --> 00:54:06,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

781
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think more people want a piece of Myspace.

782
00:54:10,152 --> 00:54:12,974
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think competitors to Myspace work as well.

783
00:54:13,174 --> 00:54:16,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Why aren't people trying to team up with Myspace?

784
00:54:16,075 --> 00:54:16,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about this.

785
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:20,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Altel Wireless has that Myspace on-the-go type thing.

786
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:23,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually is branded with Myspace.

787
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:25,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the hell you'd do with that.

788
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Post messages, I guess?

789
00:54:27,581 --> 00:54:27,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

790
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:31,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, though, that's something that they can have and maybe even add later on.

791
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:36,165
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have MyZune.com or something like that where you'd have your own

792
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:37,946
[SPEAKER_02]: MySpace is so interesting though.

793
00:54:37,966 --> 00:54:42,127
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that site that everybody uses because they have to, but nobody likes to admit they use it.

794
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:43,728
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

795
00:55:02,952 --> 00:55:17,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I stayed after Clerks 2 to see the MySpace names on there, and apparently I'm on there twice, but it's like six rows of names going pretty fast down the screen, and even though it's in alphabetical order by our last name, it's still fucking hard to find yourself on there.

796
00:55:18,564 --> 00:55:19,184
[SPEAKER_02]: and the DVD.

797
00:55:19,424 --> 00:55:21,204
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have everybody that's on there right now.

798
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:23,645
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's over 100,000 names on the DVD.

799
00:55:25,165 --> 00:55:27,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Our buddy Bobby Blackwolf is in chat right now.

800
00:55:27,846 --> 00:55:30,766
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, he had his one year birthday tonight for his show.

801
00:55:30,806 --> 00:55:32,166
[SPEAKER_11]: So congratulations, Bobby.

802
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:35,147
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's all downhill from there.

803
00:55:36,607 --> 00:55:38,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Blackwolf says, Microsoft's ad campaign.

804
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:41,728
[SPEAKER_11]: MySpace is where the internet goes to die.

805
00:55:42,128 --> 00:55:46,009
[SPEAKER_11]: MyZune is where the internet goes to live anywhere.

806
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:47,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Get it?

807
00:55:47,189 --> 00:55:47,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Live?

808
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:47,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Life?

809
00:55:50,274 --> 00:55:51,974
[SPEAKER_11]: It's true, though.

810
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:53,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, that's pretty punny.

811
00:55:53,635 --> 00:55:55,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not writing that shit down, Bobby.

812
00:55:55,636 --> 00:55:57,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't ask.

813
00:55:58,417 --> 00:55:58,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

814
00:55:58,957 --> 00:56:00,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you a big MySpace fan, DarkSakura?

815
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:02,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm only there because I have to be.

816
00:56:03,082 --> 00:56:04,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, that's how I feel about it too.

817
00:56:04,622 --> 00:56:08,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have friends that won't get on LiveJournal, so I have to keep up with them on MySpace.

818
00:56:08,603 --> 00:56:11,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I did find one of my best friends from high school.

819
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:16,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's kind of the same reason I use it, is that I found people that I would never have reconnected with.

820
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:20,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone I didn't like, his sister messaged me.

821
00:56:21,067 --> 00:56:22,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Said, oh yeah, my brother's so cool.

822
00:56:22,507 --> 00:56:23,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you friends with him?

823
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:24,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

824
00:56:24,307 --> 00:56:26,988
[SPEAKER_11]: You know the other great thing about MySpace, and I swear I'll get back into games.

825
00:56:27,308 --> 00:56:29,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been able to go back to my high school graduating class

826
00:56:30,222 --> 00:56:32,263
[SPEAKER_11]: and see who's gay.

827
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:36,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you can go back and really see what became of everybody.

828
00:56:36,186 --> 00:56:37,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, oh, I knew he was gay.

829
00:56:37,447 --> 00:56:38,147
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew she was gay.

830
00:56:38,567 --> 00:56:39,268
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew that.

831
00:56:39,448 --> 00:56:41,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And then all the people that had 70 babies.

832
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:44,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Just everything played out exactly like you expected.

833
00:56:44,091 --> 00:56:46,652
[SPEAKER_00]: You turned out to be a breeder.

834
00:56:46,712 --> 00:56:47,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

835
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:49,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

836
00:56:50,249 --> 00:56:52,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, sorry for that randomness there.

837
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get back to games and we'll talk about Konami.

838
00:56:55,432 --> 00:56:56,972
[SPEAKER_11]: We love to talk about Konami.

839
00:56:56,992 --> 00:56:58,493
[SPEAKER_11]: We've talked about them for years and years and years.

840
00:56:59,093 --> 00:57:05,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Konami has announced a partnership with mobile gaming company Tokyopop to launch a new series of mobile games.

841
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:10,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Tokyopop is kind of like this youth-oriented entertainment and all that stuff.

842
00:57:10,418 --> 00:57:13,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Tokyopop is also the number one manga company in the U.S.

843
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:18,602
[SPEAKER_11]: and they will be launching together a series of mobile games starting with East Coast Rising.

844
00:57:19,348 --> 00:57:23,991
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a story that has to do with pirates and high seas adventure and that will be available in early fall.

845
00:57:24,872 --> 00:57:27,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Comes a quote from Stu Levy, the CEO of Tokyopop.

846
00:57:27,774 --> 00:57:33,457
[SPEAKER_11]: We are very excited to be partnering with Konami to move to Tokyopop's creative juice in the white hot area of mobile gaming.

847
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:39,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Our two brands both stand for an east meets west aesthetic that really speaks out to fans worldwide.

848
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,803
[SPEAKER_11]: So working together is a natural fit that will truly push the envelope.

849
00:57:44,184 --> 00:57:45,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Should be interesting to see where that partnership goes.

850
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:46,645
[SPEAKER_11]: X-Rated

851
00:57:59,073 --> 00:57:59,353
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

852
00:58:23,695 --> 00:58:36,821
[SPEAKER_05]: My first email actually has to do with something that my husband's been ogling over, but I'd like to thank our dear friend Rob with Two Bees for mentioning it to me.

853
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:43,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Stern, basically the only company that's still making pinball machines, has a Pirates of the Caribbean pinball machine.

854
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:46,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw pictures of it last night.

855
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually looks pretty darn cool.

856
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:53,965
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a sinking ship and a treasure chest and all kinds of cool stuff that pops up.

857
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:58,307
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's actually around $4,000 right now.

858
00:58:58,788 --> 00:59:04,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we've been sort of debating, can we justify the expense of a $4,000 pinball machine?

859
00:59:04,611 --> 00:59:05,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's do it.

860
00:59:07,028 --> 00:59:19,978
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, I posted a bit of an article on here that said, to quote on here, Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is the perfect title and theme for a pinball, said Factory Honcho Gary Stern.

861
00:59:20,439 --> 00:59:28,665
[SPEAKER_05]: It lends itself to lots of mechanical action pinball shots and toys for casual players, yet the story cries for deep rules to challenge the best of players.

862
00:59:29,526 --> 00:59:34,910
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I've heard from other pinball geeks like me and my hubby, it's supposed to be pretty hardcore, so...

863
00:59:36,462 --> 00:59:37,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Got another email.

864
00:59:37,702 --> 00:59:43,604
[SPEAKER_05]: We got one, a short one from Crispy Creamy, who's one of our chatroom people too.

865
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:49,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Said, hey guys, I just got Guitar Hero for my birthday and it totally rocks, but I would also like to try out the new Guitar Freaks game.

866
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:50,887
[SPEAKER_05]: New?

867
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:53,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Because my Guitar Freaks controller broke.

868
00:59:53,568 --> 00:59:55,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it possible to use a Guitar Hero controller on Guitar Freaks?

869
00:59:55,849 --> 00:59:56,649
[SPEAKER_05]: The answer is yes.

870
00:59:58,589 --> 00:59:58,890
[SPEAKER_10]: It is?

871
00:59:59,230 --> 00:59:59,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

872
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:00,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

873
01:00:00,717 --> 01:00:01,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that.

874
01:00:01,538 --> 01:00:03,660
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have said no, but I haven't tried.

875
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:08,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the Guitar Freaks controller works on Guitar Hero 2 only barely.

876
01:00:09,265 --> 01:00:11,547
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to configure it, but we were trying to do two-player.

877
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they did experiments that showed that wasn't true.

878
01:00:14,249 --> 01:00:14,409
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

879
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:16,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's barely compatible, but it is.

880
01:00:18,753 --> 01:00:19,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be damned.

881
01:00:20,634 --> 01:00:24,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember how we talked about the... Oh, maybe it was one of the shows where you weren't here.

882
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:30,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Kenami Trademarked Guitar Revolution Hey, let's make a game out of this

883
01:00:41,601 --> 01:00:41,821
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gamer

884
01:01:06,055 --> 01:01:07,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a question I was just wondering.

885
01:01:07,775 --> 01:01:08,755
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the gamer.

886
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:10,416
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

887
01:01:10,596 --> 01:01:11,456
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the gamer.

888
01:01:11,616 --> 01:01:14,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And every time we talk about gaming news, it's about this guy.

889
01:01:17,577 --> 01:01:18,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to, sorry.

890
01:01:18,477 --> 01:01:20,798
[SPEAKER_05]: A million Margaret Cho quotes are going through my head now.

891
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:22,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's keep it moving.

892
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:23,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's this parade?

893
01:01:23,718 --> 01:01:24,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's keep it moving.

894
01:01:25,278 --> 01:01:27,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Since you guys live in California, do you ever go to the Price is Right?

895
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:28,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob?

896
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:29,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been one time.

897
01:01:29,939 --> 01:01:30,239
[SPEAKER_11]: I have.

898
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:30,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I went once.

899
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:32,640
[SPEAKER_11]: You sat by Dude, right?

900
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:33,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it was in April.

901
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,640
[SPEAKER_11]: I got you on TV.

902
01:01:35,547 --> 01:01:40,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It was April of 2002, and I was in L.A.

903
01:01:40,529 --> 01:01:41,810
[SPEAKER_11]: for Coachella that year.

904
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:43,270
[SPEAKER_11]: This has nothing to do with gaming, but I don't care.

905
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:44,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I was in L.A.

906
01:01:44,071 --> 01:01:48,152
[SPEAKER_11]: for Coachella that year, because I went, and we decided we would go by The Price is Right.

907
01:01:48,192 --> 01:01:49,073
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, hell, why not?

908
01:01:49,413 --> 01:01:53,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we actually got to go to two tapings, because a big group had canceled for the second taping.

909
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:54,375
[SPEAKER_11]: They do two tapings on Monday.

910
01:01:54,895 --> 01:01:59,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And for the second taping, I got to sit right behind Rod Roddy, because this was about a year before he passed away.

911
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:02,398
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was sparkling in my face, and everything sparkles.

912
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:04,358
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

913
01:02:04,598 --> 01:02:06,819
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I could see on Rod Roddy's platform?

914
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:08,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Tax forms.

915
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:09,739
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's on those tax forms?

916
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,940
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the prices of all the prizes.

917
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:22,882
[SPEAKER_11]: So all you had to do was look at that, and if they called me up on stage, which they didn't because I'm boring, I guess, then I would have won the Showcase Showdown.

918
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:29,443
[SPEAKER_11]: And I kind of would have been cheating, but at the same time, I don't think I would have felt bad about it because I would have had a new car.

919
01:02:30,724 --> 01:02:32,324
[SPEAKER_05]: That you have to pay taxes on.

920
01:02:33,348 --> 01:02:37,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have sold the... There's always some crap prize in the Showcase Showdown.

921
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:43,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have sold like the, you know... I don't even fucking have room for a dinette set in the house, okay?

922
01:02:43,074 --> 01:02:45,195
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have sold that shit to pay the taxes on the car.

923
01:02:45,856 --> 01:02:49,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm saying... I just think it's kind of funny that you win all these prizes and you have to pay taxes for them.

924
01:02:50,499 --> 01:02:55,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, our friend Mel won on... That's right.

925
01:02:55,502 --> 01:02:56,122
[SPEAKER_05]: On Wheel of Fortune.

926
01:02:56,142 --> 01:02:56,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Wheel of Fortune.

927
01:02:57,243 --> 01:02:58,364
[SPEAKER_11]: We should go on a game show.

928
01:02:58,384 --> 01:02:59,504
[SPEAKER_11]: We should all go on a game show.

929
01:02:59,945 --> 01:03:00,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Survivor.

930
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:01,527
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

931
01:03:01,947 --> 01:03:02,167
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

932
01:03:02,187 --> 01:03:03,448
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how much weight I'd lose?

933
01:03:03,528 --> 01:03:03,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyway.

934
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:08,489
[SPEAKER_05]: But the rest of this email, basically he didn't leave a voicemail, because he didn't want to pay for it.

935
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:10,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

936
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:11,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

937
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:18,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the games have gotten easier, because back in the 80s, there were arcade games like Pac-Man, Centipede, and this command where there was no storyline to it.

938
01:03:18,872 --> 01:03:24,054
[SPEAKER_05]: All it was was basically the same level, except the enemies moved faster and less time to do stuff, and that made it harder.

939
01:03:24,954 --> 01:03:27,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the old games, since it is harder, your most...

940
01:03:27,952 --> 01:03:33,413
[SPEAKER_05]: You are mostly going to get a game over and a game over meant that you had to start from the beginning.

941
01:03:33,933 --> 01:03:39,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Now once you get past a certain point in the game, it would save, so you'd have to start from the beginning.

942
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:40,955
[SPEAKER_05]: This is repeating sort of.

943
01:03:41,815 --> 01:03:44,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Some games now start to get boring after a while of playing it.

944
01:03:44,836 --> 01:03:46,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember one game on my dad's Atari 2600.

945
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:50,577
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me so sad to hear my dad's Atari 2600.

946
01:03:53,148 --> 01:03:53,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

947
01:03:53,509 --> 01:03:55,070
[SPEAKER_05]: That he had when he was a kid.

948
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:56,431
[SPEAKER_11]: That just hit me, too.

949
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, ow, that hurt.

950
01:03:57,591 --> 01:03:59,232
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a game called Grand Prix.

951
01:03:59,813 --> 01:04:03,915
[SPEAKER_05]: That was actually, I think, the Odyssey 2, I think.

952
01:04:06,097 --> 01:04:12,941
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a racing game that had the same cars in the same position, everything, and it challenged you to remember the order of the cars so you could get it perfectly.

953
01:04:13,322 --> 01:04:15,023
[SPEAKER_05]: But you had to get to the second level.

954
01:04:15,043 --> 01:04:17,164
[SPEAKER_05]: The cars completely changed position, and it was really hard.

955
01:04:17,725 --> 01:04:18,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that was Atari 2600.

956
01:04:18,885 --> 01:04:19,065
[SPEAKER_05]: That was...

957
01:04:22,048 --> 01:04:24,169
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot like RallyX too.

958
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:27,491
[SPEAKER_05]: RallyX had the, where you had to do the, oh anyway.

959
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:30,793
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, he said that he thinks games got easier.

960
01:04:31,954 --> 01:04:33,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see any punctuation, I'm sorry.

961
01:04:35,516 --> 01:04:41,400
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat, is talking about the Orange Lounge game show.

962
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:45,102
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying, you know, we shouldn't be on a game show, we should have our own damn game show.

963
01:04:45,202 --> 01:04:49,285
[SPEAKER_11]: And it looks like some folks are suggesting, like TigerClaw says, it should be kind of like Starcade.

964
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:51,689
[SPEAKER_11]: and Starcade was an awesome game show.

965
01:04:51,709 --> 01:04:52,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Starcade was cool.

966
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:56,152
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, didn't we meet one of the guys from Gameplay HD at E3?

967
01:04:56,252 --> 01:04:59,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we should send a treatment or something because that would be awesome.

968
01:04:59,335 --> 01:05:04,879
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, little tidbit about me, it's always been a secret dream of mine to be a game show host.

969
01:05:05,059 --> 01:05:07,161
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love it so much.

970
01:05:08,361 --> 01:05:10,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, you could be a Barker's Beauty or something.

971
01:05:12,144 --> 01:05:14,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I had outlined something similar to that.

972
01:05:14,566 --> 01:05:15,587
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

973
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember that was an Orange Lounge show that never happened.

974
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,436
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to talk about that.

975
01:05:20,636 --> 01:05:21,196
[SPEAKER_11]: We should do that.

976
01:05:21,216 --> 01:05:23,578
[SPEAKER_11]: I still have it.

977
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:27,681
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking off air because I bet you would really want to do something like that.

978
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:31,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

979
01:05:31,283 --> 01:05:34,225
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what happens in an Orange Lounge meeting.

980
01:05:34,245 --> 01:05:37,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Pass the beer!

981
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:39,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Live on-air staff meeting.

982
01:05:40,676 --> 01:05:43,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email comes from Tyson.

983
01:06:12,225 --> 01:06:14,086
[SPEAKER_05]: As in longer levels, more gameplay.

984
01:06:14,807 --> 01:06:16,027
[SPEAKER_02]: More games to buy.

985
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:18,969
[SPEAKER_02]: You're done with the game, you can go buy another one now.

986
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:22,751
[SPEAKER_05]: You lower the replayability, then you're ready for the next thing to come out.

987
01:06:24,332 --> 01:06:28,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, it makes... Someone left this in one of the voicemails of the week, which you'll hear in the next part of our show.

988
01:06:29,816 --> 01:06:36,520
[SPEAKER_11]: But it might have to do with level design and the cost of level design and the difficulty of level design makes it harder to do long levels.

989
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:40,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost seeing sort of, and I hate to bring back pinball in the middle of this...

990
01:06:40,885 --> 01:06:41,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

991
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:56,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, with pinball, when your only competition is yourself, you have to make your old games obsolete and make it so where you can make them obsolete so that you bring out a newer, better product.

992
01:06:57,851 --> 01:07:07,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that they actually put this limitation in some games so that they know that by the time the average player is done with this game, their next title is ready to come out.

993
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:09,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Shaoran108

994
01:07:33,715 --> 01:07:34,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Greetings, OLR crew.

995
01:07:34,995 --> 01:07:38,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Recently, you have been mentioning an Orange Launch Army on the podcast that got me thinking.

996
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:45,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I recently started a file in Disgaea Hour of Darkness and decided to name my starting non-storyline characters after members of the OLR crew.

997
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:46,740
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so cute.

998
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And some other people mentioned on the show.

999
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,361
[SPEAKER_05]: My three prinnies are named Sky, Loki, and Shane.

1000
01:07:51,802 --> 01:07:52,862
[SPEAKER_05]: My red mage is Tia.

1001
01:07:53,522 --> 01:07:55,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's spelled like Tia doesn't hurt, though.

1002
01:07:59,943 --> 01:08:21,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Blue Mage is Rice Princess, the Green Mage is Pixie Dust, I have two brawlers and DarkSakura This person is an old school OLR listener because Rice Princess has been on Orange Lounge Radio for at least a year if not more It's been ages since we've also had Pixie Dust, oh my gosh The Orange Lounge Madam Wow You sir are old school and we applaud you Tia moved to New York

1003
01:08:21,502 --> 01:08:21,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1004
01:08:22,242 --> 01:08:23,683
[SPEAKER_05]: She's not going to be on our show anymore.

1005
01:08:24,343 --> 01:08:25,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Not if we can help it.

1006
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,623
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get her on the phone at some point.

1007
01:08:28,764 --> 01:08:29,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I will chase her ass down.

1008
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:30,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I love her.

1009
01:08:30,684 --> 01:08:30,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

1010
01:08:31,184 --> 01:08:36,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, getting to the point, I intend to pick up Disgaea 2, Cursed Memories, as soon as it is released in the U.S.

1011
01:08:37,006 --> 01:08:40,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to create an Orange Lounge attack force with characters named after the LLR crew.

1012
01:08:40,267 --> 01:08:42,067
[SPEAKER_02]: August 28th, by the way.

1013
01:08:42,822 --> 01:08:57,051
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have played the first game, seeing as how I believe most of the character classes and monster classes will be brought over from the first game, I would like not only your permission to call them a faction of the OL Army, but also have opinions on what character monster classes you would like to be represented as.

1014
01:08:58,172 --> 01:08:59,573
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as I'm concerned, name away.

1015
01:09:00,153 --> 01:09:01,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Use OL Army in your game all you want.

1016
01:09:01,854 --> 01:09:02,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's rad.

1017
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:03,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Send screenshots.

1018
01:09:03,415 --> 01:09:03,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Send screenshots.

1019
01:09:04,116 --> 01:09:06,738
[SPEAKER_05]: If it involves fire, I'll take anything that involves fire.

1020
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:09,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Fire and cute.

1021
01:09:09,239 --> 01:09:10,260
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be fire and cute.

1022
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,861
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Disgaea has that one... Disgaea kind of has cute all over it.

1023
01:09:15,101 --> 01:09:15,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know what I mean?

1024
01:09:16,121 --> 01:09:18,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Fire, fuego, fiore.

1025
01:09:19,302 --> 01:09:20,162
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll have to forgive me.

1026
01:09:20,202 --> 01:09:26,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played a whole lot of Disgaea, but I remember there was like a... One of the lead characters was like a vampire girl that was kind of a smartass.

1027
01:09:27,104 --> 01:09:27,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Etna.

1028
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:28,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Etna, yeah.

1029
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:29,304
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be a vampire smartass.

1030
01:09:29,324 --> 01:09:30,264
[SPEAKER_05]: She reminds me of you.

1031
01:09:30,304 --> 01:09:31,144
[SPEAKER_11]: She reminds me of you.

1032
01:09:32,445 --> 01:09:36,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that would be... Just because I am a smartass.

1033
01:09:36,726 --> 01:09:37,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Just not a vampire.

1034
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:38,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1035
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:39,135
[SPEAKER_11]: or are you?

1036
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:40,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, do I need to get my garlic necklace?

1037
01:09:41,456 --> 01:09:42,637
[SPEAKER_01]: You invited me in.

1038
01:09:42,957 --> 01:09:47,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I tend to be drawn towards healing types, but I don't know.

1039
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I like summoners too, but I don't think, does this guy have something like that?

1040
01:09:51,342 --> 01:09:52,683
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't play enough of it.

1041
01:09:53,403 --> 01:09:54,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I like fire.

1042
01:09:54,484 --> 01:09:55,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Make me a treasure hunter.

1043
01:09:56,745 --> 01:09:57,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably has to be the thief.

1044
01:09:58,166 --> 01:09:58,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Treasure hunter.

1045
01:10:00,187 --> 01:10:00,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I like fire.

1046
01:10:00,747 --> 01:10:02,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you tell Locke's one of my favorite characters ever in a game?

1047
01:10:03,248 --> 01:10:03,769
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Locke.

1048
01:10:04,389 --> 01:10:04,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Treasure hunter.

1049
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:06,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, what would you be?

1050
01:10:07,549 --> 01:10:07,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

1051
01:10:07,949 --> 01:10:09,391
[SPEAKER_11]: He'd be a big oaf with a club.

1052
01:10:09,451 --> 01:10:09,971
[SPEAKER_11]: That's Loki.

1053
01:10:10,011 --> 01:10:10,972
[SPEAKER_11]: He'd be the brute.

1054
01:10:11,032 --> 01:10:11,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Smash Mac.

1055
01:10:12,053 --> 01:10:12,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Smash Mac.

1056
01:10:12,873 --> 01:10:13,954
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd be the Hulk.

1057
01:10:15,435 --> 01:10:18,538
[SPEAKER_11]: And Andrew would be one of those penguins that you throw and explode.

1058
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:25,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I also did get another piece of news that has nothing to do with games or anything in the mailbox.

1059
01:10:26,984 --> 01:10:28,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Weird Al's next album is going to be out September 26th.

1060
01:10:28,685 --> 01:10:28,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

1061
01:10:32,697 --> 01:11:01,427
[SPEAKER_11]: by the way I have to say this since the OL Army got brought up I love love love this on the threads have you guys seen the trading card game people are going off on like it's gone like three pages the trading card game in our forums like people coming up with these cards and man there's some like old school references back to like pre-podcast episodes of Orange Lounge Radio and stuff it's just it's nutty you guys are awesome we have such awesome listeners and even the screenshots have continued people have been submitting screenshots of like Orange Lounge references and games and like

1062
01:11:02,011 --> 01:11:03,533
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are so awesome.

1063
01:11:03,854 --> 01:11:06,337
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't even have to promote when you guys are doing that.

1064
01:11:06,377 --> 01:11:07,098
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so awesome.

1065
01:11:07,538 --> 01:11:08,700
[SPEAKER_11]: But word of mouth is where it's at.

1066
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to play more online Chromehounds since I know we have the OLR army on there.

1067
01:11:13,246 --> 01:11:18,733
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is, though, in order to play online and actually have some decent mechs, you have to play the offline version.

1068
01:11:20,931 --> 01:11:26,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously though, send us your screenshots of Orange Lounge in random games and we will do a collage for the site or something.

1069
01:11:26,714 --> 01:11:27,195
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be awesome.

1070
01:11:27,655 --> 01:11:34,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what, if everyone does it high quality enough, who knows, maybe we'll see about having an official game or something.

1071
01:11:35,259 --> 01:11:38,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Knight says, we are the Orange Lounge Radio Street team.

1072
01:11:38,501 --> 01:11:39,242
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good reference.

1073
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:40,663
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys really are doing that for us.

1074
01:11:40,743 --> 01:11:41,663
[SPEAKER_11]: We love you guys for it.

1075
01:11:42,123 --> 01:11:42,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's my thought.

1076
01:11:43,644 --> 01:11:44,365
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love this.

1077
01:11:44,405 --> 01:11:45,225
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about you guys.

1078
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:48,187
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know we have a couple industry people that listen to the show.

1079
01:11:49,904 --> 01:11:53,207
[SPEAKER_11]: How awesome would it be to be like a voice in a video game?

1080
01:11:53,467 --> 01:11:55,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Like actually voice a character for some game?

1081
01:11:55,209 --> 01:11:56,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done voice acting before.

1082
01:11:56,711 --> 01:11:58,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Not for a major game, have you?

1083
01:11:58,372 --> 01:12:00,154
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I've done voice acting for a radio drama.

1084
01:12:00,574 --> 01:12:01,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

1085
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:02,156
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.

1086
01:12:03,017 --> 01:12:05,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done a little voice acting for a fan dub and that's about it.

1087
01:12:05,799 --> 01:12:07,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1088
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:11,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, somebody was supposed to give me information about voice acting for said fan dub.

1089
01:12:11,985 --> 01:12:12,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

1090
01:12:13,719 --> 01:12:18,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, yeah, that would be awesome, but I don't know.

1091
01:12:19,365 --> 01:12:21,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I was doing a I Feel Sick the radio drama.

1092
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:24,530
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anyway.

1093
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:25,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I was the b-girl.

1094
01:12:26,012 --> 01:12:28,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Industry peeps, if you're listening, throw us a cameo.

1095
01:12:28,915 --> 01:12:29,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

1096
01:12:30,156 --> 01:12:31,077
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so that's it for the mailbag?

1097
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:32,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes it is.

1098
01:12:32,712 --> 01:12:36,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Send us email mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com because we love getting emails.

1099
01:12:37,194 --> 01:12:37,895
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys rock.

1100
01:12:38,195 --> 01:12:38,415
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1101
01:12:38,675 --> 01:12:39,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

1102
01:12:39,575 --> 01:12:54,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of fun stuff, Sony is patenting a brand new, well, I guess next gen eye toy type of device, which is not too surprising when you think about it because, I mean, it did after all have the eye of justice or eye of judgment.

1103
01:12:54,842 --> 01:12:56,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not justice.

1104
01:12:56,715 --> 01:12:57,695
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be a whole other game.

1105
01:12:58,276 --> 01:12:59,836
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have judgment.

1106
01:13:00,777 --> 01:13:16,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, in a nutshell, this whole brand new eye toy, what's supposed to be kind of neat about it is that it has technology to allow one single 2D camera to analyze objects in full 3D using some sort of patented mapping technique.

1107
01:13:16,644 --> 01:13:21,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Previously, the only way you could do this is with two cameras, but now they've

1108
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:22,726
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1109
01:13:52,113 --> 01:13:57,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Except my living room is not a white background, as seen in said test areas.

1110
01:13:58,781 --> 01:13:59,922
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

1111
01:14:00,423 --> 01:14:08,853
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the day of Martha Stewart, where everybody paints her, like has a red wall, and then a green wall, and then a beige wall, and then a puce wall.

1112
01:14:09,298 --> 01:14:12,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a red wall and I want to paint it black

1113
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:37,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray!

1114
01:14:38,113 --> 01:14:40,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have something to make people go yippy, sort of.

1115
01:14:41,616 --> 01:14:43,858
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Sony, so how excited can we be?

1116
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:50,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony Online Entertainment actually has an agreement done with Epic Games to license the Unreal Engine 3.

1117
01:14:52,866 --> 01:14:55,709
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there's a quote here from...

1118
01:14:56,638 --> 01:15:04,721
[SPEAKER_05]: via Epic's Game President Mark Raine saying, Sony Online Entertainment has a reputation for delivering detailed, truly engaging, interactive online worlds.

1119
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:09,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a great privilege for us that they're using Unreal Engine 3 to create their next generation projects.

1120
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:16,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we've also seen it licensed by THQ, BioWare, Midway, Atari, Buena Vista.

1121
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1122
01:15:19,026 --> 01:15:20,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Who hasn't licensed it at this point?

1123
01:15:21,007 --> 01:15:24,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Heck, I licensed it just yesterday to do my taxes.

1124
01:15:26,371 --> 01:15:28,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, well I better get a return on this, die!

1125
01:15:29,874 --> 01:15:30,054
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1126
01:15:30,434 --> 01:15:34,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, what a compliment to the creators there, you know, your engine's getting used everywhere.

1127
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:37,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony's just jealous everybody else had it first.

1128
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:42,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Eddie in our chatroom says, oh I should say OL Army Eddie in our chatroom says, boo Epic for supporting Sony.

1129
01:15:42,644 --> 01:15:43,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1130
01:15:43,745 --> 01:15:51,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of everyone having a piece of it, Hillary Clinton, she's, I'm not talking about Bill Clinton by the way.

1131
01:15:51,831 --> 01:15:54,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know if you phrased that exactly the way you intended.

1132
01:15:55,891 --> 01:15:58,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Hillary Clinton... We mean piece of it or full of it?

1133
01:15:59,812 --> 01:16:02,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Piece of it, you know, because everybody has fucked Bill Clinton.

1134
01:16:03,674 --> 01:16:09,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't fuck... You know what, let's just get this started.

1135
01:16:09,136 --> 01:16:10,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Games, games, please, games.

1136
01:16:10,656 --> 01:16:12,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the heat that's making everyone crazy tonight?

1137
01:16:12,737 --> 01:16:14,117
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the heat, oh my god.

1138
01:16:14,157 --> 01:16:15,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you put something in those fucking cookies?

1139
01:16:15,858 --> 01:16:18,499
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't, they're Trader Joe's cookie mix.

1140
01:16:20,339 --> 01:16:22,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Trader Joe's ganja cookie mix.

1141
01:16:23,742 --> 01:16:24,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come on!

1142
01:16:24,362 --> 01:16:25,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all natural, man!

1143
01:16:25,603 --> 01:16:33,089
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I know that you are allergic, and I am allergic, and it would be pretty funny to get Andrew all on some ganja cookies, though.

1144
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:43,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Downs Radio does not condone the use of drugs or crap, but we do endorse beer.

1145
01:16:44,137 --> 01:16:45,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, let's go back to this.

1146
01:16:47,242 --> 01:16:48,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Hillary Clinton!

1147
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:48,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Hillary!

1148
01:16:49,323 --> 01:16:51,944
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she's actually trying to... Give her some ganja cookies.

1149
01:16:53,305 --> 01:16:54,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

1150
01:16:54,126 --> 01:16:54,746
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

1151
01:16:55,046 --> 01:16:58,168
[SPEAKER_05]: She already had her batch of those when she was in law school.

1152
01:16:58,208 --> 01:17:00,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't inhale.

1153
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:07,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet she baked a batch of special brownies for her teacher and that's how she passed all her finals.

1154
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:08,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1155
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:10,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor Loki!

1156
01:17:10,781 --> 01:17:12,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I have done the X-Facts bounty trick.

1157
01:17:12,742 --> 01:17:13,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not laugh about that.

1158
01:17:13,622 --> 01:17:17,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki is usually the one that derails this show, and he looks so frustrated right now.

1159
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:22,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so, Hillary Clinton.

1160
01:17:23,128 --> 01:17:25,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookie!

1161
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:30,753
[SPEAKER_02]: She's actually kind of in the focus of a brand new scandal now.

1162
01:17:30,973 --> 01:17:39,498
[SPEAKER_02]: It's having to do with legislation that she's supposedly going to be trying to pass to impose a tax on games.

1163
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:51,593
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, basically, I don't know what the purpose of this would be, you know, and still no way to actually confirm whether this is true or not, but great!

1164
01:17:51,773 --> 01:17:52,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Taxing games!

1165
01:17:54,254 --> 01:17:55,314
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I really hate her.

1166
01:17:56,154 --> 01:17:57,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And she just gives me another reason.

1167
01:17:57,635 --> 01:17:59,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than her being an ugly skank.

1168
01:17:59,455 --> 01:18:00,456
[SPEAKER_05]: There's already a tax on them.

1169
01:18:00,496 --> 01:18:01,176
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called sales tax.

1170
01:18:02,349 --> 01:18:09,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but she wants a better tax because, you know, everybody's got to pay for the crazy people that go out and murder in the name of video games.

1171
01:18:09,732 --> 01:18:11,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess this would pay for this.

1172
01:18:11,573 --> 01:18:14,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they need to put a tax on board games.

1173
01:18:15,174 --> 01:18:17,435
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to put a tax on other computer programs.

1174
01:18:17,455 --> 01:18:18,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't give her any ideas.

1175
01:18:18,456 --> 01:18:21,097
[SPEAKER_11]: I could only support this if it was across the board.

1176
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:24,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, it's video games, movies...

1177
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:27,991
[SPEAKER_11]: and lots of forms of entertainment rather than just singling out video games.

1178
01:18:28,011 --> 01:18:29,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Because honestly, what's the difference?

1179
01:18:29,431 --> 01:18:32,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is a really stupid platform for her to be talking on anyways.

1180
01:18:32,772 --> 01:18:37,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really hate how the rumor is that they're going to be using this in the 2008 elections.

1181
01:18:37,794 --> 01:18:39,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Video game violence and that kind of crap.

1182
01:18:39,934 --> 01:18:46,816
[SPEAKER_05]: She should take a cue from her buddy Jack who got basically told to fuck off by the court.

1183
01:18:47,016 --> 01:18:47,997
[SPEAKER_07]: That was legendary.

1184
01:18:48,337 --> 01:18:49,277
[SPEAKER_05]: That was beautiful.

1185
01:18:49,597 --> 01:18:51,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, next thing you know they'll be putting a tax on cigarettes.

1186
01:18:52,278 --> 01:18:52,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait.

1187
01:18:53,109 --> 01:18:56,670
[SPEAKER_05]: He tried to do his whole friend of the court thing and the judge is like, screw you!

1188
01:18:57,490 --> 01:18:57,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Piss off!

1189
01:19:00,671 --> 01:19:01,631
[SPEAKER_05]: In a paraphrase, by the way.

1190
01:19:02,351 --> 01:19:03,231
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.

1191
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:06,232
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably thinking it.

1192
01:19:06,252 --> 01:19:22,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, one thing is, Clinton is waging a public crusade against games and apparently, a recent speech in front of the Kaiser Family Foundation, she accused modern society of performing a massive experiment on millions of children

1193
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:27,612
[SPEAKER_02]: by exposing them to games, electronic media, and omnipresent advertising.

1194
01:19:28,033 --> 01:19:37,096
[SPEAKER_02]: At the rate technology is advancing, people will be implanting chips in our children to advertise directly into their brains and tell them what kind of products to buy, Clinton warned.

1195
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:44,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, being that she's in a government position, I'm sure she realizes that also the U.S.

1196
01:19:44,198 --> 01:19:47,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Army is using those tactics with America's Army as their recruiting tool.

1197
01:19:47,799 --> 01:19:52,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know how bad I would want to just pick her brain and see where she's coming from on this?

1198
01:19:52,383 --> 01:19:55,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I want her on the show so, so bad.

1199
01:19:55,526 --> 01:19:56,507
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not even funny.

1200
01:19:56,567 --> 01:19:59,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I just want to know, why games?

1201
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:03,033
[SPEAKER_11]: What is making you tick on this whole thing, you know?

1202
01:20:03,153 --> 01:20:07,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Because her husband would rather play some Grand Theft Auto than give her Nookie, okay?

1203
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:11,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait, Loki, read that last paragraph again, the one about the chips.

1204
01:20:12,603 --> 01:20:13,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

1205
01:20:13,904 --> 01:20:23,412
[SPEAKER_02]: At the rate that technology is advancing, people will be implanting chips in our children to advertise directly into their brains and tell them what kind of products to buy.

1206
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:26,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Ladies and gentlemen, we already know this, but this bitch has gone off the deep end.

1207
01:20:27,615 --> 01:20:29,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, what the hell?

1208
01:20:30,718 --> 01:20:34,541
[SPEAKER_05]: This is making me think of that one episode of C-Lab.

1209
01:20:36,462 --> 01:20:41,544
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember C-Lab, where they went on the surface and all these people were addicted to a video game?

1210
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:42,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

1211
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:53,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, basically, this comes to us from Rocky Mountain News, and it was shared to them from a very reliable source, but very reliable and very anonymous.

1212
01:20:54,628 --> 01:20:55,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1213
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:57,809
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you looking at there?

1214
01:20:57,909 --> 01:21:04,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at the notice in order by James Brady, judge of the Middle District of Louisiana.

1215
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:10,825
[SPEAKER_05]: It is ordered that the motion for leave to file an amicus curiae brief be and is hereby denied.

1216
01:21:10,845 --> 01:21:14,067
[SPEAKER_02]: God, you can find anything on the internet.

1217
01:21:14,127 --> 01:21:15,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It's denied, bitch.

1218
01:21:16,289 --> 01:21:18,470
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in capital letters.

1219
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:22,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Notice how big, bold, and beautiful that word denied is.

1220
01:21:22,654 --> 01:21:25,636
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one page with no explanation.

1221
01:21:25,816 --> 01:21:28,158
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically the legal fuck-off.

1222
01:21:28,558 --> 01:21:29,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to post this in the chatroom.

1223
01:21:29,839 --> 01:21:33,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mean to hijack your thing, but the chatroom should see this.

1224
01:21:33,743 --> 01:21:37,344
[SPEAKER_11]: EvilCheese666 in the chatroom says, We need to mobilize the OL Army.

1225
01:21:37,385 --> 01:21:41,226
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to war to stop the evil of taxes.

1226
01:21:42,327 --> 01:21:45,988
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not anti-taxes if it's going to a good cause.

1227
01:21:46,248 --> 01:21:47,329
[SPEAKER_05]: No tax return.

1228
01:21:47,549 --> 01:21:52,351
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not for this because it's unfair.

1229
01:21:52,431 --> 01:21:58,233
[SPEAKER_11]: It's targeting one element of entertainment that seems to be the common scapegoat.

1230
01:21:59,028 --> 01:22:09,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if any of our listeners that would like, you know, who are hearing this later in the week, it's at gamepolitics.com slash images slash la-jt-denied.pdf.

1231
01:22:09,697 --> 01:22:11,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you have that for that reader.

1232
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:12,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Game Politics is a beautiful site.

1233
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Game Politics.

1234
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:16,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys are like my hero forever.

1235
01:22:17,564 --> 01:22:24,991
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, just as a friendly reminder, if you want to, you know, we at Orange Lawn Trader are all about making your, getting your,

01:22:25,464 --> 01:22:26,104

[SPEAKER_11]: Tell your friends.

1238
01:22:56,428 --> 01:22:57,428
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like we said before.

1239
01:22:57,528 --> 01:23:00,969
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a problem with what the companies are doing, buy stock.

1240
01:23:01,549 --> 01:23:03,170
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm serious.

1241
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:04,830
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't buy stock in Hillary Clinton, though.

1242
01:23:04,911 --> 01:23:05,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying the companies.

1243
01:23:06,491 --> 01:23:10,212
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have problems with what the government's doing, write your congressman.

1244
01:23:10,332 --> 01:23:21,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Send a letter in to the various different... There's also a number of different bureaus that are in charge of these various different proposals that will eventually go back in effect.

1245
01:23:22,277 --> 01:23:22,457
[SPEAKER_05]: You can...

1246
01:23:24,449 --> 01:23:27,370
[SPEAKER_05]: What, the Trade Commission, I believe it is?

1247
01:23:28,411 --> 01:23:32,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Even on an international level, there's also international, you know, the Tariff and Trade.

1248
01:23:33,853 --> 01:23:34,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob?

1249
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:36,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, something in the chat room gave me the giggles.

1250
01:23:37,594 --> 01:23:38,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead and finish, sorry.

1251
01:23:38,995 --> 01:23:39,735
[SPEAKER_11]: You derailed me.

1252
01:23:40,855 --> 01:23:43,416
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny because, where was it?

1253
01:23:43,536 --> 01:23:49,338
[SPEAKER_11]: OL Army Eddie in chat room says, Dear Snedder, I'm a registered boater.

1254
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Please stop eating cookies.

1255
01:23:54,597 --> 01:23:55,898
[SPEAKER_01]: My cookies are top notch.

1256
01:23:58,339 --> 01:24:06,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I think now's a good time to go to break and find our rails again and let it cool off a little more in here and get this heat out of here.

1257
01:24:07,485 --> 01:24:11,888
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll be back with Part B. Who knows what's to come in Part B of Orange Launch Radio.

1258
01:24:11,928 --> 01:24:13,228

[SPEAKER_11]: News on the Wii's coming.

1261
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:18,652
