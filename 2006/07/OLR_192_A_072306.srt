12
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,460
humid but it's pretty darn humid which we're not used to here this is not humid

video game news that doesn't suck uh sometimes we talk about sucky news this is actually

18
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,680
a little bit of a slow news week so we might have some news of suck tonight I don't know

19
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,140
We'll see we'll see what's on our plate, but we're gonna start off tonight's show as we always do talking about what video games

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,320
We've been playing Dark Sakura. What have you been playing my friend?

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,840
played some Animal Crossing in World of Warcraft for like an hour and

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
a lot of pinball a

23
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,460
lot of pinball

24
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,820
What machines that's just the same ones you own just the same ones

25
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:18,140
So I actually played a lot of last action hero today except it's really hot in the garage and I wanted to die

26
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,800
So I went back in and tried not to you know become a corpse since I had to do the show today

27
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,380
Gotcha, and I played with Legos last night, but you baked cookies. I made cookies amongst your you know boredom

28
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,060
So that's great and my cookies are made of awesome and win

29
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,700
And chocolate

30
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,520
You could also make you could almost make a sequel to the milkshake song out of that

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,520
My cookies are made of awesome and win. Forget it.

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Rob.

33
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Kill me. It's made of lose and fail, sorry.

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Shut up.

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Look, I have had a really strange week, okay? That's all I have to say.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Anything else then?

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Excuses, excuses.

39
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,520
I know, I always have excuses. Anything else then?

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Dark soccer with the games?

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
No.

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Alright. Loki, what have you been playing this week?

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,920
I played Crowhounds, and, well, what else did I play this week?

44
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,520
Blazing Angels, even though it sucks.

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,120
I haven't played any Blazing Angels this week, Jackass.

46
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Wow!

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Did you finally get rid of it?

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
No, not yet.

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,600
I still have to finish it, even though it sucks.

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,880
So I played more Grand Theft Auto, because that's awesome, and actually I'm going to

51
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,120
be cleaning out some of my games here pretty soon, so I do need to finish Blazing Angels,

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
because that's got to go back.

53
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,120
So um, selling back Katamari, me and my Katamari, just bored at that game.

54
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,560
But it's so cute and fun!

55
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,280
It's so cute but who cares, you know, I don't care.

56
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,080
But anyways, um, other than that, what else did I play, I think I played a little bit

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:54,620
more Ridge Racer, and, oh uh, I watched Nellie play Cloning Clyde, because I played more

58
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,620
Frogger too.

59
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,120
What's Cloning Clyde all about, because I didn't have time to really download it and

60
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
check it out.

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,120
been watching her play and you have no idea what's going on. Yeah, but I've been watching her play it from the couch

62
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,120
while I'm watching TV. So, it looks like

63
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,120
it's basically solving puzzles. You have to kill all these robots in the level

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,120
before you're allowed to exit. And they have, you know, 20 different levels or so.

65
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,120
And you basically can clone yourself as well as

66
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,120
you know, be able to transform into different things. Plus it has exploding chickens

67
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,120
that you get the kick. So, that's really fun. Well, I always wanted to play

68
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,740
game where I can kick chickens that's great exactly but um you know it's nice

69
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,300
to see that they're actually putting out some new live arcade games and I don't

70
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,420
know I was trying to get a hold of the Saints Road demo but I haven't made it

71
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,780
over to like a GameStop or something to pre-order the game yet but apparently it

72
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,620
did pop up on the German server for a little bit and some people were able to

73
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,540
nab it before it you know dropped down one of my instant message buddies said

74
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,540
he got a copy of the uh... september magazine original xbox whatever it's

75
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,420
called magazine and it's in there

76
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,560
uh... so

77
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,980
i didn't know it was out yet but i'll pick that one up instead of there you

78
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,300
go

79
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,500
orange launch radio helping you find what you need exactly

80
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,620
or anything else

81
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,100
uh... that's about it i think

82
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,460
well now i'll do my gaming week and we'll go to andrew

83
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,300
uh... my gaming week you know just a lot of the same you know world of warcraft

84
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,140
and uh... couple games of frogger here and there

85
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,720
But one new thing I did check out is that I heard through the grapevine that GameTap

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,280
went through some pretty major upgrades.

87
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,380
The GameTap service rehab is basically paying for emulation in a way, but we had one of

88
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,220
the folks on the board over there at GameTap, one of the vice presidents, a few episodes

89
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,140
ago talking about some of the new things that were going to be coming to GameTap.

90
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,480
One thing he would never give a clear answer on, but we said, GameTap needs this, GameTap

91
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,140
needs this, was multiplayer.

92
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,500
And sure enough, guess what GameTap upgraded to recently?

93
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,940
They have some limited multiplayer stuff in there now.

94
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,460
It's a little bit new, it's not perfect yet, it's not supported on all games, it's supported

95
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,300
on about 15, and some of the games they picked are really random.

96
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,580
You can kind of tell that they're sort of testing this right now because a lot of the

97
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,540
games are not two-player simultaneous games.

98
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,820
They're games like Pac-Man, which is one of the most popular multiplayer games on there

99
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,820
right now is Pac-Man.

100
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,820
You know, the way multiplayer Pac-Man works is like, I play, then you play, then I play, you know, it kind of trades off.

101
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:29,820
But they do have some same-time multiplayer games on there right now, like Joust, and I played some Joust against somebody.

102
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:37,820
And so that's pretty exciting because that means that, you know, this is probably the first step in the direction of Street Fighter II,

103
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,820
other popular two-player arcade games, you know, in the future.

104
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,620
My only complaint about the whole thing is that it was really weird setup like it was it took a minute for me to figure

105
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,380
out okay, what's the difference between

106
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:55,620
Being an orange name and clicking on instant match and being you know, it wasn't really explained very well

107
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,340
But it's new and I figure after they get some of the bugs worked out because there is some lag issues

108
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,540
But it's not as bad as I would have thought and actually I had a smoother game of joust on game tap than I did

109
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,380
On Xbox Live, maybe that's because you don't have voice going through there at the same time

110
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,720
I don't know, but I had a really smooth game of joust with somebody

111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,280
But it's just but it's a start. You know what I mean?

112
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,440
This is a really exciting upgrade because it means that game tap has that technology and is likely to move forward

113
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,680
You know with this and adding more games, you know

114
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,400
They're gonna want stuff like Street Fighter 2 puzzle fighter and some of the other great, you know, two-player games

115
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,840
They have on there. Oh, I wish they do magic sword. That would be awesome

116
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,040
They just added like Mega Man power battle one and two and hopeful. Hopefully those will be multiplayer in the future

117
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,480
You know, I'd be pretty awesome. So it's very exciting

118
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,480
I think GameTap needed something like that to justify why you should pay for it.

119
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,520
I mean, I already liked it as it is because they work with the gaming companies to make

120
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,840
sure that the games run smoothly and accurately like the originals and, you know, it's the

121
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,920
whole good karma thing.

122
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,880
But it's nice now that they are starting to get more and more away from, hey, I'm just

123
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,840
paying for emulation, but I'm getting a lot of extra crap that's pretty cool.

124
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,480
So now they have AOL, Instant Messenger built in, all this other stuff I think is really

125
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
cool.

126
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,560
So I like the direction GameTap is going.

127
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,920
The weird thing is though, I don't hear of a lot of people that are subscribed to them.

128
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
I don't know anyone else who subscribes but me.

129
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,000
I mean I run into people obviously on their multiplayer.

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,880
I hope that's not a bad sign.

131
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,420
I hope their business is doing well, but I think things like this will help.

132
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,120
And I think if they ever are able to get it working on Macs, that's going to be a huge

133
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
help too.

134
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
It'll be a huge, huge help.

135
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,740
So anyway, that was pretty much my gaming week.

136
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,660
And I do rec- you know, I've talked a lot of positive things about it, but I really

137
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,140
do recommend it and I enjoy it.

138
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
What, Logie?

139
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,500
Yeah, like, cause if they got that working on Macs, that would, you know, multiply the

140
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,060
amount of games that Mac can play by like a hundred.

141
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,060
It would!

142
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,060
It actually would!

143
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,060
It'd be pretty cool!

144
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,800
No, seriously, though, you know, you give Macs a hard time, but, okay, obviously one

145
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,260
of the things that people always say is you can't really play as many games on a Mac,

146
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,620
so having GameTab would be a pretty cool little upgrade, so, it really would.

147
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,620
Alright Andrew, how was your gaming week?

148
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,620
Not bad, I was getting in some

149
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,620
some World of Warcraft on the test servers

150
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,620
testing out the new Rogue Talent Review

151
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,620
pretty impressed by that

152
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,620
also took the time to finish up Tales of Legendia

153
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,620
an English program, still pissed off that

154
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,620
they never took the time to

155
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,620
do voice acting for the second half of the game

156
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,620
good game there Namco

157
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,620
also starting to get into

158
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,220
Wild Arms 3, which is a pretty decent RPG, recommended.

159
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,380
That's about all that I've done this week.

160
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,340
We have some folks in our chat room over at www.orangelaungerator.com, click on chat talking

161
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,900
about the whole GameTap thing, talking about it there.

162
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,200
Some love there for Joust, two player simultaneous there from VX JasonXV.

163
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,860
Yuri Lover wants to know when GameTap's going to get multiplayer Ridge Racer.

164
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
Something tells me that.

165
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
Well, they do have other...

166
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:08,100
They do have I know that joke is kind of like really old now, but they do have other Namco games on there

167
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,900
But I don't know if that would really work. They don't like PlayStation is not one of the systems. They emulate right now

168
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,640
They have dreamcast as I don't know. Maybe you're emulating dreamcast. Why not emulate Soul Calibur?

169
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,700
I my god, would that not be my god

170
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,940
Do you know how many freaking game tab subscriptions that would sell right there, but I don't know

171
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,020
Maybe it's just too much of a pain in the ass. Who knows?

172
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,980
Like I said, I'm hoping it's the start of something good

173
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:35,040
and then they're talking about a little bit about looks like Xbox Live vs. Game

174
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,500
Tap. VidPala says so Game Tap is like Xbox Live Arcade now but then RSF says

175
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,060
Game Tap and Xbox Live Arcade are different business models which is true.

176
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,620
Game Tap doesn't have achievements either and it doesn't have voice chat but at

177
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:54,180
the same time you pay one flat fee for access to 500 some odd games whereas

178
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,540
Xbox Live Arcade you're paying $5-$10 a game so it's just a different business

179
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,200
model it depends whatever you like so I think that's probably the direction game

180
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,180
tab is going in but that's not really a big surprise because you know xbox live

181
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,560
is successful who wouldn't want a little piece of that business I don't know

182
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,480
jaded2006 agrees that SoulCalibur would be awesome

183
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,820
there you go alright we're gonna go and get into some news now some gaming news

184
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,760
so Loki why don't you start us off tonight yes and what a perfect way to start us off by

185
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,320
talking about the PSP and how there's going to be yet another firmware upgrade and this

186
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,720
one's going to be 2.8 it's going to add video RSS feeds so you can download those wonderful

187
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,940
video podcasts out there as well as a bunch of other fun stuff probably security things

188
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,480
to prevent you from running homebrew and all that wonderful stuff.

189
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,880
This was also coming from Comic Con 2006 which they're kind of displaying some of the stuff

190
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,540
right now. Some of the other things that are actually happening, they were showing off

191
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,720
some of their brand new Sony Connect stuff where they're going to try to get it where

192
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,000
you can download movies to your PSP's memory stick there.

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,640
Seeing as they won't be selling UMD's much longer, it makes sense.

194
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,260
Well, you know, they were saying that there's 350 UMD movies out there and they're making

195
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
more so...

196
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,760
I think downloadable movies is a smart move right now.

197
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,420
They're going to do it, I mean...

198
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,300
not so I I don't think I will use it that much but you never know you know

199
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,280
before I travel a lot as you guys been listening to the show a while no you

200
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,620
might be kind of tempting to download a movie before I go on the plane next time

201
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,580
I don't know and one of the other things on that's coming with that firmware

202
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,500
update as well is they're going to be including a demo world tour soccer too

203
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,620
which I mean I guess if you're you know excited about that that makes the grand

204
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,860
total of demos that they put out so far to a whopping two or three I mean that's

205
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,260
pretty pathetic I mean I would think you would want to put tons of demos out

206
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,420
there so that they buy your games I do think Sony is making a bit of a mistake

207
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,140
with that but I don't know I mean maybe it's yeah you look at Xbox 360

208
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:15,020
marketplace and so so many demos some good good news though video out is

209
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,060
something that they're working on right now one thing they aren't working on

210
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,740
though is improving the text entry system on there and no plans for first

211
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,620
party keyboard so yeah that sucks so all this was announced at comic-con right

212
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,140
yeah so what was Sony doing there because it's well comic cons become

213
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,180
like almost like it's become like a nerd con hasn't it exactly it's less less of

214
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,140
comics and more of here's what's coming out movies here's what's coming out

215
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,020
comics here's just coming out toys well but games but but in a way doesn't

216
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,740
comics kind of tie into all that like comics ties into movies you know a lot

217
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,080
of the big grossing movies lately have been you know comic book based like what

218
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,500
Batman Begins was an awesome movie yeah and then you know same thing with games

219
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,980
a lot of games based off comic book franchises as well usually because of

220
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,020
the movies but you know well exactly but it's just it's become a huge nerd fest

221
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,320
so oh that's kind of neat yeah it's funny cuz I was telling my friend the

222
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,180
other day I want to go to comic-con he's like why you don't read comic books I'm

223
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:16,180
like well but there's cool stuff exactly so yeah that's something look forward to

224
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:29,180
However though, just for people that aren't in the know, if you are worried that upgrading your PSP is going to possibly ruin your chances for running homebrew stuff,

225
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:38,180
fear not, because there are plenty of things out there to help you with that, including this wonderful program called DevHook, which is out right now.

226
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:47,580
They're on version 0.45 and now that you can actually fully emulate the 2.71 firmware and

227
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,740
basically run it with all the functionality of 2.71 as well as homebrew stuff.

228
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,620
And they're also using this to load on custom firmwares as well.

229
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,300
And that on top of the mod chip that's coming out for it, I mean, how much longer are these

230
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,640
firmware updates really going to be a problem?

231
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,120
So, I don't know, it's something interesting.

232
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Hmm.

233
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Alright.

234
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,680
I'll be interested in a new upgrade, especially for the movie thing.

235
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,440
I might have to buy one movie online just to see what it's like.

236
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,200
Just to review it for you guys here on Orange Launch Radio.

237
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
We'll see.

238
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,800
Well, if I remember correctly, if I read correctly on this, at least this is the case with those,

239
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,520
how we talked about last week, how they're including a 1GB memory stick and you have

240
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,680
four movies that you can download to that.

241
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,440
the movies aren't full screen, which is really lame.

242
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,760
They're that 320 by whatever on the PSP.

243
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
A normal TV ratio.

244
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
Yeah, exactly.

245
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
That is a little bit of a bummer.

246
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
It's really lame.

247
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
So, whatever.

248
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,760
Not cool.

249
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
We'll see.

250
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,960
Well, anyway, speaking of movies, of course, last week on the show we talked about how

251
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,480
Target had gotten rid of UMDs from their shelves.

252
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,440
We're in the process of phasing that out.

253
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,120
Well, recently, United Press International spoke to the senior VP of marketing at Sony

254
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,340
Computer Entertainment.

255
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,080
His name is Peter Dial.

256
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:07,920
This is what he said basically about all this negative press it basically comes down to too many releases hmm

257
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,040
here's a quote we have seen studios cut back on releasing their full content on UMD as

258
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,660
Unlike the DVD market the PSP consumer is targeted

259
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:23,440
We are committed to helping the studios better understand our product and our consumer and will continue to educate them as we evolve and enhance

260
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
the functionality of the PSP

261
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,160
So basically it just kinda sounds like that

262
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,320
they're not saying they're done yet but

263
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,260
I don't know. Well I also think it comes down to a space issue too because those

264
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,480
UMDs can't hold a whole lot and to fit

265
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,240
you know more content on top of that it's

266
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,900
tough it's just you can't really fit it that and also they're not making a lot

267
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,840
of money on UMDs

268
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,880
so why bother you know putting exclusive content on there in the first place why

269
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,080
why even bother it's interesting though that the guy reference the whole

270
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,800
you know fact that the PSP is targeted market is we're kinda saying that when

271
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,680
the PSP first came out you saw the list at the launch movies

272
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,840
they were coming out for the PSP it was kinda like while you have a lot of very

273
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,000
you know teenage boy movies coming on PSP but that

274
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,160
I guess is the target market you're not exactly gonna sell a bunch of UMD's

275
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,240
of steel magnolias you know on PSP I would totally buy that movie

276
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,800
me too but you know we'd be the only two actually I wouldn't buy that movie

277
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,880
okay then I'd be the only one. You'd be the only one. Just to say I owned it.

278
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,680
I'm actually not really you know that huge on that movie but just to say I own it.

279
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,360
I was excited about Death Race 2000 on UMD that is

280
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,440
fucking awesome. See that movie is very targeted and the fact that the

281
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
remake is even more awesome it's

282
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,880
I'm there when that movie comes out I'm there I don't care how

283
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,880
fuck snakes on a train you know plane even fuck the knockoff snakes on a train

284
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,560
which is coming out by the way

285
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,280
um that's fantastic but Death Race 3000 is where it's all at

286
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,760
Jeremy Todd 1 has a very interesting uh point here well they have two disc DVD

287
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,280
movies

288
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,040
why not two disc UMD movies and they have the cases for two disc UMD movies

289
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,760
too I know that's true those cases are huge you can fit

290
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,440
you can probably fit four UMDs in there if you tried maybe not that many with a

291
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,600
little folding thingy

292
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,640
well yeah you don't need that many for a movie but you could well remember what

293
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,920
was it there was um

294
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,380
I think they did this with Advent Children, even,

295
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,200
where they had the soundtrack was available on there.

296
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,920
Like, you know, you can watch the movie,

297
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,900
then you can also access soundtrack stuff on there.

298
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,320
Like, you can download music tracks or something.

299
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,200
I thought that was kind of neat.

300
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,800
That's what they should be doing.

301
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,400
Now, of course, someone in our chat room

302
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,040
had to bring up Snakes on a Plane for UMD, I guess,

303
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,200
campaigning to get that released on UMD.

304
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
So you could actually watch it in a plane,

305
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,340
because you know they're not going to show that

306
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,880
as the in-flight movie.

307
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,360
That'd be funny, though.

308
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,320
That would be actually pretty funny.

309
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,520
I would fly on an airline that showed that as the in-flight movie.

310
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,320
What about, like, movies like Red Eye and stuff?

311
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,640
I bet Southwest would do something like that.

312
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,600
Because they're just sort of...

313
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,880
Southwest is too...

314
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,800
Southwest is too poor to show movies.

315
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,920
I know, but if they did show a movie...

316
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,760
Fly the Ghetto Skies.

317
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,280
But no, if they did show a movie, I bet that'd be one that they would, like, put up right away.

318
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,400
Because, oh my, they have some snarky people doing their little...

319
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,320
Okay, if the plane starts to go down, this probably won't matter because you'll be dead anyway.

320
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,960
I can't remember who is putting out snakes on a plane, but

321
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,860
Can you imagine what like the motion picture? You know how they always create a stupid theme to ride based on it?

322
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,720
We're gonna have the snakes on a plane roller coaster at some point

323
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,260
It's awful

324
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,260
moving on back to games

325
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Who needs them? Oh

326
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,720
Actually, we do. Yeah, I'd miss my games too much

327
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:48,140
I love games very much, but in any race speaking of the game that I've been stuck on for a little bit

328
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,620
world of Warcraft

329
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,940
Well, you know how you've got shamans for

330
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:01,320
You know horn and paladins on alliance. Well now they're gonna be nothing will ever change to upset that balance of the force, right?

331
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,940
Bullshit no

332
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,620
They actually are now having

333
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:14,380
Using Alliance Shamans and Horde Paladins, the new races are going to be pulling them

334
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,400
in with the whole upgrade for Burning Crusade.

335
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,420
There's going to be Blood Elf Paladins, there's going to be, I know I'm going to mispronounce

336
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,420
it, Draenai.

337
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,420
Draeno.

338
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,420
Draeno.

339
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,420
Draeno.

340
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,420
Draeno Shamans.

341
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,100
Their faces look like something you'd want to use Draeno on, actually.

342
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,660
They use the power of unclogging.

343
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,540
You know why those particular races were picked, right?

344
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,060
And I know Andrew is going to have to comment on this, he's the biggest wowhorn in the robot,

345
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,660
let me just get this out, okay, you had to have blood elves on the horde side because

346
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,540
the horde needed a pretty character, because everybody on the horde side is ugly, and you

347
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:58,580
needed the draenei people on the alliance side because the alliance needed uglies.

348
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,860
The alliance already has uglies.

349
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:08,300
I understand, but you know, it's just, you know what the fish face draenei remind me

350
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:14,540
of what that like kiko man like music video thing where they've got the fish face you know creature

351
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:23,660
not to remind me of sorry did you have more story i'm sorry yes but um if you want to know some of

352
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:28,140
the the word behind that there's actually a post on the world of warcraft forums where they're

353
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,140
giving the the background to the decision for doing all that and apparently there's a forum

354
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,860
shitstorm about it, but just talking about how A, it butchers a balance, A, it makes

355
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,300
things more balanced.

356
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,900
They are actually giving certain abilities for each class, though, that are class-specific.

357
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,840
And B, they say it's butchering lore, and it's kind of funny how most of the people

358
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,780
on the forums wouldn't give a damn about lore anyway if it beat them upside the head.

359
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,460
Would you call yourself earlier to be a lore-whore?

360
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,460
I'm a lore-whore.

361
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,980
Okay, so as the wow-whore lore-whore, the only one in this room with a level 60, what

362
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,940
What do you personally feel about this whole change?

363
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,820
I think we're going to have to wait and see, story-wise, how Metzen decides to right his

364
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,820
way into and out of this one, see if it makes sense.

365
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,340
Balance-wise though, I think it's a good change.

366
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,420
Horde has been complaining how Shamans have been really underpowered for PvE content,

367
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:25,580
raid content, how all they get to do is heal and lay down totems and don't get any kind

368
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,700
of buffs like, say, Blessings, like Paladins do.

369
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,120
And Alliance has been whining that, oh, we don't have the PvP strength because we don't

370
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
have shamans.

371
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Guess what?

372
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,560
Now you're going to have shamans and now you're going to have paladins.

373
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,040
Best of both worlds.

374
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,920
And you know, the thing is, when that expansion first hits, the servers are going to be inundated

375
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,560
with blood elf paladins and dranny, dranny, whatever.

376
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,800
That should be the quit your bitching update.

377
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,040
Blizzard does a lot of those, actually.

378
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,280
I really have two minds about that though, but I'm hoping it'll be a good thing.

379
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:04,000
I mean, I'll probably play a Blood Elf Paladin, you know, just to do, say I've done it.

380
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,480
It's making me seriously reconsider making a Blood Elf Priest and changing him to a Paladin.

381
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,300
I think everybody is thinking in the back of their mind, depending on whether they play

382
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,280
more Horde or more Alliance, which kind of character, I think most of us are Horde players,

383
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,560
you know, kind of thinking in the back of our mind what we're going to make our Blood

384
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Elf.

385
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,760
Like, everybody is going to make one of these new ones, it's just interesting to me.

386
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,560
I've already got it set from the start, but I don't want to be a squishy healer.

387
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Not on a PVP server, that's what I found out.

388
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,920
Being a priest on a PVP server is like asking for a beating.

389
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,880
Unless you have a death wish or your, for instance, specced shadow.

390
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,740
Adult faces.

391
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,360
So when's Burning Crusade coming out?

392
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Pretty soon, right?

393
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,400
Estimate release date of October, but it'll probably be closer to December.

394
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,840
Awesome.

395
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,240
Now, Final Fantasy XI, we can't have a WoW story without talking about the other MMO

396
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,040
that a lot of us have played on and off.

397
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Who gives a crap?

398
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,520
I know, I'm a little done with Final Fantasy XI, but this was exciting news, they announced

399
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,960
earlier this week that there was a sequel being made to Final Fantasy XI, and that news

400
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,680
came out about six or seven days ago, and then a few days later, no, unfortunately,

401
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,360
it looks like Squeenix put out a little statement.

402
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,920
As the company announced in May 2005, it is currently developing an online title for next-gen

403
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,440
platforms, including game consoles and PCs.

404
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,200
However, this title is being developed as a completely new MMORPG.

405
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,760
We will disclose further details of this title, including which platform it is going to be

406
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,060
on immediately after any relevant decisions are made.

407
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,740
But they didn't exactly say, we're not doing Final Fantasy XI II.

408
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,620
They're just saying, we're not going to tell you either way.

409
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,300
Final Fantasy XIII, another title!

410
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,640
Will it involve dress-up just like that other direct sequel?

411
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,260
No, seriously, I think it's going to be...

412
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,260
The dress-up was great!

413
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,660
Okay, it was a little too Charlie's Angels, though.

414
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,740
That was what made it great.

415
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,420
It was like the ultimate girl Final Fantasy.

416
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,660
Legend of Zaku in our chat room seems to think it's Front Mission Online that they're talking

417
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,660
about.

418
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
That would be awesome.

419
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,660
Personally, I think it's going to be Fantasy Earth Online.

420
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,140
They had run a couple articles about it last year, how the Enix part of Square Enix was

421
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,140
going to do Fantasy Earth.

422
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,300
Raven's Dolphin in chat has an interesting perspective.

423
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,540
Maybe it's not Final Fantasy XI Part II, he says Final Fantasy XIV the MMO.

424
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,540
Maybe?

425
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,540
God forbid.

426
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,540
Maybe?

427
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,060
They need to do one called Final Fantasy The End of Things.

428
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:30,140
They said what it was in like E3 2005 and there was a whole bunch of stuff that was

429
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,820
coming out E3 2005 that wasn't there for 2006.

430
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,620
Like I want to say it was fantasy or it was another MMO not of Final Fantasy or just...

431
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,540
Well remember how everybody thought World of Mana was a game and everybody like creamed

432
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,700
their pants because it's like, you know, oh my god, Secret of Mana Online, how awesome

433
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
would that be?

434
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,580
And then they were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, World of Mana is like all these

435
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,540
new Mana games where it's a marketing thing, not an actual game.

436
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:00,580
Well, it'll be cool, no matter what it is, I don't know.

437
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,500
Well, one other thing I just want to mention real quick, Final Fantasy XI is not without

438
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,940
any love or upgrades.

439
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,900
If you're playing the Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy XI, you may have noticed that

440
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,800
You don't get any achievement points for all those hours upon hours that you pour into

441
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
the game.

442
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,940
Well, it looks like Final Fantasy XI will be getting 32 achievements on Xbox.

443
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,040
This is thanks to Xbox.com.

444
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,100
They're all secret achievements right now, so we don't even know what they are.

445
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,340
But if it's 32 achievements, that would be about 30 to 40 points apiece.

446
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,040
The rumor is that with the next Final Fantasy XI patch, you will now be able to get achievements.

447
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,520
My question is, since I'm a dummy and I haven't canceled my account over there yet and I'm

448
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,120
still paying for it could I just log in with my character and since he's a

449
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,400
certain level and done stuff already what am I gonna unlock all these

450
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,640
achievements I mean that those are what the achievements are for yeah I don't

451
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,320
know who knows it could it could be they could be right relations you bought a

452
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,680
new expansion times 32 it could it could be interesting because they could be

453
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,920
you're right they could be things relevant to chocobo racing or things

454
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,360
that are going to be the new things that they put in father's 11 the achievements

455
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,080
may not even have anything to do with the rest of the game are you just stuff

456
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,160
like winning a game of Ballista possibly oh something that like you know you can

457
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,560
do over and over again yeah hmm well we shall soon see when the next patch goes

458
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:27,680
out to Final Fantasy 11 excellent anyways another news here speaking of

459
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,460
Xbox Live you know how they're doing this Xbox Live Wednesday's thing where

460
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,440
they're releasing brand new games coming out every Wednesday. In fact, next week we are

461
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,560
getting Galaga, which is awesome. And of course after that Street Fighter 2 and after that

462
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,440
Pac-Man. But there are going to be about 50 live arcade games by the end of the year,

463
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:57,440
which is great. And this is coming from Major Nelson. And basically, that's a lot of games.

464
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,720
And I know they were showing some new ones actually at Comic-Con, including I believe

465
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,440
as Castle Crashers, which looks fucking awesome.

466
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,960
Oh, is that the one that looked like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game style game?

467
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
That is rad.

468
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
I love those type of games.

469
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,720
We haven't had a good one like that in a long time.

470
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,360
And it's done by the same people that did Alien Hominid, which is also coming to Live

471
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
Arcade.

472
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,200
Knights of the Round, Golden Axe, all those games sound awesome.

473
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,920
Yeah, it's going to be pretty awesome.

474
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,880
I know what was it, Contra and stuff were going to be coming out as well, Contra and

475
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,320
Super Contra.

476
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,240
Just all this, Luminous Live of course.

477
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,120
So lots of good games to look up before the end of the year.

478
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,160
So at least they're going to be supporting Live Arcade for a while.

479
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,840
Alrighty.

480
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,760
One other thing that's going to be coming to Xbox Live pretty soon is a table tennis

481
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
demo.

482
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,760
Rockstar Games confirmed that a table tennis demo is on the way and this was through May

483
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,120
Major Nelson blogged, I happened to be down talking to the folks that work with Rockstar

484
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,120
and they told me it would be okay for me to mention that there is a demo on its way to

485
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,000
the marketplace for table tennis.

486
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,440
I also found out that the demo is single and two player but not live play.

487
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,440
Live play is kind of, you know, if you gave them everything, I don't know if there would

488
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,080
be much point to buying the game despite the fact that there are additional characters

489
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,320
and arenas and things like that.

490
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,220
But this will be good, you know, folks wanting to find out if they want to spend the money

491
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,540
on the game or not, even though it is, you know, next-gen budget priced.

492
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,220
Excellent, and speaking of stuff, coming in live, I think I mentioned last week, Texas

493
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,660
Hold'em, they announced it was going to be free, actually that's not the case.

494
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,540
It ends up being that they haven't decided on a price point yet, but it's definitely

495
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,180
not going to be free.

496
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:46,940
So unfortunately, you know, probably, you know, decent price, but no handouts this time,

497
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,940
unfortunately.

498
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,740
Well, and that was something we reported on last week, right?

499
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,860
Yes, it was.

500
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,740
it was going to be free.

501
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,980
That was originally the announcement, but apparently not.

502
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
Apparently they found out, hey, you know what?

503
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,900
We can make money off this, so let's do that.

504
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:08,280
All right, well, Microsoft is seeing some pretty good Xbox 360 sales.

505
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,340
Microsoft reported that the earnings for its fourth quarter, which ended June 30, 2006,

506
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:20,900
because it's a fiscal year, they got $2.3 billion in profits on revenue of $11.8 billion.

507
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:28,700
Its server and tools division was the fastest growing sector, having $3.18 billion of quarterly

508
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,700
income.

509
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:36,460
When you get to Xbox revenue, this would be Xbox and Xbox 360, this increased about $503

510
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,980
million or 129%, of course that being attributed to Xbox 360.

511
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:48,820
The home and entertainment division, unfortunately for them, had an operating loss of $414 million

512
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,060
for the quarter and they're saying that the biggest reason for this is because

513
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:59,980
they lose money on each Xbox 360 sold so kind of some interesting profits and

514
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,300
stuff from Microsoft if you like to follow that or if your own stock in

515
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Microsoft, I bet you really want to know about that information.

516
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,320
...

517
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,340
...

518
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,360
...

519
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,380
...

520
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,400
Just one moment folks, we're getting reorganized.

521
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,420
There actually is another game coming out on Xbox 360.

522
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:41,420
Actually, it's more in the realm of the unconfirmed rumor, but it's been stated that Guitar Hero

523
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,580
is coming to the Xbox 360.

524
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:50,180
Microsoft hasn't commented yet, but Red Octane is actually working on the PS2 sequel and

525
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,540
a 360 version.

526
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,380
So yeah, that's looked forward to.

527
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,380
I'm sure that's something they're probably working on.

528
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,460
I mean it makes sense, especially with live marketplace kind of set up for downloading

529
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,500
songs and that kind of thing.

530
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,380
I don't know, it's interesting.

531
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,380
What would you think?

532
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,220
Do you think that Guitar Hero would see a lot of its fan base moving over to Xbox with

533
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,140
this or is this just a way for Guitar Hero to expand its fan base or what?

534
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,140
Both?

535
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,140
Why not?

536
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,940
I mean do a version that's on the PlayStation 2 and then do another version that's on the

537
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,260
Xbox 360 with the same kind of strategy as Dance Dance Revolution.

538
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:34,340
You have games that are put out on the Xbox 360, on the Xbox, on Playstation 2, and they're

539
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,620
usually different but the same at the same time.

540
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,020
You've got the same type of gameplay but different features in each one.

541
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,680
Online play.

542
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,780
That would be a huge selling point for Xbox version, that's for sure.

543
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,780
Definitely.

544
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,620
Well, it's interesting because the story talks about Guitar Hero 2, but in DDR, yeah, the

545
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,780
are similar but they're not really the same. UltraMix offers completely

546
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,500
different types of features than you know the Xtreme and I'm assuming

547
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,740
Supernova are you know going to be offering so it's kind of I don't know

548
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,280
it's a little bit apples and oranges to me I think they could do I think it

549
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,220
would just be you know different on Xbox or should be different. Definitely and

550
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,480
including you know since we're talking about Guitar Hero here there was

551
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:24,020
actually a MySpace blog post put out by the Guitar Hero team, and it was actually entitled

552
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:31,120
Ghoul's Night Out, which teases a logo to possibly a brand new game with a skull and

553
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:38,800
cross guitars with the title Ghoul, and Ghoul looks to be an acronym for something. It's

554
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,960
interesting though, as no one really knows what exactly that means, people are suspecting

555
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,520
maybe it's like a Guitar Hero online user league or something like that or some sort

556
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:54,800
of, you know, some sort of online play or maybe even the Xbox 360 game, but of course

557
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,400
right now nothing more than a logo, nothing more than speculations, so at least they're

558
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
working on something.

559
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,960
Just trying to get the fanboys talking, basically, and it's working.

560
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Look at us.

561
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,360
Alright, well another very popular music game that actually got brought up just a second

562
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,560
ago is Dance Dance Revolution.

563
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,040
And Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix is coming out again, sort of.

564
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Here's the thing.

565
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix actually came out many years ago on the PlayStation

566
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
1.

567
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,080
It was only the second DDR game released here in the US on the console.

568
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,340
What's interesting about that now is that the whole idea is being revisited and it's

569
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,720
due to a partnership between Disney and Majesco Entertainment, because what they're doing

570
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,280
with this now is it's going to be a plug-and-play version of the game.

571
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,280
However, an early screenshot I saw floating around on the internet somewhere didn't look

572
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,160
like the DDR mix on PS1, it looked like it had some upgrades to it, it had a more max

573
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,680
kind of look to it, and it looked like it had stationary backgrounds, which for a plug

574
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,760
and play device wouldn't be too surprising, you can't put a whole lot in those things.

575
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,040
So it's very interesting, these plug and play dance pads, now Konami, you know, I've seen

576
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,920
these before, I saw the crappy 8-bit Nintendo style dance pads at the mall before, but now

577
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,520
Now Konami looks like they're gonna be endorsing these official ones and kind of a more kid

578
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,080
audience going for the DDR Disney mix.

579
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:20,360
Exactly, and speaking of wonderful plug and play DDR type things, Konami is putting out

580
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,680
Strawberry Shortcake Dance Dance Revolution.

581
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,120
Yes, you can play as Strawberry Shortcake and Dance Dance Revolution with the equally

582
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:35,600
cheesy dance pad that looks like, I don't know, basically getting any 5 year old pre-teen

583
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:42,480
girl super excited about jumping around to her favorite strawberry shortcake song, which

584
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,680
to be honest, I didn't think there was that many strawberry shortcake songs out there.

585
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,260
I didn't think there were that many either. I didn't even think strawberry shortcake was

586
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:56,820
still popular. I mean, where's My Little Pony? My Little Pony's elegant too. I thought it

587
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,160
would have been Bratz DDR if nothing else. Well, I remember those, and I don't remember

588
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,960
whatever came of this but they were talking about a DDR TV show that was

589
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,800
supposed to be on Saturday mornings or something right in between all these

590
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,120
girly shows on I don't remember if it was ABC or what it's been so long that this was

591
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,000
first announced like since E3 or something but it kind of seems like DDR

592
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,160
is definitely going after the girly girls aren't they yeah which makes some

593
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,560
of us guys go hmm hey if you're looking for something you know to give to your

594
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,800
or a five-year-old kid or a sister or whatever.

595
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,120
There you go, strawberry shortcake DDR.

596
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,720
I don't mind it.

597
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,200
I know it's tempting to roll my eyes at this

598
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,680
and go, this is stupid.

599
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,360
But you have to realize, this isn't for me.

600
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,880
This isn't for the DDR hardcore.

601
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,040
This is just to sell the DDR brand

602
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,840
and get more people talking about DDR.

603
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,560
Because look at the positives that could come from this.

604
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,440
If more parents start playing DDR with their kids,

605
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,960
then maybe the parents will want a DDR for themselves,

606
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,640
so on and so on.

607
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,300
I look at it in the same way that they

608
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,300
the Yo-Ha style one in Japan, honestly. It's the same thing.

609
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,100
Exactly. Oh, that's a good point.

610
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:08,100
This features such wonderful songs like the theme music, Straw-ba-ba-ba-berry shortcake.

611
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:15,740
So apparently, Strawberry Shortcake has a stutter. That's excellent. Straw-ba-ba-ba-ba-berry

612
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:20,220
shortcake! Yeah! Whatever.

613
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,220
Blaze Revolution says, I bought DDR Disney Mix for my sister and I played it for her.

614
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:31,020
I actually got both of them, except I didn't get the Nintendo 64 one.

615
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,780
You know, DDR Disney Mix did have something that was pretty revolutionary for DDR at the

616
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,780
time.

617
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,780
Dance Magic.

618
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,140
Dance Magic is fabulous.

619
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,860
That was the best part of the game.

620
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,240
Honestly, for the hardcore DDR fans, that was the whole reason to own it.

621
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,180
That and Electrical Parade, says VidPower, except Electrical Parade wasn't in the US

622
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,180
version.

623
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
Only in the Japanese one.

624
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,340
You had to get Disney's Rave, the Japanese version.

625
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,780
Johnny's Rave, though, did have a few better songs, I have to say.

626
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,780
It had the Macarena.

627
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,780
Eh?

628
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,780
I remember you making me play that Milpitas.

629
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:07,460
I was like, okay, Rob, pick me a song, Macarena, I hate you.

630
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,100
And then Mr. Bassman.

631
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,100
That song's awesome.

632
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,300
It is, but it's, like, slow.

633
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:17,420
I played Mr. Bassman a few weeks ago, and I nearly died because I was out of shape.

634
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,140
Jeremy Todd 1 suggests DDR Pirates of the Caribbean, the game where you have to dance

635
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:27,540
to dodge the skeletons. Hey, if DDR Disney does well, you can expect a whole bunch of

636
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,460
freaking clones of it. That's when you do a jig and the stage moves like you're on a

637
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,860
boat. Andrew, why are you making a face? You're about to swallow your bottom lip there. This

638
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:43,860
is my sad panda face. Why though? Isn't exposure for the DDR brand a good thing for the fanbase?

639
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,300
Not when it's freaking Disney. Leave it to Kingdom Hearts or something. What Kingdom

640
00:38:48,300 --> 00:39:01,020
DDR Kingdom Hearts Edition. Kingdom Hearts 3 has a DDR mode. Rewind. Rewind. I'm not

641
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,680
understanding. How is DDR Kingdom Hearts any different from DDR Disney? Because Kingdom

642
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,520
Hearts is Disney, you boob. No, I mean leave the dancing games out of Disney. Leave Disney

643
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,280
out of dancing games. Swim This Way was bad enough. The whole part was bad enough. Unfortunately,

644
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,660
it's not going to happen since there was a partnership between Konami and Buena Vista

645
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,920
to put out a ton more games. So you're going to see a lot more of these before they go

646
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,440
away. And they will never go away by the way.

647
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Hooray, hooray. Well, speaking of DDR Ohasta and things that just won't go away, every

648
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,760
week here on this program we have Dark Sakura's website of the week segment because she serves

649
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,240
the web up and down and left and right and back and forth inside and out, looking for

650
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,720
sites that you need to be visiting right now.

651
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,440
So DarkSakura, where should the kids be going in their browsers right now?

652
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:01,520
A site that illustrates something that will never go away that's called Desperate Otaku.

653
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,080
This one was brought to me by Rob.

654
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,140
Thank you, Rob.

655
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,720
I don't remember this being the site.

656
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,720
You suggested it.

657
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,480
I thought I suggested a different one, that's alright.

658
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,040
I'm doing it out of pure just thinking that it's out of it's so desperate. I suggest it was world of datecraft

659
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,800
Oh, it's a spin-off of the oh, okay Wow world of datecraft

660
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,760
The website is wow date dot full wiki comm

661
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,160
Yeah, it's a I'll spell it out

662
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:39,480
W o w dat dot f u ll w ik i.com which I will not spell if you can't spell comm go back to school

663
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:46,220
So, yeah, this site is a dating site for people on World of Warcraft.

664
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:55,000
How to meet people who may or may not be of the gender they specify, or the age they specify.

665
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,400
Is this a site for me to put up a personal ad for my WoW character, or a personal ad

666
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,820
for me?

667
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:09,460
Because I know my friend, the sick, sick woman she is, has a MySpace for her WoW character.

668
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:16,260
This is apparently real profiles and you can put your pictures and there's also the couples

669
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,260
on here too.

670
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,900
I guess looking for other couples to experiment with.

671
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,900
Excellent.

672
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,780
World of Datecraft where everybody looks like the Horde.

673
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:32,820
So you never know that that 18 year old woman from Cleveland might really be a 56 year old

674
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,580
man from Albany, Georgia.

675
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,580
Hey!

676
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,580
Hey!

677
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:46,500
stop. Woman. Alright, alright, alright. Confession, I do play a female orc warlock, okay? Exactly.

678
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,660
I will never play a male character in any MMO ever again. I will always play female

679
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:56,900
characters. You know why? Free stuff. True. Free stuff? It's sad and true. Even on the

680
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:02,300
board, free stuff. All you people are making me very ill. Slash dance for silver. Works

681
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:10,740
every time. Even bipedal cows get free stuff. I play with my co-workers and they give me

682
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,420
money. I don't like it either. I don't like that difference. Then don't do it! Take the

683
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:22,580
moral high ground! No! Free stuff, Jamie! Well, I can actually get away with cuting

684
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,660
on a game and having them give me money. Hey, if you can, shake what the Earth Mother gave

685
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,980
vidpawas says 99.9% of female night elves are guys

686
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:39,500
true true true statement because remember girls don't play on the internet

687
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,420
there are no girls on the internet yeah we're there

688
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:47,820
we're making fun of all the guys I got a question do most gamer girls

689
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,540
that you know do they like to play

690
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,580
as sexy women in games or like

691
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,960
beast I'm gonna kick your ass don't even look at me women

692
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,200
in MMOs. About equal I guess

693
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,680
I don't know. Depending on what mood you're in? When I was

694
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,800
um, shoot, what was that mecha game back in the day?

695
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,000
Back on Virtual On, my two characters were either

696
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,720
Feynn or the big bulky one with the big gun

697
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,120
because I was like, I can shoot you from over here and you can't get close to me.

698
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,720
One thing I liked about Ragnarok online when I played that is- Nobody's ugly?

699
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:29,260
No, well because everybody looks the same, but one thing you could do is you could cross dress on Ragnarok online

700
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,840
Like remember I used to have the giant bow. Yeah, I had the giant bow in my hair. That was awesome

701
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,580
I still have that picture. My rogue has a dress. I'm sorry

702
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,540
My rogue has a spare dress

703
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,240
For when the roleplay gets kind of weird

704
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:51,700
This show's starting to get a little weird and you admit this on the airway in front of several thousand downloaders

705
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,380
And you can message him at Thisis23rdman.com

706
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:03,700
Will you do a search for 21 year olds in the Sacramento area because I want to see if Andrew

707
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:08,020
comes up on uh actually will you look for some profiles in our area maybe we should respond to

708
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:17,620
one are you on here are we gonna find you not yet I will do that just for shits I will indulge you

709
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:23,740
on that I don't think it actually lets you look in area however there's a guy

710
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:29,720
I found a guy in Baton Rouge that's not bad it's a little far but it's long some

711
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,600
long-distance day you know what okay even though we're giving this crap I

712
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:40,320
found a person who looks like Tran even as in big alien from Australia even

713
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,300
though we're giving this crap a hard time you for I want to be devil's

714
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,960
advocate for a minute talking about Wow dating and all that stuff when it comes

715
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,700
to long-distance relationships, isn't WoW like a way that you could kind of, and please

716
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,960
don't take this as me saying I do this because I don't, but like, I've heard of other people

717
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,520
doing this, isn't WoW kind of a way that you could like be with somebody even though you're

718
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,580
not?

719
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,580
You know what I mean?

720
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,240
Like you can adventure and do things together with somebody in a virtual form even though

721
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,880
you're not there, really there?

722
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:18,020
you know when Dan and I first met we would just hang out on an AOL chat for

723
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,740
like ever because you know at the time that's what we had we played Gemstone

724
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:27,780
for a little while but yeah back in the day Gemstone and Slingo no I hate Slingo

725
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:35,920
okay and I played a tetranet I was a tetranet girl but yeah it's I suppose

726
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,280
it's sort of a way to at least see a part of you together with the person

727
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:48,640
you're interested in you know and online relationships can make long distance

728
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,160
easier I think but honestly nothing's gonna make up for the face-to-face

729
00:45:53,160 --> 00:46:00,040
meeting and when you start wanking to the in-game sprites that might be why

730
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,060
something you need to share I know so you're the one who's been buying out the

731
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,460
plastic covers that fries up.

732
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,060
So that was you on YouTube?

733
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,180
Oh really?

734
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,180
Under Wankmaster.

735
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:20,900
Seriously, though, online gaming can be kind of a touchy thing with relationships, especially

736
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,660
in party-based games, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy.

737
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,020
If your significant other isn't, say, pulling his or her weight, that could lead to any

738
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,180
bigger argument that you can ever have in person.

739
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,280
Interesting.

740
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,040
So you think WoW could actually cause fights?

741
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,000
It could cause a whole lot of fights.

742
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Interesting.

743
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,640
Especially if one of them happens to be a healer.

744
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,000
I'm looking through chat here.

745
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I kind of thought it would be a little...

746
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,920
You mean you could actually get married on Ragnarok on the Korean servers?

747
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,520
I thought it would be a little more lit up in chat.

748
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,520
Why do we never get this stuff?

749
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,680
Yuri Lover in chat says, when I play WoW, I get free tampons and condoms.

750
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,960
I have no idea how that works, but okay.

751
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
Hack!

752
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,440
It's gonna be in the next patch, probably.

753
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,240
That's a hell of a hack.

754
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,920
What exactly would a tampon do for you?

755
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
Plus two to stamina?

756
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,920
What exactly?

757
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,220
I still think that they should do the hat idea.

758
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:18,080
They had a Ragnarok with the poo hat and the apple of Archer.

759
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,120
Jeremy Todd One says, the wow dating service is just for nerds who can tell their friends

760
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,840
that they have a girlfriend.

761
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,760
Yeah, so?

762
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,080
I resemble that remark.

763
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,440
EvilCheese666 says ultimate wow pickup line

764
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,920
so hey baby you grind here often? Nice!

765
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,400
That one's great. I'll show you my Arcanite Reaper.

766
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,520
Oh, I didn't say that on the air.

767
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,720
What'd you say? I picked my proficiencies by the way. What's that? I picked tailoring

768
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,320
and herbalism. Fun.

769
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:55,800
So I can, you know, go get Gloomweed. YuriLover says he plays triple X wow so no, where are you going?

770
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:02,120
So you can make you can make clothes with hemp and you can I can make hemp clothes and be a hippie a

771
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,880
Hippie zombie. All right. I think we probably should go on to the next topic now. I think

772
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,880
No, no, no, well maybe later we'll come back to it later, but this is huge. I think this is huge

773
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:19,720
It's a rumor, but it's it could be huge and you know that we've been speculating for a long time that Apple

774
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,320
Apple wants to get into the gaming market and also there's been speculation out there

775
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,080
that Apple and Nintendo want to get into bed together.

776
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:33,120
So that just makes this story... actually Apple and Nintendo have been dating on World

777
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,680
of Warcraft believe it or not.

778
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:42,360
No seriously, there is a rumor going around on MacRumors and it's saying that Apple is

779
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:48,100
currently planning on making classic Nintendo games playable on the next iPod.

780
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:53,620
Now the website is not able to confirm this speculation, but you know, it does fit into

781
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,040
that whole fanboy dream, doesn't it?

782
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:02,780
Now MacRumor says that it's going to be playable with a special accessory.

783
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,000
Whatever that is.

784
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:14,160
That special accessory, trans-vibrator, special accessory is another game system.

785
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,160
What do you think, Loki?

786
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,020
I'm really curious to see what you think about this.

787
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,960
You know I need your input on this.

788
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,960
What do I think?

789
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,200
I think, well that would be disruption.

790
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,200
They're always talking about the...

791
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,320
I think it's all bullshit just because I don't think that they would want their classics

792
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,720
to be played on an iPod.

793
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,400
One, you couldn't do it on an iPod anyways because, I mean come on, the iPod is not meant

794
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,400
for gaming.

795
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,400
I mean...

796
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,300
But okay, but let's say, like, iPods have that little slot at the bottom that you usually

797
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,800
put the USB charger into.

798
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,720
I know you wouldn't know that, but they do.

799
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,240
You could easily plug a joystick in there, or like a little NES-style controller.

800
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,240
There you go, gaming system on the go. I could see it. You couldn't do it with the current setup.

801
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,240
You would have to have this attachment, but you could do it.

802
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,240
But the question is, would they want to?

803
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:58,240
Because my thought when reading this was, well, what about Virtual Console and being able to download to your DS?

804
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,240
Again, I'm speculating with that. They haven't said you'll officially be able to do that.

805
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,240
But logically, you'll be able to download some stuff to the DS, why not Virtual Console games?

806
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,240
So why would Nintendo compete with itself?

807
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,280
I would they wouldn't compute itself they would use it probably just to help

808
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,080
promote themselves I don't know I don't think

809
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,480
so you think you're 1Z2Zing it but who's gonna buy the accessory for 1Z2Z games?

810
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,120
I don't know and here's the thing too is I don't know if they would do that because

811
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,900
just because you're playing retro games on your iPod does not make you

812
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,760
wanna buy

813
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,280
you know Wii or whatever I mean it's kinda my

814
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,280
take on it is this isn't gonna sell more systems

815
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,420
or you know I don't know they're I don't know how they're gonna make money off

816
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,720
this I guess if you buy

817
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,800
you know each individual title or whatever and download it to your iPod

818
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,800
I guess I'd be kinda neat but whatever I mean

819
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,240
to be honest I don't think this is going to happen

820
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,360
chat rooms lit up on this a little bit blaze revolution says Apple is trying to

821
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,760
grow a gaming penis and isn't doing a good job of it

822
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,160
Apple does have a booth at E3 every year

823
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,520
it's little and it's in the back and you have to have an invite to get there

824
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,280
but they're there but I always kind of assumed it was for their graphics

825
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,780
type stuff that they can do for computer anyway and then let's see Mac Man says

826
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,260
they're announcing a new iPod this August well that's no surprise they they

827
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,780
need to announce a new iPod to sell them this Christmas but my thought was it's

828
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,340
gonna be the movie iPod yeah because it's already been going around they want

829
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,540
to put that in iTunes so that makes sense what do you think about this Jamie

830
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:32,180
would this make you want a game on the iPod having NES games on it yeah I'd be

831
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,820
something to do at work between the Animal Crossing no I don't play Animal

832
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:44,300
crossing at work anymore I take a nap it's true I my doctor told me to it's

833
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:51,780
true but no I would do it you know say that I'm like stuck like in line for the

834
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:57,160
bathroom at the Riptide arcade which I was standing in for 25 minutes it'd give

835
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:05,680
me something to do so yeah all right hmm okay well speaking of other portable

836
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,720
music systems, the Zune has been officially confirmed by Microsoft.

837
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:16,440
It is coming and it's actually all will be revealed soon according to them in a brand

838
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:21,560
new Billboard magazine article which is going to be talking about it and how they also plan

839
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,480
to release additional Zune branded devices.

840
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:31,440
There's also a fun little website you can go view which is comingzune.com and it has

841
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,480
a really stupid video that's on there that hopefully is not their advertising campaign

842
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,540
for this because it shows like some really ugly stick figure drawing or whatever of some

843
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,440
guy and then some little person that's humping a rabbit and I don't really know what the

844
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,320
hell that has to do with anything but whatever and so one kind of interesting thing though

845
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:58,320
they said that it will reportedly include access to digital media and wide range of

846
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:03,960
Windows-powered devices, and also they're saying that it's going to be something that

847
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:09,280
aspires to be one part MySpace, one part iTunes, and one part Xbox Live.

848
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,240
So I don't know exactly what that's supposed to mean, but they're saying that maybe after

849
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:19,920
this you're going to see probably a video player and possibly a portable games device,

850
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,480
all branded with this brand new Zune thing.

851
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,240
Does this have anything to do with gaming, though?

852
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,040
In the end, do you think anything gaming will come of this?

853
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,400
actually one thing that was interesting about that and I'm reading this a while

854
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:36,920
back is the zoom is actually gonna be fit with a processor that's a bit more

855
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:44,000
powerful than you would really need for playing music on it so it's you know

856
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,380
something comparable to maybe like a PSP or even more powerful than that which is

857
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:53,040
interesting when you think about it hmm so interesting it's it I think it's

858
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,600
interesting you brought up the whole myspace thing to myspace is interesting

859
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,600
By the way, Orange Launch Radio has a Myspace. You should add us. It's your friend today.

860
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,600
Myspace.com slash Orange Launch Radio. Thank you.

861
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,600
But Myspace is huge right now. What is it? Like the fourth

862
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:09,600
most visited site on the internet? I would think more people want a piece of Myspace.

863
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,600
I don't think competitors to Myspace work as well. Why aren't people trying to...

864
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,600
They are. Just team up with Myspace.

865
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:20,600
Well, think about this. Altair Wireless has that Myspace on-the-go type thing

866
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,600
that it actually is branded with Myspace.

867
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,040
where you, I don't know what the hell you do with that, post messages I guess

868
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,120
whatever but still though that's something that you know they can have and maybe even

869
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,760
add later on like they're gonna have you know myzoon.com

870
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,400
or something like that where you'd have your own like personal

871
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,400
web page maybe showing what you're playing on there what music you're

872
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,480
listening to when

873
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,640
you can you know go all emo on it or something and just you know let

874
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,800
everybody know. It's like you're all, I'm planning on blowing up this bus!

875
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,560
It's like oh crap he's sitting next to me! Damn!

876
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,720
So myspace is so interesting though. It's like that site

877
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:02,460
That everybody uses because they have to but nobody likes to admit they use it. You know what I mean?

878
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:08,220
I stayed after clerks to to see the myspace names on there and apparently I'm on there twice

879
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:15,220
But I it's like six rows of names going pretty fast down the screen and even though it's in alphabetical order by our last name

880
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,560
It's still fucking hard to find yourself on there

881
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,760
and the DVD it's gonna have everybody that's on there right now so that's over

882
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,480
a hundred thousand names on the TV our buddy Bobby Black Wolf's in chat right

883
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,920
now by the way he had his one-year birthday tonight for his show so

884
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:37,160
congratulations Bobby and it's all downhill from there my black wolf says

885
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:42,600
Microsoft's ad campaign my space is where the internet goes to die my zoom

886
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:50,340
is where the internet goes to live anywhere get it live live uh-huh it's

887
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:54,900
true that was it's actually that's pretty punny I'm not writing that shit

888
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:01,580
down Bobby all right are you a big myspace fan dark soccer I'm only there

889
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:05,760
because I have to be exactly that's how I feel about it friends it won't get on

890
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,660
live journal so I have to keep up with them on myspace although I did find my

891
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,620
one of my best friends from high school yeah that's that's kind of the same

892
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:16,900
reason I use it is that I found people that I would never have reconnected with

893
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:22,020
someone I didn't like his sister messaged me so yeah my brother's so

894
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:25,140
cool were you friends with him uh yeah you know the other great thing about

895
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,420
Myspace and I swear I'll get back into games I've been able to go back to my

896
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:33,220
high school graduating class and see who's gay you know because like you know

897
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,900
you can go back and really see what became of everybody like oh I knew he

898
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,080
was gay I knew she was gay I knew that you know and then you know all the

899
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,400
people that had you know 70 babies you know just everything played out exactly

900
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:52,320
turned out to be a breeder exactly anyway sorry for that randomness there

901
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,280
let's get back to games and we'll talk about Konami we love to talk about

902
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,000
Konami we talked about them for years and years and years Konami has announced

903
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,640
a partnership with mobile gaming company Tokyo pop to launch a new series of

904
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,800
of mobile games.

905
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:10,480
Now Tokyo Pop is kind of like this youth-oriented entertainment and all that stuff.

906
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,240
Now Tokyo Pop is also the number one manga company in the U.S. and they will be launching

907
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:19,420
together a series of mobile games starting with East Coast Rising.

908
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,000
This is a story that has to do with pirates and high seas adventure and that will be available

909
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
in early fall.

910
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,840
Comes a quote from Stu Levy, the CEO of Tokyo Pop.

911
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,600
We are very excited to be partnering with Konami to move to Tokyo Pop's creative juice

912
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,920
in the white-hot area of mobile gaming.

913
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,620
Our two brands both stand for an East-meets-West aesthetic that really speaks out to fans worldwide,

914
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,260
so working together is a natural fit that will truly push the envelope.

915
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,260
It should be interesting to see where that partnership goes.

916
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:50,460
I like the way that CEO of Tokyo Pop talks, by the way.

917
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,820
Creative juice into the white-hot area of mobile gaming.

918
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:57,140
There's something X-rated about that.

919
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,820
Speaking of X-rated, we have to delete those porn emails from our mailbag every week to

920
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:06,800
to find your emails because we love to hear from you guys and all you have to do is drop

921
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,820
us a line at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com and DarkSakura gets your emails and she picks

922
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:16,240
her favorites to read on the air, which she's going to do right now, right Jamie?

923
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:23,720
That's right, Rob.

924
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:30,800
My first email actually has to do with something that my husband's been ogling over but I'd

925
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:38,060
like to thank our dear friend Rob with two B's for mentioning it to me stern

926
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:42,680
basically the only company that's still making pinball machines has a pirate to

927
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,100
the Caribbean pinball machine and I saw pictures of it last night it actually

928
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:52,580
looks pretty darn cool it has a sinking ship and a treasure chest and all kinds

929
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:59,240
of cool stuff that pops up but it's actually around $4,000 right now so yeah

930
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:05,380
We've been sort of debating to can we justify the expense of a $4,000 pinball machine? Yeah, let's do it

931
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:11,500
I don't know but um, but anyway, yeah post a bit of a of an article on here that said

932
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,500
that

933
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,860
To quote on here Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is the perfect title and theme for a pinball said factory honcho

934
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:24,340
Gary Stern it lends itself to lots of mechanical action pinball shots and toys for casual players

935
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:29,740
yet the story cries for deep rules to challenge the best of players and from

936
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:34,000
what I've heard from other pinball geeks like me and my hubby it's supposed to be

937
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,760
pretty hardcore so got another email we got one a short one from a Krispy

938
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:46,360
Creamy who's one of our chat room people too said hey guys I just got guitar hero

939
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,040
for my birthday and it totally rocks but I would also like to try out the new

940
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:54,080
guitar freaks game new because my guitar freaks controller broke is it possible

941
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:58,800
to use a guitar hero controller on guitar freaks the answer is yes it is

942
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,200
yes oh I didn't know that I would I would have said no but I haven't tried

943
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,100
we actually and actually the guitar freaks controller works on guitar hero

944
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:11,160
two only barely hmm you have to configure it but we were trying to do

945
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,720
two players I thought they did experiments that showed that wasn't true

946
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:20,280
I had no oh it's barely compatible but it is huh I'll be damned yeah the new

947
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,600
I remember how we talked about the, oh maybe you, it was one of the shows where you weren't

948
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:32,960
here, Konami trademarked Guitar Revolution, okay I couldn't remember, that was a big thing,

949
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,960
I know but.

950
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,760
Well you do remember Red Octane made those generic third party guitars in the first place,

951
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,600
four guitar freaks in there like, hey let's make a game out of this.

952
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,920
Whose idea was it, harmonics or Red Octane?

953
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,200
No Red Octane had those controllers out since Guitar Freaks has been out like originally.

954
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,920
Those controllers didn't have a whammy bar.

955
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:55,480
oh my god well that was so brand new okay that's a huge part of Guitar Hero

956
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,440
but they did actually get the licensing from Gibson which I thought was cool so

957
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,280
you can actually get that they need to do a flying V controller then I'll be

958
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:07,400
happy um we got one from the gamer here's a question I was just wondering

959
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:12,340
he's the gamer that's it there's that's it he's the gamer and every time we

960
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:19,640
talk about gaming news it's about this guy I had to million Margaret Cho quotes

961
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:25,400
going through my head now. Let's keep it moving. Where's this parade? Let's keep it moving.

962
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,000
Since you guys live in California, do you ever go to the Price is Right, Rob? I've been

963
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,240
one time. I have. I went once. You sat by dude, right? Yes, it was in April. I got you

964
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:42,320
on TV. It was April of 2002, and I was in LA for Coachella that year. This has nothing

965
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,360
to do with gaming, but I don't care. I was in LA for Coachella that year because I went

966
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,240
And we decided we would go by the price is right, you know, hell, why not?

967
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,920
Well, we actually got to go to two tapings because a big group had canceled for the second

968
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:53,920
taping.

969
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,020
They do two tapings on Monday.

970
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:58,560
And for the second taping, I got to sit right behind Rod Roddy because this was about a

971
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,080
year before he passed away.

972
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,900
And it was sparkling in my face and everything, it sparkles.

973
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,660
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

974
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,780
You know what I could see on Rod Roddy's platform?

975
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:08,780
Tax forms.

976
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:10,720
You know what's on those tax forms?

977
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,340
All of the prices of all the prizes.

978
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:17,180
So all you had to do was look at that and if they called me up on stage, which they

979
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:23,100
didn't because I'm boring I guess, then I would have won the Showcase Showdown.

980
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,540
And I kind of would have been cheating, but at the same time I don't think I would have

981
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,540
felt bad about it.

982
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,540
Because I would have had a new car.

983
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:33,260
That you have to pay taxes on.

984
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:37,460
I would have sold the...there's always some crap prize in the Showcase Showdown.

985
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:43,020
I would have sold the...I don't even fucking have room for a dinette set in the house.

986
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,140
I would have sold that shit to pay the taxes on the car

987
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,940
Well, I'm saying I just think it's kind of funny that you win all these prizes and you have to pay taxes for him

988
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,900
Well, you know

989
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,900
our friend Mel one on

990
01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:00,460
That's right wheel of fortune real fortune. We should go on a game show. We should all go on a game show like survivor

991
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:08,460
No, how much weight I'd lose our anyway, but the rest of this email basically didn't leave a voicemail because he didn't want to pay for

992
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,420
it

993
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:13,860
Fair enough. Okay. Um, I think the games have gotten easier because back in the 80s

994
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:18,780
There were arcade games like Pac-Man centipede of this command where there was no storyline to it

995
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:24,020
All it was was basically the same level except the enemies moved faster and less time to do stuff and that made it harder

996
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,800
Also the old game since it is harder

997
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:32,280
You're most you are mostly going to get a game over and a game over minute

998
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:36,160
You had to start from the beginning now once you get past a certain point in the game

999
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,160
just it would save so you'd have to start from the beginning and this is

1000
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,120
repeating sort of um some games now start to get boring after a while

1001
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:49,380
playing it I remember one game on my dad's Atari 2600 it makes me so sad to

1002
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:55,960
hear my dad's Atari 7600 and oh wow that he had when he was a kid that just hit

1003
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:00,560
me too oh wow that hurt there was a game called Grand Prix that was actually I

1004
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,880
I think the Odyssey 2 I think

1005
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,320
It was a racing game that had the same cars in the same position

1006
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,840
Everything and it challenged you to remember the order of the cars you could get it perfectly

1007
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:18,000
But you had to get to the second level the cars completely changed position. It was really hard. Oh, yeah

1008
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,480
That was Atari 2600. That was a lot like a

1009
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,500
Rally X to rally X had the where you had to do anyway

1010
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,900
But yeah, he said that he thinks games got easier.

1011
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,100
I don't see any punctuation, I'm sorry.

1012
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,940
You know, our chat room over at orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat, is

1013
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,540
talking about the Orange Lounge game show.

1014
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:44,620
They're saying, you know, we shouldn't be on a game show, we should have our own damn

1015
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:45,400
game show. And

1016
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,560
it looks like some folks are suggesting, like Tigerclaw says, it should be kinda

1017
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,420
like Starcade.

1018
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:52,620
And Starcade was an awesome game show. Starcade was cool.

1019
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:56,820
You know, didn't we meet one of the guys from Gameplay HD at E3? Maybe we should

1020
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:00,600
send a treatment or something because that would be awesome you know little

1021
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,180
little little tidbit about me it's always been a secret dream of mine to be

1022
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:07,620
a game show host I would I would love it so much

1023
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:13,340
Loki you could be a Barker's Beauty or something what I had outlined something

1024
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:18,140
similar to that that's right I remember that was a orange lounge show that never

1025
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:22,700
happened we need to talk about that we should do that I still have it you know

1026
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:27,700
We're talking off air because I bet would really want to do something like that.

1027
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:28,700
Okay.

1028
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:29,700
Okay.

1029
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:30,700
Okay.

1030
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:31,700
Ooh!

1031
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,700
I think this is what happens in an Orange Lounge meeting.

1032
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,700
Gas is a beer!

1033
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,700
Live on air staff meeting.

1034
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,700
Okay, anyway.

1035
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,700
Next email comes from Tyson.

1036
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,700
He says, I'm a console gamer.

1037
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:49,700
I have two TVs, two Xboxes, two Nintendo 64s, a PlayStation 2, and a PSP.

1038
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,700
I've been playing a lot of Nintendo 64 games lately, and I realize they take longer to beat.

1039
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,700
For example, my friend lent me a Banjo-Tooie and Zelda.

1040
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:04,700
I also own Mario. In the past two months, I have only beaten Zelda, and I am halfway done with Banjo-Tooie and Mario.

1041
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:07,700
I usually beat Xbox or PS2 games in a week.

1042
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:11,700
Why do you think newer consoles don't follow suit?

1043
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,700
As in, longer levels, more gameplay.

1044
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,700
More games to buy.

1045
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,700
You're done with the game, you can go buy another one now.

1046
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,540
now you lower the replayability then you're ready for the next thing to come

1047
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:27,180
out honestly and that's someone left this on one of the voicemails of the

1048
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:30,560
week which you'll hear in the next part of our show but it might have to do a

1049
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,580
level design and the cost of level design and the you know difficulty of

1050
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:38,340
level design makes it harder to do long levels I'm almost saying sort of and I

1051
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:43,260
hate to bring back pinball in the middle of this but why not but um well you know

1052
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:48,100
I'm with pinball when your only competition is yourself you have to make

1053
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:55,000
your old games obsolete and make it so where you can make them obsolete so that

1054
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,860
you bring out a newer better product so I think that they actually put this

1055
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:04,540
limitation in some games so that they know that by the time the average player

1056
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:09,800
is done with this game their next title is ready to come out it's kind of shady

1057
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,260
but sadly I wouldn't disagree that some folks are doing that I don't think

1058
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:16,380
everyone does but some folks but even nowadays they're kind of going on a

1059
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:20,620
trend anyways, not necessarily just so you go buy another title, but so you buy the add-on

1060
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,220
content that they add later on in episodic form.

1061
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:25,820
Yeah, I was gonna say, isn't this what episodic gaming's all about?

1062
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,820
Yeah.

1063
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:27,820
Sort of.

1064
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:35,580
Our last one comes from, uh, uh, xiaoran108, greetings, O.L.R. crew, recently you've been

1065
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:39,740
mentioning an Orange Lounge army on the podcast that got me thinking, I recently started a

1066
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:44,180
file in Disgaea Hour of Darkness and decided to name my starting non-storyline characters

1067
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:46,180
after members of the O.L.R. crew.

1068
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:49,360
So cute. And some other people mentioned on the show. My three, uh,

1069
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,960
printies are named Skyloki and Shane. My red mage is Tia.

1070
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,160
And it's spelled like Tia does on her, on her,

1071
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:01,640
MySpace. Yeah, he probably got it off the MySpace. Blue mage is Rice Princess. The green mage is

1072
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,520
Pixie Dust. I have two brawlers and a dark saccharide next to her. Okay, this person is an

1073
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,520
old-school OLL listener, because Rice Princess hasn't even been on

1074
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:12,120
Orange Lounge Radio in probably at least a year, if not more. It's been ages since,

1075
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,840
um, we've also had the- Pixie Dust, oh my gosh, yeah. The Orange Lounge Madam.

1076
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:20,120
Wow. You sir are old school and we applaud you.

1077
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,720
Tia moved to New York. Yeah. She's not going to be on our show anymore.

1078
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,680
Not if we can help it. We'll get her on the phone at some point.

1079
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:31,000
I will chase her ass down. I love her. Anyway.

1080
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,240
Anyway, getting to the point, I intend to pick up Disgaea 2 Cursed Memories as soon

1081
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,000
as it is released

1082
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,560
in the US, and would like to create an Orange Lounge attack before the character is named after the

1083
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,400
LLR crew.

1084
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,080
August 28th, by the way. If you have played the first game,

1085
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,080
Seeing as how I believe most of the character classes and monster classes will be brought

1086
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,820
over from the first game, I would like not only your permission to call them a faction

1087
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:56,080
of the O.L. Army, but also have opinions on what character monster classes you would like

1088
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,160
to be represented as.

1089
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,200
As far as I'm concerned, name a way.

1090
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,800
Use O.L. Army in your game all you want.

1091
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,800
I think that's rad.

1092
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,800
Send screenshots.

1093
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,800
Send screenshots.

1094
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,680
If it involves fire, I'll take anything that involves fire.

1095
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,680
I tend to go...

1096
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,680
Fire and cute.

1097
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,040
It has to be fire and cute.

1098
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,300
You know Disgaea has that one, Disgaea kind of has cute all over it.

1099
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,300
You know what I mean?

1100
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,300
Fire.

1101
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,300
Fuego.

1102
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,300
Fiore.

1103
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:22,860
You'll have to forgive me, I haven't played a whole lot of Disgaea, but I remember one

1104
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,740
of the lead characters was a vampire girl that was kind of a smart-ass.

1105
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:26,740
Etna?

1106
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,740
Yeah.

1107
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:28,740
I'd be a vampire smart-ass.

1108
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,340
She reminds me of you.

1109
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:33,380
She reminds me of you.

1110
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:34,380
That would be a...

1111
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,820
That's because I am a smart-ass.

1112
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:37,820
Just not a vampire.

1113
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:38,820
Or are you?

1114
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,820
Are you oh do I need to get my garlic necklace?

1115
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:47,700
Anyway, you invited me in I tend to be drawn. I tend to be drawn towards healing types, but I don't know

1116
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:52,260
I like summoners too, but I don't think does this guy have something like that. I don't I didn't play enough of it

1117
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:55,220
So I like fire make me a treasure hunter

1118
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,640
But it has to be the thief treasure hunter

1119
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,760
I like fire and you tell locks one of my favorite characters ever in a game love lock treasure hunter

1120
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,760
Loki, what would you be?

1121
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,760
I don't care.

1122
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,760
He'd be a big oaf with a club, that's Loki.

1123
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:10,760
He'd be the brute.

1124
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,760
Smash Mac, Smash Mac.

1125
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,760
He'd be the Hulk.

1126
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,760
And Andrew would be one of those penguins that you throw and explode.

1127
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:25,760
I also did get another piece of news that has nothing to do with games or anything in the mailbox.

1128
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,760
Weird Al's next album is going to be out September 26th.

1129
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,760
Ooh.

1130
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,760
Sweet.

1131
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:35,200
By the way, I have to say this since the O.L. Army got brought up.

1132
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:39,140
I love, love, love this on the threads. Have you guys seen the trading card game?

1133
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:44,360
People are going off. It's gone like three pages, the trading card game in

1134
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,520
our forums, like people coming up with these cards

1135
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:51,160
and man there's some like old-school references back to like pre-podcast

1136
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,400
episodes of Orange Lounge Radio and stuff.

1137
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,760
It's nutty. You guys are awesome. We have such awesome listeners and even

1138
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,920
the screenshots have continued. People have been submitting screenshots of like Orange

1139
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,540
lounge references in games and like, you guys are so awesome, like, we don't even have to

1140
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:08,640
promote when you guys are doing that, it's so awesome, but word of mouth is where it's

1141
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,640
at, so you guys are doing us a huge favor.

1142
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,280
I've been trying to play more online ChromeHounds, since I know we have the OLR army on there.

1143
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,920
The problem is though, in order to play online, you know, and actually have some decent mechs,

1144
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:21,200
you have to play the offline version, and uh, yeah, whatever.

1145
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,760
Seriously though, send us your screenshots of orange lounge in random games and we will

1146
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,360
like do a collage for the site or something, it'll be awesome.

1147
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:31,880
You know, I'll tell you what, if everyone does it high quality enough, who knows, maybe

1148
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,420
we'll see about having an official game or something.

1149
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,600
Dark Knight says, we are the Orange Lounge Radio Street Team.

1150
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
That's a good reference.

1151
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,960
You guys really are doing that for us.

1152
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,200
We love you guys for it.

1153
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,280
Here's my thought.

1154
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,280
I would love this.

1155
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,320
I don't know about you guys.

1156
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,940
And I know we have a couple industry people that listen to the show.

1157
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:53,560
How awesome would it be to be like a voice in a video game?

1158
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,320
Like actually voice a character for some game?

1159
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,780
I've been voice acting before.

1160
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,300
Not for a major game, have you?

1161
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,420
No, but I've done voice acting for a radio drama.

1162
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,420
Oh, okay.

1163
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,420
That's cool.

1164
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:06,060
I've done a little voice acting for a fandub, and that's about it.

1165
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,060
Okay.

1166
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:11,420
Yeah, somebody was supposed to give me information about voice acting for said fandub.

1167
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,420
Okay, okay.

1168
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,420
I'll give it to you.

1169
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:15,420
Oh, sheesh.

1170
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:19,260
Yeah, that would be awesome, but I don't know.

1171
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:22,100
I was doing I Feel Sick, the radio drama.

1172
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,460
All right, anyway.

1173
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,020
I was the B-girl.

1174
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:28,820
Industry peeps, if you're listening, throw us a cameo.

1175
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:29,820
Seriously.

1176
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,820
Alright, so that's it for the mailbag?

1177
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:32,820
Yes it is.

1178
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:37,260
Send us email mailbag at orangeloungerator.com because we love getting emails.

1179
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,260
You guys rock.

1180
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:39,260
Alright, excellent.

1181
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:47,100
Well, speaking of fun stuff, Sony is patenting a brand new, well I guess next gen iToy type

1182
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,100
of device.

1183
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,740
Which is not too surprising when you think about it because I mean it did after all have

1184
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:57,740
the Eye of Justice, or Eye of Judgment. Yeah, not Justice. That'd be a whole other game.

1185
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:05,380
But Eye of Judgment. Basically, in a nutshell, this whole brand new eye toy, what's supposed

1186
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:10,740
to be kind of neat about it, is that it has technology that allows one single 2D camera

1187
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:17,180
to analyze objects in full 3D using some sort of patented mapping technique. Previously,

1188
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:20,960
The only way you could do this is with two cameras.

1189
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,620
But now they've basically found a way to do that.

1190
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,480
So great!

1191
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,020
That's awesome that they're doing that.

1192
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:30,240
Still the Eye of Judgment sucks ass.

1193
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,380
And that's just because the game sucks and is really unfeasible.

1194
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:37,660
But nice to see that they are releasing some new itoy games.

1195
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:41,340
Hopefully they won't suck as bad as all the other itoy games in existence.

1196
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,500
Oh you know they can't make a good itoy game.

1197
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,460
Well here's the problem with the eye toy. It's just that in their perfect world an eye

1198
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:54,900
toy would work fine against a white background. Except my living room is not a white background

1199
01:13:54,900 --> 01:14:00,540
as seen in said test areas. But I don't know.

1200
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:05,780
This is the day of like Martha Stewart where everybody paints her like has a red wall and

1201
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:09,140
then a green wall and then a beige wall and then a puce wall.

1202
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:12,860
I see a red wall and I want to paint it black.

1203
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:18,220
Anyways, well I think the problem is though is like these itoy games you want to play

1204
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:22,060
them in like kind of a party environment and when you have people you know drunkenly moving

1205
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,240
around in the background, it kind of interferes with the game.

1206
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,840
So I guess that's kind of neat that they're going to be doing this.

1207
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,020
Hopefully though they fix a few of the problems that were with the original itoy.

1208
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,020
So yippee.

1209
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,020
Hooray!

1210
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:41,700
Well I have something to make people go yippee, sort of.

1211
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,820
Sony, so how excited can we be?

1212
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:47,140
Sony Online Entertainment actually

1213
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:49,420
has an agreement done with Epic Games

1214
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,700
to license the Unreal Engine 3.

1215
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:58,180
So there's a quote here from the Epic's game president, Mark

1216
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:00,340
Raine, saying, Sony Online Entertainment

1217
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:03,380
has a reputation for delivering detailed, truly engaging

1218
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,780
interactive online worlds.

1219
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:06,580
It is a great privilege for us that they're

1220
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:11,340
using Unreal Engine 3 to create their next generation projects.

1221
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:16,500
Of course, we've also seen it licensed by THQ, Bioware, Midway, Atari, Buena Vista.

1222
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,860
Yeah... Who hasn't licensed it at this point?

1223
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:24,420
Heck, I licensed it just yesterday to do my taxes.

1224
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:28,380
Oh yeah? Well, I better get a return on this.

1225
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:33,660
Die! No. Oh, what a compliment to the creators there, you know? Your engine's getting

1226
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:34,500
used everywhere.

1227
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:38,860
Sony's just jealous everybody else had it first. Eddie in our chat room says, oh, I

1228
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:41,920
should say OL Army yet he said in our chat room says boo epic for supporting

1229
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:47,400
Sony seriously speaking of everyone having a piece of it Hillary Clinton

1230
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:52,720
she's and I'm not talking about Bill Clinton by the way yeah I don't know if

1231
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:57,840
you phrase that exactly the way you intended anyways Hillary Clinton piece

1232
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:03,040
of it or full of it piece of it you know cuz everybody is fucked Bill Clinton I

1233
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,280
I didn't fuck but you know what? Let's just let's get this

1234
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:13,880
Please games. Okay speaking of what is it the heat that's making everyone crazy tonight heat. Oh my god

1235
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,880
Did you put something in those fucking cookies?

1236
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,920
Joe's cookie mix

1237
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,320
Trader Joe's ganja cookie

1238
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:31,640
Natural man, first of all, I know that you were allergic and I am allergic and I would be pretty funny to get Andrew

1239
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:36,940
all on some ganja cookies though we orange down's radio does not sorry

1240
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:43,040
cookies condone the use I mean you can make our crap I'd be door but we do

1241
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:48,440
endorse beer can we anyways get through party for God's sake Hillary Clinton go

1242
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:55,320
Hillary um no she's actually trying to give her some ganja cookies she already

1243
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:00,840
had her batch of those when she was in law school in hell she baked she baked

1244
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:06,520
I bet that she baked a batch of, uh, of, like, brownies, special brownies for her teacher.

1245
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,520
That's how she passed all her finals.

1246
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,520
Okay.

1247
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,520
Poor Loki.

1248
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,720
I have done the X-Racks brownie trick, do not laugh about that.

1249
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:18,400
Loki is usually the one that derails this show, and he looks so frustrated right now.

1250
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:28,720
Anyways, so, Hillary Clinton, Cookie, um, she, she's actually kind of in the focus

1251
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:35,140
sort of a brand new scandal now. It's having to do with legislation that she's supposedly

1252
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:43,640
going to be trying to pass to impose a tax on games. And, you know, basically, I don't

1253
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:48,680
know what the purpose of this would be at, you know, and still no way to actually confirm

1254
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:56,520
whether this is true or not, but great! Taxing games! God, I really hate her. And she just

1255
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,880
gives me another reason you know there's already an ugly skank there's already a

1256
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,880
tax on them it's called sales tax yeah but she wants a better tax because you

1257
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,800
know everybody's got to pay for you know the crazy people that you go out and

1258
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,660
murder in the name of video games and so I guess this would pay for this then

1259
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:17,160
they need to put a tax on board games they need to put a tax on other computer

1260
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,960
don't give her any idea I could only support this if it was across the board

1261
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:26,280
like you know it's video games movies and lots of forms of entertainment

1262
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,960
rather than just singling out video games because honestly what's the

1263
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,080
difference? Well this is a really stupid platform for her to be you know talking

1264
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:35,320
on anyways and I really hate how they're gonna you know the rumor is that they're

1265
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:39,040
gonna be using this in the 2008 elections video game violence and that

1266
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:44,960
kind of crap. She should take a cue from her you know buddy Jack who got basically

1267
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,400
told to fuck off by the court. That was legendary. That was beautiful.

1268
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,200
Seriously next thing you know they'll be putting a tax on cigarette oh wait. He

1269
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,300
tried to do his whole friend of the court thing and the judge is like screw

1270
01:18:56,300 --> 01:19:06,360
you piss off and the paraphrase by the way oh we'll see what happens so

1271
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:10,960
basically you know one thing is you know Clinton is waging a public crusade

1272
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,820
against games and apparently you know recent speech in front of the Kaiser

1273
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:20,940
Family Foundation she's a she accused modern society of performing a massive

1274
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:26,760
experiment on millions of children by exposing them to games, electronic media, and omnipresent

1275
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,080
advertising.

1276
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:32,200
At the rate technology is advancing, people will be implanting chips in our children to

1277
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:36,400
advertise directly into their brains and tell them what kind of products to buy.

1278
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,400
Clinton warned.

1279
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:43,520
Of course, being that she's in a government position, I'm sure she realizes that also

1280
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,820
the U.S. Army is using those tactics with America's Army as their recruiting tool.

1281
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:51,880
Do you know how bad I would want to just pick her brain and see where she's coming from

1282
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,880
on this?

1283
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,540
Like, I want her on the show so, so bad.

1284
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,540
It is not even funny.

1285
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:59,620
Like, I just want to know, why games?

1286
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:02,780
What is, what is, what is making you tick on this whole thing?

1287
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:03,780
You know?

1288
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:07,540
Well, my husband would rather play some Grand Theft Auto than give her Nookie, okay?

1289
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,700
Wait, wait, wait.

1290
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,540
Loki, read that last paragraph again.

1291
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,540
The one about the chips.

1292
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:19,100
At the rate that technology is advancing, people will be implanting chips in our children

1293
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:23,780
to advertise directly into their brains and tell them what kind of products to buy.

1294
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:27,420
Ladies and gentlemen, we already know this, but this bitch has gone off the deep end.

1295
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,420
Seriously, what.

1296
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:29,420
The.

1297
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:30,420
Hell.

1298
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:36,540
That's just making me think of that one episode of C-Lab.

1299
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,660
You remember C-Lab, where they went on the surface and all these people were addicted

1300
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,660
to a video game?

1301
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:42,660
Oh, God.

1302
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:49,500
Well, basically, this comes to us from Rocky Mountain News, and it was shared to them from

1303
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:54,780
a very reliable source, but very reliable and very anonymous, so interesting.

1304
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,820
What are you looking at there?

1305
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:05,140
I'm looking at the notice in order by James Brady, judge of the Middle District of Louisiana.

1306
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:10,180
It is ordered that the motion for leave to file an amicus curiae brief be, and he's hereby

1307
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,180
denied.

1308
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:15,060
What they should have added is denied

1309
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:19,700
Bitch. It's in capital letters. Notice how big

1310
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:23,540
bold and beautiful that word denied is. It's one

1311
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:26,740
page with no explanation. It's basically

1312
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:30,900
the legal fuck off. So I'm going to post this in the chat room. I didn't mean to

1313
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:35,620
hijack your thing but the chat room should see this. EvilCheese666 in chat room says

1314
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:39,660
we need to mobilize the O.L. Army. We're going to war to stop the evil of taxes.

1315
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:51,660
I'm not anti-taxes if it's going to a good cause, but I'm not for this because it's unfair.

1316
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:58,660
It's targeting one element of entertainment that seems to be the common scapegoat.

1317
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:03,820
Well, if any if any of our listeners that would like, you know who are hearing this later in in the week

1318
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:10,180
It's a game politics comm slash images slash la dash jt dash denied PDF

01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,680
Dear Snetter, I'm a registered boater.

Please stop eating cookies.

My cookies are top notch.

1342
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:02,320
I think that's a good time to go to break and find our rails

1343
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,600
again, and let it cool off a little more in here,

1344
