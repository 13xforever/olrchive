Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 193, inches closer and closer to that

00:26.840 --> 00:29.140
magic 200 number.

00:45.940 --> 00:51.500
OrangeLaunchRadio.com Sunday night when we tape our show or our rebroadcast on AllGames.com,

00:51.500 --> 00:55.820
which just moved to Monday nights at five o'clock Pacific Standard Time, eight o'clock

00:55.820 --> 00:57.700
Eastern Standard Time.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.760
And now let's get back into some gaming news.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.600
I'm going to start us off, if you guys are okay with that, Dark Soccer and Loki.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.600
I'm sorry, no.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.600
Okay, go ahead.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.400
We didn't talk a lot last segment about the Wii, so I want to bring up a story about the

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
Wii.

01:10.400 --> 01:14.000
This is a rumor going around, and I emphasize the word rumor here, that Nintendo is sending

01:14.000 --> 01:16.120
out free Wii dev kits.

01:16.120 --> 01:20.200
It's a rumor from an insider that wrote to Kotaku.com.

01:20.200 --> 01:25.400
According to Kotaku, it seems Nintendo is giving Wii development kits to smaller studios.

01:25.400 --> 01:30.940
A developer in a coastal American city apparently received a package from Nintendo, and nobody

01:30.940 --> 01:35.760
was aware it was even inside, but the box was opened, and there was a Wii dev kit inside.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.860
Now this could be seen multiple ways.

01:37.860 --> 01:44.840
This might be a way for Wii to get indie developers to make games for the console, and it certainly

01:44.840 --> 01:49.760
would show a shift in Nintendo's attitude towards third-party supporters, maybe recognizing

01:49.760 --> 01:52.100
where some of the mistakes were with the GameCube.

01:52.100 --> 01:56.540
It's kind of like, hey, we really want third parties, indies, everybody on board with this.

01:56.540 --> 02:01.380
So certainly interesting if it's true, but it may not be true.

02:01.380 --> 02:03.420
It's still a rumor at this time.

02:03.420 --> 02:04.900
Well, the dev kits weren't that expensive anyways.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.140
I think they were like grand or two.

02:07.140 --> 02:10.140
I would hope not considering the hardware is supposed to not be as, you know, much.

02:10.140 --> 02:16.500
Well, they put out a email now that has their DS lineup.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.100
Oh, cool.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.500
Here's what's coming out.

02:20.500 --> 02:27.020
There is October 9th, Clubhouse Games, Nintendo's Dalmatian version on October 16th, October

02:27.020 --> 02:32.500
23rd magical star sign, and 30th there's a Pokemon Ranger and Children of Mana, oooh

02:32.500 --> 02:34.380
Children of Mana.

02:34.380 --> 02:40.220
November 6th has Elite Beat Agents, 13th Yoshi's Island, December 4th is Custom Robo Arena

02:40.220 --> 02:43.300
and Kirby's Squeak Squad.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.900
You know what's pretty awesome about that Clubhouse Games?

02:45.900 --> 02:52.900
It's over Wi-Fi with all 48 games that are going to be in it, and, which might come into

02:52.900 --> 02:55.900
the show, PictoChat over Wi-Fi.

02:55.900 --> 02:59.100
Oh, that's right, I remember hearing about that.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.940
Isn't this game already out somewhere else?

03:00.940 --> 03:01.940
It's called something else in other countries.

03:01.940 --> 03:03.300
No, it's coming out in the UK.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.820
It's called 48 Collection or something like that.

03:05.820 --> 03:06.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.900
Because that's where, when I first read about the game, that's what it was called.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.020
Now, none of these games are nothing spectacular, right?

03:11.020 --> 03:12.020
No, it's like card games and stuff.

03:12.020 --> 03:16.440
of those, like, Hoyle collections that are available on the PC, but being able to play

03:16.440 --> 03:23.460
it over Wi-Fi with PictoChat, hooray, drawn genitalia galore while playing hearts.

03:23.460 --> 03:24.460
Strip poker.

03:24.460 --> 03:28.140
No, you can't do strip, that's for the Xbox 360 cam.

03:28.140 --> 03:33.780
Oh, come on, you can do that over PictoChat, if you're a good enough artist.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.780
You're lame.

03:35.780 --> 03:40.060
Well, we all know where games of strip poker break out.

03:40.060 --> 03:45.340
Summer camp! And Nintendo is actually holding a summer camp of their own.

03:45.340 --> 03:49.420
It's called Camp Hyrule. Now, it's not a real camp.

03:49.420 --> 03:53.120
I mean, obviously it's about video games. Come on, the idea is to stay indoors.

03:53.120 --> 03:58.300
It's a virtual camp. Now, not a lot is known about this. Camp Hyrule is going to

03:58.300 --> 03:59.540
have activities like

03:59.540 --> 04:05.220
chats, games, art activities, and other surprises, courtesy of Nintendo Power.

04:05.220 --> 04:08.580
If you want to sign up you can get a virtual cabin

04:08.580 --> 04:12.980
and you're going to share this with other gamers and I guess they'll be also like

04:12.980 --> 04:16.380
maybe a camp counselor who works for Nintendo

04:16.380 --> 04:20.540
who's... I have no idea. Nobody really knows what to expect from this thing.

04:20.540 --> 04:23.900
There's a quote here though,

04:23.900 --> 04:27.780
if you like to talk about video games, play practical jokes and rub elbows with

04:27.780 --> 04:29.260
Nintendo's expert gamers,

04:29.260 --> 04:33.020
then get ready to meet new friends at Nintendo's Camp Hyrule 2006

04:33.020 --> 04:36.300
and win prizes like t-shirts and magazines. Subscriptions

04:36.300 --> 04:41.260
while you're at it. Coming the week of August 14th through 18th, 2006,

04:41.260 --> 04:45.260
the rumored theme this year might be the Legend of Zelda, the Phantom Hourglass,

04:45.260 --> 04:49.620
Nintendo Wii, and Super Mario Galaxy. Interesting because I noticed in Dark

04:49.620 --> 04:51.620
Sakura's list of what's coming out for the DS,

04:51.620 --> 04:55.500
Phantom Hourglass wasn't even there. So, I don't know what that means.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.180
Well, there was rumors that it was going to be delayed till next year.

04:59.180 --> 05:03.540
Oh, now Blaze Revolution in chat says Camp Hyrule is nothing new, they've been doing

05:03.540 --> 05:04.540
it for at least five years.

05:04.540 --> 05:05.540
Yeah, they've been doing it for a while.

05:05.540 --> 05:06.540
Really?

05:06.540 --> 05:07.540
I've never heard of it.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.540
What do they do?

05:08.540 --> 05:09.540
I don't know.

05:09.540 --> 05:10.540
How did they miss this?

05:10.540 --> 05:11.540
We've been doing this show how long now?

05:11.540 --> 05:12.540
And I've never heard of this.

05:12.540 --> 05:13.540
Ever.

05:13.540 --> 05:18.540
Well, this is on the Nintendo site, nintendo.com, so if you don't read that site, you probably

05:18.540 --> 05:19.540
won't.

05:19.540 --> 05:22.260
Well, I do sometimes, but I don't know, alright, fine.

05:22.260 --> 05:25.980
So I've apparently been living in a cave the past ten years, so fine.

05:25.980 --> 05:27.420
Are any of you guys doing Camp Hyrule?

05:27.420 --> 05:28.420
Nope.

05:28.420 --> 05:32.900
No, I didn't sign up either. I was like investment all the time you might

05:33.360 --> 05:38.320
Somebody needs to do it. Someone has to you know what you need to go represent the oil army for us. Why not?

05:38.320 --> 05:43.140
So I'm hey, I I remember Nestor and Howard I could get on hit the damn show

05:43.300 --> 05:48.400
That's me. We need it. We need our folks. We need an OLR cabin. We need fuck it

05:48.400 --> 05:54.680
We need camp OLR. Come on, Ol army assemble. It'll be on that. You know chess board in front of your apartment complex

05:54.680 --> 06:02.680
I totally want to have a Camp-O-L-R. That would be fun. Actually, I want to do a real, like, con thing or something, but we'll see. Someday.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.680
Orange Con?

06:04.680 --> 06:10.680
Orange Con. That would be rad. Someday, when we have lots and lots of money, we'll see what happens.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.680
No.

06:12.680 --> 06:20.680
Anyways, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, but one thing that did happen is an AMD and ATI merger.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.560
merger. Thank you for your enthusiasm, by the way. Yeah, I don't think that's going

06:24.560 --> 06:32.360
to happen anytime soon. By the way, great transition. Love you, Loki. Anyways, yes,

06:32.360 --> 06:41.520
the $5.4 billion transaction took place last week with AMD purchasing ATI, and now you've

06:41.520 --> 06:48.560
got a big combination of both processors and graphics chips. Where will this lead? Who

06:48.560 --> 06:52.000
Who the fuck knows? That's where it's gonna lead.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.360
Probably gonna see some ATI, you know,

06:55.360 --> 06:57.740
based graphics chips

06:57.740 --> 07:02.320
on AMD motherboards.

07:02.320 --> 07:06.680
So this is great news though for your PC gamer, I guess, but

07:06.680 --> 07:09.520
I always used to buy AMD chips for my PCs

07:09.520 --> 07:16.520
and ATI cards, so I guess that works. Excellent.

07:16.520 --> 07:21.320
well what I'm worried about what if you're a AMD user with an Nvidia

07:21.320 --> 07:25.800
video card who then

07:25.800 --> 07:29.560
fuck you you suck! I don't know. Go buy a Mac

07:29.560 --> 07:32.720
Oh snap! Go buy a Mac!

07:32.720 --> 07:38.320
Hold on here! Let's get back on the Sandy bus!

07:38.320 --> 07:41.480
Okay listen. I get my Mac

07:41.480 --> 07:45.120
in very soon. God dammit, just when I thought we had

07:45.120 --> 07:50.240
with the hate mail for loki would stop coming in

07:50.240 --> 07:51.600
anyways

07:51.600 --> 07:55.920
how about we just turn this right around how about we turn this bus around right

07:55.920 --> 07:56.480
now

07:56.480 --> 08:00.720
we're talking we're talking about pc's and gaming that mac wouldn't be in there

08:00.720 --> 08:03.840
gee i wish somebody had a story to save us right about now

08:03.840 --> 08:10.960
you know that female otaku need love too really in japan you can rent a friend

08:10.960 --> 08:14.000
wait wait wait are they horny gamer girls

08:14.000 --> 08:20.320
yeah did you find out about this on myspace no it's on kotaku okay just as bad i'm kidding

08:21.360 --> 08:30.800
we love you they're cool five dollars no no it's actually 12 000 yen for two and a half hours of

08:30.800 --> 08:36.800
friendship wait now but this is not like a a whore thing this is no no girls for other girls

08:37.760 --> 08:42.720
this is called the secret otaku support commission they rent out women who are

08:42.720 --> 08:48.000
knowledgeable in video game culture to girl gamers who got no friends if I want

08:48.000 --> 08:56.840
to pay for friends I join a frat as it says sorry so many college memories just

08:56.840 --> 09:02.680
came back to me as it said by Seiji Hirokawa who is their creator and

09:02.680 --> 09:08.780
operator funny that it's a man this is we're an otaku dispatch agency that

09:08.780 --> 09:14.000
caters exclusively to a female clientele. Many women otaku don't have other women otaku

09:14.000 --> 09:20.760
to talk to and they get pretty lonely. That's where we come in. They charge 12,000 yen,

09:20.760 --> 09:26.760
basically 120 bucks for two and a half hours of friendship. Are you a lonely, lonely girl?

09:26.760 --> 09:33.760
Pick up the phone! Have you been a bad, lonely girl playing your video games all night long?

09:33.760 --> 09:37.160
Do you want someone to play your games with?

09:37.160 --> 09:40.640
Do you want someone to come over and have a pillow fight with you?

09:40.640 --> 09:44.720
Well Otaku, female rental service is for you!

09:44.720 --> 09:48.720
This is very... I don't know, there's just something kinda scary about it. Maybe it's just

09:48.720 --> 09:50.280
that cultural difference or whatever,

09:50.280 --> 09:53.440
but there's something almost predatory about this whole thing. I don't know.

09:53.440 --> 09:57.640
Is it just me? Jamie, would you pay for this? No, I have friends.

09:57.640 --> 10:02.600
That's true! I'd pay for that. That's right, you had a pillow fight this weekend, I forgot.

10:02.600 --> 10:11.120
Anyway, you know, I'm not too surprised that a man is selling women to, you know, clientele.

10:11.120 --> 10:14.280
I mean pimps have been around for ages, so.

10:14.280 --> 10:22.840
But what I'm really surprised about is why an Asian chick that likes games and otaku

10:22.840 --> 10:27.540
stuff can't get some nerdy guy to be her friend, I mean, come on.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.880
That's where we need to be importing them, okay?

10:29.880 --> 10:33.940
like you know there's Russian wives we need to get the Asian gamer chicks to

10:33.940 --> 10:39.480
come in import them in you know and cuz we've got the demand here they have a

10:39.480 --> 10:47.580
supply there it's perfect screw that just export me I'm done with that yes

10:47.580 --> 10:49.880
please can we look into that I'm just kidding

10:49.880 --> 11:00.880
Wow that's awesome that is excellent news I'm scared now the chat rooms got

11:00.880 --> 11:04.360
the wrong idea of me we have juiced in in our chat room I don't know how else

11:04.360 --> 11:06.800
to pronounce I think it's just Justin but it's an elite speak it looks like

11:06.800 --> 11:11.040
juiced in just it says I think sky is suited well for a phone sex line that's

11:11.040 --> 11:15.280
kind of scary to me that's not that's not my bag baby

11:15.280 --> 11:27.080
Anyways, speaking of women, a certain game coming out soon, Dead Rising, which is awesome,

11:27.080 --> 11:33.240
rewards you for taking erotic pictures of women.

11:33.240 --> 11:37.360
Actually one of the genres of pictures you can take in the game, besides horror and drama

11:37.360 --> 11:42.280
and stuff like that, is erotic, erotica, and they have a perfect picture of one of the

11:42.280 --> 11:47.220
leads in there I guess in fishnet stockings and lingerie and you're taking pictures of

11:47.220 --> 11:52.520
her and one of the focal points is her breasts and it's perfect and you get prestige points

11:52.520 --> 11:53.520
for that.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.920
It's kind of like experience points in the games.

11:54.920 --> 12:03.140
But it's kind of interesting though because you can also take erotic zombie pictures.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.560
Erotic zombie pictures?

12:04.560 --> 12:05.560
Yes.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.380
Erotic zombie pictures.

12:07.380 --> 12:09.280
Why didn't they just call the game that?

12:09.280 --> 12:13.160
Why didn't they just call the damn game Erotic Zombie Pictures?

12:13.160 --> 12:16.160
You know how many more copies would have sold?

12:16.160 --> 12:17.160
Listen, this is an important Civil 2000 series, okay?

12:17.160 --> 12:19.480
This is a cool game.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.480
But how many more copies would have sold?

12:21.480 --> 12:25.520
You know, Dead Rising, you had to tell me about what this game was about before I was

12:25.520 --> 12:27.520
interested in it, and I actually had to see the preview.

12:27.520 --> 12:31.640
But if you had told me there was a game on the market called, you know, Erotic Zombie

12:31.640 --> 12:36.760
Pictures, I would have been like, say no more, sold, sold!

12:36.760 --> 12:40.800
I didn't know that was your bag.

12:40.800 --> 12:48.200
Well I think it's pretty awesome, but apparently you can also get points by just pretty much

12:48.200 --> 12:49.200
doing everything.

12:49.200 --> 12:54.600
I love this, this is actually translated from Famitsu magazine, and they have, it says,

12:54.600 --> 13:01.960
and this is the exact, you know, English translation, if the sexy survivor you rescue by the chance

13:01.960 --> 13:08.960
arrival which photographs the seductive scene because also sexy acquisition PP increases

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
PP being prestige points, you dirty bastards out there.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.760
Okay, I, I'm, okay. Whether just the woman also, it is...

13:20.760 --> 13:26.120
How can you not comment on that? How can you, how can you just overlook that? Blatant reference

13:26.120 --> 13:33.120
there. Hey, the dead is rising.

13:33.920 --> 13:37.160
Welcome to the last episode of Orange Launch Radio, everybody. It was lovely knowing you

13:37.160 --> 13:41.120
these past four years. Unfortunately, the jokes, we've suffocated ourselves on the bad

13:41.120 --> 13:43.160
jokes tonight, and we're dying.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.120
It's going to be an awesome game.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.120
It's going to be my fault!

13:45.120 --> 13:49.440
It's going to be an awesome game. Just buy it for the awesomeness in the game. I mean,

13:49.440 --> 13:53.280
I knew right away when they saw the little publicity shots of who the character is going

13:53.280 --> 14:00.320
be in the game i mean we're talking like horny otaku you know women in this so i have a quote

14:00.320 --> 14:06.080
from mystery science 3000 to quote okay in regards to the whole taking pictures of half naked girls

14:06.080 --> 14:13.280
erotic zombie pictures yeah well whoopdy shit that that's that's your outlook on that aren't

14:13.280 --> 14:20.000
you excited to be taking erotic pictures of zombies i love zombies but not that much

14:20.000 --> 14:26.280
much. Bruce Campbell, yes. I need the human chin to come talk to me. Can you use, like,

14:26.280 --> 14:32.000
because you can use anything to kill things in Dead Rising, right? Yes. Can you use pants?

14:32.000 --> 14:36.640
I don't know. It depends on if you mean in the American sense or the British sense, because

14:36.640 --> 14:41.960
if you use someone's stinky pants, then yes, probably. You can dress up like a little kid

14:41.960 --> 14:47.440
and you can wear stinky pants. By the way, if Bruce Campbell is listening to this podcast,

14:47.440 --> 14:49.360
hang out with us. We want to interview you.

14:49.360 --> 14:53.500
I remember seeing in the preview that the guy was running around in his skivvies for

14:53.500 --> 14:57.880
part of the little preview trailer. So did he kill someone with his pants? What did he

14:57.880 --> 14:58.400
do?

14:58.400 --> 15:00.540
He took his pants off.

15:00.540 --> 15:03.160
It's more because of the erotic zombie pictures?

15:03.160 --> 15:09.240
It's more free. I don't know. The real, like, it's just weird, okay? You take weird pictures

15:09.240 --> 15:13.320
and stuff. I don't know how far it goes into the erotic stuff, but whatever.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.240
Hey, hey, none of this shark jumping talk.

15:16.240 --> 15:19.240
Oh, Chat Room? No we haven't. No we haven't.

15:19.240 --> 15:23.240
If we jump the shark, that happened a long time ago, like, you know.

15:23.240 --> 15:26.240
If we jump the shark, we are going to literally jump over a shark.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.240
We jumped the shark episode 2.

15:28.240 --> 15:32.240
Jamie skipped town on episode 2 of Orange Launch Radio, if you guys remember.

15:32.240 --> 15:35.240
Alright, anyway, let's move on, please.

15:35.240 --> 15:40.240
PlayStation 2, How We Love Thee, and your cheap games,

15:40.240 --> 15:42.240
because there's cheaper games coming out for the PlayStation 2,

15:42.240 --> 15:45.240

16:02.720 --> 16:05.240
Excellent. No idea when that is supposedly coming out

16:05.760 --> 16:11.000
But it's the next series according to a leak from Circuit City, which I never would meet very soon

16:11.000 --> 16:14.960
Yeah, I'll have the release coming soon. Probably awesome also getting greatest hits

16:14.960 --> 16:20.140
I just want to mention real quick is the PSP and these are also going to be $19.99 ATV

16:20.140 --> 16:25.540
Off-Road Fury, Ape Escape on the Loose, Hot Shots Golf, Twisted Metal Head-On, and Wipe

Out Pier.

16:26.540 --> 16:27.540
That's awesome.

16:27.540 --> 16:32.100
If I remember correctly also, I believe the Game Boy Advance was having some more greatest

16:32.100 --> 16:38.900
hits coming including, what was it, Mario Kart and, oh man, just a bunch of other Game

16:38.900 --> 16:39.900
Boy Advance games.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.740
I remember there was about five of them that they're adding to their, whatever they call

16:42.740 --> 16:46.520
their greatest hits I think is like these are my favorite stories cheaper

16:46.520 --> 16:53.600
games cheaper games always yes excellent stuff but um I'm GS 68 says no luminous

16:53.600 --> 16:58.280
for the lose yeah that kind of sucks well they want to suck all the money they

16:58.280 --> 17:02.460
can out of that stupid thing but whatever I have a personal bone to pick

17:02.460 --> 17:07.920
about luminous why I couldn't get luminous to install on my phone oh that

17:07.920 --> 17:11.580
you try to get the cell version yeah I don't know it was out yeah and it

17:11.580 --> 17:15.460
wouldn't install stupid network I'm totally gonna try and see if I can get

17:15.460 --> 17:23.940
that game sweet anyways the former manager of Sony as a third-party

17:23.940 --> 17:31.460
relations has left and actually went to Ubisoft which is kind of interesting so

17:31.460 --> 17:35.420
you know people leaving Sony I guess that's not really big news what is big

17:35.420 --> 17:43.020
news is they're saying that they've sent out over 10,000 PS3 dev kits, so wow, lots of

17:43.020 --> 17:47.660
dev kits going out there, but all the dev kits in the world won't make that system any

17:47.660 --> 17:49.420
cheaper.

17:49.420 --> 17:50.420
But that's pretty cool.

17:50.420 --> 17:52.980
Yes, but it might get more games worthy of you to talk about.

17:52.980 --> 17:57.540
More games, more exclusive games, and it's a good thing that they've sent them out, because

17:57.540 --> 18:03.300
before I remember they were saying that it's really costly to develop for it, and so those

18:03.300 --> 18:11.700
10,000 you know dev kits to over 208 companies in 11 countries nice and as

18:11.700 --> 18:17.540
apparently the largest on any PlayStation platform to date so that's

18:17.540 --> 18:22.420
actually pretty cool that's pretty cool speaking of cool and actually you know

18:22.420 --> 18:27.420
we brought this up last week with their release dates mm-hmm

18:27.420 --> 18:34.340
EA is bringing out Sims 2 pets. There's some details on this. It actually is

18:34.340 --> 18:40.080
gonna be a PC expansion standalone for PS2, GameCube, PSP, Nintendo DS, and Game

18:40.080 --> 18:45.180
Boy Advance. You can have kitty cat, and puppy dogs, and guinea pigs, and birds, and

18:45.180 --> 18:55.300
whatever else they decide to put in there. You can create your own pet and

18:55.300 --> 19:00.260
and customize everything from fur to body, personality, you can make them

19:00.260 --> 19:03.580
smart puppies or stupid guinea pigs.

19:03.580 --> 19:08.420
Evil purple penguins? Yes, Rob, evil purple penguins. Yay!

19:08.420 --> 19:12.900
You can name them, um, Bob.

19:12.900 --> 19:16.780
Oh, uh, Arimasa wants to know, snakes? On a plane?

19:16.780 --> 19:22.660
Ba dum bum. Yeah. Um, you can teach your pets to shake, roll over, play dead,

19:22.660 --> 19:28.160
you know dig up dead bodies that type of thing. Now if you catch your puppies

19:28.160 --> 19:32.620
digging in the garden or scratching up the furniture you'll have to spank. And

19:32.620 --> 19:37.020
you'll be taking them to go get spayed or neutered. You can also use codes where

19:37.020 --> 19:43.580
you can share accessories for markings that type of thing. So basically you can

19:43.580 --> 19:48.100
make skins for your pets. Different versions will have different things. PC

19:48.100 --> 19:52.460
will let you have designer pets like labrapoodles and puggles and schnoodles.

19:52.460 --> 19:56.460
Can you breed hamsters with dogs?

19:56.460 --> 20:00.460
No. I don't know. Can I breed a pig with an elephant?

20:00.460 --> 20:04.460
Exactly. Hey! In your

20:04.460 --> 20:08.460
Create-A-Pet you can actually create them as unique pedigrees and put them online.

20:08.460 --> 20:12.460
They can actually have career paths which is a show pet, security

20:12.460 --> 20:16.460
or service with five job levels apiece.

20:16.460 --> 20:20.460
The PS2 GameCube PSP versions will let you take them for a walk in the park.

20:20.460 --> 20:22.220
But they make friends with other animals.

20:22.220 --> 20:28.420
Does the hamster have an employment path of sex toy?

20:28.420 --> 20:29.260
Yes.

20:29.260 --> 20:30.940
It comes with a cardboard tube.

20:30.940 --> 20:32.820
Can you take erotic pictures of the pets?

20:35.820 --> 20:37.500
Can you kill them by drowning them?

20:37.500 --> 20:38.900
Like low key, like stupid humans?

20:38.900 --> 20:41.140
So those are the PS2 GameCube and PSP are all getting

20:41.140 --> 20:42.740
like Nintendogs version, basically.

20:42.740 --> 20:45.580
Do the parrots have large talons?

20:45.580 --> 20:46.980
Hey, shut up.

20:46.980 --> 20:53.960
on the DS. You can have a pet care center and other owners can come to have you take

20:53.960 --> 21:00.580
care of their pets. You have shops and you can earn money by having a pet shop, basically.

21:00.580 --> 21:05.220
And the Game Boy Advance one will have different careers for the sim, including veterinarian

21:05.220 --> 21:06.220
and pet trainer.

21:06.220 --> 21:10.980
I hope they can become rabid. Blaze Revolution in our chatroom, orangelanotrainer.com, click

21:10.980 --> 21:15.820
on chat, says, I want a liger. Man, that Napoleon dynamite, so funny.

21:15.820 --> 21:21.980
I want an octocat, actually. DJ Kibbles N Bits says, man, we need Spore already in talks

21:21.980 --> 21:26.420
of all these, you know, make your animals games. Just give us Spore. Yeah. Dammit EA,

21:26.420 --> 21:30.180
just give us Spore, we're good. Yeah, this is sounding a little too much like, what was

21:30.180 --> 21:39.580
it, RTS, Impossible Creatures, if you remember that. Ooh. You're so hardcore. Anyways, speaking

21:39.580 --> 21:46.700
have cool stuff coming out. The Wii, basically Ubisoft in the UK has confirmed that Red Steel

21:46.700 --> 21:54.340
is coming out in November in the UK. What does that mean to us though? Well, not a damn

21:54.340 --> 21:58.620
thing. A couple of things though. Red Steel is supposed to be the launch title. Now, Red

21:58.620 --> 22:03.140
Steel is supposed to be coming, or the Wii is supposed to be coming out before Playstation

22:03.140 --> 22:10.220
3 that we know. So, for example, the Playstation 3 is coming out in mid-November. So therefore

22:10.220 --> 22:14.900
this has to be coming out early November. Well, in the UK, in the UK it's probably going

22:14.900 --> 22:22.100
to be getting the Wii a few weeks after us. What's a couple weeks before November? October

22:22.100 --> 22:30.180
18th. Aha! It's like almost like six degrees of Kevin Bacon there. I am so sick of all

22:30.180 --> 22:34.100
these news stories about the Wii's speculated release date.

22:34.100 --> 22:37.460
I mean, the damn thing will come out when it comes out.

22:37.460 --> 22:41.660
That being said, Activision slipped up and might have revealed the Wii release date this

22:41.660 --> 22:46.620
week, because Activision sent out this spreadsheet of all their upcoming games, and one of the

22:46.620 --> 22:51.100
games that's listed on there is Tony Hawk Downhill Jam, and the ship date?

22:51.100 --> 22:52.100
October.

22:52.100 --> 22:55.740
Now, they don't say the day, but they say it's in October, which seems to confirm that

22:55.740 --> 22:59.280
the Wii is coming out in October.

22:59.280 --> 23:04.840
which date I had in my system when, you know, they put Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam. Uh, that's

23:04.840 --> 23:05.840
right.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.600
I'm gonna kind of feel bad if it doesn't come out October 18th. I'm gonna feel like Reggie

23:09.600 --> 23:10.880
personally fucked with us.

23:10.880 --> 23:15.560
He's all, I'll show you. Think you know when it's coming out, bastards.

23:15.560 --> 23:20.560
Ah, you like, how you like them apples?

23:20.560 --> 23:24.360
Ari Mossin in chat says Zelda Twilight Princess is scheduled for November, though, and that

23:24.360 --> 23:26.240
game's coming out on launch day.

23:26.240 --> 23:30.400
Yeah, but there's been no official date announced for Twilight Princess because

23:30.400 --> 23:34.200
that's gonna be the day that the Wii comes out, so obviously they're not gonna

23:34.200 --> 23:34.880
announce that.

23:34.880 --> 23:38.720
Yeah, by the way, Twilight Princess is coming out this day. Oh, crap!

23:38.720 --> 23:42.280
They're not gonna do that. Guys, we have a huge scoop for you guys.

23:42.280 --> 23:46.720
The Wii is out right now. In fact, go to your local GameStopper EB Games and ask

23:46.720 --> 23:47.360
for one.

23:47.360 --> 23:52.680
They'll love you for it. And if the store tells you they don't have them yet, they're

23:52.680 --> 23:54.800
playing a joke on you. Go to another store and ask.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.480
Exactly. Please, I hope you guys know I'm kidding.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.480
Please don't. It's super secret.

24:01.480 --> 24:05.240
And there's nothing one of those employees at those stores loves more

24:05.240 --> 24:08.160
than people coming in going, do you have the Wii yet?

24:08.160 --> 24:12.080
Anyways, speaking of

24:12.080 --> 24:15.320
lies and speculation,

24:15.320 --> 24:19.080
there's been a lot of rumors going around to what

24:19.080 --> 24:22.640
some of the secrets of the Wii and what they might be, so

24:22.640 --> 24:33.640
Anyways, some speculation here we've got for ya, including this is apparently from wii.qj.net

24:33.640 --> 24:40.640
and they've got a little article here about some of the stuff to expect that an insider told them.

24:40.640 --> 24:41.640
You know, insider.

24:41.640 --> 24:48.640
Anyways, the full scope of the Wii controller details have yet to be revealed by Pixar and Nintendo

24:48.640 --> 24:55.360
and says, although I cannot elaborate any further, let me say that Nintendo should show

24:55.360 --> 25:01.520
that movement in 3D space will allow experiences outside of just the TV screen and it's not

25:01.520 --> 25:04.240
3D projection related.

25:04.240 --> 25:09.200
But this also kind of, if you think about it, goes back to that one article we had about

25:09.200 --> 25:14.600
Red Steel and how some of the multiplayer won't take place on TV, which is interesting.

25:14.600 --> 25:19.780
The first game that's going to be shown to the public that will demonstrate the full

25:19.780 --> 25:25.680
scope of the Wii controller potential will be Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2, which

25:25.680 --> 25:28.620
is also scheduled for October by the way.

25:28.620 --> 25:33.460
That's for all systems, including the Wii.

25:33.460 --> 25:39.340
The sensor bar was in all actuality in no use at E3.

25:39.340 --> 25:46.840
What it will allow hasn't been shown yet, which I don't know what that's supposed to

25:46.840 --> 25:50.680
mean but interesting.

25:50.680 --> 25:54.900
And it says, according to people who are working close with everyday events and Nintendo research

25:54.900 --> 25:59.440
and development, Nintendo Wii specifications were far and away developed solely for the

25:59.440 --> 26:00.540
machine.

26:00.540 --> 26:04.400
And it says apparently that the specs keep changing on it.

26:04.400 --> 26:10.600
so that there's plans on maybe doing a Wii headset and it says for the online capability

26:10.600 --> 26:17.600
and they might even go further in having it have a gyroscope inside of the headset.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.600
For game use.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.440
Interesting.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.800
Some of it far-fetched, some of it maybe?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.480
I don't know.

26:26.480 --> 26:27.640
We'll see.

26:27.640 --> 26:28.640
It's a lot of speculation.

26:28.640 --> 26:32.800
You know, it's just so frustrating because Sony talks too much and Nintendo doesn't talk

26:32.800 --> 26:33.800
enough.

26:33.800 --> 26:38.280
Yeah. Why can't they just, maybe they need to shuffle their corporate structures a little

26:38.280 --> 26:41.840
bit and then you know we get some people, some loudmouths on Nintendo and some quieter

26:41.840 --> 26:49.720
people at Sony. It would be beautiful. I don't know, but these, these rumors frustrate me

26:49.720 --> 26:53.360
to no end and make me angsty. How do you feel about that Dark Sakura? Do you get angsty

26:53.360 --> 27:12.440
of these rumors. Here come the FU's of the week, boys and girls. My FU of the week goes

27:12.440 --> 27:17.640
toward websites that use flash ads that have sound on them. Like when you go on MySpace

27:17.640 --> 27:27.080
in here. Smack the bug to win a million dollars! Or like whatever site that was playing the

27:27.080 --> 27:32.520
sounds of death, and I couldn't find what adit was to turn it off. Just a big, stinky

27:32.520 --> 27:34.080
pile of poo on that.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.080
Loki.

27:35.080 --> 27:42.880
Um, you know, FU to IGN, and FU to IGN for one reason, and I've covered this before.

27:42.880 --> 27:47.760
Jessica Chobot. I don't like her. And the reason I don't like her is because she's...

27:47.760 --> 27:52.880
it's like a Paris Hilton situation here. Famous for no apparent reason. Famous because of

27:52.880 --> 27:58.520
something stupid. Famous because she licked a PSP. Come on now. And now they have her

27:58.520 --> 28:05.240
in like this 17 volume whatever right now feature where she talks about stuff and has

28:05.240 --> 28:09.680
stupid pictures and this one of course she has snakes on her because of snakes on a plane.

28:09.680 --> 28:17.300
snakes on the chest I guess lame come on folks I mean stop pouring her out she's

28:17.300 --> 28:24.360
nobody stop trying to make her somebody my f-you of the week goes to my facial

28:24.360 --> 28:28.480
hair for growing too fast as you can see I was too lazy to shave today or

28:28.480 --> 28:33.880
yesterday and I practically have a beard at this point so an F you to the and an

28:33.880 --> 28:37.880
And F.U. to the inflating cost of razors.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.880
Magus!

28:39.880 --> 28:44.880
Yo, my F.U. this week is the same as last week.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.880
F.U. to my air conditioner.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.880
Apparently the compressor took a shit, they have to replace the whole unit.

28:49.880 --> 28:53.880
Oh no, we're not going to replace the whole unit, we're just going to fix the one we have.

28:53.880 --> 28:58.880
You know, make a decision and get to it because it's still like 90 degrees in my den.

28:58.880 --> 29:04.880
My computer will not work right, and it's just a big pain in the ass.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.880
Alright.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.880
Thanks for keeping the angst quick tonight, guys.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.880
It allows us to move on to another story.

29:10.880 --> 29:16.880
Anyways, speaking of fun stuff, this week, Fusion Frenzy 2 was announced.

29:16.880 --> 29:21.880
And for those who might not remember, it was a really cool game that was on the Xbox.

29:21.880 --> 29:27.880
And it's basically a collection of about, you know, 40 or so mini-games.

29:27.880 --> 29:32.040
Well this time they're going to be having more mini games as well over 40 and set on

29:32.040 --> 29:36.800
seven different planets as well as online multiplayer matches and tournaments and it

29:36.800 --> 29:40.760
says players will be able to use tournament cards they've earned for a variety of purposes

29:40.760 --> 29:46.080
including selecting the next game to be played or choosing the next planet to go to.

29:46.080 --> 29:50.840
So it sounds like a pretty fun little 360 game and it's set to hit the stores this holiday

29:50.840 --> 29:51.840
season.

29:51.840 --> 29:55.840
Well if you're having a hard time playing through Fusion Frenzy 1, maybe you ought to

29:55.840 --> 29:57.400
get a tutor.

29:57.400 --> 30:03.000
The Wall Street Journal has recently run a report on gamers who are using their skills

30:03.000 --> 30:07.300
to help pay the rent and basically what they are doing is they are setting up this whole

30:07.300 --> 30:09.860
enterprise here.

30:09.860 --> 30:20.480
Seeing as gamers that work all day have not a lot of time to perfect their skills, gaming-lessons.com

30:20.480 --> 30:29.180
has this guy, Tom Taylor, who you pay $45 for an hour, and he will turn you into an

30:29.180 --> 30:32.760
expert master chief.

30:32.760 --> 30:39.700
What do you guys think about hiring tutors to get better at games?

30:39.700 --> 30:46.200
It's I guess an interesting idea for them to use to make money, but no.

30:46.200 --> 30:49.480
By the way, if you're questioning whether this is legit or anything, what can this guy

30:49.480 --> 30:53.280
do for me this is the guy who also just signed like this big fat quarter million

30:53.280 --> 30:58.760
dollar contract to play halo essentially okay well how are you gonna teach me to

30:58.760 --> 31:03.000
play something other than halo oh that's right well maybe you know if the

31:03.000 --> 31:06.480
business model works here then it can work you know elsewhere so what kind of

31:06.480 --> 31:12.880
a tutor is he I mean that's like saying I owe a master at fractions okay can you

31:12.880 --> 31:19.120
teach me some multiplication I'm a master at fractions no I don't know it's

31:19.120 --> 31:20.600
This is kind of dumb.

31:20.600 --> 31:21.600
I'm actually kind of curious.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.360
I want to look at this site real quick.

31:23.360 --> 31:24.360
It's gaming-lessons.com.

31:24.360 --> 31:25.360
Hmm.

31:25.360 --> 31:29.040
They have a gaming lessons store available?

31:29.040 --> 31:30.040
They have some...

31:30.040 --> 31:32.760
It looks like they have some free, you know, that sold out lessons.

31:32.760 --> 31:33.760
Wow.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.760
People are buying these.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.760
Sounds oddly familiar.

31:35.760 --> 31:43.120
Sounds like that whole Penny Arcade Academy of 2000, only without the tanks and piranhas.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.360
Wow.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.360
Interesting stuff.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.360
I'm just kind of tearing through the site here.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.400
Yeah, it talks about the major league gaming signing crazy

31:51.600 --> 31:55.880
That's like getting a professional baseball player to come tutor to you though in a way, right? I

31:56.840 --> 32:01.760
Mean guess people wouldn't laugh at that idea. So why does this seem a little silly? I would laugh at that idea

32:03.440 --> 32:09.460
All right fair enough if you have a comment on that you could always send it into our mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio

32:09.460 --> 32:16.080
Calm and every week dark soccer likes to dig into the mailbag and pull out her favorite letters that hopefully aren't too moldy

32:16.080 --> 32:21.960
yeah some of them had some funk on them and it was it was a convention funk not

32:21.960 --> 32:25.600
as bad as fanboy funk all right anyway she's gonna open up that mailbag right

32:25.600 --> 32:28.840
now kids and pull out some of her favorite letters to share with us right

32:28.840 --> 32:37.240
now one of our emails comes from ion six seven one not gonna read the whole thing

32:37.240 --> 32:41.040
but he calls us the OL army generals I think that's pretty funny

32:41.040 --> 32:48.020
that's senior sergeant to you I actually generals above sergeant whatever it

32:48.020 --> 32:51.400
doesn't matter I'm making a Warcraft joke but whatever okay and if you guys

32:51.400 --> 32:54.560
are music game fans do you have any favorite game soundtracks from any game

32:54.560 --> 33:00.360
music game or not my favorite is definitely jets at radio wow that's a

33:00.360 --> 33:03.720
really broad question I mean you want like recent game soundtracks or old

33:03.720 --> 33:09.080
school stuff long gun midnight max oh I love long gun as far as like a non

33:09.080 --> 33:14.600
Oh, yeah, that's got a great soundtrack for driving heck I I'll use that soundtrack. Well at least the cuts

33:14.600 --> 33:16.600
I have I don't have the whole thing I need to re-get it

33:16.680 --> 33:22.480
I'll use the cuts when I play Xbox 360 driving games like instead of EA tracks because I don't really like a lot of that

33:22.480 --> 33:29.880
Stuff I'll listen to that music while playing driving games. It's awesome. I've told you you have access to all my stuff

33:29.880 --> 33:31.880
I know I just keep forgetting um

33:32.400 --> 33:36.840
Dance dance revolution third mix had a kick-ass soundtrack in my opinion

33:36.840 --> 33:43.840
If you want to go new school. If you want to go like really old school, I like soundtracks like Super Metroid, but it's really old.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.840
Loki, anything you want to suggest?

33:45.840 --> 33:51.840
What was a really fun one I had? Well, I had my car Gran Turismo, the first one.

33:51.840 --> 33:54.840
That had a pretty decent soundtrack.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.840
Rez had a pretty good soundtrack.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.840
Ooh yeah, Rez.

33:58.840 --> 34:00.840
And Space Channel 5!

34:00.840 --> 34:03.840
Yeah, I played that forever in my car.

34:03.840 --> 34:12.860
hmm I don't know I'm really recently like I can't really see burner revenge

34:12.860 --> 34:19.020
because a lot of the music I didn't like other than junkie XL but oh hello I

34:19.020 --> 34:24.260
mean why you had some pretty good stuff Justin and chat wins symphony of the

34:24.260 --> 34:29.300
night when actually actually actually I have many it's I love symphony and that

34:29.300 --> 34:32.820
soundtrack especially the Saturn one they had the remixes of bloody tears and

34:32.820 --> 34:33.820
Vampire Hunter.

34:33.820 --> 34:34.820
Oh yes.

34:34.820 --> 34:40.380
But, um, I actually will take my co- I actually burned off all the, uh, sound- all the music

34:40.380 --> 34:46.520
off of my, um, uh, Rondo of Blood, just to listen to the remixed versions of all the

34:46.520 --> 34:49.000
old school Castlevania tunes.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.300
That and there's just, uh, there's music in that that's just so awesome and it's all

34:53.300 --> 34:55.600
Redbook audio so you can actually play this on soundtrack.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.840
Wow, Rama and Chad just gave us a useless trivia fact.

34:57.840 --> 35:01.920
The girl that did the voice of Ulala on Space Channel 5 now works at Home Depot in New York

35:01.920 --> 35:07.340
city how's that smile yeah she also still does apparently still does

35:07.340 --> 35:12.740
conventions but but works at Home Depot I wonder she but she go up and down the

35:12.740 --> 35:20.220
aisles you know going choo-choo-choo she used to be the the real-life anime girl

35:20.220 --> 35:26.780
is what her whole deal was apparently she gave a shot of her business to the

35:26.780 --> 35:35.340
crowd at Coast Con about five years ago home lighting to get in where I and I

35:35.340 --> 35:39.420
get this from an eyewitness by the way next email before I say something really

35:39.420 --> 35:44.740
bad sorry okay I was going down a troublesome path I needed to be shown

35:44.740 --> 35:49.180
the light that the Grand Theft Auto new wave one oh cuz it's all my favorite

35:49.180 --> 35:54.820
80s oh yeah the 80 like seven discs of 80s music and stuff good and one of it

35:54.820 --> 36:00.660
was new wave so uh actually I've been really getting into the Kingdom Hearts

36:00.660 --> 36:04.940
2 soundtrack though because I had put the Tron music on repeat so you've got

36:04.940 --> 36:08.780
about 50 different soundtrack suggestions from us so have fun buying

36:08.780 --> 36:12.140
all those legally just bringing up some of the Final Fantasy hate to in this

36:12.140 --> 36:16.500
email he actually wanted to tell me to rock on with Aerith dying but he's

36:16.500 --> 36:20.300
basically displeased with the fanboys on the internet he has a one-up club for

36:20.300 --> 36:24.020
people you know who are in the same games as he is and people are all like

36:24.020 --> 36:28.780
And he tried to ask them nicely not to and they were like being rude back

36:28.780 --> 36:31.060
So it was like, you know what? That's the nature of the internet

36:31.580 --> 36:35.760
You know there I think isn't there an abuse report. I'm biting my tongue so bad right now

36:35.760 --> 36:38.880
You don't even know so I'm just get off of one up start a Yahoo group

36:41.740 --> 36:44.620
Okay, how's that that's fine

36:50.060 --> 36:52.460
Start a real website anyway moving on

36:52.460 --> 37:00.680
Our friend Rob with two B's sent us an email, here's some fuel for the fire the next time

37:00.680 --> 37:04.520
you discuss watching your own children.

37:04.520 --> 37:08.180
My nephews visited yesterday, their mom had no clue which games they owned.

37:08.180 --> 37:13.460
It turns out that only the ones I gave them, all appropriate for kids, are the ones they

37:13.460 --> 37:14.460
had.

37:14.460 --> 37:16.820
But talking with the kids made me realize something, your children will be exposed to

37:16.820 --> 37:19.480
almost every game made through their friends.

37:19.480 --> 37:23.120
That's a rough realization, despite your best efforts, little Johnny Doe will have Resident

37:23.120 --> 37:26.440
Evil on his DS because Mommy bought it for him.

37:26.440 --> 37:28.920
Johnny will show the other kids regardless of age, including your own.

37:28.920 --> 37:32.520
Therefore, as long as one's parent doesn't care which games their kids play, no amount

37:32.520 --> 37:36.880
of laws will be effective or even practical in keeping that game away from your own children

37:36.880 --> 37:38.920
unless you live under a rock.

37:38.920 --> 37:42.680
You can only battle this type of outside influence by teaching your kids to understand what is

37:42.680 --> 37:45.200
real, what is fantasy, and why they're different.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.200
Amen!

37:46.200 --> 37:47.200
Exactly.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.200
Nail on the head.

37:49.200 --> 37:55.200
Also, now this is something that I had actually half thought of getting for myself, we'd been

37:55.200 --> 37:56.840
discussing it.

37:56.840 --> 38:07.600
We got an email from, oh I think our connection just hiccuped, anyway, we got an email from

38:07.600 --> 38:22.520
Gareth, who asked about the GP2X, which is the sequel to the GP32, which comes from Korea.

38:22.520 --> 38:27.420
It's an open source handheld system.

38:27.420 --> 38:32.580
You can load, as he says in here, I can play loads of classic emulated games, watch videos

38:32.580 --> 38:36.060
and podcasts all on one device. It's at gp2x.com

38:36.060 --> 38:40.520
or gp2x.co.uk

38:40.520 --> 38:45.100
By the way, I want to thank the listeners. This is a

38:45.100 --> 38:48.100
completely different random topic. I don't remember who suggested it to me, but

38:48.100 --> 38:49.580
somebody suggested the

38:49.580 --> 38:53.980
front row application for the Mac and like how you can install it on a Mac

38:53.980 --> 38:55.260
that it didn't really come with

38:55.260 --> 38:58.820
and that's been great for my laptop for like video podcasts and movies and

38:58.820 --> 39:01.440
stuff. So you talking about a device that would play all that

39:01.440 --> 39:07.160
Kind of made me think of that so I've decided when I buy my Mac. I'm gonna be getting the virtual XP

39:07.160 --> 39:09.640
I forgot who told me about that, but thank you

39:10.280 --> 39:12.280
Anyway, sorry

39:12.880 --> 39:14.160
And

39:14.160 --> 39:15.880
then

39:15.880 --> 39:18.560
one comes the last one I'm gonna

39:19.760 --> 39:25.320
Point out tonight is actually a question that comes from a skater, dude

39:25.320 --> 39:31.480
Hey Orangels Radio, I was wondering about how the DS sales are dramatically larger than

39:31.480 --> 39:32.480
the PSP sales.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.760
Do you think it is because the DS is cheaper or what?

39:34.760 --> 39:35.840
Please give me your thoughts.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.840
Love the show.

39:36.840 --> 39:42.760
So I think there's crazy people out there that bought a DS and a DS Lite when it came

39:42.760 --> 39:43.760
back out.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.340
Yeah, I'd agree.

39:45.340 --> 39:49.020
I didn't do that, but I will get a DS Lite when they come out with the new colors because

39:49.020 --> 39:52.080
I'm not going to be suckered into buying one of these white ones and then, you know, a

39:52.080 --> 39:54.360
a few months later, ooh, pretty blue, pretty pink,

39:54.360 --> 39:56.280
pretty green, or whatever else they're going to release.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.660
What if they come out pretty blue

39:57.660 --> 40:00.360
and you really want it pretty like red or something,

40:00.360 --> 40:01.520
and then red comes out?

40:01.520 --> 40:02.520
Then I'll just be mad.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.320
I like my white one.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.000
I'll be flat up mad.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.080
I just, you know, there'll be a cooler color that all the cool

40:09.080 --> 40:10.600
kids want.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.920
So why do you have a white one?

40:15.240 --> 40:15.920
Any more emails?

40:15.920 --> 40:18.240
Dear Rob, STFU.

40:18.240 --> 40:19.400
OK, thanks, bye.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.400
Any more emails?

40:20.400 --> 40:22.320
No, there aren't.

40:22.320 --> 40:28.100
We should have more emails sent to us at mailbag at orangelaunsradio.com.

40:28.100 --> 40:34.400
Tell us how much you love it when I make those jokes that make Jamie uncomfortable.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.920
Hope to hear from you soon.

40:35.920 --> 40:36.920
Exactly.

40:36.920 --> 40:42.680
And in the meantime, while you're waiting to send emails or something, or need something

40:42.680 --> 40:50.660
send emails about, perhaps the creator of Electroplankton's brand new project, the

40:50.660 --> 40:53.620
Tenori On, would be something that you'll want to talk about.

40:53.620 --> 41:01.460
And basically Toshio EY is coming up with this brand new device, it's basically a 16

41:01.460 --> 41:08.560
by 16 grid of LCD switches, or LED switches, which are used to actually play music.

41:08.560 --> 41:14.860
and you can kind of use this to create your own mixes. He actually has a website that

41:14.860 --> 41:26.200
you can visit, which is www.global.yamaha.com slash design slash tenori dash on, which is

41:26.200 --> 41:33.680
T-E-N-O-R-I dash O-N. And you can check it out. The device looks pretty interesting.

41:33.680 --> 41:40.880
he says that anybody can use it to make music, and it looks kind of sexy.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.580
So kind of a neat little device there.

41:43.580 --> 41:46.280
And if it's anything like electroplankton, it should be pretty awesome.

41:46.280 --> 41:50.460
Well, I know some people that played a lot of electroplankton, in fact, so much they

41:50.460 --> 41:51.640
were addicted.

41:51.640 --> 41:56.000
And you might remember on a previous program, episode of Orange Launch Radio, we talked

41:56.000 --> 42:01.840
about the Dutch Game Addiction Clinic, and we were talking about all that, the folks

42:01.840 --> 42:03.280
that were signing up to go to this clinic.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.280
Well guess what?

42:04.280 --> 42:10.080
Ever since this hit some of the mainstream news, apparently the gaming treatment program

42:10.080 --> 42:17.040
has been inundated with calls from parents wanting to get their kids in this.

42:17.040 --> 42:22.560
Clinic director Keith Bakker explained, computer game addiction is obviously an even greater

42:22.560 --> 42:25.860
problem than we imagined.

42:25.860 --> 42:26.860
Everything okay?

42:26.860 --> 42:27.860
No, nothing.

42:27.860 --> 42:28.860
Okay.

42:28.860 --> 42:29.860
Just making sure.

42:29.860 --> 42:31.860
Just makin' sure, hoo!

42:31.860 --> 42:34.860
Hmm, sounded like there was something bad goin' on over there.

42:34.860 --> 42:38.860
Um, you're having a little too much fun here.

42:38.860 --> 42:41.860
I can say something about that name, however, I don't want to reveal where I...

42:41.860 --> 42:44.860
Does the game addiction thing strike a chord with you?

42:44.860 --> 42:47.860
No, I'm not addicted. Much.

42:47.860 --> 42:51.860
Alright, uh, it is conceded that video game addiction, also by the same guy,

42:51.860 --> 42:56.860
quote, is not a chemical dependency, but it's got everything of an obsessive-compulsive disorder

42:56.860 --> 42:59.740
disorder and all the other stuff that comes with chemical dependencies.

42:59.740 --> 43:01.380
Hmm, interesting.

43:01.380 --> 43:04.500
You know, and I know there was another related story that talked about some guy was so addicted

43:04.500 --> 43:08.980
to video games that he never left his room and he peed in a bottle or something like

43:08.980 --> 43:09.980
that.

43:09.980 --> 43:10.980
That's awesome.

43:10.980 --> 43:14.380
Okay, dude, that guy had more problems with being addicted to video games because I don't

43:14.380 --> 43:18.020
know in what universe that's considered sanitary by any means.

43:18.020 --> 43:19.180
That's obsessive compulsive disorder.

43:19.180 --> 43:20.960
Yeah, there's something else going on there.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.200
That's more than game addiction.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.200
That's craziness.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.200
I don't know.

43:24.200 --> 43:26.580
It needs professional help, absolutely.

43:26.580 --> 43:31.700
I don't know. But I'm kind of weary about these people just, you know, having the parents

43:31.700 --> 43:37.620
call in and say, oh yeah, my kids are addicted to games because they just play them a lot

43:37.620 --> 43:41.940
and stuff. And it kind of reminds me of that But I'm a Cheerleader movie.

43:41.940 --> 43:45.340
Why is our chat room supporting the peeing in a bottle thing? I mean, is this just an

43:45.340 --> 43:50.460
internet chat thing? We have Eddie saying, pee in a bottle, for the win. Cage says, peeing

43:50.460 --> 43:56.320
in a bottle is awesome, it's liberating. Okay, the only time when it's ever socially acceptable

43:56.320 --> 43:59.840
to pee in a bottle is when you just can't pull over for some reason.

43:59.840 --> 44:00.840
At the doctor's office.

44:00.840 --> 44:02.840
Okay, fine. That's different.

44:02.840 --> 44:08.160
Or if you have cancer and have a colostomy and have to pee in a bottle.

44:08.160 --> 44:15.560
Fine. Those are all medically necessary reasons, but I mean, because you're too lazy to put

44:15.560 --> 44:20.600
down the controller for five seconds, a Halo 2, and go pee, it doesn't take that long to

44:20.600 --> 44:21.600
pee.

44:21.600 --> 44:22.600
Poop sock.

44:22.600 --> 44:26.300
I don't even want to go to number two. I don't even want to go there. This show's

44:26.960 --> 44:28.960
Fucked up enough as it is

44:30.280 --> 44:34.040
You know the show's gone down the toilet and I mean that do you think that's crazy

44:34.480 --> 44:42.240
Well, you know the talk of the Xbox 360 dropping down to 299 that is crazy talk and that's a pisser

44:43.560 --> 44:45.560
exactly says

44:46.000 --> 44:49.480
Michael our analyst Michael patcher as pretty has a

44:49.480 --> 44:56.800
to pretty much explain why this isn't going to happen. And the reason why is, Microsoft

44:56.800 --> 45:01.440
Brass has informed the Xbox division that it must turn a profit or at least break even

45:01.440 --> 45:06.640
in the fiscal 2007 year, which ends on June 30th of next year. He explains that that means

45:06.640 --> 45:14.080
that the price cuts on the Xbox 360 will only come if the box costs less to produce, ship

45:14.080 --> 45:20.960
and market than wholesale price. But the best guess is the box currently costs around $400

45:20.960 --> 45:27.640
to $450 to produce and it's likely that the company can get that down to below $400 later

45:27.640 --> 45:33.840
this year. However, just because of the price of manufacturing drops does not mean that

45:33.840 --> 45:39.360
they're going to drop the price. It just means they make more profit. So the only reason

45:39.360 --> 45:44.140
they'll drop the price to $2.99 is say the PS3 comes out and they're like oh

45:44.140 --> 45:49.020
yeah by the way when we said it was gonna come out for $4.99 actually $2.99

45:49.020 --> 45:52.340
is the price that we're gonna come out for it then they'll drop the price so

45:52.340 --> 45:58.220
not gonna happen no don't hold your breath there's better games coming out

45:58.220 --> 46:02.460
in the fall you know when all those games come out then you can decide which

46:02.460 --> 46:06.420
system you want well you know who's actually thinking that they're gonna be

46:06.420 --> 46:20.420
doing a lot of profit. That would be Nintendo. They're going Wii. They actually, um, Nintendo

46:20.420 --> 46:27.140
has actually just put out their results for their quarter ending last month. Are they

46:27.140 --> 46:33.620
going Wii in a bottle? I didn't want anybody to go there. I really didn't. Please let the

46:33.620 --> 46:38.980
the lady finish her story basically DS is pulling in so much profit basically

46:38.980 --> 46:45.900
they've sold 21 million DS's and 4.1 million DS lights they've also sold more

46:45.900 --> 46:53.180
than 78 million games Nintendo's basically projecting that from April of

46:53.180 --> 46:57.740
this year through March of next they will sell another 17 million DS's and

46:57.740 --> 47:06.140
75 million games, um, they were actually higher than their E3 predictions, um, actually they're

47:06.140 --> 47:10.180
still supporting Game Boy Advance, they're expecting to sell another 2.5 million Game

47:10.180 --> 47:19.260
Boy Advances, uh, 30 million games for the system, um, now, they basically have, uh,

47:19.260 --> 47:22.740
ditched the, uh, micro, I own a micro.

47:22.740 --> 47:27.220
God, I remember seeing that at E3, I'm like, wow, that's the dumbest idea I've seen yet.

47:27.220 --> 47:31.280
Actually like my micro because when I was really bored standing around in line

47:31.280 --> 47:38.160
I had my micro on my mom my lanyard around my throat my neck and I could pick it up whenever I got really bored and

47:38.160 --> 47:40.000
Play me some Kingdom Hearts

47:40.000 --> 47:45.220
It was or you know puzzle as playing a pocket fighter not like a fighter a puzzle fighter

47:48.600 --> 47:53.180
Now this is the interesting part Nintendo's got some predictions about the Wii as I had mentioned

47:53.180 --> 48:00.180
basically for over the next five or six months they're going to be selling the system

48:00.180 --> 48:05.180
they're expecting 6 million consoles and 17 million games

48:05.180 --> 48:08.180
Ambitious, you think they can do it?

48:08.180 --> 48:10.180
Oh yeah, it's Nintendo

48:10.180 --> 48:18.180
Yeah, but you know, GameCube, Nintendo 64, not so, well GameCube was actually, GameCube was actually pretty good

48:18.180 --> 48:21.180
Wii versus PS3, no contest

48:21.180 --> 48:22.180
No contest.

48:22.180 --> 48:25.420
At this point, absolutely, but I don't know.

48:25.420 --> 48:30.020
The Sony fanboy in me still thinks Sony might be up to something, but we'll see.

48:30.020 --> 48:33.020
Anyway, what do you guys think about anything we've talked about tonight?

We are looking forward to your calls, right now!

48:52.820 --> 48:54.940
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

48:54.940 --> 48:55.940
Who's this?

48:55.940 --> 48:56.940
Can you hear me now?

48:56.940 --> 48:57.940
Yes, I can hear you just fine.

48:57.940 --> 48:58.940
What's on your mind?

48:58.940 --> 48:59.940
Uh, there's not much.

48:59.940 --> 49:00.940
Wait, who is this?

49:00.940 --> 49:01.940
Introduce yourself to the listeners.

49:01.940 --> 49:02.940
I know who this is.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.340
Yeah, at least one person knows who I am.

49:04.340 --> 49:06.500
Hey, I know who you are too, but the new listeners might not.

49:06.500 --> 49:07.500
Who is this?

49:07.500 --> 49:10.700
It is the one and only Rahnema from the East Coast.

49:10.700 --> 49:13.020
Hey Rahnema from the East Coast, what's on your mind?

49:13.020 --> 49:18.020
Um, I was kind of surprised with the whole E3 thing, but then again, I'm not at the same

49:18.020 --> 49:19.020
time.

49:19.020 --> 49:23.120
I mean E3 is like

49:23.120 --> 49:26.980
the thing that you go to but yet you probably have to sell

49:26.980 --> 49:30.340
one of your kidneys just to get in you know. Not really

49:30.340 --> 49:33.720
I mean I have to be honest it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be

49:33.720 --> 49:38.460
If you have a legitimate reason for being there it's really not hard to get in

49:38.460 --> 49:38.840
there

49:38.840 --> 49:42.060
Yeah but you know

49:42.060 --> 49:46.060
but the way I see it you know as I said in the article

49:46.060 --> 49:50.580
mini E3 is going to be happening. I don't see it going to Comic Con,

49:50.580 --> 49:54.140
not in a long shot. I don't see it. Do you think somebody else is going to start

49:54.140 --> 49:55.780
something that's similar to E3?

49:55.780 --> 50:00.380
Well we already have something going as much of its East Coast as we were screaming

50:00.380 --> 50:02.340
about in the chat room earlier tonight, which was

50:02.340 --> 50:05.620
Digital Life. What makes you think Digital Life is going to be the new E3?

50:05.620 --> 50:10.620
Well first off, it only takes like 25 bucks to get in for the full weekend.

50:10.620 --> 50:13.660
It's spacious and it's like you got

50:13.660 --> 50:17.700
Gaming in one section talk about the latest technology on one

50:18.200 --> 50:23.640
Nothing, but free demos of stuff to walk away with plus you have freaking cosplayers. They're having a great time

50:25.160 --> 50:27.160
Hmm

50:28.000 --> 50:31.120
What so this is a show that's open to the public yeah

50:33.120 --> 50:38.200
Is this the direction that a show like e3 or whatever hopes to become the next e3

50:38.200 --> 50:42.660
Is that a direction that they should be taking is to be a public show you think I?

50:42.660 --> 50:47.500
I tend to think so. I mean the way they have this have it up like maybe the first day

50:48.100 --> 50:52.340
Important industry people only then open to the public for everyone else. I

50:52.860 --> 50:57.980
Don't think so. Why not? Well, if you do e3 public, it's gonna be a clusterfuck

50:57.980 --> 51:04.140
I mean think of how it is right now just with how many people are there. Can you imagine like double that?

51:04.660 --> 51:07.700
You yes, I can it's called New York Comic Con

51:10.440 --> 51:11.780
Interesting

51:11.780 --> 51:16.980
Well anyway in New York City, but then again, you know, LA is pretty big too and is a you know

51:16.980 --> 51:21.820
Good place to have something like that. So I don't know how much bigger New York City could be. I mean, yes, it's New York City

51:22.100 --> 51:24.100
There's no, you know

51:24.540 --> 51:26.700
Shortage of places to stay or anything like that

51:26.700 --> 51:27.740
But it's you know

51:27.740 --> 51:33.220
I don't know you see on plus side New York City is like this melt all types of great stuff

51:33.220 --> 51:37.220
But on the downside where the Jacob Javits Center is for digital life

51:37.220 --> 51:42.120
It's like in a 15-minute walk to the most local hotel unless you cross the

51:42.120 --> 51:46.100
river to Jersey. I mean for something like this you'd have to bank on the fact

51:46.100 --> 51:51.560
that most people will be taking the bus and the subways to get to and fro.

51:51.560 --> 51:57.160
Well interesting. It actually generates more revenue for the city.

51:57.160 --> 52:00.560
I hope so because they're not raising, they're not hiking up the fares

52:00.560 --> 52:03.680
for another year. Do you see something like that realistically happening in the

52:03.680 --> 52:07.500
next couple years the show getting bigger and bigger and yeah I tend to

52:07.500 --> 52:11.540
think so yeah all right well we'll see what happens if it gets big enough we'll

52:11.540 --> 52:14.900
have to come out there you know that of course I have to send you my list of all

52:14.900 --> 52:19.020
the cons I'm hitting up next year so you can come on out hey of course with no E3

52:19.020 --> 52:21.980
this year that might mean I can make an East Coast con exactly that's what I'm

52:21.980 --> 52:25.700
thinking too is like hey travel budget back so maybe I can go somewhere so I

52:25.700 --> 52:29.740
you know in digital life something I've been wanting to do for a while and it's

52:29.740 --> 52:32.580
It's like a geek's paradise.

52:32.580 --> 52:37.900
The first day I went, they had teams from local high schools having a contest of how

52:37.900 --> 52:42.220
fast they could build a computer from start to finish, including boot up to Windows.

52:42.220 --> 52:46.360
And I just realized I'm going to be in New York City in October, and I haven't said anything

52:46.360 --> 52:50.060
about this on the show yet, but I'm planning on going to New York City in October, but

52:50.060 --> 52:51.060
it's the wrong weekend.

52:51.060 --> 52:52.060
I won't be there for digital life.

52:52.060 --> 52:53.060
It's going to be towards the end of October.

52:53.060 --> 52:54.060
What date?

52:54.060 --> 52:55.060
I don't know for sure yet.

52:55.060 --> 52:59.180
I'll have more details later, because I'll definitely go to the Nintendo store or something

52:59.180 --> 53:00.660
and meet fans if they want to come out.

53:00.660 --> 53:02.860
I'll be at Y-Con.

53:02.860 --> 53:04.260
I'll be your security guard.

53:04.260 --> 53:08.900
Alright, uh, yeah, so, oh god, I shouldn't have said anything on the New York City thing.

53:08.900 --> 53:12.220
Yeah, that's going to happen in October, but I'll say more about that later.

53:12.220 --> 53:13.220
But anything else?

53:13.220 --> 53:14.220
SkyCon, New York City.

53:14.220 --> 53:15.220
Whatever.

53:15.220 --> 53:17.580
Anything else you want to say?

53:17.580 --> 53:21.460
That's basically it, and I'm loving the show, because if you didn't notice, I was feeling

53:21.460 --> 53:23.980
sick earlier, but listening made me feel better, so.

53:23.980 --> 53:26.260
Laughter heals everything.

53:26.260 --> 53:27.260
Thank you so much.

53:27.260 --> 53:28.260
Appreciate it.

53:28.260 --> 53:30.260
All right, nurse.

53:30.260 --> 53:31.260
Later.

53:31.260 --> 53:32.260
Oh, you know what?

53:32.260 --> 53:33.260
Let's move E3 to YowieCon.

53:33.260 --> 53:34.260
I like that idea.

53:34.260 --> 53:36.940
Ooh, that's a pretty boy nookie.

53:36.940 --> 53:38.780
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

53:38.780 --> 53:39.780
Who's this?

53:39.780 --> 53:40.780
Hi.

53:40.780 --> 53:41.780
This is Eddie.

53:41.780 --> 53:42.780
Hi, Eddie.

53:42.780 --> 53:43.780
What's on your mind, buddy?

53:43.780 --> 53:48.460
I just wanted to comment on the E3 going public thing.

53:48.460 --> 53:51.180
Realistically, I really don't think that's going to happen.

53:51.180 --> 53:57.580
I mean, E3 is there for industry people to get stuff done.

53:57.580 --> 54:03.020
And if you have one day that's open to the industry and the rest is open to the public,

54:03.020 --> 54:06.740
I don't think there's enough time for people to get things done.

54:06.740 --> 54:11.960
And well, if they open it to both the industry and the public at the same time, the industry

54:11.960 --> 54:17.580
people doesn't want to be tripping over all these fanboys who are there to see the latest

54:17.580 --> 54:18.580
game.

54:18.580 --> 54:19.580
Right.

54:19.580 --> 54:21.160
So what would your suggestion be for the independents?

54:21.160 --> 54:24.500
What do the Kenshi folks do now?

54:24.500 --> 54:31.540
I actually think the IndyCon is a pretty good idea, but I still don't think it should be

54:31.540 --> 54:32.540
open to the public.

54:32.540 --> 54:42.280
I think it should still be an industry-only thing where publishers can't go to find new

54:42.280 --> 54:45.580
materials to publish, I guess.

54:45.580 --> 54:46.580
Alright.

54:46.580 --> 54:49.620
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

54:49.620 --> 54:50.620
No, not really.

54:50.620 --> 54:51.620
Alright.

54:51.620 --> 54:52.620
Well, thanks for your thoughts.

54:52.620 --> 54:53.620
Yeah.

54:53.620 --> 54:55.420
It's not a problem.

54:55.420 --> 54:58.420
We like doing it, because fine folks like yourself call us every week.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.420
All right.

54:59.420 --> 55:00.420
All right, have a good one, buddy.

55:00.420 --> 55:01.420
Thank you.

55:01.420 --> 55:02.420
Later.

55:02.420 --> 55:03.420
We'll do one more call.

55:03.420 --> 55:04.420
All right.

55:04.420 --> 55:06.340
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

55:06.340 --> 55:07.340
Who's this?

55:07.340 --> 55:08.460
It's Ravenstaufen again.

55:08.460 --> 55:09.460
Sorry about that.

55:09.460 --> 55:10.460
That's all right.

55:10.460 --> 55:11.460
Much better connection.

55:11.460 --> 55:12.460
Porn torrents off this time?

55:12.460 --> 55:13.460
Yes.

55:13.460 --> 55:14.460
Much better.

55:14.460 --> 55:15.460
All right.

55:15.460 --> 55:16.460
Porno tubes off?

55:16.460 --> 55:17.460
Yes.

55:17.460 --> 55:18.460
Excellent.

55:18.460 --> 55:19.460
Porno tubes off.

55:19.460 --> 55:20.460
All right.

55:20.460 --> 55:21.460
Let's try this again.

55:21.460 --> 55:22.460
What did you want to call in about?

55:22.460 --> 55:23.460
E3.

55:23.460 --> 55:30.060
to going to be canceled I think it's going to be downsized. Oh no we never

55:30.060 --> 55:34.900
said canceled. Oh well okay well yeah we did we said we said canceled as we know

55:34.900 --> 55:40.100
it. I have no doubt the ESA is gonna do something but the question is is that

55:40.100 --> 55:43.260
something going to be good enough and that's what I ask you is that something

55:43.260 --> 55:49.180
going to be good enough? I don't know I I think I don't know it might be bad news

55:49.180 --> 55:53.980
for Nintendo and Sony, don't they have like these splatchy plazads and everything to go

55:53.980 --> 55:55.620
all out for this thing?

55:55.620 --> 56:00.620
Yes, but what's to stop Nintendo from doing a, you know, well hell, they're doing their

56:00.620 --> 56:02.060
Fusion Tour.

56:02.060 --> 56:06.100
I mean they can take that stuff on the road, and rumor is there was something going around

56:06.100 --> 56:10.580
on one of the, Kotaku or something, saying that they were going to be doing a special

56:10.580 --> 56:11.580
tour.

56:11.580 --> 56:13.380
I don't know if it was the Fusion Tour or something separate, but they were going to

56:13.380 --> 56:14.380
take their show on the road.

56:14.380 --> 56:18.180
There's nothing to stop Sony from doing something similar, having a huge event in LA.

56:18.180 --> 56:20.260
All these guys could still do press conferences.

56:20.260 --> 56:22.900
It's just going to be weird because E3 kind of brought it

56:22.900 --> 56:24.220
all together.

56:24.220 --> 56:27.440
And now you're going to have, I think at least in 2007,

56:27.440 --> 56:30.340
you're just going to have a clusterfuck of all these random events.

56:30.340 --> 56:32.180
It's going to be really weird.

56:32.180 --> 56:34.180
That's going to be funny, all this clusterfuck

56:34.180 --> 56:35.740
of all these things.

56:35.740 --> 56:39.260
It might be an interesting time in 2007.

56:39.260 --> 56:42.020
True, but for us little guys who don't really

56:42.020 --> 56:46.940
have a travel budget, who like to bring the news to you guys, we're screwed.

56:46.940 --> 56:48.260
I mean, maybe not so much us.

56:48.260 --> 56:50.900
We're fortunate enough to be in the Bay Area-ish.

56:50.900 --> 56:52.660
I mean, Bay Area is a 90-minute drive.

56:52.660 --> 56:55.360
So realistically, we can get to most events over there pretty

56:55.360 --> 56:55.860
easy.

56:55.860 --> 56:59.300
But I feel sorry for a lot of other folks

56:59.300 --> 57:01.460
who don't have that same luxury being able to drive.

57:01.460 --> 57:02.940
And not every company is in the Bay Area.

57:02.940 --> 57:04.980
Some are in LA, which is a little harder to get to.

57:04.980 --> 57:07.860
And some are in, you know, what, Canada, other countries.

57:07.860 --> 57:10.700
Hell, one of the nicest people we talked to at E3 this year

57:10.700 --> 57:13.540
were those folks from Spain that were developed in the,

57:13.540 --> 57:14.100
what was it?

57:14.100 --> 57:15.820
It was like American Pie Meets Grand Theft Auto.

57:15.820 --> 57:21.280
I can't remember the name of the game now, but what was it called summer something that summer summer heat or something?

57:21.280 --> 57:25.720
Yeah, it was it was funny cuz I had a lot of a guy stealing a panties on the cover. It was funny

57:25.720 --> 57:31.240
I think I'll show our listeners ravens dolphin. Yeah, you left this out of your note

57:31.760 --> 57:33.760
PSP got a firmware update

57:34.520 --> 57:42.260
2.2 point eight last week. Yeah. Yeah, go listen last week show buddy. Uh, it came out. I mean, oh, yeah

57:42.260 --> 57:46.260
Oh yeah, we didn't have it on the show the other night because we already talked about that it was coming out.

57:46.260 --> 57:48.260
What do you think? Did you download it?

57:48.260 --> 57:54.260
It's on the PSP. I have to put it in. I didn't really have a chance to test it out yet.

57:54.260 --> 57:58.260
Alright, call us back next week after you've tested it out because I haven't upgraded mine yet. I'm a little lazy.

57:58.260 --> 58:03.260
Oh, one more thing about the PSP and the DS Lite sales.

58:03.260 --> 58:04.260
Go for it. Yeah.

58:04.260 --> 58:08.260
Well, this is my opinion why the DS is doing better

58:08.260 --> 58:12.300
because it's targeted to little kids and people that like

58:12.300 --> 58:16.180
things. Nintendo's a little kid company. I'm not being mean, that's what they say.

58:16.180 --> 58:19.780
Okay. It's a family-friendly company.

58:19.780 --> 58:23.340
Yeah, it's a family-friendly company and when people see it they go,

58:23.340 --> 58:26.620
ah, friendly. But then Sony has

58:26.620 --> 58:30.180
family-friendly stuff on it too. Well, yeah.

58:30.180 --> 58:34.040
But they also have Grand Theft Auto. Sony's looking for that luxury liner. They

58:34.040 --> 58:35.480
They want you to get your money.

58:35.480 --> 58:37.680
This thing is not cheap either.

58:37.680 --> 58:40.800
Alright, well, thanks for sharing your thoughts.

58:40.800 --> 58:41.800
Appreciate it.

58:41.800 --> 58:43.840
Sorry about the bad quality the first time.

58:43.840 --> 58:44.880
That's okay.

58:44.880 --> 58:46.880
It'll be edited out like it was never there.

58:46.880 --> 58:47.880
Oh, thank you.

58:47.880 --> 58:50.560
Our podcast listeners are going to go, what are they talking about?

58:50.560 --> 58:51.640
That first call's not even there.

58:51.640 --> 58:52.640
Have a good one.

58:52.640 --> 58:53.640
You too.

58:53.640 --> 58:54.640
Bye.

58:54.640 --> 58:58.260
Now, I just want our podcast folks to know we really don't edit a lot on the show.

58:58.260 --> 58:59.260
We really don't.

58:59.260 --> 59:00.260
We like to keep things pure here.

59:00.260 --> 59:04.260
the only things we really added out dead air and bad Skype calls and there's a really bad

59:04.260 --> 59:04.860
connection

59:04.860 --> 59:08.700
so just wanted you guys to know that. Alright one more call it's another New Yorker so

59:08.700 --> 59:09.380
this should be fun

59:09.380 --> 59:14.220
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this? It's one and only Legend of Zaku

59:14.220 --> 59:17.940
Oh another New Yorker on the line let me guess Digital Life? New E3?

59:17.940 --> 59:21.900
Yeah of course that's that's obviously that's the same thing I was

59:21.900 --> 59:25.380
yeah same thing as Rama said. Alright then what are your thoughts on this why is

59:25.380 --> 59:28.500
Digital Life to be the new E3 besides the fact it's in your backyard?

59:28.500 --> 59:34.820
Basically is I mean you're breaking down e3 and spreading it across the country. That's pretty much what is gonna happen next year

59:36.100 --> 59:42.420
I'm gonna restate this. I'm gonna you know, I'm gonna second the statements. I already said it's a cluster fuck. It'll be a

59:43.180 --> 59:45.180
What will happen is is that?

59:45.260 --> 59:50.900
The elements that made e3 really successful in the in the earlier days in the in the first few ones

59:51.020 --> 59:56.380
Like, you know allowing the public to to go in is basically gonna help the little you know

59:56.380 --> 01:00:01.180
the other smaller shows which are gonna just they're gonna steal E3's lightning

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:06.180
like that and E3 on the other hand will now you know it's a wake-up call for

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:09.500
them it's a wake-up call for the industry for the you know for the fact

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:14.340
that this show went out it was just flooded with hype too much fat when

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:19.320
basically the whole purpose of E3 was to focus on you know the hardcore content

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:23.420
Zaku when was the public ever allowed in E3? I think in the earlier days

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:29.700
according to the Wikipedia it wasn't really that the public was allowed but I

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.980
mean my understanding is it was pretty easy to get in yes that's basically what

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:37.460
I'm saying okay let me restate that it was a lot easier to get all right fine

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:42.940
whatever okay so basically by adding the element of having the public involved

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:46.860
then you build a pipe you bring the hype to the people directly but at the same

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.340
time we're not one of the dangers about that is that people are gonna play these

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:55.620
demos at E3 and then go, well that game sucks, and when it wasn't really half finished.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:59.500
The problem is that it's just too many people that aren't supposed to be there, and that's

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:04.540
one of the risks associated with opening a show of that magnitude to the public.

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.020
It will be too crowded.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.260
I want to hear from some developers.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:11.280
I'm excited for tomorrow, Monday, because I'm excited to hear from some developers about

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:16.780
what their plans are, because you know the commercial gaming folks that have access to

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.840
people like that are going to be asking those questions.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:24.520
I'm really curious to see what they say the big three will do right they'll create their own shows with the same hype as e3

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:29.960
Yeah, and it's basically God. I hope I have enough frequent flyer miles. Yeah, that's true

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:35.640
If anything you could just outsource your your journalists, you know, you're you're reporting to other people online

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:36.480
Hey

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:43.560
we've always said we've always said we love to get reports from other people that can go to shows like this when we can't but

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.320
Nobody knows it

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:52.300
Yeah, but this would be a good call then to reiterate that well here is consider it reiterated email me

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:59.880
You can email myself personally or seal mail the mailbag. Hell. Yeah email Loki. He'll say sure go for it. Hey

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.340
But you do the mailbag. So yeah

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:07.360
No email 23rd maggots, so he'll make sure we find out

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:14.800
That's the best way to do it, by just spreading out, having like a network.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:20.140
And so basically you'll come down to that, it'll be spread out.

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:24.800
When you're covering these shows, follow the OL Army principle of don't be a dick.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:28.720
And remember, you don't represent Orange Lounge Radio, I just want to let the listeners

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.120
know that.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.600
But if you want to send us fan stuff out there that you taped for us as a gift to us, go

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.600
for it.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600
Love it.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:41.600
I mean, you can count all these other guys as contributors, and that's basically what we'll become anyways.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600
Yeah, works for me.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.600
Nothing but good contributors.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.600
Alright, Zaku, then go to Digital Life at your camcorder and send us some stuff back, alright?

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.600
I'll get you something from there, like I did last year.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.600
Sounds- oh, that's right, our poster, remember, from Digital Life last year, so.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.600
Alright, it's hanging up right here, right over Jamie's head.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600
Right.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.600
In all of its Illustrator glory.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.600
Hanging right next to the Jay and Silent Bob, all you motherfuckers are gonna pay.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.800
are going to pay. You are the one who is going to wear the Bollicker's poster. Alright, Zaku,

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:19.120
have a good one. Alright, you too. Bye. Well, that was an animated Skype line tonight. Half

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.360
the calls were from New York City. I love New York City. Not a problem with New York

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.520
City. I'm looking forward to going there very soon. New York City? Somebody get a rope.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.200
I haven't been to New York since I was in high school.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.200
It's a fun place. I played at Carnegie Hall. There's always stuff to do in New York City.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.840
It's true. Any last minute stories before we get into the final story of the night?

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.120
I don't think so.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.600
Then I guess we go to the final story of the night. Oh, I'm sorry,

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.720
I did have one. You lie! No, I was

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.640
not lying. It's impossible! I was gonna mention there's a demo out there now

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.040
if you have upgraded your PSP the firmware 2.8 for mercury meltdown

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.960
so you can check that out for free and

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.920
so I don't know I thought that was kind of neat not a

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.080
reason I would go and upgrade mine to 2.8 although I should because

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.680
I don't know I have nothing better to do with it but um

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.120
yeah check it out anyways

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.400
no that's it alright then let's go to our last story of the evening

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.400
let's let's talk about what's wrong with this world

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.240
and why Brazil just couldn't win the World Cup

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.040
well the reason why they couldn't win the World Cup

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.360
sex and PlayStation 2

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:46.760
that's right. At least that's what they're blaming and I thought that was kind of funny

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.360
but anywho

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.680
yeah so

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:59.720
Apparently, the reason why they're, you know, lead footballers out there, you know, getting

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:05.200
too sexed up, which is apparently, I guess, against their rules during the World Cup,

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:11.740
and playing too much FIFA 06 on PlayStation 2.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:17.400
Good at the game, but not good at the actual game, so it kinda sucks for him.
