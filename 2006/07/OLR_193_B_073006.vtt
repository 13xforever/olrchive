00:19.851 --> 00:23.792
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 193.

00:24.312 --> 00:27.513
[SPEAKER_02]: Inching closer and closer to that magic 200 number.

00:29.103 --> 00:32.505

00:32.905 --> 00:35.806

00:57.642 --> 00:59.723
[SPEAKER_02]: And now let's get back into some gaming news.

00:59.763 --> 01:03.364
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start us off, if you guys are okay with that, DarkSakura and Loki.

01:03.784 --> 01:04.424
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, no.

01:04.625 --> 01:05.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, go ahead.

01:05.285 --> 01:07.105
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't talk a lot last segment about the Wii.

01:07.426 --> 01:09.526
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to bring up a story about the Wii.

01:09.566 --> 01:15.989
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a rumor going around, and I emphasize the word rumor here, that Nintendo is sending out free Wii dev kits.

01:16.069 --> 01:19.430
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a rumor from an insider that wrote to Kotaku.com.

01:20.150 --> 01:25.014
[SPEAKER_02]: According to Kotaku, it seems Nintendo is giving Wii development kits to smaller studios.

01:25.634 --> 01:32.259
[SPEAKER_02]: A developer in a coastal American city apparently received a package from Nintendo, and nobody was aware what was even inside.

01:32.319 --> 01:35.221
[SPEAKER_02]: But the box was opened, and there was a Wii dev kit inside.

01:35.734 --> 01:37.775
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this could be seen multiple ways.

01:37.795 --> 01:52.005
[SPEAKER_02]: This might be a way for we to get indie developers to make games for the console, and it certainly would show a shift in Nintendo's attitude towards third-party supporters, maybe recognizing where some of the mistakes were with the GameCube.

01:52.045 --> 01:56.508
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, hey, we really want third parties, indies, everybody on board with this.

01:56.548 --> 02:01.292
[SPEAKER_02]: So, certainly interesting if it's true, but it may not be true.

02:01.352 --> 02:01.752
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still

02:02.584 --> 02:03.424
[SPEAKER_02]: A rumor at this time.

02:03.444 --> 02:05.085
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the dev kits weren't that expensive anyways.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.025
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they were like a grand or two.

02:07.065 --> 02:10.126
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would hope not, considering the hardware is supposed to not be as much.

02:10.527 --> 02:15.608
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they put out an email now that has their DS lineup.

02:16.508 --> 02:16.988
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, cool!

02:19.029 --> 02:19.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what's coming out.

02:20.429 --> 02:28.392
[SPEAKER_03]: There is October 9th Clubhouse Games, Nintendogs Dalmatian version on October 16th, October 23rd Magical Star Sign,

02:29.486 --> 02:32.047
[SPEAKER_03]: In 30th, there's a Pokemon Ranger and Children of Mana.

02:32.167 --> 02:33.408
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Children of Mana.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.289
[SPEAKER_03]: November 6th has Elite Beat Agents.

02:36.809 --> 02:37.930
[SPEAKER_03]: 13th, Yoshi's Island.

02:37.970 --> 02:41.671
[SPEAKER_03]: December 4th is Custom Robo Arena and Kirby's Squeak Squad.

02:41.691 --> 02:45.012
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's pretty awesome about that Clubhouse Games?

02:45.273 --> 02:45.553
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

02:45.793 --> 02:49.834
[SPEAKER_09]: It's over Wi-Fi with all 48 games that are going to be in it.

02:49.994 --> 02:50.355
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:51.495 --> 02:55.397
[SPEAKER_09]: And, which might come into the show, PictoChat over Wi-Fi.

02:56.810 --> 02:57.490
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right.

02:57.530 --> 02:58.610
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember hearing about that.

02:59.110 --> 03:00.871
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't this game already out somewhere else?

03:00.911 --> 03:02.191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called something else in other countries.

03:02.231 --> 03:03.211
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's coming out in the UK.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.732
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called 48 Collection or something like that.

03:05.772 --> 03:06.572
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:06.592 --> 03:08.752
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I first read about the game, that's what it was called.

03:09.112 --> 03:11.233
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, none of these games are nothing spectacular, right?

03:11.273 --> 03:15.353
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of reminds me of those Hoyle collections that are available on the PC.

03:15.433 --> 03:20.194
[SPEAKER_02]: But being able to play it over Wi-Fi with PictoChat, hooray.

03:21.154 --> 03:23.555
[SPEAKER_02]: Drawn genitalia galore while playing Hearts.

03:24.545 --> 03:25.026
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer Camp

03:42.458 --> 03:45.241
[SPEAKER_02]: and Nintendo is actually holding a summer camp of their own.

03:46.121 --> 03:47.503
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Camp Hyrule.

03:47.803 --> 03:49.324
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's not a real camp.

03:49.524 --> 03:51.306
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously it's about video games.

03:51.406 --> 03:53.027
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, the idea is to stay indoors.

03:53.388 --> 03:54.649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a virtual camp.

03:55.089 --> 03:57.131
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not a lot is known about this.

03:57.211 --> 03:59.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Camp Hyrule is going to have activities like

03:59.773 --> 04:00.874
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.

04:00.934 --> 04:01.895
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.

04:22.731 --> 04:23.773
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a quote here, though.

04:24.314 --> 04:35.190
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like to talk about video games, play practical jokes, and rub elbows with Nintendo's expert gamers, then get ready to meet new friends at Nintendo's Camp Hyrule 2006 and win prizes like T-shirts and magazines.

04:35.551 --> 04:36.933
[SPEAKER_02]: Subscriptions while you're at it.

04:38.255 --> 04:47.661
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming the week of August 14th through 18th, 2006, the rumored theme this year might be The Legend of Zelda, The Phantom Hourglass, Nintendo Wii, and Super Mario Galaxy.

04:48.082 --> 04:53.225
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting because I noticed in DarkSakura's list of what's coming out for the DS, Phantom Hourglass wasn't even there.

04:53.725 --> 04:55.427
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know what that means.

04:55.447 --> 04:57.748
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was rumors that it was going to be delayed until next year.

04:58.849 --> 04:59.069
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

04:59.793 --> 05:03.116
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, now Blaze Revolution in chat says Camp Hyrule is nothing new.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.577
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been doing it for at least five years.

05:04.617 --> 05:05.658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they've been doing it for a while.

05:05.678 --> 05:05.798
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

05:05.838 --> 05:06.459
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of it.

05:06.919 --> 05:07.460
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they do?

05:07.780 --> 05:08.140
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

05:08.340 --> 05:09.021
[SPEAKER_02]: How did I miss this?

05:09.041 --> 05:10.422
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing this show how long now?

05:10.502 --> 05:11.583
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never heard of this.

05:12.083 --> 05:12.284
[SPEAKER_09]: Ever.

05:12.544 --> 05:18.929
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is on the Nintendo site, Nintendo.com, so if you don't read that site, you probably won't.

05:19.330 --> 05:21.311
[SPEAKER_02]: I do sometimes, but I don't know.

05:21.331 --> 05:21.912
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, fine.

05:22.212 --> 05:25.014
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apparently have been living in a cave the past ten years, so fine.

05:25.995 --> 05:27.336
[SPEAKER_02]: Are any of you guys doing Camp Hyrule?

05:27.857 --> 05:27.997
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

05:28.476 --> 05:28.636
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

05:28.816 --> 05:29.837
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't sign up either.

05:30.878 --> 05:32.399
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, eh, investment of my time.

05:32.639 --> 05:33.060
[SPEAKER_02]: You might?

05:33.280 --> 05:33.580
[SPEAKER_02]: I might.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.561
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody needs to do it.

05:34.661 --> 05:35.241
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone has to.

05:35.642 --> 05:35.962
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

05:35.982 --> 05:37.783
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to go represent the OL Army for us.

05:38.064 --> 05:38.424
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

05:38.624 --> 05:41.306
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I remember Nestor and Howard.

05:41.346 --> 05:42.327
[SPEAKER_08]: I could get on this.

05:42.347 --> 05:43.328
[SPEAKER_02]: Pimp the damn show.

05:43.748 --> 05:44.489
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I mean.

05:44.529 --> 05:45.149
[SPEAKER_02]: We need our folks.

05:45.389 --> 05:46.530
[SPEAKER_02]: We need an OLR cabin.

05:47.391 --> 05:47.711
[SPEAKER_02]: We need it.

05:48.112 --> 05:48.432
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck it.

05:48.472 --> 05:49.713
[SPEAKER_08]: We need Camp OLR.

05:49.893 --> 05:50.193
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.434
[SPEAKER_08]: OL Army, assemble.

05:52.075 --> 05:54.757
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be on that chess board in front of your apartment complex.

05:55.832 --> 05:57.813
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally want to have a Campo LR.

05:57.833 --> 05:58.493
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

05:58.573 --> 06:03.296
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I want to do a real con thing or something, but we'll see.

06:03.416 --> 06:04.016
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange con?

06:06.397 --> 06:07.038
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange con.

06:07.058 --> 06:07.778
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be rad.

06:08.458 --> 06:11.080
[SPEAKER_02]: Someday, when we have lots and lots of money, we'll see what happens.

06:13.261 --> 06:21.225
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, but one thing that did happen is an AMD and ATI merger.

06:21.245 --> 06:22.746
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your enthusiasm, by the way.

06:23.166 --> 06:23.586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but...

06:23.945 --> 06:25.787
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.

06:26.427 --> 06:29.089
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, great transition.

06:29.369 --> 06:29.990
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you, Loki.

06:30.750 --> 06:46.323
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, yes, the $5.4 billion transaction took place last week with AMD purchasing ATI, and now you've got a big combination of both processors and graphics chips.

06:46.923 --> 06:47.884
[SPEAKER_09]: Where will this lead?

06:48.525 --> 06:49.525
[SPEAKER_09]: Who the fuck knows?

06:49.665 --> 06:51.547
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where it's going to lead.

06:52.045 --> 06:59.610
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably going to see some ATI-based graphics chips on AMD motherboards.

07:01.451 --> 07:01.671
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

07:02.412 --> 07:05.534
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is great news, though, for your PC gamer, I guess.

07:05.654 --> 07:11.118
[SPEAKER_09]: But I always used to buy AMD chips for my PCs and ATI cards.

07:11.218 --> 07:12.799
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess that works.

07:14.760 --> 07:15.100
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

07:17.782 --> 07:21.905
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm worried about, what if you're an AMD user with an NVIDIA video card?

07:23.409 --> 07:23.589
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh.

07:25.470 --> 07:26.450
[SPEAKER_09]: Then fuck you.

07:26.510 --> 07:27.230
[SPEAKER_09]: You suck.

07:27.751 --> 07:28.151
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

07:28.171 --> 07:29.391
[SPEAKER_03]: Then go buy a Mac.

07:31.632 --> 07:32.632
[SPEAKER_09]: Go buy a Mac.

07:34.593 --> 07:35.313
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on here.

07:36.493 --> 07:38.094
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get back on the Sandy bus.

07:39.594 --> 07:40.355
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, listen.

07:40.435 --> 07:42.495
[SPEAKER_03]: I get my Mac in very soon.

07:42.535 --> 07:43.276
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it.

07:43.296 --> 07:47.757
[SPEAKER_02]: Just when I thought the hate mail for Loki would stop coming in.

07:50.378 --> 07:50.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

07:50.838 --> 07:50.978
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

07:51.730 --> 07:53.932
[SPEAKER_03]: How about we just turn this right around?

07:53.992 --> 07:56.273
[SPEAKER_09]: How about we turn this bus around right now?

07:56.594 --> 07:58.535
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about PCs and gaming.

07:59.456 --> 08:00.316
[SPEAKER_09]: Mac wouldn't be in there.

08:00.817 --> 08:03.699
[SPEAKER_09]: Gee, I wish somebody had a story to save us right about now.

08:03.999 --> 08:06.241
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that female otaku need love too?

08:07.001 --> 08:07.302
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

08:07.382 --> 08:09.003
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan, you can rent a friend.

08:11.124 --> 08:11.545
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait.

08:11.865 --> 08:13.806
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they horny gamer girls?

08:14.147 --> 08:15.748
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, did you find out about this on Myspace?

08:17.229 --> 08:17.329
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

08:18.126 --> 08:18.726
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Kotaku.

08:19.047 --> 08:19.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

08:19.587 --> 08:20.007
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as bad.

08:20.067 --> 08:20.407
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

08:20.427 --> 08:21.308
[SPEAKER_03]: How much?

08:21.728 --> 08:23.169
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you, Kotaku.

08:23.449 --> 08:24.430
[SPEAKER_02]: They're cool.

08:24.870 --> 08:25.490
[SPEAKER_03]: Five dollars.

08:26.571 --> 08:26.891
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

08:27.091 --> 08:31.274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually 12,000 yen for two and a half hours of friendship.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.034
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait.

08:32.194 --> 08:34.696
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, but this is not like a whore thing.

08:34.756 --> 08:35.276
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

08:35.316 --> 08:36.857
[SPEAKER_02]: This is girls for other girls.

08:37.898 --> 08:40.579
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called the Secret Otaku Support Commission.

08:41.139 --> 08:47.203
[SPEAKER_03]: They rent out women who are knowledgeable in video game culture to girl gamers who got no friends.

08:47.679 --> 08:55.321
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to pay for friends, I join a frat.

08:55.401 --> 08:57.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, so many college memories just came back to me.

08:57.702 --> 09:03.124
[SPEAKER_03]: As it's said by Seiji Hirokawa, who is their creator and operator.

09:03.504 --> 09:04.644
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny that it's a man.

09:06.685 --> 09:10.826
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, we're an otaku dispatch agency that caters exclusively to female clientele.

09:11.246 --> 09:16.128
[SPEAKER_03]: Many women otaku don't have other women otaku to talk to, and they get pretty lonely.

09:16.168 --> 09:16.968
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we come in.

09:18.432 --> 09:24.253
[SPEAKER_03]: They charge 12,000 yen, basically 120 bucks for two and a half hours of friendship.

09:24.593 --> 09:27.274
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you a lonely, lonely girl?

09:27.294 --> 09:28.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick up the phone!

09:28.394 --> 09:33.395
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been a bad, lonely girl playing your video games all night long?

09:34.096 --> 09:37.016
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want someone to play your games with?

09:37.536 --> 09:40.437
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want someone to come over and have a pillow fight with you?

09:41.277 --> 09:44.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Otaku Female Rental Service is for you!

09:45.492 --> 09:46.832
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very... I don't know.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.333
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just something kind of scary about it.

09:48.353 --> 09:52.554
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just the cultural difference or whatever, but there's something almost predatory about this whole thing.

09:52.915 --> 09:53.295
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

09:53.515 --> 09:54.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just me?

09:54.935 --> 09:55.976
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, would you pay for this?

09:56.736 --> 09:57.496
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have friends.

09:58.737 --> 09:59.117
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

09:59.777 --> 10:00.517
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd pay for that.

10:00.817 --> 10:01.117
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

10:01.137 --> 10:02.118
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a pillow fight this weekend.

10:02.138 --> 10:02.498
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot.

10:03.158 --> 10:05.119
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway... Rob, shh.

10:05.939 --> 10:11.141
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm not too surprised that a man is selling women to, you know, clientele.

10:11.161 --> 10:14.302
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, pimps have been around for ages, so... But...

10:15.250 --> 10:25.612
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm really surprised about is why an Asian chick that likes games and otaku stuff can't get some nerdy guy to be her friend.

10:25.652 --> 10:26.752
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on.

10:27.353 --> 10:29.653
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where we need to be importing them, okay?

10:29.733 --> 10:31.453
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like, you know, there's Russian wives.

10:31.894 --> 10:34.434
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to get the Asian gamer chicks to come in.

10:34.874 --> 10:39.015
[SPEAKER_09]: Import them in, you know, and... Because we've got the demand here.

10:39.215 --> 10:40.335
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the supply there.

10:40.755 --> 10:41.336
[SPEAKER_09]: It's perfect.

10:41.696 --> 10:42.156
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw that.

10:42.176 --> 10:43.156
[SPEAKER_08]: Just export me.

10:45.424 --> 10:45.964
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done with that.

10:47.466 --> 10:48.006
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

10:48.046 --> 10:48.707
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we look into that?

10:48.747 --> 10:49.207
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

10:50.748 --> 10:51.129
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

10:54.852 --> 10:55.692
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

10:56.513 --> 10:58.155
[SPEAKER_09]: That is excellent news.

10:59.576 --> 11:00.076
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm scared.

11:00.116 --> 11:01.998
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the chat room's got the wrong idea of me.

11:02.218 --> 11:03.899
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Justin in our chat room.

11:03.919 --> 11:04.840
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how else to pronounce it.

11:04.860 --> 11:06.461
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just Justin, but it's in elite speak.

11:06.501 --> 11:07.322
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Justin.

11:08.003 --> 11:10.905
[SPEAKER_02]: Justin says, I think Sky is suited well for a phone sex line.

11:10.925 --> 11:12.947
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of scary to me.

11:13.607 --> 11:14.488
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not my bag, baby.

11:15.942 --> 11:16.402
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

11:16.623 --> 11:17.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please, anyways.

11:17.824 --> 11:28.013
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of women, a certain game coming out soon, Dead Rising, which is awesome, rewards you for...

11:28.874 --> 11:56.732
[SPEAKER_09]: taking erotic pictures of women um actually yeah one of the genres of pictures you can take in the game besides you know horror and drama and stuff like that is erotic erotica and they have a perfect picture of one of the leads in there i guess in fishnet stockings and lingerie and uh you're taking pictures of her and one of the focal points is her breasts and it's perfect and you get um prestige points for that it's kind of like experience points in the games but it's kind of interesting though because um

11:57.349 --> 11:59.832
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also take erotic zombie pictures.

12:02.715 --> 12:04.397
[SPEAKER_09]: Erotic zombie pictures?

12:04.497 --> 12:04.817
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

12:05.618 --> 12:06.980
[SPEAKER_09]: Erotic zombie pictures.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.042
[SPEAKER_09]: Why didn't they just call the game that?

12:10.203 --> 12:13.046
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't they just call the damn game erotic zombie pictures?

12:13.127 --> 12:15.089
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how many more copies would have sold?

12:15.109 --> 12:16.510
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a simple 2000 series, okay?

12:16.550 --> 12:17.872
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a cool game.

12:19.709 --> 12:21.910
[SPEAKER_02]: How many more copies would have sold?

12:22.230 --> 12:26.192
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead Rising, you had to tell me about what this game was about before I was interested in it.

12:26.232 --> 12:27.172
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had to see the preview.

12:27.452 --> 12:34.456
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you told me there was a game on the market called Erotic Zombie Pictures, I would have been like, say no more.

12:34.616 --> 12:34.956
[SPEAKER_02]: Sold.

12:35.216 --> 12:35.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Sold!

12:36.837 --> 12:38.097
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know that was your bag.

12:40.618 --> 12:42.499
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think it's pretty awesome.

12:43.539 --> 12:47.061
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, you can also get points by just

12:47.793 --> 12:48.673
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, pretty much doing everything.

12:48.913 --> 12:49.314
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this.

12:49.534 --> 12:52.154
[SPEAKER_09]: This is actually translated from Famitsu Magazine.

12:52.875 --> 12:58.517
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have, it says, and this is the exact, you know, English translation.

12:58.777 --> 13:10.041
[SPEAKER_09]: If the sexy survivor you rescue by the chance arrival which photographs the seductive scene because also sexy acquisition PP increases.

13:10.721 --> 13:11.941
[SPEAKER_09]: PP being prestige points.

13:12.221 --> 13:13.502
[SPEAKER_09]: You dirty bastards out there.

13:14.522 --> 13:16.803
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm, okay.

13:16.903 --> 13:17.283
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it,

13:17.876 --> 13:22.420
[SPEAKER_09]: Just The Woman, also, it is... How can you not comment on that?

13:22.500 --> 13:26.244
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you just overlook that blatant reference there?

13:27.425 --> 13:28.686
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, the debt is rising.

13:29.787 --> 13:30.167
Oh, God.

13:33.050 --> 13:33.750
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah.

13:33.871 --> 13:36.193
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio, everybody.

13:36.433 --> 13:38.094
[SPEAKER_02]: It was lovely knowing you these past four years.

13:38.174 --> 13:42.999
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the jokes, we've suffocated ourselves on the bad jokes tonight, and we're dying.

13:43.099 --> 13:44.200
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be an awesome game.

13:45.503 --> 13:46.344
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna be an awesome game.

13:46.464 --> 13:48.485
[SPEAKER_09]: Just buy it for the awesomeness in the game.

13:49.225 --> 13:53.748
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I knew right away when they saw the little publicity shots of who the characters are gonna be in the game.

13:53.789 --> 13:57.471
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we're talking like horny otaku women.

13:59.412 --> 14:06.137
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a quote from Mystery Science 3000 to quote in regards to the whole taking pictures of half-naked girls.

14:06.237 --> 14:07.077
[SPEAKER_02]: Erotic zombie pictures?

14:08.218 --> 14:09.219
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whoop-dee-shit.

14:11.921 --> 14:13.041
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your outlook on that?

14:13.262 --> 14:15.263
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you excited to be taking erotic pictures?

14:18.769 --> 14:20.090
[SPEAKER_03]: I love zombies, but not that much.

14:21.871 --> 14:22.652
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce Campbell, yes.

14:23.973 --> 14:25.474
[SPEAKER_03]: I need the human chin to come talk to me.

14:25.494 --> 14:29.337
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you use, like, because you can use anything to kill things in Dead Rising, right?

14:29.357 --> 14:29.437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

14:29.477 --> 14:30.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you use pants?

14:32.059 --> 14:32.479
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

14:33.314 --> 14:39.319
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on if you mean in the American sense or the British sense because if you use someone's stinky pants, then yes, probably.

14:39.339 --> 14:44.144
[SPEAKER_09]: You can dress up like a little kid and you can wear stinky pants.

14:44.224 --> 14:48.007
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, if Bruce Campbell is listening to this podcast, come hang out with us.

14:48.127 --> 14:48.788
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to interview you.

14:49.605 --> 14:50.626
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:05.001 --> 15:07.783
[SPEAKER_09]: The rule, like, it's just weird, okay?

15:07.843 --> 15:09.764
[SPEAKER_09]: You take weird pictures and stuff.

15:10.064 --> 15:13.806
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how far it goes into the erotic stuff, but whatever.

15:14.006 --> 15:16.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, none of this shark jumping talk.

15:16.908 --> 15:17.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, chat room?

15:18.069 --> 15:18.609
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we haven't.

15:18.889 --> 15:19.309
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we haven't.

15:19.550 --> 15:20.290
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

15:20.350 --> 15:22.631
[SPEAKER_02]: If we jump the shark, that happened a long time ago.

15:22.751 --> 15:26.494
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know... If we jump the shark, we are going to literally jump over a shark.

15:26.934 --> 15:28.335
[SPEAKER_02]: We jumped the shark episode two.

15:28.395 --> 15:32.277
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie skipped town on episode two of Orange Launch Radio, if you guys remember.

15:32.677 --> 15:34.118
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, let's move on.

15:34.997 --> 15:35.317
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

15:36.118 --> 15:45.202
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2, how we love thee and your cheap games because there's cheaper games coming out for the PlayStation 2 thanks to a new greatest hits collection.

15:45.582 --> 15:59.868
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, 1999 will buy you Jack X, Combat Racing, SOCOM 3, Sly 3, Honor Among Thieves, Ratchet Deadlocked, and sure to excite folks everywhere, Shadow of the Colossus.

16:01.029 --> 16:01.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

16:03.336 --> 16:11.022
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea when that is supposedly coming out, but it's the next series according to a leak from Circuit City, which I imagine will be very soon.

16:11.102 --> 16:13.363
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll have the release coming soon, probably.

16:13.643 --> 16:13.924
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

16:14.044 --> 16:16.926
[SPEAKER_02]: Also getting greatest hits, I just want to mention real quick, is the PSP.

16:17.526 --> 16:19.327
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are also going to be $19.99.

16:19.488 --> 16:25.952
[SPEAKER_02]: ATV Off-Road Fury, Ape Escape On The Loose, Hot Shots Golf, Twisted Metal Head-On, and Wipeout Pier.

16:26.954 --> 16:28.135
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68 says no Luminous for the lose

16:55.478 --> 16:56.418
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that kind of sucks.

16:56.699 --> 16:59.440
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they want to suck all the money they can out of that stupid thing.

16:59.940 --> 17:00.500
[SPEAKER_09]: But, whatever.

17:01.001 --> 17:03.602
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a personal bone to pick about Luminous.

17:03.782 --> 17:03.962
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

17:04.602 --> 17:06.563
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't get Luminous 2 to install on my phone.

17:07.664 --> 17:09.365
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you tried to get the cell version?

17:09.525 --> 17:09.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

17:09.925 --> 17:10.605
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know it was out.

17:11.226 --> 17:13.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it wouldn't install, stupid network.

17:13.887 --> 17:15.928
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally going to try and see if I can get that game.

17:16.748 --> 17:17.128
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

17:18.089 --> 17:22.191
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, the former manager of Sony's...

17:23.424 --> 17:29.368
[SPEAKER_09]: Third Party Relations has left and actually went to Ubisoft, which is kind of interesting.

17:31.370 --> 17:34.812
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, people leaving Sony, I guess that's not really big news.

17:34.832 --> 17:40.696
[SPEAKER_09]: What is big news is they're saying that they've sent out over 10,000 PS3 dev kits.

17:42.097 --> 17:44.238
[SPEAKER_09]: So, wow, lots of dev kits going out there.

17:45.519 --> 17:47.861
[SPEAKER_09]: But all the dev kits in the world won't make that system any cheaper.

17:49.935 --> 17:52.517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but it might get more games worthy of you to talk about.

17:52.537 --> 17:53.037
[SPEAKER_02]: More games, I'm hoping.

17:53.057 --> 17:54.118
[SPEAKER_09]: More exclusive games.

17:55.299 --> 17:56.800
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a good thing they've sent them out.

17:56.840 --> 18:01.022
[SPEAKER_09]: Because before, I remember they were saying that it's really costly to develop for it.

18:02.623 --> 18:09.447
[SPEAKER_09]: And so those 10,000 dev kits to over 208 companies in 11 countries.

18:10.068 --> 18:10.348
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

18:11.509 --> 18:16.952
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's apparently the largest on any PlayStation platform to date.

18:17.272 --> 18:18.313
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's actually pretty cool.

18:19.312 --> 18:19.933
[SPEAKER_03]: That is pretty cool.

18:20.875 --> 18:25.883
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of cool, and actually, you know, we brought this up last week with the release dates.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.030
[SPEAKER_03]: EA is bringing out Sims 2 Pets.

18:31.453 --> 18:32.655
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some details on this.

18:33.809 --> 18:40.712
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually is going to be a PC expansion, standalone for PS2, GameCube, PSP, Nintendo DS, and Game Boy Advance.

18:41.353 --> 18:47.776
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have kitty cat, and puppy dogs, and guinea pigs, and birds, and whatever else they decide to put in there.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.017
[SPEAKER_03]: You can create... Penguins?

18:51.038 --> 18:51.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, raw penguins.

18:51.958 --> 18:52.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

18:52.939 --> 18:53.259
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

18:53.919 --> 19:01.403
[SPEAKER_03]: You can create your own pet, and customize everything from fur to body, personality, you can make them smart puppies, or...

19:02.073 --> 19:03.474
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid guinea pigs.

19:03.674 --> 19:04.775
[SPEAKER_02]: Evil purple penguins?

19:05.596 --> 19:07.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Rob, evil purple penguins.

19:07.477 --> 19:08.117
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

19:08.238 --> 19:10.719
[SPEAKER_03]: You can name them Bob.

19:12.140 --> 19:14.422
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Ari Masa wants to know snakes?

19:15.023 --> 19:15.523
[SPEAKER_03]: On a plane?

19:17.424 --> 19:18.065
[SPEAKER_02]: Ba-dum-bum.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.486
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

19:19.866 --> 19:26.031
[SPEAKER_03]: You can teach your pets to shake, roll over, play dead, you know, dig up dead bodies, that type of thing.

19:27.172 --> 19:31.595
[SPEAKER_03]: No, if you catch your puppies digging in the garden or scratching up the furniture, you'll have to spank.

19:32.592 --> 19:34.793
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'll be taking them to go get spayed or neutered.

19:35.654 --> 19:43.038
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also use codes where you can share accessories, fur, markings, that type of thing.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.919
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you can make skins for your pets.

19:46.420 --> 19:47.741
[SPEAKER_03]: Different versions will have different things.

19:47.821 --> 19:52.544
[SPEAKER_03]: PC will let you have designer pets like labrapoodles and puggles and schnoodles.

19:54.044 --> 19:56.346
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you breed hamsters with dogs?

19:57.006 --> 19:57.066
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

19:57.086 --> 19:57.426
[SPEAKER_09]: Or cats?

19:57.526 --> 19:57.887
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.208
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I breed a pig with an elephant?

20:00.928 --> 20:01.329
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

20:01.349 --> 20:01.629
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

20:04.111 --> 20:07.652
[SPEAKER_03]: And your creative pet, you can actually create them as unique pedigrees and put them online.

20:09.113 --> 20:15.555
[SPEAKER_03]: They can actually have career paths, which is a show pet security or service with five job levels apiece.

20:16.375 --> 20:20.037
[SPEAKER_03]: The PS2, GameCube, PSP versions will let you take them for a walk in the park.

20:20.377 --> 20:21.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they make friends with other animals.

20:22.297 --> 20:27.919
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the hamster have an employment path of sex toy?

20:28.519 --> 20:28.780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.700
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes with a cardboard tube.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you take erotic pictures of the pets?

20:35.492 --> 20:37.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you kill them by drowning them?

20:37.594 --> 20:42.620
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the PS2, GameCube, and PSP, are all getting like Nintendogs version, basically.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.301
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the parrots have large talons?

20:45.683 --> 20:46.524
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, shut up.

20:47.565 --> 20:54.692
[SPEAKER_03]: On the DS, you can have a pet care center, and other owners can come to have you take care of their pets.

20:54.752 --> 20:56.054
[SPEAKER_03]: You have shops and...

20:56.792 --> 20:59.873
[SPEAKER_03]: You can earn money by having a pet shop, basically.

21:00.453 --> 21:05.674
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Game Boy Advance one will have different careers for the sim, including veterinarian and pet trainer.

21:05.854 --> 21:06.994
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they can become rabid.

21:08.454 --> 21:12.415
[SPEAKER_02]: Blaze Revolution in our chatroom, orangelawntrainer.com, click on chat, says, I want a Liger.

21:12.915 --> 21:14.515
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that Napoleon Dynamite.

21:14.635 --> 21:15.375
[SPEAKER_02]: So funny.

21:15.895 --> 21:17.636
[SPEAKER_03]: I want an Octocat, actually.

21:17.676 --> 21:20.496
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Kibbles and Bits says, man, we need Spore already.

21:21.576 --> 21:23.397
[SPEAKER_02]: In talks of all these, you know, make your animals game.

21:23.617 --> 21:24.377
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give us Spore.

21:25.705 --> 21:27.045
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it, EA, just give us Spore.

21:27.385 --> 21:27.785
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.

21:28.126 --> 21:30.726
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is sounding a little too much like, what was it, RTS?

21:30.786 --> 21:32.606
[SPEAKER_08]: Impossible Creatures, if you remember that.

21:36.027 --> 21:36.807
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so hardcore.

21:38.227 --> 21:49.129
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, speaking of cool stuff coming out, the Wii, basically, Ubisoft in the UK has confirmed that Red Steel's coming out in November in the UK.

21:50.029 --> 21:52.210
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that mean to us, though?

21:53.010 --> 21:53.270
[SPEAKER_09]: Well...

21:53.769 --> 21:54.709
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a damn thing.

21:54.829 --> 21:55.490
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple things, though.

21:55.910 --> 21:57.170
[SPEAKER_09]: Red Steel is supposed to be a launch title.

21:58.050 --> 22:03.092
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Red Steel is supposed to be coming, or the Wii is supposed to be coming out before the PlayStation 3.

22:03.993 --> 22:04.473
[SPEAKER_09]: That we know.

22:05.053 --> 22:09.194
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for example, the PlayStation 3 is coming out in mid-November.

22:09.715 --> 22:12.155
[SPEAKER_09]: So, therefore, this has to be coming out early November.

22:12.816 --> 22:17.457
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in the UK, and the UK is probably going to be getting the Wii a few weeks after us.

22:18.458 --> 22:20.878
[SPEAKER_09]: What's a couple weeks before November?

22:21.719 --> 22:22.099
[SPEAKER_09]: October 18th.

22:25.195 --> 22:34.083
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so sick of all these news stories about the Wii's speculated release date.

22:34.123 --> 22:36.365
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the damn thing will come out when it comes out.

22:37.301 --> 22:40.323
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess which date I had in my system when they put Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam.

22:40.343 --> 22:40.843
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

23:06.311 --> 23:08.573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to kind of feel bad if it doesn't come out October 18th.

23:08.593 --> 23:10.934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to feel like Reggie personally fucked with us.

23:11.815 --> 23:15.597
[SPEAKER_09]: He's all, I'll show you, think you know when it's coming out, bastards.

23:17.558 --> 23:19.840
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, how you like them apples?

23:20.661 --> 23:25.524
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari Mawson in chat says Zelda Twilight Princess is scheduled for November, though, and that game's coming out on launch day.

23:26.384 --> 23:30.187
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but there's been no official date announced for Twilight Princess because...

23:31.300 --> 23:34.742
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be the day that the Wii comes out, so obviously they're not going to announce that.

23:35.143 --> 23:37.444
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, by the way, Twilight Princess is coming out this day.

23:38.065 --> 23:39.466
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, crap.

23:39.946 --> 23:40.547
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to do that.

23:40.607 --> 23:42.208
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, we have a huge scoop for you guys.

23:42.328 --> 23:43.769
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii is out right now.

23:44.169 --> 23:47.251
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, go to your local GameStop or EB Games and ask for one.

23:47.411 --> 23:48.252
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll love you for it.

23:50.774 --> 23:53.596
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the store tells you they don't have them yet, they're playing a joke on you.

23:53.636 --> 23:54.717
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to another store and ask.

23:55.998 --> 23:56.658
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

23:57.118 --> 23:58.439
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, I hope you guys know I'm kidding.

23:58.900 --> 23:59.440
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.384
[SPEAKER_09]: It's super secret.

24:01.404 --> 24:08.046
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's nothing one of those employees at those stores loves more than people coming in going, Do you have the Wii yet?

24:10.487 --> 24:22.331
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, speaking of lies and speculation, there's been a lot of rumors going around to what some of the secrets of the Wii and what they might be.

24:22.391 --> 24:29.014
[SPEAKER_09]: So, anyways, some speculation here we've got for you, including this is apparently from...

24:30.900 --> 24:37.728
[SPEAKER_09]: The full scope of the Wii controller details have yet to be revealed by Pixar and Nintendo Although I cannot elaborate

24:53.082 --> 25:03.712
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further, let me say that Nintendo should show that movement in 3D space will allow experiences outside of just the TV screen, and it's not 3D projection related.

25:04.172 --> 25:13.701
[SPEAKER_09]: But this also kind of, if you think about it, goes back to that one article we had about Red Steel and how some of the multiplayer won't take place on TV, which is interesting.

25:14.642 --> 25:27.658
[SPEAKER_09]: The first game that's going to be shown to the public that will demonstrate the full scope of the Wii controller potential will be Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2, which is also scheduled for October, by the way.

25:28.540 --> 25:30.142
[SPEAKER_09]: That's for all systems, including the Wii.

25:32.631 --> 25:41.377
[SPEAKER_09]: The sensor bar was in all actuality in no use at E3.

25:42.137 --> 25:44.279
[SPEAKER_09]: What it will allow hasn't been shown yet.

25:44.859 --> 25:48.101
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but interesting.

25:48.121 --> 25:59.929
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, according to people who are working close with everyday events at Nintendo Research and Development, Nintendo Wii specifications were far and away developed solely for the machine.

26:00.515 --> 26:03.536
[SPEAKER_09]: and says apparently that the specs keep changing on it.

26:04.276 --> 26:18.362
[SPEAKER_09]: Also that there's plans on maybe doing a Wii headset for the online capability and they might even go further in having it have a gyroscope inside of the headset for game use.

26:19.182 --> 26:19.602
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

26:21.383 --> 26:24.364
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it far-fetched, some of it maybe.

26:24.944 --> 26:25.284
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

26:26.425 --> 26:26.905
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

26:27.694 --> 26:27.794
[SPEAKER_09]: Roar.

27:05.373 --> 27:06.974
[SPEAKER_02]: Here come the FUs of the week, boys and girls.

27:11.376 --> 27:15.377
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes toward websites that use flash ads that have sound on them.

27:16.418 --> 27:23.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you go on Myspace and you hear SMACK THE BUG to win a million dollars.

27:25.001 --> 27:29.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like whatever site that was playing the sounds of death and I couldn't find what ad it was to turn it off.

27:31.224 --> 27:33.225
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a big, stinky pile of poo on that.

27:34.497 --> 27:59.302
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, um, you know, FU to IGN, and FU to IGN for one reason, and I've covered this before, Jessica Chobot, I don't like her, and the reason I don't like her is because she's, it's like a Paris Hilton situation here, famous for no apparent reason, famous because of something stupid, famous because she licked a PSP, come on now, and now they have her in like this

28:00.595 --> 28:03.236
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU of the week goes to my facial hair for growing too fast.

28:03.316 --> 28:05.557
[SPEAKER_09]: As you can see, I was too lazy to shave today.

28:05.577 --> 28:05.958
[SPEAKER_09]: Or yesterday.

28:29.870 --> 28:31.591
[SPEAKER_02]: and I practically have a beard at this point.

28:32.572 --> 28:35.814
[SPEAKER_02]: So, an FU to the, and an FU to the inflating cost of razors.

28:37.775 --> 28:38.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus!

28:40.636 --> 28:44.899
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, my, uh, FU this week is the same as last week.

28:45.159 --> 28:46.500
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to my air conditioner.

28:47.060 --> 28:50.042
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the compressor took a shit, they have to replace the whole unit.

28:50.462 --> 28:53.484
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, we're not gonna replace the whole unit, we're just gonna fix all we have.

28:53.664 --> 28:58.227
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, make a decision and get to it because it's still like 90 degrees in my den.

28:59.264 --> 29:03.167
[SPEAKER_08]: My computer will not work right, and it's just a big pain in the ass.

29:05.149 --> 29:05.469
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

29:06.750 --> 29:08.792
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for keeping the angst quick tonight, guys.

29:08.832 --> 29:10.453
[SPEAKER_09]: It allows us to move on to another story.

29:11.334 --> 29:16.638
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, speaking of fun stuff, this week Fusion Frenzy 2 was announced.

29:17.279 --> 29:21.522
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those who might not remember, it was a really cool game that was on the Xbox.

29:22.463 --> 29:27.127
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's basically a collection of about, you know, 40 or so minigames.

29:27.845 --> 29:45.356
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this time they're going to be having more mini-games as well, over 40, and set on seven different planets, as well as online multiplayer matches and tournaments, and it says players will be able to use tournament cards they've earned for a variety of purposes, including selecting the next game to be played or choosing the next planet to go to.

29:46.076 --> 29:51.200
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it sounds like a pretty fun little 360 game, and it's set to hit the stores this holiday season.

29:51.580 --> 29:56.583
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're having a hard time playing through Fusion Frenzy 1, maybe you ought to get a tutor!

29:57.421 --> 30:03.887
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wall Street Journal has recently run a report on gamers who are using their skills to help pay the rent.

30:04.827 --> 30:08.490
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what they're doing is they're setting up this whole enterprise here.

30:09.611 --> 30:22.022
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing as gamers that work all day have not a lot of time to perfect their skills, gaming-lessons.com has this guy, Tom Taylor,

30:22.976 --> 30:30.483
[SPEAKER_02]: who you pay $45 for an hour and he will turn you into an expert master chief.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.487
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think about hiring tutors to get better at games?

30:39.551 --> 30:43.255
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I guess, an interesting idea for them to use to make money, but no.

30:44.736 --> 30:44.856
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

30:46.144 --> 30:50.106
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, if you're questioning whether this is legit or anything, what can this guy do for me?

30:50.186 --> 30:55.890
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the guy who also just signed this big fat quarter million dollar contract to play Halo, essentially.

30:57.371 --> 30:59.952
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well how's he going to teach me to play something other than Halo?

31:01.233 --> 31:01.833
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

31:02.054 --> 31:06.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Well maybe if the business model works here, then it can work elsewhere.

31:06.136 --> 31:07.057
[SPEAKER_09]: So what kind of a tutor is he?

31:08.953 --> 31:11.634
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like saying, I'm a master at fractions.

31:11.975 --> 31:14.016
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, can you teach me some multiplication?

31:14.496 --> 31:16.037
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a master at fractions.

31:17.138 --> 31:17.498
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

31:18.518 --> 31:18.918
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

31:18.999 --> 31:20.419
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of dumb.

31:20.579 --> 31:21.400
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually kind of curious.

31:21.420 --> 31:22.661
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to look at this site real quick.

31:23.281 --> 31:24.962
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gaming-lessons.com.

31:25.942 --> 31:26.182
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

31:26.903 --> 31:28.844
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a gaming lessons store available?

31:28.864 --> 31:32.466
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like they have some free, you know, sold-out lessons.

31:32.566 --> 31:32.886
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

31:33.246 --> 31:33.987
[SPEAKER_02]: People are buying these.

31:34.327 --> 31:35.348
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds oddly familiar.

31:35.408 --> 31:37.489
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like that whole Penny Arcade Academy of...

31:38.444 --> 31:41.065
[SPEAKER_08]: I would laugh at that idea.

32:03.840 --> 32:04.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fair enough.

32:05.101 --> 32:09.984
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a comment on that, you can always send it into our mailbag, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

32:10.425 --> 32:16.109
[SPEAKER_02]: And every week, DarkSakura likes to dig into the mailbag and pull out her favorite letters that hopefully aren't too moldy.

32:17.250 --> 32:18.530
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them had some funk on them.

32:18.891 --> 32:20.912
[SPEAKER_02]: And was it convention funk?

32:21.873 --> 32:23.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as bad as fanboy funk.

32:23.194 --> 32:23.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

32:23.874 --> 32:29.058
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, she's going to open up that mailbag right now, kids, and pull out some of her favorite letters to share with us right now.

32:32.485 --> 32:35.266
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our emails comes from Ion671.

32:35.726 --> 32:39.828
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to read the whole thing, but he calls us the OL Army Generals.

32:39.848 --> 32:40.788
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty funny.

32:41.928 --> 32:43.249
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Senior Sergeant to you.

32:46.190 --> 32:47.470
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, General is above Sergeant.

32:47.670 --> 32:48.470
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, it doesn't matter.

32:48.590 --> 32:49.931
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making a Warcraft joke, but whatever.

32:51.211 --> 32:52.332
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are music game fans.

32:52.352 --> 32:55.493
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any favorite game soundtracks from any game, music game or not?

32:55.633 --> 32:56.893
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite is definitely Jet Set Radio.

32:59.830 --> 33:01.330
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's a really broad question.

33:01.350 --> 33:04.231
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you want like recent game soundtracks or old school stuff?

33:04.251 --> 33:06.452
[SPEAKER_03]: You were singing Wonga Midnight Maximum.

33:06.512 --> 33:08.032
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love Wonga.

33:08.092 --> 33:11.813
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as like a non-rhythm game, oh yeah, that's got a great soundtrack for driving.

33:11.893 --> 33:16.394
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck, I'll use that soundtrack, well at least the cuts I have, I don't have the whole thing, I need to re-get it.

33:17.214 --> 33:19.835
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use the cuts when I play Xbox 360 driving games.

33:20.115 --> 33:27.097
[SPEAKER_02]: Like instead of EA tracks, because I don't really like a lot of that stuff, I'll listen to that music while playing driving games.

33:27.157 --> 33:27.557
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

33:28.021 --> 33:29.942
[SPEAKER_03]: I've told you you have access to all my stuff.

33:30.182 --> 33:31.303
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I just keep forgetting.

33:32.724 --> 33:36.866
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix had a kick-ass soundtrack, in my opinion.

33:37.446 --> 33:38.507
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go new school.

33:38.527 --> 33:44.069
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go really old school, I like soundtracks like Super Metroid, but it's really old.

33:44.250 --> 33:45.430
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, anything you want to suggest?

33:47.031 --> 33:48.552
[SPEAKER_09]: What was a really fun one I had?

33:48.792 --> 33:51.874
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I had my car, Gran Turismo, the first one.

33:51.894 --> 33:54.895
[SPEAKER_09]: That had a pretty decent soundtrack.

33:55.315 --> 33:55.475
[SPEAKER_09]: Rez?

33:56.707 --> 33:57.427
[SPEAKER_09]: and Space Channel 5.

33:57.467 --> 34:00.489
[SPEAKER_09]: Justin and Chat wins Symphony of the Night.

34:25.593 --> 34:25.874
[SPEAKER_02]: Win.

34:26.394 --> 34:30.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, actually, actually, I have many... I love Symphony of the Night soundtrack, especially the Saturn one.

34:31.238 --> 34:33.420
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the remixes of Bloody Tears and Vampire Hunter.

34:33.500 --> 34:33.761
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

34:34.561 --> 34:48.254
[SPEAKER_03]: But I actually will take my... I actually burned off all the music off of my Rondo of Blood just to listen to the remixed versions of all the old school Castlevania tunes.

34:48.814 --> 34:49.675
[SPEAKER_03]: That and there's just...

34:50.814 --> 34:50.894
[SPEAKER_03]: Choo!

34:50.914 --> 34:50.994
[SPEAKER_03]: Choo!

34:51.114 --> 34:51.194
[SPEAKER_03]: Choo!

35:17.964 --> 35:21.705
[SPEAKER_03]: She used to be the real life anime girl is what her whole deal was.

35:23.005 --> 35:29.327
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently she gave a shot of her business to the crowd at CoastCon about five years ago.

35:30.327 --> 35:30.927
[SPEAKER_03]: Home lighting.

35:31.027 --> 35:32.207
[SPEAKER_03]: Kitchenware.

35:35.228 --> 35:37.129
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get this from an eyewitness, by the way.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.929
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email before I say something really bad.

35:41.830 --> 35:43.730
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going down a troublesome path.

35:43.770 --> 35:45.150
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed to be shown the light.

35:45.951 --> 35:47.191
[SPEAKER_03]: The Grand Theft Auto New Wave one.

35:47.431 --> 35:47.511
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

35:48.208 --> 35:48.568
[SPEAKER_03]: A-Ryth Dying

36:16.111 --> 36:18.773
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's basically displeased with the fanboys on the internet.

36:18.793 --> 36:28.980
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a one-up club for people who are into the same games as he is and people are all like blah blah blah blah blah and he tried to ask them nicely not to and they were being rude back.

36:29.740 --> 36:32.882
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, that's the nature of the internet.

36:32.902 --> 36:34.343
[SPEAKER_03]: I think isn't there an abuse report?

36:34.383 --> 36:36.465
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm biting my tongue so bad right now you don't even know.

36:37.265 --> 36:38.946
[SPEAKER_03]: Get off of one-up, start a Yahoo group.

36:42.088 --> 36:42.348
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

36:43.629 --> 36:43.989
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?

36:44.310 --> 36:44.690
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

36:45.467 --> 36:48.828
[SPEAKER_08]: Get off of Yahoo and go to OrangeLunchRadio.com Exactly.

36:48.848 --> 36:50.449
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang out with us.

36:50.469 --> 36:50.849
[SPEAKER_02]: Start a website.

36:50.869 --> 36:51.689
[SPEAKER_02]: Start a real website.

36:51.749 --> 36:52.569
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving on.

36:53.830 --> 36:57.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Our friend Rob with two B's sends us an email.

36:57.751 --> 36:58.011
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

36:59.052 --> 37:02.633
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some fuel for the fire the next time you discuss watching your own children.

37:04.533 --> 37:05.854
[SPEAKER_03]: My nephews visited yesterday.

37:05.894 --> 37:07.815
[SPEAKER_03]: Their mom had no clue which games they owned.

37:08.175 --> 37:08.935
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns out that Neil...

37:09.705 --> 37:13.607
[SPEAKER_03]: that only the ones I gave them, all appropriate for kids, are the ones they had.

37:13.947 --> 37:15.527
[SPEAKER_03]: But talking with the kids made me realize something.

37:15.568 --> 37:18.489
[SPEAKER_03]: Your children will be exposed to almost every game made through their friends.

37:19.309 --> 37:20.670
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a rough realization.

37:20.710 --> 37:25.152
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite your best efforts, little Johnny Doe will have Resident Evil on his DS because Mommy bought it for him.

37:26.272 --> 37:28.833
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny will show the other kids, regardless of age, including your own.

37:29.213 --> 37:38.037
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, as long as one's parent doesn't care which games their kids play, no amount of laws will be effective or even practical in keeping that game away from your own children unless you live under a rock.

37:38.877 --> 37:44.518
[SPEAKER_03]: You can only battle this type of outside influence by teaching your kids to understand what is real, what is fantasy, and why they're different.

37:45.279 --> 37:45.919
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen!

37:46.659 --> 37:47.439
[SPEAKER_08]: Nail on the head.

37:49.359 --> 37:54.461
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, now this is something that I had actually half thought of getting for myself.

37:54.901 --> 37:56.841
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd been discussing it.

37:57.701 --> 38:02.543
[SPEAKER_03]: We got an email from... Ooh, I think our connection just hiccuped.

38:05.243 --> 38:07.644
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we got an email from...

38:11.329 --> 38:21.712
[SPEAKER_03]: Gareth, who asked about the GP2X, which is the sequel to the GP32, which comes from Korea.

38:22.412 --> 38:25.893
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an open source handheld system.

38:27.333 --> 38:34.495
[SPEAKER_03]: You can load, as he says in here, I can play loads of classic emulated games, watch videos and podcasts all on one device.

38:34.535 --> 38:35.235
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at GP2X.com.

38:38.297 --> 38:40.438
[SPEAKER_03]: or gp2x.co.uk.

38:42.838 --> 38:44.959
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I want to thank the listeners.

38:44.979 --> 38:46.440
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a completely different random topic.

38:46.460 --> 38:55.702
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember who suggested it to me, but somebody suggested the front row application for the Mac and how you can install it on a Mac that it didn't really come with.

38:55.782 --> 38:59.404
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been great for my laptop for video podcasts and movies and stuff.

38:59.844 --> 39:02.424
[SPEAKER_02]: You talking about a device that would play all that kind of made me think of that.

39:03.305 --> 39:07.046
[SPEAKER_03]: I've decided when I buy my Mac, I'm going to be getting the Virtual XP.

39:08.083 --> 39:09.683
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot who told me about that, but thank you.

39:10.603 --> 39:12.484
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.

39:14.384 --> 39:25.426
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one comes, the last one I'm going to point at tonight is actually a question that comes from Skater Dude.

39:27.086 --> 39:32.447
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Orange Nails Radio, I was wondering about how the DS sales are dramatically larger than the PSP sales.

39:32.487 --> 39:34.568
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it is because the DS is cheaper or what?

39:34.968 --> 39:35.828
[SPEAKER_03]: Please give me your thoughts.

39:35.908 --> 39:36.288
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the show.

39:38.035 --> 39:38.495
[SPEAKER_09]: I like my white light.

40:05.383 --> 40:09.626
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, there'll be a cooler color that all the cool kids want.

40:10.666 --> 40:11.667
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do you have a white one?

40:15.289 --> 40:15.789
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more emails?

40:15.809 --> 40:16.209
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, Rob.

40:16.409 --> 40:17.290
[SPEAKER_03]: S-T-F-U.

40:17.310 --> 40:18.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thanks.

40:18.831 --> 40:19.111
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

40:19.431 --> 40:20.071
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more emails?

40:20.552 --> 40:21.973
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there aren't.

40:22.133 --> 40:32.118
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we should have more emails sent to us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Tell us how much you love it when I make those jokes that make Jamie uncomfortable.

40:34.318 --> 40:34.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope to hear from you

40:45.888 --> 40:53.330
[SPEAKER_09]: The creator of Electroplankton's brand new project, the Tenori On, would be something that you'll want to talk about.

40:53.550 --> 40:59.392
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, Toshio Iwai is coming up with this brand new device.

40:59.472 --> 41:08.135
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a 16 by 16 grid of LCD switches, or LED switches, which are used to actually play music.

41:08.455 --> 41:11.916
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can kind of use this to create your own mixes

41:12.873 --> 41:28.941
[SPEAKER_09]: He actually has a website that you can visit, which is www.global.yamaha.com slash design slash tenori dash on, which is T-E-N-O-R-I dash O-N.

41:29.661 --> 41:30.982
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can check it out.

41:31.002 --> 41:33.723
[SPEAKER_09]: The device looks pretty interesting.

41:33.803 --> 41:39.826
[SPEAKER_09]: He says that anybody can use it to make music, and it looks kind of sexy.

41:40.839 --> 41:42.780
[SPEAKER_09]: So kind of a neat little device there.

41:43.520 --> 41:46.141
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's anything like electroplankton, it should be pretty awesome.

41:47.221 --> 41:49.762
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know some people that played a lot of electroplankton.

41:49.782 --> 41:51.322
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, so much they were addicted.

41:51.562 --> 41:58.504
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might remember on a previous program, episode of Orange Launch Radio, we talked about the Dutch Game Addiction Clinic.

41:59.044 --> 42:03.246
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were talking about all that, the folks that were signing up to go to this clinic.

42:03.266 --> 42:03.866
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?

42:04.206 --> 42:08.127
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since this hit some of the mainstream news, apparently...

42:08.863 --> 42:14.926
[SPEAKER_02]: The gaming treatment program has been inundated with calls from parents wanting to get their kids in this.

42:16.766 --> 42:23.869
[SPEAKER_02]: Clinic director Keith Becker explained, Computer game addiction is obviously an even greater problem than we imagined.

42:25.650 --> 42:26.270
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything okay?

42:27.070 --> 42:28.451
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nothing.

42:28.591 --> 42:28.891
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

42:30.432 --> 42:31.172
[SPEAKER_02]: Just making sure.

42:33.053 --> 42:34.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounded like there was something bad going on over there.

42:37.422 --> 42:38.982
[SPEAKER_03]: You're having a little too much fun here.

42:39.042 --> 42:44.484
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say something about that name, however, I don't want to reveal where I... Does the game addiction thing strike a chord with you?

42:45.484 --> 42:46.264
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not addicted.

42:46.764 --> 42:46.984
[SPEAKER_03]: Much.

42:48.065 --> 42:59.528
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, it is conceded that video game addiction, also by the same guy, quote, is not a chemical dependency, but it's got everything of an obsessive-compulsive disorder and all the other stuff that comes with chemical dependencies.

43:00.268 --> 43:01.008
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, interesting.

43:01.308 --> 43:05.269
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I know there was another related story that talked about some guy was so addicted to video games...

43:06.131 --> 43:09.233
[SPEAKER_02]: that he never left his room and he peed in a bottle or something like that.

43:09.313 --> 43:10.453
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

43:10.774 --> 43:17.697
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, dude, that guy had more problems of being addicted to video games because I don't know in what universe that's considered sanitary by any means.

43:17.777 --> 43:19.218
[SPEAKER_03]: That's obsessive compulsive disorder.

43:19.238 --> 43:20.659
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's something else going on there.

43:20.779 --> 43:22.019
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more than game addiction.

43:22.039 --> 43:23.140
[SPEAKER_02]: That's craziness.

43:23.320 --> 43:23.740
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.382
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs professional help, absolutely.

43:26.682 --> 43:27.042
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

43:28.305 --> 43:38.114
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm kind of weary about these people just having the parents call in and say, oh yeah, my kids are addicted to games because they just play them a lot and stuff.

43:38.134 --> 43:40.716
[SPEAKER_09]: And it kind of reminds me of that But I'm a Cheerleader movie.

43:41.857 --> 43:44.639
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is our chat room supporting the peeing in a bottle thing?

43:44.679 --> 43:46.301
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is this just an internet chat thing?

43:46.581 --> 43:48.923
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Eddie saying, pee in a bottle for the win.

43:49.463 --> 43:51.445
[SPEAKER_02]: Cage says, peeing in a bottle is awesome.

43:51.485 --> 43:52.166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's liberating.

43:52.907 --> 43:59.810
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the only time when it's ever socially acceptable to pee in a bottle is when you just can't pull over for some reason.

43:59.990 --> 44:00.691
[SPEAKER_02]: At the doctor's office.

44:01.831 --> 44:02.432
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fine.

44:03.092 --> 44:08.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you have cancer and have a colostomy and have to pee in a bottle.

44:08.194 --> 44:08.514
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

44:08.655 --> 44:10.535
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all medically necessary reasons.

44:10.655 --> 44:20.920
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, because you're too lazy to put down the controller for five seconds of Halo 2 and go pee, it doesn't take that long to pee.

44:21.761 --> 44:22.221
[SPEAKER_02]: Poop socks.

44:23.107 --> 44:24.548
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to go to number two.

44:24.568 --> 44:25.589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to go there.

44:25.950 --> 44:28.432
[SPEAKER_02]: This show's fucked up enough as it is.

44:30.754 --> 44:32.676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this show's gone down the toilet, and I mean that.

44:32.996 --> 44:41.363
[SPEAKER_09]: If you think that's crazy, well, you know, the talk of the Xbox 360 dropping down to $2.99, that is crazy talk.

44:41.764 --> 44:42.404
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pisser.

44:43.505 --> 44:44.086
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

44:44.466 --> 44:49.010
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, um, our analyst Michael Patcher has, um,

44:51.035 --> 44:53.896
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much explain why this isn't going to happen.

44:54.316 --> 45:05.180
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason why is Microsoft Brass has informed the Xbox division that it must turn a profit or at least break even in the fiscal 2007 year, which ends in June 30th of next year.

45:05.621 --> 45:16.305
[SPEAKER_09]: He explains that that means that the price cuts on the Xbox 360 will only come if the box costs less to produce, ship, and market than wholesale price.

45:16.985 --> 45:19.606
[SPEAKER_09]: But the best guess is the box currently costs around $4 to $5

45:20.066 --> 45:20.686
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

45:38.535 --> 45:50.702
[SPEAKER_09]: The only reason they'll drop the price to $2.99 is say the PS3 comes out and they're like, Oh yeah, by the way, when we said it was going to come out for $4.99, actually $2.99 is the price that we're going to come out for it.

45:50.822 --> 45:51.983
[SPEAKER_09]: Then they'll drop the price.

45:53.264 --> 45:53.864
[SPEAKER_09]: Not going to happen.

45:56.186 --> 45:57.046
[SPEAKER_09]: No, don't hold your breath.

45:57.286 --> 45:58.847
[SPEAKER_09]: There's better games coming out in the fall.

45:59.568 --> 46:03.250
[SPEAKER_09]: When all those games come out, then you can decide which system you want.

46:03.632 --> 46:09.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know who's actually thinking that they're going to be doing a lot of profit?

46:10.615 --> 46:11.515
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be Nintendo.

46:12.776 --> 46:16.817
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going Wii.

46:18.858 --> 46:26.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo has actually just put out their results for their quarter ending last month.

46:26.981 --> 46:28.162
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going Wii in a bottle?

46:29.522 --> 46:30.943
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want anybody to go there.

46:31.023 --> 46:31.663
[SPEAKER_02]: I really didn't.

46:33.718 --> 46:38.464
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, DS is pulling in so much profit.

46:38.584 --> 46:42.109
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they've sold 21 million DSs and 4.1 million DS lights.

46:44.633 --> 46:48.636
[SPEAKER_03]: They've also sold more than 78 million games.

46:49.837 --> 46:59.685
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's basically projecting that from April of this year through March of next, they will sell another 17 million DSs and 75 million games.

47:01.446 --> 47:03.848
[SPEAKER_03]: They were actually higher than their E3 predictions.

47:05.710 --> 47:07.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they're still supporting Game Boy Advance.

47:07.891 --> 47:10.994
[SPEAKER_03]: They're expecting to sell another 2.5 million Game Boy Advances.

47:12.194 --> 47:40.722
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 million games for the system now they basically have ditched the micro I own a micro I remember when seeing that at E3 I'm like wow that's the dumbest idea I've seen yet I actually like my micro because when I was really bored standing around in line I had my micro on my lanyard around my neck and I could pick it up whenever I got really bored and play me some Kingdom Hearts it was

47:41.326 --> 47:43.547
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, I was playing Pocket Fighter.

47:43.928 --> 47:45.289
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Pocket Fighter, Puzzle Fighter.

47:49.031 --> 47:50.512
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is the interesting part.

47:50.532 --> 47:53.233
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's got some predictions about the Wii, as I had mentioned.

47:54.975 --> 48:00.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, for over the next five or six months, they're going to be selling the system.

48:00.618 --> 48:05.081
[SPEAKER_03]: They're expecting six million consoles and 17 million games.

48:06.782 --> 48:07.222
[SPEAKER_02]: Ambitious.

48:07.882 --> 48:08.523
[SPEAKER_02]: You think they can do it?

48:09.123 --> 48:09.423
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

48:09.704 --> 48:09.984
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Nintendo.

48:10.024 --> 48:10.324
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

48:12.432 --> 48:18.254
[SPEAKER_02]: GameCube, Nintendo 64, GameCube was actually pretty good.

48:18.534 --> 48:20.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii vs. PS3.

48:20.956 --> 48:21.616
[SPEAKER_02]: No contest.

48:21.636 --> 48:24.217
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, absolutely.

48:24.277 --> 48:25.018
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

48:25.358 --> 48:27.979
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sony fanboy in me still thinks Sony might be up to something.

48:28.199 --> 48:28.659
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

48:29.640 --> 48:29.940
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

48:30.526 --> 48:32.867
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think about anything we've talked about tonight?

48:32.927 --> 48:33.607
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a call.

48:33.748 --> 48:34.988
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Skype line is open.

48:35.048 --> 48:37.329
[SPEAKER_02]: It's www.orangeloungeradio.com.

48:37.349 --> 48:40.651
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on Interact With Us, and our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

48:41.211 --> 48:44.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can always pick up the old-fashioned phone and call us that way.

48:44.132 --> 48:47.854
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 916-226-9067.

48:47.934 --> 48:49.675
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always pick up the phone and do it that way.

48:50.015 --> 48:52.416
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking forward to your calls right now.

48:53.877 --> 48:54.837
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:54.857 --> 48:55.238
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

48:55.758 --> 48:56.478
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me now?

48:56.598 --> 48:57.779
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I can hear you just fine.

48:57.799 --> 48:58.319
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

48:59.324 --> 49:01.467
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Ranma, from the East Coast, what's on your mind?

49:01.487 --> 49:01.667
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, so...

49:21.693 --> 49:29.175
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, E3 is like the thing that you go to, but yet you probably have to sell one of your kidneys just to get in, you know?

49:29.675 --> 49:30.176
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

49:30.876 --> 49:33.617
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have to be honest, it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.

49:35.397 --> 49:38.698
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a legitimate reason for being there, it's really not hard to get in there.

49:40.419 --> 49:40.739
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

49:41.279 --> 49:41.919
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know.

49:43.382 --> 49:44.683
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

50:12.495 --> 50:20.905
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like you got gaming in one section, talk about the latest technology in one, nothing but free demos and stuff to walk away with.

50:21.165 --> 50:23.788
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus you have freaking cosplayers there having a great time.

50:28.874 --> 50:30.396
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a show that's open to the public?

50:31.037 --> 50:31.197
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

50:33.650 --> 50:40.095
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the direction that a show like E3 or whatever hopes to become the next E3, is that a direction that they should be taking?

50:40.595 --> 50:42.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Is to be a public show, you think?

50:43.157 --> 50:44.218
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to think so.

50:44.398 --> 50:52.145
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the way they should have it up, like maybe the first day, important industry people only, then open to the public for everyone else.

50:53.165 --> 50:53.746
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

50:54.226 --> 50:54.566
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

50:55.047 --> 50:58.109
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you do E3 public, it's going to be a clusterfuck.

50:58.149 --> 50:59.971
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, think of how it is right now.

51:01.032 --> 51:01.972
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people are there?

51:02.232 --> 51:04.273
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine double that?

51:05.393 --> 51:06.434
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I can.

51:06.494 --> 51:07.894
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called New York Comic Con.

51:10.535 --> 51:10.975
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

51:13.415 --> 51:18.757
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, LA is pretty big too, and it's a good place to have something like that.

51:18.797 --> 51:20.837
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how much bigger New York City could be.

51:20.877 --> 51:22.137
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yes, it's New York City.

51:22.478 --> 51:28.219
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no shortage of places to stay or anything like that, but I don't know.

51:28.749 --> 51:33.292
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, on the plus side, New York City is like this melt for all types of great stuff.

51:33.452 --> 51:43.057
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the downside, where the Jacob Javits Center is for digital life, it's like a 15-minute walk to the most local hotel unless you cross the river to Jersey.

51:43.618 --> 51:50.181
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for something like this, you'd have to bank on the fact that most people will be taking the bus and the subways to get to and fro.

51:52.383 --> 51:53.323
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, interesting.

51:53.603 --> 51:56.245
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually generates more revenue for the city.

51:57.468 --> 52:01.171
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I hope so, because then I'm hiking up the fares for another year.

52:01.611 --> 52:04.412
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see something like that realistically happening in the next couple years?

52:04.753 --> 52:05.953
[SPEAKER_02]: The show getting bigger and bigger?

52:06.754 --> 52:08.255
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I tend to think so, yeah.

52:08.275 --> 52:10.256
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, we'll see what happens.

52:10.696 --> 52:12.657
[SPEAKER_02]: If it gets big enough, we'll have to come out there, you know that.

52:13.398 --> 52:17.781
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I have to send you my list of all the cons I'm hitting up next year, so you three can come on out.

52:17.841 --> 52:21.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, of course, with no E3 this year, that might mean I can make an East Coast con.

52:21.203 --> 52:25.225
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, that's what I'm thinking too, is like, hey, travel budget back, so maybe I can go somewhere.

52:26.475 --> 52:28.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Digital Life is something I've been wanting to do for a while.

52:30.576 --> 52:32.457
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a geek's paradise.

52:32.537 --> 52:41.699
[SPEAKER_05]: The first day I went, they had teams from local high schools having a contest of how fast they could build a computer from start to finish, including boot up to Windows.

52:42.339 --> 52:45.480
[SPEAKER_02]: I just realized I'm going to be in New York City in October.

52:45.860 --> 52:50.901
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't said anything about this on the show yet, but I'm planning on going to New York City in October, but it's the wrong weekend.

52:51.001 --> 52:52.062
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't be there for Digital Life.

52:52.222 --> 52:53.222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be towards the end of October.

52:53.951 --> 52:54.892
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know for sure yet.

52:54.932 --> 53:00.558
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have more details later because I'll definitely go to the Nintendo store or something and meet fans if they want to come out.

53:00.698 --> 53:01.579
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be at Wicon.

53:02.901 --> 53:03.962
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be your security guard.

53:03.982 --> 53:08.847
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I shouldn't have said anything on the New York City thing.

53:08.867 --> 53:11.850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's going to happen in October, but I'll say more about that later.

53:12.311 --> 53:14.233
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be at SkyCon New York City.

53:14.253 --> 53:14.633
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

53:15.114 --> 53:16.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to say?

53:17.183 --> 53:42.045
[SPEAKER_02]: uh that's basically it and I'm loving the show because if you didn't notice I was feeling sick earlier but listening made me feel better so laughter heals everything thank you so much appreciate it no problem have a good one buddy later later oh you know what let's move E3 to YowieCon I like that idea oh that's a pretty boy Nikki hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this uh hi this is Eddie hi Eddie what's on your mind buddy

53:43.752 --> 53:47.955
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to comment on the E3 going public thing.

53:48.616 --> 53:50.738
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistically, I really don't think that's going to happen.

53:51.859 --> 53:56.022
[SPEAKER_01]: E3 is there for industry people to get stuff done.

53:58.304 --> 54:05.851
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have one day that's open to the industry and the rest is open to the public, I don't think there's enough time for people to get things done.

54:07.712 --> 54:10.915
[SPEAKER_01]: If they open it to both the industry and the public at the same time,

54:11.533 --> 54:17.898
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry people doesn't want to be tripping over, you know, all these fanboys who are there to see, you know, the latest game.

54:18.179 --> 54:18.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

54:18.659 --> 54:21.041
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would your suggestion be for the independents?

54:21.101 --> 54:22.542
[SPEAKER_02]: What do the Kenshiya folks do now?

54:24.164 --> 54:32.571
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think the IndieCon is a pretty good idea, but I still don't think it should be open to the public.

54:32.631 --> 54:39.937
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should still be, you know, an industry-only thing where, you know, like,

54:40.672 --> 54:41.132
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

54:41.212 --> 54:48.715
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

54:49.936 --> 54:50.536
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not really.

54:50.716 --> 54:50.936
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

54:50.956 --> 54:51.877
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for your thoughts.

54:52.437 --> 54:52.617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

54:52.897 --> 54:53.698
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the show.

54:54.618 --> 54:55.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem.

54:55.398 --> 54:58.279
[SPEAKER_02]: We like doing it because fine folks like yourself call us every week.

54:58.940 --> 54:59.220
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

54:59.400 --> 54:59.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, buddy.

55:00.360 --> 55:00.560
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

55:01.781 --> 55:02.521
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do one more call.

55:03.842 --> 55:04.102
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

55:05.382 --> 55:06.283
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

55:06.303 --> 55:06.623
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

55:07.276 --> 55:09.218
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Raven Stoffen again, sorry about that.

55:09.258 --> 55:10.579
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright, much better connection.

55:10.699 --> 55:11.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn Torn's off this time?

55:12.340 --> 55:12.681
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

55:13.041 --> 55:13.501
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better.

55:13.541 --> 55:14.942
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Pornotube's off?

55:15.583 --> 55:17.745
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Pornotube's off.

55:17.765 --> 55:19.266
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's try this again.

55:19.346 --> 55:20.287
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you want to call in about?

55:21.388 --> 55:26.892
[SPEAKER_06]: E3, and like you said, I don't think it's going to be cancelled.

55:27.032 --> 55:28.533
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be downsized.

55:29.294 --> 55:31.056
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, we never said cancelled.

55:31.436 --> 55:32.577
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, yeah, we did.

55:32.637 --> 55:35.079
[SPEAKER_02]: We said cancelled as we know it.

55:36.310 --> 55:41.575
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no doubt the ESA is going to do something, but the question is, is that something going to be good enough?

55:41.656 --> 55:42.576
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I ask you.

55:42.677 --> 55:44.038
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something going to be good enough?

55:45.079 --> 55:45.739
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

55:46.380 --> 55:47.681
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, I don't know.

55:48.242 --> 55:50.304
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be bad news for Nintendo and Sony.

55:50.344 --> 55:55.389
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't they have like these flashy plaz ads and everything to go all out for this thing?

55:56.405 --> 56:01.587
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but what's to stop Nintendo from doing a... Well, hell, they're doing their Fusion Tour.

56:02.127 --> 56:03.788
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they can take that stuff on the road.

56:04.208 --> 56:10.670
[SPEAKER_02]: And rumor is there was something going around on Kotaku or something saying that they were going to be doing a special tour.

56:10.710 --> 56:12.391
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was the Fusion Tour or something separate.

56:12.631 --> 56:14.212
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were going to take their show on the road.

56:14.252 --> 56:17.693
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing to stop Sony from doing something similar, having a huge event in LA.

56:18.133 --> 56:19.974
[SPEAKER_02]: All these guys could still do press conferences.

56:20.274 --> 56:23.415
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be weird because E3 kind of brought it all together.

56:24.235 --> 56:29.976
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're going to have, I think at least in 2007, you're just going to have a clusterfuck of all these random events.

56:30.316 --> 56:31.357
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be really weird.

56:32.157 --> 56:35.198
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be funny, all this clusterfuck of all these things.

56:35.758 --> 56:37.618
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be an interesting time in 2007.

56:39.298 --> 56:46.020
[SPEAKER_02]: True, but for us little guys who don't really have a travel budget, who like to bring the news to you guys, we're screwed.

56:46.917 --> 56:48.158
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe not so much us.

56:48.278 --> 56:50.499
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fortunate enough to be in the Bay Area-ish.

56:50.899 --> 56:55.101
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Bay Area is a 90-minute drive, so realistically we can get to most events over there pretty easy.

56:55.622 --> 57:01.205
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I feel sorry for a lot of other folks who don't have that same luxury of being able to drive.

57:01.445 --> 57:02.906
[SPEAKER_02]: And not every company is in the Bay Area.

57:02.946 --> 57:07.788
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are in L.A., which is a little harder to get to, and some are in, you know what, Canada, other countries.

57:07.868 --> 57:12.811
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, one of the nicest people we talked to at E3 this year were those folks from Spain that were developing the...

57:13.766 --> 57:14.026
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

57:14.046 --> 57:15.767
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like American Pie meets Grand Theft Auto.

57:15.787 --> 57:16.888
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the name of the game now.

57:17.208 --> 57:18.069
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it called?

57:18.629 --> 57:19.369
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer something.

57:19.710 --> 57:21.251
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer Heat or something?

57:21.271 --> 57:25.333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was funny because it had a guy stealing panties on the cover.

57:25.353 --> 57:25.753
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny.

57:25.934 --> 57:28.775
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners, Raven Stolfen?

57:29.456 --> 57:31.397
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you left this out of your note.

57:31.857 --> 57:34.779
[SPEAKER_06]: PSP got a firmware update.

57:34.819 --> 57:34.999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 2.8.

57:35.039 --> 57:36.700
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we talked about that last week.

57:36.760 --> 57:38.601
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go listen to last week's show, buddy.

57:39.742 --> 57:40.362
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out.

57:40.763 --> 57:41.003
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

57:42.034 --> 57:45.776
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, we didn't have it on the show roll tonight because we already talked about that it was coming out.

57:46.777 --> 57:47.237
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

57:47.277 --> 57:47.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you download it?

57:49.019 --> 57:49.959
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the PSP.

57:49.979 --> 57:51.900
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to put it in.

57:52.020 --> 57:54.122
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really have a chance to test it out yet.

57:54.222 --> 57:57.244
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, call us back next week after you've tested it out because I haven't upgraded mine yet.

57:57.264 --> 57:57.904
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little lazy.

57:58.965 --> 57:59.865
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one more thing.

57:59.966 --> 58:00.646
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

58:01.006 --> 58:02.947
[SPEAKER_06]: About the PSP and the DS Lite sales.

58:02.967 --> 58:03.368
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it.

58:03.488 --> 58:03.628
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

58:04.873 --> 58:12.677
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is my opinion why the DS is doing better, because it's targeted to little kids and people that like things.

58:12.817 --> 58:14.138
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo's a little kid company.

58:14.218 --> 58:15.058
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not being mean.

58:15.118 --> 58:16.019
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they say.

58:16.899 --> 58:17.179
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

58:18.300 --> 58:19.601
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a family-friendly company.

58:20.281 --> 58:24.243
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a family-friendly company, and when people see it, they go, oh, friendly.

58:24.623 --> 58:28.045
[SPEAKER_02]: But Sony has family-friendly stuff on it, too.

58:29.164 --> 58:33.887
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, but Sony's looking for that luxury liner.

58:33.947 --> 58:35.227
[SPEAKER_06]: They want you to get your money.

58:35.327 --> 58:37.148
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing is not cheap either.

58:39.049 --> 58:39.350
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

58:39.530 --> 58:40.670
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for sharing your thoughts.

58:40.730 --> 58:41.231
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

58:41.851 --> 58:43.612
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about the bad quality the first time.

58:43.632 --> 58:44.412
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

58:44.832 --> 58:46.533
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be edited out like it was never there.

58:47.114 --> 58:47.654
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

58:47.814 --> 58:49.975
[SPEAKER_02]: Our podcast listeners are going to go, what are they talking about?

58:50.436 --> 58:51.516
[SPEAKER_02]: That first call's not even there.

58:51.556 --> 58:52.016
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

58:52.577 --> 58:52.877
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

58:52.897 --> 58:53.097
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

58:54.728 --> 58:58.150
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want our podcast folks to know we really don't edit a lot on the show.

58:58.190 --> 58:58.750
[SPEAKER_02]: We really don't.

58:58.770 --> 59:00.151
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to keep things pure here.

59:00.171 --> 59:04.773
[SPEAKER_02]: The only things we really edit out, dead air and bad Skype calls, and there's a really bad connection.

59:04.914 --> 59:06.294
[SPEAKER_02]: So just wanted you guys to know that.

59:06.354 --> 59:07.235
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, one more call.

59:07.755 --> 59:09.276
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another New Yorker, so this should be fun.

59:10.256 --> 59:11.297
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

59:11.317 --> 59:11.637
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

59:12.367 --> 59:14.088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one and only Legend of Zaku.

59:14.308 --> 59:15.889
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, another New Yorker on the line.

59:15.949 --> 59:16.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me guess.

59:16.550 --> 59:17.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Digital Life?

59:17.350 --> 59:17.911
[SPEAKER_02]: New E3?

59:17.951 --> 59:19.872
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, of course.

59:20.592 --> 59:23.514
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the same thing as Ranma said.

59:23.594 --> 59:25.075
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, then what are your thoughts on this?

59:25.115 --> 59:28.398
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is Digital Life to be the new E3 besides the fact it's in your backyard?

59:28.518 --> 59:33.081
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you're breaking down E3 and spreading it across the country.

59:33.121 --> 59:34.962
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much what is going to happen next year.

59:36.551 --> 59:37.512
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to restate this.

59:37.572 --> 59:40.654
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to second the statements I already said.

59:40.754 --> 59:41.494
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a clusterfuck.

59:41.594 --> 01:00:01.825
[SPEAKER_07]: What will happen is that the elements that made E3 really successful in the earlier days, in the first few ones, like allowing the public to go in, is basically going to help the other smaller shows, which are going to steal E3's lightning like that.

01:00:02.817 --> 01:00:19.369
[SPEAKER_07]: and E3 on the other hand well now you know it's a wake-up call for them it's a wake-up call for the industry for the you know for the fact that this show went out it was just flooded with hype too much fat when basically the whole purpose of E3 was to focus on you know the hardcore content.

01:00:19.509 --> 01:00:21.670
[SPEAKER_07]: Zaku when was the public ever allowed in E3?

01:00:22.431 --> 01:00:24.492
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in the earlier days according to the Wikipedia.

01:00:26.681 --> 01:00:32.366
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't really that the public was allowed, but my understanding is it was pretty easy to get in.

01:00:32.586 --> 01:00:34.428
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's basically what I'm saying.

01:00:35.008 --> 01:00:35.829
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me restate that.

01:00:35.869 --> 01:00:36.930
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot easier to get in.

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:37.790
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fine, whatever.

01:00:39.352 --> 01:00:44.055
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, by adding the element of having the public involved, then you build up hype.

01:00:44.095 --> 01:00:46.177
[SPEAKER_07]: You bring the hype to the people directly.

01:00:46.397 --> 01:00:52.943
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, one of the dangers about that is that people are going to play these demos at E3 and then go, well, that game sucks.

01:00:53.886 --> 01:00:54.286
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:00:54.326 --> 01:00:55.587
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it wasn't really half finished.

01:00:55.607 --> 01:00:58.609
[SPEAKER_07]: And the problem is that it's just too many people that aren't supposed to be there.

01:00:59.209 --> 01:01:04.652
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's one of the risks associated with letting, you know, opening a show of that magnitude to the public.

01:01:04.672 --> 01:01:05.613
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be too crowded.

01:01:06.073 --> 01:01:07.253
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear from some developers.

01:01:07.313 --> 01:01:12.336
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for tomorrow, Monday, because I'm excited to hear from some developers about what their plans are.

01:01:12.356 --> 01:01:12.977
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

01:01:13.717 --> 01:01:15.559
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hope I have enough frequent flyer miles.

01:01:29.057 --> 01:01:30.037
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.

01:01:30.177 --> 01:01:35.999
[SPEAKER_07]: If anything, you could just outsource your reporting to other people online.

01:01:36.179 --> 01:01:44.862
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we've always said we would love to get reports from other people that can go to shows like this when we can't, but nobody does it.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:49.323
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but this would be a good call to reiterate that.

01:01:50.264 --> 01:01:51.484
[SPEAKER_02]: Consider it reiterated.

01:01:52.524 --> 01:01:56.085
[SPEAKER_02]: You can email myself personally, or you'll mail the mailbag.

01:01:56.365 --> 01:01:57.686
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, email Loki.

01:01:58.326 --> 01:01:59.668
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll say, sure, go for it.

01:01:59.748 --> 01:02:01.710
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, email me.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:04.192
[SPEAKER_02]: But you do the mailbag, so I kind of already said that.

01:02:04.212 --> 01:02:04.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, email me anyway.

01:02:04.893 --> 01:02:06.274
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, email 23rd Magus.

01:02:06.314 --> 01:02:07.435
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll make sure we find out.

01:02:08.276 --> 01:02:09.758
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like I get any other email anyway.

01:02:09.778 --> 01:02:12.841
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the best way to do it, by just spreading out, having a network.

01:02:14.722 --> 01:02:35.087
[SPEAKER_02]: and so basically it'll come down to that it'll be spread out when you're covering these shows follow the OL Army principle of don't be a dick and remember you don't represent Orange Lounge Radio I just want to let the listeners know that but if you want to send us fan stuff out there that you taped for us as a gift to us, go for it

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:36.180
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.320
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to get fan stuff in here.

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.221
[SPEAKER_07]: You can count all these other guys as contributors.

01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:41.642
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically what we'll become anyways.

01:02:41.662 --> 01:02:43.142
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it works for me.

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:44.462
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing but good contributors.

01:02:44.642 --> 01:02:48.404
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Zaku, then go to Digital Life with your camcorder and send us some stuff back, all right?

01:02:48.944 --> 01:02:51.044
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you something from there like I did last year.

01:02:51.524 --> 01:02:52.765
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right, our poster.

01:02:53.205 --> 01:02:54.625
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember from Digital Life last year.

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:57.306
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, it's hanging up right here, right over Jamie's head.

01:02:58.401 --> 01:03:00.702
[SPEAKER_03]: In all of its illustrator glory.

01:03:00.742 --> 01:03:04.063
[SPEAKER_02]: Hanging right next to the Jay and Silent Bob, all you motherfuckers are going to pay.

01:03:04.103 --> 01:03:05.764
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the one who's going to wear the Bollickers poster.

01:03:05.784 --> 01:03:08.185
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Zaku, have a good one.

01:03:08.745 --> 01:03:09.445
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you too.

01:03:09.505 --> 01:03:09.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

01:03:16.048 --> 01:03:18.028
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was an animated Skype line tonight.

01:03:18.989 --> 01:03:20.409
[SPEAKER_02]: Half the calls were from New York City.

01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:22.370
[SPEAKER_02]: I love New York City.

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:23.570
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem in New York City.

01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:25.031
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to going there very soon.

01:03:25.271 --> 01:03:26.291
[SPEAKER_02]: New York City!

01:03:26.952 --> 01:03:27.832
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody get a rope.

01:03:28.844 --> 01:03:32.085
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been to New York since I was in high school.

01:03:32.445 --> 01:03:33.245
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fun place.

01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:34.466
[SPEAKER_03]: I played at Carnegie Hall.

01:03:34.546 --> 01:03:36.166
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always stuff to do in New York City.

01:03:36.266 --> 01:03:36.666
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

01:03:37.626 --> 01:03:40.767
[SPEAKER_02]: Any last minute stories before we get into the final story of the night?

01:03:44.428 --> 01:03:45.088
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

01:03:45.148 --> 01:03:46.769
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I guess we go to the final story of the night.

01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:49.289
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I did have one.

01:03:49.429 --> 01:03:49.750
[SPEAKER_09]: You lie!

01:03:51.986 --> 01:03:53.266
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was not lying.

01:03:53.627 --> 01:03:55.267
[SPEAKER_09]: It's impossible!

01:03:55.547 --> 01:04:01.949
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to mention there's a demo out there now if you have upgraded your PSP the firmware 2.8 for Mercury Meltdown.

01:04:02.449 --> 01:04:03.770
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can check that out for free.

01:04:06.471 --> 01:04:08.071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I thought that was kind of neat.

01:04:09.572 --> 01:04:12.292
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a reason I would go and upgrade mine to 2.8.

01:04:12.593 --> 01:04:13.833
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I should because...

01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:16.810
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I have nothing better to do with it.

01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:18.851
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, check it out.

01:04:19.451 --> 01:04:22.592
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, no, that's it.

01:04:24.613 --> 01:04:26.333
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, then let's go to our last story of the evening.

01:04:26.853 --> 01:04:35.016
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about what's wrong with this world and why Brazil just couldn't win the World Cup.

01:04:35.796 --> 01:04:38.877
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the reason why they couldn't win the World Cup?

01:04:40.137 --> 01:04:41.678
[SPEAKER_09]: Sex and PlayStation 2.

01:04:42.998 --> 01:04:43.699
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

01:04:44.179 --> 01:04:45.099
[SPEAKER_09]: At least that's what they're blaming.

01:04:45.532 --> 01:04:47.713
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought that was kind of funny.

01:04:49.793 --> 01:04:50.234
[SPEAKER_09]: Anywho.

01:04:52.955 --> 01:05:09.860
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so apparently the reason why there are lead footballers out there getting too sexed up, which is apparently, I guess, against their rules during the World Cup, and playing too much FIFA 06 on PlayStation 2.

01:05:11.621 --> 01:05:14.262
[SPEAKER_09]: Good at the game, but not good at the actual game.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:45.116
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of sucks for him alright then I think it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night DarkSakura, you got a mic in your hand why don't you start us off two reject false icons and I like beer Loki, your final thought my final thought is the king of all cosmos for some reason is the number five top gayest video game characters out there what's number one?

01:05:50.740 --> 01:06:10.186
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Espatuse for the first time this week Brazilian grill for those that don't know what kind of food that is It's just big hunks of meat getting thrown on your plate Magus, your final thought, thanks for being here tonight Pie, Pete to the moon

01:06:12.913 --> 01:06:18.735
