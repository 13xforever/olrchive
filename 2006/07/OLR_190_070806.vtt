WEBVTT

00:14.514 --> 00:24.325
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, Sony stirs up major controversy with a new billboard, Nintendo gives President Bush a birthday present, and does Microsoft have some secret Christmas plans?

00:32.520 --> 00:35.504
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:51.656 --> 00:53.378
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:14.420 --> 01:16.060
[SPEAKER_09]: We brought on our good buddy Shane.

01:16.080 --> 01:16.480
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

01:16.680 --> 01:17.481
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing good.

01:17.541 --> 01:18.541
[SPEAKER_09]: Also known as Miklatov.

01:18.901 --> 01:19.161
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

01:19.461 --> 01:21.761
[SPEAKER_09]: And now Shane is actually, he's being hardcore tonight.

01:21.781 --> 01:23.322
[SPEAKER_09]: He's actually playing a game during the show.

01:23.702 --> 01:24.662
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm multitasking.

01:25.362 --> 01:26.642
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hardcore every show.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.383
[SPEAKER_09]: You usually play games too, don't you?

01:29.643 --> 01:30.663
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you do them on break.

01:31.783 --> 01:33.423
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be doing the music break and then he comes back.

01:33.443 --> 01:35.264
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes you yell at me if I play them during the show.

01:35.284 --> 01:36.724
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because it gets distracting.

01:36.744 --> 01:37.504
[SPEAKER_09]: Even this is distracting.

01:37.524 --> 01:38.344
[SPEAKER_09]: You just turn it down.

01:38.904 --> 01:40.405
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how to work a Mac.

01:41.065 --> 01:42.485
[SPEAKER_09]: He's playing on my Mac.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.370
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you playing?

01:44.390 --> 01:45.451
[SPEAKER_09]: You're playing World of Warcraft, right?

01:45.471 --> 01:47.031
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing World of Warcraft.

01:47.071 --> 01:47.291
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun.

01:48.111 --> 01:48.392
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:48.752 --> 01:52.193
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get into the show real quick, but just first a couple housekeeping announcements.

01:53.593 --> 01:55.373
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we are taping a day early this week.

01:55.413 --> 01:57.054
[SPEAKER_09]: We are live on Saturday, not Sunday.

01:57.774 --> 02:03.976
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you'd like to join us, if you're listening live to OrangeLaunchRadio.com right now on the Saturday evening, head on over to our chat room, OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

02:03.996 --> 02:04.636
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on chat.

02:04.876 --> 02:08.017
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be back to our regular taping schedules next week.

02:08.413 --> 02:30.266
[SPEAKER_09]: So Sunday the 16th at 6pm Pacific Time, we're taping live on our station, OrangeLawnTrader.com But of course, you can always catch up via our podcast feed, which is also at OrangeLawnTrader.com Also tonight it's only going to be a one part show, there's not going to be a part B this week But just like last week, it ended up being at least an hour and a half, if not more So that's probably what tonight's show is going to end up being a little bit of too

02:30.891 --> 02:32.292
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's get it started.

02:32.312 --> 02:35.073
[SPEAKER_09]: We always like to start off with what we've been playing this week.

02:35.193 --> 02:36.954
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?

02:37.094 --> 02:40.336
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been trying to finish Blazing Angels the entire game.

02:40.716 --> 02:43.218
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have 6 out of 7 achievements, so that's all that matters.

02:43.238 --> 02:44.699
[SPEAKER_10]: Achievement points, whore.

02:44.799 --> 02:49.901
[SPEAKER_10]: I've already beaten the game, and I can tell you this much, the game sucks really bad.

02:50.662 --> 02:51.702
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you keep playing?

02:51.943 --> 02:58.086
[SPEAKER_10]: I got it for free, and I want to finish the achievement points before I send it back to its, you know,

02:58.895 --> 03:01.237
[SPEAKER_10]: Use Game Grave at GameStop

03:21.890 --> 03:23.271
[SPEAKER_10]: All the missions are basically the same.

03:23.471 --> 03:26.872
[SPEAKER_10]: And some, like, the missions are, you know, pretty similar difficulties.

03:27.072 --> 03:30.533
[SPEAKER_10]: And then some are just, like, way out there, like, way too damn hard.

03:30.813 --> 03:32.114
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't get why they did that.

03:32.554 --> 03:34.374
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it goes, like, super easy afterwards.

03:34.454 --> 03:35.755
[SPEAKER_10]: So, whatever.

03:36.075 --> 03:36.975
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm almost done.

03:37.015 --> 03:42.397
[SPEAKER_10]: All I gotta do now is I have to play through these standard arcade modes, which you have to play with 32 different planes.

03:42.437 --> 03:44.878
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have to play it 32 times all the way through.

03:45.878 --> 04:13.164
[SPEAKER_10]: and basically you take on like four different waves of planes and it's really boring but once I do that I'll have the last achievement so that's all the matters um and I don't know if the multiplayer online's any good but I know the multiplayer split screen's kind of lame so I don't know be worth checking out I did also get to play the Chromehounds demo which is pretty awesome and um you know unfortunately the mechs are pretty slow in it so I

04:13.666 --> 04:14.987
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I did play a little bit more of that.

04:15.227 --> 04:17.868
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't wait for the final game to come out, I think, this week.

04:18.769 --> 04:20.790
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Prey, also played some of that.

04:20.910 --> 04:23.091
[SPEAKER_10]: That game reminds me so much of Duke Nukem 3D.

04:23.651 --> 04:24.712
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just crazy.

04:24.732 --> 04:35.798
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually have inside the arcade where you first start off in the bar, there's an arcade game that's like Pac-Man, and you can actually play the arcade game in there, which is kind of neat.

04:36.398 --> 04:43.202
[SPEAKER_10]: So, very interactive, just like Duke Nukem 3D, and kind of similar to Doom 3 in how dark and, you know,

04:44.397 --> 04:52.059
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead Rising, Saints Row, Enchanted Arms My gaming week, I was in Canada most of the week on vacation, so I took a vacation from the internet and gaming a lot in general, but I did

05:11.687 --> 05:12.768
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:39.002 --> 05:40.943
[SPEAKER_09]: and Gradius 4 I don't think I've ever played before.

05:40.963 --> 05:46.546
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played 5, I've played 3, I've played 2 on emulators because it was only out in Japan, I believe.

05:48.387 --> 05:52.610
[SPEAKER_09]: But now I've gotten a chance to play all the Gradius games and it makes a good collection.

05:54.091 --> 05:57.833
[SPEAKER_09]: They enhanced Gradius 1 and 2 a little bit so that it's widescreen.

05:58.613 --> 06:04.837
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not perfectly the PSP's resolution, you can downsize it to the regular resolution, but it works well on the widescreen.

06:04.857 --> 06:07.218
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't feel like the game's stretched or anything like that.

06:07.908 --> 06:09.430
[SPEAKER_09]: The game plays pretty smoothly.

06:09.750 --> 06:14.934
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say my favorite game out of the bunch is Gradius Gaiden, probably Gradius 3, my least favorite, just because I don't...

06:15.213 --> 06:16.494
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't like the way that game starts.

06:16.554 --> 06:18.115
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like the first stage in it.

06:18.195 --> 06:21.358
[SPEAKER_09]: The difficulty curve in that one seems to be a lot higher than the other games.

06:22.058 --> 06:25.261
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a good game for rekindling all your favorite Gradius memories.

06:25.301 --> 06:28.123
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oh, it's the Easter Island heads and all that stuff.

06:29.364 --> 06:32.206
[SPEAKER_09]: The only other thing that probably bothered me about the game was the price.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.428
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was $39.99 for the game.

06:34.848 --> 06:42.594
[SPEAKER_09]: And while it's a real great, you know, it's still a pretty good value, it's kind of surprising that old games are demanding $40.

06:43.254 --> 06:44.135
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess it's just because

06:44.734 --> 06:46.657
[SPEAKER_09]: You get so many of them, and they did rehash it.

06:47.258 --> 06:47.939
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good buy.

06:47.960 --> 06:49.883
[SPEAKER_09]: I would recommend it, especially if you're into shooters.

06:50.564 --> 06:53.268
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good no-attention-span shooter.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.071
[SPEAKER_09]: You just pick it up, go, have fun with it.

06:55.644 --> 07:25.250
[SPEAKER_09]: I also like that you can save your progress anywhere so you can just save and come back later instead of having to start over every time like the old versions of Gradius the other disappointment is that I don't see Salamander unless it's an unlock I need to check GameFAQs to see if maybe I just haven't unlocked it yet because I haven't actually beat any of the Gradius games yet while I've had it because I keep having ADD I go back and forth to all the different games and I couldn't get the up up down down left right left right BA code to work mainly because there is no BA buttons on the PSP but I press what I think would be BA but it doesn't seem to work

07:25.711 --> 07:26.451
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

07:51.789 --> 07:53.891
[SPEAKER_09]: So Konami's got some good stuff coming out?

07:53.911 --> 07:54.151
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

07:54.171 --> 07:54.611
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for me.

08:19.378 --> 08:20.799
[SPEAKER_06]: and people that work there in Konami.

08:21.980 --> 08:26.902
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I also played some Wendon this week because I love that game a lot.

08:27.603 --> 08:46.253
[SPEAKER_06]: And my computer at home broke so I can't play WoW there so to pass the time I downloaded Bejeweled 2 on Xbox Live Arcade and that game, I always loved Bejeweled and I don't think it works too well on the 360 but it's got really good music so it was worth it.

08:48.054 --> 08:48.995
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's pretty.

08:49.537 --> 08:50.237
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give it that.

08:50.677 --> 08:51.098
[SPEAKER_06]: The game?

08:51.378 --> 08:51.938
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the music?

08:53.518 --> 08:53.899
[SPEAKER_09]: The game.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.099
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks nice on HD and all that good stuff.

08:56.119 --> 09:05.103
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks nice, but it's not as easy to play because when you play it on computer you have your mouse and you can go really quick to whatever little jewel you want to swap.

09:05.603 --> 09:09.884
[SPEAKER_06]: But this one you have to move up three times and left three times.

09:11.665 --> 09:14.446
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think it plays well, but the music's really good.

09:15.106 --> 09:17.627
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess the only other thing I've done this week is at work

09:18.103 --> 09:21.691
[SPEAKER_06]: We follow a certain site's... Can I say that site right there?

09:21.731 --> 09:22.192
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

09:22.352 --> 09:22.813
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's fine.

09:23.134 --> 09:28.546
[SPEAKER_06]: We follow the GameFAQ's Best Series Ever contest, and we put money on it.

09:29.255 --> 09:34.119
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been paying very close attention to that this week, and I'm very upset by what's going on today.

09:34.599 --> 09:35.780
[SPEAKER_06]: What's happening today right now?

09:35.840 --> 09:40.203
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo is losing to Castlevania, and I picked Halo to win over Castlevania.

09:40.463 --> 09:42.445
[SPEAKER_09]: They do those little tournaments once in a while.

09:42.485 --> 09:44.606
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they do the best video game characters.

09:44.686 --> 09:46.368
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like $130 at work is on the line here.

09:46.388 --> 09:47.468
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo is like two games.

09:47.528 --> 09:49.130
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't really call it a series.

09:50.230 --> 09:52.012
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, there's a third game coming out, but...

09:52.512 --> 09:54.233
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not much of a series.

09:54.293 --> 09:57.014
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but they're only two of the most popular games of all time.

09:57.034 --> 10:02.316
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but how many systems has Castlevania been on versus how many systems that Halo's been on?

10:02.376 --> 10:10.759
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I would vote Castlevania, personally, but that's just because... Yeah, I would have too, but you have to think, okay, these people that come to the site, what do they like more?

10:11.039 --> 10:12.740
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought maybe they like Halo more.

10:13.160 --> 10:13.620
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wrong.

10:13.660 --> 10:17.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently they like Fire Emblem more than Silent Hill because they're idiots.

10:17.242 --> 10:17.482
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

10:17.702 --> 10:18.883
[SPEAKER_09]: Fire Emblem or Silent Hill?

10:39.969 --> 10:43.551
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm looking in our chatroom over at OrangeLotsRadio.com, click on chat.

10:43.971 --> 10:47.093
[SPEAKER_09]: And GK128, I guess, is in some sort of betting pool, too.

10:47.133 --> 10:48.934
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, Halo's loss fucked me, too.

10:49.334 --> 10:50.955
[SPEAKER_09]: I chose Halo to go three rounds.

10:51.435 --> 10:52.736
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's terrible.

10:53.056 --> 10:53.737
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know what?

10:53.797 --> 10:57.319
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo wouldn't have won over Kingdom Hearts, which is the next two in.

10:58.019 --> 11:00.441
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, Halo couldn't make three rounds.

11:00.461 --> 11:01.641
[SPEAKER_09]: Which series did you pick to win it all?

11:02.122 --> 11:06.424
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the final two being Final Fantasy and Zelda, and I have Zelda winning.

11:07.423 --> 11:09.965
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, Final Fantasy, a lot of fanboys

11:31.465 --> 11:33.346
[SPEAKER_06]: and come on, Final Fantasy VII person?

11:33.967 --> 11:35.428
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody loves Final Fantasy VII.

11:35.448 --> 11:38.549
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, Cloud, Aeris, Sephiroth.

11:38.690 --> 11:40.591
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Sephiroth versus Cloud for a little bit.

11:40.611 --> 11:41.772
[SPEAKER_09]: Tidus and Yuna.

11:41.892 --> 11:42.732
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on.

11:43.553 --> 11:47.055
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just trying to use my knowledge from last year because I didn't win last year.

11:47.095 --> 11:47.875
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even come close.

11:48.376 --> 11:49.817
[SPEAKER_06]: This year I'm doing better, though, at least.

11:49.837 --> 11:50.917
[SPEAKER_06]: Cecil from IV.

11:52.098 --> 11:52.378
[SPEAKER_09]: Who?

11:52.558 --> 11:54.780
[SPEAKER_09]: Locke, the treasure hunter from VI.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.241
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a thief.

11:56.941 --> 11:57.481
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, forget it.

11:57.581 --> 11:58.362
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Edgar better.

12:00.356 --> 12:00.876
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

12:18.086 --> 12:19.727
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't Pirates come out this week, too?

12:21.207 --> 12:27.149
[SPEAKER_10]: It was supposed to come out last week, and I think it got delayed to the 5th, and yeah, it came out finally.

12:28.070 --> 12:29.390
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that anybody cares.

12:29.750 --> 12:30.911
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a decent game.

12:31.331 --> 12:32.271
[SPEAKER_10]: Pirates of the Caribbean?

12:32.291 --> 12:33.172
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I saw it at E3.

12:33.212 --> 12:34.552
[SPEAKER_09]: They gave us a little demo.

12:35.092 --> 12:37.553
[SPEAKER_09]: Bethesda actually invited us to a thingy we went to.

12:38.093 --> 12:40.434
[SPEAKER_10]: It was better than the PSP game, I can tell you that.

12:40.454 --> 12:44.556
[SPEAKER_09]: I was more impressed with their Star Trek game they're making, but the Pirates game seemed pretty solid.

12:45.776 --> 12:47.417
[SPEAKER_09]: For a movie title, you don't expect...

12:48.260 --> 12:48.760
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:07.847 --> 13:08.708
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

13:09.308 --> 13:11.571
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to probably check it out when it comes out in September.

13:12.451 --> 13:14.173
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, Reservoir Dogs.

13:14.653 --> 13:18.077
[SPEAKER_10]: That's got me interested now that they explained why it was banned in Australia.

13:18.137 --> 13:19.258
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, where's my Kill Bill game?

13:19.278 --> 13:19.798
[SPEAKER_10]: Why was it banned?

13:20.659 --> 13:21.200
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's your what game?

13:21.360 --> 13:22.441
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you listen to this show?

13:22.761 --> 13:23.522
[SPEAKER_09]: Just out of curiosity?

13:23.922 --> 13:25.103
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

13:25.143 --> 13:25.744
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's your what game?

13:26.465 --> 13:26.845
[SPEAKER_09]: Kill Bill.

13:27.285 --> 13:27.686
[SPEAKER_10]: Kill Bill?

13:27.846 --> 13:28.006
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

13:30.216 --> 13:31.137
[SPEAKER_10]: Red Steel.

13:31.417 --> 13:32.518
[SPEAKER_10]: Red Steel is probably close enough.

13:32.698 --> 13:38.061
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn off all the color on your TV and then play some really gory game and there you go.

13:38.101 --> 13:39.761
[SPEAKER_06]: There's your Kill Bill game.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.983
[SPEAKER_09]: Misty in our chatroom says, Who needs new games?

13:43.023 --> 13:45.845
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing the hell out of Emerald and Tetris Worlds on GBA.

13:48.406 --> 13:51.148
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeremy Todd 1 wants to know if Battle for Middle Earth 2 is any good.

13:51.188 --> 13:52.468
[SPEAKER_09]: He's thinking about getting it for PC.

13:52.528 --> 13:53.169
[SPEAKER_09]: How's the first one?

13:53.189 --> 13:53.649
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

13:54.246 --> 13:56.247
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it got pretty decent reviews.

13:57.047 --> 14:12.111
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, though, it doesn't really look that... I used to love RTS games, especially the Command & Conquer series, but I think I liked it mainly because I could use... I could cheat and make my own characters, almost.

14:12.672 --> 14:15.452
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that was more fun to me than actually playing through the game.

14:15.793 --> 14:18.833
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do like... I love the online from Red Alert.

14:18.873 --> 14:19.934
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my favorite game.

14:19.954 --> 14:20.614
[SPEAKER_10]: You know,

14:20.919 --> 14:21.780
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in my day Back in my day

14:44.316 --> 14:47.578
[SPEAKER_09]: Bandit sent me a private message in chat saying he had a great gaming week.

14:47.618 --> 14:51.199
[SPEAKER_09]: His local arcade just got DDR Supernova and his legs are killing him.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.160
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely worth it.

14:52.180 --> 14:55.001
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess DDR Supernova is starting to get into arcades there.

14:55.021 --> 14:59.824
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, I know a large part of our fan base has followed us from the Bomani days when we talked a lot about those type of games.

14:59.844 --> 15:04.306
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, I'm definitely looking forward to checking out the final build of Dance Dance Revolution Supernova.

15:04.426 --> 15:08.608
[SPEAKER_06]: We just got them in the bay at the Golf Lands, but of course we've had it at Konami forever.

15:09.388 --> 15:11.129
[SPEAKER_06]: and... Well, la-di-da.

15:11.529 --> 15:24.112
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm curious to hear what people think of the timing, because, I mean, I haven't played it enough to, like, really figure out if it's bad or not, but I'm hearing reports that it's pretty dang terrible.

15:24.492 --> 15:33.254
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if anybody has played it, like that one guy, whoever you just said, I would be interested in hearing what he has to say.

15:33.694 --> 15:36.955
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, let's get into some gaming news, and we'll come back to chatroom comments a little later.

15:37.675 --> 15:37.735
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

15:38.399 --> 15:47.623
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I do want to point out real fast, I did look up Gradius on GameFAQs, and I don't see anything about there being the hidden game.

15:48.884 --> 15:55.267
[SPEAKER_09]: So that kind of disappoints me, that they don't have Salamander locked away in it.

15:55.407 --> 15:56.207
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes me kind of sad.

15:57.248 --> 15:58.528
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let's get into some news.

15:58.548 --> 16:00.209
[SPEAKER_09]: This made a lot of people sad this week.

16:00.429 --> 16:04.311
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly was a polarizing topic in the gaming community.

16:05.195 --> 16:10.198
[SPEAKER_09]: You might have heard Sony actually put out an ad for their ceramic white PSP.

16:10.598 --> 16:14.421
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the ad actually only ran on billboards in the Netherlands.

16:14.501 --> 16:18.843
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course, thanks to the internet, the image has circulated worldwide.

16:19.344 --> 16:22.986
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you haven't seen the image yet, go to just about any major gaming site.

16:23.006 --> 16:23.986
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see a picture of this.

16:24.046 --> 16:30.230
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a white woman with white hair wearing a white outfit kind of grabbing this billboard.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.919
[SPEAKER_09]: Black Woman with Black Hair in a Black Outfit

16:54.351 --> 16:55.633
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony Spokesperson GamesIndustry.biz

17:16.650 --> 17:23.472
[SPEAKER_09]: Central to this campaign has been the creation of some stunningly photographed imagery that has been used on large billboards throughout Holland.

17:23.912 --> 17:31.735
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the 100 or so images created for the campaign have been designed to show this contrast in colors of the PSPs and have no other messages or purpose.

17:32.435 --> 17:32.795
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

17:33.376 --> 17:34.956
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think of this?

17:35.036 --> 17:37.457
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people are stupid for reacting about it.

17:37.517 --> 17:37.897
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

17:38.297 --> 17:38.858
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really.

17:38.918 --> 17:39.598
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's retarded.

17:40.058 --> 17:42.619
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, some of the other pictures that they showed weren't that bad.

17:42.679 --> 17:46.160
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they showed like, you know, a cut in half and basically one's white, one's

17:46.841 --> 17:50.583
[SPEAKER_10]: Black, not necessarily showing the women, you know, poking each other or whatever.

17:50.943 --> 17:54.684
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a fucking ad in another country.

17:55.025 --> 18:00.367
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thing that pisses me off the most is when politicians over here are going, I don't want to see that in my neighborhood.

18:00.527 --> 18:05.669
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, your neighborhood is all the way up in fucking, you know, what, Denmark is where it was?

18:06.249 --> 18:09.631
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's stupid that, especially Congressman Yee.

18:10.531 --> 18:12.412
[SPEAKER_10]: That guy's a dumbass and needs to shut up.

18:12.432 --> 18:12.492
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

18:14.110 --> 18:16.492
[SPEAKER_10]: Make a political statement about something that's in another country.

18:16.532 --> 18:18.113
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll do what they fucking want.

18:18.173 --> 18:20.555
[SPEAKER_11]: They have nudity on television over in the UK.

18:20.755 --> 18:22.636
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't see them going, Oh my God!

18:22.876 --> 18:23.717
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God!

18:24.017 --> 18:25.438
[SPEAKER_11]: Two people of different color.

18:25.719 --> 18:28.080
[SPEAKER_11]: I have never seen that in my entire life.

18:28.361 --> 18:30.022
[SPEAKER_11]: And oh my God, it's so racist.

18:30.042 --> 18:33.484
[SPEAKER_09]: To be a devil's advocate here for a minute though, Sony, I mean, just, you know, give the aside.

18:33.544 --> 18:35.166
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not really sure how I feel about this.

18:35.246 --> 18:35.466
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't...

18:36.588 --> 18:48.303
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the image is a little odd and it doesn't exactly make me excited about the... I kind of go, well that's certainly going to get attention, which I guess an advertising campaign is supposed to do, but it's kind of one of those...

18:49.793 --> 18:53.094
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't put an image like that out advertising Orange Lounge Radio, that's for sure.

18:53.935 --> 18:56.396
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what the worst thing about that image is?

18:56.716 --> 18:56.916
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

18:57.436 --> 18:59.657
[SPEAKER_06]: That Europe's getting the white PSP and we're not.

18:59.837 --> 19:00.717
[SPEAKER_06]: That made me angry.

19:00.757 --> 19:03.559
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing that I really got from that.

19:03.619 --> 19:09.621
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, my point though is that Sony is a worldwide company, though, and they do release products here in the United States.

19:09.961 --> 19:14.465
[SPEAKER_09]: And granted, when they're going to do something like this, thanks to the internet, this image has made it worldwide.

19:14.485 --> 19:19.589
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to show up in magazines here, not as an ad, but just the buzz about it.

19:19.670 --> 19:22.072
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sony being a worldwide company who does put out products here.

19:23.153 --> 19:25.835
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, yeah, it's such a wonderful advertising campaign.

19:25.855 --> 19:31.440
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the last one with the really annoying, sketchy squirrels and dust balls that talked about the PSP.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.223
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, it made me want to really go out and buy a PSP, just like this one.

19:35.263 --> 19:37.365
[SPEAKER_10]: This does not make me want to go out and buy a PSP.

19:38.260 --> 19:42.042
[SPEAKER_10]: They really need to cut off the cancerous PR department of Sony.

19:42.102 --> 19:45.104
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the problem stems from.

19:46.324 --> 19:49.046
[SPEAKER_10]: People that get to do the advertising are retarded.

19:49.446 --> 19:51.867
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this advertisement is actually okay.

19:51.987 --> 19:53.128
[SPEAKER_06]: It really doesn't bother me.

19:53.488 --> 20:02.433
[SPEAKER_06]: And a couple of my co-workers, when we saw that ad, the first time we just looked at it not very intensely, I didn't even see the black woman there, actually.

20:02.793 --> 20:05.074
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, a white chick advertising the PSP.

20:05.294 --> 20:06.455
[SPEAKER_06]: What's racist about that?

20:07.316 --> 20:07.636
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see it.

20:34.978 --> 20:38.679
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's some that are not even really that bad.

20:39.319 --> 20:39.820
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.901
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you think the media just latched onto this one image and now it's become this big misunderstanding?

20:43.961 --> 20:47.702
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because they have Slow News Week and they really need something to talk about.

20:48.362 --> 20:49.443
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting perspective.

20:51.743 --> 20:55.605
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to the chat room, Funnydale says, Thank God Sony never released the PSP in yellow.

20:56.565 --> 20:56.885
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh boy.

20:57.669 --> 20:58.770
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I want to say stuff.

20:59.070 --> 20:59.450
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

20:59.990 --> 21:00.330
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

21:00.350 --> 21:00.910
[SPEAKER_09]: But I won't.

21:01.090 --> 21:01.411
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

21:01.471 --> 21:04.672
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, some striking imagery there.

21:04.772 --> 21:09.854
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely provoking reaction, which I guess an ad campaign is supposed to do.

21:09.914 --> 21:10.794
[SPEAKER_09]: But is it ethical?

21:10.994 --> 21:11.775
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the question.

21:12.155 --> 21:13.975
[SPEAKER_09]: So definitely looking forward to your feedback.

21:13.995 --> 21:15.976
[SPEAKER_09]: And we definitely want to get your feedback on this issue.

21:16.336 --> 21:19.638
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll tell you a little more information on how you can do that a little later in the program.

21:20.918 --> 21:23.399
[SPEAKER_10]: It wouldn't be the first time that they're advertising, you know,

21:24.244 --> 21:24.744
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.

21:49.127 --> 21:50.088
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

22:14.276 --> 22:20.979
[SPEAKER_10]: That, of course, has been fixed and still no official word from Sony about what their PR firm did.

22:21.079 --> 22:23.380
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's still kind of funny seeing an Apple logo on there.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.041
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I don't know.

22:26.261 --> 22:35.205
[SPEAKER_10]: Another speculation was that they were using some Apple software, a product called Apple Shake, to create the file.

22:35.285 --> 22:39.567
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were using a beta, not beta, but a demo version that wasn't allowed.

22:39.687 --> 22:41.208
[SPEAKER_10]: So it kept a watermark on there.

22:41.516 --> 22:42.917
[SPEAKER_09]: That, to me, is incredibly funny.

22:43.157 --> 22:46.479
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'd read that theory, too, that they were using the trial software.

22:46.519 --> 22:46.879
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.821
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Sony never steals from anybody.

22:49.261 --> 22:49.621
[SPEAKER_09]: Ever.

22:49.701 --> 22:50.622
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, look, though.

22:50.682 --> 22:51.122
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

22:51.402 --> 22:52.403
[SPEAKER_09]: It's their PR firm.

22:52.443 --> 22:54.384
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it has nothing to do with Sony.

22:54.424 --> 22:54.805
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

22:54.865 --> 22:58.187
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's easy to pick on Sony in this day and age after E3, but come on.

22:58.267 --> 23:03.210
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you either have Apples or PCs at your place of employment.

23:03.270 --> 23:05.191
[SPEAKER_09]: Even Sony probably uses these type of computers.

23:05.211 --> 23:11.055
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing is, though, is it's actually from, you know, it's from, like,

23:11.966 --> 23:14.929
[SPEAKER_10]: An actual flash file from what looks like the iPod side.

23:15.009 --> 23:22.635
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, they've disassembled it, taken that part out of the background, which is like the smoke effect, looks like smoke dropping from the ceiling, kind of rolling along the ground stuff.

23:23.195 --> 23:29.201
[SPEAKER_10]: And they've taken it out, and just that one section they've isolated, and it's clearly stolen from something.

23:29.221 --> 23:31.182
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe that's just a stock effect in the program.

23:31.542 --> 23:34.865
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's something clearly stolen from something else.

23:34.985 --> 23:35.466
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

23:35.506 --> 23:37.467
[SPEAKER_10]: So somebody... It's in trouble.

23:37.668 --> 23:39.209
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just kind of sloppy.

23:40.353 --> 23:40.633
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.454
[SPEAKER_10]: It is funny, though.

23:41.754 --> 23:47.137
[SPEAKER_10]: People are speculating, oh my god, what if the announcement happens with... No, not going to happen.

23:48.738 --> 24:03.205
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody in our chat room, TigerClaw, reminded me of something I was supposed to mention earlier during the last story about the ad, is that Control-Alt-Delete, the comic, ran a pretty funny response to the ad that had a skinny white guy and a fat white guy, and it was an ad for the DS Lite.

24:03.626 --> 24:03.926
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

24:04.006 --> 24:04.286
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

24:04.696 --> 24:06.197
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I thought that was pretty funny.

24:06.377 --> 24:07.678
[SPEAKER_09]: That's creative marketing.

24:07.938 --> 24:09.298
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's just... It was real.

24:09.438 --> 24:10.619
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a creative response.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.541
[SPEAKER_09]: And a very interesting comic.

24:14.741 --> 24:19.564
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway... They should get something like a DS on an operating table with, like, a liposuction tube.

24:19.924 --> 24:22.645
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, like, that would be a good advertising campaign.

24:22.685 --> 24:25.967
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, like, a picture of, you know, Oprah when she was big and Oprah when she was skinny.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.488
[SPEAKER_09]: Or any celebrity this last week.

24:27.528 --> 24:29.729
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, Roseanne.

24:30.382 --> 24:30.502
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

24:30.522 --> 24:30.742
[SPEAKER_09]: Goatsy

24:51.909 --> 24:52.549
[SPEAKER_09]: You make me sad.

24:53.689 --> 25:05.012
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Sony and kicking them while they're down, it almost seems like, it looks like Sony has been ordered to pay $243 million in back taxes to the Japanese government.

25:05.372 --> 25:09.453
[SPEAKER_09]: These taxes are related to transactions between the games division and the U.S.

25:09.513 --> 25:14.894
[SPEAKER_09]: subsidiary of the company, as well as overseas transactions relating to CD and DVD making.

25:15.554 --> 25:16.694
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony had a comment on this.

25:16.754 --> 25:21.455
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony and SCEI believe that their allocation of income for the periods in question was appropriate.

25:21.775 --> 25:25.116
[SPEAKER_09]: and they have paid the proper amount of taxes in each of the jurisdictions.

25:25.877 --> 25:28.358
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, these guys just aren't getting a break this year.

25:28.398 --> 25:30.559
[SPEAKER_09]: This is... The bad news keeps on coming.

25:31.599 --> 25:34.240
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like beating a dead hooker over and over and over again.

25:34.441 --> 25:36.081
[SPEAKER_10]: Which you could do in one of their games.

25:36.261 --> 25:36.702
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

25:37.382 --> 25:39.303
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's also on the Xbox, to be fair.

25:39.963 --> 25:48.327
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, that's not really the bad part about it, but analysts are saying that the PS3 could be third in the next-gen console race, and mainly the...

25:49.235 --> 25:58.577
[SPEAKER_10]: The basis of this is that their brand strength is not enough to get people to spend the $600 on their system.

25:59.437 --> 26:10.319
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like where you had the PlayStation 2 come out at a better time and for a lot less, whereas that fueled the whole DVD launch.

26:12.159 --> 26:14.940
[SPEAKER_10]: Nowadays, it's like, do you really need Blu-ray?

26:15.180 --> 26:15.400
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean,

26:16.451 --> 26:16.771
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

26:17.071 --> 26:18.412
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony believes we do.

26:19.052 --> 26:20.693
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony would like you to think that you need Blu-ray.

26:20.713 --> 26:21.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony also thinks we need UMD stuff.

26:21.993 --> 26:22.813
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing though.

26:23.213 --> 26:25.934
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, my thought on it is Blu-ray, I don't need it.

26:26.074 --> 26:27.695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't need HD DVD either.

26:27.915 --> 26:32.777
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, not really a fault in Sony for bringing on the Blu-ray.

26:32.957 --> 26:34.658
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you can use that for their games and stuff.

26:34.678 --> 26:37.238
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine to have their own proprietary format for the games.

26:37.539 --> 26:43.301
[SPEAKER_10]: So even if it doesn't work as a DVD video system or whatever, it'll still work for their games.

26:43.921 --> 26:44.161
[SPEAKER_10]: Well,

26:44.784 --> 26:46.305
[SPEAKER_10]: Same goes with HD DVD.

26:46.345 --> 26:47.326
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I need that either.

26:48.887 --> 26:55.032
[SPEAKER_09]: I would benefit from an HD DVD player or even Blu-ray, but when the price is right, that's my issue.

26:55.213 --> 27:04.961
[SPEAKER_06]: My issue with Sony right now is that, like the name for Nintendo's new system, I've gotten almost over the fact that the only model worth getting is the $600 one.

27:05.321 --> 27:10.926
[SPEAKER_06]: They just haven't shown anything that's going to be out anytime soon that looks even remotely interesting.

27:10.946 --> 27:13.908
[SPEAKER_10]: I look at the launch list and I'm like, so what?

27:14.358 --> 27:17.499
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, there was like a game, like for example, I was like, ooh, Full Auto 2.

27:17.659 --> 27:23.461
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, I gotta, you know, that's a really good, you know, I love Full Auto, you know, almost, you know, maybe I should get the system for that.

27:23.641 --> 27:26.502
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wait, Full Auto 2's coming out for the Xbox 360 later on.

27:27.162 --> 27:28.683
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well I don't need to get the system then.

27:29.059 --> 27:30.680
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, what would they have that's exclusive?

27:30.740 --> 27:31.260
[SPEAKER_10]: Motorstorm?

27:31.440 --> 27:32.281
[SPEAKER_10]: Meh, lame.

27:32.441 --> 27:35.782
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they'll have Phantavision 2, and then I'll actually have a reason to do that.

27:35.882 --> 27:38.524
[SPEAKER_09]: Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy XIII.

27:38.544 --> 27:40.065
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they going to be launched?

27:40.085 --> 27:41.065
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but they're great.

27:41.765 --> 27:44.687
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying, you will have to get a PS3 eventually if you want to play this game.

27:44.707 --> 27:45.988
[SPEAKER_09]: When it goes down in price.

27:46.008 --> 27:47.408
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great that Metal Gear Solid 4's coming out.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.369
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox 360's been out a year and hasn't gone down in price.

27:50.310 --> 27:56.473
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I don't think that it's going to drop in price anytime soon, and you know, until there's some better games out there, I'm not buying one.

27:56.873 --> 27:57.453
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

27:57.473 --> 27:58.074
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, whatever.

27:58.134 --> 27:58.374
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

27:59.417 --> 28:05.782
[SPEAKER_10]: They could totally pull it out and say, you know, they could have some big secret stuff that they're not talking about and that would be, you know, really amazing.

28:05.822 --> 28:07.023
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it ain't the Eye of Judgment.

28:08.485 --> 28:09.626
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the worst idea.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.607
[SPEAKER_10]: It was that card game, right?

28:11.647 --> 28:12.968
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's the card game.

28:13.068 --> 28:14.289
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing about the Eye of Judgment.

28:14.810 --> 28:16.571
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how the hell they're going to execute this.

28:16.992 --> 28:22.296
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, to be honest, the Eye toy sucks for, you know, that type of gameplay.

28:22.476 --> 28:25.679
[SPEAKER_10]: And the way that they're set up, they have this, like, really elaborate, like,

28:28.240 --> 28:34.282
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see how it's going to be possible to do this, even reasonably why you would want to do this in the first place.

28:34.742 --> 28:41.463
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a great idea as a proof of concept thing, but as a game, I don't see it happening.

28:41.963 --> 28:43.243
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't get how they're going to do it.

28:43.283 --> 28:44.564
[SPEAKER_09]: Chatroom wanted to correct me on something.

28:44.624 --> 28:53.826
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox 360 has actually only been out nine months, not a year, but the price isn't going to drop by November either, as far as we know.

28:53.886 --> 28:55.546
[SPEAKER_06]: I still stand by what I said.

28:55.566 --> 28:55.846
[SPEAKER_06]: It still can...

28:56.964 --> 29:00.388
[SPEAKER_09]: The only reason it would have had to is if PS3 announced it was coming out for $499.

29:00.488 --> 29:03.832
[SPEAKER_09]: Or $399, whatever the Xbox reason is.

29:03.892 --> 29:07.016
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they're not going to drop the price of the 360.

29:07.617 --> 29:13.504
[SPEAKER_10]: If anything, they may drop it later, like once first quarter comes around next year.

29:14.145 --> 29:16.888
[SPEAKER_10]: But they might drop the price of the Xbox.

29:18.343 --> 29:20.204
[SPEAKER_09]: Banda makes an interesting comment in our chat room.

29:20.324 --> 29:24.325
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a PS3 for the games too, but Sony doesn't want to make a console just for games.

29:24.665 --> 29:31.288
[SPEAKER_09]: If it weren't for that damn Blu-ray crap, I like... PS3 is going to be sold more as your living room centerpiece.

29:31.308 --> 29:35.650
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your movie, game, internet, picture, I don't know, system.

29:36.030 --> 29:38.331
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that's going to win Sony any points from people?

29:38.811 --> 29:40.892
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at all.

29:40.952 --> 29:41.572
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the thing.

29:41.612 --> 29:45.093
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a PSP as well, and what do I use it for?

29:45.233 --> 29:46.374
[SPEAKER_10]: I use it for games.

29:46.634 --> 29:46.934
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't...

29:47.974 --> 29:48.955
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any pictures on it.

29:49.256 --> 29:51.017
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any movies on it.

29:51.178 --> 29:57.223
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, but I've heard from listeners who download our show on their PSP, and we have the PSP websites, which are pretty kick-butt.

29:57.263 --> 30:00.767
[SPEAKER_09]: So some people out there are getting used to some of the other functions of the PSP.

30:01.448 --> 30:02.709
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the web stuff on the PSP.

30:02.729 --> 30:05.792
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's funny, too, about the whole PS3 thing?

30:05.932 --> 30:08.054
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still floating around out there that they're saying that

30:09.058 --> 30:13.782
[SPEAKER_10]: It's possible that Sony may do that thing to eliminate used game sales.

30:15.864 --> 30:16.725
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't buy it.

30:17.325 --> 30:25.071
[SPEAKER_10]: They're trying to push for digital distribution, and I really think they're trying it out with this PSP emulation thing.

30:25.231 --> 30:30.776
[SPEAKER_10]: If it works well for that, they're going to move it to... I bet you that's probably going to be on the PS3 when that comes out.

30:30.976 --> 30:32.297
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's keep it moving here.

30:32.697 --> 30:34.079
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about this on the PSP.

30:34.139 --> 30:36.781
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is actually a pretty cool idea here.

30:37.081 --> 30:40.044
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a story that ran on Kotaku.

30:40.084 --> 30:51.193
[SPEAKER_09]: A graduate student, Jonas Heilscher, put together this interesting piece that he put on YouTube that is this game where you go around and you're looking for access points.

30:51.533 --> 30:59.980
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you collect the access points, you get a distinct color, shape, or sound based based on whatever that MAC address is of the point that you find.

31:00.593 --> 31:06.217
[SPEAKER_09]: and what you do is you fill this three by three grid with shapes trying to get three in a row as you find the points.

31:06.717 --> 31:12.941
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if you ever get an unsecure access point though, it might wipe the grid clean or act as a wild card.

31:13.021 --> 31:19.024
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically the game encourages you to get out and walk, which I think is a neat idea.

31:19.725 --> 31:22.006
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's kind of a cool concept for a game.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.447
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's nothing that

31:23.752 --> 31:26.834
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think would ever be sold, but it was a cute tech demo idea.

31:27.395 --> 31:30.237
[SPEAKER_09]: That reminds me of when they were going to release a GPS thing.

31:30.437 --> 31:31.258
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, geocaching.

31:31.278 --> 31:32.158
[SPEAKER_09]: It made me think of that too.

31:32.999 --> 31:34.780
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a great idea for the PSP.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.221
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be a lot of fun.

31:36.241 --> 31:43.587
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine, this might sound really cheesy, but take one of those TV shows like Treasure Hunters, The Game, or something that could rely on geocaching.

31:44.127 --> 31:49.451
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that you would really travel around the world for real, but maybe something that interacts with the geocache to kind of

31:49.929 --> 31:55.491
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, encourage people to go outside and use their PSPs and kind of interact in a whole different way.

31:56.111 --> 31:56.851
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be a neat idea.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.231
[SPEAKER_06]: But the screen sucks outside.

31:59.071 --> 31:59.412
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.

31:59.532 --> 32:00.772
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's a good point.

32:00.812 --> 32:02.552
[SPEAKER_10]: The LCD screens really do suck.

32:02.612 --> 32:04.573
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't you get something, though, that kind of helps that?

32:04.593 --> 32:08.034
[SPEAKER_10]: An umbrella?

32:08.054 --> 32:11.835
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you design the lights, lighting and everything correctly, it might work okay.

32:13.835 --> 32:18.337
[SPEAKER_09]: It does require firmware 2.0 to play and they do plan on putting it on their site in the near future.

32:18.397 --> 32:18.957
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Pixel 6

32:20.319 --> 32:20.940
[SPEAKER_09]: So check it out.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.180
[SPEAKER_09]: The name of the game is Collectic.

32:22.420 --> 32:23.641
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's actually pretty cool.

32:24.281 --> 32:35.225
[SPEAKER_10]: And kind of back to what we were talking about before, both Sega and Ubisoft want the PS3 to drop in price.

32:36.186 --> 32:49.311
[SPEAKER_10]: They're basically saying that it's too expensive and they're worried that because it is so expensive that it might not be competitive enough with the Xbox 360 and not as many units may sell

32:50.032 --> 33:04.607
[SPEAKER_10]: and of course that affects them especially when they're releasing games on those consoles because they're unable to make as many or sell as many on that system so you know that's kind of a I think that's a shared sentiment from everybody that they want the price to drop but

33:05.182 --> 33:15.846
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't crazy Sony guy, I forget his name, Kaz Harai or whatever, didn't he say that he's not even guaranteeing that the price of games would be $59.99 or whatever?

33:16.607 --> 33:17.667
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he said it could be more.

33:18.287 --> 33:22.129
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be, but that's not a good way to sell your console.

33:22.589 --> 33:25.230
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a console, it's a media center.

33:26.110 --> 33:26.590
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

33:27.471 --> 33:29.712
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so, interesting.

33:30.032 --> 33:30.412
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.221
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's switch consoles for a minute here.

33:33.261 --> 33:35.243
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go over and talk about the Nintendo Wii.

33:35.283 --> 33:36.964
[SPEAKER_09]: This shouldn't be a surprise to anybody.

33:37.725 --> 33:41.988
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people like to joke about the power brick that comes with the Xbox 360 because that thing is huge.

33:42.348 --> 33:50.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, pictures have leaked of the Wii's power supply, and it's not so big, but it's about the size of the GameCube power supply.

33:50.234 --> 33:53.196
[SPEAKER_09]: But honestly, is this a huge surprise considering that

33:53.780 --> 33:57.542
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't be surprised if it was running on the same power supply as the GameCube.

33:57.562 --> 33:58.102
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just like the...

34:12.382 --> 34:17.830
[SPEAKER_10]: The PlayStation 2, how you can use all the audio cables and video cables with the PlayStation 1.

34:18.010 --> 34:20.233
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh hell, those Nintendo cables you can use.

34:20.293 --> 34:24.339
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the same cables for Super Nintendo all the way through GameCube.

34:24.700 --> 34:26.322
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use that same AV thing.

34:27.323 --> 34:28.084
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

34:28.104 --> 34:29.226
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the way to do it, I think.

34:30.049 --> 34:31.611
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, it's just an AV cable.

34:32.252 --> 34:34.315
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that kind of technology doesn't change.

34:34.355 --> 34:46.773
[SPEAKER_09]: But what is interesting is even though we know that the Wii is not going to support high def 720 or whatever, maybe they'll still release, you know, red, green, blue.

34:47.281 --> 34:47.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Progressive?

34:49.242 --> 34:49.583
[SPEAKER_09]: Component?

34:49.603 --> 34:50.103
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it, thank you.

34:50.143 --> 34:50.623
[SPEAKER_09]: Component.

34:50.924 --> 34:52.325
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll still release component cables.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.646
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't GameCube for a little while have component cables?

34:55.147 --> 34:56.428
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just really hard to come by now.

34:56.448 --> 34:59.470
[SPEAKER_10]: Even on the Xbox, remember the Xbox, some of the games were actually 720p.

35:00.150 --> 35:00.971
[SPEAKER_10]: Very few, but yeah.

35:01.091 --> 35:14.201
[SPEAKER_10]: Very few, but still, I mean, I would like to see, you know, sure their focus is not going to be high def, but if someone wants to do a high def game to maybe allow some way to do that, I think that would be kind of cool.

35:15.562 --> 35:15.842
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

35:16.462 --> 35:21.144
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I remember some of the games for the GameCube were progressive scan as well.

35:22.684 --> 35:27.145
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you had a few that were widescreen at least, like F-Zero is pretty kick-ass.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.746
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I don't know.

35:29.886 --> 35:35.228
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not because I don't have component cables for the GameCube because they're so freaking hard to find.

35:35.268 --> 35:36.048
[SPEAKER_09]: I still don't have them.

35:36.088 --> 35:38.769
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a digital out on the GameCube, but I just don't have those cables.

35:39.369 --> 35:44.351
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, F-Zero just doesn't look as good as, you know,

35:44.918 --> 35:47.639
[SPEAKER_09]: Even an Xbox game that did have the component cables.

35:47.679 --> 35:48.700
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

35:49.960 --> 35:56.923
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, speaking of Nintendo, there was announcements made about their brand new line of games that's going to be coming out.

35:56.943 --> 36:04.146
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like the Touch Generations, whereas those were not really games per se, but more of kind of

36:04.738 --> 36:08.461
[SPEAKER_10]: for everybody type stuff, you know, or Nintendogs and Brain Training, etc.

36:09.301 --> 36:14.665
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now they have a brand new lineup called Bit Generations, and these actually look pretty sweet.

36:15.445 --> 36:26.053
[SPEAKER_10]: Included in that are going to be, you know, puzzle and rhythm games designed for the Game Boy Advance, including DotStream, Boldish, Dialhex,

36:27.059 --> 36:46.837
[SPEAKER_10]: Digidrive, Orbital, Colorist, and Sound Voyager and they're all really simple looking games but they all look really cool actually and pretty fun to play and they're going to be for about $25 in American and will ship in the second and fourth weeks in July in Japan

36:48.152 --> 36:49.933
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other new games are coming out for the DS.

36:49.973 --> 36:51.474
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just the DS, but the PSP.

36:52.155 --> 36:54.997
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're coming from one of my favorite developers, Q Entertainment.

36:55.197 --> 36:56.758
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I love Luminous and Meteos.

36:56.778 --> 36:58.599
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are two of my favorite games that came out last year.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.161
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there are new games coming out.

37:00.201 --> 37:02.742
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not talking about Luminous 2 or Every Extend Extra.

37:02.782 --> 37:03.683
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about some other stuff.

37:04.484 --> 37:10.008
[SPEAKER_09]: Famitsu Magazine is reporting that Bandai Namco is going to be publishing two new Q Entertainment games.

37:10.108 --> 37:13.190
[SPEAKER_09]: One is going to be out for the PSP, and it's called Gun P.R.

37:13.230 --> 37:14.651
[SPEAKER_09]: It's short for Gun P. Reverse.

37:15.191 --> 37:20.274
[SPEAKER_09]: And the DS is going to get a game that translates to the name Connect the Sounds, Gun P. Reverse.

37:20.834 --> 37:26.438
[SPEAKER_09]: Both are music-based puzzle games, and they're based on a 1999 WonderSwan game called Gun P.,

37:27.359 --> 37:40.209
[SPEAKER_09]: too bad Jamie's not here because she'd probably actually know that one because I never owned a Wonderswan but she did oh no, duh, I mean I do have a Wonderswan thanks to a gracious listener but I have one game for it I don't really play a lot of Wonderswan games maybe I should check this one out though

37:41.866 --> 37:49.169
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, for those that haven't played it, it's got square pieces and they all have a diagonal line and it rises from the bottom of the screen to the top.

37:49.229 --> 37:53.931
[SPEAKER_09]: You move the pieces up and down, trying to get a line going from left to right.

37:54.451 --> 37:56.372
[SPEAKER_09]: The panels will then disappear if you do this.

37:56.952 --> 38:00.293
[SPEAKER_09]: The game ends early if the pieces get to the top of the field.

38:00.834 --> 38:07.016
[SPEAKER_09]: On the PSP version, there'll be emphasis on music and video, kind of like Luminous, how it had skins.

38:07.595 --> 38:14.478
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the DS, it's going to be more stylus emphasized as opposed to having the skins.

38:14.518 --> 38:20.020
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the game will still make sounds when you clear panel, and it'll try to line up the sounds with the background music.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.541
[SPEAKER_09]: So that should be interesting.

38:22.441 --> 38:23.922
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds a lot like that game.

38:24.202 --> 38:25.303
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a PopCap game.

38:26.203 --> 38:27.224
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the fireworks.

38:28.224 --> 38:30.945
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a festival game with the fireworks.

38:30.985 --> 38:31.966
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even remember the name of it now.

38:32.846 --> 38:33.686
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure someone chatted.

38:33.726 --> 38:34.186
[SPEAKER_09]: No idea.

38:34.367 --> 38:35.327
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure someone chatted.

38:36.220 --> 38:37.101
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little different though.

38:37.121 --> 38:40.043
[SPEAKER_09]: You turn these, but you're trying to line things up from left to right.

38:40.063 --> 38:42.605
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you do that, these fireworks go off and you get points.

38:43.125 --> 38:44.386
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a cheesy game.

38:44.466 --> 38:49.289
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be a cool game for our latest Nintendo DS owner here.

38:50.410 --> 38:57.034
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bush was actually given a Nintendo DS and brain training for his 60th birthday.

38:57.094 --> 38:58.355
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder what Nintendo's trying to tell him.

38:58.595 --> 38:59.415
[SPEAKER_10]: That he's stupid.

39:01.096 --> 39:07.061
[SPEAKER_10]: And they attach the letter to it and says, Don't worry, turning 60 is an exciting milestone.

39:07.181 --> 39:13.967
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, you've joined the millions of other baby boomers in an invigorating new decade of your life.

39:14.407 --> 39:18.070
[SPEAKER_10]: And like many boomers, you may be looking for ways to keep your mind sharp.

39:18.491 --> 39:19.512
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where we come in.

39:20.733 --> 39:25.176
[SPEAKER_10]: Please accept our gift of a new Nintendo DS Lite and a copy of Brain Age.

39:25.296 --> 39:27.178
[SPEAKER_10]: Train your brain in minutes a day.

39:27.638 --> 39:29.440
[SPEAKER_09]: And what do you think actually ended up happening to that?

39:30.189 --> 39:30.570
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

39:39.141 --> 39:39.641
[SPEAKER_09]: He might.

39:40.162 --> 39:44.404
[SPEAKER_09]: He's, you know, a normal guy despite, you know, the fact I disagree with the politics or whatever.

39:44.444 --> 39:45.205
[SPEAKER_09]: He seems to be a normal guy.

39:45.225 --> 39:46.065
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he has a lot of time off.

39:46.105 --> 39:47.086
[SPEAKER_10]: So he has a lot of time off.

39:47.206 --> 39:48.087
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he'll check it out.

39:48.107 --> 39:49.828
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, something to do on Air Force One.

39:49.868 --> 39:50.228
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

39:50.888 --> 39:51.109
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

39:51.129 --> 39:51.409
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

39:51.489 --> 39:54.491
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually a super secret spy device to find out what's going on.

39:54.531 --> 39:59.194
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat room seems to think President Bush probably won't even be able to turn the damn DS light on.

39:59.214 --> 40:00.775
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

40:00.875 --> 40:01.595
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are harsh.

40:01.795 --> 40:03.757
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get these fangled computer things.

40:03.777 --> 40:04.037
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

40:05.979 --> 40:06.820
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

40:06.940 --> 40:10.363
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if you are craving for some new games, we have some release dates for you.

40:10.403 --> 40:11.224
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to start it off.

40:11.264 --> 40:16.889
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Jamie's not here tonight, but I don't want to neglect the UK audience because we have some awesome UK listeners.

40:17.610 --> 40:21.374
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think next year, I know I keep saying I want to go to Australia, but I'm torn.

40:21.434 --> 40:23.075
[SPEAKER_09]: I either want to go to Australia or I want to go to UK.

40:23.175 --> 40:23.596
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the two.

40:24.076 --> 40:26.979
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll probably do one next year and then one the year after that.

40:27.019 --> 40:27.940
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's assuming I'm rich.

40:29.554 --> 40:29.974
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

40:30.015 --> 40:33.418
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, here's some release dates here for the UK.

40:33.498 --> 40:43.108
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys have coming out on the 14th, you have Cars coming out on some various platforms, everything from GameCube, PS2, and Xbox, all the way to the PC and portable platforms as well.

40:44.111 --> 40:46.092
[SPEAKER_09]: Pirates of the Caribbean, The Legend of Jack Sparrow

41:02.719 --> 41:04.021
[SPEAKER_09]: on the Xbox 360.

41:04.101 --> 41:16.015
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking ahead a little bit to the week of the 21st, you guys are getting in the UK, Def Jam Fight for New York, The Takeover on the PSP, Infected on the PSP, and Field Commander on the PSP from Ubisoft.

41:16.316 --> 41:19.099
[SPEAKER_09]: Also coming out for the PlayStation 2, World Super Police.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.362
[SPEAKER_09]: Big week next week in the UK for Sony.

41:21.946 --> 41:24.228
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of stuff for the US too, especially if you have a 360.

41:24.969 --> 41:27.911
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to be getting Prey, of course.

41:28.812 --> 41:29.372
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome game.

41:29.732 --> 41:31.053
[SPEAKER_10]: Chromehounds, also on the 360.

41:31.093 --> 41:40.681
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally, if you don't have a 360, they have Sprint Cars or the Knoxville, which is, I don't know, a game you probably won't want to pick up.

41:41.281 --> 41:44.744
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, the following week, you've got lots of stuff.

41:44.864 --> 41:48.167
[SPEAKER_10]: NCAA Football 2007, of course, on PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PSP.

41:51.493 --> 41:57.216
[SPEAKER_10]: Monster House, Super Dragon Ball Z, Painkiller, Zen-Eyed I don't know, just kind of one of the Japanese shooter games.

41:57.276 --> 41:59.217
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like Raiden 3 or something.

42:22.509 --> 42:23.049
[SPEAKER_10]: XBOX 360 Faceplates

42:41.573 --> 42:43.254
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, it's just Halo graphics with a number 3 on it.

43:02.130 --> 43:03.210
[SPEAKER_10]: Viva Piñata I hate that franchise

43:32.393 --> 43:34.516
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like the snakes on the plane thing for me.

43:35.597 --> 43:48.432
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, there was a new Wii game announced, and I don't know if you're going to be excited by this, because I played the PlayStation 2 version of it, and I didn't like it too much, but Rampage World Tour, or Total Destruction, I mean.

43:48.572 --> 43:49.253
[SPEAKER_09]: Where'd you hear that?

43:49.313 --> 43:49.994
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that another thing?

43:50.214 --> 43:51.335
[SPEAKER_10]: It's through my work, yeah.

43:51.355 --> 43:51.996
[SPEAKER_09]: That seems like a...

43:52.643 --> 44:01.727
[SPEAKER_10]: Odd release, you're right, that game seems a little dated Rampage Total Destruction is going to be coming out on the Wii It's going to be $29.99 Are they going to enhance it at all, you think?

44:01.947 --> 44:21.436
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not, not for $29.99 It's supposed to be out in December I don't know, I didn't like the PlayStation 2 game I thought that it was very unbalanced and just not very fun to play But hey, you know what, it's just another game for us So expect that out in December Any other release date news?

44:23.134 --> 44:25.636
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's all I've got that's brand new.

44:26.958 --> 44:29.060
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of PS3 games coming, that's for sure.

44:30.381 --> 44:32.363
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it looks like we're getting a call on the Skype line.

44:32.403 --> 44:34.264
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the Skype line and see who's there.

44:34.345 --> 44:34.685
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

44:35.586 --> 44:36.066
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello!

44:36.467 --> 44:37.628
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Jamie, is that you?

44:38.428 --> 44:38.929
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

44:39.029 --> 44:39.810
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are you at?

44:40.470 --> 44:41.171
[SPEAKER_03]: San Jose.

44:41.491 --> 44:41.952
[SPEAKER_09]: San Jose.

44:41.992 --> 44:43.093
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on in San Jose today?

44:43.851 --> 44:50.757
[SPEAKER_03]: California Extreme, it's a big coin-op and pinball convention thing.

44:50.817 --> 44:56.201
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the husband kidnapped me, but I figured it's good stuff for Orange Lounge.

45:01.670 --> 45:03.270
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much old games, new games.

45:03.290 --> 45:04.691
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Mambo, a Go-Go.

45:05.271 --> 45:07.832
[SPEAKER_03]: They have actually Hip Hop Mania 2.

45:08.512 --> 45:10.112
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of DDRs.

45:10.452 --> 45:13.333
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of prototype pinballs that I got to play.

45:13.793 --> 45:19.274
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is Kingpin and the other one is Big Bang Bar, which our old listeners will know that I've been into that one for a while.

45:19.634 --> 45:21.015
[SPEAKER_09]: What exactly do they do at this show?

45:21.055 --> 45:25.596
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this just everybody brings their games out and people play them or is it trying to sell machines or what are they doing there?

45:26.383 --> 45:28.985
[SPEAKER_03]: You bring three games, you're in as an exhibitor, you get in for free.

45:29.666 --> 45:33.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, you pay a decent amount to get in.

45:33.289 --> 45:36.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we paid $30 each just for Saturday.

45:37.432 --> 45:37.872
[SPEAKER_09]: And what do they do?

45:37.892 --> 45:39.033
[SPEAKER_09]: They just let you play games all day?

45:39.774 --> 45:40.154
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

45:40.674 --> 45:44.137
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's other little panels going on and different things like that.

45:44.497 --> 45:47.079
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, I'm just following all the games around.

45:47.139 --> 45:52.143
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have a marquee for a Hercules game, which was Atari's biggest pinball machine.

45:52.163 --> 45:52.604
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

45:53.624 --> 45:56.445
[SPEAKER_09]: What are some interesting games that you've actually got a chance to play today?

45:57.506 --> 45:58.066
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Bang Bar.

45:58.946 --> 46:04.208
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got my butt handed to me on Black Knight 2000, which is one of my favorite machines ever.

46:06.629 --> 46:08.790
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan played Arabian Nights, which I thought was pretty cool.

46:08.830 --> 46:15.433
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got like a genie and you hit the lamp and it turns around and you get a different score and everything.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.855
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did play some Beatmania.

46:18.895 --> 46:19.555
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't help myself.

46:21.218 --> 46:27.040
[SPEAKER_03]: and I mainly was just walking around taking pictures for the first part of it, but I'm actually going to go back in and play things.

46:27.140 --> 46:28.281
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few things I want to try.

46:28.681 --> 46:29.161
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

46:29.201 --> 46:30.942
[SPEAKER_09]: Are the pictures going to go on the website later this week?

46:31.622 --> 46:32.443
[SPEAKER_03]: They absolutely will.

46:32.523 --> 46:35.664
[SPEAKER_03]: I also do have some video footage of some of the more rare games, too.

46:35.684 --> 46:36.684
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a tapper there.

46:37.645 --> 46:39.165
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, like root beer tapper?

46:39.705 --> 46:40.246
[SPEAKER_03]: No, tapper.

46:40.906 --> 46:42.086
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Budweiser tapper?

46:42.727 --> 46:43.267
[SPEAKER_03]: Like beer.

46:43.646 --> 46:45.928
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome, because I love Budweiser, Tapper.

46:46.148 --> 46:48.529
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a Poo-Yan machine.

46:48.549 --> 46:50.171
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I remember Poo-Yan.

46:51.311 --> 46:52.032
[SPEAKER_03]: A long time.

46:52.432 --> 46:54.033
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, yeah, I had that on the Commodore 64.

46:54.494 --> 46:55.054
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

46:55.774 --> 46:58.556
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have the Ultra Kade cocktail machines.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.598
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, like to sit down and play?

47:01.576 --> 47:02.777
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, the bar top.

47:03.117 --> 47:06.298
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a few of the tables.

47:06.778 --> 47:15.022
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have the little boxing game, which is like you look down inside of it and you're seeing from the top view of two boxers.

47:15.042 --> 47:16.782
[SPEAKER_03]: They also actually have the mechanical boxing game.

47:18.623 --> 47:20.644
[SPEAKER_09]: So what else are you going to get accomplished today while you're there?

47:21.924 --> 47:33.351
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play a lot more Black Knight 2000 and a lot more Big Bang Bar and hopefully I can run into some of the people who own these machines and ask them about their maintenance and what they've gone into them.

47:33.932 --> 47:35.112
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this something they do every year?

47:36.073 --> 47:37.214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they do this every year.

47:37.334 --> 47:49.161
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, last year, not last year, but the year before that, we tried to go to Classic Gaming Expo and it was really, really slow because this had just finished the week before and nobody wanted to bring their machines back.

47:50.422 --> 47:50.922
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, interesting.

47:51.162 --> 47:54.223
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've got a lot of stuff from classic stuff to new stuff.

47:54.243 --> 47:55.503
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see a lot of new stuff there?

47:56.843 --> 47:58.023
[SPEAKER_03]: There's The Grid.

47:58.623 --> 47:59.023
[SPEAKER_03]: It was there.

48:00.404 --> 48:02.264
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR, like it was a DDR Extreme.

48:02.284 --> 48:03.064
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Solo.

48:03.144 --> 48:04.404
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Mambo Go Go.

48:04.604 --> 48:09.225
[SPEAKER_09]: But nothing like super new, like Soul Calibur 3 Arcade or anything?

48:09.245 --> 48:10.405
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have anything super new there?

48:11.446 --> 48:14.306
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nothing like really, really, really new.

48:14.426 --> 48:17.927
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a Super Scope, not Super Scope, Silent Scope EX.

48:18.367 --> 48:18.587
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh.

48:18.967 --> 48:19.107
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

48:20.982 --> 48:29.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a few of the newer machines that most of it's like late 80s, early 90s.

48:29.307 --> 48:33.270
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few pens from the 40s and 50s.

48:33.790 --> 48:37.773
[SPEAKER_09]: So is this something where people go to buy machines from private collectors?

48:38.533 --> 48:40.515
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't something where they're selling to arcades.

48:40.535 --> 48:44.137
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something where they're selling to hardcore collectors with lots of money, right?

48:44.687 --> 48:45.687
[SPEAKER_03]: They're selling to collectors.

48:45.948 --> 48:50.590
[SPEAKER_03]: And not everything is really expensive, but that Hip Hop Mania machine I was playing, $400.

48:52.351 --> 48:54.692
[SPEAKER_03]: In great condition, much better than Golf Lens ever was.

48:54.892 --> 48:55.492
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

48:55.532 --> 48:56.092
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, cool.

48:56.132 --> 48:57.633
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you going to buy anything?

48:57.693 --> 48:59.074
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you and Dan coming back with anything?

49:00.114 --> 49:00.614
[SPEAKER_03]: Joke's Back and Forth

49:24.011 --> 49:24.731
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

49:24.971 --> 49:25.231
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

49:25.671 --> 49:25.851
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

49:26.251 --> 49:26.492
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

49:26.632 --> 49:28.232
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it was a big deal for me to play one.

49:28.512 --> 49:30.732
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to share about the show with the listeners and anything?

49:31.653 --> 49:32.713
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still going tomorrow.

49:32.753 --> 49:35.153
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone's in the Bay Area or nearby, come check it out.

49:35.433 --> 49:35.893
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth it.

49:36.774 --> 49:37.034
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

49:37.074 --> 49:37.574
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

49:37.654 --> 49:39.014
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's the name of the show again?

49:39.034 --> 49:39.754
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have a website?

49:40.634 --> 49:41.795
[SPEAKER_03]: California Extreme.

49:41.835 --> 49:44.435
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you can just do a Google hunt for it.

49:45.055 --> 49:48.096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's caextreme.com, I think, or .org.

49:48.356 --> 49:48.576
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

49:49.116 --> 49:49.676
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

49:50.056 --> 49:50.336
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

49:50.596 --> 49:51.857
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thanks for calling in.

49:51.897 --> 49:53.457
[SPEAKER_09]: We miss you, and we'll see you next week, okay?

49:54.721 --> 49:55.241
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, later!

50:28.865 --> 50:29.926
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you start us off, Loki?

50:31.127 --> 50:34.170
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you, the stupid people who can't park correctly.

50:34.690 --> 50:42.518
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry this also kind of goes to Christopher, he parked like a bitch, taking up two goddamn spaces with his car.

50:42.858 --> 50:48.964
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw a woman last night driving a stupid minivan, parks in like four spaces, and just walks right out.

50:49.583 --> 50:51.144
[SPEAKER_10]: Dumb bitches from Alaska, though.

50:51.184 --> 50:52.344
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that makes a difference.

50:52.364 --> 50:52.904
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't.

50:53.044 --> 50:56.145
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, still I kind of stare at her like, you're an idiot.

50:56.245 --> 50:56.846
[SPEAKER_10]: Goddamn.

50:56.906 --> 51:05.749
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I understand there's not a lot of people in the parking lot, but when you take up four spaces because you're too fucking lazy to park correctly, I hate people like that.

51:05.769 --> 51:08.490
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry it always seems to be, you know, women in cars.

51:08.850 --> 51:14.472
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, you get, you know, punk-ass bitches who drive their fucking giant trucks that take up six spaces, too.

51:15.272 --> 51:17.553
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the ones that park with the goddamn, you know...

51:18.283 --> 51:23.746
[SPEAKER_10]: U-Haul or some sort of trailer on there and they take up six spaces because they park, you know, across all of them.

51:24.026 --> 51:24.626
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you.

51:25.187 --> 51:29.049
[SPEAKER_10]: You do not need to be going to the movies if you have a goddamn trailer on your truck.

51:29.149 --> 51:30.970
[SPEAKER_10]: So just leave it at home.

51:32.250 --> 51:35.832
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to give an F you for what I believe is the second week in a row to the sun.

51:36.993 --> 51:39.154
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember last week on the show I had a sunburn.

51:39.194 --> 51:39.634
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, guess what?

51:39.654 --> 51:42.456
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was in Canada, I went to Canada with my best friend.

51:42.476 --> 51:44.817
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I was on vacation while I wasn't here on Sunday.

51:45.936 --> 51:48.837
[SPEAKER_09]: and we decided one day randomly we were just going to walk.

51:48.857 --> 51:52.478
[SPEAKER_09]: We were going to walk across this bridge, Berard Bridge, because somebody had told us it was fun.

51:52.498 --> 51:55.879
[SPEAKER_09]: So we walked across, ate some lunch, and we walked back and we were like, let's just keep on walking.

51:56.339 --> 52:05.982
[SPEAKER_09]: So we walked all the way to this place called Stanley Park, which is this huge park in Vancouver that's bigger than Central Park, and we walked the entire perimeter of Stanley Park.

52:06.442 --> 52:12.184
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this whole time I'm worried that I might get a sunburn again, so I'm asking my friend John, I'm like, do I have, am I turning colors, am I turning pink?

52:12.204 --> 52:13.424
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, no, you look fine, you look fine.

52:13.871 --> 52:18.815
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we get back to the hotel after this walk, which, you know, the perimeter of Stanley Park is 10 kilometers.

52:19.155 --> 52:20.857
[SPEAKER_09]: So add into that all the other walking we did.

52:20.877 --> 52:23.579
[SPEAKER_09]: We probably walked more like 10 miles by the time all is said and done.

52:24.260 --> 52:26.902
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we get back to the hotel room, and I'm bright pink.

52:27.002 --> 52:28.423
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, John, I'm bright pink.

52:28.443 --> 52:29.504
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, you didn't look pink earlier.

52:29.544 --> 52:31.105
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm getting redder and redder and redder.

52:31.926 --> 52:34.648
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I had the world's worst summer, and it was horrible.

52:34.948 --> 52:39.052
[SPEAKER_09]: But, and I know this isn't more of an F you, but I will say a big thank you.

52:39.813 --> 52:50.656
[SPEAKER_09]: to Canada's pharmacies because they sell certain drugs in Canada you can't get here in the US and one of them is aloe vera gel with lidocaine in it which is like numbing stuff that you have to get with prescription here.

52:50.716 --> 52:55.718
[SPEAKER_09]: Made my sunburn feel much more bearable but still I had to miss Saturday night clubbing so I was upset with that.

52:56.078 --> 52:57.698
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise I love Canada.

52:57.818 --> 52:58.478
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

52:58.598 --> 53:03.840
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Vancouver and I want to go back and yeah but I wish I just had more money to travel.

53:03.900 --> 53:04.660
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'll just move there.

53:05.681 --> 53:07.141
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll ditch this show and move to Canada.

53:08.507 --> 53:09.868
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane, do you have any angst you want to get out?

53:12.088 --> 53:13.309
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no.

53:14.789 --> 53:17.230
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'm angry about anything right now.

53:18.410 --> 53:18.710
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

53:20.851 --> 53:22.471
[SPEAKER_09]: Well then F you for not being angsty.

53:22.951 --> 53:25.632
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to me for not being angsty.

53:25.872 --> 53:26.192
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

53:26.512 --> 53:27.032
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray.

53:28.033 --> 53:31.654
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on with some more news back into the gaming news.

53:31.694 --> 53:36.595
[SPEAKER_09]: The Final Fantasy 3 DS Wi-Fi feature may have been revealed and it's

53:37.449 --> 53:38.050
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

54:01.351 --> 54:04.512
[SPEAKER_09]: Adventure the World with Friends or something a little more.

54:04.812 --> 54:12.415
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, now to be fair, maybe this is just one element and there's more to come, but if this is it, it's kind of weak.

54:13.175 --> 54:14.756
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess it's better than nothing.

54:15.176 --> 54:17.637
[SPEAKER_09]: It's better than nothing, but it's a little weak.

54:18.417 --> 54:18.898
[SPEAKER_09]: A little lame.

54:20.178 --> 54:20.918
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll still buy it, though.

54:20.938 --> 54:21.339
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong.

54:21.359 --> 54:21.699
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll still buy it.

54:21.719 --> 54:22.179
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm all over that game.

54:22.199 --> 54:26.160
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to have another game for instant messaging and another game that you have to pop in.

54:26.180 --> 54:27.721
[SPEAKER_10]: You're all, okay, I've got to email my friend.

54:28.157 --> 54:29.138
[SPEAKER_10]: in Final Fantasy 3.

54:29.298 --> 54:33.501
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I got to chat with him using Metroid Prime Hunters.

54:33.641 --> 54:35.943
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I got to... No.

54:37.064 --> 54:37.584
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of lame.

54:38.325 --> 54:42.127
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, kind of on a little bit of a different topic here.

54:43.008 --> 54:48.372
[SPEAKER_10]: Square Enix's president was interviewed by IGN here.

54:49.313 --> 54:51.114
[SPEAKER_10]: Or they have the interview on IGN, I should say.

54:52.072 --> 55:03.618
[SPEAKER_10]: and he was talking about basically different things, online gaming, kind of where he sees things going and a little bit about testing their games before they go out, for example.

55:04.278 --> 55:14.224
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things he says is because of the way that they have the systems now where you can patch them later on, extensive testing is not needed to release a game.

55:15.404 --> 55:20.707
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully that's not a trend we're going to start seeing where these games go out like, yeah, it's okay, I'll fix it later.

55:21.482 --> 55:22.283
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter if it doesn't work.

55:22.303 --> 55:23.864
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be out of a job, Miklatov.

55:25.165 --> 55:25.626
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

55:25.846 --> 55:29.329
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because if they don't need testing on the games, they're just going to patch everything.

55:29.569 --> 55:31.871
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't tested a game in forever.

55:31.931 --> 55:33.513
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're moving on up the corporate ladder now, huh?

55:33.533 --> 55:34.574
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm going up the corporate ladder.

55:34.594 --> 55:35.955
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can't talk about what you do, huh?

55:36.015 --> 55:36.515
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I can't.

55:36.535 --> 55:36.896
[SPEAKER_09]: It's lame.

55:36.916 --> 55:43.381
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, the quote here is that game makers have until now incurred great costs during development for debugging.

55:43.822 --> 55:47.345
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, basically, perhaps we can reduce the cost.

55:48.494 --> 55:55.018
[SPEAKER_10]: and suggest that the availability of software updates, developers won't have to work so hard to find the zaniest bugs.

55:56.419 --> 56:02.162
[SPEAKER_10]: And Wada didn't use the word patch strictly, but, you know, that's what his translator said.

56:02.222 --> 56:07.345
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm all for patching games to fix bugs, but at the same time, don't use that as a crutch.

56:07.405 --> 56:08.506
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if your game has a

56:08.971 --> 56:10.452
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, crippling bug in it.

56:10.492 --> 56:13.293
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't release it out there and crash people's systems.

56:13.593 --> 56:18.375
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you remember, like, wasn't there bugs in some Sony game that would, like, fry your memory card or something like that?

56:18.395 --> 56:19.195
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of them.

56:19.415 --> 56:21.456
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, you can't... That's not cool.

56:22.137 --> 56:23.297
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't just patch that.

56:23.337 --> 56:28.599
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta get that out in the testing process and make sure that, you know, you're not gonna release a game that's gonna fry my memory card.

56:28.619 --> 56:30.560
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand, like, some things are a little different.

56:30.620 --> 56:33.562
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, the duping glitch in Oblivion.

56:33.602 --> 56:36.523
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, obviously, that's something that they couldn't have...

56:37.143 --> 56:39.646
[SPEAKER_10]: Found, you know, without really going through there.

56:39.846 --> 56:45.472
[SPEAKER_10]: And no one's saying that the games have to be perfect, but like, for example, the Jaws game that came out that was super duper glitchy.

56:46.141 --> 56:50.924
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, something like that where they can go back and they need to really fix before it goes out.

56:51.004 --> 56:56.588
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you find, like, a bug or an exploit, and even still, I say with the Oblivion exploit, leave it in there.

56:56.628 --> 56:57.969
[SPEAKER_10]: That's your own, you know, bug.

56:58.009 --> 56:59.330
[SPEAKER_10]: And if people want to use it, great.

56:59.350 --> 56:59.830
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll use it.

56:59.990 --> 57:02.091
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, it's not really hurting anything.

57:02.111 --> 57:05.353
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Minkletop, you're saying more things in chat than you're saying on this show.

57:05.514 --> 57:06.434
[SPEAKER_09]: Share your opinion here.

57:06.634 --> 57:10.937
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, my opinion is that, you know, buggy games come out all the time.

57:11.417 --> 57:12.258
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not like...

57:12.967 --> 57:15.709
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because they're saying, oh, we'll release updates for them.

57:15.849 --> 57:18.511
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like they're going to quit finding bugs or anything.

57:18.551 --> 57:26.177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like testing is going to stop because they have this new way to fix bugs that accidentally get shipped.

57:26.537 --> 57:29.480
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like you're going to get a really crappy game.

57:30.100 --> 57:32.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you are going to get a really crappy game from somebody, I'm sure.

57:32.662 --> 57:38.607
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not like you're going to get one that hasn't been tested at all and there's going to be tons and tons of bugs.

57:38.967 --> 57:42.810
[SPEAKER_06]: Just some things happen to fall through the system sometimes.

57:44.634 --> 57:45.054
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

57:45.134 --> 57:46.955
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the demo disc, yeah, for Beautiful Joe 2.

57:47.915 --> 57:49.396
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was really terrible.

57:50.216 --> 57:51.076
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that one of the culprits?

57:51.216 --> 57:53.217
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that erased your memory card.

57:53.237 --> 57:54.057
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, okay, I remember that.

57:55.838 --> 57:58.138
[SPEAKER_09]: I said I never played it, thankfully, or I might have been a little upset.

57:59.939 --> 58:00.079
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

58:00.928 --> 58:07.211
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, you might know that the Xbox 360 had this huge shortage problem when it first came out.

58:07.251 --> 58:19.637
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's being reported that ATI and Silicon Integrated Systems have said that orders for their chips used in the Wii and the Xbox 360 are picking up in preparation for the holiday season.

58:19.697 --> 58:24.019
[SPEAKER_09]: So it looks like, especially hearing that the Wii's on there is a good sign.

58:24.039 --> 58:29.402
[SPEAKER_09]: That means Nintendo is apparently already starting to crank out these systems in preparation for their launch, but of course

58:29.858 --> 58:43.560
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox 360 is not going to go another Christmas without plenty of systems on the shelves for everyone especially so they can really get out there and compete with the PlayStation 3 because you'll have a lot of folks making their final decisions this holiday season so it'll be very interesting.

58:43.803 --> 58:55.605
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and on top of that, it's also interesting that they mention that the Wii is in production because, according to a CNN Money story, they're saying that it's been in production at least since June 21st.

58:56.385 --> 59:07.367
[SPEAKER_10]: And considering the fact that the PlayStation 3 hasn't even begun production yet, and the 360 only had about 69 days before the sale date, that bodes well for gamers if you're looking for the Wii.

59:07.547 --> 59:13.048
[SPEAKER_10]: And it also means that an October or even possibly September launch is very likely.

59:13.992 --> 59:19.414
[SPEAKER_10]: I doubt it's going to be a September launch because they said specifically that it's going to be in the fourth quarter.

59:19.895 --> 59:22.916
[SPEAKER_10]: And, well, you know, September is not the fourth quarter.

59:23.796 --> 59:30.659
[SPEAKER_10]: And anyways, they're supposed to actually be announcing the official date and price for the Wii in September.

59:30.819 --> 59:33.480
[SPEAKER_10]: So until then, we'll just have to wait.

59:33.540 --> 59:36.802
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's more evidence that, you know, it could be coming out in October.

59:38.303 --> 59:53.566
[SPEAKER_10]: at least hopefully they're making it sound like there's not going to be shortages and according to what I've heard at my work we actually might get some at launch which means that there shouldn't be shortages out there because if they're giving them distribution at launch then that's a good sign.

59:53.746 --> 59:54.507
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very good sign.

59:54.907 --> 59:59.968
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, are you still sticking to that October 18th date that you leaked out a while ago on the show?

01:00:00.368 --> 01:00:00.688
[SPEAKER_10]: So far.

01:00:01.248 --> 01:00:05.689
[SPEAKER_10]: Because in our system we had our assistant buyer change all the dates on me to...

01:00:06.922 --> 01:00:12.585
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they did that just because they're tired of putting different dates in there for everything.

01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:18.227
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's kind of what they're doing with the PS3 stuff until they find out more about that.

01:00:18.908 --> 01:00:22.089
[SPEAKER_10]: But all the pre-booked dates are still where they were before.

01:00:22.209 --> 01:00:25.771
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's still looking October from what I've seen so far.

01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:27.912
[SPEAKER_10]: And even if

01:00:30.802 --> 01:00:36.266
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gotta be October, because I know there was another story that was like Sports Illustrated for kids or whatever, saying November 6th.

01:00:36.706 --> 01:00:42.991
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's too close to the PS3 launch to make it successful, and I think that they would want to launch at least a month in advance.

01:00:43.231 --> 01:00:45.833
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we need a friendly reminder, because we have somebody in our chatroom.

01:00:45.873 --> 01:00:49.355
[SPEAKER_09]: Bandit says, where does Loki work that he gets all these dates?

01:00:49.435 --> 01:00:51.236
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it GameStop, EB?

01:00:51.477 --> 01:00:52.918
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't work for GameStop or EB.

01:00:52.958 --> 01:00:54.299
[SPEAKER_10]: I work for a game distributor.

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:56.900
[SPEAKER_10]: We sell to retail stores.

01:00:57.441 --> 01:00:57.721
[SPEAKER_10]: We're a

01:00:58.257 --> 01:00:59.718
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're one step up on the food chain.

01:00:59.778 --> 01:01:00.219
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of.

01:01:00.399 --> 01:01:07.665
[SPEAKER_10]: GameStop and EB, they get their dates from a system that's put in by their buyers at corporate or wherever their office is.

01:01:09.026 --> 01:01:16.171
[SPEAKER_10]: We get our dates straight from the publishers when they give us updates every week or so.

01:01:16.552 --> 01:01:21.516
[SPEAKER_10]: And I look four or five times a day to see if there's a new date or a different change or anything.

01:01:21.576 --> 01:01:22.096
[SPEAKER_10]: And I look

01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:24.211
[SPEAKER_10]: Very hard.

01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:27.273
[SPEAKER_10]: Even then, sometimes the dates change around.

01:01:27.293 --> 01:01:29.355
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes they're wrong and sometimes I gotta fix them.

01:01:29.475 --> 01:01:36.701
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, our purchasing people made a goof and they put Lair saying that it was on PlayStation 2 and I had to correct them.

01:01:37.142 --> 01:01:39.263
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell them, no, you're wrong, it's a PlayStation 3 game.

01:01:39.283 --> 01:01:44.908
[SPEAKER_10]: And they make goofs because they have a guy working for them that does the date entering that's kind of brand new to it.

01:01:45.028 --> 01:01:51.774
[SPEAKER_10]: So he messes up sometimes and puts wrong dates or maybe lists the name wrong sometimes.

01:01:52.134 --> 01:01:56.497
[SPEAKER_10]: But for the most part, you know, we do get our information straight from their sales staff.

01:01:56.757 --> 01:02:03.901
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of times before, you'll hear it at GameStop because, you know, their sales staff are really loose-lipped sometimes.

01:02:04.041 --> 01:02:08.424
[SPEAKER_10]: And they'll leak out, like, I don't know, the entire E3 lineup for Konami, for example.

01:02:09.264 --> 01:02:11.145
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I guess we brought two earlier this year.

01:02:11.726 --> 01:02:13.507
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

01:02:13.687 --> 01:02:17.710
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week we like to go into the mailbag and read some emails that came to us from our listeners.

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.851
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, I realize DarkSakura is not here tonight.

01:02:19.911 --> 01:02:21.232
[SPEAKER_09]: She's usually the one that goes to the mailbag.

01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:24.815
[SPEAKER_09]: However, she gave me permission in her absence to go in there and pull out some letters.

01:02:25.335 --> 01:02:27.096
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go to the mailbag.

01:02:27.817 --> 01:02:31.339
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, you guys can always send us emails.

01:02:31.419 --> 01:02:35.662
[SPEAKER_09]: It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com So let me put on these

01:02:36.317 --> 01:02:38.578
[SPEAKER_09]: Slightly used gloves, hazmat gloves.

01:02:38.738 --> 01:02:39.499
[SPEAKER_09]: Dig into the mailbag.

01:02:39.559 --> 01:02:42.261
[SPEAKER_09]: First email comes to us from an unsigned name.

01:02:42.461 --> 01:02:46.663
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not signed, but the email address has Andrew in it, so I'm assuming the guy's name is Andrew.

01:02:47.604 --> 01:02:53.547
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I am new here and I've only listened to one podcast, but I really enjoyed it and could tell that everyone there really knew their games.

01:02:53.907 --> 01:02:54.168
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

01:02:54.808 --> 01:03:03.173
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason I sent this email was that I got a DS and so far only have Mario Kart, and I really want to know what are, in your opinion, the best games out for the DS?

01:03:03.706 --> 01:03:10.494
[SPEAKER_09]: and some that have a close release date so I can buy one I know that is good and see if I can get them really cheap on the net.

01:03:10.935 --> 01:03:11.916
[SPEAKER_09]: Any help is appreciated.

01:03:13.186 --> 01:03:13.827
[SPEAKER_06]: Phoenix Wright.

01:03:14.167 --> 01:03:15.088
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, Phoenix Wright.

01:03:15.148 --> 01:03:17.629
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can find it, Phoenix Wright is pretty hard to find.

01:03:17.649 --> 01:03:18.690
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing a reprint again.

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:19.891
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go on Capcom site right now.

01:03:19.911 --> 01:03:21.612
[SPEAKER_10]: Capcom is selling them out pretty quick.

01:03:21.812 --> 01:03:24.374
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can get one at Capcom site, great.

01:03:24.394 --> 01:03:26.896
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're printing them as much as they can.

01:03:27.256 --> 01:03:30.059
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they have to print them over in Hong Kong or something like that.

01:03:30.079 --> 01:03:31.780
[SPEAKER_10]: And then ship them over in a batch.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:34.021
[SPEAKER_10]: And then those sell out almost instantly.

01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:38.785
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't get an American one, the recently re-released Japanese one does have an English option.

01:03:39.229 --> 01:03:42.531
[SPEAKER_06]: And since the DS is region free, you can import that and play it.

01:03:42.571 --> 01:03:43.632
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's totally worth it.

01:03:43.772 --> 01:03:47.874
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say what you probably want to do, Tetris DS, of course.

01:03:47.934 --> 01:03:48.755
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, great stuff.

01:03:48.815 --> 01:03:49.755
[SPEAKER_09]: New Super Mario Bros.

01:03:49.856 --> 01:03:51.877
[SPEAKER_09]: is very popular.

01:03:51.917 --> 01:03:53.578
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like the old ones, I think you'll get a kick out of it.

01:03:53.598 --> 01:03:54.378
[SPEAKER_10]: New Super Mario Bros.

01:03:54.418 --> 01:03:54.999
[SPEAKER_10]: is pretty cool.

01:03:55.019 --> 01:04:00.022
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually want to get some of those bit generation games that are coming out on the Game Boy Advance because they look pretty cool.

01:04:00.542 --> 01:04:01.903
[SPEAKER_09]: I would recommend highly Meteos.

01:04:01.923 --> 01:04:04.164
[SPEAKER_10]: If you like puzzlers at all, definitely get your hands on Meteos.

01:04:04.224 --> 01:04:05.025
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still a good value.

01:04:05.745 --> 01:04:08.047
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's actually pretty cheap, you can find it out there.

01:04:08.087 --> 01:04:13.129
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they were doing a clear out of them at, I think, Toys R Us or something?

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:16.351
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it really depends what type of games you like.

01:04:16.812 --> 01:04:19.853
[SPEAKER_09]: But the DS has some solid hits in every genre right now.

01:04:20.334 --> 01:04:21.334
[SPEAKER_06]: Except racing.

01:04:21.634 --> 01:04:23.115
[SPEAKER_06]: What about Mario Kart?

01:04:23.135 --> 01:04:24.656
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't count, because it's fun.

01:04:24.696 --> 01:04:31.420
[SPEAKER_10]: Go check out the new section over at GameStop, or even go check out the bargain bins down at Toys R Us or KB...

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:33.991
[SPEAKER_10]: Our second email of three tonight comes from Seth.

01:04:34.011 --> 01:04:36.331
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Seth and I'm 15 and I listen to the podcast every week.

01:04:50.575 --> 01:05:19.681
[SPEAKER_09]: the past couple episodes you've been discussing the new laws that are being made in states such as Louisiana I think these laws are ridiculous I'm young and I play violent games I don't ever get the urge to go outside and shoot people if I played a Harry Potter game which I don't I wouldn't go outside with my mom's broom and jump off the roof because I think I can fly I believe that the government is just trying to find an excuse for why kids are going out and shooting up their schools thanks for having such a great show I listen to OLR every week well thanks for the kind words hey you know what

01:05:21.035 --> 01:05:21.958
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty smart kid there.

01:05:23.443 --> 01:05:27.136
[SPEAKER_09]: With the Harry Potter reference, that's a pretty interesting comparison there.

01:05:27.858 --> 01:05:31.580
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, and I mean, look at, what was it, that movie, The Boy Who Could Fly?

01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:34.863
[SPEAKER_10]: Did he have, like, a high, you know, rate of suicides after that movie?

01:05:34.883 --> 01:05:36.884
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, I mean, he jumped off his roof and started flying.

01:05:37.264 --> 01:05:39.366
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, did we see kids, you know, just trying to kill themselves?

01:05:39.386 --> 01:05:41.647
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now, kids do imitate, try to imitate the movie sometimes, though.

01:05:41.667 --> 01:05:51.574
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, remember, I'm trying to think, what was that one where, like, it had a scene where people were lying down in the middle of the road, and some kids tried to imitate that, and of course got run over, and then they, like, re-released the movie with that scene edited?

01:05:51.594 --> 01:05:51.674
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:05:52.558 --> 01:05:53.759
[SPEAKER_09]: It was years ago, God.

01:05:54.039 --> 01:05:55.801
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what you're talking about.

01:05:56.261 --> 01:05:56.922
[SPEAKER_10]: It's stupid.

01:05:58.143 --> 01:05:59.244
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just media in general.

01:05:59.264 --> 01:06:02.406
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to blame media because, obviously, it's not the parents' fault.

01:06:02.686 --> 01:06:04.828
[SPEAKER_10]: Never the parents' fault.

01:06:05.989 --> 01:06:08.991
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're starting to get it, but they're just not quite.

01:06:10.092 --> 01:06:17.118
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially, this is only going to be brought up again once Scarface comes out, once Reservoir Dogs comes out.

01:06:17.458 --> 01:06:21.642
[SPEAKER_10]: This fourth quarter is really bad when it comes to this whole violent game thing.

01:06:23.632 --> 01:06:30.276
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go to our last email tonight, which comes to us from GrinWithoutACat.

01:06:31.157 --> 01:06:33.779
[SPEAKER_09]: This must be like a ShazireCat type thing.

01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:34.519
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a pretty cool name.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:35.700
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, guys.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.721
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been listening to the podcast for a couple months now.

01:06:37.781 --> 01:06:45.106
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in the UK, so it's a little bit late for me to stay up to listen live, as some brave soul did the other week, but I look forward to each download.

01:06:45.647 --> 01:06:50.830
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to respond to what the PMS and FragDoll clans had to say about the beauty pageant at the gaming event,

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:51.631
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:11.302
[SPEAKER_09]: The word hypocrites comes to mind.

01:07:12.203 --> 01:07:17.188
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, GrimWithoutACat goes on to say, I think an OLR gaming group is a great idea.

01:07:17.548 --> 01:07:24.775
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm planning to get a 360 in September as I'm really interested in live and making my gaming experiences more sociable, but I keep hearing enjoyment of live...

01:07:27.932 --> 01:07:28.373
[SPEAKER_09]: Relays?

01:07:28.473 --> 01:07:29.614
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a misspelled word there.

01:07:29.654 --> 01:07:31.736
[SPEAKER_09]: Live games on a good friend's list.

01:07:32.176 --> 01:07:34.378
[SPEAKER_09]: And all my gaming friends are PC-only gamers.

01:07:34.498 --> 01:07:35.239
[SPEAKER_09]: Relays, I think.

01:07:35.259 --> 01:07:36.340
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it was supposed to be.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.641
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was just reading it wrong.

01:07:37.681 --> 01:07:41.043
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, but I keep hearing enjoyment of live relies on a good friend's list.

01:07:41.083 --> 01:07:41.364
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

01:07:41.704 --> 01:07:43.826
[SPEAKER_09]: And all my gaming friends are PC-only gamers.

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:47.769
[SPEAKER_09]: So to have a group of friendly faces to ease me into online gaming would be welcome.

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:52.313
[SPEAKER_09]: On the second point there, I can say, I love this.

01:07:52.373 --> 01:07:54.715
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go to the forums, there's like a thread that

01:07:54.994 --> 01:07:55.274
[SPEAKER_09]: Counter-Strike

01:08:13.394 --> 01:08:15.555
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, in some mod or something.

01:08:15.976 --> 01:08:20.859
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really funny because if you look at the picture, the screenshot somebody took, the gun is pointed right at your face, Loki.

01:08:20.879 --> 01:08:21.199
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:23.860
[SPEAKER_09]: But then, no, I thought this was cool too.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:29.384
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there's a Guild Wars clan as well, and somebody just posted a picture of their cape, and it's like an orange cape.

01:08:29.804 --> 01:08:36.008
[SPEAKER_09]: And they couldn't really put their own logo on it, but they put something that looked like Sakura blossoms on it for Dark Sakura.

01:08:36.128 --> 01:08:36.348
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

01:08:37.038 --> 01:08:37.918
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that's cute.

01:08:38.099 --> 01:08:38.559
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

01:08:38.659 --> 01:08:39.859
[SPEAKER_09]: Our listeners are so awesome.

01:08:39.979 --> 01:08:43.320
[SPEAKER_09]: So check out that thread on our forums and you can find some gamers.

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:45.321
[SPEAKER_09]: There's even an Xbox Live Gamer Tag Exchange.

01:08:45.641 --> 01:08:47.202
[SPEAKER_09]: And I even give out my gamer tag.

01:08:47.222 --> 01:08:47.582
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:49.763
[SPEAKER_10]: My gamer tag is on there and I have a bunch of friends.

01:08:50.503 --> 01:08:53.064
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly enough, I am paying for live, but I don't really play over live.

01:08:53.584 --> 01:08:53.924
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't get it.

01:08:54.285 --> 01:08:55.045
[SPEAKER_10]: I do once in a while.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:58.608
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I really need to get down to... I'll play Halo 3 when it's out for sure.

01:08:58.628 --> 01:09:01.350
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just I don't really have that many good games that I want to play.

01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:04.052
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, Burnout, even over live, I don't really care for it that much.

01:09:04.072 --> 01:09:04.953
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought Burnout was fun.

01:09:04.993 --> 01:09:07.155
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just not good at it, so it doesn't give me incentive to play.

01:09:07.335 --> 01:09:08.676
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to play Chromehounds over live.

01:09:08.716 --> 01:09:09.557
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that'd be fun.

01:09:09.577 --> 01:09:17.883
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Chromehounds is actually going to allow you to do clans, so I think that's something that they really need because, I don't know, you don't really have that over live.

01:09:17.903 --> 01:09:19.064
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:09:19.739 --> 01:09:21.041
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much for the emails.

01:09:21.061 --> 01:09:21.802
[SPEAKER_09]: We really appreciate it.

01:09:21.822 --> 01:09:24.086
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys want to send us an email as well, you can always do that.

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:27.151
[SPEAKER_09]: It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:09:28.253 --> 01:09:32.419
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, we started a new segment last week called the Voicemails of the Week.

01:09:32.499 --> 01:09:34.843
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanted to try something a little different using our Skype line.

01:09:35.131 --> 01:09:40.395
[SPEAKER_09]: And we invited you guys to send us some voicemails in regards to a particular topic.

01:09:40.976 --> 01:09:47.060
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of you guys called in about the topic, but one of the voicemails we're going to play tonight has nothing to do with the topic at hand, but it's still kind of funny, so we'll play it.

01:09:47.601 --> 01:09:52.765
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was very overwhelmed with the response when I went in there to go look.

01:09:53.125 --> 01:09:55.246
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you guys off air how much we got.

01:09:55.286 --> 01:09:55.787
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool.

01:09:56.007 --> 01:09:56.547
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:10:25.077 --> 01:10:32.519
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello Orange Lounge Radio, this is the all-infamous Fury Lover answering your question of the voicemail of the week.

01:10:33.099 --> 01:10:42.781
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually pre-order certain games that I would like to buy that I know would get, uh, that would be sold out.

01:10:43.581 --> 01:10:52.983
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the advantages of actually pre-ordering games are, um, are actually quite good because, uh, if you pre-order a game from

01:10:53.666 --> 01:11:01.968
[SPEAKER_02]: Trusted sources like GameStop or EB Games, you know you'll have the game when it comes out or whenever you want to get it.

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:09.811
[SPEAKER_02]: But pre-ordering games from things like FYE and stuff like that is just...

01:11:11.207 --> 01:11:11.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Horrible.

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:14.070
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's all I have to say.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

01:11:14.931 --> 01:11:15.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

01:11:15.391 --> 01:11:16.532
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the voicemail, Yuri Lover.

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:20.516
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's interesting because it sounds like he trusts some stores but he doesn't trust others.

01:11:20.696 --> 01:11:26.342
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's true because some stores I think actually do buy direct from the publishers and some don't.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:31.547
[SPEAKER_10]: So they might get them late or might not get them at all or they're relying on some other source to get them.

01:11:31.707 --> 01:11:33.248
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:11:57.626 --> 01:11:58.747
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not as interested in that game.

01:11:58.787 --> 01:12:01.509
[SPEAKER_09]: I might pick it up, but I'm much more interested in XII.

01:12:01.549 --> 01:12:03.091
[SPEAKER_09]: Dirt Disturbance isn't really Final Fantasy.

01:12:03.131 --> 01:12:05.072
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, sure, it's Vincent, but it's not really Final Fantasy.

01:12:05.212 --> 01:12:11.838
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, having a modded PS2 really opens the options for me as far as where I can get that game.

01:12:12.618 --> 01:12:14.720
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to our next voicemail.

01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:16.622
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, OLR.

01:12:16.642 --> 01:12:18.523
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Razorburn2021.

01:12:18.884 --> 01:12:21.506
[SPEAKER_04]: Your question, I believe, was about pre-ordering games and...

01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:26.532
[SPEAKER_04]: If I don't have to, I try not to pre-order games.

01:12:27.252 --> 01:12:39.137
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe there was an argument that I'd read a year or two, something like that ago, in the arcade about the problems with pre-ordering games is that that's kind of how game stores gauge what they should stock.

01:12:39.377 --> 01:12:46.160
[SPEAKER_04]: And you talked about games like Point Blank DS that are difficult to find, and that's because generally no one pre-orders them.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.142
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I don't have to, I try not to.

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:50.182
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't recommend it.

01:12:51.315 --> 01:12:57.879
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't generally have to pre-order movies, I don't generally have to pre-order CDs or several other things that I like to buy.

01:12:58.019 --> 01:13:01.581
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just like if I could go into a game store and purchase what I want to.

01:13:02.341 --> 01:13:03.321
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate your show.

01:13:03.622 --> 01:13:04.282
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good day.

01:13:04.844 --> 01:13:05.544
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the voicemail.

01:13:05.564 --> 01:13:11.727
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was an interesting one because he gives a good argument for why you should pre-order games, but then says he doesn't do it.

01:13:11.767 --> 01:13:17.649
[SPEAKER_09]: But I like that he gave the kind of comparison there about the I don't pre-order movies or CDs.

01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:22.391
[SPEAKER_09]: I seem to recall though, I seem to remember a day where you could pre-order CDs.

01:13:22.771 --> 01:13:24.472
[SPEAKER_06]: Who buys CDs anymore anyway?

01:13:24.492 --> 01:13:26.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you need to pre-order them?

01:13:26.794 --> 01:13:29.356
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually do buy CDs.

01:13:29.476 --> 01:13:30.137
[SPEAKER_06]: I use iTunes.

01:13:30.177 --> 01:13:32.299
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad the internet's there.

01:13:32.479 --> 01:13:41.666
[SPEAKER_10]: I do every now and then like going into a CD store like Tower and going through their dance section or their import section and just listening to what they've got.

01:13:41.906 --> 01:13:43.848
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of times it's hard to find stuff.

01:13:44.088 --> 01:13:46.150
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of why I turn to the internet because...

01:13:46.837 --> 01:13:58.434
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't find something because it was only on a single vinyl, and I'm not going to buy a $10 record, even though I do have two turntables I don't ever use.

01:13:58.735 --> 01:13:59.275
[SPEAKER_10]: A microphone?

01:14:00.417 --> 01:14:00.637
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

01:14:00.798 --> 01:14:01.098
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget it.

01:14:02.825 --> 01:14:05.226
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is Makran, and

01:14:28.129 --> 01:14:34.334
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just listening to the podcast that I got during iTunes and the poos.

01:14:34.574 --> 01:14:44.762
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not sure if you all got your thoughts together in a complete box together in this area enough.

01:14:45.082 --> 01:14:53.148
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you elaborate on your feelings about the gayest name of a video game accessory and or console ever created?

01:14:54.109 --> 01:14:54.549
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:55.050
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

01:14:56.328 --> 01:14:58.189
[SPEAKER_09]: Gayest name of a video game accessory.

01:14:58.289 --> 01:15:00.289
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a random question.

01:15:00.549 --> 01:15:03.470
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, did you hear about the Tekken butt plug, actually?

01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:03.911
[SPEAKER_09]: That's easy.

01:15:03.931 --> 01:15:06.791
[SPEAKER_09]: The Rez Transfibrator.

01:15:06.831 --> 01:15:08.672
[SPEAKER_09]: The Rez Transfibrator, of course.

01:15:08.832 --> 01:15:09.993
[SPEAKER_10]: The Transfibrator is...

01:15:12.717 --> 01:15:15.579
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's someone that was on E when they figured out that one.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.981
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, it vibrates with the music.

01:15:18.021 --> 01:15:20.043
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:23.085
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels totally good when I'm on E and I'm touching it.

01:15:23.225 --> 01:15:28.369
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a week later and I still don't believe that Pooh's thing that they're going to call the Sony controller the Pooh's.

01:15:28.449 --> 01:15:29.270
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a load of crap.

01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:30.951
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a load of Pooh is what it is.

01:15:31.131 --> 01:15:31.631
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't buy it.

01:15:33.942 --> 01:15:38.226
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, and I weep for Sony, because that's, I mean, God.

01:15:38.946 --> 01:15:45.312
[SPEAKER_09]: We have been kicking, I mean, the gaming community has been kicking those guys non-stop since E3, and this is just another, like, oh my God.

01:15:46.613 --> 01:15:50.536
[SPEAKER_10]: If they called it the poos, that would be the candy sprinkles on the icing of the cake.

01:15:50.576 --> 01:15:51.717
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's all it would really be.

01:15:51.777 --> 01:15:55.841
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need it, but it's there, and you gotta appreciate it.

01:15:55.941 --> 01:16:00.385
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't think it's gonna matter what they call the controller, because...

01:16:01.172 --> 01:16:01.612
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching.

01:16:01.632 --> 01:16:02.113
[SPEAKER_10]: See you next time.

01:16:21.698 --> 01:16:26.921
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you could use your finger, I mean, hypothetically, you could use, you know what, forget wherever that thought's going.

01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:29.102
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's it for the voicemails of the week.

01:16:29.843 --> 01:16:39.328
[SPEAKER_09]: Overall, though, it seems like you guys, the kind of general consensus I was getting from the voicemails is that you guys prefer pre-ordering for certain games, but not everything.

01:16:39.988 --> 01:16:42.610
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for your voicemails, and sorry to those folks we didn't get around to.

01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:44.831
[SPEAKER_09]: If you would like to leave us this voicemail, please do.

01:16:44.871 --> 01:16:46.931
[SPEAKER_09]: The number is 916-226-9067.

01:16:48.472 --> 01:16:50.472
[SPEAKER_09]: But remember, that may be a toll call.

01:16:50.512 --> 01:16:54.433
[SPEAKER_09]: So please, if you don't pay the bills, ask whoever does their permission first.

01:16:55.073 --> 01:16:58.574
[SPEAKER_09]: Or use a cell phone because a lot of times they get free long distance.

01:16:58.815 --> 01:17:00.495
[SPEAKER_09]: But make sure it does before you call.

01:17:01.695 --> 01:17:03.356
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, if you're not paying the bill, you better ask.

01:17:04.276 --> 01:17:05.056
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can use Skype.

01:17:05.096 --> 01:17:08.117
[SPEAKER_09]: You can call us on Orange Launch Radio at Skype anytime when we're not live.

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:09.418
[SPEAKER_09]: And you also get the voicemail that way.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.958
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we did get a couple voicemails that way.

01:17:11.538 --> 01:17:16.120
[SPEAKER_09]: The question we have for you guys, you know we want your opinions on this, the whole Sony billboard controversy.

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:17.340
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think of that?

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:20.501
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is it being overblown?

01:17:20.782 --> 01:17:22.322
[SPEAKER_09]: Do people have a right to be upset?

01:17:22.422 --> 01:17:24.303
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it in good taste, bad taste?

01:17:24.603 --> 01:17:25.983
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think of that whole controversy?

01:17:26.003 --> 01:17:27.644
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to hear from you guys on that one.

01:17:27.964 --> 01:17:30.505
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll play some of our favorite voicemails next week.

01:17:31.205 --> 01:17:32.126
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, back to the news.

01:17:32.726 --> 01:17:35.847
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and speaking about strange stuff.

01:17:37.165 --> 01:17:44.650
[SPEAKER_10]: DOA's, I can't even pronounce his name, but Itagaki, that's right.

01:17:45.691 --> 01:17:47.212
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why I'm not Japanese.

01:17:47.332 --> 01:17:52.976
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, he admits to being quite intoxicated while creating DOA4.

01:17:54.057 --> 01:17:58.620
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's all pretty much, I'm drinking pretty much full time.

01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:05.265
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, there are ups and downs, waves of how I drink in terms of the amount, but it's long periods of time.

01:18:06.798 --> 01:18:13.699
[SPEAKER_10]: In the last 10 years, not that you asked this question, I think I had better ideas when I was drinking whiskey.

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:21.381
[SPEAKER_10]: When I'm drinking shochu, that's a conservative drink, so the ideas are not that great.

01:18:21.741 --> 01:18:27.622
[SPEAKER_10]: Beer is just like water to me, so it helps me and everything else loosen up a bit.

01:18:28.162 --> 01:18:31.203
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't really contribute to coming up with ideas.

01:18:32.478 --> 01:18:35.159
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is explained on why there was a Dead or Alive volleyball game now.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:36.300
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is explained.

01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:39.261
[SPEAKER_09]: Because most people, when they heard that, were like, what?

01:18:40.202 --> 01:18:40.702
[SPEAKER_09]: That explains it.

01:18:40.742 --> 01:18:41.743
[SPEAKER_09]: It also explains why.

01:18:41.963 --> 01:18:43.824
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, that guy is such a rock star.

01:18:44.064 --> 01:18:47.886
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, when you look at pictures of him and see him in interviews, he's just a freaking rock star.

01:18:47.926 --> 01:18:50.627
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, he's like the Tommy Lee of game designs, right?

01:18:50.687 --> 01:18:54.229
[SPEAKER_09]: You know he's the type of person that probably thrashes hotel rooms.

01:18:54.571 --> 01:18:59.875
[SPEAKER_09]: Setser with a fat cigar in his mouth while he's probably, you know, designing games and stuff.

01:18:59.895 --> 01:19:01.216
[SPEAKER_09]: It's no surprise to me that he's in it.

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:11.404
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I kind of wish that Weeble was kind of like handling DOA, the movie, because if it got, you know, all fucked up, this guy could come beat the crap out of him, Japanese style.

01:19:11.424 --> 01:19:12.765
[SPEAKER_10]: Break a bottle over his head.

01:19:13.365 --> 01:19:14.546
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

01:19:15.026 --> 01:19:18.949
[SPEAKER_10]: He should put himself in the next DOA game, because that would be awesome.

01:19:19.069 --> 01:19:21.351
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to play him in DOA.

01:19:21.711 --> 01:19:23.833
[SPEAKER_10]: That might sell another copy of the game for me.

01:19:25.362 --> 01:19:26.483
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played DOA 4, it was fun.

01:19:47.688 --> 01:19:48.769
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll probably enjoy this.

01:19:49.549 --> 01:19:51.950
[SPEAKER_09]: The Bob Ross game that's coming out.

01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:55.432
[SPEAKER_09]: Bob Ross Interactive is actually having a contest right now.

01:19:55.472 --> 01:20:03.936
[SPEAKER_09]: It started on July 4th, and they are accepting work, but only those that are created using Bob Ross' patented wet-on-wet technique.

01:20:04.596 --> 01:20:05.536
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you giggling?

01:20:05.917 --> 01:20:07.357
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was funny sounding.

01:20:07.797 --> 01:20:10.959
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the wet-on-wet technique for those who haven't watched the show.

01:20:10.999 --> 01:20:14.320
[SPEAKER_10]: You put a base coat of their paint on it, and then you...

01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:16.490
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Trees

01:20:39.463 --> 01:20:42.584
[SPEAKER_09]: and I believe you can actually visit www.bobross.com for more of the details.

01:20:42.624 --> 01:20:43.304
[SPEAKER_09]: Bob Ross, beyond grave.

01:21:07.648 --> 01:21:09.350
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.

01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:14.034
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, speaking of stuff that's, I don't know, dead.

01:21:15.415 --> 01:21:20.880
[SPEAKER_10]: The PSP security on the firmware, that's pretty much dead.

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.402
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, now you can downgrade.

01:21:23.762 --> 01:21:26.124
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if you happen to own a 2.6 or 2.7

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:30.377
[SPEAKER_10]: 2.5 or 2.6 firmware.

01:21:30.838 --> 01:21:31.398
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, folks.

01:21:31.418 --> 01:21:32.279
[SPEAKER_10]: You can downgrade.

01:21:32.859 --> 01:21:34.140
[SPEAKER_09]: Gradius upgraded me to 2.6.

01:21:35.141 --> 01:21:35.961
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:21:36.082 --> 01:21:40.325
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Grand Theft Auto was probably one of the ones that got you to 2.5.

01:21:40.565 --> 01:21:41.485
[SPEAKER_10]: 2.6 for me was Katamari.

01:21:41.806 --> 01:21:48.490
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have decrypted 2.5 and 2.6, and now there is a downgrader.

01:21:48.991 --> 01:21:54.435
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, if you visit PSP Updates, they have tons of different downgraders that you can get to do that, including...

01:21:55.492 --> 01:21:56.293
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:22:16.894 --> 01:22:19.336
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't they just get the homebrew to work on 2.6?

01:22:21.098 --> 01:22:21.518
[SPEAKER_10]: They have.

01:22:21.598 --> 01:22:22.159
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, good.

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:23.140
[SPEAKER_10]: They have that.

01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:27.824
[SPEAKER_10]: They also have this thing where you can actually run... I haven't been following PSP hacking for a while.

01:22:27.844 --> 01:22:31.287
[SPEAKER_10]: You can run 1.5, and it will give you the features of 2.5.

01:22:31.407 --> 01:22:36.691
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have the RSS features, the web browser, and you can play 2.5 games on there.

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:38.793
[SPEAKER_10]: Wi-Fi doesn't quite work well, though, with that.

01:22:39.214 --> 01:22:41.115
[SPEAKER_10]: But still kind of neat that they're doing it.

01:22:41.496 --> 01:22:42.777
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know...

01:22:43.925 --> 01:22:44.465
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

01:22:45.246 --> 01:22:47.287
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really follow the Homebrew stuff as much anymore.

01:22:47.307 --> 01:22:49.329
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have a Nintendo emulator for 2.6 firmware?

01:22:50.469 --> 01:22:52.170
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically anything works with 2.6.

01:22:52.291 --> 01:22:53.271
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

01:22:53.431 --> 01:22:57.974
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, the thing with 2.6 is you have to have Grand Theft Auto in order to do all these workarounds.

01:22:58.054 --> 01:23:05.359
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, you may want to downgrade or something or just don't play emulators on there because whatever.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.260
[SPEAKER_10]: Get a DS for that.

01:23:07.801 --> 01:23:09.122
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of stuff for that.

01:23:09.562 --> 01:23:12.364
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's not... I can't play Kid Icarus on my DS yet.

01:23:13.536 --> 01:23:13.836
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't!

01:23:13.856 --> 01:23:14.177
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't!

01:23:34.285 --> 01:23:35.206
[SPEAKER_10]: You can use this game.

01:23:35.406 --> 01:23:37.007
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically Step Mania for the PSP.

01:23:37.367 --> 01:23:42.651
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you do end up downgrading to 1.5, check out PSP Revolution version 0.2.

01:23:43.011 --> 01:23:46.333
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be really fun to play on a handheld.

01:23:46.894 --> 01:23:49.335
[SPEAKER_10]: And they've added... DDR on the Game Boy is stupid.

01:23:49.375 --> 01:23:49.635
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

01:23:49.696 --> 01:23:50.556
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no way around it.

01:23:50.576 --> 01:23:56.980
[SPEAKER_10]: They've added theme support and arrow speed modifiers as well as AUG music files are now supported.

01:23:57.981 --> 01:23:58.121
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

01:23:59.582 --> 01:24:02.028
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, marathon songs and all that sort of stuff.

01:24:02.108 --> 01:24:08.043
[SPEAKER_10]: So check it out if you're really interested in Step Mania on your PSP.

01:24:10.146 --> 01:24:12.247
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, completely changing gears here.

01:24:12.287 --> 01:24:16.849
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't talked a whole lot about Microsoft tonight because, you know, Xbox 360, it's out.

01:24:17.049 --> 01:24:22.032
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a lot, you know, and it's got their games coming out, so we don't have quite the rumors that we have with Sony and Nintendo.

01:24:22.072 --> 01:24:24.973
[SPEAKER_09]: However, Microsoft does have some rumors of their own.

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:34.558
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been reported by Bloomberg that Microsoft may be working on an iPod killer that's supposed to hit shelves this Christmas.

01:24:35.498 --> 01:24:35.758
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote,

01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:16.594
[SPEAKER_09]: You can assume that, especially with, I would say, that whole Xbox Live Anywhere thing that's going to be on the cell phones and all that, this might play into that or something else.

01:25:16.774 --> 01:25:19.956
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say maybe Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

01:25:19.996 --> 01:25:20.536
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly.

01:25:20.936 --> 01:25:22.297
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly, so don't count it out.

01:25:22.357 --> 01:25:24.058
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if this whole thing is true to me.

01:25:24.078 --> 01:25:27.761
[SPEAKER_10]: They do have Xbox Live Arcade for the PC as well, I mean, so.

01:25:28.321 --> 01:25:33.865
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you ever visit zone.msn.com, I think it is, The Zone, they have gaming badges.

01:25:34.086 --> 01:25:37.128
[SPEAKER_09]: It's set up very similar to how Xbox Live works.

01:25:37.188 --> 01:25:38.569
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very interesting, so.

01:25:38.953 --> 01:25:39.093
[SPEAKER_09]: MSN

01:26:06.417 --> 01:26:14.341
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I almost see them doing something like the Nomad for the original Xbox in something like this.

01:26:14.381 --> 01:26:21.705
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of where I'm seeing this going, is maybe like a portable Xbox, like an original one where it plays the old Xbox games.

01:26:21.745 --> 01:26:25.127
[SPEAKER_10]: So they don't really have to make new games, but I don't know.

01:26:25.227 --> 01:26:29.269
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it might be a little late to do something like that, but I thought.

01:26:29.529 --> 01:26:35.412
[SPEAKER_09]: GK128 in our chatroom says, It figures Microsoft is coming out with a Super MP3 player just as I bought a fancy new one.

01:26:37.111 --> 01:26:40.236
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry, Apple put out the video iPods like a week after I bought mine.

01:26:41.204 --> 01:26:41.865
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, jerks.

01:26:42.285 --> 01:26:49.590
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, something that's definitely going to be implemented with probably this is going to be some sort of e-distribution, especially of music and movies.

01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:57.675
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, Sony is talking about doing games because their first priority, of course, is games with the PS3, right?

01:26:57.815 --> 01:27:07.602
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so they're definitely talking about doing something to the sense of Xbox Live's marketplace where you can be able to download arcade-type games.

01:27:08.022 --> 01:27:14.287
[SPEAKER_10]: Games, and according to an article that was on Gamasutra, definitely something that they're going to be doing.

01:27:14.607 --> 01:27:20.432
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly being able to sell growably online makes it easier to reach international and remote markets.

01:27:20.952 --> 01:27:24.795
[SPEAKER_10]: On the business side, it also lowers the cost of sales and eliminates inventory risk.

01:27:24.915 --> 01:27:27.777
[SPEAKER_10]: It should help curtail used game sales and piracy.

01:27:28.598 --> 01:27:33.381
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like the whole used game sales thing, but I can understand the piracy, I guess.

01:27:34.062 --> 01:27:35.523
[SPEAKER_10]: Something tells me that's not going to work.

01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:36.254
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura,

01:27:59.605 --> 01:28:00.385
[SPEAKER_10]: You shouldn't be doing that.

01:28:00.465 --> 01:28:21.931
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, so yeah, definitely they're going to be doing something probably similar to, actually, I'm thinking putting on PlayStation 1 games to be able to download straight to the hard drive, being that the size of the files should be a lot smaller, and they're also going to be doing something similar with the PSP, so if they can do it on the PSP, they can definitely do it on the PS3, so that's kind of a given.

01:28:22.351 --> 01:28:28.773
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, maybe even later on down the lines, being able to stream all, you know, real PS3 games, so...

01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:31.651
[SPEAKER_10]: Something that they're interested in.

01:28:31.691 --> 01:28:33.392
[SPEAKER_10]: What's kind of interesting, though, is their comment here.

01:28:33.432 --> 01:28:33.652
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

01:28:33.672 --> 01:28:34.192
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

01:28:54.318 --> 01:28:55.439
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll see how that goes.

01:28:56.799 --> 01:28:58.280
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do have something real quick.

01:28:58.340 --> 01:28:58.601
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sure.

01:28:59.221 --> 01:29:05.545
[SPEAKER_10]: The PlayStation Beyond site that launched during Game Developers Conference this year, and you always see this Play Beyond thing.

01:29:05.585 --> 01:29:07.986
[SPEAKER_10]: How much do you want to bet that they're calling their marketplace Beyond?

01:29:09.007 --> 01:29:09.607
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a thought.

01:29:10.788 --> 01:29:11.608
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an interesting thought.

01:29:12.849 --> 01:29:13.689
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's a big game.

01:29:13.769 --> 01:29:15.050
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes sense.

01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:16.211
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it'll all tie together in the end.

01:29:17.391 --> 01:29:22.255
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, changing gears here, Empire Interactive, been some rumblings out of there this week.

01:29:22.655 --> 01:29:26.898
[SPEAKER_09]: The Flat Out franchise is going to be coming to the Xbox 360.

01:29:26.958 --> 01:29:29.059
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Flat Out Total Carnage.

01:29:29.359 --> 01:29:33.302
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those of you guys not familiar with this series, it originally came out July last year.

01:29:33.903 --> 01:29:39.667
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got destructible cars, kind of like a racing game, and of course scenery, and it's got sadistic minigames inside it.

01:29:39.947 --> 01:29:46.051
[SPEAKER_09]: You go into barriers at high speed, you eject the driver to hit targets like a giant dartboard or bowling pins.

01:29:47.392 --> 01:29:49.373
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard you talk about this game.

01:29:49.714 --> 01:29:51.575
[SPEAKER_10]: I played it last year when it first came out.

01:29:51.955 --> 01:29:54.837
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pretty fun game.

01:29:55.317 --> 01:29:59.220
[SPEAKER_10]: This year they rebuilt the whole game from the ground up, so it's a lot better, a lot faster.

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:02.101
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like a cross between Burnout and Destruction Derby.

01:30:02.721 --> 01:30:06.902
[SPEAKER_10]: And you also have a whole ton of mini-games called the Ragdoll Olympics type stuff.

01:30:07.303 --> 01:30:10.023
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can basically eject your driver out.

01:30:10.284 --> 01:30:12.164
[SPEAKER_10]: One, for example, is baseball.

01:30:12.484 --> 01:30:20.387
[SPEAKER_10]: And you eject your driver out, and he flies up towards this giant baseball bat and is smacked with the baseball bat, and you fling his body into a mitt.

01:30:21.525 --> 01:30:22.366
[SPEAKER_10]: I can tell you this much.

01:30:22.386 --> 01:30:23.747
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds so stupid but fun.

01:30:23.767 --> 01:30:27.751
[SPEAKER_10]: You can play these mini games and they will keep you entertained for hours.

01:30:28.291 --> 01:30:29.272
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially you.

01:30:29.292 --> 01:30:32.234
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably sat there and giggled for like an hour.

01:30:32.294 --> 01:30:32.935
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes I did.

01:30:33.476 --> 01:30:39.201
[SPEAKER_10]: I played the high jump, like, I don't know, for at least a half an hour just like looking at the thing.

01:30:39.421 --> 01:30:40.001
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was fun.

01:30:40.061 --> 01:30:41.142
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pretty fun game.

01:30:41.182 --> 01:30:42.383
[SPEAKER_10]: This one looks a lot better.

01:30:42.463 --> 01:30:43.564
[SPEAKER_10]: Flat Out 2 is coming out.

01:30:43.744 --> 01:30:44.165
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

01:30:44.385 --> 01:30:46.407
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox, PC, and PlayStation 2.

01:30:47.304 --> 01:30:49.532
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think I'm the... August 1st.

01:30:49.693 --> 01:30:50.074
[SPEAKER_09]: This fall.

01:30:50.115 --> 01:30:50.877
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're saying this fall.

01:30:50.917 --> 01:30:51.520
[SPEAKER_09]: August 1st.

01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:52.242
[SPEAKER_09]: They're wrong.

01:30:52.684 --> 01:30:53.166
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we'll see.

01:30:55.023 --> 01:31:02.328
[SPEAKER_09]: Empire Interactive is coming out with a PSP version of Taito Legends and is also working on a version of Ford Street Racing for the PSP as well.

01:31:02.548 --> 01:31:04.109
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, goody, Ford Street Racing.

01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:06.010
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just such an awesome game.

01:31:06.651 --> 01:31:07.271
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played it.

01:31:07.391 --> 01:31:08.172
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't really have an opinion on it.

01:31:08.212 --> 01:31:13.635
[SPEAKER_10]: Lame-o is what you might call that game, but yeah.

01:31:14.556 --> 01:31:18.458
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, something that's not quite as lame as Ford Street Racing there.

01:31:20.039 --> 01:31:23.242
[SPEAKER_10]: Zelda is actually... There's a homebrew Zelda.

01:31:24.195 --> 01:31:26.542
[SPEAKER_10]: for mobile phones, and they're calling it Zelda.

01:31:27.947 --> 01:31:31.749
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of funny because when you think of Zelda, you think of Wind Waker.

01:31:31.969 --> 01:31:33.830
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Phantom Hourglass, even.

01:31:33.850 --> 01:31:41.534
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's funny you should mention that because they actually are using the Minish Cap graphics, so it kind of looks a little bit like Wind Waker.

01:31:42.655 --> 01:31:45.156
[SPEAKER_10]: And sort of, you know, Wind Waker and Zelda.

01:31:45.216 --> 01:31:48.958
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought Minish Cap looked more like the old school Super Nintendo one.

01:31:48.978 --> 01:31:51.059
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it kind of... But here's a few things.

01:31:51.079 --> 01:31:52.180
[SPEAKER_10]: Too bad it wasn't as fun.

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:55.362
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, there's actually, you know...

01:31:56.102 --> 01:31:57.743
[SPEAKER_10]: Some pretty impressive graphics on there.

01:31:58.883 --> 01:32:02.944
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the latest demo, which is working on M.I.D.P.2 compatible phones.

01:32:04.205 --> 01:32:07.186
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually a way you can check it out to see if you have it or not.

01:32:08.166 --> 01:32:10.507
[SPEAKER_10]: A compatible phone, a lot of them out there.

01:32:10.547 --> 01:32:13.108
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know how the hell to put this on my phone, to be honest.

01:32:14.328 --> 01:32:17.830
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're interested, though, they also have a PC version.

01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:19.590
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be interesting.

01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:24.332
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to check and see what kind of phone you have, if it'll work, there's a website.

01:32:24.592 --> 01:32:24.712
[SPEAKER_10]: It's

01:32:25.592 --> 01:32:32.353
[SPEAKER_10]: rumkin.com slash tools slash sprint slash index.php rumplestillskin.com

01:32:37.536 --> 01:32:38.616
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll check that out.

01:32:38.636 --> 01:32:40.377
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a cell phone game I might be able to get into.

01:32:40.737 --> 01:32:41.478
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, actually, I'm sorry.

01:32:41.518 --> 01:32:51.783
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the website, jbenchmark.com slash phonedetails.jsp and that'll let you know what kind of phone you have and if it supports that.

01:32:52.323 --> 01:32:53.103
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of neat.

01:32:53.584 --> 01:32:56.365
[SPEAKER_10]: And the PC version I'm kind of willing to check out and I'm

01:32:57.168 --> 01:32:59.249
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe his website has gone down since

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:19.221
[SPEAKER_10]: Check it out.

01:33:19.421 --> 01:33:20.503
[SPEAKER_10]: They have some screenshots.

01:33:20.563 --> 01:33:21.885
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks pretty sweet.

01:33:22.025 --> 01:33:24.989
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can download the PC and the mobile version for that.

01:33:25.069 --> 01:33:25.570
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:27.573
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a matter of time before Nintendo shuts them down, right?

01:33:28.114 --> 01:33:29.696
[SPEAKER_09]: Why doesn't Nintendo get into cell phone gaming?

01:33:29.716 --> 01:33:29.936
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I...

01:33:31.431 --> 01:33:32.352
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:33:58.130 --> 01:34:00.512
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was somewhat pleased.

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:09.018
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still not as good as a Game Boy Advance version of it, but, you know, I'm... Now, this homebrew version is actually a remake of number one.

01:34:09.578 --> 01:34:11.279
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, yeah, I'd heard that, that it was a remake of number one.

01:34:11.299 --> 01:34:11.760
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:14.201
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, one other quick story on mobile gaming.

01:34:14.241 --> 01:34:14.842
[SPEAKER_09]: This is interesting.

01:34:15.862 --> 01:34:21.286
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you know that women in gaming don't get a whole lot of coverage sometimes.

01:34:21.306 --> 01:34:24.628
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a controversial subject, you know, are they really into games, da-da-da-da-da.

01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.349
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

01:34:25.802 --> 01:34:28.744
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:34:51.007 --> 01:34:52.688
[SPEAKER_09]: because they don't know what a good game is.

01:35:22.388 --> 01:35:22.788
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

01:35:24.029 --> 01:35:24.370
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:25.631
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you think that is?

01:35:25.711 --> 01:35:36.760
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because, you know, cell phone games are easy to pick up or that maybe the games they put out on cell phones tend to be more puzzle games, pop cap type of games that reach the non-gamer in general.

01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:39.122
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just women, but the non-gamer in general.

01:35:39.502 --> 01:35:42.905
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, obviously not all women are non-gamers.

01:35:42.965 --> 01:35:46.888
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one that co-hosts this show and, you know, we're talking about, you know,

01:35:47.861 --> 01:35:53.025
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus those cell phone games are very simple, so then women can understand them.

01:35:53.045 --> 01:35:54.446
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's not just one, but the non-gamer.

01:35:54.807 --> 01:35:55.167
[SPEAKER_06]: Women.

01:35:55.407 --> 01:35:55.867
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

01:35:57.108 --> 01:35:57.969
[SPEAKER_09]: Hate mail coming in.

01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:59.951
[SPEAKER_09]: You can address those cards and letters to Shane.

01:36:00.791 --> 01:36:02.413
[SPEAKER_09]: He doesn't have an Orange Tantra to account, though.

01:36:02.433 --> 01:36:04.074
[SPEAKER_09]: We won't give him one after that, that's for sure.

01:36:06.316 --> 01:36:07.056
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's interesting, though?

01:36:07.076 --> 01:36:11.680
[SPEAKER_09]: I was mentioning before Nintendo will probably shut that Zelda thing down, but they're really not in cell phone gaming.

01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:16.444
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems like if Nintendo's trying to make this real, you know, we want to reach all the non-gamers...

01:36:17.111 --> 01:36:20.112
[SPEAKER_09]: This should be evidence to them that maybe they ought to get into mobile gaming.

01:36:20.152 --> 01:36:26.755
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, again, am not a big fan of mobile gaming, but I would think it would be kind of cool if I could play Ice Climber on my cell phone or something.

01:36:26.876 --> 01:36:27.116
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

01:36:27.276 --> 01:36:28.276
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:36:29.277 --> 01:36:29.997
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think?

01:36:31.001 --> 01:36:34.365
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to open up the Skype line right now if you guys want to call in on any subject really.

01:36:34.405 --> 01:36:38.050
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a question or comment or whatever you want to say, our Skype line is open.

01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:41.234
[SPEAKER_09]: For more information, go to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:36:41.254 --> 01:36:42.555
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on Interact With Us.

01:36:43.016 --> 01:36:45.659
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can always give us a call on our normal phone line.

01:36:45.699 --> 01:36:45.880
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 916-226-9067.

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:53.624
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, kids, that it might be a toll call if you don't live next door to us.

01:36:54.725 --> 01:36:57.705
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, do you have any quick last-minute stories, anybody?

01:36:59.266 --> 01:36:59.766
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, no.

01:37:00.186 --> 01:37:03.167
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, I don't know, I think this is kind of interesting.

01:37:03.547 --> 01:37:15.030
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to look up and see what my phone had, but unfortunately, I am stupid, and I don't know what kind of... I know I have a Samsung phone, but the model number is... something I don't know.

01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:17.771
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, yeah, that makes it tough.

01:37:18.986 --> 01:37:20.607
[SPEAKER_10]: GK128 My grandmother lives off of shitty pogo games.

01:37:20.627 --> 01:37:22.308
[SPEAKER_09]: Their simplicity and fun to non-gamers is the draw.

01:37:22.328 --> 01:37:25.390
[SPEAKER_09]: If Nintendo wants women to get into gaming, they need to come out with a vacuum controller.

01:37:25.450 --> 01:37:26.151
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are horrible.

01:37:47.853 --> 01:37:49.374
[SPEAKER_06]: We're only speaking the truth.

01:37:50.475 --> 01:37:56.580
[SPEAKER_09]: The views and opinions expressed by Miklatov are not necessarily those of the rest of us.

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:58.462
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:58.502 --> 01:37:58.922
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

01:37:59.883 --> 01:38:04.227
[SPEAKER_09]: You should know by now who it is as much as I call every single week.

01:38:04.327 --> 01:38:06.168
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, we get the same callers every week.

01:38:06.408 --> 01:38:08.370
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I have to say this though, callers.

01:38:09.571 --> 01:38:14.055
[SPEAKER_09]: I lurk sometimes on some message forums that people don't know I lurk on.

01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:17.817
[SPEAKER_09]: and I saw some people talking smack about Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:20.142 --> 01:38:21.805
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what they say the weak point of the show is?

01:38:23.349 --> 01:38:24.231
[SPEAKER_09]: The call-in segments.

01:38:26.047 --> 01:38:30.510
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, we open up this show to folks to call in because we want it to be your show.

01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:32.971
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to be here and be all, oh, we're better than you, da-da-da.

01:38:32.991 --> 01:38:34.432
[SPEAKER_09]: We want this to be your show as well.

01:38:35.033 --> 01:38:38.395
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just want you guys to know, people on the interweb are talking shit about you.

01:38:38.475 --> 01:38:39.035
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's okay.

01:38:39.055 --> 01:38:41.997
[SPEAKER_09]: They talk shit about DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all the time as well.

01:38:42.037 --> 01:38:42.698
[SPEAKER_09]: So what can you do?

01:38:43.018 --> 01:38:43.318
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck them.

01:38:43.438 --> 01:38:44.939
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay because I got your back, so.

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:45.379
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

01:38:45.559 --> 01:38:46.220
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll protect us.

01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:47.080
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, Ranma?

01:38:47.941 --> 01:38:48.401
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much.

01:38:48.421 --> 01:38:50.022
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple of things I want to talk about.

01:38:50.122 --> 01:38:52.884
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, as you brought up about people talking smack,

01:38:53.502 --> 01:38:58.565
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember from Anime Next they had a group there called otakugeneration.net doing a podcast.

01:38:58.965 --> 01:39:02.167
[SPEAKER_07]: They gave me their card and I said, hey, have you heard of Orange Dogs Radio?

01:39:02.488 --> 01:39:06.470
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the guys said, yeah, I've heard of them, but their show isn't all that good.

01:39:06.730 --> 01:39:09.792
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, well, I am close friends with the staff.

01:39:10.393 --> 01:39:10.993
[SPEAKER_07]: He did a 180.

01:39:11.053 --> 01:39:12.374
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh, their show is great.

01:39:12.394 --> 01:39:13.194
[SPEAKER_07]: They're awesome.

01:39:13.435 --> 01:39:13.855
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't hurt me.

01:39:17.321 --> 01:39:18.683
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, though?

01:39:18.703 --> 01:39:22.128
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think indie podcasters should be bashing on each other.

01:39:22.268 --> 01:39:23.349
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's a smart move.

01:39:23.409 --> 01:39:25.613
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the indie podcasters should be coming together.

01:39:26.594 --> 01:39:27.896
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never listened to that program.

01:39:27.936 --> 01:39:29.358
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know anybody over that program.

01:39:30.139 --> 01:39:30.460
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.102
[SPEAKER_09]: I have nothing bad to say about them because I wouldn't.

01:39:32.402 --> 01:39:34.883
[SPEAKER_09]: If I did have something bad to say about them, I wouldn't say it at all.

01:39:35.183 --> 01:39:41.786
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think indie podcasters have to work together because we have to work against corporate dollars and all this corporate stuff.

01:39:42.046 --> 01:39:45.488
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, reminds me about the whole podcast awards thing.

01:39:45.508 --> 01:39:47.769
[SPEAKER_09]: The nominations are open right now for the podcast awards.

01:39:48.889 --> 01:40:15.209
[SPEAKER_09]: PodcastWords.com obviously we would love it if you would consider nominating us again in the gaming podcast category but honestly guys as long as an independent podcaster wins it I'm happy and across the board and I encourage you to nominate other independent podcasters in the other categories as well this is how we get the word of mouth out and I think independent podcasters should be working on promoting each other not cutting each other down because then that's when the corporates will just sneak through and win

01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:21.957
[SPEAKER_09]: I have plenty of bad things I can say about corporate podcasts, but I try not to be negative.

01:40:22.017 --> 01:40:22.879
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, sorry.

01:40:23.339 --> 01:40:23.760
[SPEAKER_09]: Tangent.

01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:24.340
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

01:40:24.381 --> 01:40:24.801
[SPEAKER_07]: Your call.

01:40:24.841 --> 01:40:25.402
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

01:40:26.023 --> 01:40:27.344
[SPEAKER_07]: Send me a bunch of cards.

01:40:27.605 --> 01:40:28.946
[SPEAKER_07]: Otacon is like in a month.

01:40:29.047 --> 01:40:29.848
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll pass them out.

01:40:30.128 --> 01:40:30.428
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:40:31.069 --> 01:40:33.773
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there's any haters, I want you to cut them for me.

01:40:34.525 --> 01:40:34.905
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

01:40:35.205 --> 01:40:36.245
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, what else is on your mind, Ranma?

01:40:36.845 --> 01:40:40.966
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, there's a couple of things I spoke with Jamie about that I didn't get to tell you guys.

01:40:41.086 --> 01:40:46.888
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there was talk some time back about older Super NES games that you had a load time.

01:40:47.368 --> 01:40:48.688
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of them was Street Fighter Alpha 2.

01:40:48.868 --> 01:40:50.328
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

01:40:50.368 --> 01:40:53.869
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there's another game I remember renting from the video store.

01:40:54.029 --> 01:40:55.629
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Batman Returns.

01:40:55.829 --> 01:40:59.930
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time you went to the next level, it went to black and it said, now loading.

01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:02.111
[SPEAKER_07]: Two minutes later, I'm in the next level.

01:41:02.251 --> 01:41:02.831
[SPEAKER_09]: For real?

01:41:03.604 --> 01:41:03.804
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:07.066
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, I thought I played the Batman Returns game too.

01:41:07.106 --> 01:41:08.947
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that like a Final Fight type game?

01:41:09.688 --> 01:41:13.150
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of, but it was like really stick figure-ish like Streak of Rage.

01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:14.170
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh.

01:41:16.011 --> 01:41:16.432
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

01:41:16.672 --> 01:41:20.154
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, it wasn't, again, it was one of those movie franchise games that wasn't that great.

01:41:20.774 --> 01:41:23.115
[SPEAKER_09]: Most movie franchise games kind of suck.

01:41:23.436 --> 01:41:25.177
[SPEAKER_09]: Most, but there are, you know, some that stand out.

01:41:25.197 --> 01:41:27.238
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, okay, well that's,

01:41:27.901 --> 01:41:28.821
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:41:52.981 --> 01:41:54.062
[SPEAKER_07]: Parasol Stars.

01:41:54.602 --> 01:41:55.563
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

01:41:55.583 --> 01:41:58.045
[SPEAKER_09]: TurboGrafx-16, baby!

01:41:58.085 --> 01:41:59.506
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've played Parasol Stars.

01:41:59.546 --> 01:42:01.828
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep forgetting that's technically in the Bubble Bobble world.

01:42:02.169 --> 01:42:04.991
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they had a version of Parasol Stars, I want to say, on Nintendo as well.

01:42:05.071 --> 01:42:06.292
[SPEAKER_09]: It was crap, but it was there.

01:42:06.973 --> 01:42:07.673
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you serious?

01:42:07.833 --> 01:42:08.554
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say.

01:42:08.634 --> 01:42:08.954
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

01:42:09.555 --> 01:42:12.077
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have been one of those really bad Asian hacks.

01:42:12.097 --> 01:42:17.461
[SPEAKER_10]: You know they're releasing Bubble Bobble Revolution and Rainbow Islands Revolution for the DS pretty soon.

01:42:18.682 --> 01:42:19.803
[SPEAKER_10]: Must have this now.

01:42:19.823 --> 01:42:19.903
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

01:42:22.731 --> 01:42:24.933
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as Parasol Stars is in there, I'll buy it.

01:42:25.113 --> 01:42:25.314
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

01:42:25.414 --> 01:42:25.894
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not.

01:42:26.515 --> 01:42:28.257
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish they would put these games in as unlocks.

01:42:28.277 --> 01:42:32.281
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I made sad faces when Salamander wasn't in the Gradius Collections.

01:42:32.301 --> 01:42:34.783
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys know it as Life Force if you don't deal with the importance.

01:42:34.803 --> 01:42:35.484
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Life Force.

01:42:35.524 --> 01:42:36.825
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's like one of the best ones.

01:42:36.865 --> 01:42:38.067
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not in the collection.

01:42:38.087 --> 01:42:38.487
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I agree.

01:42:38.527 --> 01:42:38.907
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad.

01:42:39.693 --> 01:42:46.897
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami

01:43:03.717 --> 01:43:09.559
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Loki, you talked about last week how the anime video games aren't doing as successful as expected.

01:43:09.899 --> 01:43:11.380
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you one of the reasons why.

01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:26.785
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the reasons is because some of these games are already being played on import at anime cons, and then when these companies bring them over, the main thing that the fans complain about, they want the Japanese voices, and they are originally taken out.

01:43:26.986 --> 01:43:29.707
[SPEAKER_07]: They take them all out, and the fans don't really want to buy them.

01:43:29.887 --> 01:43:30.827
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, stop doing that.

01:43:33.098 --> 01:43:35.180
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they do in Soul Calibur.

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:36.241
[SPEAKER_07]: You can pick between the two.

01:43:37.042 --> 01:43:38.383
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that, especially Toshinden 3.

01:43:38.423 --> 01:43:39.904
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of my all-time favorites.

01:43:41.366 --> 01:43:45.489
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I got Naruto, but Ninja, and I'm dealing with half the voices.

01:43:45.509 --> 01:43:46.270
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, come on.

01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:51.715
[SPEAKER_07]: When they did that half-assed Inuyasha fighting game, you had the option of Japanese and English voices.

01:43:51.955 --> 01:43:55.558
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when they did the 2D fighter from PS1, they threw us a bone.

01:43:55.598 --> 01:43:56.199
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, come on.

01:43:56.299 --> 01:43:56.980
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go for it.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:57.380
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:43:57.768 --> 01:43:59.049
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Ranma, this call's running long.

01:43:59.069 --> 01:43:59.869
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to let you go, buddy.

01:43:59.909 --> 01:44:00.849
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to get some other folks in.

01:44:00.869 --> 01:44:01.810
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you so much for the call.

01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:02.330
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, okay?

01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:02.710
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, no problem.

01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:03.991
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of took up most of your time.

01:44:04.031 --> 01:44:04.611
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

01:44:05.011 --> 01:44:05.392
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

01:44:05.412 --> 01:44:05.672
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

01:44:05.732 --> 01:44:06.272
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good.

01:44:06.412 --> 01:44:06.612
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:44:06.632 --> 01:44:07.453
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on every week anyway.

01:44:07.493 --> 01:44:07.693
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:44:07.713 --> 01:44:07.913
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

01:44:10.290 --> 01:44:11.531
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Skype line's open.

01:44:11.551 --> 01:44:12.593
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll take one more call.

01:44:13.073 --> 01:44:16.037
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have a lot of time for a lot of calls tonight, so one more call.

01:44:16.057 --> 01:44:17.278
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's someone else who calls in every week.

01:44:17.598 --> 01:44:18.659
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:44:18.679 --> 01:44:19.080
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:20.041
[SPEAKER_05]: RavensDolphin.

01:44:20.281 --> 01:44:21.583
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, what's on your mind, RavensDolphin?

01:44:22.203 --> 01:44:22.624
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing.

01:44:22.884 --> 01:44:24.967
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like online rental games?

01:44:25.047 --> 01:44:26.889
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you mentioned about pre-ordering.

01:44:27.129 --> 01:44:29.411
[SPEAKER_05]: How about going to the next stream, online rental?

01:44:30.192 --> 01:44:31.053
[SPEAKER_05]: GameFly GameFly

01:44:48.595 --> 01:44:50.856
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard for me to comment on it because I haven't really used it first hand.

01:44:51.056 --> 01:44:52.496
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want to comment on something I haven't used.

01:44:52.836 --> 01:44:59.077
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's something I... If I cancel my Netflix, which I'm probably going to, I will probably shift over to Gamefly.

01:44:59.357 --> 01:45:01.998
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I just play more games than I watch movies.

01:45:02.678 --> 01:45:03.318
[SPEAKER_09]: I just really do.

01:45:03.518 --> 01:45:04.058
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

01:45:04.078 --> 01:45:04.638
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you use it?

01:45:05.878 --> 01:45:08.139
[SPEAKER_05]: I just signed up today and I'm just trying it out.

01:45:08.899 --> 01:45:10.339
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think so far?

01:45:10.559 --> 01:45:13.400
[SPEAKER_09]: How is the setup online and everything and the ease of getting started?

01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:14.400
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen.

01:45:16.124 --> 01:45:16.824
[SPEAKER_05]: Super seamless.

01:45:17.245 --> 01:45:19.886
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do is just create your game queue and they'll send it to you.

01:45:20.366 --> 01:45:20.866
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlimited.

01:45:21.406 --> 01:45:23.687
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I like because games are getting expensive.

01:45:23.948 --> 01:45:25.248
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony wants to put $100 to $50 per game now.

01:45:29.291 --> 01:45:36.256
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be very interesting to see what the online rental market is going to do to some of the game ideas.

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:40.399
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess this kind of stuff is getting bigger and bigger, so interesting.

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.061
[SPEAKER_09]: I am tempted to check it out.

01:45:43.482 --> 01:45:45.904
[SPEAKER_09]: We do a podcast that lots of people listen to.

01:45:45.964 --> 01:45:47.305
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't one of these companies give us a free one?

01:45:49.062 --> 01:45:51.443
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, maybe that's just my ego getting in the way, I guess.

01:45:52.664 --> 01:45:57.126
[SPEAKER_09]: I might check it out, but again, I don't want to have that and Netflix, although I have a friend that has them both.

01:45:57.706 --> 01:46:02.068
[SPEAKER_09]: A coworker of mine uses it and seems to like it, so I'll check it out one of these days.

01:46:02.948 --> 01:46:04.229
[SPEAKER_09]: But for now, I'm more of a collector.

01:46:04.469 --> 01:46:11.772
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet if DarkSakura would hear, that would be her angle on it, is that she likes to collect them, so she likes to own them and actually have them.

01:46:12.503 --> 01:46:19.085
[SPEAKER_05]: I am very glad to say I do know one that does rent Legend games, but I can't remember it.

01:46:20.485 --> 01:46:20.785
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:46:21.365 --> 01:46:21.846
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, buddy.

01:46:21.866 --> 01:46:22.686
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thanks for the call.

01:46:22.746 --> 01:46:23.506
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, okay?

01:46:24.446 --> 01:46:24.966
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:46:25.086 --> 01:46:25.326
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:46:25.366 --> 01:46:26.887
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you later.

01:46:28.087 --> 01:46:28.327
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

01:46:28.527 --> 01:46:28.907
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

01:46:30.828 --> 01:46:31.928
[SPEAKER_10]: I found something interesting.

01:46:32.068 --> 01:46:34.249
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

01:46:34.329 --> 01:46:37.230
[SPEAKER_10]: I found a picture of an Xbox 360.

01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.390
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

01:46:38.826 --> 01:46:48.011
[SPEAKER_10]: Motherboard, and they're saying that it's going to get an HDMI out upgrade, and that they're putting an HDMI out port right next to the... Wait, no, bad, I already have an Xbox.

01:46:48.792 --> 01:46:49.972
[SPEAKER_10]: Well... Shit!

01:46:50.013 --> 01:46:51.713
[SPEAKER_10]: So that, this is on Kotaku.

01:46:51.874 --> 01:46:57.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go trade them into GameStop, and then we can put that credit towards a new one.

01:46:57.317 --> 01:47:04.101
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that I really need an HDMI out, but I think that's kind of interesting that they have that on there.

01:47:04.861 --> 01:47:05.181
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

01:47:05.762 --> 01:47:07.443
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, any more stories anybody has?

01:47:07.783 --> 01:47:08.023
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

01:47:08.737 --> 01:47:09.297
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have anything.

01:47:12.039 --> 01:47:13.399
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I have anything either.

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:18.862
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then I think we're going to go ahead and wrap it up, so let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:47:19.182 --> 01:47:20.843
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane, thank you for sitting in with us tonight.

01:47:20.883 --> 01:47:23.284
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed you actually put World of Warcraft away at some point.

01:47:23.664 --> 01:47:26.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was annoying to play and listen to people.

01:47:26.485 --> 01:47:27.986
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry we ruined your night.

01:47:28.346 --> 01:47:28.827
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thought.

01:47:30.187 --> 01:47:31.508
[SPEAKER_06]: Women shouldn't be allowed to vote.

01:47:34.244 --> 01:47:36.525
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Loki, your final thought.

01:47:36.645 --> 01:47:41.047
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is actually the official statement from Sony regarding the Apple logo on their site.

01:47:41.567 --> 01:47:53.291
[SPEAKER_10]: In a recent update to PlayStation 3's section of the US PlayStation.com website, an external error was made during the upload process, and the Apple icon was mistakenly placed on the site.

01:47:53.611 --> 01:47:56.913
[SPEAKER_10]: We immediately fixed the problem and apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

01:47:57.793 --> 01:47:58.753
[SPEAKER_10]: They copied!

01:47:59.074 --> 01:48:01.755
[SPEAKER_10]: They stole it from somebody, but they're not copping to it.

01:48:01.795 --> 01:48:02.775
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony bad, Sony.

01:48:04.391 --> 01:48:06.252
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I want ice cream.

01:48:06.952 --> 01:48:13.314
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting independent video game radio.

01:48:13.354 --> 01:48:14.335

[SPEAKER_09]: We love our fans.

01:48:16.455 --> 01:48:17.336
[SPEAKER_09]: We love our chatters.

01:48:17.376 --> 01:48:19.336
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, chat room, for tuning in and listening tonight.

01:48:19.436 --> 01:48:20.437
[SPEAKER_06]: Nominate us.

01:48:20.597 --> 01:48:20.917
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.

01:48:21.557 --> 01:48:23.778
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have something I'm supposed to say on there.

01:48:23.818 --> 01:48:24.478
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

01:48:24.498 --> 01:48:24.838
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:48:25.458 --> 01:48:26.899
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate Sky is Cool.

01:48:27.509 --> 01:48:29.030
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what I was supposed to say.

01:48:29.050 --> 01:48:34.854
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't cut that out like you want to.

01:48:35.094 --> 01:48:35.595
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

01:48:36.595 --> 01:48:37.676
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great week, everybody.

01:48:37.736 --> 01:48:40.638

[SPEAKER_09]: All three of us will be here.

01:48:44.821 --> 01:48:45.521
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be a blast.

01:48:45.561 --> 01:48:46.782
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for tuning in.

01:48:46.842 --> 01:48:47.883
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, no Part B this week.

01:48:51.085 --> 01:48:53.307
