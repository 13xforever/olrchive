Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Molochi

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight, Sony stirs up major controversy with a new billboard,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Nintendo gives President Bush a birthday present,

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
and does Microsoft have some secret Christmas plans?

00:25.000 --> 00:35.680
Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.680 --> 00:41.520
This is episode number 190 for this July the 8th of 2006.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.960
We're taping a day early this week.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.240
I've had all these screwed up travel plans these past couple weeks and it's kind of been

00:48.240 --> 00:51.680
screwing up the taping schedule of the show.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.500
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky and I'm here to talk about video games

00:54.500 --> 00:58.940
with you guys and not here tonight is Dark Sakura. She's actually on assignment. She's

00:58.940 --> 01:01.940
going to call us a little later in the show and tell us about where she's at and what

01:01.940 --> 01:05.940
she's doing. However, say hello to the one and only Loki who is here tonight.

01:05.940 --> 01:06.940
Yes, I am.

01:06.940 --> 01:07.940
How you doing?

01:07.940 --> 01:08.940
I'm doing good.

01:08.940 --> 01:12.220
Good. Also with us tonight, we do have a special guest because it might get kind of boring

01:12.220 --> 01:16.540
if it's just Loki and I. So we brought on our good buddy, Shane. How you doing?

01:16.540 --> 01:17.540
I'm doing good.

01:17.540 --> 01:18.540
Also known as Miklotov.

01:18.540 --> 01:19.540
Yep.

01:19.540 --> 01:22.900
And now Shane is actually, he's being hardcore tonight. He's actually playing a game during

01:22.900 --> 01:23.900
the show.

01:23.900 --> 01:29.900
multi-tasking. I'm hardcore every show. You usually play games too, don't you? Well, you

01:29.900 --> 01:33.500
do them on break. I'll be doing the music break and then he'll come back. Sometimes

01:33.500 --> 01:36.860
because you yell at me if I play them during the show. Well, because it gets distracting.

01:36.860 --> 01:41.140
Even this is distracting. You just turn it down. I don't know how to work a Mac. He's

01:41.140 --> 01:45.340
playing on my Mac. Poor portion. What are you playing? You're playing World of Warcraft,

01:45.340 --> 01:49.540
right? I'm playing World of Warcraft. Fun. Alright, we're going to get into the show

01:49.540 --> 01:53.580
real quick, but just first a couple of housekeeping announcements.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.440
Of course, we are taping a day early this week.

01:55.440 --> 01:58.920
We are live on Saturday, not Sunday, so if you'd like to join us, if you're listening

01:58.920 --> 02:02.400

02:02.400 --> 02:04.900
chat room, orangelauntrader.com, click on chat.

02:04.900 --> 02:11.180
We will be back to our regular taping schedules next week, so Sunday the 16th at 6 p.m. Pacific

02:11.180 --> 02:12.180
Time.

02:12.180 --> 02:16.220
We're taping live on our station, orangelauntrader.com, but of course, you can always catch up via

02:16.220 --> 02:19.420
our podcast feed which is also at orangelountrader.com

02:19.420 --> 02:22.260
also tonight it's only gonna be a one-part show there's not gonna be a

02:22.260 --> 02:23.380
part B this week

02:23.380 --> 02:27.140
but just like last week I mean it ended up being like at least an hour and a

02:27.140 --> 02:29.780
half if not more so that's probably what tonight's show is gonna end up being a little

02:29.780 --> 02:30.520
bit of too

02:30.520 --> 02:33.700
so let's get it started we always like to start off with

02:33.700 --> 02:37.020
what we've been playing this week. Loki, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?

02:37.020 --> 02:40.460
I've been trying to finish Blazing Angels the entire game

02:40.460 --> 02:43.540
and I have six out of seven achievements that's all that matters

02:43.540 --> 02:50.540
I've already beaten the game, and I can tell you this much, the game SUCKS really bad.

02:50.540 --> 02:51.820
Why do you keep playing?

02:51.820 --> 02:56.200
I got it for free, and I want to finish the achievement points before I send it back to

02:56.200 --> 03:02.300
its used game grave at GameStop.

03:02.300 --> 03:07.980
But it's one of those games I did not buy, so I'm glad I didn't waste the money on it.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.900
When I saw it, when it was coming out, I was like, oh hey, you know that looks pretty cool.

03:10.900 --> 03:17.800
There's nothing like them, the 360, and no, I'll wait for the next one, because this one,

03:17.800 --> 03:22.800
I don't know, it just wasn't that fun, it was kind of, all the missions are basically

03:22.800 --> 03:27.360
the same, and some, like the missions are pretty similar difficulties, and then some

03:27.360 --> 03:32.620
are just like way out there, like way too damn hard, and I don't get why they did that.

03:32.620 --> 03:36.160
And then it goes like super easy afterwards, so whatever.

03:36.160 --> 03:39.400
But I'm almost done, all I gotta do now is I have to play through these standard arcade

03:39.400 --> 03:44.400
modes which you have to play with 32 different planes. I have to play it 32 times all the

03:44.400 --> 03:51.400
way through and basically you take on like 4 different waves of planes and it's really

03:51.400 --> 03:57.760
boring. But once I do that I'll have the last achievement. So that's all that matters. And

03:57.760 --> 04:00.880
I don't know if the multiplayer online is any good but I know the multiplayer split

04:00.880 --> 04:06.200
screen is kind of lame. So I don't know. It'll be worth checking out. I did also get to play

04:06.200 --> 04:12.340
the ChromeHounds demo which is pretty awesome and unfortunately the mechs are pretty slow

04:12.340 --> 04:16.720
in it so I did play a little bit more of that. Can't wait for the final game to come out

04:16.720 --> 04:22.040
I think this week. And then Prey also played some of that. That game reminds me so much

04:22.040 --> 04:27.420
of Duke Nukem 3D. It's just crazy. They actually have inside the arcade where you first start

04:27.420 --> 04:33.300
off in the bar. There's an arcade game that's like Pac-Man and you can actually play the

04:33.300 --> 04:39.460
arcade game in there, which is kinda neat. So, very interactive, just like Duke Nukem

04:39.460 --> 04:45.460
3D, and kinda similar to Doom 3 in how dark and, you know, just kinda the way the game

04:45.460 --> 04:50.700
is. But uh, should be good. Waiting for August though, when all the good games come out.

04:50.700 --> 04:53.060
Like what are you looking forward to in August specifically?

04:53.060 --> 04:59.000
Dead Rising, Saints Row, Enchanted Arms, um, those are pretty much the three I think that

04:59.000 --> 05:01.900
I wanna pick up, yeah. Alright, very cool.

05:01.900 --> 05:05.900
My gaming week I was in Canada most of the week on vacation

05:05.900 --> 05:09.660
So I took a vacation from you know the internet and gaming a lot in general

05:09.660 --> 05:14.980
But I did buy a new PSP game for the flight down there. I bought

05:15.580 --> 05:17.580
Gradius collection on PSP

05:18.060 --> 05:22.200
Which I got to play a little bit of when I was at Konami gamers day earlier this year

05:22.200 --> 05:24.540
But I didn't get to do a whole lot in depth with it

05:24.540 --> 05:29.340
So I'm glad I got to spend more time with it and really play most of the games and a lot of the Gradius games

05:29.340 --> 05:31.340
I never really played

05:31.340 --> 05:36.340
I had not really played Gradius Gaiden, which is included on there, and I really like that one.

05:36.340 --> 05:38.340
That's actually probably my favorite Gradius in the collection,

05:38.340 --> 05:40.340
and Gradius 4 I don't think I've ever played before.

05:40.340 --> 05:46.340
I've played 5, I've played 3, I've played 2 on emulators because it was only out in Japan, I believe.

05:46.340 --> 05:52.340
But now I've gotten a chance to play all the Gradius games, and it makes a good collection.

05:52.340 --> 05:57.340
You know, they enhanced Gradius 1 and 2 a little bit so that it's widescreen.

05:57.340 --> 06:02.440
screen. It's not perfectly the PSP's resolution, you can downsize it to the

06:02.440 --> 06:05.580
regular resolution, but it works well on the widescreen. You don't feel like the

06:05.580 --> 06:10.040
game stretched or anything like that. The game plays pretty smoothly. I would say

06:10.040 --> 06:13.520
my favorite game out of the bunch is Gradius Gaiden, probably Gradius 3, my

06:13.520 --> 06:16.720
least favorite, just because I don't like the way that game starts. I don't

06:16.720 --> 06:19.480
like the first stage in it. The difficulty curve in that one

06:19.480 --> 06:22.960
seems to be a lot higher than the other games, but it's a good game for

06:22.960 --> 06:26.280
rekindling all your favorite Gradius memories, like, you know, oh it's the

06:26.280 --> 06:29.400
Easter Island heads and all that stuff.

06:29.400 --> 06:33.960
The only other thing that probably bothered me about the game was the price, it was $39.99

06:33.960 --> 06:34.960
for the game.

06:34.960 --> 06:40.500
And while it's a real great, you know, it's still a pretty good value, it's kind of surprising

06:40.500 --> 06:45.560
that old games are demanding $40, but I guess it's just because you get so many of them

06:45.560 --> 06:47.340
and they did rehash it.

06:47.340 --> 06:52.240
It's a good buy, I would recommend it, especially if you're into shooters, because it's a good

06:52.240 --> 06:53.240
no attention span shooter.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.280
You know, you just pick it up, go, have fun with it.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.160
I also like that you can save your progress anywhere, so you can just save and come back

06:59.160 --> 07:03.460
later instead of having to start over every time like the old versions of Gradius.

07:03.460 --> 07:06.540
The other disappointment is that I don't see Salamander unless it's an unlock.

07:06.540 --> 07:09.860
I need to check Game Facts to see if maybe I just haven't unlocked it yet because I haven't

07:09.860 --> 07:13.460
actually beat any of the Gradius games yet while I've had it because I keep having ADD,

07:13.460 --> 07:16.140
I go back and forth to all the different games.

07:16.140 --> 07:18.980
And I couldn't get the up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA code to work

07:18.980 --> 07:24.400
mainly because there is no BA buttons on the PSP, but I press what I think would be BA,

07:24.400 --> 07:27.760
it doesn't seem to work because when you pause the game it actually takes you

07:27.760 --> 07:32.320
into a menu so I'm thinking that might be why it doesn't work so maybe I need

07:32.320 --> 07:35.400
to read up on the cheats for that one because who didn't do the up up down

07:35.400 --> 07:39.440
down at least once on the original Gradius on the NES come on give you all

07:39.440 --> 07:41.920
the power-ups it was great but you remember the Super Nintendo one would

07:41.920 --> 07:45.120
mess with you if you did that it would actually blow up your ship but if you

07:45.120 --> 07:49.240
use the L and R buttons for left right left right that's how you did it that's

07:49.240 --> 07:54.480
That's a real old fact, old data, I know.

07:54.480 --> 07:57.680
We're here on the cutting edge, giving you the Super Nintendo game tips.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.800
Alright, that's about it, other than World of Warcraft and that stuff.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.160
Shane, what have you been playing this week?

08:03.160 --> 08:04.160
World of Warcraft.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.160
Is that it?

08:05.160 --> 08:06.920
No, it's not it.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.000
I've been playing fun things at work as normal.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.080
Yeah, but you can't talk about those things.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.360
No, but I had a good time with them this week.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.040
So Konami's got some good stuff coming out?

08:16.040 --> 08:22.080
Who knows, except for me and people that work there in Konami.

08:22.080 --> 08:27.680
Then I also played some Awendon this week, because I love that game a lot.

08:27.680 --> 08:34.400
And my computer at home broke, so I can't play WoW there, so to pass the time, I downloaded

08:34.400 --> 08:40.160
Bejeweled 2 on Xbox Live Arcade, and that game, I always love Bejeweled, and I don't

08:40.160 --> 08:45.720
I don't think it works too well on the 360, but it's got really good music, so it was

08:45.720 --> 08:48.000
worth it.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.480
I think it's pretty.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.700
I'll give it that.

08:50.700 --> 08:51.700
The game?

08:51.700 --> 08:53.520
Or the music?

08:53.520 --> 08:54.520
The game.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.040
It looks nice on HD and all that good stuff.

08:56.040 --> 09:00.600
It looks nice, but it's not as easy to play because, you know, when you play it on computer

09:00.600 --> 09:04.480
you have your mouse and you can go really quick to whatever little jewel you want to

09:04.480 --> 09:05.480
swap.

09:05.480 --> 09:11.720
But in this one you have to move up three times and left three times.

09:11.720 --> 09:15.200
So I don't think it plays well, but the music's really good.

09:15.200 --> 09:20.040
And I guess the only other thing I've done this week is at work we follow certain sites.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.720
Can I say that site right there?

09:21.720 --> 09:22.720
I don't know.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.720
Yeah, that's fine.

09:23.720 --> 09:24.720
Okay.

09:24.720 --> 09:29.320
We follow the Game Facts Best Series Ever contest and we put money on it.

09:29.320 --> 09:33.280
So I've been paying very close attention to that this week and I'm very upset by what's

09:33.280 --> 09:34.740
going on today on the poll.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.060
happening today right now?

09:36.060 --> 09:40.500
Halo is losing to Castlevania, and I picked Halo to win over Castlevania.

09:40.500 --> 09:43.280
They do those little, like, tournaments once in a while, like, I know they do the best

09:43.280 --> 09:44.280
video game characters.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.900
It's like $130 at work is on the line here.

09:45.900 --> 09:50.460
Halo is like, what, two games, I wouldn't really call that a series, I mean, granted

09:50.460 --> 09:54.860
there's a third game coming out, but that's not much of a series, where Castlevania...

09:54.860 --> 09:57.060
Well, they're only two of the most popular games of all time.

09:57.060 --> 10:01.460
Yeah, but how many systems has Castlevania been on, versus, you know, how many systems

10:01.460 --> 10:02.460
has Halo been on?

10:02.460 --> 10:05.620
Well yeah, I would vote Castlevania, personally, but that's just because...

10:05.620 --> 10:09.760
Yeah, I would have too, but you have to think, okay, these people that come to the site,

10:09.760 --> 10:11.080
what do they like more?

10:11.080 --> 10:13.040
And I thought maybe they like Halo more.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.040
I was wrong.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.320
Apparently they like Fire Emblem more than Silent Hill, because they're idiots.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.320
What?

10:18.320 --> 10:19.320
Fire Emblem more than Silent Hill?

10:19.320 --> 10:23.280
Yeah, we had one person in our bedding pool that picked Fire Emblem, and the rest of us

10:23.280 --> 10:28.300
picked Silent Hill, so we all got screwed over there too, and I'm gonna drop today now

10:28.300 --> 10:31.220
because of Halo sucking so much.

10:31.220 --> 10:35.220
doesn't suck, you're just bitter. Sadly, that doesn't surprise me, though, that Fire Emblem

10:35.220 --> 10:37.300
beat Silent Hill.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.220
Those to me, but whatever.

10:39.220 --> 10:44.020
Interesting. Oh, I'm looking in our chat room over at orange-os-ready.com, click on chat,

10:44.020 --> 10:48.700
and gk128, I guess, is in some sort of betting pool, too. He says, Halo's lost, fuck me,

10:48.700 --> 10:51.220
too. I chose Halo to go three rounds.

10:51.220 --> 10:55.820
Oh, that's terrible! Because you know what? Halo wouldn't have won over Kingdom Hearts,

10:55.820 --> 11:00.340
which is the next 2-in. So, no, Halo couldn't make three rounds.

11:00.340 --> 11:01.980
Which series did you pick to win at all?

11:01.980 --> 11:07.300
I had the final two being Final Fantasy and Zelda, and I have Zelda winning.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.420
I don't know, Final Fantasy, a lot of fanboys...

11:09.420 --> 11:10.420
Last year?

11:10.420 --> 11:16.620
Well see, I'm thinking to the betting last year where it was best character, and Link

11:16.620 --> 11:22.300
won over all the Final Fantasy characters, so I'm hoping people aren't stupid.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.980
Yeah, but a lot of Final Fantasy characters are forgettable.

11:24.980 --> 11:25.980
I mean...

11:25.980 --> 11:34.420
Well it was, I believe it was Link vs. Cloud, and come on Final Fantasy 7 person, everybody

11:34.420 --> 11:35.420
loves Final Fantasy 7.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.420
I know, Cloud, Aeris, Sephiroth.

11:37.420 --> 11:40.460
I think it was Sephiroth vs. Cloud for a little bit.

11:40.460 --> 11:43.380
Tidus and Yuna, I mean come on.

11:43.380 --> 11:47.060
I was just trying to use my knowledge from last year because I didn't win last year,

11:47.060 --> 11:48.060
I didn't even come close.

11:48.060 --> 11:49.840
This year I'm doing better though at least.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.540
Cecil from 4?

11:51.540 --> 11:52.540
Who?

11:52.540 --> 11:55.660
Locke the treasure hunter from 6?

11:55.660 --> 11:56.660
I'm not a thief.

11:56.660 --> 11:57.660
Alright, forget it.

11:57.660 --> 11:59.660
I like that girl better.

11:59.660 --> 12:01.780
Alright, so that was our gaming week.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.460
I hope you guys had a good gaming week too, even though I don't think there was a whole

12:04.460 --> 12:06.980
lot of new games this week, so you guys-

12:06.980 --> 12:07.980
There was.

12:07.980 --> 12:10.900
Lord of the Rings, Belle from Mary, the Lord of the Rings 2, and that about it.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.180
I didn't really play it at number one though, so.

12:13.180 --> 12:18.220
Well, this is more of like a PC straight- I don't know, it's not my cup of tea.

12:18.220 --> 12:21.180
Didn't Pirates come out this week too?

12:21.180 --> 12:25.740
It was supposed to come out last week and I think it got delayed to the fifth and yeah

12:25.740 --> 12:26.740
it came out finally.

12:26.740 --> 12:27.740
Really?

12:27.740 --> 12:28.740
Huh.

12:28.740 --> 12:29.740
Legend of Jack Brown.

12:29.740 --> 12:30.740
Not that anybody cares.

12:30.740 --> 12:31.740
It was a decent game.

12:31.740 --> 12:32.740
I mean for a movie.

12:32.740 --> 12:33.740
Pirates of the Caribbean?

12:33.740 --> 12:34.740
Yeah I saw it at E3, they gave us a little demo.

12:34.740 --> 12:37.860
We had a, Bethesda actually like invited us to a thingy and we went to and uh.

12:37.860 --> 12:40.260
It was better than the PSP game I can tell you.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.540
I was more impressed with their Star Trek game they're making but uh you know the Pirates

12:43.540 --> 12:44.540
game seemed pretty solid.

12:44.540 --> 12:50.220
For a movie title, I mean you don't expect you're gonna get like a award winning game

12:50.220 --> 12:54.220
out of some of those movie titles. Actually, some of the ones that are coming out, I think, are going to be pretty decent.

12:54.220 --> 12:58.220
Like, Scarface? That looks almost

12:58.220 --> 13:02.220
like they're beating Vice City at their own game. Really?

13:02.220 --> 13:06.220
Well, Vice City ripped off from Scarface anyways, but this looks really damn

13:06.220 --> 13:10.220
good. I mean, I don't know. I'm going to probably check it out

13:10.220 --> 13:14.220
when it comes out in September. And of course, Reservoir Dogs.

13:14.220 --> 13:18.220
That's got me interested now that they explain why it was banned in Australia.

13:18.220 --> 13:19.220
No, uh, where's my Kill Bill game?

13:19.220 --> 13:20.220
Why was it banned?

13:20.220 --> 13:21.220
Where's your Y game?

13:21.220 --> 13:22.860
Do you listen to this show?

13:22.860 --> 13:23.860
Just out of curiosity?

13:23.860 --> 13:24.860
Ever?

13:24.860 --> 13:25.860
No.

13:25.860 --> 13:26.860
Where's your Y game?

13:26.860 --> 13:27.860
Kill Bill.

13:27.860 --> 13:28.860
Kill Bill?

13:28.860 --> 13:29.860
Yeah.

13:29.860 --> 13:30.860
Um...

13:30.860 --> 13:31.860
Red Steel.

13:31.860 --> 13:32.860
Red Steel's probably close enough.

13:32.860 --> 13:37.740
Turn off all the color on your TV and then play like, um, some really gory game and there

13:37.740 --> 13:39.740
you go, there's your Kill Bill game.

13:39.740 --> 13:43.020
Uh, Misty in our chatroom says, who needs new games?

13:43.020 --> 13:46.660
I've been playing the hell out of Emerald and Tetris World's on GBA.

13:46.660 --> 13:53.660
JeremyTod1 wants to know if Battle for Middle Earth 2 is any good. He's thinking about getting it for PC. How's the first one and like that?

13:53.660 --> 14:01.660
Well, it got pretty decent reviews. Like I said though, it doesn't really look that... I used to love RTS games.

14:01.660 --> 14:11.660
Especially Command & Conquer series. But I think I liked it mainly because I could use... I could cheat and make my own characters almost.

14:11.660 --> 14:15.940
almost. And I think that was more fun to me than actually playing through the game. But

14:15.940 --> 14:20.860
I do like, I love the online from like Red Alert. That was my favorite game. I, you know,

14:20.860 --> 14:24.840
back in the day when you'd have to call somebody over the phone, you know, to actually establish

14:24.840 --> 14:29.660
a direct connection with them, you know, not this over the internet crap, you know, over

14:29.660 --> 14:34.660
the modem. Back in my day. And, you know, that was really fun. It was really fun to

14:34.660 --> 14:39.980
play that game. But, you know, nowadays, I don't know, Battle for the Miller 2, I'm not

14:39.980 --> 14:44.300
really that big of a Lord of Rings fan and so I don't know, maybe a rental?

14:44.300 --> 14:48.300
Bandit sent me a private message in chat saying he had a great gaming week, his local arcade

14:48.300 --> 14:52.500
just got DDR Supernova and his legs are killing him, it's definitely worth it.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.900
I guess DDR Supernova is starting to get into arcades there and of course I know a large

14:55.900 --> 14:59.220
part of our fanbase has followed us from the Bomani days when we talked a lot about those

14:59.220 --> 15:02.500
type of games and of course I'm definitely looking forward to checking out the final

15:02.500 --> 15:04.420
build of Dance Dance Revolution Supernova.

15:04.420 --> 15:09.540
We just got them in the bay at the Golf Lands but of course we've had it at Konami forever

15:09.540 --> 15:16.420
And I'm curious to hear what people think of the timing, because I haven't played it

15:16.420 --> 15:23.280
enough to really figure out if it's bad or not, but I'm hearing reports that it's pretty

15:23.280 --> 15:30.860
dang terrible, so if anybody has played it, like that one guy whoever you just said, I

15:30.860 --> 15:33.300
would be interested in hearing what he has to say.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.420
Alright, well let's get into some gaming news and we'll come back to chatroom comments a

15:36.420 --> 15:37.420
little later.

15:37.420 --> 15:45.380
I did want to point out real fast, I did look up Gradius on game facts and I don't see anything

15:45.380 --> 15:48.940
about there being the hidden game.

15:48.940 --> 15:55.380
So that kind of disappoints me that they don't have Salamander locked away in it.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.420
That makes me kind of sad.

15:57.420 --> 15:58.620
Anyway let's get into some news.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.680
This made a lot of people sad this week.

16:00.680 --> 16:05.220
Certainly was a polarizing topic in the gaming community.

16:05.220 --> 16:10.620
You might have heard Sony actually put out an ad for their ceramic white PSP.

16:10.620 --> 16:15.460
Now the ad actually only ran on billboards in the Netherlands, but of course thanks to

16:15.460 --> 16:19.420
the internet the image has circulated worldwide.

16:19.420 --> 16:23.020
And if you haven't seen the image yet, go to just about any major gaming site.

16:23.020 --> 16:24.020
You can see a picture of this.

16:24.020 --> 16:30.520
It's basically a white woman with white hair wearing a white outfit kind of grabbing this

16:30.520 --> 16:35.220
black woman with black hair and a black outfit kind of grabbing her by the cheek or something

16:35.220 --> 16:36.220
like that.

16:36.220 --> 16:40.600
It looks like she's got this very menacing threatening look on her face and it just says

16:40.600 --> 16:43.180
PlayStation Portable White is coming.

16:43.180 --> 16:49.020
And of course people are mad because this is a racist image and why are they doing this

16:49.020 --> 16:53.020
and even politicians over here are starting to get into the whole thing.

16:53.020 --> 17:00.460
Let's see the Sony spokesperson responded to this speaking to the website gamesindustry.biz.

17:00.460 --> 17:05.440
The marketing campaign for the launch of the white PSP focuses on the contrast between

17:05.440 --> 17:09.420
the black PSP model and the new ceramic white PSP model.

17:09.420 --> 17:12.920
A variety of different treatments have been created as a campaign to either highlight

17:12.920 --> 17:16.900
the whiteness of the new model or contrast the black and white models.

17:16.900 --> 17:20.980
Central to this campaign has been the creation of some stunningly photographed imagery that

17:20.980 --> 17:23.940
has been used on large billboards throughout Holland.

17:23.940 --> 17:28.100
All of the 100 or so images created for the campaign have been designed to show this contrast

17:28.100 --> 17:31.900
and colors of the PSPs and have no other messages or purpose."

17:31.900 --> 17:35.020
Hmm, what do you guys think of this?

17:35.020 --> 17:37.740
I think people are stupid for reacting about it.

17:37.740 --> 17:38.740
Really?

17:38.740 --> 17:39.740
Yeah, really.

17:39.740 --> 17:40.740
I think it's retarded.

17:40.740 --> 17:42.580
And in fact, some of the other pictures that they showed weren't that bad.

17:42.580 --> 17:47.060
I mean, they showed, like, you know, cut in half and basically one's white, one's black

17:47.060 --> 17:51.060
not necessarily showing the women, you know, poking each other or whatever.

17:51.060 --> 17:56.580
But it's a fucking ad in another country, and the thing that pisses me off the most

17:56.580 --> 18:00.700
is when politicians over here going, I don't want to see that in my neighborhood. Well

18:00.700 --> 18:05.460
your neighborhood isn't all the way over in fucking, you know, what, Denmark is where

18:05.460 --> 18:11.700
it was? I mean, it's stupid that, especially Congressman Yee. That guy's a dumbass and

18:11.700 --> 18:15.780
needs to shut up. Why? Because he's making a political statement about something that's

18:15.780 --> 18:19.860
in another country. They'll do what they fucking want. They have nudity on television over

18:19.860 --> 18:25.540
in the UK. You don't see them going, oh my God, oh my God, two people of different color.

18:25.540 --> 18:30.100
I have never seen that in my entire life, and oh my god, it's so racist.

18:30.100 --> 18:33.580
To be a devil's advocate here for a minute, though, Sony, I mean, just, you know, I'm

18:33.580 --> 18:38.420
not really sure how I feel about this, I don't, I think the image is a little odd, and it

18:38.420 --> 18:44.080
doesn't exactly make me excited about the, you know, I kind of go, well that's certainly

18:44.080 --> 18:47.700
going to get attention, which I guess an advertising campaign is supposed to do, but it's kind

18:47.700 --> 18:51.980
of one of those, you know, I wouldn't put an image like that out advertising Orange

18:51.980 --> 18:58.220
launch radio that's for sure worst thing about that images what that Europe's

18:58.220 --> 19:01.580
getting the white PSP and we're not that made me angry that's the only thing that

19:01.580 --> 19:07.540
well okay my point though is that Sony is a worldwide company though and they

19:07.540 --> 19:10.820
do release products here in the United States and granted you know when they're

19:10.820 --> 19:13.420
gonna do something like this thanks to the internet you know this image has

19:13.420 --> 19:17.460
made it worldwide it's gonna show up in magazines here you know and think not

19:17.460 --> 19:20.980
not as an ad but just the buzz about it and Sony being a worldwide company who

19:20.980 --> 19:23.420
who does put out products here, you know.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.880
Wow, yeah, it's such a wonderful advertising campaign.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.140
Like the last one with the really annoying,

19:28.140 --> 19:31.960
sketchy squirrels and dust balls that talked about the PSP.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.500
Oh yeah, it made me wanna really go out and buy a PSP.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.700
Just like this one, this does not make me wanna go out

19:36.700 --> 19:38.060
and buy a PSP.

19:38.060 --> 19:41.420
They really need to cut off the cancerous PR department

19:41.420 --> 19:44.860
of Sony, that's what the really, the problem stems from.

19:44.860 --> 19:48.340
It's just, people that get to do the advertising

19:48.340 --> 19:49.420
are retarded.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.940
I think this advertisement's actually OK.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.420
It really doesn't bother me.

19:53.420 --> 19:55.860
And like a couple of my co-workers,

19:55.860 --> 19:57.500
when we saw that ad, the first time

19:57.500 --> 20:00.420
we just kind of looked at it not very intensely,

20:00.420 --> 20:02.780
I didn't even see the black woman there, actually.

20:02.780 --> 20:05.260
I was like, oh, a white chick advertising the PSP.

20:05.260 --> 20:07.180
What's racist about that?

20:07.180 --> 20:09.180
Oh, there's somebody else in there.

20:09.180 --> 20:12.020
Well, there's another ad, that one

20:12.020 --> 20:13.420
that they showed, which they said

20:13.420 --> 20:15.940
there was 100 different images that they have.

20:15.940 --> 20:19.180
One of them has a black chick basically kind of doing

20:19.180 --> 20:21.900
same thing to the white chick but just kind of like hold her down like they're

20:21.900 --> 20:22.780
gonna fight

20:22.780 --> 20:26.140
that's all it really kind of comes out to so very interesting and i notice in

20:26.140 --> 20:29.500
our chat room we have grin without a cat says there's other images with the black

20:29.500 --> 20:32.900
woman is the dominant one so is this a case of the media's just selectively

20:32.900 --> 20:36.460
exactly out of their images oh i see it and there's some that aren't like not

20:36.460 --> 20:40.100
even really that bad i mean so i don't understand interesting

20:40.100 --> 20:43.300
if you think the media just latched onto this one image and now it's become this big

20:43.300 --> 20:47.020
misunderstanding because they hassled newsweek and they really need something

20:47.020 --> 20:48.260
to talk about

20:48.260 --> 20:49.720
interesting perspective

20:49.720 --> 20:51.520
uh...

20:51.520 --> 20:55.220
going to the chat room funny dale says thank god sony never released the psp in

20:55.220 --> 20:56.520
yellow

20:56.520 --> 20:57.480
away

20:57.480 --> 21:02.240
i want to say stuff alright anyway that i won't all right so anyway

21:02.240 --> 21:06.400
uh... some striking imagery they're definitely uh...

21:06.400 --> 21:10.240
provoking reaction which i guess an ad campaign supposed to do but is it

21:10.240 --> 21:12.080
ethical that's the question

21:12.080 --> 21:15.000
so uh... definitely looking for your feedback we definitely want to get your

21:15.000 --> 21:16.240
feedback on this issue

21:16.240 --> 21:19.120
and we'll tell you a little more information on how you can do that a little later in the

21:19.120 --> 21:20.120
program.

21:20.120 --> 21:26.040
It wouldn't be the first time that their advertising campaigns have bombed or even

21:26.040 --> 21:28.280
the people that do their advertising for them.

21:28.280 --> 21:34.080
For example, there's been an Apple logo that's been spotted on the official Playstation

21:34.080 --> 21:37.040
3 website and people are going, what the hell is this?

21:37.040 --> 21:38.880
Why is there an Apple logo on there?

21:38.880 --> 21:44.920
Well, come to find out after people have disassembled the Flash file that was there, they found

21:44.920 --> 21:52.040
out that Sony had blatantly ripped off something that was on, I guess, Apple's site for the

21:52.040 --> 21:57.800
Apple iPod. And it actually had the logo with the smoke coming down and apparently either

21:57.800 --> 22:03.560
what the thought is that the people that are doing the advertising or the website for Sony

22:03.560 --> 22:09.520
for PlayStation 3 are the same ones that did the website for the Apple iPod and that they

22:09.520 --> 22:13.120
just kind of reuse their resources that they had for this.

22:13.120 --> 22:20.000
Well, that of course has been fixed and still no official word from Sony about what their

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
PR firm did.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.280
But it's still kind of funny seeing an Apple logo on there.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.280
And you know, I don't know.

22:26.280 --> 22:31.800
Another speculation was that they were using some Apple software, a product called Apple

22:31.800 --> 22:38.640
shake to create the file, and they were using a beta, not beta, but a demo version that

22:38.640 --> 22:41.620
wasn't allowed, you know, so it kept a watermark on there.

22:41.620 --> 22:45.380
That to me is incredibly funny, like, yeah, I'd read that theory too that they were using

22:45.380 --> 22:47.020
the trial software, that's funny.

22:47.020 --> 22:49.300
Because Sony never steals from anybody, ever.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.700
Okay, look, though, come on, I mean...

22:51.700 --> 22:54.420
It's their PR firm, I know it has nothing to do with Sony.

22:54.420 --> 22:58.380
No, no, I know it's easy to pick on Sony in this day and age after E3, but come on, I

22:58.380 --> 23:04.220
who you either have apples or pcs at your you know place of employment even sony probably

23:04.220 --> 23:10.780
but this is a computer thing is though is it's actually from you know it's it's from

23:10.780 --> 23:16.560
like an actual flash file from looks like the ipod site in fact they've disassembled

23:16.560 --> 23:19.740
it taking that part out of the background which is like the smoke effect looks like

23:19.740 --> 23:23.880
smoke dropping from the ceiling kind of rolling along the ground stuff and they've taken out

23:23.880 --> 23:29.400
and just that one section they've isolated and it's clearly stolen from something

23:29.400 --> 23:31.320
Well maybe that's just a stock effect in the program

23:31.320 --> 23:35.800
no it's something clearly stolen from something else and interesting so

23:35.800 --> 23:40.200
somebody is in trouble but it's just kind of sloppy

23:40.200 --> 23:43.960
whatever it is funny though people are speculating oh my god what if the

23:43.960 --> 23:49.240
adults and apples with no not gonna happen uh somebody in our

23:49.240 --> 23:51.400
chat room uh tiger claw reminded me of something i

23:51.400 --> 23:57.120
I was supposed to mention earlier during the last story about the ad is that control-alt-delete the comic ran a pretty funny

23:57.480 --> 23:59.480
response to the ad that had a

23:59.520 --> 24:03.880
Skinny white guy and a fat white guy and it was an ad for the DS lite get it

24:04.280 --> 24:10.800
So I thought that was pretty funny. That's creative marketing. Oh, well, that's just it was real. It's a creative response and

24:12.120 --> 24:14.120
a very interesting comic

24:14.120 --> 24:18.400
And you should get something like a DS on an operating table with like a liposuction

24:18.880 --> 24:23.780
Tube and then like that would be a good advertising campaign or like a picture of you know

24:23.780 --> 24:27.880
Oprah when she was big and Oprah when she was skinnier and I don't ever do this last weight like, you know

24:28.320 --> 24:33.540
Who a Roseanne had the surgery wouldn't we want to see someone that's nice-looking though?

24:33.720 --> 24:37.680
Or what they should have is they should have some guy dressed up in like bondage gear

24:38.120 --> 24:41.900
Bent over and have the giant PSP with like legs and arms

24:41.900 --> 24:47.120
You know rated screw them in the ass and just you know ps3. It's coming for you

24:47.120 --> 24:52.700
I don't know the PS goat see it sounds like what you're trying to sell over there. That's disgusting you make me sad ah

24:53.520 --> 24:57.060
speaking of Sony and kicking them while they're down it almost seems like

24:57.880 --> 25:00.080
It looks like Sony has been ordered to pay

25:01.100 --> 25:06.700
243 million dollars in back taxes to the Japanese government these taxes are related to

25:06.700 --> 25:11.140
transactions between the games division and the US subsidiary of the company as well as

25:11.140 --> 25:15.660
overseas transactions relating to CD and DVD making.

25:15.660 --> 25:16.840
Sony had a comment on this.

25:16.840 --> 25:20.860
Sony and SCEI believe that their allocation of income for the periods in question was

25:20.860 --> 25:25.380
appropriate and they have paid the proper amount of taxes in each of the jurisdictions.

25:25.380 --> 25:29.440
Man, these guys just aren't getting a break this year.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.660
The bad news keeps on coming.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.420
It's like beating a dead hooker over and over and over again.

25:34.420 --> 25:35.420
And that's new.

25:35.420 --> 25:36.420
Which you could do in one of their games.

25:36.420 --> 25:40.020
Exactly, but it's also on the Xbox to be fair.

25:40.020 --> 25:43.580
But anyways, that's not really the bad part about it, but analysts are saying that the

25:43.580 --> 25:51.260
PS3 could be third in the next gen console race and mainly the basis of this is that

25:51.260 --> 25:58.580
their brand strength is not enough to get people to spend the $600 on their system.

25:58.580 --> 26:05.060
And it's not like where you had the PlayStation 2 come out at a better time and for a lot

26:05.060 --> 26:11.900
less you know where's that kind of fuel the whole DVD you know launch now what

26:11.900 --> 26:16.740
nowadays it's like you know do you really need blu-ray I mean I don't know

26:16.740 --> 26:20.620
I don't he believes we do Sony would like you to think that you need only

26:20.620 --> 26:24.340
already thinks we need you and here's the thing though I mean my thought on it

26:24.340 --> 26:29.860
is blu-ray I don't need it and I don't need HD DVD either so I mean not really

26:29.860 --> 26:33.860
a fault in Sony for you know bringing on the blu-ray because you can use that for

26:33.860 --> 26:37.740
games and stuff, that's fine to have their own proprietary format for the games, so even

26:37.740 --> 26:43.160
if it doesn't work as a DVD, you know, video system or whatever, it'll still work for their

26:43.160 --> 26:44.160
games.

26:44.160 --> 26:47.620
Well, the same goes with HD DVD, I don't think I need that either, so.

26:47.620 --> 26:52.140
Yeah, I don't mind, I would benefit from an HD DVD player or even Blu-Ray, but when the

26:52.140 --> 26:55.140
price is right, and that's my issue.

26:55.140 --> 26:59.740
My issue with Sony right now is that, you know, like the name for Nintendo's new system,

26:59.740 --> 27:05.360
I've gotten almost over the fact that the only model worth getting is the $600 one.

27:05.360 --> 27:10.420
They just haven't shown anything that's going to be out anytime soon that looks even remotely

27:10.420 --> 27:11.420
interesting.

27:11.420 --> 27:14.380
I just look at the launch list and I'm like, so what?

27:14.380 --> 27:17.860
And in fact, there was like a game like, for example, I was like, ooh, Full Auto 2, ooh,

27:17.860 --> 27:22.060
I got a, you know, that's a really good, you know, I love Full Auto, you know, almost,

27:22.060 --> 27:23.580
you know, maybe I should get the system for that.

27:23.580 --> 27:26.660
Oh wait, Full Auto 2 is coming out for the Xbox 360 later on.

27:26.660 --> 27:29.100
Okay, well I don't need to get the system.

27:29.100 --> 27:30.760
You know, what do they have that's exclusive?

27:30.760 --> 27:31.760
Motorstorm?

27:31.760 --> 27:32.760
Meh.

27:32.760 --> 27:33.760
Lame.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.900
Maybe they'll have Fantavision 2 and then I'll actually have a review of it.

27:35.900 --> 27:38.700
Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy 13.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.700
Are they going to be launched?

27:39.700 --> 27:41.580
No, but they're great.

27:41.580 --> 27:43.900
I'm just saying you will have to get a PS3 eventually if you want to play this game.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.900
When it goes down in price.

27:45.900 --> 27:46.900
You hope.

27:46.900 --> 27:50.380
Xbox 360's been out a year and hasn't gone out and down in price.

27:50.380 --> 27:53.780
You know, I don't think that it's going to drop in price anytime soon, and you know,

27:53.780 --> 27:56.980
until there's some better games out there, I'm not buying one.

27:56.980 --> 27:57.980
But you know what?

27:57.980 --> 28:02.580
I mean, they could totally pull it out and say, you know, they could have some big secret

28:02.580 --> 28:05.660
stuff that they're not talking about and that would be, you know, really amazing.

28:05.660 --> 28:08.620
Well it ain't the Eye of Judgment.

28:08.620 --> 28:09.620
That is the worst idea.

28:09.620 --> 28:10.620
I don't...

28:10.620 --> 28:11.620
It was that card game, right?

28:11.620 --> 28:12.620
It's not...

28:12.620 --> 28:13.620
Yeah, it's the card game.

28:13.620 --> 28:14.620
Here's the thing about the Eye of Judgment.

28:14.620 --> 28:18.180
I don't know how the hell they're going to execute this because, to be honest, the eye

28:18.180 --> 28:23.980
toy sucks for, you know, that type of gameplay and the way that they're set up and they have

28:23.980 --> 28:29.080
this like really elaborate like frame that this camera was in I don't see how

28:29.080 --> 28:33.520
it's gonna be possible to do this even reasonably why you would want to do this

28:33.520 --> 28:37.840
in the first place it just it was a great idea like as it like a proof of

28:37.840 --> 28:42.400
concept thing but as a game I don't see it happening I don't I don't get how

28:42.400 --> 28:45.340
they're gonna do it a chat room wanted to correct me on something Xbox 360 is

28:45.340 --> 28:49.520
actually only been out nine months not a year but the price okay well the price

28:49.520 --> 28:53.960
isn't gonna drop by November either so we don't I mean as far as we know it's

28:53.960 --> 29:00.960
The only reason it would have had to is if PS3 announced it was coming out for $4.99

29:00.960 --> 29:03.800
or $3.99, whatever the Xbox 360 is.

29:03.800 --> 29:07.640
I don't think they're not going to drop the price of the 360.

29:07.640 --> 29:14.320
If anything, they may drop it later, like once the first quarter comes around next year,

29:14.320 --> 29:18.360
but they might drop the price of the Xbox.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.240
Banda makes an interesting comment in her chat room.

29:20.240 --> 29:24.240
I want a PS3 for the games too, but Sony doesn't want to make a console just for games.

29:24.240 --> 29:29.680
If it weren't for that damn Blu-ray crap, I like, um, the PS3 is gonna be sold more

29:29.680 --> 29:34.800
as your living room centerpiece, you know, it's your movie, game, internet, picture,

29:34.800 --> 29:35.800
I don't know, system.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.720
Do you think that's gonna win Sony any points from people, or?

29:38.720 --> 29:39.720
No.

29:39.720 --> 29:40.720
Not at all.

29:40.720 --> 29:41.720
Wow.

29:41.720 --> 29:42.720
Okay.

29:42.720 --> 29:45.160
Well, here's the thing, I mean, look, I have a PSP as well, and what do I use it for?

29:45.160 --> 29:46.480
I use it for games.

29:46.480 --> 29:50.300
I don't... I don't have any pictures on it. I don't have any

29:50.300 --> 29:53.760
movies on it. Okay, but I've heard from listeners who download our show on

29:53.760 --> 29:57.520
their PSP. We have the PSP websites which are pretty kick-butt, so

29:57.520 --> 30:00.920
some people out there are getting used to some of the other functions of the PSP.

30:00.920 --> 30:05.440
I like the web stuff on the PSP. You know what's funny too about the whole PS3 thing?

30:05.440 --> 30:08.160
It's still floating around out there that they're saying that

30:08.160 --> 30:11.200
you know it's possible that Sony may do that

30:11.200 --> 30:16.080
you know thing to eliminate used game sales. You know, where they're gonna make a picture.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.080
I don't buy it.

30:17.080 --> 30:21.280
Well, they're trying to push really for digital distribution and I really think they're trying

30:21.280 --> 30:26.820
it out with this PSP emulation thing and if it works well for that, they're going to move

30:26.820 --> 30:27.820
it to the...

30:27.820 --> 30:30.920
I bet you actually that's probably going to be on the PS3 when that comes out.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.680
All right, let's keep it moving here.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.080
I want to talk about this on the PSP.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.200
I think it's actually a pretty cool idea here.

30:37.200 --> 30:44.320
This was a story that ran on Kotaku, a graduate student, Jonas Heilscher, put together this

30:44.320 --> 30:49.000
interesting piece that he put on YouTube that is this game where you go around

30:49.000 --> 30:53.620
and you're looking for access points and as you collect the access points you get

30:53.620 --> 30:58.780
a distinct color shape or sound based based on whatever that MAC address is of

30:58.780 --> 31:02.740
the point that you find and what you do is you fill this three by three grid

31:02.740 --> 31:07.720
with shapes trying to get three in a row as you find the points now if you ever

31:07.720 --> 31:12.220
get an unsecure access point though it might wipe the grid clean or act as a

31:12.220 --> 31:15.820
wild card. So basically the game encourages you to

31:15.820 --> 31:19.380
get out and walk, which I think is a neat idea.

31:19.380 --> 31:22.660
But that's kind of a cool concept for a game. I mean it's just

31:22.660 --> 31:26.380
it's nothing that I don't think would ever be sold, but you know, it's a cute tech demo

31:26.380 --> 31:26.940
idea.

31:26.940 --> 31:30.300
Well, that reminds me of like when they were going to release a GPS thing.

31:30.300 --> 31:35.220
Yeah, geocaching. It made me think of that too. That would be a great idea for the PSP. I think that would be a

31:35.220 --> 31:36.060
lot of fun.

31:36.060 --> 31:39.300
Like, can you imagine like, okay, this might sound really cheesy, but like take like one of

31:39.300 --> 31:41.740
those TV shows like Treasure Hunters The Game

31:41.740 --> 31:45.060
or something that could rely on geocaching, not that you would really

31:45.060 --> 31:48.360
travel around the world for real, but maybe something that interacts with the

31:48.360 --> 31:49.900
geocache to kind of

31:49.900 --> 31:54.140
encourage people to go outside and use their PSPs and kind of

31:54.140 --> 31:56.100
interact in a whole different way.

31:56.100 --> 31:58.960
I think that would be a neat idea. But the screen sucks outside,

31:58.960 --> 32:03.060
I think. Yeah, that's a good point. The LCD screens really do suck. Can't you get

32:03.060 --> 32:07.540
something, though, that kind of helps that? An umbrella?

32:07.540 --> 32:11.220
Well, if you design the lighting and everything correctly, it might

32:11.220 --> 32:17.220
work okay. It does require firmware 2.0 to play, and they do plan on putting it on their

32:17.220 --> 32:22.460
site in the near future. It's pixel6.org, so check it out. The name of the game is Colectic.

32:22.460 --> 32:27.740
So that's actually pretty cool. And, you know, kind of, you know, back to what we were talking

32:27.740 --> 32:36.340
about before, both Sega and Ubisoft want the PSP, or not the PSP, the PS3 to drop in price.

32:36.340 --> 32:43.500
They're basically saying that it's too expensive and they're worried that because it is so

32:43.500 --> 32:48.760
expensive that it might not be competitive enough with the Xbox 360 and not as many units

32:48.760 --> 32:49.760
may sell.

32:49.760 --> 32:53.960
And of course that affects them, especially when they're releasing games on those consoles

32:53.960 --> 33:01.360
because they're unable to make as many or sell as many on that system.

33:01.360 --> 33:05.480
I think that's a shared sentiment from everybody that they want the price to drop.

33:05.480 --> 33:11.520
um, crazy Sony guy, I forget his name, Kaz Harai or whatever, didn't he say that he's

33:11.520 --> 33:16.040
not even guaranteeing that the price of games would be $59.99 or whatever?

33:16.040 --> 33:18.300
Yeah, yeah, he's saying it could be more.

33:18.300 --> 33:22.600
It could be, but uh, you know, that's not a good way to sell your console.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.600
Let them worry about that later.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.480
It's not a console, it's a media center.

33:25.480 --> 33:30.600
Oh, I'm sorry, but um, yeah, so, interesting.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.380
Alright, let's switch consoles for a minute here.

33:33.380 --> 33:35.360
Let's go over and talk about the Nintendo Wii.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.260
This shouldn't be a surprise to anybody.

33:37.260 --> 33:41.160
A lot of people like to joke about the power brick that comes with the Xbox 360, because

33:41.160 --> 33:42.160
that thing is huge.

33:42.160 --> 33:47.640
Well, pictures have leaked of the Wii's power supply, and it's not so big.

33:47.640 --> 33:50.280
But it's about the size of the GameCube power supply.

33:50.280 --> 33:55.800
But honestly, is this a huge surprise, considering that the Wii is not going to be running on

33:55.800 --> 33:58.160
nearly the same type of hardware as the Xbox 360?

33:58.160 --> 34:03.400
I wouldn't be surprised if it was running on the same power supply as the GameCube.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.400
Mmm, interesting thought

34:06.000 --> 34:10.960
Except it's you know, it's a different color because you know, they didn't have white, but it's just like, you know, it's just like the

34:11.640 --> 34:16.220
Was it the PlayStation 2 how you can use all the audio cables and video cables with?

34:16.860 --> 34:20.140
The PlayStation 1 hell those Nintendo cables you can use

34:20.140 --> 34:26.400
I think it's the same cables for Super Nintendo all the way through GameCube. You can use that same AV thing. Yeah

34:26.400 --> 34:28.960
Yeah, that's pretty cool. That's the way to do it. I think

34:29.620 --> 34:31.580
Well, I mean, it's just an AV cable

34:31.580 --> 34:34.220
I mean that that kind of technology doesn't change

34:34.220 --> 34:39.460
But what is interesting is even though we know that the Wii is not going to support high def

34:40.380 --> 34:43.900
720 or whatever maybe they'll still release you know

34:45.700 --> 34:47.300
Red green blue

34:47.300 --> 34:50.620
Progressive yeah, well what it component. Thank you component

34:50.620 --> 34:55.060
Maybe they'll still release component cables isn't gamecube for a little while have component cables well

34:55.060 --> 35:00.520
They're just really hard to come by even on the Xbox remember the Xbox some of the games were actually 720p very few

35:00.520 --> 35:07.400
Very few, but still, I mean, I would like to see, you know, sure their focus is not

35:07.400 --> 35:11.980
going to be high def, but if someone wants to do a high def game, to maybe allow some

35:11.980 --> 35:13.120
way to do that.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.520
I think that would be kind of cool.

35:14.520 --> 35:15.520
I don't know.

35:15.520 --> 35:21.720
Because I remember some of the games for the GameCube were progressive scan as well, so.

35:21.720 --> 35:26.640
Very, yeah, well, you had a few that were widescreen at least, like F-Zero is pretty

35:26.640 --> 35:27.640
kick ass.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.960
Yeah, so I don't know, I think...

35:29.960 --> 35:34.160
But it's not, because I don't have component cables for the GameCube, because they're so

35:34.160 --> 35:36.080
freaking hard to find, I still don't have them.

35:36.080 --> 35:39.400
I have a digital out on the GameCube, but I just don't have those cables.

35:39.400 --> 35:46.800
You know, F-Zero just doesn't look as good as, you know, even an Xbox game that did have

35:46.800 --> 35:49.920
the component cables, so, I don't know.

35:49.920 --> 35:56.320
Alright, speaking of Nintendo, there was announcements made about their brand new line of games that's

35:56.320 --> 36:02.400
going to be coming out. Kind of like the Touch Generations whereas those were not really

36:02.400 --> 36:07.480
games per say but more of kind of for everybody type stuff. You know where Nintendogs and

36:07.480 --> 36:13.320
Brain Training etc. Well now they have a brand new lineup called Bit Generations and these

36:13.320 --> 36:20.840
actually look pretty sweet. Included in that are going to be puzzle and rhythm games designed

36:20.840 --> 36:30.180
for the Game Boy Advance, including Dotstream, Boldish, Dialex, Digidrive, Orbital, Coloris,

36:30.180 --> 36:31.180
and Sound Voyager.

36:31.180 --> 36:35.760
And they're all really simple looking games, but they all look really cool actually and

36:35.760 --> 36:38.020
pretty fun to play.

36:38.020 --> 36:44.920
And they're going to be for about $25 an American and will ship in the second and fourth weeks

36:44.920 --> 36:48.220
in July in Japan.

36:48.220 --> 36:52.500
Some other new games are coming out for the DS, not just the DS but the PSP, and they're

36:52.500 --> 36:55.280
coming from one of my favorite developers, Q Entertainment.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.180
You know I love Luminous and Meteos, those are two of my favorite games that came out

36:58.180 --> 36:59.180
last year.

36:59.180 --> 37:02.040
Well, there are new games coming out, and I'm not talking about Luminous 2 or every

37:02.040 --> 37:04.580
Xtend Xtra, I'm talking about some other stuff.

37:04.580 --> 37:09.100
Famitsu Magazine is reporting that Bandai Namco is going to be publishing two new Q

37:09.100 --> 37:10.100
Entertainment games.

37:10.100 --> 37:15.340
One is going to be out for the PSP, and it's called Gun PR, it's short for Gun P Reverse,

37:15.340 --> 37:20.980
The DS is going to get a game that translates to the name Connect the Sounds Gunpee Reverse.

37:20.980 --> 37:27.420
Both are music-based puzzle games and they're based on a 1999 WonderSwan game called Gunpee.

37:27.420 --> 37:29.960
Too bad Jamie's not here because she'd probably actually know that one because I never owned

37:29.960 --> 37:30.960
a WonderSwan but she did.

37:30.960 --> 37:36.520
I do have a WonderSwan thanks to a gracious listener but I have one game for it.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.060
I don't really play a lot of WonderSwan games.

37:39.060 --> 37:42.200
Maybe I should check this one out though.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.900
for those that haven't played it, it's got square pieces and they all have a diagonal

37:45.900 --> 37:49.280
line and it rises from the bottom of the screen to the top.

37:49.280 --> 37:54.440
You move the pieces up and down, trying to get a line going from left to right.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.980
The panels will then disappear if you do this.

37:56.980 --> 38:00.860
The game ends early if the pieces get to the top of the field.

38:00.860 --> 38:06.060
On the PSP version, there will be emphasis on music and video, kind of like Luminous,

38:06.060 --> 38:11.340
it had skins but on the DS it's going to be more you know stylus emphasized and

38:11.340 --> 38:15.580
as a little as opposed to having the skins however the game will still make

38:15.580 --> 38:19.260
sounds when you clear panel and it'll try to line up the sounds of the

38:19.260 --> 38:23.460
background music so that should be interesting it sounds a lot like that

38:23.460 --> 38:29.860
game it's a pop cap game it's the fireworks with the it's like a festival

38:29.860 --> 38:33.340
game with the fireworks I can't remember the name of it now I'm sure someone

38:33.340 --> 38:38.060
No idea. I'm sure someone in chat has it. It's a little different though. You turn these,

38:38.060 --> 38:41.180
but you're trying to line things up from left to right, and when you do that these fireworks

38:41.180 --> 38:46.060
go off and you get points. Well that might be a cheesy game. It might be a cool game for

38:46.060 --> 38:55.420
our latest Nintendo DS owner here. President Bush was actually given a Nintendo DS and brain training

38:55.420 --> 39:01.820
for his 60th birthday. I wonder what Nintendo's trying to tell him. That he's stupid. And they

39:01.820 --> 39:08.720
attached the letter to it and says don't worry turning 60 is an exciting milestone as you know you've joined the millions of

39:09.000 --> 39:11.340
other baby boomers in an

39:12.000 --> 39:17.720
Invigorating new decade of your life and like many boomers you may be looking for ways to keep your mind sharp

39:18.080 --> 39:20.080
That's where we come in

39:20.400 --> 39:27.020
Please accept our gift of a new Nintendo DS light and a copy of brain age train your brain in minutes a day

39:27.020 --> 39:29.320
And what do you think actually ended up happening to that?

39:29.320 --> 39:34.440
that. Threw it away. It probably went to somebody else. Well maybe he gave it to one of his

39:34.440 --> 39:40.560
daughters or something. I don't know. You'd think maybe he'd try it once. He might. He's

39:40.560 --> 39:44.360
you know a normal guy despite you know the fact I disagree with the politics or whatever

39:44.360 --> 39:48.200
he seems to be a normal guy. Well he has a lot of time on. Maybe he'll check it out.

39:48.200 --> 39:52.520
Something to do on Air Force One I don't know. Alright who knows. It's actually a super secret

39:52.520 --> 39:56.720
spy device to find out what's going on. Jeremy Todd One in our chat room seems to think President

39:56.720 --> 39:59.560
Bush probably won't even be able to turn the damn DS Lite on.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.920
Hahaha, that's true.

40:00.920 --> 40:01.920
You guys are harsh.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.720
I don't get these fangled computer things, heh heh heh.

40:05.720 --> 40:10.440
Alright, now if you are craving for some new games, we have some release dates for you,

40:10.440 --> 40:14.000
and I'm gonna start it off, I know Jamie's not here tonight, but I don't want to neglect

40:14.000 --> 40:17.640
the UK audience, because we have some awesome UK listeners.

40:17.640 --> 40:21.000
You know, I think next year, I know I keep saying I want to go to Australia, but I'm

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
torn.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.120
I either want to go to Australia or I want to go to the UK, one of the two.

40:24.120 --> 40:27.520
So I'll probably do one next year and then one the year after that, and that's assuming

40:27.520 --> 40:29.600
I'm rich.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.600
So we'll see.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.560
Anyway, here's some release dates here for the UK.

40:33.560 --> 40:37.560
You guys have coming out on the 14th, you have Cars coming out on some various platforms,

40:37.560 --> 40:43.600
everything from GameCube, PS2, and Xbox, all the way to PC and portable platforms as well.

40:43.600 --> 40:47.800
Also coming out, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Legend of Jack Sparrow on PC and PlayStation

40:47.800 --> 40:48.800
2.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.680
And of course, again, a lot of people are looking forward to Prey coming out on the

40:51.680 --> 40:54.680
the PC and the Xbox 360 from 2K Games.

40:54.680 --> 40:58.480
If you like Dragon Ball, you have Super Dragon Ball Z coming out on the PlayStation 2 from

40:58.480 --> 41:03.520
Atari, and The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle Earth 2 is coming out on the Xbox

41:03.520 --> 41:04.520
360.

41:04.520 --> 41:08.360
Looking ahead a little bit to the week of the 21st, you guys are getting in the UK Def

41:08.360 --> 41:14.520
Jam Fight for New York, the takeover on the PSP, Infected on the PSP, and Field Commander

41:14.520 --> 41:16.480
on the PSP from Ubisoft.

41:16.480 --> 41:19.840
Also coming out for the PlayStation 2, World Super Police.

41:19.840 --> 41:21.640
week next week in the UK for Sony.

41:21.640 --> 41:26.040
Yeah, lots of stuff for the US too, especially if you have a 360.

41:26.040 --> 41:29.800
You're going to be getting Prey, of course, awesome game.

41:29.800 --> 41:36.500
ChromeHounds, also on the 360, and then finally, if you don't have a 360, they have Sprint

41:36.500 --> 41:41.280
Cars or the Knoxville, which is, I don't know, a game you probably won't want to pick up.

41:41.280 --> 41:47.080
Of course, the following week, you've got, you know, lots of stuff, NCA Football 2007,

41:47.080 --> 41:52.900
Of course on Playstation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360 and PSP, if you're a football fan.

41:52.900 --> 41:58.940
Monster House, you know, that coincided with the movie release on Playstation 2 and GameCube.

41:58.940 --> 42:02.520
Super Dragon Ball Z on the Playstation 2.

42:02.520 --> 42:06.440
Let's see, Painkiller on the Xbox.

42:06.440 --> 42:12.200
And of course, what was it, Xenide on the Xbox.

42:12.200 --> 42:17.000
And it's kind of a cool little shooter game, kind of reminds me of, I don't know, just

42:17.000 --> 42:22.600
It's kind of one of the Japanese shooter games, kind of like Raiden 3 or something.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.180
So lots of cool stuff.

42:25.180 --> 42:30.680
But anyways, beyond all that, we're going to be getting some new stuff, including brand

42:30.680 --> 42:34.360
new Xbox 360 face plates.

42:34.360 --> 42:35.360
It's about time.

42:35.360 --> 42:38.540
You heard it here first guys.

42:38.540 --> 42:44.520
This came straight through my work, because Microsoft is wanting to know how many we need.

42:44.520 --> 42:51.280
The brand new faceplates, I'm going to be starting off with Forza 2, a faceplate designed

42:51.280 --> 42:57.680
specifically for that game, Halo 3, or at least a Halo faceplate is going to be coming

42:57.680 --> 42:59.400
out here, as well as...

42:59.400 --> 43:02.160
In other words, it's just Halo graphics with a number 3 on it.

43:02.160 --> 43:04.920
It doesn't actually say Halo 3 or have the graphics on it, but...

43:04.920 --> 43:09.960
It seems a little early for a Halo 3, but when you consider that Halo 2 is still, you

43:09.960 --> 43:15.280
look at major nelson rankings it's still the number one xbox live game i mean obviously

43:15.280 --> 43:20.080
there's going to be demand for a halo type faceplate exactly and it it's pretty cool

43:20.080 --> 43:25.160
looking and then finally i don't know if you can be excited about this but um these are

43:25.160 --> 43:30.560
pinata boy they're really whoring that franchise they really want that to work don't they hate

43:30.560 --> 43:36.600
that franchise it's kind of like the snakes on the plane thing for me um also there was

43:36.600 --> 43:40.680
a new Wii game announced and I don't know if you're going to be excited by this because

43:40.680 --> 43:45.420
I played the Playstation 2 version of it and I didn't like it too much, but Rampage World

43:45.420 --> 43:48.600
Tour or Total Destruction I mean is going to be...

43:48.600 --> 43:49.600
Where'd you hear that?

43:49.600 --> 43:50.600
Is that another thing?

43:50.600 --> 43:51.600
It's through my work, yeah.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.560
That seems like an odd release, you're right.

43:53.560 --> 43:54.560
That game seems a little dated.

43:54.560 --> 43:57.620
Rampage Total Destruction is going to be coming out on the Wii.

43:57.620 --> 43:58.620
It's going to be $29.99.

43:58.620 --> 44:02.120
Are they going to announce it at all you think?

44:02.120 --> 44:03.120
Probably not.

44:03.120 --> 44:04.120
Not for $29.99.

44:04.120 --> 44:09.260
It's supposed to be out in December and I don't know it I

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
Didn't like the PlayStation 2 game. I thought that it was very unbalanced and just not very fun to play

44:15.000 --> 44:21.420
But hey, you know what? It's just another game for us. So expect that out in December. All right, any other release date news?

44:22.320 --> 44:29.240
I think that's all I got. That's brand new. But yeah, lots of ps3 games coming. That's for sure. Oh

44:29.240 --> 44:32.520
Oh, it looks like we're getting a call on the Skypline.

44:32.520 --> 44:34.480
Let's go to the Skypline and see who's there.

44:34.480 --> 44:35.480
Hello?

44:35.480 --> 44:36.480
Hello.

44:36.480 --> 44:37.480
Hey, Jamie.

44:37.480 --> 44:38.480
Is that you?

44:38.480 --> 44:39.480
Yeah.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.480
Where are you at?

44:40.480 --> 44:41.480
San Jose.

44:41.480 --> 44:42.480
San Jose.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.480
What's going on in San Jose today?

44:43.480 --> 44:44.480
California Extreme.

44:44.480 --> 44:49.720
It's a big coin-op and pinball convention thing.

44:49.720 --> 44:50.720
I see.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.440
Pinball's there, so that's why you're there, huh?

44:52.440 --> 44:53.440
Yeah.

44:53.440 --> 44:56.400
The husband kidnapped me, but I figured it's good stuff for Orange Lounge.

44:56.400 --> 44:57.400
Yeah.

44:57.400 --> 44:58.400
What's going on down there?

44:58.400 --> 45:01.080
checking out there. Just a bunch of arcade games or what's the deal?

45:01.080 --> 45:04.840
Pretty much old games, new games. They have Mambo and Go Go.

45:04.840 --> 45:08.080
They have actually Hip Hop Mania 2.

45:08.080 --> 45:13.440
There's a couple of DDRs. There's a couple of prototype pinballs that I got to play.

45:13.440 --> 45:18.080
One of them is Kingpin and the other one is Big Bang Bar which our old listeners will know that I've

45:18.080 --> 45:19.360
been into that one for a while.

45:19.360 --> 45:22.520
What exactly do they do at this show? Is this just everybody brings their games

45:22.520 --> 45:25.720
out and people play them or is it trying to sell machines or what are they doing there?

45:25.720 --> 45:29.120
you bring three games you're in as an exhibitor you get in for free

45:29.120 --> 45:34.320
other than that you pay a decent amount to get in like we paid

45:34.320 --> 45:39.120
thirty dollars each just for Saturday. And what do they do? They just let you play games all day?

45:39.120 --> 45:44.240
Pretty much. And there's other little panels going on and different things like that

45:44.240 --> 45:48.120
but really I'm just following all the games around. They actually have

45:48.120 --> 45:52.280
a marquee for a Hercules game which was Atari's biggest pinball machine.

45:52.280 --> 45:57.280
What are some interesting games that you've actually got a chance to play today?

45:57.280 --> 45:58.280
Big Bang Bar.

45:58.280 --> 46:04.280
I just got my butt handed to me on Black Knight 2000, which is one of my favorite machines ever.

46:04.280 --> 46:08.280
I damn played Arabian Nights, which I thought was pretty cool.

46:08.280 --> 46:15.280
It's got a genie and you hit the lamp and it turns around and you get a different score and everything.

46:15.280 --> 46:19.280
I actually did play some Beat Mania. I couldn't help myself.

46:19.280 --> 46:25.920
I'm mainly just walking around taking pictures for the first part of it, but I'm actually

46:25.920 --> 46:26.920
going to go back in and play things.

46:26.920 --> 46:28.920
There are a few things I want to try.

46:28.920 --> 46:36.600
I also do have some video footage of some of the more rare games too, there's a Tapper

46:36.600 --> 46:37.600
there.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.600
Oh, like root beer tapper?

46:39.600 --> 46:40.600
No, tapper.

46:40.600 --> 46:42.600
Oh, like Budweiser tapper?

46:42.600 --> 46:43.600
Like beer.

46:43.600 --> 46:46.600
That's awesome, because I love Budweiser tapper.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.600
They have a pouillon machine.

46:48.600 --> 46:49.600
Oh, I remember pouillon.

46:49.600 --> 46:52.600
I haven't seen one like this in a long time.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.600
Wow, I was like, yeah, I had that on the Commodore 64.

46:54.600 --> 46:55.600
That's awesome.

46:55.600 --> 46:58.600
They also have the Ultra Kid cocktail machines.

46:58.600 --> 47:01.600
Oh, like the sit down and play?

47:01.600 --> 47:02.600
Yeah, well, the bar top.

47:02.600 --> 47:03.600
Huh.

47:03.600 --> 47:04.600
That's cool.

47:04.600 --> 47:06.600
They have a few of the tables.

47:06.600 --> 47:13.600
They actually have the little boxing game which is like you look down inside of it and

47:13.600 --> 47:16.720
you see from the top you have two boxers and they also actually have the mechanical boxing

47:16.720 --> 47:17.720
game.

47:17.720 --> 47:27.520
Iím going to play a lot more Black Knight 2000 and a lot more Big Bing Bar and hopefully

47:27.520 --> 47:32.400
I can run into some of the people who own these machines and ask them about their maintenance

47:32.400 --> 47:33.400
and what theyíve gone into.

47:33.400 --> 47:35.400
Is this something they do every year?

47:35.400 --> 47:42.400
Yeah, they do this every year. In fact, last year, not last year, but the year before that, we tried to go to

47:42.400 --> 47:49.400
Classic Gaming Expo and it was really, really slow because this had just finished the week before and nobody wanted to bring their machines back.

47:49.400 --> 47:55.400
Oh, interesting. So you got a lot of stuff from classic stuff to new stuff. Do you see a lot of new stuff there?

47:55.400 --> 48:05.240
Thereís the grid, it was there, DDR, there was a solo, there was a Mambo Go Go, there

48:05.240 --> 48:11.280
was Soul Calibur 3 arcade or anything, they donít have anything super new there.

48:11.280 --> 48:24.480
Nothing really really new, but there was a Silent Scope EX, and just a few of the newer

48:24.480 --> 48:31.360
machines that most of it's like late 80s early 90s there are a few pins from

48:31.360 --> 48:35.940
like the 40s and 50s so is this something where people go to buy

48:35.940 --> 48:39.480
machines from private place it's like a it's this isn't something where they're

48:39.480 --> 48:43.120
selling to arcades is something where they're selling to hardcore collectors

48:43.120 --> 48:46.680
with lots of money right they're selling to collectors and not everything is

48:46.680 --> 48:51.840
really expensive but that hip-hop mania machine I was playing yeah 400 bucks hmm

48:51.840 --> 48:56.920
It's in great condition, much better than Golf Lands ever was.

48:56.920 --> 49:04.640
We didn't bring a truck or anything, so that's debatable, but we went over that

49:04.640 --> 49:09.360
hip-hop mania and he's been drooling over some of the prototypes.

49:09.360 --> 49:13.760
That Big Bang bar that we were looking at, we sort of talked just back and forth as we

49:13.760 --> 49:15.760
had the $10,000 to blow on it.

49:15.760 --> 49:20.260
Wow, why don't you give me the $10,000 I'll make good use of it.

49:20.260 --> 49:23.960
Well, the reason why is that there's only 16 of those machines in existence.

49:23.960 --> 49:25.960
Oh my gosh, wow, wow.

49:25.960 --> 49:28.360
Yeah, that's why it was a big deal for me to play one.

49:28.360 --> 49:30.860
Anything else you want to share about the show with the listeners and anything?

49:30.860 --> 49:35.260
I'm still going tomorrow. If anyone's in the Bay Area or nearby, come check it out.

49:35.260 --> 49:35.960
It's worth it.

49:35.960 --> 49:39.860
Alright, very cool. So, what's the name of the show again? Do they have a website?

49:39.860 --> 49:44.860
California Extremes go to... actually you can just do a Google hunt for it or

49:44.860 --> 49:48.220
It's CAXtreme.com, I think, or.org.

49:48.220 --> 49:49.900
Okay, very cool.

49:49.900 --> 49:51.740
All right, well, thanks for calling in.

49:51.740 --> 49:53.420
We miss you, and we'll see you next week, okay?

49:54.140 --> 49:54.540
Okay.

49:54.540 --> 49:55.180
All right, later.

49:56.220 --> 49:59.660
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, Jamie, the chat room said hi.

49:59.660 --> 50:00.540
But anyways...

50:00.540 --> 50:02.380
Well, after I hang up on her, thank you.

50:02.380 --> 50:03.100
Well, sorry.

50:04.060 --> 50:05.180
I'll send her a text.

50:05.180 --> 50:05.900
Sorry, Tara.

50:05.900 --> 50:07.980
But, you know, I want to play arcade games.

50:08.540 --> 50:09.020
I know!

50:09.020 --> 50:09.980
Why did she get to go?

50:09.980 --> 50:11.100
I want to go.

50:11.100 --> 50:12.140
Almost as fun, I guess.

50:12.140 --> 50:18.020
But uh, well that makes me angry that we're not there. So you know what that means? I don't care if she's not here

50:18.020 --> 50:20.020
We're taking her segment. Hell yeah

50:28.500 --> 50:30.500
Why don't you start us off Logie?

50:30.780 --> 50:35.140
Fuck you to stupid people who can't park correctly and I'm sorry

50:35.140 --> 50:37.620
This also kind of goes to Christopher Exeter

50:37.620 --> 50:42.360
He parked like a bitch taking up two goddamn spaces with his car

50:42.400 --> 50:48.700
We saw a woman last night driving a stupid minivan parks in like four spaces. There's walks right out

50:49.220 --> 50:54.900
Dumb bitches from Alaska though. I don't know if that makes a difference doesn't but you know still that kind of stare

50:54.900 --> 50:56.660
They're like you're an idiot goddamn

50:56.660 --> 50:58.940
I mean, I understand there's not a lot of people in the parking lot

50:58.940 --> 51:03.980
But when you take up four spaces because you're too fucking lazy that you park correctly. I

51:03.980 --> 51:08.940
I hate people like that and I'm sorry it always seems to be women in cars.

51:08.940 --> 51:13.340
But then again you get punk ass bitches who drive their fucking giant trucks that take

51:13.340 --> 51:15.300
up six spaces too.

51:15.300 --> 51:20.540
Or the ones that park with a goddamn U-Haul or some sort of trailer on there and they

51:20.540 --> 51:24.180
take up six spaces because they park across all of them.

51:24.180 --> 51:28.220
Fuck you, you do not need to be going to the movies if you have a goddamn trailer on your

51:28.220 --> 51:29.220
truck.

51:29.220 --> 51:32.300
So just leave it at home.

51:32.300 --> 51:37.040
I'd like to give an F.U. for what I believe is the second week in a row to the sun.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.900
You might remember last week on the show I had a sunburn, well guess what, when I was

51:39.900 --> 51:43.980
in Canada, I went to Canada with my best friend, that's where I was on vacation, why I wasn't

51:43.980 --> 51:49.060
here on Sunday, and we decided one day randomly we were just going to walk, we were going

51:49.060 --> 51:52.580
to walk across this bridge, Burrard Bridge, because somebody had told us it was fun, so

51:52.580 --> 51:55.700
we walked across, ate some lunch, and we walked back and we were like, let's just keep on

51:55.700 --> 51:56.700
walking.

51:56.700 --> 52:01.060
So we walked all the way to this place called Stanley Park, which is this huge park in Vancouver

52:01.060 --> 52:07.380
That's bigger than Central Park, and we walk the entire perimeter of Stanley Park now this whole time

52:07.380 --> 52:09.900
I'm worried that I might get a sunburn again, so I'm asking my friend John

52:09.900 --> 52:13.360
I'm like do it do I have my training colors my training things like no you look fine look fine

52:13.460 --> 52:15.600
Well, we get back to the hotel after this walk

52:15.600 --> 52:20.640
Which you know the perimeter Stanley Park is 10 kilometers so add into that all the other walking

52:20.640 --> 52:23.480
We did we probably walked more like 10 miles by the time all is said and done

52:23.760 --> 52:27.520
And then we get back to the hotel room, and I'm bright pink. I'm like John

52:27.520 --> 52:29.480
I'm bright things like you didn't look pink earlier

52:29.480 --> 52:31.760
and I'm getting redder and redder and redder.

52:31.760 --> 52:33.800
Oh my god, I had the world's worst sunburn,

52:33.800 --> 52:34.880
it was horrible.

52:34.880 --> 52:37.540
But, and I know this isn't more of an F-you,

52:37.540 --> 52:41.040
but I will say a big thank you to Canada's pharmacies

52:41.040 --> 52:42.760
because they sell certain drugs in Canada

52:42.760 --> 52:43.920
you can't get here in the US,

52:43.920 --> 52:47.040
and one of them is aloe vera gel with lidocaine in it,

52:47.040 --> 52:48.400
which is like numbing stuff

52:48.400 --> 52:50.680
that you have to get with prescription here.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.840
Made my sunburn feel much more bearable,

52:52.840 --> 52:54.920
but still, I had to miss Saturday night clubbing,

52:54.920 --> 52:55.960
so I was upset with that.

52:55.960 --> 52:58.520
Otherwise, I love Canada, I love it.

52:58.520 --> 53:03.780
I love Vancouver and I want to go back and yeah but I wish I just had more money to travel

53:03.780 --> 53:08.700
maybe I'll just move there I'll ditch this show and move to Canada I'll be fun Shane

53:08.700 --> 53:16.700
do you have any angst you want to get out um no I don't think I'm angry about anything

53:16.700 --> 53:25.760
right now all right well then F you for not being angsty F you to me for not being angsty

53:25.760 --> 53:29.240
moving on with

53:29.240 --> 53:33.960
some more news back into the gaming news the Final Fantasy 3 DS

53:33.960 --> 53:37.320
Wi-Fi feature may have been revealed and it's

53:37.320 --> 53:40.440
emailing. It comes from a screenshot from

53:40.440 --> 53:44.360
JUMP which is a Japanese magazine it looks like Final Fantasy 3 on the DS is

53:44.360 --> 53:46.760
gonna make use of the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection but

53:46.760 --> 53:50.560
basically you're gonna send letters to each other friends back and forth and if

53:50.560 --> 53:52.120
you exchange the emails

53:52.120 --> 53:55.240
it will trigger special events in the game

53:55.240 --> 54:00.040
I guess that's better than nothing but at the same time where's like one-on-one battle

54:00.040 --> 54:07.100
or adventure the world with friends or something a little more maybe now to be fair maybe this

54:07.100 --> 54:13.320
is just one element and there's more to come but if this is it it's kind of weak I mean

54:13.320 --> 54:18.360
I guess it's better than nothing it's better than nothing but it's it's a little weak a

54:18.360 --> 54:22.900
little lame do it I'll still buy it though don't get me wrong they're gonna have another

54:22.900 --> 54:26.420
Another game for like instant messaging and another game that you have to pop in and you're

54:26.420 --> 54:31.900
all like I gotta email my friend in Final Fantasy 3, oh I gotta chat with him using

54:31.900 --> 54:38.480
Metroid Prime Hunters, oh I gotta, oh it's kinda lame.

54:38.480 --> 54:42.980
But anyways, kind of on a little bit of a different topic here.

54:42.980 --> 54:50.580
Square Enix's president was interviewed by IGN here, or they have the interview on IGN

54:50.580 --> 54:51.580
I should say.

54:51.580 --> 54:57.200
And he was talking about basically different things, online gaming, kind of where he sees

54:57.200 --> 55:04.380
things going, and a little bit about testing their games before they go out for example.

55:04.380 --> 55:08.520
And one of the things he says is because of the way that they have the systems now where

55:08.520 --> 55:15.680
you can patch them later on, extensive testing is not needed to release a game.

55:15.680 --> 55:19.160
Hopefully that's not a trend we're going to start seeing, where these games go out,

55:19.160 --> 55:20.860
yeah it's okay I'll fix it later

55:20.860 --> 55:23.960
it doesn't matter. You might be out of a job Miklotov

55:23.960 --> 55:28.280
Why? Well because if they don't need testing on the games that they're just gonna

55:28.280 --> 55:29.440
patch everything

55:29.440 --> 55:33.440
I haven't tested a game in forever. Oh you're moving on up the corporate ladder now huh?

55:33.440 --> 55:36.960
Yeah I'm going up the corporate ladder. But you can't talk about what you do huh? No I can't. Anyways

55:36.960 --> 55:41.800
the quote here is that game makers have until now incurred great cost

55:41.800 --> 55:43.480
during development for debugging

55:43.480 --> 55:47.560
he said basically perhaps we can reduce the cost

55:47.560 --> 55:52.440
and suggest that the availability of software updates developers won't have

55:52.440 --> 55:53.560
to work so hard

55:53.560 --> 55:57.160
to find the zaniest bugs. And Wada didn't

55:57.160 --> 56:00.360
use the word patch strictly but you know

56:00.360 --> 56:04.800
that's what his translator said. You know I'm all for patching games to fix bugs but

56:04.800 --> 56:08.640
at the same time don't use that as a crutch I mean if your game has a

56:08.640 --> 56:11.720
you know crippling bug in it you can't release it

56:11.720 --> 56:15.720
out there crash people's systems. Don't you remember like wasn't there bugs in some

56:15.720 --> 56:19.320
Sony game that would like fry your memory card or something like that. A lot of them.

56:19.320 --> 56:23.960
Yeah I mean you can't, that's not cool. You can't just patch that. You gotta

56:23.960 --> 56:27.160
get that out in the testing process and make sure that you know you're not gonna

56:27.160 --> 56:30.200
release a game that's gonna fry my memory card. I understand like some things are a little

56:30.200 --> 56:34.280
different like for example uh the duping glitch in Oblivion. I mean obviously

56:35.160 --> 56:39.880
that's something that they couldn't have found you know without really going through there and

56:39.880 --> 56:44.040
no one's saying that the games have to be perfect but like for example the Jaws game that came out

56:44.040 --> 56:48.640
That was super duper glitchy, you know, something like that where they can go back in

56:48.640 --> 56:50.840
They need to really fix before it goes out

56:50.840 --> 56:56.500
But if you find like a bug or an exploit and even still I say with the oblivion exploit leave it in there

56:56.500 --> 57:01.860
That's your own, you know bug and if people want to use it great, they'll use it. Otherwise, it's not really hurting anything

57:01.860 --> 57:06.400
Okay, amigos have you're saying more things in chat that you're saying on the show. Sure. I mean here

57:06.400 --> 57:06.800
Okay

57:06.800 --> 57:12.120
my opinion is that you know buggy games come out all the time and it's not like

57:12.120 --> 57:16.300
just because they're saying oh we'll

57:14.260 --> 57:18.180
release updates... it's not like

57:16.300 --> 57:20.220
they're gonna quit finding bugs or

57:18.180 --> 57:23.020
anything. it's not... like, testing is gonna

57:20.220 --> 57:26.020
stop because they have this new way to

57:23.020 --> 57:27.380
fix bugs that accidentally get shipped.

57:26.020 --> 57:30.480
you're gonna get

57:27.380 --> 57:31.820
like a really crappy game, well you are gonna

57:30.480 --> 57:35.040
get a really crappy game from somebody I'm

57:31.820 --> 57:37.020
sure, but it's not like you're gonna get one

57:35.040 --> 57:39.020
that hasn't been tested at all and

57:37.020 --> 57:40.860
there's gonna be tons and tons of bugs. just

57:40.860 --> 57:49.860
the system sometimes. Like the demo disk, yeah, for Viewtiful Joe 2, because that was really terrible.

57:49.860 --> 57:51.860
Was that one of the culprits? One of the ones that...

57:51.860 --> 57:52.860
Yeah, that erased your memory card.

57:52.860 --> 57:59.860
Yeah, okay, I remember that. Said I never played it, thankfully, or I might have been a little upset.

57:59.860 --> 58:00.860
Yeah.

58:00.860 --> 58:06.860
Alright, well, you might know that the Xbox 360 had this huge shortage problem when it first came out.

58:06.860 --> 58:12.900
Well, it's being reported that ATI and Silicon Integrated Systems have said that orders for

58:12.900 --> 58:19.280
their chips used in the Wii and the Xbox 360 are picking up in preparation for the holiday

58:19.280 --> 58:20.280
season.

58:20.280 --> 58:24.220
So it looks like, especially hearing that the Wii's on there is a good sign, that means

58:24.220 --> 58:28.500
Nintendo is apparently already starting to crank out these systems in preparation for

58:28.500 --> 58:33.100
their launch, but of course, Xbox 360 is not going to go another Christmas without plenty

58:33.100 --> 58:37.660
of systems on the shelves for everyone, especially so they can really get out there and compete

58:37.660 --> 58:41.380
with the PlayStation 3, because you'll have a lot of folks making their final decisions

58:41.380 --> 58:43.380
this holiday season, so it'll be very interesting.

58:43.380 --> 58:48.380
Yes, and on top of that, it's also interesting that they mention that the Wii is in production

58:48.380 --> 58:53.820
because, according to a CNN Money story, they're saying that it's been in production at least

58:53.820 --> 59:00.140
since June 21st, and considering the fact that the PlayStation 3 hasn't even begun production

59:00.140 --> 59:05.000
yet and the 360 only had about 69 days before the sale date.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.860
That bodes well for gamers if you're looking for the Wii and it also means that an October

59:09.860 --> 59:13.560
or even possibly September launch is very likely.

59:13.560 --> 59:18.040
I doubt it's going to be a September launch because they said specifically that it's going

59:18.040 --> 59:24.440
to be in the fourth quarter and well you know September is not the fourth quarter.

59:24.440 --> 59:29.320
And anyways they're supposed to actually be announcing the official date and price for

59:29.320 --> 59:34.500
the Wii in September, so until then, we'll just have to wait, but that's more evidence

59:34.500 --> 59:39.820
that, you know, it could be coming out in October, so at least hopefully they're making

59:39.820 --> 59:43.720
it sound like there's not going to be shortages, and according to, you know, what I've heard

59:43.720 --> 59:48.340
at my work, we actually might get some at launch, which means that there shouldn't be

59:48.340 --> 59:53.040
shortages out there, because if they're giving them the distribution at launch, then that's

59:53.040 --> 59:54.040
a good sign.

59:54.040 --> 59:55.040
That's a very good sign.

59:55.040 --> 59:59.380
Now, are you still sticking to that October 18th date that you leaked out a while ago

59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.380
on the show?

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.380
So far, yeah.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.380
So far?

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:05.380
Because, you know, in our system, we had our assistant buyer change all the dates on me

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:09.060
to, what was it, November 15th.

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.660
I think they did that just because they're tired of putting different dates in there

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:15.940
for everything, and it's kind of what they're doing with the PS3 stuff until they find out

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:22.620
more about that, but all the pre-book dates are still where they were before, so it's

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:29.260
still looking October from what I've seen so far and you know even if you

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:32.760
know they come out and announce I it's got to be October because I know there

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.620
was another story that was like Sports Illustrated for kids or whatever seen

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:40.380
November 6 I think that's too close to the ps3 launch to make it successful I

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:43.660
think that they would want to launch at least a month in advance I think we need

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.420
a friendly reminder because we have somebody in our chat room bandit says

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.300
where does Loki work that he gets all these dates so what kind of is a Game

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.300
GameStop, EB?

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.900
I don't work for GameStop or EB.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.340
I work for a game distributor.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.060
We sell to retail stores.

01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:59.980
So you're one step up on the food chain?

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:00.980
Sort of.

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:05.220
GameStop and EB, they get their dates from a system that's put in by their buyers at

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:09.040
corporate or wherever their office is.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:16.580
We get our dates straight from the publishers when they give us updates every week or so.

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:22.340
I look like four or five times a day to see if there's a new date or different change or anything and I look I

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:30.740
Look very hard, but even then sometimes the dates change around. Sometimes they're wrong and sometimes I gotta fix them like for example our

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:37.560
Purchasing people made a goof and they put layer saying that was on PlayStation 2 and I had to correct them tell them no

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.020
You're wrong

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:44.260
It's a PlayStation 3 game and they make goofs because they have a guy working for him that does the date entering that's kind of brand

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:50.500
new to it so he messes up sometimes and puts you know wrong dates or you know maybe lists

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:55.140
you know the name wrong but uh for the most part you know we do get our information straight

01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:00.620
from their sales staff and a lot of times before you'll hear it at GameStop because

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:05.660
you know their sales staff are really loose lipped sometimes and uh they'll leak out like

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.580
I don't know the entire E3 lineup for Konami for example.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:11.780
Alright I guess we uh brought to you earlier this year.

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:17.780
Alright, uh, let's go to the mailbag. Every week we like to go into the mailbag and read some emails that came to us from our listeners.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:21.780
And yes, I realize DarkSakura is not here tonight. She's usually the one that goes to the mailbag.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.780
However, she gave me permission in her absence to go in there and pull out some letters.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.780
So, let's go to the mailbag.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:33.780
And, of course, you guys can always send us emails. It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:39.780
So let me, uh, put on these slightly used gloves, hazmat gloves, and dig into the mailbag.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.860
email comes to us from an unsigned name it's not signed but the email address

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:48.460
has Andrew in it so I'm assuming the guy's name is Andrew well I am new here

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:51.820
and I've only listened to one podcast but I really enjoyed it and could tell

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:55.540
that everyone there was really new their games thank you the reason I sent this

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:59.620
email was that I got a DS and so far only have Mario Kart and I really want

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:04.220
to know what are in your opinion the best games out for the DS and some that

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:09.260
have a close release date so I can buy one I know that is good and see if I can

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:13.020
them really cheap on the net any help is appreciated

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:16.140
phoenix right oh my god phoenix right if you can find it

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.860
phoenix right it's very hard to find they're doing a reprint again you can go

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:21.020
on capcom site capcom is selling them out

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:25.260
pretty quick oh really capcom site great but they're

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.220
they're printing them as much as they can because they have to print them over

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.980
in like hong kong or something like that and

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:34.060
then ship them over you know in a batch and then those sell out like almost if

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.580
you can't get an american one the recently re-released japanese one does

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:42.300
have an English option, and since the DS is region-free, you can import that and play

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.300
it.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.300
And it's totally worth it.

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:48.780
I would say, which you probably want to do, Tetris DS of course, you know, great stuff.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:52.260
New Super Mario Brothers is very popular, if you like, you know what, if you like the

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:53.500
old ones, I think you'll get a kick out of it.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.500
New Super Mario Brothers is pretty cool, I actually want to get some of those bit generation

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.140
games that are coming out in the Game Boy Advance, because they look pretty cool.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.620
I would recommend Hyli Meteos, if you like puzzlers at all, definitely get your hands

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.460
on Meteos, it's still a good value, still.

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.740
And I think it's actually pretty cheap, you can find it out there, I think they were doing

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:13.380
like a clear out of them at uh, I think Toys R Us or something?

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:18.000
Uh, yeah, it really depends what type of games you like, I mean, but the DS has some solid

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.160
hits in every genre right now, so...

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.160
Go check out...

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.160
Except racing.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.160
Go to Mario Kart!

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.160
How does it count?

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.160
It's fun.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.720
Go check out the new section over at like, you know, Gamestop, or even go check out the

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:34.280
bargain bins down at like, Toys R Us or KB Toys and stuff like that, and see if you can

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:40.400
find some of the first generation games out there that may be a bit cheaper and go from

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.520
there to build up your library.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.200
Our second email of three tonight comes from Seth.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:50.600
Hi, my name is Seth and I'm 15 and I listen to the podcast every week.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:54.120
The past couple episodes you've been discussing the new laws that are being made in states

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.440
such as Louisiana.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.920
I think these laws are ridiculous.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.880
I'm young and I play violent games.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.920
I don't ever get the urge to go outside and shoot people.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.360
If I played a Harry Potter game, which I don't, I wouldn't go outside with my mom's broom

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.880
and jump off the roof because I think I can fly.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.160
I believe that the government is just trying to find an excuse for why kids are going out

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.160
and shooting up their schools.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.400
Thanks for having such a great show.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.720
I listen to OLR every week."

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.360
Well, thanks for the kind words.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.160
Hey, you know what?

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.160
Pretty smart kid there, you know, with the Harry Potter reference.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.640
That's a pretty interesting comparison there.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.640
Exactly.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.420
I mean look at was it that movie the boy who could fly?

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:34.860
Did he have like a high you know rate of suicides after that movie?

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.700
Cuz I mean he jumped off his roof and started flying

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.220
You know, did we see kids, you know, just trying to kill them

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.580
So now kids do imitate try to imitate the movie sometimes though

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:42.900
Like I'm trying to what was that one?

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:47.720
We're like it had a scene where people were lying down in the middle of the road and some kids tried to imitate that and of

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:53.840
Course got run over and then they like re-released the movie with that scene edited. I was years ago. God, I'm

01:05:53.840 --> 01:06:02.840
I know what you're talking about. Yeah, it's stupid and it's just media in general. They want to blame media because obviously it's not the parent's fault, you know.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:08.840
Never the parent's fault, but I think they're starting to get it, but they just, not quite.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:16.840
And especially though this is only going to be brought up again once Saint Rose comes out, once Scarface comes out, once Reservoir Dogs comes out.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.840
This fourth quarter is really bad when it comes to this whole violent game thing, so.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:30.840
So let's go to our last email tonight, which comes to us from Grin without a cat.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:37.760
Hi guys, I've been listening to the podcast for a couple months now.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:42.340
I'm in the UK, so it's a little bit late for me to stay up to listen live as some brave

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:45.600
soul did the other week, but I look forward to each download.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.000
I wanted to respond to what the PMS and Fragdoll clans had to say about the beauty pageant

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.640
at the gaming event that had them quite worked up.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:56.080
I don't agree with the beauty pageant, but what right do these girls have to get so annoyed

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.080
with it?

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.880
They say they object to the way girl gamers are seen and want equality, but then they

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.200
go around saying, hey look, we're a clan of girls, look at us.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.960
If they want to be accepted as just regular gamers, why do they go out of their way to

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.840
separate themselves from others?

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.400
The word hypocrites comes to mind.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.480
Also I think an OLR gaming group is a great idea.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:21.440
I'm planning to get a 360 in September as I'm really interested in live and making my

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:31.040
gaming experiences more sociable, but I keep hearing enjoyment of live relays on a good

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:45.120
friends list and all my gaming friends are PC only gamers, so to have a group of friendly

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.120
faces to ease me into online gaming would be welcome.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:54.880
On the second point there, I can say, I love this, if you go to the forums, there's a thread

01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:01.160
where people have started talking about OL Army clans, that's O-L-R-M-Y-O-L Army, on

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.400
different games, and I've seen some really impressive stuff that is very flattering.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.200
Have you checked out this thread?

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:16.440
We put a picture of our podcast art on Counter Strike in some mod or something, and it's

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:19.940
really funny because if you look at the picture, the screenshot somebody took, the gun is pointed

01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.780
right at your face, Loki, it's great.

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:26.100
But then, no, I thought this was cool too, I guess there's a Guild Wars clan as well,

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.960
and somebody just posted a picture of their cape, and it's like an orange cape, and they

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.260
couldn't really put their own logo on it, but they put something that looked like Sakura

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:36.240
blossoms on it for Dark Sakura.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.240
Get it?

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.240
I thought that's cute.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:43.240
Our listeners are so awesome. So check out that thread on our forums and you can find some gamers.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.240
There's even an Xbox Live gamer tag exchange. And I even give out my gamer tag. I don't care.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.240
My gamer tag is on there and I have a bunch of friends.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.240
Sadly enough, I am paying for live, but I don't really play over live. I don't get it.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.240
I do once in a while.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.240
Yeah, I really need to get down to...

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.240
I'll play Halo 3 when it's out for sure.

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:04.240
I don't really have that many good games that I want to play. Like, Burnout even over live, I don't really care for it that much.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.240
I thought Burnout was fun. I'm just not good at it, so it doesn't give me incentive to play.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.320
want to play ChromeHounds over live I think that'd be fun because ChromeHounds

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:13.920
is actually gonna allow you to do clans so I think that's something that they

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.880
really need because I don't know you don't really have that over live all

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.960
right well thank you guys so much for the emails we really appreciate if you

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.080
guys want to send us an email as well you can always do that it's mailbag at

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:31.400
orange lounge radio.com also we started a new segment last week called the

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.240
voicemails of the week we wanted to try something a little different using our

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:39.640
Skype line and we invited you guys to send us some voicemails in regards to a

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:43.240
particular topic and some of you guys called in about the topic but one of the

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.920
voicemails we're gonna play tonight has nothing to do with the topic at hand but

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.720
it's still kind of funny so we'll play it and I was very overwhelmed with the

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.740
response when I went in there to go look you guys I'll tell you guys off-air how

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:58.560
much we are was pretty cool. Overwhelmed like you cried? No I didn't cry but I was

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.900
just very happy that a lot of people were responding to it so I'm glad you

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:05.940
guys like this but unfortunately that means we can't play every voicemail so please don't

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:09.660
be hurt if we don't play your voicemail but we get three really good ones that I want

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:12.660
to play and I'll give you guys a new topic and maybe some of the people who didn't get

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:14.620
in this week can get in next week.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.580
Anyway, so let's go to the voicemail.

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.740
Here's voicemail number one and the topic last week was do you pre-order games because

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:21.620
remember that fight you got in with Dark Soccer?

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.420
It was pretty bloody.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.740
Anyway here's the first voicemail.

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:32.740
Hello Orange Orange Radio, this is the all-infamous Fury Lover answering your question of the voicemail of the week.

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:42.740
I actually pre-order certain games that I would like to buy that I know would get, that would be sold out.

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:49.740
And I think the advantages of actually pre-ordering games are actually quite good,

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:56.740
quite good because if you pre-order a game from trusted sources like GameStop or EB Games,

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:04.100
you know you'll have the game when it comes out or whenever you want to get it. But pre-ordering

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:11.100
games from things like FYE and stuff like that is just horrible. So yeah, that's all

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:17.300
I have to say. Thank you. Bye. Thanks for the voicemail, Yuri Lever. I think

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:20.700
It's interesting because it sounds like he trusts some stores but he doesn't trust others.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:25.480
And it's true because some stores I think actually do buy direct from the publishers

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.480
and some don't.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:30.800
So they might get them late or might not get them at all or they're reliant on some other

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.800
stores to get them.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.980
So it seems like Yuri Lever is saying, you know, stick with the stores that deal in games.

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:38.220
I would say games are probably pretty good, the pre-order stuff, because they usually

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:42.260
try to throw in like a little goodie with it, like something free.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.540
I forgot to tell, I was going to say it when DarkSakura was here when she's not here tonight,

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:50.100
I pre-ordered Final Fantasy XII. I usually don't pre-order games, but because of that

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:54.100
special little bundle they're going to have and I'm just such a whore, I pre-ordered it.

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.420
What about The Urgent Service?

01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:01.380
I'm not as interested in that game. I might pick it up, but I'm much more interested in XII. The

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.500
Urgent Service isn't really Final Fantasy. I mean, sure, it's Vincent, but it's not really

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:09.540
Final Fantasy. Something different. You know, having a modded PS2 really opens the options

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:14.660
for me as far as where I can get that game. All right let's go to our next voicemail.

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:21.380
Hello O.R. this is Razorburn 2021. Your question I believe was about pre-ordering games and

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:29.700
if I don't have to I try not to pre-order games. I believe there was an argument that I'd read a

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:36.260
year or two something like that ago in the arcade about the problems with pre-ordering games is that

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:40.780
that's kind of how game stores gauge what they should stock, and you talked about games

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:45.300
like Point Blank DS that are difficult to find, and that's because generally no one

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:51.900
pre-orders them. So if I don't have to, I try not to. I don't recommend it. I don't

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:56.580
generally have to pre-order movies. I don't generally have to pre-order CDs or several

01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:00.300
other things that I like to buy. I would just like it if I could go into a game store and

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:04.380
purchase what I want to. I appreciate your show. Have a good day.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:10.320
Thanks for the voicemail. I think that was an interesting one because he gives a good argument for why you should pre-order games

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:11.740
But then says he doesn't do it

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:17.520
But I like I like that he gave the kind of comparison there about the I don't pre-order movies or CDs

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:24.100
Yeah, I seem to recall though. I seem to remember a day where you could pre-order CDs who buys CDs anymore

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.900
Anyway, why would you need to pre-order?

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.900
Hey, I you know, I

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:34.140
The thing is, I'm glad the internet's there, and I do every now and then like going into

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:39.340
a CD store like Tower and going and just like, going through their dance section or their

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:43.020
import section and just listening to what they've got, and a lot of times it's hard

01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:44.180
to find stuff.

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.460
That's kind of why the reason I turned to the internet, because you know, you can't

01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:55.340
find something because it was only on a single vinyl, and I'm not gonna buy a $10 record,

01:13:55.340 --> 01:14:01.000
know, even though I do have two turntables I don't ever use, and a microphone, huh, forget

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
it.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.220
But, well, I think it's interesting because it sounds like this caller likes to do the

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:12.260
same sort of thing but with games, just kind of wants to go in and see what's available.

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:15.860
Yeah, in movies I don't think it's going to be such a big thing where you'd have to actually

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:19.900
pre-order that, some games maybe, if you're really looking for some niche.

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:24.060
Alright, this next call had nothing to do with the question at hand, but whatever, it

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.620
interesting so I'll play it anyway.

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:33.420
Hey, this is MacMan, and I was just listening to the podcast that I got during iTunes and

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:34.620
The Poohs.

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:41.340
Now what, I'm not sure if you, if you all got your thoughts together in like a complete

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:45.180
box together in this area enough.

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:51.220
Could you elaborate on your feelings about the gayest name of a video game accessory

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.420
and or console ever created?

01:14:53.420 --> 01:15:00.380
um that's it bye gayest name of a video game accessory that's a random question

01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:04.380
well i i did you hear about the tech and butt plug actually that's come no uh

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:11.180
uh i that's easy the res trans vibrator the res trans vibrator the trans vibrator is

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:15.900
i think it's someone that was on e when they figured out that when they're like

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:22.380
dude it vibrates with the music that's awesome uh it feels totally good when i'm on e and i'm

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:26.360
touching it you know a week later and I still don't believe that poos thing that

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.140
they're gonna call the Sony controller the poos that's that's a load of crap

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:34.660
that's a load of poo is what it is I don't I don't buy it I mean if I'm wrong

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:39.260
I'm wrong and I weak for Sony because that's I mean God is I mean we have been

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:42.980
kicked I mean the gaming community's been kicking those guys non-stop to me

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:47.440
E3 and this is just another like oh my god but I that's why if they called it

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.600
the poos that would be the candy sprinkles on the icing of the cake I

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:55.960
that's all it would really be you don't need it but it's there and you got to appreciate it so

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:01.880
i don't think it's gonna matter what they call the controller because you know if they called

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:08.360
the controller you know a giant dong no one's still gonna buy that system you know at least

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:12.680
as much as they would if it were you know 200 cheaper funnydale in our chat room has a good

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:19.880
comment here i know uh the ass poking game that's only in japan you know you see you've seen pictures

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.060
of this all around the internet and if you could use your finger I mean

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:26.440
hypothetically you could use a you know what forget forget wherever that

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:30.580
thoughts going I think that's it for the voicemails of the week overall though it

01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:33.700
seems like you guys the kind of general consensus I was getting for the

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:38.660
voicemails is that you guys prefer pre-ordering for certain games but not

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:42.020
everything we thank you guys for your voicemails and sorry to those folks we

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.960
didn't get around to if you would like to leave us as voicemail please do the

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:51.360
The number is 916-226-9067, but remember that may be a toll call, so please, if you don't

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.120
pay the bills, ask whoever does their permission first in our question.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:59.200
Or use a cell phone, because a lot of times they get free long distance.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.160
Make sure it does before you call, if it's not yours.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160
Nights and weekends.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.400
Again, if you're not paying the bill, you better ask.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.400
Or you can use Skype.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.340
You can call us on Orange Launch Radio at Skype anytime when we're not live, and you

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:11.600
also get the voicemail that way, and I think we did get a couple voicemails that way.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.240
The question we have for you guys, you know we want your opinions on this.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:19.000
whole Sony billboard controversy what do you guys think of that I mean is that is

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.320
it being overblown do people have a right to be upset was it in good taste

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:26.840
bad taste what do you think of that whole controversy I love to hear from

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.480
you guys on that one and we'll play some of our favorite voicemails next week

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:38.360
meanwhile back to the news yes and speaking about strange stuff DOAs

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:45.800
I can't even pronounce his name, but Tagi, or Itagaki, that's right.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.600
This is why I'm not Japanese.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:55.320
Anyways, he admits to being quite intoxicated while creating DOA4, and he's all, pretty

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:59.020
much, I'm drinking pretty much full time.

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:04.000
Of course there are ups and downs, waves of how I drink in terms of the amount, but it's

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.480
long periods of time.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:12.640
In the last 10 years, not that you asked this question, I think I had better ideas when

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.080
I was drinking whiskey.

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:21.800
When I'm drinking shochu, that's a conservative drink, so the ideas are not that great.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:28.200
Beer is just like water to me, so it helps me and everything else loosen up a bit.

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:32.760
It doesn't really contribute to coming up with ideas.

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.800
Everything is explained on why there was a dead or alive volleyball game now.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:40.620
explained cuz most people when they heard that were like what that explains

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:44.900
also explains why come on that guy is such a rock star I mean seriously when

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:47.500
you look at pictures of him and see him in interviews he's just a freaking rock

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:51.380
star I mean he's like the Tommy Lee of game designs right and you know he just

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:54.880
you know he's the type of person that probably thrashes hotel rooms sits there

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.580
with a fat cigar in his mouth while he's probably you know designing games you

01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:03.780
know it's no surprise now I kind of wish that we bowl was kind of like handling

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:09.120
DOA the movie because if it got you know all fucked up this guy could come beat

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:15.360
the crap out of him Japanese break a bottle over his head exactly he should

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.520
put himself in the next DOA game because that would be awesome I would love to

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:26.720
play him in DOA that might sell another copy of the game for me I do a forum I

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:30.660
don't play DOA for it's sitting collecting dust check it out it's funny

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:34.360
you played on live I've actually played that kind of game on live I get my

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.600
absolutely because I suck at it crazy you know avatars and stuff that you can

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:43.560
sit there as you know why you're waiting for a game it sounds kind of fun all

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:47.760
right for those of you that like your games a little more conservative you'll

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:53.840
probably enjoy this the Bob Ross game that's coming out Bob Ross interactive

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.000
is actually having a contest right now it started on July 4th and they are

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.920
accepting work but only those that are created using Bob Ross's patented wet on

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:08.240
wet technique. Why are you giggling? Because that was funny sounding. Here's

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:11.280
with the wet on wet technique for those who haven't watched the show. You put a

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.760
base coat of their paint on it and then you get dirty. When I say

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:22.200
happy trees you probably think something dirty in that too. No. Isn't that funny

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.440
that we went from a dead or alive story to wet on wet? Anyway now it's not funny.

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:31.480
using Bob Ross approved materials. How would he approve it? He's dead.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.800
Because it has to be like, you know, licensed, I don't know.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.480
Anyway, you gotta be 18 years or older to enter. You can only submit up to three

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.120
paintings

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.800
and they have to sign all these waivers that they might use your designs but hey

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.520
your artwork could be in a video game

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:47.360
so if you're a Bob Ross fan and you want to paint yourself some happy trees and happy

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.920
clouds and maybe see them in a video game

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:52.520
go for it!

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:58.880
Let's see, the original story actually ran on www.nintendogal.com, but I believe you

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:04.920
can actually visit www.bobross.com for more of the details.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:09.400
Bob Ross, Beyond the Grave, ooh yeah.

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:20.240
Anyways, speaking of stuff that's, I don't know, dead, the PSP security on the firmware,

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:25.400
pretty much dead cuz now you can downgrade again if you happen to own a

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:31.640
you know 2.6 or 2 points or 2.5 or 2.6 firmware that's right folks you can

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:35.280
downgrade because they're groddiest upgraded me to 2.6 just you know yeah

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:39.080
well Grand Theft Auto was probably one of the ones that you know got you the

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:47.400
2.5 and 2.6 for me was Katamari but they have decrypted 2.5 and 2.6 and now there

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:51.240
is a downgrader and actually if you visit PSP updates they have tons of

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.840
different downgraders that you can get to do that including one that will

01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:01.600
downgrade you from 1.5 to 1.0 and for those who don't remember 1.0 was the

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:07.000
original Japanese firmware that allowed you to run homebrew no problem and also

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.240
kind of in the similar story firmware 2.7 has been decrypted and they're

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:16.960
They're working on a downgrader for that.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:21.120
Why don't they just get the homebrew to work on 2.6, then I don't have a downgrader.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.120
They have.

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.120
Okay, good.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:29.680
They have that, and they also have this thing where you can actually run 1.5, and it will

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.440
give you the features of 2.5.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:36.800
So you have the RSS features, the web browser, and you can play 2.5 games on there.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:40.580
Wi-Fi doesn't quite work well though with that, but still kind of neat that they're

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:47.080
doing it and you know, I don't know, I don't really follow the homebrew stuff that much

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:51.560
anymore. Do they have a Nintendo emulator for 2.6 firmware? It's basically anything

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:56.400
works with 2.6. Although the thing with 2.6 is you have to have Grand Theft Auto in order

01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:01.800
to do all these workarounds. So yeah, you may want to downgrade or something or just

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:08.760
don't play emulators on there because whatever. Get a DS for that. There's a lot of stuff

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:17.140
for that. What is that? I can't play Kid Icarus on my DS yet? You can if you have the stuff

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:25.100
for that you can get emulators. But I don't! Whatever! Wine! I thought there was something

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:29.680
really interesting though that kind of ties in with this. They released a new version

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:35.180
of PSP Revolution and because our show used to be about Bomani, you can use this game

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:41.500
it's basically step mania for the psp so if you do end up downgrading to 1.5 check out psp

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:47.900
revolution version 0.2 and that'd be really fun to play on a handheld and they've had they've

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:53.100
ddr on the gameboy is stupid they've added themes they've added theme support and arrow speed

01:23:53.100 --> 01:24:01.340
modifiers as well as um aug music files are now supported and um yeah marathon songs and all that

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:07.720
sort of stuff so check it out if you're really interested in step mania on your

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:13.120
PSP all right well completely changing gears here we haven't talked a whole lot

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:18.020
about Microsoft tonight because you know Xbox 360 it's out there's not a lot you

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.840
know and it's got their games coming out so we don't have quite the rumors that

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:24.680
we have with Sony and Nintendo however Microsoft does have some rumors of their

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:34.680
It's been reported by Bloomberg that Microsoft may be working on an iPod killer that's supposed to hit shelves this Christmas.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:42.680
Microsoft's device will be able to connect to the Internet and other devices using the Wireless Fidelity, or Wi-Fi standard, which iTunes doesn't have.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:50.680
Microsoft is also promising the screen will have better quality picture than the iPod, according to the people who saw the slideshow Microsoft is using to promote the device.

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:58.680
The music and TV companies are interested in working with Microsoft in order to blunt Apple's power in the market, according to people close to the media companies.

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:03.680
Now, it doesn't really directly tie into gaming here, because they haven't said a lot about gaming features,

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:12.680
but you can assume that, especially with, I would say, the whole Xbox Live Anywhere thing that's going to be on the cell phones and all that,

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:16.680
this might play into that, or something else.

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:20.720
I would say maybe like Xbox Live Arcade stuff possibly

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:24.120
possibly so don't count it out I mean if this whole thing is true to me

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:27.280
They do have Xbox Live Arcade for the PC as well I mean

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:32.080
so and if you ever visit zone.msn.com I think it is the zone

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:37.660
they have gaming badges set up very similar to how Xbox Live works it's very

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:38.760
interesting so

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:42.120
because MSN obviously Microsoft runs that too

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:46.000
I don't doubt Microsoft probably gonna put something out there to compete

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.200
so I don't doubt that this rumor is probably true

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.900
but it will be very interesting to see what that is because we've had kinda all sorts

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:53.500
a little

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:56.680
like rumblings of course we've had the loudest one was the origami

01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:00.520
you know we saw pictures of that and then that's more like just a PC

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:04.000
in your hand yeah pretty much and then there was you know the rumors of the

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:04.880
ex-boy

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:09.240
all that stuff you know I almost see them doing something like

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:13.040
the Nomad for the original Xbox

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.320
in something like this. That's kinda where I'm seeing this going

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:21.680
is maybe like a portable Xbox like an original one where it plays the old Xbox games

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:23.640
so they don't really have to make new games

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:27.480
but I don't know. I think it might be a little late to do something like that but

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:32.840
I thought. GK128 in our chat room says it figures Microsoft is coming out with a

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:35.520
Super MP3 player just as I bought a fancy new one.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.360
Don't worry Apple put out the video iPods like a week after I bought mine.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.920
Yeah, jerks. Well, something that's definitely going to be

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.240
implemented with probably this is going to be some sort of

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:50.800
e-distribution, especially of music and movies, but of course

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.080
Sony is talking about doing games, because, you know,

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.680
their first priority, of course, is games with the PS3, right?

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.320
Anyways, so they're definitely talking about doing something to

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.160
the sense of, you know, Xbox Live's marketplace, where you can be able to

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.600
download arcade-type

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:14.600
And according to an article that was on Gamasutra, definitely something that they're going to be doing.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:20.600
Certainly being able to sell growably online makes it easier to reach in international and remote markets.

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.600
On the business side, it also lowers the cost of sales and eliminates inventory risk.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.600
It should help Crutale use game sales and piracy.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:33.600
I don't like the whole use game sales thing, but I can understand the piracy, I guess.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:37.360
something tells me that's not gonna work just like they think it's gonna but

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:43.680
sure. Wherever security is pirates will follow but you know E-distribution is not

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:44.800
surprising at all.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.320
Please Sony do not go out there saying

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.160
our security is better than everybody else's. We're gonna be able to

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.160
you know beat all the pirates out there because that's just like picking a fight.

01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:59.160
That's poking the beehive so

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.200
you shouldn't be doing that but anyways so yeah definitely they're gonna be doing

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:08.960
something probably similar to actually I'm thinking putting on Playstation 1 games to

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.720
be able to download straight to the hard drive being that the size of the files should be

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:16.920
a lot smaller and they're also going to be doing something similar with the PSP so if

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:22.400
they can do it on the PSP they can definitely do it on the PS3 so that's kind of a given.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:30.360
And also maybe even later on down the lines being able to stream all real PS3 games so

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.360
that they're interested in. What's kind of interesting though is their comment here

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:39.360
we're looking for fresh new ideas that fully exploit the power of the PS3.

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:45.360
Our first party products are unique to the PS3 and some of our games by virtue of the design and hardware demands

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.360
could simply not work on the Xbox 360.

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:50.360
Oh really?

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.360
So, I don't know.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.360
Alright, we'll see how that goes.

01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.360
But I do have something real quick.

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:02.760
Oh sure, the Playstation Beyond site that launched during Game Developers Conference

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.760
this year.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.840
And you always see this Play Beyond thing, how much do you want to bet that they're calling

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:09.120
their marketplace Beyond?

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.120
Just a thought.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.000
That's an interesting thought.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Because that's a big game.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Sure, it makes sense.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.360
Maybe it'll tie together in the end.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:22.680
Anyway, changing gears here, Empire Interactive, been some rumblings out of there this week.

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:27.000
The FlatOut franchise is going to be coming to the Xbox 360.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.200
It's called Flat Out Total Carnage, and for those of you guys not familiar with this series,

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.960
it originally came out July last year.

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:37.680
It's got destructible cars, kind of like a racing game, and of course scenery, and it's

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.000
got sadistic minigames inside it.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.800
You go into barriers at high speed, you eject the driver to hit targets like a giant dart

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.840
board or bowling pins.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:47.840
It sounds like you're...

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:48.840
I've never heard you talk about this game.

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.840
I played Flat Out.

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:52.020
Oh, I played it last year when it first came out.

01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:53.320
It's a pretty fun game.

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:57.320
You actually, it's more of kind of, this year they rebuilt the whole game from the ground

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:01.640
up, so it's a lot better, a lot faster, it seems like a cross between Burnout and Destruction

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:06.400
Derby, and you also have a whole ton of mini games, they call it like the Ragdoll Olympics

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.400
type stuff.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:12.640
And you can basically eject your driver out, like the one for example is baseball, and

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.520
you eject your driver out, and he flies up towards this giant baseball bat and then smacked

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:20.920
with the baseball bat and you fling his body into a mitt.

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:27.140
And I can tell you this much, you can play these minigames and they will keep you entertained

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.140
for hours.

01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:29.140
Especially you.

01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:32.200
You probably sat there and giggled for like an hour.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.200
Oh yes I did.

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:38.720
I played the high jump like, I don't know, for at least a half an hour just like looking

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.720
at the thing.

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.720
And it was fun.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:41.720
It's a pretty fun game.

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.720
This one looks a lot better.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.760
Flatout 2 is coming out in a few weeks.

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:47.400
Xbox, PC, and Playstation 2.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.840
Yeah, I think I'm on the...

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:49.840
August 1st.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:50.840
This fall.

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:51.840
August 1st.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:52.840
They're wrong.

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:53.840
Oh, we'll see.

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:59.000
Alright, also, Empire Interactive is coming out with a PSP version of Taito Legends, and

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.440
is also working on a version of Ford Street Racing for the PSP as well.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:03.440
Ooh, goodie!

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.440
Ford Street Racing.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.160
That's just such an awesome game!

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:09.520
I haven't played it, don't really have an opinion on it.

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:14.240
Lame-o is what you might call that game, but yeah.

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:19.880
Anyways, something that's not quite as lame as Forged Racing there.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:26.240
Zelda is actually, there's a homebrew Zelda for mobile phones, and they're calling it

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.240
Zelda.

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:33.000
That's kind of funny because when you think of Zelda you think of Wind Waker or Phantom

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Hourglass even.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:39.320
Well it's funny you should mention that because they actually are using the Minish Cap graphics

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:45.080
so it kind of looks a little bit like Wind Waker, and sort of Wind Waker and Zelda.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:48.960
I thought Minish Cap looked more like the old school Super Nintendo one.

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.080
Yeah, it kind of, but here's a few things.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.880
Too bad it wasn't as fun.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:59.080
But anyways, there's actually some pretty impressive graphics on there, and they have

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:04.760
the latest demo which is working on Mi Deep P2 compatible phones, and there's actually

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:10.160
a way you can check it out to see if you have it or not or a compatible phone a lot of them

01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:14.600
out there I don't even know how the hell to put this on my phone to be honest but if you're

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:20.400
interested though they also have a PC version and it should be interesting if you want to

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:26.720
check and see what kind of phone you have if it'll work there's a website it's rumkin.com

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:40.720
I'll check that out, that's a cell phone game I might be able to get into.

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:46.720
Oh actually I'm sorry, this is the website jbenchmark.com slash phone details dot jsp

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:52.600
and that'll let you know what kind of phone you have and if it supports that and so that's

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:58.200
kind of neat and the PC version I'm kind of willing to check out and I believe his website

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:16.340
has gone down since this article but if you're interested at zeldamobile.gorthwoh.com, gorthworth

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:21.920
or something whatever but check it out they have some screenshots it looks pretty sweet

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:25.040
and you can download the PC and the mobile version for that.

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.560
Very cool. Just a matter of time before Nintendo shuts them down, right?

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.920
Why doesn't Nintendo get into cell phone gaming? I know I keep saying I hate cell phone gaming,

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:36.120
although I will say this week I actually noticed that some

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:40.400
games, like I used to have a version of Castlevania on my old phone and

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:44.360
Burger Time and Magical Drop, and I noticed finally new versions of that

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:46.080
came out that work on my new phone.

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:49.600
And they've actually been upgraded. The Castlevania game looks pretty nice now.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:53.280
I was actually pretty impressed, except for the fact that the controls are shit, but I

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:56.920
guess that's just because I don't really have a controller to plug into the phone, although

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.300
I know they make them.

01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:00.620
But I was somewhat pleased.

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:06.420
It's still not as good as a Game Boy Advance version of it, but you know, now this homebrew

01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:09.060
version is actually a remake of number one.

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:11.500
Right, yeah, I'd heard that there was a remake of number one.

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:12.500
That's pretty cool.

01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:15.900
Alright, one other quick story on mobile gaming, this is interesting.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:21.180
Now you know that women in gaming don't get a whole lot of coverage sometimes.

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:25.340
It's a controversial subject, you know, are they really in a game, dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:26.340
But...

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:27.340
Maybe if they were people.

01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:28.340
Oh, stop.

01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:29.340
We're gonna get angry.

01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:30.340
You're right.

01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:31.340
You're good.

01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:32.340
You better be glad Dark Soccer's not here tonight.

01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:33.740
You should shove that microphone up your ass.

01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:38.680
Anyway, there was a new study that came out called the Electronic Gaming in the Digital

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:45.320
Home from Parks Associates and it says 51% of U.S. folks who are playing games on their

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.680
mobile phones are women.

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:51.200
So the majority of cell phone gamers are women.

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:53.680
Because they don't know what a good game is.

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.800
Hate mail is coming in for you.

01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.560
Here's a quote from the study, women are the foundation of the gaming market and as an

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:05.060
industry we need to cater to their preferences and this came from the director of research

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:10.600
John Barrett at Parks Associates continuing, this effort is key to future revenue growth

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:15.220
because right now women generally spend little on gaming even though they like to play games

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.340
and often have disposable income.

01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:21.340
The industry just needs to find a game they are willing to pay for.

01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:22.340
Interesting.

01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:25.820
I don't know, why do you think that is?

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:30.140
Just because cell phone games are easy to pick up or that maybe the games they put out

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:35.900
on cell phones tend to be more puzzle games, pop-cap type games that reach the non-gamer

01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:42.080
in general, not just women, but the non-gamer in general, because obviously not all women

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.080
are non-gamers.

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:48.060
have one that co-hosts the show and you know we're talking about you know plus

01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:53.740
those are very simple so then women can understand them well that's just one but

01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:59.100
the non gamer women whatever hate mail coming in you can address those cards

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:02.540
and letters to Shane he doesn't have an orange on Twitter account though we

01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:06.940
won't give him one after that that's for sure I you know what's interesting

01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:09.860
though I was I was mentioning before in Nintendo will probably shut that Zelda

01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:12.700
thing down but they're really not in cell phone gaming and it seems like if

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:17.260
Nintendo's trying to make this real, you know, we want to reach all the non-gamers, this

01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:20.220
should be evidence to them that maybe they ought to get into mobile gaming.

01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:24.060
And I, again, am not a big fan of mobile gaming, but I would think it would be kind of cool

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:26.740
if I could play like Ice Climber on my cell phone or something.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:27.740
Maybe.

01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:28.740
Yeah, I don't know.

01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:29.740
What do you guys think?

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:34.220
We're going to open up the Skype line right now if you guys want to call in on any subject

01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:35.220
really.

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:38.140
If you have a question or comment or whatever you want to say, our Skype line is open.

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:43.500
For more information, go to www.orangelaunchradio.com, click on interact with us, or you can always

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:51.200
give us a call on our normal phone line, it's 916-226-9067, but remember kids that it might

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.820
be a toll call if you don't live next door to us.

01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:58.460
Meanwhile while we wait for some calls, do you have any quick last minute stories, anybody?

01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:03.260
No, but I don't know, I think this is kind of interesting.

01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:08.120
I was trying to look up and see what my phone had, but unfortunately I am stupid and I don't

01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:09.320
I don't know what kind of...

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.540
I know I have a Samsung phone,

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:15.240
but the model number is something I don't know.

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:18.760
And so, yeah, that makes it tough.

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:20.760
Although I think it says on my phone.

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.080
All right, let's go.

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.400
Actually, I wanna read some comments real quick,

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:24.640
then we'll go to Skyblind.

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:28.720
GK128 in response to the cell phone story.

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:31.120
My grandmother lives off of shitty Pogo games.

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:34.040
Their simplicity and fun to non-gamers is the draw.

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:36.640
Yep, I agree, that's probably what it is.

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:41.800
let's see funnydale says oh miklotov you'll love this if Nintendo wants women

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.660
to get into gaming they need to come out with a vacuum controller that's why I

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:50.660
said he rocks you guys are horrible we're only speaking the truth well he

01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:54.640
said I'm not like the views that I say but the views and opinions expressed by

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:57.920
Miklotov are not necessarily those the rest of us anyway hi you're on orange

01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:03.400
launch radio who's this you should know by now who it is as much as I call every

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:07.400
single week I know we get the same callers every week you know I have to

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:12.680
say this though callers I've been I lurk sometimes on some message forums that

01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:17.240
people don't know I lurk on and I saw some people talking smack about Orange

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:22.380
Lounge Radio and basically you know what they say the weak point of the show is

01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:29.240
the call-in segments so you know we open up this show to folks to call in because

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:32.440
we want it to be your show we don't want to be here and be all over better than

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:37.340
You know we want this to be your show as well, so but I just want you guys to know people on the interweb

01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:39.000
We're talking shit about you, but it's okay

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.300
They talk shit about dark Sakura myself and Loki all the time as well, so what can you do fuck them?

01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:46.980
It's okay, cuz I got your back, so I know you you'll protect us. What's on your mind Rama

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.000
Not much as a couple of things

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.760
I want to talk about now as you brought up about people talking smack I've removed from anime next

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:58.080
They had a group they call otaku generation dotnet doing a podcast

01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:03.360
Podcast they gave their card and I said hey have you heard of Orange Dodge radio and one of the guys said yeah

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:07.360
I've heard of them, but this show isn't all that good, so I was like well

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:13.840
I am close friends with the staff he did a 180 like oh this show is great. They're awesome. Don't hurt me

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:22.040
Interesting you know what though you know why I'm not I I don't think indie podcasters should be bashing on each other

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.200
I don't think it's a smart move. I think the indie podcasters should be coming together

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:29.480
You know, I've never listened to that program, I don't know anybody over that program, you

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:32.480
know, whatever, I have nothing bad to say about them, because I wouldn't.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:35.900
If I did have something bad to say about them, I wouldn't say it at all, because I think

01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:40.220
any podcasters have to work together, because we have to work against corporate dollars

01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:44.800
and all this, you know, corporate stuff, which by the way, reminds me about the whole podcast

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:45.800
awards thing.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:50.840
The nominations are open right now for the podcast awards, www.podcastawards.com.

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:54.840
Obviously we would love it if you would consider nominating us again in the gaming podcast

01:39:54.840 --> 01:40:00.520
category but honestly guys as long as an independent podcaster wins it I'm happy

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:04.160
and across the board and I encourage you to nominate other independent podcasters

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:08.340
in the other categories as well this is how we get the word of mouth out and I

01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:11.480
think independent podcasters should be working on promoting each

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:14.280
other not cutting each other down because then that's when the corporates

01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:17.800
will just sneak through and win I have plenty of bad things I have plenty of

01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:21.060
bad things I can say about corporate podcasts but I just I try not to be

01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:27.420
negative anyway sorry tangent my bad it's okay send me a bunch of cards

01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:32.420
Otacon is like in a month I'll pass them out all right and if there's any haters I

01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:36.020
want you to cut them for me of course all right what else is on your mind

01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:40.340
Rama okay there's a couple of things I spoke with Jamie about I need to tell

01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:45.780
you guys now there was talk sometime back about older Super NES games that

01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:51.020
had a load time and one of them was Street Fighter Alpha 2 okay there's

01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:56.220
another game I remember renting from the door it was Batman Returns every time

01:40:56.220 --> 01:41:00.700
you went to the next level it went to black and I said now loading two minutes

01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:05.980
later I'm in the next level for real yes Wow I don't I thought I played the

01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:10.800
Batman Returns game too wasn't that like a final fight type game sort of but it

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:15.960
was like really stick figures like streak of rage

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:19.160
interesting well i mean it wasn't again it was one of those movie franchise

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:20.760
games it wasn't that great

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:24.840
most movie franchise games kinda suck most but there are you know some that

01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:26.160
stand out but anyway

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.920
okay well that's

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.600
i wish that dark soccer was here to hear it but maybe she'll listen to the show

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:33.880
later and oh i already told her about that okay good

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.160
anything else on your mind

01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:38.120
you talk about how much you're a big fan of bubble bobble right

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:40.780
yes love bubble bobble and rainbow islands

01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:45.880
forget about the third game there was a bubble bubble three yes uh-huh and I

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:50.000
think there was no I think there was a legit bubble bubble to you think in

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:58.160
snow brothers nope okay what parasol stars oh three for a turbo graphic yeah

01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:01.000
I've played parasol stars I keep forgetting that's technically in the

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.800
bubble bubble world no they had a version of parasol stars I want to say

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:08.440
on Nintendo as well it was crap but it was there are you serious I want to say

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.880
I don't know if I am tip it might have been one of those really bad

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:17.400
Asian, you know, they're releasing bubble bubble revolution and the Rainbow Islands revolution for the DS pretty soon

01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.280
must have

01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.240
What

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.760
As long as partial stars is in there. I'll buy it

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:28.220
I know I it's not I I wish they would put these games in this unlocks

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:32.280
That's why I made sad faces when salamander wasn't in the gratis collections

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.440
You guys know as its life force if you don't deal with the import love life force

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:38.680
Yeah, that's like one of the best ones. It's not in the collection. Yes. I agree sad

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.320
bad Konami bet will you

01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:42.440
Mikotoff we

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:47.040
Know it's somebody for what because they didn't put salamander in the granny's collection salamander

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.040
I don't care. I'm okay. I care

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:53.320
Rabble rabble rabble Xbox Live arcade rabble rabble

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.520
No comment. All right

01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.680
Rama yeah anything else on your mind

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:02.680
Something to talk to Loki about.

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:09.680
Okay, Loki, you talked about last week how the anime video games aren't doing as successful as expected.

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:11.680
I can tell you one of the reasons why.

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:18.680
One of the reasons is because some of these games are already being played on import at anime cons,

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:22.680
and then when these companies bring them over, the main thing that the fans complain about,

01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:26.680
they want the Japanese voices, and they're originally taken out.

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:30.720
They take them all out and and the fans don't really want to buy them. Well, stop doing that

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.200
You don't know that's what they do. That's not in soul caliber. You can pick between the two

01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:40.480
I love that especially toshinden three. That's all my all-time favorites. Yeah, I

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:45.520
Mean I got narrow to fit ninja and I'm dealing with half the voices

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.680
I'm like, come on when they did that half ass

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.680
You know Yasha fighting game you had the option of Japanese and English voices

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:56.080
I mean when they did the 2d fighter from ps1, they threw us a bone. I'm like, come on

01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:59.760
Let's go for it. Well Rama this calls running long. We gotta let you go, buddy

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:02.180
We want to get some other folks in but thank you so much for the call. Have a good one

01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:07.160
Okay, I kind of took up most of your time. I apologize. No problem. It's all good. All right, you're on every week

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:09.160
Anyway, all right later

01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:14.880
All right, Skypline's open we'll take one more call I we don't have a lot of time for a lot of calls tonight

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:20.000
So one more call here's someone else who calls in every week. Hi, you're on Orange Lodge radio. Who's this Ravens dolphin?

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.840
Hi, what's on your mind Ravens dolphin? One thing do you do you like online rental games?

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:31.640
I know you've mentioned about pre-ordering how about going to the next stream online rental you talking about like game fly. Yeah

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:34.400
Um, I haven't used it myself

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:35.720
I use

01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:40.760
Netflix and I think that was a big mistake because I've had the same movies for about six weeks now because I've been doing so

01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:45.160
Much traveling lately. I haven't even watched them. My roommate uses a game fly. I think it's a good idea

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.200
I

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.960
It's hard for me to comment on it because I haven't really used it firsthand and I don't want to comment on something

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:55.760
I haven't used but it's something I I'm if I cancel my Netflix

01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:01.940
Which I'm probably going to I will probably shift over to gamefly because I just play more games than I watch movies

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:04.800
I just really well. What do you think do you use it? I?

01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:10.100
Just signed up day and I'm just trying it out. What do you think? What do you think so far?

01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:13.080
How was the setup online and everything and the ease of getting started?

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:15.800
plus

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:20.840
Super seamless, all you have to do is just create your game queue and they'll send it to you unlimited

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:27.100
And that's what I like because games are getting expensive Sony wants to put $100 to $50 per game now

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.560
You know, it's interesting. It's gonna be very interesting to see what the

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:39.040
Online rental market is gonna do to some of the game ideas. That's I guess this kind of stuff's getting bigger and bigger. So

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.000
Interesting. I am tempted to check it out

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:47.240
Why you know, we do we do a podcast that lots of people listen to can't one of these companies. Give us a free one

01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:19.240
But I can't remember it

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:26.760
All right. All right, buddy. Well, thanks for the call. Have a good one. Okay. All right. All right. Well, we'll see you later

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:29.680
Bye. Bye. Bye

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:32.400
Hmm. I found something interesting. What's that?

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:35.720
I found a picture of

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:42.120
An Xbox 360, uh-huh motherboard and they're saying that it's gonna get an HDMI out

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:46.120
out upgrade, and that they're putting an HDMI out port right next to the...

01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.120
Wait, no, bad! I already have an Xbox!

01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.120
Well...

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:50.120
Shit!

01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:52.120
So that, this is on Kotaku.

01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:57.120
Let's go trade them into GameStop, and then we can put that credit towards a new one.

01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:04.120
Not that I really need an HDMI out, but I think that's kind of interesting that they have that on there.

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:05.120
Alright.

01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:08.120
Well, any more stories anybody has? Loki?

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:09.120
I don't have anything.

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:15.600
anything? I don't think I have anything either. Alright, well then I think we're gonna go

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:19.580
ahead and wrap it up, so let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Shane, thank

01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:22.820
you for sitting in with us tonight. I noticed you actually put World of Warcraft away at

01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:27.140
some point. Yeah, it was annoying to play and listen to people talk. Oh, I'm sorry we

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:36.700
ruined your night. Final thought. Women shouldn't be allowed to vote. Oh, Loki, your final thought.

01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:40.480
My final thought is actually the official statement from Sony regarding the Apple logo

01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:41.620
on their site.

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:47.900
In a recent update to PlayStation 3's section of the US PlayStation.com website, an external

01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:52.940
error was made during the upload process and the Apple icon was mistakenly placed on the

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:53.940
site.

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:57.860
We immediately fixed the problem and apologized for any confusion this may have caused.

01:47:57.860 --> 01:47:59.140
They copied!

01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:04.440
They stole it from somebody, but they're not copping to it, Sony bad, Sony.

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.120
My final thought is I want ice cream.

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.560

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:22.480
What?

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:23.960
I actually have something I'm supposed to say on there.

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:24.960
What's that?

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:25.960
Okay.

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.480
I hate Sky is Cool.

01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:29.400
I think that's what I was supposed to say.

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:30.400
Okay.

01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:31.400
Thank you.
