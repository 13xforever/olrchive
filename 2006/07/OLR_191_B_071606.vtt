[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:05.895 --> 00:14.744
[SPEAKER_11]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.464 --> 00:19.088
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.582 --> 00:20.022
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio

00:49.551 --> 00:52.052
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I have a video game story I'd like to share first.

00:52.112 --> 00:53.133
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that okay, DarkSakura?

00:53.333 --> 00:53.993
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about the Wii!

00:54.653 --> 00:55.194
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

00:55.274 --> 00:55.594
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

00:56.534 --> 00:57.175
[SPEAKER_12]: This is interesting.

00:57.595 --> 01:04.218
[SPEAKER_12]: Toys R Us in Australia is taking pre-orders for the Wii at what equates to $249 US.

01:04.878 --> 01:08.900
[SPEAKER_12]: But what's very interesting about this deal is that that comes with a free game.

01:09.260 --> 01:12.502
[SPEAKER_12]: So folks are speculating that this is pretty much proving...

01:12.782 --> 01:13.503
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:30.157 --> 01:31.198
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect Pack and Title.

01:31.238 --> 01:35.602
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be for the Wii because that would give you a little taste of everything what the Wii can do.

01:36.182 --> 01:40.206
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, if you think about it, that's one thing that they kind of sold to the Nintendo press conference as well.

01:40.586 --> 01:42.748
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember that guy who won the contest?

01:43.028 --> 01:46.912
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember when they flew all those guys to LA and then only let one come up on stage to play?

01:47.632 --> 01:49.554
[SPEAKER_12]: It was Wii Sports, the tennis game.

01:49.954 --> 01:52.917
[SPEAKER_12]: And Wii Tennis, I mean, it's fun, but it's not...

01:53.522 --> 01:54.142
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:19.218 --> 02:20.998
[SPEAKER_02]: That you could just put on this collection.

02:21.078 --> 02:22.819
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe not even call it Wii Sports.

02:22.859 --> 02:25.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Just have it, I don't know, be something.

02:26.560 --> 02:30.261
[SPEAKER_12]: Mori in our chatroom seems to think that World Class TrackMe needs to have a Wii version.

02:32.581 --> 02:35.582
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly think that Wii Sports sort of smacks of the Super Scope games.

02:36.722 --> 02:37.102
[SPEAKER_07]: How so?

02:37.702 --> 02:43.924
[SPEAKER_07]: It just had the multi-games to show off the different things you could play with the Super Scope, like Blastress and that really weird mole game.

02:44.504 --> 02:45.724
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I like the mole game, though.

02:45.844 --> 02:46.844
[SPEAKER_07]: It just makes me think of that.

02:47.225 --> 02:48.805
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

02:48.825 --> 02:48.865
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

02:49.690 --> 02:51.671
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well that's all I have to say on that story for the Wii.

02:52.111 --> 02:59.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well speaking of the Wii, there's been another secret flap that's been spotted.

02:59.454 --> 03:02.615
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, is this like the third or fourth secret flap that's on the Wii?

03:03.535 --> 03:09.818
[SPEAKER_12]: Boy, the Wii must sure be feeling like it's getting violated all over left and right with people looking in every flap they can find.

03:09.858 --> 03:11.138
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii has compartments everywhere.

03:11.278 --> 03:11.598
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

03:12.039 --> 03:14.419
[SPEAKER_02]: But no idea what it is.

03:15.220 --> 03:17.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like a SD card port, but...

03:19.195 --> 03:20.915
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really odd position for it.

03:20.975 --> 03:21.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it that way.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.056
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I think it is?

03:24.736 --> 03:26.716
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might be just nothing.

03:27.537 --> 03:30.197
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just maybe... It's a flap for nothing?

03:30.317 --> 03:31.977
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it actually is not a flap.

03:32.017 --> 03:38.759
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just kind of a hole that would be for... Because it's at the very, very bottom of the console.

03:38.979 --> 03:46.220
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if this were going to be in their little docking bay or whatever it is, I don't think you'd be able to...

03:48.064 --> 03:57.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Access this panel, but my guess is it's probably just for the docking stations, probably a clip, you know, so the whole thing snaps in so it doesn't come loose.

03:58.428 --> 03:59.388
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my thought on that.

03:59.488 --> 03:59.848
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

04:00.628 --> 04:01.469
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea what it is.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.309
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be honest, I don't care.

04:03.569 --> 04:05.990
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like some super-duper secret thing.

04:06.290 --> 04:08.591
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, VR is hidden in the tiny little thing right there.

04:08.691 --> 04:12.553
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I don't think these flaps are going to have these earth-shattering new features.

04:12.613 --> 04:16.674
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's just going to be for plugs, cards, you know, things you can stick in your Wii.

04:17.602 --> 04:24.024
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, yeah, even looking at this right now, the actual picture that they show of this said flap doesn't even look like a flap.

04:24.504 --> 04:30.927
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looks like a part in the console where it might snap in.

04:31.367 --> 04:32.387
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it is.

04:32.907 --> 04:33.087
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

04:34.328 --> 04:34.588
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

04:35.188 --> 04:43.191
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, DarkSakura, I know you have some stuff you want to share with the Wii with us, too, but I also understand you have a special shout-out you want to give, so please get that out before you move on.

04:44.198 --> 04:48.079
[SPEAKER_07]: To one of, actually, my really good friend's friend.

04:48.940 --> 04:49.780
[SPEAKER_07]: Her name is Larissa.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.081
[SPEAKER_07]: She was in a car accident a few days ago.

04:52.121 --> 04:54.621
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to give a big shout out.

04:55.702 --> 04:59.003
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think she's listening, being that she's currently in the hospital.

04:59.063 --> 05:05.205
[SPEAKER_07]: But for anyone who's listening, who knows her, pass on that we wish her a very quick recovery and glad she's coming out of it okay.

05:05.625 --> 05:06.185
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

05:06.305 --> 05:10.246
[SPEAKER_12]: Hope you get out of the hospital fast, because I know hospitals are not a fun place to be.

05:10.306 --> 05:11.227
[SPEAKER_12]: So please get well soon.

05:11.647 --> 05:12.067
[SPEAKER_07]: Very much.

05:13.393 --> 05:24.140
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as far as the story that I have, there's actually some more games being mentioned that's coming out for Wii, actually specifically from EA.

05:25.060 --> 05:32.425
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's also Need for Speed Carbon and Madden NFL, but they're also announcing Tiger Woods, Godfather, SSX, and Harry Potter coming out.

05:33.686 --> 05:34.527
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't mind, you know.

05:34.847 --> 05:37.630
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, goody, am I going to get to cast spells with the Wii controller?

05:37.810 --> 05:40.552
[SPEAKER_07]: That would actually be cool, you know, if you have to wave it a certain way.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.254
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the little... You're a Harry Potter nerd.

05:42.274 --> 05:44.816
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the little spell... Give me some of the spells they say.

05:44.876 --> 05:47.639
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, what makes the light... Luminos or something.

05:47.659 --> 05:48.119
[SPEAKER_12]: What do they say?

05:48.139 --> 05:48.539
[SPEAKER_06]: Lumos.

05:48.800 --> 05:49.220
[SPEAKER_12]: Lumos?

05:49.460 --> 05:49.720
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

05:49.740 --> 05:50.821
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you imagine being able to do that?

05:51.142 --> 05:53.144
[SPEAKER_12]: And if the Wii had a microphone in it, too?

05:53.164 --> 05:53.924
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be perfect.

05:54.845 --> 05:55.726
[SPEAKER_06]: Use voice recognition.

05:55.746 --> 05:56.286
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my gosh.

05:56.567 --> 05:59.029
[SPEAKER_12]: Harry Potter fangirls everywhere are going to, like...

05:59.690 --> 06:00.150
[SPEAKER_12]: Never Leave the House.

06:00.170 --> 06:01.591
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that going to be a microphone attachment?

06:02.091 --> 06:04.732
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they say that the Wii... Well, I don't think it's confirmed.

06:04.752 --> 06:05.632
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a speaker in it.

06:05.672 --> 06:11.935
[SPEAKER_12]: We all know that from E3, but it's rumored that a speaker could easily be a microphone, so why not have a microphone on it, too?

06:11.995 --> 06:16.077
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we have confirmation on that yet, though, but imagine if it did have a microphone.

06:16.117 --> 06:24.380
[SPEAKER_12]: You could, you know, say, you know, Luminos and move the thing, and then you might even hear the spell come from the wand, and it would even vibrate.

06:24.700 --> 06:25.661
[SPEAKER_12]: How crazy is that?

06:25.781 --> 06:26.561
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be special.

06:27.558 --> 06:28.698
[SPEAKER_02]: Special Ed.

06:29.178 --> 06:34.799
[SPEAKER_02]: You might need to go Ruminous for it to... It doesn't understand some of the... That's right.

06:34.879 --> 06:37.420
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's going to be like brain training where you have to say, Brew!

06:37.940 --> 06:38.340
[SPEAKER_12]: Brew!

06:38.860 --> 06:39.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Ruminous!

06:39.300 --> 06:39.820
[SPEAKER_12]: I swear it works.

06:39.880 --> 06:40.541
[SPEAKER_12]: I swear it works.

06:40.561 --> 06:43.141
[SPEAKER_12]: Go back to the OLR archives where I review brain training.

06:43.461 --> 06:44.101
[SPEAKER_12]: It really works.

06:44.141 --> 06:49.382
[SPEAKER_12]: If you are having a hard time getting your DS to understand you saying Brew, say Brew, and it works every time.

06:50.062 --> 06:50.503
[SPEAKER_12]: At least for me.

06:50.763 --> 06:51.423
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

06:51.963 --> 06:52.943
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty awesome.

06:54.357 --> 06:56.419
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those games I'm actually pretty cool.

06:56.559 --> 06:58.021
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder how SXX is going to control.

06:58.582 --> 07:00.204
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Godfather you could just go around shooting people.

07:00.624 --> 07:05.770
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's really interesting with all these Wii game announcements that our first thoughts are, I wonder what it's going to play like on the Wii.

07:05.810 --> 07:11.117
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder what that controller is going to do for that game or how that's going to be different because of that whole Wii thing.

07:11.477 --> 07:19.681
[SPEAKER_12]: This is very interesting how... I hope they're good because all it's going to take is a couple games that suck with that kind of controller configuration for people to go, ah, damn it.

07:19.741 --> 07:21.681
[SPEAKER_12]: But every console has shitty games.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.122
[SPEAKER_12]: I say the other way around.

07:23.242 --> 07:27.504
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have a few stellar games, it's really going to sell that console.

07:27.724 --> 07:30.665
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of crap games on every console.

07:31.085 --> 07:32.226
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't ruin it for them.

07:32.626 --> 07:39.189
[SPEAKER_12]: PS2, wonderful console, legendary console will be remembered for years and years, has some real shit games on it.

07:39.882 --> 07:41.303
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's something that's occurring to me?

07:41.963 --> 07:45.424
[SPEAKER_07]: There's mentioning a Tiger Woods game, but what's stopping them from making MoCap Golf?

07:46.845 --> 07:48.265
[SPEAKER_07]: Or even Police 911?

07:49.426 --> 07:49.826
[SPEAKER_07]: With the Wii?

07:50.686 --> 07:50.986
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe?

07:52.267 --> 07:56.168
[SPEAKER_07]: I think those are franchises that our developer friends should be looking into.

07:56.673 --> 08:12.848
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of the Wii, though, and other fun things about it, IGN has actually come in contact with a Wii developer documentation, like kind of a little pamphlet that basically explains to developers how the Wii works and some of the fun little details about it.

08:14.338 --> 08:22.103
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that's pretty interesting is there's going to be six kilobytes of non-volatile memory in each controller.

08:22.983 --> 08:31.088
[SPEAKER_02]: And the speculation is that it's possible that that will be for storing player settings.

08:31.408 --> 08:38.032
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a person that uses Controller 1 all the time, it's going to remember your settings, and that's kind of neat.

08:40.287 --> 08:47.729
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, they're also mentioning that the sensor bar itself is only going to be about 20 centimeters long.

08:48.589 --> 08:56.652
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty much the LEDs, I guess, on the Wii controller and stuff are going to be for battery life and show you that kind of stuff.

08:57.352 --> 09:05.474
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that light sources from fluorescent halogen plastic mirrors and many more interfere with the actual pointer.

09:05.979 --> 09:06.479
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, interesting.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.542
[SPEAKER_02]: But to eliminate this, though, the actual... Don't play in a spaceship.

09:11.263 --> 09:16.446
[SPEAKER_02]: No, to eliminate this, it says the pointer must identify the sensor bar and mark its two coordinates.

09:16.947 --> 09:28.055
[SPEAKER_02]: And when pointing with the Wiimote, the unit is actually interfacing with the sensor bar, which translates the data to the television and, in effect, simulating a direct aim to the television.

09:28.075 --> 09:28.115
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

09:29.579 --> 09:41.532
[SPEAKER_02]: In a sense, it's basically comparing it to an eye measuring the coordinates between 0 and 1023 on the x-axis and 0 and 767 on the y-axis.

09:41.652 --> 09:45.797
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically seeing a megapixel image or something like that.

09:45.977 --> 09:46.958
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of neat.

09:47.939 --> 09:50.102
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says the pointer could sub as a camera.

09:50.993 --> 09:52.614
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably like a Pokemon Snap game.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.935
[SPEAKER_12]: Boy, that controller will do your dishes pretty soon with all these things they keep saying.

09:56.035 --> 10:04.057
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait for the third party controllers to come out and you know some perverted Japanese company out there is going to turn like Wii controller and sex toy.

10:05.118 --> 10:05.638
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to happen.

10:05.678 --> 10:06.738
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello Kitty Wii.

10:08.399 --> 10:08.759
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

10:09.959 --> 10:15.901
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, Nintendo, one of their biggest franchises is Pokemon and still after all these years, Pokemon has some very loyal fans.

10:16.702 --> 10:17.542
[SPEAKER_12]: Very, very loyal fans.

10:17.884 --> 10:23.507
[SPEAKER_12]: Diamond and Pearl is coming out very soon, and a lot of folks have been asking, when is Pokemon going to go online?

10:23.567 --> 10:26.208
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it looks like it's going to be happening soon.

10:26.268 --> 10:33.652
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some scans from Famitsu that show Pokemon Diamond and Pearl with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection logo.

10:34.512 --> 10:41.456
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, they have said before that the game would support Wi-Fi, but it was unclear if that meant local Wi-Fi or internet Wi-Fi.

10:42.023 --> 10:42.584
[SPEAKER_12]: Internet Wi-Fi

11:00.768 --> 11:01.848
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:30.919 --> 11:31.959
[SPEAKER_12]: To make an MMO out of?

11:32.039 --> 11:32.560
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, really?

11:32.840 --> 11:35.161
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, go out, collect monsters, fight other trainers?

11:35.481 --> 11:37.361
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a matter of finding a good concept.

11:37.561 --> 11:38.682
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't it kind of surprising?

11:39.022 --> 11:40.242
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it is and it isn't.

11:40.262 --> 11:42.123
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo really doesn't do MMOs.

11:42.143 --> 11:42.763
[SPEAKER_12]: They never have.

11:43.223 --> 11:47.425
[SPEAKER_12]: But really, here's the perfect opportunity for them to get into the MMO.

11:47.465 --> 11:48.926
[SPEAKER_12]: And I bet it would be a really big game.

11:49.466 --> 11:51.947
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder why they're holding back.

11:51.987 --> 11:54.728
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, maybe the Wii will see something new.

11:54.808 --> 11:56.988
[SPEAKER_12]: But do you think Pokemon could work as an MMO?

11:57.449 --> 11:57.769
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

11:57.789 --> 11:58.509
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like Pokemon.

11:59.417 --> 12:00.318
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would work very well

12:23.124 --> 12:23.564
[SPEAKER_12]: Pokemon Snap

12:52.020 --> 12:53.061
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Pokemon Snap.

12:53.821 --> 12:56.383
[SPEAKER_12]: Pokemon's a great concept, the whole monster collecting.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.204
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's a great franchise.

12:59.705 --> 13:02.026
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the cartoon, I may be over it now.

13:02.046 --> 13:04.748
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to watch the cartoon a long time ago, and I think I'm kind of over it now.

13:05.842 --> 13:07.062
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'd watch it once in a while.

13:07.122 --> 13:07.823
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a funny thing.

13:07.983 --> 13:09.323
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a stoner cartoon now.

13:10.183 --> 13:10.683
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

13:10.763 --> 13:11.404
[SPEAKER_12]: I could see that.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.524
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, man, he's talking!

13:13.604 --> 13:14.865
[SPEAKER_12]: Pikachu!

13:14.965 --> 13:15.825
[SPEAKER_12]: Pikachu!

13:15.865 --> 13:16.765
[SPEAKER_12]: Pikachu!

13:17.485 --> 13:17.745
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

13:17.785 --> 13:18.105
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.766
[SPEAKER_12]: But the games are neat.

13:20.646 --> 13:24.987
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem is, for me, the games have so much more potential than what Nintendo's doing with it.

13:25.647 --> 13:26.428
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just my opinion.

13:26.588 --> 13:26.888
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

13:27.328 --> 13:28.268
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Pokemon Pinball, though.

13:29.164 --> 13:29.784
[SPEAKER_12]: Neo Geo Battle Coliseum

13:53.986 --> 13:54.487
[SPEAKER_07]: What am I saying?

13:54.507 --> 13:55.808
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a fangirl of just about any game.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.750
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be getting it by Ignition.

13:58.790 --> 14:03.353
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually going to be out in Europe on PS2 in the autumn.

14:05.515 --> 14:12.720
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically what Battle Coliseum is, it's a fighting in which players use different characters from a range of SNK.

14:14.101 --> 14:19.926
[SPEAKER_07]: Different games like World of Heroes, Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown, Last Blade, Metal Slug, Kizuna Encounter.

14:21.813 --> 14:27.576
[SPEAKER_07]: and you'll have your regular fighting modes, but you'll also have tag battle.

14:28.057 --> 14:30.578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of making me think of King of Fighters, but not quite.

14:30.998 --> 14:46.487
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a rumor of six different hidden characters, but it's actually going to be out with other games like King of Fighters 11, King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2, SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters, and Metal Slug Anthology.

14:46.507 --> 14:50.710
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be awesome as if that game, one of the hidden fighters, is Magical Lord.

14:51.971 --> 14:52.471
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that game?

14:52.531 --> 14:53.372
[SPEAKER_02]: That game was awesome.

14:54.832 --> 15:01.456
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I used to play when they had those Neo Geo machines down at Rayleigh's or something like that.

15:01.496 --> 15:03.097
[SPEAKER_07]: We need hidden characters to be Bub and Bob.

15:03.497 --> 15:04.277
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they need to do?

15:04.457 --> 15:11.921
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to take this and kind of make another Capcom vs. SNK and actually put some of the characters like Mel's characters and stuff.

15:12.741 --> 15:17.484
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been hearing rumors about DC vs. Capcom.

15:18.384 --> 15:19.265
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.

15:20.265 --> 15:21.706
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's still a rumor, but

15:22.903 --> 15:26.226
[SPEAKER_07]: They should actually do DC vs. Marvel as a fighting game.

15:26.406 --> 15:27.247
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be tough.

15:27.307 --> 15:30.930
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think either one of those comic companies would want to do something like that.

15:31.050 --> 15:32.852
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure Capcom would love to make that game.

15:33.112 --> 15:34.494
[SPEAKER_07]: They were together before.

15:35.114 --> 15:40.119
[SPEAKER_12]: Eddie in our chatroom seems to think that the listeners should rally together to make an Orange Lounge radio card game.

15:41.826 --> 15:42.586
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think there's enough.

15:42.786 --> 15:43.967
[SPEAKER_07]: Our own collectible card game.

15:44.007 --> 15:47.468
[SPEAKER_12]: You would have to really go back into the show's history to get enough people.

15:47.648 --> 15:59.333
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, granted, there's the three of us that host the show, and obviously Mikotov's here half the time, and even in recent memory we've had some other guests, but really we haven't had the orgy of guests we used to have during some of our live shows back in the day.

15:59.653 --> 16:01.614
[SPEAKER_12]: You'd have to way go back to some of our old members.

16:01.854 --> 16:03.455
[SPEAKER_07]: They do it in Magic, where you have your fire...

16:06.772 --> 16:08.273
[SPEAKER_12]: Fire Jamie, Earth Jamie Battle of the Portable Systems

16:33.066 --> 16:36.969
[SPEAKER_02]: The DS has actually overtaken the PSP in sales in the United States.

16:37.449 --> 16:44.314
[SPEAKER_02]: So, now Sony can't brag that the PSP is at least winning in the United States because they're getting their ass handed to them now.

16:45.595 --> 16:57.063
[SPEAKER_02]: Sales, though, overall in video games have gone up about 25%, but in the sold units, as far as the two consoles are concerned, the Nintendo DS is right now over $5,200.

17:00.922 --> 17:01.883
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP is currently at 4.7 million units.

17:19.642 --> 17:25.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically the DS Lite kind of pushed them over the limit there.

17:26.265 --> 17:28.987
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of new games, of course, coming out for the DS.

17:29.367 --> 17:35.110
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, the PSP hasn't had that many great releases lately, so it's kind of hurting.

17:35.330 --> 17:38.171
[SPEAKER_02]: But you watch when Vice City Stories comes out.

17:38.331 --> 17:38.791
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

17:39.592 --> 17:47.936
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, beyond that, though, the Xbox 360 has finally reached 2 million units in the United States about time.

17:49.264 --> 18:18.851
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course the Playstation 2 is still selling pretty strong they sold another 300,000 units in June alone and puts the total up to about 34 million units in the United States which is almost as many Game Boy Advance units out there they're up to almost 33 million Game Boy Advance of course now if you think about it how many Game Boy Advance systems have there been I mean there's tons of different reiterations so that's pretty cool that sounds pretty cool

18:20.034 --> 18:26.776
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as far as things that are coming out, we actually have our Europe release dates, if anybody is interested.

18:27.536 --> 18:29.896
[SPEAKER_07]: I know our European listeners would probably be very interested.

18:30.016 --> 18:44.679
[SPEAKER_12]: I've noticed we've actually had an increase in the amount of listeners coming from Europe lately, and part of the reason for that, as I understand it, is that folks over there are very appreciative that we are an American gaming show that is willing to acknowledge that there's other people around the world that play video games.

18:44.759 --> 18:47.960
[SPEAKER_12]: So, thank you guys for recognizing what we try to recognize.

18:48.467 --> 18:49.948
[SPEAKER_07]: I love hearing from our UK listeners.

18:49.968 --> 18:50.388
[SPEAKER_07]: They're great.

18:50.488 --> 18:51.308
[SPEAKER_12]: I love hearing from everywhere.

18:51.329 --> 18:52.229
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't have to be UK.

18:52.249 --> 18:53.570
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be anywhere.

18:53.970 --> 18:57.832
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gotten emails from all over the world and I'm always looking forward to it.

18:58.032 --> 18:59.933
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially Canada lately because I was just there.

19:01.594 --> 19:02.774
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm on a Canada kick lately.

19:02.914 --> 19:03.435
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Canada.

19:03.815 --> 19:05.596
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to give you one of the maple cookies I got there.

19:05.716 --> 19:06.316
[SPEAKER_12]: So good.

19:06.396 --> 19:06.656
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

19:06.736 --> 19:08.797
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go get one right now while you do the next story.

19:11.019 --> 19:11.579
[SPEAKER_07]: Addict, huh?

19:12.659 --> 19:12.960
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.301
[SPEAKER_07]: What we have coming out though, just a handful of games on the 21st.

19:16.321 --> 19:16.361
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh,

19:18.360 --> 19:20.121
[SPEAKER_07]: The following three are on PSP.

19:20.161 --> 19:29.224
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Def Jam, Fight for New York, The Takeover, Field Commander, Me Sneezing, and no, Jamie Sneezing the game isn't.

19:29.344 --> 19:29.664
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

19:30.244 --> 19:30.644
[SPEAKER_07]: Cookie.

19:31.004 --> 19:31.224
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

19:31.945 --> 19:32.165
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

19:32.545 --> 19:34.125
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, oh, God, I smell like syrup.

19:34.805 --> 19:35.546
[SPEAKER_12]: They're hella good.

19:35.646 --> 19:36.266
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, guys.

19:36.546 --> 19:37.026
[SPEAKER_12]: Back to game.

19:37.106 --> 19:38.007
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

19:38.027 --> 19:39.307
[SPEAKER_12]: These cookies are the shit.

19:39.987 --> 19:40.847
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we have another list.

19:40.887 --> 19:42.528
[SPEAKER_12]: I think one of our listeners is in Vancouver.

19:42.568 --> 19:44.109
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to make him send me more of these cookies.

19:44.389 --> 19:45.349
[SPEAKER_12]: They are so freaking good.

19:46.377 --> 19:46.897
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, sorry.

19:47.037 --> 19:48.017
[SPEAKER_07]: My eyes are rolling back in my head.

19:48.037 --> 19:48.658
[SPEAKER_07]: They are good.

19:48.678 --> 19:48.938
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

19:49.338 --> 19:49.678
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

19:50.318 --> 19:51.078
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was saying.

19:51.698 --> 19:52.558
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, UK listeners.

19:53.939 --> 19:58.080
[SPEAKER_07]: For PSP, we have Def Jam, Fight for New York, The Takeover, Field Commander, and Infected.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.100
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out on PlayStation 2, we have Super World Police.

20:03.241 --> 20:11.423
[SPEAKER_07]: Some things to look forward to, though, the next week is Juiced Eliminator, Pac-Man World 3, Civ 4, Civ City Rome.

20:12.903 --> 20:13.243
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of...

20:13.891 --> 20:14.891
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty cool stuff coming out.

20:14.971 --> 20:18.732
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Shin Megami Tensei and The Ant Bully.

20:20.032 --> 20:20.472
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

20:21.353 --> 20:22.813
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Miami Vice is on here.

20:23.153 --> 20:23.773
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the point?

20:24.253 --> 20:25.654
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing a Miami Vice movie.

20:25.674 --> 20:26.374
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's movie time.

20:26.654 --> 20:28.094
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but still, what's the point?

20:29.354 --> 20:31.955
[SPEAKER_07]: Pastel suits should have stayed gone in the 80s.

20:32.415 --> 20:34.016
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's my tangent.

20:35.196 --> 20:35.496
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

20:36.236 --> 20:39.377
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, in the U.S., similar stuff.

20:40.037 --> 20:40.577
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot.

20:41.328 --> 20:51.794
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you are ready for some football, NCAA Football 07 is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and the PSP.

20:52.454 --> 20:53.515
[SPEAKER_02]: So check those out.

20:53.995 --> 21:01.099
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not a fan of football, you may be a fan of CG animated movies, in which case Monster House will be the game for you.

21:01.199 --> 21:07.423
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes out on PlayStation 2, GameCube, the DS, and the Game Boy Advance.

21:08.170 --> 21:13.454
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not a fan of either of those, maybe you're a fan of Super Dragon Ball Z, which is coming out on PlayStation 2.

21:14.836 --> 21:24.123
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, of course, there's Blade Dancer on the PSP, Valkyrie Profile, Lineth, which is a remake of the very first Valkyrie Profile on the PSP.

21:24.583 --> 21:28.086
[SPEAKER_02]: And Miami Vice is also coming out on the PSP.

21:28.126 --> 21:31.569
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a PSP-only title, which was kind of interesting, but it looks pretty decent.

21:31.729 --> 21:33.391
[SPEAKER_02]: So be sure to check it out.

21:36.913 --> 21:37.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

21:40.131 --> 21:44.173
[SPEAKER_12]: and... Did you want to say something on The Sims 2?

21:44.353 --> 21:45.094
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm sorry.

21:46.374 --> 21:48.215
[SPEAKER_12]: I did want to mention something.

21:48.515 --> 21:53.418
[SPEAKER_12]: We have two listeners from Vancouver in chat, so I'm reminiscing my trip and telling them where to get the cookies.

21:53.886 --> 21:55.267
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie and I are eating right now.

21:55.287 --> 21:58.030
[SPEAKER_12]: Those cookies are addicting.

21:58.070 --> 21:58.930
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a farmer's market.

21:58.950 --> 22:00.972
[SPEAKER_12]: They do this little island called Granville Island.

22:01.553 --> 22:01.853
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

22:01.873 --> 22:03.154
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry to turn this into cookie chat.

22:03.174 --> 22:05.736
[SPEAKER_12]: Just do your game thing.

22:05.936 --> 22:07.898
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I would like to talk about something.

22:08.538 --> 22:11.341
[SPEAKER_02]: GameSpot actually, they had their kind of retail radar thing.

22:11.941 --> 22:20.789
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was actually a rumor control article that they had about during E3, EA had a game coming out called Sims 2 Pets.

22:21.548 --> 22:47.355
[SPEAKER_02]: and Sims 2 Pets was supposed to be this PC only kind of almost like an expansion for the Sims 2 but I can confirm now today that Sims 2 Pets is actually coming to the consoles and you'll be able to play that here pretty soon it is coming coming out here I believe was it towards the fourth quarter and

22:48.834 --> 22:49.455
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

23:12.635 --> 23:14.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to try and murder the pets like you murder people?

23:14.416 --> 23:15.917
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to check this game out.

23:16.117 --> 23:24.843
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially on the PC, because if you can kill it... I mean, granted, that's morbid, but I killed the Sims, so... You know, GS191 in chat has an excellent point, though.

23:25.223 --> 23:26.544
[SPEAKER_12]: He has a message to EA here.

23:26.684 --> 23:28.625
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop making the Sims and work on Spore.

23:30.466 --> 23:31.667
[SPEAKER_12]: They are working on Spore.

23:32.107 --> 23:33.248
[SPEAKER_12]: But I like Spore more.

23:33.628 --> 23:36.910
[SPEAKER_12]: Even from the demos I've seen, I'm like, Spore!

23:37.370 --> 23:39.051
[SPEAKER_12]: Need Spore now!

23:39.651 --> 23:40.312
[SPEAKER_12]: Give it to me!

23:41.238 --> 23:43.600
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, that game is going to be a serious crack for people.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.461
[SPEAKER_12]: If you think The Sims is bad, just wait for Spore.

23:46.621 --> 23:47.082
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm telling you.

23:47.102 --> 23:49.923
[SPEAKER_12]: Spore is... That's all people are going to be talking about next year.

23:50.103 --> 23:54.546
[SPEAKER_02]: People in China are going to be killing themselves for spending too much time on there.

23:54.566 --> 23:59.249
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to leave babies in hot cars and not feed them and all that fun stuff.

24:00.165 --> 24:01.486
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:20.702 --> 24:21.663
[SPEAKER_12]: Mario stuff.

24:21.703 --> 24:23.965
[SPEAKER_12]: But here, they're putting these characters into the game.

24:24.405 --> 24:30.850
[SPEAKER_12]: Moogle, White Mage, Ninja, Black Mage, and a Cactar named Sabotender.

24:31.310 --> 24:34.553
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're not sure quite what that means yet, but at least you're getting a Cactar.

24:34.613 --> 24:35.253
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of cool.

24:35.573 --> 24:38.636
[SPEAKER_12]: Makes me think of this great overlooked PS1 title.

24:38.676 --> 24:39.717
[SPEAKER_12]: At least I like this game.

24:39.757 --> 24:43.379
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think a lot of people did, but Chocobo Racing was a game they had on PS1.

24:43.439 --> 24:45.000
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of like a Mario Kart type game.

24:45.341 --> 24:49.184
[SPEAKER_12]: But you could be like White Mage or Black Mage or a Chocobo and you could actually unlock...

24:49.983 --> 24:53.944
[SPEAKER_12]: You could unlock Squall, I think was one, and I want to say you got Cloud at some point, too.

24:54.264 --> 24:55.244
[SPEAKER_12]: You could unlock all these characters.

24:55.264 --> 24:56.445
[SPEAKER_12]: It was actually a fun little racer.

24:56.825 --> 24:59.226
[SPEAKER_12]: I really wish they'd revisit that concept.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.086
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was a cute little game.

25:02.586 --> 25:08.668
[SPEAKER_02]: My message to Square and Nintendo, stop working on Mario Hoops.

25:09.288 --> 25:10.849
[SPEAKER_02]: No one cares about Mario Hoops.

25:11.609 --> 25:14.590
[SPEAKER_02]: I care about a new Super Mario RPG.

25:15.010 --> 25:18.391
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Nintendo and Square Enix should be working on, is not...

25:19.321 --> 25:20.922
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid basketball game, whatever.

25:22.702 --> 25:23.282
[SPEAKER_02]: But fine.

25:23.542 --> 25:24.883
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they're doing something new.

25:25.163 --> 25:26.123
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't complain, I guess.

25:26.563 --> 25:27.544
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will.

25:27.884 --> 25:28.444
[SPEAKER_02]: I will complain.

25:29.464 --> 25:31.765
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, on a completely different topic, though.

25:32.185 --> 25:34.506
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually kind of follows with more complaining.

25:35.727 --> 25:44.690
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the ex-frag dolls are attacking the whole sponsorships of gaming teams and Girl Gamers topic.

25:44.890 --> 25:46.750
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of interesting, though.

25:47.931 --> 25:48.611
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically...

25:49.346 --> 25:55.809
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote here from them, Although we may have strong opinions, you can be sure of one thing.

25:55.909 --> 25:58.430
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not here to endorse any product or sell you anything.

25:58.810 --> 26:02.672
[SPEAKER_02]: If we say it, it's because we mean it, not because it pays our wage.

26:03.092 --> 26:13.877
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of, you know, basically attacking the frag dolls and those girl gaming teams, especially the ones that are sponsored by Ubisoft or Microsoft, etc.

26:14.037 --> 26:16.058
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I'm going to get back more into this here.

26:17.728 --> 26:24.371
[SPEAKER_02]: On a similar note, we may be both girls who game, but we are not here to wave the girl gamer flag.

26:24.411 --> 26:29.773
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe that drawing attention to the gender, you create a barrier that's otherwise irrelevant.

26:30.133 --> 26:43.839
[SPEAKER_02]: In our experience, promoting girl gamers can often be used as a cover story of big business, but trying to widen its market share while still getting some pretty faces in the magazines.

26:43.900 --> 26:45.500
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, free advertising.

26:45.660 --> 26:46.901
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they're kind of a

26:47.605 --> 26:52.408
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out and saying that these girl gamer groups are nothing more than a marketing ploy and they suck.

26:55.811 --> 26:57.652
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really know what to think about all this stuff anymore.

26:57.812 --> 27:00.274
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just like, just shut up and play games.

27:00.614 --> 27:00.935
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.

27:00.955 --> 27:05.978
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I want to tell a lot of these people, you know, the people that are passionate on both sides of it is like, make it about the games.

27:06.478 --> 27:07.379
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just go back to the games.

27:08.060 --> 27:11.242
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, when it needs to come back down to, it needs to come to

27:11.943 --> 27:12.744
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

27:32.151 --> 27:36.714
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be all that matters, unfortunately, if you are on the receiving end of the discrimination.

27:37.375 --> 27:44.461
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but as a homosexual, I've been on somewhat the receiving end of that discrimination before, too.

27:44.982 --> 27:47.784
[SPEAKER_12]: Having to put up with a lot of MMOs, you know, that's gay and this is gay.

27:48.084 --> 27:55.711
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't let that kind of talk really get to me, but I know that it's tough for any type of minority, really.

27:56.071 --> 27:57.933
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know.

27:57.973 --> 27:59.254
[SPEAKER_12]: At the same time, it's like,

28:00.083 --> 28:06.907
[SPEAKER_12]: Because of the internet, in a way, people can be people that they're really not, at least in an MMO.

28:06.947 --> 28:08.808
[SPEAKER_12]: Guys can play girls, girls can play guys.

28:08.848 --> 28:12.110
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a great way for everybody to be anonymous.

28:12.170 --> 28:14.751
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't know what's sitting behind an Xbox Live gamer tag.

28:14.791 --> 28:19.174
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, you can hear a voice, but even then, some people play Xbox Live and don't use their voice.

28:19.314 --> 28:19.814
[SPEAKER_07]: Or mask it.

28:20.374 --> 28:22.596
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you can't do that on 360, but the old school one you could.

28:22.616 --> 28:23.056
[SPEAKER_07]: On the old one, yeah.

28:23.176 --> 28:23.417
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

28:23.797 --> 28:24.377
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it was awful.

28:24.518 --> 28:29.321
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I knew a guy in college that had a really, really high-pitched voice and sounded like a girl.

28:30.762 --> 28:35.826
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and a lot of Xbox Live sounds like that, too, where you don't know what gender it is because it's so ridiculous.

28:35.906 --> 28:38.108
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to poke you, noob.

28:38.128 --> 28:39.789
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you can't tell really what they're saying.

28:39.809 --> 28:40.890
[SPEAKER_02]: They all sound the same.

28:40.970 --> 28:41.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody sounds the same.

28:42.692 --> 28:48.156
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, if it's on PSO, you get your own feedback first before you hear everybody else's.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.581
[SPEAKER_12]: and join the OL Army.

28:50.861 --> 28:54.763
[SPEAKER_12]: We're all about, you know, just shut up and play the game.

28:54.823 --> 28:59.105
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter what you look like, who you sleep with, what gender you are.

28:59.165 --> 28:59.666
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter.

28:59.826 --> 29:00.266
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.547
[SPEAKER_12]: Just play a game and have fun and don't be a dick.

29:03.187 --> 29:03.748
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

29:03.808 --> 29:04.628
[SPEAKER_12]: And speaking of the OL Army.

29:04.648 --> 29:05.909
[SPEAKER_12]: That's rule number one of the OL Army.

29:05.949 --> 29:06.489
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't be a dick.

29:07.810 --> 29:08.350
[SPEAKER_12]: Or a twat.

29:09.591 --> 29:11.252
[SPEAKER_12]: He said twat.

29:11.332 --> 29:14.773
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of things, though, that are super cool.

29:14.973 --> 29:15.154
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

29:16.294 --> 29:17.875
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, blah, blah, blah.

29:18.678 --> 29:19.259
[SPEAKER_07]: Tungtai today.

29:48.901 --> 30:10.830
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically that's the OLR army and we're looking for anybody that's got a mech in the game doesn't matter what you know you're playing that's all good and there is a password though up up down down is the password I couldn't add the rest of the Konami code because there's just not enough space for it but up up down down is the password to get in and don't be a dick

30:11.414 --> 30:12.135
[SPEAKER_02]: and Don'tBeADick.

30:12.435 --> 30:13.516
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be a dick to other people.

30:13.636 --> 30:15.157
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfectly fine in the game.

30:15.177 --> 30:17.039
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a dick to each other.

30:17.079 --> 30:19.281
[SPEAKER_02]: We totally approve of smack talking in the game.

30:19.321 --> 30:20.442
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

30:21.583 --> 30:23.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Because after all, you're all on a team.

30:23.424 --> 30:24.425
[SPEAKER_12]: Be excellent to each other.

30:24.945 --> 30:25.446
[SPEAKER_07]: Party on.

30:27.568 --> 30:28.789
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going to party on?

30:29.169 --> 30:30.150
[SPEAKER_12]: So can I do my thing now?

30:30.170 --> 30:30.630
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you may.

30:30.670 --> 30:30.991
[SPEAKER_07]: You may.

30:31.211 --> 30:32.232
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you may do your thing.

30:32.252 --> 30:33.553
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you need your music for your thing?

30:33.833 --> 30:34.213
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

30:34.273 --> 30:35.334
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel incomplete without it.

30:37.856 --> 30:38.297
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

30:38.397 --> 30:39.498
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all happy and cute.

30:41.941 --> 30:49.685
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I have been hanging out on the interwebs, and actually this is one that was brought to my attention at California Extreme.

30:49.805 --> 30:54.647
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, uh, go to www.thefutureofpinball.com.

30:55.247 --> 30:57.048
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, again, I'm still stuck on pinball.

30:57.508 --> 31:01.450
[SPEAKER_07]: But this, um, actually we watched their, uh, little, uh,

31:02.438 --> 31:02.978
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

31:31.508 --> 31:38.831
[SPEAKER_07]: Because pinball, basically, the way that the pinball industry was staying going was the fact that you have this machine that does this.

31:38.911 --> 31:41.152
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now we have to make this machine obsolete.

31:41.492 --> 31:42.913
[SPEAKER_07]: Our competition is ourself.

31:43.493 --> 31:48.455
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, once, you know, we lost Capcom, and Williams basically only had themselves.

31:49.135 --> 31:57.179
[SPEAKER_07]: To keep, you know, to keep that whole area open, they had to basically make their old machines obsolete and make new things that people wanted to do.

31:57.199 --> 32:00.100
[SPEAKER_07]: So Pinball 2000 was how they were going to revive the whole...

32:01.571 --> 32:26.862
[SPEAKER_07]: pinball industry except they decided to close it down anyway now they make casino machines but this it was it was very cool it also has some footage of some very rare machines like this I think it's called pinball carnival or something to that effect but it's basically like a multi-layer pinball machine we have to work about getting it to the top of the thing

32:27.462 --> 32:29.423
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very cool, very cool, very big machine.

32:30.363 --> 32:32.463
[SPEAKER_07]: But lots of really cool stuff.

32:32.683 --> 32:43.426
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're into pinball, if you're into video games in general, because the other good thing about this is that it brings in techniques that were actually incorporated into some of the old games, like the... What was the update to Space Invaders?

32:44.226 --> 32:47.267
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you have the background behind it, but the thing projected over it.

32:47.507 --> 32:50.188
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember, but yeah, I know what game you're talking about, though.

32:50.748 --> 32:50.908
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

32:52.409 --> 32:52.970
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very cool.

32:53.030 --> 32:54.090
[SPEAKER_07]: I suggest checking it out again.

32:54.190 --> 32:55.991
[SPEAKER_07]: It's thefutureofpinball.com.

32:56.311 --> 32:59.933
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this guy's movie is supposed to be out around October, I want to say.

33:00.593 --> 33:02.134
[SPEAKER_07]: So check out the trailer.

33:02.194 --> 33:02.814
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of good stuff.

33:03.475 --> 33:04.095
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting.

33:05.316 --> 33:05.996
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

33:07.237 --> 33:08.137
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking about...

33:08.703 --> 33:10.305
[SPEAKER_02]: The next generation of stuff.

33:11.185 --> 33:17.331
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, of course, revealed this week their brand new media player called the Zune.

33:17.751 --> 33:19.353
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, it's not meant for games.

33:20.033 --> 33:23.056
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does look very similar to an iPod, kind of.

33:23.296 --> 33:25.358
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's got a giant screen on it though.

33:25.619 --> 33:31.404
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's basically going to be used for just playing games and

33:32.469 --> 33:33.329
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33:54.434 --> 34:01.862
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly, this isn't the only device that they're releasing as part of that, so maybe a portable gaming device out there, but not this one.

34:02.143 --> 34:04.746
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Zune is not a gaming device.

34:08.290 --> 34:12.014
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on to a completely different topic in regards to Sony and the Blu-ray.

34:12.074 --> 34:15.478
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of an iffy thing because it came through Internet Movie Database, but

34:15.854 --> 34:21.140
[SPEAKER_12]: A Chinese newspaper is reporting that Sony is having some major problems with Blu-ray production.

34:22.282 --> 34:29.670
[SPEAKER_12]: Supposedly, production facilities are not being able to meet the demand for the diode that generates the blue laser that puts the blue in Blu-ray.

34:30.171 --> 34:34.876
[SPEAKER_12]: And apparently, Sony's own plants and some at Nisha Corp.

34:34.896 --> 34:35.337
[SPEAKER_12]: in Japan

34:35.757 --> 34:38.798
[SPEAKER_12]: have been having run-ins regarding supply shortcoming.

34:39.119 --> 34:44.881
[SPEAKER_12]: This may not only affect the supply of DVD players' Blu-ray, but it might also affect the PlayStation 3.

34:45.781 --> 34:47.882
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know.

34:48.243 --> 34:50.263
[SPEAKER_12]: Could be running into some delay problems with PlayStation 3.

34:50.363 --> 34:55.186
[SPEAKER_02]: Delays or possibly low yields might even have a huge shortage.

34:55.286 --> 34:57.467
[SPEAKER_02]: More of a shortage than the Xbox 360.

34:57.527 --> 35:00.208
[SPEAKER_02]: People thought, you know, the Xbox 360 launch was botched.

35:01.348 --> 35:02.329
[SPEAKER_02]: You ain't seen nothing yet.

35:04.950 --> 35:05.170
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

35:05.854 --> 35:10.196
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know there's supposed to be a Pirates MMO?

35:11.696 --> 35:12.397
[SPEAKER_02]: Pirates of the Caribbean?

35:12.597 --> 35:12.777
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

35:13.737 --> 35:16.878
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're saying that there's going to be user-submitted content.

35:18.399 --> 35:30.184
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, as far as user-submitted content, I'm really not sure how that's going to be feasible in-game, honestly.

35:30.824 --> 35:33.025
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go ahead and read this quote here off of Kotaku.

35:34.597 --> 35:37.829
[SPEAKER_07]: It simply cannot be the case that Flying Lab meant what they say above.

35:37.889 --> 35:39.173
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, what they were saying...

35:39.810 --> 35:44.913
[SPEAKER_07]: is that they're going to let you put in user-submitted and peer-reviewed content.

35:46.614 --> 36:06.605
[SPEAKER_07]: But to get back into the quote, the developers must intend to have a high degree of control over the designs that make their way into the world because it is a certainty that if they don't want the entire Port Royal Harbor to look like T-shirts at a fanfare with sales that feature large-breasted elven princesses, Darth Vader in a jaunty pirate hat, and slogans like minus 50 DKP or WTS...

36:07.865 --> 36:10.869
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

36:10.889 --> 36:11.550
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a great quote.

36:12.451 --> 36:15.816
[SPEAKER_12]: How many freaking Jack Sparrows are going to be on that game?

36:15.876 --> 36:17.939
[SPEAKER_12]: How many Sephiroths are in Final Fantasy XI?

36:18.139 --> 36:19.661
[SPEAKER_12]: Captain Jack Sephiroth.

36:21.318 --> 36:22.259
[SPEAKER_07]: I will kill you all.

36:22.519 --> 36:22.980
[SPEAKER_12]: And Lakot.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.562
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the idea... I'm going to be honest.

36:26.602 --> 36:29.725
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm probably the only person in the world that has not seen either Pirates of the Caribbean movie.

36:30.746 --> 36:33.668
[SPEAKER_12]: But I still think the concept of this MMO game is kind of cool.

36:33.748 --> 36:39.013
[SPEAKER_12]: Except it does make me cry a little bit because Puzzle Pirates was such the cutest little MMO.

36:39.473 --> 36:40.434
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, there's been...

36:40.754 --> 36:41.855
[SPEAKER_12]: There's still Puzzle Pirates.

37:00.034 --> 37:01.335
[SPEAKER_12]: Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates

37:30.526 --> 37:31.307
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates

37:45.982 --> 37:48.443
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox Live Arcade is going to get a free game.

37:48.844 --> 37:51.785
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you too can play Texas Hold'em for free.

37:52.225 --> 37:56.427
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out August 23rd and it will be free.

37:56.507 --> 37:57.948
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in no money.

37:58.849 --> 38:01.090
[SPEAKER_02]: So be sure to check it out when it comes out.

38:01.390 --> 38:04.432
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to support tournaments and 8 players online.

38:04.952 --> 38:06.953
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like Microsoft wants to get you gambling.

38:07.753 --> 38:08.674
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds pretty cool.

38:09.194 --> 38:12.576
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I remember correctly, I think this game also supported the live vision camera.

38:12.656 --> 38:14.937
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be kind of neat too.

38:15.993 --> 38:20.156
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually another demo on Xbox 360.

38:20.977 --> 38:22.558
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the Lord of the Rings demo.

38:23.518 --> 38:27.081
[SPEAKER_07]: The Battle for Middle Earth 2 is actually on Xbox Live Marketplace now.

38:27.661 --> 38:30.883
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at 148.84 megabytes.

38:30.904 --> 38:31.524
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty funny.

38:32.284 --> 38:34.526
[SPEAKER_07]: And has a single and multiplayer available.

38:35.407 --> 38:37.108
[SPEAKER_07]: Has a tutorial to tell you how to play it.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.131
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there's also First Mission available on there, too.

38:42.312 --> 38:42.432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

38:43.340 --> 38:47.783
[SPEAKER_07]: and lots of themes have also been made available on the marketplace too.

38:48.923 --> 38:51.865
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting because I saw this and I downloaded it but I haven't actually played it yet.

38:53.606 --> 38:55.647
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's kind of neat.

38:56.497 --> 38:59.418
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure about the whole Lord of the Rings aspect of it.

38:59.799 --> 39:02.039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just waiting for a good RTS game to be on there.

39:03.340 --> 39:04.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like Command & Conquer.

39:05.021 --> 39:09.543
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Command & Conquer 3, when they're putting that out, would be pretty awesome.

39:10.003 --> 39:11.003
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably going to put that out on the 360.

39:11.123 --> 39:16.786
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were testing to see how well a game like that would do with Lord of the Rings, so it should be interesting.

39:18.041 --> 39:21.762
[SPEAKER_12]: I will want to check this demo out, just because I like free stuff, even if it's just demos.

39:21.982 --> 39:43.506
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing to mention, though, about that demo, they did have, um, slightly before the demo was released, they had a walkthrough of the demo, um, which was kind of interesting, um, and that was pretty cool, and they also had a walkthrough of some other demo, and I remember a walkthrough of the demo of, um, To Human, I believe, or no, not To Human, um,

39:45.677 --> 39:46.798
[SPEAKER_02]: God, what the hell the other game was.

39:46.858 --> 39:54.023
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, there were three walkthroughs on there and two demos, so possibly a third demo coming out.

39:54.464 --> 40:00.268
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that was their new MMO, their sci-fi MMO, which for some reason the name is escaping me.

40:02.390 --> 40:02.670
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

40:04.532 --> 40:07.654
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, we're going to move on to an interactive element of our show.

40:07.694 --> 40:12.478
[SPEAKER_12]: We love to get mails from you guys every week at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

40:13.134 --> 40:13.855
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:37.694 --> 40:42.159
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura reads them all, and I read some of them too, but we don't have time to respond on air to all of them.

40:42.399 --> 40:45.663
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are quite a number that I'm going to actually make a typed response to.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.526
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, and real quick, that was Mass Effect I was talking about.

40:48.807 --> 40:49.748
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, here we go.

40:49.828 --> 40:50.268
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag!

40:52.531 --> 40:54.934
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one comes from Brandon from Texas.

40:55.407 --> 40:56.448
[SPEAKER_07]: This is good afternoon.

40:56.989 --> 40:58.430
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it is sort of afternoon now, isn't it?

40:59.071 --> 41:01.193
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a new listener of your podcast and love it.

41:01.213 --> 41:05.217
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to make a comment about the comments about game patching you did in episode 190.

41:05.498 --> 41:09.282
[SPEAKER_07]: It is always a bad idea to rush a product out and fix it later.

41:09.342 --> 41:11.084
[SPEAKER_07]: The examples of why is Windows XP.

41:12.026 --> 41:16.608
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft has rushed the development of XP and caused it to be inherently insecure.

41:17.248 --> 41:20.370
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't until Service Pack 2 that the majority of security flaws were fixed.

41:20.490 --> 41:21.730
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, there are still problems.

41:22.050 --> 41:26.953
[SPEAKER_07]: The sad reality is that if there is buggy software, it is a risk to security and your systems.

41:27.013 --> 41:28.673
[SPEAKER_07]: People can exploit a flaw in a Wii game.

41:29.194 --> 41:31.195
[SPEAKER_07]: It will cause cheating and other malignant hacks.

41:31.315 --> 41:32.375
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that use of malignant.

41:33.776 --> 41:34.636
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm the grammar nerd.

41:35.857 --> 41:36.617
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Madatuma.

41:38.633 --> 41:39.374
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

42:01.483 --> 42:03.085
[SPEAKER_12]: Good email.

42:03.585 --> 42:05.467
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the comparison.

42:05.527 --> 42:12.553
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the point that he's trying to make with XP being, you know, they have tons of flaws and they're always releasing patches for it all the time.

42:12.593 --> 42:14.054
[SPEAKER_12]: He still has tons of flaws.

42:14.515 --> 42:21.481
[SPEAKER_12]: At the same time, to me, it's a little bit of apples and oranges because you're talking about an operating system, which is like the backbone of the computer, versus a game.

42:22.145 --> 42:23.566
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little bit apples and oranges for me.

42:23.586 --> 42:28.550
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get me wrong, I get the comparison, but it's a little bit apples and oranges for me.

42:28.570 --> 42:32.433
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you what system actually that would have been a very accurate comparison to is the Dreamcast.

42:33.194 --> 42:39.579
[SPEAKER_07]: For any of the games that ran in the Windows CE environment, the game loads Windows CE onto the system prior to playing the game.

42:39.839 --> 42:50.567
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even more recent, some of the Xbox 360 games and their save game errors, which once you're playing through some of the game, you go back into it and your save game's gone.

42:50.928 --> 42:51.228
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

42:52.003 --> 42:56.345
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something that they had to patch and fix and hopefully I think it's fixed by now.

42:57.305 --> 42:57.805
[SPEAKER_02]: More mail!

42:58.025 --> 43:11.450
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, actually an email from our dear friend Rob with two B's actually sent me a little bit of an article that was posted on Instant Replay about Namco of America.

43:12.151 --> 43:12.971
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a new president.

43:15.192 --> 43:18.293
[SPEAKER_07]: Toyoshi Nishikawa is now the president and CEO of

43:19.653 --> 43:48.193
[SPEAKER_12]: COO of Namco America Incorporated Kevin Hayes is now going to be focusing on Namco Cybertainment which is the arcade good I mean good that arcade stuff is going up you know I was listening to another show I think it was Bobby talking about arcade stuff and how there's kind of a need to re-energize what's going on in the arcade scene and I want to say it was something like Sega

43:49.516 --> 43:52.777
[SPEAKER_12]: had a big interest in trying to revitalize what was going on in the arcade market.

43:52.877 --> 43:58.998
[SPEAKER_12]: I know some of the things that they were citing was look at a game like Derby Owner's Club that has a huge social following behind it.

43:59.258 --> 44:05.540
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really where arcades can come back to life is through the social element.

44:06.960 --> 44:07.580
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at DDR.

44:07.760 --> 44:11.521
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, hell, this show was born of the social element of DDR.

44:12.141 --> 44:13.562
[SPEAKER_12]: It boils down to something as simple as that.

44:13.582 --> 44:14.082
[SPEAKER_12]: That's

44:15.222 --> 44:16.183
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

44:31.289 --> 44:34.632
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that people are putting resources back into making arcades fun.

44:34.812 --> 44:36.874
[SPEAKER_12]: Because arcades have so much potential.

44:36.994 --> 44:38.655
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pretty much dying over here for a little while.

44:38.955 --> 44:40.136
[SPEAKER_12]: But they need to come back to life.

44:40.156 --> 44:41.077
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so much potential.

44:41.357 --> 44:44.600
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's actually pretty good that they brought over somebody from the Japanese side of it.

44:44.620 --> 44:51.286
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the arcades there are still... If they're not surviving fully, they're still going on strong.

44:51.646 --> 44:54.288
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's been as many closures there as there were here.

44:54.708 --> 44:56.750
[SPEAKER_07]: But a little bit more background on Nishikawa.

44:56.810 --> 44:58.471
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been with Namco since 1987.

45:01.144 --> 45:05.746
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been the EVP CEO since January.

45:06.306 --> 45:09.347
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically he's been with Namco for a while.

45:09.447 --> 45:11.767
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a lot of experience in the company.

45:11.787 --> 45:17.469
[SPEAKER_07]: So being that I am a big Namco fan, I worked for several of their arcades.

45:18.650 --> 45:21.390
[SPEAKER_12]: A GS68 in our chatroom has a great comment too.

45:21.430 --> 45:23.611
[SPEAKER_12]: Maximum Tune 2 is very social as well.

45:23.691 --> 45:23.931
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

45:27.352 --> 45:28.792
[SPEAKER_12]: This could be a good thing for arcades.

45:29.032 --> 45:31.273
[SPEAKER_12]: So congratulations on your promotions, boys.

45:31.933 --> 45:37.975
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of arcades, I was at Riptide Arcade yesterday.

45:39.335 --> 45:40.816
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the Pier 39 one, right?

45:40.896 --> 45:41.616
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, in San Francisco.

45:41.996 --> 45:45.457
[SPEAKER_07]: They have now this machine that you can win iPods and...

45:45.956 --> 45:46.657
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I've seen those, yeah.

45:46.757 --> 45:48.638
[SPEAKER_07]: And PSPs and DSs out of.

45:48.698 --> 45:51.000
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw one at Universal CityWalk in one of the random stores there.

45:51.261 --> 45:53.022
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, we've all been traveling a lot lately.

45:53.102 --> 45:56.585
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, we have these, like, I've had these random Reno, Canada stories.

45:57.886 --> 45:58.727
[SPEAKER_12]: And LA.

45:58.787 --> 46:00.669
[SPEAKER_07]: Including interesting text messages.

46:00.709 --> 46:01.650
[SPEAKER_12]: San Francisco.

46:02.110 --> 46:02.470
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

46:02.490 --> 46:06.414
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in San Francisco, San Jose, Los Gatos, like, in the span of two days.

46:06.654 --> 46:07.555
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of crazy.

46:07.615 --> 46:07.835
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

46:08.135 --> 46:09.376
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, back to the emails.

46:10.177 --> 46:10.998
[SPEAKER_07]: One from Fireboma.

46:12.549 --> 46:13.809
[SPEAKER_07]: One of our long-time listeners.

46:37.632 --> 46:43.916
[SPEAKER_07]: Xplay, the show that usually laden with knowledge about obscure Japanese RPGs and action games, forgot to do its homework and is now talking out of its ass.

46:44.596 --> 46:55.622
[SPEAKER_07]: The main problem is that this lack of knowledge about the Bimani series when it comes to comparing Guitar Hero to other games is commonplace in many publications about the Guitar Hero series, calling it groundbreaking and such.

46:56.022 --> 47:00.685
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like calling In the Groove a unique dancing game the likes of which never have been seen before.

47:01.525 --> 47:04.587
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering what your thoughts on this issue and what you think about Xplay's review.

47:05.223 --> 47:09.005
[SPEAKER_12]: I think as far as X-Play's review goes, I think you pretty much said it right there.

47:09.025 --> 47:11.046
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if they didn't do the research, you can tell.

47:11.126 --> 47:13.307
[SPEAKER_12]: It shows, and it makes you mad or whatever.

47:13.727 --> 47:21.690
[SPEAKER_12]: So their review, they will bear the brunt of the fan base getting mad at them for their review.

47:22.410 --> 47:26.852
[SPEAKER_12]: But unfortunately, it's kind of a trend you're seeing because while... Here it is for me.

47:27.272 --> 47:29.213
[SPEAKER_12]: Guitar Hero is a good game.

47:29.793 --> 47:31.114
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, it's a great game.

47:31.883 --> 47:33.063
[SPEAKER_12]: But people give it too much credit.

47:33.503 --> 47:36.924
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't do as much as people think it did.

47:37.064 --> 47:43.606
[SPEAKER_12]: And the problem is, exactly what this is, is that people are giving Guitar Hero credit for something it didn't do.

47:44.006 --> 47:47.187
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was like creating the music genre, essentially.

47:48.288 --> 47:50.788
[SPEAKER_12]: In a way, creating the music-making genre, I should say.

47:50.808 --> 47:53.749
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you could go back, Beatmania didn't really create the music.

47:53.789 --> 48:00.031
[SPEAKER_12]: And you could go back further and say Parappa the Rapper was really... But as far as the music-making genre, Beatmania is really the granddaddy

48:00.561 --> 48:03.909
[SPEAKER_12]: and so you can't credit Guitar Hero with that.

48:04.149 --> 48:03.909
1998.

48:04.931 --> 48:06.936
[SPEAKER_12]: But you can credit Guitar Hero with

48:08.559 --> 48:13.340
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember seeing this review a while back and I remember complaining about it as well.

48:13.420 --> 48:13.941
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know...

48:38.513 --> 48:59.970
[SPEAKER_02]: I had pretty good respect for X-Play because I love how they rip in some of the stupid games out there and they point out what's really dumb about them or what's glitchy about it and they do it in a funny way sometimes but then there's some times where they're just talking out their ass about things and I don't know, it's just you kind of

49:00.740 --> 49:06.525
[SPEAKER_02]: Expect a certain level of criticism from them and a little bit of research involved.

49:06.585 --> 49:08.867
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you see them just kind of completely...

49:09.915 --> 49:35.537
[SPEAKER_02]: you know turn around and become like all those other shows out there you kind of let down and I really think if you know if they want to play you know devil's advocate here Guitar Hero wouldn't be as great as it was if Guitar Freaks had more licensed music that wasn't all kind of in-house or non-mainstream I mean it was a Japanese game and it had Japanese style music and in fact if I remember correctly I think that was one of the complaints of Beatmania was

49:35.997 --> 49:37.939
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, none of these music tracks.

49:37.979 --> 49:40.841
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just all generic techno, and I don't recognize any of these.

49:40.921 --> 49:48.086
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if you follow Beatmania, these are some classic tracks from like 10 years ago and some of the beginning games.

49:48.747 --> 49:51.449
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to get to some chatroom comments real quick before we get back to the mailbag.

49:51.489 --> 49:55.452
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to say 23rd Magus in our chatroom says, Guitar Hero did a hell of a lot.

49:55.532 --> 49:57.433
[SPEAKER_12]: It made music games more accessible.

49:57.813 --> 49:58.574
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of the point there.

49:58.594 --> 49:59.515
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good way of putting it.

49:59.675 --> 50:02.397
[SPEAKER_12]: It made music games more accessible to a wider audience.

50:02.417 --> 50:02.997
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that point.

50:03.338 --> 50:05.099
[SPEAKER_12]: And then GS191 also makes a good point.

50:05.399 --> 50:06.619
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, don't blame the hosts.

50:06.960 --> 50:10.361
[SPEAKER_12]: None of us are, for the record, but everybody out there should keep in mind this.

50:10.661 --> 50:11.681
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, don't blame the hosts.

50:11.781 --> 50:13.242
[SPEAKER_12]: Blame the fucking writers and editors.

50:13.302 --> 50:15.823
[SPEAKER_12]: They are the people that are putting that show down the tubes.

50:16.483 --> 50:20.965
[SPEAKER_12]: So whatever intern at X-Play wrote that review, a spanking for you, my friend.

50:21.465 --> 50:22.205
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even a good one.

50:22.345 --> 50:23.806
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, still, don't blame the hosts.

50:23.826 --> 50:24.426
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

50:24.526 --> 50:34.590
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would take it that these people, hosts of a gaming show, should have some common knowledge to a game series that is, I don't know, over 10 years old now.

50:37.291 --> 50:44.095
[SPEAKER_12]: To the credit though, the two that they have hosting that show have more knowledge than a lot of folks on that network, so I can't complain.

50:44.275 --> 50:56.742
[SPEAKER_02]: They've talked about DDR in the past, and they've talked about when Guitar Freaks, when Guitar Hero came out, so I know they're aware of Guitar Hero, or Guitar Freaks, so what, is this the brain fart?

50:56.822 --> 50:57.102
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

50:58.102 --> 51:00.944
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got one last email, and this is from Blaze.

51:02.006 --> 51:09.693
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, as always this show is going amazingly well and I can't wait for each week's episode.

51:09.773 --> 51:12.235
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to offer an opinion on a couple of different things.

51:12.876 --> 51:12.235
1.

51:13.396 --> 51:18.801
[SPEAKER_07]: In regards to a question about retailers not having the quote unpopular like Phoenix Wright, Katamari Damacy,

51:19.719 --> 51:20.840
[SPEAKER_07]: Games, I would like to say this.

51:21.280 --> 51:24.542
[SPEAKER_07]: Retailers need to understand that these games exist because people do play them.

51:24.922 --> 51:29.925
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, stores should come up with a better way of figuring out what to stock and what not to stock.

51:30.085 --> 51:35.869
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if a store only keeps two or three copies of a game at a given time, it is better than running out and not doing anything about it.

51:35.989 --> 51:42.212
[SPEAKER_07]: I called three GameStop CBs in the past week, and none of them had Phoenix Wright, not a big surprise, or Katamari Damacy, a rather odd surprise.

51:42.793 --> 51:48.276
[SPEAKER_07]: When I spoke to the people at these stores, they did nothing in order to try and be more helpful other than, no, we don't have the game.

51:49.048 --> 51:52.670
[SPEAKER_07]: In their defense, it is based on how much they sell.

51:52.770 --> 52:05.938
[SPEAKER_07]: If they sell one copy of Katamari during pre-orders, and they sell 40 of Madden, their big seller is going to be Madden.

52:06.539 --> 52:11.862
[SPEAKER_07]: It is going to make more sense for them to stock more of this, better to cater to the larger numbers than to...

52:13.528 --> 52:36.458
[SPEAKER_12]: but on the other side of this and the part that kind of makes me go huh is that you know like let's say Tower Records if they didn't have a CD I wanted they would offer to order it for me so why aren't these stores that he's calling offering to at least order the game for him that would be what I would do I know that they don't actually have that capability so that's why they wouldn't offer it however I think that if you will if you want to see more retailers do that write their customer service line

52:37.924 --> 52:41.907
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just speaking, and I'm not trying to rip on any store, because he named a couple stores here.

52:42.448 --> 52:46.051
[SPEAKER_12]: From a customer service angle, you don't turn the customers away.

52:46.111 --> 52:47.612
[SPEAKER_12]: You try to do whatever you can.

52:47.632 --> 52:49.194
[SPEAKER_12]: I train customer service for a living.

52:49.514 --> 52:52.376
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to try and keep them somehow, and that's one way you can do it.

52:53.397 --> 52:57.338
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if that's a corporate restriction, that's the corporate, they need to, the corporate needs to look into that.

52:57.458 --> 53:00.939
[SPEAKER_07]: I do know, and I've seen, I've actually been in this, and it's not just my husband that does this.

53:00.999 --> 53:01.179
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

53:01.659 --> 53:03.480
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I'm not just saying it because he's my husband too.

53:03.520 --> 53:03.720
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

53:04.080 --> 53:08.101
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, I've actually been in a couple of GameStops where they will call other stores and find out.

53:08.121 --> 53:09.201
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now that's a little better.

53:09.221 --> 53:09.301
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

53:09.321 --> 53:10.102
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a little better.

53:10.122 --> 53:10.342
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

53:10.362 --> 53:10.942
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something.

53:11.022 --> 53:11.522
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

53:12.262 --> 53:21.045
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've, I went back, kind of on the same subject, I went back to GameStop the other day to, um, was I was looking to maybe pick up another used, uh, Xbox 360 game.

53:21.065 --> 53:21.105
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

53:23.479 --> 53:23.919
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

53:47.930 --> 53:48.570
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy XII

54:07.399 --> 54:12.281
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they should actually do a network-wide inventory and be able to do store-to-store.

54:12.301 --> 54:15.882
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually can do store-to-store transfers for items at GameStop.

54:16.682 --> 54:19.323
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's more just in case they need stock of stuff.

54:19.823 --> 54:25.805
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that they should actually be able to have it where, hey, we can pull this copy from this store for you and have it for you on this day.

54:27.306 --> 54:27.906
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a suggestion.

54:28.806 --> 54:31.167
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, hopefully somebody who has the power to change.

54:31.227 --> 54:32.587
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't have to be GameStop.

54:32.607 --> 54:33.728
[SPEAKER_12]: It can be any of these stores.

54:34.768 --> 54:41.871
[SPEAKER_12]: If anybody's listening that might have control over corporate, I hope you have... I would love to hear from you guys that work in the corporate side of these things.

54:42.151 --> 54:43.712
[SPEAKER_12]: What's your view on these types of policies?

54:44.460 --> 54:48.061
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're way off base with what we think are good ideas, we'd like to know why.

54:48.101 --> 54:50.182
[SPEAKER_12]: What are the reasons why you wouldn't do that?

54:50.502 --> 54:52.203
[SPEAKER_07]: I should see if I could interview my husband's boss.

54:53.003 --> 54:53.583
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be fun.

54:55.784 --> 55:00.285
[SPEAKER_07]: The second item on here, pre-ordering games is something I only do if I'm going to get a bonus out of it.

55:00.746 --> 55:03.447
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, I pre-ordered Soul Calibur 2 for the Xbox.

55:03.587 --> 55:10.209
[SPEAKER_07]: I had pre-ordered it two or three days after the offer had expired, but I received my very awesome lithograph that hangs in the frame in my room.

55:10.769 --> 55:12.709
[SPEAKER_07]: and a gorgeous book with artwork from the game.

55:13.110 --> 55:16.250
[SPEAKER_07]: So I say that reserving the game is only worth it if you get a nice bonus.

55:17.190 --> 55:18.091
[SPEAKER_07]: I do disagree with that.

55:18.891 --> 55:28.293
[SPEAKER_07]: For some of those more rare, hard to find games that you know there's going to be a limited run of, pre-ordering guarantees you get your copy.

55:29.273 --> 55:35.134
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, because it's really convenient for me anyway because I can just say, hey, Dan, pick up our pre-orders.

55:36.254 --> 55:40.255
[SPEAKER_07]: But even so, if you live a block from a GameStop or it's on your way home from work

55:40.905 --> 55:44.573
[SPEAKER_07]: What's gonna hurt you to stop in, drop your five bucks off, and pick it up after work one day?

55:46.138 --> 55:49.701
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to keep delaying this issue out, but I did think about it.

55:49.821 --> 55:51.522
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to leave with this note.

55:51.622 --> 55:54.385
[SPEAKER_12]: I really thought about what is the reason, Rob, why you don't pre-order games.

55:54.405 --> 55:55.145
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought about it.

55:55.205 --> 56:06.394
[SPEAKER_12]: This is why I don't like to pre-order games, because I feel like when I put down $5 a GameStop, the day the game comes out, then I see an ad in the paper, and, oh, Best Buy is offering a free copy of such and such, or they're offering this deal.

56:06.434 --> 56:11.358
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's like, well, damn, now I've already committed the $5 to buy it here, and now I can really get the special deal here.

56:11.758 --> 56:14.941
[SPEAKER_12]: and honestly, I think that's what stopped me from doing it in the past.

56:15.121 --> 56:22.888
[SPEAKER_12]: I put down $5 on a game and then suddenly Best Buy or one of the other companies, I'm just using them as an example, gave a better deal and I was a little miffed by that.

56:23.188 --> 56:25.790
[SPEAKER_07]: As a small rebuttal, you can transfer your reserves to other games.

56:26.791 --> 56:28.673
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you actually can cancel your reserve.

56:29.153 --> 56:30.975
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess that's a good thing to know, but I don't

56:31.351 --> 56:32.232
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

57:01.027 --> 57:02.408
[SPEAKER_12]: I've actually been to that site.

57:02.808 --> 57:04.128
[SPEAKER_12]: It's worth your time checking out.

57:04.148 --> 57:06.529
[SPEAKER_12]: An honorable mention for site of the week.

57:07.169 --> 57:07.630
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cute.

57:08.330 --> 57:09.751
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't think of any other word to describe.

57:09.771 --> 57:10.131
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cute.

57:10.171 --> 57:12.992
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.

57:13.272 --> 57:15.773
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we have some OL Army people on there.

57:16.457 --> 57:17.197
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?

57:17.697 --> 57:18.318
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you what.

57:18.498 --> 57:27.880
[SPEAKER_07]: If anyone of you is playing Kingdom of Loathing, I will make, because again, I'm hosting stuff for our ORL Army also on roleplay.darksakura.com.

57:28.400 --> 57:31.061
[SPEAKER_07]: I will make a Kingdom of Loathing discussion forum for you guys.

57:31.301 --> 57:37.763
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, now Roz in our chat room or Dance Cook, whatever, says that Kingdom of Loathing needs to go die in a fire.

57:38.163 --> 57:39.403
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently something happened.

57:39.803 --> 57:40.523
[SPEAKER_12]: Some drama.

57:40.623 --> 57:41.024
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

57:41.824 --> 57:43.164
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there drama on Kingdom of Loathing?

57:43.204 --> 57:43.524
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't know.

57:43.544 --> 57:43.804
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

57:43.884 --> 57:45.645
[SPEAKER_07]: What game does not have drama?

57:45.865 --> 57:46.165
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

57:47.411 --> 57:50.953
[SPEAKER_12]: Pac-Man, Brain Age, Brew!

57:51.993 --> 57:53.393
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, anyways.

57:53.533 --> 57:54.474
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the last of the emails.

57:54.534 --> 57:55.054
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the last email.

57:55.094 --> 57:58.955
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, we'd love to hear from you.

57:59.295 --> 58:01.596
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, there's the voicemail, 916-226-9067.

58:02.497 --> 58:03.577
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a toll-free call.

58:03.877 --> 58:06.478
[SPEAKER_12]: Our voicemail question of the week, are games too easy?

58:07.017 --> 58:15.500
[SPEAKER_07]: One last thing I do want to mention is that for the kind person who sent me an email directly with the compliments and support, thank you very much.

58:15.580 --> 58:16.801
[SPEAKER_07]: You will be getting a reply.

58:16.861 --> 58:19.362
[SPEAKER_07]: I just did not have an opportunity to do it when I first read your email.

58:19.694 --> 58:28.316
[SPEAKER_12]: and to the people who did not email me this week directly with admiration and support, you may feel free to email me this week.

58:28.796 --> 58:29.177
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

58:29.257 --> 58:32.337
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I text messaged you.

58:32.437 --> 58:34.078
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want the listeners text messaging me.

58:34.138 --> 58:35.318
[SPEAKER_12]: I get charged for that.

58:35.458 --> 58:36.458
[SPEAKER_12]: No, send me an email.

58:36.498 --> 58:37.039
[SPEAKER_12]: That's free.

58:37.099 --> 58:38.279
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll text you five times.

58:38.979 --> 58:46.282
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, one more thing to add on there, thank you for anybody that nominated us for the podcast awards as well.

58:47.403 --> 58:49.844
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope it's five indies that got nominated.

58:49.904 --> 58:55.446
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope that it is indie podcasts that got in there, but we'll know in about a week or so what's going on there.

58:55.586 --> 59:02.009
[SPEAKER_12]: I would bet anything Gamertag Radio gets nominated, because I've gotten like five emails from those guys.

59:03.177 --> 59:03.798
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

59:28.823 --> 59:32.046
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

59:55.709 --> 01:00:05.456
[SPEAKER_02]: Goodman has an issue with the game's plot, which sees the terrorists taking over a swanky casino on the city strip and seizing a number of hostages.

01:00:06.337 --> 01:00:18.645
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, Goodman reported saying the game was based on a false premise, adding he has been repeatedly told by the government officials that Las Vegas is the safest place imaginable when it comes to terrorist attacks.

01:00:19.625 --> 01:00:24.531
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor also said he'll look into whether or not the city can prevent the game from being released.

01:00:24.612 --> 01:00:33.022
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be harmful economically and it may be something that's not entitled to free speech protection.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:33.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

01:00:34.542 --> 01:00:36.823
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderdog Harold has an excellent point here in the chatroom.

01:00:36.943 --> 01:00:41.364
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd think he'd object to all the murders that take place in Las Vegas on CSI.

01:00:41.384 --> 01:00:41.664
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly!

01:00:41.684 --> 01:00:42.004
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly!

01:01:03.905 --> 01:01:04.525
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

01:01:05.126 --> 01:01:07.627
[SPEAKER_12]: CSI does not make Las Vegas look like a pretty place.

01:01:07.888 --> 01:01:09.348
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really watch the show a whole lot.

01:01:09.409 --> 01:01:15.492
[SPEAKER_12]: I've caught it a couple times because I shouldn't have to feel ashamed to admit this, but I like Survivor.

01:01:15.592 --> 01:01:20.195
[SPEAKER_12]: And CSI comes on after Survivor and, you know, sometimes I catch the first little pieces.

01:01:20.275 --> 01:01:23.197
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't paint Vegas to be a pretty town at all.

01:01:24.558 --> 01:01:27.220
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'd think the mayor would... Maybe he has, I don't know.

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:32.123
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, after all, their catchphrase for Vegas is, you know, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

01:01:32.183 --> 01:01:32.323
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:36.531
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, moving on.

01:01:36.551 --> 01:01:38.193
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to point this out.

01:01:38.213 --> 01:01:42.297
[SPEAKER_12]: This is very random, but when was the last time we had Atari 2600 news on this show?

01:01:43.138 --> 01:01:44.399
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, we love all consoles.

01:01:44.999 --> 01:01:45.460
[SPEAKER_12]: We mean it.

01:01:46.206 --> 01:01:52.231
[SPEAKER_12]: Well get this, Simon Kornhorst is developing for the Atari 2600.

01:01:52.571 --> 01:01:54.993
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, folks are still developing for the Atari 2600.

01:01:55.353 --> 01:01:59.817
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called AVCS Tech Challenge is the name of the game.

01:01:59.857 --> 01:02:04.260
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a little bit of a play on the word Aztec Challenge that was a game on the Commodore 64.

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:14.188
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a quote from Simon Kornhorst that says as follows, I somehow remember the game Aztec Challenge from 1983 on the Commodore 64, and I always liked the first level called the Gauntlet.

01:02:14.548 --> 01:02:19.511
[SPEAKER_12]: And the game music, I thought a similar game for the VCS would be cool, he says on his website.

01:02:19.892 --> 01:02:27.717
[SPEAKER_12]: For the game's release, there will be handmade copies complete with a manual cartridge and packaging, but only for the first 55 owners.

01:02:28.537 --> 01:02:31.339
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of those have already been secured by Nostalgia Gamers.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:32.280
[SPEAKER_12]: However...

01:02:33.055 --> 01:02:40.500
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Cornhorse is willing to produce as many copies as is needed with just manuals and cartridges for those folks that may want to pick this up.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.261
[SPEAKER_12]: A VCS tech challenge.

01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:45.923
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, you know, they keep making these flashback consoles.

01:02:46.023 --> 01:02:50.486
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they should, you know, I think it would be cool to see games like this be put in the flashback consoles.

01:02:50.506 --> 01:02:51.366
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think they did this.

01:02:51.946 --> 01:02:55.589
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember a story way, way back when Atari Flashback 2 came out.

01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:57.330
[SPEAKER_12]: They had like a contest, like a 24-hour development contest.

01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:59.831
[SPEAKER_12]: and they put the winning game in the flashback too.

01:03:00.191 --> 01:03:06.836
[SPEAKER_12]: They should reach out to this guy and put this AVCS Tech Challenge in Flashback 3 if they do it.

01:03:07.916 --> 01:03:11.899
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got to really love the 2600 to still be developing for it.

01:03:12.579 --> 01:03:13.400
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what it looks like though?

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:16.261
[SPEAKER_12]: The game itself kind of looks like Enduro to me.

01:03:17.182 --> 01:03:19.984
[SPEAKER_12]: And how the hell I remember a game like Enduro, I'll never know.

01:03:21.204 --> 01:03:23.646
[SPEAKER_12]: But instead of driving, it looks like a little guy running.

01:03:25.104 --> 01:03:25.545
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of cool.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:27.627
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

01:03:28.748 --> 01:03:33.472
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, brand new news here, talking about TV now.

01:03:34.082 --> 01:03:44.386
[SPEAKER_02]: Direct TV and IGN have teamed up with Microsoft and a bunch of other companies to put together a brand new pro gaming series called the Championship Gaming Series.

01:03:45.086 --> 01:03:50.008
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically a new professional gaming league that will air competitions exclusively to Direct TV.

01:03:50.748 --> 01:04:02.593
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently next weekend, Direct TV and the company will take over a 16,000 square foot airplane hangar at former Treasure Island Naval Base in San Francisco and turn it into an indoor video game arena.

01:04:03.345 --> 01:04:07.866
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Gotham Racing 3, Halo 2, DOA 4, Counter-Strike 1.6 The Weekends event will be aired in August.

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:30.145
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

01:04:50.117 --> 01:04:54.220
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because the one that we used to have, we just don't count anymore, period.

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:54.900
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't count it.

01:04:55.461 --> 01:04:58.082
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, we're going to go to a new section of our show.

01:04:58.643 --> 01:05:00.244
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, this is not a new section.

01:05:00.264 --> 01:05:02.485
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a section we do every week, but it's new for this week.

01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:03.926
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the Skype line.

01:05:04.286 --> 01:05:11.791
[SPEAKER_12]: If you would like to call into our program, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us, and you can call the show.

01:05:12.132 --> 01:05:18.956
[SPEAKER_12]: Our phone number is 916-226-9067, or you can call us on Skype, username OrangeloungeRadio.

01:05:18.996 --> 01:05:19.917
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the phones.

01:05:20.317 --> 01:05:21.299
[SPEAKER_12]: Legend of Zaku Legend of Zaku

01:05:30.974 --> 01:05:39.316
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, basically picking off of where you actually said about the whole X-Play fiasco and, you know, Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb just not doing their job.

01:05:39.376 --> 01:05:40.197
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now, wait a minute.

01:05:40.217 --> 01:05:41.697
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we say don't blame the hosts?

01:05:41.797 --> 01:05:46.819
[SPEAKER_08]: Because... I know, but I know, but still, as I said, you know, there's a lot of blame to go around.

01:05:46.899 --> 01:05:54.041
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only them two, but, you know, the people behind them that are making, you know, that are, you know, the people that are actually feeding them this stuff.

01:05:55.141 --> 01:05:58.582
[SPEAKER_08]: And I firmly believe that there's a bias against them.

01:05:59.417 --> 01:06:01.819
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a bias against Konami?

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:07.484
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, basically, any type of game that doesn't fit their criteria.

01:06:08.104 --> 01:06:12.908
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, in this case, they're just kissing the ass of Guitar Hero, basically.

01:06:12.928 --> 01:06:19.734
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I see now, from not only X-Play, but from GameSpot and other people that bastardize Beatmania.

01:06:20.354 --> 01:06:21.896
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the criteria?

01:06:22.691 --> 01:06:38.404
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, from what I've been seeing, they usually come down hard on good games that turn out to be really, you know, they really, you know, they really talk down on, you know, on good games, on really good games.

01:06:38.584 --> 01:06:43.668
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know... Was there another game that they did a review of that made you upset?

01:06:45.329 --> 01:06:46.610
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to remember right now.

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:53.333
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a while since I watched X-Play, but usually... Okay, that's alright.

01:06:53.353 --> 01:06:54.153
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't think of an example.

01:06:54.173 --> 01:06:59.176
[SPEAKER_12]: But to play Devil's Advocate for a bit, you're never going to agree with game reviews 100% of the time.

01:06:59.196 --> 01:07:01.077
[SPEAKER_12]: They're kind of meant to ruffle your feathers a little bit.

01:07:01.837 --> 01:07:04.738
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and that's the truth, and I understand that.

01:07:05.299 --> 01:07:10.141
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, the only thing, what I don't get is how, you know, they're saying...

01:07:10.856 --> 01:07:24.605
[SPEAKER_08]: They're taking one thing like Guitar Hero and making it hold more weight than something like Beatmania which has been around there for almost 10 times as long as Guitar Hero.

01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:25.305
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make sense.

01:07:25.465 --> 01:07:26.546
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody didn't do their homework.

01:07:26.726 --> 01:07:28.087
[SPEAKER_12]: It's as simple as that.

01:07:28.527 --> 01:07:29.248
[SPEAKER_08]: That too.

01:07:29.448 --> 01:07:35.452
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that from what I heard in the Beatmania review and expo, they only played the 5 key.

01:07:38.251 --> 01:07:49.394
[SPEAKER_08]: Zaku, honestly, I think they just gave it to some intern who did the review in a day, if even that.

01:07:49.534 --> 01:07:53.254
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's what happened, but, you know, two things happened.

01:07:53.294 --> 01:07:59.616
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good news for X-Play, because now we've spent how much time during this program essentially giving them free advertising, and two...

01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:07.285
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to make themselves look bad in that community for not having done that, but that's just part of life.

01:08:07.545 --> 01:08:07.926
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

01:08:07.986 --> 01:08:13.170
[SPEAKER_12]: We get criticized because we make mistakes sometimes, but we just have to realize shit happens.

01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:14.471
[SPEAKER_02]: We make lots of mistakes.

01:08:14.951 --> 01:08:16.032
[SPEAKER_12]: So what?

01:08:16.112 --> 01:08:18.634
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't claim to be all-knowing.

01:08:18.994 --> 01:08:28.241
[SPEAKER_12]: It pisses me off when I read things on the internet that bash on us for this type of stuff, and it's like we're supposed to be these all... We don't get paid for this.

01:08:28.782 --> 01:08:31.484
[SPEAKER_12]: If I was getting paid to do eight hours of research a day on video games...

01:08:31.924 --> 01:08:37.485
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything that comes out of my mouth, Loki's mouth, DarkSakura's mouth, is love of games and hobbyists.

01:08:37.545 --> 01:08:38.585
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hobbyists and things we do.

01:08:38.625 --> 01:08:43.186
[SPEAKER_08]: And these two guys go through playing the games before saying something about them.

01:08:43.887 --> 01:08:48.448
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas Adam and Morgan just read off the teleprompter.

01:08:48.468 --> 01:08:51.808
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to be honest, though, it would take forever for one person to play all the games.

01:08:51.948 --> 01:08:54.889
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, trying to play everything that comes out.

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:59.310
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when we first started doing the podcast full-time and everything.

01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:02.850
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just trying to play everything and you can't.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:04.111
[SPEAKER_02]: You really can't.

01:09:12.095 --> 01:09:19.919
[SPEAKER_12]: Adam was doing shows on ZDTV, the GameSpot TV, where I think the hosts were responsible for a lot more of the work.

01:09:19.979 --> 01:09:22.021
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can't discredit them as gamers.

01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:24.862
[SPEAKER_12]: Morgan was part of Screensavers a long time ago.

01:09:25.023 --> 01:09:35.829
[SPEAKER_08]: I would really take them a lot more seriously if they actually did more work as in actually giving an honest opinion rather than just reading it off.

01:09:35.849 --> 01:09:37.030
[SPEAKER_12]: That can't really happen.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.302
[SPEAKER_12]: That might be the producer or the network's problem, though.

01:09:41.322 --> 01:09:42.423
[SPEAKER_12]: But, Zaku, we've got to let you go.

01:09:42.783 --> 01:09:43.263
[SPEAKER_12]: We're running long.

01:09:43.283 --> 01:09:44.104
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to get another call.

01:09:44.124 --> 01:09:50.088
[SPEAKER_12]: But thank you so much for the perspective and making us talk about it a little bit.

01:09:50.108 --> 01:09:50.949
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to another call.

01:09:50.989 --> 01:09:52.230
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:52.650
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:54.971
[SPEAKER_12]: This is 23rd Magus.

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:55.992
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, 23rd Magus.

01:09:56.012 --> 01:09:58.694
[SPEAKER_12]: Back away from your speakers a little bit and tell us what's on your mind.

01:09:59.355 --> 01:10:02.757
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I just thought I'd pitch in with a little WoW update.

01:10:03.317 --> 01:10:03.838
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, what's up?

01:10:04.218 --> 01:10:05.519
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the resident WoW addict anyway.

01:10:07.045 --> 01:10:08.426
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, what's up on WoW?

01:10:09.026 --> 01:10:18.810
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, IGN has released a new story unveiling the new additions to World PvP in the 1.12 patch that should be coming out, I'd say probably within a month.

01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:28.994
[SPEAKER_09]: The Eastern Plaguelands will feature resource points that must be captured, and Silithus will have piles of magical dust called Silithist that must be collected.

01:10:29.614 --> 01:10:35.536
[SPEAKER_09]: Alliance and Horde players will fight over these resources, which, when turned in, will provide a zone-wide buff to your faction.

01:10:37.548 --> 01:10:45.932
[SPEAKER_09]: The 1.2 patch with the World PvP objectives, the Cross-Circle Battlegrounds, and the Rogue Talent Review should be live on the test rooms by Monday.

01:10:46.252 --> 01:10:53.676
[SPEAKER_12]: I did notice on WorldofWarcraft.com they posted the list of which... Magus, I have to let you go because we're getting really bad feedback.

01:10:53.896 --> 01:10:56.057
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me respond to that just a little bit, what he was saying.

01:10:56.857 --> 01:10:58.498
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the World of Warcraft update, that was cool.

01:10:59.098 --> 01:11:04.501
[SPEAKER_12]: But I did want to say really quickly that on WorldofWarcraft.com I did notice that they had the list...

01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:08.803
[SPEAKER_12]: of which realms are in which group for the cross-battle realms.

01:11:08.863 --> 01:11:15.405
[SPEAKER_12]: And, of course, I looked where Airy Peak is at, which is where we've been playing, and it looks like I'll be able to play my old friends on Doomhammer because we're in the same group.

01:11:15.745 --> 01:11:16.526
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of cool.

01:11:16.586 --> 01:11:17.706
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll see what happens with that.

01:11:18.026 --> 01:11:20.107
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the phones one more time.

01:11:20.167 --> 01:11:21.508
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:21.548 --> 01:11:21.948
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

01:11:22.668 --> 01:11:23.228
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Ranma.

01:11:23.268 --> 01:11:24.089
[SPEAKER_10]: Who am I supposed to be?

01:11:24.309 --> 01:11:24.569
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

01:11:24.589 --> 01:11:25.369
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind, Ranma?

01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:30.211
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to talk about a point that you made about customer service in gaming stores.

01:11:30.731 --> 01:11:32.852
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand exactly where you're coming from with that.

01:11:33.393 --> 01:11:33.853
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

01:11:33.933 --> 01:11:34.173
[SPEAKER_12]: How so?

01:11:35.371 --> 01:11:41.693
[SPEAKER_10]: I work at Staples, and if an item is not in stock, we have to go in the systems and track it down.

01:11:41.933 --> 01:11:47.075
[SPEAKER_10]: If we can't get from one machine, we have to go to the AS400 and check all the stores in the area.

01:11:47.475 --> 01:11:50.516
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to bend over backwards for the customers, make sure they get what they want.

01:11:50.796 --> 01:11:57.238
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have no problem doing that because when I do it for a customer, I expect the same thing done for me.

01:11:58.078 --> 01:12:04.760
[SPEAKER_12]: To be honest, that's a good company policy, but to be fair to whatever companies we were talking about earlier in the show,

01:12:05.242 --> 01:12:14.671
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have a representative to really give us the exact policy, so we can only talk about what your company is doing, which sounds like a good thing.

01:12:15.959 --> 01:12:20.940
[SPEAKER_10]: See, but the thing is, let's say that it's company policy with all these companies.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:27.822
[SPEAKER_10]: When it comes down to the individual stores, it seems that management of those stores or the employees just don't, how I say, don't give a shit.

01:12:28.022 --> 01:12:30.962
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I had to deal with the same thing that Sunday.

01:12:31.022 --> 01:12:32.903
[SPEAKER_10]: I went looking for a couple games at Circuit City.

01:12:33.123 --> 01:12:36.423
[SPEAKER_10]: They expected me to go calling all the stores for the games.

01:12:36.623 --> 01:12:38.944
[SPEAKER_10]: I said to the two people standing there that...

01:12:40.246 --> 01:12:41.147
[SPEAKER_10]: This is your job.

01:12:41.347 --> 01:12:44.352
[SPEAKER_10]: You're supposed to go looking at the computers for the games that I want.

01:12:44.613 --> 01:12:46.415
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here being very nice about it.

01:12:46.556 --> 01:12:48.499
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no need for you to be rude to me.

01:12:48.759 --> 01:12:53.146
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't you know the following day I called corporate and I gave them my two cents about it.

01:12:53.896 --> 01:12:59.319
[SPEAKER_12]: I was told by a game store once when I called in asking if they had a certain game in stock and it wasn't anything major.

01:12:59.339 --> 01:13:02.441
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't talking like an Xbox 360 or Halo 2 or something.

01:13:02.802 --> 01:13:06.324
[SPEAKER_12]: I called in asking if a game was in stock and I was told, I'm busy right now.

01:13:06.384 --> 01:13:08.645
[SPEAKER_12]: Come down and look and see if we have it on the shelves.

01:13:08.945 --> 01:13:12.127
[SPEAKER_12]: Needless to say, I bought the game at their competitor across town.

01:13:13.783 --> 01:13:14.484
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

01:13:35.405 --> 01:13:43.908
[SPEAKER_12]: that work at these type of places, and it could be anything from the GameStop EB stores to Best Buy, Office Depot, Staples to mom-pop stores, whatever.

01:13:44.268 --> 01:13:56.072
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in mind that it might be an inconvenience sometimes, but bad customer service leads to lost business, leads to your store getting closed and you getting laid off.

01:13:56.652 --> 01:13:59.853
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's one of the reasons why one of the guys at my job got fired on Tuesday.

01:14:00.294 --> 01:14:00.574
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

01:14:00.874 --> 01:14:01.254
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too bad.

01:14:01.897 --> 01:14:02.077
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

01:14:02.397 --> 01:14:04.898
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma, we've got to let you go to get more calls in, but thank you so much for the perspective.

01:14:04.938 --> 01:14:05.378
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, no problem.

01:14:05.398 --> 01:14:05.778
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

01:14:06.258 --> 01:14:06.719
[SPEAKER_10]: Much love.

01:14:07.059 --> 01:14:07.599
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, Ukyo.

01:14:07.839 --> 01:14:08.419
[SPEAKER_12]: Hugs and kisses.

01:14:08.539 --> 01:14:08.859
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye-bye.

01:14:08.939 --> 01:14:09.579
[SPEAKER_12]: Right back at you.

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:12.380
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

01:14:12.801 --> 01:14:13.681
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll do one more call.

01:14:13.721 --> 01:14:15.861
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody wants to call in on our Skype line.

01:14:15.922 --> 01:14:18.042
[SPEAKER_12]: It's www.warrenslaunchradio.com.

01:14:18.062 --> 01:14:21.403
[SPEAKER_12]: Click on Interact With Us or our phone number, 916-226-9067.

01:14:22.864 --> 01:14:26.345
[SPEAKER_12]: In the meantime, does anybody have any last-minute stories they wanted to get off their chest here in studio?

01:14:28.325 --> 01:14:29.066
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, is that a big no?

01:14:29.266 --> 01:14:29.726
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes.

01:14:30.516 --> 01:14:32.297
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura had a mic to her mouth first.

01:14:32.417 --> 01:14:33.498
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, uh-uh.

01:14:33.698 --> 01:14:34.558
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay, then Loki.

01:14:35.859 --> 01:14:37.459
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, nope, cut off by the Skype call.

01:14:37.479 --> 01:14:38.020
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.141
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:40.161 --> 01:14:40.541
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

01:14:41.281 --> 01:14:42.582
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is PK or Kira88.

01:14:43.702 --> 01:14:44.763
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, what was that?

01:14:45.983 --> 01:14:46.784
[SPEAKER_04]: This is PK or Kira88.

01:14:46.864 --> 01:14:48.665
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, PK or Kira88.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:49.245
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

01:14:50.286 --> 01:14:52.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, actually, yeah, I just got back on vacation from the Philippines.

01:14:53.887 --> 01:14:57.569
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing is, I spent a lot of time in the arcades over there.

01:14:58.209 --> 01:14:59.110
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing I noticed...

01:15:00.714 --> 01:15:04.416
[SPEAKER_04]: The social environment over there is much more lively than it is over here.

01:15:05.877 --> 01:15:06.438
[SPEAKER_12]: How so?

01:15:07.798 --> 01:15:11.621
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like, okay, it's not just the, say, hardcore gamers that are always there.

01:15:11.881 --> 01:15:12.661
[SPEAKER_04]: They're there all the time.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:22.828
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be, like, families and, you know, usually people that you wouldn't consider gamers that are hanging around, like, playing the games or just having fun.

01:15:23.028 --> 01:15:28.191
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you think families are more apt to play games together in the Philippines than they are here?

01:15:28.999 --> 01:15:36.261
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what, honestly, I think it's because of the social, economic conditions, because most of these families can't really afford, say, like, a console, a home console.

01:15:36.901 --> 01:15:43.382
[SPEAKER_04]: But, also at the same time, these arcades are making a lot more money than the arcades that we have over here.

01:15:43.802 --> 01:15:45.283
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet their games are, like, dirt cheap.

01:15:45.503 --> 01:15:51.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, I was playing Public Up Zero for, like, 25 cents a game.

01:15:52.064 --> 01:15:52.184
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

01:15:53.353 --> 01:15:54.534
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, very interesting perspective.

01:15:54.554 --> 01:15:59.037
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to let you go, buddy, because you're a little quiet, but thanks so much for calling in to us tonight.

01:15:59.077 --> 01:15:59.517
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

01:16:00.118 --> 01:16:08.844
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this reminds me of back when my parents used to take me down to Chuck E. Cheese back before it was all neon lights and ball bins, and it was actually just pizza and arcade.

01:16:10.965 --> 01:16:15.028
[SPEAKER_02]: They would totally take me down there, and we'd play games and stuff together as a family.

01:16:15.248 --> 01:16:17.830
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody would go and play different video games.

01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:18.511
[SPEAKER_12]: Not my mom.

01:16:18.931 --> 01:16:20.752
[SPEAKER_12]: She'd hand me a roll of quarters and go sit in the corner.

01:16:20.772 --> 01:16:21.533
[SPEAKER_12]: She'd be like, have fun, kid.

01:16:22.788 --> 01:16:24.489
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom would sometimes play Pac-Man with me.

01:16:24.609 --> 01:16:26.750
[SPEAKER_12]: My mom hates video games.

01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:38.415
[SPEAKER_12]: But she always kind of, like, every time something interesting happens with our show, like, you know, last year when we won the podcast award, or we were on, you know, you guys were on the news, and I think we were all on it at one point, too, or in the paper, remember that?

01:16:38.695 --> 01:16:40.136
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, those little things that happen?

01:16:40.416 --> 01:16:42.077
[SPEAKER_12]: My mom always kind of goes, huh.

01:16:42.957 --> 01:16:46.539
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, kind of one of those, wow, I always told them that would never amount to anything.

01:16:47.139 --> 01:16:48.640
[SPEAKER_12]: Boy, was I wrong, but that makes me feel good.

01:16:49.831 --> 01:16:52.954
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I still don't think it's amounted to much yet until we get an extra paycheck.

01:16:52.974 --> 01:16:53.554
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Apollo.

01:16:53.574 --> 01:16:59.039
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I just wanted to really talk about the arcades because I just came back from Japan a few weeks ago.

01:17:16.897 --> 01:17:19.978
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to talk about the arcades over there compared to the arcades here.

01:17:21.239 --> 01:17:22.340
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the comparison you made?

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:24.360
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, repeat that?

01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:25.661
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the comparison you made?

01:17:27.062 --> 01:17:35.706
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to talk about the arcades in Japan and America because the arcades in Japan are a whole lot busier and there's a lot more focus on different styles of gaming.

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:40.468
[SPEAKER_00]: And the UFO catchers, like the crane games are a lot bigger over there too.

01:17:40.728 --> 01:17:45.090
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just crazy how much more stuff they have there compared to what we have here.

01:17:46.318 --> 01:17:47.780
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you think it's different?

01:17:50.022 --> 01:17:54.646
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the population density in Japan is so much bigger.

01:17:56.188 --> 01:18:01.473
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that kind of makes it more possible for lots of people to go to one place.

01:18:03.976 --> 01:18:05.317
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, very interesting perspective.

01:18:05.357 --> 01:18:06.318
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate the phone call.

01:18:06.358 --> 01:18:07.059
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one, okay?

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:08.340
[SPEAKER_12]: Alrighty, thank you.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.141
[SPEAKER_12]: Later, bye-bye.

01:18:09.437 --> 01:18:11.038
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was actually a very good point.

01:18:11.518 --> 01:18:17.540
[SPEAKER_07]: Just with, you know, it's actually pretty commonplace for someone to get off work and then go to a game center.

01:18:18.241 --> 01:18:23.043
[SPEAKER_07]: Or for, you know, children after school to go to the game center or spend their Sundays there since school's on Saturday, too.

01:18:23.723 --> 01:18:32.127
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, I think that that's actually, because it's so integrated into everything and it has been for so long, I think that that is a good reason why it's, you know, surviving.

01:18:32.527 --> 01:18:37.929
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new game center going up by us, by a local theater that we have up in Eldry Hills.

01:18:38.616 --> 01:18:41.477
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new gaming center going on down there.

01:18:41.497 --> 01:18:45.399
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost looks like it could be a console gaming center, which I'm kind of interested to check out.

01:18:45.699 --> 01:18:49.161
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have it built yet, but it's going in.

01:18:49.201 --> 01:18:50.022
[SPEAKER_12]: Any of the last minute stories?

01:18:50.782 --> 01:18:52.883
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to mention one thing real quick.

01:18:53.763 --> 01:18:59.186
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a report about the Xbox 360 branded ecstasy popping up in the UK.

01:18:59.686 --> 01:19:00.727
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was kind of funny.

01:19:01.527 --> 01:19:04.088
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new type of ecstasy that they're calling Xbox 360 pills.

01:19:07.786 --> 01:19:08.207
[SPEAKER_02]: Jump in.

01:19:09.208 --> 01:19:11.992
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:19:13.073 --> 01:19:17.279
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I guess that's about going to wrap it up then for this week's edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:20.584
[SPEAKER_12]: We really appreciate you guys tuning in to us and supporting independent radio.

01:19:20.604 --> 01:19:21.325
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys rock.

01:19:21.769 --> 01:19:23.691
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:19:24.391 --> 01:19:25.292
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, your final thought.

01:19:25.772 --> 01:19:29.655
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to play more Chromehounds this week because I've only been playing the training missions.

01:19:29.675 --> 01:19:34.900
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get a lot more parts to actually make a mech so I can go play online.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.582
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been really trying to play more online games.

01:19:39.183 --> 01:19:46.109
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought is big thanks to Miklatov for being a special guest on the show tonight, even though we might get some angry emails from what he said in the first half, but that's all right.

01:19:46.881 --> 01:19:47.621
[SPEAKER_12]: Freedom of Speech, right?

01:19:48.062 --> 01:19:55.325
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to say I have to catch him up in level on WoW because he's an addict.

01:19:56.045 --> 01:19:56.826
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to mention.

01:19:56.846 --> 01:19:58.046
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with Annie.

01:19:58.126 --> 01:20:01.408
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you're supposed to mention, actually, according to the chat room.

01:20:02.048 --> 01:20:05.830
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone posted a link to some OLR card game that they're working on.

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:07.571
[SPEAKER_02]: Poozeater.

01:20:09.032 --> 01:20:10.432
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are crazy, but I love you.

01:20:11.052 --> 01:20:12.153
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

01:20:12.608 --> 01:20:13.649
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is two parts.

01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:15.570
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one is always reject false icons.

01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:17.051
[SPEAKER_07]: Second is define yourself.

01:20:17.091 --> 01:20:17.991
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't let the world define you.

01:20:20.833 --> 01:20:22.754
[SPEAKER_12]: You're such the mommy sometimes, but I like it.

01:20:24.114 --> 01:20:27.676
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to do with... You leave good moral messages for the youth of America.

01:20:27.696 --> 01:20:31.238
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had stuff going on, so that's very important right now.

01:20:31.258 --> 01:20:31.659
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand.

01:20:32.459 --> 01:20:32.739
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

01:20:32.999 --> 01:20:33.760
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's it, guys.

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:34.740
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see you next week.

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:37.962
[SPEAKER_12]: We are back on Sunday night, 6 o'clock, and we'll see you next time.

01:20:38.503 --> 01:20:40.964
[SPEAKER_12]: And you podcast folks, stay tuned to our podcast feed.

01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:42.652
[SPEAKER_12]: and have a great week.

01:20:42.952 --> 01:20:43.552
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep on gaming.

01:20:43.792 --> 01:20:44.293
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't be a dick.
