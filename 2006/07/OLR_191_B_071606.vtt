00:15.000 --> 00:19.400
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.400 --> 00:25.500
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 191 for this July 16th, 2006.

00:25.500 --> 00:29.700
I think we got some of our chatroom issues from part A, at least we have a temporary fix tonight.

00:29.700 --> 00:33.860
Alright so hello to the chat room, we missed you guys during the very interesting second

00:33.860 --> 00:35.380
half of our part A this week.

00:35.380 --> 00:36.980
But our aim is improving.

00:36.980 --> 00:39.420
Yes, and Dark Sakura is here, back in the house.

00:39.420 --> 00:43.220
She visited us in the middle of part A there a little bit earlier than she anticipated

00:43.220 --> 00:44.580
getting back.

00:44.580 --> 00:49.660
She's here now to share some stories with you during part B. But not just yet, because

00:49.660 --> 00:52.140
I have a video game story I'd like to share first.

00:52.140 --> 00:53.400
Is that okay, Dark Sakura?

00:53.400 --> 00:54.400
It's about the Wii!

00:54.400 --> 00:55.400
I guess.

00:55.400 --> 01:04.960
Toys R Us in Australia is taking pre-orders for the Wii at what equates to $249 U.S.,

01:04.960 --> 01:09.320
but what's very interesting about this deal is that that comes with a free game.

01:09.320 --> 01:13.880
So folks are speculating that this is pretty much proving that the Wii is going to come

01:13.880 --> 01:17.880
with a pack-in game, which doesn't come as too much of a surprise.

01:17.880 --> 01:22.200
But if you consider, we haven't had a lot of pack-in games at launch for our console

01:22.200 --> 01:25.200
in quite a long time, so that's kind of interesting.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.920
And of course, many, many folks are speculating that it's going to be Wii Sports as the pack-in

01:28.920 --> 01:29.920
title.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.920
I mean, what a perfect pack-in title that would be for the Wii, because that would give

01:32.920 --> 01:36.300
you a little taste of everything what the Wii can do.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.240
And you know, if you think about it, that's one thing that they kind of sold at the Nintendo

01:39.240 --> 01:40.880
press conference as well.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.200
Remember that guy who won the contest?

01:43.200 --> 01:46.420
Remember when they flew all those guys to LA and then only let one come up on stage

01:46.420 --> 01:47.620
to play?

01:47.620 --> 01:50.060
It was Wii Sports, the tennis game.

01:50.060 --> 01:55.120
And Wii Tennis, I mean, it's fun, but it's not going to be a great tennis sim.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.320
It's really there to just show off what the Wii can do.

01:58.320 --> 02:02.800
So I couldn't see spending money on Wii Sports, but I think it would be a fun pack-in title.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.840
I think it would be good because it's also one of those titles that kind of shows you

02:06.840 --> 02:13.640
what the Wii can do and kind of orients you to using the controller and that type of stuff.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.760
And you could put a lot of those stupid tech demos and crap that they had on there because

02:16.760 --> 02:21.560
they were fun, stupid games that you could just put on this collection.

02:21.560 --> 02:26.460
not even call it Wii Sports, just have it, I don't know, be something.

02:26.460 --> 02:32.280
Maury in our chat room seems to think that World Class TrackMe needs to have a Wii version.

02:32.280 --> 02:36.560
I honestly think that Wii Sports sort of smacks of the Super Scope games.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.640
How so?

02:37.640 --> 02:40.840
It just had the multi-games to show off the different things you could play with the Super

02:40.840 --> 02:44.440
Scope like Blastris and that really weird mole game.

02:44.440 --> 02:48.320
Yeah, I like the mole game though, that was fun. It just makes me think of that.

02:48.320 --> 02:52.000
Um, alright, well that's all I have to say on my story for the Wii.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.840
Okay, well speaking of the Wii, there's been another

02:55.840 --> 02:59.360
another secret flap that's been spotted.

02:59.360 --> 03:03.480
How is this like the third or fourth secret flap that's on the Wii?

03:03.480 --> 03:07.640
Boy, the Wii must sure be feeling like it's, you know, getting violated all over

03:07.640 --> 03:09.960
left and right with people looking in every flap they can find.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.000
The Wii has compartments everywhere. I see.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.960
But um, no idea what it is. Um, looks like

03:15.960 --> 03:23.360
a SD card port, but it's a really odd position for it. Let me put it that way. What do I

03:23.360 --> 03:30.260
think it is? I think it might be just nothing. I think it's just maybe, it's a flap for nothing?

03:30.260 --> 03:35.900
I think it actually is not a flap, I think it's just kind of a hole that would be for,

03:35.900 --> 03:40.280
because it's at the very very bottom of the console. I mean if this were going to be in

03:40.280 --> 03:45.200
their little docking bay or whatever it is.

03:45.200 --> 03:51.280
I don't think you'd be able to access this panel, but my guess is it's probably just

03:51.280 --> 03:57.080
for the docking station, it's probably a clip so the whole thing snaps in so it doesn't

03:57.080 --> 03:58.080
come loose.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.660
That's my thought on that, I don't know.

04:00.660 --> 04:03.640
No idea what it is, but to be honest I don't care.

04:03.640 --> 04:08.200
It's not like some super duper secret thing, yeah VR is hidden in the tiny little thing

04:08.200 --> 04:09.200
right there.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.600
I don't think these flaps are going to have these earth-shattering new features.

04:12.600 --> 04:17.200
I think it's just going to be for plugs, cards, you know, things you can stick in your Wii.

04:17.200 --> 04:21.600
Because, yeah, even looking at this right now, the actual picture that they show of

04:21.600 --> 04:24.560
this said flap doesn't even look like a flap.

04:24.560 --> 04:31.160
It just looks like a part in the console where it might snap in.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.200
That's all it is.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.200
Yeah.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.640
Alright, now Dark Soccer, I know you have some stuff you want to share with the Wii

04:37.640 --> 04:41.460
with us too, but I also understand you have a special shout out you want to give, so please

04:41.460 --> 04:44.280
get that out before you move on.

04:44.280 --> 04:50.000
To one of my really good friends' friends, her name is Larissa.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.160
She was in a car accident a few days ago.

04:52.160 --> 04:58.440
I'd like to give a big shout out, and I don't think she's listening being that she's currently

04:58.440 --> 05:02.920
in the hospital, but for anyone who's listening who knows her, pass on that we wish her a

05:02.920 --> 05:05.880
very quick recovery and glad she's coming out of it okay.

05:05.880 --> 05:06.880
Absolutely.

05:06.880 --> 05:10.200
get out of the hospital fast because I know hospitals are not a fun place to be

05:10.200 --> 05:11.360
so please get well soon

05:11.360 --> 05:14.880
very much. Well as far as

05:14.880 --> 05:18.360
the story that I have there's actually some more

05:18.360 --> 05:22.200
games being mentioned that's coming out for

05:22.200 --> 05:26.600
Wii actually specifically from EA. Well there's also Need for Speed Carbon in

05:26.600 --> 05:27.760
Madden NFL but

05:27.760 --> 05:32.200
they're also announcing Tiger Woods, Godfather, SSX and Harry Potter coming

05:32.200 --> 05:32.520
out

05:32.520 --> 05:37.760
I wouldn't mind you know. Oh goody am I gonna get to cast spells with the Wii controller?

05:37.760 --> 05:40.960
That would actually be cool you know if you have to wave it a certain way that would be...

05:40.960 --> 05:42.880
You're a Harry Potter nerd what's the little

05:42.880 --> 05:45.760
spells, give me some of the spells they say like what makes the light

05:45.760 --> 05:49.400
luminous or something what do they say? Lumos. Lumos?

05:49.400 --> 05:53.240
Yeah. Can you imagine being able to do that? And if the Wii had a microphone in it too?

05:53.240 --> 05:56.360
That would be perfect. Use voice recognition. Oh my gosh

05:56.360 --> 06:01.760
Harry Potter fangirls everywhere are gonna like never leave the house. Isn't that going to be a microphone attachment?

06:01.760 --> 06:05.360
yeah they say that the we my well I don't think it's confirmed has a speaker

06:05.360 --> 06:06.760
in it we all know that for me three but

06:06.760 --> 06:11.000
it's a groomer that a speaker could easily be a microphone so why not have a

06:11.000 --> 06:14.040
microphone on it too I don't think we have confirmation on that yet though but

06:14.040 --> 06:17.120
imagine if it did have a microphone you could you know

06:17.120 --> 06:20.400
say you know luminous and move the move the

06:20.400 --> 06:23.520
thing and then you might even hear the spell come from the wand and it would

06:23.520 --> 06:24.480
even vibrate

06:24.480 --> 06:28.680
how crazy is that that would be special special it might

06:28.680 --> 06:34.160
You might need to go Ruminos for it to, uh, cause it doesn't understand some of the-

06:34.160 --> 06:36.980
That's right, if it's gonna be like, uh, brain training where you have to say,

06:36.980 --> 06:38.680
BREW! BREW!

06:38.680 --> 06:43.280
I swear it works! I swear it- go back to the OLR archives where I review brain training.

06:43.280 --> 06:47.280
It really works. If you- if you are having a hard time getting your DS to understand you saying blue,

06:47.280 --> 06:51.780
say BREW! And it works. Every time. At least for me. Exactly.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.780
So that's pretty awesome.

06:53.780 --> 06:58.280
But, some of those games I'm actually pretty- pretty cool. I- I wonder how SXX is gonna control.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.280
Maybe Godfather you could just go around shooting people.

07:00.280 --> 07:04.280
I think it's really interesting with all these Wii game announcements that our first thoughts are

07:04.280 --> 07:08.280
I wonder what it's going to play like on the Wii. I wonder what that controller is going to do for that game.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.280
Or how that's going to be different because of that whole Wii thing.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.280
This is very interesting how...

07:12.280 --> 07:18.280
I hope they're good because all it's going to take is a couple games that suck with that kind of controller configuration for people to go

07:18.280 --> 07:19.280
Ah, dammit.

07:19.280 --> 07:23.280
But every console has shitty games. I say the other way around.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.280
If you have a few stellar games it's really going to sell that console.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.280
It's all fun.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.380
There's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of crap games on every console that doesn't

07:31.380 --> 07:32.380
ruin it for them.

07:32.380 --> 07:36.760
There's, you know, PS2, wonderful console, legendary console to be remembered for years

07:36.760 --> 07:39.400
and years, has some real shit games on it.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.920
Well, you know what's something that's occurring to me is that with, there's mentioning a Tiger

07:42.920 --> 07:46.840
Woods game, what's stopping them from making like mocap golf?

07:46.840 --> 07:49.460
Or even police 911?

07:49.460 --> 07:50.460
With the Wii.

07:50.460 --> 07:51.460
Maybe?

07:51.460 --> 07:52.460
I don't know.

07:52.460 --> 07:56.680
I think those are franchises that our developer friends should be looking into.

07:56.680 --> 08:02.420
Speaking of the Wii though, and other fun things about it, IGN has actually come in

08:02.420 --> 08:08.480
contact with a Wii developer documentation, like kind of a little pamphlet that basically

08:08.480 --> 08:14.400
explains to developers how the Wii works, and some of the fun little details about it.

08:14.400 --> 08:19.120
One of the things that's pretty interesting is there's going to be 6 kilobytes of non-volatile

08:19.120 --> 08:29.840
memory in each controller. And the speculation is that it's possible that that will be for

08:29.840 --> 08:35.240
storing player settings. So if you're a person that uses controller 1 all the time, it's

08:35.240 --> 08:41.440
going to remember your settings and that's kind of neat. But other than that, they're

08:41.440 --> 08:47.280
They're also mentioning that the sensor bar itself is only going to be about 20 centimeters

08:47.280 --> 08:54.360
long and pretty much the LEDs I guess on the Wii controller and stuff are going to be for

08:54.360 --> 08:57.960
battery life and show you that kind of stuff.

08:57.960 --> 09:04.560
Also that light sources from fluorescent halogen plastic mirrors and many more interfere with

09:04.560 --> 09:05.960
the actual pointer.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.340
Oh interesting.

09:07.340 --> 09:09.800
But to eliminate this though the actual inter...

09:09.800 --> 09:10.800
Don't play in a spaceship.

09:10.800 --> 09:17.000
To eliminate this, it says the pointer must identify the sensor bar and mark its two coordinates.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.700
And when pointing with the Wiimote, the unit is actually interfacing with the sensor bar,

09:21.700 --> 09:27.480
which translates the data to the television and in effect simulating a direct aim to the

09:27.480 --> 09:28.480
television.

09:28.480 --> 09:34.880
So, in a sense, it's basically comparing it to an eye measuring the coordinates between

09:34.880 --> 09:41.880
0 and 1023 on the x-axis and 0 and 767 on the y-axis. So it's basically seeing like

09:43.200 --> 09:48.560
a megapixel image or something like that. So it's kinda neat. And it says the pointer

09:48.560 --> 09:53.680
could sub as a camera. Probably like a Pokemon Snap game. Boy that controller will do your

09:53.680 --> 09:57.400
dishes pretty soon with all these things they keep saying. I can't wait for like the third

09:57.400 --> 10:01.340
party controllers to come out and you know some perverted Japanese company out there

10:01.340 --> 10:06.220
is gonna turn like Wii controller and sex toy you know it's gonna happen hello kitty

10:06.220 --> 10:13.140
Wii we'll see anyway Nintendo one of their biggest franchises is Pokemon and

10:13.140 --> 10:17.180
still after all these years Pokemon has some very loyal fans very very loyal

10:17.180 --> 10:21.300
fans diamond and pearl is coming out very soon and a lot of folks have been

10:21.300 --> 10:25.420
asking when is Pokemon gonna go online well it looks like it's going to be

10:25.420 --> 10:29.820
happening soon there are some scans from Famitsu that show Pokemon diamond and

10:29.820 --> 10:34.460
Pearl with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection logo.

10:34.460 --> 10:38.060
Now, they have said before that the game would support Wi-Fi,

10:38.060 --> 10:41.940
but it was unclear if that meant local Wi-Fi or internet Wi-Fi.

10:41.940 --> 10:45.060
With this logo, it knows it's going to be internet Wi-Fi.

10:45.060 --> 10:47.540
So now we don't know what it's going to be.

10:47.540 --> 10:48.780
Is it going to be battling?

10:48.780 --> 10:51.500
Is it going to be Pokemon trading only?

10:51.500 --> 10:54.180
Is it going to be emailing, like Final Fantasy III is having,

10:54.180 --> 10:56.100
like we talked about last week, or what it's going to be?

10:56.100 --> 10:56.900
We don't know yet.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.380
But more details, hopefully, to come soon.

10:58.380 --> 11:03.480
That is definitely if you're a Pokemon fan still very exciting and I think could actually breathe new life into the series

11:03.480 --> 11:07.920
And I can't remember where I read this and I really apologize. I think it was on live journal

11:07.920 --> 11:09.640
It was on one of the live journal communities

11:09.640 --> 11:12.920
I'm on which is a good chance to plug the orange lounge live journal community as well

11:12.920 --> 11:15.400
We have a live journal and a myspace, please

11:16.160 --> 11:21.080
Head on over and join if you're a live journal member or myspace member and look for us orange orange lounge on

11:21.480 --> 11:23.480
live journal and orange on radio on myspace

11:23.480 --> 11:28.120
Somebody was talking about how they really need to do a Pokemon MMO

11:28.120 --> 11:32.720
you know, because Pokemon is like the perfect game to make an MMO out of, I mean really

11:32.720 --> 11:36.200
you know, go out, collect monsters, fight other trainers, it's just a matter of

11:36.200 --> 11:37.480
finding a good concept

11:37.480 --> 11:42.000
isn't it kind of surprising? I mean it is and it isn't. Nintendo really doesn't do MMOs

11:42.000 --> 11:42.920
that they never have

11:42.920 --> 11:46.520
but really here's the perfect opportunity for them to get into

11:46.520 --> 11:50.040
the MMO and I bet it would be a really big game. I wonder

11:50.040 --> 11:53.540
why they're holding back. I mean, maybe the Wii will

11:53.540 --> 11:57.100
will see something new, but do you think Pokemon could work as an MMO?

11:57.100 --> 12:01.100
I don't know. I don't like Pokemon. I think it would work very well as an MMO.

12:01.100 --> 12:05.460
Just because, I mean, what's gonna be different in your experience?

12:05.460 --> 12:08.220
When you're playing through Pokemon, you go through and you challenge other

12:08.220 --> 12:11.180
people in the game. Why not go around and challenge other people?

12:11.180 --> 12:14.420
You know, say they have their own gym there and that's like your different server

12:14.420 --> 12:17.740
or... I think that would work very well.

12:17.740 --> 12:20.860
and then your exploring modes are like going out and catching your different

12:20.860 --> 12:21.380
Pokemon

12:21.380 --> 12:25.140
I'm looking to see here on the chat room see if

12:25.140 --> 12:28.660
anybody has comments. Mostly it's either Pokemon bashing or Pokemon supporting

12:28.660 --> 12:32.840
like we have SatanBanana says someone needs to kill Pokemon series because it

12:32.840 --> 12:34.140
sucks if you're over nine

12:34.140 --> 12:37.220
and then 23rd Magus probably tells SatanBanana to go to hell

12:37.220 --> 12:41.540
so we definitely have a... it may suck but it sounds like crazy

12:41.540 --> 12:45.340
yeah and you know a lot of you, somebody else said who said they like the

12:45.340 --> 12:49.940
Games, but not the oh here. We go l3 pa says the show is horrible, but the games are awesome

12:50.500 --> 12:56.340
Pokemon snap I love Pokemon snap. I think pokemons a great concept the whole monster collecting

12:56.340 --> 13:00.740
I mean, it's it's it's a great franchise. I you know yeah the cartoon

13:00.740 --> 13:04.700
I may be over it now. I used to watch the cartoon a long time ago, and I think I'm kind of over it now

13:04.700 --> 13:09.240
I don't know. Maybe I'd watch it once in a while. It's like a funny thing. It's a stoner cartoon now

13:09.860 --> 13:13.940
Maybe I could see that dude man. It's dark in pika

13:13.940 --> 13:14.940
Pikachu!

13:14.940 --> 13:15.940
Pikachu!

13:15.940 --> 13:16.940
Pikachu!

13:16.940 --> 13:18.620
Maybe, I don't know.

13:18.620 --> 13:23.660
But the games are neat, and the problem is, for me, the games have so much more potential

13:23.660 --> 13:26.540
than what Nintendo's doing with it, that that's just my opinion.

13:26.540 --> 13:27.540
I don't know.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.220
I like Pokemon Pinball, though.

13:29.220 --> 13:31.260
And Squirtle was a gay Pokemon, just so you know.

13:31.260 --> 13:34.380
If you didn't know that Squirtle is a gay Pokemon, if you want to know my reasons why,

13:34.380 --> 13:35.900
just email me, I'm not going to talk about it on air.

13:35.900 --> 13:36.900
Oh, I remember that.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.900
Yeah, I think I have a...

13:38.900 --> 13:41.820
Just look up a book, it's called Come Out, Squirtle, and it'll explain everything.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.820
Alright, anyway.

13:42.820 --> 13:43.820
You gave me a copy of that.

13:43.820 --> 13:47.580
That's funny. Actually, I have different types of battle stuff in mind though.

13:47.580 --> 13:48.080
Oh, yes.

13:48.080 --> 13:53.100
Neo Geo Battle Colosseum. That makes me particularly happy since I'm an SNK fangirl.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.960
Oh, what am I saying? I'm a fangirl of just about any game, but

13:56.740 --> 13:59.860
we're gonna be getting it by Ignition. It's actually going to

14:00.660 --> 14:03.280
Gonna be out in Europe on PS2 in the autumn.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.340
What's basically what Battle Colosseum is, it's a

14:09.060 --> 14:12.620
fighting which players use different characters from a range of SNK

14:12.620 --> 14:17.100
different games like World of Heroes, Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, Samurai

14:17.100 --> 14:23.500
Showdown, Last Blade, Metal Slug, Kizuna Encounter and you'll have your

14:23.500 --> 14:28.860
regular fighting modes but you also have like tag battle. It's sort of making me

14:28.860 --> 14:34.540
think of King of Fighters but not quite. There's also a rumor of six different

14:34.540 --> 14:40.580
hidden characters but it's actually going to be out with other games like

14:40.580 --> 14:46.580
King of Fighters 11, King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2, SNK vs Capcom Card Fighters, and Metal Slug Anthology.

14:46.580 --> 14:50.580
That'd be awesome, as if that game, one of the hidden fighters, is Magical Lord.

14:50.580 --> 14:53.580
Remember that game? That game is awesome.

14:53.580 --> 15:01.580
That's what I used to play at, like, when they had those Neo Geo machines down at, like, Rayleigh's or something like that.

15:01.580 --> 15:03.580
We need hidden characters to be Bub and Bob.

15:03.580 --> 15:07.580
You know what they need to do? They need to take this and kind of make another Capcom vs SNK.

15:07.580 --> 15:13.480
And actually put some of the you know characters like metal slug characters and stuff. I've been hearing rumors about

15:15.180 --> 15:17.180
DC DC vs. Capcom

15:17.980 --> 15:19.820
Yeah, that'd be pretty cool

15:19.820 --> 15:27.140
It's I think still a rumor. But yeah, they should actually do DC vs. Marvel as a fighting game. That would be tough

15:27.140 --> 15:29.100
I don't think either one of those

15:29.100 --> 15:32.820
Comic companies would want to do something like that, but I'm sure Capcom would love to make that game

15:32.820 --> 15:35.020
They weren't together before.

15:35.020 --> 15:38.880
Eddie in our chat room seems to think that the listeners should rally together to make

15:38.880 --> 15:41.780
an Orange Longs radio card game.

15:41.780 --> 15:42.780
I don't think there's enough.

15:42.780 --> 15:44.060
Our own collectible card game?

15:44.060 --> 15:47.840
You would have to really go back into the show's history to get enough people, I mean

15:47.840 --> 15:50.720
granted there's the three of us that host the show and obviously Mikatov's here half

15:50.720 --> 15:53.980
the time and you know even in recent memory we've had some other guests but really we

15:53.980 --> 15:58.820
haven't had like the orgy of guests we used to have during some of our live shows back

15:58.820 --> 15:59.820
in the day.

15:59.820 --> 16:01.900
I mean you'd have to way go back to some of our old members.

16:01.900 --> 16:06.860
could do it like they do in Magic, you know, where you have your different, your fire,

16:06.860 --> 16:07.860
you know, your different...

16:07.860 --> 16:08.860
What would you have?

16:08.860 --> 16:09.860
Fire Jamie and Earth Jamie?

16:09.860 --> 16:11.500
Dude, I have my, no, I have my red black deck.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.500
My red black deck was pretty nice.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.500
Alright, anyway, anyway.

16:13.500 --> 16:17.940
But they could, we could each have our own, like, series, you know, it'd be cool.

16:17.940 --> 16:18.940
Interesting.

16:18.940 --> 16:24.600
Well, speaking of battling, one battle has been decided here in the United States and

16:24.600 --> 16:27.180
that is the Battle of the Portable Systems.

16:27.180 --> 16:34.000
As if you didn't realize, last month, or actually even kind of sort of in May, the DS has actually

16:34.000 --> 16:37.500
overtaken the PSP in sales in the United States.

16:37.500 --> 16:42.400
So now the PSP can't, or Sony can't brag that the PSP is at least winning the United States

16:42.400 --> 16:45.860
because they're getting their ass handed to them now.

16:45.860 --> 16:50.620
Sales though, overall in video games have gone up about 25%, but in the sold units as

16:50.620 --> 17:03.380
far as the two consoles are concerned. The Nintendo DS is right now over 5200,000 units

17:03.380 --> 17:08.500
and this was kind of towards the end of June so that number is probably even higher right

17:08.500 --> 17:18.360
now. And the PSP is right now at 4,600,000 units, so actually more, 4.7 million units.

17:18.360 --> 17:27.140
So basically the DS Lite kind of pushed them over the limit there and lots of new games

17:27.140 --> 17:32.540
of course coming out for the DS and to be honest the PSP hasn't had that many great

17:32.540 --> 17:35.440
releases lately so it's kind of hurting.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.700
But you watch when Vice City Stories comes out, oh yeah.

17:39.700 --> 17:46.460
But anyways, beyond that though the Xbox 360's finally reached 2 million units in the United

17:46.460 --> 17:53.460
States about time. And of course the PlayStation 2 is still selling pretty strong. They sold

17:53.460 --> 18:00.260
another 300,000 units in June alone and puts the total up to about 34 million units in

18:00.260 --> 18:05.580
the United States, which is almost as many Game Boy Advance units out there. They're

18:05.580 --> 18:10.320
up to almost 33 million Game Boy Advance. Of course, now that if you think about it,

18:10.320 --> 18:15.660
how many Game Boy Advance systems have there been? I mean, there's tons of different reiterations.

18:15.660 --> 18:18.100
So that's pretty cool.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.500
That sounds pretty cool.

18:19.500 --> 18:23.460
But as far as things that are coming out, we actually have

18:23.460 --> 18:27.420
our Europe release dates, if anybody is interested.

18:27.420 --> 18:29.540
I know our European listeners would probably be very

18:29.540 --> 18:29.940
interested in that.

18:29.940 --> 18:32.300
I've noticed we've actually had an increase in the amount

18:32.300 --> 18:34.220
of listeners coming from Europe lately.

18:34.220 --> 18:37.420
And part of the reason for that, as I understand it, is

18:37.420 --> 18:39.660
that folks over there are very appreciative that we are an

18:39.660 --> 18:42.740
American gaming show that is willing to acknowledge that

18:42.740 --> 18:43.820
there's other people around the world

18:43.820 --> 18:44.700
that play video games.

18:44.700 --> 18:48.140
so thank you guys for recognizing what we try to recognize

18:48.140 --> 18:50.420
I love hearing from our UK listeners, they're great

18:50.420 --> 18:53.340
I love hearing from everywhere, it doesn't have to be UK, it can be anywhere

18:53.340 --> 18:56.420
Seriously, we've gotten emails from all over the world

18:56.420 --> 18:57.900
and I'm always looking forward to it

18:57.900 --> 19:00.860
especially Canada lately because I was just there so you know that's

19:00.860 --> 19:03.500
I'm on a Canada kick lately

19:03.500 --> 19:06.700
I have to give you one of the maple cookies I got there so good

19:06.700 --> 19:10.820
I'm gonna go get one right now while you do the next story

19:10.820 --> 19:12.460
Addict huh?

19:12.460 --> 19:18.700
Okay, what we have coming out though, um, just a handful of games on the 21st, uh, the

19:18.700 --> 19:25.180
following three are on PSP, we have Def Jam, Fight for New York, The Takeover, Field Commander,

19:32.700 --> 19:38.100

19:38.100 --> 19:41.700

19:41.700 --> 19:44.740
is in Vancouver I'm gonna make them send me more of these cookies they are so

19:44.740 --> 19:54.480

19:58.420 --> 20:03.780

20:03.780 --> 20:09.180
forward to though the next week is a juice eliminator pac-man world 3 sieve

20:09.180 --> 20:15.200
Civ 4, Civ City Rome, lots of pretty cool stuff coming out.

20:15.200 --> 20:20.180
Actually a Shin Megami Tensei and the Ant Bully.

20:20.180 --> 20:21.180
Pretty cool.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.300
Okay, Miami Vice is on here.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.300
What's the point?

20:24.300 --> 20:25.300
They're doing a Miami Vice movie.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.300
Yeah, it's movie time.

20:26.300 --> 20:29.780
I know, but it's still, like, what's the point?

20:29.780 --> 20:32.380
Pastel suits should have stayed gone in the 80s.

20:32.380 --> 20:35.300
Okay, that's my tangent.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.300
Okay.

20:36.300 --> 20:44.260
Anyways, in the US, similar stuff, not a whole lot, but if you are ready for some football,

20:44.260 --> 20:51.060
NCAA Football 07 is coming out on pretty much every, well, Playstation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360

20:51.060 --> 20:54.020
and the PSP, so check those out.

20:54.020 --> 20:59.140
If you're not a fan of football, and you may be a fan of CG animated movies, in which case

20:59.140 --> 21:05.260
Monster House will be the game for you, and that comes out on Playstation 2, or GameCube,

21:05.260 --> 21:09.980
the DS and the Game Boy Advance. And if you're not a fan of either of those, maybe you're

21:09.980 --> 21:15.480
a fan of Super Dragon Ball Z, which is coming out on Playstation 2. Then of course there's

21:15.480 --> 21:21.880
Blade Dancer on the PSP Valkyrie Profile Lenith, which is a remake of the very first Valkyrie

21:21.880 --> 21:28.880
Profile on the PSP. And Miami Vice is also coming out on the PSP. And that was a PSP

21:28.880 --> 21:33.080
only title, which was kind of interesting, but it looks pretty decent. Be sure to check

21:33.080 --> 21:46.560
it out. Anyways, did you want to say something about The Sims 2? Oh, I'm sorry, yes. I did

21:46.560 --> 21:50.600
want to mention something. I've been chatting, we have two listeners from Vancouver in chat

21:50.600 --> 21:54.320
so I'm reminiscing my trip and telling them where to get the cookies that Jamie and I

21:54.320 --> 21:59.440
are eating right now. Those cookies are addicting. There's a farmer's market they do at this

21:59.440 --> 22:02.600
little island called Granville Island in Vancouver. You know what, I'm sorry to turn this into

22:02.600 --> 22:08.640
cookie chat, just do your game play. Anyways, I thought I would like to talk about something.

22:08.640 --> 22:12.480
GameSpot actually, they had their kind of retail radar thing. And there's also, I think

22:12.480 --> 22:18.840
there's actually a rumor control article that they had about, during E3, EA had a game coming

22:18.840 --> 22:25.080
out called Sims 2 Pets. And Sims 2 Pets was supposed to be this PC only, kind of almost

22:25.080 --> 22:28.760
Looks like an expansion for The Sims 2.

22:28.760 --> 22:36.280
But I can confirm now today that Sims 2 Pets is actually coming to the consoles and you'll

22:36.280 --> 22:38.720
be able to play that here pretty soon.

22:38.720 --> 22:48.920
It is coming out here I believe towards the fourth quarter.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.560
It's basically October 18th is the date.

22:51.560 --> 22:56.560
PlayStation 2 and GameCube are going to be $32.99 retail, and it's also going to be coming

22:56.560 --> 23:02.840
out in the DS and Game Boy Advance for $29.99, so be sure to check that out in October.

23:02.840 --> 23:06.420
So more Sims 2 games for you.

23:06.420 --> 23:10.120
And you know, that kind of seems like Nintendogs to me, but whatever.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.120
Maybe you can kill them.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.120
Ooh!

23:12.120 --> 23:13.120
Ooh!

23:13.120 --> 23:19.280
I am going to check this game out, especially on the PC, because if you can kill it, granted

23:19.280 --> 23:24.760
You know morbid, but I killed the sims. So, you know GS 191 in Chaz an excellent point though

23:24.800 --> 23:28.540
He has a message to EA here. Stop making the sims and work on spore

23:30.080 --> 23:35.600
They are working on spore. Yeah, but I like spore more even from the demos I've seen I'm like

23:36.120 --> 23:38.640
spore needs sport now

23:39.280 --> 23:41.160
Give it to me

23:41.160 --> 23:46.440
Seriously, that game is gonna be serious crack for people. Yeah, you think the sims is bad. Just wait for spore

23:46.440 --> 23:50.740
I'm telling you for is that's all people are gonna be talking about next year people in

23:51.580 --> 23:56.540
China are gonna be killing themselves for spending too much time on there. They're gonna leave babies in hot cars and

23:57.100 --> 23:59.100
Not feed them and all that fun stuff

23:59.740 --> 24:07.120
All right. Anyway moving to a completely different topic regarding an upcoming Mario game. Well Mario hoops anyway

24:08.400 --> 24:14.620
Squeenix has added five characters from the Final Fantasy world into the DS game

24:14.620 --> 24:19.300
Mario hoops because they're actually making the game so it's kinda like they

24:19.300 --> 24:23.540
you know borrowed Mario stuff but here they're putting these characters into

24:23.540 --> 24:24.100
the game

24:24.100 --> 24:27.860
Moogle, White Mage, Ninja, Black Mage

24:27.860 --> 24:31.020
and a Cactuar named Sabotender

24:31.020 --> 24:34.660
so we're not sure quite what that means yet but at least you're getting a Cactuar so

24:34.660 --> 24:35.340
that's kinda cool

24:35.340 --> 24:39.940
makes me think of this great overlooked PS1 title, at least I like this game

24:39.940 --> 24:42.060
I don't think a lot of people did but Chocobo Racing

24:42.060 --> 24:45.660
was a game they had on PS1, it was kind of like a Mario Kart type game, but you could

24:45.660 --> 24:51.540
be like White Mage or Black Mage or a Chocobo, and you could actually unlock Squall, I think

24:51.540 --> 24:54.940
was one, and I want to say you got Cloud at some point too, you could unlock all these

24:54.940 --> 24:59.780
characters, it was actually a fun little racer, I really wish they'd revisit that concept,

24:59.780 --> 25:02.620
I think it was a cute little game.

25:02.620 --> 25:11.380
My message to Square and Nintendo, stop working on Mario Hoops, no one cares about Mario Hoops,

25:11.380 --> 25:17.360
I care about a new Super Mario RPG, that's what Nintendo and Square Enix should be working

25:17.360 --> 25:18.360
on.

25:18.360 --> 25:22.860
It's not a stupid basketball game, whatever.

25:22.860 --> 25:25.020
But fine, at least they're doing something new.

25:25.020 --> 25:27.780
I can't complain I guess, but I will.

25:27.780 --> 25:28.780
I will complain.

25:28.780 --> 25:35.820
Anyways, on a completely different topic though, and actually kind of follows with more complaining.

25:35.820 --> 25:43.780
Some of the ex-frag dolls are attacking the whole sponsorships of gaming teams and girl

25:43.780 --> 25:48.020
gamers topic and it's kind of interesting though.

25:48.020 --> 25:55.020
And basically quote here from them, although we may have strong opinions, you can be sure

25:55.020 --> 25:58.840
of one thing, we're not here to endorse any product or sell you anything.

25:58.840 --> 26:03.140
If we say it, it's because we mean it, not because it pays our wage.

26:03.140 --> 26:10.000
kind of, you know, basically attacking the Frag dolls and those girl gaming teams, especially

26:10.000 --> 26:15.440
the ones that are sponsored by Ubisoft or Microsoft, etc. Anyways, let me get back more

26:15.440 --> 26:22.500
into this here. On a similar note, we may be both girls who game, but we're not here

26:22.500 --> 26:27.360
to wave the girl gamer flag. We believe that drawing attention to the gender, you create

26:27.360 --> 26:32.500
a barrier that's otherwise irrelevant. In our experience, promoting girl gamers can

26:32.500 --> 26:40.800
often be used as a cover story of big business, but trying to widen its market share while

26:40.800 --> 26:46.480
still getting some pretty faces in the magazines. In other words, free advertising. So they're

26:46.480 --> 26:51.080
kind of coming out and saying that these girl gamer groups are nothing more than a marketing

26:51.080 --> 26:52.640
ploy and they suck.

26:52.640 --> 26:59.600
I don't really know what to think about all this stuff anymore. I'm just like, just shut

26:59.600 --> 27:02.640
up and play games. I don't care. Because what I want to tell a lot of these people, you

27:02.640 --> 27:05.960
know, the people that are passionate on both sides of it is like, make it about the games.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.960
Let's just go back to the games. You know, seriously, when it needs to come back down

27:09.960 --> 27:14.720
to, it needs to come to the arcade, where you've got, you know, some guy dressed up

27:14.720 --> 27:19.600
all like funky and shit and kicking the crap out of an arcade game. Sure, if a chick wants

27:19.600 --> 27:25.000
to walk up and then just, you know, completely defeat him in, you know, an actual game, great.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.240
It's all about gamers. It doesn't matter what sex race you are. As long as you kick ass

27:29.240 --> 27:32.280
in the games, that should be all that matters.

27:32.280 --> 27:37.240
That should be all that matters, and fortunately, if you are on the receiving end of the discrimination.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.240
And if you want to look...

27:38.240 --> 27:44.320
Yeah, but as a homosexual, I've been on somewhat the receiving end of that discrimination before

27:44.320 --> 27:47.720
too, you know, having to put up with a lot of MMOs, you know, that's gay and this is

27:47.720 --> 27:53.480
gay, and I don't let that kind of talk really get to me, but I know that it's tough for

27:53.480 --> 27:56.280
any type of minority, you know, really.

27:56.280 --> 28:02.940
But I don't know, at the same time it's like, because of the internet, in a way, people

28:02.940 --> 28:07.100
can be people that they're really not, at least in an MMO.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.900
Guys can play girls, girls can play guys.

28:08.900 --> 28:12.200
It's a great way for everybody to be anonymous.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.900
You don't know what's sitting behind an Xbox Live gamertag.

28:14.900 --> 28:18.860
Sure you can hear a voice, but even then some people play Xbox Live and don't use their

28:18.860 --> 28:19.860
voice.

28:19.860 --> 28:20.860
Or mask it.

28:20.860 --> 28:23.060
Well, you can't do that on 360, but the old school one you could.

28:23.060 --> 28:24.060
Oh, the old one, yeah.

28:24.060 --> 28:25.060
Even though it was awful.

28:25.060 --> 28:28.760
You know, I knew a guy in college that had a really, really high-pitched voice and sounded

28:28.760 --> 28:29.760
like a girl.

28:29.760 --> 28:34.380
And a lot of Xbox Live sounds like that, too, where you don't know what gender it is because

28:34.380 --> 28:35.380
it sounds like gender.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.380
I'm gonna pwn you, noob.

28:36.380 --> 28:39.620
You know, you can't tell really what they're saying.

28:39.620 --> 28:41.060
They all sound the same.

28:41.060 --> 28:42.940
Everybody sounds the same.

28:42.940 --> 28:49.220
Actually, if it's on a PSO, you get your own feedback first before you hear everybody else.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.280
And join the OL Army.

28:51.280 --> 28:54.840
We're all about, you know, just shut up and play the game.

28:54.840 --> 28:59.180
It doesn't matter what you look like, who you sleep with, what gender you are.

28:59.180 --> 29:00.180
It doesn't matter.

29:00.180 --> 29:01.180
It doesn't matter.

29:01.180 --> 29:02.180
Just play a game and have fun.

29:02.180 --> 29:03.180
And don't be a dick.

29:03.180 --> 29:04.180
Yeah.

29:04.180 --> 29:05.180
Exactly.

29:05.180 --> 29:06.180
And speaking of the O.L.

29:06.180 --> 29:07.180
That's rule number one of the O.L. Army.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.180
Don't be a dick.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.180
Or a twat.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.640
He said twat.

29:11.640 --> 29:14.800
Speaking of things, though, that are super cool.

29:14.800 --> 29:15.800
Yes.

29:15.800 --> 29:16.800
Super cool.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.800
And you know, blah, blah, blah.

29:18.800 --> 29:19.800
Tongue tied today.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.120
Sorry to interrupt you, Jamie.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.120
I just wanted...

29:23.120 --> 29:24.120
No, you're not.

29:24.120 --> 29:30.720
about the OLR army real quick, I was going to mention that we did start a clan on ChromeHounds.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.920
And if you want to join it, there's a couple things you should know. First thing, you've

29:33.920 --> 29:39.840
got to be a member of the Kingdom of Salkar, which is one of the alliances on there when

29:39.840 --> 29:43.800
you start the game, so when you're creating a character. And then what you'll do is search

29:43.800 --> 29:52.620
for OLR, all capital, and then MY. And basically that's the OLR army. And we're looking for

29:52.620 --> 29:57.020
anybody that's got a mech in the game, doesn't matter what, you know, you're playing, that's

29:57.020 --> 30:04.260
all good. And there is a password though. UpUpDownDown is the password. I couldn't add

30:04.260 --> 30:08.500
the rest of the Konami code because there's just not enough space for it, but UpUpDownDown

30:08.500 --> 30:12.860
is the password to get in. And don't be a dick. And don't be a dick. You can be a dick

30:12.860 --> 30:16.980
to other people, that's perfectly fine in the game. Don't be a dick to each other. We

30:16.980 --> 30:22.380
We totally approve of smack talking in the game, that's fine, because after all, you're

30:22.380 --> 30:23.380
all on a team.

30:23.380 --> 30:25.140
Be excellent to each other.

30:25.140 --> 30:27.580
Party on.

30:27.580 --> 30:28.940
Are we gonna party on?

30:28.940 --> 30:30.420
So can I do my thing now?

30:30.420 --> 30:32.260
Yes you may, yes you may do your thing.

30:32.260 --> 30:33.620
Do you need your music for your thing?

30:33.620 --> 30:36.620
I do, I feel incomplete without it.

30:36.620 --> 30:42.020
Yay, I'm so happy with you.

30:42.020 --> 30:46.420
So I have been hanging out on the interwebs, and actually this is one that was brought

30:46.420 --> 30:54.500
to my attention at California Extreme it's go to www.thefutureofpinball.com

30:54.500 --> 31:00.140
yeah again I'm still stuck on pinball but this actually we watched their

31:00.140 --> 31:05.940
little discussion they had about a movie that the guy behind this is doing about

31:05.940 --> 31:10.300
the pinball 2000 series you know if you've ever seen the revenge from Mars

31:10.300 --> 31:15.900
or wasn't there an episode 1 machine it has video integrated into the pinball

31:15.900 --> 31:19.140
oh yeah those machines are cool yeah this was actually

31:19.140 --> 31:22.740
there's some more information on the site as well as a trailer for the movie he's

31:22.740 --> 31:23.300
working on

31:23.300 --> 31:27.940
but he basically interviewed a bunch of the Williams designers and some of the

31:27.940 --> 31:31.940
higher-ups in the company to see what happened because

31:31.940 --> 31:35.620
pinball basically the way that the pinball industry was staying going

31:35.620 --> 31:38.860
was the fact that you have this machine that does this

31:38.860 --> 31:42.380
okay now we have to make this machine obsolete our competition is

31:42.380 --> 31:47.460
ourself because I mean once you know we lost Capcom and it Williams basically

31:47.460 --> 31:53.100
only had themselves to keep you know with to keep that whole area open they

31:53.100 --> 31:56.860
had to basically make their old machines obsolete and make new things people want

31:56.860 --> 32:01.860
to do so pinball 2000 was how they were going to revive the whole pinball

32:01.860 --> 32:07.060
industry except they decided to close it down anyway now they make casino

32:07.060 --> 32:13.660
machines but this it was it was very cool it also has some footage of some

32:13.660 --> 32:19.460
very rare machines like this I think it's called pinball carnival or

32:19.460 --> 32:24.940
something to that effect but it's basically like a multi-layer pinball

32:24.940 --> 32:27.980
machine we have to work about getting it to the top of the thing it's very cool

32:27.980 --> 32:33.100
very cool very big machine but lots of lots of really cool stuff if you're into

32:33.100 --> 32:36.260
pinball if you're into video games in general because the other good thing

32:36.260 --> 32:40.140
about this is that it brings in, um, techniques that were actually incorporated into some

32:40.140 --> 32:44.700
of the old games, like the, uh, what was the update to Space Invaders? Where you have the

32:44.700 --> 32:47.340
background behind it, but the thing projected over it.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.940
I don't remember, but yeah, I know what game you're talking about, though.

32:50.940 --> 32:54.940
But, um, it's, it's, it's very cool. Actually, just checking out again, it's the future of

32:54.940 --> 33:00.780
pinball.com. I think this guy's movie is supposed to be out around October, I want to say. So,

33:00.780 --> 33:05.260
um, check out the trailer. Lots of good stuff. Very interesting.

33:05.260 --> 33:13.620
Excellent. And speaking about the next generation of stuff, Microsoft, of course, revealed this

33:13.620 --> 33:20.220
week their brand new media player called the Zune. And no, it's not meant for games. But

33:20.220 --> 33:25.420
it does look very similar to an iPod, kind of. I mean, it's got a giant screen on it

33:25.420 --> 33:33.260
though. But it's basically going to be used for just playing games and probably, or not

33:33.260 --> 33:38.900
games. I just contradicted myself there. They said they might be used for some games like

33:38.900 --> 33:42.260
live arcade games or something like that. You know kind of the same stuff that you see

33:42.260 --> 33:45.620
on iPods nowadays where they have the little simple games on there but mainly for music

33:45.620 --> 33:50.580
and media. Probably to tie in with some other stuff that they're going to be launching here.

33:50.580 --> 33:56.160
But it is all part of this Microsoft's Project Argo and supposedly this isn't the only device

33:56.160 --> 34:00.980
that they're releasing as part of that so maybe a portable gaming device out there but

34:00.980 --> 34:04.900
not this one. So the Zune is not a gaming device.

34:04.900 --> 34:11.300
Alright, moving on to a completely different topic in regards to Sony and

34:11.300 --> 34:14.640
the Blu-ray. This is kind of a iffy thing, because it came through Internet Movie

34:14.640 --> 34:15.580
Database, but

34:15.580 --> 34:19.940
a Chinese newspaper is reporting that Sony is having some major problems with

34:19.940 --> 34:21.260
Blu-ray production.

34:21.260 --> 34:25.580
Supposedly, production facilities are not being able to meet the demand for the

34:25.580 --> 34:26.380
diode

34:26.380 --> 34:29.780
that generates the blue laser that puts the blue in Blu-ray.

34:29.780 --> 34:33.100
and apparently Sony's own plants and

34:33.100 --> 34:36.180
some at Nisha Corp in Japan have

34:36.180 --> 34:40.100
been having run-ins regarding supply shortcoming. This may not only

34:40.100 --> 34:44.180
affect the supply of DVD players' Blu-ray, but it might also affect the

34:44.180 --> 34:48.060
PlayStation 3. So, I don't know,

34:48.060 --> 34:50.980
could be running into some delay problems with PlayStation 3. Delays are

34:50.980 --> 34:51.740
possibly

34:51.740 --> 34:57.380
low-yields, might even have more of a shortage than the Xbox 360.

34:57.380 --> 35:01.340
people thought you know the xbox 360 launch was botched

35:01.340 --> 35:05.740
you ain't seen nothing yet

35:05.740 --> 35:06.920
well uh...

35:06.920 --> 35:11.680
you know there's supposed to be uh... a uh... pirates mmo

35:11.680 --> 35:13.620
pirates of caribbean

35:13.620 --> 35:18.300
well um... they're saying that there's going to be user submitted content

35:18.300 --> 35:19.660
now

35:19.660 --> 35:21.260
as far as

35:21.260 --> 35:25.820
user submitted content i'm really not sure

35:25.820 --> 35:28.180
how that's going to be

35:28.180 --> 35:29.660
feasible in game

35:29.660 --> 35:34.520
honestly, I'm going to go ahead and read this quote here off of Kotaku

35:34.520 --> 35:38.260
it simply cannot be the case that flying lab meant what they say above basically

35:38.260 --> 35:39.660
what they were saying

35:39.660 --> 35:41.200
is that uh...

35:41.200 --> 35:45.620
they're going to let you put in user submitted and peer reviewed content

35:45.620 --> 35:49.540
uh... but to get back into the quote the developers must intend to have a high

35:49.540 --> 35:52.640
degree of control over the designs that make their way into the world because it

35:52.640 --> 35:57.000
It is a certainty that if they don't want the entire Port Royal Harbor to look like

35:57.000 --> 36:02.440
t-shirts at a fanfare, with sales that featured large-breasted elven princesses Darth Vader

36:02.440 --> 36:08.680
in a jaunty pirate hat, and slogans like Minus 50 DKP or WTS PST.

36:08.680 --> 36:12.480
That's great, that's a great quote.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.620
How many freaking Jack Sparrows are going to be on that game, you know?

36:15.620 --> 36:18.160
Just like how many Sephiroths are in Final Fantasy XI.

36:18.160 --> 36:19.760
Captain Jack Sephiroth.

36:19.760 --> 36:26.540
I will kill you all and look hot I think the idea I haven't I'm gonna be honest

36:26.540 --> 36:29.700
I'm probably the only person in the world that has not seen either Pirates of the Caribbean movie

36:30.300 --> 36:33.600
But I still think the concept of this MMO game is kind of cool

36:33.600 --> 36:35.600
except it does make me cry a little bit because

36:35.780 --> 36:39.740
Puzzle pirates was such the cutest little MMO and you know

36:39.740 --> 36:46.300
There's been there's been pirate people that love playing that game like long before Pirates of the Caribbean was you know

36:46.300 --> 36:49.660
what everybody was talking about so I kind of I kind of feel bad for those

36:49.660 --> 36:54.180
guys but they'll keep their game going it's it's it's pretty cute oh yeah

36:54.180 --> 36:57.300
there's still puzzle pirates going and it's it's a cute game I I don't I

36:57.300 --> 37:00.820
unfortunately don't really have the time for it and you know cuz I'm playing too

37:00.820 --> 37:04.620
much World of Warcraft but I respect puzzle pirates players it's it's a fun

37:04.620 --> 37:08.760
game I can't call you an addict anymore I know I'm playing on two servers now

37:08.760 --> 37:12.380
you freaking play it too you need to sign in to a yeah we actually have our

37:12.380 --> 37:17.180
our guild now. I'm in the guild, hello, you gave me bags and stuff. I know, I'm just saying.

37:17.180 --> 37:20.940
The only reason I didn't play the other day is because Airy Peak was down. Oh, oh yeah,

37:20.940 --> 37:24.500
that's true. Anyway, moving on, what else was I gonna say? Oh, Dance Cook in our chat

37:24.500 --> 37:30.900
room says, Puzzle Pirates needs to be on the DS. Say hell yeah. Mm-hmm. Amen. I think that

37:30.900 --> 37:34.900
would be a good game for the DS. Hell yeah. It would totally work with the touch screen,

37:34.900 --> 37:39.340
absolutely. Anyways, speaking of games, and speaking of Puzzle Pirates, Puzzle Pirates

37:39.340 --> 37:43.380
was free for a while during the little trial there. And that's when I played it, when it

37:43.380 --> 37:49.020
was free. Exactly. Well guess what? Xbox Live Arcade is going to get a free game. That's

37:49.020 --> 37:55.220
right, you too can play Texas Hold'em for free. It's coming out August 23rd and it will

37:55.220 --> 38:02.140
be free. That's no money. So be sure to check it out when it comes out. It's going to support

38:02.140 --> 38:07.980
tournaments and 8 players online. So it looks like Microsoft wants to get you gambling.

38:07.980 --> 38:11.740
pretty cool. And I think if I remember correctly, I think this game also supported the Live

38:11.740 --> 38:16.140
Vision camera, so that would be kind of neat too.

38:16.140 --> 38:23.140
There's actually another demo on Xbox 360. That's the Lord of the Rings demo. The Battle

38:23.960 --> 38:30.960
from Middle Earth 2 is actually on the Xbox Live Marketplace now. It's at 148.84 megabytes,

38:30.980 --> 38:36.540
that's pretty funny, and has a single multiplayer available. It has a tutorial to tell you how

38:36.540 --> 38:44.100
to play it actually there's also a first mission available on there too it's lots

38:44.100 --> 38:48.980
of themes have also been made available on the marketplace to you it's

38:48.980 --> 38:51.220
interesting as I saw this and I downloaded it but I haven't actually

38:51.220 --> 38:57.500
played it yet I don't know it it's kind of neat I have not really sure about the

38:57.500 --> 39:01.500
whole Lord of the Rings you know aspect of it I'm just waiting for a good RTS game to

39:01.500 --> 39:05.540
be on there you know something like command and conquer sure command and

39:05.540 --> 39:10.480
Conquer 3 when they're, you know, putting that out. Pretty awesome. Probably gonna put

39:10.480 --> 39:14.920
that on the 360. I think they were testing to see how well a game like that would do

39:14.920 --> 39:17.960
with Lord of the Rings, so it should be interesting.

39:17.960 --> 39:21.900
I will want to check this demo out, just because I like free stuff, even if it's just demos.

39:21.900 --> 39:26.100
One thing to mention though about that demo, they did have, slightly before the demo was

39:26.100 --> 39:33.260
released, they had a walkthrough of the demo, which was kind of interesting. That was pretty

39:33.260 --> 39:37.740
cool. And they also had a walkthrough of some other demo, and I remember a walkthrough of

39:37.740 --> 39:46.740
the demo of Two Human, I believe. Or no, not Two Human. God, what the hell the other game

39:46.740 --> 39:53.260
was. But anyways, there was three walkthrough on there, and two demos, so possibly a third

39:53.260 --> 39:58.860
demo coming out, and I think that was their new MMO, their sci-fi MMO, which for some

39:58.860 --> 40:06.200
reason the name is escaping me whatever all right we're gonna move on to an

40:06.200 --> 40:10.440
interactive element of our show we love to get mails from you guys every week at

40:10.440 --> 40:15.000
mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer likes to put on our hazmat

40:15.000 --> 40:19.920
suit and try to dodge the anthrax in there and pull out some of our favorite

40:19.920 --> 40:23.480
emails yeah there was there was some pretty good hate mail in there from what

40:23.480 --> 40:26.440
I remember from when I last ducked in there because I remember I went in for

40:26.440 --> 40:30.880
last week's show I pulled some out. A few things I've had good responses to but I

40:30.880 --> 40:34.320
have a few other I'm just only gonna look at a few of them today. All right

40:34.320 --> 40:37.880
well let's go in and yeah we don't have time to read every email I mean Dark

40:37.880 --> 40:40.720
Sakura reads them all and I read some of them too but we don't have time to

40:40.720 --> 40:44.040
respond on air to all of them so. But there are quite a number that I'm going

40:44.040 --> 40:47.960
to actually make a typed response to. All right real quick that was Mass Effect I

40:47.960 --> 40:53.280
was talking about thank you all right here we go mailbag. The first one comes

40:53.280 --> 40:57.580
from Brandon from Texas this is good afternoon actually this sort of

40:57.580 --> 41:01.200
afternoon now isn't it I am a new listener of your podcast and love it I

41:01.200 --> 41:04.800
just wanted to make a comment about the comments about game patching you did an

41:04.800 --> 41:09.120
episode 190 it is always a bad idea to rush your product out and fix it later

41:09.120 --> 41:13.560
the examples of why is Windows XP Microsoft has rushed the development of

41:13.560 --> 41:18.720
XP and caused to be inherently insecure it wasn't until service pack 2 that the

41:18.720 --> 41:22.280
majority of security flaws were fixed of course there are still problems the sad

41:22.280 --> 41:26.360
reality is that if there is buggy software it is a risk to security and

41:26.360 --> 41:30.200
your systems people can exploit a flaw in a Wii game it will cause cheating and

41:30.200 --> 41:34.520
other malignant hacks I'd like that use of malignant okay I'm the grammar nerd

41:34.520 --> 41:42.000
um not a tumor I may sound paranoid but listening to podcasts such as security

41:42.000 --> 41:47.060
now makes one very aware of risks in terms of gaming a fundamental piece of

41:47.060 --> 41:51.820
software could be damaged if there is a bug that affects system memory data such

41:51.820 --> 41:57.160
as virtual console games on the Wii, it could corrupt the data. What will this world come

41:57.160 --> 42:02.120
to if we do not have proper quality control prior to release?" Very good point.

42:02.120 --> 42:08.560
Good email. I like the comparison. I like the point that he's trying to make with XP

42:08.560 --> 42:12.040
being, you know, they have tons of flaws and they're always releasing patches for it all

42:12.040 --> 42:16.920
the time, but at the same time, to me, it's a little bit of apples and oranges because

42:16.920 --> 42:21.120
you're talking about operating system, which is like the backbone of the computer, versus

42:21.120 --> 42:26.680
a game. It's a little bit apples and oranges for me. Don't get me wrong, I get the comparison,

42:26.680 --> 42:28.480
but it's a little bit apples and oranges for me.

42:28.480 --> 42:31.800
I'll tell you what system actually that would have been a very accurate comparison to is

42:31.800 --> 42:36.480
the Dreamcast. For any of the games that ran in the Windows CE environment, the game loads

42:36.480 --> 42:39.700
Windows CE onto the system prior to playing the game.

42:39.700 --> 42:45.640
Or even more recent, some of the Xbox 360 games and their save game errors, which, you

42:45.640 --> 42:49.920
know, once you're playing through some of the game, you go back into it and your save

42:49.920 --> 42:53.420
games gone so you know that was something that they had the patch and

42:53.420 --> 43:00.260
fix and hopefully I think is fixed by now. More mail! Yes actually an email from

43:00.260 --> 43:06.740
our dear friend Rob with two B's actually sent me a little bit of a of an article

43:06.740 --> 43:12.540
that was posted on instant replay that about Namco of America they have a new

43:12.540 --> 43:20.580
president. Toyoshi Nishikawa is now the president and CEO of Namco

43:20.580 --> 43:27.620
America Incorporated. Kevin Hayes is now going to be focusing on Namco

43:27.620 --> 43:34.580
Cybertainment which is the arcade. Good! I mean good that arcade stuff is going up

43:34.580 --> 43:38.860
again. You know I was listening to another show. I think it was Bobby? They're

43:38.860 --> 43:44.060
talking about arcade stuff and how there's kind of a need to re-energize

43:44.060 --> 43:48.620
what's going on in the arcade scene and I want to say it was something like Sega

43:48.620 --> 43:52.100
had a big interest in trying to revitalize what was going on in the

43:52.100 --> 43:55.060
arcade market I know some of the things that they were citing was look at a game

43:55.060 --> 43:59.700
like Derby Owners Club that is a huge social following behind it that's really

43:59.700 --> 44:03.460
where the ask that's really where arcades can come back to life is

44:03.460 --> 44:10.140
through the social element, you know, look at DDR, I mean hell, this show was born of

44:10.140 --> 44:15.580
the social element of DDR, it boils down to something as simple as that, you know, that's,

44:15.580 --> 44:19.580
you gotta deliver something in an arcade setting that you can't get being able to sit at home

44:19.580 --> 44:23.540
and play on your big butt on your big couch, you know, being able to play games, you gotta

44:23.540 --> 44:27.960
be able to deliver something different in an arcade, and like, networking arcades together

44:27.960 --> 44:32.500
for like site competitions is another like cool thing, so, I like that people are putting

44:32.500 --> 44:36.340
resources back into making arcades fun because arcades arcades have so much

44:36.340 --> 44:39.180
potential they're pretty much dying over here for a little while they need to

44:39.180 --> 44:41.720
they need to come back to life there's so much potential I think it's actually

44:41.720 --> 44:44.580
pretty good that they brought over somebody from the Japanese side of it

44:44.580 --> 44:48.620
because there are kids there are still you know if they're not surviving fully

44:48.620 --> 44:52.660
they're still you know going on strong there's only I don't think there's been

44:52.660 --> 44:55.740
as many closures there as there were here but a little bit more background on

44:55.740 --> 45:05.660
Nishikawa he's been with Namco since 1987 he's been the EVP CEO since January

45:05.660 --> 45:10.620
so basically he's been with Namco for a while he's got a lot of experience in

45:10.620 --> 45:16.320
the company so I'm being being that I am a big Namco fan I worked for you know

45:16.320 --> 45:21.840
several of their arcades a GS 68 in our chat room has a great comment to maximum

45:21.840 --> 45:29.120
Toon 2 is very social as well, so that's, you know, this could be a good thing for arcades.

45:29.120 --> 45:32.000
So congratulations on your promotions, boys.

45:32.000 --> 45:39.720
Speaking of arcades, I actually saw, I was at Riptide Arcade yesterday, and they have,

45:39.720 --> 45:44.600
that's the Pier 39 one, right, in San Francisco, they have now this machine that you can win

45:44.600 --> 45:48.640
iPods and PSPs and DSs out of.

45:48.640 --> 45:51.120
I saw one at Universal City Walk in one of the random stores there.

45:51.120 --> 45:53.040
Wow, we've all been traveling a lot lately.

45:53.040 --> 46:01.760
Like, we have these random Reno, Canada stories in LA, and now you've got San Francisco.

46:02.040 --> 46:02.500
Yeah.

46:02.500 --> 46:06.440
And this is San Francisco, San Jose, Los Gatos, like, in the span of two days.

46:06.440 --> 46:07.540
It's kind of crazy.

46:07.540 --> 46:07.800
Anyway.

46:07.980 --> 46:09.360
Anyway, back to the emails.

46:09.780 --> 46:13.940
One from Fireboma, one of our long-time listeners.

46:13.940 --> 46:18.580
Dear OLR, recently while watching X-Play, a review on the US release of Beatmania got

46:18.580 --> 46:19.860
my interest.

46:19.860 --> 46:23.300
Besides the usual complaints of the game's learning curve and lack of familiar songs,

46:23.300 --> 46:26.880
the folks over at X-Play decided to go the extra mile and say that the game in general

46:26.880 --> 46:29.240
was simply not good at all.

46:29.240 --> 46:32.360
They then continued to say Guitar Hero was clearly a better game and that Beatmania was

46:32.360 --> 46:34.600
a blatant ripoff of Guitar Hero.

46:34.600 --> 46:37.680
Needless to say, this made me annoyed to a fanboy-ish level.

46:37.680 --> 46:41.920
X-Play, the show that usually laden with knowledge about obscure Japanese RPGs and action games,

46:41.920 --> 46:44.640
forgot to do its homework and is now talking out of its ass.

46:44.640 --> 46:48.600
The main problem is that this lack of knowledge about the Bimani series when it comes to comparing

46:48.600 --> 46:53.360
Guitar Hero to other games is commonplace in many publications about the Guitar Hero

46:53.360 --> 46:56.080
series, calling it groundbreaking and such.

46:56.080 --> 46:59.800
This is like calling In the Groove a unique dancing game the likes of which never have

46:59.800 --> 47:01.440
been seen before.

47:01.440 --> 47:05.900
I'm wondering what your thoughts on this issue and what you think about X-Play's review.

47:05.900 --> 47:08.960
As far as X-Play's review goes, I think you pretty much said it right there.

47:08.960 --> 47:13.120
I mean if they didn't do the research you you can tell it shows and you it makes you mad or whatever

47:13.280 --> 47:16.560
So it you know their review they will

47:17.880 --> 47:23.640
Bear the brunt of the fan base getting mad at them for their review, but unfortunately it's kind of a trend

47:23.640 --> 47:29.080
You're seeing because while here's here. It is for me guitar. Hero is a good game

47:29.320 --> 47:33.060
It's a it's in fact. It's a great game, but people give it too much credit

47:33.060 --> 47:36.980
it didn't do as much as people think it did.

47:36.980 --> 47:40.540
And the problem is, exactly what this is, is that people are giving

47:40.540 --> 47:43.780
Guitar Hero credit for something it didn't do.

47:43.780 --> 47:47.340
And that was like creating the music genre, essentially,

47:47.340 --> 47:51.140
in a way. Creating the music making genre, I should say, because you know,

47:51.140 --> 47:51.780
you could go back,

47:51.780 --> 47:54.820
Beatmania didn't really create the music, and you could go back further and say,

47:54.820 --> 47:56.180
Parappa the Rappa was really,

47:56.180 --> 48:00.140
but as far as the music making genre, Beatmania is really the granddaddy,

48:00.140 --> 48:04.220
and so you know you can't credit Guitar Hero with that. 1998!

48:04.220 --> 48:07.100
But you can credit Guitar Hero with

48:07.100 --> 48:13.000
putting the American spin on it and making it and kinda catering to what I

48:13.000 --> 48:16.420
think American audiences wanted and really finding that. Or even still just

48:16.420 --> 48:17.660
comparing it to like

48:17.660 --> 48:21.340
frequency and amplitude I mean since that was if you wanna you know completely

48:21.340 --> 48:23.620
ignore the Japanese side of everything

48:23.620 --> 48:27.380
those games were out a long time before and they were basically the same

48:27.380 --> 48:28.340
damn thing

48:28.340 --> 48:34.620
Well, yeah, exactly, it's the same company, but I remember seeing this review a while

48:34.620 --> 48:40.180
back and I remember complaining about it as well, because, you know, I had pretty good

48:40.180 --> 48:46.740
respect for, you know, X-Play, because I love how they rip in some of the stupid games out

48:46.740 --> 48:51.500
there and they point out what's really dumb about them, or what's glitchy about it, and

48:51.500 --> 48:55.740
they do it in a funny way sometimes, but then there's sometimes where they're just talking

48:55.740 --> 49:01.980
other ass about things. And I don't know, it's just, you kind of expect a certain level

49:01.980 --> 49:06.980
of, you know, criticism from them and a little bit of research involved and then when you

49:06.980 --> 49:12.140
see them just kind of completely turn around and become like all those other shows out

49:12.140 --> 49:19.140
there, you kind of let down. And I really think if they want to play devil's advocate

49:19.140 --> 49:24.980
here, Guitar Hero wouldn't be as great as it was if guitar freaks had more licensed

49:24.980 --> 49:29.860
music that wasn't all kinda in-house or non-mainstream. I mean, it was a Japanese game and it had

49:29.860 --> 49:34.540
Japanese-style music. And in fact, if I remember correctly, I think that was one of the complaints

49:34.540 --> 49:39.700
of Beatmania was, oh, none of these beat music tracks, they're just all generic techno and

49:39.700 --> 49:45.540
I don't recognize any of these. But yeah, if you follow Beatmania, these are some classic

49:45.540 --> 49:48.380
tracks from like ten years ago in some of the beginning games.

49:48.380 --> 49:51.540
I want to get to some chatroom comments real quick before we get back to the mailbag. And

49:51.540 --> 49:56.580
I want to say 23 Maggots in our chat room says guitar hero did a hell of a lot it made music games more

49:56.880 --> 50:02.140
Accessible, that's kind of the point there. That's a good way of putting it. It made music games more accessible to a wider audience

50:02.140 --> 50:05.020
I like that point and then GS 191 also makes a good point

50:05.020 --> 50:10.300
Hey, don't blame the hosts. None of us are but for the record, but everybody out there should keep in mind this

50:10.300 --> 50:15.700
Hey, don't blame the hosts blame the fucking writers and editors. They are the people that are putting that show down the tubes

50:16.080 --> 50:20.420
So whatever intern at x-play wrote that review a spanking for you, my friend

50:20.420 --> 50:24.780
Okay, granted still don't blame the host, that's fine, but

50:24.780 --> 50:28.060
I would take it that these people, hosts of a gaming show,

50:28.060 --> 50:31.800
should have some common knowledge to a game series that is,

50:31.800 --> 50:35.580
I don't know, over 10 years old now.

50:35.580 --> 50:39.860
To the credit though, the two that they have hosting that show

50:39.860 --> 50:43.060
have more knowledge than a lot of folks on that network, so

50:43.060 --> 50:46.780
I can't complain. They've talked about, you know, DDR in the past, and they've

50:46.780 --> 50:47.820
talked about when

50:47.820 --> 50:52.500
guitar freaks when guitar hero came out so I know they're aware of guitar hero

50:52.500 --> 50:55.700
or guitar freaks so what

50:55.700 --> 50:59.260
it's just a brain fart whatever I've got one last email

50:59.260 --> 51:03.700
and this is from blaze saying hey skyloki and dark sakura

51:03.700 --> 51:08.820
I've always as always the show is going amazingly well and I can't wait for each

51:08.820 --> 51:12.340
week's episode I just wanted to offer an opinion on a couple different things

51:12.340 --> 51:15.860
number one in regards to a question about retailers not having the

51:15.860 --> 51:18.960
quote unpopular like a Phoenix Wright, Katamari Damacy

51:18.960 --> 51:23.340
games I would like to say this. Retailers need to understand that these games exist

51:23.340 --> 51:24.680
because people do play them.

51:24.680 --> 51:28.760
Therefore, stores should come up with a better way of figuring out what to stock

51:28.760 --> 51:32.420
and what not to stock. Even if the store only keeps two or three copies of the

51:32.420 --> 51:34.480
game at a given time, it is better than running out

51:34.480 --> 51:38.160
and not doing anything about it. I called three GameStop CB's in the past week

51:38.160 --> 51:41.760
and none of them had Phoenix Wright, not a big surprise, or Katamari Damacy, a rather odd

51:41.760 --> 51:42.320
surprise.

51:42.320 --> 51:47.600
When I spoke to the people at these stores, they did nothing in order to try and be more helpful other than no

51:47.600 --> 51:54.040
We don't have the game in their defense. It is based on how much they sell they're going to if they sell

51:55.000 --> 51:59.480
40 like I'm just gonna pick random numbers if they sell one copy of

51:59.920 --> 52:03.400
Katamari during pre-orders and they sell 40 of Madden

52:04.080 --> 52:05.880
Their big seller is going to be Madden

52:05.880 --> 52:09.200
it is going to make more sense for them to stock more of this

52:09.200 --> 52:13.480
better to cater to the larger numbers than to the niche market.

52:13.480 --> 52:16.240
But on the other side of this and the part that kind of makes me go huh is that you

52:16.240 --> 52:19.320
know like let's say Tower Records if they didn't have a CD I wanted they

52:19.320 --> 52:21.520
would offer to order it for me so why aren't these

52:21.520 --> 52:24.800
stores that he's calling offering to at least order the game for him?

52:24.800 --> 52:28.480
That would be what I would do. I know that they don't actually have that

52:28.480 --> 52:29.320
capability

52:29.320 --> 52:32.720
so that's why they wouldn't offer it however I think that if you

52:32.720 --> 52:34.920
if you wanna see more retailers do that,

52:34.920 --> 52:36.920
write their customer service line.

52:36.920 --> 52:38.800
Yeah, because I'm just speaking,

52:38.800 --> 52:40.360
and I'm not trying to rip on any store,

52:40.360 --> 52:42.360
because he named a couple stores here.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.040
From a customer service angle,

52:44.040 --> 52:46.120
you don't turn the customers away.

52:46.120 --> 52:47.840
You try to do whatever you can.

52:47.840 --> 52:49.480
I train customer service for a living.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.340
You have to try and keep them somehow,

52:51.340 --> 52:53.360
and that's one way you can do it.

52:53.360 --> 52:54.760
I mean, if that's a corporate restriction,

52:54.760 --> 52:56.200
that's the corporate,

52:56.200 --> 52:57.400
the corporate needs to look into that.

52:57.400 --> 52:59.440
I do know, and I've actually been in this,

52:59.440 --> 53:01.560
and it's not just my husband that does this.

53:01.560 --> 53:05.480
and I'm not just saying it because he's my husband too, but I've actually been in a

53:05.480 --> 53:07.560
couple of GameStops where they will call other stores

53:07.560 --> 53:11.680
and find out if they have it. Well now that's a little better. That's a little better. That's something. That's good.

53:11.680 --> 53:17.880
I went back, kind of on the same subject, I went back to GameStop the other day to

53:17.880 --> 53:21.800
was I was looking to maybe pick up another used Xbox 360 game

53:21.800 --> 53:25.620
but I also checked to see if they had point blank DS

53:25.620 --> 53:28.720
which they haven't had a copy in since it came out and

53:28.720 --> 53:32.580
Neil, that kind of peeves me. I understand that there might not be a huge demand for it.

53:32.580 --> 53:35.700
Bring in one copy. I'm going to kill you to have one copy of the game.

53:35.700 --> 53:38.900
Loki, just go to the internet at this point. Order it online. You bitch about this every week.

53:38.900 --> 53:40.040
You just order it online.

53:40.040 --> 53:44.660
No. I do want to say though, Dark Soccer, since you weren't here last week,

53:44.660 --> 53:47.780
I pre-ordered my first game in many years.

53:47.780 --> 53:51.540
Final Fantasy XII because I want that uber bundle. The game stops kidding.

53:51.540 --> 53:55.460
Well that actually goes to the next topic on here, but one other thing I wanted to touch on is that

53:55.460 --> 53:58.540
I actually do think that it might be a good idea for

53:58.540 --> 54:01.820
people to write in and actually make suggestions to these companies.

54:01.820 --> 54:05.520
They should have ways to, you know, like what McDonald's was trying to do with their whole

54:05.520 --> 54:07.940
big network thing, you know.

54:07.940 --> 54:12.360
I think that they should actually do a network wide inventory and be able to do stores.

54:12.360 --> 54:16.620
You actually can do store to store transfers for items at GameStop.

54:16.620 --> 54:19.900
I think that's more just in case they need stock of stuff.

54:19.900 --> 54:23.460
But I think that they should actually be able to have it where, hey, we can pull this copy

54:23.460 --> 54:26.060
from this store for you and have it for you on this day.

54:26.060 --> 54:27.060
Right.

54:27.060 --> 54:30.820
it's a suggestion. Well hopefully somebody who has the power to

54:30.820 --> 54:31.940
change, it doesn't have to be

54:31.940 --> 54:35.900
GameStop, it can be any of these stores. If anybody's listening that might

54:35.900 --> 54:37.820
have control over corporate, I hope you have...

54:37.820 --> 54:41.540
I would love to hear from you guys that work in the corporate side of these

54:41.540 --> 54:44.180
things. What's your view on these types of policies? If we're

54:44.180 --> 54:47.740
way off base with what we think are good ideas, we'd like to know

54:47.740 --> 54:48.460
why. What are the

54:48.460 --> 54:51.580
reasons why you wouldn't do that? I should see if I could interview my

54:51.580 --> 54:52.300
husband's boss.

54:52.300 --> 54:55.420
That would be fun.

54:55.420 --> 55:00.420
The second item on here, pre-ordering games is something I only do if I'm going to get a bonus out of it.

55:00.420 --> 55:03.420
For example, I pre-ordered Soul Calibur II for the Xbox.

55:03.420 --> 55:10.420
I had pre-ordered it two or three days after the offer had expired, but I received my very awesome lithograph that hangs in the frame in my room,

55:10.420 --> 55:12.420
and a gorgeous book with artwork from the game.

55:12.420 --> 55:16.420
So I say that reserving the game is only worth it if you get a nice bonus.

55:16.420 --> 55:18.420
Um, I do disagree with that.

55:18.420 --> 55:24.420
For some of those more rare, hard to find, you know, games that you know there's going to be a limited run of,

55:24.420 --> 55:31.300
of pre-ordering guarantees you get your copy so I and honestly because I it's

55:31.300 --> 55:34.660
really convenient for me anyway because I can just say hey Dan pick up our

55:34.660 --> 55:39.220
pre-orders but even so you know if you live a block from a GameStop or it's on

55:39.220 --> 55:43.020
your way home from work what's gonna hurt you to stop in drop your five bucks

55:43.020 --> 55:47.780
off and pick it up after work one day I don't want to keep delaying this issue

55:47.780 --> 55:51.340
out but I did think about it so I just want to leave with this no this is this

55:51.340 --> 55:54.340
is I really thought about what is the reason Rob why you don't pre-order games

55:54.340 --> 55:55.340
and I thought about it.

55:55.340 --> 55:58.920
This is why I don't like to pre-order games because I feel like when I put down $5 a game

55:58.920 --> 56:03.560
stop, the day the game comes out, then I see an ad in the paper and, oh, Best Buy is offering

56:03.560 --> 56:06.460
a free copy of such and such, or offering this deal.

56:06.460 --> 56:10.080
So it's like, well, damn, now I've already committed the $5 to buy here and now I can

56:10.080 --> 56:11.800
really get the special deal here.

56:11.800 --> 56:15.380
And honestly, I think that's what stopped me from doing it in the past is when I put

56:15.380 --> 56:19.680
down $5 on a game and then suddenly Best Buy or one of the other companies, I'm just using

56:19.680 --> 56:23.200
them as an example, gave a better deal and I was a little miffed by that.

56:23.200 --> 56:27.360
As a small rebuttal, you can transfer your reserves to other games, and I think you actually

56:27.360 --> 56:28.760
can cancel your reserve.

56:28.760 --> 56:33.240
Well, I guess that's a good thing to know, but I guess maybe the common knowledge out

56:33.240 --> 56:37.400
there is you think, oh, it's on this game, I have to buy it, you know, so anyway, I don't

56:37.400 --> 56:40.160
want to go into this whole issue again, we've had enough talk on it.

56:40.160 --> 56:43.720
The last thing on here is, Blaze actually made a suggestion for Side of the Week, and

56:43.720 --> 56:46.720
since I've already done Side of the Week, I think I'll make a mention of this one.

56:46.720 --> 56:48.920
It's kingdomofloathing.com.

56:48.920 --> 56:53.780
It's an online game that mocks the entire foundation of RPGs as it is known today.

56:53.780 --> 56:58.420
If you think Atari 2600 graphics look bad these days, then this site is a step down

56:58.420 --> 56:59.420
the ladder.

56:59.420 --> 57:00.880
It is done completely in stick figures.

57:00.880 --> 57:02.880
I've actually been to that site.

57:02.880 --> 57:04.160
It's worth your time checking out.

57:04.160 --> 57:07.260
An honorable mention for Site of the Week.

57:07.260 --> 57:08.260
It's cute.

57:08.260 --> 57:09.820
I can't think of any other word to describe it.

57:09.820 --> 57:10.820
It's cute.

57:10.820 --> 57:11.820
Check it out.

57:11.820 --> 57:12.820
Cute is, yeah.

57:12.820 --> 57:13.820
Honestly, I had...

57:13.820 --> 57:16.080
I know we have some OL Army people on there.

57:16.080 --> 57:17.640
Well, you know what?

57:17.640 --> 57:23.480
I'll tell you what, if anyone of you is playing on Kingdom of Loathing, I will make, you know,

57:23.480 --> 57:28.560
because again I'm hosting stuff for our OL army also on roleplay.darksacra.com, I will

57:28.560 --> 57:31.240
make a Kingdom of Loathing discussion forum for you guys.

57:31.240 --> 57:36.880
Ooh, now Roz in our chat room, or Dance Cook, whatever, says that Kingdom of Loathing needs

57:36.880 --> 57:38.200
to go die in a fire.

57:38.200 --> 57:41.840
Apparently something happened, some drama, I don't know.

57:41.840 --> 57:43.160
Is there drama on Kingdom of Loathing?

57:43.160 --> 57:44.160
I wouldn't know, anyway.

57:44.160 --> 57:47.520
What game does not have drama, please?

57:47.520 --> 57:54.900
man brain age bro all right anyways that's the last email that's the last

57:54.900 --> 57:58.060

toll-free call our voicemail question of the week our games too easy one last

58:07.260 --> 58:10.500
thing I do want to mention is that for the kind of person who sent me an email

58:10.500 --> 58:15.780
directly with the compliments and support um thank you very much you will

58:15.780 --> 58:19.300
be getting your reply, I just did not have an opportunity to do it when I first read

58:19.300 --> 58:20.300
your email.

58:20.300 --> 58:26.780
And to the people who did not email me this week directly with admiration and support,

58:26.780 --> 58:28.960
you may feel free to email me this week.

58:28.960 --> 58:29.960
Thank you.

58:29.960 --> 58:30.960
Hey, I text messaged you.

58:30.960 --> 58:31.960
Text messaged you.

58:31.960 --> 58:34.100
I don't want the listeners text messaging me.

58:34.100 --> 58:35.420
I get charged for that.

58:35.420 --> 58:36.660
No, send me an email.

58:36.660 --> 58:37.660
That's free.

58:37.660 --> 58:38.660
I'll text you five times.

58:38.660 --> 58:39.660
Back to the...

58:39.660 --> 58:43.720
And also the kind of, also one more thing to add on there, thank you for anybody that

58:43.720 --> 58:47.300
nominated us for the podcast awards as well.

58:47.300 --> 58:50.820
Let's hope it's five indies that got nominated. Let's hope that it is indie

58:50.820 --> 58:53.220
podcasts they got in there, but we'll know in

58:53.220 --> 58:56.900
about a week or so what's going on there. I would bet anything

58:56.900 --> 59:01.460
Gamertag Radio gets nominated because I've gotten like five emails from those

59:01.460 --> 59:02.220
guys.

59:02.220 --> 59:07.380
Whether it be on Xbox, and no disrespect, they've got a fine show, they are really

59:07.380 --> 59:10.540
passionate about what they do.

59:10.540 --> 59:12.380
Really, I mean they are

59:12.380 --> 59:16.980
They love what they do and it's it's obvious, but it's just funny because I got it on Xbox live

59:16.980 --> 59:23.220
We got it in our own mailbag. I mean, it's just everywhere, but I I don't they're they're absolutely deserving

59:23.220 --> 59:26.160
I think would be cool if they got it and that there's lots of deserving shows out there

59:26.160 --> 59:27.720
I can't wait to see what what happens

59:27.720 --> 59:33.420
I wish I wish everybody on all games and some of the other cool ones can get all get nominated

59:33.420 --> 59:38.340
But we'll see what happens. Yeah, okay. Anyways, I'm speaking of you know, all that fun stuff

59:38.340 --> 59:43.900
There's a little bit of drama going on and this drama is kind of taking place in Las

59:43.900 --> 59:49.340
Vegas with Mayor Oscar Goodman and apparently he doesn't like the brand new Rainbow Six

59:49.340 --> 59:54.780
Vegas game that's coming out that depicts terrorists taking over a hotel in Vegas.

59:54.780 --> 01:00:00.220
Anyways, Goodman has an issue with the game's plot which sees the terrorists taking over

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:06.580
a swanky casino on the city strip and seizing a number of hostages.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:12.780
Goodman reported saying the game was based on a false premise, adding he has been repeatedly

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:17.180
told by the government officials that Las Vegas is the safest place imaginable when

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.580
it comes to terrorist attacks.

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:23.780
The mayor also said he'll look into whether or not the city can prevent the game from

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.780
being released.

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:32.260
It could be harmful economically and it may be something that's not entitled to free speech

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.540
protection.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:41.000
So that's kind of interesting, kind of along the same lines of Mercenaries 2 and the people

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.580
in Venezuela getting pissed off about that game, so it should be interesting.

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:50.460
But I mean, come on, the game in the end, they save the people, so I mean, it's not

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:55.220
like, you know, oh, the people get all killed and yeah, Vegas sucks.

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.860
WonderDogHerald has an excellent point here in the chat room.

01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.700
You'd think he'd object to all the murders that take place in Las Vegas on CSI.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:02.700
Exactly!

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:07.700
That's true. CSI does not make Las Vegas look like a pretty place.

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.700
I don't really watch the show a whole lot. I've caught it a couple times because

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.700
I shouldn't have to feel ashamed to admit this, but I like Survivor.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:19.700
And CSI comes on after Survivor, and you know, sometimes I catch the first little pieces.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.700
It doesn't paint Vegas to be a pretty town at all.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:26.700
So you think the mayor would... maybe he has, I don't know.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.700
I mean, after all, their catchphrase for Vegas is, you know,

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:34.780
You know, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, I mean, whatever.

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:38.320
Alright, anyway, moving on, I want to point this out.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.700
This is very random, but when was the last time we had Atari 2600 news on this show?

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.060
Hey, we love all consoles.

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.060
We mean it.

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:54.180
Well, get this, Simon Kornhorst is developing for the Atari 2600, yes, folks are still developing

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.460
for the Atari 2600.

01:01:55.460 --> 01:02:00.580
called a VCS tech challenge is the name of the game that's a little bit of a

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:05.700
play on the word as tech challenge there was a game on the Commodore 64 there's a

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:09.020
quote from Simon Cornhorse that says as follows I somehow remember the game as

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:12.660
tech challenge from 1983 on the Commodore 64 and I always liked the

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:16.980
first level called the gauntlet and the game music I thought that a similar game

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.940
for the VCS would be cool he says on his website for the game's release there

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.180
will be handmade copies complete with a manual cartridge and packaging but only

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.780
for the first 55 owners.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:33.740
Most of those have already been secured by nostalgia gamers, however, Mr. Cornhorse is

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:38.800
willing to produce as many copies as is needed with just manuals and cartridges for those

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.660
folks that may want to pick this up a VCS tech challenge.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:49.060
Now they keep making these flashback consoles, I think it would be cool to see games like

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.700
this be put in the flashback consoles and I think they did this.

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:56.540
I remember a story way, way back there. Atari Flashback 2 came out, they had like a contest,

01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:00.500
like a 24 hour development, and they put the winning game in the Flashback 2. They should

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:08.060
reach out to this guy and put this AVCS tech challenge in Flashback 3 if they do it. You've

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:13.340
got to really love the 2600 to still be developing for it. You know what it looks like though?

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:18.740
The game itself kind of looks like Enduro to me, and how the hell I remember a game

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:24.880
like Enduro, I'll never know. But instead of driving, it looks like a little guy running.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.880
So that's kind of cool.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:36.120
Interesting. Anyways, brand new news here talking about TV now. DirecTV and IGN have

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.880
teamed up with Microsoft and a bunch of other companies to put together a brand new pro

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:46.520
gaming series called the Championship Gaming Series. It's basically a new professional

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.840
gaming league that will air competitions exclusively to DirecTV.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.640
And apparently next weekend DirecTV and the company will take over a 16,000 square foot

01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.820
airplane hangar at former Treasure Island Naval Base in San Francisco and turn it into

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.640
an indoor video game arena.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:09.860
And it says it will use 16 HD cameras to film the two day invitational event.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.680
And no word how the competitors for the event were chosen, but they'll be playing a variety

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:22.680
including Battlefield 2, Project Gotham Racing 3, Halo 2, DOA 4, and Counter-Strike 1.6.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:29.680
And it should be interesting, it says the weekend's event will be aired in August.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.680
Isn't DirecTV the home of Gameplay HD as well?

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.680
I think so.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.680
And it looks like there's a lot of love for games over at DirecTV.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.680
That's kind of promising, because from what I've heard of Gameplay HD,

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.680
it sounds like it's going to be a very good thing for gamers.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:45.800
for gamers I hope it gets out there just beyond one satellite carrier I hope it

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.240
gets really out there in the mainstream because we need a real gaming channel

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.760
yeah because the one that used we used to have we just don't count anymore

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.920
period we don't count it anyway we're gonna go to a new section of our show

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:01.160
the sky actually this is not a new section it's the section we do every

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:05.040

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.920
Obviously, you know who's on the other line. Well, you still need to introduce yourself for those folks in the sock

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.920
All right, what's on your mind? Let's do Zaku

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:37.780
Basically picking off of where you actually said about the whole x-play fiasco and you know Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.180
Just not doing their job. Well now wait a minute

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:45.220
Didn't we say don't blame the host because I know but I know but still as I said, you know

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:49.700
There's a lot of blame to go around not only them too, but you know the people behind them

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:53.980
They're making them, you know, that are you know, the people they're actually feeding them this stuff

01:05:53.980 --> 01:06:01.740
I and I believe I firmly believe that there's a bias against them. There's a bias against against you know

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:06.700
well basically any type of any type of game that doesn't fit their their

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:11.420
criteria like you know in this case they they're just they're just kissing the

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:16.260
ass of guitar hero basically that's all I see now from not only xplay but from

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:20.980
game spot and other people that you know that bastardize beatmania what is the

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:26.340
criteria I mean they from what I've been seeing they they usually come down hard

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:31.280
on good games that turn out to be really you know they really they really you

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.240
know it really speaks it talked down on

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.840
and you know on good games and really

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.840
good games I mean I know was there

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.620
another game that they did a review of

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:45.840
that made you upset um I'm trying to

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.440
remember right now it also it's been a

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.080
while since I watch X play but usually

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.080
okay I know okay but so okay that's

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:53.880
alright you can't think of an example

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.640
but to play devil's advocate for a bit

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.860
you're never gonna agree with game

01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.600
reviews 100% of the time they're kind of

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:04.000
meant to ruffle your feathers a little bit yeah and that's that's the truth and I

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.260
understand that but I mean the only thing what I don't get is how you know

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:15.120
they're saying it's you know taking one thing like guitar hero and making it so

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.120
you know make it hold more weight and something that has like beatmania which

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:24.240
which has been around there for long for like almost ten times as long as guitar

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.040
hero it doesn't make sense somebody didn't do their homework I mean it's

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:33.760
Well, that too, and I mean, and the fact that from what I heard in the BeatMania review

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.040
in X-Play, they only played the 5-key side.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:43.660
They never explored the 2DX side, and that, you know, so you see how half-assed the whole

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:44.660
review was.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.660
Exactly.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:49.380
Honestly, I think they just gave it to some intern who did the review in a day, if even

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.380
that.

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:53.380
I mean, that's what happened, but, you know, two things happened.

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:57.640
It's good news for X-Play because now we've spent how much time during this program essentially

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:04.100
giving them free advertising, and two, it's also going to make themselves look bad in

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:07.620
that community for not having done that, but that's just part of life.

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.620
You know what?

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:13.060
We get criticized because we make mistakes sometimes, but you just have to realize shit

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:14.060
happens.

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.620
We make lots of mistakes.

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:16.620
So what?

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:19.020
We don't claim to be all knowing.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:23.560
It pisses me off when I read things on the internet that bash on us for this type of

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:28.260
stuff and it�s like we don�t get paid for this.

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:32.240
If I was getting paid to do eight hours of research a day on video games, everything

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.900
that comes out of my mouth, Loki�s mouth, Dark Sakura�s mouth is love of games and

01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.460
hobbyists as hobbyists and things we do.

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:44.300
At least you guys go through playing the games before saying something about them, whereas

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:48.260
Adam and Morgan just read off the teleprompter.

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:53.580
Well, to be honest, though, it would take forever for one person to play all the games.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:57.260
Trying to play everything that comes out, I remember when we first started doing the

01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:03.540
podcast full-time and everything, I was just trying to play everything, and you can't.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:04.540
You really can't.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:08.420
And to Adam and Morgan's credit, at least as hosts, they've been doing other programs

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:09.420
with that.

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:12.220
They've kind of earned their way into those spots.

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:18.680
was doing shows on ZDTV, like the GameSpot TV, where I think the hosts were responsible

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.020
for a lot more of the work.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:23.400
So I don't, you can't discredit this game, and Morgan was part of Screensavers a long

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.940
time ago.

01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:29.640
I would really take them, you know, I would take them a lot more seriously if they actually,

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:34.780
you know, did more work as in actually giving an honest opinion rather than just reading

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:35.780
it off.

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:38.220
You know, that can't really happen.

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.380
That might be the producer or the network's problem, though.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.480
But Zaku, we gotta let you go, we're running a lot, we gotta get another call, but thank

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:50.180
you so much for the perspective and making us talk about it a little bit.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.180
Let's go to another call.

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.660
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:55.140
This is 23rd Magus.

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:59.260
Hi 23rd Magus, back away from your speakers a little bit and tell us what's on your mind.

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:03.220
Okay, I just thought I'd pitch in with a little WoW update.

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.220
Okay what's up?

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:06.980
I'm the resident WoW addict anyway.

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.940
Okay what's up on WoW?

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:15.940
Okay, IGN has released a new story unveiling the new additions to World PvP in the 1.12 patch.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:18.940
It should be coming out, I'd say, probably within a month.

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:23.440
The Eastern Plague Lands will feature resource points that must be captured,

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:28.940
and Silithist will have piles of magical dust called Silithist that must be collected.

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:31.940
Alliance and Horde players will fight over these resources,

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.940
which, when turned in, will provide a zone-wide buff to your faction.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:42.780
The 1.12 patch with the world PVP objectives, the cross several battlegrounds, and the road

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:46.020
talent review should be live on the test rooms by Monday.

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:50.060
I did notice on worldofwarcraft.com they posted the list of which...

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:54.700
Magus, I have to let you go because we're getting really bad feedback, but let me respond

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.980
to that just a little bit, what he was saying.

01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:59.260
Thank you for the World of Warcraft update, that was cool.

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:03.900
But I did want to say really quickly that on worldofwarcraft.com I did notice that they

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:09.000
the list of which realms are in which group for the cross battle realms and of

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.120
course I'd look to where airy peak is at which where we've been playing and it

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.740
looks like I'll be able to play my old friends on doom hammer because we're in

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:18.140
the same group so that's kind of cool so we'll see what happens with that let's

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:21.860
go to the phones one more time hello you're on orange lounge radio who's this

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:27.820
it's Ron all right what's on your mind Rama I want to talk about point that you

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:32.140
a customer service and gaming stores I can I understand exactly where you're

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:33.140
coming from with that.

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:34.140
Okay.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:35.140
How so?

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:41.140
I work at Staples and if the item is not in stock, we have to go in the systems and track

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.140
it down.

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:46.400
If we can't get from one machine, we have to go to the AS400 and check all the stores

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.540
in the area.

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.880
We have to bend over backwards for the customers, make sure they get what they want.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.900
And I have no problem doing that because when I do it for a customer, I expect the same

01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:58.160
thing done for me.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.680
To be honest, that's a good company policy, but to be fair to whatever companies we were

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.800
talking about earlier in the show, we don't have a representative to really give us the

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.100
exact policy.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:16.240
So we can only talk about what your company is doing, which it sounds like a good thing.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:21.240
But the thing is, let's say that it's company policy with all these companies.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:25.000
When it comes down to the individual stores, it seems that management of that store or

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.740
employees just don't how I say don't give a shit because I had to deal with

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:32.620
the same thing that Sunday I went looking for a couple games at Circuit

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:37.220
City they expected me to go calling all the stores for the games I said to the

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:41.740
two people standing there that um excuse me this is your job you're supposed to

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:45.820
go looking at the computers for the games as I want I'm here being very nice

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.460
about it there's no need for you to be rude to me and don't you know the

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:53.680
following day I called corporate and I gave them my two cents about it yeah I'm

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.760
I was told by a game store once when I called in asking if they had a certain game in stock

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:02.400
And it wasn't anything major. I wasn't talking like you know an Xbox 360 or Halo 2 or something

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.000
I called in asking if a game was in stock

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.560
And I was told I'm busy right now come down and look and see if we have it on the shelves and needless to say

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.000
I bought the game at their competitor across town

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.220
Because it was a lot nicer when I called they checked you know

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:22.760
It's just that's the reality of what happens bad customer service is lost business, but yeah, right again again

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:27.620
we can't we can't go quoting who's who's what company policy we can't let one

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:32.240
worker be ruin the reputation of entire company either so I'm just gonna say for

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:36.160
anybody I know we probably have a lot of people that listen that work at these

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:40.960
type of places and it could be anything from the GameStop EB stores to Best Buy

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:47.200
Office Depot staples to mom-pop stores whatever keep in mind that it might be

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:54.320
inconvenience sometimes but bad customer service leads to lost business leads to

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.120
your store getting closed and you getting laid off and that's one of the

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:01.200
reasons why one of the guys at my job got fired on Tuesday yeah it's too bad

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.320
all right well we got to let you go to get more calls in but thank you so much

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.800

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:31.520
get off their chest here in studio oh is that a big no oh yes dark soccer had a mic to her

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:37.380
mouth first i just i was gonna say oh okay then loki oh nope cut off by the skype call

01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:44.280
here we go hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hi this is speaker kerry i am sorry

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:56.840
I just got back on vacation from the Philippines, and the thing is I spent a lot of time in

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:02.600
the arcades over there, and one thing I noticed, the social environment over there is much

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:05.840
more lively than it is over here.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:12.200
Well, like, okay, it's not just the hardcore gamers that are always there, that are there

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.200
all the time.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:18.960
there'd be like families and you know usually people that you wouldn't consider gamers that

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:25.360
are hanging around like playing the games or just having fun. Why do you think families are more

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:29.840
apt to play games together in the Philippines than they are here? Well you know what honestly

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:33.520
I think it's because of the social economic conditions because most of these families

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:40.080
can't really afford say like a console a home console but also at the same time these these

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.000
Arcades are making a lot more money than the arcades that we have over here, yet their

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.600
games are like dirt cheap.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:53.440
Like for example, I was playing Cup Cup Zero for like 25 cents a game.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.360
Well very interesting perspective, I gotta let you go buddy because you're a little quiet

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.120
but thanks so much for calling in to us tonight.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.160
Have a good one.

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:04.240
You know this reminds me of back when my parents used to take me down to Chuck E. Cheese back

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:08.800
before it was all neon lights and ball bins and it was actually just pizza and arcade

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:14.980
Um, and that's you know, they would totally take me down there and we'd play games and stuff together as a family

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:18.400
You know everybody would you know go and play different video games and not my mom

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.500
She'd hand me a roll of quarters and go sit in the corner. She'll have fun kid

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.700
My mom hates our my mom hates video games

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:32.780
but she she always kind of like every time something interesting happens with our show like, you know last year when we won the

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.440
Podcast award or we were on you know

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.800
You guys are on the news and I think we were all on it at one point two or in the paper

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.920
Remember that those little things that happen my mom always kind of goes, huh?

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:47.760
Like kind of one of those. Wow. I always told him that would never amount to anything boy was I wrong

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.200
But that makes me feel good

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:53.700
In a pen. I still don't think it's amounted to much yet until we get actually a paycheck. I guess that's true

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:59.680
What you know what though I in the audience we have is so awesome that I feel rewarded

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:03.840
Anyway, one more call on Skype then we'll wrap it up higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:09.440
Hi, what's on your mind? You're a little quiet so I'm just going to let you get your thoughts

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.440
out and we'll respond.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:15.120
Alright, I just wanted to really talk about the arcades because I just came back from

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.720
Japan two weeks ago and I wanted to talk about the arcades over there compared to the arcades

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.320
here.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.400
What was the comparison you made?

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.640
I'm sorry, repeat that?

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.000
What was the comparison you made?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.520
I just wanted to talk about the arcades in Japan and America because the arcades in Japan

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:37.240
are a whole lot busier, and there's a lot more focus on different styles of gaming.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.800
And the UFO catchers, like the crane games, are a lot bigger over there too.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:46.400
It's just crazy how much more stuff they have there compared to what we have here.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.960
Why do you think it's different?

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:54.000
I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the population density in Japan is so

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.920
much bigger, and I think that that kind of makes it more possible for lots of people

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.060
to go to one place.

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.380
Well very interesting perspective.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.380
We appreciate the phone call.

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:07.380
Have a good one.

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.380
Okay?

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:09.380
All right.

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.380
Thank you.

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:11.380
Later.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:12.380
Bye bye.

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:13.380
I think that was actually a very good point.

01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:16.380
Just with, you know, it's actually pretty commonplace for someone to get off work and

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:21.020
then go to a game center or for, you know, children after school to go to the game center

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:24.820
or spend their Sundays there since school's on Saturday too, but I mean I think that that's

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:29.860
actually because it's so integrated into everything and it has been for so long I think that

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:34.100
that is a good reason why it's you know surviving there's a new game center going up

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:39.940
by us by a local theater that we have up um in aldrod hills there's a new gaming center going on

01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:44.340
down there which i'm not sure it almost looks like it could be a console gaming center which i'm kind

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:49.220
of interested to check out they don't have it built yet but we'll see going in all right any

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.940
of the last minute stories um i was just gonna mention like one thing real quick um there was

01:18:53.940 --> 01:19:00.000
There's a report about the Xbox 360 branded ecstasy popping up in the UK, I thought that

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
was kind of funny.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Right.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.240
There's a new type of ecstasy that they're calling Xbox 360 pills.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.240
So jump in.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.240
Exactly.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:16.480
Well, I guess that's about going to wrap it up then for this week's edition of Orange

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.480

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.960
training missions and needing a lot more parts to actually make a mech so I can go play online.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:41.360
I've been really trying to play more online games. My final thought is big thanks to Miklotov

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.480
for being a special guest on the show tonight, even though we might get some angry emails

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:49.480
from what he said in the first half, but that's alright. Freedom of speech, right? And I want

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:55.300
to say I have to I have to catch him up in level on Wow because he's an addict

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:59.180

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:03.700

is always reject false icons second is define yourself don't let the world

you leave you leave good moral messages for the youth of America that stuff

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:33.400
