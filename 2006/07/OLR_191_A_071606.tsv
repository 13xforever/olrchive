14369	25116	Tonight, July 16th, 2006, Target pulls UMDs from shelves, new rumors are floating around about the Wii controller, and is Konami planning to directly compete with Guitar Hero?
28198	36443	Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36523	38224	This is episode number 191 for this
39861	40241	DarkSakura.com
68075	69537	She's just running late tonight.
69618	81757	She was in the Bay Area this weekend doing something and she's running a little late, but she says she will be here in time for Part B and she might even make it to the show depending on how long we run during Part A. I told her whenever she gets here, just barge on in.
82182	82722	and say hello.
82802	84723	So we'll be looking forward to hearing from her very soon.
84743	86583	I'm sure you didn't have to tell her to do that.
87364	88344	She'll just kick the door down.
88624	89064	I'm here!
89784	90785	Anyway, we'll see.
90825	93065	The traffic was horrible!
93085	94686	Yeah, what do you want to bet when she gets here?
94726	96306	There's going to be some type of rant about the traffic.
96326	97767	In fact, I already know there was an accident.
97807	98207	She told me...
98607	103949	She told me part of the reason she wasn't here is that there's an accident on one of the highways that kept her kind of late.
104049	105169	She'll be bright and cheery.
105189	105749	All right.
105809	105989	Good.
106029	110331	We'll try to time the FUs of the week in time for her arrival, but I don't know.
110371	112211	We got a plan we got to stick to.
112271	116593	Anyway, we do have the one and only Miklatov filling in again.
116733	117433	You never leave.
118013	118894	I try not to.
118994	119254	All right.
119634	122095	But Miklatov has something very important he's going to say tonight.
123755	124095	Somewhat.
124115	125096	It's probably about women.
125396	125636	All right.
126116	126376	Anyway.
128154	129295	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
155233	184721	Played a little bit of Chromehounds Basically you have to go through all the training missions As you would call them And they have it split up into six different sections For each type of class you want to do And you unlock parts that way Because basically if you want to build a mech You have to play through the whole single player game In order to get some good parts And so I've been playing that And playing a lot of Ridge Racer I'm kind of done with that game
185427	186247	Thanks for watching!
204059	210286	RidgeRacer 6 is no different, and that's another reason why I will not be buying RidgeRacer 2 when that comes out for the PSP.
210386	212669	It's just going to be the same damn shit all over again.
212689	216773	That's so weird to me that you already have RidgeRacer 6, yet they're going to go back and do RidgeRacer 2.
216954	218335	I know it's different.
218375	219797	It's RidgeRacer PSP 2.
219917	222460	I know it's different, but it's still just kind of weird when you talk about it.
223092	223612	R4 was awesome, but
239096	241337	You know, I didn't have to like, I'm like, oh yeah, I remember this track.
241537	242917	So you know how to race it already.
242937	244858	And the drifting is just completely wrong anyways.
244898	248159	And I played... I'm done with the game.
248319	250980	I just need to sell it before it drops price again.
251640	253460	And just, you know, get rid of it.
254221	255861	So I can, you know, buy more games in August.
257682	260443	The other game I played was Zygopane.
261783	262463	XOR.
263704	263824	And...
265339	273403	And basically, this is a Japanese-only Xbox 360 game, but doing a nifty little region trick, you can download a demo that's on the live marketplace right now.
275224	276144	It's an interesting game.
276425	280026	Reminds me a bit of Zone of Vendors, just the way the combat system is.
280387	285889	It is kind of neat, though, because you use the right analog to kind of switch targets to which one you want to fire against.
286370	293253	And then basically, you have your normal shot and charged shots, and then this kind of like special attack, which is just more charged shots.
294591	295071	It's neat.
295552	297673	I wouldn't buy it, but it's kind of neat.
298433	301035	I played a little bit of Frogger, and what can I say?
301075	301795	Frogger's Frogger.
303877	307819	And, yeah, I think that was... I'm still playing through Blazing Angels.
308339	311481	You know, the game's now to the point where I just want it to be over.
312301	317525	I love how every week you come... Like, for the past four or five weeks when I've come on the show, I've been playing Blazing Angels this week.
317585	318065	I hate it!
319405	321106	It's been like the past five weeks.
321146	322606	You haven't stopped playing it.
323086	324807	If you hate a game, throw it away.
324827	326427	The last achievement, man.
326907	327707	Last achievement.
327847	329168	True points horror.
329188	330008	Well, I have to.
330888	337230	The fact that they make these different modes, like arcade mode and the mini campaign mode, they're all the same.
337710	338490	All the same.
338951	344432	The only difference between the arcade mode and, say, the mini campaign mode, you fight 20 planes.
345412	345792	That's it.
346573	347673	In the arcade mode, you fight
348390	348910	Thanks for watching!
369688	372691	Loki, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
394798	396083	So, you know, that's true.
396143	400477	I do remember your past few FUs of the week have been about traffic, so I think you just got pwned.
402366	402686	Let's see.
402866	403507	Oh, here we go.
403587	406448	You will bow to me once you know exactly how many achievement points do you have.
406468	407088	I don't have a lot.
407188	409649	We always call you an achievement points whore, but you really don't have that many.
409949	410309	I don't.
410729	411870	Compared to some people.
411970	413531	I just don't have enough time to play stuff.
414071	414691	Don't you break like 3,000?
414811	415311	Yeah.
416712	417172	That's a lot.
417212	420793	I only have like 1,200 or something.
420973	429357	What I try to do is I sit down with a game that I want to get rid of, like Ridge Racer or Blazing Angels.
430433	435016	and I just play it and play it and play it and play it until I finally get all the achievement points and then I go and sell it.
435936	444000	And my game after Ridge Racer and Blazing Angels, the next one's going to be Rumble Roses XX because that game was lame.
444280	448563	Luckily though, Blazing Angels and Rumble Roses, I did not pay for.
448603	452325	I got those free from Konami and Ubisoft.
452745	455346	Yeah, they were really thankful to give those away.
456994	458534	Ridge Racer did spend money on.
458855	460775	And to be honest, Ridge Racer's fun.
461435	463556	It's fun, but... It was okay.
463576	466236	I think there's better racers on 360 right now, but I had fun with it.
466717	467417	It's a fun game.
467437	471078	As a more traditional racer that's not like blow shit up, it's pretty good.
471158	472998	I would like to see the next Burnout.
473138	475679	You know, something that's made from scratch and not a port.
476419	477219	I think that would be better.
477739	481761	Or maybe, I don't know, it's a good arcade racing game is what we need out there.
482581	483501	Anything else you've been playing this week?
484641	485201	I think that's it.
485721	486642	Grand Theft Auto, of course.
505393	506514	on Xbox Live Arcade.
506534	510196	I mean, hell, it was five bucks, and I wanted something new, so I was kind of a sucker.
510236	510616	I got it.
511237	513858	And it was actually a lot better than I expected.
514118	522183	I was expecting it to just be a straight arcade port with not a lot of extra frills, but I think it's kind of cool that they have some extra stuff.
522203	524685	They did enhance the graphics for whatever it's worth.
524745	526366	I mean, it's nothing to scream about.
526726	532650	It looks like they enhanced it from the Atari 2600-style graphics that it used to be
533154	534815	Well, actually, I'll give them more credit.
534855	536256	More like NES-style graphics.
536296	539698	They souped it up to, like, Super NES-style graphics.
539758	541899	So, it's still not that great.
542319	543540	But, you know, it's alright.
545241	549703	But the game, you know, it's amazingly simple and will entertain you for a little bit.
549784	552985	I do like the fact they have co-op modes in there and some other multiplayer modes.
553386	557968	Except, I only played one co-op game, but it was laggy as hell.
558108	559209	I mean, it was to the point where
559565	560105	Thank you for watching!
577489	578189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
600888	601429	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
617685	617945	Prey Doom 3
638621	639061	No, I'm kidding.
639121	640943	It's definitely on there.
640963	643485	Or like, I liked it better when it was called Duke Nukem 3.
644245	647408	It's very obvious, so there's a lot in common with the Doom 3 interface.
647448	649649	And to be honest, I haven't done my research on the game.
649689	651010	I'm not sure if they use the Doom 3 interface.
651050	651671	It is the Doom 3 interface.
651691	653853	Okay, that's not a surprise at all, honestly.
654253	654613	I can tell.
654633	657736	Because you, instead of having a flashlight, you have a lighter.
657936	662859	Yeah, but you do have the gravity stuff, which is kind of cool.
662879	663320	Like, you go...
663760	666242	You can walk up these ramps and go upside down and stuff.
666542	671085	But the problem is that I have a hard enough time conceptualizing 3D space.
672006	682714	I don't know if it's just me having been an old school gamer since Atari 2600 days that when everything started moving into 3D, I had a hard time sometimes conceptualizing 3D space, like levels and things.
683074	690900	And so to be able to run upside down and up walls and stuff is even more confusing to me in trying to figure out how the levels laid out.
690980	691120	But
691620	692261	I mean, it's okay.
692281	693141	The game controls pretty good.
693201	693962	I didn't play multiplayer.
693982	694842	I only played single player.
695262	704788	I did think, to the game's credit, I thought the setup was really good and the drama in the opening parts of the game were done very well and very seamlessly.
704828	705908	And I thought it was kind of cool.
705968	708830	Like, you could really put yourself right in the action.
709130	709610	Doom 3 Prey Improved
730546	731306	In this game, really.
731567	733407	It's just, it's all done within the engine.
733448	734388	I think that's very cool.
734888	739911	So, you know, you can definitely tell how far technology's come when you don't have much of a need for cutscenes anymore.
740351	748915	I remember playing the Prey demo, and all I did was I walked up to the little machine, one of the arcade machines in there, and it was like a Pac-Man demo, and I played that.
750456	753137	Going over to the chat room, looking at some questions there...
754864	761612	Ubuntu Maniac 64 says, Sky would die playing F-Zero, X, and GX then because of all the ramps and upside down.
761972	765616	No, actually, I really, really, really enjoyed F-Zero on the GameCube.
765917	768860	I was a little annoyed with the arcade version because it only had six tracks.
769201	773566	But otherwise, I thought the game was magnificent, and I really wish they'd done more with the arcade.
773606	775608	I think the arcade had four tracks.
775788	779772	You don't have these, like, uh, this, uh, you know, teleportation bullshit, you know, or, um, you know, the...
799284	804409	I'm not totally incompetent when it comes to visualizing 3D.
804449	805270	Give me a little credit.
805610	807792	But I'm telling you, Prey really pushes the envelope.
807812	809134	Yeah, because you go through portals.
809634	813258	Suddenly this box will now be a portal into another place in the level.
813298	815280	And I had no map.
816201	819704	You probably can bring it up easily, but I didn't even figure out how to bring up a map in the demo.
820214	821235	Descent Metroid Prime
844681	852187	For some reason, the little levels, the head-to-head levels are cool, but those big, massive Metroid levels, especially in the first game, it's just too much.
853228	853548	I don't know.
854069	856150	And just the fact that it wasn't Metroid to me.
856350	860213	I mean, I remember Super Metroid, and it's one of the best video games ever made.
860574	865638	Someone was mentioning in the chat room that the Saints Row demo is out on the Xbox magazine.
866418	866698	Oh, really?
866718	867839	I haven't gotten my new issue yet.
868200	870041	I don't remember if I've run out of issues or not.
870081	871402	I can't remember when I subscribed to that.
871786	873267	Call of Duty 2, Quake 4, and Condemned
891308	898933	Well, anyway, as far as Prey goes, I'm going to withhold making a real judgment call on the game until I can play the full version and get a little hands-on multiplayer.
899213	899854	But you know what can I say?
899894	905057	I love the fact that you can download demos for free and judge for yourself if you like the game or not.
905437	907498	So what do you need me to review this game for you?
907538	909520	Go download the demo and see for yourself.
909560	912262	If you like shooters, if you like Doom 3, I think you'll like Prey.
912302	913662	Here's my major bitch on this game.
914603	915724	No split-screen multiplayer.
916224	928657	Now, I understand that's not a big deal for some people that do the LAN parties and stuff like that, but when I'm playing at work or playing at home, you know, and I have some friends over and we want to bust out this game, you know, we can't do that.
928777	931620	You cannot play, you know, split-screen multiplayer on there.
932100	937246	So, that kind of sucks, but, you know, they do have, like I said, the, um...
937742	939083	Jada2006 Pray is a LAN party game.
939103	941384	It's not meant for split-screen multiplayer.
957523	957763	Tough!
957923	959485	I want split-screen multiplayer!
960165	980381	Alright, I will make the decision, I'm glad that they have that mode in there, but I will make the decision whether I want to use it or not, and if I really want to keep, you know, a really tiny-ass little section of the screen for my view, that's fine, you know, but I don't have, you know, four Xbox 360s and four high-def TVs that I can, you know, share with my friends.
980521	982822	Alright, let's keep it moving because we want to get to the news here.
982862	984864	Miklatov, how was your gaming week?
985685	987426	I played World of Warcraft
987899	989340	That was just this weekend.
989720	990520	That's about it.
990680	994922	Yeah, but when you say you played World of Warcraft this weekend, you played all weekend, right?
995002	1001844	Yeah, it was Warsong Honor this week, or Double Warsong Honor, so I had to keep playing and playing and playing.
1002064	1005966	Now, what do you get for racking up a bunch of points in the PvP Warsong Gold?
1006046	1006566	I don't know.
1008246	1009467	So why do you keep playing?
1009507	1010867	I just know I have to do it.
1011007	1012408	Is it like an internet penis thing?
1012428	1015509	Like you want to have the big title in front of your name so that you're special, or what?
1016699	1022561	No, but I like seeing the bar fill up for each little thing I become honored or friendly with.
1022781	1023642	Okay, serious question, though.
1023662	1026362	How many hours would you say this weekend alone did you play Warsong Gulch?
1027063	1028603	Holy crap.
1029884	1030444	Total, 12.
1031764	1033065	Wow.
1034085	1037246	It was really fun, though, because I kept owning people.
1037366	1041588	Sadly enough, I think I know probably people that are more addicted to World of Warcraft than that.
1041628	1042828	Yes, I'm not addicted.
1043548	1044829	I just like to have my little bursts.
1045393	1057801	I was in Reno randomly yesterday, as I mentioned before, and we were at a restaurant at Circus Circus kind of later in the evening, and this guy was very, very drunk and with his very, very drunk girlfriend and was trying to start a conversation with us.
1057821	1061003	You know how there's some drunkies that'll do that, like try to start a conversation with strangers?
1061063	1061824	Yeah, they're stupid.
1061864	1065626	And there's a right way to start a conversation with strangers, and there's a wrong way to do it.
1065666	1066027	Like, hey!
1066227	1066347	Hey!
1066407	1068668	How you doing, guy?
1069349	1070289	That's how he sounded, too.
1070510	1072151	He sounded like Animal from the Muppets.
1073131	1073652	Hey, guy!
1073692	1073772	Hey!
1075362	1078645	and he actually said, I'm a WoW player!
1079966	1081267	And I'm like, that's great.
1081287	1082589	You're a WoW, you're retarded.
1082609	1083529	Yeah, I'm like, me too.
1083590	1089675	But then he tried to tell me, he's like, yeah man, I like EverQuest on the PlayStation 2, that game's awesome!
1089995	1090356	And I'm like...
1091172	1092953	They didn't make EverQuest on the PlayStation 2.
1092993	1093533	I didn't say this.
1094053	1094673	Did they really?
1094693	1096174	They didn't make EverQuest on the PlayStation 2.
1096354	1096734	Yes, they did.
1096754	1096914	Did they?
1096974	1098674	EverQuest Online Adventures.
1098894	1102035	Yeah, it's one of the games I think they even bundled the hard drive with at one time.
1102135	1103876	I thought they didn't put EverQuest on PS2.
1103896	1105436	No, they didn't require the hard drive.
1105776	1106237	I thought they did.
1106357	1106497	No.
1106777	1108377	God, why would you play EverQuest on PS2?
1108417	1111038	I guess the same reason you play Final Fantasy XI on the PS2, I guess, but...
1114139	1115439	What?
1115580	1117460	Why would you play EverQuest on a PlayStation 2?
1117500	1121141	Because you don't have a good enough computer to run it, and you have to play a watered-down version.
1121481	1124002	Wow, I never knew that.
1124402	1125563	Oh, is this EverQuest 2?
1125703	1127664	Because I was going to say, you can't really water down EverQuest 1.
1127884	1130124	Yeah, you can.
1130144	1131885	You can open up Microsoft Paint.
1132469	1134610	and then just draw things there and it looks almost as good.
1135570	1137872	Alright, anything else you've been playing this week?
1139452	1147556	Well, I've been kind of sick and while I was waiting for Warsong Gulch to queue up, I just played a lot of a Wendon and cough on the screen.
1148536	1149277	It was pretty terrible.
1149297	1150457	Please tell me that's not my screen.
1151158	1151898	My DS Lite.
1153179	1154859	And know what else he played?
1155019	1155800	You forgot to mention that.
1155960	1156140	Huh.
1157719	1174126	in the groove 2 oh yeah I played in the groove 2 oh yeah I forgot we were all at the Arcana I played in the groove 2 too I did not touch in the groove 2 other than to step on the panels which by the way the dance pad used to be a max 2 therefore it is still kosher you know it's like
1174963	1176664	It's like pre-op, okay?
1177765	1181448	But it's still DDR, it's just got stickers on it.
1182448	1188873	I hate In The Groove and all, but they did get a couple really good songs, and the steps were fun for those songs.
1189269	1194410	I won't touch, like, 98% of that game, but there are, like, three songs that I'll play.
1194550	1202332	Yeah, and here's the thing is that Miklatov, not only will he play those same three songs over and over, but then he'll, like, stand by the machine and try to get everybody else to play the same damn song.
1202352	1203392	He's like, play this, play this.
1203412	1205653	I'm like, no, goddammit, I want to find my own song to play.
1205673	1207433	But you didn't want to find your own song.
1207453	1208974	Because you'll pick a crappy trap song.
1208994	1213335	No, but what I was doing is I was going through all the songs, listening to clips, see if there's anything I wanted to play, and they're really...
1213715	1214296	Wasn't a whole lot.
1214536	1215737	But to be fair, I don't know.
1215757	1217779	To be fair, I didn't know the songs that well.
1217799	1219260	There's like three songs.
1219300	1219600	You know what?
1219640	1221822	But when I did DDR Supernova the first time, I did that too.
1221982	1222683	I went through the whole thing.
1222703	1223684	I'm like, I don't really know if I want to play.
1223704	1224384	I don't know if I want to play.
1224404	1225325	Play Tierra Buena.
1225405	1226086	It's the best.
1226106	1226606	All right, forget it.
1226686	1231010	Anyway, let's... We did play Cusar and that was awesome.
1231450	1231650	Cusar.
1231671	1232972	Sure it was awesome.
1233992	1234633	Except not.
1235334	1236214	Let's get into tonight.
1236234	1239117	Shout out to LaserQuest back in Wichita for being better.
1239197	1239657	Boo!
1239697	1240318	LaserQuest sucks.
1240929	1242210	Can we get into the news tonight, please?
1242230	1242511	Thank you.
1243591	1248916	Start off with a little PSP news, but unfortunately this might be a bit of bad news for some of you PSP fans.
1249596	1253039	Target stores have recently pulled the UMD movies.
1253459	1259444	GamePro recently got a scoop that UMDs are now being discontinued in all Target stores as of last week.
1260585	1261305	You know what, though?
1262667	1267050	Honestly, UMDs, $10 more expensive than a DVD, yet.
1267369	1267649	and so on.
1292438	1293138	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1312162	1316288	Oh, so you think maybe it's a matter of Sony might go to this digital distribution thing for movies?
1316308	1318290	Oh, they want to do digital distribution for everything.
1318571	1327983	Because they're a little sad that their UMD format didn't take off, which the only thing I did think was pretty good about it is the fact that it's covered in a plastic case and you can't
1328354	1329074	Thanks for watching!
1345646	1345986	Whatever.
1346146	1365237	It's still, though, I think that was a pretty cool idea, just because, you know, it's good for the rental market, but the whole packaging of UMD with, and by the way, these aren't exactly my favorite picks of movies, like, was it Hitch, Triple X, God, and there was, like, Stealth, and something else.
1365277	1367078	They just won't let Stealth die.
1368061	1369082	Stealth was a bad movie.
1370002	1376486	I'm going to our chatroom, OrangeLunchRadio.com, and Maury says, I'm amazed they didn't drop them earlier, referring to the UMDs.
1376626	1377646	Because they're stubborn.
1377806	1379427	They want their stuff to work.
1379507	1382209	You bring up a good point, though, about the digital distribution here.
1382589	1390854	Everybody kind of is assuming, and it would make logical sense, that Apple, with their video iPods, are going to get into movie distribution by the end of the year.
1391414	1398939	That'll be the way that they sell iPods this Christmas is that video iPods will come out with a little larger of a screen and they're going to sell movies through the iTunes Music Store.
1400059	1413808	In fact, it's already somewhat been confirmed because I believe there's been news reports about Apple trying to negotiate with the movie companies and they don't want a flat rate for all the movies they want varying depending on how new the movie is and all that stuff.
1414232	1417014	So maybe Sony's just trying to beat them to the punch a little bit.
1417175	1422379	I mean, hypothetically, Sony could set up like a PSP store to download movies on your stick.
1422459	1424861	And that would be kind of interesting if they could beat Apple to it.
1425742	1426943	I don't think it would be enough.
1427504	1440135	You know, you don't think of a lot of people don't think of, you know, a gamer might be different, but the normal average person probably doesn't think of, hey, if I'm going to go listen to music on the go, I'm going to use my PSP.
1441067	1444628	I think the general public still views the PSP as a gaming system.
1445388	1446889	Yeah, it basically is a gaming system.
1446989	1449529	It's a gaming system that can also view movies if I want it.
1450330	1452370	If I'm tired of playing a game, I can pop in a movie.
1452410	1458792	But to be honest, I don't want to sit for three hours or two hours in front of my PSP trying to watch a movie.
1459392	1459892	It's not fun.
1459932	1466054	And even the Spider-Man 2 UMD that was in there with the PSP, I just don't care.
1466274	1467995	I think it's lame.
1468115	1468435	I don't know.
1469858	1470898	But, whatever.
1471778	1477600	Speaking of things being pulled, Sony has actually pulled their PSP ad campaign in Netherlands.
1477620	1483121	You know, the one that's been getting people all pissed off with the fact that it's got black and white people in it.
1483261	1483881	Oh my god.
1484321	1486561	And there's got to be something racial about it.
1486602	1494083	Well, apparently, all the bitching and moaning by the US, which is stupid because they shouldn't have even been getting in the business anyways.
1494443	1495183	It's a different country.
1496244	1497464	But, they pulled it anyways.
1498224	1498364	And,
1499639	1500980	Thanks for watching!
1515543	1517204	Go download last week's show, episode 190.
1517744	1526507	But we invited you guys in our voicemail of the week segment to leave your thoughts on what you thought about the whole controversy behind what was going on.
1526587	1528227	So I thought we could play a couple voicemails.
1528527	1532309	Some of you guys left some really good points, but your voicemails were really, really long.
1532389	1533649	We didn't have quite enough time to play them.
1533669	1539051	But I enjoyed listening to them, and I will share them with DarkSakura and Loki later on.
1539451	1543673	But I'm going to play two kind of short feedback ones that I thought were pretty good here in our voicemails of the week.
1543733	1544673	Here's voicemail number one.
1545762	1546943	Hey, this is Macman.
1547603	1554188	And in response to your question, of course Sony isn't racist.
1554288	1555169	They're just risky.
1556110	1562735	Remember the 10 years of passion sign or the take a running jump here on the subway sign?
1563435	1568699	They've done this before, except this time it involved two women of different color trying to kill each other.
1569340	1573923	Sony got us, but the important part is, Sony got us to talk about the white PSP.
1574144	1574704	Now, didn't they?
1575407	1577249	See you on the flip side, Macman.
1598311	1598571	Catfights
1618777	1620518	So it's just a good old-fashioned cat fight.
1620538	1621598	It's a good old-fashioned cat fight.
1621618	1628101	And to be honest, I think the whole ad campaign was a bit skewed anyways because they did have like 100 different images.
1628361	1632263	And of course the one where it shows the white person beating up on the black person.
1632623	1633984	Oh my god, racist!
1634084	1639646	But you know, when it's the black person beating up on the white person, it's just... Oh my god, LA.
1640047	1640627	Let's do another.
1640667	1642468	This is our last voicemail.
1642528	1644108	It's just a couple short ones this week.
1644188	1645529	Let's hear this next voicemail.
1647059	1649460	Hi there, this is Apollo from Nashville, Tennessee.
1649640	1653801	I'm just giving my thoughts on the whole Sony billboard ad thingamajig.
1654201	1673385	I just wanted to say that I think since Sony's a worldwide company and they've got their hands all over the world, I think that they're perfectly aware that race is still a very controversial topic in many places, and I kind of think that they should be more cautious to make sure that they're not releasing advertisements that are obvious targets for criticism.
1673845	1676526	I guess regardless, it did get released, so...
1676943	1677243	I don't know.
1677583	1679824	I don't think their message was that white is better than black.
1680224	1681784	And I don't think that's what they intended to think.
1681804	1684805	And I don't think they wanted to say that white people are better than black people.
1685425	1688045	So I think it's kind of ridiculous that people are making a huge deal out of it.
1688065	1690206	But at the same time, 50 should have been watching for it.
1691106	1693307	But anyway, that's just all I wanted to say.
1693467	1694227	Love your guys' show.
1694567	1696027	And I hope to hear from you soon.
1696267	1696467	Bye.
1697107	1697867	Thanks for the voicemail.
1697887	1698368	It was very nice.
1699428	1704769	I like how that person says that Sony kind of knew what they were doing.
1705805	1707126	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1734682	1737723	But it also polarized the community in many different ways.
1737903	1739404	So, any final thoughts on this issue?
1740184	1740464	I don't know.
1740484	1742865	I think the whole issue was stupid to begin with.
1743365	1748487	But then again, you know, Sony is known for stupid ad campaigns sometimes.
1748947	1750007	Well, so is Microsoft, though.
1750187	1750507	I don't know.
1750848	1754809	I think people that are advertising for video game systems really need to simplify things.
1754869	1755689	Do what Nintendo does.
1755789	1757490	I mean, at least theirs, you know, they show...
1758760	1787591	the games and you know here's what's on the DS Lite check it out you know and then people buy the DS Lite or buy you know whatever except no one bought the GameCube for that I don't know that's that whatever ad campaign they were doing for the GameCube just didn't work alright now if you'd like to leave us a voicemail our phone number is 916-226-9067 but please remember if you don't pay the phone bill please ask whoever does their permission before you call in because that's not an 800 number it's not a toll free call
1788599	1792302	Or you can always call us on Skype, username OrangeLoungeRadio when we are not live.
1792382	1793563	That way you get our voicemail.
1793803	1796926	It was just like the whole Xbox 360 advertising campaign.
1797707	1798167	Jump in.
1798507	1799128	It made no sense.
1799268	1800609	It had nothing to do with the Xbox 360.
1800889	1803031	It's like, people having fun, Xbox 360.
1804803	1831862	and like I said before I probably mentioned this before we had a project in our high school economics class to create a product and make a commercial for it advertising the product and my friend he created took a bunch of clips from like different TV shows and showing explosions and stuff and just one big long montage set to music and the very end buy bumper stickers it was great because it it was just something to entertain you but it had nothing to do with the product
1832282	1860301	I helped my friends in Spanish class my senior year of high school they had to do a commercial but in Spanish so we did a condom commercial and they got an F for doing a condom commercial oh come on that's retarded but I remember because we were all sitting around the bed like we would film we just filmed the product on the bed and everybody was pushing the bed so it was going up and down and they failed but it was really funny and if that was on TV if that was on Univision I think it was funny
1862379	1863079	Uh, bitch teacher.
1863319	1863740	Uh, anyway.
1863760	1865180	I'm sorry.
1866301	1868922	Um, a voicemail topics for this week.
1868962	1870323	I want to give you guys a topic for this week.
1870343	1871843	And it kind of goes into our next story here.
1871903	1876625	And this is a great blog piece that was on a website called Twitch Guru.
1876665	1877886	It's actually kind of old.
1877946	1878866	It's an older piece.
1879186	1881387	But it was picking up some notoriety on gaming blogs.
1881427	1884529	I mean, literally, you'd have to go back to September of 2005 to see this piece.
1884809	1887210	But for some reason, it was getting picked up by a bunch of sites this week.
1887250	1888450	So that's how it caught our attention.
1888770	1889951	But you can ask this question.
1890706	1891166	Any time.
1891186	1894749	This is kind of a timeless issue, yet it's not.
1895370	1897391	Are video games getting easier?
1897772	1898252	Think about it.
1898492	1904737	Back in the 1980s, you had things like Pac-Man, where it was pretty hard to get far into that game.
1904797	1907239	I mean, seriously, what's the furthest you've ever gotten Pac-Man?
1907579	1908440	Or think about Ms.
1908460	1908840	Pac-Man.
1908860	1910622	Have you ever gotten past the first two boards?
1911653	1914836	You know how there's the pink board and there's the blue board?
1914856	1918138	Have you ever gotten to the red boards or the ones that come later on?
1918438	1920960	I mean, the old games there were really, really hard.
1921681	1925204	But games today don't seem to be as challenging.
1925264	1927586	It seems to be there's more finite, a way to finish them.
1927606	1934551	You know what's funny, too, is a lot of those older games like Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man they see as approachable games for people, even though they are harder.
1934871	1935472	That's kind of funny.
1936673	1938494	So I'm curious, what do you guys think?
1938594	1940596	Are video games getting easier as time goes on?
1941770	1942391	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1973191	1981279	Well, the casual gamer buys the so-called casual games like Pac-Man, Galaga, Frogger, Gauntlet.
1983261	1984683	Wait, these were all harder games.
1984863	1985323	What the hell?
1985504	1987466	I mean, I don't get it.
1989488	1991970	I think what it is is less complex games, maybe.
1992291	1992571	They're
1993405	1996587	Simpler concepts, but harder difficulty.
1997067	1998447	So, you know, Pac-Man's easy.
1998668	1999968	You know, gobble dots.
2001069	2003610	And that's kind of what the Wii's selling point is, right?
2004350	2005311	Pick up the thing and go.
2005771	2006611	Yeah, simple games.
2006772	2009753	You can make a simple game that is really hard.
2010013	2013555	It's just, you know, don't make it so complex with 52 buttons.
2013755	2017857	I mean, it's basically, you know, Pac-Man, pick up dots.
2018684	2019584	and Eat Ghosts.
2020144	2020605	Pretty simple.
2020645	2023165	You don't even need to use a button, just a joystick for it.
2023225	2024686	So, I don't know.
2024926	2026966	TigerClaw makes an interesting point in our chat room.
2027006	2031887	Back in the 80s, video games were more about getting high scores so you could enter your initials in the top 5 or 10.
2033528	2037409	I used to have the top score on a moon patrol machine at the local pizza parlor.
2037609	2037929	I rock.
2038655	2040356	Anyway, we're curious about your thoughts on this.
2040396	2047062	Are video games getting easier or is this just where the market is headed and it's not that the games are getting easier?
2047082	2050184	I mean, you think about some really hard games that have come out like Ninja Gaiden and things.
2051005	2057190	Are video games getting easier or is there just the misconception because games used to be a lot simpler?
2057630	2058551	They weren't as complex.
2058971	2062654	So we're really curious what you guys' thoughts are on that and we look forward to hearing your voicemails of the week.
2063675	2065476	We'll play some of our favorites on next week's show.
2066457	2066777	Awesome.
2067256	2076544	Well, kind of speaking a little bit about difficulty, one thing that's been difficult is Sony selling the PlayStation 3 to all the gamers out there.
2077225	2091457	Well, one thing that they did supposedly make, and this was leaked out apparently, was this internal kind of almost like a Q&A for E3, for anybody that's working for Sony to be able to answer press questions about the PlayStation 3.
2091697	2094480	And I thought it was quite interesting, some of the things on there.
2095340	2100121	One of the most interesting things on there is they are really stressing the fact that the PlayStation 3 is a computer.
2100161	2106202	In fact, I think it mentions it about six or seven times in here, saying PlayStation 3 is a computer system.
2106902	2111383	Then they're also basically saying it's one product with different configurations.
2111463	2115904	So they're trying to basically say, Sony, we can sell you a PlayStation 3.
2116404	2117564	It's kind of like Dell.
2118064	2119685	We can build you a custom system.
2121869	2129452	One interesting thing, though, about it is they're saying that the noise of the system is supposed to be about the same of a slim PS2, so, you know, pretty quiet.
2130832	2136694	Also, of course, you know, kind of following up with what they said during E3, that it'll be able to support eight controllers.
2138795	2142596	They're guessing maybe four wireless, four wired controllers.
2143116	2143496	Not sure.
2145737	2147738	And that the specs are pretty close to final.
2148544	2149445	That was one of the other things.
2150425	2156010	And that the Blu-ray drive is going to be BD Live compliant.
2156030	2161654	In other words, you'll be able to connect to the internet using some of the special features on the Blu-ray discs.
2163656	2171702	Kind of interesting, but I thought it was kind of funny though just how much they were stressing the PlayStation 3 being an actual computer system.
2171822	2177326	In fact, there were some interesting things on here including right here
2178946	2183507	PS3 is being positioned as a computer system, not a computer entertainment system.
2184007	2189309	Like other computer systems, it can be upgraded through the use of readily available industry standard adapters.
2190229	2195850	They're basically saying any PC USB components you can use with this PlayStation 3.
2196690	2205612	Another interesting thing on here is they were asking them the difference between Xbox Live and the PlayStation 3 Live.
2205632	2208333	They kind of dodged the question, which was kind of funny.
2209703	2212404	But yeah, so it was pretty interesting.
2212565	2213986	I love this comment in our chat room.
2214046	2218629	Rini says, if the PlayStation 3 is a computer system, I want to run Word and Photoshop on it.
2220450	2221591	Well, you know... Why not?
2221891	2223633	If the PlayStation 3 is such a computer?
2225034	2232859	Well, they said that you can run Linux on it, and in fact, one of the questions is, will Linux OS be adopted as you have planned?
2232939	2238043	And it says, yes, PS3 is a computer system, and Linux OS is adopted as one of the standard OSes.
2239242	2244226	Our chatroom also seems to be running with that story from a couple weeks ago where the controller is supposedly called the Poos.
2244866	2251112	And now they're calling it... I see DMN made a comment here where he says, HD DVD is greater than Pooray.
2252693	2253934	And now they're calling it Pooray.
2254795	2255315	That's cute.
2255916	2258598	And now even DJ Pooeater changed his name to Pooseater.
2259819	2260099	Get it?
2261080	2261100	I...
2261725	2264068	I still say that story was a piece of poo.
2264468	2265189	I don't think it's true.
2265910	2267451	We'll see when it comes out.
2267511	2269874	I think they probably won't call it the poos.
2269934	2274599	It'll probably be like some infinity sign, something or other.
2275640	2278222	Everyone will call it poos.
2278262	2280305	Seriously, Sony, if you're listening, just change the name.
2280545	2280665	Just
2281124	2282425	Call it the PS3 controller.
2282626	2283327	Really, it works.
2284067	2290414	Anyway, one other PlayStation 3 thing that kind of left a lot of people with a question mark over their head was this trailer that they showed at E3.
2290815	2291315	You remember?
2291656	2294960	It was this trailer, and then there was all these animals that would come out.
2295000	2302208	Yes, it was Africa was the big title, and the people were like... I mean, you could seriously... I remember we were all sitting at the...
2303727	2315182	Arena Interactive Lounge, where a lot of the All Games contingent, us and some of our cousin shows that all broadcast on allgames.com were all kind of sitting around and watching the Sony thing and there was just this big collective
2315762	2317542	Fumitsu Magazine Revealed
2338881	2345846	Sony Computer Entertainment's Daisaku Ikajiri is involved with the game's development.
2346187	2351410	Now, Ikajiri has also worked on Hot Shots Golf 3, 4, Portable, and Online.
2352251	2356014	So, this game may or may not have something in common with Hot Shots Golf.
2357335	2357755	That's it.
2357795	2358916	That's the only detail you get.
2360117	2360777	Africa.
2362599	2364240	Yeah, that sounds exciting.
2364952	2365873	One thing I forgot to mention.
2365913	2370419	However, in light of recent events, I hope Sony really uses some tact when promoting this game.
2371921	2375566	Yeah, well, one thing I forgot to mention in the last story.
2378069	2381254	The one question, how the PS3 network service is going to be.
2381673	2383154	will also start the service at day one.
2383194	2386116	What are the differences between Xbox Live and the PS3 network services?
2386377	2388258	I thought I'd just quote exactly what they said here.
2388698	2402089	Apart from providing basic features and functions, the most important element is content and services, downloading music in SingStar, purchasing or exchanging game data, as we demonstrated at the E3 press conference, and many other new ways of enjoyment, too, will be provided.
2402389	2403650	Wow, that doesn't say anything.
2404070	2409074	And also the fact that they're also saying that the PlayStation 3 will be only available in black.
2410555	2410815	DarkSakura,
2433032	2433332	DarkSakura.com
2453840	2462166	Interview here, one of the quotes that they were saying about Kaz, he blatantly said Microsoft is copying Sony.
2462806	2467889	And, of course, Phil Harrison's remark was, well, quotes can be taken out of contests.
2468790	2471672	Well, that was the actual sentence, though.
2473373	2475615	How can you take that out of context?
2475675	2477836	I mean, that seems pretty clear to me.
2477936	2478396	But, anyways...
2479935	2484256	Yeah, he didn't like the fact that they were asking him hard questions, which I thought was pretty funny.
2484697	2492439	But, you know, you gotta feel sorry for that Phil Harrison guy, because, I mean, I remember when they were first talking about the PlayStation 3 before we knew anything, you know, about the price.
2494460	2503022	It, you know, he's got to cover up for all these, like, you know, higher-ups that are saying really dumb shit every week, and you gotta feel bad for him.
2503042	2505143	Whatever.
2505163	2505403	Whatever.
2507076	2510297	I think we should just move on to some Xbox news for a little bit here.
2510777	2512957	And I think this is kind of interesting.
2513318	2517959	I think we already knew this, but the Xbox has been officially discontinued.
2518259	2523420	At least that's a rumor going around, but honestly, seeing as I can't seem to find a new Xbox for sale anywhere.
2523440	2526121	If I remember correctly, the Xbox has been officially discontinued.
2526181	2529982	I'm not talking about 360, I'm talking about the regular old school Xbox.
2530282	2530582	But what's...
2530962	2548225	The other rumor that's kind of interesting to note is that there is a new Xbox 360 Pro bundle being prepared by Microsoft, supposedly, that has Project Gotham Racing 3 included with it, along with a 1,250 Microsoft point card and a three-month subscription to Xbox Live Gold.
2548550	2550031	and it will run you $399.
2550932	2554595	But what's not mentioned there is does that include the hard drive?
2554715	2557818	I'm assuming it does because in order to get on live you've got to have a hard drive.
2558639	2559259	I guess that's true.
2559699	2561841	How are you going to spend the points with no hard drive?
2563302	2563603	We'll see.
2564724	2565985	Would you lose the cables?
2566605	2566845	No.
2566926	2567246	I don't know.
2567646	2569707	I think what they'll do is they'll probably just put that out.
2569767	2571728	It's just going to be a bundle.
2572148	2579812	You won't be able to find the system by itself and then it'll be just coming with that game and stuff instead of the premium bundle or premium system.
2580032	2582633	SSJ100, Matt makes an interesting observation in chat room.
2582673	2586695	It's funny that the PlayStation 1 lasted longer in production than the original Xbox.
2589877	2590817	Well, I don't know.
2591858	2596060	I hope it doesn't happen because that sucks for us because we have a stockpile of like a thousand units and
2598193	2600355	Street Fighter 2, Galaga Frogger and Pac-Man
2627017	2633182	And they're going to be releasing them every Wednesday, starting with, well, last Wednesday when Frogger came out.
2633823	2637766	Next week you can look forward to cloning Clyde, which will be pretty fun.
2638247	2640288	And then of course Galaga following on the 26th.
2641593	2643674	Street Fighter 2 on August 2nd.
2644134	2645155	Are you sure this time?
2645375	2646435	Are we sure this time?
2646495	2649357	This is official press release from Microsoft.
2649497	2650337	Freaking better be.
2650497	2651218	Last chance.
2651578	2653839	And Pac-Man on August 9th.
2654059	2657421	And I believe shortly after that there'll be some more stuff coming out.
2657461	2661543	But they're trying to do it every week or so.
2661583	2663124	They're going to be releasing a new title.
2663364	2665565	And not very expensive.
2665685	2667726	They're going to be about $5 to $10.
2667766	2669046	Street Fighter 2 being $10.
2669106	2670007	Same with Cloning Clyde.
2670327	2670867	everything else is $5.
2670987	2677890	I have this random thought because we were talking earlier about our video games getting easier and we were talking about the retro games.
2678170	2685492	It does seem like these retro games are really making a comeback slowly but surely with all these retro collections we saw.
2685753	2693795	The Atari, the Intellivision Lives, the Midway collections and now Xbox Live Arcade sort of getting some new life to the retro games as well.
2694756	2697997	Is that possibly because people feel that
2699022	2700443	XBOX Live is finally getting some new stuff, so...
2721343	2723384	Hopefully even more arcade releases by the end of the year.
2723444	2731528	Well, not only are there releases in the arcade category, but they're also getting some releases in some of the video and movie categories as well.
2731568	2733149	In fact, I actually downloaded this this week.
2733529	2738551	It's Halo 3 in the Beginning was released on Xbox Live this week.
2738991	2748236	And in Halo 3 in the Beginning, basically what it is, it's a trailer about making the teaser announcement for Halo 3.
2749136	2750277	A trailer of a trailer.
2750377	2752358	Yes, it's a trailer about the making of a trailer.
2752858	2757060	And it's not even like the real trailer, it's the teaser trailer.
2758340	2764683	And so in a way I'm kind of going, this is just like the biggest self-ego inflation piece I've ever seen on a video game console.
2767262	2776212	But, I don't know, at the same time, I downloaded it because it's free, and I'm like, oh, this is pretty, and it's HD, and I'll watch anything in HD because it's pretty, especially when it has to do with gaming.
2776453	2781899	But I did find it was fascinating, I mean, all the freaking work that went into making just that, you know...
2782782	2788225	I don't know if I'd spend the $4,000 on the plasma screen for it, but if I had a 70-inch plasma screen, you know, a next-gen...
2811543	2813404	Video device would look pretty nice on it.
2813604	2823347	But you can actually see some of the details, like the little individual hairs on a flower and stuff like that.
2823827	2825768	Just an insane amount of detail.
2826428	2829609	All right, well, someone just joined us who wants to comment on all this.
2831194	2832455	Actually, hi, everybody.
2833036	2833636	Hi, DarkSakura!
2833656	2835017	I am literally just off the road.
2835978	2839421	Actually, I had a conversation with DMN when I did my Tuesday show.
2839721	2844886	He mentioned that basically the HD DVD was blowing away Blu-ray for quality.
2846087	2848148	I think they're about neck and neck, if I remember correctly.
2848228	2856435	But even still, I was asking about the 1080p plasma screens out there, and they didn't have too many at the store.
2856455	2857876	I mean, they carried a lot of stuff.
2858337	2858557	So...
2859482	2860182	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2886596	2887337	Don't I always?
2887717	2888478	At least she admits it.
2888498	2889780	Amazingly enough, all the bad drivers were male.
2894262	2894943	Okay, okay.
2895003	2901127	Especially the one who was tailgating the person in front of him, skidded off the side of the road, and blew a rock into my windshield.
2901528	2905431	Oh, I forgot we had somebody else on your mic, so I want to make sure we're not blowing the audience away there.
2905551	2906111	Sorry about that.
2906191	2908193	With the awesomeness of my voice.
2908353	2908793	Sorry about that.
2910154	2910534	Yeah.
2910875	2912856	Anyway, well, how was your gaming week?
2912876	2913537	You want to get that out?
2913957	2914157	Sure.
2914257	2919081	My gaming week actually was a lot of Animal Crossing and a lot of pinball.
2919821	2920622	A lot of pinball.
2921733	2923734	I played so much pinball last weekend.
2924054	2926295	Was it just that show that you called us from last week?
2926335	2928136	Well, that and playing pinball in my garage.
2928836	2930437	Did you end up buying any new machines?
2930717	2936759	We did not, and actually we lost out on the Black Knight 2000 we were going to get because we went back to check on it and it had been sold to somebody else for $600!
2937160	2937760	Can you believe it?
2937960	2938300	Yikes.
2939681	2946123	But we are working on a World Cup Soccer 94, which is actually one of my favorite machines for nostalgia value.
2947084	2947224	And...
2948303	2954651	We actually, two of our triggers on our last action hero broke, so we have to replace that before we can keep playing it.
2955592	2959177	But Dan got our roulette working on our whodunit pinball, so that's awesome.
2959237	2960138	It now completely works.
2960679	2960959	All right.
2961259	2961640	Sounds fun.
2961720	2963642	And I play a lot of eyeball crossing.
2963823	2967167	I got a note that our chat room here is just, they're celebrating that you're back.
2968932	2971233	DMN says, nice of you to show up, DarkSakura.
2971253	2971773	Hey!
2972334	2973835	No, I think you meant that in a good way, though.
2973855	2974015	Oh, hi.
2974435	2975596	And let's see, what else?
2975996	2978137	Mori says, yay, DarkSakura's around again.
2978197	2978837	Life is fun.
2979478	2980538	Life is always fun with me here.
2980558	2981339	I have a party every day.
2981599	2986001	And then somebody referred to, oh, Dark Knight said, DarkSakura is the queen of the show.
2986121	2987482	All hail the OLR queen.
2987862	2990964	And then DMN followed that up with, I thought Skye was the queen of the show.
2992185	2992585	Screw you.
2994306	2994666	Anyways.
2994806	2995907	Only on special occasions.
2997489	2999210	Okay, well anyways, back to the new stuff.
3000891	3004634	One of the things that actually happened this week was EA's Summer Showcase.
3005415	3011539	And that's basically kind of like their little press event that they have showcasing their brand new titles that are going to be coming out.
3012419	3019544	And the top of the showcase, of course, the next-gen version of Half-Life 2, which is going to be on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3020205	3025569	So that's pretty interesting that that's been confirmed and not too much of a surprise since, you know, it's going to be...
3027421	3028342	Oh god, I can't remember.
3056806	3058106	But anyways, yeah, lots of good stuff.
3058126	3059487	Team Fortress 2, that's what it was.
3061267	3062128	So, pretty cool.
3062888	3069890	Alright, for those of you guys listening live here on this Sunday evening, we all got booted from chat because we had too many of us trying to hit the chatroom at once.
3069970	3072131	All four of us here in the room, we're all in the chatroom.
3072631	3076593	And we got booted from the server, so it's probably going to be a few more minutes before we get back in.
3076653	3080714	So, apologize for that, you guys, and we'll work on that at least throughout the break.
3081632	3084275	Meanwhile, we've just got to keep it running here, so I'm going to go to the next story here.
3084895	3090259	Every Xtend Extra has a demo that's been released, and it's only for the PC.
3090860	3096204	So even though this game is going to be coming out for the PSP, you can only get the demo on your PC.
3096384	3097065	That's stupid.
3097145	3104631	Well, here's the thing, though, is that every Xtend was actually a PC game way back in the day, so I'm assuming that every Xtend Extra is also coming out for the PC.
3105792	3109515	Well, why don't they do another PSP demo, because I know that they had what...
3110356	3120678	LocoRoco, and, you know, there was some, well, in Japan there was, like, some Sudoku demo and stuff like that, but that's about it.
3120918	3127779	I mean, this brand new feature that they add to the PSP and they do nothing with, excellent use of the PSP.
3128199	3137821	Because, you know, no one really wants demos to download off the internet, of course, because, you know, Xbox Live's Marketplace, demos, just, no one ever downloads those.
3138851	3146473	and especially with the PSP needing people to buy some of this software out there because there hasn't really been that many great games lately.
3148273	3148573	I don't know.
3149673	3151233	Just hear me rant some more.
3153454	3153774	All right.
3154214	3155694	Well, let's go to another story here.
3156675	3162696	This is something that our music game fans... I'm kind of mad that we're booted from chat right now because I really would love to get reaction to this.
3163296	3163716	But anyway...
3165012	3169195	Konami has filed a patent for the title Guitar Revolution.
3170456	3177261	Now, what's interesting about this is that a lot of people are saying, oh, well, this means that Konami is planning to compete with Guitar Hero.
3177301	3181084	They're going to go directly head-to-head with Guitar Hero.
3181445	3188310	And a lot of people seem to be neglecting the fact that Konami had a game, Guitar Game Out, in Japan for quite some time.
3188854	3189914	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3206837	3208097	Here in the US for quite some time.
3208137	3210838	But now they've gone and trademarked the name Guitar Revolution.
3211198	3220621	So that would indicate if they are planning to revive the franchise here in the US, they're going to change the name of it to fit DDR, you know, Dance Dance Revolution and Karaoke Revolution and all that good stuff.
3223803	3229564	Of course, just because they patented the name doesn't mean that they are going to make it.
3229985	3231265	I mean, they could just be
3232046	3233628	It could be a concept thing at this time.
3233668	3235750	They just don't want anyone else to jump in on it.
3236170	3241575	But, I don't know, it kind of looks like they could be prepping for a new game.
3241595	3243417	What do you think, Loki?
3243777	3244438	Probably.
3244998	3249142	I mean, it makes sense, especially with the success of Guitar Hero.
3249402	3251924	I mean, it would be something that they would probably want to do.
3252901	3253181	I don't know.
3253241	3259246	I think the whole problem before is they didn't know how to market Guitar Freaks to the people.
3259647	3265912	And now that they've seen how it's basically been done, they can kind of go from there.
3266513	3266853	So yeah.
3267253	3271297	So I have to ask Miklatov if we can get him a mic real quick.
3271457	3272478	He had to move a little bit there.
3272698	3273158	How you doing?
3273619	3273779	I'm good.
3274543	3286010	I know you can't really talk a whole lot about this because you work at Konami or whatever, but surely you must have some thoughts on the reaction out there that people are having to this?
3286570	3287851	I totally do.
3289292	3296416	First of all, I'd like to say that my opinions do not reflect Konami's opinions, just a lot of people that work there.
3296696	3297517	Or our opinion.
3298257	3298958	Yeah, whoever.
3299838	3302740	It's my opinion and that's what I'm sticking to.
3302840	3303080	Okay.
3303883	3314672	So, when this Guitar Revolution stuff came out, a wonderfully crappy site named 1up.com decided that one of their idiots would write about it.
3316153	3319656	And his name is Jared Rhea, just so everybody knows.
3319896	3322118	He also goes by Slip, I think?
3323099	3323539	I don't know.
3323719	3324940	I don't pay attention to him.
3325781	3325921	But...
3327443	3338727	What he did in his little blog post is pretty much say how our company actually works internally, which he doesn't know, because he doesn't work there.
3339347	3340587	So that's pretty libelous.
3340627	3351831	And he also decided to bash on the DDR team that's in America, saying that we care more about what songs we get in the game.
3352398	3357701	rather than the quality, which is not true because we can't do anything about quality or songs.
3358281	3360022	So, he's a moron.
3360663	3375371	And then, apparently really recently, maybe today, I don't know how to read dates, he talks about how he and one of my co-workers are pretty... I'll read, read, read, read, read.
3377191	3381674	That he's taking credit for being a catalyst...
3382335	3394420	to the DDR revolution sort of thing in America, and that he's one of the people that is behind the scenes making everyone move their feet, to quote his blog post.
3394860	3395600	Well, he's not.
3395760	3397001	He never worked at Konami.
3397361	3401263	All he is is this whiny little punk that worked at 1up.com.
3401303	3402663	He no longer does, it looks like.
3403864	3408525	And I pretty much hate his guts.
3409046	3409786	And he's an idiot.
3410743	3417646	I could say a whole lot more, but it would involve a lot of cussing, and since I don't do that, I can't say any more.
3419767	3423989	Let me try to go back to the topic at hand, because I'm trying to not go there.
3424869	3425489	I'll go there.
3426250	3426830	I know you will.
3427110	3428250	I'm trying to think.
3428551	3428791	Okay.
3433331	3448347	What is the public, you have these people that are very vocal about, especially I noticed within the Groove fans, I'm not talking about this blogger, but like in the Groove fans have this huge misconception about the way DDR is made in America.
3449005	3455007	What are the biggest misconceptions people have of Konami in general and the way that they're making their games, if there's anything you can say on that?
3455107	3457227	I don't think there's anything I can actually say about that.
3457447	3461769	All right, well, I think... I was going to beat him up.
3462089	3469851	I think Miklatov got us started on a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio called the FUs of the Week.
3480199	3480419	DarkSakura
3512527	3518829	I'd like to say a big F you, and not really a problem I have anymore, to my old couch.
3519729	3521869	It sucked, and it's gone.
3522470	3525191	Dump that piece of shit in the landfill.
3526271	3527311	I have a nice new couch now.
3530392	3530772	Alright.
3531953	3533733	Nikolatov, do you have anything additional?
3534953	3539735	I'd like to say an F you to 1up.com for being a terrible, terrible site.
3540683	3542864	and for hiring people that have no skill.
3544185	3552510	I'd also like to clarify that views and... Yeah, like all views and opinions of our guests do not reflect those of the rest of us, but... Okay.
3554211	3554551	Let's see.
3554731	3555451	I'm not done.
3555691	3556772	Okay, what else?
3556792	3565497	F you to Lopedis Golf Land because they put all their dancing games right next to each other, so now...
3565942	3572126	If I want to go play Pump, I have to weed through the Supernova people and the Groove people, which are taking up way too much space for me.
3572646	3574867	Oh yeah, I saw a Pump Zero machine in Reno yesterday.
3574967	3575668	It's really fun.
3575748	3576928	I didn't play it.
3578609	3580030	What do I want to give an FU to this week?
3580070	3583712	Oh, I'll give an FU to Reno for robbing me of $40 from their slot machines.
3583992	3588995	I thought Reno was supposed to have better slot machines than the Indian casinos we have here, but I suppose not.
3591397	3593938	FU to those one-armed bandits taking money from me.
3594618	3595579	They're supposed to give me money.
3596172	3596672	That's not fair.
3598353	3599934	All right, let's get back into some news here.
3600174	3602475	And again, we are still locked out of the chat room.
3602535	3603576	There's not a lot we can do.
3603616	3606457	We're just kind of going to try and keep getting back in there.
3606517	3607878	And we'll be hopefully back soon.
3608318	3608999	So meanwhile.
3609619	3611520	Yes, excellent.
3612000	3614922	But meanwhile, I'd like to talk to you guys.
3616972	3621635	about Take-Two and how they just constantly like to get in the trouble.
3622255	3626418	Well, this time, they're in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
3627158	3631440	And this, luckily, has nothing to do with the whole hot coffee thing.
3631921	3639645	But it actually has to do with the stock option grants that are made by the company from 1997 to the present.
3639685	3640406	And basically, they're just
3645862	3647563	They're not having a good day.
3648323	3650525	And they really need another Grand Theft Auto to come out.
3651445	3659390	And they better not fuck up the network gameplay on Vice City Stories or I will be pissed.
3660310	3664472	I will fly my ass down there and beat the crap out of them personally.
3668174	3669435	I hate those network programmers.
3669495	3670616	God damn it, they were so lazy.
3673197	3674758	Anyways, moving on.
3675706	3682289	Speaking of programming, Hellgate London, the source code has been stolen and leaked to the internet.
3682389	3696415	Kind of like some other games out there, but apparently someone on the inside stole the... I remember seeing this at E3, the Hellgate London game, but didn't really play it.
3697455	3697755	I don't know.
3697895	3698336	Interesting.
3698456	3700136	But yeah, Hacker Strike again.
3700296	3700536	Yay.
3701717	3701937	Alright.
3703478	3703538	Um...
3705444	3708625	Going to another story here, speaking of kind of London-ish.
3708725	3709546	It's about the UK.
3709586	3710806	It's about the government in the UK.
3712307	3717088	The British government is actually going to be organizing a census to track the game industry's growth.
3717849	3723151	The survey is being administered by Skill Set, and this is an entertainment research group.
3723531	3730013	And what they're going to do is they're going to gather data, and this could actually influence decisions made by the parliament later on.
3730474	3734135	There's a quote from the creative director of Eidos Interactive saying,
3734655	3736716	The census is a headcount of the industry.
3737076	3742178	It helps Skill Set influence government, policymakers, and public funds for the benefit and support of the industry.
3743058	3747599	And the Skill Set will be going out to company managing directors and human resource departments.
3747920	3750880	And you can also, if you happen to be one of these people, you can do it online.
3751401	3753301	It's available on the Skill Set website.
3753361	3757343	It's skillset.org slash research slash census.
3757383	3760444	And they'll start the result calculating on July 12th.
3760464	3760504	So...
