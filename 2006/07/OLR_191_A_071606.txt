Tonight, July 16th, 2006, Target pulls UMDs from shelves, new rumors are floating around about the Wii controller, and is Konami planning to directly compete with Guitar Hero?
Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
This is episode number 191 for this
DarkSakura.com
She's just running late tonight.
She was in the Bay Area this weekend doing something and she's running a little late, but she says she will be here in time for Part B and she might even make it to the show depending on how long we run during Part A. I told her whenever she gets here, just barge on in.
and say hello.
So we'll be looking forward to hearing from her very soon.
I'm sure you didn't have to tell her to do that.
She'll just kick the door down.
I'm here!
Anyway, we'll see.
The traffic was horrible!
Yeah, what do you want to bet when she gets here?
There's going to be some type of rant about the traffic.
In fact, I already know there was an accident.
She told me...
She told me part of the reason she wasn't here is that there's an accident on one of the highways that kept her kind of late.
She'll be bright and cheery.
All right.
Good.
We'll try to time the FUs of the week in time for her arrival, but I don't know.
We got a plan we got to stick to.
Anyway, we do have the one and only Miklatov filling in again.
You never leave.
I try not to.
All right.
But Miklatov has something very important he's going to say tonight.
Somewhat.
It's probably about women.
All right.
Anyway.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Played a little bit of Chromehounds Basically you have to go through all the training missions As you would call them And they have it split up into six different sections For each type of class you want to do And you unlock parts that way Because basically if you want to build a mech You have to play through the whole single player game In order to get some good parts And so I've been playing that And playing a lot of Ridge Racer I'm kind of done with that game
Thanks for watching!
RidgeRacer 6 is no different, and that's another reason why I will not be buying RidgeRacer 2 when that comes out for the PSP.
It's just going to be the same damn shit all over again.
That's so weird to me that you already have RidgeRacer 6, yet they're going to go back and do RidgeRacer 2.
I know it's different.
It's RidgeRacer PSP 2.
I know it's different, but it's still just kind of weird when you talk about it.
R4 was awesome, but
You know, I didn't have to like, I'm like, oh yeah, I remember this track.
So you know how to race it already.
And the drifting is just completely wrong anyways.
And I played... I'm done with the game.
I just need to sell it before it drops price again.
And just, you know, get rid of it.
So I can, you know, buy more games in August.
The other game I played was Zygopane.
XOR.
And...
And basically, this is a Japanese-only Xbox 360 game, but doing a nifty little region trick, you can download a demo that's on the live marketplace right now.
It's an interesting game.
Reminds me a bit of Zone of Vendors, just the way the combat system is.
It is kind of neat, though, because you use the right analog to kind of switch targets to which one you want to fire against.
And then basically, you have your normal shot and charged shots, and then this kind of like special attack, which is just more charged shots.
It's neat.
I wouldn't buy it, but it's kind of neat.
I played a little bit of Frogger, and what can I say?
Frogger's Frogger.
And, yeah, I think that was... I'm still playing through Blazing Angels.
You know, the game's now to the point where I just want it to be over.
I love how every week you come... Like, for the past four or five weeks when I've come on the show, I've been playing Blazing Angels this week.
I hate it!
It's been like the past five weeks.
You haven't stopped playing it.
If you hate a game, throw it away.
The last achievement, man.
Last achievement.
True points horror.
Well, I have to.
The fact that they make these different modes, like arcade mode and the mini campaign mode, they're all the same.
All the same.
The only difference between the arcade mode and, say, the mini campaign mode, you fight 20 planes.
That's it.
In the arcade mode, you fight
Thanks for watching!
Loki, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
So, you know, that's true.
I do remember your past few FUs of the week have been about traffic, so I think you just got pwned.
Let's see.
Oh, here we go.
You will bow to me once you know exactly how many achievement points do you have.
I don't have a lot.
We always call you an achievement points whore, but you really don't have that many.
I don't.
Compared to some people.
I just don't have enough time to play stuff.
Don't you break like 3,000?
Yeah.
That's a lot.
I only have like 1,200 or something.
What I try to do is I sit down with a game that I want to get rid of, like Ridge Racer or Blazing Angels.
and I just play it and play it and play it and play it until I finally get all the achievement points and then I go and sell it.
And my game after Ridge Racer and Blazing Angels, the next one's going to be Rumble Roses XX because that game was lame.
Luckily though, Blazing Angels and Rumble Roses, I did not pay for.
I got those free from Konami and Ubisoft.
Yeah, they were really thankful to give those away.
Ridge Racer did spend money on.
And to be honest, Ridge Racer's fun.
It's fun, but... It was okay.
I think there's better racers on 360 right now, but I had fun with it.
It's a fun game.
As a more traditional racer that's not like blow shit up, it's pretty good.
I would like to see the next Burnout.
You know, something that's made from scratch and not a port.
I think that would be better.
Or maybe, I don't know, it's a good arcade racing game is what we need out there.
Anything else you've been playing this week?
I think that's it.
Grand Theft Auto, of course.
on Xbox Live Arcade.
I mean, hell, it was five bucks, and I wanted something new, so I was kind of a sucker.
I got it.
And it was actually a lot better than I expected.
I was expecting it to just be a straight arcade port with not a lot of extra frills, but I think it's kind of cool that they have some extra stuff.
They did enhance the graphics for whatever it's worth.
I mean, it's nothing to scream about.
It looks like they enhanced it from the Atari 2600-style graphics that it used to be
Well, actually, I'll give them more credit.
More like NES-style graphics.
They souped it up to, like, Super NES-style graphics.
So, it's still not that great.
But, you know, it's alright.
But the game, you know, it's amazingly simple and will entertain you for a little bit.
I do like the fact they have co-op modes in there and some other multiplayer modes.
Except, I only played one co-op game, but it was laggy as hell.
I mean, it was to the point where
Thank you for watching!

Prey Doom 3
No, I'm kidding.
It's definitely on there.
Or like, I liked it better when it was called Duke Nukem 3.
It's very obvious, so there's a lot in common with the Doom 3 interface.
And to be honest, I haven't done my research on the game.
I'm not sure if they use the Doom 3 interface.
It is the Doom 3 interface.
Okay, that's not a surprise at all, honestly.
I can tell.
Because you, instead of having a flashlight, you have a lighter.
Yeah, but you do have the gravity stuff, which is kind of cool.
Like, you go...
You can walk up these ramps and go upside down and stuff.
But the problem is that I have a hard enough time conceptualizing 3D space.
I don't know if it's just me having been an old school gamer since Atari 2600 days that when everything started moving into 3D, I had a hard time sometimes conceptualizing 3D space, like levels and things.
And so to be able to run upside down and up walls and stuff is even more confusing to me in trying to figure out how the levels laid out.
But
I mean, it's okay.
The game controls pretty good.
I didn't play multiplayer.
I only played single player.
I did think, to the game's credit, I thought the setup was really good and the drama in the opening parts of the game were done very well and very seamlessly.
And I thought it was kind of cool.
Like, you could really put yourself right in the action.
Doom 3 Prey Improved
In this game, really.
It's just, it's all done within the engine.
I think that's very cool.
So, you know, you can definitely tell how far technology's come when you don't have much of a need for cutscenes anymore.
I remember playing the Prey demo, and all I did was I walked up to the little machine, one of the arcade machines in there, and it was like a Pac-Man demo, and I played that.
Going over to the chat room, looking at some questions there...
Ubuntu Maniac 64 says, Sky would die playing F-Zero, X, and GX then because of all the ramps and upside down.
No, actually, I really, really, really enjoyed F-Zero on the GameCube.
I was a little annoyed with the arcade version because it only had six tracks.
But otherwise, I thought the game was magnificent, and I really wish they'd done more with the arcade.
I think the arcade had four tracks.
You don't have these, like, uh, this, uh, you know, teleportation bullshit, you know, or, um, you know, the...
I'm not totally incompetent when it comes to visualizing 3D.
Give me a little credit.
But I'm telling you, Prey really pushes the envelope.
Yeah, because you go through portals.
Suddenly this box will now be a portal into another place in the level.
And I had no map.
You probably can bring it up easily, but I didn't even figure out how to bring up a map in the demo.
Descent Metroid Prime
For some reason, the little levels, the head-to-head levels are cool, but those big, massive Metroid levels, especially in the first game, it's just too much.
I don't know.
And just the fact that it wasn't Metroid to me.
I mean, I remember Super Metroid, and it's one of the best video games ever made.
Someone was mentioning in the chat room that the Saints Row demo is out on the Xbox magazine.
Oh, really?
I haven't gotten my new issue yet.
I don't remember if I've run out of issues or not.
I can't remember when I subscribed to that.
Call of Duty 2, Quake 4, and Condemned
Well, anyway, as far as Prey goes, I'm going to withhold making a real judgment call on the game until I can play the full version and get a little hands-on multiplayer.
But you know what can I say?
I love the fact that you can download demos for free and judge for yourself if you like the game or not.
So what do you need me to review this game for you?
Go download the demo and see for yourself.
If you like shooters, if you like Doom 3, I think you'll like Prey.
Here's my major bitch on this game.
No split-screen multiplayer.
Now, I understand that's not a big deal for some people that do the LAN parties and stuff like that, but when I'm playing at work or playing at home, you know, and I have some friends over and we want to bust out this game, you know, we can't do that.
You cannot play, you know, split-screen multiplayer on there.
So, that kind of sucks, but, you know, they do have, like I said, the, um...
Jada2006 Pray is a LAN party game.
It's not meant for split-screen multiplayer.
Tough!
I want split-screen multiplayer!
Alright, I will make the decision, I'm glad that they have that mode in there, but I will make the decision whether I want to use it or not, and if I really want to keep, you know, a really tiny-ass little section of the screen for my view, that's fine, you know, but I don't have, you know, four Xbox 360s and four high-def TVs that I can, you know, share with my friends.
Alright, let's keep it moving because we want to get to the news here.
Miklatov, how was your gaming week?
I played World of Warcraft
That was just this weekend.
That's about it.
Yeah, but when you say you played World of Warcraft this weekend, you played all weekend, right?
Yeah, it was Warsong Honor this week, or Double Warsong Honor, so I had to keep playing and playing and playing.
Now, what do you get for racking up a bunch of points in the PvP Warsong Gold?
I don't know.
So why do you keep playing?
I just know I have to do it.
Is it like an internet penis thing?
Like you want to have the big title in front of your name so that you're special, or what?
No, but I like seeing the bar fill up for each little thing I become honored or friendly with.
Okay, serious question, though.
How many hours would you say this weekend alone did you play Warsong Gulch?
Holy crap.
Total, 12.
Wow.
It was really fun, though, because I kept owning people.
Sadly enough, I think I know probably people that are more addicted to World of Warcraft than that.
Yes, I'm not addicted.
I just like to have my little bursts.
I was in Reno randomly yesterday, as I mentioned before, and we were at a restaurant at Circus Circus kind of later in the evening, and this guy was very, very drunk and with his very, very drunk girlfriend and was trying to start a conversation with us.
You know how there's some drunkies that'll do that, like try to start a conversation with strangers?
Yeah, they're stupid.
And there's a right way to start a conversation with strangers, and there's a wrong way to do it.
Like, hey!
Hey!
How you doing, guy?
That's how he sounded, too.
He sounded like Animal from the Muppets.
Hey, guy!
Hey!
and he actually said, I'm a WoW player!
And I'm like, that's great.
You're a WoW, you're retarded.
Yeah, I'm like, me too.
But then he tried to tell me, he's like, yeah man, I like EverQuest on the PlayStation 2, that game's awesome!
And I'm like...
They didn't make EverQuest on the PlayStation 2.
I didn't say this.
Did they really?
They didn't make EverQuest on the PlayStation 2.
Yes, they did.
Did they?
EverQuest Online Adventures.
Yeah, it's one of the games I think they even bundled the hard drive with at one time.
I thought they didn't put EverQuest on PS2.
No, they didn't require the hard drive.
I thought they did.
No.
God, why would you play EverQuest on PS2?
I guess the same reason you play Final Fantasy XI on the PS2, I guess, but...
What?
Why would you play EverQuest on a PlayStation 2?
Because you don't have a good enough computer to run it, and you have to play a watered-down version.
Wow, I never knew that.
Oh, is this EverQuest 2?
Because I was going to say, you can't really water down EverQuest 1.
Yeah, you can.
You can open up Microsoft Paint.
and then just draw things there and it looks almost as good.
Alright, anything else you've been playing this week?
Well, I've been kind of sick and while I was waiting for Warsong Gulch to queue up, I just played a lot of a Wendon and cough on the screen.
It was pretty terrible.
Please tell me that's not my screen.
My DS Lite.
And know what else he played?
You forgot to mention that.
Huh.
in the groove 2 oh yeah I played in the groove 2 oh yeah I forgot we were all at the Arcana I played in the groove 2 too I did not touch in the groove 2 other than to step on the panels which by the way the dance pad used to be a max 2 therefore it is still kosher you know it's like
It's like pre-op, okay?
But it's still DDR, it's just got stickers on it.
I hate In The Groove and all, but they did get a couple really good songs, and the steps were fun for those songs.
I won't touch, like, 98% of that game, but there are, like, three songs that I'll play.
Yeah, and here's the thing is that Miklatov, not only will he play those same three songs over and over, but then he'll, like, stand by the machine and try to get everybody else to play the same damn song.
He's like, play this, play this.
I'm like, no, goddammit, I want to find my own song to play.
But you didn't want to find your own song.
Because you'll pick a crappy trap song.
No, but what I was doing is I was going through all the songs, listening to clips, see if there's anything I wanted to play, and they're really...
Wasn't a whole lot.
But to be fair, I don't know.
To be fair, I didn't know the songs that well.
There's like three songs.
You know what?
But when I did DDR Supernova the first time, I did that too.
I went through the whole thing.
I'm like, I don't really know if I want to play.
I don't know if I want to play.
Play Tierra Buena.
It's the best.
All right, forget it.
Anyway, let's... We did play Cusar and that was awesome.
Cusar.
Sure it was awesome.
Except not.
Let's get into tonight.
Shout out to LaserQuest back in Wichita for being better.
Boo!
LaserQuest sucks.
Can we get into the news tonight, please?
Thank you.
Start off with a little PSP news, but unfortunately this might be a bit of bad news for some of you PSP fans.
Target stores have recently pulled the UMD movies.
GamePro recently got a scoop that UMDs are now being discontinued in all Target stores as of last week.
You know what, though?
Honestly, UMDs, $10 more expensive than a DVD, yet.
and so on.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Oh, so you think maybe it's a matter of Sony might go to this digital distribution thing for movies?
Oh, they want to do digital distribution for everything.
Because they're a little sad that their UMD format didn't take off, which the only thing I did think was pretty good about it is the fact that it's covered in a plastic case and you can't
Thanks for watching!
Whatever.
It's still, though, I think that was a pretty cool idea, just because, you know, it's good for the rental market, but the whole packaging of UMD with, and by the way, these aren't exactly my favorite picks of movies, like, was it Hitch, Triple X, God, and there was, like, Stealth, and something else.
They just won't let Stealth die.
Stealth was a bad movie.
I'm going to our chatroom, OrangeLunchRadio.com, and Maury says, I'm amazed they didn't drop them earlier, referring to the UMDs.
Because they're stubborn.
They want their stuff to work.
You bring up a good point, though, about the digital distribution here.
Everybody kind of is assuming, and it would make logical sense, that Apple, with their video iPods, are going to get into movie distribution by the end of the year.
That'll be the way that they sell iPods this Christmas is that video iPods will come out with a little larger of a screen and they're going to sell movies through the iTunes Music Store.
In fact, it's already somewhat been confirmed because I believe there's been news reports about Apple trying to negotiate with the movie companies and they don't want a flat rate for all the movies they want varying depending on how new the movie is and all that stuff.
So maybe Sony's just trying to beat them to the punch a little bit.
I mean, hypothetically, Sony could set up like a PSP store to download movies on your stick.
And that would be kind of interesting if they could beat Apple to it.
I don't think it would be enough.
You know, you don't think of a lot of people don't think of, you know, a gamer might be different, but the normal average person probably doesn't think of, hey, if I'm going to go listen to music on the go, I'm going to use my PSP.
I think the general public still views the PSP as a gaming system.
Yeah, it basically is a gaming system.
It's a gaming system that can also view movies if I want it.
If I'm tired of playing a game, I can pop in a movie.
But to be honest, I don't want to sit for three hours or two hours in front of my PSP trying to watch a movie.
It's not fun.
And even the Spider-Man 2 UMD that was in there with the PSP, I just don't care.
I think it's lame.
I don't know.
But, whatever.
Speaking of things being pulled, Sony has actually pulled their PSP ad campaign in Netherlands.
You know, the one that's been getting people all pissed off with the fact that it's got black and white people in it.
Oh my god.
And there's got to be something racial about it.
Well, apparently, all the bitching and moaning by the US, which is stupid because they shouldn't have even been getting in the business anyways.
It's a different country.
But, they pulled it anyways.
And,
Thanks for watching!
Go download last week's show, episode 190.
But we invited you guys in our voicemail of the week segment to leave your thoughts on what you thought about the whole controversy behind what was going on.
So I thought we could play a couple voicemails.
Some of you guys left some really good points, but your voicemails were really, really long.
We didn't have quite enough time to play them.
But I enjoyed listening to them, and I will share them with DarkSakura and Loki later on.
But I'm going to play two kind of short feedback ones that I thought were pretty good here in our voicemails of the week.
Here's voicemail number one.
Hey, this is Macman.
And in response to your question, of course Sony isn't racist.
They're just risky.
Remember the 10 years of passion sign or the take a running jump here on the subway sign?
They've done this before, except this time it involved two women of different color trying to kill each other.
Sony got us, but the important part is, Sony got us to talk about the white PSP.
Now, didn't they?
See you on the flip side, Macman.
Catfights
So it's just a good old-fashioned cat fight.
It's a good old-fashioned cat fight.
And to be honest, I think the whole ad campaign was a bit skewed anyways because they did have like 100 different images.
And of course the one where it shows the white person beating up on the black person.
Oh my god, racist!
But you know, when it's the black person beating up on the white person, it's just... Oh my god, LA.
Let's do another.
This is our last voicemail.
It's just a couple short ones this week.
Let's hear this next voicemail.
Hi there, this is Apollo from Nashville, Tennessee.
I'm just giving my thoughts on the whole Sony billboard ad thingamajig.
I just wanted to say that I think since Sony's a worldwide company and they've got their hands all over the world, I think that they're perfectly aware that race is still a very controversial topic in many places, and I kind of think that they should be more cautious to make sure that they're not releasing advertisements that are obvious targets for criticism.
I guess regardless, it did get released, so...
I don't know.
I don't think their message was that white is better than black.
And I don't think that's what they intended to think.
And I don't think they wanted to say that white people are better than black people.
So I think it's kind of ridiculous that people are making a huge deal out of it.
But at the same time, 50 should have been watching for it.
But anyway, that's just all I wanted to say.
Love your guys' show.
And I hope to hear from you soon.
Bye.
Thanks for the voicemail.
It was very nice.
I like how that person says that Sony kind of knew what they were doing.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But it also polarized the community in many different ways.
So, any final thoughts on this issue?
I don't know.
I think the whole issue was stupid to begin with.
But then again, you know, Sony is known for stupid ad campaigns sometimes.
Well, so is Microsoft, though.
I don't know.
I think people that are advertising for video game systems really need to simplify things.
Do what Nintendo does.
I mean, at least theirs, you know, they show...
the games and you know here's what's on the DS Lite check it out you know and then people buy the DS Lite or buy you know whatever except no one bought the GameCube for that I don't know that's that whatever ad campaign they were doing for the GameCube just didn't work alright now if you'd like to leave us a voicemail our phone number is 916-226-9067 but please remember if you don't pay the phone bill please ask whoever does their permission before you call in because that's not an 800 number it's not a toll free call
Or you can always call us on Skype, username OrangeLoungeRadio when we are not live.
That way you get our voicemail.
It was just like the whole Xbox 360 advertising campaign.
Jump in.
It made no sense.
It had nothing to do with the Xbox 360.
It's like, people having fun, Xbox 360.
and like I said before I probably mentioned this before we had a project in our high school economics class to create a product and make a commercial for it advertising the product and my friend he created took a bunch of clips from like different TV shows and showing explosions and stuff and just one big long montage set to music and the very end buy bumper stickers it was great because it it was just something to entertain you but it had nothing to do with the product
I helped my friends in Spanish class my senior year of high school they had to do a commercial but in Spanish so we did a condom commercial and they got an F for doing a condom commercial oh come on that's retarded but I remember because we were all sitting around the bed like we would film we just filmed the product on the bed and everybody was pushing the bed so it was going up and down and they failed but it was really funny and if that was on TV if that was on Univision I think it was funny
Uh, bitch teacher.
Uh, anyway.
I'm sorry.
Um, a voicemail topics for this week.
I want to give you guys a topic for this week.
And it kind of goes into our next story here.
And this is a great blog piece that was on a website called Twitch Guru.
It's actually kind of old.
It's an older piece.
But it was picking up some notoriety on gaming blogs.
I mean, literally, you'd have to go back to September of 2005 to see this piece.
But for some reason, it was getting picked up by a bunch of sites this week.
So that's how it caught our attention.
But you can ask this question.
Any time.
This is kind of a timeless issue, yet it's not.
Are video games getting easier?
Think about it.
Back in the 1980s, you had things like Pac-Man, where it was pretty hard to get far into that game.
I mean, seriously, what's the furthest you've ever gotten Pac-Man?
Or think about Ms.
Pac-Man.
Have you ever gotten past the first two boards?
You know how there's the pink board and there's the blue board?
Have you ever gotten to the red boards or the ones that come later on?
I mean, the old games there were really, really hard.
But games today don't seem to be as challenging.
It seems to be there's more finite, a way to finish them.
You know what's funny, too, is a lot of those older games like Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man they see as approachable games for people, even though they are harder.
That's kind of funny.
So I'm curious, what do you guys think?
Are video games getting easier as time goes on?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, the casual gamer buys the so-called casual games like Pac-Man, Galaga, Frogger, Gauntlet.
Wait, these were all harder games.
What the hell?
I mean, I don't get it.
I think what it is is less complex games, maybe.
They're
Simpler concepts, but harder difficulty.
So, you know, Pac-Man's easy.
You know, gobble dots.
And that's kind of what the Wii's selling point is, right?
Pick up the thing and go.
Yeah, simple games.
You can make a simple game that is really hard.
It's just, you know, don't make it so complex with 52 buttons.
I mean, it's basically, you know, Pac-Man, pick up dots.
and Eat Ghosts.
Pretty simple.
You don't even need to use a button, just a joystick for it.
So, I don't know.
TigerClaw makes an interesting point in our chat room.
Back in the 80s, video games were more about getting high scores so you could enter your initials in the top 5 or 10.
I used to have the top score on a moon patrol machine at the local pizza parlor.
I rock.
Anyway, we're curious about your thoughts on this.
Are video games getting easier or is this just where the market is headed and it's not that the games are getting easier?
I mean, you think about some really hard games that have come out like Ninja Gaiden and things.
Are video games getting easier or is there just the misconception because games used to be a lot simpler?
They weren't as complex.
So we're really curious what you guys' thoughts are on that and we look forward to hearing your voicemails of the week.
We'll play some of our favorites on next week's show.
Awesome.
Well, kind of speaking a little bit about difficulty, one thing that's been difficult is Sony selling the PlayStation 3 to all the gamers out there.
Well, one thing that they did supposedly make, and this was leaked out apparently, was this internal kind of almost like a Q&A for E3, for anybody that's working for Sony to be able to answer press questions about the PlayStation 3.
And I thought it was quite interesting, some of the things on there.
One of the most interesting things on there is they are really stressing the fact that the PlayStation 3 is a computer.
In fact, I think it mentions it about six or seven times in here, saying PlayStation 3 is a computer system.
Then they're also basically saying it's one product with different configurations.
So they're trying to basically say, Sony, we can sell you a PlayStation 3.
It's kind of like Dell.
We can build you a custom system.
One interesting thing, though, about it is they're saying that the noise of the system is supposed to be about the same of a slim PS2, so, you know, pretty quiet.
Also, of course, you know, kind of following up with what they said during E3, that it'll be able to support eight controllers.
They're guessing maybe four wireless, four wired controllers.
Not sure.
And that the specs are pretty close to final.
That was one of the other things.
And that the Blu-ray drive is going to be BD Live compliant.
In other words, you'll be able to connect to the internet using some of the special features on the Blu-ray discs.
Kind of interesting, but I thought it was kind of funny though just how much they were stressing the PlayStation 3 being an actual computer system.
In fact, there were some interesting things on here including right here
PS3 is being positioned as a computer system, not a computer entertainment system.
Like other computer systems, it can be upgraded through the use of readily available industry standard adapters.
They're basically saying any PC USB components you can use with this PlayStation 3.
Another interesting thing on here is they were asking them the difference between Xbox Live and the PlayStation 3 Live.
They kind of dodged the question, which was kind of funny.
But yeah, so it was pretty interesting.
I love this comment in our chat room.
Rini says, if the PlayStation 3 is a computer system, I want to run Word and Photoshop on it.
Well, you know... Why not?
If the PlayStation 3 is such a computer?
Well, they said that you can run Linux on it, and in fact, one of the questions is, will Linux OS be adopted as you have planned?
And it says, yes, PS3 is a computer system, and Linux OS is adopted as one of the standard OSes.
Our chatroom also seems to be running with that story from a couple weeks ago where the controller is supposedly called the Poos.
And now they're calling it... I see DMN made a comment here where he says, HD DVD is greater than Pooray.
And now they're calling it Pooray.
That's cute.
And now even DJ Pooeater changed his name to Pooseater.
Get it?
I...
I still say that story was a piece of poo.
I don't think it's true.
We'll see when it comes out.
I think they probably won't call it the poos.
It'll probably be like some infinity sign, something or other.
Everyone will call it poos.
Seriously, Sony, if you're listening, just change the name.
Just
Call it the PS3 controller.
Really, it works.
Anyway, one other PlayStation 3 thing that kind of left a lot of people with a question mark over their head was this trailer that they showed at E3.
You remember?
It was this trailer, and then there was all these animals that would come out.
Yes, it was Africa was the big title, and the people were like... I mean, you could seriously... I remember we were all sitting at the...
Arena Interactive Lounge, where a lot of the All Games contingent, us and some of our cousin shows that all broadcast on allgames.com were all kind of sitting around and watching the Sony thing and there was just this big collective
Fumitsu Magazine Revealed
Sony Computer Entertainment's Daisaku Ikajiri is involved with the game's development.
Now, Ikajiri has also worked on Hot Shots Golf 3, 4, Portable, and Online.
So, this game may or may not have something in common with Hot Shots Golf.
That's it.
That's the only detail you get.
Africa.
Yeah, that sounds exciting.
One thing I forgot to mention.
However, in light of recent events, I hope Sony really uses some tact when promoting this game.
Yeah, well, one thing I forgot to mention in the last story.
The one question, how the PS3 network service is going to be.
will also start the service at day one.
What are the differences between Xbox Live and the PS3 network services?
I thought I'd just quote exactly what they said here.
Apart from providing basic features and functions, the most important element is content and services, downloading music in SingStar, purchasing or exchanging game data, as we demonstrated at the E3 press conference, and many other new ways of enjoyment, too, will be provided.
Wow, that doesn't say anything.
And also the fact that they're also saying that the PlayStation 3 will be only available in black.
DarkSakura,
DarkSakura.com
Interview here, one of the quotes that they were saying about Kaz, he blatantly said Microsoft is copying Sony.
And, of course, Phil Harrison's remark was, well, quotes can be taken out of contests.
Well, that was the actual sentence, though.
How can you take that out of context?
I mean, that seems pretty clear to me.
But, anyways...
Yeah, he didn't like the fact that they were asking him hard questions, which I thought was pretty funny.
But, you know, you gotta feel sorry for that Phil Harrison guy, because, I mean, I remember when they were first talking about the PlayStation 3 before we knew anything, you know, about the price.
It, you know, he's got to cover up for all these, like, you know, higher-ups that are saying really dumb shit every week, and you gotta feel bad for him.
Whatever.
Whatever.
I think we should just move on to some Xbox news for a little bit here.
And I think this is kind of interesting.
I think we already knew this, but the Xbox has been officially discontinued.
At least that's a rumor going around, but honestly, seeing as I can't seem to find a new Xbox for sale anywhere.
If I remember correctly, the Xbox has been officially discontinued.
I'm not talking about 360, I'm talking about the regular old school Xbox.
But what's...
The other rumor that's kind of interesting to note is that there is a new Xbox 360 Pro bundle being prepared by Microsoft, supposedly, that has Project Gotham Racing 3 included with it, along with a 1,250 Microsoft point card and a three-month subscription to Xbox Live Gold.
and it will run you $399.
But what's not mentioned there is does that include the hard drive?
I'm assuming it does because in order to get on live you've got to have a hard drive.
I guess that's true.
How are you going to spend the points with no hard drive?
We'll see.
Would you lose the cables?
No.
I don't know.
I think what they'll do is they'll probably just put that out.
It's just going to be a bundle.
You won't be able to find the system by itself and then it'll be just coming with that game and stuff instead of the premium bundle or premium system.
SSJ100, Matt makes an interesting observation in chat room.
It's funny that the PlayStation 1 lasted longer in production than the original Xbox.
Well, I don't know.
I hope it doesn't happen because that sucks for us because we have a stockpile of like a thousand units and
Street Fighter 2, Galaga Frogger and Pac-Man
And they're going to be releasing them every Wednesday, starting with, well, last Wednesday when Frogger came out.
Next week you can look forward to cloning Clyde, which will be pretty fun.
And then of course Galaga following on the 26th.
Street Fighter 2 on August 2nd.
Are you sure this time?
Are we sure this time?
This is official press release from Microsoft.
Freaking better be.
Last chance.
And Pac-Man on August 9th.
And I believe shortly after that there'll be some more stuff coming out.
But they're trying to do it every week or so.
They're going to be releasing a new title.
And not very expensive.
They're going to be about $5 to $10.
Street Fighter 2 being $10.
Same with Cloning Clyde.
everything else is $5.
I have this random thought because we were talking earlier about our video games getting easier and we were talking about the retro games.
It does seem like these retro games are really making a comeback slowly but surely with all these retro collections we saw.
The Atari, the Intellivision Lives, the Midway collections and now Xbox Live Arcade sort of getting some new life to the retro games as well.
Is that possibly because people feel that
XBOX Live is finally getting some new stuff, so...
Hopefully even more arcade releases by the end of the year.
Well, not only are there releases in the arcade category, but they're also getting some releases in some of the video and movie categories as well.
In fact, I actually downloaded this this week.
It's Halo 3 in the Beginning was released on Xbox Live this week.
And in Halo 3 in the Beginning, basically what it is, it's a trailer about making the teaser announcement for Halo 3.
A trailer of a trailer.
Yes, it's a trailer about the making of a trailer.
And it's not even like the real trailer, it's the teaser trailer.
And so in a way I'm kind of going, this is just like the biggest self-ego inflation piece I've ever seen on a video game console.
But, I don't know, at the same time, I downloaded it because it's free, and I'm like, oh, this is pretty, and it's HD, and I'll watch anything in HD because it's pretty, especially when it has to do with gaming.
But I did find it was fascinating, I mean, all the freaking work that went into making just that, you know...
I don't know if I'd spend the $4,000 on the plasma screen for it, but if I had a 70-inch plasma screen, you know, a next-gen...
Video device would look pretty nice on it.
But you can actually see some of the details, like the little individual hairs on a flower and stuff like that.
Just an insane amount of detail.
All right, well, someone just joined us who wants to comment on all this.
Actually, hi, everybody.
Hi, DarkSakura!
I am literally just off the road.
Actually, I had a conversation with DMN when I did my Tuesday show.
He mentioned that basically the HD DVD was blowing away Blu-ray for quality.
I think they're about neck and neck, if I remember correctly.
But even still, I was asking about the 1080p plasma screens out there, and they didn't have too many at the store.
I mean, they carried a lot of stuff.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Don't I always?
At least she admits it.
Amazingly enough, all the bad drivers were male.
Okay, okay.
Especially the one who was tailgating the person in front of him, skidded off the side of the road, and blew a rock into my windshield.
Oh, I forgot we had somebody else on your mic, so I want to make sure we're not blowing the audience away there.
Sorry about that.
With the awesomeness of my voice.
Sorry about that.
Yeah.
Anyway, well, how was your gaming week?
You want to get that out?
Sure.
My gaming week actually was a lot of Animal Crossing and a lot of pinball.
A lot of pinball.
I played so much pinball last weekend.
Was it just that show that you called us from last week?
Well, that and playing pinball in my garage.
Did you end up buying any new machines?
We did not, and actually we lost out on the Black Knight 2000 we were going to get because we went back to check on it and it had been sold to somebody else for $600!
Can you believe it?
Yikes.
But we are working on a World Cup Soccer 94, which is actually one of my favorite machines for nostalgia value.
And...
We actually, two of our triggers on our last action hero broke, so we have to replace that before we can keep playing it.
But Dan got our roulette working on our whodunit pinball, so that's awesome.
It now completely works.
All right.
Sounds fun.
And I play a lot of eyeball crossing.
I got a note that our chat room here is just, they're celebrating that you're back.
DMN says, nice of you to show up, DarkSakura.
Hey!
No, I think you meant that in a good way, though.
Oh, hi.
And let's see, what else?
Mori says, yay, DarkSakura's around again.
Life is fun.
Life is always fun with me here.
I have a party every day.
And then somebody referred to, oh, Dark Knight said, DarkSakura is the queen of the show.
All hail the OLR queen.
And then DMN followed that up with, I thought Skye was the queen of the show.
Screw you.
Anyways.
Only on special occasions.
Okay, well anyways, back to the new stuff.
One of the things that actually happened this week was EA's Summer Showcase.
And that's basically kind of like their little press event that they have showcasing their brand new titles that are going to be coming out.
And the top of the showcase, of course, the next-gen version of Half-Life 2, which is going to be on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
So that's pretty interesting that that's been confirmed and not too much of a surprise since, you know, it's going to be...
Oh god, I can't remember.
But anyways, yeah, lots of good stuff.
Team Fortress 2, that's what it was.
So, pretty cool.
Alright, for those of you guys listening live here on this Sunday evening, we all got booted from chat because we had too many of us trying to hit the chatroom at once.
All four of us here in the room, we're all in the chatroom.
And we got booted from the server, so it's probably going to be a few more minutes before we get back in.
So, apologize for that, you guys, and we'll work on that at least throughout the break.
Meanwhile, we've just got to keep it running here, so I'm going to go to the next story here.
Every Xtend Extra has a demo that's been released, and it's only for the PC.
So even though this game is going to be coming out for the PSP, you can only get the demo on your PC.
That's stupid.
Well, here's the thing, though, is that every Xtend was actually a PC game way back in the day, so I'm assuming that every Xtend Extra is also coming out for the PC.
Well, why don't they do another PSP demo, because I know that they had what...
LocoRoco, and, you know, there was some, well, in Japan there was, like, some Sudoku demo and stuff like that, but that's about it.
I mean, this brand new feature that they add to the PSP and they do nothing with, excellent use of the PSP.
Because, you know, no one really wants demos to download off the internet, of course, because, you know, Xbox Live's Marketplace, demos, just, no one ever downloads those.
and especially with the PSP needing people to buy some of this software out there because there hasn't really been that many great games lately.
I don't know.
Just hear me rant some more.
All right.
Well, let's go to another story here.
This is something that our music game fans... I'm kind of mad that we're booted from chat right now because I really would love to get reaction to this.
But anyway...
Konami has filed a patent for the title Guitar Revolution.
Now, what's interesting about this is that a lot of people are saying, oh, well, this means that Konami is planning to compete with Guitar Hero.
They're going to go directly head-to-head with Guitar Hero.
And a lot of people seem to be neglecting the fact that Konami had a game, Guitar Game Out, in Japan for quite some time.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Here in the US for quite some time.
But now they've gone and trademarked the name Guitar Revolution.
So that would indicate if they are planning to revive the franchise here in the US, they're going to change the name of it to fit DDR, you know, Dance Dance Revolution and Karaoke Revolution and all that good stuff.
Of course, just because they patented the name doesn't mean that they are going to make it.
I mean, they could just be
It could be a concept thing at this time.
They just don't want anyone else to jump in on it.
But, I don't know, it kind of looks like they could be prepping for a new game.
What do you think, Loki?
Probably.
I mean, it makes sense, especially with the success of Guitar Hero.
I mean, it would be something that they would probably want to do.
I don't know.
I think the whole problem before is they didn't know how to market Guitar Freaks to the people.
And now that they've seen how it's basically been done, they can kind of go from there.
So yeah.
So I have to ask Miklatov if we can get him a mic real quick.
He had to move a little bit there.
How you doing?
I'm good.
I know you can't really talk a whole lot about this because you work at Konami or whatever, but surely you must have some thoughts on the reaction out there that people are having to this?
I totally do.
First of all, I'd like to say that my opinions do not reflect Konami's opinions, just a lot of people that work there.
Or our opinion.
Yeah, whoever.
It's my opinion and that's what I'm sticking to.
Okay.
So, when this Guitar Revolution stuff came out, a wonderfully crappy site named 1up.com decided that one of their idiots would write about it.
And his name is Jared Rhea, just so everybody knows.
He also goes by Slip, I think?
I don't know.
I don't pay attention to him.
But...
What he did in his little blog post is pretty much say how our company actually works internally, which he doesn't know, because he doesn't work there.
So that's pretty libelous.
And he also decided to bash on the DDR team that's in America, saying that we care more about what songs we get in the game.
rather than the quality, which is not true because we can't do anything about quality or songs.
So, he's a moron.
And then, apparently really recently, maybe today, I don't know how to read dates, he talks about how he and one of my co-workers are pretty... I'll read, read, read, read, read.
That he's taking credit for being a catalyst...
to the DDR revolution sort of thing in America, and that he's one of the people that is behind the scenes making everyone move their feet, to quote his blog post.
Well, he's not.
He never worked at Konami.
All he is is this whiny little punk that worked at 1up.com.
He no longer does, it looks like.
And I pretty much hate his guts.
And he's an idiot.
I could say a whole lot more, but it would involve a lot of cussing, and since I don't do that, I can't say any more.
Let me try to go back to the topic at hand, because I'm trying to not go there.
I'll go there.
I know you will.
I'm trying to think.
Okay.
What is the public, you have these people that are very vocal about, especially I noticed within the Groove fans, I'm not talking about this blogger, but like in the Groove fans have this huge misconception about the way DDR is made in America.
What are the biggest misconceptions people have of Konami in general and the way that they're making their games, if there's anything you can say on that?
I don't think there's anything I can actually say about that.
All right, well, I think... I was going to beat him up.
I think Miklatov got us started on a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio called the FUs of the Week.
DarkSakura
I'd like to say a big F you, and not really a problem I have anymore, to my old couch.
It sucked, and it's gone.
Dump that piece of shit in the landfill.
I have a nice new couch now.
Alright.
Nikolatov, do you have anything additional?
I'd like to say an F you to 1up.com for being a terrible, terrible site.
and for hiring people that have no skill.
I'd also like to clarify that views and... Yeah, like all views and opinions of our guests do not reflect those of the rest of us, but... Okay.
Let's see.
I'm not done.
Okay, what else?
F you to Lopedis Golf Land because they put all their dancing games right next to each other, so now...
If I want to go play Pump, I have to weed through the Supernova people and the Groove people, which are taking up way too much space for me.
Oh yeah, I saw a Pump Zero machine in Reno yesterday.
It's really fun.
I didn't play it.
What do I want to give an FU to this week?
Oh, I'll give an FU to Reno for robbing me of $40 from their slot machines.
I thought Reno was supposed to have better slot machines than the Indian casinos we have here, but I suppose not.
FU to those one-armed bandits taking money from me.
They're supposed to give me money.
That's not fair.
All right, let's get back into some news here.
And again, we are still locked out of the chat room.
There's not a lot we can do.
We're just kind of going to try and keep getting back in there.
And we'll be hopefully back soon.
So meanwhile.
Yes, excellent.
But meanwhile, I'd like to talk to you guys.
about Take-Two and how they just constantly like to get in the trouble.
Well, this time, they're in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
And this, luckily, has nothing to do with the whole hot coffee thing.
But it actually has to do with the stock option grants that are made by the company from 1997 to the present.
And basically, they're just
They're not having a good day.
And they really need another Grand Theft Auto to come out.
And they better not fuck up the network gameplay on Vice City Stories or I will be pissed.
I will fly my ass down there and beat the crap out of them personally.
I hate those network programmers.
God damn it, they were so lazy.
Anyways, moving on.
Speaking of programming, Hellgate London, the source code has been stolen and leaked to the internet.
Kind of like some other games out there, but apparently someone on the inside stole the... I remember seeing this at E3, the Hellgate London game, but didn't really play it.
I don't know.
Interesting.
But yeah, Hacker Strike again.
Yay.
Alright.
Um...
Going to another story here, speaking of kind of London-ish.
It's about the UK.
It's about the government in the UK.
The British government is actually going to be organizing a census to track the game industry's growth.
The survey is being administered by Skill Set, and this is an entertainment research group.
And what they're going to do is they're going to gather data, and this could actually influence decisions made by the parliament later on.
There's a quote from the creative director of Eidos Interactive saying,
The census is a headcount of the industry.
It helps Skill Set influence government, policymakers, and public funds for the benefit and support of the industry.
And the Skill Set will be going out to company managing directors and human resource departments.
And you can also, if you happen to be one of these people, you can do it online.
It's available on the Skill Set website.
It's skillset.org slash research slash census.
And they'll start the result calculating on July 12th.
So...
