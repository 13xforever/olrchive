00:00.000 --> 00:20.800
Tonight, July 16th, 2006, Target pulls UMDs from shelves, new rumors are floating around

00:20.800 --> 00:29.840
about the Wii controller, and is Konami planning to directly compete with Guitar Hero?

00:29.840 --> 00:36.600
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.600 --> 00:43.500
This is episode number 191 for this July the 16th of 2006, but if you can't listen live

00:43.500 --> 00:47.920
to us on Sunday nights, which we're back on recording Sunday nights after a two-week little

00:47.920 --> 00:52.200
displacement there, you can always download our podcast at orangeloungeradio.com, which

00:52.200 --> 00:57.560
is released in two sections, part A on Monday-ish and part B on Wednesday-ish.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.560
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.560
You might know me as Sky.

00:59.560 --> 01:07.580
as always say hello to Loki yes I'm here yes he's here Dark Sakura is coming

01:07.580 --> 01:12.400
she's just running late tonight she was in the Bay Area this weekend doing

01:12.400 --> 01:15.380
something and she's running a little late but she says she will be here in

01:15.380 --> 01:18.900
time for part B and she might even make it to the show depending on how long we

01:18.900 --> 01:22.420
run during part a I told her whenever she gets here just barge on in and say

01:22.420 --> 01:25.540
hello so we'll be looking forward to hearing from her very sure you didn't

01:25.540 --> 01:31.380
to tell her to do that she'll just kick the door down i'm here uh anyway we'll see the traffic was

01:31.380 --> 01:35.380
horrible okay yeah what do you want to bet when she gets here there's going to be some type of

01:35.380 --> 01:39.220
rant about the traffic but i already know there was an accident she told me she told me part of

01:39.220 --> 01:43.140
the reason she wasn't here is that there's an accident that on one of the highways that kept

01:43.140 --> 01:47.540
her excellent she'll be bright and cheery all right bright good we'll try to we'll try to time

01:47.540 --> 01:51.940
the fus of the week in time for her arrival but i don't know we gotta we gotta plan we gotta stick

01:51.940 --> 01:55.940
Anyway, we do have the one and only Miklotov filling in again.

01:55.940 --> 01:57.940
You never leave.

01:57.940 --> 01:58.940
I try not to.

01:58.940 --> 02:01.940
Alright, but Miklotov has something very important he's going to say tonight.

02:01.940 --> 02:03.940
It's somewhat.

02:03.940 --> 02:04.940
It's probably about women.

02:04.940 --> 02:07.940
Alright, anyway.

02:07.940 --> 02:10.940
Yeah, actually when DarkSakura gets here, maybe her and Miklotov will have a fight.

02:10.940 --> 02:13.940
That would be pretty cool. Maybe there will be hair pulling and all that good stuff.

02:13.940 --> 02:17.940
Alright, anyway, we do like to talk about video games here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:17.940 --> 02:22.660
Radio, and we like to start it off always by talking about our gaming week.

02:22.660 --> 02:25.860
So, Loki, why don't you go ahead and start us off tonight with how was your gaming week?

02:25.860 --> 02:33.820
It was okay, I got two new games, got of course ChromeHounds and Prey, and I haven't played

02:33.820 --> 02:38.760
much of Prey, I've played a little bit of ChromeHounds, basically you have to go through

02:38.760 --> 02:44.100
all the training missions, as you would call them, and they have it split up into like

02:44.100 --> 02:49.020
six different sections for each type of class you want to do.

02:49.020 --> 02:52.940
And you unlock parts that way because basically if you want to build a mech you got to play

02:52.940 --> 02:57.400
through the whole single player game in order to get some good parts.

02:57.400 --> 03:03.300
And so I've been playing that and playing a lot of Ridge Racer.

03:03.300 --> 03:08.840
I'm kind of done with that game because when you finish the races and you have a harder

03:08.840 --> 03:12.260
set of races then you have an even harder set of races and it just keeps going and going

03:12.260 --> 03:13.260
and going.

03:13.260 --> 03:16.800
like that with the the PSP version I played it up through like the pro

03:16.800 --> 03:22.200
section that's like I'm done this game it's all the same damn shit all over and

03:22.200 --> 03:26.840
over again and Ridge Racer 6 is no different and that's another reason why

03:26.840 --> 03:30.600
I will not be buying Ridge Racer 2 when that comes out for the PSP it's just

03:30.600 --> 03:33.760
gonna be same damn shit all over again. That's so weird to me that you already

03:33.760 --> 03:37.160
have Ridge Racer 6 yet they're gonna go back and do Ridge Racer 2 I know it's

03:37.160 --> 03:41.240
like different. It's Ridge Racer PSP 2. I know it's different but it's still just kind of

03:41.240 --> 03:43.140
of weird when you talk about it.

03:43.140 --> 03:47.620
Well, the thing that sucks about it though is that they have all the same tracks.

03:47.620 --> 03:54.040
Like the PSP one had a lot of the tracks from all Ridge Racer 5 and back, and so I had played

03:54.040 --> 04:00.960
a lot of them in Ridge Racer 4 because R4 was awesome, but I'm like, oh yeah, I remember

04:00.960 --> 04:04.680
this track, so you know how to race it already, and the drifting is just completely wrong

04:04.680 --> 04:05.680
anyways.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.560
And I played...

04:07.560 --> 04:08.560
I'm done with the game.

04:08.560 --> 04:14.920
just need to sell it before it drops price again and just get rid of it so I can buy

04:14.920 --> 04:26.600
more games in August. The other game I played was Xor, and basically this is a Japanese

04:26.600 --> 04:31.840
only Xbox 360 game but doing a nifty little region trick you can download a demo that's

04:31.840 --> 04:37.640
on the live marketplace right now. It's an interesting game, reminds me a bit of Zone

04:37.640 --> 04:41.440
of vendors just the way the combat system is. It is kind of neat though because you

04:41.440 --> 04:46.440
use the right analog to kind of switch targets to which one you want to fire against. And

04:46.440 --> 04:50.880
then basically you have your normal shot and charged shots and then this kind of like special

04:50.880 --> 04:57.880
attack which is just more charged shots. It's neat. I wouldn't buy it but it's kind of neat.

04:58.960 --> 05:05.680
Play a little bit of Frogger and what can I say Frogger is Frogger. And yeah I think

05:05.680 --> 05:09.340
that was I'm still playing through blazing angels you know the games now

05:09.340 --> 05:13.620
to the point where I just want to be over I love how every week you come like

05:13.620 --> 05:16.380
for the past four or five weeks and I've come on the show I've been playing

05:16.380 --> 05:21.220
blazing angels this week I hate it yet it's been like the past five weeks you

05:21.220 --> 05:25.460
haven't stopped playing it I have to play the game throw away the last

05:25.460 --> 05:29.500
achievement man last achievement true points horror true points horror well I

05:29.500 --> 05:34.380
have to and the fact that they make these different modes like arcade mode

05:34.380 --> 05:37.940
mode, and the mini campaign mode, and the campaign mode, they're all the same, all the

05:37.940 --> 05:38.940
same.

05:38.940 --> 05:42.660
The only difference between the arcade mode and like say the mini campaign mode, mini

05:42.660 --> 05:46.620
campaign mode, you fight 20 planes, that's it.

05:46.620 --> 05:52.880
In the arcade mode you fight 3 waves of 12 planes, and that's give or take because it's

05:52.880 --> 05:56.600
really been kind of glitchy, like I'll shoot the first 4 planes in a wave or something

05:56.600 --> 06:02.580
really quick, and the second wave will start, yet for some reason more planes will come,

06:02.580 --> 06:05.900
And those planes don't count towards my, you know, amount because they're still the same

06:05.900 --> 06:08.140
planes from the first wave.

06:08.140 --> 06:09.540
It gets confused sometimes.

06:09.540 --> 06:13.740
I also need to introduce our other guests we always have every week here on the program,

06:13.740 --> 06:17.900
our chat room over at orangeloungeradio.com, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat if

06:17.900 --> 06:22.560
you are listening live on Sunday, come on over and join in the fun and we read your

06:22.560 --> 06:24.220
comments throughout the show.

06:24.220 --> 06:28.120
In fact, Eddie was responding in our chat room to something Loki was saying earlier

06:28.120 --> 06:31.580
when he was making fun of Jamie for always bitching about traffic, saying that, Loki

06:31.580 --> 06:36.760
rants about traffic too so you know that's that's true I do remember your

06:36.760 --> 06:40.100
past few I've used the week have been about traffic so I think you just got

06:40.100 --> 06:45.260
pwned okay let's see oh here we go you will bow to me once know exactly how

06:45.260 --> 06:47.820
many achievement points do you have these a lot we always call you an

06:47.820 --> 06:51.440
achievement points horror but you really don't have that many I don't I some

06:51.440 --> 06:54.660
people I just don't have enough time to play stuff but I don't you break like

06:54.660 --> 06:59.620
3,000 yeah okay but that's a lot I only have like 12 it's mainly well it's

06:59.620 --> 07:03.760
mainly I'm just trying to like, what I try to do is I sit down with a game that you know

07:03.760 --> 07:10.760
I want to get rid of like you know Ridge Racer or, what was it, Blazing Angels and I just

07:10.760 --> 07:14.060
play it and play it and play it and play it until I finally get all the achievement points

07:14.060 --> 07:20.520
and then I go and sell it. And my game after Ridge Racer and Blazing Angels, the next one

07:20.520 --> 07:26.500
is going to be Rumble Roses XX because that game was lame. Luckily though, Blazing Angels

07:26.500 --> 07:29.780
and Rumpelroses I did not pay for. I got those free

07:29.780 --> 07:34.260
from Konami and Ubisoft. Yeah, they were really

07:34.260 --> 07:36.900
thankful to give those away but

07:36.900 --> 07:41.020
Ridge Racer did spend money on and to be honest, you know, Ridge Racer is fun.

07:41.020 --> 07:44.860
It's fun but it was okay. I think there's better racers on

07:44.860 --> 07:49.580
360 right now but I had fun with it. It's a fun game. As a more traditional racer that's not

07:49.580 --> 07:53.080
like blow shit up it's pretty good. I would like to see the next burnout

07:53.080 --> 07:56.340
you know something that's made from scratch and not a port

07:56.340 --> 08:00.660
I think that'd be better. Or maybe, I don't know, this is a good arcade racing game

08:00.660 --> 08:04.220
is what we need out there. Alright, anything else you've been playing this week?

08:04.220 --> 08:07.820
I think that's it. Uh, Grand Theft Auto, of course. Always.

08:07.820 --> 08:12.180
Um, my gaming week was, well I've been doing a little bit traveling again, so

08:12.180 --> 08:16.260
you know, I was in LA the first part of the week and I was in

08:16.260 --> 08:20.060
um, hello, Reno yesterday, thank you.

08:20.060 --> 08:23.540
Been a long week, what can I say, but I have had a little bit of time in there to play some other games.

08:23.540 --> 08:28.520
I checked out Frogger on Xbox Live Arcade, I mean, hell, it was five bucks and I wanted

08:28.520 --> 08:31.380
something new, so I was kind of a sucker, I got it.

08:31.380 --> 08:34.020
And it was actually a lot better than I expected.

08:34.020 --> 08:39.440
I was expecting it to just be a straight arcade port with not a lot of extra frills, but I

08:39.440 --> 08:43.660
think it's kind of cool that they have some extra stuff, like they did enhance the graphics

08:43.660 --> 08:46.740
for whatever it's worth, I mean, it's nothing to scream about.

08:46.740 --> 08:53.220
It looks like they enhanced it from the Atari 2600 style graphics that it used to be, well

08:53.220 --> 08:56.660
Well actually, I'll give it more of a credit, more like NES style graphics, they souped

08:56.660 --> 09:03.300
it up to like, Super NES style graphics, so it's still not that great, but you know, it's

09:03.300 --> 09:05.300
alright.

09:05.300 --> 09:09.740
But the game, you know, it's amazingly simple and will entertain you for a little bit.

09:09.740 --> 09:13.820
I do like the fact they have co-op modes in there and some other multiplayer modes, except

09:13.820 --> 09:18.020
I only played one co-op game, but it was laggy as hell.

09:18.020 --> 09:22.300
I mean, it was to the point where, you know, you would press the button to hop and it would

09:22.300 --> 09:25.940
take a minute before the guy would actually hop and in Frogger you know

09:25.940 --> 09:28.900
timing is a lot so that would really screw you up

09:28.900 --> 09:33.220
I don't understand since in co-op you're not really going head to head it's like

09:33.220 --> 09:34.180
both people

09:34.180 --> 09:37.260
are playing on opposite sides working to one score

09:37.260 --> 09:41.100
I don't see why they just couldn't have it running and then the other side kinda

09:41.100 --> 09:41.940
catches up

09:41.940 --> 09:45.300
I don't know I just would have done it differently maybe I maybe I miss

09:45.300 --> 09:46.660
something I don't know but

09:46.660 --> 09:50.380
it did to be honest that's not that great a co-op

09:50.380 --> 09:53.120
I mean it's just two people playing at the same time working towards one score, you're

09:53.120 --> 09:55.480
not even playing on the same playing field.

09:55.480 --> 10:00.960
It's opposite play fields and it just splits the screen in two, so it's kind of weird.

10:00.960 --> 10:05.560
So I guess, you know, for five bucks though, you know, you can't expect a lot and to be

10:05.560 --> 10:10.280
honest it's better than the cell phone version which I think runs just as much, so why not

10:10.280 --> 10:14.000
go and get this if you are interested in all and some retro-ness there.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
It's cheap five dollars.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.060
The other game I played, I checked out the Prey demo on Xbox Live Arcade, of course there

10:21.060 --> 10:25.320
was a lot of this talk about, oh the demo was delayed and dah dah dah, I wasn't really

10:25.320 --> 10:29.080
following all that because this wasn't a game I was super excited about because I don't

10:29.080 --> 10:33.000
really get into first person shooter games a whole lot.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.220
But Prey was kind of neat.

10:35.220 --> 10:40.820
I think I liked it as well when it was called Doom 3, no I'm kidding, it's definitely on

10:40.820 --> 10:41.820
a...

10:41.820 --> 10:44.340
More like I liked it better when it was called Duke Nukem 3.

10:44.340 --> 10:48.580
This is very obvious so there's a lot in common with the Doom 3 interface, and to be honest

10:48.580 --> 10:52.460
I haven't done my research on the game, I'm not sure if they use the Doom 3 interface.

10:52.460 --> 10:55.140
That's not a surprise at all, honestly, I can tell.

10:55.140 --> 10:59.900
You instead of having a flashlight, you have a lighter.

10:59.900 --> 11:04.900
But you do have the gravity stuff, which is kind of cool, like you can walk up these ramps

11:04.900 --> 11:06.660
and go upside down and stuff.

11:06.660 --> 11:11.980
But the problem is that I have a hard enough time conceptualizing 3D space.

11:11.980 --> 11:17.260
I don't know if it's just me having been an old school gamer since Atari 2600 days that

11:17.260 --> 11:21.780
when everything started moving into 3D I had a hard time sometimes conceptualizing 3D space

11:21.780 --> 11:27.480
like levels and things and so to be able to run upside down and up walls and stuff is

11:27.480 --> 11:31.960
even more confusing to me and trying to figure out how the levels laid out but I mean it's

11:31.960 --> 11:35.020
okay the game control is pretty good I didn't play multiplayer I only played single player

11:35.020 --> 11:40.420
I did think to the game's credit I thought the setup was really good and the drama in

11:40.420 --> 11:44.980
the opening parts of the game were done very well and very seamlessly and I

11:44.980 --> 11:48.380
thought it was kind of cool like you could really put yourself right in the

11:48.380 --> 11:52.620
action but yet it's a first-person shooter now granted Doom 3 did the same

11:52.620 --> 11:57.620
thing kind of at the beginning but I think Prey kind of improved on that so I

11:57.620 --> 12:02.560
like this I wish I could have gotten far enough into the demo where I are into

12:02.560 --> 12:05.900
the game really from the demo or I could see more of the story and how it plays

12:05.900 --> 12:11.620
out but I do really like that you don't have cutscenes in this game really it's

12:11.620 --> 12:15.980
just it's all done within the engine I think that's very cool so you know you

12:15.980 --> 12:18.620
can definitely tell how far technologies come when you when you don't have much

12:18.620 --> 12:22.780
of a need for cutscenes anymore I remember playing pre-demo and all I did

12:22.780 --> 12:27.220
was I walked up to the little machine one of the arcade machines in there and

12:27.220 --> 12:31.580
it was like a pac-man demo and I played that going over to the chat room looking

12:31.580 --> 12:34.780
at some questions there.

12:34.780 --> 12:41.020
Ubuntu Maniac 64 says, Sky would die playing F-Zero X and GX then because of all the ramps

12:41.020 --> 12:42.020
and upside down.

12:42.020 --> 12:45.780
No, actually, I really, really, really enjoyed F-Zero on the GameCube.

12:45.780 --> 12:49.260
I was a little annoyed with the arcade version because it only had six tracks.

12:49.260 --> 12:53.560
But otherwise, I thought the game was magnificent and I wish they'd done more with the arcade.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.800
I think the arcade and home link-up was six.

12:56.800 --> 13:00.680
The arcade and home link-up was a brilliant idea and it needed to be expanded on.

13:00.680 --> 13:04.840
No, actually in a racing game it doesn't bother me so much, I mean, granted you go upside

13:04.840 --> 13:10.440
down in ramps, but there's still really only one path or branching paths in a racing game,

13:10.440 --> 13:11.440
you know, it's not that complicated.

13:11.440 --> 13:17.800
You don't have these, like, this, you know, teleportation bullshit, you know, or, you

13:17.800 --> 13:18.800
know, the...

13:18.800 --> 13:19.800
I'm not...

13:19.800 --> 13:20.800
Yeah.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.800
I'm not...

13:21.800 --> 13:24.520
Yeah, I'm not totally incompetent when it comes to, you know, visualizing 3D, okay,

13:24.520 --> 13:28.120
give me a little credit, but I'm telling you Prey really pushes the envelope, yeah, because

13:28.120 --> 13:32.700
you go through portals, like suddenly this box will now be a portal into another place

13:32.700 --> 13:36.760
in the level and it's like, okay I'm going across, and I have no map, I don't, you probably

13:36.760 --> 13:40.340
can bring it up easily but I didn't even figure out how to bring up a map in the demo, and

13:40.340 --> 13:44.640
usually, and somebody else had commented, have I ever played Descent, it looks like

13:44.640 --> 13:47.880
23Magus was asking have I ever played Descent, actually yes, and I actually really enjoyed

13:47.880 --> 13:51.940
Descent, but Descent also had a map button that I would press like every five seconds

13:51.940 --> 13:54.100
to see where I am, that's why I like games with Minnie Mouse.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.140
Hated Descent, hated that game.

13:56.140 --> 14:00.780
I actually kind of enjoyed Descent, but see you know what 3D game really just was Metroid

14:00.780 --> 14:04.140
and a lot of people really into Metroid Prime

14:04.140 --> 14:07.500
and for some reason the little levels, the head to head levels are cool but like

14:07.500 --> 14:10.060
those big massive Metroid levels

14:10.060 --> 14:13.180
especially in the first it's just too much

14:13.180 --> 14:14.000
I don't know

14:14.000 --> 14:17.100
and just the fact that it wasn't Metroid to me I mean I

14:17.100 --> 14:20.520
remember Super Metroid and it's one of the best video games ever made

14:20.520 --> 14:25.720
So I was mentioning in the chatroom that the Saints Row demo is out on the Xbox magazine.

14:25.720 --> 14:26.720
Oh really?

14:26.720 --> 14:28.080
I haven't got my new issue yet.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.040
I don't remember if I've run out of issues or not.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.560
I can't remember when I subscribed to that.

14:31.560 --> 14:35.560
But I know the last few demo discs that they've had on there have been crap.

14:35.560 --> 14:39.720
It's been just like, you know, demos that have been on live forever.

14:39.720 --> 14:45.620
Like I think one of the months was Call of Duty 2, Quake 4, and Condemned or something

14:45.620 --> 14:46.620
like that.

14:46.620 --> 14:49.460
Wow, these were awesome back in November.

14:49.460 --> 14:55.780
Well anyway, as far as Prey goes, I'm going to withhold making a real judgement call on

14:55.780 --> 14:59.300
the game until I can play the full version and get a little hands-on multiplayer, but

14:59.300 --> 15:03.580
you know what can I say, I love the fact that you can download demos for free and judge

15:03.580 --> 15:05.460
for yourself if you like the game or not.

15:05.460 --> 15:07.580
So what do you need me to review this game for you for?

15:07.580 --> 15:09.580
Go download the demo and see for yourself.

15:09.580 --> 15:12.380
If you like shooters, if you like Doom 3, I think you'll like Prey.

15:12.380 --> 15:14.620
Here's my major bitch on this game.

15:14.620 --> 15:16.260
No split-screen multiplayer.

15:16.260 --> 15:20.280
Now I understand that's not a big deal for some people that do the LAN parties and stuff

15:20.280 --> 15:25.220
like that, but when I'm playing at work, or playing at home, and I have some friends over

15:25.220 --> 15:28.820
and we want to bust out this game, we can't do that.

15:28.820 --> 15:32.160
You cannot play split screen multiplayer on there.

15:32.160 --> 15:40.020
So that kind of sucks, but they do have, like I said, the link mode and they also have over

15:40.020 --> 15:41.020
live.

15:41.020 --> 15:44.740
I don't know, that's why I like Call of Duty 2, because you can split up 4 screens.

15:44.740 --> 15:47.140
You know, yeah, the screens may be small, but so what?

15:47.140 --> 15:51.900
It's still fun, and I'd rather have that, but yeah, it wouldn't be able to work.

15:51.900 --> 15:55.060
Jaded2006 in our chat says, Pray is a LAN party game.

15:55.060 --> 15:57.060
It's not meant for split screen multiplayer.

15:57.060 --> 15:58.060
Tough!

15:58.060 --> 15:59.540
I want split screen multiplayer!

15:59.540 --> 16:04.180
Alright, I will make the decision, I'm glad that they have that mode in there, but I will

16:04.180 --> 16:06.460
make the decision whether I want to use it or not.

16:06.460 --> 16:11.180
If I really want to keep, you know, a really tiny ass little section of the screen for

16:11.180 --> 16:17.840
my view, that's fine, you know, but I don't have, you know, four Xbox 360s and four high

16:17.840 --> 16:20.340
def TVs that I can, you know, share with my friends.

16:20.340 --> 16:23.020
Alright, let's keep it moving, because we want to get to the news here.

16:23.020 --> 16:25.460
Miklotov, how was your gaming week?

16:25.460 --> 16:29.900
I played World of Warcraft, and that was just this weekend.

16:29.900 --> 16:30.900
That's about it.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.180
Yeah, but when you say you played World of Warcraft this weekend, you played all weekend,

16:34.180 --> 16:35.180
right?

16:35.180 --> 16:39.820
Yeah, I played, it was Warsong Honor this week, so, or Double Warsong Honor, so I had

16:39.820 --> 16:43.980
keep playing and playing and playing now what do you get for racking up a bunch

16:43.980 --> 16:47.980
of points in the pvp war song goal i don't know

16:47.980 --> 16:51.740
i just want to keep playing i just know i have to do it is it like an internet

16:51.740 --> 16:54.620
penis thing like you want to have the big title in front of your names that

16:54.620 --> 16:58.620
you're special or what no but i like seeing the bar fill up for

16:58.620 --> 17:02.300
each little um thing i become honored or friendly

17:02.300 --> 17:04.940
with okay serious question though how many hours would you say this weekend

17:04.940 --> 17:09.740
alone did you play war song gold holy crap um

17:09.740 --> 17:13.140
total 12 wow

17:13.140 --> 17:17.300
it was really fun though because I kept owning people

17:17.300 --> 17:20.780
sadly enough I think I know probably people that are more addicted to World

17:20.780 --> 17:21.780
Warcraft than that

17:21.780 --> 17:25.100
I'm not addicted, I just like to have my little bursts

17:25.100 --> 17:28.660
I was in Reno randomly yesterday as I mentioned before and

17:28.660 --> 17:32.620
we were at a restaurant at Circus Circus kinda later in the evening

17:32.620 --> 17:36.600
and this guy was very very drunk and with his very very drunk girlfriend was

17:36.600 --> 17:38.820
trying to start a conversation with us you know how like there's some drunkies

17:38.820 --> 17:41.040
that'll do that, like try to start a conversation with strangers.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.040
Yeah they're stupid.

17:42.040 --> 17:45.320
And there's a right way to start a conversation with strangers, and there's a wrong way to

17:45.320 --> 17:46.320
do it like,

17:46.320 --> 17:47.320
Hey!

17:47.320 --> 17:48.320
Hey!

17:48.320 --> 17:49.320
How ya doin' dude?

17:49.320 --> 17:50.320
Hey guy!

17:50.320 --> 17:51.320
That's how he sounded too.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.800
He sounded like Animal from The Muppets.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.400
Hey guy!

17:55.400 --> 18:00.020
And he actually said, I'm a WoW player!

18:00.020 --> 18:02.520
And I'm like, you're a WoW, you're retarded.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.620
Yeah, I'm like me too.

18:03.620 --> 18:08.560
But then he tried to tell me, he's like, yeah man, I like EverQuest on the PlayStation 2,

18:38.560 --> 18:42.720
to run it and you have to play a watered-down version.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.760
Wow, I never knew that!

18:44.760 --> 18:49.640
Oh, is this EverQuest 2? Because I was going to say, you can't really water down EverQuest 1.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.480
Yeah, you can. You can open up Microsoft Paint

18:52.480 --> 18:55.520
and just draw things there and it looks almost as good.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.440
Alright, anything else you've been playing this week, Mikaela?

18:59.440 --> 19:02.760
Well, I've been kind of sick and while I was waiting for

19:02.760 --> 19:06.400
Warsong Gulch to queue up, I just play a lot of Uwendan

19:06.400 --> 19:08.500
and Koth on the screen.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.060
It was pretty terrible. Please tell me that's not my screen.

19:11.060 --> 19:14.980
My DS Lite screen. And know what else he played?

19:14.980 --> 19:16.500
He forgot to mention that.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.680
What did I play?

19:17.680 --> 19:18.540
In the Groove 2.

19:18.540 --> 19:22.260
Oh yeah, I played In the Groove 2. Oh yeah, I forgot. We were all at the Arcana Pro.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.220
I played In the Groove 2, too. I don't...

19:24.220 --> 19:28.260
I did not touch In the Groove 2, other than to step on the panels, which,

19:28.260 --> 19:33.200
by the way, the dance pad used to be a Max 2, therefore it is still kosher.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.940
You know, it's like...

19:34.940 --> 19:37.740
it's like pre-op, okay?

19:37.740 --> 19:42.340
But it's still, you know, it's still DDR, it's just got stickers on it, you know, but...

19:42.340 --> 19:47.380
I hate In the Groove and all, but they did get a couple really good songs, and so, and

19:47.380 --> 19:49.100
the steps were fun for those songs.

19:49.100 --> 19:54.460
I won't touch like 98% of that game, but there are like three songs that I'll play.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.780
Yeah, and here's the thing, is that Miklotov, not only will he play those same three songs

19:57.780 --> 20:01.300
over and over, but then he'll like stand by the machine and try to get everybody else

20:01.300 --> 20:02.300
to play the same damn song.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.300
He's like, play this, play this, I'm like, no, goddammit, I want to find my own song

20:05.300 --> 20:06.300
to play.

20:06.300 --> 20:07.300
But you didn't want to find your own song.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.300
Cuz you'll pick a crappy

20:09.380 --> 20:14.260
I was going through all the songs listening to clip see if there's anything I wanted to play in there really wasn't a whole lot

20:14.260 --> 20:15.260
But to be fair

20:15.260 --> 20:21.100
To be fair. I didn't know the songs there's like three song when I you know what but when I did DDR Supernova the first

20:21.100 --> 20:22.620
Time I did that too. I went through the whole thing

20:22.620 --> 20:25.180
I'm like, I don't really know if I want to play. I don't know if I wanna play a play tierra buena

20:25.180 --> 20:27.700
It's the best. All right, forget it. Anyway, let's

20:28.580 --> 20:32.700
We did play Q's are in that was awesome. Sure. It was awesome

20:32.700 --> 20:35.420
Except not.

20:35.420 --> 20:36.420
Let's get into tonight.

20:36.420 --> 20:39.340
Shout out to LazerQuest back in Wichita for being better.

20:39.340 --> 20:40.540
Oh, LazerQuest sucks.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.340
Alright, can we get into the news tonight please?

20:42.340 --> 20:43.780
Thank you.

20:43.780 --> 20:47.620
Start off with a little PSP news, but unfortunately this might be a bit of bad news for some of

20:47.620 --> 20:49.960
you PSP fans.

20:49.960 --> 20:53.620
Target stores have recently pulled the UMD movies.

20:53.620 --> 20:57.980
GamePro recently got a scoop that UMDs are now being discontinued in all Target stores

20:57.980 --> 21:00.620
this as of last week.

21:00.620 --> 21:08.620
You know what though? Honestly, UMDs, $10 more expensive than a DVD, yet less extras.

21:08.620 --> 21:12.180
It never really made sense to me. I mean, sure you can do it on the go, but you can

21:12.180 --> 21:18.200
also get a DVD player for on the go. You know, I think I own like one UMD movie and that's

21:18.200 --> 21:19.200
it.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.700
I still want the Silent Hill one, the Silent Hill experience, but that's about it.

21:22.700 --> 21:23.700
Now that is a better idea.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.700
That's not totally a movie though.

21:24.700 --> 21:28.860
Yeah, that's a much better idea because that's more like interactive, you know.

21:28.860 --> 21:33.500
the Metal Gear comic that came out. Exactly, that's where things should be headed.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.000
It sounds like we'll be headed, but we'll see. The thing, I think what's kind of funny

21:37.000 --> 21:42.540
about the whole Target and pulling the UMD thing is, who cares, because Target didn't

21:42.540 --> 21:46.480
really have a selection of UMDs in the first place, and the second thing is, kind of, Sony

21:46.480 --> 21:51.460
is pushing this brand new, like, one gig memory stick with movies already on there.

21:51.460 --> 21:55.980
Oh, so you think maybe it's a matter of Sony might go to this digital distribution thing

21:55.980 --> 22:01.020
I only want to do digital distribution for everything because they're a little sad that

22:01.020 --> 22:05.300
their UMD format didn't take off, which the only thing I did think was pretty good about

22:05.300 --> 22:09.400
it is the fact that it's covered in a plastic case and you can't really scratch this thing

22:09.400 --> 22:11.020
unless you really try.

22:11.020 --> 22:12.020
Which is good.

22:12.020 --> 22:17.980
I think that's how they should have done BluRay or something like that and have it in an old

22:17.980 --> 22:18.980
style...

22:18.980 --> 22:20.640
That's probably why they're more expensive though.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.540
This is a plastic case.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.540
They're not more expensive actually.

22:23.540 --> 22:24.540
It's just...

22:24.540 --> 22:25.540
They'll charge for everything.

22:25.540 --> 22:45.140
Whatever. It's still, though, I think that was a pretty cool idea, just because, you know, it's good for the rental market, but the whole packaging of UMD with, and by the way, these aren't exactly my favorite picks of movies, like was it Hitch, Triple X, um, god, and there was, like, Stealth, and something else.

22:45.140 --> 22:47.380
They just won't let Stealth die.

22:47.940 --> 22:49.220
Stealth was a bad movie.

22:49.220 --> 22:52.720
I'm going to a chat room, orangeonstrategy.com, and

22:52.720 --> 22:56.660
Maury says, I'm amazed they didn't drop them earlier, referring to the UMDs.

22:56.660 --> 23:00.360
Because they're stubborn. You know, I want their stuff to work. You bring up a good point though

23:00.360 --> 23:02.300
about the digital distribution here. You know,

23:02.300 --> 23:06.440
everybody kind of is assuming, and you know, it would make logical sense that

23:06.440 --> 23:10.360
Apple, with their video iPods, are going to get into movie distribution by the

23:10.360 --> 23:11.200
end of the year. Like,

23:11.200 --> 23:14.520
that'll be the way that they sell iPods this Christmas, is that video iPods will

23:14.520 --> 23:16.280
come out with a little larger of a screen,

23:16.280 --> 23:19.920
and they're gonna sell movies through the iTunes Music Store.

23:19.920 --> 23:23.260
In fact, it's already somewhat been confirmed because I believe there's

23:23.260 --> 23:24.840
been news reports about

23:24.840 --> 23:28.240
Apple trying to negotiate with the movie companies and they want to do...

23:28.240 --> 23:31.600
they don't want a flat rate for all the movies. They want varying,

23:31.600 --> 23:35.500
you know, depending on how new the movie is and all that stuff. So maybe Sony's just

23:35.500 --> 23:37.080
trying to beat them to the punch a little bit.

23:37.080 --> 23:40.560
I mean, hypothetically, Sony could set up like a PSP store

23:40.560 --> 23:43.840
to download movies on your stick and that would be kinda interesting

23:43.840 --> 23:47.200
if they could beat Apple to it I don't think it would be enough

23:47.200 --> 23:50.920
you know I you don't think of a lot of people don't think

23:50.920 --> 23:53.920
of you know a gamer might be different but the

23:53.920 --> 23:57.760
the normal average person probably doesn't think of hey if I'm gonna go

23:57.760 --> 23:59.120
listen to music on the go

23:59.120 --> 24:04.120
I'm gonna use my PSP I think the general public still views the PSP as a gaming

24:04.120 --> 24:04.860
system

24:04.860 --> 24:08.720
it's yeah basically is a gaming system it's a gaming system that can also view

24:08.720 --> 24:09.880
movies if I want it's like

24:09.880 --> 24:13.060
if I'm tired of playing a game I can pop in a movie but to be honest

24:13.060 --> 24:19.460
I don't wanna sit for like 3 hours or 2 hours in front of my PSP trying to watch a movie.

24:19.460 --> 24:20.460
It's not fun.

24:20.460 --> 24:26.180
And even like the Spiderman 2 UMD that was in there with the PSP, I just don't care.

24:26.180 --> 24:30.060
I think it's lame, I don't know.

24:30.060 --> 24:31.780
But whatever.

24:31.780 --> 24:37.100
Speaking of things being pulled, Sony has actually pulled their PSP ad campaign in the

24:37.100 --> 24:38.100
Netherlands.

24:38.100 --> 24:42.220
The one that's been getting people all pissed off with the fact that it's got black and

24:42.220 --> 24:46.740
white people in it, oh my god, and there's got to be something racial about it.

24:46.740 --> 24:51.140
Well apparently, you know, all the bitching and moaning by the US, which is stupid because

24:51.140 --> 24:56.380
they shouldn't have even been getting in this business anyways, it's a different country,

24:56.380 --> 25:02.860
but they pulled it anyways, and basically, yeah, the campaign's gone.

25:02.860 --> 25:07.260
Thank you people in the United States and other places that were complaining about stuff

25:07.260 --> 25:09.700
that's not even going to be visible in your country.

25:09.700 --> 25:13.220
Well, we talked about this a little bit more in depth last week, so if you want to hear

25:13.220 --> 25:17.860
our thoughts on this controversial issue, go download last week's show, episode 190.

25:17.860 --> 25:22.260
But we invited you guys in our voicemail of the week segment to leave your thoughts on

25:22.260 --> 25:26.640
what you thought about the whole controversy behind what was going on.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.620
So I thought we could play a couple voicemails.

25:28.620 --> 25:32.420
Some of you guys left some really good points, but your voicemails were really, really long.

25:32.420 --> 25:33.700
We didn't have quite enough time to play them.

25:33.700 --> 25:39.020
But I enjoyed listening to them, and I will share them with Dark Soccer and Loki later

25:39.020 --> 25:43.600
But I'm gonna play two kind of short feedback ones that I thought were pretty good here in our voicemails of the week

25:43.600 --> 25:45.340
Here's voicemail number one

25:45.340 --> 25:52.900
Hey, this is Mac man, and in response to your question of course Sony isn't of course

25:52.900 --> 25:55.120
Sony isn't racist. They're just risky

25:55.940 --> 26:02.520
Remember the 10 years of passion sign or the take a jumping take a running jump here on the subway sign

26:02.520 --> 26:07.800
They've done this before, except this time it involved two women of different color trying

26:07.800 --> 26:09.360
to kill each other.

26:09.360 --> 26:14.560
Sony got us, but the important part is, Sony got us to talk about the white PSP, didn't

26:14.560 --> 26:15.560
they?

26:15.560 --> 26:17.940
See you on the flip side, Mac Man.

26:17.940 --> 26:22.720
Very interesting because he says there that, yeah, it got everybody to talk about the white

26:22.720 --> 26:23.720
PSP, didn't it?

26:23.720 --> 26:24.720
Here's the point.

26:24.720 --> 26:28.560
And Sony kind of has this history of doing these pushing the envelope ads.

26:28.560 --> 26:34.060
What they really need to focus on was, and I think a lot of people miss this, it wasn't

26:34.060 --> 26:35.540
white and black.

26:35.540 --> 26:38.360
It wasn't these two people fighting each other.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.540
It was chick fight.

26:39.540 --> 26:40.820
It was a chick fight.

26:40.820 --> 26:44.560
And nothing brings out a crowd of people like a good chick fight.

26:44.560 --> 26:50.500
Like a drunken chick ball, just right outside of a bar, just beating each other up.

26:50.500 --> 26:53.100
That sells PSPs.

26:53.100 --> 26:55.880
But unfortunately, you know, everyone had to bring color into it.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.840
But it's all about cat fights.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.560
So it's just a good old-fashioned cat fight.

27:00.560 --> 27:01.560
It's a good old-fashioned cat fight.

27:01.560 --> 27:06.680
And to be honest, I think the whole ad campaign was a bit skewed anyways because they did

27:06.680 --> 27:11.200
have like 100 different images, and of course the one where it shows the white person beating

27:11.200 --> 27:12.200
up on the black person.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.200
Oh my god!

27:13.200 --> 27:14.200
Racist!

27:14.200 --> 27:18.520
But, you know, when it's the black person beating up on the white person, it's just...

27:18.520 --> 27:20.160
Oh my god, LA!

27:20.160 --> 27:21.160
Let's do another.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.920
This is our last voicemail.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.280
Just a couple short ones this week.

27:24.280 --> 27:26.280
Let's hear this next voicemail.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.560
Hi there, this is Apollo from Nashville, Tennessee.

27:29.560 --> 27:34.140
I'm just giving my thoughts on the whole Sony billboard ad thingamajig.

27:34.140 --> 27:38.280
I just wanted to say that I think, since Sony's a worldwide company and they've got their

27:38.280 --> 27:42.720
hands all over the world, I think that they're perfectly aware that race is still a very

27:42.720 --> 27:47.920
controversial topic in many places, and I kind of think that they should be more cautious

27:47.920 --> 27:53.780
to make sure that they're not releasing advertisements that are obvious targets for criticism.

27:53.780 --> 27:57.500
I guess regardless, it did get released, so I don't know.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.900
I don't think their message was that white is better than black, and I don't think that's

28:00.900 --> 28:04.140
what they intended to think, and I don't think they wanted to say that white people are better

28:04.140 --> 28:05.140
than black people.

28:05.140 --> 28:08.380
So I think it's kind of ridiculous that people are making a huge deal out of it, but at the

28:08.380 --> 28:11.220
same time, Sophie should have been watching for it.

28:11.220 --> 28:13.540
But anyway, that's just all I wanted to say.

28:13.540 --> 28:16.380
Love you guys' show, and I hope you hear from me too.

28:16.380 --> 28:17.380
Bye.

28:17.380 --> 28:18.380
Thanks for the voicemail.

28:18.380 --> 28:19.380
It was very nice.

28:19.380 --> 28:26.380
I like how that person says that Sony kind of knew what they were doing in a way, like

28:26.380 --> 28:31.180
using the race would probably come up, but the fact that maybe it wasn't necessarily

28:31.180 --> 28:34.420
they were trying to say that white is better than black, and I don't think anybody really,

28:34.420 --> 28:36.860
I don't know, maybe some of these congressmen feel that that's what they were trying to

28:36.860 --> 28:39.980
say, but I don't think that's what they were trying to say, especially when you see all

28:39.980 --> 28:45.380
of the ad campaign, but maybe we're just trying to use the contrast, I guess was their big

28:45.380 --> 28:46.380
thing.

28:46.380 --> 28:50.020
especially in hearing about some of these other ads, it was just about showing different

28:50.020 --> 28:56.540
types of contrast, and certainly that was a contrasting image, but it also polarized

28:56.540 --> 28:58.420
the community in many different ways.

28:58.420 --> 28:59.420
Any final thoughts on this issue?

28:59.420 --> 29:00.420
I don't know.

29:00.420 --> 29:07.140
I think the whole issue is stupid to begin with, but then again, Sony is known for stupid

29:07.140 --> 29:10.060
ad campaigns sometimes, but so is Microsoft though.

29:10.060 --> 29:11.060
I don't know.

29:11.060 --> 29:14.900
I think people that are advertising for video game systems really need to simplify things.

29:14.900 --> 29:15.900
Do what Nintendo does.

29:15.900 --> 29:20.980
I mean, at least theirs, you know, they show the games and, you know, here's what's on

29:20.980 --> 29:27.860
the DS Lite, check it out, you know, and then people buy the DS Lite or buy, you know, whatever.

29:27.860 --> 29:31.980
Except no one bought the GameCube for that, I don't know, whatever ad campaign they were

29:31.980 --> 29:33.580
doing for the GameCube just didn't work.

29:33.580 --> 29:40.460
Alright, now if you'd like to leave us a voicemail, our phone number is 916-226-9067, but please

29:40.460 --> 29:44.380
remember if you don't pay the phone bill, please ask whoever does their permission before

29:44.380 --> 29:48.620
you call in because that's not an 800 number, it's not a toll-free call.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.440
Or you can always call us on Skype, username OrangeLawnsRadio, when we are not live.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.820
That way you get our voicemail.

29:53.820 --> 29:58.380
It was just like the whole Xbox 360 advertising campaign jump in.

29:58.380 --> 29:59.380
It made no sense.

29:59.380 --> 30:04.860
It had nothing to do with the Xbox 360, it's like, people having fun, Xbox 360.

30:04.860 --> 30:09.780
And like I said before, I've probably mentioned this before, we had a project in our high

30:09.780 --> 30:14.260
school economics class to create a product and make a commercial for it.

30:14.260 --> 30:18.280
product and my friend he created took a bunch of clips from like different TV

30:18.280 --> 30:23.480
shows and showing explosions and stuff and just one big long montage set to

30:23.480 --> 30:29.140
music and the very end buy bumper stickers it was great because it it was

30:29.140 --> 30:32.020
just something that entertained you but it had nothing to do with the product I

30:32.020 --> 30:36.260
helped my friends in Spanish class my senior year of high school they had to

30:36.260 --> 30:40.340
do a commercial but in Spanish so we did a condom commercial and they got an F

30:40.340 --> 30:42.780
for doing a condom commercial.

30:42.780 --> 30:44.340
Oh come on, that's retarded.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.260
But I remember because we were all sitting around the bed,

30:46.260 --> 30:49.020
like we would film, we just filmed the product on the bed

30:49.020 --> 30:50.580
and everybody was pushing the bed

30:50.580 --> 30:51.900
so it was going up and down.

30:53.900 --> 30:56.620
And they failed, but it was really funny

30:56.620 --> 30:59.240
and if that was on TV, if that was on Univision,

30:59.240 --> 31:00.580
I think it was funny.

31:02.540 --> 31:03.420
Bitch teacher.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.340
Anyway, I'm sorry.

31:07.380 --> 31:08.980
A voicemail topics for this week,

31:08.980 --> 31:12.100
I want to give you guys a topic for this week, and it kind of goes into our next story here.

31:12.100 --> 31:16.740
This is a great blog piece that was on a website called Twitch Guru.

31:16.740 --> 31:21.340
It's actually kind of old, it's an older piece, but it was picking up some notoriety on gaming

31:21.340 --> 31:22.340
blogs.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.980
I mean, literally you'd have to go back to September of 2005 to see this piece, but for

31:24.980 --> 31:27.660
some reason it was getting picked up by a bunch of sites this week, so that's how it

31:27.660 --> 31:28.860
caught our attention.

31:28.860 --> 31:31.300
But you can ask this question anytime.

31:31.300 --> 31:35.420
This is kind of a timeless issue, yet it's not.

31:35.420 --> 31:37.900
Are video games getting easier?

31:37.900 --> 31:38.900
Think about it.

31:38.900 --> 31:44.700
In the 1980s, you had things like Pac-Man, where it was pretty hard to get far into that

31:44.700 --> 31:45.700
game.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.620
I mean, seriously, what's the furthest you've ever gotten Pac-Man?

31:47.620 --> 31:51.700
Or think about Ms. Pac-Man, have you ever gotten past the first two boards?

31:51.700 --> 31:54.900
You know how there's the pink board and there's the blue board?

31:54.900 --> 31:58.700
Have you ever gotten to the red boards or the ones that come later on?

31:58.700 --> 32:05.300
The old games there were really, really hard, but games today don't seem to be as challenging.

32:05.300 --> 32:07.700
It seems to be there's more finite, a way to finish them.

32:07.700 --> 32:11.020
You know what's funny too is a lot of those older games like Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man

32:11.020 --> 32:14.700
they see as like approachable games for people even though they are harder.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.740
That's kind of funny.

32:16.740 --> 32:18.620
So I'm curious, what do you guys think?

32:18.620 --> 32:21.620
Are video games getting easier as time goes on?

32:21.620 --> 32:25.500
I think they're dumbing them down for the dumb people out there that buy video game

32:25.500 --> 32:30.700
systems and there's a lot of them out there, so yeah.

32:30.700 --> 32:34.060
Because they're also afraid, you know, that their reviews on the games or whatever are

32:34.060 --> 32:40.180
the game was too hard and I returned it because I couldn't do it and also they

32:40.180 --> 32:42.980
also kind of want to make sure that people play through the game so that

32:42.980 --> 32:47.940
they go and buy another one you know and the article continues to speculate that

32:47.940 --> 32:50.940
possibly one reason why games get easier is because they want to target the

32:50.940 --> 32:57.740
casual gamer well the casual gamer buys the so-called casual games like pac-man

32:57.740 --> 33:04.740
Galaga, Frogger, Gauntlet, uh, wait, these were all harder games, what the hell, I mean,

33:07.020 --> 33:14.020
I don't get it. I think what it is is less complex games, maybe. They're simpler concepts

33:14.660 --> 33:20.180
but harder difficulty. So, you know, Pac-Man's easy. You know, Gobble Dots.

33:20.180 --> 33:24.660
Isn't that what, and that's kind of what the Wii's selling point is, right? Pick up the

33:24.660 --> 33:29.900
thing and go. Yeah, simple games. Anybody can learn. You can make a simple game that is really hard.

33:29.900 --> 33:33.700
It's just, you know, don't make it so complex with 52 buttons.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.700
I mean that's, it's basically, you know, Pac-Man,

33:36.700 --> 33:39.780
pick up dots, you know, and eat ghosts.

33:39.780 --> 33:43.620
Pretty simple. You don't even need to use a button, just a joystick for it. So,

33:43.620 --> 33:47.740
I don't know. Tigerclaw makes an interesting point in our chat room. Back in the 80s,

33:47.740 --> 33:51.060
video games were more about getting high scores so you could enter your initials

33:51.060 --> 33:52.260
in the top 5 or 10.

33:52.260 --> 33:56.180
I used to have the top score on a moon patrol machine at the

33:56.180 --> 34:00.460
local pizza parlor. I rock. Anyway, we're curious about your thoughts on this. Are

34:00.460 --> 34:01.760
video games getting easier?

34:01.760 --> 34:06.220
Or is this just where the market is headed and it's not that the

34:06.220 --> 34:09.220
games are getting easier? I mean, think about some really hard games that have come out like

34:09.220 --> 34:10.260
Ninja Gaiden and things.

34:10.260 --> 34:15.140
Are video games getting easier? Or is there just the misconception because

34:15.140 --> 34:16.420
games used to be a lot

34:16.420 --> 34:20.740
simpler? They weren't as complex. So we're really curious what you guys' thoughts are on that

34:20.740 --> 34:24.340
and we look forward to hearing your voicemails of the week. We'll play some of our

34:24.340 --> 34:25.580
favorites on next week's show.

34:25.580 --> 34:29.500
Awesome. Well, I'm kinda speaking a little bit

34:29.500 --> 34:34.100
about difficulty. One thing that's been difficult is Sony selling the

34:34.100 --> 34:35.620
PlayStation 3 to

34:35.620 --> 34:39.300
the gamers out there. Well, one thing that they did supposedly

34:39.300 --> 34:44.420
make, and this was leaked out apparently, was this internal kind of almost like a

34:44.420 --> 34:45.380
Q&A

34:45.380 --> 34:49.500
for E3 for anybody that's working for Sony to be able to answer like press

34:49.500 --> 34:50.540
questions about the

34:50.540 --> 34:55.420
PlayStation 3, and I thought it was quite interesting, some of the things on there.

34:55.420 --> 34:58.800
One of the most interesting things on there is they are really stressing the fact that

34:58.800 --> 35:00.040
the PlayStation 3 is a computer.

35:00.040 --> 35:04.600
In fact, I think it mentions it about six or seven times in here, saying, PlayStation

35:04.600 --> 35:07.040
3 is a computer system.

35:07.040 --> 35:11.520
Then they also basically saying, it's one product with different configurations.

35:11.520 --> 35:16.520
So they're trying to basically say, Sony, we can sell you a PlayStation 3.

35:16.520 --> 35:21.900
It's kind of like Dell, we can build you a custom system.

35:21.900 --> 35:25.440
One interesting thing though about it is that they're saying that the noise of the system

35:25.440 --> 35:31.020
is supposed to be about the same as a slim PS2, so pretty quiet.

35:31.020 --> 35:35.280
Also of course kind of following up with what they said during E3 that it will be able to

35:35.280 --> 35:45.880
support 8 controllers, they're guessing maybe 4 wireless, 4 wired controllers, not sure.

35:45.880 --> 35:50.560
And that the specs are pretty close to final, that was one of the other things.

35:50.560 --> 35:56.680
And that the blu-ray drive is going to be BD Live compliant, in other words you'll be

35:56.680 --> 36:03.760
able to connect to the internet using some of the special features on the blu-ray disc.

36:03.760 --> 36:07.600
Kind of interesting but I thought it was kind of funny though just how much they were stressing

36:07.600 --> 36:11.800
the Playstation 3 being an actual computer system.

36:11.800 --> 36:18.880
In fact, there are some interesting things on here including, right here, it says the

36:18.880 --> 36:24.080
PS3 is being positioned as a computer system, not a computer entertainment system.

36:24.080 --> 36:28.120
Like other computer systems, it can be upgraded through the use of readily available industry

36:28.120 --> 36:30.080
standard adapters.

36:30.080 --> 36:36.880
So they're basically saying any PC, USB components you can use with this PlayStation 3.

36:36.880 --> 36:40.400
Another interesting thing on here is they were asking them the difference between Xbox

36:40.400 --> 36:47.900
live and the PlayStation 3 live and well they kind of dodged the question which was kind

36:47.900 --> 36:48.900
of funny.

36:48.900 --> 36:52.460
But yeah, so it was pretty interesting.

36:52.460 --> 36:56.640
I love this comment in our chat room, Rini says if the PlayStation 3 is a computer system

36:56.640 --> 37:00.580
I want to run Word and Photoshop on it.

37:00.580 --> 37:01.580
Well you know...

37:01.580 --> 37:02.580
Why not?

37:02.580 --> 37:05.120
If the PlayStation 3 is such a computer?

37:05.120 --> 37:09.680
Well they said that you can run Linux on it and in fact you know one of the questions

37:09.680 --> 37:12.880
is, will Linux OS be adopted as you have planned?

37:12.880 --> 37:14.840
And it says, yes, PS3 is a computer system,

37:14.840 --> 37:19.060
and Linux OS is adopted as one of the standard OSes on there.

37:19.060 --> 37:21.360
Our chat room also seems to be running with that story

37:21.360 --> 37:23.900
from a couple weeks ago, where the controller is supposedly

37:23.900 --> 37:24.680
called the Poohs.

37:24.680 --> 37:27.400
And now they're calling it, I see

37:27.400 --> 37:30.240
DMN made a comment here where he says, HD DVD is greater

37:30.240 --> 37:32.640
than Pooh-ray.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.800
And now they're calling it Pooh-ray.

37:34.800 --> 37:35.840
That's cute.

37:35.840 --> 37:39.760
And now even DJ Pooh Eater changed his name to Poohs Eater.

37:39.760 --> 37:44.320
Get it? I still say that story was a piece of poo.

37:44.320 --> 37:48.280
I don't think it's true, but we'll see. We'll see when it comes out. I think

37:48.280 --> 37:52.360
they probably won't call it the Poohs. It'll probably be like, you know, some

37:52.360 --> 37:55.520
infinity sign something or other, but

37:55.520 --> 37:59.120
everyone will call it Poohs. Yeah, everybody's gonna... Seriously, Sony, if you're

37:59.120 --> 38:00.440
listening, just change the name.

38:00.440 --> 38:03.680
Just call it the PS3 controller. Really, it works.

38:03.680 --> 38:07.560
Anyway, one other PlayStation 3 thing that kind of left a lot of people with a question

38:07.560 --> 38:10.880
mark over their head was this trailer that they showed at E3.

38:10.880 --> 38:11.880
You remember?

38:11.880 --> 38:15.320
It was this trailer and then there was all these animals that would come out, yes it

38:15.320 --> 38:21.040
was Africa was the big title, and the people were like, I mean you could seriously, I remember

38:21.040 --> 38:26.880
we were all sitting at the arena interactive lounge where a lot of the all games contingent,

38:26.880 --> 38:32.440
us and some of our cousin shows that all broadcast on allgames.com, we're all kind of sitting

38:32.440 --> 38:36.160
around and watching the Sony thing and there was just this big collective, what the fuck

38:36.160 --> 38:39.240
was that after that trailer?

38:39.240 --> 38:44.000
And we were all kind of speculating what the fuck Africa is going, is it like Pokemon Snap?

38:44.000 --> 38:47.940
And that was kind of the consensus that we came to is it has to be something like Pokemon

38:47.940 --> 38:49.880
Snap until we hear something more.

38:49.880 --> 38:55.040
Well, there has been a little detail about Africa released, but don't expect it to tell

38:55.040 --> 38:56.320
you very much.

38:56.320 --> 39:03.040
Famitsu Magazine came out and revealed that Sony Computer Entertainment's Daisaku Ikajiri

39:03.040 --> 39:06.080
is involved with the game's development.

39:06.080 --> 39:12.320
Now, Ikajiri has also worked on Hot Shots Golf 3, 4, Portable, and Online.

39:12.320 --> 39:17.540
So this game may or may not have something in common with Hot Shots Golf.

39:17.540 --> 39:18.540
That's it!

39:18.540 --> 39:19.540
That's the only detail you get!

39:19.540 --> 39:20.540
Africa...

39:20.540 --> 39:25.000
Yeah, that sounds exciting.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
One thing I forgot to mention...

39:26.000 --> 39:29.960
However, in light of recent events, I hope Sony really uses some tact when promoting

39:29.960 --> 39:30.960
this game.

39:30.960 --> 39:38.960
Yeah, well, one thing I forgot to mention in the last story, the one question, how the

39:38.960 --> 39:43.480
PS3 network service is going to be, we'll also start the service at day one where the

39:43.480 --> 39:47.340
differences between Xbox Live and the PS3 network services, I thought I'd just quote

39:47.340 --> 39:48.760
exactly what they said here.

39:48.760 --> 39:53.200
Apart from providing basic features and functions, the most important element is content and

39:53.200 --> 39:57.960
is downloading music in SingStar, purchasing or exchanging game data as we had demonstrated

39:57.960 --> 40:02.160
at the E3 press conference and many other new ways of enjoyment too will be provided."

40:02.160 --> 40:04.160
Wow, that doesn't say anything.

40:04.160 --> 40:08.480
And also the fact that they were also saying that the PlayStation 3 will be only available

40:08.480 --> 40:11.480
in black at launch.

40:11.480 --> 40:14.680
So no white PS3 for you guys.

40:14.680 --> 40:20.520
Well anyways, speaking still of the PlayStation 3, there was an interview with Sony's Phil

40:20.520 --> 40:23.160
Harrison on Joystick.

40:23.160 --> 40:28.800
week and one of the questions, this was during the developers conference in Brighton, and

40:28.800 --> 40:36.300
their question was basically, because right now Sony's kind of being shown as arrogant

40:36.300 --> 40:40.180
and kind of, you know, there's been numerous quotes out there saying, you know, that you'll

40:40.180 --> 40:45.420
buy a Playstation 3 even if there weren't any games for it because it's a Playstation.

40:45.420 --> 40:55.200
So, it was kind of funny though because during the whole interview here, one of the quotes

40:55.200 --> 41:03.520
that they were saying about Kaz, he blatantly said, Microsoft is copying Sony. And of course,

41:03.520 --> 41:10.040
Phil Harrison's remark was, well quotes can be taken out of contests. Well, that was the

41:10.040 --> 41:16.920
actual sentence, though. Taking out, you know, how can you take that out of context? I mean,

41:16.920 --> 41:21.480
that seems pretty clear to me. But anyways, yeah, he didn't like the fact that they were

41:21.480 --> 41:25.600
asking him hard questions, which I thought was pretty funny. But, you know, you gotta

41:25.600 --> 41:29.340
feel sorry for that Phil Harrison guy, because I mean, I remember when they were first talking

41:29.340 --> 41:35.940
about the PlayStation 3 before we knew anything, you know, about the price. It, you know, he's

41:35.940 --> 41:40.860
He's got to cover up for all these higher ups there saying really dumb shit every week

41:40.860 --> 41:47.060
and you've got to feel bad for him or whatever.

41:47.060 --> 41:51.960
I think we should just move on to some Xbox news for a little bit here and I think this

41:51.960 --> 41:53.220
is kind of interesting.

41:53.220 --> 41:58.260
I think we already knew this but the Xbox has been officially discontinued.

41:58.260 --> 42:02.860
At least that's a rumor going around but honestly seeing as I can't seem to find a new Xbox

42:02.860 --> 42:03.860
for sale anywhere.

42:03.860 --> 42:05.860
The Xbox has been officially discontinued.

42:05.860 --> 42:09.860
We're not talking about 360, I'm talking about the regular old school Xbox.

42:09.860 --> 42:17.860
But what's the other rumor that's kind of interesting to note is that there is a new Xbox 360 Pro bundle being prepared by Microsoft supposedly

42:17.860 --> 42:27.860
that has Project Gotham Racing 3 included with it along with a 1250 Microsoft point card and a 3 month subscription to Xbox Live Gold

42:27.860 --> 42:30.860
and it will run you $399.

42:30.860 --> 42:34.660
But what's not mentioned there is, does that include the hard drive?

42:34.660 --> 42:38.660
I'm assuming it does, because normally on live you've got to have a hard drive or a memory card.

42:38.660 --> 42:39.460
I guess that's true.

42:39.460 --> 42:42.460
Or the point, you know, how you're going to spend the points with no hard drive.

42:42.460 --> 42:46.460
So, we'll see. But maybe, would you lose the cables?

42:46.460 --> 42:49.660
No. I think what they'll do is they'll probably just put that out.

42:49.660 --> 42:50.860
It's just going to be a bundle.

42:50.860 --> 42:54.060
You know, instead of, you won't be able to find the system by itself,

42:54.060 --> 42:59.860
then it'll be just coming with that game and stuff instead of the premium bundle or premium system.

42:59.860 --> 43:04.120
SSJ100, Matt makes an interesting observation in chatroom, it's funny that the PlayStation

43:04.120 --> 43:07.020
1 lasted longer in production than the original Xbox.

43:07.020 --> 43:14.220
Well, I don't know, I hope it doesn't happen because that sucks for us because we have

43:14.220 --> 43:20.220
a stockpile of like a thousand units and yeah, it's totally not a good thing.

43:20.220 --> 43:22.740
But anyways, send them to a landfill in Africa.

43:22.740 --> 43:26.620
No, we're not sending them to a landfill, they'll sell.

43:26.620 --> 43:33.500
So one good thing that is going on right now is they've kicked off the Xbox Live gold event

43:33.500 --> 43:41.180
and basically that was to kind of showcase the releases of some brand new Xbox Live games

43:41.180 --> 43:47.180
including of course Street Fighter 2, Galaga, Frogger, and Pac-Man.

43:47.180 --> 43:52.140
And they're going to be releasing them every Wednesday starting with, well, last Wednesday

43:52.140 --> 43:54.020
when Frogger came out.

43:54.020 --> 43:58.460
week you can look forward to cloning Clyde which will be pretty fun and then

43:58.460 --> 44:04.320
of course Galaga following on the 26th Street Fighter 2 on August 2nd are you

44:04.320 --> 44:09.300
sure this time are we sure this is official press release from Microsoft

44:09.300 --> 44:14.460
freaking better be last chance and pac-man on August 9th and I believe

44:14.460 --> 44:18.260
shortly after that there'll be some more stuff coming out but they're trying to

44:18.260 --> 44:22.760
do it you know every you know week or so they're gonna be really seeing a new

44:22.760 --> 44:27.280
title and you know not very expensive they're gonna be about you know five to

44:27.280 --> 44:30.080
ten dollars Street Fighter 2 being ten dollars same with Cloning Clyde

44:30.080 --> 44:33.200
everything else is five bucks. I have this random thought because we were

44:33.200 --> 44:36.920
talking earlier about you know our video games getting you know easier and we're

44:36.920 --> 44:40.320
talking about the retro games so it does seem like these retro games are really

44:40.320 --> 44:45.600
making a comeback slowly but surely with all these retro collections we saw you

44:45.600 --> 44:49.120
know the Atari the Intellivision lives the Midway collections and now kind of

44:49.120 --> 44:54.800
the Xbox Live Arcade sort of getting some new life to the retro games as well.

44:54.800 --> 45:01.640
Is that possibly because people feel that these retro games present a challenge, especially

45:01.640 --> 45:05.520
for the value you get, that really isn't provided by mainstream gaming today?

45:05.520 --> 45:06.800
I don't know.

45:06.800 --> 45:07.800
Maybe.

45:07.800 --> 45:08.800
It's kind of an odd thought.

45:08.800 --> 45:09.800
I don't know.

45:09.800 --> 45:14.640
But it's pretty cool that they're releasing all this stuff finally, since it's been like

45:14.640 --> 45:16.600
a while since UNO came out.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.080
Yeah, that's very good news to hear.

45:18.080 --> 45:21.840
I'm very glad to see that Xbox Live is finally getting some new stuff, so hopefully even

45:21.840 --> 45:24.200
more arcade releases by the end of the year.

45:24.200 --> 45:28.400
Not only are there releases in the arcade category, but they are also getting some releases

45:28.400 --> 45:31.440
in some of the video and movie categories as well.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.640
In fact, I actually downloaded this this week.

45:33.640 --> 45:39.280
It's Halo 3 In The Beginning was released on Xbox Live this week.

45:39.280 --> 45:46.040
In Halo 3 In The Beginning, basically what it is, it's a trailer about making the teaser

45:46.040 --> 45:51.480
announcement for Halo 3 a trailer of a trailer yes it's a trailer about the

45:51.480 --> 45:56.000
making of a trailer and it's not even like the real trailer it's the teaser

45:56.000 --> 46:01.040
trailer but I and so in a way I'm kind of going this is just like the biggest

46:01.040 --> 46:08.440
self-ego inflation piece I've ever seen on a video game console but I don't know

46:08.440 --> 46:11.800
at the same time I downloaded it because it's free and I'm like oh this is pretty

46:11.800 --> 46:15.360
and it's HD and I'll watch anything in HD because it's pretty especially what

46:15.360 --> 46:19.020
has to do with gaming but I did find it was fascinating I mean all the freaking

46:19.020 --> 46:23.980
work that went into making just that you know one-minute trailer they showed at

46:23.980 --> 46:28.620
the e3 speaking of pretty in HD I actually was we're picking up a new

46:28.620 --> 46:33.960
couch this weekend over at RC Willie and we were checking out the electronics

46:33.960 --> 46:40.440
section there and we had one of the guys show me a HD DVD demonstration on a 70

46:40.440 --> 46:44.980
inch plasma screen it looks pretty I don't know if I'd spend the four thousand

46:44.980 --> 46:49.520
dollars on the plasma screen for it but if I had a 7 inch plasma screen you know

46:49.520 --> 46:54.260
a next-gen you know video device would look pretty nice on it but you can

46:54.260 --> 47:01.140
actually see like some of the you know details like the little hairs individual

47:01.140 --> 47:06.460
hairs on like a flower and stuff like that just insane amount of detail all

47:06.460 --> 47:11.480
right well I'm someone just joined us who wants to comment on all this actually

47:11.480 --> 47:15.480
Hi everybody. I am literally just off the road.

47:15.480 --> 47:19.480
I actually had a conversation with DMN when I did my Tuesday show.

47:19.480 --> 47:25.480
Mentioned that basically HD DVD was blowing away Blu-ray for quality.

47:25.480 --> 47:28.480
I think they're about neck and neck if I remember correctly.

47:28.480 --> 47:34.480
But even still I was asking about the 1080p plasma screens out there.

47:34.480 --> 47:36.480
And they didn't have too many at the store.

47:36.480 --> 47:38.480
I mean they carried a lot of stuff.

47:38.480 --> 47:44.040
So, it's good that they're supporting 1080p, but there's not a lot of TVs out there to

47:44.040 --> 47:49.240
choose from, to be honest, so, I don't know, it's kind of interesting.

47:49.240 --> 47:50.240
Alright.

47:50.240 --> 47:52.240
Well, welcome DarkSakura, how are you?

47:52.240 --> 47:53.240
Uh, road-weary.

47:53.240 --> 47:54.240
Yeah?

47:54.240 --> 47:58.600
I'm actually weary of stupid men drivers.

47:58.600 --> 47:59.600
You were right.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.400
Should I put money on it?

48:01.400 --> 48:02.400
What?

48:02.400 --> 48:05.520
We had a bet if you would complain about drivers when you got here to the show.

48:05.520 --> 48:06.520
Don't I always?

48:06.520 --> 48:07.520
Exactly.

48:07.520 --> 48:09.520
At least she admits it!

48:09.520 --> 48:13.520
Amazingly enough, all the bad drivers were male.

48:13.520 --> 48:21.520
Especially the one who was tailgating the person in front of him, skidded off the side of the road, and blew a rocket into my windshield.

48:21.520 --> 48:26.520
I forgot we had somebody else on your mic, so I want to make sure we're not blowing the audience away there. Sorry about that.

48:26.520 --> 48:28.520
With the awesomeness of my voice.

48:28.520 --> 48:30.520
Sorry about that.

48:30.520 --> 48:33.520
Anyway, how was your gaming week? You want to get that out?

48:33.520 --> 48:38.660
Sure my gaming week was actually was a lot of Animal Crossing and a lot of

48:38.660 --> 48:44.560
pinball a lot of pinball. I played so much pinball last weekend. Was it was it

48:44.560 --> 48:47.360
just that show that you called us from last week? Well that and playing pinball

48:47.360 --> 48:51.680
in my garage you know. Did you end up buying any new machines? We did not and actually we

48:51.680 --> 48:54.640
lost out on the Black Knight 2000 we were gonna get because we went back to

48:54.640 --> 48:57.560
check on it and it had been sold to somebody else for $600 can you believe

48:57.560 --> 49:04.280
it and but we are working on a World Cup soccer 94 which is actually one of my

49:04.280 --> 49:10.280
favorite machines for nostalgia value and we actually had two of our triggers

49:10.280 --> 49:14.240
on our last action hero broke so we have to replace that before we can keep

49:14.240 --> 49:18.640
playing it but Dan got our roulette working on our who done it pinball so

49:18.640 --> 49:22.480
that's awesome it now completely works all right sounds fun and I put a lot of

49:22.480 --> 49:26.000
crossing I got an I got a note that our chat room here is just there they're

49:26.000 --> 49:28.700
celebrating that you're back.

49:28.700 --> 49:31.460
We have DMN says, nice of you to show up, Dark Sakura.

49:31.460 --> 49:32.460
Hey!

49:32.460 --> 49:33.980
No, I think you meant that in a good way, though.

49:33.980 --> 49:34.980
Oh, hi.

49:34.980 --> 49:35.980
And let's see, what else?

49:35.980 --> 49:38.320
Morrie says, yay, Dark Sakura's around again.

49:38.320 --> 49:39.320
Life is fun.

49:39.320 --> 49:41.660
Life is always fun with me here at the party every day.

49:41.660 --> 49:46.180
And then somebody referred to, oh, Dark Knight said, Dark Sakura is the queen of the show,

49:46.180 --> 49:47.940
all hail the OLR queen.

49:47.940 --> 49:52.220
And then DMN followed that up with, I thought Skye was the queen of the show.

49:52.220 --> 49:53.220
Screw you.

49:53.220 --> 49:54.220
Anyways.

49:54.220 --> 49:57.440
Anyways. Only on special occasions.

49:57.440 --> 50:00.700
Okay, well anyways, back to the new stuff.

50:00.700 --> 50:05.060
One of the things that actually happened this week was EA's Summer Showcase

50:05.060 --> 50:08.900
and that's basically kind of like their little press event that they have

50:08.900 --> 50:12.060
showcasing their brand new titles that are going to be coming out.

50:12.060 --> 50:16.900
And the top of the showcase, of course, the next-gen version of Half-Life 2

50:16.900 --> 50:20.100
which is going to be on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.900
So that's pretty interesting that that's been confirmed and not too much of a

50:22.900 --> 50:29.340
a surprise since, you know, it's going to be, you know, it's a pretty major game, especially

50:29.340 --> 50:35.060
now that they're doing the episodes and stuff. And of course, you know, it's exciting and

50:35.060 --> 50:41.260
that also kind of confirms the thing that was on GameStop not too long ago. But yeah,

50:41.260 --> 50:46.100
pretty sweet. And of course I know they were also releasing some other games that I thought

50:46.100 --> 50:55.940
that have been vaporware including actually oh what was it oh god I can't

50:55.940 --> 51:01.380
remember anyways yeah lots of good stuff team fortress 2 that's what it was so

51:01.380 --> 51:04.780
pretty cool all right for those of you guys listening live here on this Sunday

51:04.780 --> 51:09.020
evening we all got booted from chat because we had too many of us trying to

51:09.020 --> 51:11.900
hit the chat room at once all four of us here in the room we're all in the chat

51:11.900 --> 51:15.580
room and we got booted from the server so it's probably gonna be a few more

51:15.580 --> 51:16.980
minutes before we get back in so

51:16.980 --> 51:20.860
apologize for that you guys and we'll work on that at least throughout the break

51:20.860 --> 51:24.420
meanwhile we just gotta keep it running here so I'm gonna go to the next story here

51:24.420 --> 51:28.740
every extend extra has a demo that's been released and

51:28.740 --> 51:33.700
it's only for the PC so even though this game is gonna be coming out for the PSP

51:33.700 --> 51:37.100
you can only get the demo on your PC that's stupid

51:37.100 --> 51:40.820
well here's the thing though is that every extend was actually a PC game

51:40.820 --> 51:44.060
way back in the day so I'm assuming that every extend extra is also coming out for

51:44.060 --> 51:44.760
the PC

51:44.760 --> 51:49.440
So well, why don't they do like another PSP demo because I know that they had what?

51:50.080 --> 51:52.080
loco roko and

51:52.800 --> 51:55.600
You know, there's some well in Japan there was like some

51:56.960 --> 51:58.960
sudoku demo and stuff like that, but

51:59.520 --> 52:05.060
That's about it. I mean this brand new feature that they add to the PSP and they do nothing with

52:05.880 --> 52:08.720
excellent use of the PSP because you know

52:08.720 --> 52:14.080
You know, no one really wants demos to download off the internet, of course, because Xbox

52:14.080 --> 52:21.800
Live's Marketplace demos, no one ever downloads those, especially with the PSP needing people

52:21.800 --> 52:26.280
to buy some of this software out there, because there hasn't really been that many great games

52:26.280 --> 52:27.280
lately.

52:27.280 --> 52:32.560
I don't know, just hear me rant some more.

52:32.560 --> 52:36.800
Alright, well let's go to another story here.

52:36.800 --> 52:40.880
This is something that our music game fans, I'm kind of mad that we're booted from chat

52:40.880 --> 52:46.720
right now because I really would love to get reaction to this, but anyway, Konami has filed

52:46.720 --> 52:50.480
a patent for the title Guitar Revolution.

52:50.480 --> 52:54.960
Now what's interesting about this is that a lot of people are saying, oh well this means

52:54.960 --> 52:59.840
that Konami is planning to compete with Guitar Hero, they're going to go directly head to

52:59.840 --> 53:04.820
head with Guitar Hero, and a lot of people seem to be neglecting the fact that Konami

53:04.820 --> 53:08.460
had a guitar game out in Japan for quite some time

53:08.460 --> 53:11.700
they did release a version here in the US but

53:11.700 --> 53:15.000
it didn't do so well. It didn't come out for the home consoles though. It was only in the

53:15.000 --> 53:17.420
arcade. They had one mix in the arcade. It didn't do so hot

53:17.420 --> 53:20.620
over here. It just didn't catch on for whatever reason.

53:20.620 --> 53:24.420
So we didn't hear much on the guitar freaks front

53:24.420 --> 53:28.300
unless you were an import gamer here in the US for quite some time. But now

53:28.300 --> 53:30.980
they've gone and trademarked the name Guitar Revolution.

53:30.980 --> 53:33.980
So that would indicate if they are planning to revive the franchise here in

53:33.980 --> 53:34.540
the US

53:34.540 --> 53:40.560
They're gonna change the name of it to fit DDR, you know, dance dance revolution and karaoke revolution and all that good stuff

53:43.240 --> 53:49.480
Of course just because they patented the name doesn't mean that they are going to make it

53:49.480 --> 53:53.520
I mean they could just be you know, it could be a concept thing at this time

53:53.520 --> 53:58.660
They just don't want anyone else to jump in on it, but I don't know kind of looks

53:59.180 --> 54:02.200
Like they could be prepping for a new game. What do you think look?

54:02.200 --> 54:09.200
Probably. It makes sense, especially with the success of Guitar Hero. It would be something

54:10.920 --> 54:14.560
that they would probably want to do. I don't know. I think the whole problem before is

54:14.560 --> 54:20.840
they didn't know how to market Guitar Freaks to the people, and now that they've seen how

54:20.840 --> 54:27.280
it's basically been done, they can kind of go from there. So yeah.

54:27.280 --> 54:31.880
So I have to ask Miklatov, if we can get him a mic real quick, because he had to move a

54:31.880 --> 54:36.740
little bit there. How you doing? Good. Okay now what do you I know you can't

54:36.740 --> 54:39.740
really talk a whole lot about this because you you work at Konami or

54:39.740 --> 54:44.700
whatever but surely you must have some thoughts on kind of the reaction out

54:44.700 --> 54:50.820
there that people are having to this? I totally do. First of all I'd like to say

54:50.820 --> 54:56.020
that my opinions do not reflect Konami's opinions just a lot of people that work

54:56.020 --> 55:02.200
there or our opinion or yeah whoever it's my opinion and that's what I'm

55:02.200 --> 55:08.560
sticking to okay so when this guitar revolution stuff came out a wonderfully

55:08.560 --> 55:14.120
crappy site named one up calm decided that one of their idiots would write

55:14.120 --> 55:21.080
about it and his name is Jared Rhea just so everybody knows he also goes by slip

55:21.080 --> 55:28.360
I think I don't know I don't pay attention to him but what he did in his

55:28.360 --> 55:34.680
little blog post is pretty much say how our company actually works internally

55:34.680 --> 55:40.080
which he doesn't know and because he doesn't work there so that's pretty

55:40.080 --> 55:47.440
libelous and he also decided to bash on so like the DDR team that's in America

55:47.440 --> 55:52.900
saying that uh we care more about what songs we get in the game rather than the

55:52.900 --> 55:57.060
quality which is not true because we can't do anything about quality or

55:57.060 --> 56:03.580
songs so he's a moron and then apparently really recently maybe today I

56:03.580 --> 56:11.420
don't know how to read dates he talks about how he and one of my co-workers

56:11.420 --> 56:15.420
are pretty... read read read read read read.

56:15.420 --> 56:19.420
That he's taking credit for

56:19.420 --> 56:23.420
being a catalyst to the DDR

56:23.420 --> 56:27.420
revolution sort of thing in America

56:27.420 --> 56:31.420
and that he's one of the people that is behind

56:31.420 --> 56:35.420
the scenes making everyone move their feet to quote his blog post. Well he's not.

56:35.420 --> 56:39.420
He never worked at Konami. All he is is this whiny little punk that

56:39.420 --> 56:46.460
worked at 1UP.com, he no longer does it looks like, and I pretty much hate his guts,

56:47.900 --> 56:53.740
and he's an idiot. I could say a whole lot more, but it would involve a lot of cussing,

56:53.740 --> 57:01.260
and since I don't do that, I can't say anymore. Let me try to go back to the topic at hand,

57:01.260 --> 57:08.380
because I'm just trying to not go there. I'll go there. I know you will. I'm trying to think,

57:08.380 --> 57:19.380
Okay, what is the public, you have these people that are very vocal about, especially I notice

57:19.380 --> 57:23.620
within the Groove fans, I'm not talking about this blogger, but like in the Groove fans,

57:23.620 --> 57:29.100
have this huge misconception about the way DDR is made in America.

57:29.100 --> 57:32.860
What are the biggest misconceptions people have of Konami in general and the way that

57:32.860 --> 57:34.940
they're making their games, if there's anything you can say on that?

57:34.940 --> 57:37.420
I don't think there's anything I can actually say about that.

57:37.420 --> 57:41.980
All right, well, I think, um, I was going to beat him up.

57:41.980 --> 57:47.260
I think Mieglatov got us started on a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge

57:47.260 --> 58:00.380
Radio called the FUs of the Week.

58:00.380 --> 58:03.940
Every week we like to get a little bit ranty and say FU to things that piss us off.

58:03.940 --> 58:06.940
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

58:06.940 --> 58:10.780
that I've just come off the road a big f-you goes to that guy in the truck who

58:10.780 --> 58:14.540
sent a rock into my windshield and luckily enough it didn't put another

58:14.540 --> 58:20.380
crack in my windshield but it was just very surprising very dangerous how he

58:20.380 --> 58:25.780
was driving and so I got away from as fast as I could and also all the traffic

58:25.780 --> 58:27.780
back to home the 17 but that's another story

58:27.780 --> 58:39.780
Loki, I'd like to say a big FU, and not really a problem I have anymore, to my old couch.

58:39.780 --> 58:48.780
It sucked, and it's gone. Dump that piece of shit in landfill. I have a nice new couch

58:48.780 --> 58:53.780
now. Alright, Niklasov, do you have anything additional?

58:53.780 --> 59:01.700
I'd like to say an FU to oneup.com for being a terrible, terrible site and for hiring people

59:01.700 --> 59:04.180
that have no skills.

59:04.180 --> 59:09.940
I'd also like to clarify the views and opinions of our guests, do not reflect those of the

59:09.940 --> 59:14.380
rest of us.

59:14.380 --> 59:15.380
Let's see.

59:15.380 --> 59:16.380
I'm not done.

59:16.380 --> 59:17.380
What else?

59:17.380 --> 59:24.580
I'll give an FU to Milpitas Golfland because they put all their dancing games right next

59:24.580 --> 59:25.580
to each other.

59:25.580 --> 59:29.460
So now, if I want to go play Pump, I have to weed through the Supernova people and the

59:29.460 --> 59:32.420
In the Groove people, which are taking up way too much space for me.

59:32.420 --> 59:35.060
Oh yeah, I saw a Pump Zero machine in Reno yesterday.

59:35.060 --> 59:36.060
It's really fun.

59:36.060 --> 59:37.060
I didn't play it.

59:37.060 --> 59:40.060
What do I want to give an FU to this week?

59:40.060 --> 59:43.860
Oh, I'll give an FU to Reno for robbing me of $40 from their slot machines.

59:43.860 --> 59:47.660
I thought Reno was supposed to have better slot machines than the Indian casinos we have

59:47.660 --> 59:51.340
here, but I suppose not.

59:51.340 --> 59:54.140
F you to those one-armed bandits taking money from me.

59:54.140 --> 59:56.260
They're supposed to give me money.

59:56.260 --> 59:57.260
That's not fair.

59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.820
All right, let's get back into some news here, and again, we are still locked out of the

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.820
chat room.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.820
There's not a lot we can do.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:07.700
We're just kind of going to try and keep getting back in there, and we'll be hopefully back

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:08.700
soon.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.700
So, meanwhile.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.700
Yes, excellent.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:20.540
But meanwhile, I'd like to talk to you guys about Take Two and how they just constantly

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.460
like to get in the trouble.

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:28.780
This time they're in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission and this luckily has

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:36.260
nothing to do with the whole hot coffee thing, but it actually has to do with the stock option

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:42.940
grants that are made by the company from 1997 to the present.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:48.460
And basically they're just, they're not having a good day.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.580
And they really need another grant that thought it would come out.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:01:00.100
And they better not fuck up the network gameplay on Vice City Stories or I will be pissed.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:08.020
I will fly my ass down there to beat the crap out of them personally.

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:11.820
I hate those network programmers, god dammit they were so lazy.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:20.440
Anyways, moving on, speaking of programming, Hellgate London, the source code has been

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.540
stolen and leaked to the internet.

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:29.300
Kind of like some other games out there, but yeah so apparently someone on the inside stole

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:37.300
I remember seeing this at E3, the Hellgate London game, but it didn't really play it.

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.540
I don't know, interesting.

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:45.620
But yeah, hacker strike again, yay.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:49.660
Going to another story here, speaking of London-ish, it's about the UK.

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:52.340
It's about the government in the UK.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:56.820
The British government is actually going to be organizing a census to track the game industry's

01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:57.820
growth.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:02.780
The survey is being administered by Skill Set and this is an entertainment research

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:07.280
group and what they are going to do is they are going to gather data and this could actually

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.540
influence decisions made by the parliament later on.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:16.040
There is a quote from the creative director of Eidos Interactive, the census is a headcount

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.100
of the industry.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:21.080
It helps Skill Set influence government policy makers and public funds for the benefit and

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:26.280
support of the industry and the Skill Set will be going out to company managing directors

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.040
and Human Resource Departments, and you can also, if you happen to be one of these people,

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.480
you can do it online.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:37.440
It's available on the Skill Set website at skillset.org slash research slash census,

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.320
and they'll start the result calculating on July 12th.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:46.920
So if you want to influence what's going on in the UK government, maybe a little bit.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.880
It sounds a little bit like, I don't know, it kind of seems like it has some comparisons

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.840
to video game voters dot org, but not really.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.320
You know what it comes down to, huh?

01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.600
It comes down to census or die.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.160
We're going to go ahead and take a break here.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.000
We're going to call it the end of part A. When we come back, more Orange Lounge Radio

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.080
with our part B.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.360
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.360
