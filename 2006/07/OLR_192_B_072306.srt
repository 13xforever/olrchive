00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:32,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Strange Part A. We're back here to bring you some more gaming news.

16
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:15,651
[SPEAKER_11]: So check that out.

17
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:19,333
[SPEAKER_11]: We're here to talk about video games and get right back into the news.

18
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:21,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's starting us off tonight?

19
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:22,110
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be me.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Queen DarkSakura, what's up?

21
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

22
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:30,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, we've got some good news for our European listeners.

23
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:33,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's also good news for our American listeners.

24
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:42,817
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a release from Nintendo of America stating that there was a small number of DS lights that had a crack in the casing on the left-hand side of the hinge.

25
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:50,080
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's just above the power connector and it's like a .02% of the units have it so they're fixing those for free.

26
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:59,605
[SPEAKER_05]: So Nintendo of Europe basically has announced that any faulty DS lights will be repaired for free as long as the fault in question is covered under the valid warranty.

27
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:10,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically they're saying that if you have a problem with it you need to contact the local customer service area for Nintendo.

28
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:14,496
[SPEAKER_05]: The DS lights carry a one-year warranty for manufacturing defects.

29
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:18,677
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's covered under the warranty, it will be repaired for free.

30
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:26,920
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you live in the UK, the number to call for Nintendo's customer service, and I have no idea how the phone numbers work, is 0870-6060-247.

31
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Open 830 to 7 p.m.

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,241
[SPEAKER_05]: at national rate.

33
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:42,962
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also email at nintendoservicecenter at codestorm.co.uk And that's center spelled American way, I think.

34
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:45,103
[SPEAKER_11]: ER.

35
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:51,105
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole My DS is on Crack saga is very interesting, what's been going on with this.

36
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:57,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo kind of first came out and said it's not a problem, but then just a couple days later they kind of did this.

37
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just in the UK, but I know they've got something similar going on in the US as well.

38
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Both the DS lights I've seen, Miklatov has one and my roommate Extifer has one,

39
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:05,969
[SPEAKER_11]: and they're not cracking yet.

40
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:06,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine's neither.

41
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:08,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, oh, that's right, you got one too.

42
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,474
[SPEAKER_11]: We could look at it.

43
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:16,906
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't seem like it's this huge epidemic, but it's very interesting that Nintendo is kind of listening to the internet buzz and kind of...

44
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:20,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Saving their ass from internet skewing left and right.

45
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,592
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of interesting.

46
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:23,273
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good customer service, I suppose.

47
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:27,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they might actually be skewing the numbers of how many DS lights are cracked.

48
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:37,718
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, this was pointed out actually by MaxConsoleReader, there was a photo taken at the New York City flagship Nintendo World Store, and guess what?

49
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:44,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Six to seven or six to eight of the DS lights in the store had the cracks.

50
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:50,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them were hairline cracks that were developing, and some were just full-blown cracks.

51
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:54,004
[SPEAKER_08]: So that doesn't sound like .02% to me.

52
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:56,846
[SPEAKER_08]: So, food for thought.

53
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:09,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, speaking of other things, including the DS here, we've got a brand new game coming to the DS, which is actually kind of an interesting name.

54
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:09,895
[SPEAKER_08]: It's...

55
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:21,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Translates to Mario Nation Gears, and there's going to be 100 varieties of mechs, which not all of them will be simple two-legged robots.

56
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:30,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the machines will resemble insects, while some others transform the vehicles, and they'll have a variety of weapons, from bows to firearms.

57
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds very interesting.

58
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,131
[SPEAKER_08]: It says the game's going to be played in full 3D.

59
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:41,411
[SPEAKER_08]: The bottom screen is going to show the mech controls, which can be operated using the touch stylus.

60
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:51,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And, I don't know, very interesting, especially with this game also kind of with Mario Nation Gears, maybe a Mario-themed mech game?

61
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:54,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Mario has to be in everything!

62
00:04:54,915 --> 00:05:00,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, but yeah, I don't know, it's a different type of game, that's for sure.

63
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:01,877
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

64
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:02,763
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com.

65
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:30,260
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to have DS download stations at Toys R Us with six exclusive virtual gifts.

66
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,262
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get a one-up mushroom, a star, a fire bar.

67
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:35,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you love fire.

68
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:38,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Gold flag, a question box, and a pipe.

69
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:43,505
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can use this to decorate your virtual house and make all your internet friends jealous that you went to Toys R Us.

70
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:47,747
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get these downloads through July 29th at your Toys R Us.

71
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:49,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you going to do that, Dark Sakura?

72
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:51,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I might, just so that I can...

73
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:57,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to probably get rid of my bathroom that I'm building in my house and make a Nintendo room so that my HRA score goes up.

74
00:05:58,123 --> 00:05:59,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you ever rebuild your shrine to fire?

75
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:01,306
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I did not.

76
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:04,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a bathroom and I have a room with a bath in it.

77
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:06,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the outdoor bath.

78
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my huge-ass Japanese room.

79
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:10,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a classic room because I always make a classic room.

80
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:11,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a green room.

81
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:13,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Although the green room might be turned into a shrine to fire.

82
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, however, have the bonfire.

83
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I just haven't used it.

84
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:20,961
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

85
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:27,967
[SPEAKER_11]: For those that don't know, DarkSakura on the GameCube version of Animal Crossing had a shrine to fire that I always felt compelled to visit.

86
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:31,628
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the items was just a giant campfire, right?

87
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:32,648
[SPEAKER_05]: A big bonfire.

88
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:36,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you had all these drums that would play and all the little gyro thingies or whatever those are called.

89
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:38,329
[SPEAKER_05]: They would gyrate around it.

90
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:42,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Bowing down to the fire and the music was like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

91
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,631
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the Japanese festival music.

92
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Scary, scary stuff.

93
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:48,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had like Biwa Lutes in the back and yeah.

94
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:53,017
[SPEAKER_11]: HitStun says you should play Second Life and get a Shrine to Fire in Second Life.

95
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:56,139
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of those virtual world games.

96
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I've checked out briefly.

97
00:06:58,581 --> 00:06:59,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Email me a link to it.

98
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:07,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I think our buddies at All Games have something set up there, and I think our picture's in the game because of that.

99
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:09,848
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know if there's an Orange Lounge area.

100
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,169
[SPEAKER_11]: There should be.

101
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:13,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't we just kind of hang out in the All Games area, which is fine.

102
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:16,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Andrew.

103
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew's going to make us one.

104
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:18,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

105
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:18,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

106
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, let's keep it moving, I guess.

107
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:28,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I like Animal Crossing a whole lot, as you well know.

108
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So, guess what I'm all hyper and excited about?

109
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Dobutsu no Mori, the movie!

110
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:35,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray!

111
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:42,206
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who don't know what that means, it means Animal Forest, which was the Japanese name of Animal Crossing.

112
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually own that game, you know?

113
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:47,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the GameCube one in Japanese, but that's another story.

114
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:50,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was a Nintendo 64 game originally.

115
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:52,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally it was, yes.

116
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:53,608
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have the GameCube one.

117
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:54,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

118
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:58,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have the whole unlock disc thing.

119
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the reason I bought it was to help my reading skills go up.

120
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:05,271
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway.

121
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:09,733
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, they have released... There is a...

122
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:13,765
[SPEAKER_05]: A movie coming out.

123
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:16,648
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a cute trailer online.

124
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:29,099
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, if you want to go see the official website for it, it's at doubutsunomori-movie.jp I'll spell that out for people who don't know how.

125
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:34,123
[SPEAKER_05]: doubutsunomori-movie.jp

126
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:45,157
[SPEAKER_05]: slash index.html It has interactive content online and also the trailer is available online if you do not know how to read Japanese, guess.

127
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:49,340
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a quick follow-up on the Second Life thing.

128
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, All Gamesville actually was taken down.

129
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:56,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Funnydale says the guy who set it up had to delete the Arena Lounge from Second Life because he needed to save money.

130
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll just have to build it again!

131
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:04,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Except this time it'll be the Orange Lounge Megadome.

132
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,140
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, we'll have all games.

133
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Hordom, of course, as well.

134
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:10,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

135
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's very interesting.

136
00:09:14,702 --> 00:09:20,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Anywho, I was going to mention there's some actual new Wii pages that were on the Nintendo site.

137
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:22,804
[SPEAKER_08]: The official Nintendo site there.

138
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:26,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And Super Secret stuff was on there.

139
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:30,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, it's kind of funny because the Wii pages ended up being on there, but...

140
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:36,499
[SPEAKER_08]: We Music is a full-blown game for the Wii, which is pretty awesome.

141
00:09:55,205 --> 00:10:01,287
[SPEAKER_08]: And Wii Music, for those who might not remember, during E3 was kind of like that demo where you're conducting an orchestra.

142
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,188
[SPEAKER_08]: So, very interesting.

143
00:10:04,548 --> 00:10:14,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Among other things, of course, more information about the Wii Connect 24, and just kind of talking about some of the upcoming games, most of which were announced at E3.

144
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:20,433
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, if you want to check it out now, you can't because Nintendo pulled down the site and all the links.

145
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,954
[SPEAKER_08]: You know someone saved the cache file.

146
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:27,546
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but I do have screenshots, and I will hopefully upload them later.

147
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet!

148
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:30,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get to check this out yourself before they took it out?

149
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:35,730
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I got to check out the screenshots of the website.

150
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,310
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was interesting, though.

151
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:41,592
[SPEAKER_08]: To be honest, it wasn't anything that we hadn't already really known.

152
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:42,733
[SPEAKER_11]: No earth-shattering news.

153
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:45,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing new, no new games announced or anything like that.

154
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:48,635
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

155
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:53,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you are excited to get your chance to play the Wii, you might get your chance a little sooner than you thought.

156
00:10:54,629 --> 00:11:02,816
[SPEAKER_11]: According to Punk News, the Nintendo Fusion Tour this year, you know how Nintendo sponsors this tour, the music fest every year they take around the country?

157
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:04,898
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, didn't they have Evanescence one year, I want to say?

158
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'm on crack, I don't know.

159
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,801
[SPEAKER_11]: But they have different artists that do this.

160
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:12,744
[SPEAKER_11]: They're actually going to feature the Wii console at

161
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:16,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo Fusion, and you will be able to try the console for yourselves hands-on.

162
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:26,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully no five-hour lines like E3, but seeing as probably that many people that were in that line wouldn't be able to fit into a freaking arena, I don't know.

163
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:30,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully your chances will be much better to actually get a chance to play the Wii.

164
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:36,976
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're not feeling so hot about the bands, hey, go and you could play the Wii while the main band's on stage.

165
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:40,085
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, that is an awful lot of money just to play a Wii.

166
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,610
[SPEAKER_11]: So you really have to be a true Nintendo fanboy or fangirl to want to do that.

167
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,313
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, if you go, have fun and email us and tell us how it went for you.

168
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:52,155
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com

169
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:28,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, just about two weeks or so after the October 18th day.

170
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:36,898
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember how we were speculating October 18th would be the actual launch day for the Wii in the United States?

171
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:42,421
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes sense that there would be a two week delay until the Wii came out in the UK.

172
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:52,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I seem to remember we talked about some story on the show before, though, that supported a six-week delay for the UK, and that's why, because some release dates had leaked for the UK, like Red Steel or something.

173
00:12:53,381 --> 00:13:00,369
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to go back in the archives a few episodes, but that UK delay seems to shift...

174
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:05,007
[SPEAKER_11]: around when they bring up these different ideas for release dates?

175
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:20,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but to be honest though, November 3rd as the release date for Need for Speed Carbon sounds... I don't know, it sounds a little bit late to me, because I know Carbon's coming out in October in the United States.

176
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:30,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, if that were true, if that actually was the launch date for the UK, I would say that the 18th is pretty feasible for

177
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:35,478
[SPEAKER_08]: The United States, but right now it's just completely rumor-based.

178
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:47,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And even rumor-based based on saying that this date... I mean, because there are obviously titles that come out a week or two later than the release date, so... I don't know.

179
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting, nonetheless.

180
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:51,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to say so.

181
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:53,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as far as the release dates go...

182
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:57,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Release dates go.

183
00:13:57,418 --> 00:14:04,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually do have the list of release dates for the 28th in the UK, if anybody is interested.

184
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:10,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, I want to know, even though I don't live there, but I know our friends that live there want to know.

185
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:14,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Civ City Rome is coming out, Civilization IV Warlords.

186
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:28,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Field Commander, Formula 106, Juiced Eliminator, Pac-Man World 3 on the PC, Shin Megami Tensei, Siphon Filter, Dark Mirror, The Ant Bully, Tokyo Extreme Racer, and Tringo on Game Boy Advance.

187
00:14:31,624 --> 00:14:32,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, alright.

188
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:33,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

189
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:34,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the U.S.

190
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:39,186
[SPEAKER_08]: isn't getting much more stuff being released, but anyways...

191
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:40,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

192
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:44,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Tekken Dark Resurrection, which is going to be a pretty big game, of course.

193
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:47,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Painkiller Hell Wars is going to be coming out.

194
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:51,525
[SPEAKER_08]: So far, I think that game actually might be delayed again, but who knows.

195
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:55,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Civ IV Warlords for the PC.

196
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:57,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Civ City Rome also on the PC.

197
00:14:58,087 --> 00:14:59,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, I think, what was it?

198
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:03,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Ant Bully is coming out on the consoles and the portables.

199
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,270
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about it.

200
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,971
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a big, you know, blank space there until...

201
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:10,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the undead.

202
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:37,770
[SPEAKER_11]: You must be interested in Dead Rising too, though.

203
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, getting to kill zombies with anything you want.

204
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:41,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I love zombies.

205
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:43,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I especially love watching them.

206
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:44,875
[SPEAKER_11]: You are a zombie some days.

207
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:46,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Some days.

208
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:47,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen you in the morning.

209
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:49,057
[SPEAKER_05]: You have seen me in the morning.

210
00:15:49,097 --> 00:15:54,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like... It's like that scene in Shaun of the Dead where he's just getting up and stumbling to the door.

211
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:56,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that.

212
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:57,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that movie.

213
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:57,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So do I.

214
00:15:58,962 --> 00:16:00,983
[SPEAKER_11]: All righty, well, thank you for the release date news.

215
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:10,387
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I feel sometimes left out when we do release dates, because DarkSakura does them and Loki does them, so I'm going to figure out, like, what our third... You can do the Ugandan one.

216
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:12,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot to mention some stuff.

217
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:14,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to confirm a few things.

218
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:15,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sure.

219
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:18,750
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a rumor control, or not rumor control, retail radar thing.

220
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:21,432
[SPEAKER_08]: PS3 is not out until November 17th?

221
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:22,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said PS3.

222
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,608
[SPEAKER_08]: PS3 is in November.

223
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:50,109
[SPEAKER_11]: My bad.

224
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was really interesting.

225
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:56,875
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I got.

226
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,937
[SPEAKER_11]: As I was saying, I feel left out when it comes to release dates.

227
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:03,781
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to figure out what our third most listened to country is and do the release dates for there.

228
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:05,182
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's Australia.

229
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:07,084
[SPEAKER_05]: You should do the Australian release dates.

230
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,205
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll look into that.

231
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:12,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe I could rotate around some of the other countries that listen to us.

232
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:14,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, maybe we should start covering Japanese release dates.

233
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, that's not a bad idea.

234
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we could go back and forth or something.

235
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:18,722
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see what to do.

236
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:20,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to tutor you.

237
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:22,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, seriously.

238
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:24,788
[SPEAKER_11]: No, if we go there, then we're switching.

239
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:26,449
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can do Japanese release dates.

240
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:27,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll do UK release dates.

241
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:30,994
[SPEAKER_11]: That's easier for me because I've never taken a class.

242
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:33,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, we'll talk about that at our next staff meeting.

243
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:37,419
[SPEAKER_11]: For now, let's talk about what Microsoft might be talking about at their staff meetings.

244
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Blu-ray and what the hell they're going to be doing about it.

245
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:48,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, Major Nelson actually interviewed Amir Majidimur on his latest podcast, I suppose, or I'm sorry, blogcast, as he calls it.

246
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:56,432
[SPEAKER_11]: And his group, Amir's group at Microsoft, oversees the audio-video compression technologies and had something interesting to say about Blu-ray.

247
00:17:57,192 --> 00:18:14,891
[SPEAKER_11]: According to Majid Amir, Blu-ray moves the recording surface very close to the top layer of the disc, protected by just a very thin coating, and this makes maintaining the high reliability of discs during the actual manufacturing process much more difficult.

248
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:19,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this factor is a really big difference between Blu-ray and HD DVD.

249
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:30,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, HD DVD, like traditional DVDs, actually protects its data between two layers of protective plastic, above and below, thus making the manufacturing of the discs much more reliable.

250
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:35,739
[SPEAKER_11]: So, kind of interesting there, the differences between the two formats, because

251
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,620
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

252
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:45,849
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess when you look at them on an HDTV, there probably won't be a whole lot of difference, but it's hard for me to say when I haven't seen a lot of demos of Blu-ray.

253
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:52,676
[SPEAKER_11]: But we shall see if Sony's next format takes off or ends up going the way of UMD.

254
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:55,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been hearing not good about it, though.

255
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:56,729
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

256
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:57,190
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

257
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:04,554
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm thinking maybe it's just because it's easy to pick on Sony right now, but I try to keep some hope, but it gets harder and harder every day.

258
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:09,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, there's some actual funny stuff coming out here from EA.

259
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:15,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I should say an EA employee who admitted to releasing crappy games.

260
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:19,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I know EA is kind of a scapegoat here, but

261
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,961
[SPEAKER_08]: They do have a lot of games that are just ports, especially the next-gen stuff.

262
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:33,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember the Xbox 360 launch and how a lot of the games were just ports of the current-gen stuff with slightly more high-res graphics or whatever.

263
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:40,568
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, there's actually a YouTube video out there now that you can play.

264
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:43,869
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of interesting.

265
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:47,651
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit of a funny little thing there.

266
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:48,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out.

267
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:56,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, crappy games do not make us happy gamers.

268
00:19:57,302 --> 00:20:00,564
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we're not happy, we get ranty.

269
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:14,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you start us off with our favorite segment, the FUs of the week, DarkSakura.

270
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:17,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, it's so hot!

271
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:19,998
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to the hot!

272
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear sun, piss off.

273
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:33,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it to be dark, even more I want it to stay dry, and even more than that I want it to be a nice 72 degrees outside.

274
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:42,048
[SPEAKER_05]: With slight overcast, and, okay, maybe not dry, maybe a little touch of water in the air so that it doesn't hurt to breathe.

275
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:46,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried breathing outside, and it felt like I was breathing plaster.

276
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:48,691
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucked.

277
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:53,721
[SPEAKER_05]: So, an FU goes to our 113 degrees today.

278
00:20:56,183 --> 00:20:59,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Even worse that it's nighttime and 95 degrees.

279
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:02,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I had our thermostat set down to 70.

280
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:02,988
[SPEAKER_05]: It read 85.

281
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,151
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not right.

282
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:08,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Celsius, maybe.

283
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:12,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And a sub-FU to everyone who complains about the, quote, humidity, Rob.

284
00:21:12,996 --> 00:21:13,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, screw off.

285
00:21:13,677 --> 00:21:14,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Piss off.

286
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:16,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Piss off right back at you.

287
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not humid.

288
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:19,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

289
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:23,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to say F you to my cable being out.

290
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:26,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Or not my cable, but my internet being out at home.

291
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Comcast decided to take the crap because... Did you pay the bill?

292
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:30,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I paid the bill.

293
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:35,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, because that's why my internet stops working and my cable's fine.

294
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I didn't pay the bill.

295
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,100
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't make any sense at all.

296
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:45,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so yeah, that really sucks and I couldn't read.

297
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,831
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU of the week goes to Coldstone for being a diet's worst enemy.

298
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:59,272
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a victim of deliciousness, what can I say?

299
00:21:59,472 --> 00:21:59,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew!

300
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's been awfully quiet this segment.

301
00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:04,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Surely you have something for this.

302
00:22:04,774 --> 00:22:06,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hell yes.

303
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:11,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, I'm going to have to repeat that FU to the hot with a few things added on.

304
00:22:11,816 --> 00:22:14,877
[SPEAKER_12]: FU to the shitty air conditioner that is in our house.

305
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:21,663
[SPEAKER_12]: The temperature climbs up, air conditioner decides to take a shit, and it's only 95 degrees in the house.

306
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:23,584
[SPEAKER_10]: No wonder you're here tonight.

307
00:22:23,824 --> 00:22:25,085
[SPEAKER_10]: No wonder you're here tonight.

308
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:32,151
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's so hot, it has never been so hot in my house that my computer will not run games.

309
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:37,355
[SPEAKER_12]: My video card overheats and takes a shit, locks up the system within two minutes.

310
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

311
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:39,517
[SPEAKER_12]: It is that hot.

312
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,460
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you gonna do?

313
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,861
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

314
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:46,860
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to have to run to Target and get a room.

315
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,443
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I will spend the night in the lawn and sleep in sprinklers.

316
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:53,005
[SPEAKER_12]: That is the only course of action for me.

317
00:22:54,026 --> 00:22:54,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Gosh.

318
00:22:56,988 --> 00:22:58,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, good luck to you, sucker.

319
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,450
[SPEAKER_11]: End the angst.

320
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,011
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, yes, let's end the angst.

321
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:06,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's end the angst and get to our listeners, because they rock.

322
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:07,236
[SPEAKER_11]: We love our listeners.

323
00:23:07,557 --> 00:23:12,681
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have a segment that we've been doing for a couple weeks now called the Voicemails of the Week, and we'd love to get your feedback.

324
00:23:13,524 --> 00:23:14,245
[SPEAKER_11]: on different topics.

325
00:23:14,285 --> 00:23:19,608
[SPEAKER_11]: And last week's topic that we gave to you guys for the voicemails of the week was, are games too easy?

326
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:25,692
[SPEAKER_11]: We have two voicemails we want to play for you tonight, and here's the first feedback on the, are games too easy topic.

327
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:39,641
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Jack Monkey Upload, and basically answering your question of the week, and games back in the day were a lot cheaper to make, and you'd only have like two guys, two or three guys, and it would take them a couple months to make a game, and

328
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:47,017
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been most of their time making the game itself and the levels were like really easy to make and wouldn't take that much time.

329
00:23:47,838 --> 00:24:01,790
[SPEAKER_06]: But nowadays, the levels for like the new games are spent with like hundreds of maybe thousands of people and like a lot of them are artists that just maybe work on just the levels and some of them might only work on the end levels.

330
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And you spend like tens of millions of dollars on a game, you want everyone to play like the majority of the way through.

331
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:17,409
[SPEAKER_06]: because if most people only play through like half a million dollars worth of your game, then you might as well just spend half a million on it instead of spending 10 million.

332
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:32,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think this trend's also going to increase because next-gen games are getting really expensive, so you're going to see games that anybody can complete just so they'll get through the majority of it and see everything.

333
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:35,078
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's all I wanted to say.

334
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:37,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll listen to you guys this weekend.

335
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:38,144
[SPEAKER_11]: CopyCode

336
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:10,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I actually, at Classic Gaming Expo, I went to a panel for the guy who did... Oh, God, I can't remember the names.

337
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:18,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Who did, like, Combat, and Pac-Man, and Battlezone, and a lot of those old Atari classics.

338
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:26,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're basically saying about how they were expected to crank out as close to perfect versions of arcade games, and how...

339
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:30,692
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

340
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:54,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, though, that now, because we have such a greater capacity, a lot more does go into it.

341
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And you do have more people you gotta pay.

342
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:57,261
[SPEAKER_05]: It does cost more.

343
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:59,884
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, they have to make these levels cost-effective.

344
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:05,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, you know, they also have to think about the attention span of the average gamer today, too.

345
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:08,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Anders, you have a thought, too?

346
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:11,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, my take on it is, nowadays, you know...

347
00:26:12,162 --> 00:26:14,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Game making is a big business.

348
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:14,943
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like Hollywood.

349
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:19,924
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not so much that we're playing games anymore, it's that we're watching them, we're experiencing them.

350
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:22,704
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got to have the deep storyline, all that kind of stuff.

351
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:34,127
[SPEAKER_12]: You take how hard games like, say, Ghouls and Ghosts was, and then you compare it to, you know, this isn't a completely fair analogy, you compare it to Prey, which just came out.

352
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:36,908
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not so much you're playing a game anymore, you're playing a movie.

353
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:38,628
[SPEAKER_12]: So much went into it,

354
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:44,181
[SPEAKER_12]: and there's just one way that they want you to play through it so you experience the way that they want you to do it.

355
00:26:44,782 --> 00:26:48,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Now Prey is one of the most easy first person shooters that I've ever played in my life.

356
00:26:51,488 --> 00:27:02,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Which isn't saying much, but it's just there's one way that they want you to play it and usually it's the easiest way because they want you to finish it.

357
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:02,900
[SPEAKER_12]: They want you to

358
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:11,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Prey is also interesting when you talk about those big budgets and stories because it doesn't... I was talking about this in my review of the demo last week.

359
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:14,226
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no real cutscenes in Prey, at least it seems like.

360
00:27:14,286 --> 00:27:15,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything is very seamless.

361
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:17,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they took a cue from Half-Life 2.

362
00:27:17,347 --> 00:27:19,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, from Doom 3, really, in its engine.

363
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:22,149
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it all kind of comes back to that.

364
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:25,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of like the cinematic element games.

365
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:26,570
[SPEAKER_11]: I do too.

366
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Prey is a beautiful game.

367
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anyone ever play Berserk on Dreamcast?

368
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:29,931
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

369
00:27:31,031 --> 00:27:35,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say Berserk on Atari 2600 with the bouncy happy face, but no, I haven't played it.

370
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:45,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it came out before we got the anime over here, and I started actually picking up the fan subs after that and downloading manga scans just because it was like freaking playing through the anime.

371
00:27:45,938 --> 00:27:47,058
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so perfect.

372
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:48,599
[SPEAKER_05]: There was so much good.

373
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:51,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the games that give a more in-depth story.

374
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:59,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it has a lot of the action that you want, but at the same time, you're compelled to keep playing because the story is so good.

375
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:05,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's hear another voicemail from our second voicemail and last voicemail for tonight on this same topic.

376
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:08,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, Orange Island Radio?

377
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,481
[SPEAKER_00]: This is SpeedyF40 from Michigan.

378
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:13,043
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think about the video games getting harder.

379
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,044
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're getting harder.

380
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:17,385
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're getting less accessible for people.

381
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:20,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Like back when Pac-Man and stuff was out,

382
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:22,290
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

383
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:39,319
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton more objectives nowadays.

384
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And the controllers have so many more buttons on them.

385
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's easier to beat the game, they're just harder to play.

386
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,782
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think video games are now less accessible to the average person.

387
00:28:52,102 --> 00:28:53,802
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just easier to us because we're gamers.

388
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:54,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.

389
00:28:54,763 --> 00:28:54,983
[SPEAKER_00]: See ya.

390
00:28:57,923 --> 00:28:58,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

391
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:01,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of talking about the accessibility to everybody.

392
00:29:02,164 --> 00:29:02,824
[SPEAKER_11]: So what do you guys think?

393
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:05,485
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very valid point.

394
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:05,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

395
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:14,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think that's the point that Nintendo is trying to do with the Wii controller, trying to simplify things and make it to where it's more attractive.

396
00:29:15,647 --> 00:29:17,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in one degree, it's not as simple.

397
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:20,749
[SPEAKER_05]: To another degree, I think it's very simplifying.

398
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:23,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you move your hand, that's all you do.

399
00:29:24,411 --> 00:29:36,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that whole accessibility thing of being able to actually get into it, being able to pick up the controller and know what to do with it, I think that that's a lot of the issue that we have these days.

400
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:41,465
[SPEAKER_12]: and make it more accessible to people who don't have the patience to read the damn manual.

401
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:43,907
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people don't.

402
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:47,349
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you're going to have a hard time telling a non-gamer to read the manual.

403
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, that's bitter tech support coming through again.

404
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:57,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, thank you guys so much for the voicemails of the week and of course we don't always have enough time to play everything that we get but we do try to listen to all of the voicemails.

405
00:29:57,778 --> 00:30:02,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, we do listen to every single voicemail and we really appreciate you guys calling in.

406
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:03,602
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to leave us a voicemail, the number is 916-226-9067

407
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:06,757
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

408
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:26,534
[SPEAKER_11]: E.T.

409
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:26,674
[SPEAKER_11]: E.T.

410
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:26,754
[SPEAKER_11]: E.T.

411
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:26,854
[SPEAKER_11]: E.T.

412
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:26,934
[SPEAKER_11]: E.T.

413
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:55,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't let DarkSakura influence you.

414
00:30:55,197 --> 00:30:59,700
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to know what you think on this topic, so please call us anytime during the week and leave us a voicemail.

415
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of entities that suck...

416
00:31:03,183 --> 00:31:09,224
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like Sony's trying to make our friends over in the UK bend over and take it, just like they're doing for us.

417
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:22,506
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a notice that was out that both the 20GB and 60GB versions of the PlayStation 3 are going to be out in the UK, however not both of them on launch day.

418
00:31:23,106 --> 00:31:31,768
[SPEAKER_05]: They're working by consulting with some of the different merchandisers to basically set up the different SKUs for both.

419
00:31:32,388 --> 00:31:32,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Both items.

420
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:41,991
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a note that though it may not necessarily be both at launch.

421
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:47,853
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, there's a quote here from David Wilson for Sony UK saying that he actually doesn't know.

422
00:31:49,714 --> 00:31:56,156
[SPEAKER_05]: He explained that Sony has to face what the challenge would be of offering a choice without confusing the consumers.

423
00:31:56,576 --> 00:31:59,880
[SPEAKER_05]: meeting the needs of the retailers, etc., blah, blah, blah.

424
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:06,907
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they are actually saying, though, that for pre-ordering a PlayStation 3, it is going to be £150.

425
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:10,571
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a retail suggestion.

426
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:13,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll see.

427
00:32:14,054 --> 00:32:15,876
[SPEAKER_05]: That's expensive, man.

428
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:18,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, poor guys in the UK getting screwed on those prices.

429
00:32:19,526 --> 00:32:22,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Is their tax rates higher over there too?

430
00:32:22,228 --> 00:32:23,669
[SPEAKER_11]: They get double screwed, don't they?

431
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:33,674
[SPEAKER_05]: The final price is again, it's November 17th in Europe, 600 euros converting to 425 pounds in the UK.

432
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:36,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

433
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:48,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're going to need to make all the money that they can because according to an IBM engineer, he's making a comment about their chip yields for the cell processor and how hard it is to get these chips to

434
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:50,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Be made right.

435
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:56,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, he's saying that for every sheet that they press, 10-20% of them work.

436
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:57,960
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.

437
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:12,805
[SPEAKER_08]: And it costs, say for example, $1,000 to produce a wafer with 100 chips on it, and if only 10 or 20 of those are going to be working, that increases the cost of the system significantly.

438
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:14,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

439
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:15,886
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not very good.

440
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:18,187
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it

441
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:20,189
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

442
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going to see a lot of these consoles at launch?

443
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:44,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And is the launch even going to be happening when they say they are?

444
00:33:44,794 --> 00:33:48,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now, I think this story just barely missed the cut for tonight.

445
00:33:48,456 --> 00:33:53,419
[SPEAKER_11]: But I seem to remember reading somewhere that the PS3s have actually gone into production now at this point, finally.

446
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,521
[SPEAKER_11]: So, unfortunately, I don't have a lot more details than that.

447
00:33:56,561 --> 00:33:58,062
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, that's all you pretty much need to know.

448
00:33:58,082 --> 00:33:59,083
[SPEAKER_11]: PS3s are finally on their way.

449
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:02,645
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, you see that Sony's gearing up for this, you know.

450
00:34:04,006 --> 00:34:05,307
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people are starting to get nervous.

451
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:06,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, are they going to have enough time?

452
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:07,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now, okay, maybe they could do this.

453
00:34:08,752 --> 00:34:10,153
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

454
00:34:35,737 --> 00:34:40,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if the defect rate is 99%, you only get one chip per wafer, and it costs you $1,000.

455
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:46,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if 10-20% of the chips are working, that's pretty expensive.

456
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:51,363
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's assuming there's not going to be any glitches or whatever with this stuff.

457
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:52,464
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

458
00:34:53,484 --> 00:34:54,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not good, but you know what?

459
00:34:55,105 --> 00:34:59,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that they're going to be able to find some way to keep the costs down.

460
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:03,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, they know what they're doing, so we'll see.

461
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:07,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, you know I got a look at chat room going on here.

462
00:35:07,513 --> 00:35:11,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Blaze Revolution says it's 17.25% in the UK for the tax.

463
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:13,877
[SPEAKER_05]: That's vicious.

464
00:35:14,117 --> 00:35:14,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

465
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:15,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

466
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:23,524
[SPEAKER_11]: OL Army Eddie says $200 to pre-order a PS3 here and I know he's in Vancouver because I was talking about my recent vacation with him.

467
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:25,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see what else.

468
00:35:25,465 --> 00:35:29,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Blaze Revolution simply says push back the release date then go back and fix this crap.

469
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:32,530
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to do that, you know.

470
00:35:33,587 --> 00:35:35,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Raven's Dolphin says it's a rumor, Sky, a rumor.

471
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:41,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything's a rumor until they come out and say it, and they're not going to.

472
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:42,529
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know what?

473
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:45,709
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just find out when the launch happens, and we'll see what's going on.

474
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:47,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Here comes the doom and gloom, too.

475
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,730
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Anoush says, or I'm sorry if I pronounced that wrong.

476
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I always have to apologize for that.

477
00:35:51,611 --> 00:35:58,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Anoush says the end of Sony Core is close, and Quicksilver says I think Sony is screwed.

478
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:00,492
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's going to be the end of them.

479
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:02,013
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they're a huge company.

480
00:36:02,053 --> 00:36:03,213
[SPEAKER_08]: They still have Vegas.

481
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:10,240
[SPEAKER_08]: and the whole thing is they could come out with something really remarkable that we don't know about that they're just kind of keeping under wraps.

482
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,544
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is right now though, it's kind of just the trend where everyone's posting doom and gloom stories about them.

483
00:36:16,824 --> 00:36:20,807
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to know until we actually see the launch of what's going on because say for example...

484
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Laser in our chatroom says, no, Sony has a good plan, it's easier to just replace everything than it is to QA

485
00:36:44,976 --> 00:36:47,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember when all we had to worry about was disc read errors?

486
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:48,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Now look at all this shit.

487
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:59,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember back for the first PlayStation how you'd have to end up turning your system upside down or sideways because the laser mechanism wasn't aligned right?

488
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:00,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

489
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:02,550
[SPEAKER_05]: They started actually just selling replacement parts for $13.

490
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:08,595
[SPEAKER_12]: This might be it for Sony and PlayStation.

491
00:37:09,115 --> 00:37:09,456
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

492
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:10,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

493
00:37:10,356 --> 00:37:11,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I'd go that far.

494
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:20,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, we've been talking a lot about chips, and this is something interesting you can do to that chip inside your DS Lite.

495
00:37:20,749 --> 00:37:22,649
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how you can overclock your computer?

496
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:27,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, a Japanese gamer has figured out a way to overclock your DS Lite.

497
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:34,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, obviously, this is not an easy process, but if you want to check it out, you can head over to Engadget.

498
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:37,832
[SPEAKER_11]: They ran a story on July 19th on how to overclock your

499
00:37:38,271 --> 00:37:39,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo DS.

500
00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:41,774
[SPEAKER_11]: And this process will probably take you several hours.

501
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:52,683
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to open up your DS Lite, drill a hole in the side, solder several different areas on it, and make sure you don't touch too much of the bad areas that will break the whole damn thing.

502
00:37:53,264 --> 00:37:55,566
[SPEAKER_11]: And now this has been translated into English.

503
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:59,409
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to take a look at this, I believe the site is ndshotmod.com.

504
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,913
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course, remember, this would be violating your warranty.

505
00:38:05,154 --> 00:38:08,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice proof of concept, but what exactly is it supposed to accomplish?

506
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:09,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Homebrew.

507
00:38:10,577 --> 00:38:11,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Overclocking?

508
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:12,498
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just for homebrew stuff.

509
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

510
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:26,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Essentially what this hack will do, reports are saying, it will actually physically increase the speed of visuals and sound between 1.4 times and 1.7 times, which means it's pretty much unplayable.

511
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:31,447
[SPEAKER_11]: It's uncontrollable, high-pitched music, and rather a pain in the butt to be playing.

512
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:33,763
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is something you do.

513
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:35,644
[SPEAKER_11]: And you thought WarioWare got fast.

514
00:38:35,804 --> 00:38:38,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Only because you're like a hardcore hacker.

515
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:41,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the same type of person that would install Linux on a toaster.

516
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:42,586
[SPEAKER_11]: This is for you.

517
00:38:43,546 --> 00:38:44,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Have fun.

518
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:45,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Have fun.

519
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:48,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, VX, JSON, XB.

520
00:38:48,387 --> 00:38:49,387
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something he'd do, right?

521
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:53,148
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually I know several people who are engineers who do it.

522
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:59,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, I think the better hack that they had was for the original DS where you can actually make it as bright as a DS Lite.

523
00:39:00,994 --> 00:39:02,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Using a firmware upgrade.

524
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:07,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still plenty pleased with my Game Boy Advance and Afterburner.

525
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:09,141
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome.

526
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,704
[SPEAKER_05]: And speaking of awesome, I have another story.

527
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:20,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Cartoon Network has a new massively multiplayer online game coming out.

528
00:39:20,412 --> 00:39:29,739
[SPEAKER_05]: They're working with, I guess it's Grygon Entertainment, to make one that will have Blue, Ben 10, Mac, and the kids next door.

529
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:37,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love Kotaku because the writing is so honest and takes no prisoners.

530
00:39:39,654 --> 00:39:42,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically saying that it sounds like a formula for instant crap.

531
00:39:43,735 --> 00:39:48,536
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there's a couple... Toontown Online?

532
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:48,836
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

533
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:53,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Disney has a Toontown Online thing for... Stop distracting me!

534
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:54,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Shush!

535
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:55,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the ferret when we need it?

536
00:39:56,317 --> 00:39:56,917
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know.

537
00:39:57,677 --> 00:39:58,058
[SPEAKER_11]: He died.

538
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,278
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is going to be a free download.

539
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:05,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually... You'll have a subscription service.

540
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,104
[SPEAKER_05]: PeeWee's Playhouse Saved by the Bell Rock

541
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:44,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, I want to say Extra for Sister and Miklatov were watching Pee-Wee's Playhouse the other night and I kind of caught a little bit of it.

542
00:40:45,856 --> 00:40:46,757
[SPEAKER_11]: So freaking funny.

543
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:47,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously.

544
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,580
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the kind of crack we were fed as kids.

545
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,201
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

546
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:52,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

547
00:40:52,162 --> 00:40:53,523
[SPEAKER_11]: That show was badass.

548
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:54,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

549
00:40:55,065 --> 00:40:57,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember being so freaked out because what was the cowboy's name?

550
00:40:59,529 --> 00:40:59,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

551
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:02,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but it wasn't Lawrence Fisher in the play.

552
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:02,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it was.

553
00:41:03,258 --> 00:41:03,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Cowboy Bob?

554
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:06,579
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure someone in chat is yelling it right now.

555
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember being young and being freaked out by him.

556
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:08,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Cowboy Curtis.

557
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Cowboy Curtis.

558
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:11,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, DarkSakura.

559
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:14,983
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, I can't do the pajama party because I sleep in the nude.

560
00:41:17,264 --> 00:41:17,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

561
00:41:18,564 --> 00:41:22,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember being so traumatized by this when I was little.

562
00:41:23,266 --> 00:41:24,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really traumatized, just thinking it was...

563
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:26,547
[SPEAKER_11]: He's naked!

564
00:41:26,827 --> 00:41:33,971
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what fucking traumatized me about Pee-Wee Herman and all that stuff when I was little is the movie, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.

565
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:34,611
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.

566
00:41:34,631 --> 00:41:37,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you remember the scene when he gets in the truck and there's Large Marge?

567
00:41:38,053 --> 00:41:38,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

568
00:41:38,354 --> 00:41:38,954
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the story.

569
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:40,695
[SPEAKER_11]: And she does the face.

570
00:41:40,795 --> 00:41:43,937
[SPEAKER_11]: She does the face and it looked a lot like this.

571
00:41:43,957 --> 00:41:44,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Like this!

572
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:45,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah!

573
00:41:45,158 --> 00:41:45,758
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole thing.

574
00:41:45,978 --> 00:41:47,779
[SPEAKER_11]: It was dark and stormy.

575
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,700
[SPEAKER_11]: It scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.

576
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,861
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, my God.

577
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,291
[SPEAKER_11]: No wonder I came out so fucked up.

578
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:11,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Gameplay HD

579
00:42:39,738 --> 00:42:40,619
[SPEAKER_08]: GameplayHD knows what they're doing.

580
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:08,621
[SPEAKER_11]: This channel needs to make it big.

581
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,152
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like they know what they're doing with this network, and I'm very excited to see what comes of it.

582
00:43:32,472 --> 00:43:42,038
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a lot of us that feel like G4 was a joke, in its later years anyway, are going to be much happier by what GameplayHD is going to bring.

583
00:43:42,398 --> 00:43:43,559
[SPEAKER_11]: So, check it out.

584
00:43:43,979 --> 00:43:56,086
[SPEAKER_08]: So, basically this agreement right now with GameplayHD, like I said, includes the three circuits of the 2006 World Series of Video Games, the Land War Competition in Louisville, Kentucky, which is being held June 16th,

585
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:00,172
[SPEAKER_08]: DreamHack Land Party DreamHack Land Party DreamHack Land Party

586
00:44:23,393 --> 00:44:23,874
[SPEAKER_08]: PGR 3, Guild Wars

587
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:41,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

588
00:44:58,812 --> 00:44:59,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect!

589
00:44:59,612 --> 00:45:00,712
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we need!

590
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:02,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Is a game station run by a gamer?

591
00:45:02,793 --> 00:45:08,314
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think he runs it, but I don't remember exactly the relation, but I apologize, but I'm going off the top of my head.

592
00:45:08,354 --> 00:45:09,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have notes on that.

593
00:45:10,194 --> 00:45:17,875
[SPEAKER_08]: If you happen to get Dish Network and you have HD, the channel can be found on Dish Channel 9485.

594
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:18,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously?

595
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:19,816
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes me want to switch to satellite.

596
00:45:20,656 --> 00:45:21,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

597
00:45:22,056 --> 00:45:26,697
[SPEAKER_11]: The only reason is because I save on the internet by having the game on the internet through the same company.

598
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:27,710
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

599
00:45:55,523 --> 00:46:02,326
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be damned if it doesn't seem like every week we're hearing about some damn Wii button, Wii flap, Wii secret compartment that you can put your weed in.

600
00:46:02,906 --> 00:46:04,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what they're coming with.

601
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:04,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Your weed?

602
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:07,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Get it, huh?

603
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:09,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, get this.

604
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:17,072
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a new promo picture in the latest issue of Nintendo Power that seems to indicate that there is yet another damn Wii button.

605
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:24,874
[SPEAKER_11]: And it looks like it's some type of new Z button, kind of like the one that's on the GameCube's controller, like a little teeny shoulder thing.

606
00:46:25,414 --> 00:46:30,916
[SPEAKER_11]: No idea how the hell you're going to reach it because you'd have to have another thumb growing out of your thumb to hit it.

607
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:34,897
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe it's like a volume control for the internal speaker.

608
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:36,657
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a theory that's going around right now.

609
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:39,738
[SPEAKER_11]: But if that's going to be one you're supposed to frequently hit in the game,

610
00:46:40,305 --> 00:46:45,949
[SPEAKER_11]: That is going to be a pain in the ass, as if playing with a remote control is not going to be weird enough.

611
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:48,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I don't know, when I played at E3, it felt okay to me.

612
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:51,153
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't feel like the wrist cramp that it sounded like on paper.

613
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:53,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's just me that felt that way.

614
00:46:54,095 --> 00:46:54,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

615
00:46:54,936 --> 00:46:55,176
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

616
00:46:56,044 --> 00:46:58,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.

617
00:46:58,386 --> 00:47:01,108
[SPEAKER_11]: It's www.orangeloungeradio.com.

618
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:09,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Click on Interact With Us and you can call our show by calling username OrangeloungeRadio or by picking up the phone and dialing 916-226-9067.

619
00:47:09,795 --> 00:47:15,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Feel free to comment on anything that's been brought up throughout the show and we'd love to get your feedback and opinion.

620
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, I will ask before we open up the Skype line, are there any last minute stories we have from anyone tonight?

621
00:47:21,144 --> 00:47:22,105
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one.

622
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:22,585
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

623
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:23,325
[SPEAKER_05]: At least for me.

624
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:26,847
[SPEAKER_05]: The Luminous 2 soundtrack has been revealed.

625
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:31,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also like to thank Tiger Call for the link.

626
00:47:32,471 --> 00:47:44,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to be in Luminous 2, we have Beck, Black Tambourine, Black Eyed Peas, Pump It, Chemical Brothers, Star Guitar, Fatboy Slim, Gangster Trippin', The Go Team, Bottle Rocket, Gwen Stefani, Hollaback Girl, yay.

627
00:47:46,275 --> 00:47:51,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Ruba Stank, Born to Lead, Junior Senior, Take My Time, Missy Elliott, Lose Control, another blah.

628
00:47:52,057 --> 00:47:55,577
[SPEAKER_05]: And some random song by New Order, which New Order I can't go wrong with.

629
00:47:56,138 --> 00:47:57,198
[SPEAKER_11]: That is so weird.

630
00:47:57,738 --> 00:47:59,058
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a weird lineup.

631
00:47:59,178 --> 00:48:01,019
[SPEAKER_11]: But Luminous is definitely going mainstream.

632
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:02,839
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as Mondo Grosso is coming back, I'm cool.

633
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, those actually are going to be the ones with videos.

634
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, ones without videos are going to be Junkie XL, Breezer.

635
00:48:09,441 --> 00:48:10,302
[SPEAKER_05]: and Stigmato Inc.

636
00:48:10,362 --> 00:48:11,342
[SPEAKER_05]: with Reality Check.

637
00:48:11,362 --> 00:48:16,525
[SPEAKER_05]: And also there will be more tracks from the Japanese artists Mondo Grosso, Ken Ishii and Tech Writers.

638
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:17,445
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

639
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's go skypline.

640
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:20,367
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting a call.

641
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:25,789
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a couple calls have already come in that we've missed, but we want to get the Luminous 2 news out there.

642
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:26,390
[SPEAKER_11]: So call back.

643
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

644
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:28,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

645
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:31,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, it's Raven Stolfen.

646
00:48:31,512 --> 00:48:32,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Raven Stolfen.

647
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:33,013
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind, buddy?

648
00:48:33,753 --> 00:48:35,114
[SPEAKER_11]: The UMD.

649
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:37,135
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want to talk about with UMDs?

650
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:42,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about the UMD is dead because of BitTorrent.

651
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:44,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

652
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:45,498
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your theory there?

653
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:45,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

654
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:53,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned this before and I said that I've been getting all my movies and all my stuff on BitTorrent and this is what Sony should do.

655
00:48:53,903 --> 00:48:55,424
[SPEAKER_02]: They should put everything on BitTorrent.

656
00:48:56,244 --> 00:48:58,045
[SPEAKER_11]: So you basically admit that you steal your movies?

657
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:01,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is fine.

658
00:49:01,831 --> 00:49:02,651
[SPEAKER_11]: At least you're honest.

659
00:49:03,872 --> 00:49:09,575
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trying to say it makes you a bad person or whatever, but you're what the MPAA is not happy with right now.

660
00:49:11,857 --> 00:49:12,717
[SPEAKER_11]: So let me ask you this.

661
00:49:12,757 --> 00:49:14,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me turn around and ask you this.

662
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:17,560
[SPEAKER_11]: What would be a way that you would legitimately pay for movies?

663
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,922
[SPEAKER_11]: What would make you stop using BitTorrent and legitimately pay for movies?

664
00:49:22,103 --> 00:49:26,025
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably going to sound really cheesy as hell, but the Sony Connect service.

665
00:49:26,665 --> 00:49:29,587
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really think they've got a good model and I think it's going to work.

666
00:49:30,615 --> 00:49:36,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so on one hand you give Sony a little bit of shit for the UMD, but on the other hand you give them some props for the Sony Kinect.

667
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think they got a good plan going with this.

668
00:49:39,582 --> 00:49:50,431
[SPEAKER_02]: If they try to connect this with the Xbox Live model, but not like it, like charge little games for the PSP, and like movies, I think they really have something to go with, but that's just me.

669
00:49:52,234 --> 00:49:57,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it's interesting you bring up Xbox, because I'm waiting for the day when Xbox does this.

670
00:49:57,198 --> 00:50:05,385
[SPEAKER_11]: All they need is a bigger hard drive on that thing, and, you know, with the active downloads and everything, you could totally and easily download movies on that thing.

671
00:50:05,445 --> 00:50:07,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell, you can already download...

672
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:09,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, one more thing.

673
00:50:09,268 --> 00:50:09,808
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up?

674
00:50:36,994 --> 00:50:47,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surfing Singular.com and they have a little ringtone for The Internet is for Porn from Avenue Q. Why did that make you think of us?

675
00:50:49,261 --> 00:50:50,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's so random.

676
00:50:50,862 --> 00:51:00,006
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, and I'm going to purchase it soon so everyone that I walk down the street for my phone raises going, The Internet is really, really great for porn.

677
00:51:01,027 --> 00:51:01,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

678
00:51:01,707 --> 00:51:02,988
[SPEAKER_11]: We have some crazy listeners at OLR.

679
00:51:03,008 --> 00:51:04,729
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also one of her Cage Band songs.

680
00:51:05,283 --> 00:51:06,504
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, ages ago, ages ago.

681
00:51:06,924 --> 00:51:08,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, Raven Stolfen, thanks so much for the call.

682
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:09,905
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate your insight, all right?

683
00:51:09,925 --> 00:51:10,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good one.

684
00:51:10,725 --> 00:51:12,546
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope they don't come after you and sue you, okay?

685
00:51:13,306 --> 00:51:13,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they won't.

686
00:51:14,127 --> 00:51:15,767
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a pseudonym, not your real name.

687
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:20,749
[SPEAKER_05]: If they try to sue you, you can countersue them for invasion of privacy and for search without a warrant.

688
00:51:21,569 --> 00:51:22,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Dark Sakura.

689
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,130
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

690
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Legal advice from Orange Lounge Radio.

691
00:51:27,052 --> 00:51:27,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you go to law school?

692
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:38,202
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I've taken a lot of business law, but honestly, the people that were countersuing the RIAA and the MPAA were using those tactics for countersuits.

693
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:39,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to another call.

694
00:51:40,945 --> 00:51:42,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

695
00:51:42,106 --> 00:51:42,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

696
00:51:42,926 --> 00:51:44,087
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Legend of Zaku.

697
00:51:44,327 --> 00:51:44,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, buddy.

698
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:45,588
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

699
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:52,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the fact that, you know, seconding the whole UMD thing and the whole format wars as we'd like to see it.

700
00:51:53,314 --> 00:51:56,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, at the end of the day, you know it's going to hurt the consumer.

701
00:51:56,856 --> 00:51:58,598
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to stick with the DVD regardless.

702
00:51:59,478 --> 00:52:01,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Because no one's ready to shift, right?

703
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:06,943
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's ready to shift to a new format, especially when there's, like, God knows how many are already out there.

704
00:52:07,744 --> 00:52:10,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Should the PlayStation 3 have had a UMD slot?

705
00:52:11,082 --> 00:52:19,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it really, I, I don't know, I don't, then they'll be copying Nintendo and trying to, you know, trying to play a portable gaming system on a console.

706
00:52:20,104 --> 00:52:20,184
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

707
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:21,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they do with the Game Boy.

708
00:52:21,184 --> 00:52:22,224
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm talking about for movies.

709
00:52:22,744 --> 00:52:23,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for movies.

710
00:52:23,284 --> 00:52:24,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess.

711
00:52:24,504 --> 00:52:25,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaming is one thing.

712
00:52:25,364 --> 00:52:28,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I guess hypothetically, why not play the games too?

713
00:52:28,085 --> 00:52:28,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

714
00:52:29,345 --> 00:52:30,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, but then.

715
00:52:30,665 --> 00:52:32,006
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that copying Nintendo?

716
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:37,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they did it with the Game Boy, you know, the Game Boy player, the little device that, you know.

717
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I call it copying, I just call it smart.

718
00:52:41,615 --> 00:52:44,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Make your games playable on more systems or more and more places.

719
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:46,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, whatever.

720
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,200
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fine.

721
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,801
[SPEAKER_03]: But the bottom line is this.

722
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:54,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Hollywood is pretty much split on both formats.

723
00:52:54,726 --> 00:52:58,449
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like half is going to support, you know, HD DVD.

724
00:52:58,509 --> 00:52:59,830
[SPEAKER_03]: The other half is Blu-ray.

725
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:04,213
[SPEAKER_11]: The same thing happened with DVD and DivX, though, and look how long the war lasted.

726
00:53:04,954 --> 00:53:08,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, DivX got out and, you know, only lasted three years while DVD's still running.

727
00:53:08,817 --> 00:53:10,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Because DivX downright sucked.

728
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:14,585
[SPEAKER_11]: I really never got your opinion on how mobile gaming works.

729
00:53:37,922 --> 00:53:39,763
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's your take on mobile gaming?

730
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:43,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I can say a lot about mobile gaming.

731
00:53:43,265 --> 00:53:44,186
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not a big fan of it.

732
00:53:44,206 --> 00:53:44,826
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want to know?

733
00:53:45,387 --> 00:53:48,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, granted, I already started a job in the mobile gaming industry.

734
00:53:49,489 --> 00:53:50,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Make games that don't suck.

735
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:53,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've got licenses for stuff.

736
00:53:53,932 --> 00:54:00,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, don't put games that were built for PlayStations and stuff.

737
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:01,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't put those games on mobile.

738
00:54:01,857 --> 00:54:02,517
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't work.

739
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:05,339
[SPEAKER_03]: The game that I'm working on already sold a million.

740
00:54:05,379 --> 00:54:06,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on the Spanish version of it.

741
00:54:07,438 --> 00:54:08,138
[SPEAKER_11]: What is it, Bejeweled?

742
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:32,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the types of games that work on mobile because those are the type of people playing mobile games or uber casual gamers.

743
00:54:33,328 --> 00:54:35,689
[SPEAKER_11]: The gamer gamers have a DS or a PSP.

744
00:54:36,269 --> 00:54:36,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

745
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:42,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless they created some sort of cell phone similar, you know, exceeding the capabilities of the N-Gage.

746
00:54:43,633 --> 00:54:46,054
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had, you know, the marketing and hype to back it up.

747
00:54:46,114 --> 00:54:52,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the problem with the N-Gage is that it was a phone first, gaming system second, but yet it thought it was a gaming system first in the marketing.

748
00:54:52,517 --> 00:54:52,737
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

749
00:54:53,237 --> 00:54:54,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, two platforms in the N-Gage.

750
00:54:55,039 --> 00:55:01,684
[SPEAKER_03]: One is the proprietary one, which the games are based on, and also Java, if I recall correctly, Symbian.

751
00:55:01,704 --> 00:55:05,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were like, you know, it was three platforms, two of which were pretty open.

752
00:55:06,108 --> 00:55:07,529
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're working on the Spanish version of the game.

753
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:08,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Habla Español?

754
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:09,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.

755
00:55:10,151 --> 00:55:13,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, you know, I understand a lot more than I speak.

756
00:55:13,314 --> 00:55:15,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost my fluency when I came here.

757
00:55:15,356 --> 00:55:15,696
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

758
00:55:16,076 --> 00:55:18,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, buddy, we gotta let you go, but have a good one, okay?

759
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:19,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

760
00:55:19,439 --> 00:55:19,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, later.

761
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:23,058
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take one more call if you want to call us.

762
00:55:23,118 --> 00:55:25,701
[SPEAKER_11]: It's www.orangeloungeradio.com.

763
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:29,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Click on Interact With Us, or you can always pick up the phone, 916-226-9067.

764
00:55:30,324 --> 00:55:31,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and here comes a call.

765
00:55:32,146 --> 00:55:33,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

766
00:55:33,306 --> 00:55:33,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

767
00:55:35,028 --> 00:55:36,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, this is Eddie.

768
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:36,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Eddie.

769
00:55:36,989 --> 00:55:37,690
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

770
00:55:39,131 --> 00:55:43,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just wanted to comment on another part of the PSP.

771
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:43,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

772
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:44,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

773
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:53,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, what I'm really confused about is how Sony is doing this whole huge homebrew war on the PSP, right?

774
00:55:55,013 --> 00:56:05,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the PS3, they're now using Linux as their operating system on the PS3, which is kind of opening the door for homebrew.

775
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:12,938
[SPEAKER_07]: So why is it that they're battling homebrew on platform and then welcoming it with open arms on another?

776
00:56:13,447 --> 00:56:15,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to throw this to our homebrew expert.

777
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:16,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, do you have a thought on this?

778
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:19,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the PlayStation 3 is a computer.

779
00:56:22,533 --> 00:56:22,833
[SPEAKER_11]: So?

780
00:56:23,654 --> 00:56:24,194
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why.

781
00:56:24,294 --> 00:56:27,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Why does Sony have one policy here and another policy here?

782
00:56:27,316 --> 00:56:36,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm sure that they're thinking that their bases are covered with the PlayStation 3 and the fact that the PlayStation 3 needs all the help it can get to sell.

783
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:37,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Well...

784
00:56:38,516 --> 00:56:42,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but how long before a Nintendo emulator comes out for the PS3?

785
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:43,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Two days.

786
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:46,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, exactly then.

787
00:56:46,999 --> 00:56:53,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Then shouldn't, like, when that happens, shouldn't, like, Sony be battling that too?

788
00:56:53,963 --> 00:56:58,386
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a lot harder for them to do since they're using Linux.

789
00:56:58,426 --> 00:57:04,651
[SPEAKER_08]: If I remember correctly, they can also boot into other operating systems.

790
00:57:05,031 --> 00:57:09,314
[SPEAKER_08]: They're even saying they can maybe install Windows or OSX or something on there.

791
00:57:09,334 --> 00:57:11,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

792
00:57:11,576 --> 00:57:17,940
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be hard to regulate unless they have some sort of crippled version of Linux on there that doesn't allow certain things to run or something.

793
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how they're going to do that.

794
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:22,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, PS3 version running Windows.

795
00:57:22,563 --> 00:57:23,464
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be the day.

796
00:57:24,036 --> 00:57:25,036
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be the great irony.

797
00:57:26,637 --> 00:57:28,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, that's all I wanted to say.

798
00:57:29,477 --> 00:57:30,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, thank you very much for the call.

799
00:57:31,058 --> 00:57:33,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good one, and we'll see what happens with Sony's policy.

800
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:39,700
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of think the gimped version of Linux is a more... I think that's kind of what we're looking at is the reality of what's going to happen.

801
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:40,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I guess so.

802
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:41,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

803
00:57:42,181 --> 00:57:43,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, not a problem.

804
00:57:43,341 --> 00:57:43,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for the call.

805
00:57:46,082 --> 00:57:48,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, sorry, I'm trying to fix my mouse here.

806
00:57:48,242 --> 00:57:51,823
[SPEAKER_11]: The batteries just died during that call there, so I'm trying to

807
00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:53,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Get reorganized here.

808
00:57:53,626 --> 00:57:54,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.

809
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,727
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

810
00:57:56,767 --> 00:57:58,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys so much for calling in.

811
00:57:58,328 --> 00:57:59,509
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate your insight.

812
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:04,691
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you didn't get through tonight, or if you were that person that had connection problems, you can always leave us a voicemail.

813
00:58:05,092 --> 00:58:05,812
[SPEAKER_11]: We love voicemails.

814
00:58:06,652 --> 00:58:11,215
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can listen earlier in the show if you want to see how to leave us a voicemail of the week and what our topic is this week.

815
00:58:11,735 --> 00:58:13,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Any more last-minute stories, folks?

816
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:13,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

817
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:14,697
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Loki, what's up?

818
00:58:15,077 --> 00:58:16,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, a couple things about the Wii.

819
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:18,319
[SPEAKER_08]: As I mentioned in the story before...

820
00:58:19,835 --> 00:58:49,547
[SPEAKER_08]: well before about the secret pages on the Wii I did find those finally someone had them on file share or let's see here we've got a few things with of course they're saying the Nintendo Wi-Fi service is going to be free just like it is for the DS and they were saying you know of course the frame code system and that type of thing what I also found was interesting they renamed WarioWare to WarioWare Dojo now instead of Brawl

821
00:58:50,714 --> 00:58:51,474
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of neat.

822
00:58:51,975 --> 00:58:52,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Or not WarioWare.

823
00:58:54,076 --> 00:58:54,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Smash Brothers.

824
00:58:55,317 --> 00:58:56,137
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell am I talking about?

825
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:00,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, on top of that, that wasn't the most neat thing I found.

826
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:09,766
[SPEAKER_08]: There was kind of an interview in GamePro with the people behind Red Steel.

827
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were talking about the multiplayer.

828
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:17,150
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically the creative director, Nicholas Eppert,

829
00:59:17,697 --> 00:59:20,418
[SPEAKER_08]: He had this to say about the multiplayer.

830
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:22,478
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, You'll have up to four players.

831
00:59:22,738 --> 00:59:29,040
[SPEAKER_08]: If they play together in split screen, we can only say that the fight will not only be on screen.

832
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:35,081
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's maybe either referring to the fact that six people on the couch flailing about.

833
00:59:35,461 --> 00:59:38,562
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be very difficult to do in that kind of environment.

834
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:44,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Or that there's going to be some sort of different type of multiplayer in room or something.

835
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:53,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Games on Mario Party Wii are about to get very violent in this house because Mario Party, as it is, is a cutthroat competition around these parts.

836
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Mario Party Wii is just begging for violence.

837
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,782
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be sad.

838
00:59:58,822 --> 01:00:05,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that my mouse works again, I was reading some comments there in chat room and Blackboy commented, I need OSX on my PS3.

839
01:00:06,825 --> 01:00:10,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of a shout out to an old operating system that some folks have forgot about.

840
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:12,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the same Blackboy I met at Arena once?

841
01:00:12,906 --> 01:00:14,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if it is.

842
01:00:14,427 --> 01:00:14,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, buddy.

843
01:00:16,385 --> 01:00:16,886
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

844
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:41,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, that's not too much, not a big surprise.

845
01:00:41,611 --> 01:00:50,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I think we talked about this last week, about how the Xbox 360 is possibly going to get a bundle with Project Gotham Racing 3, a 1,250 point card, and three month...

846
01:00:56,142 --> 01:00:57,603
[SPEAKER_08]: of Xbox Live Gold.

847
01:00:57,703 --> 01:00:59,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's sort of been confirmed.

848
01:01:00,045 --> 01:01:03,547
[SPEAKER_08]: It's starting to appear in retailers' computers now.

849
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:08,191
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the PGR3 bundle in Toys R Us computer.

850
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:19,999
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being sold for about the same price as a premium system and also was confirmed to be... Let's see, that was in a Canadian Toys R Us.

851
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently there's another chain called BJ's.

852
01:01:25,129 --> 01:01:30,071
[SPEAKER_08]: that's going to be carrying it in Circuit City's flyer in the newspaper.

853
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:35,313
[SPEAKER_08]: They show the price for $489.99 US for the Project Gotham Racing 3 bundle.

854
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:41,516
[SPEAKER_08]: It says it includes a pro console, a second wireless controller, play and charge kit, and a copy of PGR3.

855
01:01:41,556 --> 01:01:45,177
[SPEAKER_08]: But that sounds more like a bundle that's being done through that site.

856
01:01:46,038 --> 01:01:48,339
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently online they have the same type of thing.

857
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:52,441
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's like a $30 off web deal or something.

858
01:01:52,461 --> 01:01:52,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

859
01:01:53,321 --> 01:01:53,461
[SPEAKER_08]: But

860
01:01:54,028 --> 01:01:55,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that may be coming soon?

861
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:55,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

862
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,171
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll probably find out pretty soon.

863
01:01:59,474 --> 01:02:00,875
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just reading in chat right now.

864
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:07,162
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Jinai said, I downloaded the Paris Hilton game and PKAcura88 goes, get out.

865
01:02:07,702 --> 01:02:11,306
[SPEAKER_11]: And PK, somebody said something and PKAcura88 says, no, I mean, get off my internet.

866
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:14,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Aw.

867
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Harsh folks in chat room.

868
01:02:17,857 --> 01:02:20,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I got a question for you because you were just talking about Project Gotham.

869
01:02:20,259 --> 01:02:26,643
[SPEAKER_11]: So speaking of racing games, somebody was sending me a private message, I think it was CKY Mike, asking about Burnout 5 on PS3.

870
01:02:26,703 --> 01:02:28,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you heard anything about Burnout?

871
01:02:28,324 --> 01:02:29,625
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's probably coming out in the fall.

872
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:31,086
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be my guess.

873
01:02:31,466 --> 01:02:32,847
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is coming for PlayStation 3?

874
01:02:33,448 --> 01:02:34,529
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure they're... Yes, it's a given.

875
01:02:34,569 --> 01:02:36,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, duh, they're coming out with another Burnout game.

876
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,811
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's going to be Burnout something.

877
01:02:38,932 --> 01:02:40,673
[SPEAKER_08]: It is coming out probably in the fall.

878
01:02:41,653 --> 01:02:42,634
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of a given.

879
01:02:42,694 --> 01:02:45,196
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like saying, oh yeah, next year Madden 08's coming out.

880
01:02:45,776 --> 01:02:46,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on, that's...

881
01:02:47,952 --> 01:02:49,033
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a big surprise.

882
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:55,015
[SPEAKER_08]: But my guess, if anything, it would be probably coming out in March-ish.

883
01:02:55,135 --> 01:02:57,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's when the Xbox 360 one came out last year.

884
01:02:58,537 --> 01:03:04,260
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously it's not coming out in September like it did last year for the current gen stuff.

885
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,362
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I were to guess, I'd say March, probably for Burnout.

886
01:03:09,402 --> 01:03:10,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there's a lot of stuff.

887
01:03:11,023 --> 01:03:13,424
[SPEAKER_08]: September is going to be a packed month for games.

888
01:03:13,804 --> 01:03:15,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And October is even worse.

889
01:03:16,878 --> 01:03:20,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy XII crack, finally coming in October.

890
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:22,080
[SPEAKER_08]: You won't see me for a week.

891
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,360
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting pushed more and more towards November.

892
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,320
[SPEAKER_08]: God damn them.

893
01:03:26,061 --> 01:03:27,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's coming at Halloween.

894
01:03:27,921 --> 01:03:29,681
[SPEAKER_11]: How much further back can you push to November?

895
01:03:30,002 --> 01:03:30,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

896
01:03:31,422 --> 01:03:37,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear to God, Squeenix, if you rob me of Final Fantasy for another year, I am... It's not going to be pretty.

897
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:39,504
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to stomp and pout.

898
01:03:39,784 --> 01:03:43,785
[SPEAKER_11]: I will stomp and pout in front of the Squeenix building, and there will be video on YouTube.

899
01:03:44,065 --> 01:03:44,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

900
01:03:44,918 --> 01:03:49,199
[SPEAKER_08]: All it comes down to me is just Saints Row and fucking Dead Rising.

901
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:51,200
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be my games for August.

902
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:57,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know, there's a lot of games coming out in August, but a lot that I don't want, like Bomberman Act Zero.

903
01:03:57,322 --> 01:04:00,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it looks like Bomberman.

904
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:03,066
[SPEAKER_08]: So that could be kind of fun.

905
01:04:07,189 --> 01:04:10,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I found out I gotta buy cars on the 360 for Nelly.

906
01:04:10,692 --> 01:04:14,494
[SPEAKER_08]: For achievement points?

907
01:04:15,055 --> 01:04:17,116
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but she wants that game.

908
01:04:17,196 --> 01:04:18,717
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with Nelly getting into games lately?

909
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:23,080
[SPEAKER_11]: You've talked about her playing Bejeweled, cloning Clyde, now she wants to play Cars.

910
01:04:23,301 --> 01:04:25,302
[SPEAKER_11]: She wants me to buy Elite Beat Agents for her.

911
01:04:25,382 --> 01:04:27,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Is she slowly becoming a gamer?

912
01:04:27,283 --> 01:04:27,403
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

913
01:04:27,504 --> 01:04:28,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this marriage thing corrupting her?

914
01:04:28,925 --> 01:04:29,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

915
01:04:29,245 --> 01:04:29,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

916
01:04:30,932 --> 01:04:32,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think she'll be into the Wii?

917
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:34,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

918
01:04:34,354 --> 01:04:36,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say anything.

919
01:04:37,757 --> 01:04:38,818
[SPEAKER_08]: You shut your mouth.

920
01:04:39,238 --> 01:04:41,340
[SPEAKER_08]: You shut your mouth.

921
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,942
[SPEAKER_11]: From my experience, she's very into the Wii.

922
01:04:45,383 --> 01:04:46,323
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you all.

923
01:04:47,825 --> 01:04:49,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I want this show to end now.

924
01:04:49,065 --> 01:04:50,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

925
01:04:51,227 --> 01:04:52,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrew, thanks so much for sitting in tonight.

926
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:54,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though you were a little quiet, that's alright.

927
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:55,991
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate your insight.

928
01:04:57,232 --> 01:04:58,833
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate you leaving the bad jokes at the door.

929
01:04:59,879 --> 01:05:00,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, really?

930
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:01,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

931
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

932
01:05:03,741 --> 01:05:04,102
Whee!

933
01:05:06,283 --> 01:05:06,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

934
01:05:06,623 --> 01:05:07,924
[SPEAKER_11]: My eardrums are still ringing.

935
01:05:09,084 --> 01:05:10,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, your final thought?

936
01:05:10,145 --> 01:05:11,146
[SPEAKER_08]: It's freaking hot in here.

937
01:05:11,426 --> 01:05:13,067
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm, like, sweating just sitting here.

938
01:05:13,087 --> 01:05:15,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm trying to end the show so we can get out of here.

939
01:05:15,528 --> 01:05:17,249
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

940
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:19,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Reject false icons and poo on the sun.

941
01:05:20,771 --> 01:05:27,215
[SPEAKER_11]: And my final thought is... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

942
01:05:28,803 --> 01:05:30,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a great week, everybody.

943
01:05:30,065 --> 01:05:30,866
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you next time.

944
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,191
[SPEAKER_11]: and Bobby.

945
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:48,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring it, Bobby.

946
01:05:48,932 --> 01:05:50,794
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's the only thing about Chromounds Online.

947
01:05:51,194 --> 01:05:57,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if they actually just have multiplayer, like standard multiplayer, not that online, perpetual online thing.

948
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:00,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta check that out, because I haven't really delved into the multiplayer that much.

949
01:06:01,504 --> 01:06:04,908
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be fun, though, an inter-show battle royale.

950
01:06:05,188 --> 01:06:06,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm all for that.

951
01:06:06,269 --> 01:06:11,254
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm all for an inter-show battle royale at some point on one of those games and stuff, and

952
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:17,012
[SPEAKER_11]: We've talked about doing a tournament thingy using all game, but we'll save that for another show.

953
01:06:17,152 --> 01:06:18,233
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to end tonight's show.

954
01:06:19,013 --> 01:06:20,013
[SPEAKER_11]: So have a great night.

955
01:06:20,673 --> 01:06:23,435

01:06:27,496 --> 01:06:28,496
