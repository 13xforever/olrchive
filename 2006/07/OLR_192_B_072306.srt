18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,360
video games and get right back into the news. Who's starting us off tonight?

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
That would be me.

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,880
All right, Queen Dark Sakura, what's up?

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Hell yeah.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,600
Actually, we've got some good news for our European listeners.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,960
Actually, it's also good news for our American listeners.

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,600
There was a release from Nintendo of America stating that there was a small number of DS

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,240
lights that had a crack in the casing on the left-hand side of the hinge, and it's just

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,600
above the power connector, and it's like 0.02% of the units have it, so they're fixing those

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
for free.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,000
Nintendo of Europe basically has announced that any faulty DS lights will

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,760
be repaired for free as long as the fault in question is covered under the

30
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,720
valid warranty. So basically they're saying that if you have a problem with

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,920
it you need to contact the local customer service area for a

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,680
Nintendo. The DS lights carry a one-year warranty for manufacturing defects. If

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,280
it's covered under the warranty it will be repaired for free. So if you live in

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,680
the UK the number to call for Nintendo's customer service and I have no idea how

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:35,120
the phone numbers work at 0 8 7 0 6 0 6 0 2 4 7 open 8 30 to 7 p.m. at national

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,360
rate you can also email at Nintendo service center at codestorm.co.uk and

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,960
that center spelled American way I think yeah um it's the whole my DS is on crack

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,840
saga is very interesting what's been going on with this because the Nintendo

39
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,060
kind of first came out and said it's not a problem but then just a couple days

40
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,960
later they kind of did this and not just in the UK but I know they got something

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,940
similar going on in the US as well both the DS lights I've seen on miklotov has

42
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,200
one of my roommate extrovert has one and they're not cracking yet so neither yeah

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,600
oh that's right you got one too it doesn't seem like it's this huge

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,600
epidemic but it's very interesting that Nintendo is kind of listening to the

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:21,040
internet buzz and kind of saving their ass from internet skewing left and right.

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
It's kind of interesting.

47
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
It's good customer service.

48
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,640
Well, they might actually be skewing the numbers of how many DS lights are cracked.

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,640
For example, this was pointed out actually by Max Consul Reader, there's a photo taken

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,160
at the New York City flagship Nintendo World Store and guess what?

51
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,620
Six to seven or you know six to eight of the DS lights in the store had the cracks.

52
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,640
Some of them were hairline cracks that were developing and some were just full blown cracks.

53
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,600
So that doesn't sound like.02% to me.

54
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,680
So food for thought.

55
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,920
Anyways speaking of other things including the DS here we've got a brand new game coming

56
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:13,600
to the DS which is actually kind of an interesting name. It translates to Mario Nation Gears

57
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:21,200
and there's going to be 100 varieties of mechs which not all of them will be simple two legged

58
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,960
robots. Some of the machines will resemble insects while some others transform the vehicles

59
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,680
and they'll have a variety of weapons from bows to firearms. Sounds very interesting

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,320
It says the game is going to be played in full 3D, and the bottom screen is going to

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,880
show the mech controls, which can be operated using the touch stylus.

62
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,920
And I don't know, very interesting, especially with this game, also kind of with Mario Nation

63
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,600
Gear, maybe a Mario themed mech game, that's kind of...

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,720
Because Mario has to be in everything!

65
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,920
Exactly, but yeah, I don't know, it's a different type of game, that's for sure.

66
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,420
All right, well we go from a new DS game to a classic DS game, or what's quickly becoming

67
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,940
a classic, Animal Crossing Wild World.

68
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,860
I don't know, I got a little sick of this game a while ago, but I know some folks still

69
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,420
play the hell out of it.

70
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,420
Dark Sakura.

71
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,020
Hey, it's because my friends play it.

72
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,900
Nothing wrong with that, it's a fun game.

73
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,780
And guess what, maybe some new life coming very soon to Animal Crossing Wild World, thanks

74
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,100
to your local Toys R Us.

75
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,740
They're going to have DS download stations at Toys R Us with six exclusive virtual gifts.

76
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:37,380
You can get a one up mushroom, a star, a fire bar, I know you love fire, gold flag, a question

77
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,920
box and a pipe.

78
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,400
And you can use this to decorate your virtual house and make all your internet friends jealous

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,900
that you went to Toys R Us.

80
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,700
You can get these downloads through July 29th at your Toys R Us.

81
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,860
Are you going to do that, Dark Sakura?

82
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,060
I might, just so that I can, I'm going to probably get rid of my bathroom that I'm building

83
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,180
in my house and make a Nintendo room so that my HRA score goes up.

84
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,300
Did you ever rebuild your shrine to fire?

85
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
No, I did not.

86
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,140
I have a bathroom and I have a room with a bath in it.

87
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,300
I have the outdoor bath.

88
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,500
I have my huge-ass Japanese room.

89
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,220
I have a classic room, because I always make a classic room, and I have a green room, although

90
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,820
the green room might be turned into a shrine to fire.

91
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,980
I do, however, have the bonfire.

92
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,380
I just haven't used it.

93
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,900
All right.

94
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,140
Yeah, now for those that don't know, Dark Sakura on the GameCube version of Animal Crossing

95
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,780
had a shrine to fire that I always felt compelled to visit.

96
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,480
One of the items was just a giant camp fire, right?

97
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
That was a big bonfire.

98
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,240
And then you had all these drums that would play, and all the little gyro thingies, or

99
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,300
whatever those are called, that would gyrate around...

100
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,780
Bowing down to the fire, and the music was like...

101
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,880
It was the Japanese festival music.

102
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Scary.

103
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Scary stuff.

104
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
And they had like biwa loots in the back.

105
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,600
Hitstun says you should play Second Life and get a Shrine of Fire in Second Life.

106
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I've thought about it.

107
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,760
It's one of those virtual world games.

108
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,480
I've checked out briefly.

109
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
I need to...

110
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,000
to it. Okay. Jimmy at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. I know, I think

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,780
our buddies at All Games have something set up there and I think our pictures in

112
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,840
the game because of that

113
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,320
but I don't know if there's an Orange Lounge area. Maybe I should be.

114
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,160
Well, we just kinda hang out in the All Games area, which is fine.

115
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,320
Oh, thank you Andrew. Andrew's gonna make us one. Alright.

116
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,020
Anyway, um, let's keep it moving I guess.

117
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,800
Well, I like Animal Crossing a whole lot

118
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,740
you well know

119
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,740
So, uh, guess what? I'm all hyper and excited about

120
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:39,140
double to know Marie the movie hooray for those who don't know what that means it means animal forest which was

121
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,500
The Japanese name of Animal Crossing. I actually own that game, you know, I have the GameCube one in Japanese

122
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,100
But that's another story. Um, I thought it was a Nintendo 64 game originally originally it was yes

123
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:58,820
Oh, but I have the GameCube one gotcha because I have the the whole unlock disk thing

124
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,540
And actually the reason I bought it was to help my help my reading skills go up

125
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,340
but anyway, um, but yeah, they have released there is a a

126
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,300
Movie coming out. It's got a cute trailer online

127
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,420
In fact, if you want to go see the official website for it

128
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,660
it's at Doubutsu no Mori dash movie dot JP

129
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,220
I'll spell that out for people who don't know how

130
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,180
D-O-U-B-U-T-S-U-N-O-M-O-R-I

131
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,980
dash movie dot JP slash index dot HTML

132
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,220
it has interactive content online and also the trailer is available

133
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,500
online if you do not know how to read Japanese

134
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,900
guess I have a quick follow up on the Second Life thing apparently all

135
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,420
gamesville actually was taken down funnydale says the guy who set it up had

136
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,700
to delete the arena lounge from second life because he needed to save money

137
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,820
cry so well we'll just have to build it again

138
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,020
except this time it'll be the orange lounge mega dome but you know

139
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,420
we'll have all games make it boredom of course as well

140
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:16,140
yeah well that's that's very interesting but um anywho um

141
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,340
I was going to mention there were some actual new Wii pages that were on the Nintendo site,

142
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,220
the official Nintendo site there, and super secret stuff was on there.

143
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,540
Of course, it's kind of funny because the Wii pages ended up being on there, but they

144
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,020
weren't finished yet.

145
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,740
And so, yeah.

146
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,860
But basically what we found out is that, of course, the Wii is going to be using the same

147
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:48,300
friend codes that we all love to hate on the DS, so that was very interesting, as well

148
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:55,220
as Wii Music is going to be a full blown game for the Wii, which is pretty awesome. And

149
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,940
Wii Music for those who might not remember during E3 was kind of like that demo where

150
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:07,500
you're conducting the orchestra, so very interesting. Among other things, of course, more information

151
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,960
about the Wii Connect 24, and just kind of talking about some of the upcoming games,

152
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,760
most of which were announced at E3.

153
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,120
But of course, if you want to check it out now, you can't because Nintendo pulled down

154
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,960
the site and all the links.

155
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,560
You know someone saved the cache file.

156
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,880
No, but I do have screenshots, and I will hopefully upload them later.

157
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Sweet!

158
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,680
Did you get to check this out yourself before they took it out?

159
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,820
No, I got to check out the screenshots of the website.

160
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,140
So it was interesting though, to be honest it wasn't anything that we hadn't already

161
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,140
really known.

162
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,140
No earth-shattering news.

163
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,340
Nothing new, no new like games announced or anything like that, so.

164
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:52,620
Alright, well if you are excited to get your chance to play the Wii, you might get your

165
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,620
chance a little sooner than you thought.

166
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,840
According to Punk News, the Nintendo Fusion Tour this year, you know how Nintendo sponsors

167
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,220
this tour, the music fest every year they take around the country, I think didn't they

168
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,560
have Evanescence one year I want to say?

169
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,760
Maybe I'm on crack, I don't know, but they have different artists that do this.

170
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,780
They're actually going to feature the Wii console at Nintendo Fusion, and you will be

171
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,740
able to try the console for yourselves hands-on.

172
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,100
Hopefully no five-hour lines like E3, but seeing as probably that many people that were

173
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,360
in that line wouldn't be able to fit into a freaking arena, I don't know, hopefully

174
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,720
your chances will be much better to actually get a chance to play the Wii.

175
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,220
So if you're not feeling so hot about the bands, hey, go and you can play the Wii while

176
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,200
the main bands on stage, but then again, that is an awful lot of money just to play a Wii,

177
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,380
so you really have to be a true Nintendo fanboy or fangirl to want to do that.

178
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,740
But hey, if you go, have fun and email us and tell us how it went for you.

179
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,740
Exactly.

180
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,100
And it's kind of funny, though, about the whole Wii thing.

181
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:03,020
Actually, there was reports that EA had leaked the release date for the Wii in the UK.

182
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,500
And well the date ends up being November 3rd, 2006.

183
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,020
And this was attached to the game Need for Speed Carbon which was posted as I guess a

184
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,220
launch title.

185
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:23,520
What's interesting though is that happens to be about, oh I don't know, just about two

186
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,820
weeks or so after the October 18th day.

187
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:36,000
And remember how we were speculating October 18th would be the actual launch day for the

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Wii of the United States.

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,480
It makes sense that there would be a two-week delay until the Wii came out in the UK.

190
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,880
I seem to remember we talked about some story on the show before, though, that supported

191
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,200
a six-week delay for the UK, and that's why some release dates had leaked for the

192
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,400
UK, like Red Steel or something.

193
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:01,720
You have to go back in the archives a few episodes, but that UK delay seems to shift

194
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,080
around when they bring up these different ideas for release dates.

195
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:12,400
I don't know, but to be honest though, November 3rd as the release date for Need for Speed

196
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:19,100
Carbon sounds, I don't know, it sounds a little bit late to me, because I know Carbon's coming

197
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,080
out in October in the United States.

198
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:32,080
I don't know, if that were true, if that actually was the launch date for the UK, I would say that the 18th is pretty feasible for the United States.

199
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:46,080
But right now it's just completely rumor based, and even rumor based on seeing this date, because there are obviously titles that come out a week or two later than the release date.

200
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,080
So, I don't know. Interesting nonetheless.

201
00:13:50,080 --> 00:14:05,080
I'd have to say so. Well, as far as the release dates go, I actually do have a list of release dates for the 28th in the UK, if anybody is interested.

202
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Sure, I want to know, even though I don't live there, but I know our friends that live there want to know.

203
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:17,840
Civ City Rome is coming out, Civilization 4 Warlords, Field Commander Formula 106, Juiced

204
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:25,240
Eliminator, Pac-Man World 3 on the PC, Shin Megami Tensei, Siphon Filter, Dark Mirror,

205
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:33,560
The Ant Bully, Tokyo Extreme Racer, and Tringo on Game Boy Advance.

206
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,580
The US isn't getting much more stuff being released, but anyways, let's see here, Tech

207
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,120
in Dark Resurrection, which is going to be a pretty big game of course, Painkiller Hell

208
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,000
Wars is going to be coming out so far, I think that game actually might be delayed again,

209
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,860
but who knows, Civ IV Warlords for the PC, Civ City Rome also on the PC, other than that,

210
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,700
I think, what was it, Ant Bully is coming out on the consoles and the portables.

211
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,900
That's about it.

212
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:11,780
There's a big, you know, blank space there until the week of the 31st, which you're going

213
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,900
to be getting flat out to in Barnyard and stuff like that.

214
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,260
I was going to say, August is getting closer and closer, and that's when we're going to

215
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,660
start seeing at least some 360 titles and stuff.

216
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,860
Three more weeks until my fucking Dead Rising comes out.

217
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,000
That is going to make me a very happy camper.

218
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,460
Even I'm pretty excited about Dead Rising.

219
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,340
In Dead Rising, every video I see of Dead Rising is more kick ass than the last.

220
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,140
I like the undead.

221
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,740
You must be interested in Dead Rising, too, though.

222
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,560
I mean getting to kill zombies with anything you want.

223
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,820
I love zombies.

224
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,560
I especially love watching them score.

225
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,840
You are a zombie some days.

226
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Some days.

227
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,940
I've seen you in the morning.

228
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,120
You have seen me in the morning.

229
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
I'm like...

230
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,860
It's like in that scene in Shaun of the Dead where he's just getting up and stumbling to

231
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
the door.

232
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
U Vaccine!

233
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,860
Like that.

234
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,860
I love that movie.

235
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,620
Alrighty, well thank you for the release date news, and

236
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,220
you know, I feel sometimes left out when we do release dates, because Dark Sakura

237
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,540
does them and Loki does them, so I'm gonna figure out

238
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,260
like what our third... You can do the Ugandan one.

239
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,460
I forgot to mention some stuff, I was gonna confirm a few things.

240
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,820
There's a Rumor Control, or not Rumor Control,

241
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,980
Retail Radar thing, Retard Radar.

242
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,620
Now Retail Radar segment that they did on GameSpot,

243
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,500
It was talking about Oblivion on the PS3 which I've been seeing for weeks now

244
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,860
by the way. Yes, it is on the PS3. It is coming out. We have

245
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,900
a date now. It's like November 2nd or something like that.

246
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,740
It's coming out on the PSP in March too, which I thought was really

247
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,420
interesting.

248
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,620
PS3 is not out till November 17th question?

249
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,700
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said PS3. No, PS3 is in November.

250
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,260
My bad. Yeah, so I thought that was really interesting.

251
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,420
That's all I got.

252
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,540
As I was saying, I feel left out when it comes to release dates.

253
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,020
I need to figure out what our third most listened to country is and do the release

254
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,980
dates for there.

255
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,220
I think it's Australia. You should do the Australian release dates.

256
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,100
I'll look into that, or maybe I could rotate around some of the other

257
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,060
countries that listen to us.

258
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,660
Honestly, maybe we should start covering Japanese release dates. Actually, that's not a bad idea.

259
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,820
Maybe we could go back and forth or something. We'll see what to do.

260
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,500
I'll have to tutor you.

261
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,580
No, if we go there, then we're switching, and you can do Japanese release dates, I'll

262
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:31,220
do UK release dates, and that's easier for me, because I've never taken a class.

263
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,420
Anyway, we'll talk about that at our next staff meeting.

264
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,580
For now, let's talk about what Microsoft might be talking about at their staff meetings,

265
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,420
Blu-ray, and what the hell they're going to be doing about it.

266
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:46,860
Well, actually, Major Nelson actually interviewed Amir Majidimer on his latest podcast, I suppose,

267
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,060
or I'm sorry, blogcast, as he calls it, and his group, Amir's group at Microsoft, oversees

268
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,580
the audio-video compression technologies and had something interesting to say about Blu-ray.

269
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:04,600
According to Majidamir, Blu-ray moves the recording surface very close to the top layer

270
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,180
of the disk, protected by just a very thin coating, and this makes maintaining the high

271
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,720
reliability of disks during the actual manufacturing process much more difficult.

272
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,220
This factor is a really big difference between Blu-ray and HD-DVD.

273
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:25,420
Well, HD-DVD, like traditional DVDs, actually protects its data between two layers of protective

274
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,940
plastic above and below, thus making the manufacturing of the disks much more reliable.

275
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,940
So kind of interesting there, the differences between the two formats, because I don't know,

276
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,180
I guess when you look at them on an HD TV, there probably won't be a whole lot of difference,

277
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,460
but it's hard for me to say when I haven't seen a lot of demos of Blu-ray.

278
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:52,780
We shall see if Sony's next format takes off or ends up going the way of UMD.

279
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
We'll see.

280
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,300
I've been hearing not good about it, though.

281
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,300
We'll see.

282
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
I don't know.

283
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,860
I'm thinking maybe it's just because it's easy to pick on Sony right now, but I try

284
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,940
to keep some hope, but it gets harder and harder every day.

285
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:13,060
Anyways, there's some actual funny stuff coming out here from an EA employee who admitted

286
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:20,060
to releasing crappy games. I know EA is kind of a scapegoat here, but they do have a lot

287
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,900
of games that are just ports, especially the next gen stuff. You may remember the Xbox

288
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:32,120
360 launch and how a lot of the games were just ports of the current gen stuff with slightly

289
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:38,780
more high res graphics or whatever. But anyways, there's actually a YouTube video out there

290
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:47,280
now that you can play, and it's kind of interesting. A little bit of a funny, you know, funny little

291
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,280
thing there. So, check it out.

292
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:59,480
Alright, well, crappy games do not make us happy gamers, and when we're not happy, we

293
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
We get ranty.

294
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:15,560
Why don't you start us off with our favorite segment, the FUs of the week, DarkSagra.

295
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,760
Oh my god, it's so hot.

296
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,880
FU to the hot.

297
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,720
Dear son, piss off.

298
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:30,400
I want it to be dark, even more I want it to stay dry, and even more than that I want

299
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,400
it to be a nice 72 degrees outside.

300
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,200
With slight overcast, and okay maybe not dry, maybe a little touch of water in the air so

301
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,380
that it doesn't hurt to breathe.

302
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,080
I tried breathing outside and it felt like I was breathing plaster.

303
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,900
It sucked.

304
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:56,300
So an F.U. goes to our 113 degrees today.

305
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,660
Even worse that it's night time and 95 degrees.

306
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,740
I had our thermostat sit down to 70.

307
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,740
It read 85.

308
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,140
That's not right.

309
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,420
Celsius maybe.

310
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,700
And a sub F.U. to everyone who complains about the quote humidity Rob.

311
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Oh screw off.

312
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
Piss off.

313
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,260
Piss off right back at you.

314
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,820
It's not humid.

315
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:25,460
I'm gonna have to say F you to my cable being out, or not my cable, but my internet being

316
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,460
out at home.

317
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,860
Comcast decided to take a crap because, uh, did you pay the bill?

318
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860
Yes, I paid the bill.

319
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,900
Yes, because that's why my internet stops working and my cable's fine, because I didn't

320
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,900
pay the bill.

321
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,900
That doesn't make any sense at all.

322
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:46,540
Anyways, um, so yeah, um, that really sucks and I couldn't, um, read news and check out

323
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,540
porn I guess.

324
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,700
So, that made me a very sad Loki.

325
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,460
My FU of the week goes to Coldstone for being a diet's worst enemy.

326
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,620
I'm a victim of deliciousness, what can I say?

327
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Andrew!

328
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,740
Who's been awfully quiet this segment.

329
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,500
Surely you have something for this.

330
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Oh hell yes.

331
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,620
Alright, I'm going to have to repeat that FU to the hot with a few things added on.

332
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,060
FU to the shitty air conditioner that is in our house.

333
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,980
temperature climbs up, air conditioner decides to take a shit, and it's suddenly 95 degrees

334
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,500
in the house. No wonder you're here tonight. At night! No wonder you're here tonight. And

335
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:32,500
it's so hot, it has never been so hot in my house that my computer will not run games.

336
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,180
My video card overheats and takes a shit, locks up the system within two minutes. Wow.

337
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,660
is that hot. What are you gonna do?

338
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,820
I don't know. You're gonna have to run to target and get a room?

339
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,940
I think I will spend the night in the lawn and sleep in sprinklers.

340
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,140
That is the only course of action for me.

341
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,940
Gosh.

342
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,060
Well good luck to you, sucker. End the angst. Alright, yes, let's end the angst.

343
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,340
Let's end the angst and get to our listeners, because they rock!

344
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,260
we love our listeners and we have a segment that we've been doing for a

345
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,020
couple weeks now called the voicemails of the week and we'd love to get your

346
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,860
feedback

347
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,160
on different topics and last week's topic that we gave to you guys for the

348
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,180
voicemails of the week

349
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,940
was our games too easy. We have two voicemails we want to play for you tonight

350
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,780
and here's the first feedback on the our games too easy topic.

351
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,340
My name is Jack Monkey Upload and basically I'm sending you a question of the week

352
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,140
and games back in the day were a lot cheaper to make

353
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,340
And you'd only have like two guys, two or three guys, and it only takes them a couple months to make a game.

354
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:47,340
And I spent most of their time making the game itself, and the levels were like really easy to make, it wouldn't take that much time.

355
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:55,640
But nowadays, the levels for like these, the new games are spent with like hundreds of maybe thousands of people.

356
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:02,140
And like a lot of them are artists that just maybe work on just the levels, and some of them I only worked on the end levels.

357
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:08,140
and you spend like tens of millions of dollars on a game, you want everyone to play like the majority of the way through.

358
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,640
Because if most people only play through like half a million dollars worth of your game,

359
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,640
then you might as well just spend half a million on it instead of spending ten million.

360
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:25,640
Yeah, I think this trend is also going to increase because next-gen games are getting really expensive,

361
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:32,640
So you're going to see games that like anybody can complete just so they'll get through the majority of it and see everything.

362
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,640
Alright, that's all I wanted to say. I'll listen to you guys again.

363
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,600
Actually at Classic Gaming Expo, I went to a panel for the guy who did, um, oh god I can't

364
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,360
remember the names, who did, um, like, uh, combat in Pac-Man, in Battlezone, in a lot

365
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,540
of those, uh, old, uh, you know, Atari classics, and they're, you know, basically saying about

366
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:26,880
how they were expected to crank out, you know, arcade perfect versions, as close to perfect

367
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,000
versions of arcade games, and how, you know, what they had to work with then, and yeah,

368
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,120
was a lot cheaper to produce back then. I mean given inflation though and the cost of production

369
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,560
even comparatively it was still probably cheaper to make games then. Took less time even though

370
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,520
they were basically hand coding and didn't have the tools to do it. You know they would create

371
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,280
their own tools from scratch. I think though that now because we have such a greater capacity a lot

372
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,080
more does go into it and you do have more people you got to pay it does cost more. So yeah they

373
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,920
They have to make these levels cost effective, and on top of that, they also have to think

374
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,760
about the attention span of the average gamer today, too.

375
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,640
Andrew, do you have a thought, too?

376
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,920
My take on it is, nowadays, game making is a big business, it's like Hollywood, and it's

377
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,840
not so much that we're playing games anymore as that we're watching them, we're experiencing

378
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,120
them, and they've got to have the deep storyline, all that kind of stuff.

379
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:30,200
You take how hard games like, say, Ghouls'n'Ghosts was, and then you compare it to, you know,

380
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,760
this isn't a completely fair analogy, you compare it to Prey, which just came out.

381
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,640
It's not so much you're playing a game anymore, you're playing a movie.

382
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,540
So much went into it, and there's just one way that they want you to play through it

383
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,560
so you experience the way that they want you to do it.

384
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Now, Prey is one of the most easy first-person shooters I've ever played in my life.

385
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:57,320
isn't saying much, but it's just there's one way that they want you to play it

386
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,540
and usually it's the easiest way because they want you to finish it. They want you

387
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,260
to experience the whole thing. Prey is also interesting when you talk about

388
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,860
those big budgets and stories because like it doesn't... I was talking about

389
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,560
this in my review of the demo last week. There's no real cutscenes in Prey, at

390
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,700
least it seems like. Everything is very seamless. Yeah, they took a cue from

391
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,980
Half-Life 2. Well, from Doom 3, really, and its engine. But yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah,

392
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,080
Yeah, it all kind of comes back to that.

393
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,080
I sort of like the cinematic element games though.

394
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
I do too.

395
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
I think Prey is a beautiful game.

396
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Did anyone ever play Berserk on Dreamcast?

397
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,040
Oh, I was going to say Berserk on Atari 2600 with the bouncy happy face, but no, I haven't

398
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
played the...

399
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Actually, it came out before we got the anime over here and I started actually picking up

400
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:44,960
the fan subs after that and downloading manga scans just because it was like freaking playing

401
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
through the anime.

402
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,720
It was so perfect.

403
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
There was so much good...

404
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,680
I like the games, though, that give a more in-depth story.

405
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,280
I think that it has a lot of the action that you want,

406
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,240
but at the same time, you're compelled to keep playing

407
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,840
because the story is so good.

408
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,360
Well, let's hear another voicemail

409
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,980
from our second voicemail and last voicemail for tonight

410
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,180
on this same topic.

411
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,640
Hey, what's up, Orange Onions Radio?

412
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,600
This is PDF40 from Michigan.

413
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,560
And I think about the video games getting harder.

414
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,120
I don't think they're getting harder.

415
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,080
I think they're getting less accessible for people.

416
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,840
Like back when Pac-Man and stuff was out, the controllers had a lot less buttons, it

417
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:31,240
was just like an A and a B. It's not that they're getting harder, it's just less accessible.

418
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
Think of it.

419
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,520
Back then there was only 2D games, and now we have a whole other dimension, and there's

420
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,360
a ton more objectives nowadays, and the controllers have so many more buttons on them.

421
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,200
Even though it's easier to beat the game, they're just harder to play.

422
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,240
So I just think video games are now less accessible to the average person.

423
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,480
They're just easier to us because we're gamers.

424
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Thanks guys, see ya.

425
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Interesting.

426
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,240
Kind of talking about the accessibility to everybody.

427
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,560
So what do you guys think?

428
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
That's a very valid point.

429
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,760
I mean, actually I think that that's the point that Nintendo is trying to do with the Wii

430
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,980
controller trying to simplify things and make it to where it's more attractive.

431
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,140
In one degree, it's not as simple.

432
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,480
To another degree, I think it's very simplifying.

433
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,160
You move your hand, that's all you do.

434
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,880
I think that that whole accessibility thing of being able to actually get into it, being

435
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,100
able to pick up the controller and know what to do with it, I think that's a lot of the

436
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,840
issue that we have these days.

437
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:43,080
it more accessible to people who don't have the patience to read the damn manual.

438
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,720
A lot of people don't. I mean, you're going to have a hard time telling a non-gamer to

439
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,000
read the manual. I'm sorry, that's bitter tech support coming

440
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,620
through again. Yeah, right. Anyway, thank you guys so much

441
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,360
for the voicemails of the week, and of course we don't always have enough time to play everything

442
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,320
that we get, but we do try to listen to all of the voicemails. Actually, we do listen

443
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,540
to every single voicemail, and we really appreciate you guys calling in. If you want to leave

444
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,540
us a voicemail.

445
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,380
The number is 916-226-9067.

446
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,860
Please keep in mind that is not a toll-free call.

447
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,700
If you don't pay the bill, ask whoever does their permission first.

448
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,140
Or if you want to do it the free way, you just download a little program called Skype,

449
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,620
it's very popular, and you can call username OrangeLoungeRadio and leave us your voicemail

450
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,620
that way.

451
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,620
Here's your topic for this week.

452
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:28,360
We just had Loki tell us a story about EA talking about releasing crappy games and kind

453
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,900
of apologizing for that.

454
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:37,180
We want to know what company do you think needs to be apologizing for a video game right about now or a piece of hardware?

455
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,660
So we'll leave that to you guys

456
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,120
Whatever you want call in all right

457
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,940
I mean

458
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,180
20 years later does Atari still actually 22 years later does Atari?

459
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,900
Don't let dark soccer influence you we want to know what you think on this topic

460
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:02,380
So please call us any time during the week and leave us a voicemail speaking of things that of entities that suck

461
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,740
It looks like Sony's trying to make our friends over in the UK bend over and take it

462
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,100
just like they're doing for us as in there there is a

463
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,820
Notice that was out that both the 20 gigabyte and 60 gigabyte versions of PlayStation 3 are going to be out in the UK

464
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,420
However, not both of them on launch day

465
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:29,140
They're working by consulting with some of the different merchandisers to, you know,

466
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,020
basically set up the different SKUs for both items.

467
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:42,000
There is a note that though it may not necessarily be both at launch.

468
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,100
In fact, there's a quote here from David Wilson from Sony UK saying

469
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,920
that he actually doesn't know.

470
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:54,120
Um, he explained that Sony has to face, um, what the challenge would be of offering a

471
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,480
choice without confusing the consumers, meeting the needs of the retailers, et cetera, blah

472
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
blah blah.

473
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,080
Um, however, they are actually saying though that for preordering a PlayStation 3, it is

474
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,780
going to be a hundred and thirty pounds, a hundred and fifty pounds.

475
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,760
That's a, uh, retail suggestion.

476
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
Hmm.

477
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,280
Well, we'll see.

478
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,760
That's expensive, man.

479
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,720
Yeah, poor guys in the UK getting screwed on those prices.

480
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,680
Their tax rate's higher over there too, so they get double screwed, don't they?

481
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:31,480
Yeah, well the final price is again, it's November 17th in Europe, 600 Euros, converting

482
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,240
to 425 pounds in the UK.

483
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Interesting.

484
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:41,000
Well, they're going to need to make all the money that they can because according to an

485
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,160
an IBM engineer is making a comment about their chip yields for the cell processor and

486
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,940
how hard it is to get these chips to be made right.

487
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:57,480
Basically he's saying that for every sheet that they press, 10-20% of them work.

488
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
And that's it.

489
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:06,280
And it costs, say for example, $1,000 to produce a wafer with 100 chips on it.

490
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:11,360
And if only 10 or 20 of those are going to be working, that increases the cost of the

491
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,880
system significantly.

492
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,280
So that's not very good.

493
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,920
But yeah, I don't know, this is not good for anything.

494
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,740
And I'm wondering if you've got a problem with, you know, before we were speculating

495
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,000
that there are going to be shortages on the systems anyways, imagine if you will, that

496
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,860
let's just say you've got the blu-ray shortages, you have the cell processor chip shortages

497
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:41,100
or expenses or whatever I mean are we gonna see a lot of these consoles at

498
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,900
launch and is the launch even going to be happening when they say they are well

499
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,060
now I think this story just barely missed the cut for tonight but I seem to

500
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,140
remember reading somewhere that the ps3s have actually gone into production now

501
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,140
at this point finally so and I unfortunately have a lot more details

502
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,780
than that but you know it's all you pretty much mean no ps3s are finally on

503
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:03,820
their way so I mean you see that Sony's gearing up for this you know with with a

504
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,340
a lot of people are starting to get nervous, like are they going to have enough time, well

505
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,520
now okay maybe they could do this, but wow this chip thing really has me wondering, but

506
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,400
how long have they been going at the chips?

507
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,260
I don't know, but they basically, this was coming from the Guardian technology blog,

508
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:24,120
and they were saying, this is just an assumption of how much it costs to produce a chip, since

509
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:29,820
you have to do a whole wafer at a time, you say for example you can produce 100 chips

510
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:35,760
per wafer. And if there's no defects at all, you get 100 good chips for $10 each. Now,

511
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,360
if the defect rate is 99%, you only get one chip per wafer and it costs you $1000. So

512
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:48,360
if 10-20% of the chips are working, that's pretty expensive. And that's assuming there's

513
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:54,340
not going to be any glitches or whatever with this stuff. I don't know. It's not good, but

514
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:59,540
you know what? I think that they're going to be able to find some way to keep the cost

515
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,780
down obviously you know they know what they're doing so we'll see all right I

516
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:09,220
you know I got a look at chat room going on here blaze revolution says it's 17

517
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:15,380
and a quarter percent in the UK for the tax that's vicious Wow let's see

518
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,180
ol army Eddie says $200 to pre-order a ps3 here and I know he's in Vancouver

519
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,300
because I was talking about my recent vacation with him let's see what else

520
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,260
blaze revolution simply says push back the release date then go back and fix

521
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,220
this crap

522
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,420
they're not going to do that you know

523
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,900
and ravens dolphin says it's a rumor sky a rumor

524
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,420
it's everything's rumored until you know they come out and say it and they're not

525
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,920
gonna so you know what we'll just find out when the launch happens and we'll see what

526
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,940
you know what's going on here comes the doom and gloom too we have anoosh says

527
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,480
uh... i'm sorry if i pronounce that wrong i always have to apologize for that

528
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,820
says uh... anoosh says the end of sony core is close

529
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,900
and uh... quicksilver says i think sony is screwed

530
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,820
I don't think it's going to be the end of them. No, they're a huge company. They still have

531
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,380
wagas.

532
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,700
And the whole thing is they could come out with something you know really

533
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,340
remarkable that we don't know about that they're just kinda keep it under wraps.

534
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,340
The thing is right now though, it's kind of just you know the trend where

535
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,620
everyone's posting you know doom and gloom stories about them.

536
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,580
We're not going to know until we actually see the launch of what's going on.

537
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,980
Because say for example

538
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,900
they're only getting you know twenty percent per you know yield or whatever.

539
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,060
They're obviously not going to just stick with that you know oh damn you know eighty

540
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,260
percent of those don't work oh well I guess we'll just have to produce more no they're

541
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,940
going to figure out why they're not working and fix that problem no they're going to bring

542
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:39,380
out a new peripheral called the ibotoi laser in our chat room says uh laser one two three

543
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,500
four five three one says uh no sony has a good plan it's easier to just replace everything

544
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,140
than it is to qa yeah remember when remember when all we had to worry about was discrete

545
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:52,460
errors now look at all this shit remember back on um for the first playstation um how

546
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:57,180
you know you'd have to end up turning your system upside down or sideways because the

547
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,300
laser mechanism.

548
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,500
Wasn't aligned right? Exactly. They started actually just selling replacement parts for

549
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,180
thirteen bucks.

550
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,340
This might be

551
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,540
it for Sony and PlayStation. I don't know.

552
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,220
I don't know. I don't know if I'd go that far. Well,

553
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,700
anyway, we've been talking a lot about chips and

554
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,140
this is something interesting you could do with that chip inside your DS Lite.

555
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:24,500
You know how you can like overclock your computer? Well, a Japanese gamer has

556
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,140
figured out a way to overclock your DS

557
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:32,540
light. Now obviously this is not an easy process but if you want to check it out

558
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,940
you can head over to Engadget. They ran a story on July 19th on how to

559
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,300
overclock your Nintendo DS and this process will probably take you several

560
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,620
hours. You have to open up your DS light, drill a hold in the side, solder several

561
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:51,300
different areas on it, and make sure you don't touch too much of the bad areas

562
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,100
that will break the whole damn thing. And now this has been translated into

563
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,640
English if you want to take a look at this I believe the site is ndshotmod.com

564
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,680
but of course remember this would be violating your warranty nice proof of

565
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,360
concept but what exactly is it supposed to accomplish it just overclocking it's

566
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:17,360
just for homebrew stuff I don't know this essentially what this hack will do

567
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,200
reports are saying it will actually physically increase the speed of

568
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,880
of visuals and sound between 1.4 times and 1.7 times which means it's pretty

569
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,520
much unplayable it's uncontrollable high-pitched music and rather a pain in

570
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,600
the butt to be playing so this is something you do you thought why are

571
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,880
you where got fast only because you're like a hardcore hacker like the same

572
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,000
type of person that would install Linux on a toaster this is for you have fun

573
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Have fun.

574
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,640
VX Jason XB, this is something he'd do, right?

575
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,240
No, actually I know several people who are engineers who would do it.

576
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,440
Personally, I think the better hack that they had was for the original DS where you can

577
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,680
actually make it as bright as a DS Lite using a firmware upgrade.

578
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,600
I'm still plenty pleased with my Game Boy Advance and After Burner.

579
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,760
That was awesome.

580
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,560
And speaking of awesome, I have another story.

581
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,520
Cartoon Network has a new massively multiplayer online game coming out.

582
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,280
They're working with, I guess it's Griggan Entertainment, to make one that will have

583
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,400
Blue, Ben 10, Mac, and the kids next door.

584
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:40,020
And I love Kotaku because the writing is so honest and, you know, takes no prisoners.

585
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,240
Basically saying that it sounds like a formula for instant crap.

586
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:49,640
However, there's a couple, um, Toontown Online, what?

587
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,280
Disney has a Toontown Online thing for...

588
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Shush!

589
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Stop distracting me!

590
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Shush!

591
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Where's the ferret when we need it?

592
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
I don't even know.

593
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
He died.

594
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:05,120
The game is going to be a free download, um, it's actually, you'll have a subscription

595
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,520
service that you'll have to pay for and you can just download the game, but it will be

596
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,860
an East meets West approach that, um, sort of like going to be having your Western cartoon

597
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:22,120
characters mixing it up with anime, and they said that it should be out around spring 2008.

598
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,560
Interesting.

599
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,800
I think, I agree with the formula for crap, honestly.

600
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,240
Now, my question is, will they put in some of the Adult Swim stuff? Like, could we

601
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,720
have Pee-Wee's Playhouse and Saved by the Bell? That would rock.

602
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,460
Seriously, um, I want to say Extrovert Sister

603
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,640
and, um, Miggletove were watching Pee-Wee's Playhouse the other night and I kinda

604
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,700
caught a little bit of it.

605
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,160
So frickin' funny. I mean, seriously,

606
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,320
that was the kinda crack we were fed as kids. That's awesome.

607
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,920
I know that show is that show is badass anyway

608
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,080
I have remember being so freaked out cuz what was the Cowboys name

609
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,100
I don't know but it wasn't Lawrence Fisher in the place there was

610
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:08,440
cowboy Bob I someone in chat is only being young and being freaked out by

611
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,960
Curtis

612
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,840
tell me Curtis thank you doctor saying that he are you he says I can't do the

613
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,080
pajama party cuz asleep in the nude

614
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,480
Wow I remember

615
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,600
being so traumatized by this when I was little

616
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,840
and I really traumatized thinking you know he's

617
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,800
he's naked you know what fuckin traumatized me about peewee

618
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,440
Herman and all that stuff when I was little is the movie Peewee's Big

619
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,120
Adventure

620
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,640
you remember the scene when he gets in the truck and there's large Marge

621
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,360
yeah story and then it's just the face she does the face and it looked

622
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,860
a lot like this the whole thing

623
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,860
It was dark and scary.

624
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,860
It scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.

625
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
I mean, my god.

626
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,860
No wonder I came out so fucked up. Alright, anyway.

627
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,860
Anyways, uh...

628
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,860
Sorry.

629
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,860
Tonight's been a night of randomness. Can I have the last cookie?

630
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,860
Give Rob the cookie!

631
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,860
On to other things.

632
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,860
You know, there are other game networks out there

633
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,860
other than G4TV

634
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,860
and even G4, you might not even

635
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,860
consider a game network anymore, but

636
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:20,640
one of those is actually put out by Voom HD, and they have a channel called Gameplay HD.

637
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,120
And they're actually going to be adding coverage for the World Series of Video Games, Microsoft's

638
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,440
Project Anthem 3 tournament, and NCSoft's Guild War Factions competition.

639
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,440
And they're going to be having a bunch of different kind of like ESPN type of coverage

640
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,660
on this.

641
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,640
And it's kind of interesting that they're going to be giving so much coverage to this

642
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
kind of stuff.

643
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,280
Um, I'm gonna give another cheap plug for our buddies at all games. I'm Scott and Lawrence had

644
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,120
One of the guys I'm sorry, I forgot his name from gameplay HD on their show

645
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,940
Last week and I know it got on dig like it was a really big deal

646
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,100
I even got on dig but go check out their archives all games calm and listen to the interview

647
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,900
Because it's great

648
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:10,420
Gameplay HD knows what they're doing. This channel needs to make it big. I mean right now they're stuck on satellite

649
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,700
I guess but it sounds like they have plans to expand which is good. I hope it happens fast for them

650
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,380
I feel sad because we have Comcast cable here in this part of town

651
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,980
So as long as this is seen as a competition to g4

652
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,060
we probably get it anytime soon, but I'm gonna cross my fingers because

653
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,140
It sounds like they know what they're doing with this network

654
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,700
And I'm very excited to see what comes of it and I think a lot of us that feel like g4 was a joke

655
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,460
in its later years anyway

656
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,460
are going to be much happier by what Gameplay HD is going to bring.

657
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,460
So, check it out.

658
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,460
So, basically this agreement right now with Gameplay HD, like I said,

659
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,460
includes the three circuits of the 2006 World Series of Video Games.

660
00:43:52,460 --> 00:44:01,460
The Land War competition in Louisville, Kentucky, which is being held June 16th through the 19th, 2006.

661
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,460
And it will be airing on the channel September 13th through the 15th.

662
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:31,460
DreamHack LAN party in Jokopin, Sweden, I guess, which was held June 17th through the 21st, and will be airing on the 28th and 29th of September, as well as the Intel Summer Championship in Dallas, which was held back in July 5th through the 9th, and still will be determined when they're going to actually put it on there.

663
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:35,700
lots of stuff for the World Series of video game and then of course PGR3

664
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,940
and Guild Wars. It should be interesting.

665
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:44,060
Very interesting. You know, they sound like ESPN for games.

666
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,540
That is so awesome. That's what they needed. That's what Arena on G4 always needed to be.

667
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,780
They're a really, you know, young company. I mean, they just launched the network

668
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:56,780
back in February, February 1st. Well, when you listen to the guy on the interview,

669
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:02,780
He's a gamer! Perfect! That's what we need! Is a game station run by a gamer? Who would have thought?

670
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:08,780
I don't think he runs it, but I don't remember exactly the relation, but I apologize, but I'm going off the top of my head. I don't have any notes on that.

671
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:17,780
But if you do happen to get Dish Network and you have HD, the channel can be found on Dish Channel 9485.

672
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,780
Seriously? It makes me want to switch to satellite. Why not?

673
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,780
The only reason is because I save on the internet by having the game on the internet through the same company.

674
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,780
And I live in an apartment and it's kind of hard to get satellite here.

675
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,780
But I'm seriously thinking about it for when I move.

676
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
Which is soon.

677
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,780
Thinking about it. We'll see.

678
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,780
Don't you get TiVo? Or now it's DirecTV.

679
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,780
Now it's DirecTV.

680
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,780
And I want to apologize because I think a couple weeks ago on the show I said it was DirecTV that had Gameplay HD.

681
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,780
And I keep forgetting there's two competing companies.

682
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,780
So I apologize for my satellite ignorance.

683
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,780
But keep in mind when you live in an apartment, it's a little harder to get satellite.

684
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,940
Anyway, now we kind of saved this for towards the end of the show, because I'll be damned

685
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:00,480
if it doesn't seem like every week we're hearing about some damn Wii button, Wii flap, Wii

686
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,820
secret compartment that you can put your Wii in.

687
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,400
I don't know what they're coming...

688
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Your weed?

689
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
Get it?

690
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
Huh?

691
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
Anything?

692
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Har.

693
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
Har.

694
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
Well, get this.

695
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,660
There was a new promo picture in the latest issue of Nintendo Power that seems to indicate

696
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,180
that there is yet another damn Wii button.

697
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,860
And it looks like it's some type of new Z button, kind of like the one that's on the

698
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,420
GameCube's controller, like a little teeny shoulder thing.

699
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,940
No idea how the hell you're going to reach it, because you'd have to have another thumb

700
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:34,420
growing out of your thumb to hit it, but maybe it's like a volume control for the internal

701
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,420
speaker?

702
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,460
That's a theory that's going around right now.

703
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,980
But if that's going to be one you're supposed to frequently hit in the game, that is going

704
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,780
to be a pain in the ass, as if playing with a remote control is not going to be weird

705
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,780
enough.

706
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,140
played 83 it felt okay to me it didn't feel like the wrist cramp that it

707
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,300
sounded like on paper

708
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,620
I don't know if it's just me that felt that way interesting

709
00:46:54,620 --> 00:47:01,060
alright anyway we're gonna open up the Skype line right now it's www.orangeloungeloungeradio.com

There's one!

718
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,660
What's up?

719
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,660
At least from me.

720
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,620
The Luminous 2 soundtrack has been revealed, I'd also like to thank Tiger Call for the

721
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,620
link.

722
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:38,540
Going to be in Luminous 2, we have Beck Black Tambourine, Black Eyed Peas Pump It, Chemical

723
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:43,060
Brothers Star Guitar, Fat Boy Slim Gangster Trippin, The Go Team, Bottle Rocket, Gwen

00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,060

Luba Stank, Born to Lead, Junior Senior Take My Time, Missy Elliott Lose Control, Another

726
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,380
Law, and so Random Song by New Order, which New Order I can't go wrong with.

727
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,380
That is so weird.

728
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:01,100
It's just a weird lineup, but Luminous is definitely going mainstream.

729
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,980
As long as Mondo Grosso is coming back, I'm cool.

730
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,220
Well those actually are going to be the ones with videos.

731
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:11,460
Also ones without videos are going to be Junkie XL, Breezer, Stigmato, Inc. with Reality Check,

732
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,060
And also there will be more tracks from the Japanese artists, Mondo Grosso, Kenishi, and

733
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,060
Tech Writers.

734
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,060
All right.

735
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:22,340
Well, let's go Skyplane, we're getting a call.

736
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,660
There's a couple calls have already come in that we've missed, but we want to get the

737
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,900
Luminous 2 news out there.

738
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,900
So call back.

739
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,620
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

740
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,620
Who's this?

741
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,620
Hi.

742
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,620
It's Ravenstaufen.

743
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,620
Hey, Ravenstaufen.

744
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,820
What's on your mind, buddy?

745
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,820
The UMD.

746
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,720
What do you want to talk about with UMDs?

747
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,920
I want to talk about the UMD is dead because of

748
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,600
BitTorrent. Really? What's your theory there?

749
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,680
Why? I mentioned this before and I said

750
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,680
that I've been getting all my movies and all my stuff from BitTorrent

751
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,120
and this is what someone should do. They should put everything on BitTorrent.

752
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,400
So you basically admit that you steal your movies?

753
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,120
Yes. Which is fun. Look, at least you're honest, okay? I don't, you know, I'm not

754
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,300
trying to say it makes you a bad person or whatever but you know you're

755
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,520
what the MPAA is not happy with right now.

756
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,180
So let me ask you this, let me turn around and ask you this,

757
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,720
what would be a way that you would legitimately pay for movies?

758
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,060
What would make you stop using BitTorrent and legitimately pay for movies?

759
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,540
It's probably going to sound really cheesy as hell, but

760
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:29,060
the Sony Connect service, but I really think they got a good model and I think

761
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:29,820
it's gonna work.

762
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,900
Okay, so like on one hand you give Sony a little bit of shit for the UMD

763
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,220
but on the other hand, give them some props for the Sony Connect. Yeah, I think they got a good

764
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:42,720
good plan going with this. If they tried to connect us with the Xbox Live model

765
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,840
but not like it, like charge like little games for the PSP

766
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,580
and like movies, I think they really have something to go with

767
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,540
but that's just me.

768
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,100
It's interesting you bring up Xbox because I'm waiting for the day when

769
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,920
Xbox does this. All they need is a bigger hard drive on that thing and you know

770
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,320
with the active downloads and everything you could

771
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,800
totally and easily download movies on that thing hell

772
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:11,040
you can already download you know music videos in the little behind the scenes

773
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,440
clips in HD and I

774
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,000
hell I'm downloading HD clips just because they're HD things

775
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,560
that I can look at on my HDTV and go ooh pretty you know

776
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,200
just imagine when they start adding movies in HD digitally I mean

777
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,880
I don't know I mean I hate to change the topic to Xbox but I just kinda keep

778
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,640
thinking about it's only a matter of time

779
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,640
It's only a matter of time

780
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,860
before Microsoft does something like this, I think.

781
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,740
I agree.

782
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,100
Oh, one more thing.

783
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:35,940
What's up?

784
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,900
I was surfing singular.com

785
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,460
and they have a little ringtone

786
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,280
for the internet is for porn from Avenue Q.

787
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,520
Why did that make you think of us?

788
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,820
Because it's so random.

789
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,200
It's just like, and I'm going to purchase it soon.

790
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,060
So everyone that I walked down the street

791
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,400
when my phone rings has gone,

792
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,300
the internet is really, really great.

793
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,900
for porn

794
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,060
wow we have some crazy listeners at OLR also one of her cage band songs

795
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,520
I know ages ago ages ago anyway

796
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,680
Ravenstaufen thanks so much for the call we appreciate your insight alright have a good one

797
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,120
and I hope they don't come after you and sue you okay

798
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:17,160
oh they won't it's just a pseudonym not your real name if they try to sue you

799
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,560
you can counter sue them for invasion of privacy

800
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,580
and for search without a warrant

801
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:27,080
thanks dark sakura you're welcome legal advice from orange lounge radio

802
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:31,080
you go to law school? No I've taken a lot of business law but honestly the people

803
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:37,660
that were counter suing the RIAA and the MPAA were using those tactics for

804
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:42,220
counter suits. Let's go to another call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's

805
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:48,240
this? It's Legend of Zaku. Hi buddy what's on your mind? Um just the fact that you

806
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,080
know seconding the whole UMD thing and the whole format wars as we'd like to

807
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,720
see it. Honestly at the end of the day you know it's gonna hurt the consumer

808
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,520
they're going to stick with the DVD regardless because no one's ready to shift right no one's

809
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,640
ready to shift to a new format especially when there's like god knows how many are already out

810
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:13,840
there should the playstation 3 have had a umd slot um it really i i don't know i don't then

811
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:19,280
they'll be copying nintendo and trying to you try to play a portable gaming system on a console

812
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,280
like you do with the game boy no i'm talking about for movies oh for me i guess gaming is one thing

813
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,640
I guess, hypothetically, why not play the games too? Why not?

814
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,280
Yeah, I mean... How's that copying Nintendo?

815
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,560
Because they did it with the Game Boy, you know, the Game Boy player, the little

816
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,200
device...

817
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,200
I don't know if I call it copying, I just call it smart.

818
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,660
Make your games playable on more systems

819
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:47,480
or more and more places. Oh well, whatever. It's fine.

820
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,920
But the bottom line is this, I mean,

821
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,160
I mean, Hollywood is pretty much split on both formats. It's like,

822
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,160
Half is gonna support you know

823
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,680
HD DVD the other half is blu-ray and the same thing happened with DVD and Divx though

824
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,940
And look how long the war lasted well Divx got out

825
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:12,640
And you know only lasted three years while DVDs still running because Divx downright sucked. I mean the model was was

826
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:19,080
Idiotic it was doomed to fail whereas DVD. You know people you know it wasn't easy to go for it

827
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:24,480
I wasn't all blu-ray idiotic. I just don't really know enough about it, which is just childish

828
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,640
it's just it's just sophomoric all right any other thoughts you want to share

829
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:35,500
with our listeners let me see the fact that I've really never got your opinion

830
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:41,820
on how mobile gaming and you know what's your take on mobile gaming okay I can

831
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,720
say a lot about mobile gaming I'm not a big fan of it what do you want to know

832
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,920
well granted I already started a job in the mobile gaming industry make games

833
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,260
that don't suck so don't oh yeah don't got licenses for stuff okay don't put

834
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:00,020
the games that were built for PlayStations and we're not done stop

835
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:04,020
don't put those games on mobile it doesn't work the game that I'm working

836
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,700
on already sold a million I'm working on the Spanish version of it what it

837
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:13,500
bejeweled no it's it's more like a it's a question base game more like a game

838
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,760
show see those the type of games that work on cell phones are the type of

839
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,600
of games that you play on PopCap that's where it's at for mobile games like the

840
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:29,080
little niche one yeah casual games, uber casual games yes those are the

841
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,240
types of games that work on mobile because those type of people playing

842
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:36,440
mobile games are uber casual gamers the gamer gamers have a DS or a PSP right

843
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,600
unless they created some sort of cell phone similar you know exceeding the

844
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,320
capabilities of the n-gauge and it had you know the marketing and

845
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,320
Well, the problem with the N-Gage is that it was a phone first, gaming system second,

846
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,320
but yet it thought it was a gaming system first in the market.

847
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,320
Yeah, two platforms in the N-Gage.

848
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,320
One is the proprietary one, which the games are based on,

849
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,320
and also Java, if I recall correctly, Symbian,

850
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,320
so it was three platforms, two of which were pretty open.

851
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,320
So you're working on a Spanish version of a game, Habla Español?

852
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,320
Yeah, I understand a lot more than I speak.

853
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,400
more than I speak, I lost my fluency when I came here.

854
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,240
That's fine.

855
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,480
All right, buddy, we gotta let you go,

856
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,080

Oh, and here comes a call.

864
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

865
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,600
Hi, this is Eddie.

866
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,160
Hey, Eddie, what's on your mind, buddy?

867
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,500
Yeah, I just wanted to comment

868
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:47,780
like another part of the PSP okay yeah basically what I'm really confused about

869
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:53,900
is how Sony is doing this whole huge you know homebrew war on the PSP right mm-hmm

870
00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:01,180
and on the ps3 they're now using Linux as their operating system on the ps3

871
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:07,420
which is kind of opening the door for you know homebrew so why is it that

872
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:13,260
they're battling homebrew on platform and then like welcoming it with open arms on another.

873
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,700
I'm gonna throw this to our homebrew expert. Loki, do you have a thought on this?

874
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,580
Because the PlayStation 3 is a computer.

875
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,620
Why would that- so?

876
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,220
So that's why.

877
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,260
Why does Sony have one policy here and another policy here?

878
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,540
Because I'm sure that they're, you know, thinking that their bases are covered with,

879
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:35,900
you know, the PlayStation 3 and the fact that the PlayStation 3 needs all the help it can get to

880
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:42,080
sell so how well okay but how long before a Nintendo emulator comes out for

881
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:49,660
the ps3 two days well exactly then then shouldn't like actually happens

882
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:55,180
shouldn't like Sony be battling that too and it's gonna be a lot harder for them

883
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,720
to do since they're using Linux and it's hard and you know and if I remember

884
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,080
correctly that they can also boot into other languages not well not as

885
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,160
operating systems you know they're even saying they can maybe install you know

886
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:12,140
Windows or OS X or something on there which I don't know that's gonna be hard

887
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,620
to regulate unless they have some sort of crippled version of Linux on there

888
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,560
that doesn't allow certain things to run or something I don't know how they're

889
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:24,180
gonna do that yeah ps3 version running Windows that that'll be the day it'd be

890
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:30,060
the great irony well yeah that's all I wanted to say all right well thank you

891
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,940
very much for the call have a good one and we'll see what happens with Sony's

892
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,380
policy. I kind of think the gimped version of Linux is a more... I think

893
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,300
that's kind of what we're looking at is the reality of what's gonna happen, but

894
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:46,680
we'll see. Yeah, I guess so. Thank you. All right, not a problem. Thanks for the call. All right, sorry, I'm

895
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,940
trying to fix my mouse here. It just kind of... the batteries just died during that

896
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:54,420
call there, so I'm trying to get reorganized here. Sorry about that.

897
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,540
That's gonna do it for the Skypline tonight. Thank you guys so much for

898
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,460
calling in. We appreciate your insight, and if you didn't get through tonight or

899
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:05,140
or if you were that person that had connection problems, you can always leave us a voicemail.

900
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,740
We love voicemails.

901
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:09,580
And you can listen earlier in the show if you want to see how to leave us a voicemail

902
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,780
of the week and what our topic is this week.

903
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,260
Any more last minute stories, folks?

904
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,260
Yes.

905
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,260
All right, Loki, what's up?

906
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,580
Well, a couple things about the Wii.

907
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:21,660
Because as I was mentioning in the story before, well, before about the secret pages on the

908
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,780
Wii, I did find those finally.

909
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,660
Someone had them on FileShare.

910
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,140
Or let's see here.

911
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:31,200
We've got a few things with, of course, they're saying the Nintendo Wi-Fi service is going

912
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:38,160
to be free just like it is for the DS and they were saying you know of course

913
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,640
the frame code system and that type of thing. What I also found was interesting

914
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:51,160
they renamed WarioWare to WarioWare Dojo now instead of Brawl so that's kind of

915
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,960
neat or not WarioWare Super Smash Brothers what the hell am I talking

916
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:02,640
about. Anyways, on top of that, that wasn't the most neat thing I found. There was kind

917
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:11,720
of an interview in GamePro with the people behind Red Steel. And they were talking about

918
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:18,400
the multiplayer. And basically the creative director, Nicholas Eppert, he had this to

919
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,520
say about the multiplayer. He says, you'll have up to four players. If they play together

920
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:31,720
in split screen we can only say that the fight will not only be on screen. So that's maybe

921
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,780
either referring to the fact that six people on the couch flailing about, it's gonna be

922
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:42,700
very difficult to do in that kind of environment, or that there's gonna be some sort of different

923
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:48,220
type of multiplayer in room or something. I'm sorry, games on Mario Party Wii are about

924
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:52,260
to get very violent in this house because Mario Party, as it is, is a cutthroat competition

925
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,260
around these parts.

926
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:58,160
Mario Party Wii is just begging for violence, it's going to be sad.

927
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,860
I was just, now that my mouse works again, I was reading some comments there in chat

928
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:06,940
room and Black Boy commented, I need OSX on my PS3.

929
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,180
Kind of a shout out to an old operating system that some folks have forgot about.

930
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,820
Is that the same Black Boy I met at Arena once?

931
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:13,820
I wonder.

932
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,620
If it is, hi buddy.

933
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:22,060
Some other things I was going to mention, Kojima of course is at Comic Con and one of

934
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:27,140
the fans asked him a few things about Metal Gear Solid, including, well they were saying

935
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:32,260
that it's going to be in playable form at next C3, which duh, and that it's going to

936
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:38,440
be in 1080p and there was no way for it to fit on DVD-9.

937
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,840
So I mean that's not too much, not a big surprise.

938
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:47,760
So I think we talked about this last week about how the Xbox 360 is possibly going to

939
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:57,120
get a bundle with Project Gotham Racing 3, a 1250 point card, and 3 months of Xbox Live

940
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,120
Gold.

941
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,120
Well it's sort of been confirmed.

942
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:04,360
It's starting to appear in retailers computers now.

943
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,280
They have the PGR 3 bundle in Toys R Us computer.

944
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:17,560
being sold for about the same price as a premium system and also was confirmed to be, let's

945
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:25,240
see, that was in like a Canadian Toys R Us, apparently there's another chain called BJ's

946
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:30,240
that's going to be carrying it in Circuit City's flyer in the newspaper.

947
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:35,760
They show the price for $489.99 US for the Project Gotham Racing 3 bundle.

948
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,500
It says it includes a pro console, a second wireless controller, play and charge kit,

949
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,500
and a copy of PGR3.

950
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:46,140
But that sounds more like a bundle that's being done through that site.

951
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:52,020
Apparently online they have the same type of thing, and there's like a $30 off web deal

952
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,460
or something, I don't know.

953
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:59,460
But something that may be coming soon, who knows, we'll probably find out pretty soon.

954
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:05,260
I'm just reading in chat right now, DJ Jenai said, I downloaded the Paris Hilton game,

955
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,500
And PK Akira 88 goes, get out!

956
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,260
Somebody said something and PK Akira 88 says, no, I mean get off my internet.

957
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,260
Haha.

958
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,260
Aww.

959
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:17,260
Harsh folks in chat room.

960
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:20,340
Hey, I got a question for you, because you were just talking about Project Gotham, so

961
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,820
speaking of racing games, somebody was sending me a private message, I think it was CKY Mike,

962
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,660
asking about Burnout 5 on PS3.

963
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,900
Have you heard anything about Burnout?

964
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,500
No, it's probably coming out in the fall, that would be my guess.

965
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,380
So it is coming for Playstation 3?

966
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,380
I'm sure they're...

967
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:41,380
Duh! They're coming out with another Burnout game. I mean, it's gonna be Burnout something. It is coming out probably in the fall.

968
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:49,380
That's kind of a given. It's just like saying, oh yeah, next year Madden 08's coming out. I mean, come on. It's not a big surprise.

969
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:58,380
But my guess, if anything, it would be probably coming out in March-ish, because that's when the Xbox 360 one came out last year.

970
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:03,460
obviously it's not coming out in September like it did last year for the

971
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:08,540
current gen stuff so if I were to guess that's a March probably for burnout I

972
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:13,820
know there's a lot of stuff September is gonna be a packed month for games in

973
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:19,500
October is even worse I mean just Final Fantasy 12 crack fine coming finally

974
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,860
coming in October yeah you won't see me no you can push more and more towards

975
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:28,620
November. God damn them. So yeah. Well it's coming out Halloween, how much further back

976
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:32,820
can you push to November? I don't know. But anyway. I swear to God, Squeenix, if you rob

977
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:39,000
me of Final Fantasy for another year, I am, it's not gonna be pretty. You need to stomp

978
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,120
and pout. I will stomp and pout in front of the Squeenix building and there will be video

979
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:49,400
on YouTube. You know, all it comes down to me is just Saints Row and fucking Dead Rising.

980
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,840
gonna be my games for August and I don't know there's a lot of games coming out

981
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:58,680
in August but a lot that I don't want like Bomberman X zero I mean it looks

982
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:08,120
like Bomberman and so that could be kind of fun but uh I found out I gotta buy

983
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:13,920
cars on the 360 for Nelly. Why? For achievement points? No cuz she want but I will get

984
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,520
achievement points on that no but she wants she wants that game. What's up with

985
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,340
Nelly getting into games lately you've talked about her playing bejeweled

986
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:24,900
cloning Clyde now she must play cars is she she wants me to buy elite beat agents

987
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:28,900
for her is she slowly becoming a gamer no is this marriage thing corrupting her

988
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:35,160
maybe hmm well she do you think she'll be into the week maybe cuz I'm not gonna

989
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:42,420

1000
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:42,240
ChromeHounds squad. Maybe we should do like an OLR army. Battle! Battle Royale! I'll buy

1001
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:49,040
the game just to blow the shit out of Scott's mech. And Bobby! Bring it Bobby! See that's

1002
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,960
the only thing about ChromeHounds online is I wonder if they actually just have multiplayer,

1003
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,840
like standard multiplayer, not that online, perpetual online thing. I gotta check that

1004
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,920
out because I haven't really delved into the multiplayer that much. Hmm. No, I haven't

1005
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,000
That would be fun though an inner show battle royale. I'm all for that

1006
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,760
I'm all for an inner show battle royale at some point on one of those games and stuff and we've talked about doing a

1007
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,120
Tournament thingy using all game, but we'll talk. We'll save that for another show. We want to end tonight's show

1008
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,320
