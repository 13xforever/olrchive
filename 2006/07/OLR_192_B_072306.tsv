19616	22817	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 192.
23458	28480	We're back here on this part B of our podcast and after a very exciting and
29048	32951	Strange Part A. We're back here to bring you some more gaming news.

74711	75651	So check that out.
76292	79333	We're here to talk about video games and get right back into the news.
80069	81089	Who's starting us off tonight?
81249	82110	That would be me.
82350	84511	Alright, Queen DarkSakura, what's up?
84751	86131	Hell yeah.
86531	90533	Actually, we've got some good news for our European listeners.
90693	93053	Actually, it's also good news for our American listeners.
93894	102817	There was a release from Nintendo of America stating that there was a small number of DS lights that had a crack in the casing on the left-hand side of the hinge.
103717	110080	and it's just above the power connector and it's like a .02% of the units have it so they're fixing those for free.
110521	119605	So Nintendo of Europe basically has announced that any faulty DS lights will be repaired for free as long as the fault in question is covered under the valid warranty.
121206	130551	So basically they're saying that if you have a problem with it you need to contact the local customer service area for Nintendo.
131415	134496	The DS lights carry a one-year warranty for manufacturing defects.
135056	138677	If it's covered under the warranty, it will be repaired for free.
139138	146920	So if you live in the UK, the number to call for Nintendo's customer service, and I have no idea how the phone numbers work, is 0870-6060-247.
146940	147580	Open 830 to 7 p.m.
147600	148241	at national rate.
155799	162962	You can also email at nintendoservicecenter at codestorm.co.uk And that's center spelled American way, I think.
164303	165103	ER.
165943	171105	The whole My DS is on Crack saga is very interesting, what's been going on with this.
172486	177288	Nintendo kind of first came out and said it's not a problem, but then just a couple days later they kind of did this.
177428	180589	Not just in the UK, but I know they've got something similar going on in the US as well.
180990	184351	Both the DS lights I've seen, Miklatov has one and my roommate Extifer has one,
184787	185969	and they're not cracking yet.
186209	186910	Mine's neither.
187131	188313	Yeah, oh, that's right, you got one too.
188333	189474	We could look at it.
189494	196906	It doesn't seem like it's this huge epidemic, but it's very interesting that Nintendo is kind of listening to the internet buzz and kind of...
198251	200952	Saving their ass from internet skewing left and right.
200992	201592	It's kind of interesting.
201912	203273	It's good customer service, I suppose.
203353	207254	Well, they might actually be skewing the numbers of how many DS lights are cracked.
207554	217718	For example, this was pointed out actually by MaxConsoleReader, there was a photo taken at the New York City flagship Nintendo World Store, and guess what?
219138	224660	Six to seven or six to eight of the DS lights in the store had the cracks.
225498	230501	Some of them were hairline cracks that were developing, and some were just full-blown cracks.
230581	234004	So that doesn't sound like .02% to me.
234544	236846	So, food for thought.
238607	249614	Anyways, speaking of other things, including the DS here, we've got a brand new game coming to the DS, which is actually kind of an interesting name.
249774	249895	It's...
251340	261325	Translates to Mario Nation Gears, and there's going to be 100 varieties of mechs, which not all of them will be simple two-legged robots.
262025	270008	Some of the machines will resemble insects, while some others transform the vehicles, and they'll have a variety of weapons, from bows to firearms.
271729	272730	Sounds very interesting.
272770	275131	It says the game's going to be played in full 3D.
276549	281411	The bottom screen is going to show the mech controls, which can be operated using the touch stylus.
282771	291754	And, I don't know, very interesting, especially with this game also kind of with Mario Nation Gears, maybe a Mario-themed mech game?
291894	294235	Because Mario has to be in everything!
294915	300417	Exactly, but yeah, I don't know, it's a different type of game, that's for sure.
301577	301877	All right.
302383	302763	DarkSakura.com.
325018	330260	They're going to have DS download stations at Toys R Us with six exclusive virtual gifts.
330700	334262	You can get a one-up mushroom, a star, a fire bar.
334762	335682	I know you love fire.
336223	338423	Gold flag, a question box, and a pipe.
338864	343505	And you can use this to decorate your virtual house and make all your internet friends jealous that you went to Toys R Us.
343886	347747	You can get these downloads through July 29th at your Toys R Us.
348187	349628	Are you going to do that, Dark Sakura?
350008	351549	I might, just so that I can...
352799	357623	I'm going to probably get rid of my bathroom that I'm building in my house and make a Nintendo room so that my HRA score goes up.
358123	359945	Did you ever rebuild your shrine to fire?
360545	361306	No, I did not.
361386	364949	I have a bathroom and I have a room with a bath in it.
365209	366029	I have the outdoor bath.
366490	368111	I have my huge-ass Japanese room.
368651	370933	I have a classic room because I always make a classic room.
370993	371774	And I have a green room.
372094	373976	Although the green room might be turned into a shrine to fire.
374916	377078	I do, however, have the bonfire.
378079	378879	I just haven't used it.
380681	380961	All right.
381965	387967	For those that don't know, DarkSakura on the GameCube version of Animal Crossing had a shrine to fire that I always felt compelled to visit.
389747	391628	One of the items was just a giant campfire, right?
391668	392648	A big bonfire.
392688	396909	And then you had all these drums that would play and all the little gyro thingies or whatever those are called.
396949	398329	They would gyrate around it.
398349	402370	Bowing down to the fire and the music was like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
402470	404631	It was the Japanese festival music.
404811	406071	Scary, scary stuff.
406111	408472	And it had like Biwa Lutes in the back and yeah.
409355	413017	HitStun says you should play Second Life and get a Shrine to Fire in Second Life.
413698	416139	It's one of those virtual world games.
416340	418081	I've checked out briefly.
418581	419842	Email me a link to it.
420702	427727	Jamie at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I think our buddies at All Games have something set up there, and I think our picture's in the game because of that.
428307	429848	But I don't know if there's an Orange Lounge area.
430389	431169	There should be.
431189	433651	Why don't we just kind of hang out in the All Games area, which is fine.
435692	436172	Thank you, Andrew.
436312	437033	Andrew's going to make us one.
437953	438214	Alright.
438554	438774	Alright.
439449	442892	Anyway, let's keep it moving, I guess.
444793	448396	Well, I like Animal Crossing a whole lot, as you well know.
449116	451898	So, guess what I'm all hyper and excited about?
452779	454600	Dobutsu no Mori, the movie!
454981	455661	Hooray!
456201	462206	For those who don't know what that means, it means Animal Forest, which was the Japanese name of Animal Crossing.
463006	464147	I actually own that game, you know?
464788	467850	I have the GameCube one in Japanese, but that's another story.
469106	470807	I thought it was a Nintendo 64 game originally.
471247	472087	Originally it was, yes.
472667	473608	But I have the GameCube one.
473728	474008	Gotcha.
474528	478869	Because I have the whole unlock disc thing.
481610	484571	Actually, the reason I bought it was to help my reading skills go up.
484891	485271	But anyway.
486132	489733	But yeah, they have released... There is a...
492584	493765	A movie coming out.
494606	496648	It's got a cute trailer online.
497609	509099	In fact, if you want to go see the official website for it, it's at doubutsunomori-movie.jp I'll spell that out for people who don't know how.
509299	514123	doubutsunomori-movie.jp
515270	525157	slash index.html It has interactive content online and also the trailer is available online if you do not know how to read Japanese, guess.
527579	529340	I have a quick follow-up on the Second Life thing.
529360	531802	Apparently, All Gamesville actually was taken down.
531962	536265	Funnydale says the guy who set it up had to delete the Arena Lounge from Second Life because he needed to save money.
538247	540789	Well, we'll just have to build it again!
542079	544080	Except this time it'll be the Orange Lounge Megadome.
544100	546140	But, you know, we'll have all games.
546600	547880	Hordom, of course, as well.
549461	550501	Yeah.
551541	553102	Well, that's very interesting.
554702	560844	Anywho, I was going to mention there's some actual new Wii pages that were on the Nintendo site.
561444	562804	The official Nintendo site there.
563184	566025	And Super Secret stuff was on there.
566645	570266	Of course, it's kind of funny because the Wii pages ended up being on there, but...
571656	576499	We Music is a full-blown game for the Wii, which is pretty awesome.
595205	601287	And Wii Music, for those who might not remember, during E3 was kind of like that demo where you're conducting an orchestra.
601447	603188	So, very interesting.
604548	614631	Among other things, of course, more information about the Wii Connect 24, and just kind of talking about some of the upcoming games, most of which were announced at E3.
615732	620433	But of course, if you want to check it out now, you can't because Nintendo pulled down the site and all the links.
620453	622954	You know someone saved the cache file.
624105	627546	No, but I do have screenshots, and I will hopefully upload them later.
627967	628227	Sweet!
628547	630448	Did you get to check this out yourself before they took it out?
630488	635730	No, I got to check out the screenshots of the website.
635810	637310	So it was interesting, though.
638751	641592	To be honest, it wasn't anything that we hadn't already really known.
641632	642733	No earth-shattering news.
642973	645934	Nothing new, no new games announced or anything like that.
646334	648635	All right.
649045	653989	Well, if you are excited to get your chance to play the Wii, you might get your chance a little sooner than you thought.
654629	662816	According to Punk News, the Nintendo Fusion Tour this year, you know how Nintendo sponsors this tour, the music fest every year they take around the country?
662856	664898	I think, didn't they have Evanescence one year, I want to say?
665458	666479	Maybe I'm on crack, I don't know.
666799	668801	But they have different artists that do this.
669681	672744	They're actually going to feature the Wii console at
673394	676957	Nintendo Fusion, and you will be able to try the console for yourselves hands-on.
677358	686206	Hopefully no five-hour lines like E3, but seeing as probably that many people that were in that line wouldn't be able to fit into a freaking arena, I don't know.
687167	690350	Hopefully your chances will be much better to actually get a chance to play the Wii.
690710	696976	So if you're not feeling so hot about the bands, hey, go and you could play the Wii while the main band's on stage.
697403	700085	But then again, that is an awful lot of money just to play a Wii.
700166	704610	So you really have to be a true Nintendo fanboy or fangirl to want to do that.
705330	708313	But hey, if you go, have fun and email us and tell us how it went for you.
710735	712155	and DarkSakura.com
741591	748674	I don't know, just about two weeks or so after the October 18th day.
749715	756898	And remember how we were speculating October 18th would be the actual launch day for the Wii in the United States?
756958	762421	It makes sense that there would be a two week delay until the Wii came out in the UK.
763570	772720	I seem to remember we talked about some story on the show before, though, that supported a six-week delay for the UK, and that's why, because some release dates had leaked for the UK, like Red Steel or something.
773381	780369	You have to go back in the archives a few episodes, but that UK delay seems to shift...
781846	785007	around when they bring up these different ideas for release dates?
785307	800610	I don't know, but to be honest though, November 3rd as the release date for Need for Speed Carbon sounds... I don't know, it sounds a little bit late to me, because I know Carbon's coming out in October in the United States.
803210	810312	I don't know, if that were true, if that actually was the launch date for the UK, I would say that the 18th is pretty feasible for
811275	815478	The United States, but right now it's just completely rumor-based.
816459	827746	And even rumor-based based on saying that this date... I mean, because there are obviously titles that come out a week or two later than the release date, so... I don't know.
828266	829367	Interesting, nonetheless.
830928	831828	I'd have to say so.
831989	833950	Well, as far as the release dates go...
836058	837278	Release dates go.
837418	844700	I actually do have the list of release dates for the 28th in the UK, if anybody is interested.
846061	850182	Sure, I want to know, even though I don't live there, but I know our friends that live there want to know.
850882	854223	Well, Civ City Rome is coming out, Civilization IV Warlords.
855660	868983	Field Commander, Formula 106, Juiced Eliminator, Pac-Man World 3 on the PC, Shin Megami Tensei, Siphon Filter, Dark Mirror, The Ant Bully, Tokyo Extreme Racer, and Tringo on Game Boy Advance.
871624	872144	Hmm, alright.
872844	873244	Interesting.
873284	874045	Well, the U.S.
874145	879186	isn't getting much more stuff being released, but anyways...
879861	880381	Let's see here.
880441	884082	Tekken Dark Resurrection, which is going to be a pretty big game, of course.
884423	887384	Painkiller Hell Wars is going to be coming out.
888404	891525	So far, I think that game actually might be delayed again, but who knows.
892085	895066	Civ IV Warlords for the PC.
895226	897267	Civ City Rome also on the PC.
898087	899668	Other than that, I think, what was it?
899788	903269	Ant Bully is coming out on the consoles and the portables.
904529	905270	That's about it.
905730	908971	There's a big, you know, blank space there until...
909898	910458	I like the undead.
936089	937770	You must be interested in Dead Rising too, though.
937790	940012	I mean, getting to kill zombies with anything you want.
940772	941713	I love zombies.
942273	943374	I especially love watching them.
943614	944875	You are a zombie some days.
946196	946636	Some days.
946876	947797	I've seen you in the morning.
947897	949057	You have seen me in the morning.
949097	954221	I'm like... It's like that scene in Shaun of the Dead where he's just getting up and stumbling to the door.
955762	956142	Like that.
956402	957082	I love that movie.
957323	957643	So do I.
958962	960983	All righty, well, thank you for the release date news.
961103	970387	And, you know, I feel sometimes left out when we do release dates, because DarkSakura does them and Loki does them, so I'm going to figure out, like, what our third... You can do the Ugandan one.
971527	972928	I forgot to mention some stuff.
972988	974369	I was going to confirm a few things.
974729	975049	Oh, sure.
975069	978750	There was a rumor control, or not rumor control, retail radar thing.
980191	981432	PS3 is not out until November 17th?
981492	982553	Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said PS3.
1008167	1009608	PS3 is in November.
1009749	1010109	My bad.
1011510	1013152	I thought that was really interesting.
1014092	1016875	That's all I got.
1016915	1018937	As I was saying, I feel left out when it comes to release dates.
1018977	1023781	I need to figure out what our third most listened to country is and do the release dates for there.
1024141	1025182	I think it's Australia.
1025562	1027084	You should do the Australian release dates.
1027404	1029205	I'll look into that.
1029285	1032028	Or maybe I could rotate around some of the other countries that listen to us.
1032148	1034250	Honestly, maybe we should start covering Japanese release dates.
1034330	1035531	Actually, that's not a bad idea.
1036380	1037861	Maybe we could go back and forth or something.
1038082	1038722	We'll see what to do.
1039643	1040764	I'll have to tutor you.
1040844	1042446	Yeah, seriously.
1042726	1044788	No, if we go there, then we're switching.
1044848	1046449	And you can do Japanese release dates.
1046529	1047871	I'll do UK release dates.
1047891	1050994	That's easier for me because I've never taken a class.
1051054	1053075	Anyway, we'll talk about that at our next staff meeting.
1053376	1057419	For now, let's talk about what Microsoft might be talking about at their staff meetings.
1057520	1060042	Blu-ray and what the hell they're going to be doing about it.
1060342	1068567	Well, actually, Major Nelson actually interviewed Amir Majidimur on his latest podcast, I suppose, or I'm sorry, blogcast, as he calls it.
1069488	1076432	And his group, Amir's group at Microsoft, oversees the audio-video compression technologies and had something interesting to say about Blu-ray.
1077192	1094891	According to Majid Amir, Blu-ray moves the recording surface very close to the top layer of the disc, protected by just a very thin coating, and this makes maintaining the high reliability of discs during the actual manufacturing process much more difficult.
1095371	1099193	Now, this factor is a really big difference between Blu-ray and HD DVD.
1100233	1110357	Well, HD DVD, like traditional DVDs, actually protects its data between two layers of protective plastic, above and below, thus making the manufacturing of the discs much more reliable.
1110877	1115739	So, kind of interesting there, the differences between the two formats, because
1116280	1116620	I don't know.
1117141	1125849	I guess when you look at them on an HDTV, there probably won't be a whole lot of difference, but it's hard for me to say when I haven't seen a lot of demos of Blu-ray.
1126390	1132676	But we shall see if Sony's next format takes off or ends up going the way of UMD.
1133637	1135579	I've been hearing not good about it, though.
1136209	1136729	We'll see.
1136909	1137190	I don't know.
1137250	1144554	I'm thinking maybe it's just because it's easy to pick on Sony right now, but I try to keep some hope, but it gets harder and harder every day.
1144935	1149117	Anyways, there's some actual funny stuff coming out here from EA.
1149177	1155161	Actually, I should say an EA employee who admitted to releasing crappy games.
1156562	1159624	I know EA is kind of a scapegoat here, but
1160080	1163961	They do have a lot of games that are just ports, especially the next-gen stuff.
1164522	1173985	Remember the Xbox 360 launch and how a lot of the games were just ports of the current-gen stuff with slightly more high-res graphics or whatever.
1175146	1180568	But anyways, there's actually a YouTube video out there now that you can play.
1183149	1183869	It's kind of interesting.
1183889	1187651	A little bit of a funny little thing there.
1188491	1188851	Check it out.
1192779	1196602	Alright, well, crappy games do not make us happy gamers.
1197302	1200564	And when we're not happy, we get ranty.
1209951	1214974	Why don't you start us off with our favorite segment, the FUs of the week, DarkSakura.
1215755	1217556	Oh my god, it's so hot!
1218897	1219998	FU to the hot!
1220919	1222800	Dear sun, piss off.
1223880	1233104	I want it to be dark, even more I want it to stay dry, and even more than that I want it to be a nice 72 degrees outside.
1234265	1242048	With slight overcast, and, okay, maybe not dry, maybe a little touch of water in the air so that it doesn't hurt to breathe.
1242468	1246990	I tried breathing outside, and it felt like I was breathing plaster.
1248071	1248691	It sucked.
1249838	1253721	So, an FU goes to our 113 degrees today.
1256183	1259105	Even worse that it's nighttime and 95 degrees.
1259746	1262248	I had our thermostat set down to 70.
1262708	1262988	It read 85.
1263028	1266151	That's not right.
1267072	1268032	Celsius, maybe.
1268333	1272856	And a sub-FU to everyone who complains about the, quote, humidity, Rob.
1272996	1273637	Oh, screw off.
1273677	1274217	Piss off.
1275158	1276339	Piss off right back at you.
1277239	1278000	It's not humid.
1278881	1279101	Loki.
1280414	1283595	I'm going to have to say F you to my cable being out.
1283775	1286156	Or not my cable, but my internet being out at home.
1286656	1289658	Comcast decided to take the crap because... Did you pay the bill?
1290038	1290658	Yes, I paid the bill.
1292078	1295379	Yes, because that's why my internet stops working and my cable's fine.
1295420	1296560	Because I didn't pay the bill.
1296600	1298100	That doesn't make any sense at all.
1298761	1305403	Anyways, so yeah, that really sucks and I couldn't read.
1311650	1315831	My FU of the week goes to Coldstone for being a diet's worst enemy.
1317452	1319272	I'm a victim of deliciousness, what can I say?
1319472	1319852	Andrew!
1320953	1322493	Who's been awfully quiet this segment.
1322813	1324234	Surely you have something for this.
1324774	1326774	Oh, hell yes.
1327435	1331016	Alright, I'm going to have to repeat that FU to the hot with a few things added on.
1331816	1334877	FU to the shitty air conditioner that is in our house.
1336038	1341663	The temperature climbs up, air conditioner decides to take a shit, and it's only 95 degrees in the house.
1342283	1343584	No wonder you're here tonight.
1343824	1345085	No wonder you're here tonight.
1345386	1352151	And it's so hot, it has never been so hot in my house that my computer will not run games.
1353232	1357355	My video card overheats and takes a shit, locks up the system within two minutes.
1357656	1358036	Wow.
1358136	1359517	It is that hot.
1361679	1362460	What are you gonna do?
1363320	1363861	I don't know.
1364858	1366860	You're going to have to run to Target and get a room.
1366960	1371443	I think I will spend the night in the lawn and sleep in sprinklers.
1371483	1373005	That is the only course of action for me.
1374026	1374506	Gosh.
1376988	1378689	Well, good luck to you, sucker.
1378910	1379450	End the angst.
1379810	1381011	All right, yes, let's end the angst.
1382833	1386135	Let's end the angst and get to our listeners, because they rock.
1386536	1387236	We love our listeners.
1387557	1392681	And we have a segment that we've been doing for a couple weeks now called the Voicemails of the Week, and we'd love to get your feedback.
1393524	1394245	on different topics.
1394285	1399608	And last week's topic that we gave to you guys for the voicemails of the week was, are games too easy?
1400028	1405692	We have two voicemails we want to play for you tonight, and here's the first feedback on the, are games too easy topic.
1406352	1419641	My name is Jack Monkey Upload, and basically answering your question of the week, and games back in the day were a lot cheaper to make, and you'd only have like two guys, two or three guys, and it would take them a couple months to make a game, and
1420171	1427017	It's been most of their time making the game itself and the levels were like really easy to make and wouldn't take that much time.
1427838	1441790	But nowadays, the levels for like the new games are spent with like hundreds of maybe thousands of people and like a lot of them are artists that just maybe work on just the levels and some of them might only work on the end levels.
1442650	1447895	And you spend like tens of millions of dollars on a game, you want everyone to play like the majority of the way through.
1448424	1457409	because if most people only play through like half a million dollars worth of your game, then you might as well just spend half a million on it instead of spending 10 million.
1457429	1472356	Yeah, I think this trend's also going to increase because next-gen games are getting really expensive, so you're going to see games that anybody can complete just so they'll get through the majority of it and see everything.
1472377	1475078	All right, that's all I wanted to say.
1475758	1477039	I'll listen to you guys this weekend.
1477964	1478144	CopyCode
1502205	1510091	Well, I actually, at Classic Gaming Expo, I went to a panel for the guy who did... Oh, God, I can't remember the names.
1510491	1518518	Who did, like, Combat, and Pac-Man, and Battlezone, and a lot of those old Atari classics.
1519218	1526624	And they're basically saying about how they were expected to crank out as close to perfect versions of arcade games, and how...
1530031	1530692	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1549733	1554639	I think, though, that now, because we have such a greater capacity, a lot more does go into it.
1555019	1556400	And you do have more people you gotta pay.
1556441	1557261	It does cost more.
1557682	1559884	So, yeah, they have to make these levels cost-effective.
1560145	1565430	And on top of that, you know, they also have to think about the attention span of the average gamer today, too.
1567593	1568354	Anders, you have a thought, too?
1568374	1571177	Yeah, my take on it is, nowadays, you know...
1572162	1574022	Game making is a big business.
1574042	1574943	It's like Hollywood.
1575583	1579924	And it's not so much that we're playing games anymore, it's that we're watching them, we're experiencing them.
1580524	1582704	They've got to have the deep storyline, all that kind of stuff.
1583064	1594127	You take how hard games like, say, Ghouls and Ghosts was, and then you compare it to, you know, this isn't a completely fair analogy, you compare it to Prey, which just came out.
1594687	1596908	It's not so much you're playing a game anymore, you're playing a movie.
1597588	1598628	So much went into it,
1598956	1604181	and there's just one way that they want you to play through it so you experience the way that they want you to do it.
1604782	1608726	Now Prey is one of the most easy first person shooters that I've ever played in my life.
1611488	1622139	Which isn't saying much, but it's just there's one way that they want you to play it and usually it's the easiest way because they want you to finish it.
1622179	1622900	They want you to
1623923	1631785	Prey is also interesting when you talk about those big budgets and stories because it doesn't... I was talking about this in my review of the demo last week.
1631825	1634226	There's no real cutscenes in Prey, at least it seems like.
1634286	1635967	Everything is very seamless.
1635987	1637267	Yeah, they took a cue from Half-Life 2.
1637347	1639788	Well, from Doom 3, really, in its engine.
1639808	1642149	But yeah, it all kind of comes back to that.
1643149	1645930	I sort of like the cinematic element games.
1646170	1646570	I do too.
1646610	1647930	I think Prey is a beautiful game.
1647970	1649871	Did anyone ever play Berserk on Dreamcast?
1649891	1649931	No.
1651031	1655433	I was going to say Berserk on Atari 2600 with the bouncy happy face, but no, I haven't played it.
1655573	1665678	Actually, it came out before we got the anime over here, and I started actually picking up the fan subs after that and downloading manga scans just because it was like freaking playing through the anime.
1665938	1667058	It was so perfect.
1667639	1668599	There was so much good.
1668619	1671540	I like the games that give a more in-depth story.
1671660	1679464	I think that it has a lot of the action that you want, but at the same time, you're compelled to keep playing because the story is so good.
1680814	1685938	Well, let's hear another voicemail from our second voicemail and last voicemail for tonight on this same topic.
1687139	1688560	Hey, what's up, Orange Island Radio?
1688600	1690481	This is SpeedyF40 from Michigan.
1690781	1693043	And I think about the video games getting harder.
1694083	1695044	I don't think they're getting harder.
1695084	1697385	I think they're getting less accessible for people.
1698086	1700367	Like back when Pac-Man and stuff was out,
1701829	1702290	and so on.
1717179	1719319	There's a ton more objectives nowadays.
1720080	1722240	And the controllers have so many more buttons on them.
1723180	1727261	Even though it's easier to beat the game, they're just harder to play.
1728101	1731782	So I just think video games are now less accessible to the average person.
1732102	1733802	They're just easier to us because we're gamers.
1734283	1734723	Thanks, guys.
1734763	1734983	See ya.
1737923	1738303	Interesting.
1739224	1741444	Kind of talking about the accessibility to everybody.
1742164	1742824	So what do you guys think?
1744365	1745485	That's a very valid point.
1745665	1745945	I mean...
1748043	1754847	Actually, I think that's the point that Nintendo is trying to do with the Wii controller, trying to simplify things and make it to where it's more attractive.
1755647	1757788	I mean, in one degree, it's not as simple.
1758108	1760749	To another degree, I think it's very simplifying.
1760769	1763831	I mean, you move your hand, that's all you do.
1764411	1776237	I think that that whole accessibility thing of being able to actually get into it, being able to pick up the controller and know what to do with it, I think that that's a lot of the issue that we have these days.
1776661	1781465	and make it more accessible to people who don't have the patience to read the damn manual.
1783166	1783907	A lot of people don't.
1784087	1787349	I mean, you're going to have a hard time telling a non-gamer to read the manual.
1787530	1789451	I'm sorry, that's bitter tech support coming through again.
1790072	1797738	Anyway, thank you guys so much for the voicemails of the week and of course we don't always have enough time to play everything that we get but we do try to listen to all of the voicemails.
1797778	1802061	Actually, we do listen to every single voicemail and we really appreciate you guys calling in.
1802081	1803602	If you want to leave us a voicemail, the number is 916-226-9067
1806297	1806757	DarkSakura.com

1826574	1826674	E.T.
1826694	1826754	E.T.
1826794	1826854	E.T.
1826874	1826934	E.T.
1853396	1855137	Don't let DarkSakura influence you.
1855197	1859700	We want to know what you think on this topic, so please call us anytime during the week and leave us a voicemail.
1859880	1862502	Speaking of entities that suck...
1863183	1869224	It looks like Sony's trying to make our friends over in the UK bend over and take it, just like they're doing for us.
1869824	1882506	There is a notice that was out that both the 20GB and 60GB versions of the PlayStation 3 are going to be out in the UK, however not both of them on launch day.
1883106	1891768	They're working by consulting with some of the different merchandisers to basically set up the different SKUs for both.
1892388	1892988	Both items.
1895929	1901991	There is a note that though it may not necessarily be both at launch.
1902031	1907853	In fact, there's a quote here from David Wilson for Sony UK saying that he actually doesn't know.
1909714	1916156	He explained that Sony has to face what the challenge would be of offering a choice without confusing the consumers.
1916576	1919880	meeting the needs of the retailers, etc., blah, blah, blah.
1920961	1926907	However, they are actually saying, though, that for pre-ordering a PlayStation 3, it is going to be £150.
1927087	1930571	That's a retail suggestion.
1932913	1933714	Well, we'll see.
1934054	1935876	That's expensive, man.
1935896	1938279	Yeah, poor guys in the UK getting screwed on those prices.
1939526	1942048	Is their tax rates higher over there too?
1942228	1943669	They get double screwed, don't they?
1944209	1953674	The final price is again, it's November 17th in Europe, 600 euros converting to 425 pounds in the UK.
1955756	1956236	Interesting.
1956656	1968483	Well, they're going to need to make all the money that they can because according to an IBM engineer, he's making a comment about their chip yields for the cell processor and how hard it is to get these chips to
1969657	1970377	Be made right.
1971498	1976599	Basically, he's saying that for every sheet that they press, 10-20% of them work.
1977420	1977960	And that's it.
1978120	1992805	And it costs, say for example, $1,000 to produce a wafer with 100 chips on it, and if only 10 or 20 of those are going to be working, that increases the cost of the system significantly.
1993805	1994646	Wow.
1994786	1995886	That's not very good.
1997187	1998187	But yeah, it
1999568	2000189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2019130	2021432	Are we going to see a lot of these consoles at launch?
2021652	2024654	And is the launch even going to be happening when they say they are?
2024794	2028396	Well, now, I think this story just barely missed the cut for tonight.
2028456	2033419	But I seem to remember reading somewhere that the PS3s have actually gone into production now at this point, finally.
2033920	2036521	So, unfortunately, I don't have a lot more details than that.
2036561	2038062	But, you know, that's all you pretty much need to know.
2038082	2039083	PS3s are finally on their way.
2039143	2042645	So, I mean, you see that Sony's gearing up for this, you know.
2044006	2045307	A lot of people are starting to get nervous.
2045327	2046248	Like, are they going to have enough time?
2046288	2047929	Well, now, okay, maybe they could do this.
2048752	2050153	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2075737	2080299	Now, if the defect rate is 99%, you only get one chip per wafer, and it costs you $1,000.
2080619	2086161	So, if 10-20% of the chips are working, that's pretty expensive.
2087562	2091363	And that's assuming there's not going to be any glitches or whatever with this stuff.
2092123	2092464	I don't know.
2093484	2094944	It's not good, but you know what?
2095105	2099826	I think that they're going to be able to find some way to keep the costs down.
2100127	2103888	Obviously, they know what they're doing, so we'll see.
2104571	2107053	Alright, you know I got a look at chat room going on here.
2107513	2111456	Blaze Revolution says it's 17.25% in the UK for the tax.
2112977	2113877	That's vicious.
2114117	2114458	Wow.
2114878	2115218	Let's see.
2115678	2123524	OL Army Eddie says $200 to pre-order a PS3 here and I know he's in Vancouver because I was talking about my recent vacation with him.
2124765	2125385	Let's see what else.
2125465	2129788	Blaze Revolution simply says push back the release date then go back and fix this crap.
2131289	2132530	They're not going to do that, you know.
2133587	2135547	Raven's Dolphin says it's a rumor, Sky, a rumor.
2138348	2141789	Everything's a rumor until they come out and say it, and they're not going to.
2141809	2142529	So you know what?
2142569	2145709	We'll just find out when the launch happens, and we'll see what's going on.
2145809	2147050	Here comes the doom and gloom, too.
2147090	2149730	We have Anoush says, or I'm sorry if I pronounced that wrong.
2149770	2151271	I always have to apologize for that.
2151611	2158272	Anoush says the end of Sony Core is close, and Quicksilver says I think Sony is screwed.
2158992	2160492	I don't think it's going to be the end of them.
2160893	2162013	No, they're a huge company.
2162053	2163213	They still have Vegas.
2163655	2170240	and the whole thing is they could come out with something really remarkable that we don't know about that they're just kind of keeping under wraps.
2170560	2176544	The thing is right now though, it's kind of just the trend where everyone's posting doom and gloom stories about them.
2176824	2180807	We're not going to know until we actually see the launch of what's going on because say for example...
2181345	2184948	Laser in our chatroom says, no, Sony has a good plan, it's easier to just replace everything than it is to QA
2204976	2207458	Remember when all we had to worry about was disc read errors?
2208099	2208959	Now look at all this shit.
2209140	2219688	Remember back for the first PlayStation how you'd have to end up turning your system upside down or sideways because the laser mechanism wasn't aligned right?
2220028	2220508	Exactly.
2220589	2222550	They started actually just selling replacement parts for $13.
2222590	2228595	This might be it for Sony and PlayStation.
2229115	2229456	I don't know.
2229896	2230176	I don't know.
2230356	2231257	I don't know if I'd go that far.
2232847	2240068	Well, anyway, we've been talking a lot about chips, and this is something interesting you can do to that chip inside your DS Lite.
2240749	2242649	You know how you can overclock your computer?
2243309	2247610	Well, a Japanese gamer has figured out a way to overclock your DS Lite.
2248070	2254511	Now, obviously, this is not an easy process, but if you want to check it out, you can head over to Engadget.
2254991	2257832	They ran a story on July 19th on how to overclock your
2258271	2259172	Nintendo DS.
2259212	2261774	And this process will probably take you several hours.
2262114	2272683	You have to open up your DS Lite, drill a hole in the side, solder several different areas on it, and make sure you don't touch too much of the bad areas that will break the whole damn thing.
2273264	2275566	And now this has been translated into English.
2275646	2279409	If you want to take a look at this, I believe the site is ndshotmod.com.
2280210	2283913	But of course, remember, this would be violating your warranty.
2285154	2288436	Nice proof of concept, but what exactly is it supposed to accomplish?
2289136	2289616	Homebrew.
2290577	2291177	Overclocking?
2291297	2292498	It's just for homebrew stuff.
2294639	2295019	I don't know.
2296099	2306685	Essentially what this hack will do, reports are saying, it will actually physically increase the speed of visuals and sound between 1.4 times and 1.7 times, which means it's pretty much unplayable.
2306725	2311447	It's uncontrollable, high-pitched music, and rather a pain in the butt to be playing.
2311963	2313763	So this is something you do.
2313843	2315644	And you thought WarioWare got fast.
2315804	2318125	Only because you're like a hardcore hacker.
2318465	2321425	Like the same type of person that would install Linux on a toaster.
2321946	2322586	This is for you.
2323546	2324126	Have fun.
2324766	2325186	Have fun.
2327327	2328367	Yeah, VX, JSON, XB.
2328387	2329387	This is something he'd do, right?
2330288	2333148	No, actually I know several people who are engineers who do it.
2333208	2339610	Personally, I think the better hack that they had was for the original DS where you can actually make it as bright as a DS Lite.
2340994	2342115	Using a firmware upgrade.
2342776	2347300	I'm still plenty pleased with my Game Boy Advance and Afterburner.
2348541	2349141	That was awesome.
2349722	2352704	And speaking of awesome, I have another story.
2354228	2360012	Cartoon Network has a new massively multiplayer online game coming out.
2360412	2369739	They're working with, I guess it's Grygon Entertainment, to make one that will have Blue, Ben 10, Mac, and the kids next door.
2370559	2377804	And I love Kotaku because the writing is so honest and takes no prisoners.
2379654	2382515	Basically saying that it sounds like a formula for instant crap.
2383735	2388536	However, there's a couple... Toontown Online?
2388616	2388836	What?
2389636	2393697	Disney has a Toontown Online thing for... Stop distracting me!
2393857	2394177	Shush!
2394557	2395657	Where's the ferret when we need it?
2396317	2396917	I don't even know.
2397677	2398058	He died.
2398938	2401278	The game is going to be a free download.
2402418	2405659	It's actually... You'll have a subscription service.
2406583	2408104	PeeWee's Playhouse Saved by the Bell Rock
2437188	2444615	Seriously, I want to say Extra for Sister and Miklatov were watching Pee-Wee's Playhouse the other night and I kind of caught a little bit of it.
2445856	2446757	So freaking funny.
2447177	2447998	I mean, seriously.
2448719	2450580	That was the kind of crack we were fed as kids.
2450620	2451201	That's awesome.
2451802	2452022	I know.
2452162	2453523	That show was badass.
2454664	2454904	Anyway.
2455065	2457927	I remember being so freaked out because what was the cowboy's name?
2459529	2459629	Um...
2460757	2462458	I don't know, but it wasn't Lawrence Fisher in the play.
2462498	2462898	Yes, it was.
2463258	2463938	Cowboy Bob?
2464338	2466579	I'm sure someone in chat is yelling it right now.
2466639	2468500	I remember being young and being freaked out by him.
2468520	2468940	Cowboy Curtis.
2469020	2469661	Cowboy Curtis.
2469681	2471041	Thank you, DarkSakura.
2471461	2474983	He says, I can't do the pajama party because I sleep in the nude.
2477264	2477684	Wow.
2478564	2482446	I remember being so traumatized by this when I was little.
2483266	2484827	Not really traumatized, just thinking it was...
2485926	2486547	He's naked!
2486827	2493971	You know what fucking traumatized me about Pee-Wee Herman and all that stuff when I was little is the movie, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.
2493991	2494611	I love Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.
2494631	2497493	Do you remember the scene when he gets in the truck and there's Large Marge?
2498053	2498334	Yeah.
2498354	2498954	That's the story.
2499374	2500695	And she does the face.
2500795	2503937	She does the face and it looked a lot like this.
2503957	2504797	Like this!
2504817	2505138	Yeah!
2505158	2505758	The whole thing.
2505978	2507779	It was dark and stormy.
2507799	2509700	It scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.
2509880	2510861	I mean, my God.
2511690	2513291	No wonder I came out so fucked up.
2531581	2531901	Gameplay HD
2559738	2560619	GameplayHD knows what they're doing.
2586579	2588621	This channel needs to make it big.
2608450	2612152	It sounds like they know what they're doing with this network, and I'm very excited to see what comes of it.
2612472	2622038	And I think a lot of us that feel like G4 was a joke, in its later years anyway, are going to be much happier by what GameplayHD is going to bring.
2622398	2623559	So, check it out.
2623979	2636086	So, basically this agreement right now with GameplayHD, like I said, includes the three circuits of the 2006 World Series of Video Games, the Land War Competition in Louisville, Kentucky, which is being held June 16th,
2637230	2640172	DreamHack Land Party DreamHack Land Party DreamHack Land Party
2663393	2663874	PGR 3, Guild Wars
2681181	2681761	Thanks for watching!
2698812	2699212	Perfect!
2699612	2700712	That's what we need!
2700752	2702253	Is a game station run by a gamer?
2702793	2708314	I don't think he runs it, but I don't remember exactly the relation, but I apologize, but I'm going off the top of my head.
2708354	2709854	I don't have notes on that.
2710194	2717875	If you happen to get Dish Network and you have HD, the channel can be found on Dish Channel 9485.
2717955	2718396	Seriously?
2718516	2719816	It makes me want to switch to satellite.
2720656	2721016	Why not?
2722056	2726697	The only reason is because I save on the internet by having the game on the internet through the same company.
2727130	2727710	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2755523	2762326	I'll be damned if it doesn't seem like every week we're hearing about some damn Wii button, Wii flap, Wii secret compartment that you can put your weed in.
2762906	2764307	I don't know what they're coming with.
2764327	2764847	Your weed?
2765047	2767428	Get it, huh?
2768808	2769489	Well, get this.
2769549	2777072	There was a new promo picture in the latest issue of Nintendo Power that seems to indicate that there is yet another damn Wii button.
2778132	2784874	And it looks like it's some type of new Z button, kind of like the one that's on the GameCube's controller, like a little teeny shoulder thing.
2785414	2790916	No idea how the hell you're going to reach it because you'd have to have another thumb growing out of your thumb to hit it.
2791416	2794897	But maybe it's like a volume control for the internal speaker.
2794957	2796657	That's a theory that's going around right now.
2797397	2799738	But if that's going to be one you're supposed to frequently hit in the game,
2800305	2805949	That is going to be a pain in the ass, as if playing with a remote control is not going to be weird enough.
2806209	2808331	Although, I don't know, when I played at E3, it felt okay to me.
2808571	2811153	It didn't feel like the wrist cramp that it sounded like on paper.
2811894	2813375	I don't know if it's just me that felt that way.
2814095	2814556	Interesting.
2814936	2815176	All right.
2816044	2818326	Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line right now.
2818386	2821108	It's www.orangeloungeradio.com.
2821148	2829455	Click on Interact With Us and you can call our show by calling username OrangeloungeRadio or by picking up the phone and dialing 916-226-9067.
2829795	2835480	Feel free to comment on anything that's been brought up throughout the show and we'd love to get your feedback and opinion.
2835900	2840864	Meanwhile, I will ask before we open up the Skype line, are there any last minute stories we have from anyone tonight?
2841144	2842105	There's one.
2842385	2842585	What's up?
2842605	2843325	At least for me.
2844426	2846847	The Luminous 2 soundtrack has been revealed.
2846887	2851110	I'd also like to thank Tiger Call for the link.
2852471	2864958	Going to be in Luminous 2, we have Beck, Black Tambourine, Black Eyed Peas, Pump It, Chemical Brothers, Star Guitar, Fatboy Slim, Gangster Trippin', The Go Team, Bottle Rocket, Gwen Stefani, Hollaback Girl, yay.
2866275	2871536	Ruba Stank, Born to Lead, Junior Senior, Take My Time, Missy Elliott, Lose Control, another blah.
2872057	2875577	And some random song by New Order, which New Order I can't go wrong with.
2876138	2877198	That is so weird.
2877738	2879058	It's just a weird lineup.
2879178	2881019	But Luminous is definitely going mainstream.
2881059	2882839	As long as Mondo Grosso is coming back, I'm cool.
2882879	2884640	Well, those actually are going to be the ones with videos.
2885960	2888921	Also, ones without videos are going to be Junkie XL, Breezer.
2889441	2890302	and Stigmato Inc.
2890362	2891342	with Reality Check.
2891362	2896525	And also there will be more tracks from the Japanese artists Mondo Grosso, Ken Ishii and Tech Writers.
2897185	2897445	All right.
2898145	2899746	Well, let's go skypline.
2899766	2900367	We're getting a call.
2902167	2905789	There's a couple calls have already come in that we've missed, but we want to get the Luminous 2 news out there.
2905829	2906390	So call back.
2907150	2908451	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2908491	2908891	Who's this?
2909571	2911332	Hi, it's Raven Stolfen.
2911512	2912272	Hey, Raven Stolfen.
2912293	2913013	What's on your mind, buddy?
2913753	2915114	The UMD.
2915734	2917135	What do you want to talk about with UMDs?
2918895	2922517	I want to talk about the UMD is dead because of BitTorrent.
2923798	2924298	Really?
2924378	2925498	What's your theory there?
2925639	2925879	Why?
2927319	2933843	I mentioned this before and I said that I've been getting all my movies and all my stuff on BitTorrent and this is what Sony should do.
2933903	2935424	They should put everything on BitTorrent.
2936244	2938045	So you basically admit that you steal your movies?
2940790	2941751	Which is fine.
2941831	2942651	At least you're honest.
2943872	2949575	I'm not trying to say it makes you a bad person or whatever, but you're what the MPAA is not happy with right now.
2951857	2952717	So let me ask you this.
2952757	2954018	Let me turn around and ask you this.
2954358	2957560	What would be a way that you would legitimately pay for movies?
2957780	2960922	What would make you stop using BitTorrent and legitimately pay for movies?
2962103	2966025	It's probably going to sound really cheesy as hell, but the Sony Connect service.
2966665	2969587	But I really think they've got a good model and I think it's going to work.
2970615	2976099	Okay, so on one hand you give Sony a little bit of shit for the UMD, but on the other hand you give them some props for the Sony Kinect.
2976940	2979502	Yeah, I think they got a good plan going with this.
2979582	2990431	If they try to connect this with the Xbox Live model, but not like it, like charge little games for the PSP, and like movies, I think they really have something to go with, but that's just me.
2992234	2997058	Um, it's interesting you bring up Xbox, because I'm waiting for the day when Xbox does this.
2997198	3005385	All they need is a bigger hard drive on that thing, and, you know, with the active downloads and everything, you could totally and easily download movies on that thing.
3005445	3007487	Hell, you can already download...
3008087	3009208	Oh, one more thing.
3009268	3009808	What's up?
3036994	3047100	I was surfing Singular.com and they have a little ringtone for The Internet is for Porn from Avenue Q. Why did that make you think of us?
3049261	3050782	Because it's so random.
3050862	3060006	It's just like, and I'm going to purchase it soon so everyone that I walk down the street for my phone raises going, The Internet is really, really great for porn.
3061027	3061347	Wow.
3061707	3062988	We have some crazy listeners at OLR.
3063008	3064729	There's also one of her Cage Band songs.
3065283	3066504	I know, ages ago, ages ago.
3066924	3068784	Anyway, Raven Stolfen, thanks so much for the call.
3068804	3069905	We appreciate your insight, all right?
3069925	3070645	Have a good one.
3070725	3072546	And I hope they don't come after you and sue you, okay?
3073306	3073966	Oh, they won't.
3074127	3075767	It's just a pseudonym, not your real name.
3076107	3080749	If they try to sue you, you can countersue them for invasion of privacy and for search without a warrant.
3081569	3082530	Thanks, Dark Sakura.
3082610	3083130	You're welcome.
3083430	3085191	Legal advice from Orange Lounge Radio.
3087052	3087892	Did you go to law school?
3088664	3098202	No, I've taken a lot of business law, but honestly, the people that were countersuing the RIAA and the MPAA were using those tactics for countersuits.
3098662	3099844	Let's go to another call.
3100945	3102086	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3102106	3102486	Who's this?
3102926	3104087	It's Legend of Zaku.
3104327	3104928	Hi, buddy.
3104968	3105588	What's on your mind?
3106769	3112513	Just the fact that, you know, seconding the whole UMD thing and the whole format wars as we'd like to see it.
3113314	3116776	Honestly, at the end of the day, you know it's going to hurt the consumer.
3116856	3118598	They're going to stick with the DVD regardless.
3119478	3121139	Because no one's ready to shift, right?
3121360	3126943	No one's ready to shift to a new format, especially when there's, like, God knows how many are already out there.
3127744	3130066	Should the PlayStation 3 have had a UMD slot?
3131082	3139403	Um, it really, I, I don't know, I don't, then they'll be copying Nintendo and trying to, you know, trying to play a portable gaming system on a console.
3140104	3140184	What?
3140204	3141124	Like they do with the Game Boy.
3141184	3142224	No, I'm talking about for movies.
3142744	3143244	Oh, for movies.
3143284	3144484	I mean, I guess.
3144504	3145264	Gaming is one thing.
3145364	3148005	Okay, I guess hypothetically, why not play the games too?
3148085	3148525	Why not?
3149345	3150325	Yeah, I mean, but then.
3150665	3152006	How's that copying Nintendo?
3153166	3157567	Because they did it with the Game Boy, you know, the Game Boy player, the little device that, you know.
3157687	3160047	I don't know if I call it copying, I just call it smart.
3161615	3164818	Make your games playable on more systems or more and more places.
3165839	3166539	Oh, well, whatever.
3166860	3167200	It's fine.
3167660	3168801	But the bottom line is this.
3168861	3174666	I mean, Hollywood is pretty much split on both formats.
3174726	3178449	It's like half is going to support, you know, HD DVD.
3178509	3179830	The other half is Blu-ray.
3180790	3184213	The same thing happened with DVD and DivX, though, and look how long the war lasted.
3184954	3188797	Well, DivX got out and, you know, only lasted three years while DVD's still running.
3188817	3190258	Because DivX downright sucked.
3191022	3194585	I really never got your opinion on how mobile gaming works.
3217922	3219763	You know, what's your take on mobile gaming?
3219983	3223225	Okay, I can say a lot about mobile gaming.
3223265	3224186	I'm not a big fan of it.
3224206	3224826	What do you want to know?
3225387	3228549	Well, granted, I already started a job in the mobile gaming industry.
3229489	3230770	Make games that don't suck.
3231571	3233892	Yeah, we've got licenses for stuff.
3233932	3240076	Okay, don't put games that were built for PlayStations and stuff.
3240136	3241757	Don't put those games on mobile.
3241857	3242517	It doesn't work.
3243058	3245339	The game that I'm working on already sold a million.
3245379	3246800	I'm working on the Spanish version of it.
3247438	3248138	What is it, Bejeweled?
3268726	3272928	Those are the types of games that work on mobile because those are the type of people playing mobile games or uber casual gamers.
3273328	3275689	The gamer gamers have a DS or a PSP.
3276269	3276570	Right.
3277050	3282112	Unless they created some sort of cell phone similar, you know, exceeding the capabilities of the N-Gage.
3283633	3286054	And it had, you know, the marketing and hype to back it up.
3286114	3292497	Well, the problem with the N-Gage is that it was a phone first, gaming system second, but yet it thought it was a gaming system first in the marketing.
3292517	3292737	I mean...
3293237	3294899	Yeah, two platforms in the N-Gage.
3295039	3301684	One is the proprietary one, which the games are based on, and also Java, if I recall correctly, Symbian.
3301704	3305668	So they were like, you know, it was three platforms, two of which were pretty open.
3306108	3307529	So you're working on the Spanish version of the game.
3307549	3308290	Habla Español?
3309331	3309871	Um, yeah.
3310151	3313134	I guess, you know, I understand a lot more than I speak.
3313314	3315196	I lost my fluency when I came here.
3315356	3315696	That's fine.
3316076	3318418	Alright, buddy, we gotta let you go, but have a good one, okay?
3319099	3319379	Alright.
3319439	3319879	Alright, later.
3321477	3323058	We'll take one more call if you want to call us.
3323118	3325701	It's www.orangeloungeradio.com.
3325721	3329604	Click on Interact With Us, or you can always pick up the phone, 916-226-9067.
3330324	3331565	Oh, and here comes a call.
3332146	3333266	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3333306	3333727	Who's this?
3335028	3336089	Hi, this is Eddie.
3336609	3336969	Hey, Eddie.
3336989	3337690	What's on your mind, buddy?
3339131	3343194	Yeah, I just wanted to comment on another part of the PSP.
3343214	3343454	Okay.
3343875	3344075	Okay.
3346010	3353012	Basically, what I'm really confused about is how Sony is doing this whole huge homebrew war on the PSP, right?
3355013	3365236	And on the PS3, they're now using Linux as their operating system on the PS3, which is kind of opening the door for homebrew.
3366396	3372938	So why is it that they're battling homebrew on platform and then welcoming it with open arms on another?
3373447	3375328	I'm going to throw this to our homebrew expert.
3375388	3376449	Loki, do you have a thought on this?
3376789	3379651	Because the PlayStation 3 is a computer.
3382533	3382833	So?
3383654	3384194	So that's why.
3384294	3387236	Why does Sony have one policy here and another policy here?
3387316	3396262	Because I'm sure that they're thinking that their bases are covered with the PlayStation 3 and the fact that the PlayStation 3 needs all the help it can get to sell.
3397583	3397883	Well...
3398516	3402638	Okay, but how long before a Nintendo emulator comes out for the PS3?
3402838	3403198	Two days.
3406019	3406939	Well, exactly then.
3406999	3413002	Then shouldn't, like, when that happens, shouldn't, like, Sony be battling that too?
3413963	3418386	It's going to be a lot harder for them to do since they're using Linux.
3418426	3424651	If I remember correctly, they can also boot into other operating systems.
3425031	3429314	They're even saying they can maybe install Windows or OSX or something on there.
3429334	3431456	I don't know.
3431576	3437940	That's going to be hard to regulate unless they have some sort of crippled version of Linux on there that doesn't allow certain things to run or something.
3438020	3439181	I don't know how they're going to do that.
3439781	3442123	Yeah, PS3 version running Windows.
3442563	3443464	That'll be the day.
3444036	3445036	It'd be the great irony.
3446637	3448077	Well, yeah, that's all I wanted to say.
3449477	3450938	Alright, well, thank you very much for the call.
3451058	3453338	Have a good one, and we'll see what happens with Sony's policy.
3453618	3459700	I kind of think the gimped version of Linux is a more... I think that's kind of what we're looking at is the reality of what's going to happen.
3460320	3460980	Yeah, I guess so.
3461600	3461900	Thank you.
3462181	3463321	Alright, not a problem.
3463341	3463921	Thanks for the call.
3466082	3468222	Alright, sorry, I'm trying to fix my mouse here.
3468242	3471823	The batteries just died during that call there, so I'm trying to
3472625	3473505	Get reorganized here.
3473626	3474126	Sorry about that.
3475346	3476727	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
3476767	3478068	Thank you guys so much for calling in.
3478328	3479509	We appreciate your insight.
3480109	3484691	And if you didn't get through tonight, or if you were that person that had connection problems, you can always leave us a voicemail.
3485092	3485812	We love voicemails.
3486652	3491215	And you can listen earlier in the show if you want to see how to leave us a voicemail of the week and what our topic is this week.
3491735	3493076	Any more last-minute stories, folks?
3493236	3493496	Yes.
3493916	3494697	All right, Loki, what's up?
3495077	3496418	Well, a couple things about the Wii.
3497078	3498319	As I mentioned in the story before...
3499835	3529547	well before about the secret pages on the Wii I did find those finally someone had them on file share or let's see here we've got a few things with of course they're saying the Nintendo Wi-Fi service is going to be free just like it is for the DS and they were saying you know of course the frame code system and that type of thing what I also found was interesting they renamed WarioWare to WarioWare Dojo now instead of Brawl
3530714	3531474	That's kind of neat.
3531975	3532815	Or not WarioWare.
3534076	3534877	Super Smash Brothers.
3535317	3536137	What the hell am I talking about?
3536798	3540300	Anyways, on top of that, that wasn't the most neat thing I found.
3541220	3549766	There was kind of an interview in GamePro with the people behind Red Steel.
3550246	3552247	And they were talking about the multiplayer.
3552887	3557150	And basically the creative director, Nicholas Eppert,
3557697	3560418	He had this to say about the multiplayer.
3560458	3562478	He says, You'll have up to four players.
3562738	3569040	If they play together in split screen, we can only say that the fight will not only be on screen.
3569920	3575081	So that's maybe either referring to the fact that six people on the couch flailing about.
3575461	3578562	It's going to be very difficult to do in that kind of environment.
3578942	3584823	Or that there's going to be some sort of different type of multiplayer in room or something.
3585878	3593020	Games on Mario Party Wii are about to get very violent in this house because Mario Party, as it is, is a cutthroat competition around these parts.
3593420	3596161	Mario Party Wii is just begging for violence.
3596801	3598782	It's going to be sad.
3598822	3605604	Now that my mouse works again, I was reading some comments there in chat room and Blackboy commented, I need OSX on my PS3.
3606825	3610146	Kind of a shout out to an old operating system that some folks have forgot about.
3610406	3612186	Is that the same Blackboy I met at Arena once?
3612906	3614047	I wonder if it is.
3614427	3614727	Hi, buddy.
3616385	3616886	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3638348	3641230	So, I mean, that's not too much, not a big surprise.
3641611	3650798	Also, I think we talked about this last week, about how the Xbox 360 is possibly going to get a bundle with Project Gotham Racing 3, a 1,250 point card, and three month...
3656142	3657603	of Xbox Live Gold.
3657703	3659324	Well, it's sort of been confirmed.
3660045	3663547	It's starting to appear in retailers' computers now.
3664328	3668191	They have the PGR3 bundle in Toys R Us computer.
3668231	3679999	It's being sold for about the same price as a premium system and also was confirmed to be... Let's see, that was in a Canadian Toys R Us.
3681300	3684342	Apparently there's another chain called BJ's.
3685129	3690071	that's going to be carrying it in Circuit City's flyer in the newspaper.
3690191	3695313	They show the price for $489.99 US for the Project Gotham Racing 3 bundle.
3695734	3701516	It says it includes a pro console, a second wireless controller, play and charge kit, and a copy of PGR3.
3701556	3705177	But that sounds more like a bundle that's being done through that site.
3706038	3708339	And apparently online they have the same type of thing.
3709019	3712441	And there's like a $30 off web deal or something.
3712461	3712801	I don't know.
3713321	3713461	But
3714028	3715329	Something that may be coming soon?
3715470	3715790	Who knows?
3715970	3717171	We'll probably find out pretty soon.
3719474	3720875	I'm just reading in chat right now.
3721215	3727162	DJ Jinai said, I downloaded the Paris Hilton game and PKAcura88 goes, get out.
3727702	3731306	And PK, somebody said something and PKAcura88 says, no, I mean, get off my internet.
3734569	3734729	Aw.
3735530	3737172	Harsh folks in chat room.
3737857	3740239	Hey, I got a question for you because you were just talking about Project Gotham.
3740259	3746643	So speaking of racing games, somebody was sending me a private message, I think it was CKY Mike, asking about Burnout 5 on PS3.
3746703	3748104	Have you heard anything about Burnout?
3748324	3749625	No, it's probably coming out in the fall.
3750146	3751086	That would be my guess.
3751466	3752847	So it is coming for PlayStation 3?
3753448	3754529	I'm sure they're... Yes, it's a given.
3754569	3756450	Well, duh, they're coming out with another Burnout game.
3756490	3758811	I mean, it's going to be Burnout something.
3758932	3760673	It is coming out probably in the fall.
3761653	3762634	That's kind of a given.
3762694	3765196	It's just like saying, oh yeah, next year Madden 08's coming out.
3765776	3766757	I mean, come on, that's...
3767952	3769033	It's not a big surprise.
3769833	3775015	But my guess, if anything, it would be probably coming out in March-ish.
3775135	3777917	Because that's when the Xbox 360 one came out last year.
3778537	3784260	And obviously it's not coming out in September like it did last year for the current gen stuff.
3784280	3788362	So if I were to guess, I'd say March, probably for Burnout.
3789402	3790723	I know there's a lot of stuff.
3791023	3793424	September is going to be a packed month for games.
3793804	3795025	And October is even worse.
3796878	3800299	Final Fantasy XII crack, finally coming in October.
3801079	3802080	You won't see me for a week.
3802100	3804360	It's getting pushed more and more towards November.
3804420	3805320	God damn them.
3806061	3807901	Well, it's coming at Halloween.
3807921	3809681	How much further back can you push to November?
3810002	3810382	I don't know.
3811422	3817643	I swear to God, Squeenix, if you rob me of Final Fantasy for another year, I am... It's not going to be pretty.
3817943	3819504	You need to stomp and pout.
3819784	3823785	I will stomp and pout in front of the Squeenix building, and there will be video on YouTube.
3824065	3824225	Yep.
3824918	3829199	All it comes down to me is just Saints Row and fucking Dead Rising.
3829239	3831200	That's going to be my games for August.
3831600	3837142	And I don't know, there's a lot of games coming out in August, but a lot that I don't want, like Bomberman Act Zero.
3837322	3840243	I mean, it looks like Bomberman.
3841925	3843066	So that could be kind of fun.
3847189	3850251	I found out I gotta buy cars on the 360 for Nelly.
3850692	3854494	For achievement points?
3855055	3857116	No, but she wants that game.
3857196	3858717	What's up with Nelly getting into games lately?
3858917	3863080	You've talked about her playing Bejeweled, cloning Clyde, now she wants to play Cars.
3863301	3865302	She wants me to buy Elite Beat Agents for her.
3865382	3867043	Is she slowly becoming a gamer?
3867283	3867403	No.
3867504	3868905	Is this marriage thing corrupting her?
3868925	3869225	Maybe.
3869245	3869485	Maybe.
3870932	3872013	Do you think she'll be into the Wii?
3873173	3874214	Maybe.
3874354	3876776	I'm not going to say anything.
3877757	3878818	You shut your mouth.
3879238	3881340	You shut your mouth.
3881420	3884942	From my experience, she's very into the Wii.
3885383	3886323	I hate you all.
3887825	3889005	I want this show to end now.
3889065	3890907	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
3891227	3892768	Andrew, thanks so much for sitting in tonight.
3892788	3894970	Even though you were a little quiet, that's alright.
3894990	3895991	We appreciate your insight.
3897232	3898833	We appreciate you leaving the bad jokes at the door.
3899879	3900520	Oh, really?
3900620	3901720	Yeah.
3901760	3903181	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
3903741	3904102	Whee!
3906283	3906563	Thank you.
3906623	3907924	My eardrums are still ringing.
3909084	3910045	Loki, your final thought?
3910145	3911146	It's freaking hot in here.
3911426	3913067	I'm, like, sweating just sitting here.
3913087	3915468	Well, I'm trying to end the show so we can get out of here.
3915528	3917249	DarkSakura, your final thought?
3917409	3919751	Reject false icons and poo on the sun.
3920771	3927215	And my final thought is... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3928803	3930045	Have a great week, everybody.
3930065	3930866	We'll see you next time.
3947310	3948191	and Bobby.
3948211	3948912	Bring it, Bobby.
3948932	3950794	See, that's the only thing about Chromounds Online.
3951194	3957320	I wonder if they actually just have multiplayer, like standard multiplayer, not that online, perpetual online thing.
3957380	3960323	I gotta check that out, because I haven't really delved into the multiplayer that much.
3961504	3964908	That would be fun, though, an inter-show battle royale.
3965188	3966129	I'm all for that.
3966269	3971254	I'm all for an inter-show battle royale at some point on one of those games and stuff, and
3971650	3977012	We've talked about doing a tournament thingy using all game, but we'll save that for another show.
3977152	3978233	We want to end tonight's show.
3979013	3980013	So have a great night.
