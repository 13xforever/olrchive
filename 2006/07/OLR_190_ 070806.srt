00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Molochi

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tonight, Sony stirs up major controversy with a new billboard,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Nintendo gives President Bush a birthday present,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and does Microsoft have some secret Christmas plans?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,680
Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,520
This is episode number 190 for this July the 8th of 2006.

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,960
We're taping a day early this week.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,240
I've had all these screwed up travel plans these past couple weeks and it's kind of been

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,680
screwing up the taping schedule of the show.

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,500
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky and I'm here to talk about video games

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,940
with you guys and not here tonight is Dark Sakura. She's actually on assignment. She's

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,940
going to call us a little later in the show and tell us about where she's at and what

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,940
she's doing. However, say hello to the one and only Loki who is here tonight.

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,940
Yes, I am.

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,940
How you doing?

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,940
I'm doing good.

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,220
Good. Also with us tonight, we do have a special guest because it might get kind of boring

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,540
if it's just Loki and I. So we brought on our good buddy, Shane. How you doing?

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,540
I'm doing good.

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,540
Also known as Miklotov.

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,540
Yep.

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,900
And now Shane is actually, he's being hardcore tonight. He's actually playing a game during

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,900
the show.

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,900
multi-tasking. I'm hardcore every show. You usually play games too, don't you? Well, you

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,500
do them on break. I'll be doing the music break and then he'll come back. Sometimes

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,860
because you yell at me if I play them during the show. Well, because it gets distracting.

28
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,140
Even this is distracting. You just turn it down. I don't know how to work a Mac. He's

29
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,340
playing on my Mac. Poor portion. What are you playing? You're playing World of Warcraft,

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,540
right? I'm playing World of Warcraft. Fun. Alright, we're going to get into the show

31
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,580
real quick, but just first a couple of housekeeping announcements.

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,440
Of course, we are taping a day early this week.

33
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,920
We are live on Saturday, not Sunday, so if you'd like to join us, if you're listening

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,400

00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,900
chat room, orangelauntrader.com, click on chat.

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,180
We will be back to our regular taping schedules next week, so Sunday the 16th at 6 p.m. Pacific

37
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,180
Time.

38
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,220
We're taping live on our station, orangelauntrader.com, but of course, you can always catch up via

39
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,420
our podcast feed which is also at orangelountrader.com

40
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,260
also tonight it's only gonna be a one-part show there's not gonna be a

41
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,380
part B this week

42
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,140
but just like last week I mean it ended up being like at least an hour and a

43
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,780
half if not more so that's probably what tonight's show is gonna end up being a little

44
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,520
bit of too

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,700
so let's get it started we always like to start off with

46
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,020
what we've been playing this week. Loki, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?

47
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,460
I've been trying to finish Blazing Angels the entire game

48
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,540
and I have six out of seven achievements that's all that matters

49
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:50,540
I've already beaten the game, and I can tell you this much, the game SUCKS really bad.

50
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,820
Why do you keep playing?

51
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,200
I got it for free, and I want to finish the achievement points before I send it back to

52
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,300
its used game grave at GameStop.

53
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,980
But it's one of those games I did not buy, so I'm glad I didn't waste the money on it.

54
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,900
When I saw it, when it was coming out, I was like, oh hey, you know that looks pretty cool.

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,800
There's nothing like them, the 360, and no, I'll wait for the next one, because this one,

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,800
I don't know, it just wasn't that fun, it was kind of, all the missions are basically

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
the same, and some, like the missions are pretty similar difficulties, and then some

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,620
are just like way out there, like way too damn hard, and I don't get why they did that.

59
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,160
And then it goes like super easy afterwards, so whatever.

60
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,400
But I'm almost done, all I gotta do now is I have to play through these standard arcade

61
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,400
modes which you have to play with 32 different planes. I have to play it 32 times all the

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,400
way through and basically you take on like 4 different waves of planes and it's really

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,760
boring. But once I do that I'll have the last achievement. So that's all that matters. And

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,880
I don't know if the multiplayer online is any good but I know the multiplayer split

65
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,200
screen is kind of lame. So I don't know. It'll be worth checking out. I did also get to play

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,340
the ChromeHounds demo which is pretty awesome and unfortunately the mechs are pretty slow

67
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,720
in it so I did play a little bit more of that. Can't wait for the final game to come out

68
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,040
I think this week. And then Prey also played some of that. That game reminds me so much

69
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,420
of Duke Nukem 3D. It's just crazy. They actually have inside the arcade where you first start

70
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,300
off in the bar. There's an arcade game that's like Pac-Man and you can actually play the

71
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,460
arcade game in there, which is kinda neat. So, very interactive, just like Duke Nukem

72
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,460
3D, and kinda similar to Doom 3 in how dark and, you know, just kinda the way the game

73
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,700
is. But uh, should be good. Waiting for August though, when all the good games come out.

74
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,060
Like what are you looking forward to in August specifically?

75
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:59,000
Dead Rising, Saints Row, Enchanted Arms, um, those are pretty much the three I think that

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,900
I wanna pick up, yeah. Alright, very cool.

77
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,900
My gaming week I was in Canada most of the week on vacation

78
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,660
So I took a vacation from you know the internet and gaming a lot in general

79
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,980
But I did buy a new PSP game for the flight down there. I bought

80
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,580
Gradius collection on PSP

81
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,200
Which I got to play a little bit of when I was at Konami gamers day earlier this year

82
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,540
But I didn't get to do a whole lot in depth with it

83
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,340
So I'm glad I got to spend more time with it and really play most of the games and a lot of the Gradius games

84
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,340
I never really played

85
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,340
I had not really played Gradius Gaiden, which is included on there, and I really like that one.

86
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,340
That's actually probably my favorite Gradius in the collection,

87
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,340
and Gradius 4 I don't think I've ever played before.

88
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,340
I've played 5, I've played 3, I've played 2 on emulators because it was only out in Japan, I believe.

89
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,340
But now I've gotten a chance to play all the Gradius games, and it makes a good collection.

90
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,340
You know, they enhanced Gradius 1 and 2 a little bit so that it's widescreen.

91
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,440
screen. It's not perfectly the PSP's resolution, you can downsize it to the

92
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,580
regular resolution, but it works well on the widescreen. You don't feel like the

93
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,040
game stretched or anything like that. The game plays pretty smoothly. I would say

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,520
my favorite game out of the bunch is Gradius Gaiden, probably Gradius 3, my

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,720
least favorite, just because I don't like the way that game starts. I don't

96
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,480
like the first stage in it. The difficulty curve in that one

97
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,960
seems to be a lot higher than the other games, but it's a good game for

98
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,280
rekindling all your favorite Gradius memories, like, you know, oh it's the

99
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,400
Easter Island heads and all that stuff.

100
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,960
The only other thing that probably bothered me about the game was the price, it was $39.99

101
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
for the game.

102
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,500
And while it's a real great, you know, it's still a pretty good value, it's kind of surprising

103
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,560
that old games are demanding $40, but I guess it's just because you get so many of them

104
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,340
and they did rehash it.

105
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,240
It's a good buy, I would recommend it, especially if you're into shooters, because it's a good

106
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
no attention span shooter.

107
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,280
You know, you just pick it up, go, have fun with it.

108
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,160
I also like that you can save your progress anywhere, so you can just save and come back

109
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,460
later instead of having to start over every time like the old versions of Gradius.

110
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,540
The other disappointment is that I don't see Salamander unless it's an unlock.

111
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,860
I need to check Game Facts to see if maybe I just haven't unlocked it yet because I haven't

112
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,460
actually beat any of the Gradius games yet while I've had it because I keep having ADD,

113
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,140
I go back and forth to all the different games.

114
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,980
And I couldn't get the up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA code to work

115
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,400
mainly because there is no BA buttons on the PSP, but I press what I think would be BA,

116
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,760
it doesn't seem to work because when you pause the game it actually takes you

117
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,320
into a menu so I'm thinking that might be why it doesn't work so maybe I need

118
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,400
to read up on the cheats for that one because who didn't do the up up down

119
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,440
down at least once on the original Gradius on the NES come on give you all

120
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,920
the power-ups it was great but you remember the Super Nintendo one would

121
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,120
mess with you if you did that it would actually blow up your ship but if you

122
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,240
use the L and R buttons for left right left right that's how you did it that's

123
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,480
That's a real old fact, old data, I know.

124
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,680
We're here on the cutting edge, giving you the Super Nintendo game tips.

125
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800
Alright, that's about it, other than World of Warcraft and that stuff.

126
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,160
Shane, what have you been playing this week?

127
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
World of Warcraft.

128
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Is that it?

129
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,920
No, it's not it.

130
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,000
I've been playing fun things at work as normal.

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,080
Yeah, but you can't talk about those things.

132
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,360
No, but I had a good time with them this week.

133
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,040
So Konami's got some good stuff coming out?

134
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:22,080
Who knows, except for me and people that work there in Konami.

135
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,680
Then I also played some Awendon this week, because I love that game a lot.

136
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,400
And my computer at home broke, so I can't play WoW there, so to pass the time, I downloaded

137
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,160
Bejeweled 2 on Xbox Live Arcade, and that game, I always love Bejeweled, and I don't

138
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,720
I don't think it works too well on the 360, but it's got really good music, so it was

139
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,000
worth it.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,480
I think it's pretty.

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,700
I'll give it that.

142
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,700
The game?

143
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,520
Or the music?

144
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
The game.

145
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,040
It looks nice on HD and all that good stuff.

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,600
It looks nice, but it's not as easy to play because, you know, when you play it on computer

147
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,480
you have your mouse and you can go really quick to whatever little jewel you want to

148
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
swap.

149
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,720
But in this one you have to move up three times and left three times.

150
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,200
So I don't think it plays well, but the music's really good.

151
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,040
And I guess the only other thing I've done this week is at work we follow certain sites.

152
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,720
Can I say that site right there?

153
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
I don't know.

154
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Yeah, that's fine.

155
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Okay.

156
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,320
We follow the Game Facts Best Series Ever contest and we put money on it.

157
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,280
So I've been paying very close attention to that this week and I'm very upset by what's

158
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,740
going on today on the poll.

159
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,060
happening today right now?

160
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,500
Halo is losing to Castlevania, and I picked Halo to win over Castlevania.

161
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,280
They do those little, like, tournaments once in a while, like, I know they do the best

162
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
video game characters.

163
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,900
It's like $130 at work is on the line here.

164
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,460
Halo is like, what, two games, I wouldn't really call that a series, I mean, granted

165
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,860
there's a third game coming out, but that's not much of a series, where Castlevania...

166
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,060
Well, they're only two of the most popular games of all time.

167
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,460
Yeah, but how many systems has Castlevania been on, versus, you know, how many systems

168
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,460
has Halo been on?

169
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,620
Well yeah, I would vote Castlevania, personally, but that's just because...

170
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,760
Yeah, I would have too, but you have to think, okay, these people that come to the site,

171
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,080
what do they like more?

172
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,040
And I thought maybe they like Halo more.

173
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
I was wrong.

174
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,320
Apparently they like Fire Emblem more than Silent Hill, because they're idiots.

175
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
What?

176
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Fire Emblem more than Silent Hill?

177
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,280
Yeah, we had one person in our bedding pool that picked Fire Emblem, and the rest of us

178
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,300
picked Silent Hill, so we all got screwed over there too, and I'm gonna drop today now

179
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,220
because of Halo sucking so much.

180
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,220
doesn't suck, you're just bitter. Sadly, that doesn't surprise me, though, that Fire Emblem

181
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,300
beat Silent Hill.

182
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,220
Those to me, but whatever.

183
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,020
Interesting. Oh, I'm looking in our chat room over at orange-os-ready.com, click on chat,

184
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,700
and gk128, I guess, is in some sort of betting pool, too. He says, Halo's lost, fuck me,

185
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,220
too. I chose Halo to go three rounds.

186
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,820
Oh, that's terrible! Because you know what? Halo wouldn't have won over Kingdom Hearts,

187
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,340
which is the next 2-in. So, no, Halo couldn't make three rounds.

188
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,980
Which series did you pick to win at all?

189
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,300
I had the final two being Final Fantasy and Zelda, and I have Zelda winning.

190
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,420
I don't know, Final Fantasy, a lot of fanboys...

191
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,420
Last year?

192
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,620
Well see, I'm thinking to the betting last year where it was best character, and Link

193
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,300
won over all the Final Fantasy characters, so I'm hoping people aren't stupid.

194
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,980
Yeah, but a lot of Final Fantasy characters are forgettable.

195
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,980
I mean...

196
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:34,420
Well it was, I believe it was Link vs. Cloud, and come on Final Fantasy 7 person, everybody

197
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,420
loves Final Fantasy 7.

198
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,420
I know, Cloud, Aeris, Sephiroth.

199
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,460
I think it was Sephiroth vs. Cloud for a little bit.

200
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,380
Tidus and Yuna, I mean come on.

201
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,060
I was just trying to use my knowledge from last year because I didn't win last year,

202
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,060
I didn't even come close.

203
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,840
This year I'm doing better though at least.

204
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,540
Cecil from 4?

205
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
Who?

206
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,660
Locke the treasure hunter from 6?

207
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
I'm not a thief.

208
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,660
Alright, forget it.

209
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,660
I like that girl better.

210
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,780
Alright, so that was our gaming week.

211
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,460
I hope you guys had a good gaming week too, even though I don't think there was a whole

212
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,980
lot of new games this week, so you guys-

213
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
There was.

214
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,900
Lord of the Rings, Belle from Mary, the Lord of the Rings 2, and that about it.

215
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,180
I didn't really play it at number one though, so.

216
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,220
Well, this is more of like a PC straight- I don't know, it's not my cup of tea.

217
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,180
Didn't Pirates come out this week too?

218
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,740
It was supposed to come out last week and I think it got delayed to the fifth and yeah

219
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,740
it came out finally.

220
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Really?

221
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,740
Huh.

222
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
Legend of Jack Brown.

223
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
Not that anybody cares.

224
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
It was a decent game.

225
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,740
I mean for a movie.

226
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
Pirates of the Caribbean?

227
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
Yeah I saw it at E3, they gave us a little demo.

228
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,860
We had a, Bethesda actually like invited us to a thingy and we went to and uh.

229
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,260
It was better than the PSP game I can tell you.

230
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,540
I was more impressed with their Star Trek game they're making but uh you know the Pirates

231
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,540
game seemed pretty solid.

232
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,220
For a movie title, I mean you don't expect you're gonna get like a award winning game

233
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,220
out of some of those movie titles. Actually, some of the ones that are coming out, I think, are going to be pretty decent.

234
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,220
Like, Scarface? That looks almost

235
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,220
like they're beating Vice City at their own game. Really?

236
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,220
Well, Vice City ripped off from Scarface anyways, but this looks really damn

237
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,220
good. I mean, I don't know. I'm going to probably check it out

238
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,220
when it comes out in September. And of course, Reservoir Dogs.

239
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,220
That's got me interested now that they explain why it was banned in Australia.

240
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
No, uh, where's my Kill Bill game?

241
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,220
Why was it banned?

242
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,220
Where's your Y game?

243
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,860
Do you listen to this show?

244
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
Just out of curiosity?

245
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
Ever?

246
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
No.

247
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
Where's your Y game?

248
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,860
Kill Bill.

249
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,860
Kill Bill?

250
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
Yeah.

251
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,860
Um...

252
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
Red Steel.

253
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,860
Red Steel's probably close enough.

254
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,740
Turn off all the color on your TV and then play like, um, some really gory game and there

255
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
you go, there's your Kill Bill game.

256
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,020
Uh, Misty in our chatroom says, who needs new games?

257
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,660
I've been playing the hell out of Emerald and Tetris World's on GBA.

258
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:53,660
JeremyTod1 wants to know if Battle for Middle Earth 2 is any good. He's thinking about getting it for PC. How's the first one and like that?

259
00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:01,660
Well, it got pretty decent reviews. Like I said though, it doesn't really look that... I used to love RTS games.

260
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:11,660
Especially Command & Conquer series. But I think I liked it mainly because I could use... I could cheat and make my own characters almost.

261
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,940
almost. And I think that was more fun to me than actually playing through the game. But

262
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,860
I do like, I love the online from like Red Alert. That was my favorite game. I, you know,

263
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,840
back in the day when you'd have to call somebody over the phone, you know, to actually establish

264
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,660
a direct connection with them, you know, not this over the internet crap, you know, over

265
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,660
the modem. Back in my day. And, you know, that was really fun. It was really fun to

266
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,980
play that game. But, you know, nowadays, I don't know, Battle for the Miller 2, I'm not

267
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,300
really that big of a Lord of Rings fan and so I don't know, maybe a rental?

268
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Bandit sent me a private message in chat saying he had a great gaming week, his local arcade

269
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,500
just got DDR Supernova and his legs are killing him, it's definitely worth it.

270
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,900
I guess DDR Supernova is starting to get into arcades there and of course I know a large

271
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,220
part of our fanbase has followed us from the Bomani days when we talked a lot about those

272
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,500
type of games and of course I'm definitely looking forward to checking out the final

273
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,420
build of Dance Dance Revolution Supernova.

274
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,540
We just got them in the bay at the Golf Lands but of course we've had it at Konami forever

275
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:16,420
And I'm curious to hear what people think of the timing, because I haven't played it

276
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:23,280
enough to really figure out if it's bad or not, but I'm hearing reports that it's pretty

277
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,860
dang terrible, so if anybody has played it, like that one guy whoever you just said, I

278
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,300
would be interested in hearing what he has to say.

279
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,420
Alright, well let's get into some gaming news and we'll come back to chatroom comments a

280
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
little later.

281
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:45,380
I did want to point out real fast, I did look up Gradius on game facts and I don't see anything

282
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,940
about there being the hidden game.

283
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:55,380
So that kind of disappoints me that they don't have Salamander locked away in it.

284
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,420
That makes me kind of sad.

285
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,620
Anyway let's get into some news.

286
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,680
This made a lot of people sad this week.

287
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,220
Certainly was a polarizing topic in the gaming community.

288
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,620
You might have heard Sony actually put out an ad for their ceramic white PSP.

289
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,460
Now the ad actually only ran on billboards in the Netherlands, but of course thanks to

290
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,420
the internet the image has circulated worldwide.

291
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,020
And if you haven't seen the image yet, go to just about any major gaming site.

292
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
You can see a picture of this.

293
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:30,520
It's basically a white woman with white hair wearing a white outfit kind of grabbing this

294
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,220
black woman with black hair and a black outfit kind of grabbing her by the cheek or something

295
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
like that.

296
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,600
It looks like she's got this very menacing threatening look on her face and it just says

297
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,180
PlayStation Portable White is coming.

298
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:49,020
And of course people are mad because this is a racist image and why are they doing this

299
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,020
and even politicians over here are starting to get into the whole thing.

300
00:16:53,020 --> 00:17:00,460
Let's see the Sony spokesperson responded to this speaking to the website gamesindustry.biz.

301
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,440
The marketing campaign for the launch of the white PSP focuses on the contrast between

302
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,420
the black PSP model and the new ceramic white PSP model.

303
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,920
A variety of different treatments have been created as a campaign to either highlight

304
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,900
the whiteness of the new model or contrast the black and white models.

305
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,980
Central to this campaign has been the creation of some stunningly photographed imagery that

306
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,940
has been used on large billboards throughout Holland.

307
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,100
All of the 100 or so images created for the campaign have been designed to show this contrast

308
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,900
and colors of the PSPs and have no other messages or purpose."

309
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,020
Hmm, what do you guys think of this?

310
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,740
I think people are stupid for reacting about it.

311
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,740
Really?

312
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,740
Yeah, really.

313
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,740
I think it's retarded.

314
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,580
And in fact, some of the other pictures that they showed weren't that bad.

315
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,060
I mean, they showed, like, you know, cut in half and basically one's white, one's black

316
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,060
not necessarily showing the women, you know, poking each other or whatever.

317
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,580
But it's a fucking ad in another country, and the thing that pisses me off the most

318
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,700
is when politicians over here going, I don't want to see that in my neighborhood. Well

319
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,460
your neighborhood isn't all the way over in fucking, you know, what, Denmark is where

320
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,700
it was? I mean, it's stupid that, especially Congressman Yee. That guy's a dumbass and

321
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,780
needs to shut up. Why? Because he's making a political statement about something that's

322
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,860
in another country. They'll do what they fucking want. They have nudity on television over

323
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,540
in the UK. You don't see them going, oh my God, oh my God, two people of different color.

324
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,100
I have never seen that in my entire life, and oh my god, it's so racist.

325
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,580
To be a devil's advocate here for a minute, though, Sony, I mean, just, you know, I'm

326
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,420
not really sure how I feel about this, I don't, I think the image is a little odd, and it

327
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,080
doesn't exactly make me excited about the, you know, I kind of go, well that's certainly

328
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,700
going to get attention, which I guess an advertising campaign is supposed to do, but it's kind

329
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,980
of one of those, you know, I wouldn't put an image like that out advertising Orange

330
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:58,220
launch radio that's for sure worst thing about that images what that Europe's

331
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,580
getting the white PSP and we're not that made me angry that's the only thing that

332
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:07,540
well okay my point though is that Sony is a worldwide company though and they

333
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,820
do release products here in the United States and granted you know when they're

334
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,420
gonna do something like this thanks to the internet you know this image has

335
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,460
made it worldwide it's gonna show up in magazines here you know and think not

336
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,980
not as an ad but just the buzz about it and Sony being a worldwide company who

337
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,420
who does put out products here, you know.

338
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,880
Wow, yeah, it's such a wonderful advertising campaign.

339
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,140
Like the last one with the really annoying,

340
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,960
sketchy squirrels and dust balls that talked about the PSP.

341
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,500
Oh yeah, it made me wanna really go out and buy a PSP.

342
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,700
Just like this one, this does not make me wanna go out

343
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,060
and buy a PSP.

344
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,420
They really need to cut off the cancerous PR department

345
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,860
of Sony, that's what the really, the problem stems from.

346
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,340
It's just, people that get to do the advertising

347
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,420
are retarded.

348
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,940
I think this advertisement's actually OK.

349
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,420
It really doesn't bother me.

350
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,860
And like a couple of my co-workers,

351
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,500
when we saw that ad, the first time

352
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,420
we just kind of looked at it not very intensely,

353
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,780
I didn't even see the black woman there, actually.

354
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,260
I was like, oh, a white chick advertising the PSP.

355
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,180
What's racist about that?

356
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,180
Oh, there's somebody else in there.

357
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,020
Well, there's another ad, that one

358
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,420
that they showed, which they said

359
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,940
there was 100 different images that they have.

360
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,180
One of them has a black chick basically kind of doing

361
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,900
same thing to the white chick but just kind of like hold her down like they're

362
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,780
gonna fight

363
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,140
that's all it really kind of comes out to so very interesting and i notice in

364
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,500
our chat room we have grin without a cat says there's other images with the black

365
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,900
woman is the dominant one so is this a case of the media's just selectively

366
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,460
exactly out of their images oh i see it and there's some that aren't like not

367
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,100
even really that bad i mean so i don't understand interesting

368
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,300
if you think the media just latched onto this one image and now it's become this big

369
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,020
misunderstanding because they hassled newsweek and they really need something

370
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,260
to talk about

371
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,720
interesting perspective

372
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,520
uh...

373
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,220
going to the chat room funny dale says thank god sony never released the psp in

374
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,520
yellow

375
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,480
away

376
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,240
i want to say stuff alright anyway that i won't all right so anyway

377
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,400
uh... some striking imagery they're definitely uh...

378
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,240
provoking reaction which i guess an ad campaign supposed to do but is it

379
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
ethical that's the question

380
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,000
so uh... definitely looking for your feedback we definitely want to get your

381
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,240
feedback on this issue

382
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,120
and we'll tell you a little more information on how you can do that a little later in the

383
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
program.

384
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,040
It wouldn't be the first time that their advertising campaigns have bombed or even

385
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,280
the people that do their advertising for them.

386
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:34,080
For example, there's been an Apple logo that's been spotted on the official Playstation

387
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,040
3 website and people are going, what the hell is this?

388
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,880
Why is there an Apple logo on there?

389
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,920
Well, come to find out after people have disassembled the Flash file that was there, they found

390
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:52,040
out that Sony had blatantly ripped off something that was on, I guess, Apple's site for the

391
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,800
Apple iPod. And it actually had the logo with the smoke coming down and apparently either

392
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,560
what the thought is that the people that are doing the advertising or the website for Sony

393
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,520
for PlayStation 3 are the same ones that did the website for the Apple iPod and that they

394
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,120
just kind of reuse their resources that they had for this.

395
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,000
Well, that of course has been fixed and still no official word from Sony about what their

396
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
PR firm did.

397
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,280
But it's still kind of funny seeing an Apple logo on there.

398
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
And you know, I don't know.

399
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,800
Another speculation was that they were using some Apple software, a product called Apple

400
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:38,640
shake to create the file, and they were using a beta, not beta, but a demo version that

401
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,620
wasn't allowed, you know, so it kept a watermark on there.

402
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,380
That to me is incredibly funny, like, yeah, I'd read that theory too that they were using

403
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,020
the trial software, that's funny.

404
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,300
Because Sony never steals from anybody, ever.

405
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,700
Okay, look, though, come on, I mean...

406
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,420
It's their PR firm, I know it has nothing to do with Sony.

407
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,380
No, no, I know it's easy to pick on Sony in this day and age after E3, but come on, I

408
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,220
who you either have apples or pcs at your you know place of employment even sony probably

409
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:10,780
but this is a computer thing is though is it's actually from you know it's it's from

410
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:16,560
like an actual flash file from looks like the ipod site in fact they've disassembled

411
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,740
it taking that part out of the background which is like the smoke effect looks like

412
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,880
smoke dropping from the ceiling kind of rolling along the ground stuff and they've taken out

413
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,400
and just that one section they've isolated and it's clearly stolen from something

414
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,320
Well maybe that's just a stock effect in the program

415
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,800
no it's something clearly stolen from something else and interesting so

416
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,200
somebody is in trouble but it's just kind of sloppy

417
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,960
whatever it is funny though people are speculating oh my god what if the

418
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,240
adults and apples with no not gonna happen uh somebody in our

419
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,400
chat room uh tiger claw reminded me of something i

420
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,120
I was supposed to mention earlier during the last story about the ad is that control-alt-delete the comic ran a pretty funny

421
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
response to the ad that had a

422
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,880
Skinny white guy and a fat white guy and it was an ad for the DS lite get it

423
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:10,800
So I thought that was pretty funny. That's creative marketing. Oh, well, that's just it was real. It's a creative response and

424
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
a very interesting comic

425
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,400
And you should get something like a DS on an operating table with like a liposuction

426
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,780
Tube and then like that would be a good advertising campaign or like a picture of you know

427
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,880
Oprah when she was big and Oprah when she was skinnier and I don't ever do this last weight like, you know

428
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,540
Who a Roseanne had the surgery wouldn't we want to see someone that's nice-looking though?

429
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,680
Or what they should have is they should have some guy dressed up in like bondage gear

430
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,900
Bent over and have the giant PSP with like legs and arms

431
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,120
You know rated screw them in the ass and just you know ps3. It's coming for you

432
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,700
I don't know the PS goat see it sounds like what you're trying to sell over there. That's disgusting you make me sad ah

433
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,060
speaking of Sony and kicking them while they're down it almost seems like

434
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,080
It looks like Sony has been ordered to pay

435
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,700
243 million dollars in back taxes to the Japanese government these taxes are related to

436
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,140
transactions between the games division and the US subsidiary of the company as well as

437
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,660
overseas transactions relating to CD and DVD making.

438
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,840
Sony had a comment on this.

439
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,860
Sony and SCEI believe that their allocation of income for the periods in question was

440
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:25,380
appropriate and they have paid the proper amount of taxes in each of the jurisdictions.

441
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,440
Man, these guys just aren't getting a break this year.

442
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,660
The bad news keeps on coming.

443
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,420
It's like beating a dead hooker over and over and over again.

444
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
And that's new.

445
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
Which you could do in one of their games.

446
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,020
Exactly, but it's also on the Xbox to be fair.

447
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,580
But anyways, that's not really the bad part about it, but analysts are saying that the

448
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:51,260
PS3 could be third in the next gen console race and mainly the basis of this is that

449
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:58,580
their brand strength is not enough to get people to spend the $600 on their system.

450
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:05,060
And it's not like where you had the PlayStation 2 come out at a better time and for a lot

451
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:11,900
less you know where's that kind of fuel the whole DVD you know launch now what

452
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,740
nowadays it's like you know do you really need blu-ray I mean I don't know

453
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,620
I don't he believes we do Sony would like you to think that you need only

454
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,340
already thinks we need you and here's the thing though I mean my thought on it

455
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:29,860
is blu-ray I don't need it and I don't need HD DVD either so I mean not really

456
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,860
a fault in Sony for you know bringing on the blu-ray because you can use that for

457
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,740
games and stuff, that's fine to have their own proprietary format for the games, so even

458
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,160
if it doesn't work as a DVD, you know, video system or whatever, it'll still work for their

459
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
games.

460
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,620
Well, the same goes with HD DVD, I don't think I need that either, so.

461
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,140
Yeah, I don't mind, I would benefit from an HD DVD player or even Blu-Ray, but when the

462
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,140
price is right, and that's my issue.

463
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,740
My issue with Sony right now is that, you know, like the name for Nintendo's new system,

464
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:05,360
I've gotten almost over the fact that the only model worth getting is the $600 one.

465
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,420
They just haven't shown anything that's going to be out anytime soon that looks even remotely

466
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,420
interesting.

467
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,380
I just look at the launch list and I'm like, so what?

468
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,860
And in fact, there was like a game like, for example, I was like, ooh, Full Auto 2, ooh,

469
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,060
I got a, you know, that's a really good, you know, I love Full Auto, you know, almost,

470
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,580
you know, maybe I should get the system for that.

471
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,660
Oh wait, Full Auto 2 is coming out for the Xbox 360 later on.

472
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,100
Okay, well I don't need to get the system.

473
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,760
You know, what do they have that's exclusive?

474
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Motorstorm?

475
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Meh.

476
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Lame.

477
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,900
Maybe they'll have Fantavision 2 and then I'll actually have a review of it.

478
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,700
Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy 13.

479
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Are they going to be launched?

480
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,580
No, but they're great.

481
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,900
I'm just saying you will have to get a PS3 eventually if you want to play this game.

482
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,900
When it goes down in price.

483
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,900
You hope.

484
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,380
Xbox 360's been out a year and hasn't gone out and down in price.

485
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,780
You know, I don't think that it's going to drop in price anytime soon, and you know,

486
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,980
until there's some better games out there, I'm not buying one.

487
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,980
But you know what?

488
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,580
I mean, they could totally pull it out and say, you know, they could have some big secret

489
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,660
stuff that they're not talking about and that would be, you know, really amazing.

490
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,620
Well it ain't the Eye of Judgment.

491
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,620
That is the worst idea.

492
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,620
I don't...

493
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,620
It was that card game, right?

494
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,620
It's not...

495
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,620
Yeah, it's the card game.

496
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,620
Here's the thing about the Eye of Judgment.

497
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,180
I don't know how the hell they're going to execute this because, to be honest, the eye

498
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:23,980
toy sucks for, you know, that type of gameplay and the way that they're set up and they have

499
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:29,080
this like really elaborate like frame that this camera was in I don't see how

500
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,520
it's gonna be possible to do this even reasonably why you would want to do this

501
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,840
in the first place it just it was a great idea like as it like a proof of

502
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,400
concept thing but as a game I don't see it happening I don't I don't get how

503
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,340
they're gonna do it a chat room wanted to correct me on something Xbox 360 is

504
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,520
actually only been out nine months not a year but the price okay well the price

505
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,960
isn't gonna drop by November either so we don't I mean as far as we know it's

506
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:00,960
The only reason it would have had to is if PS3 announced it was coming out for $4.99

507
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,800
or $3.99, whatever the Xbox 360 is.

508
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,640
I don't think they're not going to drop the price of the 360.

509
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:14,320
If anything, they may drop it later, like once the first quarter comes around next year,

510
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,360
but they might drop the price of the Xbox.

511
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,240
Banda makes an interesting comment in her chat room.

512
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,240
I want a PS3 for the games too, but Sony doesn't want to make a console just for games.

513
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,680
If it weren't for that damn Blu-ray crap, I like, um, the PS3 is gonna be sold more

514
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,800
as your living room centerpiece, you know, it's your movie, game, internet, picture,

515
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
I don't know, system.

516
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,720
Do you think that's gonna win Sony any points from people, or?

517
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
No.

518
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
Not at all.

519
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Wow.

520
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Okay.

521
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,160
Well, here's the thing, I mean, look, I have a PSP as well, and what do I use it for?

522
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,480
I use it for games.

523
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,300
I don't... I don't have any pictures on it. I don't have any

524
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,760
movies on it. Okay, but I've heard from listeners who download our show on

525
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,520
their PSP. We have the PSP websites which are pretty kick-butt, so

526
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,920
some people out there are getting used to some of the other functions of the PSP.

527
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,440
I like the web stuff on the PSP. You know what's funny too about the whole PS3 thing?

528
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,160
It's still floating around out there that they're saying that

529
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,200
you know it's possible that Sony may do that

530
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,080
you know thing to eliminate used game sales. You know, where they're gonna make a picture.

531
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
I don't buy it.

532
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,280
Well, they're trying to push really for digital distribution and I really think they're trying

533
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,820
it out with this PSP emulation thing and if it works well for that, they're going to move

534
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,820
it to the...

535
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,920
I bet you actually that's probably going to be on the PS3 when that comes out.

536
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,680
All right, let's keep it moving here.

537
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,080
I want to talk about this on the PSP.

538
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,200
I think it's actually a pretty cool idea here.

539
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,320
This was a story that ran on Kotaku, a graduate student, Jonas Heilscher, put together this

540
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,000
interesting piece that he put on YouTube that is this game where you go around

541
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,620
and you're looking for access points and as you collect the access points you get

542
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,780
a distinct color shape or sound based based on whatever that MAC address is of

543
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,740
the point that you find and what you do is you fill this three by three grid

544
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,720
with shapes trying to get three in a row as you find the points now if you ever

545
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,220
get an unsecure access point though it might wipe the grid clean or act as a

546
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,820
wild card. So basically the game encourages you to

547
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,380
get out and walk, which I think is a neat idea.

548
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,660
But that's kind of a cool concept for a game. I mean it's just

549
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,380
it's nothing that I don't think would ever be sold, but you know, it's a cute tech demo

550
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:26,940
idea.

551
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,300
Well, that reminds me of like when they were going to release a GPS thing.

552
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,220
Yeah, geocaching. It made me think of that too. That would be a great idea for the PSP. I think that would be a

553
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,060
lot of fun.

554
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,300
Like, can you imagine like, okay, this might sound really cheesy, but like take like one of

555
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,740
those TV shows like Treasure Hunters The Game

556
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,060
or something that could rely on geocaching, not that you would really

557
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,360
travel around the world for real, but maybe something that interacts with the

558
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,900
geocache to kind of

559
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,140
encourage people to go outside and use their PSPs and kind of

560
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,100
interact in a whole different way.

561
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,960
I think that would be a neat idea. But the screen sucks outside,

562
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,060
I think. Yeah, that's a good point. The LCD screens really do suck. Can't you get

563
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,540
something, though, that kind of helps that? An umbrella?

564
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:11,220
Well, if you design the lighting and everything correctly, it might

565
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:17,220
work okay. It does require firmware 2.0 to play, and they do plan on putting it on their

566
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,460
site in the near future. It's pixel6.org, so check it out. The name of the game is Colectic.

567
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,740
So that's actually pretty cool. And, you know, kind of, you know, back to what we were talking

568
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:36,340
about before, both Sega and Ubisoft want the PSP, or not the PSP, the PS3 to drop in price.

569
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:43,500
They're basically saying that it's too expensive and they're worried that because it is so

570
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,760
expensive that it might not be competitive enough with the Xbox 360 and not as many units

571
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
may sell.

572
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,960
And of course that affects them, especially when they're releasing games on those consoles

573
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:01,360
because they're unable to make as many or sell as many on that system.

574
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,480
I think that's a shared sentiment from everybody that they want the price to drop.

575
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,520
um, crazy Sony guy, I forget his name, Kaz Harai or whatever, didn't he say that he's

576
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,040
not even guaranteeing that the price of games would be $59.99 or whatever?

577
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,300
Yeah, yeah, he's saying it could be more.

578
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,600
It could be, but uh, you know, that's not a good way to sell your console.

579
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Let them worry about that later.

580
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,480
It's not a console, it's a media center.

581
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,600
Oh, I'm sorry, but um, yeah, so, interesting.

582
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,380
Alright, let's switch consoles for a minute here.

583
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,360
Let's go over and talk about the Nintendo Wii.

584
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,260
This shouldn't be a surprise to anybody.

585
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,160
A lot of people like to joke about the power brick that comes with the Xbox 360, because

586
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
that thing is huge.

587
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,640
Well, pictures have leaked of the Wii's power supply, and it's not so big.

588
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,280
But it's about the size of the GameCube power supply.

589
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,800
But honestly, is this a huge surprise, considering that the Wii is not going to be running on

590
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,160
nearly the same type of hardware as the Xbox 360?

591
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,400
I wouldn't be surprised if it was running on the same power supply as the GameCube.

592
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Mmm, interesting thought.

593
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Except it's you know, it's a different color because you know, they didn't have white but it's just like, you know, it's just like the

594
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:16,220
Was it the PlayStation 2 how you can use all the audio cables and video cables with?

595
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,140
The PlayStation 1 hell those Nintendo cables you can use

596
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:26,400
I think it's the same cables for Super Nintendo all the way through GameCube. You can use that same AV thing. Yeah

597
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,960
Yeah, that's pretty cool. That's the way to do it. I think

598
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,600
Well, I mean, it's just an AV cable

599
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,240
I mean that that kind of technology doesn't change

600
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,460
But what is interesting is even though we know that the Wii is not going to support high def

601
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,920
720 or whatever, maybe they'll still release you know

602
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,280
Red green blue

603
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,360
Progressive. Yeah. Well, what it component. Thank you component. Maybe they'll still release component cables

604
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,620
This isn't gamecube for a little while have component cables

605
00:34:54,620 --> 00:35:00,520
Well, they're just really hard to come by even on the Xbox remember the Xbox some of the games were actually 720p very few

606
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:07,400
Very few, but still, I mean, I would like to see, you know, sure their focus is not

607
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,980
going to be high def, but if someone wants to do a high def game, to maybe allow some

608
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,120
way to do that.

609
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,520
I think that would be kind of cool.

610
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
I don't know.

611
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,720
Because I remember some of the games for the GameCube were progressive scan as well, so.

612
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,640
Very, yeah, well, you had a few that were widescreen at least, like F-Zero is pretty

613
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
kick ass.

614
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,960
Yeah, so I don't know, I think...

615
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,160
But it's not, because I don't have component cables for the GameCube, because they're so

616
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,080
freaking hard to find, I still don't have them.

617
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,400
I have a digital out on the GameCube, but I just don't have those cables.

618
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:46,800
You know, F-Zero just doesn't look as good as, you know, even an Xbox game that did have

619
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,920
the component cables, so, I don't know.

620
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,320
Alright, speaking of Nintendo, there was announcements made about their brand new line of games that's

621
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,400
going to be coming out. Kind of like the Touch Generations whereas those were not really

622
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,480
games per say but more of kind of for everybody type stuff. You know where Nintendogs and

623
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,320
Brain Training etc. Well now they have a brand new lineup called Bit Generations and these

624
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:20,840
actually look pretty sweet. Included in that are going to be puzzle and rhythm games designed

625
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:30,180
for the Game Boy Advance, including Dotstream, Boldish, Dialex, Digidrive, Orbital, Coloris,

626
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,180
and Sound Voyager.

627
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,760
And they're all really simple looking games, but they all look really cool actually and

628
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,020
pretty fun to play.

629
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:44,920
And they're going to be for about $25 an American and will ship in the second and fourth weeks

630
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,220
in July in Japan.

631
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,500
Some other new games are coming out for the DS, not just the DS but the PSP, and they're

632
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,280
coming from one of my favorite developers, Q Entertainment.

633
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,180
You know I love Luminous and Meteos, those are two of my favorite games that came out

634
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,180
last year.

635
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,040
Well, there are new games coming out, and I'm not talking about Luminous 2 or every

636
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,580
Xtend Xtra, I'm talking about some other stuff.

637
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,100
Famitsu Magazine is reporting that Bandai Namco is going to be publishing two new Q

638
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,100
Entertainment games.

639
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:15,340
One is going to be out for the PSP, and it's called Gun PR, it's short for Gun P Reverse,

640
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:20,980
The DS is going to get a game that translates to the name Connect the Sounds Gunpee Reverse.

641
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:27,420
Both are music-based puzzle games and they're based on a 1999 WonderSwan game called Gunpee.

642
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,960
Too bad Jamie's not here because she'd probably actually know that one because I never owned

643
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
a WonderSwan but she did.

644
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,520
I do have a WonderSwan thanks to a gracious listener but I have one game for it.

645
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,060
I don't really play a lot of WonderSwan games.

646
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,200
Maybe I should check this one out though.

647
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,900
for those that haven't played it, it's got square pieces and they all have a diagonal

648
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,280
line and it rises from the bottom of the screen to the top.

649
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,440
You move the pieces up and down, trying to get a line going from left to right.

650
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,980
The panels will then disappear if you do this.

651
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,860
The game ends early if the pieces get to the top of the field.

652
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:06,060
On the PSP version, there will be emphasis on music and video, kind of like Luminous,

653
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:11,340
it had skins but on the DS it's going to be more you know stylus emphasized and

654
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,580
as a little as opposed to having the skins however the game will still make

655
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,260
sounds when you clear panel and it'll try to line up the sounds of the

656
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,460
background music so that should be interesting it sounds a lot like that

657
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:29,860
game it's a pop cap game it's the fireworks with the it's like a festival

658
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,340
game with the fireworks I can't remember the name of it now I'm sure someone

659
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,060
No idea. I'm sure someone in chat has it. It's a little different though. You turn these,

660
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,180
but you're trying to line things up from left to right, and when you do that these fireworks

661
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:46,060
go off and you get points. Well that might be a cheesy game. It might be a cool game for

662
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:55,420
our latest Nintendo DS owner here. President Bush was actually given a Nintendo DS and brain training

663
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:01,820
for his 60th birthday. I wonder what Nintendo's trying to tell him. That he's stupid. And they

664
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:08,720
attached the letter to it and says don't worry turning 60 is an exciting milestone as you know you've joined the millions of

665
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,340
other baby boomers in an

666
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,720
Invigorating new decade of your life and like many boomers you may be looking for ways to keep your mind sharp

667
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
That's where we come in

668
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,020
Please accept our gift of a new Nintendo DS light and a copy of brain age train your brain in minutes a day

669
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,320
And what do you think actually ended up happening to that?

670
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,440
that. Threw it away. It probably went to somebody else. Well maybe he gave it to one of his

671
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,560
daughters or something. I don't know. You'd think maybe he'd try it once. He might. He's

672
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,360
you know a normal guy despite you know the fact I disagree with the politics or whatever

673
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,200
he seems to be a normal guy. Well he has a lot of time on. Maybe he'll check it out.

674
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,520
Something to do on Air Force One I don't know. Alright who knows. It's actually a super secret

675
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,720
spy device to find out what's going on. Jeremy Todd One in our chat room seems to think President

676
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,560
Bush probably won't even be able to turn the damn DS Lite on.

677
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,920
Hahaha, that's true.

678
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
You guys are harsh.

679
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,720
I don't get these fangled computer things, heh heh heh.

680
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,440
Alright, now if you are craving for some new games, we have some release dates for you,

681
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,000
and I'm gonna start it off, I know Jamie's not here tonight, but I don't want to neglect

682
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,640
the UK audience, because we have some awesome UK listeners.

683
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,000
You know, I think next year, I know I keep saying I want to go to Australia, but I'm

684
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
torn.

685
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,120
I either want to go to Australia or I want to go to the UK, one of the two.

686
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,520
So I'll probably do one next year and then one the year after that, and that's assuming

687
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,600
I'm rich.

688
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
So we'll see.

689
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,560
Anyway, here's some release dates here for the UK.

690
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,560
You guys have coming out on the 14th, you have Cars coming out on some various platforms,

691
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,600
everything from GameCube, PS2, and Xbox, all the way to PC and portable platforms as well.

692
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,800
Also coming out, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Legend of Jack Sparrow on PC and PlayStation

693
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
2.

694
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,680
And of course, again, a lot of people are looking forward to Prey coming out on the

695
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,680
the PC and the Xbox 360 from 2K Games.

696
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,480
If you like Dragon Ball, you have Super Dragon Ball Z coming out on the PlayStation 2 from

697
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,520
Atari, and The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle Earth 2 is coming out on the Xbox

698
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
360.

699
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,360
Looking ahead a little bit to the week of the 21st, you guys are getting in the UK Def

700
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:14,520
Jam Fight for New York, the takeover on the PSP, Infected on the PSP, and Field Commander

701
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,480
on the PSP from Ubisoft.

702
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,840
Also coming out for the PlayStation 2, World Super Police.

703
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,640
week next week in the UK for Sony.

704
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,040
Yeah, lots of stuff for the US too, especially if you have a 360.

705
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,800
You're going to be getting Prey, of course, awesome game.

706
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:36,500
ChromeHounds, also on the 360, and then finally, if you don't have a 360, they have Sprint

707
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,280
Cars or the Knoxville, which is, I don't know, a game you probably won't want to pick up.

708
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,080
Of course, the following week, you've got, you know, lots of stuff, NCA Football 2007,

709
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,900
Of course on Playstation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360 and PSP, if you're a football fan.

710
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:58,940
Monster House, you know, that coincided with the movie release on Playstation 2 and GameCube.

711
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,520
Super Dragon Ball Z on the Playstation 2.

712
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,440
Let's see, Painkiller on the Xbox.

713
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,200
And of course, what was it, Xenide on the Xbox.

714
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,000
And it's kind of a cool little shooter game, kind of reminds me of, I don't know, just

715
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,600
It's kind of one of the Japanese shooter games, kind of like Raiden 3 or something.

716
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,180
So lots of cool stuff.

717
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:30,680
But anyways, beyond all that, we're going to be getting some new stuff, including brand

718
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,360
new Xbox 360 face plates.

719
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
It's about time.

720
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,540
You heard it here first guys.

721
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:44,520
This came straight through my work, because Microsoft is wanting to know how many we need.

722
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:51,280
The brand new faceplates, I'm going to be starting off with Forza 2, a faceplate designed

723
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,680
specifically for that game, Halo 3, or at least a Halo faceplate is going to be coming

724
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,400
out here, as well as...

725
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,160
In other words, it's just Halo graphics with a number 3 on it.

726
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,920
It doesn't actually say Halo 3 or have the graphics on it, but...

727
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,960
It seems a little early for a Halo 3, but when you consider that Halo 2 is still, you

728
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,280
look at major nelson rankings it's still the number one xbox live game i mean obviously

729
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,080
there's going to be demand for a halo type faceplate exactly and it it's pretty cool

730
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,160
looking and then finally i don't know if you can be excited about this but um these are

731
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,560
pinata boy they're really whoring that franchise they really want that to work don't they hate

732
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,600
that franchise it's kind of like the snakes on the plane thing for me um also there was

733
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,680
a new Wii game announced and I don't know if you're going to be excited by this because

734
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,420
I played the Playstation 2 version of it and I didn't like it too much, but Rampage World

735
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,600
Tour or Total Destruction I mean is going to be...

736
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Where'd you hear that?

737
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,600
Is that another thing?

738
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
It's through my work, yeah.

739
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,560
That seems like an odd release, you're right.

740
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,560
That game seems a little dated.

741
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,620
Rampage Total Destruction is going to be coming out on the Wii.

742
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,620
It's going to be $29.99.

743
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,120
Are they going to announce it at all you think?

744
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,120
Probably not.

745
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,120
Not for $29.99.

746
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:09,260
It's supposed to be out in December and I don't know it I

747
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Didn't like the PlayStation 2 game. I thought that it was very unbalanced and just not very fun to play

748
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,420
But hey, you know what? It's just another game for us. So expect that out in December. All right, any other release date news?

749
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:29,240
I think that's all I got. That's brand new. But yeah, lots of ps3 games coming. That's for sure. Oh

750
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,520
Oh, it looks like we're getting a call on the Skypline.

751
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,480
Let's go to the Skypline and see who's there.

752
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Hello?

753
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,480
Hello.

754
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
Hey, Jamie.

755
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,480
Is that you?

756
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,480
Yeah.

757
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Where are you at?

758
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
San Jose.

759
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
San Jose.

760
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,480
What's going on in San Jose today?

761
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
California Extreme.

762
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,720
It's a big coin-op and pinball convention thing.

763
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,720
I see.

764
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,440
Pinball's there, so that's why you're there, huh?

765
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,440
Yeah.

766
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,400
The husband kidnapped me, but I figured it's good stuff for Orange Lounge.

767
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,400
Yeah.

768
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,400
What's going on down there?

769
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,080
checking out there. Just a bunch of arcade games or what's the deal?

770
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,840
Pretty much old games, new games. They have Mambo and Go Go.

771
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,080
They have actually Hip Hop Mania 2.

772
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:13,440
There's a couple of DDRs. There's a couple of prototype pinballs that I got to play.

773
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,080
One of them is Kingpin and the other one is Big Bang Bar which our old listeners will know that I've

774
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,360
been into that one for a while.

775
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,520
What exactly do they do at this show? Is this just everybody brings their games

776
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,720
out and people play them or is it trying to sell machines or what are they doing there?

777
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,120
you bring three games you're in as an exhibitor you get in for free

778
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,320
other than that you pay a decent amount to get in like we paid

779
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,120
thirty dollars each just for Saturday. And what do they do? They just let you play games all day?

780
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,240
Pretty much. And there's other little panels going on and different things like that

781
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,120
but really I'm just following all the games around. They actually have

782
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,280
a marquee for a Hercules game which was Atari's biggest pinball machine.

783
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,280
What are some interesting games that you've actually got a chance to play today?

784
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,280
Big Bang Bar.

785
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:04,280
I just got my butt handed to me on Black Knight 2000, which is one of my favorite machines ever.

786
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,280
I damn played Arabian Nights, which I thought was pretty cool.

787
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:15,280
It's got a genie and you hit the lamp and it turns around and you get a different score and everything.

788
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,280
I actually did play some Beat Mania. I couldn't help myself.

789
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,920
I'm mainly just walking around taking pictures for the first part of it, but I'm actually

790
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
going to go back in and play things.

791
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,920
There are a few things I want to try.

792
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:36,600
I also do have some video footage of some of the more rare games too, there's a Tapper

793
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,600
there.

794
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,600
Oh, like root beer tapper?

795
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,600
No, tapper.

796
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Oh, like Budweiser tapper?

797
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,600
Like beer.

798
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,600
That's awesome, because I love Budweiser tapper.

799
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,600
They have a pouillon machine.

800
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,600
Oh, I remember pouillon.

801
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,600
I haven't seen one like this in a long time.

802
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,600
Wow, I was like, yeah, I had that on the Commodore 64.

803
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,600
That's awesome.

804
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,600
They also have the Ultra Kid cocktail machines.

805
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,600
Oh, like the sit down and play?

806
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,600
Yeah, well, the bar top.

807
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,600
Huh.

808
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,600
That's cool.

809
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,600
They have a few of the tables.

810
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:13,600
They actually have the little boxing game which is like you look down inside of it and

811
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,720
you see from the top you have two boxers and they also actually have the mechanical boxing

812
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,720
game.

813
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:27,520
Iím going to play a lot more Black Knight 2000 and a lot more Big Bing Bar and hopefully

814
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,400
I can run into some of the people who own these machines and ask them about their maintenance

815
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,400
and what theyíve gone into.

816
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
Is this something they do every year?

817
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Yeah, they do this every year. In fact, last year, not last year, but the year before that, we tried to go to

818
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:49,400
Classic Gaming Expo and it was really, really slow because this had just finished the week before and nobody wanted to bring their machines back.

819
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:55,400
Oh, interesting. So you got a lot of stuff from classic stuff to new stuff. Do you see a lot of new stuff there?

820
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:05,240
Thereís the grid, it was there, DDR, there was a solo, there was a Mambo Go Go, there

821
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:11,280
was Soul Calibur 3 arcade or anything, they donít have anything super new there.

822
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:24,480
Nothing really really new, but there was a Silent Scope EX, and just a few of the newer

823
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:31,360
machines that most of it's like late 80s early 90s there are a few pins from

824
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,940
like the 40s and 50s so is this something where people go to buy

825
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,480
machines from private place it's like a it's this isn't something where they're

826
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,120
selling to arcades is something where they're selling to hardcore collectors

827
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,680
with lots of money right they're selling to collectors and not everything is

828
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,840
really expensive but that hip-hop mania machine I was playing yeah 400 bucks hmm

829
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,920
It's in great condition, much better than Golf Lands ever was.

830
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:04,640
We didn't bring a truck or anything, so that's debatable, but we went over that

831
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,360
hip-hop mania and he's been drooling over some of the prototypes.

832
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,760
That Big Bang bar that we were looking at, we sort of talked just back and forth as we

833
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,760
had the $10,000 to blow on it.

834
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,260
Wow, why don't you give me the $10,000 I'll make good use of it.

835
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,960
Well, the reason why is that there's only 16 of those machines in existence.

836
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,960
Oh my gosh, wow, wow.

837
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,360
Yeah, that's why it was a big deal for me to play one.

838
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,860
Anything else you want to share about the show with the listeners and anything?

839
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:35,260
I'm still going tomorrow. If anyone's in the Bay Area or nearby, come check it out.

840
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:35,960
It's worth it.

841
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,860
Alright, very cool. So, what's the name of the show again? Do they have a website?

842
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:44,860
California Extremes go to... actually you can just do a Google hunt for it or

843
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,220
It's CAXtreme.com, I think, or.org.

844
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,900
Okay, very cool.

845
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,740
All right, well, thanks for calling in.

846
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,420
We miss you, and we'll see you next week, okay?

847
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,540
Okay.

848
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,180
All right, later.

849
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,660
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, Jamie, the chat room said hi.

850
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,540
But anyways...

851
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,380
Well, after I hang up on her, thank you.

852
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,100
Well, sorry.

853
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,180
I'll send her a text.

854
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:05,900
Sorry, Tara.

855
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,980
But, you know, I want to play arcade games.

856
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,020
I know!

857
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:09,980
Why did she get to go?

858
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,100
I want to go.

859
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,140
Almost as fun, I guess.

860
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:18,020
But uh, well that makes me angry that we're not there. So you know what that means? I don't care if she's not here

861
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,020
We're taking her segment. Hell yeah

862
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Why don't you start us off Logie?

863
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:35,140
Fuck you to stupid people who can't park correctly and I'm sorry

864
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,620
This also kind of goes to Christopher Exeter

865
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:42,360
He parked like a bitch taking up two goddamn spaces with his car

866
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,700
We saw a woman last night driving a stupid minivan parks in like four spaces. There's walks right out

867
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:54,900
Dumb bitches from Alaska though. I don't know if that makes a difference doesn't but you know still that kind of stare

868
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,660
They're like you're an idiot goddamn

869
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,940
I mean, I understand there's not a lot of people in the parking lot

870
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,980
But when you take up four spaces because you're too fucking lazy that you park correctly. I

871
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,940
I hate people like that and I'm sorry it always seems to be women in cars.

872
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,340
But then again you get punk ass bitches who drive their fucking giant trucks that take

873
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,300
up six spaces too.

874
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:20,540
Or the ones that park with a goddamn U-Haul or some sort of trailer on there and they

875
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,180
take up six spaces because they park across all of them.

876
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:28,220
Fuck you, you do not need to be going to the movies if you have a goddamn trailer on your

877
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,220
truck.

878
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,300
So just leave it at home.

879
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:37,040
I'd like to give an F.U. for what I believe is the second week in a row to the sun.

880
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,900
You might remember last week on the show I had a sunburn, well guess what, when I was

881
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,980
in Canada, I went to Canada with my best friend, that's where I was on vacation, why I wasn't

882
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:49,060
here on Sunday, and we decided one day randomly we were just going to walk, we were going

883
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,580
to walk across this bridge, Burrard Bridge, because somebody had told us it was fun, so

884
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,700
we walked across, ate some lunch, and we walked back and we were like, let's just keep on

885
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,700
walking.

886
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,060
So we walked all the way to this place called Stanley Park, which is this huge park in Vancouver

887
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:07,380
That's bigger than Central Park, and we walk the entire perimeter of Stanley Park now this whole time

888
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,900
I'm worried that I might get a sunburn again, so I'm asking my friend John

889
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,360
I'm like do it do I have my training colors my training things like no you look fine look fine

890
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,600
Well, we get back to the hotel after this walk

891
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,640
Which you know the perimeter Stanley Park is 10 kilometers so add into that all the other walking

892
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,480
We did we probably walked more like 10 miles by the time all is said and done

893
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,520
And then we get back to the hotel room, and I'm bright pink. I'm like John

894
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,480
I'm bright things like you didn't look pink earlier

895
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,760
and I'm getting redder and redder and redder.

896
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,800
Oh my god, I had the world's worst sunburn,

897
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,880
it was horrible.

898
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,540
But, and I know this isn't more of an F-you,

899
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,040
but I will say a big thank you to Canada's pharmacies

900
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,760
because they sell certain drugs in Canada

901
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,920
you can't get here in the US,

902
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,040
and one of them is aloe vera gel with lidocaine in it,

903
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,400
which is like numbing stuff

904
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,680
that you have to get with prescription here.

905
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,840
Made my sunburn feel much more bearable,

906
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,920
but still, I had to miss Saturday night clubbing,

907
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,960
so I was upset with that.

908
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,520
Otherwise, I love Canada, I love it.

909
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:03,780
I love Vancouver and I want to go back and yeah but I wish I just had more money to travel

910
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,700
maybe I'll just move there I'll ditch this show and move to Canada I'll be fun Shane

911
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:16,700
do you have any angst you want to get out um no I don't think I'm angry about anything

912
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:25,760
right now all right well then F you for not being angsty F you to me for not being angsty

913
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,240
moving on with

914
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,960
some more news back into the gaming news the Final Fantasy 3 DS

915
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,320
Wi-Fi feature may have been revealed and it's

916
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,440
emailing. It comes from a screenshot from

917
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,360
JUMP which is a Japanese magazine it looks like Final Fantasy 3 on the DS is

918
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,760
gonna make use of the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection but

919
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,560
basically you're gonna send letters to each other friends back and forth and if

920
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,120
you exchange the emails

921
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,240
it will trigger special events in the game

922
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:00,040
I guess that's better than nothing but at the same time where's like one-on-one battle

923
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:07,100
or adventure the world with friends or something a little more maybe now to be fair maybe this

924
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:13,320
is just one element and there's more to come but if this is it it's kind of weak I mean

925
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:18,360
I guess it's better than nothing it's better than nothing but it's it's a little weak a

926
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,900
little lame do it I'll still buy it though don't get me wrong they're gonna have another

927
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,420
Another game for like instant messaging and another game that you have to pop in and you're

928
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:31,900
all like I gotta email my friend in Final Fantasy 3, oh I gotta chat with him using

929
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:38,480
Metroid Prime Hunters, oh I gotta, oh it's kinda lame.

930
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,980
But anyways, kind of on a little bit of a different topic here.

931
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:50,580
Square Enix's president was interviewed by IGN here, or they have the interview on IGN

932
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,580
I should say.

933
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:57,200
And he was talking about basically different things, online gaming, kind of where he sees

934
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:04,380
things going, and a little bit about testing their games before they go out for example.

935
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,520
And one of the things he says is because of the way that they have the systems now where

936
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:15,680
you can patch them later on, extensive testing is not needed to release a game.

937
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,160
Hopefully that's not a trend we're going to start seeing, where these games go out,

938
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,860
yeah it's okay I'll fix it later

939
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,960
it doesn't matter. You might be out of a job Miklotov

940
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,280
Why? Well because if they don't need testing on the games that they're just gonna

941
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,440
patch everything

942
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,440
I haven't tested a game in forever. Oh you're moving on up the corporate ladder now huh?

943
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,960
Yeah I'm going up the corporate ladder. But you can't talk about what you do huh? No I can't. Anyways

944
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,800
the quote here is that game makers have until now incurred great cost

945
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,480
during development for debugging

946
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,560
he said basically perhaps we can reduce the cost

947
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:52,440
and suggest that the availability of software updates developers won't have

948
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,560
to work so hard

949
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,160
to find the zaniest bugs. And Wada didn't

950
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,360
use the word patch strictly but you know

951
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,800
that's what his translator said. You know I'm all for patching games to fix bugs but

952
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,640
at the same time don't use that as a crutch I mean if your game has a

953
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,720
you know crippling bug in it you can't release it

954
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,720
out there crash people's systems. Don't you remember like wasn't there bugs in some

955
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,320
Sony game that would like fry your memory card or something like that. A lot of them.

956
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,960
Yeah I mean you can't, that's not cool. You can't just patch that. You gotta

957
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,160
get that out in the testing process and make sure that you know you're not gonna

958
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,200
release a game that's gonna fry my memory card. I understand like some things are a little

959
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,280
different like for example uh the duping glitch in Oblivion. I mean obviously

960
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:39,880
that's something that they couldn't have found you know without really going through there and

961
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,040
no one's saying that the games have to be perfect but like for example the Jaws game that came out

962
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,640
That was super duper glitchy, you know, something like that where they can go back in

963
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,840
They need to really fix before it goes out

964
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:56,500
But if you find like a bug or an exploit and even still I say with the oblivion exploit leave it in there

965
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:01,860
That's your own, you know bug and if people want to use it great, they'll use it. Otherwise, it's not really hurting anything

966
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:06,400
Okay, amigos have you're saying more things in chat that you're saying on the show. Sure. I mean here

967
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,800
Okay

968
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:12,120
my opinion is that you know buggy games come out all the time and it's not like

969
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,120
just because they're saying oh well

970
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:18,160
release updates from them. It's not like

971
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,920
they're gonna quit finding bugs or

972
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,220
anything. It's not

973
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:24,800
like testing is gonna stop because they

974
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:27,040
have this new way to fix bugs that

975
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,700
accidentally get shipped. It's not like you're

976
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,780
gonna get like a really crappy

977
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,860
game. Well... you're gonna get really

978
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,060
crappy game from somebody I am sure. But

979
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:37,240
it's not like you're gonna get one that

980
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:39,320
hasn't been tested at all and there's

981
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:45,240
Some things happen to fall through the system sometimes.

982
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:50,300
Like the demo disc for Viewtiful Joe 2, because that was really terrible.

983
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,300
Was that one of the culprits?

984
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,300
One of the ones that...

985
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,300
Yeah, that erased your memory card.

986
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,300
Oh, that's right.

987
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,300
Yeah, okay, I remember that.

988
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,320
I said I never played it, thankfully, or I might have been a little upset.

989
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,320
Yeah.

990
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:06,420
All right, well, you might know that the Xbox 360 had this huge shortage problem when it

991
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,420
first came out.

992
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:13,460
It's being reported that ATI and Silicon Integrated Systems have said that orders for their chips

993
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:19,740
used in the Wii and the Xbox 360 are picking up in preparation for the holiday season.

994
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:24,260
So it looks like, especially hearing that the Wii is on there is a good sign, that means

995
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,460
Nintendo is apparently already starting to crank out these systems in preparation for

996
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,400
their launch, but of course the Xbox 360 is not going to go another Christmas without

997
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,260
plenty of systems on the shelves for everyone, especially so they can really get out there

998
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,240
and compete with the PlayStation 3 because you'll have a lot of folks making their final

999
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,360
decisions this holiday season, so it'll be very interesting.

1000
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:47,360
Yes, and on top of that, I mean, it's also interesting that they mention that the Wii

1001
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:52,920
is in production because, according to a CNN Money story, they're saying that it's been

1002
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:58,760
in production at least since June 21st, and considering the fact that the PlayStation

1003
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,040
3 hasn't even begun production yet, and the 360 only had about 69 days before the

1004
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:08,000
the sale date. That bodes well for gamers if you're looking for the Wii and it also

1005
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,520
means that in October or even possibly September launch is very likely. I doubt it's going

1006
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,600
to be a September launch because they said specifically that it's going to be in the

1007
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:25,260
fourth quarter and well, you know, September is not the fourth quarter. And anyways, they're

1008
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:31,280
supposed to actually be announcing the official date and price for the Wii in September. So

1009
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,920
Until then, we'll just have to wait, but that's more evidence that, you know, it could be

1010
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,280
coming out in October.

1011
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,400
So at least hopefully they're making it sound like there's not going to be shortages, and

1012
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,720
according to, you know, what I've heard at my work, we actually might get some at launch,

1013
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,040
which means that there shouldn't be shortages out there, because if they're giving them

1014
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:53,880
the distribution at launch, then that's a good sign.

1015
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,880
That's a very good sign.

1016
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,360
Now, are you still sticking to that October 18th date that you leaked out a while ago

1017
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,360
on the show?

1018
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:04,640
so far because you know in our system we had our assistant buyer change all the

1019
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:10,600
dates on me to was it November 15th I think that just because they're tired

1020
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,800
of putting different dates in there for everything and it's kind of what they're

1021
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:19,840
doing with the ps3 stuff until they find out more you know about that but all the

1022
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,880
prebook dates are still where they were before so it's still looking October

1023
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:29,960
from what I've seen so far and you know even if you know they come out and

1024
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,840
announce. It's gotta be October because I know there's another story that was like

1025
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,340
Sports Illustrated for Kids or whatever, saying November 6th.

1026
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:40,880
I think that's too close to the PS3 launch to make it successful. I think that they

1027
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,080
would want to launch at least a month in advance.

1028
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,720
I think we need a friendly reminder because we have somebody in our chat room

1029
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,640
Bandit says, where does Loki work that he gets all these dates? So what kind of...

1030
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:53,640
Is it GameStop, EB? I don't work for GameStop or EB. I work for a game

1031
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,520
distributor. We sell to

1032
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,600
your retail stores. So you're one step up on the food chain.

1033
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:04,760
Sort of. GameStop and EB, they get their dates from a system that's put in by their buyers

1034
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:13,600
at corporate or wherever their office is. We get our dates straight from the publishers.

1035
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:18,840
When they give us dates, updates every week or so, and I look like four or five times

1036
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:25,400
a day to see if there's a new date or a different change or anything, and I look very hard.

1037
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,720
Even then, sometimes the dates change around. Sometimes they're wrong and sometimes I gotta

1038
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,660
fix them like for example our purchasing people made a goof and they put layer

1039
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:37,860
saying that was on PlayStation 2 and I had to correct them tell them no you're

1040
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,140
wrong it's a PlayStation 3 game and they make goose because they have a guy

1041
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:44,900
working for him that does the date entering that's kind of brand new to it

1042
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:49,980
so he messes up sometimes it puts you know wrong dates or you know maybe

1043
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:54,160
lists you know the name wrong but for the most part you know we do get our

1044
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,100
information straight from their sales staff and a lot of times before you'll

1045
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:03,900
here at GameStop because, you know, their sales staff are really loose-lipped sometimes

1046
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:08,500
and they'll leak out, like, I don't know, the entire E3 lineup for Konami, for example.

1047
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,820
Alright, I guess we brought two earlier this year.

1048
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,900
Alright, let's go to the mailbag!

1049
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:17,060
Every week we like to go into the mailbag and read some emails that came to us from

1050
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:20,500
our listeners, and yes, I realize DarkSakura is not here tonight, she's usually the one

1051
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,500
that goes to the mailbag.

1052
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:25,420
However, she gave me permission in her absence to go in there and pull out some letters,

1053
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,940
so let's go to the mailbag!

1054
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:32,780
course you guys can always send us emails it's mailbag at orange lounge

1055
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:38,700
radio.com so let me put on these slightly used gloves hazmat gloves and

1056
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:42,700
dig into the mailbag first email comes to us from an unsigned name it's not

1057
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:46,380
signed but the email address has Andrew in it so I'm assuming the guy's name is

1058
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,660
Andrew well I am new here and I've only listened to one podcast but I really

1059
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:54,040
enjoyed it and could tell that everyone there was really new their games thank

1060
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,040
Thank you.

1061
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:59,160
The reason I sent this email was that I got a DS and so far only have Mario Kart and I

1062
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:04,160
really want to know what are, in your opinion, the best games out for the DS and some that

1063
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:09,440
have a close release date so I can buy one I know that is good and see if I can get them

1064
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,000
really cheap on the net.

1065
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Any help is appreciated."

1066
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,080
phoenix right oh my god phoenix right if you can find it

1067
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,440
phoenix right it's pretty hard to find they're doing a reprint again you can go on capcom

1068
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,040
site capcom is selling them out

1069
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,960
pretty quick oh really capcom site great but they're

1070
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,800
they're printing them as much as they can because they have to print them over in like

1071
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,840
hong kong or something like that and then ship them over you know in a batch

1072
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,520
and then those sell out like almost if you can't get an american one

1073
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,920
the recently re-released japanese one does have an english option

1074
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,760
And since the DS is region-free, you can import that and play it.

1075
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,760
It's totally worth it.

1076
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,800
I would say what you probably want to do, Tetris DS of course, you know, great stuff.

1077
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:53,160
New Super Mario Brothers is very popular, if you like the old ones I think you'll get

1078
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,160
a kick out of it.

1079
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,160
New Super Mario Brothers is pretty cool.

1080
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,160
It's a good value.

1081
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,640
I actually want to get some of those bit generation games that are coming out in the Game Boy

1082
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,200
Advance because they look pretty cool.

1083
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,680
I would recommend Hyli Meteos if you like puzzlers at all, definitely get your hands

1084
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,800
on Meteos, it's still a good value.

1085
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,740
And I think it's actually pretty cheap, you can find it out there, I think they were doing

1086
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:13,340
like a clear out of them at uh, I think Toys R Us or something?

1087
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:16,460
Uh, yeah, it really depends what type of games you like.

1088
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:20,160
I mean, but the DS has some solid hits in every genre right now, so...

1089
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,160
Go check out...

1090
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,160
Except racing.

1091
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,160
Go to Mario Kart!

1092
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,720
It doesn't count because it's fun.

1093
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,740
Go check out the new section over at like, you know, Gamestop or even go check out the

1094
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:34,280
bargain bins down at like Toys R Us or KB Toys and stuff like that and see if you can

1095
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:40,400
find some of the first generation games out there that may be a bit cheaper and go from

1096
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,520
there to build up your library.

1097
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,200
Our second email of three tonight comes from Seth.

1098
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,600
Hi, my name is Seth and I'm 15 and I listen to the podcast every week.

1099
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,120
The past couple episodes you've been discussing the new laws that are being made in states

1100
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,440
such as Louisiana.

1101
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,920
I think these laws are ridiculous.

1102
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,880
I'm young and I play violent games.

1103
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,920
I don't ever get the urge to go outside and shoot people.

1104
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,360
If I played a Harry Potter game, which I don't, I wouldn't go outside with my mom's broom

1105
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,880
and jump off the roof because I think I can fly.

1106
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,160
I believe that the government is just trying to find an excuse for why kids are going out

1107
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,160
and shooting up their schools.

1108
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,400
Thanks for having such a great show.

1109
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,720
I listen to OLR every week."

1110
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,360
Well, thanks for the kind words.

1111
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,160
Hey, you know what?

1112
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,160
Pretty smart kid there, you know, with the Harry Potter reference.

1113
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,640
That's a pretty interesting comparison there.

1114
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:28,640
Exactly.

1115
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,420
I mean look at was it that movie the boy who could fly?

1116
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:34,860
Did he have like a high you know rate of suicides after that movie?

1117
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,700
Cuz I mean he jumped off his roof and started flying

1118
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,220
You know, did we see kids, you know, just trying to kill them

1119
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:41,580
So now kids do imitate try to imitate the movie sometimes though

1120
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:42,900
Like I'm trying to what was that one?

1121
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:47,720
We're like it had a scene where people were lying down in the middle of the road and some kids tried to imitate that and of

1122
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:53,840
Course got run over and then they like re-released the movie with that scene edited. I was years ago. God, I'm

1123
01:05:53,840 --> 01:06:02,840
I know what you're talking about. Yeah, it's stupid and it's just media in general. They want to blame media because obviously it's not the parent's fault, you know.

1124
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:08,840
Never the parent's fault, but I think they're starting to get it, but they just, not quite.

1125
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:16,840
And especially though this is only going to be brought up again once Saint Rose comes out, once Scarface comes out, once Reservoir Dogs comes out.

1126
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,840
This fourth quarter is really bad when it comes to this whole violent game thing, so.

1127
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:30,840
So let's go to our last email tonight, which comes to us from Grin without a cat.

1128
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:37,760
Hi guys, I've been listening to the podcast for a couple months now.

1129
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:42,340
I'm in the UK, so it's a little bit late for me to stay up to listen live as some brave

1130
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:45,600
soul did the other week, but I look forward to each download.

1131
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:50,000
I wanted to respond to what the PMS and Fragdoll clans had to say about the beauty pageant

1132
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,640
at the gaming event that had them quite worked up.

1133
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,080
I don't agree with the beauty pageant, but what right do these girls have to get so annoyed

1134
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,080
with it?

1135
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,880
They say they object to the way girl gamers are seen and want equality, but then they

1136
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,200
go around saying, hey look, we're a clan of girls, look at us.

1137
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,960
If they want to be accepted as just regular gamers, why do they go out of their way to

1138
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,840
separate themselves from others?

1139
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,400
The word hypocrites comes to mind.

1140
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,480
Also I think an OLR gaming group is a great idea.

1141
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,440
I'm planning to get a 360 in September as I'm really interested in live and making my

1142
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:31,040
gaming experiences more sociable, but I keep hearing enjoyment of live relays on a good

1143
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:45,120
friends list and all my gaming friends are PC only gamers, so to have a group of friendly

1144
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,120
faces to ease me into online gaming would be welcome.

1145
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:54,880
On the second point there, I can say, I love this, if you go to the forums, there's a thread

1146
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:01,160
where people have started talking about OL Army clans, that's O-L-R-M-Y-O-L Army, on

1147
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:05,400
different games, and I've seen some really impressive stuff that is very flattering.

1148
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,200
Have you checked out this thread?

1149
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:16,440
We put a picture of our podcast art on Counter Strike in some mod or something, and it's

1150
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:19,940
really funny because if you look at the picture, the screenshot somebody took, the gun is pointed

1151
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:22,780
right at your face, Loki, it's great.

1152
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:26,100
But then, no, I thought this was cool too, I guess there's a Guild Wars clan as well,

1153
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,960
and somebody just posted a picture of their cape, and it's like an orange cape, and they

1154
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,260
couldn't really put their own logo on it, but they put something that looked like Sakura

1155
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:36,240
blossoms on it for Dark Sakura.

1156
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,240
Get it?

1157
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,240
I thought that's cute.

1158
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:43,240
Our listeners are so awesome. So check out that thread on our forums and you can find some gamers.

1159
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,240
There's even an Xbox Live gamer tag exchange. And I even give out my gamer tag. I don't care.

1160
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,240
My gamer tag is on there and I have a bunch of friends.

1161
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,240
Sadly enough, I am paying for live, but I don't really play over live. I don't get it.

1162
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,240
I do once in a while.

1163
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,240
Yeah, I really need to get down to...

1164
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,240
I'll play Halo 3 when it's out for sure.

1165
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:04,240
I don't really have that many good games that I want to play. Like, Burnout even over live, I don't really care for it that much.

1166
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,240
I thought Burnout was fun. I'm just not good at it, so it doesn't give me incentive to play.

1167
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,320
want to play ChromeHounds over live I think that'd be fun because ChromeHounds

1168
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,920
is actually gonna allow you to do clans so I think that's something that they

1169
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,880
really need because I don't know you don't really have that over live all

1170
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,960
right well thank you guys so much for the emails we really appreciate if you

1171
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,080
guys want to send us an email as well you can always do that it's mailbag at

1172
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:31,400
orange lounge radio.com also we started a new segment last week called the

1173
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,240
voicemails of the week we wanted to try something a little different using our

1174
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:39,640
Skype line and we invited you guys to send us some voicemails in regards to a

1175
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,240
particular topic and some of you guys called in about the topic but one of the

1176
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,920
voicemails we're gonna play tonight has nothing to do with the topic at hand but

1177
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,720
it's still kind of funny so we'll play it and I was very overwhelmed with the

1178
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,740
response when I went in there to go look you guys I'll tell you guys off-air how

1179
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:58,560
much we are was pretty cool. Overwhelmed like you cried? No I didn't cry but I was

1180
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,900
just very happy that a lot of people were responding to it so I'm glad you

1181
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,940
guys like this but unfortunately that means we can't play every voicemail so please don't

1182
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:09,660
be hurt if we don't play your voicemail but we get three really good ones that I want

1183
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,660
to play and I'll give you guys a new topic and maybe some of the people who didn't get

1184
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,620
in this week can get in next week.

1185
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,580
Anyway, so let's go to the voicemail.

1186
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:19,740
Here's voicemail number one and the topic last week was do you pre-order games because

1187
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:21,620
remember that fight you got in with Dark Soccer?

1188
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,420
It was pretty bloody.

1189
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,740
Anyway here's the first voicemail.

1190
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:32,740
Hello Orange Orange Radio, this is the all-infamous Fury Lover answering your question of the voicemail of the week.

1191
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:42,740
I actually pre-order certain games that I would like to buy that I know would get, that would be sold out.

1192
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:49,740
And I think the advantages of actually pre-ordering games are actually quite good,

1193
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:56,740
quite good because if you pre-order a game from trusted sources like GameStop or EB Games,

1194
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:04,100
you know you'll have the game when it comes out or whenever you want to get it. But pre-ordering

1195
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:11,100
games from things like FYE and stuff like that is just horrible. So yeah, that's all

1196
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:17,300
I have to say. Thank you. Bye. Thanks for the voicemail, Yuri Lever. I think

1197
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:20,700
It's interesting because it sounds like he trusts some stores but he doesn't trust others.

1198
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:25,480
And it's true because some stores I think actually do buy direct from the publishers

1199
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,480
and some don't.

1200
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,800
So they might get them late or might not get them at all or they're reliant on some other

1201
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,800
stores to get them.

1202
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,980
So it seems like Yuri Lever is saying, you know, stick with the stores that deal in games.

1203
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:38,220
I would say games are probably pretty good, the pre-order stuff, because they usually

1204
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:42,260
try to throw in like a little goodie with it, like something free.

1205
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:45,540
I forgot to tell, I was going to say it when DarkSakura was here when she's not here tonight,

1206
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:50,100
I pre-ordered Final Fantasy XII. I usually don't pre-order games, but because of that

1207
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:54,100
special little bundle they're going to have and I'm just such a whore, I pre-ordered it.

1208
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,420
What about The Urgent Service?

1209
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:01,380
I'm not as interested in that game. I might pick it up, but I'm much more interested in XII. The

1210
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,500
Urgent Service isn't really Final Fantasy. I mean, sure, it's Vincent, but it's not really

1211
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:09,540
Final Fantasy. Something different. You know, having a modded PS2 really opens the options

1212
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:14,660
for me as far as where I can get that game. All right let's go to our next voicemail.

1213
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:21,380
Hello O.R. this is Razorburn 2021. Your question I believe was about pre-ordering games and

1214
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:29,700
if I don't have to I try not to pre-order games. I believe there was an argument that I'd read a

1215
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:36,260
year or two something like that ago in the arcade about the problems with pre-ordering games is that

1216
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:40,780
that's kind of how game stores gauge what they should stock, and you talked about games

1217
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:45,300
like Point Blank DS that are difficult to find, and that's because generally no one

1218
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:51,900
pre-orders them. So if I don't have to, I try not to. I don't recommend it. I don't

1219
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,580
generally have to pre-order movies. I don't generally have to pre-order CDs or several

1220
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:00,300
other things that I like to buy. I would just like it if I could go into a game store and

1221
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:04,380
purchase what I want to. I appreciate your show. Have a good day.

1222
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:10,320
Thanks for the voicemail. I think that was an interesting one because he gives a good argument for why you should pre-order games

1223
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,740
But then says he doesn't do it

1224
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:17,520
But I like I like that he gave the kind of comparison there about the I don't pre-order movies or CDs

1225
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:24,100
Yeah, I seem to recall though. I seem to remember a day where you could pre-order CDs who buys CDs anymore

1226
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,900
Anyway, why would you need to pre-order?

1227
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,900
Hey, I you know, I

1228
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:34,140
The thing is, I'm glad the internet's there, and I do every now and then like going into

1229
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:39,340
a CD store like Tower and going and just like, going through their dance section or their

1230
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:43,020
import section and just listening to what they've got, and a lot of times it's hard

1231
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,180
to find stuff.

1232
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:47,460
That's kind of why the reason I turned to the internet, because you know, you can't

1233
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:55,340
find something because it was only on a single vinyl, and I'm not gonna buy a $10 record,

1234
01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:01,000
know, even though I do have two turntables I don't ever use, and a microphone, huh, forget

1235
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
it.

1236
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,220
But, well, I think it's interesting because it sounds like this caller likes to do the

1237
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:12,260
same sort of thing but with games, just kind of wants to go in and see what's available.

1238
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:15,860
Yeah, in movies I don't think it's going to be such a big thing where you'd have to actually

1239
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:19,900
pre-order that, some games maybe, if you're really looking for some niche.

1240
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:24,060
Alright, this next call had nothing to do with the question at hand, but whatever, it

1241
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,620
interesting so I'll play it anyway.

1242
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:33,420
Hey, this is MacMan, and I was just listening to the podcast that I got during iTunes and

1243
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,620
The Poohs.

1244
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:41,340
Now what, I'm not sure if you, if you all got your thoughts together in like a complete

1245
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:45,180
box together in this area enough.

1246
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:51,220
Could you elaborate on your feelings about the gayest name of a video game accessory

1247
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,420
and or console ever created?

1248
01:14:53,420 --> 01:15:00,380
um that's it bye gayest name of a video game accessory that's a random question

1249
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:04,380
well i i did you hear about the tech and butt plug actually that's come no uh

1250
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:11,180
uh i that's easy the res trans vibrator the res trans vibrator the trans vibrator is

1251
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:15,900
i think it's someone that was on e when they figured out that when they're like

1252
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:22,380
dude it vibrates with the music that's awesome uh it feels totally good when i'm on e and i'm

1253
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:26,360
touching it you know a week later and I still don't believe that poos thing that

1254
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,140
they're gonna call the Sony controller the poos that's that's a load of crap

1255
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:34,660
that's a load of poo is what it is I don't I don't buy it I mean if I'm wrong

1256
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:39,260
I'm wrong and I weak for Sony because that's I mean God is I mean we have been

1257
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:42,980
kicked I mean the gaming community's been kicking those guys non-stop to me

1258
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:47,440
E3 and this is just another like oh my god but I that's why if they called it

1259
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,600
the poos that would be the candy sprinkles on the icing of the cake I

1260
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:55,960
that's all it would really be you don't need it but it's there and you got to appreciate it so

1261
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:01,880
i don't think it's gonna matter what they call the controller because you know if they called

1262
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:08,360
the controller you know a giant dong no one's still gonna buy that system you know at least

1263
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:12,680
as much as they would if it were you know 200 cheaper funnydale in our chat room has a good

1264
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:19,880
comment here i know uh the ass poking game that's only in japan you know you see you've seen pictures

1265
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,060
of this all around the internet and if you could use your finger I mean

1266
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:26,440
hypothetically you could use a you know what forget forget wherever that

1267
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:30,580
thoughts going I think that's it for the voicemails of the week overall though it

1268
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:33,700
seems like you guys the kind of general consensus I was getting for the

1269
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:38,660
voicemails is that you guys prefer pre-ordering for certain games but not

1270
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:42,020
everything we thank you guys for your voicemails and sorry to those folks we

1271
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:44,960
didn't get around to if you would like to leave us as voicemail please do the

1272
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:51,360
The number is 916-226-9067, but remember that may be a toll call, so please, if you don't

1273
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,120
pay the bills, ask whoever does their permission first in our question.

1274
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:59,200
Or use a cell phone, because a lot of times they get free long distance.

1275
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,160
Make sure it does before you call, if it's not yours.

1276
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,160
Nights and weekends.

1277
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,400
Again, if you're not paying the bill, you better ask.

1278
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,400
Or you can use Skype.

1279
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,340
You can call us on Orange Launch Radio at Skype anytime when we're not live, and you

1280
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:11,600
also get the voicemail that way, and I think we did get a couple voicemails that way.

1281
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,240
The question we have for you guys, you know we want your opinions on this.

1282
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:19,000
whole Sony billboard controversy what do you guys think of that I mean is that is

1283
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,320
it being overblown do people have a right to be upset was it in good taste

1284
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:26,840
bad taste what do you think of that whole controversy I love to hear from

1285
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:30,480
you guys on that one and we'll play some of our favorite voicemails next week

1286
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:38,360
meanwhile back to the news yes and speaking about strange stuff DOAs

1287
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:45,800
I can't even pronounce his name, but Tagi, or Itagaki, that's right.

1288
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,600
This is why I'm not Japanese.

1289
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:55,320
Anyways, he admits to being quite intoxicated while creating DOA4, and he's all, pretty

1290
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:59,020
much, I'm drinking pretty much full time.

1291
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:04,000
Of course there are ups and downs, waves of how I drink in terms of the amount, but it's

1292
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,480
long periods of time.

1293
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:12,640
In the last 10 years, not that you asked this question, I think I had better ideas when

1294
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,080
I was drinking whiskey.

1295
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:21,800
When I'm drinking shochu, that's a conservative drink, so the ideas are not that great.

1296
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:28,200
Beer is just like water to me, so it helps me and everything else loosen up a bit.

1297
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:32,760
It doesn't really contribute to coming up with ideas.

1298
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,800
Everything is explained on why there was a dead or alive volleyball game now.

1299
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,620
explained cuz most people when they heard that were like what that explains

1300
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:44,900
also explains why come on that guy is such a rock star I mean seriously when

1301
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,500
you look at pictures of him and see him in interviews he's just a freaking rock

1302
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:51,380
star I mean he's like the Tommy Lee of game designs right and you know he just

1303
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:54,880
you know he's the type of person that probably thrashes hotel rooms sits there

1304
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:59,580
with a fat cigar in his mouth while he's probably you know designing games you

1305
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:03,780
know it's no surprise now I kind of wish that we bowl was kind of like handling

1306
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:09,120
DOA the movie because if it got you know all fucked up this guy could come beat

1307
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:15,360
the crap out of him Japanese break a bottle over his head exactly he should

1308
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,520
put himself in the next DOA game because that would be awesome I would love to

1309
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:26,720
play him in DOA that might sell another copy of the game for me I do a forum I

1310
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,660
don't play DOA for it's sitting collecting dust check it out it's funny

1311
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:34,360
you played on live I've actually played that kind of game on live I get my

1312
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:38,600
absolutely because I suck at it crazy you know avatars and stuff that you can

1313
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:43,560
sit there as you know why you're waiting for a game it sounds kind of fun all

1314
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,760
right for those of you that like your games a little more conservative you'll

1315
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:53,840
probably enjoy this the Bob Ross game that's coming out Bob Ross interactive

1316
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,000
is actually having a contest right now it started on July 4th and they are

1317
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,920
accepting work but only those that are created using Bob Ross's patented wet on

1318
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:08,240
wet technique. Why are you giggling? Because that was funny sounding. Here's

1319
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:11,280
with the wet on wet technique for those who haven't watched the show. You put a

1320
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:16,760
base coat of their paint on it and then you get dirty. When I say

1321
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:22,200
happy trees you probably think something dirty in that too. No. Isn't that funny

1322
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:26,440
that we went from a dead or alive story to wet on wet? Anyway now it's not funny.

1323
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:31,480
using Bob Ross approved materials. How would he approve it? He's dead.

1324
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,800
Because it has to be like, you know, licensed, I don't know.

1325
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,480
Anyway, you gotta be 18 years or older to enter. You can only submit up to three

1326
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,120
paintings

1327
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,800
and they have to sign all these waivers that they might use your designs but hey

1328
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,520
your artwork could be in a video game

1329
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,360
so if you're a Bob Ross fan and you want to paint yourself some happy trees and happy

1330
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,920
clouds and maybe see them in a video game

1331
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,520
go for it!

1332
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:58,880
Let's see, the original story actually ran on www.nintendogal.com, but I believe you

1333
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:04,920
can actually visit www.bobross.com for more of the details.

1334
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,400
Bob Ross, Beyond the Grave, ooh yeah.

1335
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:20,240
Anyways, speaking of stuff that's, I don't know, dead, the PSP security on the firmware,

1336
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:25,400
pretty much dead cuz now you can downgrade again if you happen to own a

1337
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:31,640
you know 2.6 or 2 points or 2.5 or 2.6 firmware that's right folks you can

1338
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:35,280
downgrade because they're groddiest upgraded me to 2.6 just you know yeah

1339
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:39,080
well Grand Theft Auto was probably one of the ones that you know got you the

1340
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:47,400
2.5 and 2.6 for me was Katamari but they have decrypted 2.5 and 2.6 and now there

1341
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:51,240
is a downgrader and actually if you visit PSP updates they have tons of

1342
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:55,840
different downgraders that you can get to do that including one that will

1343
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:01,600
downgrade you from 1.5 to 1.0 and for those who don't remember 1.0 was the

1344
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:07,000
original Japanese firmware that allowed you to run homebrew no problem and also

1345
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,240
kind of in the similar story firmware 2.7 has been decrypted and they're

1346
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:16,960
They're working on a downgrader for that.

1347
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,120
Why don't they just get the homebrew to work on 2.6, then I don't have a downgrader.

1348
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,120
They have.

1349
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,120
Okay, good.

1350
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:29,680
They have that, and they also have this thing where you can actually run 1.5, and it will

1351
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,440
give you the features of 2.5.

1352
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:36,800
So you have the RSS features, the web browser, and you can play 2.5 games on there.

1353
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,580
Wi-Fi doesn't quite work well though with that, but still kind of neat that they're

1354
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:47,080
doing it and you know, I don't know, I don't really follow the homebrew stuff that much

1355
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:51,560
anymore. Do they have a Nintendo emulator for 2.6 firmware? It's basically anything

1356
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:56,400
works with 2.6. Although the thing with 2.6 is you have to have Grand Theft Auto in order

1357
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:01,800
to do all these workarounds. So yeah, you may want to downgrade or something or just

1358
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:08,760
don't play emulators on there because whatever. Get a DS for that. There's a lot of stuff

1359
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:17,140
for that. What is that? I can't play Kid Icarus on my DS yet? You can if you have the stuff

1360
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:25,100
for that you can get emulators. But I don't! Whatever! Wine! I thought there was something

1361
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:29,680
really interesting though that kind of ties in with this. They released a new version

1362
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:35,180
of PSP Revolution and because our show used to be about Bomani, you can use this game

1363
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:41,500
it's basically step mania for the psp so if you do end up downgrading to 1.5 check out psp

1364
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:47,900
revolution version 0.2 and that'd be really fun to play on a handheld and they've had they've

1365
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:53,100
ddr on the gameboy is stupid they've added themes they've added theme support and arrow speed

1366
01:23:53,100 --> 01:24:01,340
modifiers as well as um aug music files are now supported and um yeah marathon songs and all that

1367
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:07,720
sort of stuff so check it out if you're really interested in step mania on your

1368
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:13,120
PSP all right well completely changing gears here we haven't talked a whole lot

1369
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:18,020
about Microsoft tonight because you know Xbox 360 it's out there's not a lot you

1370
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:20,840
know and it's got their games coming out so we don't have quite the rumors that

1371
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:24,680
we have with Sony and Nintendo however Microsoft does have some rumors of their

1372
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:34,680
It's been reported by Bloomberg that Microsoft may be working on an iPod killer that's supposed to hit shelves this Christmas.

1373
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:42,680
Microsoft's device will be able to connect to the Internet and other devices using the Wireless Fidelity, or Wi-Fi standard, which iTunes doesn't have.

1374
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:50,680
Microsoft is also promising the screen will have better quality picture than the iPod, according to the people who saw the slideshow Microsoft is using to promote the device.

1375
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:58,680
The music and TV companies are interested in working with Microsoft in order to blunt Apple's power in the market, according to people close to the media companies.

1376
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:03,680
Now, it doesn't really directly tie into gaming here, because they haven't said a lot about gaming features,

1377
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:12,680
but you can assume that, especially with, I would say, the whole Xbox Live Anywhere thing that's going to be on the cell phones and all that,

1378
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:16,680
this might play into that, or something else.

1379
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:20,720
I would say maybe like Xbox Live Arcade stuff possibly

1380
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:24,120
possibly so don't count it out I mean if this whole thing is true to me

1381
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:27,280
They do have Xbox Live Arcade for the PC as well I mean

1382
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:32,080
so and if you ever visit zone.msn.com I think it is the zone

1383
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:37,660
they have gaming badges set up very similar to how Xbox Live works it's very

1384
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:38,760
interesting so

1385
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,120
because MSN obviously Microsoft runs that too

1386
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:46,000
I don't doubt Microsoft probably gonna put something out there to compete

1387
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,200
so I don't doubt that this rumor is probably true

1388
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:52,900
but it will be very interesting to see what that is because we've had kinda all sorts

1389
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:53,500
a little

1390
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,680
like rumblings of course we've had the loudest one was the origami

1391
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:00,520
you know we saw pictures of that and then that's more like just a PC

1392
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:04,000
in your hand yeah pretty much and then there was you know the rumors of the

1393
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:04,880
ex-boy

1394
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:09,240
all that stuff you know I almost see them doing something like

1395
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:13,040
the Nomad for the original Xbox

1396
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,320
in something like this. That's kinda where I'm seeing this going

1397
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:21,680
is maybe like a portable Xbox like an original one where it plays the old Xbox games

1398
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,640
so they don't really have to make new games

1399
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,480
but I don't know. I think it might be a little late to do something like that but

1400
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:32,840
I thought. GK128 in our chat room says it figures Microsoft is coming out with a

1401
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:35,520
Super MP3 player just as I bought a fancy new one.

1402
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,360
Don't worry Apple put out the video iPods like a week after I bought mine.

1403
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:43,920
Yeah, jerks. Well, something that's definitely going to be

1404
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:47,240
implemented with probably this is going to be some sort of

1405
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:50,800
e-distribution, especially of music and movies, but of course

1406
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,080
Sony is talking about doing games, because, you know,

1407
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,680
their first priority, of course, is games with the PS3, right?

1408
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:02,320
Anyways, so they're definitely talking about doing something to

1409
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:06,160
the sense of, you know, Xbox Live's marketplace, where you can be able to

1410
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,600
download arcade-type

1411
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:14,600
And according to an article that was on Gamasutra, definitely something that they're going to be doing.

1412
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:20,600
Certainly being able to sell growably online makes it easier to reach in international and remote markets.

1413
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,600
On the business side, it also lowers the cost of sales and eliminates inventory risk.

1414
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,600
It should help Crutale use game sales and piracy.

1415
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:33,600
I don't like the whole use game sales thing, but I can understand the piracy, I guess.

1416
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,360
something tells me that's not gonna work just like they think it's gonna but

1417
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:43,680
sure. Wherever security is pirates will follow but you know E-distribution is not

1418
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,800
surprising at all.

1419
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,320
Please Sony do not go out there saying

1420
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:53,160
our security is better than everybody else's. We're gonna be able to

1421
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:56,160
you know beat all the pirates out there because that's just like picking a fight.

1422
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,160
That's poking the beehive so

1423
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:03,200
you shouldn't be doing that but anyways so yeah definitely they're gonna be doing

1424
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:08,960
something probably similar to actually I'm thinking putting on Playstation 1 games to

1425
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,720
be able to download straight to the hard drive being that the size of the files should be

1426
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,920
a lot smaller and they're also going to be doing something similar with the PSP so if

1427
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:22,400
they can do it on the PSP they can definitely do it on the PS3 so that's kind of a given.

1428
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:30,360
And also maybe even later on down the lines being able to stream all real PS3 games so

1429
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,360
that they're interested in. What's kind of interesting though is their comment here

1430
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:39,360
we're looking for fresh new ideas that fully exploit the power of the PS3.

1431
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:45,360
Our first party products are unique to the PS3 and some of our games by virtue of the design and hardware demands

1432
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,360
could simply not work on the Xbox 360.

1433
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,360
Oh really?

1434
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:53,360
So, I don't know.

1435
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,360
Alright, we'll see how that goes.

1436
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,360
But I do have something real quick.

1437
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:02,760
Oh sure, the Playstation Beyond site that launched during Game Developers Conference

1438
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:03,760
this year.

1439
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,840
And you always see this Play Beyond thing, how much do you want to bet that they're calling

1440
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,120
their marketplace Beyond?

1441
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,120
Just a thought.

1442
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:13,000
That's an interesting thought.

1443
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Because that's a big game.

1444
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Sure, it makes sense.

1445
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,360
Maybe it'll tie together in the end.

1446
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:22,680
Anyway, changing gears here, Empire Interactive, been some rumblings out of there this week.

1447
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:27,000
The FlatOut franchise is going to be coming to the Xbox 360.

1448
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,200
It's called Flat Out Total Carnage, and for those of you guys not familiar with this series,

1449
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,960
it originally came out July last year.

1450
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:37,680
It's got destructible cars, kind of like a racing game, and of course scenery, and it's

1451
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:40,000
got sadistic minigames inside it.

1452
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,800
You go into barriers at high speed, you eject the driver to hit targets like a giant dart

1453
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,840
board or bowling pins.

1454
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:47,840
It sounds like you're...

1455
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,840
I've never heard you talk about this game.

1456
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:49,840
I played Flat Out.

1457
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,020
Oh, I played it last year when it first came out.

1458
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,320
It's a pretty fun game.

1459
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:57,320
You actually, it's more of kind of, this year they rebuilt the whole game from the ground

1460
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:01,640
up, so it's a lot better, a lot faster, it seems like a cross between Burnout and Destruction

1461
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:06,400
Derby, and you also have a whole ton of mini games, they call it like the Ragdoll Olympics

1462
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,400
type stuff.

1463
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:12,640
And you can basically eject your driver out, like the one for example is baseball, and

1464
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:17,520
you eject your driver out, and he flies up towards this giant baseball bat and then smacked

1465
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,920
with the baseball bat and you fling his body into a mitt.

1466
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:27,140
And I can tell you this much, you can play these minigames and they will keep you entertained

1467
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:28,140
for hours.

1468
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,140
Especially you.

1469
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:32,200
You probably sat there and giggled for like an hour.

1470
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,200
Oh yes I did.

1471
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:38,720
I played the high jump like, I don't know, for at least a half an hour just like looking

1472
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,720
at the thing.

1473
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:40,720
And it was fun.

1474
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,720
It's a pretty fun game.

1475
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:42,720
This one looks a lot better.

1476
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,760
Flatout 2 is coming out in a few weeks.

1477
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,400
Xbox, PC, and Playstation 2.

1478
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,840
Yeah, I think I'm on the...

1479
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,840
August 1st.

1480
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:50,840
This fall.

1481
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:51,840
August 1st.

1482
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,840
They're wrong.

1483
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:53,840
Oh, we'll see.

1484
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:59,000
Alright, also, Empire Interactive is coming out with a PSP version of Taito Legends, and

1485
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,440
is also working on a version of Ford Street Racing for the PSP as well.

1486
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,440
Ooh, goodie!

1487
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,440
Ford Street Racing.

1488
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,160
That's just such an awesome game!

1489
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,520
I haven't played it, don't really have an opinion on it.

1490
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:14,240
Lame-o is what you might call that game, but yeah.

1491
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:19,880
Anyways, something that's not quite as lame as Forged Racing there.

1492
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:26,240
Zelda is actually, there's a homebrew Zelda for mobile phones, and they're calling it

1493
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,240
Zelda.

1494
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:33,000
That's kind of funny because when you think of Zelda you think of Wind Waker or Phantom

1495
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Hourglass even.

1496
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:39,320
Well it's funny you should mention that because they actually are using the Minish Cap graphics

1497
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:45,080
so it kind of looks a little bit like Wind Waker, and sort of Wind Waker and Zelda.

1498
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,960
I thought Minish Cap looked more like the old school Super Nintendo one.

1499
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,080
Yeah, it kind of, but here's a few things.

1500
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,880
Too bad it wasn't as fun.

1501
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:59,080
But anyways, there's actually some pretty impressive graphics on there, and they have

1502
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:04,760
the latest demo which is working on Mi Deep P2 compatible phones, and there's actually

1503
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:10,160
a way you can check it out to see if you have it or not or a compatible phone a lot of them

1504
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:14,600
out there I don't even know how the hell to put this on my phone to be honest but if you're

1505
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:20,400
interested though they also have a PC version and it should be interesting if you want to

1506
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:26,720
check and see what kind of phone you have if it'll work there's a website it's rumkin.com

1507
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:40,720
I'll check that out, that's a cell phone game I might be able to get into.

1508
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:46,720
Oh actually I'm sorry, this is the website jbenchmark.com slash phone details dot jsp

1509
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:52,600
and that'll let you know what kind of phone you have and if it supports that and so that's

1510
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:58,200
kind of neat and the PC version I'm kind of willing to check out and I believe his website

1511
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:16,340
has gone down since this article but if you're interested at zeldamobile.gorthwoh.com, gorthworth

1512
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:21,920
or something whatever but check it out they have some screenshots it looks pretty sweet

1513
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:25,040
and you can download the PC and the mobile version for that.

1514
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,560
Very cool. Just a matter of time before Nintendo shuts them down, right?

1515
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,920
Why doesn't Nintendo get into cell phone gaming? I know I keep saying I hate cell phone gaming,

1516
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:36,120
although I will say this week I actually noticed that some

1517
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:40,400
games, like I used to have a version of Castlevania on my old phone and

1518
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:44,360
Burger Time and Magical Drop, and I noticed finally new versions of that

1519
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,080
came out that work on my new phone.

1520
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:49,600
And they've actually been upgraded. The Castlevania game looks pretty nice now.

1521
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,280
I was actually pretty impressed, except for the fact that the controls are shit, but I

1522
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,920
guess that's just because I don't really have a controller to plug into the phone, although

1523
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,300
I know they make them.

1524
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,620
But I was somewhat pleased.

1525
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:06,420
It's still not as good as a Game Boy Advance version of it, but you know, now this homebrew

1526
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:09,060
version is actually a remake of number one.

1527
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,500
Right, yeah, I'd heard that there was a remake of number one.

1528
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,500
That's pretty cool.

1529
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:15,900
Alright, one other quick story on mobile gaming, this is interesting.

1530
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:21,180
Now you know that women in gaming don't get a whole lot of coverage sometimes.

1531
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:25,340
It's a controversial subject, you know, are they really in a game, dah, dah, dah, dah.

1532
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:26,340
But...

1533
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:27,340
Maybe if they were people.

1534
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:28,340
Oh, stop.

1535
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:29,340
We're gonna get angry.

1536
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:30,340
You're right.

1537
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:31,340
You're good.

1538
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,340
You better be glad Dark Soccer's not here tonight.

1539
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:33,740
You should shove that microphone up your ass.

1540
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:38,680
Anyway, there was a new study that came out called the Electronic Gaming in the Digital

1541
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:45,320
Home from Parks Associates and it says 51% of U.S. folks who are playing games on their

1542
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,680
mobile phones are women.

1543
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:51,200
So the majority of cell phone gamers are women.

1544
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,680
Because they don't know what a good game is.

1545
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:56,800
Hate mail is coming in for you.

1546
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:01,560
Here's a quote from the study, women are the foundation of the gaming market and as an

1547
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:05,060
industry we need to cater to their preferences and this came from the director of research

1548
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:10,600
John Barrett at Parks Associates continuing, this effort is key to future revenue growth

1549
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:15,220
because right now women generally spend little on gaming even though they like to play games

1550
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:17,340
and often have disposable income.

1551
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:21,340
The industry just needs to find a game they are willing to pay for.

1552
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:22,340
Interesting.

1553
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:25,820
I don't know, why do you think that is?

1554
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:30,140
Just because cell phone games are easy to pick up or that maybe the games they put out

1555
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:35,900
on cell phones tend to be more puzzle games, pop-cap type games that reach the non-gamer

1556
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:42,080
in general, not just women, but the non-gamer in general, because obviously not all women

1557
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,080
are non-gamers.

1558
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:48,060
have one that co-hosts the show and you know we're talking about you know plus

1559
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:53,740
those are very simple so then women can understand them well that's just one but

1560
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:59,100
the non gamer women whatever hate mail coming in you can address those cards

1561
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:02,540
and letters to Shane he doesn't have an orange on Twitter account though we

1562
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:06,940
won't give him one after that that's for sure I you know what's interesting

1563
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:09,860
though I was I was mentioning before in Nintendo will probably shut that Zelda

1564
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:12,700
thing down but they're really not in cell phone gaming and it seems like if

1565
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:17,260
Nintendo's trying to make this real, you know, we want to reach all the non-gamers, this

1566
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:20,220
should be evidence to them that maybe they ought to get into mobile gaming.

1567
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:24,060
And I, again, am not a big fan of mobile gaming, but I would think it would be kind of cool

1568
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:26,740
if I could play like Ice Climber on my cell phone or something.

1569
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:27,740
Maybe.

1570
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:28,740
Yeah, I don't know.

1571
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:29,740
What do you guys think?

1572
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:34,220
We're going to open up the Skype line right now if you guys want to call in on any subject

1573
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:35,220
really.

1574
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:38,140
If you have a question or comment or whatever you want to say, our Skype line is open.

1575
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:43,500
For more information, go to www.orangelaunchradio.com, click on interact with us, or you can always

1576
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:51,200
give us a call on our normal phone line, it's 916-226-9067, but remember kids that it might

1577
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,820
be a toll call if you don't live next door to us.

1578
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:58,460
Meanwhile while we wait for some calls, do you have any quick last minute stories, anybody?

1579
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:03,260
No, but I don't know, I think this is kind of interesting.

1580
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:08,120
I was trying to look up and see what my phone had, but unfortunately I am stupid and I don't

1581
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:09,320
I don't know what kind of...

1582
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:10,540
I know I have a Samsung phone,

1583
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:15,240
but the model number is something I don't know.

1584
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:18,760
And so, yeah, that makes it tough.

1585
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,760
Although I think it says on my phone.

1586
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,080
All right, let's go.

1587
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,400
Actually, I wanna read some comments real quick,

1588
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:24,640
then we'll go to Skyblind.

1589
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:28,720
GK128 in response to the cell phone story.

1590
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,120
My grandmother lives off of shitty Pogo games.

1591
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:34,040
Their simplicity and fun to non-gamers is the draw.

1592
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:36,640
Yep, I agree, that's probably what it is.

1593
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:41,800
let's see funnydale says oh miklotov you'll love this if Nintendo wants women

1594
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,660
to get into gaming they need to come out with a vacuum controller that's why I

1595
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:50,660
said he rocks you guys are horrible we're only speaking the truth well he

1596
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:54,640
said I'm not like the views that I say but the views and opinions expressed by

1597
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:57,920
Miklotov are not necessarily those the rest of us anyway hi you're on orange

1598
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:03,400
launch radio who's this you should know by now who it is as much as I call every

1599
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:07,400
single week I know we get the same callers every week you know I have to

1600
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:12,680
say this though callers I've been I lurk sometimes on some message forums that

1601
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:17,240
people don't know I lurk on and I saw some people talking smack about Orange

1602
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:22,380
Lounge Radio and basically you know what they say the weak point of the show is

1603
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:29,240
the call-in segments so you know we open up this show to folks to call in because

1604
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:32,440
we want it to be your show we don't want to be here and be all over better than

1605
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:37,340
You know we want this to be your show as well, so but I just want you guys to know people on the interweb

1606
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:39,000
We're talking shit about you, but it's okay

1607
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,300
They talk shit about dark Sakura myself and Loki all the time as well, so what can you do fuck them?

1608
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:46,980
It's okay, cuz I got your back, so I know you you'll protect us. What's on your mind Rama

1609
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,000
Not much as a couple of things

1610
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,760
I want to talk about now as you brought up about people talking smack I've removed from anime next

1611
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:58,080
They had a group they call otaku generation dotnet doing a podcast

1612
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:03,360
Podcast they gave their card and I said hey have you heard of Orange Dodge radio and one of the guys said yeah

1613
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,360
I've heard of them, but this show isn't all that good, so I was like well

1614
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:13,840
I am close friends with the staff he did a 180 like oh this show is great. They're awesome. Don't hurt me

1615
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:22,040
Interesting you know what though you know why I'm not I I don't think indie podcasters should be bashing on each other

1616
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,200
I don't think it's a smart move. I think the indie podcasters should be coming together

1617
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:29,480
You know, I've never listened to that program, I don't know anybody over that program, you

1618
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:32,480
know, whatever, I have nothing bad to say about them, because I wouldn't.

1619
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,900
If I did have something bad to say about them, I wouldn't say it at all, because I think

1620
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:40,220
any podcasters have to work together, because we have to work against corporate dollars

1621
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:44,800
and all this, you know, corporate stuff, which by the way, reminds me about the whole podcast

1622
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:45,800
awards thing.

1623
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:50,840
The nominations are open right now for the podcast awards, www.podcastawards.com.

1624
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:54,840
Obviously we would love it if you would consider nominating us again in the gaming podcast

1625
01:39:54,840 --> 01:40:00,520
category but honestly guys as long as an independent podcaster wins it I'm happy

1626
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:04,160
and across the board and I encourage you to nominate other independent podcasters

1627
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:08,340
in the other categories as well this is how we get the word of mouth out and I

1628
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:11,480
think independent podcasters should be working on promoting each

1629
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:14,280
other not cutting each other down because then that's when the corporates

1630
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:17,800
will just sneak through and win I have plenty of bad things I have plenty of

1631
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:21,060
bad things I can say about corporate podcasts but I just I try not to be

1632
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:27,420
negative anyway sorry tangent my bad it's okay send me a bunch of cards

1633
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:32,420
Otacon is like in a month I'll pass them out all right and if there's any haters I

1634
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:36,020
want you to cut them for me of course all right what else is on your mind

1635
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:40,340
Rama okay there's a couple of things I spoke with Jamie about I need to tell

1636
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:45,780
you guys now there was talk sometime back about older Super NES games that

1637
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:51,020
had a load time and one of them was Street Fighter Alpha 2 okay there's

1638
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:56,220
another game I remember renting from the door it was Batman Returns every time

1639
01:40:56,220 --> 01:41:00,700
you went to the next level it went to black and I said now loading two minutes

1640
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:05,980
later I'm in the next level for real yes Wow I don't I thought I played the

1641
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:10,800
Batman Returns game too wasn't that like a final fight type game sort of but it

1642
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:15,960
was like really stick figures like streak of rage

1643
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:19,160
interesting well i mean it wasn't again it was one of those movie franchise

1644
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:20,760
games it wasn't that great

1645
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,840
most movie franchise games kinda suck most but there are you know some that

1646
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,160
stand out but anyway

1647
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:27,920
okay well that's

1648
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,600
i wish that dark soccer was here to hear it but maybe she'll listen to the show

1649
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:33,880
later and oh i already told her about that okay good

1650
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,160
anything else on your mind

1651
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:38,120
you talk about how much you're a big fan of bubble bobble right

1652
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,780
yes love bubble bobble and rainbow islands

1653
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:45,880
forget about the third game there was a bubble bubble three yes uh-huh and I

1654
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:50,000
think there was no I think there was a legit bubble bubble to you think in

1655
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:58,160
snow brothers nope okay what parasol stars oh three for a turbo graphic yeah

1656
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:01,000
I've played parasol stars I keep forgetting that's technically in the

1657
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,800
bubble bubble world no they had a version of parasol stars I want to say

1658
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:08,440
on Nintendo as well it was crap but it was there are you serious I want to say

1659
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:10,880
I don't know if I am tip it might have been one of those really bad

1660
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:17,400
Asian, you know, they're releasing bubble bubble revolution and the Rainbow Islands revolution for the DS pretty soon

1661
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:20,280
must have

1662
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,240
What

1663
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:24,760
As long as partial stars is in there. I'll buy it

1664
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:28,220
I know I it's not I I wish they would put these games in this unlocks

1665
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:32,280
That's why I made sad faces when salamander wasn't in the gratis collections

1666
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:35,440
You guys know as its life force if you don't deal with the import love life force

1667
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,680
Yeah, that's like one of the best ones. It's not in the collection. Yes. I agree sad

1668
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,320
bad Konami bet will you

1669
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:42,440
Mikotoff we

1670
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:47,040
Know it's somebody for what because they didn't put salamander in the granny's collection salamander

1671
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,040
I don't care. I'm okay. I care

1672
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,320
Rabble rabble rabble Xbox Live arcade rabble rabble

1673
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:56,520
No comment. All right

1674
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:59,680
Rama yeah anything else on your mind

1675
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:02,680
Something to talk to Loki about.

1676
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:09,680
Okay, Loki, you talked about last week how the anime video games aren't doing as successful as expected.

1677
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,680
I can tell you one of the reasons why.

1678
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:18,680
One of the reasons is because some of these games are already being played on import at anime cons,

1679
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:22,680
and then when these companies bring them over, the main thing that the fans complain about,

1680
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:26,680
they want the Japanese voices, and they're originally taken out.

1681
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:30,720
They take them all out and and the fans don't really want to buy them. Well, stop doing that

1682
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:36,200
You don't know that's what they do. That's not in soul caliber. You can pick between the two

1683
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:40,480
I love that especially toshinden three. That's all my all-time favorites. Yeah, I

1684
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:45,520
Mean I got narrow to fit ninja and I'm dealing with half the voices

1685
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,680
I'm like, come on when they did that half ass

1686
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:51,680
You know Yasha fighting game you had the option of Japanese and English voices

1687
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:56,080
I mean when they did the 2d fighter from ps1, they threw us a bone. I'm like, come on

1688
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,760
Let's go for it. Well Rama this calls running long. We gotta let you go, buddy

1689
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,180
We want to get some other folks in but thank you so much for the call. Have a good one

1690
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:07,160
Okay, I kind of took up most of your time. I apologize. No problem. It's all good. All right, you're on every week

1691
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:09,160
Anyway, all right later

1692
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:14,880
All right, Skypline's open we'll take one more call I we don't have a lot of time for a lot of calls tonight

1693
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:20,000
So one more call here's someone else who calls in every week. Hi, you're on Orange Lodge radio. Who's this Ravens dolphin?

1694
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,840
Hi, what's on your mind Ravens dolphin? One thing do you do you like online rental games?

1695
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:31,640
I know you've mentioned about pre-ordering how about going to the next stream online rental you talking about like game fly. Yeah

1696
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:34,400
Um, I haven't used it myself

1697
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,720
I use

1698
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:40,760
Netflix and I think that was a big mistake because I've had the same movies for about six weeks now because I've been doing so

1699
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:45,160
Much traveling lately. I haven't even watched them. My roommate uses a game fly. I think it's a good idea

1700
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,200
I

1701
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,960
It's hard for me to comment on it because I haven't really used it firsthand and I don't want to comment on something

1702
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:55,760
I haven't used but it's something I I'm if I cancel my Netflix

1703
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:01,940
Which I'm probably going to I will probably shift over to gamefly because I just play more games than I watch movies

1704
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:04,800
I just really well. What do you think do you use it? I?

1705
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:10,100
Just signed up day and I'm just trying it out. What do you think? What do you think so far?

1706
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:13,080
How was the setup online and everything and the ease of getting started?

1707
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,800
plus

1708
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:20,840
Super seamless, all you have to do is just create your game queue and they'll send it to you unlimited

1709
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:27,100
And that's what I like because games are getting expensive Sony wants to put $100 to $50 per game now

1710
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:31,560
You know, it's interesting. It's gonna be very interesting to see what the

1711
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:39,040
Online rental market is gonna do to some of the game ideas. That's I guess this kind of stuff's getting bigger and bigger. So

1712
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:42,000
Interesting. I am tempted to check it out

1713
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,240
Why you know, we do we do a podcast that lots of people listen to can't one of these companies. Give us a free one

1714
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:51,720
OK, maybe that's just my ego getting in the way I guess.

1715
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:55,720
I might check it out, but again I don't want to have that and Netflix

1716
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,600
Although I have a friend that has them both.

1717
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:00,400
A co-worker of mine uses it and seems to like it.

1718
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,360
So I'll check it out one of these days.

1719
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,320
But for now I'm more of a collector.

1720
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:08,760
I bet if Dark Sakura here, that would be her angle on it.

1721
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:09,960
She likes to collect them.

1722
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:11,160
So she likes to own them.

1723
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,400
And actually have them.

1724
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:19,020
I'm very I do know one that does rent legend games, but I can't remember it

1725
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:23,380
All right. All right, buddy. Well, thanks for the call. Have a good one. Okay?

1726
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:26,620
All right. All right. Well, we'll see you later

1727
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:29,660
Bye. Bye. Bye

1728
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:32,400
Hmm. I found something interesting. What's that?

1729
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,640
I found a picture of

1730
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:41,300
An Xbox 360, uh-huh motherboard and they're saying that it's gonna get an HDMI

1731
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:47,880
HDMI out upgrade and that they're putting good HDMI out port right next wait. No bad. I already have an Xbox

1732
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,600
Well shit, so that this is on Kotaku

1733
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:57,280
From a game stop and then we can put that credit towards a new one

1734
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:02,200
Not that I really need HDMI out, but I think that's kind of interesting that they have that

1735
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:11,280
on there all right well any more stories anybody has Loki I don't have anything I

1736
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:15,640
don't think I have anything either all right well then I think we're gonna go

1737
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:19,320
ahead and wrap it up so let's go around and get everybody's final thought Shane

1738
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:22,120

1739
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:25,880

1740
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:30,800
to people I'm sorry we ruined your night final thought um women shouldn't be

1741
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:38,000
allowed to vote oh Loki your final thought my final thought is actually the

1742
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,960
official statement from Sony regarding the Apple logo on their site in a recent

1743
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:47,880
update the PlayStation 3 section of the US PlayStation comm website an external

1744
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:52,560
error was made during the upload process and the Apple icon was mistakenly placed

1745
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,280
on the site we immediately fixed the problem apologize for any confusion this

1746
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:01,400
may have caused they copied they stole it from somebody but they're not copping

1747
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:07,200
