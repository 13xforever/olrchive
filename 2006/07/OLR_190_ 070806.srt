1
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:24,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, Sony stirs up major controversy with a new billboard, Nintendo gives President Bush a birthday present, and does Microsoft have some secret Christmas plans?

2
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:53,378
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

4
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,060
[SPEAKER_09]: We brought on our good buddy Shane.

5
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,480
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

6
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing good.

7
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Also known as Miklatov.

8
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:19,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

9
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:21,761
[SPEAKER_09]: And now Shane is actually, he's being hardcore tonight.

10
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,322
[SPEAKER_09]: He's actually playing a game during the show.

11
00:01:23,702 --> 00:01:24,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm multitasking.

12
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:26,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hardcore every show.

13
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,383
[SPEAKER_09]: You usually play games too, don't you?

14
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:30,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you do them on break.

15
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:33,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be doing the music break and then he comes back.

16
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:35,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes you yell at me if I play them during the show.

17
00:01:35,284 --> 00:01:36,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because it gets distracting.

18
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:37,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Even this is distracting.

19
00:01:37,524 --> 00:01:38,344
[SPEAKER_09]: You just turn it down.

20
00:01:38,904 --> 00:01:40,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how to work a Mac.

21
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:42,485
[SPEAKER_09]: He's playing on my Mac.

22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,370
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you playing?

23
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,451
[SPEAKER_09]: You're playing World of Warcraft, right?

24
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:47,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing World of Warcraft.

25
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:47,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun.

26
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:48,392
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

27
00:01:48,752 --> 00:01:52,193
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get into the show real quick, but just first a couple housekeeping announcements.

28
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:55,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we are taping a day early this week.

29
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:57,054
[SPEAKER_09]: We are live on Saturday, not Sunday.

30
00:01:57,774 --> 00:02:03,976
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you'd like to join us, if you're listening live to OrangeLaunchRadio.com right now on the Saturday evening, head on over to our chat room, OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

31
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:04,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on chat.

32
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:08,017
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be back to our regular taping schedules next week.

33
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:30,266
[SPEAKER_09]: So Sunday the 16th at 6pm Pacific Time, we're taping live on our station, OrangeLawnTrader.com But of course, you can always catch up via our podcast feed, which is also at OrangeLawnTrader.com Also tonight it's only going to be a one part show, there's not going to be a part B this week But just like last week, it ended up being at least an hour and a half, if not more So that's probably what tonight's show is going to end up being a little bit of too

34
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:32,292
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's get it started.

35
00:02:32,312 --> 00:02:35,073
[SPEAKER_09]: We always like to start off with what we've been playing this week.

36
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:36,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, what kind of video games have you been playing this week?

37
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:40,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been trying to finish Blazing Angels the entire game.

38
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:43,218
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have 6 out of 7 achievements, so that's all that matters.

39
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:44,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Achievement points, whore.

40
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:49,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I've already beaten the game, and I can tell you this much, the game sucks really bad.

41
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:51,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you keep playing?

42
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:58,086
[SPEAKER_10]: I got it for free, and I want to finish the achievement points before I send it back to its, you know,

43
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:01,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Use Game Grave at GameStop

44
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,271
[SPEAKER_10]: All the missions are basically the same.

45
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:26,872
[SPEAKER_10]: And some, like, the missions are, you know, pretty similar difficulties.

46
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:30,533
[SPEAKER_10]: And then some are just, like, way out there, like, way too damn hard.

47
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:32,114
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't get why they did that.

48
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:34,374
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it goes, like, super easy afterwards.

49
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:35,755
[SPEAKER_10]: So, whatever.

50
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:36,975
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm almost done.

51
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:42,397
[SPEAKER_10]: All I gotta do now is I have to play through these standard arcade modes, which you have to play with 32 different planes.

52
00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:44,878
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have to play it 32 times all the way through.

53
00:03:45,878 --> 00:04:13,164
[SPEAKER_10]: and basically you take on like four different waves of planes and it's really boring but once I do that I'll have the last achievement so that's all the matters um and I don't know if the multiplayer online's any good but I know the multiplayer split screen's kind of lame so I don't know be worth checking out I did also get to play the Chromehounds demo which is pretty awesome and um you know unfortunately the mechs are pretty slow in it so I

54
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,987
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I did play a little bit more of that.

55
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:17,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't wait for the final game to come out, I think, this week.

56
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,790
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Prey, also played some of that.

57
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,091
[SPEAKER_10]: That game reminds me so much of Duke Nukem 3D.

58
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:24,712
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just crazy.

59
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:35,798
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually have inside the arcade where you first start off in the bar, there's an arcade game that's like Pac-Man, and you can actually play the arcade game in there, which is kind of neat.

60
00:04:36,398 --> 00:04:43,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So, very interactive, just like Duke Nukem 3D, and kind of similar to Doom 3 in how dark and, you know,

61
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:52,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead Rising, Saints Row, Enchanted Arms My gaming week, I was in Canada most of the week on vacation, so I took a vacation from the internet and gaming a lot in general, but I did

62
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,768
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

63
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,943
[SPEAKER_09]: and Gradius 4 I don't think I've ever played before.

64
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:46,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played 5, I've played 3, I've played 2 on emulators because it was only out in Japan, I believe.

65
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:52,610
[SPEAKER_09]: But now I've gotten a chance to play all the Gradius games and it makes a good collection.

66
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:57,833
[SPEAKER_09]: They enhanced Gradius 1 and 2 a little bit so that it's widescreen.

67
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:04,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not perfectly the PSP's resolution, you can downsize it to the regular resolution, but it works well on the widescreen.

68
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:07,218
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't feel like the game's stretched or anything like that.

69
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:09,430
[SPEAKER_09]: The game plays pretty smoothly.

70
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say my favorite game out of the bunch is Gradius Gaiden, probably Gradius 3, my least favorite, just because I don't...

71
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:16,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't like the way that game starts.

72
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:18,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like the first stage in it.

73
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:21,358
[SPEAKER_09]: The difficulty curve in that one seems to be a lot higher than the other games.

74
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:25,261
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a good game for rekindling all your favorite Gradius memories.

75
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, oh, it's the Easter Island heads and all that stuff.

76
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:32,206
[SPEAKER_09]: The only other thing that probably bothered me about the game was the price.

77
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was $39.99 for the game.

78
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:42,594
[SPEAKER_09]: And while it's a real great, you know, it's still a pretty good value, it's kind of surprising that old games are demanding $40.

79
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:44,135
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess it's just because

80
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:46,657
[SPEAKER_09]: You get so many of them, and they did rehash it.

81
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:47,939
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good buy.

82
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I would recommend it, especially if you're into shooters.

83
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:53,268
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good no-attention-span shooter.

84
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,071
[SPEAKER_09]: You just pick it up, go, have fun with it.

85
00:06:55,644 --> 00:07:25,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I also like that you can save your progress anywhere so you can just save and come back later instead of having to start over every time like the old versions of Gradius the other disappointment is that I don't see Salamander unless it's an unlock I need to check GameFAQs to see if maybe I just haven't unlocked it yet because I haven't actually beat any of the Gradius games yet while I've had it because I keep having ADD I go back and forth to all the different games and I couldn't get the up up down down left right left right BA code to work mainly because there is no BA buttons on the PSP but I press what I think would be BA but it doesn't seem to work

86
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

87
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:53,891
[SPEAKER_09]: So Konami's got some good stuff coming out?

88
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:54,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

89
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:54,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for me.

90
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:20,799
[SPEAKER_06]: and people that work there in Konami.

91
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I also played some Wendon this week because I love that game a lot.

92
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:46,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And my computer at home broke so I can't play WoW there so to pass the time I downloaded Bejeweled 2 on Xbox Live Arcade and that game, I always loved Bejeweled and I don't think it works too well on the 360 but it's got really good music so it was worth it.

93
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:48,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's pretty.

94
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:50,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give it that.

95
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:51,098
[SPEAKER_06]: The game?

96
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:51,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the music?

97
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:53,899
[SPEAKER_09]: The game.

98
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,099
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks nice on HD and all that good stuff.

99
00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:05,103
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks nice, but it's not as easy to play because when you play it on computer you have your mouse and you can go really quick to whatever little jewel you want to swap.

100
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:09,884
[SPEAKER_06]: But this one you have to move up three times and left three times.

101
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:14,446
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think it plays well, but the music's really good.

102
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:17,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess the only other thing I've done this week is at work

103
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:21,691
[SPEAKER_06]: We follow a certain site's... Can I say that site right there?

104
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:22,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

105
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:22,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's fine.

106
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:28,546
[SPEAKER_06]: We follow the GameFAQ's Best Series Ever contest, and we put money on it.

107
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:34,119
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been paying very close attention to that this week, and I'm very upset by what's going on today.

108
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:35,780
[SPEAKER_06]: What's happening today right now?

109
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo is losing to Castlevania, and I picked Halo to win over Castlevania.

110
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,445
[SPEAKER_09]: They do those little tournaments once in a while.

111
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:44,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they do the best video game characters.

112
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:46,368
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like $130 at work is on the line here.

113
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:47,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo is like two games.

114
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:49,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't really call it a series.

115
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, there's a third game coming out, but...

116
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:54,233
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not much of a series.

117
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but they're only two of the most popular games of all time.

118
00:09:57,034 --> 00:10:02,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but how many systems has Castlevania been on versus how many systems that Halo's been on?

119
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:10,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I would vote Castlevania, personally, but that's just because... Yeah, I would have too, but you have to think, okay, these people that come to the site, what do they like more?

120
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought maybe they like Halo more.

121
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wrong.

122
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently they like Fire Emblem more than Silent Hill because they're idiots.

123
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:17,482
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

124
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:18,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Fire Emblem or Silent Hill?

125
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:43,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm looking in our chatroom over at OrangeLotsRadio.com, click on chat.

126
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:47,093
[SPEAKER_09]: And GK128, I guess, is in some sort of betting pool, too.

127
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:48,934
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, Halo's loss fucked me, too.

128
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:50,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I chose Halo to go three rounds.

129
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:52,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's terrible.

130
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:53,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know what?

131
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:57,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo wouldn't have won over Kingdom Hearts, which is the next two in.

132
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,441
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, Halo couldn't make three rounds.

133
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:01,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Which series did you pick to win it all?

134
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:06,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the final two being Final Fantasy and Zelda, and I have Zelda winning.

135
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:09,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, Final Fantasy, a lot of fanboys

136
00:11:31,465 --> 00:11:33,346
[SPEAKER_06]: and come on, Final Fantasy VII person?

137
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody loves Final Fantasy VII.

138
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:38,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, Cloud, Aeris, Sephiroth.

139
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Sephiroth versus Cloud for a little bit.

140
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:41,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Tidus and Yuna.

141
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:42,732
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on.

142
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:47,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just trying to use my knowledge from last year because I didn't win last year.

143
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:47,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even come close.

144
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:49,817
[SPEAKER_06]: This year I'm doing better, though, at least.

145
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:50,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Cecil from IV.

146
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:52,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Who?

147
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:54,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Locke, the treasure hunter from VI.

148
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,241
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a thief.

149
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:57,481
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, forget it.

150
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Edgar better.

151
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:00,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

152
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:19,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't Pirates come out this week, too?

153
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:27,149
[SPEAKER_10]: It was supposed to come out last week, and I think it got delayed to the 5th, and yeah, it came out finally.

154
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that anybody cares.

155
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,911
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a decent game.

156
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:32,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Pirates of the Caribbean?

157
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I saw it at E3.

158
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,552
[SPEAKER_09]: They gave us a little demo.

159
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:37,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Bethesda actually invited us to a thingy we went to.

160
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:40,434
[SPEAKER_10]: It was better than the PSP game, I can tell you that.

161
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:44,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I was more impressed with their Star Trek game they're making, but the Pirates game seemed pretty solid.

162
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:47,417
[SPEAKER_09]: For a movie title, you don't expect...

163
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,760
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

164
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:08,708
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

165
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:11,571
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to probably check it out when it comes out in September.

166
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:14,173
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, Reservoir Dogs.

167
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:18,077
[SPEAKER_10]: That's got me interested now that they explained why it was banned in Australia.

168
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:19,258
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, where's my Kill Bill game?

169
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:19,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Why was it banned?

170
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:21,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's your what game?

171
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you listen to this show?

172
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:23,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Just out of curiosity?

173
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:25,103
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

174
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:25,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's your what game?

175
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:26,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Kill Bill.

176
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:27,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Kill Bill?

177
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:28,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

178
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:31,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Red Steel.

179
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:32,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Red Steel is probably close enough.

180
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:38,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn off all the color on your TV and then play some really gory game and there you go.

181
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,761
[SPEAKER_06]: There's your Kill Bill game.

182
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Misty in our chatroom says, Who needs new games?

183
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing the hell out of Emerald and Tetris Worlds on GBA.

184
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:51,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeremy Todd 1 wants to know if Battle for Middle Earth 2 is any good.

185
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:52,468
[SPEAKER_09]: He's thinking about getting it for PC.

186
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:53,169
[SPEAKER_09]: How's the first one?

187
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

188
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:56,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it got pretty decent reviews.

189
00:13:57,047 --> 00:14:12,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, though, it doesn't really look that... I used to love RTS games, especially the Command & Conquer series, but I think I liked it mainly because I could use... I could cheat and make my own characters, almost.

190
00:14:12,672 --> 00:14:15,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that was more fun to me than actually playing through the game.

191
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:18,833
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do like... I love the online from Red Alert.

192
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:19,934
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my favorite game.

193
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:20,614
[SPEAKER_10]: You know,

194
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in my day Back in my day

195
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Bandit sent me a private message in chat saying he had a great gaming week.

196
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:51,199
[SPEAKER_09]: His local arcade just got DDR Supernova and his legs are killing him.

197
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,160
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely worth it.

198
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess DDR Supernova is starting to get into arcades there.

199
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:59,824
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, I know a large part of our fan base has followed us from the Bomani days when we talked a lot about those type of games.

200
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:04,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, I'm definitely looking forward to checking out the final build of Dance Dance Revolution Supernova.

201
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:08,608
[SPEAKER_06]: We just got them in the bay at the Golf Lands, but of course we've had it at Konami forever.

202
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:11,129
[SPEAKER_06]: and... Well, la-di-da.

203
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:24,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm curious to hear what people think of the timing, because, I mean, I haven't played it enough to, like, really figure out if it's bad or not, but I'm hearing reports that it's pretty dang terrible.

204
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:33,254
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if anybody has played it, like that one guy, whoever you just said, I would be interested in hearing what he has to say.

205
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:36,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, let's get into some gaming news, and we'll come back to chatroom comments a little later.

206
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:37,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

207
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:47,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I do want to point out real fast, I did look up Gradius on GameFAQs, and I don't see anything about there being the hidden game.

208
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:55,267
[SPEAKER_09]: So that kind of disappoints me, that they don't have Salamander locked away in it.

209
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:56,207
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes me kind of sad.

210
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, let's get into some news.

211
00:15:58,548 --> 00:16:00,209
[SPEAKER_09]: This made a lot of people sad this week.

212
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:04,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly was a polarizing topic in the gaming community.

213
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:10,198
[SPEAKER_09]: You might have heard Sony actually put out an ad for their ceramic white PSP.

214
00:16:10,598 --> 00:16:14,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the ad actually only ran on billboards in the Netherlands.

215
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:18,843
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course, thanks to the internet, the image has circulated worldwide.

216
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:22,986
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you haven't seen the image yet, go to just about any major gaming site.

217
00:16:23,006 --> 00:16:23,986
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see a picture of this.

218
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:30,230
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically a white woman with white hair wearing a white outfit kind of grabbing this billboard.

219
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Black Woman with Black Hair in a Black Outfit

220
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:55,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony Spokesperson GamesIndustry.biz

221
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:23,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Central to this campaign has been the creation of some stunningly photographed imagery that has been used on large billboards throughout Holland.

222
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:31,735
[SPEAKER_09]: All of the 100 or so images created for the campaign have been designed to show this contrast in colors of the PSPs and have no other messages or purpose.

223
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:32,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

224
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:34,956
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think of this?

225
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:37,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people are stupid for reacting about it.

226
00:17:37,517 --> 00:17:37,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

227
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:38,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really.

228
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:39,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's retarded.

229
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:42,619
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, some of the other pictures that they showed weren't that bad.

230
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:46,160
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they showed like, you know, a cut in half and basically one's white, one's

231
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:50,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Black, not necessarily showing the women, you know, poking each other or whatever.

232
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:54,684
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a fucking ad in another country.

233
00:17:55,025 --> 00:18:00,367
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thing that pisses me off the most is when politicians over here are going, I don't want to see that in my neighborhood.

234
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:05,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, your neighborhood is all the way up in fucking, you know, what, Denmark is where it was?

235
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:09,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's stupid that, especially Congressman Yee.

236
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:12,412
[SPEAKER_10]: That guy's a dumbass and needs to shut up.

237
00:18:12,432 --> 00:18:12,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

238
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Make a political statement about something that's in another country.

239
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:18,113
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll do what they fucking want.

240
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:20,555
[SPEAKER_11]: They have nudity on television over in the UK.

241
00:18:20,755 --> 00:18:22,636
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't see them going, Oh my God!

242
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:23,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God!

243
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:25,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Two people of different color.

244
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:28,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I have never seen that in my entire life.

245
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:30,022
[SPEAKER_11]: And oh my God, it's so racist.

246
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,484
[SPEAKER_09]: To be a devil's advocate here for a minute though, Sony, I mean, just, you know, give the aside.

247
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:35,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not really sure how I feel about this.

248
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:35,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't...

249
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:48,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the image is a little odd and it doesn't exactly make me excited about the... I kind of go, well that's certainly going to get attention, which I guess an advertising campaign is supposed to do, but it's kind of one of those...

250
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:53,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't put an image like that out advertising Orange Lounge Radio, that's for sure.

251
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:56,396
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what the worst thing about that image is?

252
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:56,916
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

253
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,657
[SPEAKER_06]: That Europe's getting the white PSP and we're not.

254
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:00,717
[SPEAKER_06]: That made me angry.

255
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:03,559
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing that I really got from that.

256
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:09,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, my point though is that Sony is a worldwide company, though, and they do release products here in the United States.

257
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:14,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And granted, when they're going to do something like this, thanks to the internet, this image has made it worldwide.

258
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:19,589
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to show up in magazines here, not as an ad, but just the buzz about it.

259
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,072
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sony being a worldwide company who does put out products here.

260
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:25,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, yeah, it's such a wonderful advertising campaign.

261
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:31,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the last one with the really annoying, sketchy squirrels and dust balls that talked about the PSP.

262
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, it made me want to really go out and buy a PSP, just like this one.

263
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:37,365
[SPEAKER_10]: This does not make me want to go out and buy a PSP.

264
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,042
[SPEAKER_10]: They really need to cut off the cancerous PR department of Sony.

265
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:45,104
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the problem stems from.

266
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:49,046
[SPEAKER_10]: People that get to do the advertising are retarded.

267
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:51,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this advertisement is actually okay.

268
00:19:51,987 --> 00:19:53,128
[SPEAKER_06]: It really doesn't bother me.

269
00:19:53,488 --> 00:20:02,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And a couple of my co-workers, when we saw that ad, the first time we just looked at it not very intensely, I didn't even see the black woman there, actually.

270
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:05,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, a white chick advertising the PSP.

271
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:06,455
[SPEAKER_06]: What's racist about that?

272
00:20:07,316 --> 00:20:07,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see it.

273
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:38,679
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's some that are not even really that bad.

274
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:39,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

275
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,901
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you think the media just latched onto this one image and now it's become this big misunderstanding?

276
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:47,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because they have Slow News Week and they really need something to talk about.

277
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:49,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting perspective.

278
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:55,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to the chat room, Funnydale says, Thank God Sony never released the PSP in yellow.

279
00:20:56,565 --> 00:20:56,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh boy.

280
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:58,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I want to say stuff.

281
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,450
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

282
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

283
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,910
[SPEAKER_09]: But I won't.

284
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,411
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

285
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:04,672
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, some striking imagery there.

286
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:09,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely provoking reaction, which I guess an ad campaign is supposed to do.

287
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:10,794
[SPEAKER_09]: But is it ethical?

288
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:11,775
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the question.

289
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:13,975
[SPEAKER_09]: So definitely looking forward to your feedback.

290
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:15,976
[SPEAKER_09]: And we definitely want to get your feedback on this issue.

291
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:19,638
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll tell you a little more information on how you can do that a little later in the program.

292
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:23,399
[SPEAKER_10]: It wouldn't be the first time that they're advertising, you know,

293
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:24,744
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.

294
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:50,088
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

295
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:20,979
[SPEAKER_10]: That, of course, has been fixed and still no official word from Sony about what their PR firm did.

296
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,380
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's still kind of funny seeing an Apple logo on there.

297
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,041
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I don't know.

298
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:35,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Another speculation was that they were using some Apple software, a product called Apple Shake, to create the file.

299
00:22:35,285 --> 00:22:39,567
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were using a beta, not beta, but a demo version that wasn't allowed.

300
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:41,208
[SPEAKER_10]: So it kept a watermark on there.

301
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:42,917
[SPEAKER_09]: That, to me, is incredibly funny.

302
00:22:43,157 --> 00:22:46,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'd read that theory, too, that they were using the trial software.

303
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:46,879
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny.

304
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Sony never steals from anybody.

305
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:49,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Ever.

306
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, look, though.

307
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:51,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

308
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:52,403
[SPEAKER_09]: It's their PR firm.

309
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:54,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it has nothing to do with Sony.

310
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:54,805
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

311
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:58,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's easy to pick on Sony in this day and age after E3, but come on.

312
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:03,210
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you either have Apples or PCs at your place of employment.

313
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Even Sony probably uses these type of computers.

314
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:11,055
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing is, though, is it's actually from, you know, it's from, like,

315
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:14,929
[SPEAKER_10]: An actual flash file from what looks like the iPod side.

316
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:22,635
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, they've disassembled it, taken that part out of the background, which is like the smoke effect, looks like smoke dropping from the ceiling, kind of rolling along the ground stuff.

317
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:29,201
[SPEAKER_10]: And they've taken it out, and just that one section they've isolated, and it's clearly stolen from something.

318
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:31,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe that's just a stock effect in the program.

319
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:34,865
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's something clearly stolen from something else.

320
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:35,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

321
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:37,467
[SPEAKER_10]: So somebody... It's in trouble.

322
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:39,209
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just kind of sloppy.

323
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:40,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

324
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,454
[SPEAKER_10]: It is funny, though.

325
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:47,137
[SPEAKER_10]: People are speculating, oh my god, what if the announcement happens with... No, not going to happen.

326
00:23:48,738 --> 00:24:03,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody in our chat room, TigerClaw, reminded me of something I was supposed to mention earlier during the last story about the ad, is that Control-Alt-Delete, the comic, ran a pretty funny response to the ad that had a skinny white guy and a fat white guy, and it was an ad for the DS Lite.

327
00:24:03,626 --> 00:24:03,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

328
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:04,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

329
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:06,197
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I thought that was pretty funny.

330
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:07,678
[SPEAKER_09]: That's creative marketing.

331
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:09,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's just... It was real.

332
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:10,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a creative response.

333
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,541
[SPEAKER_09]: And a very interesting comic.

334
00:24:14,741 --> 00:24:19,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway... They should get something like a DS on an operating table with, like, a liposuction tube.

335
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:22,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, like, that would be a good advertising campaign.

336
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:25,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, like, a picture of, you know, Oprah when she was big and Oprah when she was skinny.

337
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Or any celebrity this last week.

338
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:29,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, Roseanne.

339
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:30,502
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

340
00:24:30,522 --> 00:24:30,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Goatsy

341
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:52,549
[SPEAKER_09]: You make me sad.

342
00:24:53,689 --> 00:25:05,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Sony and kicking them while they're down, it almost seems like, it looks like Sony has been ordered to pay $243 million in back taxes to the Japanese government.

343
00:25:05,372 --> 00:25:09,453
[SPEAKER_09]: These taxes are related to transactions between the games division and the U.S.

344
00:25:09,513 --> 00:25:14,894
[SPEAKER_09]: subsidiary of the company, as well as overseas transactions relating to CD and DVD making.

345
00:25:15,554 --> 00:25:16,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony had a comment on this.

346
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:21,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony and SCEI believe that their allocation of income for the periods in question was appropriate.

347
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:25,116
[SPEAKER_09]: and they have paid the proper amount of taxes in each of the jurisdictions.

348
00:25:25,877 --> 00:25:28,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, these guys just aren't getting a break this year.

349
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:30,559
[SPEAKER_09]: This is... The bad news keeps on coming.

350
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,240
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like beating a dead hooker over and over and over again.

351
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:36,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Which you could do in one of their games.

352
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:36,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

353
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:39,303
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's also on the Xbox, to be fair.

354
00:25:39,963 --> 00:25:48,327
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, that's not really the bad part about it, but analysts are saying that the PS3 could be third in the next-gen console race, and mainly the...

355
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:58,577
[SPEAKER_10]: The basis of this is that their brand strength is not enough to get people to spend the $600 on their system.

356
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:10,319
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like where you had the PlayStation 2 come out at a better time and for a lot less, whereas that fueled the whole DVD launch.

357
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Nowadays, it's like, do you really need Blu-ray?

358
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean,

359
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:16,771
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

360
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:18,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony believes we do.

361
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:20,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony would like you to think that you need Blu-ray.

362
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:21,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony also thinks we need UMD stuff.

363
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:22,813
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing though.

364
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:25,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, my thought on it is Blu-ray, I don't need it.

365
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:27,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't need HD DVD either.

366
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:32,777
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, not really a fault in Sony for bringing on the Blu-ray.

367
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:34,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you can use that for their games and stuff.

368
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:37,238
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine to have their own proprietary format for the games.

369
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:43,301
[SPEAKER_10]: So even if it doesn't work as a DVD video system or whatever, it'll still work for their games.

370
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:44,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Well,

371
00:26:44,784 --> 00:26:46,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Same goes with HD DVD.

372
00:26:46,345 --> 00:26:47,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I need that either.

373
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:55,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I would benefit from an HD DVD player or even Blu-ray, but when the price is right, that's my issue.

374
00:26:55,213 --> 00:27:04,961
[SPEAKER_06]: My issue with Sony right now is that, like the name for Nintendo's new system, I've gotten almost over the fact that the only model worth getting is the $600 one.

375
00:27:05,321 --> 00:27:10,926
[SPEAKER_06]: They just haven't shown anything that's going to be out anytime soon that looks even remotely interesting.

376
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:13,908
[SPEAKER_10]: I look at the launch list and I'm like, so what?

377
00:27:14,358 --> 00:27:17,499
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact, there was like a game, like for example, I was like, ooh, Full Auto 2.

378
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:23,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, I gotta, you know, that's a really good, you know, I love Full Auto, you know, almost, you know, maybe I should get the system for that.

379
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wait, Full Auto 2's coming out for the Xbox 360 later on.

380
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:28,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well I don't need to get the system then.

381
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:30,680
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, what would they have that's exclusive?

382
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Motorstorm?

383
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Meh, lame.

384
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:35,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they'll have Phantavision 2, and then I'll actually have a reason to do that.

385
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:38,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy XIII.

386
00:27:38,544 --> 00:27:40,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they going to be launched?

387
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:41,065
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but they're great.

388
00:27:41,765 --> 00:27:44,687
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying, you will have to get a PS3 eventually if you want to play this game.

389
00:27:44,707 --> 00:27:45,988
[SPEAKER_09]: When it goes down in price.

390
00:27:46,008 --> 00:27:47,408
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great that Metal Gear Solid 4's coming out.

391
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:49,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox 360's been out a year and hasn't gone down in price.

392
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:56,473
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I don't think that it's going to drop in price anytime soon, and you know, until there's some better games out there, I'm not buying one.

393
00:27:56,873 --> 00:27:57,453
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

394
00:27:57,473 --> 00:27:58,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, whatever.

395
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:58,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

396
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:05,782
[SPEAKER_10]: They could totally pull it out and say, you know, they could have some big secret stuff that they're not talking about and that would be, you know, really amazing.

397
00:28:05,822 --> 00:28:07,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it ain't the Eye of Judgment.

398
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:09,626
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the worst idea.

399
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,607
[SPEAKER_10]: It was that card game, right?

400
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:12,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's the card game.

401
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing about the Eye of Judgment.

402
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,571
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how the hell they're going to execute this.

403
00:28:16,992 --> 00:28:22,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, to be honest, the Eye toy sucks for, you know, that type of gameplay.

404
00:28:22,476 --> 00:28:25,679
[SPEAKER_10]: And the way that they're set up, they have this, like, really elaborate, like,

405
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see how it's going to be possible to do this, even reasonably why you would want to do this in the first place.

406
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:41,463
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a great idea as a proof of concept thing, but as a game, I don't see it happening.

407
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:43,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't get how they're going to do it.

408
00:28:43,283 --> 00:28:44,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Chatroom wanted to correct me on something.

409
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:53,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox 360 has actually only been out nine months, not a year, but the price isn't going to drop by November either, as far as we know.

410
00:28:53,886 --> 00:28:55,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I still stand by what I said.

411
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:55,846
[SPEAKER_06]: It still can...

412
00:28:56,964 --> 00:29:00,388
[SPEAKER_09]: The only reason it would have had to is if PS3 announced it was coming out for $499.

413
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Or $399, whatever the Xbox reason is.

414
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:07,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they're not going to drop the price of the 360.

415
00:29:07,617 --> 00:29:13,504
[SPEAKER_10]: If anything, they may drop it later, like once first quarter comes around next year.

416
00:29:14,145 --> 00:29:16,888
[SPEAKER_10]: But they might drop the price of the Xbox.

417
00:29:18,343 --> 00:29:20,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Banda makes an interesting comment in our chat room.

418
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:24,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a PS3 for the games too, but Sony doesn't want to make a console just for games.

419
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:31,288
[SPEAKER_09]: If it weren't for that damn Blu-ray crap, I like... PS3 is going to be sold more as your living room centerpiece.

420
00:29:31,308 --> 00:29:35,650
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your movie, game, internet, picture, I don't know, system.

421
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that's going to win Sony any points from people?

422
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,892
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at all.

423
00:29:40,952 --> 00:29:41,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the thing.

424
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:45,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a PSP as well, and what do I use it for?

425
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:46,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I use it for games.

426
00:29:46,634 --> 00:29:46,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't...

427
00:29:47,974 --> 00:29:48,955
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any pictures on it.

428
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:51,017
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any movies on it.

429
00:29:51,178 --> 00:29:57,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, but I've heard from listeners who download our show on their PSP, and we have the PSP websites, which are pretty kick-butt.

430
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:00,767
[SPEAKER_09]: So some people out there are getting used to some of the other functions of the PSP.

431
00:30:01,448 --> 00:30:02,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the web stuff on the PSP.

432
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:05,792
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's funny, too, about the whole PS3 thing?

433
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:08,054
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still floating around out there that they're saying that

434
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,782
[SPEAKER_10]: It's possible that Sony may do that thing to eliminate used game sales.

435
00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:16,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't buy it.

436
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:25,071
[SPEAKER_10]: They're trying to push for digital distribution, and I really think they're trying it out with this PSP emulation thing.

437
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:30,776
[SPEAKER_10]: If it works well for that, they're going to move it to... I bet you that's probably going to be on the PS3 when that comes out.

438
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:32,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's keep it moving here.

439
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,079
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk about this on the PSP.

440
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:36,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is actually a pretty cool idea here.

441
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:40,044
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a story that ran on Kotaku.

442
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:51,193
[SPEAKER_09]: A graduate student, Jonas Heilscher, put together this interesting piece that he put on YouTube that is this game where you go around and you're looking for access points.

443
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:59,980
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you collect the access points, you get a distinct color, shape, or sound based based on whatever that MAC address is of the point that you find.

444
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:06,217
[SPEAKER_09]: and what you do is you fill this three by three grid with shapes trying to get three in a row as you find the points.

445
00:31:06,717 --> 00:31:12,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if you ever get an unsecure access point though, it might wipe the grid clean or act as a wild card.

446
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:19,024
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically the game encourages you to get out and walk, which I think is a neat idea.

447
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:22,006
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's kind of a cool concept for a game.

448
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,447
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's nothing that

449
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:26,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think would ever be sold, but it was a cute tech demo idea.

450
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:30,237
[SPEAKER_09]: That reminds me of when they were going to release a GPS thing.

451
00:31:30,437 --> 00:31:31,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, geocaching.

452
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:32,158
[SPEAKER_09]: It made me think of that too.

453
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:34,780
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a great idea for the PSP.

454
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be a lot of fun.

455
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:43,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine, this might sound really cheesy, but take one of those TV shows like Treasure Hunters, The Game, or something that could rely on geocaching.

456
00:31:44,127 --> 00:31:49,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that you would really travel around the world for real, but maybe something that interacts with the geocache to kind of

457
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:55,491
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, encourage people to go outside and use their PSPs and kind of interact in a whole different way.

458
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:56,851
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be a neat idea.

459
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:58,231
[SPEAKER_06]: But the screen sucks outside.

460
00:31:59,071 --> 00:31:59,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.

461
00:31:59,532 --> 00:32:00,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's a good point.

462
00:32:00,812 --> 00:32:02,552
[SPEAKER_10]: The LCD screens really do suck.

463
00:32:02,612 --> 00:32:04,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't you get something, though, that kind of helps that?

464
00:32:04,593 --> 00:32:08,034
[SPEAKER_10]: An umbrella?

465
00:32:08,054 --> 00:32:11,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you design the lights, lighting and everything correctly, it might work okay.

466
00:32:13,835 --> 00:32:18,337
[SPEAKER_09]: It does require firmware 2.0 to play and they do plan on putting it on their site in the near future.

467
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:18,957
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Pixel 6

468
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:20,940
[SPEAKER_09]: So check it out.

469
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,180
[SPEAKER_09]: The name of the game is Collectic.

470
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,641
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's actually pretty cool.

471
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:35,225
[SPEAKER_10]: And kind of back to what we were talking about before, both Sega and Ubisoft want the PS3 to drop in price.

472
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:49,311
[SPEAKER_10]: They're basically saying that it's too expensive and they're worried that because it is so expensive that it might not be competitive enough with the Xbox 360 and not as many units may sell

473
00:32:50,032 --> 00:33:04,607
[SPEAKER_10]: and of course that affects them especially when they're releasing games on those consoles because they're unable to make as many or sell as many on that system so you know that's kind of a I think that's a shared sentiment from everybody that they want the price to drop but

474
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:15,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't crazy Sony guy, I forget his name, Kaz Harai or whatever, didn't he say that he's not even guaranteeing that the price of games would be $59.99 or whatever?

475
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:17,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he said it could be more.

476
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:22,129
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be, but that's not a good way to sell your console.

477
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:25,230
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a console, it's a media center.

478
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:26,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

479
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:29,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so, interesting.

480
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:30,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

481
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,221
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's switch consoles for a minute here.

482
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go over and talk about the Nintendo Wii.

483
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:36,964
[SPEAKER_09]: This shouldn't be a surprise to anybody.

484
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:41,988
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people like to joke about the power brick that comes with the Xbox 360 because that thing is huge.

485
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:50,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, pictures have leaked of the Wii's power supply, and it's not so big, but it's about the size of the GameCube power supply.

486
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:53,196
[SPEAKER_09]: But honestly, is this a huge surprise considering that

487
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,542
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't be surprised if it was running on the same power supply as the GameCube.

488
00:33:57,562 --> 00:33:58,102
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just like the...

489
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:17,830
[SPEAKER_10]: The PlayStation 2, how you can use all the audio cables and video cables with the PlayStation 1.

490
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh hell, those Nintendo cables you can use.

491
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:24,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the same cables for Super Nintendo all the way through GameCube.

492
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,322
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use that same AV thing.

493
00:34:27,323 --> 00:34:28,084
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

494
00:34:28,104 --> 00:34:29,226
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the way to do it, I think.

495
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:31,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, it's just an AV cable.

496
00:34:32,252 --> 00:34:34,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that kind of technology doesn't change.

497
00:34:34,355 --> 00:34:46,773
[SPEAKER_09]: But what is interesting is even though we know that the Wii is not going to support high def 720 or whatever, maybe they'll still release, you know, red, green, blue.

498
00:34:47,281 --> 00:34:47,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Progressive?

499
00:34:49,242 --> 00:34:49,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Component?

500
00:34:49,603 --> 00:34:50,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it, thank you.

501
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:50,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Component.

502
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll still release component cables.

503
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't GameCube for a little while have component cables?

504
00:34:55,147 --> 00:34:56,428
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just really hard to come by now.

505
00:34:56,448 --> 00:34:59,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Even on the Xbox, remember the Xbox, some of the games were actually 720p.

506
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Very few, but yeah.

507
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:14,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Very few, but still, I mean, I would like to see, you know, sure their focus is not going to be high def, but if someone wants to do a high def game to maybe allow some way to do that, I think that would be kind of cool.

508
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:15,842
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

509
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:21,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I remember some of the games for the GameCube were progressive scan as well.

510
00:35:22,684 --> 00:35:27,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you had a few that were widescreen at least, like F-Zero is pretty kick-ass.

511
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I don't know.

512
00:35:29,886 --> 00:35:35,228
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not because I don't have component cables for the GameCube because they're so freaking hard to find.

513
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:36,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I still don't have them.

514
00:35:36,088 --> 00:35:38,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a digital out on the GameCube, but I just don't have those cables.

515
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:44,351
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, F-Zero just doesn't look as good as, you know,

516
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:47,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Even an Xbox game that did have the component cables.

517
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

518
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, speaking of Nintendo, there was announcements made about their brand new line of games that's going to be coming out.

519
00:35:56,943 --> 00:36:04,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like the Touch Generations, whereas those were not really games per se, but more of kind of

520
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:08,461
[SPEAKER_10]: for everybody type stuff, you know, or Nintendogs and Brain Training, etc.

521
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:14,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now they have a brand new lineup called Bit Generations, and these actually look pretty sweet.

522
00:36:15,445 --> 00:36:26,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Included in that are going to be, you know, puzzle and rhythm games designed for the Game Boy Advance, including DotStream, Boldish, Dialhex,

523
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:46,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Digidrive, Orbital, Colorist, and Sound Voyager and they're all really simple looking games but they all look really cool actually and pretty fun to play and they're going to be for about $25 in American and will ship in the second and fourth weeks in July in Japan

524
00:36:48,152 --> 00:36:49,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other new games are coming out for the DS.

525
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:51,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just the DS, but the PSP.

526
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:54,997
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're coming from one of my favorite developers, Q Entertainment.

527
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:56,758
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I love Luminous and Meteos.

528
00:36:56,778 --> 00:36:58,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are two of my favorite games that came out last year.

529
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there are new games coming out.

530
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:02,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not talking about Luminous 2 or Every Extend Extra.

531
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:03,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about some other stuff.

532
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:10,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Famitsu Magazine is reporting that Bandai Namco is going to be publishing two new Q Entertainment games.

533
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:13,190
[SPEAKER_09]: One is going to be out for the PSP, and it's called Gun P.R.

534
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,651
[SPEAKER_09]: It's short for Gun P. Reverse.

535
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:20,274
[SPEAKER_09]: And the DS is going to get a game that translates to the name Connect the Sounds, Gun P. Reverse.

536
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:26,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Both are music-based puzzle games, and they're based on a 1999 WonderSwan game called Gun P.,

537
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:40,209
[SPEAKER_09]: too bad Jamie's not here because she'd probably actually know that one because I never owned a Wonderswan but she did oh no, duh, I mean I do have a Wonderswan thanks to a gracious listener but I have one game for it I don't really play a lot of Wonderswan games maybe I should check this one out though

538
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:49,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, for those that haven't played it, it's got square pieces and they all have a diagonal line and it rises from the bottom of the screen to the top.

539
00:37:49,229 --> 00:37:53,931
[SPEAKER_09]: You move the pieces up and down, trying to get a line going from left to right.

540
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:56,372
[SPEAKER_09]: The panels will then disappear if you do this.

541
00:37:56,952 --> 00:38:00,293
[SPEAKER_09]: The game ends early if the pieces get to the top of the field.

542
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:07,016
[SPEAKER_09]: On the PSP version, there'll be emphasis on music and video, kind of like Luminous, how it had skins.

543
00:38:07,595 --> 00:38:14,478
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the DS, it's going to be more stylus emphasized as opposed to having the skins.

544
00:38:14,518 --> 00:38:20,020
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the game will still make sounds when you clear panel, and it'll try to line up the sounds with the background music.

545
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,541
[SPEAKER_09]: So that should be interesting.

546
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:23,922
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds a lot like that game.

547
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,303
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a PopCap game.

548
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,224
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the fireworks.

549
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,945
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a festival game with the fireworks.

550
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:31,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even remember the name of it now.

551
00:38:32,846 --> 00:38:33,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure someone chatted.

552
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:34,186
[SPEAKER_09]: No idea.

553
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:35,327
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure someone chatted.

554
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,101
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little different though.

555
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:40,043
[SPEAKER_09]: You turn these, but you're trying to line things up from left to right.

556
00:38:40,063 --> 00:38:42,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you do that, these fireworks go off and you get points.

557
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,386
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a cheesy game.

558
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:49,289
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be a cool game for our latest Nintendo DS owner here.

559
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:57,034
[SPEAKER_10]: President Bush was actually given a Nintendo DS and brain training for his 60th birthday.

560
00:38:57,094 --> 00:38:58,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder what Nintendo's trying to tell him.

561
00:38:58,595 --> 00:38:59,415
[SPEAKER_10]: That he's stupid.

562
00:39:01,096 --> 00:39:07,061
[SPEAKER_10]: And they attach the letter to it and says, Don't worry, turning 60 is an exciting milestone.

563
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:13,967
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, you've joined the millions of other baby boomers in an invigorating new decade of your life.

564
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:18,070
[SPEAKER_10]: And like many boomers, you may be looking for ways to keep your mind sharp.

565
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:19,512
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where we come in.

566
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:25,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Please accept our gift of a new Nintendo DS Lite and a copy of Brain Age.

567
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Train your brain in minutes a day.

568
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:29,440
[SPEAKER_09]: And what do you think actually ended up happening to that?

569
00:39:30,189 --> 00:39:30,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

570
00:39:39,141 --> 00:39:39,641
[SPEAKER_09]: He might.

571
00:39:40,162 --> 00:39:44,404
[SPEAKER_09]: He's, you know, a normal guy despite, you know, the fact I disagree with the politics or whatever.

572
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:45,205
[SPEAKER_09]: He seems to be a normal guy.

573
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:46,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he has a lot of time off.

574
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:47,086
[SPEAKER_10]: So he has a lot of time off.

575
00:39:47,206 --> 00:39:48,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he'll check it out.

576
00:39:48,107 --> 00:39:49,828
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, something to do on Air Force One.

577
00:39:49,868 --> 00:39:50,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

578
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,109
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

579
00:39:51,129 --> 00:39:51,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

580
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,491
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually a super secret spy device to find out what's going on.

581
00:39:54,531 --> 00:39:59,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Jeremy Todd 1 in our chat room seems to think President Bush probably won't even be able to turn the damn DS light on.

582
00:39:59,214 --> 00:40:00,775
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

583
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:01,595
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are harsh.

584
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:03,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get these fangled computer things.

585
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:04,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

586
00:40:05,979 --> 00:40:06,820
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

587
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if you are craving for some new games, we have some release dates for you.

588
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:11,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to start it off.

589
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:16,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Jamie's not here tonight, but I don't want to neglect the UK audience because we have some awesome UK listeners.

590
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:21,374
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think next year, I know I keep saying I want to go to Australia, but I'm torn.

591
00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:23,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I either want to go to Australia or I want to go to UK.

592
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:23,596
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the two.

593
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:26,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll probably do one next year and then one the year after that.

594
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:27,940
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's assuming I'm rich.

595
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:29,974
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

596
00:40:30,015 --> 00:40:33,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, here's some release dates here for the UK.

597
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:43,108
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys have coming out on the 14th, you have Cars coming out on some various platforms, everything from GameCube, PS2, and Xbox, all the way to the PC and portable platforms as well.

598
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:46,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Pirates of the Caribbean, The Legend of Jack Sparrow

599
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,021
[SPEAKER_09]: on the Xbox 360.

600
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:16,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking ahead a little bit to the week of the 21st, you guys are getting in the UK, Def Jam Fight for New York, The Takeover on the PSP, Infected on the PSP, and Field Commander on the PSP from Ubisoft.

601
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:19,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Also coming out for the PlayStation 2, World Super Police.

602
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Big week next week in the UK for Sony.

603
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of stuff for the US too, especially if you have a 360.

604
00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:27,911
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to be getting Prey, of course.

605
00:41:28,812 --> 00:41:29,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome game.

606
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:31,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Chromehounds, also on the 360.

607
00:41:31,093 --> 00:41:40,681
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally, if you don't have a 360, they have Sprint Cars or the Knoxville, which is, I don't know, a game you probably won't want to pick up.

608
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:44,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, the following week, you've got lots of stuff.

609
00:41:44,864 --> 00:41:48,167
[SPEAKER_10]: NCAA Football 2007, of course, on PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PSP.

610
00:41:51,493 --> 00:41:57,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Monster House, Super Dragon Ball Z, Painkiller, Zen-Eyed I don't know, just kind of one of the Japanese shooter games.

611
00:41:57,276 --> 00:41:59,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like Raiden 3 or something.

612
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:23,049
[SPEAKER_10]: XBOX 360 Faceplates

613
00:42:41,573 --> 00:42:43,254
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, it's just Halo graphics with a number 3 on it.

614
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Viva Piñata I hate that franchise

615
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:34,516
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like the snakes on the plane thing for me.

616
00:43:35,597 --> 00:43:48,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, there was a new Wii game announced, and I don't know if you're going to be excited by this, because I played the PlayStation 2 version of it, and I didn't like it too much, but Rampage World Tour, or Total Destruction, I mean.

617
00:43:48,572 --> 00:43:49,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Where'd you hear that?

618
00:43:49,313 --> 00:43:49,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that another thing?

619
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:51,335
[SPEAKER_10]: It's through my work, yeah.

620
00:43:51,355 --> 00:43:51,996
[SPEAKER_09]: That seems like a...

621
00:43:52,643 --> 00:44:01,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Odd release, you're right, that game seems a little dated Rampage Total Destruction is going to be coming out on the Wii It's going to be $29.99 Are they going to enhance it at all, you think?

622
00:44:01,947 --> 00:44:21,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not, not for $29.99 It's supposed to be out in December I don't know, I didn't like the PlayStation 2 game I thought that it was very unbalanced and just not very fun to play But hey, you know what, it's just another game for us So expect that out in December Any other release date news?

623
00:44:23,134 --> 00:44:25,636
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's all I've got that's brand new.

624
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:29,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of PS3 games coming, that's for sure.

625
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it looks like we're getting a call on the Skype line.

626
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the Skype line and see who's there.

627
00:44:34,345 --> 00:44:34,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:36,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello!

00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:37,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Jamie, is that you?

630
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:38,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

631
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:39,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are you at?

632
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,171
[SPEAKER_03]: San Jose.

633
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:41,952
[SPEAKER_09]: San Jose.

634
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:43,093
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on in San Jose today?

635
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:50,757
[SPEAKER_03]: California Extreme, it's a big coin-op and pinball convention thing.

636
00:44:50,817 --> 00:44:56,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the husband kidnapped me, but I figured it's good stuff for Orange Lounge.

637
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much old games, new games.

638
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,691
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Mambo, a Go-Go.

639
00:45:05,271 --> 00:45:07,832
[SPEAKER_03]: They have actually Hip Hop Mania 2.

640
00:45:08,512 --> 00:45:10,112
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of DDRs.

641
00:45:10,452 --> 00:45:13,333
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of prototype pinballs that I got to play.

642
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:19,274
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is Kingpin and the other one is Big Bang Bar, which our old listeners will know that I've been into that one for a while.

643
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,015
[SPEAKER_09]: What exactly do they do at this show?

644
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:25,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this just everybody brings their games out and people play them or is it trying to sell machines or what are they doing there?

645
00:45:26,383 --> 00:45:28,985
[SPEAKER_03]: You bring three games, you're in as an exhibitor, you get in for free.

646
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:33,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, you pay a decent amount to get in.

647
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:36,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we paid $30 each just for Saturday.

648
00:45:37,432 --> 00:45:37,872
[SPEAKER_09]: And what do they do?

649
00:45:37,892 --> 00:45:39,033
[SPEAKER_09]: They just let you play games all day?

650
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:40,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

651
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:44,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's other little panels going on and different things like that.

652
00:45:44,497 --> 00:45:47,079
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, I'm just following all the games around.

653
00:45:47,139 --> 00:45:52,143
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have a marquee for a Hercules game, which was Atari's biggest pinball machine.

654
00:45:52,163 --> 00:45:52,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

655
00:45:53,624 --> 00:45:56,445
[SPEAKER_09]: What are some interesting games that you've actually got a chance to play today?

656
00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:58,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Bang Bar.

657
00:45:58,946 --> 00:46:04,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got my butt handed to me on Black Knight 2000, which is one of my favorite machines ever.

658
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:08,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan played Arabian Nights, which I thought was pretty cool.

659
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:15,433
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got like a genie and you hit the lamp and it turns around and you get a different score and everything.

660
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did play some Beatmania.

661
00:46:18,895 --> 00:46:19,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't help myself.

662
00:46:21,218 --> 00:46:27,040
[SPEAKER_03]: and I mainly was just walking around taking pictures for the first part of it, but I'm actually going to go back in and play things.

663
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,281
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few things I want to try.

664
00:46:28,681 --> 00:46:29,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

665
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:30,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Are the pictures going to go on the website later this week?

666
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,443
[SPEAKER_03]: They absolutely will.

667
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I also do have some video footage of some of the more rare games, too.

668
00:46:35,684 --> 00:46:36,684
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a tapper there.

669
00:46:37,645 --> 00:46:39,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, like root beer tapper?

670
00:46:39,705 --> 00:46:40,246
[SPEAKER_03]: No, tapper.

671
00:46:40,906 --> 00:46:42,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Budweiser tapper?

672
00:46:42,727 --> 00:46:43,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Like beer.

673
00:46:43,646 --> 00:46:45,928
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome, because I love Budweiser, Tapper.

674
00:46:46,148 --> 00:46:48,529
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a Poo-Yan machine.

675
00:46:48,549 --> 00:46:50,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I remember Poo-Yan.

676
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:52,032
[SPEAKER_03]: A long time.

677
00:46:52,432 --> 00:46:54,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, yeah, I had that on the Commodore 64.

678
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:55,054
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

679
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:58,556
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have the Ultra Kade cocktail machines.

680
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, like to sit down and play?

681
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:02,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, the bar top.

682
00:47:03,117 --> 00:47:06,298
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a few of the tables.

683
00:47:06,778 --> 00:47:15,022
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have the little boxing game, which is like you look down inside of it and you're seeing from the top view of two boxers.

684
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:16,782
[SPEAKER_03]: They also actually have the mechanical boxing game.

685
00:47:18,623 --> 00:47:20,644
[SPEAKER_09]: So what else are you going to get accomplished today while you're there?

686
00:47:21,924 --> 00:47:33,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play a lot more Black Knight 2000 and a lot more Big Bang Bar and hopefully I can run into some of the people who own these machines and ask them about their maintenance and what they've gone into them.

687
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:35,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this something they do every year?

688
00:47:36,073 --> 00:47:37,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they do this every year.

689
00:47:37,334 --> 00:47:49,161
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, last year, not last year, but the year before that, we tried to go to Classic Gaming Expo and it was really, really slow because this had just finished the week before and nobody wanted to bring their machines back.

690
00:47:50,422 --> 00:47:50,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, interesting.

691
00:47:51,162 --> 00:47:54,223
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've got a lot of stuff from classic stuff to new stuff.

692
00:47:54,243 --> 00:47:55,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see a lot of new stuff there?

693
00:47:56,843 --> 00:47:58,023
[SPEAKER_03]: There's The Grid.

694
00:47:58,623 --> 00:47:59,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It was there.

695
00:48:00,404 --> 00:48:02,264
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR, like it was a DDR Extreme.

696
00:48:02,284 --> 00:48:03,064
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Solo.

697
00:48:03,144 --> 00:48:04,404
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a Mambo Go Go.

698
00:48:04,604 --> 00:48:09,225
[SPEAKER_09]: But nothing like super new, like Soul Calibur 3 Arcade or anything?

699
00:48:09,245 --> 00:48:10,405
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have anything super new there?

700
00:48:11,446 --> 00:48:14,306
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nothing like really, really, really new.

701
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:17,927
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a Super Scope, not Super Scope, Silent Scope EX.

702
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:18,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh.

703
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:19,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

704
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:29,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a few of the newer machines that most of it's like late 80s, early 90s.

705
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:33,270
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few pens from the 40s and 50s.

706
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:37,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So is this something where people go to buy machines from private collectors?

707
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:40,515
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't something where they're selling to arcades.

708
00:48:40,535 --> 00:48:44,137
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something where they're selling to hardcore collectors with lots of money, right?

709
00:48:44,687 --> 00:48:45,687
[SPEAKER_03]: They're selling to collectors.

710
00:48:45,948 --> 00:48:50,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And not everything is really expensive, but that Hip Hop Mania machine I was playing, $400.

711
00:48:52,351 --> 00:48:54,692
[SPEAKER_03]: In great condition, much better than Golf Lens ever was.

712
00:48:54,892 --> 00:48:55,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

713
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:56,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, cool.

714
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:57,633
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you going to buy anything?

715
00:48:57,693 --> 00:48:59,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you and Dan coming back with anything?

716
00:49:00,114 --> 00:49:00,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Joke's Back and Forth

717
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:24,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

718
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:25,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

719
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:25,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

720
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:26,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

721
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:28,232
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it was a big deal for me to play one.

722
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:30,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to share about the show with the listeners and anything?

723
00:49:31,653 --> 00:49:32,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still going tomorrow.

724
00:49:32,753 --> 00:49:35,153
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone's in the Bay Area or nearby, come check it out.

725
00:49:35,433 --> 00:49:35,893
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth it.

726
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:37,034
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

727
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:37,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

728
00:49:37,654 --> 00:49:39,014
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's the name of the show again?

729
00:49:39,034 --> 00:49:39,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have a website?

730
00:49:40,634 --> 00:49:41,795
[SPEAKER_03]: California Extreme.

731
00:49:41,835 --> 00:49:44,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you can just do a Google hunt for it.

732
00:49:45,055 --> 00:49:48,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's caextreme.com, I think, or .org.

733
00:49:48,356 --> 00:49:48,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

734
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:49,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

735
00:49:50,056 --> 00:49:50,336
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

736
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:51,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thanks for calling in.

737
00:49:51,897 --> 00:49:53,457
[SPEAKER_09]: We miss you, and we'll see you next week, okay?

738
00:49:54,721 --> 00:49:55,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, later!

739
00:50:28,865 --> 00:50:29,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you start us off, Loki?

740
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:34,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you, the stupid people who can't park correctly.

741
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:42,518
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry this also kind of goes to Christopher, he parked like a bitch, taking up two goddamn spaces with his car.

742
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:48,964
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw a woman last night driving a stupid minivan, parks in like four spaces, and just walks right out.

743
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:51,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Dumb bitches from Alaska, though.

744
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:52,344
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that makes a difference.

745
00:50:52,364 --> 00:50:52,904
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't.

746
00:50:53,044 --> 00:50:56,145
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, still I kind of stare at her like, you're an idiot.

747
00:50:56,245 --> 00:50:56,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Goddamn.

748
00:50:56,906 --> 00:51:05,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I understand there's not a lot of people in the parking lot, but when you take up four spaces because you're too fucking lazy to park correctly, I hate people like that.

749
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:08,490
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry it always seems to be, you know, women in cars.

750
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:14,472
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, you get, you know, punk-ass bitches who drive their fucking giant trucks that take up six spaces, too.

751
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the ones that park with the goddamn, you know...

752
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:23,746
[SPEAKER_10]: U-Haul or some sort of trailer on there and they take up six spaces because they park, you know, across all of them.

753
00:51:24,026 --> 00:51:24,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you.

754
00:51:25,187 --> 00:51:29,049
[SPEAKER_10]: You do not need to be going to the movies if you have a goddamn trailer on your truck.

755
00:51:29,149 --> 00:51:30,970
[SPEAKER_10]: So just leave it at home.

756
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to give an F you for what I believe is the second week in a row to the sun.

757
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:39,154
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember last week on the show I had a sunburn.

758
00:51:39,194 --> 00:51:39,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, guess what?

759
00:51:39,654 --> 00:51:42,456
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was in Canada, I went to Canada with my best friend.

760
00:51:42,476 --> 00:51:44,817
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I was on vacation while I wasn't here on Sunday.

761
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,837
[SPEAKER_09]: and we decided one day randomly we were just going to walk.

762
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:52,478
[SPEAKER_09]: We were going to walk across this bridge, Berard Bridge, because somebody had told us it was fun.

763
00:51:52,498 --> 00:51:55,879
[SPEAKER_09]: So we walked across, ate some lunch, and we walked back and we were like, let's just keep on walking.

764
00:51:56,339 --> 00:52:05,982
[SPEAKER_09]: So we walked all the way to this place called Stanley Park, which is this huge park in Vancouver that's bigger than Central Park, and we walked the entire perimeter of Stanley Park.

765
00:52:06,442 --> 00:52:12,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this whole time I'm worried that I might get a sunburn again, so I'm asking my friend John, I'm like, do I have, am I turning colors, am I turning pink?

766
00:52:12,204 --> 00:52:13,424
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, no, you look fine, you look fine.

767
00:52:13,871 --> 00:52:18,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we get back to the hotel after this walk, which, you know, the perimeter of Stanley Park is 10 kilometers.

768
00:52:19,155 --> 00:52:20,857
[SPEAKER_09]: So add into that all the other walking we did.

769
00:52:20,877 --> 00:52:23,579
[SPEAKER_09]: We probably walked more like 10 miles by the time all is said and done.

770
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we get back to the hotel room, and I'm bright pink.

771
00:52:27,002 --> 00:52:28,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, John, I'm bright pink.

772
00:52:28,443 --> 00:52:29,504
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, you didn't look pink earlier.

773
00:52:29,544 --> 00:52:31,105
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm getting redder and redder and redder.

774
00:52:31,926 --> 00:52:34,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I had the world's worst summer, and it was horrible.

775
00:52:34,948 --> 00:52:39,052
[SPEAKER_09]: But, and I know this isn't more of an F you, but I will say a big thank you.

776
00:52:39,813 --> 00:52:50,656
[SPEAKER_09]: to Canada's pharmacies because they sell certain drugs in Canada you can't get here in the US and one of them is aloe vera gel with lidocaine in it which is like numbing stuff that you have to get with prescription here.

777
00:52:50,716 --> 00:52:55,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Made my sunburn feel much more bearable but still I had to miss Saturday night clubbing so I was upset with that.

778
00:52:56,078 --> 00:52:57,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise I love Canada.

779
00:52:57,818 --> 00:52:58,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

780
00:52:58,598 --> 00:53:03,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Vancouver and I want to go back and yeah but I wish I just had more money to travel.

781
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'll just move there.

782
00:53:05,681 --> 00:53:07,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll ditch this show and move to Canada.

783
00:53:08,507 --> 00:53:09,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane, do you have any angst you want to get out?

784
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:13,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no.

785
00:53:14,789 --> 00:53:17,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'm angry about anything right now.

786
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

787
00:53:20,851 --> 00:53:22,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Well then F you for not being angsty.

788
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:25,632
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to me for not being angsty.

789
00:53:25,872 --> 00:53:26,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

790
00:53:26,512 --> 00:53:27,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray.

791
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:31,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on with some more news back into the gaming news.

792
00:53:31,694 --> 00:53:36,595
[SPEAKER_09]: The Final Fantasy 3 DS Wi-Fi feature may have been revealed and it's

793
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:38,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

794
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:04,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Adventure the World with Friends or something a little more.

795
00:54:04,812 --> 00:54:12,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, now to be fair, maybe this is just one element and there's more to come, but if this is it, it's kind of weak.

796
00:54:13,175 --> 00:54:14,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I guess it's better than nothing.

797
00:54:15,176 --> 00:54:17,637
[SPEAKER_09]: It's better than nothing, but it's a little weak.

798
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:18,898
[SPEAKER_09]: A little lame.

799
00:54:20,178 --> 00:54:20,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll still buy it, though.

800
00:54:20,938 --> 00:54:21,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong.

801
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:21,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll still buy it.

802
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:22,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm all over that game.

803
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:26,160
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to have another game for instant messaging and another game that you have to pop in.

804
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,721
[SPEAKER_10]: You're all, okay, I've got to email my friend.

805
00:54:28,157 --> 00:54:29,138
[SPEAKER_10]: in Final Fantasy 3.

806
00:54:29,298 --> 00:54:33,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I got to chat with him using Metroid Prime Hunters.

807
00:54:33,641 --> 00:54:35,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I got to... No.

808
00:54:37,064 --> 00:54:37,584
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of lame.

809
00:54:38,325 --> 00:54:42,127
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, kind of on a little bit of a different topic here.

810
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:48,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Square Enix's president was interviewed by IGN here.

811
00:54:49,313 --> 00:54:51,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Or they have the interview on IGN, I should say.

812
00:54:52,072 --> 00:55:03,618
[SPEAKER_10]: and he was talking about basically different things, online gaming, kind of where he sees things going and a little bit about testing their games before they go out, for example.

813
00:55:04,278 --> 00:55:14,224
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things he says is because of the way that they have the systems now where you can patch them later on, extensive testing is not needed to release a game.

814
00:55:15,404 --> 00:55:20,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully that's not a trend we're going to start seeing where these games go out like, yeah, it's okay, I'll fix it later.

815
00:55:21,482 --> 00:55:22,283
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter if it doesn't work.

816
00:55:22,303 --> 00:55:23,864
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be out of a job, Miklatov.

817
00:55:25,165 --> 00:55:25,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

818
00:55:25,846 --> 00:55:29,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because if they don't need testing on the games, they're just going to patch everything.

819
00:55:29,569 --> 00:55:31,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't tested a game in forever.

820
00:55:31,931 --> 00:55:33,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're moving on up the corporate ladder now, huh?

821
00:55:33,533 --> 00:55:34,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm going up the corporate ladder.

822
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:35,955
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can't talk about what you do, huh?

823
00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:36,515
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I can't.

824
00:55:36,535 --> 00:55:36,896
[SPEAKER_09]: It's lame.

825
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:43,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, the quote here is that game makers have until now incurred great costs during development for debugging.

826
00:55:43,822 --> 00:55:47,345
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, basically, perhaps we can reduce the cost.

827
00:55:48,494 --> 00:55:55,018
[SPEAKER_10]: and suggest that the availability of software updates, developers won't have to work so hard to find the zaniest bugs.

828
00:55:56,419 --> 00:56:02,162
[SPEAKER_10]: And Wada didn't use the word patch strictly, but, you know, that's what his translator said.

829
00:56:02,222 --> 00:56:07,345
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm all for patching games to fix bugs, but at the same time, don't use that as a crutch.

830
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if your game has a

831
00:56:08,971 --> 00:56:10,452
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, crippling bug in it.

832
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,293
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't release it out there and crash people's systems.

833
00:56:13,593 --> 00:56:18,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you remember, like, wasn't there bugs in some Sony game that would, like, fry your memory card or something like that?

834
00:56:18,395 --> 00:56:19,195
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of them.

835
00:56:19,415 --> 00:56:21,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, you can't... That's not cool.

836
00:56:22,137 --> 00:56:23,297
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't just patch that.

837
00:56:23,337 --> 00:56:28,599
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta get that out in the testing process and make sure that, you know, you're not gonna release a game that's gonna fry my memory card.

838
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:30,560
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand, like, some things are a little different.

839
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, the duping glitch in Oblivion.

840
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:36,523
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, obviously, that's something that they couldn't have...

841
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Found, you know, without really going through there.

842
00:56:39,846 --> 00:56:45,472
[SPEAKER_10]: And no one's saying that the games have to be perfect, but like, for example, the Jaws game that came out that was super duper glitchy.

843
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:50,924
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, something like that where they can go back and they need to really fix before it goes out.

844
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:56,588
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you find, like, a bug or an exploit, and even still, I say with the Oblivion exploit, leave it in there.

845
00:56:56,628 --> 00:56:57,969
[SPEAKER_10]: That's your own, you know, bug.

846
00:56:58,009 --> 00:56:59,330
[SPEAKER_10]: And if people want to use it, great.

847
00:56:59,350 --> 00:56:59,830
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll use it.

848
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:02,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, it's not really hurting anything.

849
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:05,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Minkletop, you're saying more things in chat than you're saying on this show.

850
00:57:05,514 --> 00:57:06,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Share your opinion here.

851
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:10,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, my opinion is that, you know, buggy games come out all the time.

852
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:12,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not like...

853
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:15,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because they're saying, oh, we'll release updates for them.

854
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,511
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like they're going to quit finding bugs or anything.

855
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:26,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like testing is going to stop because they have this new way to fix bugs that accidentally get shipped.

856
00:57:26,537 --> 00:57:29,480
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like you're going to get a really crappy game.

857
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you are going to get a really crappy game from somebody, I'm sure.

858
00:57:32,662 --> 00:57:38,607
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not like you're going to get one that hasn't been tested at all and there's going to be tons and tons of bugs.

859
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:42,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Just some things happen to fall through the system sometimes.

860
00:57:44,634 --> 00:57:45,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

861
00:57:45,134 --> 00:57:46,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the demo disc, yeah, for Beautiful Joe 2.

862
00:57:47,915 --> 00:57:49,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was really terrible.

863
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that one of the culprits?

864
00:57:51,216 --> 00:57:53,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that erased your memory card.

865
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:54,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, okay, I remember that.

866
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:58,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I said I never played it, thankfully, or I might have been a little upset.

867
00:57:59,939 --> 00:58:00,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

868
00:58:00,928 --> 00:58:07,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, you might know that the Xbox 360 had this huge shortage problem when it first came out.

869
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:19,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's being reported that ATI and Silicon Integrated Systems have said that orders for their chips used in the Wii and the Xbox 360 are picking up in preparation for the holiday season.

870
00:58:19,697 --> 00:58:24,019
[SPEAKER_09]: So it looks like, especially hearing that the Wii's on there is a good sign.

871
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:29,402
[SPEAKER_09]: That means Nintendo is apparently already starting to crank out these systems in preparation for their launch, but of course

872
00:58:29,858 --> 00:58:43,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox 360 is not going to go another Christmas without plenty of systems on the shelves for everyone especially so they can really get out there and compete with the PlayStation 3 because you'll have a lot of folks making their final decisions this holiday season so it'll be very interesting.

873
00:58:43,803 --> 00:58:55,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and on top of that, it's also interesting that they mention that the Wii is in production because, according to a CNN Money story, they're saying that it's been in production at least since June 21st.

874
00:58:56,385 --> 00:59:07,367
[SPEAKER_10]: And considering the fact that the PlayStation 3 hasn't even begun production yet, and the 360 only had about 69 days before the sale date, that bodes well for gamers if you're looking for the Wii.

875
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:13,048
[SPEAKER_10]: And it also means that an October or even possibly September launch is very likely.

876
00:59:13,992 --> 00:59:19,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I doubt it's going to be a September launch because they said specifically that it's going to be in the fourth quarter.

877
00:59:19,895 --> 00:59:22,916
[SPEAKER_10]: And, well, you know, September is not the fourth quarter.

878
00:59:23,796 --> 00:59:30,659
[SPEAKER_10]: And anyways, they're supposed to actually be announcing the official date and price for the Wii in September.

879
00:59:30,819 --> 00:59:33,480
[SPEAKER_10]: So until then, we'll just have to wait.

880
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,802
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's more evidence that, you know, it could be coming out in October.

881
00:59:38,303 --> 00:59:53,566
[SPEAKER_10]: at least hopefully they're making it sound like there's not going to be shortages and according to what I've heard at my work we actually might get some at launch which means that there shouldn't be shortages out there because if they're giving them distribution at launch then that's a good sign.

882
00:59:53,746 --> 00:59:54,507
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very good sign.

883
00:59:54,907 --> 00:59:59,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, are you still sticking to that October 18th date that you leaked out a while ago on the show?

884
01:00:00,368 --> 01:00:00,688
[SPEAKER_10]: So far.

885
01:00:01,248 --> 01:00:05,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Because in our system we had our assistant buyer change all the dates on me to...

886
01:00:06,922 --> 01:00:12,585
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they did that just because they're tired of putting different dates in there for everything.

887
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:18,227
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's kind of what they're doing with the PS3 stuff until they find out more about that.

888
01:00:18,908 --> 01:00:22,089
[SPEAKER_10]: But all the pre-booked dates are still where they were before.

889
01:00:22,209 --> 01:00:25,771
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's still looking October from what I've seen so far.

890
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:27,912
[SPEAKER_10]: And even if

891
01:00:30,802 --> 01:00:36,266
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gotta be October, because I know there was another story that was like Sports Illustrated for kids or whatever, saying November 6th.

892
01:00:36,706 --> 01:00:42,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's too close to the PS3 launch to make it successful, and I think that they would want to launch at least a month in advance.

893
01:00:43,231 --> 01:00:45,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we need a friendly reminder, because we have somebody in our chatroom.

894
01:00:45,873 --> 01:00:49,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Bandit says, where does Loki work that he gets all these dates?

895
01:00:49,435 --> 01:00:51,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it GameStop, EB?

896
01:00:51,477 --> 01:00:52,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't work for GameStop or EB.

897
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:54,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I work for a game distributor.

898
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,900
[SPEAKER_10]: We sell to retail stores.

899
01:00:57,441 --> 01:00:57,721
[SPEAKER_10]: We're a

900
01:00:58,257 --> 01:00:59,718
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're one step up on the food chain.

901
01:00:59,778 --> 01:01:00,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of.

902
01:01:00,399 --> 01:01:07,665
[SPEAKER_10]: GameStop and EB, they get their dates from a system that's put in by their buyers at corporate or wherever their office is.

903
01:01:09,026 --> 01:01:16,171
[SPEAKER_10]: We get our dates straight from the publishers when they give us updates every week or so.

904
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:21,516
[SPEAKER_10]: And I look four or five times a day to see if there's a new date or a different change or anything.

905
01:01:21,576 --> 01:01:22,096
[SPEAKER_10]: And I look

906
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:24,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Very hard.

907
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:27,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Even then, sometimes the dates change around.

908
01:01:27,293 --> 01:01:29,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes they're wrong and sometimes I gotta fix them.

909
01:01:29,475 --> 01:01:36,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, our purchasing people made a goof and they put Lair saying that it was on PlayStation 2 and I had to correct them.

910
01:01:37,142 --> 01:01:39,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell them, no, you're wrong, it's a PlayStation 3 game.

911
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:44,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And they make goofs because they have a guy working for them that does the date entering that's kind of brand new to it.

912
01:01:45,028 --> 01:01:51,774
[SPEAKER_10]: So he messes up sometimes and puts wrong dates or maybe lists the name wrong sometimes.

913
01:01:52,134 --> 01:01:56,497
[SPEAKER_10]: But for the most part, you know, we do get our information straight from their sales staff.

914
01:01:56,757 --> 01:02:03,901
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of times before, you'll hear it at GameStop because, you know, their sales staff are really loose-lipped sometimes.

915
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:08,424
[SPEAKER_10]: And they'll leak out, like, I don't know, the entire E3 lineup for Konami, for example.

916
01:02:09,264 --> 01:02:11,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I guess we brought two earlier this year.

917
01:02:11,726 --> 01:02:13,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

918
01:02:13,687 --> 01:02:17,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week we like to go into the mailbag and read some emails that came to us from our listeners.

919
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, I realize DarkSakura is not here tonight.

920
01:02:19,911 --> 01:02:21,232
[SPEAKER_09]: She's usually the one that goes to the mailbag.

921
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:24,815
[SPEAKER_09]: However, she gave me permission in her absence to go in there and pull out some letters.

922
01:02:25,335 --> 01:02:27,096
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go to the mailbag.

923
01:02:27,817 --> 01:02:31,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, you guys can always send us emails.

924
01:02:31,419 --> 01:02:35,662
[SPEAKER_09]: It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com So let me put on these

925
01:02:36,317 --> 01:02:38,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Slightly used gloves, hazmat gloves.

926
01:02:38,738 --> 01:02:39,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Dig into the mailbag.

927
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:42,261
[SPEAKER_09]: First email comes to us from an unsigned name.

928
01:02:42,461 --> 01:02:46,663
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not signed, but the email address has Andrew in it, so I'm assuming the guy's name is Andrew.

929
01:02:47,604 --> 01:02:53,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I am new here and I've only listened to one podcast, but I really enjoyed it and could tell that everyone there really knew their games.

930
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:54,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

931
01:02:54,808 --> 01:03:03,173
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason I sent this email was that I got a DS and so far only have Mario Kart, and I really want to know what are, in your opinion, the best games out for the DS?

932
01:03:03,706 --> 01:03:10,494
[SPEAKER_09]: and some that have a close release date so I can buy one I know that is good and see if I can get them really cheap on the net.

933
01:03:10,935 --> 01:03:11,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Any help is appreciated.

934
01:03:13,186 --> 01:03:13,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Phoenix Wright.

935
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:15,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, Phoenix Wright.

936
01:03:15,148 --> 01:03:17,629
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can find it, Phoenix Wright is pretty hard to find.

937
01:03:17,649 --> 01:03:18,690
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing a reprint again.

938
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:19,891
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go on Capcom site right now.

939
01:03:19,911 --> 01:03:21,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Capcom is selling them out pretty quick.

940
01:03:21,812 --> 01:03:24,374
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can get one at Capcom site, great.

941
01:03:24,394 --> 01:03:26,896
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're printing them as much as they can.

942
01:03:27,256 --> 01:03:30,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they have to print them over in Hong Kong or something like that.

943
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,780
[SPEAKER_10]: And then ship them over in a batch.

944
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,021
[SPEAKER_10]: And then those sell out almost instantly.

945
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:38,785
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't get an American one, the recently re-released Japanese one does have an English option.

946
01:03:39,229 --> 01:03:42,531
[SPEAKER_06]: And since the DS is region free, you can import that and play it.

947
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:43,632
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's totally worth it.

948
01:03:43,772 --> 01:03:47,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say what you probably want to do, Tetris DS, of course.

949
01:03:47,934 --> 01:03:48,755
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, great stuff.

950
01:03:48,815 --> 01:03:49,755
[SPEAKER_09]: New Super Mario Bros.

951
01:03:49,856 --> 01:03:51,877
[SPEAKER_09]: is very popular.

952
01:03:51,917 --> 01:03:53,578
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like the old ones, I think you'll get a kick out of it.

953
01:03:53,598 --> 01:03:54,378
[SPEAKER_10]: New Super Mario Bros.

954
01:03:54,418 --> 01:03:54,999
[SPEAKER_10]: is pretty cool.

955
01:03:55,019 --> 01:04:00,022
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually want to get some of those bit generation games that are coming out on the Game Boy Advance because they look pretty cool.

956
01:04:00,542 --> 01:04:01,903
[SPEAKER_09]: I would recommend highly Meteos.

957
01:04:01,923 --> 01:04:04,164
[SPEAKER_10]: If you like puzzlers at all, definitely get your hands on Meteos.

958
01:04:04,224 --> 01:04:05,025
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still a good value.

959
01:04:05,745 --> 01:04:08,047
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's actually pretty cheap, you can find it out there.

960
01:04:08,087 --> 01:04:13,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they were doing a clear out of them at, I think, Toys R Us or something?

961
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:16,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it really depends what type of games you like.

962
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:19,853
[SPEAKER_09]: But the DS has some solid hits in every genre right now.

963
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:21,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Except racing.

964
01:04:21,634 --> 01:04:23,115
[SPEAKER_06]: What about Mario Kart?

965
01:04:23,135 --> 01:04:24,656
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't count, because it's fun.

966
01:04:24,696 --> 01:04:31,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Go check out the new section over at GameStop, or even go check out the bargain bins down at Toys R Us or KB...

967
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:33,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Our second email of three tonight comes from Seth.

968
01:04:34,011 --> 01:04:36,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Seth and I'm 15 and I listen to the podcast every week.

969
01:04:50,575 --> 01:05:19,681
[SPEAKER_09]: the past couple episodes you've been discussing the new laws that are being made in states such as Louisiana I think these laws are ridiculous I'm young and I play violent games I don't ever get the urge to go outside and shoot people if I played a Harry Potter game which I don't I wouldn't go outside with my mom's broom and jump off the roof because I think I can fly I believe that the government is just trying to find an excuse for why kids are going out and shooting up their schools thanks for having such a great show I listen to OLR every week well thanks for the kind words hey you know what

970
01:05:21,035 --> 01:05:21,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty smart kid there.

971
01:05:23,443 --> 01:05:27,136
[SPEAKER_09]: With the Harry Potter reference, that's a pretty interesting comparison there.

972
01:05:27,858 --> 01:05:31,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, and I mean, look at, what was it, that movie, The Boy Who Could Fly?

973
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:34,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Did he have, like, a high, you know, rate of suicides after that movie?

974
01:05:34,883 --> 01:05:36,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, I mean, he jumped off his roof and started flying.

975
01:05:37,264 --> 01:05:39,366
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, did we see kids, you know, just trying to kill themselves?

976
01:05:39,386 --> 01:05:41,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now, kids do imitate, try to imitate the movie sometimes, though.

977
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:51,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, remember, I'm trying to think, what was that one where, like, it had a scene where people were lying down in the middle of the road, and some kids tried to imitate that, and of course got run over, and then they, like, re-released the movie with that scene edited?

978
01:05:51,594 --> 01:05:51,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

979
01:05:52,558 --> 01:05:53,759
[SPEAKER_09]: It was years ago, God.

980
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:55,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what you're talking about.

981
01:05:56,261 --> 01:05:56,922
[SPEAKER_10]: It's stupid.

982
01:05:58,143 --> 01:05:59,244
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just media in general.

983
01:05:59,264 --> 01:06:02,406
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to blame media because, obviously, it's not the parents' fault.

984
01:06:02,686 --> 01:06:04,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Never the parents' fault.

985
01:06:05,989 --> 01:06:08,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're starting to get it, but they're just not quite.

986
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:17,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially, this is only going to be brought up again once Scarface comes out, once Reservoir Dogs comes out.

987
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:21,642
[SPEAKER_10]: This fourth quarter is really bad when it comes to this whole violent game thing.

988
01:06:23,632 --> 01:06:30,276
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go to our last email tonight, which comes to us from GrinWithoutACat.

989
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:33,779
[SPEAKER_09]: This must be like a ShazireCat type thing.

990
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:34,519
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a pretty cool name.

991
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:35,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, guys.

992
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,721
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been listening to the podcast for a couple months now.

993
01:06:37,781 --> 01:06:45,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in the UK, so it's a little bit late for me to stay up to listen live, as some brave soul did the other week, but I look forward to each download.

994
01:06:45,647 --> 01:06:50,830
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to respond to what the PMS and FragDoll clans had to say about the beauty pageant at the gaming event,

995
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:51,631
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

996
01:07:09,821 --> 01:07:11,302
[SPEAKER_09]: The word hypocrites comes to mind.

997
01:07:12,203 --> 01:07:17,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, GrimWithoutACat goes on to say, I think an OLR gaming group is a great idea.

998
01:07:17,548 --> 01:07:24,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm planning to get a 360 in September as I'm really interested in live and making my gaming experiences more sociable, but I keep hearing enjoyment of live...

999
01:07:27,932 --> 01:07:28,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Relays?

1000
01:07:28,473 --> 01:07:29,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a misspelled word there.

1001
01:07:29,654 --> 01:07:31,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Live games on a good friend's list.

1002
01:07:32,176 --> 01:07:34,378
[SPEAKER_09]: And all my gaming friends are PC-only gamers.

1003
01:07:34,498 --> 01:07:35,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Relays, I think.

1004
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:36,340
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it was supposed to be.

1005
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was just reading it wrong.

1006
01:07:37,681 --> 01:07:41,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, but I keep hearing enjoyment of live relies on a good friend's list.

1007
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:41,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1008
01:07:41,704 --> 01:07:43,826
[SPEAKER_09]: And all my gaming friends are PC-only gamers.

1009
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:47,769
[SPEAKER_09]: So to have a group of friendly faces to ease me into online gaming would be welcome.

1010
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:52,313
[SPEAKER_09]: On the second point there, I can say, I love this.

1011
01:07:52,373 --> 01:07:54,715
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go to the forums, there's like a thread that

1012
01:07:54,994 --> 01:07:55,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Counter-Strike

1013
01:08:13,394 --> 01:08:15,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, in some mod or something.

1014
01:08:15,976 --> 01:08:20,859
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really funny because if you look at the picture, the screenshot somebody took, the gun is pointed right at your face, Loki.

1015
01:08:20,879 --> 01:08:21,199
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

1016
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:23,860
[SPEAKER_09]: But then, no, I thought this was cool too.

1017
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:29,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there's a Guild Wars clan as well, and somebody just posted a picture of their cape, and it's like an orange cape.

1018
01:08:29,804 --> 01:08:36,008
[SPEAKER_09]: And they couldn't really put their own logo on it, but they put something that looked like Sakura blossoms on it for Dark Sakura.

1019
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:36,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

1020
01:08:37,038 --> 01:08:37,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that's cute.

1021
01:08:38,099 --> 01:08:38,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

1022
01:08:38,659 --> 01:08:39,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Our listeners are so awesome.

1023
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:43,320
[SPEAKER_09]: So check out that thread on our forums and you can find some gamers.

1024
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,321
[SPEAKER_09]: There's even an Xbox Live Gamer Tag Exchange.

1025
01:08:45,641 --> 01:08:47,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And I even give out my gamer tag.

1026
01:08:47,222 --> 01:08:47,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

1027
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:49,763
[SPEAKER_10]: My gamer tag is on there and I have a bunch of friends.

1028
01:08:50,503 --> 01:08:53,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly enough, I am paying for live, but I don't really play over live.

1029
01:08:53,584 --> 01:08:53,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't get it.

1030
01:08:54,285 --> 01:08:55,045
[SPEAKER_10]: I do once in a while.

1031
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:58,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I really need to get down to... I'll play Halo 3 when it's out for sure.

1032
01:08:58,628 --> 01:09:01,350
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just I don't really have that many good games that I want to play.

1033
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:04,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, Burnout, even over live, I don't really care for it that much.

1034
01:09:04,072 --> 01:09:04,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought Burnout was fun.

1035
01:09:04,993 --> 01:09:07,155
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just not good at it, so it doesn't give me incentive to play.

1036
01:09:07,335 --> 01:09:08,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to play Chromehounds over live.

1037
01:09:08,716 --> 01:09:09,557
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that'd be fun.

1038
01:09:09,577 --> 01:09:17,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Chromehounds is actually going to allow you to do clans, so I think that's something that they really need because, I don't know, you don't really have that over live.

1039
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:19,064
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1040
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much for the emails.

1041
01:09:21,061 --> 01:09:21,802
[SPEAKER_09]: We really appreciate it.

1042
01:09:21,822 --> 01:09:24,086
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys want to send us an email as well, you can always do that.

1043
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:27,151
[SPEAKER_09]: It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1044
01:09:28,253 --> 01:09:32,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, we started a new segment last week called the Voicemails of the Week.

1045
01:09:32,499 --> 01:09:34,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanted to try something a little different using our Skype line.

1046
01:09:35,131 --> 01:09:40,395
[SPEAKER_09]: And we invited you guys to send us some voicemails in regards to a particular topic.

1047
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:47,060
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of you guys called in about the topic, but one of the voicemails we're going to play tonight has nothing to do with the topic at hand, but it's still kind of funny, so we'll play it.

1048
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:52,765
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was very overwhelmed with the response when I went in there to go look.

1049
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:55,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you guys off air how much we got.

1050
01:09:55,286 --> 01:09:55,787
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool.

1051
01:09:56,007 --> 01:09:56,547
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1052
01:10:25,077 --> 01:10:32,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello Orange Lounge Radio, this is the all-infamous Fury Lover answering your question of the voicemail of the week.

1053
01:10:33,099 --> 01:10:42,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually pre-order certain games that I would like to buy that I know would get, uh, that would be sold out.

1054
01:10:43,581 --> 01:10:52,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the advantages of actually pre-ordering games are, um, are actually quite good because, uh, if you pre-order a game from

1055
01:10:53,666 --> 01:11:01,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Trusted sources like GameStop or EB Games, you know you'll have the game when it comes out or whenever you want to get it.

1056
01:11:02,509 --> 01:11:09,811
[SPEAKER_02]: But pre-ordering games from things like FYE and stuff like that is just...

1057
01:11:11,207 --> 01:11:11,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Horrible.

1058
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:14,070
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's all I have to say.

1059
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:14,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1060
01:11:14,931 --> 01:11:15,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1061
01:11:15,391 --> 01:11:16,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the voicemail, Yuri Lover.

1062
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:20,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's interesting because it sounds like he trusts some stores but he doesn't trust others.

1063
01:11:20,696 --> 01:11:26,342
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's true because some stores I think actually do buy direct from the publishers and some don't.

1064
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:31,547
[SPEAKER_10]: So they might get them late or might not get them at all or they're relying on some other source to get them.

1065
01:11:31,707 --> 01:11:33,248
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1066
01:11:57,626 --> 01:11:58,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not as interested in that game.

1067
01:11:58,787 --> 01:12:01,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I might pick it up, but I'm much more interested in XII.

1068
01:12:01,549 --> 01:12:03,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Dirt Disturbance isn't really Final Fantasy.

1069
01:12:03,131 --> 01:12:05,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, sure, it's Vincent, but it's not really Final Fantasy.

1070
01:12:05,212 --> 01:12:11,838
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, having a modded PS2 really opens the options for me as far as where I can get that game.

1071
01:12:12,618 --> 01:12:14,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to our next voicemail.

1072
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:16,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, OLR.

1073
01:12:16,642 --> 01:12:18,523
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Razorburn2021.

1074
01:12:18,884 --> 01:12:21,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Your question, I believe, was about pre-ordering games and...

1075
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:26,532
[SPEAKER_04]: If I don't have to, I try not to pre-order games.

1076
01:12:27,252 --> 01:12:39,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe there was an argument that I'd read a year or two, something like that ago, in the arcade about the problems with pre-ordering games is that that's kind of how game stores gauge what they should stock.

1077
01:12:39,377 --> 01:12:46,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And you talked about games like Point Blank DS that are difficult to find, and that's because generally no one pre-orders them.

1078
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I don't have to, I try not to.

1079
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:50,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't recommend it.

1080
01:12:51,315 --> 01:12:57,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't generally have to pre-order movies, I don't generally have to pre-order CDs or several other things that I like to buy.

1081
01:12:58,019 --> 01:13:01,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just like if I could go into a game store and purchase what I want to.

1082
01:13:02,341 --> 01:13:03,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate your show.

1083
01:13:03,622 --> 01:13:04,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good day.

1084
01:13:04,844 --> 01:13:05,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the voicemail.

1085
01:13:05,564 --> 01:13:11,727
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was an interesting one because he gives a good argument for why you should pre-order games, but then says he doesn't do it.

1086
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:17,649
[SPEAKER_09]: But I like that he gave the kind of comparison there about the I don't pre-order movies or CDs.

1087
01:13:18,709 --> 01:13:22,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I seem to recall though, I seem to remember a day where you could pre-order CDs.

1088
01:13:22,771 --> 01:13:24,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Who buys CDs anymore anyway?

1089
01:13:24,492 --> 01:13:26,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you need to pre-order them?

1090
01:13:26,794 --> 01:13:29,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually do buy CDs.

1091
01:13:29,476 --> 01:13:30,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I use iTunes.

1092
01:13:30,177 --> 01:13:32,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad the internet's there.

1093
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:41,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I do every now and then like going into a CD store like Tower and going through their dance section or their import section and just listening to what they've got.

1094
01:13:41,906 --> 01:13:43,848
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of times it's hard to find stuff.

1095
01:13:44,088 --> 01:13:46,150
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of why I turn to the internet because...

1096
01:13:46,837 --> 01:13:58,434
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't find something because it was only on a single vinyl, and I'm not going to buy a $10 record, even though I do have two turntables I don't ever use.

1097
01:13:58,735 --> 01:13:59,275
[SPEAKER_10]: A microphone?

1098
01:14:00,417 --> 01:14:00,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

1099
01:14:00,798 --> 01:14:01,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget it.

1100
01:14:02,825 --> 01:14:05,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is Makran, and

1101
01:14:28,129 --> 01:14:34,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just listening to the podcast that I got during iTunes and the poos.

1102
01:14:34,574 --> 01:14:44,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not sure if you all got your thoughts together in a complete box together in this area enough.

1103
01:14:45,082 --> 01:14:53,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you elaborate on your feelings about the gayest name of a video game accessory and or console ever created?

1104
01:14:54,109 --> 01:14:54,549
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

1105
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:55,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

1106
01:14:56,328 --> 01:14:58,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Gayest name of a video game accessory.

1107
01:14:58,289 --> 01:15:00,289
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a random question.

1108
01:15:00,549 --> 01:15:03,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, did you hear about the Tekken butt plug, actually?

1109
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:03,911
[SPEAKER_09]: That's easy.

1110
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:06,791
[SPEAKER_09]: The Rez Transfibrator.

1111
01:15:06,831 --> 01:15:08,672
[SPEAKER_09]: The Rez Transfibrator, of course.

1112
01:15:08,832 --> 01:15:09,993
[SPEAKER_10]: The Transfibrator is...

1113
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:15,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's someone that was on E when they figured out that one.

1114
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, it vibrates with the music.

1115
01:15:18,021 --> 01:15:20,043
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

1116
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:23,085
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels totally good when I'm on E and I'm touching it.

1117
01:15:23,225 --> 01:15:28,369
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a week later and I still don't believe that Pooh's thing that they're going to call the Sony controller the Pooh's.

1118
01:15:28,449 --> 01:15:29,270
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a load of crap.

1119
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:30,951
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a load of Pooh is what it is.

1120
01:15:31,131 --> 01:15:31,631
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't buy it.

1121
01:15:33,942 --> 01:15:38,226
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, and I weep for Sony, because that's, I mean, God.

1122
01:15:38,946 --> 01:15:45,312
[SPEAKER_09]: We have been kicking, I mean, the gaming community has been kicking those guys non-stop since E3, and this is just another, like, oh my God.

1123
01:15:46,613 --> 01:15:50,536
[SPEAKER_10]: If they called it the poos, that would be the candy sprinkles on the icing of the cake.

1124
01:15:50,576 --> 01:15:51,717
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's all it would really be.

1125
01:15:51,777 --> 01:15:55,841
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need it, but it's there, and you gotta appreciate it.

1126
01:15:55,941 --> 01:16:00,385
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't think it's gonna matter what they call the controller, because...

1127
01:16:01,172 --> 01:16:01,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching.

1128
01:16:01,632 --> 01:16:02,113
[SPEAKER_10]: See you next time.

1129
01:16:21,698 --> 01:16:26,921
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you could use your finger, I mean, hypothetically, you could use, you know what, forget wherever that thought's going.

1130
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:29,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's it for the voicemails of the week.

1131
01:16:29,843 --> 01:16:39,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Overall, though, it seems like you guys, the kind of general consensus I was getting from the voicemails is that you guys prefer pre-ordering for certain games, but not everything.

1132
01:16:39,988 --> 01:16:42,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for your voicemails, and sorry to those folks we didn't get around to.

1133
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:44,831
[SPEAKER_09]: If you would like to leave us this voicemail, please do.

1134
01:16:44,871 --> 01:16:46,931
[SPEAKER_09]: The number is 916-226-9067.

1135
01:16:48,472 --> 01:16:50,472
[SPEAKER_09]: But remember, that may be a toll call.

1136
01:16:50,512 --> 01:16:54,433
[SPEAKER_09]: So please, if you don't pay the bills, ask whoever does their permission first.

1137
01:16:55,073 --> 01:16:58,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Or use a cell phone because a lot of times they get free long distance.

1138
01:16:58,815 --> 01:17:00,495
[SPEAKER_09]: But make sure it does before you call.

1139
01:17:01,695 --> 01:17:03,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, if you're not paying the bill, you better ask.

1140
01:17:04,276 --> 01:17:05,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can use Skype.

1141
01:17:05,096 --> 01:17:08,117
[SPEAKER_09]: You can call us on Orange Launch Radio at Skype anytime when we're not live.

1142
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:09,418
[SPEAKER_09]: And you also get the voicemail that way.

1143
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,958
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we did get a couple voicemails that way.

1144
01:17:11,538 --> 01:17:16,120
[SPEAKER_09]: The question we have for you guys, you know we want your opinions on this, the whole Sony billboard controversy.

1145
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:17,340
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think of that?

1146
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:20,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is it being overblown?

1147
01:17:20,782 --> 01:17:22,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Do people have a right to be upset?

1148
01:17:22,422 --> 01:17:24,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it in good taste, bad taste?

1149
01:17:24,603 --> 01:17:25,983
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think of that whole controversy?

1150
01:17:26,003 --> 01:17:27,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to hear from you guys on that one.

1151
01:17:27,964 --> 01:17:30,505
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll play some of our favorite voicemails next week.

1152
01:17:31,205 --> 01:17:32,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, back to the news.

1153
01:17:32,726 --> 01:17:35,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and speaking about strange stuff.

1154
01:17:37,165 --> 01:17:44,650
[SPEAKER_10]: DOA's, I can't even pronounce his name, but Itagaki, that's right.

1155
01:17:45,691 --> 01:17:47,212
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why I'm not Japanese.

1156
01:17:47,332 --> 01:17:52,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, he admits to being quite intoxicated while creating DOA4.

1157
01:17:54,057 --> 01:17:58,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's all pretty much, I'm drinking pretty much full time.

1158
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:05,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, there are ups and downs, waves of how I drink in terms of the amount, but it's long periods of time.

1159
01:18:06,798 --> 01:18:13,699
[SPEAKER_10]: In the last 10 years, not that you asked this question, I think I had better ideas when I was drinking whiskey.

1160
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:21,381
[SPEAKER_10]: When I'm drinking shochu, that's a conservative drink, so the ideas are not that great.

1161
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:27,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Beer is just like water to me, so it helps me and everything else loosen up a bit.

1162
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:31,203
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't really contribute to coming up with ideas.

1163
01:18:32,478 --> 01:18:35,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is explained on why there was a Dead or Alive volleyball game now.

1164
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is explained.

1165
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:39,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Because most people, when they heard that, were like, what?

1166
01:18:40,202 --> 01:18:40,702
[SPEAKER_09]: That explains it.

1167
01:18:40,742 --> 01:18:41,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It also explains why.

1168
01:18:41,963 --> 01:18:43,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, that guy is such a rock star.

1169
01:18:44,064 --> 01:18:47,886
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, when you look at pictures of him and see him in interviews, he's just a freaking rock star.

1170
01:18:47,926 --> 01:18:50,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, he's like the Tommy Lee of game designs, right?

1171
01:18:50,687 --> 01:18:54,229
[SPEAKER_09]: You know he's the type of person that probably thrashes hotel rooms.

1172
01:18:54,571 --> 01:18:59,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Setser with a fat cigar in his mouth while he's probably, you know, designing games and stuff.

1173
01:18:59,895 --> 01:19:01,216
[SPEAKER_09]: It's no surprise to me that he's in it.

1174
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:11,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I kind of wish that Weeble was kind of like handling DOA, the movie, because if it got, you know, all fucked up, this guy could come beat the crap out of him, Japanese style.

1175
01:19:11,424 --> 01:19:12,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Break a bottle over his head.

1176
01:19:13,365 --> 01:19:14,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1177
01:19:15,026 --> 01:19:18,949
[SPEAKER_10]: He should put himself in the next DOA game, because that would be awesome.

1178
01:19:19,069 --> 01:19:21,351
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to play him in DOA.

1179
01:19:21,711 --> 01:19:23,833
[SPEAKER_10]: That might sell another copy of the game for me.

1180
01:19:25,362 --> 01:19:26,483
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played DOA 4, it was fun.

1181
01:19:47,688 --> 01:19:48,769
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll probably enjoy this.

1182
01:19:49,549 --> 01:19:51,950
[SPEAKER_09]: The Bob Ross game that's coming out.

1183
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:55,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Bob Ross Interactive is actually having a contest right now.

1184
01:19:55,472 --> 01:20:03,936
[SPEAKER_09]: It started on July 4th, and they are accepting work, but only those that are created using Bob Ross' patented wet-on-wet technique.

1185
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:05,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you giggling?

1186
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:07,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was funny sounding.

1187
01:20:07,797 --> 01:20:10,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the wet-on-wet technique for those who haven't watched the show.

1188
01:20:10,999 --> 01:20:14,320
[SPEAKER_10]: You put a base coat of their paint on it, and then you...

1189
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:16,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Trees

1190
01:20:39,463 --> 01:20:42,584
[SPEAKER_09]: and I believe you can actually visit www.bobross.com for more of the details.

1191
01:20:42,624 --> 01:20:43,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Bob Ross, beyond grave.

1192
01:21:07,648 --> 01:21:09,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.

1193
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:14,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, speaking of stuff that's, I don't know, dead.

1194
01:21:15,415 --> 01:21:20,880
[SPEAKER_10]: The PSP security on the firmware, that's pretty much dead.

1195
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, now you can downgrade.

1196
01:21:23,762 --> 01:21:26,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if you happen to own a 2.6 or 2.7

1197
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:30,377
[SPEAKER_10]: 2.5 or 2.6 firmware.

1198
01:21:30,838 --> 01:21:31,398
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, folks.

1199
01:21:31,418 --> 01:21:32,279
[SPEAKER_10]: You can downgrade.

1200
01:21:32,859 --> 01:21:34,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Gradius upgraded me to 2.6.

1201
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:35,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1202
01:21:36,082 --> 01:21:40,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Grand Theft Auto was probably one of the ones that got you to 2.5.

1203
01:21:40,565 --> 01:21:41,485
[SPEAKER_10]: 2.6 for me was Katamari.

1204
01:21:41,806 --> 01:21:48,490
[SPEAKER_10]: But they have decrypted 2.5 and 2.6, and now there is a downgrader.

1205
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:54,435
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, if you visit PSP Updates, they have tons of different downgraders that you can get to do that, including...

1206
01:21:55,492 --> 01:21:56,293
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1207
01:22:16,894 --> 01:22:19,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't they just get the homebrew to work on 2.6?

1208
01:22:21,098 --> 01:22:21,518
[SPEAKER_10]: They have.

1209
01:22:21,598 --> 01:22:22,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, good.

1210
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:23,140
[SPEAKER_10]: They have that.

1211
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:27,824
[SPEAKER_10]: They also have this thing where you can actually run... I haven't been following PSP hacking for a while.

1212
01:22:27,844 --> 01:22:31,287
[SPEAKER_10]: You can run 1.5, and it will give you the features of 2.5.

1213
01:22:31,407 --> 01:22:36,691
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have the RSS features, the web browser, and you can play 2.5 games on there.

1214
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:38,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Wi-Fi doesn't quite work well, though, with that.

1215
01:22:39,214 --> 01:22:41,115
[SPEAKER_10]: But still kind of neat that they're doing it.

1216
01:22:41,496 --> 01:22:42,777
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know...

1217
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:44,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1218
01:22:45,246 --> 01:22:47,287
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really follow the Homebrew stuff as much anymore.

1219
01:22:47,307 --> 01:22:49,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have a Nintendo emulator for 2.6 firmware?

1220
01:22:50,469 --> 01:22:52,170
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically anything works with 2.6.

1221
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:53,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1222
01:22:53,431 --> 01:22:57,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, the thing with 2.6 is you have to have Grand Theft Auto in order to do all these workarounds.

1223
01:22:58,054 --> 01:23:05,359
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, you may want to downgrade or something or just don't play emulators on there because whatever.

1224
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Get a DS for that.

1225
01:23:07,801 --> 01:23:09,122
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of stuff for that.

1226
01:23:09,562 --> 01:23:12,364
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's not... I can't play Kid Icarus on my DS yet.

1227
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:13,836
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't!

1228
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:14,177
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't!

1229
01:23:34,285 --> 01:23:35,206
[SPEAKER_10]: You can use this game.

1230
01:23:35,406 --> 01:23:37,007
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically Step Mania for the PSP.

1231
01:23:37,367 --> 01:23:42,651
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you do end up downgrading to 1.5, check out PSP Revolution version 0.2.

1232
01:23:43,011 --> 01:23:46,333
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be really fun to play on a handheld.

1233
01:23:46,894 --> 01:23:49,335
[SPEAKER_10]: And they've added... DDR on the Game Boy is stupid.

1234
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:49,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1235
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:50,556
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no way around it.

1236
01:23:50,576 --> 01:23:56,980
[SPEAKER_10]: They've added theme support and arrow speed modifiers as well as AUG music files are now supported.

1237
01:23:57,981 --> 01:23:58,121
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

1238
01:23:59,582 --> 01:24:02,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, marathon songs and all that sort of stuff.

1239
01:24:02,108 --> 01:24:08,043
[SPEAKER_10]: So check it out if you're really interested in Step Mania on your PSP.

1240
01:24:10,146 --> 01:24:12,247
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, completely changing gears here.

1241
01:24:12,287 --> 01:24:16,849
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't talked a whole lot about Microsoft tonight because, you know, Xbox 360, it's out.

1242
01:24:17,049 --> 01:24:22,032
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a lot, you know, and it's got their games coming out, so we don't have quite the rumors that we have with Sony and Nintendo.

1243
01:24:22,072 --> 01:24:24,973
[SPEAKER_09]: However, Microsoft does have some rumors of their own.

1244
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:34,558
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been reported by Bloomberg that Microsoft may be working on an iPod killer that's supposed to hit shelves this Christmas.

1245
01:24:35,498 --> 01:24:35,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote,

1246
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:16,594
[SPEAKER_09]: You can assume that, especially with, I would say, that whole Xbox Live Anywhere thing that's going to be on the cell phones and all that, this might play into that or something else.

1247
01:25:16,774 --> 01:25:19,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say maybe Xbox Live Arcade stuff.

1248
01:25:19,996 --> 01:25:20,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly.

1249
01:25:20,936 --> 01:25:22,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly, so don't count it out.

1250
01:25:22,357 --> 01:25:24,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if this whole thing is true to me.

1251
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:27,761
[SPEAKER_10]: They do have Xbox Live Arcade for the PC as well, I mean, so.

1252
01:25:28,321 --> 01:25:33,865
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you ever visit zone.msn.com, I think it is, The Zone, they have gaming badges.

1253
01:25:34,086 --> 01:25:37,128
[SPEAKER_09]: It's set up very similar to how Xbox Live works.

1254
01:25:37,188 --> 01:25:38,569
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very interesting, so.

1255
01:25:38,953 --> 01:25:39,093
[SPEAKER_09]: MSN

1256
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:14,341
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I almost see them doing something like the Nomad for the original Xbox in something like this.

1257
01:26:14,381 --> 01:26:21,705
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of where I'm seeing this going, is maybe like a portable Xbox, like an original one where it plays the old Xbox games.

1258
01:26:21,745 --> 01:26:25,127
[SPEAKER_10]: So they don't really have to make new games, but I don't know.

1259
01:26:25,227 --> 01:26:29,269
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it might be a little late to do something like that, but I thought.

1260
01:26:29,529 --> 01:26:35,412
[SPEAKER_09]: GK128 in our chatroom says, It figures Microsoft is coming out with a Super MP3 player just as I bought a fancy new one.

1261
01:26:37,111 --> 01:26:40,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry, Apple put out the video iPods like a week after I bought mine.

1262
01:26:41,204 --> 01:26:41,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, jerks.

1263
01:26:42,285 --> 01:26:49,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, something that's definitely going to be implemented with probably this is going to be some sort of e-distribution, especially of music and movies.

1264
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:57,675
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, Sony is talking about doing games because their first priority, of course, is games with the PS3, right?

1265
01:26:57,815 --> 01:27:07,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so they're definitely talking about doing something to the sense of Xbox Live's marketplace where you can be able to download arcade-type games.

1266
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:14,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Games, and according to an article that was on Gamasutra, definitely something that they're going to be doing.

1267
01:27:14,607 --> 01:27:20,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly being able to sell growably online makes it easier to reach international and remote markets.

1268
01:27:20,952 --> 01:27:24,795
[SPEAKER_10]: On the business side, it also lowers the cost of sales and eliminates inventory risk.

1269
01:27:24,915 --> 01:27:27,777
[SPEAKER_10]: It should help curtail used game sales and piracy.

1270
01:27:28,598 --> 01:27:33,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like the whole used game sales thing, but I can understand the piracy, I guess.

1271
01:27:34,062 --> 01:27:35,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Something tells me that's not going to work.

1272
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:36,254
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura,

1273
01:27:59,605 --> 01:28:00,385
[SPEAKER_10]: You shouldn't be doing that.

1274
01:28:00,465 --> 01:28:21,931
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, so yeah, definitely they're going to be doing something probably similar to, actually, I'm thinking putting on PlayStation 1 games to be able to download straight to the hard drive, being that the size of the files should be a lot smaller, and they're also going to be doing something similar with the PSP, so if they can do it on the PSP, they can definitely do it on the PS3, so that's kind of a given.

1275
01:28:22,351 --> 01:28:28,773
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, maybe even later on down the lines, being able to stream all, you know, real PS3 games, so...

1276
01:28:30,290 --> 01:28:31,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Something that they're interested in.

1277
01:28:31,691 --> 01:28:33,392
[SPEAKER_10]: What's kind of interesting, though, is their comment here.

1278
01:28:33,432 --> 01:28:33,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

1279
01:28:33,672 --> 01:28:34,192
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

1280
01:28:54,318 --> 01:28:55,439
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll see how that goes.

1281
01:28:56,799 --> 01:28:58,280
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do have something real quick.

1282
01:28:58,340 --> 01:28:58,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sure.

1283
01:28:59,221 --> 01:29:05,545
[SPEAKER_10]: The PlayStation Beyond site that launched during Game Developers Conference this year, and you always see this Play Beyond thing.

1284
01:29:05,585 --> 01:29:07,986
[SPEAKER_10]: How much do you want to bet that they're calling their marketplace Beyond?

1285
01:29:09,007 --> 01:29:09,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a thought.

1286
01:29:10,788 --> 01:29:11,608
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an interesting thought.

1287
01:29:12,849 --> 01:29:13,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's a big game.

1288
01:29:13,769 --> 01:29:15,050
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes sense.

1289
01:29:15,070 --> 01:29:16,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it'll all tie together in the end.

1290
01:29:17,391 --> 01:29:22,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, changing gears here, Empire Interactive, been some rumblings out of there this week.

1291
01:29:22,655 --> 01:29:26,898
[SPEAKER_09]: The Flat Out franchise is going to be coming to the Xbox 360.

1292
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:29,059
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Flat Out Total Carnage.

1293
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:33,302
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those of you guys not familiar with this series, it originally came out July last year.

1294
01:29:33,903 --> 01:29:39,667
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got destructible cars, kind of like a racing game, and of course scenery, and it's got sadistic minigames inside it.

1295
01:29:39,947 --> 01:29:46,051
[SPEAKER_09]: You go into barriers at high speed, you eject the driver to hit targets like a giant dartboard or bowling pins.

1296
01:29:47,392 --> 01:29:49,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard you talk about this game.

1297
01:29:49,714 --> 01:29:51,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I played it last year when it first came out.

1298
01:29:51,955 --> 01:29:54,837
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pretty fun game.

1299
01:29:55,317 --> 01:29:59,220
[SPEAKER_10]: This year they rebuilt the whole game from the ground up, so it's a lot better, a lot faster.

1300
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,101
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like a cross between Burnout and Destruction Derby.

1301
01:30:02,721 --> 01:30:06,902
[SPEAKER_10]: And you also have a whole ton of mini-games called the Ragdoll Olympics type stuff.

1302
01:30:07,303 --> 01:30:10,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can basically eject your driver out.

1303
01:30:10,284 --> 01:30:12,164
[SPEAKER_10]: One, for example, is baseball.

1304
01:30:12,484 --> 01:30:20,387
[SPEAKER_10]: And you eject your driver out, and he flies up towards this giant baseball bat and is smacked with the baseball bat, and you fling his body into a mitt.

1305
01:30:21,525 --> 01:30:22,366
[SPEAKER_10]: I can tell you this much.

1306
01:30:22,386 --> 01:30:23,747
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds so stupid but fun.

1307
01:30:23,767 --> 01:30:27,751
[SPEAKER_10]: You can play these mini games and they will keep you entertained for hours.

1308
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:29,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially you.

1309
01:30:29,292 --> 01:30:32,234
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably sat there and giggled for like an hour.

1310
01:30:32,294 --> 01:30:32,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes I did.

1311
01:30:33,476 --> 01:30:39,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I played the high jump, like, I don't know, for at least a half an hour just like looking at the thing.

1312
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:40,001
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was fun.

1313
01:30:40,061 --> 01:30:41,142
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pretty fun game.

1314
01:30:41,182 --> 01:30:42,383
[SPEAKER_10]: This one looks a lot better.

1315
01:30:42,463 --> 01:30:43,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Flat Out 2 is coming out.

1316
01:30:43,744 --> 01:30:44,165
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1317
01:30:44,385 --> 01:30:46,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox, PC, and PlayStation 2.

1318
01:30:47,304 --> 01:30:49,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think I'm the... August 1st.

1319
01:30:49,693 --> 01:30:50,074
[SPEAKER_09]: This fall.

1320
01:30:50,115 --> 01:30:50,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're saying this fall.

1321
01:30:50,917 --> 01:30:51,520
[SPEAKER_09]: August 1st.

1322
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:52,242
[SPEAKER_09]: They're wrong.

1323
01:30:52,684 --> 01:30:53,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we'll see.

1324
01:30:55,023 --> 01:31:02,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Empire Interactive is coming out with a PSP version of Taito Legends and is also working on a version of Ford Street Racing for the PSP as well.

1325
01:31:02,548 --> 01:31:04,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, goody, Ford Street Racing.

1326
01:31:04,189 --> 01:31:06,010
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just such an awesome game.

1327
01:31:06,651 --> 01:31:07,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played it.

1328
01:31:07,391 --> 01:31:08,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't really have an opinion on it.

1329
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:13,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Lame-o is what you might call that game, but yeah.

1330
01:31:14,556 --> 01:31:18,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, something that's not quite as lame as Ford Street Racing there.

1331
01:31:20,039 --> 01:31:23,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Zelda is actually... There's a homebrew Zelda.

1332
01:31:24,195 --> 01:31:26,542
[SPEAKER_10]: for mobile phones, and they're calling it Zelda.

1333
01:31:27,947 --> 01:31:31,749
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of funny because when you think of Zelda, you think of Wind Waker.

1334
01:31:31,969 --> 01:31:33,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Phantom Hourglass, even.

1335
01:31:33,850 --> 01:31:41,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's funny you should mention that because they actually are using the Minish Cap graphics, so it kind of looks a little bit like Wind Waker.

1336
01:31:42,655 --> 01:31:45,156
[SPEAKER_10]: And sort of, you know, Wind Waker and Zelda.

1337
01:31:45,216 --> 01:31:48,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought Minish Cap looked more like the old school Super Nintendo one.

1338
01:31:48,978 --> 01:31:51,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it kind of... But here's a few things.

1339
01:31:51,079 --> 01:31:52,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Too bad it wasn't as fun.

1340
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:55,362
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, there's actually, you know...

1341
01:31:56,102 --> 01:31:57,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Some pretty impressive graphics on there.

1342
01:31:58,883 --> 01:32:02,944
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the latest demo, which is working on M.I.D.P.2 compatible phones.

1343
01:32:04,205 --> 01:32:07,186
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually a way you can check it out to see if you have it or not.

1344
01:32:08,166 --> 01:32:10,507
[SPEAKER_10]: A compatible phone, a lot of them out there.

1345
01:32:10,547 --> 01:32:13,108
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know how the hell to put this on my phone, to be honest.

1346
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:17,830
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're interested, though, they also have a PC version.

1347
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:19,590
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be interesting.

1348
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:24,332
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to check and see what kind of phone you have, if it'll work, there's a website.

1349
01:32:24,592 --> 01:32:24,712
[SPEAKER_10]: It's

1350
01:32:25,592 --> 01:32:32,353
[SPEAKER_10]: rumkin.com slash tools slash sprint slash index.php rumplestillskin.com

1351
01:32:37,536 --> 01:32:38,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll check that out.

1352
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:40,377
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a cell phone game I might be able to get into.

1353
01:32:40,737 --> 01:32:41,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, actually, I'm sorry.

1354
01:32:41,518 --> 01:32:51,783
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the website, jbenchmark.com slash phonedetails.jsp and that'll let you know what kind of phone you have and if it supports that.

1355
01:32:52,323 --> 01:32:53,103
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of neat.

1356
01:32:53,584 --> 01:32:56,365
[SPEAKER_10]: And the PC version I'm kind of willing to check out and I'm

1357
01:32:57,168 --> 01:32:59,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe his website has gone down since

1358
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Check it out.

1359
01:33:19,421 --> 01:33:20,503
[SPEAKER_10]: They have some screenshots.

1360
01:33:20,563 --> 01:33:21,885
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks pretty sweet.

1361
01:33:22,025 --> 01:33:24,989
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can download the PC and the mobile version for that.

1362
01:33:25,069 --> 01:33:25,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

1363
01:33:25,790 --> 01:33:27,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a matter of time before Nintendo shuts them down, right?

1364
01:33:28,114 --> 01:33:29,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Why doesn't Nintendo get into cell phone gaming?

1365
01:33:29,716 --> 01:33:29,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I...

1366
01:33:31,431 --> 01:33:32,352
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1367
01:33:58,130 --> 01:34:00,512
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was somewhat pleased.

1368
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:09,018
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still not as good as a Game Boy Advance version of it, but, you know, I'm... Now, this homebrew version is actually a remake of number one.

1369
01:34:09,578 --> 01:34:11,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, yeah, I'd heard that, that it was a remake of number one.

1370
01:34:11,299 --> 01:34:11,760
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

1371
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:14,201
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, one other quick story on mobile gaming.

1372
01:34:14,241 --> 01:34:14,842
[SPEAKER_09]: This is interesting.

1373
01:34:15,862 --> 01:34:21,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you know that women in gaming don't get a whole lot of coverage sometimes.

1374
01:34:21,306 --> 01:34:24,628
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a controversial subject, you know, are they really into games, da-da-da-da-da.

1375
01:34:25,149 --> 01:34:25,349
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

1376
01:34:25,802 --> 01:34:28,744
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1377
01:34:51,007 --> 01:34:52,688
[SPEAKER_09]: because they don't know what a good game is.

1378
01:35:22,388 --> 01:35:22,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1379
01:35:24,029 --> 01:35:24,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1380
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:25,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you think that is?

1381
01:35:25,711 --> 01:35:36,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because, you know, cell phone games are easy to pick up or that maybe the games they put out on cell phones tend to be more puzzle games, pop cap type of games that reach the non-gamer in general.

1382
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:39,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just women, but the non-gamer in general.

1383
01:35:39,502 --> 01:35:42,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, obviously not all women are non-gamers.

1384
01:35:42,965 --> 01:35:46,888
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one that co-hosts this show and, you know, we're talking about, you know,

1385
01:35:47,861 --> 01:35:53,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus those cell phone games are very simple, so then women can understand them.

1386
01:35:53,045 --> 01:35:54,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's not just one, but the non-gamer.

1387
01:35:54,807 --> 01:35:55,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Women.

1388
01:35:55,407 --> 01:35:55,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1389
01:35:57,108 --> 01:35:57,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Hate mail coming in.

1390
01:35:58,229 --> 01:35:59,951
[SPEAKER_09]: You can address those cards and letters to Shane.

1391
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:02,413
[SPEAKER_09]: He doesn't have an Orange Tantra to account, though.

1392
01:36:02,433 --> 01:36:04,074
[SPEAKER_09]: We won't give him one after that, that's for sure.

1393
01:36:06,316 --> 01:36:07,056
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's interesting, though?

1394
01:36:07,076 --> 01:36:11,680
[SPEAKER_09]: I was mentioning before Nintendo will probably shut that Zelda thing down, but they're really not in cell phone gaming.

1395
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:16,444
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems like if Nintendo's trying to make this real, you know, we want to reach all the non-gamers...

1396
01:36:17,111 --> 01:36:20,112
[SPEAKER_09]: This should be evidence to them that maybe they ought to get into mobile gaming.

1397
01:36:20,152 --> 01:36:26,755
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, again, am not a big fan of mobile gaming, but I would think it would be kind of cool if I could play Ice Climber on my cell phone or something.

1398
01:36:26,876 --> 01:36:27,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1399
01:36:27,276 --> 01:36:28,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1400
01:36:29,277 --> 01:36:29,997
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think?

1401
01:36:31,001 --> 01:36:34,365
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to open up the Skype line right now if you guys want to call in on any subject really.

1402
01:36:34,405 --> 01:36:38,050
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a question or comment or whatever you want to say, our Skype line is open.

1403
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:41,234
[SPEAKER_09]: For more information, go to www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1404
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:42,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on Interact With Us.

1405
01:36:43,016 --> 01:36:45,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you can always give us a call on our normal phone line.

1406
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:45,880
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 916-226-9067.

1407
01:36:49,003 --> 01:36:53,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, kids, that it might be a toll call if you don't live next door to us.

1408
01:36:54,725 --> 01:36:57,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls, do you have any quick last-minute stories, anybody?

1409
01:36:59,266 --> 01:36:59,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, no.

1410
01:37:00,186 --> 01:37:03,167
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, I don't know, I think this is kind of interesting.

1411
01:37:03,547 --> 01:37:15,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to look up and see what my phone had, but unfortunately, I am stupid, and I don't know what kind of... I know I have a Samsung phone, but the model number is... something I don't know.

1412
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:17,771
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, yeah, that makes it tough.

1413
01:37:18,986 --> 01:37:20,607
[SPEAKER_10]: GK128 My grandmother lives off of shitty pogo games.

1414
01:37:20,627 --> 01:37:22,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Their simplicity and fun to non-gamers is the draw.

1415
01:37:22,328 --> 01:37:25,390
[SPEAKER_09]: If Nintendo wants women to get into gaming, they need to come out with a vacuum controller.

1416
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:26,151
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are horrible.

1417
01:37:47,853 --> 01:37:49,374
[SPEAKER_06]: We're only speaking the truth.

1418
01:37:50,475 --> 01:37:56,580
[SPEAKER_09]: The views and opinions expressed by Miklatov are not necessarily those of the rest of us.

1419
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1420
01:37:58,502 --> 01:37:58,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1421
01:37:59,883 --> 01:38:04,227
[SPEAKER_09]: You should know by now who it is as much as I call every single week.

1422
01:38:04,327 --> 01:38:06,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, we get the same callers every week.

1423
01:38:06,408 --> 01:38:08,370
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I have to say this though, callers.

1424
01:38:09,571 --> 01:38:14,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I lurk sometimes on some message forums that people don't know I lurk on.

1425
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:17,817
[SPEAKER_09]: and I saw some people talking smack about Orange Lounge Radio.

1426
01:38:20,142 --> 01:38:21,805
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what they say the weak point of the show is?

1427
01:38:23,349 --> 01:38:24,231
[SPEAKER_09]: The call-in segments.

1428
01:38:26,047 --> 01:38:30,510
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, we open up this show to folks to call in because we want it to be your show.

1429
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:32,971
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to be here and be all, oh, we're better than you, da-da-da.

1430
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:34,432
[SPEAKER_09]: We want this to be your show as well.

1431
01:38:35,033 --> 01:38:38,395
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just want you guys to know, people on the interweb are talking shit about you.

1432
01:38:38,475 --> 01:38:39,035
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's okay.

1433
01:38:39,055 --> 01:38:41,997
[SPEAKER_09]: They talk shit about DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all the time as well.

1434
01:38:42,037 --> 01:38:42,698
[SPEAKER_09]: So what can you do?

1435
01:38:43,018 --> 01:38:43,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck them.

1436
01:38:43,438 --> 01:38:44,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay because I got your back, so.

1437
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:45,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1438
01:38:45,559 --> 01:38:46,220
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll protect us.

1439
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:47,080
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, Ranma?

1440
01:38:47,941 --> 01:38:48,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much.

1441
01:38:48,421 --> 01:38:50,022
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple of things I want to talk about.

1442
01:38:50,122 --> 01:38:52,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, as you brought up about people talking smack,

1443
01:38:53,502 --> 01:38:58,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember from Anime Next they had a group there called otakugeneration.net doing a podcast.

1444
01:38:58,965 --> 01:39:02,167
[SPEAKER_07]: They gave me their card and I said, hey, have you heard of Orange Dogs Radio?

1445
01:39:02,488 --> 01:39:06,470
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the guys said, yeah, I've heard of them, but their show isn't all that good.

1446
01:39:06,730 --> 01:39:09,792
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, well, I am close friends with the staff.

1447
01:39:10,393 --> 01:39:10,993
[SPEAKER_07]: He did a 180.

1448
01:39:11,053 --> 01:39:12,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh, their show is great.

1449
01:39:12,394 --> 01:39:13,194
[SPEAKER_07]: They're awesome.

1450
01:39:13,435 --> 01:39:13,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't hurt me.

1451
01:39:17,321 --> 01:39:18,683
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, though?

1452
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:22,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think indie podcasters should be bashing on each other.

1453
01:39:22,268 --> 01:39:23,349
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's a smart move.

1454
01:39:23,409 --> 01:39:25,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the indie podcasters should be coming together.

1455
01:39:26,594 --> 01:39:27,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never listened to that program.

1456
01:39:27,936 --> 01:39:29,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know anybody over that program.

1457
01:39:30,139 --> 01:39:30,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1458
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I have nothing bad to say about them because I wouldn't.

1459
01:39:32,402 --> 01:39:34,883
[SPEAKER_09]: If I did have something bad to say about them, I wouldn't say it at all.

1460
01:39:35,183 --> 01:39:41,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think indie podcasters have to work together because we have to work against corporate dollars and all this corporate stuff.

1461
01:39:42,046 --> 01:39:45,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, reminds me about the whole podcast awards thing.

1462
01:39:45,508 --> 01:39:47,769
[SPEAKER_09]: The nominations are open right now for the podcast awards.

1463
01:39:48,889 --> 01:40:15,209
[SPEAKER_09]: PodcastWords.com obviously we would love it if you would consider nominating us again in the gaming podcast category but honestly guys as long as an independent podcaster wins it I'm happy and across the board and I encourage you to nominate other independent podcasters in the other categories as well this is how we get the word of mouth out and I think independent podcasters should be working on promoting each other not cutting each other down because then that's when the corporates will just sneak through and win

1464
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:21,957
[SPEAKER_09]: I have plenty of bad things I can say about corporate podcasts, but I try not to be negative.

1465
01:40:22,017 --> 01:40:22,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, sorry.

1466
01:40:23,339 --> 01:40:23,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Tangent.

1467
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:24,340
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

1468
01:40:24,381 --> 01:40:24,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Your call.

1469
01:40:24,841 --> 01:40:25,402
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

1470
01:40:26,023 --> 01:40:27,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Send me a bunch of cards.

1471
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:28,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Otacon is like in a month.

1472
01:40:29,047 --> 01:40:29,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll pass them out.

1473
01:40:30,128 --> 01:40:30,428
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1474
01:40:31,069 --> 01:40:33,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there's any haters, I want you to cut them for me.

1475
01:40:34,525 --> 01:40:34,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

1476
01:40:35,205 --> 01:40:36,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, what else is on your mind, Ranma?

1477
01:40:36,845 --> 01:40:40,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, there's a couple of things I spoke with Jamie about that I didn't get to tell you guys.

1478
01:40:41,086 --> 01:40:46,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there was talk some time back about older Super NES games that you had a load time.

1479
01:40:47,368 --> 01:40:48,688
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of them was Street Fighter Alpha 2.

1480
01:40:48,868 --> 01:40:50,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1481
01:40:50,368 --> 01:40:53,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there's another game I remember renting from the video store.

1482
01:40:54,029 --> 01:40:55,629
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Batman Returns.

1483
01:40:55,829 --> 01:40:59,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time you went to the next level, it went to black and it said, now loading.

1484
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:02,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Two minutes later, I'm in the next level.

1485
01:41:02,251 --> 01:41:02,831
[SPEAKER_09]: For real?

1486
01:41:03,604 --> 01:41:03,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1487
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:07,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, I thought I played the Batman Returns game too.

1488
01:41:07,106 --> 01:41:08,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that like a Final Fight type game?

1489
01:41:09,688 --> 01:41:13,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of, but it was like really stick figure-ish like Streak of Rage.

1490
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:14,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh.

1491
01:41:16,011 --> 01:41:16,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1492
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:20,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, it wasn't, again, it was one of those movie franchise games that wasn't that great.

1493
01:41:20,774 --> 01:41:23,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Most movie franchise games kind of suck.

1494
01:41:23,436 --> 01:41:25,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Most, but there are, you know, some that stand out.

1495
01:41:25,197 --> 01:41:27,238
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, okay, well that's,

1496
01:41:27,901 --> 01:41:28,821
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1497
01:41:52,981 --> 01:41:54,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Parasol Stars.

1498
01:41:54,602 --> 01:41:55,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

1499
01:41:55,583 --> 01:41:58,045
[SPEAKER_09]: TurboGrafx-16, baby!

1500
01:41:58,085 --> 01:41:59,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've played Parasol Stars.

1501
01:41:59,546 --> 01:42:01,828
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep forgetting that's technically in the Bubble Bobble world.

1502
01:42:02,169 --> 01:42:04,991
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they had a version of Parasol Stars, I want to say, on Nintendo as well.

1503
01:42:05,071 --> 01:42:06,292
[SPEAKER_09]: It was crap, but it was there.

1504
01:42:06,973 --> 01:42:07,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you serious?

1505
01:42:07,833 --> 01:42:08,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say.

1506
01:42:08,634 --> 01:42:08,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1507
01:42:09,555 --> 01:42:12,077
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have been one of those really bad Asian hacks.

1508
01:42:12,097 --> 01:42:17,461
[SPEAKER_10]: You know they're releasing Bubble Bobble Revolution and Rainbow Islands Revolution for the DS pretty soon.

1509
01:42:18,682 --> 01:42:19,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Must have this now.

1510
01:42:19,823 --> 01:42:19,903
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1511
01:42:22,731 --> 01:42:24,933
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as Parasol Stars is in there, I'll buy it.

1512
01:42:25,113 --> 01:42:25,314
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1513
01:42:25,414 --> 01:42:25,894
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not.

1514
01:42:26,515 --> 01:42:28,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish they would put these games in as unlocks.

1515
01:42:28,277 --> 01:42:32,281
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I made sad faces when Salamander wasn't in the Gradius Collections.

1516
01:42:32,301 --> 01:42:34,783
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys know it as Life Force if you don't deal with the importance.

1517
01:42:34,803 --> 01:42:35,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Life Force.

1518
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:36,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's like one of the best ones.

1519
01:42:36,865 --> 01:42:38,067
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not in the collection.

1520
01:42:38,087 --> 01:42:38,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I agree.

1521
01:42:38,527 --> 01:42:38,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad.

1522
01:42:39,693 --> 01:42:46,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami Bad Konami

1523
01:43:03,717 --> 01:43:09,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Loki, you talked about last week how the anime video games aren't doing as successful as expected.

1524
01:43:09,899 --> 01:43:11,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you one of the reasons why.

1525
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:26,785
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the reasons is because some of these games are already being played on import at anime cons, and then when these companies bring them over, the main thing that the fans complain about, they want the Japanese voices, and they are originally taken out.

1526
01:43:26,986 --> 01:43:29,707
[SPEAKER_07]: They take them all out, and the fans don't really want to buy them.

1527
01:43:29,887 --> 01:43:30,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, stop doing that.

1528
01:43:33,098 --> 01:43:35,180
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they do in Soul Calibur.

1529
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:36,241
[SPEAKER_07]: You can pick between the two.

1530
01:43:37,042 --> 01:43:38,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that, especially Toshinden 3.

1531
01:43:38,423 --> 01:43:39,904
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of my all-time favorites.

1532
01:43:41,366 --> 01:43:45,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I got Naruto, but Ninja, and I'm dealing with half the voices.

1533
01:43:45,509 --> 01:43:46,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, come on.

1534
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:51,715
[SPEAKER_07]: When they did that half-assed Inuyasha fighting game, you had the option of Japanese and English voices.

1535
01:43:51,955 --> 01:43:55,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when they did the 2D fighter from PS1, they threw us a bone.

1536
01:43:55,598 --> 01:43:56,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, come on.

1537
01:43:56,299 --> 01:43:56,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go for it.

1538
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:57,380
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1539
01:43:57,768 --> 01:43:59,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Ranma, this call's running long.

1540
01:43:59,069 --> 01:43:59,869
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to let you go, buddy.

1541
01:43:59,909 --> 01:44:00,849
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to get some other folks in.

1542
01:44:00,869 --> 01:44:01,810
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you so much for the call.

1543
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:02,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, okay?

1544
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:02,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, no problem.

1545
01:44:02,770 --> 01:44:03,991
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of took up most of your time.

1546
01:44:04,031 --> 01:44:04,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

1547
01:44:05,011 --> 01:44:05,392
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

1548
01:44:05,412 --> 01:44:05,672
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

1549
01:44:05,732 --> 01:44:06,272
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good.

1550
01:44:06,412 --> 01:44:06,612
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1551
01:44:06,632 --> 01:44:07,453
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on every week anyway.

1552
01:44:07,493 --> 01:44:07,693
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1553
01:44:07,713 --> 01:44:07,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

1554
01:44:10,290 --> 01:44:11,531
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Skype line's open.

1555
01:44:11,551 --> 01:44:12,593
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll take one more call.

1556
01:44:13,073 --> 01:44:16,037
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have a lot of time for a lot of calls tonight, so one more call.

1557
01:44:16,057 --> 01:44:17,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's someone else who calls in every week.

1558
01:44:17,598 --> 01:44:18,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1559
01:44:18,679 --> 01:44:19,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1560
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:20,041
[SPEAKER_05]: RavensDolphin.

1561
01:44:20,281 --> 01:44:21,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, what's on your mind, RavensDolphin?

1562
01:44:22,203 --> 01:44:22,624
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing.

1563
01:44:22,884 --> 01:44:24,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like online rental games?

1564
01:44:25,047 --> 01:44:26,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you mentioned about pre-ordering.

1565
01:44:27,129 --> 01:44:29,411
[SPEAKER_05]: How about going to the next stream, online rental?

1566
01:44:30,192 --> 01:44:31,053
[SPEAKER_05]: GameFly GameFly

1567
01:44:48,595 --> 01:44:50,856
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard for me to comment on it because I haven't really used it first hand.

1568
01:44:51,056 --> 01:44:52,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want to comment on something I haven't used.

1569
01:44:52,836 --> 01:44:59,077
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's something I... If I cancel my Netflix, which I'm probably going to, I will probably shift over to Gamefly.

1570
01:44:59,357 --> 01:45:01,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I just play more games than I watch movies.

1571
01:45:02,678 --> 01:45:03,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I just really do.

1572
01:45:03,518 --> 01:45:04,058
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

1573
01:45:04,078 --> 01:45:04,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you use it?

1574
01:45:05,878 --> 01:45:08,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I just signed up today and I'm just trying it out.

1575
01:45:08,899 --> 01:45:10,339
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think so far?

1576
01:45:10,559 --> 01:45:13,400
[SPEAKER_09]: How is the setup online and everything and the ease of getting started?

1577
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:14,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen.

1578
01:45:16,124 --> 01:45:16,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Super seamless.

1579
01:45:17,245 --> 01:45:19,886
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do is just create your game queue and they'll send it to you.

1580
01:45:20,366 --> 01:45:20,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlimited.

1581
01:45:21,406 --> 01:45:23,687
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I like because games are getting expensive.

1582
01:45:23,948 --> 01:45:25,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony wants to put $100 to $50 per game now.

1583
01:45:29,291 --> 01:45:36,256
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be very interesting to see what the online rental market is going to do to some of the game ideas.

1584
01:45:36,997 --> 01:45:40,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess this kind of stuff is getting bigger and bigger, so interesting.

1585
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,061
[SPEAKER_09]: I am tempted to check it out.

1586
01:45:43,482 --> 01:45:45,904
[SPEAKER_09]: We do a podcast that lots of people listen to.

1587
01:45:45,964 --> 01:45:47,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't one of these companies give us a free one?

1588
01:45:49,062 --> 01:45:51,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, maybe that's just my ego getting in the way, I guess.

1589
01:45:52,664 --> 01:45:57,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I might check it out, but again, I don't want to have that and Netflix, although I have a friend that has them both.

1590
01:45:57,706 --> 01:46:02,068
[SPEAKER_09]: A coworker of mine uses it and seems to like it, so I'll check it out one of these days.

1591
01:46:02,948 --> 01:46:04,229
[SPEAKER_09]: But for now, I'm more of a collector.

1592
01:46:04,469 --> 01:46:11,772
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet if DarkSakura would hear, that would be her angle on it, is that she likes to collect them, so she likes to own them and actually have them.

1593
01:46:12,503 --> 01:46:19,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I am very glad to say I do know one that does rent Legend games, but I can't remember it.

1594
01:46:20,485 --> 01:46:20,785
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1595
01:46:21,365 --> 01:46:21,846
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, buddy.

1596
01:46:21,866 --> 01:46:22,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thanks for the call.

1597
01:46:22,746 --> 01:46:23,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, okay?

1598
01:46:24,446 --> 01:46:24,966
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1599
01:46:25,086 --> 01:46:25,326
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1600
01:46:25,366 --> 01:46:26,887
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you later.

1601
01:46:28,087 --> 01:46:28,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1602
01:46:28,527 --> 01:46:28,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

1603
01:46:30,828 --> 01:46:31,928
[SPEAKER_10]: I found something interesting.

1604
01:46:32,068 --> 01:46:34,249
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

1605
01:46:34,329 --> 01:46:37,230
[SPEAKER_10]: I found a picture of an Xbox 360.

1606
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:37,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

1607
01:46:38,826 --> 01:46:48,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Motherboard, and they're saying that it's going to get an HDMI out upgrade, and that they're putting an HDMI out port right next to the... Wait, no, bad, I already have an Xbox.

1608
01:46:48,792 --> 01:46:49,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Well... Shit!

1609
01:46:50,013 --> 01:46:51,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So that, this is on Kotaku.

1610
01:46:51,874 --> 01:46:57,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go trade them into GameStop, and then we can put that credit towards a new one.

1611
01:46:57,317 --> 01:47:04,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that I really need an HDMI out, but I think that's kind of interesting that they have that on there.

1612
01:47:04,861 --> 01:47:05,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1613
01:47:05,762 --> 01:47:07,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, any more stories anybody has?

1614
01:47:07,783 --> 01:47:08,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

1615
01:47:08,737 --> 01:47:09,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have anything.

1616
01:47:12,039 --> 01:47:13,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I have anything either.

1617
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:18,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then I think we're going to go ahead and wrap it up, so let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1618
01:47:19,182 --> 01:47:20,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane, thank you for sitting in with us tonight.

1619
01:47:20,883 --> 01:47:23,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed you actually put World of Warcraft away at some point.

1620
01:47:23,664 --> 01:47:26,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was annoying to play and listen to people.

1621
01:47:26,485 --> 01:47:27,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry we ruined your night.

1622
01:47:28,346 --> 01:47:28,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thought.

1623
01:47:30,187 --> 01:47:31,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Women shouldn't be allowed to vote.

1624
01:47:34,244 --> 01:47:36,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Loki, your final thought.

1625
01:47:36,645 --> 01:47:41,047
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is actually the official statement from Sony regarding the Apple logo on their site.

1626
01:47:41,567 --> 01:47:53,291
[SPEAKER_10]: In a recent update to PlayStation 3's section of the US PlayStation.com website, an external error was made during the upload process, and the Apple icon was mistakenly placed on the site.

1627
01:47:53,611 --> 01:47:56,913
[SPEAKER_10]: We immediately fixed the problem and apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

1628
01:47:57,793 --> 01:47:58,753
[SPEAKER_10]: They copied!

1629
01:47:59,074 --> 01:48:01,755
[SPEAKER_10]: They stole it from somebody, but they're not copping to it.

1630
01:48:01,795 --> 01:48:02,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony bad, Sony.

1631
01:48:04,391 --> 01:48:06,252
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I want ice cream.

1632
01:48:06,952 --> 01:48:13,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting independent video game radio.

1633
01:48:13,354 --> 01:48:14,335
[SPEAKER_09]: We really appreciate it.

1634
01:48:14,375 --> 01:48:15,315
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are awesome.

1635
01:48:15,335 --> 01:48:16,155
[SPEAKER_09]: We love our fans.

1636
01:48:16,455 --> 01:48:17,336
[SPEAKER_09]: We love our chatters.

1637
01:48:17,376 --> 01:48:19,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, chat room, for tuning in and listening tonight.

1638
01:48:19,436 --> 01:48:20,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Nominate us.

1639
01:48:20,597 --> 01:48:20,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.

1640
01:48:21,557 --> 01:48:23,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have something I'm supposed to say on there.

1641
01:48:23,818 --> 01:48:24,478
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

1642
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:24,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1643
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:26,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate Sky is Cool.

1644
01:48:27,509 --> 01:48:29,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what I was supposed to say.

1645
01:48:29,050 --> 01:48:34,854
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't cut that out like you want to.

1646
01:48:35,094 --> 01:48:35,595
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1647
01:48:36,595 --> 01:48:37,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great week, everybody.

1648
01:48:37,736 --> 01:48:40,638
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

1649
01:48:40,818 --> 01:48:43,400
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back on our normal time taping next week on Sunday.

[SPEAKER_09]: All three of us will be here.

1651
01:48:44,821 --> 01:48:45,521
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be a blast.

1652
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:46,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for tuning in.

1653
01:48:46,842 --> 01:48:47,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, no Part B this week.

1654
01:48:51,085 --> 01:48:53,307
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
