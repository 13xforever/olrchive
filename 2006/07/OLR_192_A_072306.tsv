13994	28909	Tonight, July 23rd, 2006, details on PSP updates from Comic-Con, World of Warcraft undergoes controversial changes in its expansion, and brace yourselves for Animal Crossing the Movie.
32433	33714	Yes, they're controversial, Andrew.
34946	35306	Mobile
55000	55621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
83337	87741	Loki is also here, our tech master Loki That was a horrible joke I know How you doing?
88161	96628	I'm doing okay And also our very special guest, or spatial guest taking up space Say hello to Andrew Loktar, bitches How you doing?
97228	109138	For the Horde We're here to talk about video game news that doesn't suck Sometimes we talk about sucky news This is actually a little bit of a slow news week So we might have some news of suck tonight I don't know, we'll see
109768	110248	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
131295	132116	Just the same ones you own?
132196	133236	Just the same ones I own.
133256	138299	I played a lot of Last Action Hero today, except it's really hot in the garage and I wanted to die.
138860	142922	So I went back in and tried not to become a corpse since I had to do the show today.
143523	143863	Gotcha.
143903	144963	And I played with Legos last night.
145063	145944	But you baked cookies.
146264	146784	I baked cookies.
146885	149186	Amongst your boredom, so that's great.
149206	151187	I did, and my cookies are made of awesome and win.
153589	154089	And chocolate.
155170	158612	You could almost make a sequel to the Milkshake song out of that.
159192	160813	My cookies are made of awesome and win, man.
191459	193960	I haven't played any Blades of the Angels this week, jackass.
194040	194480	Wow!
194500	194660	Wow!
194900	196001	Did you finally get rid of it?
196261	196761	No, not yet.
196801	198942	I still have to finish it, even though it sucks.
199522	210246	So, I played more Grand Theft Auto, because that's awesome, and actually I'm going to be cleaning out some of my games here pretty soon, so I do need to finish Blades of the Angels, because that's got to go back.
210907	214028	Also, I'm selling back Katamari, me and my Katamari.
214128	214288	Just
215034	215874	I'm bored of that game.
215974	217355	But it's so cute and fun!
217455	219015	It's so cute, but who cares?
219615	220595	You know, I don't care.
221175	225016	But anyways, other than that, what else did I play?
225036	233218	I think I played a little bit more Ridge Racer and... Oh, I watched Nelly play Cloning Clyde.
233598	235359	Because I play more Frogger, too.
236167	236567	Unlock that TV.
236587	237567	What's cloning client all about?
237587	239488	Because I didn't have time to really download it and check it out.
239628	241668	You've been watching her play and you have no idea what's going on.
241688	245189	Yeah, but I've been watching her play it from the couch while I'm watching TV.
245609	249350	So it looks like it's basically solving puzzles.
249410	254171	You have to kill all these robots in the level before you're allowed to exit.
254191	256091	And they have 20 different levels or so.
256751	262772	And you basically can clone yourself as well as be able to transform into different things.
262852	264813	Plus it has exploding chickens that you get to kick.
265453	266834	So, um, that's really fun.
266994	269756	Well, I always wanted to play a game where I can kick chickens, that's great.
270036	275020	Exactly, but, um, you know, it's nice to see that they're actually putting out some new, um, live arcade games.
276101	284607	And, I don't know, um, I was trying to get a hold of the Saints Row demo, but I haven't made it over to, like, a GameStop or something to pre-order the game yet.
285107	291632	But apparently it did pop up on the German server for a little bit, and some people were able to nab it before it
292452	300838	One of my instant message buddies said he got a copy of the September magazine, original Xbox, whatever it's called, magazine, and it's in there.
301579	304381	I didn't know it was out yet, but I'll pick that one up instead then.
304761	305242	There you go.
306342	308424	Orange Lounge Radio, helping you find what you need.
308764	309264	Exactly.
309825	310165	Anything else?
311446	312847	That's about it, I think.
313407	314628	GameTap Service Rehab
334093	334613	GameTap Upgraded
362383	364205	And some of the games they picked are really random.
364225	371911	You can kind of tell that they're sort of testing this right now because a lot of the games are not two-player simultaneous games.
372391	376655	They're games like Pac-Man, which is one of the most popular multiplayer games on there right now, is Pac-Man.
376935	380638	You know, and the way multiplayer Pac-Man works is like I play, then you play, then I play.
380658	381579	You know, it kind of trades off.
381919	388405	But they do have some same-time multiplayer games on there right now, like Joust.
390422	402086	And so that's pretty exciting because that means that, you know, this is probably the first step in the direction of Street Fighter 2, other popular two-player arcade games, you know, in the future.
403246	406147	My only complaint about the whole thing is that it was a really weird setup.
406187	413509	Like, it took a minute for me to figure out, okay, what's the difference between being an orange name and clicking on instant match and being, you know...
414022	415643	GameTap has that technology and is likely to move forward.
442952	443893	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
460443	464426	GameTap needed something like that to justify why you should pay for it
481599	482600	Thanks for watching!
502755	504857	I hope that's not a bad sign.
504897	508100	I hope their business is doing well, but I think things like this will help.
508360	512624	And I think if they ever are able to get it working on Macs, that's going to be a huge help, too.
512944	513765	It'll be a huge, huge help.
514286	516548	So, anyway, that was pretty much my gaming week.
516688	521873	And I do, you know, I've talked a lot of positive things about it, but I really do recommend it, and I enjoy it.
522153	522553	What, Loki?
522613	528338	Yeah, like, because if they got that working on Macs, that would, you know, multiply the amount of games that Mac can play by, like, 100.
530069	530489	It would.
530589	531410	It actually would.
531830	532650	It'd be pretty cool.
534071	545416	No, seriously though, you know, you give Macs a hard time, but okay, obviously one of the things that people always say is you can't really play as many games on a Mac, so having GameTap would be a pretty cool little upgrade, so it really would.
545436	546997	Alright, Andrew, how was your gaming week?
547977	548397	Not bad.
548417	555401	I was getting in some World of Warcraft on the test servers, testing out the new Rogue Talent Review.
556321	557301	Pretty impressed by that.
558022	558182	Um...
558880	563101	Also took the time to finish up Tales of Legendia, an English program.
563141	569183	Still pissed off that they never took the time to do voice acting for the second half of the game.
570403	571463	Good game there, Namco.
572604	575665	Also starting to get into Wild Arms 3, which is a pretty decent RPG.
576045	576465	Recommended.
578025	579606	That's about all that I've done this week.
582305	605634	We have some folks in our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat talking about the whole GameTap thing, talking about it there Some love there for Joust, two player simultaneous there from VXJasonXV Yuri Lover wants to know when GameTap's going to get multiplayer Ridge Racer Something tells me that, well they do have other Kill it with fire They do have, I know that joke is kind of like really old now
606396	609878	They do have other Namco games on there, but I don't know if that would really work.
610638	613019	PlayStation's not one of the systems they emulate right now.
613079	614100	They have Dreamcasts.
614200	614540	I don't know.
614960	617682	If you're emulating Dreamcasts, why not emulate Soul Calibur?
618542	619983	My God, would that not be... There we go.
620383	623684	My God, do you know how many freaking GameTap subscriptions that would sell right there?
624245	625045	But I don't know.
625125	626726	Maybe it's just too much of a pain in the ass.
626786	627146	Who knows?
628166	630047	Like I said, I'm hoping it's the start of something good.
630808	632288	And then they're talking a little bit about...
634304	635265	versus GameTap.
635285	643072	VidPower says, so GameTap is like Xbox Live Arcade now, but then RSF says GameTap and Xbox Live Arcade are different business models, which is true.
643633	654143	GameTap doesn't have achievements either, and it doesn't have voice chat, but at the same time, you pay one flat fee for access to 500 some odd games, whereas...
655197	657158	Xbox Live Arcade, you're paying $5, $10 a game.
657578	658778	So it's just a different business model.
658798	659698	It depends whatever you like.
659798	667801	So I think that's probably the direction GameTab is going in, but that's not really a big surprise because, you know, Xbox Live is successful.
667881	669821	Who wouldn't want a little piece of that business?
670261	670541	I don't know.
672162	672482	All right.
672502	675823	Oh, Jada2006 agrees that Soul Calibur would be awesome.
676363	676783	So there you go.
677703	678023	All right.
678083	681784	We're going to go and get into some news now, some gaming news.
681884	683925	So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
684349	689850	Yes, and what a perfect way to start us off by talking about the PSP and how there's going to be yet another firmware upgrade.
690751	692271	And this one's going to be 2.8.
692511	707815	It's going to add video RSS feeds, so you can download those wonderful video podcasts out there, as well as a bunch of other fun stuff, probably security things to prevent you from running homebrew and all that wonderful stuff up.
708376	713239	This was also coming from Comic Con 2006, which they're kind of displaying some of the stuff right now.
713499	727806	Some of the other things that are actually happening, they were showing off some of their brand new Sony Kinect stuff where they're going to try to get it where you can download movies to your PSP's memory stick there.
727986	730648	Seeing as they won't be selling UMDs much longer, it makes sense.
730668	732149	Well, you know, they were saying that there's 350 UMD...
737507	740748	I think downloadable movies is a smart move right now.
740808	742008	They're going to do it.
742349	742849	Why not?
743769	747390	I don't think I will use it that much, but you never know.
748531	751452	I travel a lot, as you guys have been listening to this show a while now.
751712	755673	It might be kind of tempting to download a movie before I go on the plane next time.
755993	760475	One of the other things that's coming with that firmware update as well
761050	765012	is there going to be including a demo of World Tour Soccer 2?
766473	769394	I guess if you're excited about that.
769954	774517	That makes the grand total of demos that they've put out so far to a whopping two or three.
775757	777098	That's pretty pathetic.
778419	782401	I would think you would want to put tons of demos out there so that they buy your games.
782881	786503	I do think Sony's making a bit of a mistake with that, but I don't know.
786523	786963	You look at Xbox 360...
789656	791558	Marketplace, and so, so many demos.
792740	794261	Some good news, though.
794542	796464	Video ad is something that they're working on right now.
797065	803592	One thing they aren't working on, though, is improving the text entry system on there and no plans for a first-party keyboard.
804914	806576	So, yeah, that sucks.
807025	808766	So all this was announced at Comic-Con, right?
808886	809106	Yeah.
809166	810327	So what was Sony doing there?
810347	814549	Well, Comic-Con's become almost like... It's become like Nerd-Con, hasn't it?
814569	815089	Exactly.
815169	822874	It's less of comics and more of, here's what's coming out movies, here's what's coming out comics, here's what's coming out toys, games.
823314	825515	But in a way, doesn't comics kind of tie into all that?
825935	827416	Like, comics ties into movies.
827596	832479	A lot of the big, grossing movies lately have been comic book-based, like Batman Begins was an awesome movie.
832779	833279	Yeah.
833399	834660	And then, you know, same thing with games.
834720	838902	A lot of games based off comic book franchises as well, usually because of the movies, but, you know.
839322	842103	Well, exactly, but it's just, it's become a huge nerd fest, so.
842123	843944	I don't know, that's kind of neat.
843964	846525	Yeah, it's funny, because I was telling my friend the other day, I want to go to Comic Con.
846545	847085	He's like, why?
847145	848066	You don't read comic books.
848126	851868	I'm like, well, but there's cool stuff.
853188	853868	Exactly.
854509	856290	So, yeah, that's something to look forward to.
856490	859451	However, though, just, you know, for people that aren't in the know,
860222	860863	DevHook
877336	878177	Which is out right now.
878517	881339	They're on version 0.45.
881919	892665	And now that you can actually fully emulate the 2.71 firmware and basically run it with all the functionality of 2.71 as well as homebrew stuff.
892725	896087	And they're also using this to load on custom firmwares as well.
896828	900530	And that on top of the mod chip that's coming out for it.
900850	904533	I mean, how much longer are these firmware updates really going to be a problem?
905893	906894	That's something interesting.
908780	909080	All right.
910180	912682	I'll be interested in the new upgrades, especially for the movie thing.
912802	918185	I might have to buy one movie online just to see what it's like, just to review it for you guys here on Orange Launch Radio.
918205	918505	We'll see.
918765	931372	Well, if I remember correctly, if I read correctly on this, at least this is the case with those, how we talked about last week, how they're including a one gigabyte memory stick and you have four movies that you can download to that.
933446	935967	Apparently the movies aren't full screen, which is really lame.
936367	939768	They're that 320 by whatever on the PSP.
939868	940788	Normal TV ratio.
940848	941488	Yeah, exactly.
941908	942708	That is a little bit of a bummer.
942728	943369	It's really lame.
944269	944709	Not cool.
944969	945289	We'll see.
945809	951611	Well, anyway, speaking of movies, of course, last week on the show we talked about how Target had gotten rid of UMDs from their shelves.
951631	953051	We're in the process of phasing that out.
953462	959051	Well, recently, United Press International spoke to the Senior VP of Marketing at Sony Computer Entertainment.
959351	964399	His name is Peter Dial, and this is what he said, basically, about all this negative press.
964820	967284	It basically comes down to too many releases.
967965	968506	Here's a quote.
968874	976661	We have seen studios cut back on releasing their full content on UMD, as unlike the DVD market, the PSP consumer is targeted.
976981	985289	We are committed to helping the studios better understand our product and our consumer, and will continue to educate them as we evolve and enhance the functionality of the PSP.
987371	994417	So basically it just kind of sounds like they're not saying they're done yet, but I don't know.
994878	1004642	Well, I also think it comes down to a space issue too because those UMDs can't hold a whole lot and to fit more content on top of that, it's tough.
1004802	1006182	It's just you can't really fit it.
1006362	1012505	That and also they're not making a lot of money on UMDs, so why bother putting exclusive content on there in the first place?
1012565	1013725	Why even bother?
1014225	1023709	It's interesting though that the guy referenced the whole fact that the PSP is a targeted market because we were kind of saying that when the PSP first came out and you saw the list of the launch movies that
1023889	1025110	that were coming out for the PSP.
1025130	1032376	It was kind of like, wow, you have a lot of very teenage boy movies coming on PSP, but that, I guess, is the target market.
1032396	1037761	You're not exactly going to sell a bunch of UMDs of Steel Magnolias on PSP.
1038081	1039282	Oh, I would totally buy that movie.
1039342	1040964	Me too, but we'd be the only two.
1041424	1042745	Actually, I wouldn't buy that movie.
1043126	1044227	Okay, then I'd be the only one.
1044247	1045548	You'd be the only one.
1045628	1047269	Just to say I owned it.
1047289	1050632	I'm actually not really that huge on that movie, but just to say I own it.
1050772	1051613	I was excited about it.
1052291	1052751	Death Race 2000
1073561	1073902	Death Race 3000
1096061	1096681	Snakes on a Plane
1118581	1119602	For UMD, I guess.
1120042	1121763	Campaigning to get that released on UMD.
1122264	1123865	So you could actually watch it in a plane.
1124165	1126147	Because you know they're not going to show that as the in-flight movie.
1126887	1127608	That would be funny, though.
1128428	1129369	That would be actually pretty funny.
1129389	1131431	I would fly on an airline that showed that as the in-flight movie.
1131451	1133132	What about movies like Red Eye?
1133192	1134553	I bet Southwest would do something like that.
1135677	1139798	because they're just sort of... Southwest is too poor to show movies.
1139838	1143019	I know, but if they did show a movie... Fly the ghetto skies.
1143199	1156263	But no, if they did show a movie, I bet that'd be one that they would put up right away because they have some snarky people doing their little... Okay, if the plane starts to go down, this probably won't matter because I'll be dead anyway.
1156323	1157843	I said that on one of my flights.
1157923	1160984	I can't remember who is putting out snakes on a plane, but...
1161994	1164615	Can you imagine with the motion picture?
1164635	1167836	You know how they always create a stupid themed ride based on it?
1168077	1170778	We're going to have the snakes on a plain roller coaster at some point.
1171958	1172478	It's awful.
1173419	1175160	Moving on back to games.
1176160	1177000	Ah, who needs them?
1178461	1179521	Well, actually, we do.
1180362	1181762	Yeah, I'd miss my games too much.
1182222	1183463	I love games very much.
1183943	1188185	But at any rate, speaking of a game that I've been stuck on for a little bit,
1188948	1190329	World of Warcraft.
1191769	1197511	Well, you know how you've got Shamans for Horde and Paladins on Alliance?
1197531	1201453	Well, now they're going to be... And nothing will ever change to upset that balance of the force, right?
1202513	1203653	Bullshit!
1204634	1204874	No.
1206374	1211596	They actually are now having Alliance Shamans and Horde Paladins.
1212177	1215858	The new races are going to be pulling them in with the whole...
1216920	1218161	Upgrade for Burning Crusade.
1218261	1220603	There's going to be Blood Off Paladins.
1220683	1224106	There's going to be... I know I'm going to mispronounce... Draenei.
1225327	1225867	Draeno.
1226268	1226588	Draeno.
1226628	1227088	Draeno.
1229450	1232313	Their faces look like something you'd want to use Draeno on, actually.
1232333	1234514	They use the power of unclogging.
1234634	1238117	You know why those particular races were picked, right?
1238518	1240219	And I know Andrew's going to have to comment on this.
1240839	1242040	He's the biggest wow-horn in the room.
1242060	1242701	Let me just get this out.
1242761	1242981	Okay.
1243562	1243662	You...
1244402	1248406	You had to have blood elves on the Horde side because the Horde needed a pretty character.
1248747	1250188	Because everybody on the Horde side is ugly.
1250448	1252490	Some of the zombies are pretty.
1252650	1257816	You needed the Drani people on the Alliance side because the Alliance needed uglies.
1258596	1259657	The Alliance already has uglies.
1260038	1261239	I understand, but you know, it's just...
1265442	1268964	You know what the fish-faced Dranae remind me of?
1269145	1274649	That Kikoman music video thing where they've got the fish-faced creature.
1275190	1276431	That's what it reminds me of.
1278212	1279093	Sorry, did you have more story?
1279133	1279513	I'm sorry.
1280935	1292164	Yes, but if you want to know some of the word behind that, there's actually a post on the World of Warcraft forums where they're giving the background to the decision for doing all that.
1293012	1295975	And apparently there's a forum shitstorm about it.
1296555	1299198	Just talking about how A, it butchers balance.
1299518	1300899	A, it makes things more balanced.
1301280	1306184	They are actually giving certain abilities for each class, though, that are class-specific.
1306864	1309267	And B, they say it's butchering lore, and it's kind of funny how...
1310393	1314537	Most of the people on the forums wouldn't give a damn about lore anyway if we beat them upside the head.
1314677	1316779	Would you call yourself earlier to be a lore whore?
1316799	1317439	I'm a lore whore.
1318000	1324725	Okay, so as the WoW whore, lore whore, the only one in this room with a level 60, what do you personally feel about this whole change?
1325086	1333012	I think we're going to have to wait and see, story-wise, how Metzen decides to write his way into and out of this one, see if it makes sense.
1333533	1335775	Balance-wise, though, I think it's a good change.
1336135	1347684	Horde has been complaining how Shamans have been really underpowered for PvE content, raid content, how all they get to do is heal and lay down totems and don't get any kind of buffs like, say, Blessings like Paladins do.
1348545	1353709	And Alliance has been whining that, oh, we don't have the PvP strength because we don't have Shamans.
1353749	1354130	Guess what?
1354590	1356852	Now you're going to have Shamans and now you're going to have Paladins.
1357412	1358173	Best of both worlds.
1358951	1368376	And you know, the thing is, when that expansion first hits, the servers are going to be inundated with Blood Elf Paladins and Trani, Trani, whatever.
1368476	1370597	That should be the Quit Your Bitching update.
1372438	1373719	Blizzard does a lot of those.
1374139	1378282	I really have two minds about that, though, but I'm hoping it'll be a good thing.
1378322	1383684	I mean, I'll probably play a Blood Elf Paladin, you know, just to do, say I've done it.
1383945	1387887	It's making me seriously reconsider making a Blood Elf Priest and changing him to a Paladin.
1388167	1388307	Hmm.
1389584	1394746	I think everybody is thinking in the back of their mind, depending on whether they play more Horde or more Alliance, which kind of character.
1394766	1398787	I think most of us are Horde players, you know, kind of thinking in the back of our mind what we're going to make our Blood Elf.
1398967	1401688	Like, everybody is going to make one of these new ones.
1401708	1402689	It's just interesting to me.
1402829	1406450	I've already got it set from the start, but I don't want to be a squishy healer.
1408471	1409611	Not on a PvP server.
1409651	1410411	That's what I found out.
1410451	1413933	Being a priest on a PvP server is like asking for a beating.
1413993	1417074	Unless you have a Death Wish or your, for instance, Spect Shadow.
1417754	1418074	Ha ha ha.
1418624	1419425	All right.
1421687	1423208	So when's Burning Crusade coming out?
1423248	1424309	Pretty soon, right?
1424469	1428492	Estimated release date of October, but they'll probably be closer to December.
1429193	1429493	Awesome.
1430674	1437940	Well, Final Fantasy XI, we can't have a WoW story without talking about the other MMO that a lot of us have played on and off.
1437960	1438601	Ah, who gives a crap?
1439141	1439382	I know.
1439402	1443045	I'm a little done with Final Fantasy XI, but this was exciting news.
1443085	1446688	They announced earlier this week that there was a sequel being made to Final Fantasy XI.
1447478	1450721	And that news came out about six or seven days ago.
1450801	1456567	And then a few days later, no, unfortunately, it looks like Squeenix put out a little...
1458309	1465092	As the company announced in May 2005, it is currently developing an online title for next-gen platforms, including game consoles and PCs.
1465192	1469715	However, this title is being developed as a completely new MMORPG.
1470155	1476438	We will disclose further details of this title, including which platforms it's going to be on, immediately after any relevant decisions are made.
1476999	1480361	But they didn't exactly say, we're not doing Final Fantasy XI, too.
1481641	1484202	They're just saying, we're not going to tell you either way.
1484443	1486504	Final Fantasy XIII, another title!
1487204	1490506	Will it involve dress-up, just like that other direct sequel?
1490526	1493588	No, seriously, I think it's going to be... The dress-up was great!
1494028	1495749	Okay, it was all too Charlie's Angels, though.
1496529	1497670	That was what made it great.
1497710	1500251	It was like the ultimate girl Final Fantasy.
1500351	1503773	Legend of Zaku in our chatroom seems to think it's Front Mission Online that they're talking about.
1503793	1504213	That would be awesome!
1504233	1505934	Personally, I think it's going to be Fantasy Earth Online.
1506174	1508756	They had run a couple articles about it last year.
1509537	1512118	How the Enix part of Square Enix was going to do Fantasy Earth.
1513079	1515100	Raven's Dolphin in chat has an interesting perspective.
1515140	1517221	Maybe it's not Final Fantasy XI Part 2.
1517261	1518802	He says Final Fantasy XIV, the MMO.
1518862	1519062	Maybe.
1520303	1520883	God forbid.
1521004	1521284	Maybe.
1521964	1524766	They need to do one called Final Fantasy The End of Things.
1525006	1527567	They said what it was in E3 2005.
1529048	1532410	There was a whole bunch of stuff that was coming out in E3 2005 that wasn't there for 2006.
1533090	1535612	I want to say it was Fantasy.
1535632	1538694	Or it was another MMO not of Final Fantasy.
1538814	1539194	Or just...
1539474	1547197	Well, remember how everybody thought World of Mana was a game and everybody like creamed their pants because it's like, you know, oh my god, Secret of Mana Online, how awesome would that be?
1547557	1549538	And then they were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1549798	1555000	World of Mana is like all these new Mana games where it's a marketing thing, not an actual game.
1555280	1558961	Well, it'll be cool no matter what it is.
1559622	1559902	I don't know.
1561554	1565836	One other thing I just want to mention real quick, Final Fantasy XI is not without any love or upgrades.
1565896	1574260	If you're playing the Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy XI, you may have noticed that you don't get any achievement points for all those hours upon hours that you pour into the game.
1574620	1579822	Well, it looks like Final Fantasy XI will be getting 32 achievements on Xbox.
1579842	1581523	This is thanks to Xbox.com.
1581883	1585425	They're all secret achievements right now, so we don't even know what they are.
1586005	1588006	But if it's 32 achievements, that would be about 30 to 40 points apiece.
1591294	1595717	The rumor is that with the next Final Fantasy XI patch, you will now be able to get achievements.
1595977	1605142	My question is, since I'm a dummy and I haven't canceled my account over there yet and I'm still paying for it, could I just log in with my character and since he's a certain level and done stuff already, am I going to unlock all these achievements suddenly?
1605182	1607504	Assuming that those are what the achievements are for.
1608257	1608777	Yeah, I don't know.
1608817	1609217	Who knows?
1609597	1611938	It could be... Congratulations!
1611958	1613359	You bought a new expansion!
1613499	1614119	Times 32.
1614839	1617000	It could be interesting because they could be... You're right.
1617020	1622861	They could be things relevant to Chocobo Racing or things that are going to be the new things that they put in Final Fantasy XI.
1622881	1625202	The achievements may not even have anything to do with the rest of the game.
1625222	1625762	That would be interesting.
1625782	1627643	Or it could be just stuff like winning a game of Ballista.
1628823	1629323	Possibly.
1630084	1633285	Oh, something that you can do over and over again.
1633705	1633945	Yeah.
1634265	1634385	Hmm.
1635182	1638523	Well, we shall soon see when the next patch goes out to Final Fantasy XI.
1640303	1640803	Excellent.
1641183	1643204	Anyways, another news here.
1647184	1656146	Speaking of Xbox Live, you know how they're doing this Xbox Live Wednesday thing where they're releasing brand new games coming out every Wednesday.
1656166	1659887	In fact, next week we are getting Galaga, which is awesome.
1660920	1664185	and of course after that Street Fighter 2 and after that Pac-Man.
1665346	1669211	But there are going to be about 50 live arcade games by the end of the year, which is great.
1669632	1672656	And this is coming from Major Nelson.
1673957	1675039	And basically...
1676428	1677369	Night of the Round, Golden Axe
1702924	1703965	All those games sound awesome.
1704245	1705726	Yeah, it's going to be pretty awesome.
1705786	1710308	And I know Contra and stuff are going to be coming out as well.
1710548	1711509	Contra and Super Contra.
1712229	1713770	Just all this Luminous Live, of course.
1714190	1717052	So lots of good games to look up before the end of the year.
1717072	1719493	So at least they're going to be supporting live arcade for a while.
1720894	1721214	All righty.
1724810	1729312	One other thing that's going to be coming to Xbox Live pretty soon is a table tennis demo.
1729672	1736535	Rockstar Games confirmed that a table tennis demo is on the way and this was through Major Nelson.
1737215	1746638	Major Nelson blogged, I happen to be down talking to the folks that work with Rockstar and they told me it would be okay for me to mention that there is a demo on its way to the marketplace for table tennis.
1747079	1751680	I also found out that the demo is single and two player but not live play.
1752341	1753421	Live play is kind of, you know,
1753806	1760150	If he gave them everything, I don't know if there'd be much point to buying the game, despite the fact that there are additional characters and arenas and things like that.
1760210	1761151	But this will be good.
1761631	1766114	Folks wanting to find out if they want to spend the money on the game or not, even though it is next-gen budget-priced.
1766675	1766975	Excellent.
1767035	1773039	And speaking of stuff coming in live, I think I mentioned last week Texas Hold'em announced it was going to be free.
1773179	1773939	Actually, that's not the case.
1774800	1779603	It ends up being that they haven't decided on a price point yet, but it's definitely not going to be free.
1780123	1780323	So...
1781502	1787144	Unfortunately, you know, probably, you know, decent price, but no handouts this time, unfortunately.
1788605	1790706	And that was something we reported on last week, right?
1790746	1792967	Yes, it was, that it was going to be free.
1793667	1797228	That was originally the announcement, but apparently not.
1797728	1801330	Apparently they found out, hey, you know what, we can make money off this, so let's do that.
1802458	1807201	All right, well, Microsoft is seeing some pretty good Xbox 360 sales.
1808262	1819569	Microsoft reported that the earnings for its fourth quarter, which ended June 30, 2006, because it's a fiscal year, they got $2.3 billion in profits on revenue of $11.8 billion.
1820330	1825553	Its server and tools division was the fastest growing sector, having $3.18 billion of quarterly income.
1825573	1826353	When you get to Xbox revenue,
1832557	1834499	This would be Xbox and Xbox 360.
1834539	1837401	This increased about $503 million or 129%.
1838362	1841184	Of course, that being attributed to Xbox 360.
1841544	1849550	Now, the home entertainment division, unfortunately for them, had an operating loss of $414 million for the quarter.
1849910	1856735	And they're saying that the biggest reason for this is because they lose money on each Xbox 360 sold.
1858116	1860358	Kind of some interesting profits and stuff.
1860999	1861660	from Microsoft.
1861680	1866002	If you'd like to follow that, or if you own stock in Microsoft, I bet you really want to know about that information.
1883373	1884093	Just one moment, folks.
1884113	1884814	We're getting reorganized.
1887036	1891539	There actually is another game coming out on Xbox 360.
1892139	1903226	Actually, it's more in the realm of the unconfirmed rumor, but it's been stated that Guitar Hero is coming to the Xbox 360.
1903587	1911772	Microsoft hasn't commented yet, but Red Octane is actually working on the PS2 sequel and a 360 version.
1913493	1915915	So, yeah, that's to look forward to.
1917426	1928011	I don't know, it's interesting.
1929292	1929872	What would you think?
1929912	1937697	Do you think that Guitar Hero would see a lot of its fanbase moving over to Xbox with this, or is this just a way for Guitar Hero to expand its fanbase, or what?
1937817	1938037	Both.
1939025	1941226	Online play That would be a huge selling point for Xbox version, that's for sure
1966526	1974111	Well, it's interesting because the story talks about Guitar Hero 2, but in DDR, yeah, the games are similar, but they're not really the same.
1974211	1981296	Ultramix offers completely different types of features than the Extreme and I'm assuming Supernova are going to be offering.
1981357	1984599	So it's kind of, I don't know, it's a little bit apples and oranges to me.
1984859	1989903	I think they could do, I think it would just be different on Xbox or should be different.
1990694	2015088	Definitely, and including, you know, since we're talking about Guitar Hero here, there was actually a MySpace blog post put out by the Guitar Hero team, and it was actually entitled Ghoul's Night Out, which teases a logo to possibly a brand new game with the skull and cross guitars with the title Ghoul, and Ghoul...
2015848	2017748	Looks to be an acronym for something.
2018749	2021749	It's interesting, though, is no one really knows what exactly that means.
2022029	2034132	People are, you know, suspecting maybe it's like a Guitar Hero Online User League or something like that or some sort of, you know, some sort of online play or maybe even the Xbox 360 game.
2034312	2040173	But, of course, right now, nothing more than a logo, nothing more than speculation, so at least they're working on something.
2040253	2042194	Just trying to get the fanboys talking.
2042514	2043774	It's basically, and it's working.
2043894	2044254	Look at us.
2045131	2046012	Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix
2062711	2063131	and so on.
2087779	2092363	And it looked like it had stationary backgrounds, which for a plug-and-play device wouldn't be too surprising.
2092403	2094285	You can't put a whole lot in those things.
2094705	2099290	So it's very interesting, these plug-and-play dance pads.
2099750	2100671	I've seen these before.
2100691	2113503	I saw the crappy 8-bit Nintendo-style dance pads at the mall before, but now Konami looks like they're going to be endorsing these official ones and kind of a more kid audience going for the DDR Disney mix.
2114002	2123151	Exactly, and speaking of wonderful plug-and-play DDR type things, Konami is putting out Strawberry Shortcake Dance Dance Revolution.
2124112	2137706	Yes, you can play as Strawberry Shortcake in Dance Dance Revolution with the equally cheesy dance pad that looks like, I don't know, basically getting any five-year-old pre-teen girl super excited about...
2138846	2141849	Jumping around to her favorite Strawberry Shortcake song.
2142249	2146373	Which, to be honest, I didn't think there was that many Strawberry Shortcake songs out there.
2146813	2148195	I didn't think there were that many either.
2148215	2150196	I didn't even think Strawberry Shortcake was still popular.
2151678	2153639	I mean, where's My Little Pony?
2154080	2155521	My Little Pony's out again too.
2156562	2158804	I thought it would have been Bratz DDR, if nothing else.
2159545	2165170	Well, remember those, I don't remember whatever came of this, but they were talking about a DDR TV show.
2165779	2166239	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2190814	2190994	D.D.R.
2191014	2191274	Hardcore
2211434	2214615	that maybe the parents will want a DDR for themselves, so on and so on.
2214655	2218236	I look at it in the same way that they got the Oha style one in Japan, honestly.
2218276	2219157	It's the same thing.
2219197	2219737	Exactly.
2219757	2220497	Oh, that's a good point.
2220557	2227559	And this features such wonderful songs like the theme music, Straw-ba-ba-ba-berry shortcake.
2227899	2232121	So apparently Strawberry Shortcake has a stutter.
2232521	2233361	That's excellent.
2234601	2236422	Straw-ba-ba-ba-ba-shortcake!
2236662	2237102	Yeah!
2238523	2238783	Whatever.
2238803	2239283	I don't know.
2240154	2243937	Blaze Revolution says, I bought DDR Disney Mix for my sister and I played it for her.
2244238	2244538	LOL.
2245399	2246159	That brings the family together.
2246179	2246920	I actually have both of them.
2247681	2250823	Except I didn't get the Nintendo 64 one.
2250943	2255087	You know, DDR Disney Mix did have something that was pretty revolutionary for DDR at the time.
2255748	2256248	Dance Magic.
2256644	2258066	DanceMagic is fabulous.
2259207	2260668	That was the best part of the game.
2260768	2263471	Honestly, for the hardcore DDR fans, that was the whole reason to own it.
2264012	2268176	That and Electrical Parade, says VidPower, except Electrical Parade wasn't in the US version.
2268196	2269137	Only in the Japanese one.
2269177	2272340	You had to get Disney's Rave, the Japanese version.
2272360	2275664	Disney's Rave, though, did have a few better songs, I have to say.
2275844	2276605	It had the Macarena.
2278863	2280964	I remember you making me play that in Milpitas.
2281004	2283865	I was like, okay, Rob, pick me a song.
2284205	2286186	Macarena, I hate you.
2287346	2288627	And then Mr. Bassman.
2289007	2289687	That song's awesome.
2289887	2291328	It is, but it's like slow.
2291348	2296370	I played Mr. Bassman a few weeks ago, and I nearly died because I was out of shape.
2297490	2302312	Jeremy Todd 1 suggests DDR Pirates of the Caribbean, the game where you have to dance to dodge the skeletons.
2302970	2308775	Hey, if DDR Disney does well, you can expect a whole bunch of freaking clones of it.
2309935	2312838	That's when you do a jig and the stage moves like you're on a boat.
2313238	2314359	Andrew, why are you making a face?
2314479	2316601	You're about to swallow your bottom lip there.
2316721	2318282	This is my sad panda face.
2320944	2321705	Why, though?
2321825	2324747	Isn't exposure for the DDR brand a good thing for the fanbase?
2325007	2326208	Not when it's freaking Disney.
2326248	2327629	Leave it to Kingdom Hearts or something.
2328130	2329551	Kingdom Hearts?
2329591	2330752	No more DDR Disney.
2331482	2333163	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2356162	2357744	The whole part was bad enough.
2357904	2363191	Unfortunately it's not going to happen since there was a partnership between Konami and Buena Vista to put out a ton more games.
2364193	2367237	So you're going to see a lot more of these before they go away.
2368527	2369868	And they will never go away, by the way.
2370288	2371389	Hooray, hooray.
2371969	2390399	Well, speaking of DDR, Ohasta, and things that just won't go away, every week here on this program, we have DarkSakura's Website of the Week segment because she serves the web up and down and left and right and back and forth, inside and out, looking for sites that you need to be visiting right now.
2390679	2394041	So, DarkSakura, where should the kids be going in their browsers right now?
2394844	2396325	World of Datecraft World of Datecraft
2425168	2432189	The website is wowdate.fullwiki.com Yeah, I'll spell it out.
2432529	2437871	w-o-w-d-a-t-e dot f-u-l-l-w-i-k-i dot com Which I will not spell.
2437891	2439491	If you can't spell com, go back to school.
2440251	2445312	So, yeah, this site is a dating site for people on World of Warcraft.
2446172	2449913	How to meet people who may or may not be of the gender they specify.
2452031	2453072	Wait, wait.
2453212	2454813	Or the age that they specify.
2454974	2460919	Is this a site for me to put up a personal ad for my WoW character or a personal ad for me?
2461659	2467904	Because I know my friend, this sick, sick woman she is, has a MySpace for her WoW character.
2469386	2472168	This is apparently real profiles.
2472688	2473909	And you can put your pictures.
2474009	2479354	And there's also couples on here, too, I guess, looking for other couples to experiment with.
2479875	2480335	Excellent.
2480455	2483257	World of Datecraft, where everybody looks like the Horde.
2485778	2496344	So you never know that that 18-year-old woman from Cleveland might really be a 56-year-old man from Albany, Georgia.
2496384	2498105	Hey, hey, it's a post-op.
2498345	2498605	Woman.
2500777	2501938	All right, all right, all right.
2502819	2505981	Confession, I do play a female orc warlock, okay?
2506021	2506482	Exactly.
2506682	2509404	I will never play a male character in any MMO ever again.
2509665	2511186	I will always play female characters.
2511246	2511786	You know why?
2512587	2513308	Free stuff.
2514549	2514849	True.
2515169	2515710	Free stuff?
2515850	2516650	It's sad and true.
2516670	2517851	Even on board, free stuff.
2517911	2520213	You people are making me very ill.
2520333	2521875	Slash dance for silver.
2522095	2522956	Works every time.
2523716	2528020	Even bipedal cows get free stuff.
2528931	2530952	I play with my coworkers and they give me money.
2531633	2532814	I don't like it either.
2533134	2534194	I don't like that difference.
2534214	2534715	Then don't do it!
2535075	2536436	Take the moral high ground!
2536556	2536836	No!
2537657	2538797	Free stuff, Jamie!
2539898	2544941	Well, I can actually get away with cuting on a game and having them give me money.
2545122	2547723	Hey, if you can, shake what the Earth Mother gave you.
2550545	2553847	VidPower says 99.9% of female night elves are guys.
2554387	2554668	True.
2554808	2555828	This is truth.
2555888	2556569	True statement.
2557182	2558203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2587956	2594578	Back on Virtual On, my two characters were either Fae-En or the big bulky one with the big gun.
2595298	2599019	Because I was like, who I can shoot you from over here and you can't get close to me.
2599539	2603620	One thing I liked about Ragnarok Online when I played that is... Nobody's ugly?
2604961	2606301	Well, because everybody looks the same.
2606621	2609322	But one thing you could do is you could cross-dress on Ragnarok Online.
2609362	2610902	Like, remember I used to have the giant bow?
2611022	2612223	Yeah, I had the giant bow in my hair.
2612243	2612863	That was awesome.
2613416	2614457	I still have that picture.
2614477	2615357	It used to be my cell phone.
2615377	2615837	My rogue has a dress.
2616137	2616758	I'm sorry.
2617978	2619499	My rogue has a spare dress.
2621841	2623381	For when the roleplay gets kind of weird.
2624642	2625142	Dot, dot, dot.
2625282	2626643	The show's starting to get a little weird.
2627464	2631726	And you admit this on the airway in front of several thousand downloaders.
2631746	2632346	Yes, yes.
2632406	2633447	You can, uh, no.
2634187	2637089	And you can message him at this is 23rd Megan.
2637589	2637989	Where's this?
2638009	2638830	At World of Warcraft.
2640171	2642793	Will you do a search for 21-year-olds in the Sacramento area?
2642813	2644295	Because I want to see if Andrew comes up.
2645056	2646837	Actually, will you look for some profiles in our area?
2647298	2648279	Maybe we should respond to one.
2648919	2649560	Are you on here, Andrew?
2649580	2650180	Are we going to find you?
2650441	2650821	Not yet.
2654384	2655906	I will do that just for shits.
2656886	2658088	I will indulge you on that.
2660650	2662732	I don't think it actually lets you look in area.
2662812	2663813	However, there's a guy.
2663853	2665074	I found a guy in Baton Rouge.
2665574	2666035	That's not bad.
2667725	2670447	That's a little far, but it's some long-distance dating.
2670748	2671188	You know what?
2671228	2672689	Okay, even though we're giving this crap a hard time.
2672709	2675752	I found a person who looks like Tran, as in Big Alien.
2678837	2679617	From Australia.
2680158	2681999	Even though we're giving this crap a hard time.
2682619	2686081	I want to be devil's advocate for a minute talking about wow dating and all that stuff.
2686541	2697227	When it comes to long distance relationships, isn't wow like a way that you could, and please don't take this as me saying I do this because I don't, but like I've heard of other people doing this.
2697587	2702830	Isn't wow kind of a way that you could like be with somebody even though you're not?
2704500	2705040	You know what I mean?
2705201	2710384	Like, you can adventure and do things together with somebody in a virtual form, even though you're not there, really there.
2710824	2718510	Well, you know, when Dan and I first met, we would just hang out on an AOL chat for, like, ever.
2718810	2720151	Because, you know, at the time, that's what we had.
2720171	2721312	We played Gemstone for a little while.
2722833	2725475	But, yeah, back in the day, Gemstone.
2725555	2726215	And Slingo?
2726776	2727837	No, I hate Slingo.
2728097	2728377	Okay.
2728457	2729698	And I played Tetranet.
2730939	2731899	I was a Tetranet girl.
2732900	2733821	But, yeah, it's...
2735518	2743562	I suppose it's sort of a way to at least see a part of you together with the person you're interested in.
2744922	2749684	And online relationships can make long distance easier, I think.
2750685	2753946	But honestly, nothing's going to make up for the face-to-face meeting.
2754086	2758108	And when you start wanking to the in-game sprites, that might be a little... No, no, no, that's not going to happen.
2759805	2760326	Why?
2760366	2761206	Something you need to share?
2761226	2761967	Uh, no.
2762247	2766430	So you're the one who's been buying out the plastic covers at Fry's.
2766450	2767971	So that was you on YouTube.
2768231	2768752	Oh, really?
2770073	2771173	Under Wankmaster.
2774416	2779480	Seriously, though, online gaming can be kind of a touchy thing with relationships.
2780555	2783478	Especially in party-based games, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy.
2784639	2791086	If your significant other isn't, say, pulling his or her weight, that could lead to an even bigger argument than you can ever have in person.
2792667	2793208	Interesting.
2793248	2795810	So you think WoW could actually cause fights?
2796011	2797392	It could cause a whole lot of fights.
2797912	2798533	Interesting.
2798994	2801276	Especially if one of them happens to be a healer.
2802930	2804010	I'm looking through chat here.
2804050	2807692	I kind of thought it would be a little... You can actually get married on Ragnarok on the Korean servers.
2808012	2809553	I thought it would be a little more lit up in chat.
2809573	2810474	Why do we never get this stuff?
2810654	2814516	Yuri Lover in chat says, when I play WoW, I get free tampons and condoms.
2814756	2817738	I have no idea how that works, but okay.
2817778	2818058	Hack!
2818859	2820139	It's going to be in the next patch, probably.
2820279	2821340	That's a hell of a hack.
2824162	2825743	What exactly would a tampon do for you?
2825783	2826703	Plus two to stamina?
2826723	2827964	What exactly?
2828184	2835709	I still think that they should do the hat idea like they had in Ragnarok with the poo hat and the apple of archer.
2838110	2843273	Jeremy Todd 1 says the WoW dating service is just for nerds who can tell their friends that they have a girlfriend.
2844814	2845655	Yeah, so?
2845855	2846956	I resemble that remark.
2847196	2850338	EvilCheese666 says ultimate WoW pickup line.
2850658	2852639	So, hey baby, you grind here often?
2853425	2853866	Nice!
2854646	2855287	That one's great.
2856068	2857329	I'll show you my Arcanite Reaper.
2860152	2862054	Oh, I didn't say that on the... What'd you say?
2862294	2863575	I picked my proficiencies, by the way.
2863595	2864216	Oh, what's that?
2864616	2868059	I picked tailoring and herbalism.
2868780	2869160	Fun.
2870021	2871963	So I can, you know, go get Gloomweed.
2873725	2876287	Your lover says he plays Triple X WoW, so now where are you going?
2876307	2876848	So you can make...
2877566	2881947	You can make clothes with hemp and you can... I can make hemp clothes and be a hippie.
2882727	2883808	A hippie zombie.
2884768	2886749	I think we probably should go on to the next topic now.
2886949	2888589	No, no, no.
2889069	2889629	No, no, no.
2889910	2890350	Maybe later.
2890390	2891090	We'll come back to it later.
2891470	2892030	This is huge.
2892170	2892930	I think this is huge.
2893070	2895431	It's a rumor, but it could be huge.
2896051	2901833	And you know that we've been speculating for a long time that Apple wants to get into the gaming market.
2902533	2906736	and also there's been speculation out there that Apple and Nintendo want to get into bed together.
2908037	2914341	So that just makes this story... Actually, Apple and Nintendo have been dating on World of Warcraft, believe it or not.
2916303	2927727	No, seriously, there is a rumor going around on MacRumors, and it's saying that Apple is currently planning on making classic Nintendo games playable on the next iPod.
2928047	2935730	Now, the website is not able to confirm this speculation, but, you know, it does fit into that whole fanboy dream, doesn't it?
2936010	2940711	Now, MacRumors says that it's going to be playable with a special accessory.
2942712	2943372	Whatever that is.
2943893	2945193	That special accessory...
2946095	2946795	Transvibrator.
2947576	2952438	No, it's... Special Accessory is another game system.
2954079	2954940	What do you think, Loki?
2954960	2956961	I'm really curious to see what you think about this.
2956981	2958381	You know I need your input on this.
2958882	2959442	What do I think?
2959562	2961103	I think, well, that would be disruption.
2961123	2967646	They're always talking about the... I think it's all, you know, bullshit just because I don't think that they would want their classics to be played on iPod.
2967926	2972989	One, you couldn't do it on iPod anyways because, I mean, come on, the iPod is not meant for gaming.
2973249	2973469	I mean...
2974301	2979783	But, okay, but let's say, like, iPods have that little slot at the bottom that you usually put the USB charger into.
2979823	2981083	I know you wouldn't know that, but they do.
2981703	2985445	You could easily plug a joystick in there, or like a little NES-style controller.
2985705	2986085	There you go.
2986565	2987345	Gaming system on the go.
2987465	2987945	I could see it.
2988346	2989626	You couldn't do it with the current setup.
2989646	2991286	You would have to have this attachment, but you could do it.
2991587	2993507	But the question is, would they want to?
2993627	2998649	Because my thought when reading this was, well, what about virtual console and being able to download to your DS?
2998889	2999189	Why not?
3001110	3002450	Again, I'm speculating with that.
3002510	3004151	They haven't said you'll officially be able to do that.
3004211	3008072	But logically, you'll be able to download some stuff to the DS.
3008132	3009293	Why not virtual console games?
3009353	3011233	So why would Nintendo compete with itself?
3012374	3013654	They wouldn't compete with itself.
3013674	3016195	They would use it probably just to help promote themselves.
3016295	3016595	I don't know.
3016635	3018376	I don't think... So you're thinking 1Z, 2Z games?
3018396	3020417	But who's going to buy the accessory for 1Z, 2Z games?
3020717	3021017	I don't know.
3021077	3022198	And here's the thing, too.
3022338	3028580	I don't know if they would do that because just because you're playing retro games on your iPod does not make you want to buy...
3030626	3039788	I don't know how they're going to make money off this.
3039828	3047290	I guess if you buy each individual title or whatever and download it to your iPod, I guess that would be kind of neat, but whatever.
3047310	3050271	To be honest, I don't think this is going to happen.
3050291	3052211	Apple is trying to grow a gaming penis and isn't doing a good job of it.
3058302	3060004	Apple does have a booth at E3 every year.
3060284	3064066	It's little, and it's in the back, and you have to have an invite to get there, but they're there.
3064487	3069250	But I always kind of assumed it was for their graphics or type stuff that they can do for computer.
3069270	3071111	Anyway, and then let's see.
3071231	3073612	Macman says they're announcing a new iPod this August.
3073653	3074753	Well, that's no surprise.
3075194	3077495	They need to announce a new iPod to sell them this Christmas.
3077815	3082078	But my thought was it's going to be the movie iPod because it's already been going around.
3082118	3084920	They want to put that in iTunes, so that makes sense.
3085612	3086593	What do you think about this, Jamie?
3086613	3090275	Would this make you want a game on the iPod, having NES games on it?
3091676	3093097	Yeah, it'd be something to do at work.
3093917	3094518	I'm kidding, no.
3094578	3095738	In between the Animal Crossing?
3096119	3097660	No, I don't play Animal Crossing at work anymore.
3097700	3098220	I take a nap.
3100061	3100561	It's true.
3101462	3102222	My doctor told me to.
3104264	3104704	It's true.
3104724	3105324	I would do it.
3105344	3106765	Say that I'm stuck in line...
3111584	3115928	for the bathroom at the Riptide Arcade, which I was standing in for 25 minutes.
3116508	3116889	Wow.
3116949	3117770	It gave me something to do.
3120132	3120372	So, yeah.
3121826	3122126	All right.
3123306	3123626	Okay.
3124127	3130868	Well, speaking of other portable music systems, the Zune has been officially confirmed by Microsoft.
3131628	3144311	It is coming, and it's actually all will be revealed soon, according to them, in a brand-new Billboard magazine article, which is going to be talking about it and how they also plan to release additional Zune-branded devices.
3145291	3148352	There's also a fun little website you can go view, which...
3149468	3150729	Thank you for watching!
3169531	3179713	So one kind of interesting thing though, they said that it will reportedly include access to digital media and a wide range of Windows-powered devices.
3180274	3188215	And also they're saying that it's going to be something that aspires to be one part MySpace, one part iTunes, and part Xbox Live.
3189216	3199078	So I don't know what exactly that's supposed to mean, but they're saying that maybe after this you're going to see probably a video player and possibly a portable games device.
3199881	3202283	All branded with this brand new Zune thing.
3203384	3205826	Does this have anything to do with gaming though?
3206206	3207868	In the end, do you think anything gaming will come of this?
3208188	3221419	Actually, one thing that was interesting about that, and I remember reading this a while back, is the Zune is actually going to be fit with a processor that's a bit more powerful than you would really need for playing music on it.
3222737	3229980	So it's something comparable to maybe like a PSP or even more powerful than that, which is interesting when you think about it.
3231441	3231741	Interesting.
3232722	3235063	I think it's interesting you brought up the whole MySpace thing too.
3235163	3236603	MySpace is interesting.
3236663	3238364	By the way, Orange Launch Radio has a MySpace.
3238464	3239625	You should add us as your friend today.
3239705	3241225	MySpace.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
3241265	3241506	Thank you.
3242406	3243666	But MySpace is huge right now.
3243727	3246348	What is it, like the fourth most visited site on the internet?
3246668	3246808	Yeah.
3247611	3249832	I would think more people want a piece of Myspace.
3250152	3252974	I don't think competitors to Myspace work as well.
3253174	3256055	Why aren't people trying to team up with Myspace?
3256075	3256555	Think about this.
3256916	3260577	Altel Wireless has that Myspace on-the-go type thing.
3261738	3263339	It actually is branded with Myspace.
3264659	3265760	I don't know what the hell you'd do with that.
3265880	3266900	Post messages, I guess?
3267581	3267881	Whatever.
3268401	3271883	Still, though, that's something that they can have and maybe even add later on.
3272083	3276165	They're going to have MyZune.com or something like that where you'd have your own
3276565	3277946	MySpace is so interesting though.
3277966	3282127	It's like that site that everybody uses because they have to, but nobody likes to admit they use it.
3282647	3283728	You know what I mean?
3302952	3317607	I stayed after Clerks 2 to see the MySpace names on there, and apparently I'm on there twice, but it's like six rows of names going pretty fast down the screen, and even though it's in alphabetical order by our last name, it's still fucking hard to find yourself on there.
3318564	3319184	and the DVD.
3319424	3321204	It's going to have everybody that's on there right now.
3321264	3323645	So that's over 100,000 names on the DVD.
3325165	3327786	Our buddy Bobby Blackwolf is in chat right now.
3327846	3330766	By the way, he had his one year birthday tonight for his show.
3330806	3332166	So congratulations, Bobby.
3332846	3335147	And it's all downhill from there.
3336607	3338787	Blackwolf says, Microsoft's ad campaign.
3339208	3341728	MySpace is where the internet goes to die.
3342128	3346009	MyZune is where the internet goes to live anywhere.
3346849	3347129	Get it?
3347189	3347429	Live?
3347709	3347929	Life?
3350274	3351974	It's true, though.
3352095	3353255	Actually, that's pretty punny.
3353635	3355616	I am not writing that shit down, Bobby.
3355636	3357177	Don't ask.
3358417	3358657	Alright.
3358957	3360278	Are you a big MySpace fan, DarkSakura?
3361061	3362982	I'm only there because I have to be.
3363082	3364602	Exactly, that's how I feel about it too.
3364622	3368303	Because I have friends that won't get on LiveJournal, so I have to keep up with them on MySpace.
3368603	3371084	Although I did find one of my best friends from high school.
3371484	3376965	Yeah, that's kind of the same reason I use it, is that I found people that I would never have reconnected with.
3377085	3380386	Someone I didn't like, his sister messaged me.
3381067	3382387	Said, oh yeah, my brother's so cool.
3382507	3383167	Are you friends with him?
3383767	3384267	Yeah.
3384307	3386988	You know the other great thing about MySpace, and I swear I'll get back into games.
3387308	3389729	I've been able to go back to my high school graduating class
3390222	3392263	and see who's gay.
3392323	3396126	Because you can go back and really see what became of everybody.
3396186	3397246	Like, oh, I knew he was gay.
3397447	3398147	I knew she was gay.
3398567	3399268	I knew that.
3399448	3401809	And then all the people that had 70 babies.
3401969	3404071	Just everything played out exactly like you expected.
3404091	3406652	You turned out to be a breeder.
3406712	3407193	Exactly.
3409429	3409889	Excellent.
3410249	3412390	Anyway, sorry for that randomness there.
3412470	3415392	Let's get back to games and we'll talk about Konami.
3415432	3416972	We love to talk about Konami.
3416992	3418493	We've talked about them for years and years and years.
3419093	3425396	Konami has announced a partnership with mobile gaming company Tokyopop to launch a new series of mobile games.
3425736	3430078	Now, Tokyopop is kind of like this youth-oriented entertainment and all that stuff.
3430418	3433240	Now, Tokyopop is also the number one manga company in the U.S.
3433320	3438602	and they will be launching together a series of mobile games starting with East Coast Rising.
3439348	3443991	This is a story that has to do with pirates and high seas adventure and that will be available in early fall.
3444872	3447473	Comes a quote from Stu Levy, the CEO of Tokyopop.
3447774	3453457	We are very excited to be partnering with Konami to move to Tokyopop's creative juice in the white hot area of mobile gaming.
3453897	3459221	Our two brands both stand for an east meets west aesthetic that really speaks out to fans worldwide.
3459581	3462803	So working together is a natural fit that will truly push the envelope.
3464184	3465745	Should be interesting to see where that partnership goes.
3466425	3466645	X-Rated
3479073	3479353	DarkSakura.com
3503695	3516821	My first email actually has to do with something that my husband's been ogling over, but I'd like to thank our dear friend Rob with Two Bees for mentioning it to me.
3517841	3523764	Stern, basically the only company that's still making pinball machines, has a Pirates of the Caribbean pinball machine.
3524719	3526020	And I saw pictures of it last night.
3526720	3528561	It actually looks pretty darn cool.
3528802	3533965	It has a sinking ship and a treasure chest and all kinds of cool stuff that pops up.
3535285	3538307	But it's actually around $4,000 right now.
3538788	3544511	So yeah, we've been sort of debating, can we justify the expense of a $4,000 pinball machine?
3544611	3545552	Yeah, let's do it.
3547028	3559978	But anyway, I posted a bit of an article on here that said, to quote on here, Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is the perfect title and theme for a pinball, said Factory Honcho Gary Stern.
3560439	3568665	It lends itself to lots of mechanical action pinball shots and toys for casual players, yet the story cries for deep rules to challenge the best of players.
3569526	3574910	And from what I've heard from other pinball geeks like me and my hubby, it's supposed to be pretty hardcore, so...
3576462	3577442	Got another email.
3577702	3583604	We got one, a short one from Crispy Creamy, who's one of our chatroom people too.
3584585	3589887	Said, hey guys, I just got Guitar Hero for my birthday and it totally rocks, but I would also like to try out the new Guitar Freaks game.
3590587	3590887	New?
3591587	3593268	Because my Guitar Freaks controller broke.
3593568	3595728	Is it possible to use a Guitar Hero controller on Guitar Freaks?
3595849	3596649	The answer is yes.
3598589	3598890	It is?
3599230	3599510	Yes.
3600070	3600170	Oh.
3600717	3601278	I didn't know that.
3601538	3603660	I would have said no, but I haven't tried.
3603700	3608224	Actually, the Guitar Freaks controller works on Guitar Hero 2 only barely.
3609265	3611547	You have to configure it, but we were trying to do two-player.
3611567	3613828	I thought they did experiments that showed that wasn't true.
3614249	3614409	No.
3615310	3616931	It's barely compatible, but it is.
3618753	3619173	I'll be damned.
3620634	3624658	Remember how we talked about the... Oh, maybe it was one of the shows where you weren't here.
3626030	3630374	Kenami Trademarked Guitar Revolution Hey, let's make a game out of this
3641601	3641821	The Gamer
3666055	3667595	Here's a question I was just wondering.
3667775	3668755	He's the gamer.
3668835	3670416	That's it.
3670596	3671456	He's the gamer.
3671616	3674156	And every time we talk about gaming news, it's about this guy.
3677577	3678377	I had to, sorry.
3678477	3680798	A million Margaret Cho quotes are going through my head now.
3681838	3682438	Let's keep it moving.
3682458	3683618	Where's this parade?
3683718	3684598	Let's keep it moving.
3685278	3687959	Since you guys live in California, do you ever go to the Price is Right?
3688079	3688479	Rob?
3688699	3689699	I've been one time.
3689939	3690239	I have.
3690299	3690879	I went once.
3691239	3692640	You sat by Dude, right?
3692740	3693760	Yes, it was in April.
3693920	3694640	I got you on TV.
3695547	3700449	It was April of 2002, and I was in L.A.
3700529	3701810	for Coachella that year.
3701850	3703270	This has nothing to do with gaming, but I don't care.
3703570	3704051	I was in L.A.
3704071	3708152	for Coachella that year, because I went, and we decided we would go by The Price is Right.
3708192	3709073	You know, hell, why not?
3709413	3713254	Well, we actually got to go to two tapings, because a big group had canceled for the second taping.
3713274	3714375	They do two tapings on Monday.
3714895	3719637	And for the second taping, I got to sit right behind Rod Roddy, because this was about a year before he passed away.
3720017	3722398	And it was sparkling in my face, and everything sparkles.
3722958	3724358	I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
3724598	3726819	You know what I could see on Rod Roddy's platform?
3727519	3728219	Tax forms.
3728499	3729739	You know what's on those tax forms?
3730620	3732940	All of the prices of all the prizes.
3733300	3742882	So all you had to do was look at that, and if they called me up on stage, which they didn't because I'm boring, I guess, then I would have won the Showcase Showdown.
3743042	3749443	And I kind of would have been cheating, but at the same time, I don't think I would have felt bad about it because I would have had a new car.
3750724	3752324	That you have to pay taxes on.
3753348	3757451	I would have sold the... There's always some crap prize in the Showcase Showdown.
3757471	3763054	I would have sold like the, you know... I don't even fucking have room for a dinette set in the house, okay?
3763074	3765195	I would have sold that shit to pay the taxes on the car.
3765856	3769938	Well, I'm saying... I just think it's kind of funny that you win all these prizes and you have to pay taxes for them.
3770499	3775262	Well, you know, our friend Mel won on... That's right.
3775502	3776122	On Wheel of Fortune.
3776142	3776743	Wheel of Fortune.
3777243	3778364	We should go on a game show.
3778384	3779504	We should all go on a game show.
3779945	3780585	Like Survivor.
3781027	3781527	No.
3781947	3782167	No.
3782187	3783448	You know how much weight I'd lose?
3783528	3783908	Alright, anyway.
3784648	3788489	But the rest of this email, basically he didn't leave a voicemail, because he didn't want to pay for it.
3789750	3790190	Fair enough.
3790470	3791290	Okay.
3791890	3798792	I think the games have gotten easier, because back in the 80s, there were arcade games like Pac-Man, Centipede, and this command where there was no storyline to it.
3798872	3804054	All it was was basically the same level, except the enemies moved faster and less time to do stuff, and that made it harder.
3804954	3807235	Also, the old games, since it is harder, your most...
3807952	3813413	You are mostly going to get a game over and a game over meant that you had to start from the beginning.
3813933	3819574	Now once you get past a certain point in the game, it would save, so you'd have to start from the beginning.
3819875	3820955	This is repeating sort of.
3821815	3824736	Some games now start to get boring after a while of playing it.
3824836	3826616	I remember one game on my dad's Atari 2600.
3826916	3830577	It makes me so sad to hear my dad's Atari 2600.
3833148	3833489	Oh, wow.
3833509	3835070	That he had when he was a kid.
3835490	3836431	That just hit me, too.
3836671	3837571	Oh, ow, that hurt.
3837591	3839232	There was a game called Grand Prix.
3839813	3843915	That was actually, I think, the Odyssey 2, I think.
3846097	3852941	It was a racing game that had the same cars in the same position, everything, and it challenged you to remember the order of the cars so you could get it perfectly.
3853322	3855023	But you had to get to the second level.
3855043	3857164	The cars completely changed position, and it was really hard.
3857725	3858845	Oh, yeah, that was Atari 2600.
3858885	3859065	That was...
3862048	3864169	A lot like RallyX too.
3864910	3867491	RallyX had the, where you had to do the, oh anyway.
3868432	3870793	But yeah, he said that he thinks games got easier.
3871954	3873555	I don't see any punctuation, I'm sorry.
3875516	3881400	You know, our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat, is talking about the Orange Lounge game show.
3881620	3885102	They're saying, you know, we shouldn't be on a game show, we should have our own damn game show.
3885202	3889285	And it looks like some folks are suggesting, like TigerClaw says, it should be kind of like Starcade.
3890208	3891689	and Starcade was an awesome game show.
3891709	3892570	Starcade was cool.
3892650	3896152	You know, didn't we meet one of the guys from Gameplay HD at E3?
3896252	3899015	Maybe we should send a treatment or something because that would be awesome.
3899335	3904879	You know, little tidbit about me, it's always been a secret dream of mine to be a game show host.
3905059	3907161	I would love it so much.
3908361	3910063	Loki, you could be a Barker's Beauty or something.
3912144	3914546	I had outlined something similar to that.
3914566	3915587	That's right.
3915787	3918569	I remember that was an Orange Lounge show that never happened.
3919415	3920436	We need to talk about that.
3920636	3921196	We should do that.
3921216	3923578	I still have it.
3923958	3927681	We're talking off air because I bet you would really want to do something like that.
3928301	3931243	Okay.
3931283	3934225	This is what happens in an Orange Lounge meeting.
3934245	3937387	Pass the beer!
3938108	3939289	Live on-air staff meeting.
3940676	3943258	Next email comes from Tyson.
3972225	3974086	As in longer levels, more gameplay.
3974807	3976027	More games to buy.
3976668	3978969	You're done with the game, you can go buy another one now.
3979289	3982751	You lower the replayability, then you're ready for the next thing to come out.
3984332	3988875	Honestly, it makes... Someone left this in one of the voicemails of the week, which you'll hear in the next part of our show.
3989816	3996520	But it might have to do with level design and the cost of level design and the difficulty of level design makes it harder to do long levels.
3996980	4000002	I'm almost seeing sort of, and I hate to bring back pinball in the middle of this...
4000885	4001285	Why not?
4002766	4016970	Well, you know, with pinball, when your only competition is yourself, you have to make your old games obsolete and make it so where you can make them obsolete so that you bring out a newer, better product.
4017851	4027514	So I think that they actually put this limitation in some games so that they know that by the time the average player is done with this game, their next title is ready to come out.
4029292	4029452	Shaoran108
4053715	4054915	Greetings, OLR crew.
4054995	4058557	Recently, you have been mentioning an Orange Launch Army on the podcast that got me thinking.
4058917	4065759	I recently started a file in Disgaea Hour of Darkness and decided to name my starting non-storyline characters after members of the OLR crew.
4066060	4066740	That's so cute.
4067020	4068480	And some other people mentioned on the show.
4068520	4071361	My three prinnies are named Sky, Loki, and Shane.
4071802	4072862	My red mage is Tia.
4073522	4075403	And it's spelled like Tia doesn't hurt, though.
4079943	4101180	Blue Mage is Rice Princess, the Green Mage is Pixie Dust, I have two brawlers and DarkSakura This person is an old school OLR listener because Rice Princess has been on Orange Lounge Radio for at least a year if not more It's been ages since we've also had Pixie Dust, oh my gosh The Orange Lounge Madam Wow You sir are old school and we applaud you Tia moved to New York
4101502	4101962	Yeah.
4102242	4103683	She's not going to be on our show anymore.
4104343	4105103	Not if we can help it.
4105643	4107623	We'll get her on the phone at some point.
4108764	4109904	I will chase her ass down.
4109984	4110404	I love her.
4110684	4110924	Anyway.
4111184	4116666	Anyway, getting to the point, I intend to pick up Disgaea 2, Cursed Memories, as soon as it is released in the U.S.
4117006	4120247	I would like to create an Orange Lounge attack force with characters named after the LLR crew.
4120267	4122067	August 28th, by the way.
4122822	4137051	If you have played the first game, seeing as how I believe most of the character classes and monster classes will be brought over from the first game, I would like not only your permission to call them a faction of the OL Army, but also have opinions on what character monster classes you would like to be represented as.
4138172	4139573	As far as I'm concerned, name away.
4140153	4141814	Use OL Army in your game all you want.
4141854	4142535	I think that's rad.
4142555	4143395	Send screenshots.
4143415	4143956	Send screenshots.
4144116	4146738	If it involves fire, I'll take anything that involves fire.
4148239	4149099	Fire and cute.
4149239	4150260	It has to be fire and cute.
4151000	4154861	You know, Disgaea has that one... Disgaea kind of has cute all over it.
4155101	4155801	Like, you know what I mean?
4156121	4158862	Fire, fuego, fiore.
4159302	4160162	You'll have to forgive me.
4160202	4166003	I haven't played a whole lot of Disgaea, but I remember there was like a... One of the lead characters was like a vampire girl that was kind of a smartass.
4167104	4167284	Etna.
4167584	4168344	Etna, yeah.
4168544	4169304	I'd be a vampire smartass.
4169324	4170264	She reminds me of you.
4170304	4171144	She reminds me of you.
4172445	4176066	So, that would be... Just because I am a smartass.
4176726	4177326	Just not a vampire.
4177966	4178126	Alright.
4178775	4179135	or are you?
4179275	4180516	Oh, do I need to get my garlic necklace?
4181456	4182637	You invited me in.
4182957	4187780	I tend to be drawn towards healing types, but I don't know.
4188240	4190962	I like summoners too, but I don't think, does this guy have something like that?
4191342	4192683	I didn't play enough of it.
4193403	4194023	I like fire.
4194484	4195484	Make me a treasure hunter.
4196745	4197545	Probably has to be the thief.
4198166	4198726	Treasure hunter.
4200187	4200707	I like fire.
4200747	4202968	Can you tell Locke's one of my favorite characters ever in a game?
4203248	4203769	I love Locke.
4204389	4204789	Treasure hunter.
4205770	4206430	Loki, what would you be?
4207549	4207929	I don't care.
4207949	4209391	He'd be a big oaf with a club.
4209451	4209971	That's Loki.
4210011	4210972	He'd be the brute.
4211032	4211832	Smash Mac.
4212053	4212813	Smash Mac.
4212873	4213954	He'd be the Hulk.
4215435	4218538	And Andrew would be one of those penguins that you throw and explode.
4220759	4225683	I also did get another piece of news that has nothing to do with games or anything in the mailbox.
4226984	4228665	Weird Al's next album is going to be out September 26th.
4228685	4228786	Sweet.
4232697	4261427	by the way I have to say this since the OL Army got brought up I love love love this on the threads have you guys seen the trading card game people are going off on like it's gone like three pages the trading card game in our forums like people coming up with these cards and man there's some like old school references back to like pre-podcast episodes of Orange Lounge Radio and stuff it's just it's nutty you guys are awesome we have such awesome listeners and even the screenshots have continued people have been submitting screenshots of like Orange Lounge references and games and like
4262011	4263533	You guys are so awesome.
4263854	4266337	We don't even have to promote when you guys are doing that.
4266377	4267098	It's so awesome.
4267538	4268700	But word of mouth is where it's at.
4268760	4272966	I've been trying to play more online Chromehounds since I know we have the OLR army on there.
4273246	4278733	The problem is, though, in order to play online and actually have some decent mechs, you have to play the offline version.
4280931	4286694	Seriously though, send us your screenshots of Orange Lounge in random games and we will do a collage for the site or something.
4286714	4287195	It would be awesome.
4287655	4294879	I'll tell you what, if everyone does it high quality enough, who knows, maybe we'll see about having an official game or something.
4295259	4298361	Dark Knight says, we are the Orange Lounge Radio Street team.
4298501	4299242	That's a good reference.
4299262	4300663	You guys really are doing that for us.
4300743	4301663	We love you guys for it.
4302123	4302784	Here's my thought.
4303644	4304365	I would love this.
4304405	4305225	I don't know about you guys.
4305305	4308187	And I know we have a couple industry people that listen to the show.
4309904	4313207	How awesome would it be to be like a voice in a video game?
4313467	4315189	Like actually voice a character for some game?
4315209	4316050	I've done voice acting before.
4316711	4318192	Not for a major game, have you?
4318372	4320154	No, but I've done voice acting for a radio drama.
4320574	4321195	Oh, okay.
4321655	4322156	That's cool.
4323017	4325639	I've done a little voice acting for a fan dub and that's about it.
4325799	4327080	Okay.
4327100	4331444	Yeah, somebody was supposed to give me information about voice acting for said fan dub.
4331985	4332866	Okay, okay.
4333719	4338244	Anyway, yeah, that would be awesome, but I don't know.
4339365	4341567	I was doing a I Feel Sick the radio drama.
4343990	4344530	All right, anyway.
4344550	4345291	I was the b-girl.
4346012	4348394	Industry peeps, if you're listening, throw us a cameo.
4348915	4349335	Seriously.
4350156	4351077	All right, so that's it for the mailbag?
4351932	4352512	Yes it is.
4352712	4356754	Send us email mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com because we love getting emails.
4357194	4357895	You guys rock.
4358195	4358415	All right.
4358675	4359075	Excellent.
4359575	4374802	Well, speaking of fun stuff, Sony is patenting a brand new, well, I guess next gen eye toy type of device, which is not too surprising when you think about it because, I mean, it did after all have the eye of justice or eye of judgment.
4374842	4376043	Yeah, not justice.
4376715	4377695	That'd be a whole other game.
4378276	4379836	But I have judgment.
4380777	4396003	Basically, in a nutshell, this whole brand new eye toy, what's supposed to be kind of neat about it is that it has technology to allow one single 2D camera to analyze objects in full 3D using some sort of patented mapping technique.
4396644	4401506	Previously, the only way you could do this is with two cameras, but now they've
4402066	4402726	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4432113	4437840	Except my living room is not a white background, as seen in said test areas.
4438781	4439922	But, I don't know.
4440423	4448853	This is the day of Martha Stewart, where everybody paints her, like has a red wall, and then a green wall, and then a beige wall, and then a puce wall.
4449298	4452659	I see a red wall and I want to paint it black
4477372	4477893	Hooray!
4478113	4480195	Well, I have something to make people go yippy, sort of.
4481616	4483858	It's Sony, so how excited can we be?
4484859	4490904	Sony Online Entertainment actually has an agreement done with Epic Games to license the Unreal Engine 3.
4492866	4495709	So, there's a quote here from...
4496638	4504721	via Epic's Game President Mark Raine saying, Sony Online Entertainment has a reputation for delivering detailed, truly engaging, interactive online worlds.
4504801	4509283	It is a great privilege for us that they're using Unreal Engine 3 to create their next generation projects.
4511423	4516325	Of course, we've also seen it licensed by THQ, BioWare, Midway, Atari, Buena Vista.
4516345	4518446	Yeah.
4519026	4520767	Who hasn't licensed it at this point?
4521007	4524228	Heck, I licensed it just yesterday to do my taxes.
4526371	4528953	Oh yeah, well I better get a return on this, die!
4529874	4530054	No.
4530434	4534357	Oh, what a compliment to the creators there, you know, your engine's getting used everywhere.
4534998	4537060	Sony's just jealous everybody else had it first.
4537740	4542264	Eddie in our chatroom says, oh I should say OL Army Eddie in our chatroom says, boo Epic for supporting Sony.
4542644	4543245	Seriously.
4543745	4551491	Speaking of everyone having a piece of it, Hillary Clinton, she's, I'm not talking about Bill Clinton by the way.
4551831	4554954	Yeah, I don't know if you phrased that exactly the way you intended.
4555891	4558872	Anyways, Hillary Clinton... We mean piece of it or full of it?
4559812	4562713	Piece of it, you know, because everybody has fucked Bill Clinton.
4563674	4569096	I didn't fuck... You know what, let's just get this started.
4569136	4570616	Games, games, please, games.
4570656	4572717	Is it the heat that's making everyone crazy tonight?
4572737	4574117	It is the heat, oh my god.
4574157	4575838	Did you put something in those fucking cookies?
4575858	4578499	No, I didn't, they're Trader Joe's cookie mix.
4580339	4582541	Trader Joe's ganja cookie mix.
4583742	4584302	Oh, come on!
4584362	4585563	It's all natural, man!
4585603	4593089	First of all, I know that you are allergic, and I am allergic, and it would be pretty funny to get Andrew all on some ganja cookies, though.
4595030	4603837	Orange Downs Radio does not condone the use of drugs or crap, but we do endorse beer.
4604137	4605358	Anyways, let's go back to this.
4607242	4608062	Hillary Clinton!
4608303	4608983	Go Hillary!
4609323	4611944	No, she's actually trying to... Give her some ganja cookies.
4613305	4614086	Seriously.
4614126	4614746	No, no, no, no.
4615046	4618168	She already had her batch of those when she was in law school.
4618208	4620889	I didn't inhale.
4620949	4627532	I bet she baked a batch of special brownies for her teacher and that's how she passed all her finals.
4628433	4628653	Okay.
4630020	4630720	Poor Loki!
4630781	4632602	I have done the X-Facts bounty trick.
4632742	4633602	Do not laugh about that.
4633622	4637525	Loki is usually the one that derails this show, and he looks so frustrated right now.
4638805	4642087	Anyways, so, Hillary Clinton.
4643128	4645810	Cookie!
4646110	4650753	She's actually kind of in the focus of a brand new scandal now.
4650973	4659498	It's having to do with legislation that she's supposedly going to be trying to pass to impose a tax on games.
4661410	4671593	and, you know, basically, I don't know what the purpose of this would be, you know, and still no way to actually confirm whether this is true or not, but great!
4671773	4672814	Taxing games!
4674254	4675314	God, I really hate her.
4676154	4677415	And she just gives me another reason.
4677635	4679255	Other than her being an ugly skank.
4679455	4680456	There's already a tax on them.
4680496	4681176	It's called sales tax.
4682349	4689332	Yeah, but she wants a better tax because, you know, everybody's got to pay for the crazy people that go out and murder in the name of video games.
4689732	4691233	And so I guess this would pay for this.
4691573	4694634	Then they need to put a tax on board games.
4695174	4697435	They need to put a tax on other computer programs.
4697455	4698376	Don't give her any ideas.
4698456	4701097	I could only support this if it was across the board.
4701197	4704018	Like, you know, it's video games, movies...
4704730	4707991	and lots of forms of entertainment rather than just singling out video games.
4708011	4709331	Because honestly, what's the difference?
4709431	4712732	Well, this is a really stupid platform for her to be talking on anyways.
4712772	4717194	And I really hate how the rumor is that they're going to be using this in the 2008 elections.
4717794	4719634	Video game violence and that kind of crap.
4719934	4726816	She should take a cue from her buddy Jack who got basically told to fuck off by the court.
4727016	4727997	That was legendary.
4728337	4729277	That was beautiful.
4729597	4731938	Seriously, next thing you know they'll be putting a tax on cigarettes.
4732278	4732658	Oh, wait.
4733109	4736670	He tried to do his whole friend of the court thing and the judge is like, screw you!
4737490	4737970	Piss off!
4740671	4741631	In a paraphrase, by the way.
4742351	4743231	We'll see what happens.
4745031	4746232	He's probably thinking it.
4746252	4762795	So basically, one thing is, Clinton is waging a public crusade against games and apparently, a recent speech in front of the Kaiser Family Foundation, she accused modern society of performing a massive experiment on millions of children
4763291	4767612	by exposing them to games, electronic media, and omnipresent advertising.
4768033	4777096	At the rate technology is advancing, people will be implanting chips in our children to advertise directly into their brains and tell them what kind of products to buy, Clinton warned.
4777416	4784078	Of course, being that she's in a government position, I'm sure she realizes that also the U.S.
4784198	4787619	Army is using those tactics with America's Army as their recruiting tool.
4787799	4792323	Do you know how bad I would want to just pick her brain and see where she's coming from on this?
4792383	4795466	Like, I want her on the show so, so bad.
4795526	4796507	It is not even funny.
4796567	4799230	Like, I just want to know, why games?
4799450	4803033	What is making you tick on this whole thing, you know?
4803153	4807297	Because her husband would rather play some Grand Theft Auto than give her Nookie, okay?
4808178	4811341	Wait, wait, wait, Loki, read that last paragraph again, the one about the chips.
4812603	4813644	Let's see here.
4813904	4823412	At the rate that technology is advancing, people will be implanting chips in our children to advertise directly into their brains and tell them what kind of products to buy.
4823792	4826715	Ladies and gentlemen, we already know this, but this bitch has gone off the deep end.
4827615	4829957	Seriously, what the hell?
4830718	4834541	This is making me think of that one episode of C-Lab.
4836462	4841544	You remember C-Lab, where they went on the surface and all these people were addicted to a video game?
4841924	4842624	Oh, God.
4842804	4853507	Well, basically, this comes to us from Rocky Mountain News, and it was shared to them from a very reliable source, but very reliable and very anonymous.
4854628	4855088	Interesting.
4856708	4857809	What are you looking at there?
4857909	4864291	I'm looking at the notice in order by James Brady, judge of the Middle District of Louisiana.
4865100	4870825	It is ordered that the motion for leave to file an amicus curiae brief be and is hereby denied.
4870845	4874067	God, you can find anything on the internet.
4874127	4875728	It's denied, bitch.
4876289	4878470	It's in capital letters.
4878490	4882514	Notice how big, bold, and beautiful that word denied is.
4882654	4885636	It's one page with no explanation.
4885816	4888158	It's basically the legal fuck-off.
4888558	4889819	So I'm going to post this in the chatroom.
4889839	4893322	I didn't mean to hijack your thing, but the chatroom should see this.
4893743	4897344	EvilCheese666 in the chatroom says, We need to mobilize the OL Army.
4897385	4901226	We're going to war to stop the evil of taxes.
4902327	4905988	I'm not anti-taxes if it's going to a good cause.
4906248	4907329	No tax return.
4907549	4912351	I'm not for this because it's unfair.
4912431	4918233	It's targeting one element of entertainment that seems to be the common scapegoat.
4919028	4929677	Well, if any of our listeners that would like, you know, who are hearing this later in the week, it's at gamepolitics.com slash images slash la-jt-denied.pdf.
4929697	4931619	Make sure you have that for that reader.
4931639	4932860	Game Politics is a beautiful site.
4932960	4934001	I love Game Politics.
4934041	4936023	Those guys are like my hero forever.
4937564	4944991	By the way, just as a friendly reminder, if you want to, you know, we at Orange Lawn Trader are all about making your, getting your,
4945464	4946104	Thank you for watching!
4974807	4975547	Tell your friends.
4976428	4977428	It's just like we said before.
4977528	4980969	If you have a problem with what the companies are doing, buy stock.
4981549	4983170	No, I'm serious.
4983190	4984830	You can't buy stock in Hillary Clinton, though.
4984911	4985911	I'm saying the companies.
4986491	4990212	If you have problems with what the government's doing, write your congressman.
4990332	5001776	Send a letter in to the various different... There's also a number of different bureaus that are in charge of these various different proposals that will eventually go back in effect.
5002277	5002457	You can...
5004449	5007370	What, the Trade Commission, I believe it is?
5008411	5012052	Even on an international level, there's also international, you know, the Tariff and Trade.
5013853	5014153	Rob?
5014793	5016554	Sorry, something in the chat room gave me the giggles.
5017594	5018394	Go ahead and finish, sorry.
5018995	5019735	You derailed me.
5020855	5023416	It's funny because, where was it?
5023536	5029338	OL Army Eddie in chat room says, Dear Snedder, I'm a registered boater.
5029679	5031239	Please stop eating cookies.
5034597	5035898	My cookies are top notch.
5038339	5046684	I think now's a good time to go to break and find our rails again and let it cool off a little more in here and get this heat out of here.
5047485	5051888	And we'll be back with Part B. Who knows what's to come in Part B of Orange Launch Radio.
5051928	5053228	I know your Skype calls are coming.
