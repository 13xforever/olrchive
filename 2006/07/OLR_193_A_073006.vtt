Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Mojo.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, July 30th, 2006, E3 might be cancelled. That's right, cancelled!

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
The latest news on the silver lining when we talk about the music of Prey in an interview with Nick Murray of Artistry Entertainment.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.340
Welcome, everybody, to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.340 --> 00:41.540
We are a video game podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know, and we're here

00:41.540 --> 00:42.540
to help you through that.

00:42.540 --> 00:43.540
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:43.540 --> 00:44.660
You might know me as Sky.

00:44.660 --> 00:48.540
Joining me, as always, say hello to my lovely co-host in that corner over there, even though

00:48.540 --> 00:51.860
it's radio and you can't see it, DarkSakura Jamie Summers.

00:51.860 --> 00:52.860
That's me in the corner.

00:52.860 --> 00:54.660
Is that you in the spotlight?

00:54.660 --> 00:55.660
Yeah.

00:55.660 --> 00:59.540
Losing Up.

00:59.540 --> 01:02.300
Also playing pinball, more likely than anything.

01:02.300 --> 01:03.420
I played a lot of pinball.

01:03.420 --> 01:04.940
Say hello as well to Loki.

01:04.940 --> 01:05.940
Hi.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.460
How you doing, Loki?

01:07.460 --> 01:08.460
Good.

01:08.460 --> 01:09.460
All right.

01:09.460 --> 01:14.020
And also joining us once again tonight, crashing the program with his endless wit and charm,

01:14.020 --> 01:16.980
say hello to 23rd Magus, Andrew.

01:16.980 --> 01:19.140
Flattery will get you nowhere.

01:19.140 --> 01:21.740
Do you have any sites that you're pimping out when you're here?

01:21.740 --> 01:25.380
Do you have any sites you're affiliated with you want to pimp my show?

01:25.380 --> 01:27.380
Do you have a podcast? Everybody has a podcast now.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.380
I don't have a podcast yet.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.380
I do listen to...

01:30.380 --> 01:32.380
Ooh, yet! That was a nice teaser. Okay.

01:32.380 --> 01:35.380
I do listen to Warcraft Radio, though, at wcradio.com.

01:35.380 --> 01:37.380
Okay. Cool.

01:38.380 --> 01:40.380
We like independent radio. Good deal.

01:40.380 --> 01:45.380
Alright, let's talk about some gaming news tonight.

01:45.380 --> 01:50.380
But first, we always talk about what we've been playing in our gaming week.

01:50.380 --> 01:54.380
Let's start it off with Dark Soccer. What have you been playing during your gaming week?

01:54.380 --> 02:01.940
loads of stuff I played getting lost in San Francisco this weekend but that's

02:01.940 --> 02:08.200
that like crazy taxi or well I played um we actually went to Santa Cruz this

02:08.200 --> 02:12.640
morning to play actually just to go hang out the boardwalk for a little while and

02:12.640 --> 02:16.760
you know have me not die on that little thing that goes across who is we was

02:16.760 --> 02:24.940
this the girls it was me and Disney Punk 10 mmm Kristen and her friend from LA

02:24.940 --> 02:29.720
Marissa who's now my friend very cool person music nerd like moi so it was

02:29.720 --> 02:32.800
like a girl thing it was a slumber party yeah I was a big summer did you go in

02:32.800 --> 02:37.440
your PJs she'll fight did you stay yeah did you have pillow fight no but we did

02:37.440 --> 02:41.400
have some ice cream talk about boys we actually did eat a lot of ice cream we

02:41.400 --> 02:49.920
We had Dib and Dots, but, um, but, um, we, uh, I played Star Wars, uh, Episode 1 Pinball,

02:49.920 --> 02:51.640
which is, uh, Pinball 2000.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.400
I love the Pinball 2000 games.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.160
Revenge from Mars, Pinball 2000.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.520
Those are the hologram ones, right?

02:56.520 --> 02:57.520
Uh, yeah.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.520
Those are cool.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.840
Um, I played The Sopranos Pinball, which is actually pretty decent.

03:01.840 --> 03:07.120
I played Star Wars, uh, uh, the first Star Wars game, Pinball, that's put out by Sega,

03:07.120 --> 03:14.240
which is kind of a crappy table, and I played, oh shoot, it was another table that was really

03:14.240 --> 03:15.240
good.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.760
I just had a brain storm.

03:17.760 --> 03:18.960
It hurt a little bit.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.120
Why doesn't Sega put out a Sonic pinball table?

03:22.120 --> 03:23.440
They can have a little blue pinball.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.040
They had a Super Mario Brothers pinball table there that wasn't working.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.040
But that's not Sonic.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.540
No, but I played Lord of the Rings pinball, which is also put out by Stern.

03:30.540 --> 03:33.080
One ball to rule them all?

03:33.080 --> 03:34.560
It's a pretty difficult table, actually.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.600
It was a really good machine, though.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.400
Rob, you are stealing my material.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.060
Shush.

03:39.060 --> 03:41.720
But basically Stern is the only company still making pins

03:41.720 --> 03:44.120
right now, pretty much.

03:44.120 --> 03:47.520
I also, we got a new pinball table.

03:47.520 --> 03:51.440
I woke up Friday morning to see Dan face down on the futon.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.920
And in our garage is a Twilight Zone pinball,

03:54.920 --> 03:56.880
which is like one of the best tables ever.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.360
How many pinball machines do you have now?

03:58.360 --> 03:58.800
Five.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.880
You're going to open up an arcade soon.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.920
Yeah, we're going to be selling our Johnny Mnemonic.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.760
Well, that's a good one to sell.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.160
Johnny Mnemonic is a good table.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.200
I've actually played the table, it's a fair table.

04:08.200 --> 04:12.480
But if any of our listeners want to own a Johnny Mnemonic pinball that has lived in

04:12.480 --> 04:15.480
my house that I have touched...

04:15.480 --> 04:17.060
Maybe you can autograph it for a listener.

04:17.060 --> 04:20.960
You know what's funny, though, is that Dan and I decided that that Twilight Zone was

04:20.960 --> 04:25.120
destined to be, because if you lift up the playfield to look at it, if you look at the

04:25.120 --> 04:29.520
very end of it that's facing toward the coin slots, you'll have two dates on there.

04:29.520 --> 04:33.800
The first date is the date that the board was cut, the second date is the date the playfield

04:33.800 --> 04:38.360
was assembled and the date that the board on that Twilight Zone was cut was my birthday.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.360
Oh wow.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.360
It was April 19th.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.360
Very cool.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.120
So I also played some, I actually played DDR today.

04:44.120 --> 04:49.120
I did not die and I played this other, it was a ticket game, but it plays like popin'

04:49.120 --> 04:51.520
music with eggs and there's only four buttons.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.360
It's called rhythm and something.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.520
It was really stupid, the music sucked, but it was like, this is popin' music.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.640
That sounds kinda cute.

04:57.640 --> 05:02.000
It was cute and they had a Tron machine that I didn't play.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.780
All right, say hello to our chat room over at www.orangelaungeradio.com, click on chat.

05:06.780 --> 05:10.340
Funnydale is actually letting us know that Sonic did have a pinball game somewhere between

05:10.340 --> 05:11.880
93 and 95.

05:11.880 --> 05:12.880
So that's news to me.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.880
That is true.

05:13.880 --> 05:14.880
I had forgotten about it.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.880
Oh, wow.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.880
That's cool.

05:16.880 --> 05:17.880
Did it have the little blue...?

05:17.880 --> 05:20.080
I actually haven't played one.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.200
I don't want to have bad jokes come out here.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.200
He doesn't want to say it.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.200
He doesn't want to say it.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.200
He doesn't want to say it.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.200
But did it have a blue colored pinball in the thing?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.200
No.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.200
Oh, okay.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.200
But pinmame.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.200
Oh, I think you get pinmame.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.200
I could play it in there.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.440
Nintendo Maniac 64 says I have a pinball machine, that's cool.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.060
DJ Dark Knight says give me the Simpsons pinball.

05:37.060 --> 05:40.560
That was a good table too, because like the bumpers were the big nuclear reactors, that

05:40.560 --> 05:41.560
was awesome.

05:41.560 --> 05:46.200
They had a funhouse pinball, I hate that machine because that head thing on there, ugh, it's

05:46.200 --> 05:47.200
just ugh.

05:47.200 --> 05:54.360
They had a laughing cell at the boardwalk though, because when we were at California

05:54.360 --> 06:01.360
There was a, you know Playland used to be an amusement park in New York that they had to destroy.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.360
I guess they sold the property or something.

06:04.360 --> 06:12.360
But there are people who made a Playland memorial or museum, and they have games from there and everything.

06:12.360 --> 06:17.360
And they have two laughing styles, so when I saw the one at Santa Cruz, I was like,

06:17.360 --> 06:20.360
Oh, I remember them talking about that. That's really cool.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.860
cool how is the Santa Cruz boardwalk as an arcade because arcades are kind of a

06:23.860 --> 06:28.380
dying breed these days dear god it's like for arcade spread out over the

06:28.380 --> 06:31.900
whole thing now that sounds pretty hot it was cool and they actually have a

06:31.900 --> 06:38.500
beat me in the final oh cool and they have the dance maniac second the jpop

06:38.500 --> 06:41.960
one so our music gaming fans would be very happy at this they have a DDR

06:41.960 --> 06:45.920
supernova Wow oh it's a new unit I haven't even played the why me I played

06:45.920 --> 06:50.120
it at e3 and the Konami gamers I haven't played like the final release version of

06:50.120 --> 06:53.860
Yeah, I actually didn't play because when we went it went to one a little smaller ones just to play skee-ball

06:54.140 --> 06:57.960
They had an extreme there. So Chris and I played that but

06:58.580 --> 07:05.180
Probably lots of the DER free kids spider stomp there. I counted three spider. That's old-school DDR spider stomp

07:05.180 --> 07:10.900
Yeah, and there's it they have a dock upstairs now Derby Inner Club. Very cool. All right

07:12.180 --> 07:16.120
Anyway, Loki. How was your gaming week? It was pretty good

07:17.140 --> 07:19.020
I've been playing

07:19.020 --> 07:25.220
the hell out of the Saints Row demo. Got mine. Actually it was funny because I thought my magazine,

07:25.220 --> 07:29.060
the official Xbox magazine, I thought my subscription ended, but it has now

07:29.060 --> 07:32.140
after I got the demo, which is, you know, where it counts.

07:32.140 --> 07:35.340
And it's really fun. Saints Row is

07:35.340 --> 07:39.300
basically Grand Theft Auto. I mean, they've improved on a few things and

07:39.300 --> 07:40.620
there's a few things that are kind of

07:40.620 --> 07:45.780
not as great. But for the most part, it's very enjoyable and

07:45.780 --> 07:49.660
That demo we play for an entire hour each lunch.

07:49.660 --> 07:53.460
What are the things that are different? The things that are different, first off,

07:53.460 --> 07:56.860
the camera's a lot better

07:56.860 --> 08:00.980
with the right analog stick and like for example if you have pipe bombs and stuff

08:00.980 --> 08:02.780
you can toss stuff behind you

08:02.780 --> 08:05.940
as you're running, you know, which you can't do in Grand Theft Auto.

08:05.940 --> 08:10.620
Also most of the guns you can run and fire at the same time and stuff like that.

08:10.620 --> 08:15.220
Plus the cars explode a lot better, shrapnel flies everywhere and you can

08:15.220 --> 08:20.980
actually get hit with shrapnel and stuff like that. You can do some of the fun things. You

08:20.980 --> 08:27.300
can rob stores and hold people up at gunpoint and stuff like that. You can beat old people

08:27.300 --> 08:33.860
and steal their money, which is great. Hooray! And one other fun thing you can do, gang wars

08:33.860 --> 08:40.340
and stuff like that. It's just very involved and the demo so far is pretty awesome. Just

08:40.340 --> 08:44.260
the sheer amount of stuff you can do in the game

08:44.260 --> 08:45.540
is pretty cool.

08:45.540 --> 08:50.300
You can drive cars into gas tanks and make them explode

08:50.300 --> 08:52.420
which is awesome.

08:52.420 --> 08:55.860
Let's see, other than that I've been playing a little bit

08:55.860 --> 09:00.800
of just, you know, other Xbox stuff like Ridge Racer 6 a little bit

09:00.800 --> 09:05.280
and haven't really played too much of ChromeHounds. I did finish like the

09:05.280 --> 09:08.620
was it soldier mission thing or whatever and

09:08.620 --> 09:11.860
Speaking of ChromeHounds real quick, Blaze Revolution in chat says

09:11.860 --> 09:15.060
he's having problems getting into the OL army clan on ChromeHounds. How did the

09:15.060 --> 09:15.820
folks get in there?

09:15.820 --> 09:19.900
Well apparently from what people have told me now, someone has to be online

09:19.900 --> 09:25.260
in order to join. So I have to be online at some point in order for people to join.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.020
So watch the forums. I'll

09:27.020 --> 09:30.780
take a time where I'm actually logged in and then everybody can come join.

09:30.780 --> 09:35.020
OrangeLoungeRadio.com click on forums. Exactly. The other thing though that's

09:35.020 --> 09:36.100
kind of fun and neat

09:36.100 --> 09:39.980
is I think a while back I mentioned I signed up for the Atari

09:39.980 --> 09:43.220
beta for Test Drive Unlimited and I got in

09:43.220 --> 09:47.460
and I got my disc and it's interesting on PlayStation 2

09:47.460 --> 09:50.660
the game... Wait, aren't you under like an NDA or something? No.

09:50.660 --> 09:53.820
Anyways, the game, at least not that I read

09:53.820 --> 09:57.940
and if you didn't read it then hell, who cares?

09:57.940 --> 10:03.260
If I didn't see it, it's not illegal. Anyways, so the game itself

10:03.260 --> 10:08.040
it's pretty cool I mean it plays very similar to the Xbox 360 demo that I

10:08.040 --> 10:08.600
played

10:08.600 --> 10:12.360
of course graphics are a lot less you know Xbox 360 but

10:12.360 --> 10:16.120
they do the job you know it is an online game you know completely so

10:16.120 --> 10:20.920
if you still roll down the window that was an impressive feature in the Xbox

10:20.920 --> 10:22.040
demo here's the thing though

10:22.040 --> 10:25.640
a lot of stuff isn't finished yet because it's beta like all the interiors like I went

10:25.640 --> 10:27.920
oh I'm gonna look at the interior of the car see it looks like

10:27.920 --> 10:31.440
nothing happened it's all glitched out I'm like okay that doesn't work

10:31.440 --> 10:39.440
I'd like to see what my driver looked like. There's no driver, it's just the ghost car, because they haven't finished that yet, because it's still beta.

10:39.440 --> 10:44.440
But it's still fun though, and you can drive off-road just as easily as you can with this car.

10:44.440 --> 10:51.440
I don't know, the PlayStation 2 version, I probably wouldn't pick it up because I have a 360, so why bother?

10:51.440 --> 11:02.440
And you know what's weird is unless they drop the Playstation 2 one, I think the 360 one is actually going to be cheaper, because it's going to be $39.99, so why not pick it up?

11:02.440 --> 11:11.440
But it's a fun game, you know, it's pretty cool, and it's definitely easy to get online with, which I haven't played too many online games, but I know there's been some difficulty.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.440
No lag, I haven't noticed any lag in it, but it's pretty fun.

11:14.440 --> 11:19.640
fun. Yeah, Hitstun also really loved your review there on the graphics. The graphics

11:19.640 --> 11:26.440
are a lot less Xbox 360. They're very stripped down, very, very, very stripped down. How

11:26.440 --> 11:30.140
so? What's missing? Just a lot of the detail that's in there. A lot of the, like, definitely

11:30.140 --> 11:35.400
textures are, you know, it's just not as detailed as, like, the Xbox 360. It reminds me of the

11:35.400 --> 11:39.800
old Test Drive games, which, you know, last Test Drive I played other than this, which

11:39.800 --> 11:44.520
was a long time ago, Test Drive 3 on the PC. I mean, that's when the cars were blocks.

11:44.520 --> 11:48.000
I mean, just... Yeah, I was gonna say, probably the last Test Drive game I've played seriously

11:48.000 --> 11:55.440
was like Test Drive 2 The Duel, was that it, on Commodore 64. It was pretty old. I mean,

11:55.440 --> 11:58.960
this was back in the day when Test Drive, you just basically had to get, you know, to

11:58.960 --> 12:04.240
the end of the map or whatever, and that was a journey. I mean, I would always try to take

12:04.240 --> 12:11.240
the shortcuts through the fields and run over the 2D chicken or whatever and just... I don't

12:11.240 --> 12:15.080
know. It's a good game. All you have is a PlayStation 2. It's still going to be very

12:15.080 --> 12:18.760
good. So, you know, check it out. Or even the PSP one, when that comes out, will be

12:18.760 --> 12:23.240
pretty decent. So, they're worth checking out. And then I think, of course, more Grand

12:23.240 --> 12:27.640
Theft Auto. And, you know, we're getting to a point now with Grand Theft Auto. Every

12:27.640 --> 12:32.240
day we play this game, the more and more frustrated we are at the developers and the more we want

12:32.240 --> 12:35.920
to kill them because of how buggy the multiplayer is.

12:35.920 --> 12:40.200
And it's really sad because I wish I had a way to contact the developers at Rockstar

12:40.200 --> 12:44.520
because I have so much feedback I can give them on their game, both positive and negative,

12:44.520 --> 12:50.440
because I've basically played this game every single day for at least 30 minutes.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.440
So yeah.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.040
They need to give me a call.

12:53.040 --> 12:57.800
If anyone from Rockstar is listening, contact Loki at loki.orangelaunchradio.com.

12:57.800 --> 12:58.800
L-O-K-I.

12:58.800 --> 13:03.080
I hope to god, because this is built on the Vice City engine

13:03.080 --> 13:07.600
Liberty City Stories was, and now that Vice City Stories is coming out, you bet your ass

13:07.600 --> 13:10.680
they're not going to do anything to fix any of the multiplayer because they're

13:10.680 --> 13:15.360
fucking stupid. But I'll still buy the game.

13:15.360 --> 13:20.200
When does the Saints Rogue demo get released for the rest of us? I heard Tuesday

13:20.200 --> 13:23.500
Is it? Or August 1st. Sweet. So

13:23.500 --> 13:27.760
check it out. I will. For whatever reason

13:27.760 --> 13:32.320
It's not up that day. You can always find it at the official Xbox magazine.

13:32.320 --> 13:37.760
Alrighty. Mr. 23rd Magus, AKA Andrew, how was your gaming week?

13:37.760 --> 13:43.120
It was alright. I was looking to make some crazy money, but instead I just sat my ass on the couch,

13:43.840 --> 13:50.240
sort of chair, yeah chair, and played Tellur-Iris. You could tell that Nippon Ichi did all the

13:50.240 --> 13:53.200
translating because the script is absolutely hilarious.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.160
What is this game?

13:54.160 --> 13:56.400
Uh, Tellur-Iris Eternal Mantle.

13:56.400 --> 14:04.400
Just a little dialogue with the catgirl asking the protagonist to sleep in bed with her.

14:04.400 --> 14:09.400
The response is, I can't, the ESRB would go nuts.

14:09.400 --> 14:17.400
Other than that, I haven't been doing much gaming, mostly because of the heat affecting my computer.

14:17.400 --> 14:22.400
I have been trying Fable off and on, and it's the first time I've actually played Fable.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.400
PC or Xbox?

14:23.400 --> 14:24.400
PC.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.400
What do you think?

14:25.400 --> 14:30.400
It's interesting. It's not what it was hyped up to be, obviously.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.400
How so?

14:31.400 --> 14:35.400
But it's still pretty damn fun. It's not a completely open world like it was promised.

14:35.400 --> 14:40.400
But it is still pretty fun. It plays more like Knights of the Old Republic, with the whole good and evil thing.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.400
Okay.

14:41.400 --> 14:51.400
My Gaming Week. I actually played quite a bit as well. I downloaded the 99 Knights demo because I really liked the game at E3 when I got to play it.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.960
I seem to remember when I actually played the full game at E3, it was a lot easier than

14:55.960 --> 14:58.280
the demo, because I died like three times in the demo.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.400
I think I was doing something wrong.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.400
The game's really fun.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.520
I liked it a lot.

15:04.520 --> 15:10.240
It's kind of a button masher, but it reminds me of a game like Final Fight or probably

15:10.240 --> 15:13.720
more rather something like Golden Axe, but on a much bigger scale.

15:13.720 --> 15:18.320
I mean, in Golden Axe, you cannot kill 50 people in one swoop of the sword and things

15:18.320 --> 15:23.480
like that, and you can't stab somebody on the end of your sword and then use his body

15:23.480 --> 15:24.840
to attack other people.

15:24.840 --> 15:29.200
It's fun, I mean you're fighting armies, just lots and lots of people.

15:29.200 --> 15:32.840
The game's pretty intricate, it looks great, I really enjoyed the demo, I definitely want

15:32.840 --> 15:35.360
to pick up the full game even if I suck at it.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.680
I noticed already in the chatroom though some other folks didn't seem to like the game.

15:38.680 --> 15:42.160
It definitely seems like the type of game you're either going to really like or you're

15:42.160 --> 15:46.200
going to really hate maybe because of its simplicity and the fact that it is kind of

15:46.200 --> 15:48.920
a bit of a button masher. I think some people are really going to get turned off by that.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.980
And a lot of people are comparing it to Dynasty Warriors, to be honest. I think this is actually

15:51.980 --> 15:56.180
a lot better than Dynasty Warriors. It definitely looks a lot better because Dynasty Warriors

15:56.180 --> 16:02.000
5 fucking sucked on the Xbox 360. They didn't really do anything. And Samurai Warriors 2,

16:02.000 --> 16:06.020
when that comes out, that one's going to suck also because also another port without any

16:06.020 --> 16:11.800
effort is basically what it was. But it looks, to be honest, this demo looks a lot better

16:11.800 --> 16:18.200
than what I remember from E3. It looks like a lot more fun. So, I don't know. And it just

16:18.200 --> 16:24.800
seems more fun than Dynasty Warriors was. Alright. Let's see what else I've been playing.

16:24.800 --> 16:31.000
I actually picked up- did you have something? Oh, okay. I picked back up Oblivion randomly.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.720
I had tried playing this game a while back and I thought it was very pretty, but I think

16:34.720 --> 16:38.720
the problem was I had someone hovering over my shoulder telling me what to do, like everything,

16:38.720 --> 16:41.640
and I think that might have ruined the gaming experience for me, so I went back and checked

16:41.640 --> 16:44.760
it out, and it's great.

16:44.760 --> 16:45.760
I wouldn't be that person.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.760
Do something, would I?

16:46.760 --> 16:49.960
No, it's not, it wasn't really you, it was kind of everybody was hovering, everybody

16:49.960 --> 16:52.840
else had played it but me, because a lot of people, and everybody was like, do this, do

16:52.840 --> 16:55.320
this, do this, and I'm like, shut up!

16:55.320 --> 17:00.020
But I had a chance to just sit down and sort of explore it for myself, and it's so, I guess

17:00.020 --> 17:03.260
the only word I can use to describe this game is vast.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.180
You really can do just whatever you want.

17:05.180 --> 17:10.800
It reminds me of like a first person shooter but with swords, but yet the world is open

17:10.800 --> 17:15.900
and you can go anywhere you want, but that vastness is kind of like a good thing and

17:15.900 --> 17:20.300
a bad thing because that vastness, I'm so used to very linear types of story in games,

17:20.300 --> 17:24.260
so it was really hard for me to go, oh, I could just go anywhere I want and do these

17:24.260 --> 17:26.260
other quests before doing the main quest.

17:26.260 --> 17:28.980
Because I tried to just go, da da da da da, start doing the main quest.

17:28.980 --> 17:34.220
I got murdered ten ways from Sunday, like so horribly, because my character wasn't buffed

17:34.220 --> 17:38.340
up enough yet, I hadn't really practiced with spells and all that stuff, my character didn't

17:38.340 --> 17:42.960
have enough stuff, so it kind of took me a little while to get used to that, but it's

17:42.960 --> 17:49.100
a great game, and I think it's a way for folks who are in the first person shooters in that

17:49.100 --> 17:53.940
genre game, sort of like a really good entry level to RPGs, maybe you're the type of person

17:53.940 --> 17:58.440
that's like, I hate RPGs, well maybe this is more your style, there's different types

17:58.440 --> 18:04.660
of RPGs, this is not a Final Fantasy RPG by any means, this is completely different, it

18:04.660 --> 18:08.780
It really reminds me of an old PC, which makes sense when you consider what the game is.

18:08.780 --> 18:11.780
It reminds me of an old PC-type role-playing game.

18:11.780 --> 18:12.940
That's more what it is.

18:12.940 --> 18:17.820
But I had a great time with it, and the graphics are gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.

18:17.820 --> 18:21.080
And I think the way that they expand it in Marketplace is just great.

18:21.080 --> 18:26.860
This is definitely probably the title to have at launch.

18:26.860 --> 18:27.860
It's a great game.

18:27.860 --> 18:28.860
Loved it.

18:28.860 --> 18:32.900
Although, honestly, I just don't know how long I'm going to be able to put up with it

18:32.900 --> 18:36.320
before my brain explodes from all that stuff to do and there's just a million other games

18:36.320 --> 18:39.660
I want to play. Because if I get too far into Oblivion, I'm not going to play anything else.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.540
Here's the best thing you've got to know about Oblivion.

18:41.540 --> 18:42.660
Okay.

18:42.660 --> 18:48.620
Oblivion, join the guilds. Because when you join the guilds, you can clear off their entire

18:48.620 --> 18:54.480
shelves of everything and go sell it for money. That's the best part. I spent like a couple

18:54.480 --> 18:59.300
hours just clearing off everything until I found out about the dupe, you know, trick

18:59.300 --> 19:05.060
you can do but anyways I I've cleared off like just rated the entire you know

19:05.060 --> 19:09.060
mage guild from all stole all their books and all their weapons and all

19:09.060 --> 19:13.380
their potions and everything I just must have had like thousands of books that

19:13.380 --> 19:18.020
I've taken and sold back as great DJ kibbles and bits in our chat room says

19:18.020 --> 19:21.060
oblivion is one of those games you have to experience on your own it's just too

19:21.060 --> 19:25.700
damn huge to rush though I agree this is not like a typical gaming experience

19:25.700 --> 19:28.780
it's something you really have to invest a little time in Andrew you said

19:28.780 --> 19:32.500
you were having problems you know just getting slaughtered in oblivion right yeah here's

19:32.500 --> 19:37.980
the thing in oblivion the way it works is the enemies level up as you do oh great if

19:37.980 --> 19:41.940
you level up they're gonna level up and you're still gonna answer i think i thought i remembered

19:41.940 --> 19:45.820
green that somewhere gear up that's what i need because i'm still using like the crappy

19:45.820 --> 19:50.060
gear you get in the beginning minus what i raided from dead bodies you know so that yeah

19:50.060 --> 19:56.380
i need to gear up yeah gear up because when they hit me i take massive damage here i thought

19:56.380 --> 19:57.380
I thought I was going to say that.

19:57.380 --> 20:05.700
Anyway, let's see, I picked up Prey because I like the demo, but I haven't played past

20:05.700 --> 20:10.620
the demo sequence yet, so more to come on Prey next time.

20:10.620 --> 20:13.820
Just they have achievements actually in Prey where you can play the poker and the arcade

20:13.820 --> 20:16.340
games and the bar, and I think that's kind of funny.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.340
Really?

20:17.340 --> 20:18.340
Yeah.

20:18.340 --> 20:19.340
Oh that's cute.

20:19.340 --> 20:20.340
I like that, that's great.

20:20.340 --> 20:22.940
One of the things with Oblivion is you can make poison tipped weapons and stuff like

20:22.940 --> 20:25.340
that, so you can shoot them with a poison tipped arrow and just kind of wait for them

20:25.340 --> 20:30.540
and die. Also real quickly, one other game I want to mention, Cloning Clyde. I picked

20:30.540 --> 20:34.600
that up too from Xbox Live Arcade. Definitely reminds me of an old Super Nintendo puzzler

20:34.600 --> 20:39.100
with a sense of humor. I keep wanting to say, like, Krusty's Fun House type game, except

20:39.100 --> 20:44.200
Krusty's Fun House wasn't that great, but Cloning Clyde's fun. I mean, if you are curious

20:44.200 --> 20:47.400
if you're going to like Cloning Clyde or not, seriously, just check out the demo, because

20:47.400 --> 20:51.700
I think it's got a really good demo that really demonstrates what the game is all about. And

20:51.700 --> 20:56.340
it's free you can't go wrong because I've had people send me like some folks that listen to the show had me on their

20:56.340 --> 21:00.360
Friends list and I've gotten messages from people saying, you know, dude, should I get cloning Clyde?

21:00.360 --> 21:02.200
I'm like seriously check out the demo

21:02.200 --> 21:06.720
It's a really good representative of what the game is all about and if you like the demo you're gonna like the game

21:06.720 --> 21:08.720
I think what about Galaga?

21:09.060 --> 21:15.100
Galaga I checked out too. Thank you for reminding me a very easy achievement points super easy achievement points

21:15.100 --> 21:20.420
I mean, I had a friend on my Xbox Live list who got all 200 achievement points within

21:20.420 --> 21:22.060
like a couple hours.

21:22.060 --> 21:25.420
The thing about Galaga is that it lets you continue from the stage where you died.

21:25.420 --> 21:28.860
So getting that level 30 achievement or whatever is not a problem.

21:28.860 --> 21:32.060
And all the monsters and those achievements, you kind of pick those up along the way.

21:32.060 --> 21:38.020
So there's very few that require a lot of real skill.

21:38.020 --> 21:45.020
it's not really an arcade game that I remember fondly from the 80s

21:45.020 --> 21:48.740
but I know other people do who are probably yelling at me right now for

21:48.740 --> 21:51.460
saying that I mean it just really depends what type of games you were

21:51.460 --> 21:52.020
raised on

21:52.020 --> 21:55.140
I think there is an audience for Galaga I don't think I was it because I got

21:55.140 --> 21:56.860
bored of it pretty quick. Black Wolf

21:56.860 --> 22:01.300
Bobby he was saying that be careful with the side images because it causes burn-in

22:01.300 --> 22:04.420
on your screens. Wow

22:04.420 --> 22:07.660
well it's not a game I would play for an incredibly long time anyway

22:07.660 --> 22:11.020
What you just said reminded me of something too. What's that?

22:11.020 --> 22:14.940
If anyone's ever interested in any of those Namco keychains like they were handing out at E3,

22:14.940 --> 22:18.540
you can actually buy them at Kidrobot's store.

22:18.540 --> 22:23.620
Where's that? Well, Kidrobot has a site online. They're the ones that were selling those big

22:23.620 --> 22:27.860
vinyl gorillas figures. Oh, okay. But they have a store on Hayton Ashbury in San

22:27.860 --> 22:28.380
Francisco.

22:28.380 --> 22:31.940
Speaking of Namco and E3 and stuff, I

22:31.940 --> 22:36.180
saw some old pictures last night. I found some old pictures. I found the pictures from

22:36.180 --> 22:39.580
the year that they were demoing Wiiheart Katamari and remember when they had the

22:39.580 --> 22:42.340
giant Katamari and everybody was putting their stuff on it so I found the picture of us

22:42.340 --> 22:43.180
putting the ferret

22:43.180 --> 22:48.220
on the Katamari. I also put one of our

22:48.220 --> 22:51.900
demo samplers on there and a reject false icon sticker.

22:51.900 --> 22:56.980
Yeah look see in chat GK128 says Galaga sucks you sir suck.

22:56.980 --> 23:02.580
It's not that Galaga sucks it certainly led the way for a certain genre of games

23:02.580 --> 23:03.300
it's just

23:03.300 --> 23:07.740
it's not my bag baby okay you can continue from where you died

23:07.740 --> 23:13.020
yeah it's that kind of eliminates a whole hardcore factor of Galaga

23:13.020 --> 23:16.860
they hit it with a nerf bat but you don't have to you don't have to why can they put

23:16.860 --> 23:17.060
like

23:17.060 --> 23:20.060
Ikaruga on live I don't know okay I mean that would be

23:20.060 --> 23:23.300
but that's right there's better stuff coming you actually just reminded me of the other

23:23.300 --> 23:25.100
pinball I saw was Austin Powers pinball

23:25.100 --> 23:28.580
but no you know what actually we need radiant silver gun

23:28.580 --> 23:33.020
on a there we go thank you Legend of Zaku

23:33.020 --> 23:36.860
right there that radiance over going to be awesome Zaku has it as well Gradius

23:36.860 --> 23:40.240
greater than Galaga I would love to see Gradius but then again I already

23:40.240 --> 23:43.540
have Gradius collection on PSP so maybe not so much. I thought Gradius was coming

23:43.540 --> 23:47.540
was it? I think it was one of the ones. I know there was some shooter that was in that. Well Gradius and Contra

23:47.540 --> 23:51.840
Contra and Super Contra are coming. Are they? Oh Contra I love Contra

23:51.840 --> 23:55.820
I know Contra was I didn't know it was Contra and Super Contra. Contra and Super Contra

23:55.820 --> 23:59.620
and I think Gradius and I've heard some other ones and

23:59.620 --> 24:02.880
Street Bear 2 next week. I was gonna say I saw Time Pilot

24:02.880 --> 24:06.460
in that preview too. I like Time Pilot. I think Rally-X

24:06.460 --> 24:11.020
is coming. What else? Next week of course Street Fighter 2

24:11.020 --> 24:15.180
which I couldn't give a shit. You know what's funny now that it's finally here

24:15.180 --> 24:19.000
I'm very meh about the whole thing. I'm like I kinda don't care anymore now that it's

24:19.000 --> 24:19.720
here it's like

24:19.720 --> 24:24.160
is it really gonna be that great? I don't know.

24:24.160 --> 24:27.760
By the way, something else I think that our chat room might be vaguely interested in

24:27.760 --> 24:30.960
is that the person that we bought our Twilight Zone from was the guy who

24:30.960 --> 24:37.680
own working designs. We actually have a Goemon doll now that they were going to put out with

24:37.680 --> 24:41.120
the next game they were going to do. Let's get them on the show. You should talk to them,

24:41.120 --> 24:46.160
I'll see. I also have a copy of Sega Ages for Saturn. Very cool. But I thought that

24:46.160 --> 24:50.720
that would be just a fun little bit. Eddie of the O.L. Army says Konami was a lot better than

24:50.720 --> 24:57.120
Namco in the arcade. Well, it just depends what you're into. It depends on if you're at a Namco

24:57.120 --> 25:02.020
arcade. It just depends on the type of games you're into. Alright, enough about my gaming

25:02.020 --> 25:05.580
week, that's enough. Let's do some housekeeping real, real quick and then we'll get into the

25:05.580 --> 25:09.020
gaming news. Just some quick housekeeping things. OrangeDawnTradio.com had some website

25:09.020 --> 25:12.220
downtime earlier this week. We're not sure what caused it. I think it was some type of

25:12.220 --> 25:16.360
DNS issue, tech stuff that goes above my head. Needless to say, when stuff like that happens,

25:16.360 --> 25:21.140
our fearless webmaster, Mr. VX JasonXV, who we love and adore because he does the job

25:21.140 --> 25:26.740
for free, is on things like that. So, we're sorry, but you know, that type of stuff is

25:26.740 --> 25:30.900
gonna be inevitable, that things go down, you know, remember it's all free to you

25:30.900 --> 25:34.620
guys, so just keep in mind things are gonna happen once in a while. We are

25:34.620 --> 25:38.620
addressing some things with the website. You may see some real facelifts coming

25:38.620 --> 25:41.700
to the website in the future, but a lot of that is a long ways down the line.

25:41.700 --> 25:46.340
Can't talk about much more than that yet. We could, but it'd be a lie, and they

25:46.340 --> 25:49.380
would have to kill you. That's right, we'd have to reveal what

25:49.380 --> 25:53.260
happens at the secret OLR staff meetings, and then you'd have to die. And then the

25:53.260 --> 25:55.540
the murders commence.

25:55.540 --> 25:58.980
Also we wanted to say something about the podcast awards real quick.

25:58.980 --> 26:03.020
The podcast awards nominations were announced and we're not there.

26:03.020 --> 26:07.960
But oh well, the folks that were nominated, all five of them, independent podcasts, which

26:07.960 --> 26:08.960
is pretty awesome.

26:08.960 --> 26:09.960
That's awesome.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.800
And we said, you know, we'd be happy as long as an independent won it.

26:12.800 --> 26:16.280
You know, we can't, we don't want to hog it.

26:16.280 --> 26:20.540
We can share, no, in all seriousness, folks that were nominated, there's some great shows

26:20.540 --> 26:21.540
in there.

26:21.540 --> 26:26.500
I know the folks at Gamertag, very passionate about what they do, DreamStation, huge community

26:26.500 --> 26:31.460
over there, VGN Radio, fellow all-games show, completely different vibe than what we do

26:31.460 --> 26:32.460
here, but that's awesome.

26:32.460 --> 26:38.340
I think every independent show should do their own thing, Podtacular, Halo, nothing but Halo,

26:38.340 --> 26:42.020
which for some gamers, that's what they do, nothing but Halo, you know, good show over

26:42.020 --> 26:43.420
there as well.

26:43.420 --> 26:48.100
So have fun, go vote, vote for an independent podcast, you don't have a choice, you have

26:48.100 --> 26:49.820
to vote for an independent podcast.

26:49.820 --> 26:56.580
And maybe we could invite the winners on our show so we could hand over our crown, like

26:56.580 --> 26:57.580
at Miss America.

26:57.580 --> 26:58.580
What they do.

26:58.580 --> 27:00.380
Where is our crown?

27:00.380 --> 27:02.700
I think it's sitting on Jamie's fireplace, actually.

27:02.700 --> 27:05.860
It is sitting on my fireplace, yes, it's on my mantle.

27:05.860 --> 27:07.700
So we'll, I don't know, we'll come up with something.

27:07.700 --> 27:13.060
No, seriously though, have fun, remember, independent podcasts, we're there to support

27:13.060 --> 27:14.060
each other.

27:14.060 --> 27:17.880
I think every independent podcaster brings something different to the table.

27:17.880 --> 27:24.240
And you look at those shows I've previously named and they've all got something different.

27:24.240 --> 27:28.000
We have that history being the music game and we go to anime expos because a lot of

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
our fan base goes there.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.940
These other shows have their own spin on things that they do.

27:31.940 --> 27:33.920
So it's great.

27:33.920 --> 27:38.480
And diversity is what makes the independent stand out over the commercial stuff.

27:38.480 --> 27:42.040
In a way though, I almost kind of feel sorry for whoever wins because you're going to have

27:42.040 --> 27:45.960
to put up with that same backlash that we did last year from kind of the corporates

27:45.960 --> 27:50.940
who, I think, probably didn't like it that we won because there was some nasty stuff

27:50.940 --> 27:55.780
written about us, including, oh, we're liars, we're drunks, dah, dah, dah, whatever.

27:55.780 --> 27:56.940
Only on certain shows.

27:56.940 --> 28:01.020
We're still here, we're almost at episode 200, you Corp cast are not going to scare

28:01.020 --> 28:04.060
us away, and, you know, so what, we didn't get nominated.

28:04.060 --> 28:07.900
It would be fun to do an entire show of lies.

28:07.900 --> 28:09.420
I would love that.

28:09.420 --> 28:10.420
That would be awesome.

28:10.420 --> 28:13.460
Lying and being drunk, that'd be excellent.

28:13.460 --> 28:14.460
Alright.

28:14.460 --> 28:18.900
So have fun with the podcast awards this year.

28:18.900 --> 28:20.220
Go vote.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.020
And vote in the other categories, too,

28:22.020 --> 28:23.300
because there's some other independent podcasters

28:23.300 --> 28:24.100
in other categories.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.780
There's some I've been listening to that have nothing

28:26.780 --> 28:29.020
to do with gaming I've been listening to since we started

28:29.020 --> 28:31.060
podcasting, and good stuff out there.

28:31.060 --> 28:33.860
All right, let's get into some actual gaming news now,

28:33.860 --> 28:36.940
and huge news, Jamie, huge news.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.220
It's very big.

28:39.220 --> 28:43.260
Well, you know how every year we get our butts into E3

28:43.260 --> 28:47.260
and cover all the big news that's coming out, well guess what?

28:47.260 --> 28:51.880
That has gone right down the crapper. There will be no more

28:51.880 --> 28:56.580
E3 as it is known now. That's an important footnote,

28:56.580 --> 29:00.940
as it is known now. There might be something. Well basically

29:00.940 --> 29:04.780
Doug Lowenstein, who's the president of Entertainment Software Association,

29:04.780 --> 29:08.460
is going to make the announcement that it's

29:08.460 --> 29:12.500
gone by by kaput. Yeah, it kind of stinks that we're recording on Sunday

29:12.500 --> 29:15.580
because there'll be more information on this tomorrow, Monday,

29:15.580 --> 29:18.780
but we won't be here till next Sunday to really talk about it.

29:18.780 --> 29:22.940
Well, a lot of the reason being is that

29:22.940 --> 29:26.140
the publishers are, I guess, they're like,

29:26.140 --> 29:30.100
you need to pay attention to us.

29:30.100 --> 29:33.220
We want love too.

29:33.220 --> 29:36.340
So, they whined,

29:36.340 --> 29:39.700
and E3 listened. So, no more E3.

29:39.700 --> 29:46.700
But there is talk of smaller shows next year, different, more focused events.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.700
There are already other shows that go on.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.700
Yeah, like the developers put on their own things.

29:50.700 --> 29:52.700
Microsoft did something recently, right?

29:52.700 --> 29:55.700
Yeah, the Microsoft Vision retail conference.

29:55.700 --> 29:57.700
Konami's got something coming, I don't know if I'm supposed to say that,

29:57.700 --> 30:02.700
but Konami has something coming up, and there's other stuff too, as well.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.700
A lot of the own developers put on their own shows.

30:05.700 --> 30:07.700
Microsoft's X06 is coming up.

30:07.700 --> 30:10.380
It's gonna suck to not have it all on one roof.

30:10.380 --> 30:15.040
However, it will keep, I think, a more even flow of information out for

30:15.040 --> 30:18.180
people. It makes it easier on us. Because, you know,

30:18.180 --> 30:21.300
if we have the different shows

30:21.300 --> 30:24.580
come up, introduce their news, we're not putting

30:24.580 --> 30:29.820
out. You know, Loki was working, you know, his butt off on the PSP site.

30:29.820 --> 30:33.720
Instead of having to cram everything in and get the information out there before

30:33.720 --> 30:34.560
the next guy,

30:34.560 --> 30:39.440
There's actually going we'll be able to put it out in more digestible forms for other people. I think

30:41.300 --> 30:46.760
Did you see this coming did anybody see this coming yeah, I saw them fussing about it

30:46.760 --> 30:49.280
I thought they were just gonna close it off to certain groups

30:49.280 --> 30:52.400
But well, maybe that might be what they're doing because we you know

30:52.400 --> 30:57.560
We've heard downsizing of the show mentioned a lot where it's gonna be, you know, a very select audience

30:58.120 --> 31:03.640
Meeting with developers in you know meeting rooms, but that kind of screws a lot of the small people out

31:03.640 --> 31:06.640
It screws over the small press. There's no way in hell we're gonna get in there.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.640
And it's gonna screw over Kenshiya.

31:08.640 --> 31:13.640
Everybody that had a show in Kenshiya, with the exception of Red Octane, is gonna get screwed too.

31:13.640 --> 31:17.640
Which is kinda sad, because there was some pretty kick-butt stuff in Kenshiya.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.640
How are they gonna get it out there now?

31:20.640 --> 31:22.640
It's kinda sad. I don't know.

31:22.640 --> 31:26.640
But I mean, it's hard to say because all we have to go off of right now is like, kind of a...

31:26.640 --> 31:32.920
Well, I wouldn't call it rumors, but a very cloudy statement is all we really have to

31:32.920 --> 31:34.920
go off of right now.

31:34.920 --> 31:40.920
But you know, for me, E3 kind of started becoming a farce when there was that whole line of

31:40.920 --> 31:42.640
people to see Paris Hilton.

31:42.640 --> 31:46.600
Seriously, that was my first clue that something's up with the show that's going to change.

31:46.600 --> 31:51.200
I mean, that whole frickin' hours-long line of people to see Paris Hilton, that's not

31:51.200 --> 31:52.200
what E3 is about.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.680
Adam West, that's okay.

31:53.680 --> 31:54.680
He's cool.

31:54.680 --> 31:55.680
Paris Hilton?

31:55.680 --> 31:59.940
Just because she had a game, and how did she have a game anyways?

31:59.940 --> 32:04.320
Her likenesses in it, I don't know, it's kind of stupid.

32:04.320 --> 32:10.800
Blaze Revolution says, okay, independent gamers conference, something for those Kensha Halls

32:10.800 --> 32:11.800
companies.

32:11.800 --> 32:17.320
I think it's a great idea, but will it be covered by the big gaming sites?

32:17.320 --> 32:22.380
And granted, we cover it, and we'd like to think that we could take on corporate, but

32:22.380 --> 32:25.660
the fact of the matter is a lot of people get their news from the corporate

32:25.660 --> 32:28.800
site so the corporate folks don't cover it or give it a little footnote in their

32:28.800 --> 32:29.940
magazine.

32:29.940 --> 32:33.340
The fact of the matter is that corporates are the ones that are the top of the

32:33.340 --> 32:36.780
press list anyways when it comes to these small sites or

32:36.780 --> 32:40.100
get togethers anyways. Like EA's

32:40.100 --> 32:44.180
just have their little press event and stuff and

32:44.180 --> 32:47.780
yeah the smaller guys don't see invites because you know what

32:47.780 --> 32:51.660
in their eyes the smaller guy doesn't really matter.

32:51.660 --> 32:56.060
Pleader says, oh no, what will G4 do for one week a year?

32:56.060 --> 32:59.460
Bandit in our chat room says, did anyone see the video of when E3 opened this year and

32:59.460 --> 33:02.180
saw how many people were running just to get to the Wii?

33:02.180 --> 33:03.180
Yeah?

33:03.180 --> 33:04.180
Yeah.

33:04.180 --> 33:08.260
I mean, granted, the Wii was a great thing to check out, but that probably is part of

33:08.260 --> 33:10.420
the reason why E3 is changing.

33:10.420 --> 33:12.420
You put all that together.

33:12.420 --> 33:15.820
So I don't know.

33:15.820 --> 33:19.540
What would you like to see happen from all this?

33:19.540 --> 33:22.860
I really do think the idea of

33:22.860 --> 33:26.580
independent shows being the more likely thing

33:26.580 --> 33:29.580
I really do like the idea of different specific companies

33:29.580 --> 33:33.060
putting out events where they can, I think, cater to

33:33.060 --> 33:36.860
their audience a little bit better. Put more focus into instead of just their

33:36.860 --> 33:37.820
little corner of

33:37.820 --> 33:42.700
E3 and having to compete with everybody else there. I think it'd be cheaper for them

33:42.700 --> 33:46.140
anyways because they all have to make these giant elaborate booths. They can just rent out a

33:46.140 --> 33:50.340
building like Konami's gamer day they rented out what a club

33:50.340 --> 33:53.980
and they just had you know some machine set up and stuff I'm sure that was a lot

33:53.980 --> 33:55.220
less money for them

33:55.220 --> 33:59.380
then you know because a club in the middle of the day when it's not open anyways

33:59.380 --> 34:03.540
I mean that probably didn't cost as much as running a multi-million dollar

34:03.540 --> 34:04.100
booth

34:04.100 --> 34:08.300
Banda in chat has a good idea independent shows open to the public

34:08.300 --> 34:12.220
why not have your Kenshi a show that's open to the public

34:12.220 --> 34:15.820
get everybody talking about it. Well haven't they been trying stuff like this I mean

34:15.820 --> 34:21.100
like, well, you've got PAX, for example, which is kind of like an E3, you know, in a sense.

34:21.100 --> 34:24.900
You've also got, you know, that show that was in San Francisco, I think, that they had

34:24.900 --> 34:28.100
some stuff there. Just, like, a lot of small...

34:28.100 --> 34:32.780
There's the New York City thing they have, the October one that some of our listeners

34:32.780 --> 34:35.540
trying to get us to go to. I can't remember the name of it now. They had the big DDR tourney.

34:35.540 --> 34:36.540
Visual Life, something like that.

34:36.540 --> 34:41.780
Yeah, something like that. And then I heard of another one in Pennsylvania somewhere that's

34:41.780 --> 34:44.580
a big show, and, you know, there's...

34:44.580 --> 34:51.360
Why not just do what, well, I don't know about this, but like, you know, why don't they just

34:51.360 --> 34:53.160
do the mall tours again, you know?

34:53.160 --> 34:54.160
Just like...

34:54.160 --> 34:55.160
The mall tours?

34:55.160 --> 34:59.560
It's like, get into a mall and show off your new game, get, you know, go right to where

34:59.560 --> 35:00.560
the consumer is.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.560
I don't know.

35:01.560 --> 35:06.040
It's gonna be very interesting to see what happens as time goes on with the whole...

35:06.040 --> 35:09.080
Do you think there's gonna be a show that's trying to take the E3 crown?

35:09.080 --> 35:12.720
No, I think that, well, I think what's gonna happen is E3 will still be around next year,

35:12.720 --> 35:14.320
I think it's just gonna be a lot smaller

35:14.320 --> 35:18.960
and more retard is who gets invited.

35:18.960 --> 35:19.800
It doesn't matter anyways,

35:19.800 --> 35:21.080
it's kinda going that way anyways.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.440
Each year you go there,

35:22.440 --> 35:23.960
like the first time we went there,

35:23.960 --> 35:25.740
we went there as general admission or whatever,

35:25.740 --> 35:27.600
then everything was press only.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.840
And then you go there last year and we're press

35:30.840 --> 35:32.000
and you go there and know,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.220
oh sorry, you're not good enough press

35:34.220 --> 35:37.000
to get into our press little thing here.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.060
So next year you come back with even more credentials,

35:40.060 --> 35:42.020
oh I'm sorry, you're just still not good enough

35:42.020 --> 35:45.520
because these people have been doing it longer than you.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.820
Our chat room is yelling.

35:47.820 --> 35:52.820
The East Coast contingent is yelling, digital life, digital life, October 4th through 6th.

35:52.820 --> 35:56.980
Digital life is where the little guys get their chance and all that, so maybe that's

35:56.980 --> 35:59.440
something that's looking to take the place.

35:59.440 --> 36:04.340
Our good buddy Bobby Blackwell from All Games reminded me of what the deal is in Pennsylvania.

36:04.340 --> 36:09.580
It's in Philadelphia, America's video game expo at VGExpo.com, and apparently All Games

36:09.580 --> 36:11.560
is doing something with that.

36:11.560 --> 36:15.160
So that should be pretty cool, because I don't know what's going to happen now to E3 Outpost

36:15.160 --> 36:17.980
Electric Boogaloo that was supposed to happen in 2007.

36:17.980 --> 36:21.180
I say they do it anyway.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.600
The E3 Funeral.

36:22.600 --> 36:23.600
I'd go.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.600
Bobby, if you go, we'll go.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.600
The E3 Memorial.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.760
The E3 Memorial.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.600
So we have no idea what's going to happen with that, it just depends on what E3 turns

36:30.600 --> 36:31.600
into.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.480
I think that we should save up our money and go to Tokyo Game Show.

36:33.480 --> 36:36.000
That would be pretty rad.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.200
You think that Tokyo Game Show will end up taking the crown on this stuff?

36:39.200 --> 36:42.640
It does in a way, yeah, I mean it does in a way.

36:42.640 --> 36:47.760
Even Tokyo Game Show I think is too big. I personally like these smaller shows

36:47.760 --> 36:52.180
because, like for example, Konami's Gamer Date, you've got to play the games.

36:52.180 --> 36:55.560
There was not lines to play stuff.

36:55.560 --> 36:59.940
It was great, it was small. That's the way it should be. Everybody got to play the

36:59.940 --> 37:01.640
games, they got all the information,

37:01.640 --> 37:05.900
you know, and that's it. None of the bullshit, you know, of, oh, well, sorry, you gotta make a

37:05.900 --> 37:08.460
meeting, you know, in order to see this game that we're showing.

37:08.460 --> 37:14.160
What the hell do you go to convention for to advertise your game and then you don't show your game?

37:14.200 --> 37:18.560
That is the dumbest thing ever. I mean, I didn't understand that at all. It doesn't make any sense

37:18.840 --> 37:21.840
You know like especially with you know

37:21.840 --> 37:26.800
The Nintendo thing that kind of pissed me off a little bit because you go there to hype up your new machine

37:26.800 --> 37:29.920
So what do you you make a line and you hold it behind closed doors?

37:30.480 --> 37:32.200
That's stupid

37:32.200 --> 37:37.360
Yeah, it's dumb. I mean, I don't get what they're trying to do. All right

37:37.360 --> 37:38.360
Right.

37:38.360 --> 37:42.880
Well, we're going to open up our voicemails of the week on this topic.

37:42.880 --> 37:46.640
I know in the show role there's something different listed, but I think with this breaking

37:46.640 --> 37:50.420
news we should shift our voicemail of the week to this topic, and if you want to give

37:50.420 --> 37:54.200
us a call, it's 916-226-9067.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.200
Not right now during the show, if you're listening live, but any time during the week,

37:57.200 --> 38:00.600
give that a call unless you don't pay your phone bill, then you need to have somebody's

38:00.600 --> 38:01.600
permission.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.600
And give us a call.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.600
We want to know your thoughts.

38:03.600 --> 38:08.160
this announcement with e3 especially because there'll be more information on

38:08.160 --> 38:11.760
Monday after we've taped really want to know what your guys thoughts are is e3

38:11.760 --> 38:16.840
gonna be as relevant as it once was is this something that if not where do you

38:16.840 --> 38:21.920
think the must be place is gonna be next year we want to know your thoughts so

38:21.920 --> 38:28.560
leave us a voicemail it's 9 1 6 2 2 6 96 Iowa because you know where I kind of

38:28.560 --> 38:32.520
wanted to go because I knew Nellie wasn't gonna let me go to e3 next year

38:32.520 --> 38:37.480
especially but now she's even more happy that it's canceled or at least you know

38:37.480 --> 38:43.880
possibly canceled comic-con I think comic-con be fun I'll be it would be

38:43.880 --> 38:46.520
interesting to see if comic-con picks up some of this well comic-con had a ton of

38:46.520 --> 38:50.840
games there anyway it's true so and plus they have movie stuff we could speculate

38:50.840 --> 38:55.880
forever but we won't know for real until we get some more information cons talk

38:55.880 --> 39:00.480
about another show that's like way you know too much stuff going on I mean

39:00.480 --> 39:05.640
I mean, there's a lot that doesn't even have to do with comics.

39:05.640 --> 39:10.840
Moving on to another story here, we talked about independent podcasts and independent

39:10.840 --> 39:15.080
developers being hurt by E3, I want to talk about this independent production.

39:15.080 --> 39:20.640
We had some folks from this production on our show a couple months ago, and it's a game

39:20.640 --> 39:23.240
that's being made called the Silver Lining.

39:23.240 --> 39:27.120
Now at one time this was known as King's Quest IX, the Silver Lining, but there was a whole

39:27.120 --> 39:30.420
little bit of back-and-forth with Vivendi, who owns the rights to King Quest.

39:30.420 --> 39:34.900
Well, Vivendi, there was a whole Save the Silver Lining campaign, and they were, you

39:34.900 --> 39:36.420
know, I'd call it a success.

39:36.420 --> 39:40.980
Vivendi is allowing this game to be released, only the title is now simply The Silver Lining.

39:40.980 --> 39:44.820
Well, they had a big press event today, it was like a virtual press event, and they were

39:44.820 --> 39:48.500
nice enough to invite me, because we had them on the show previously, so I checked it out,

39:48.500 --> 39:52.380
and I would call this King's Quest labor of love.

39:52.380 --> 39:57.880
I mean, it is so obvious to me that the folks behind this game just absolutely love these

39:57.880 --> 40:01.660
characters that I'm assuming most of them grew up with, you know, through the various

40:01.660 --> 40:04.060
King's Quest games, and how can you blame them?

40:04.060 --> 40:05.620
The King's Quest characters were awesome.

40:05.620 --> 40:09.600
Even I love, like, King's Quest IV, Rosella, and, you know, Graham and all that, so they

40:09.600 --> 40:13.700
have really just poured their hearts into this fan project, and their big news today

40:13.700 --> 40:17.780
is that they have actually released a playable demo that you can download for free.

40:17.780 --> 40:19.660
You want to check this out?

40:19.660 --> 40:23.800
Here's the other cool part about this, Orange Launch Radio, we're mirroring that demo.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.020
You can download it on our site right now.

40:26.020 --> 40:30.600
Check out www.orangelaunchradio.com, go to the downloads page, and you're going to see

40:30.600 --> 40:35.400
in what you heard on the show recently, you're going to see the Kings Quest, I'm sorry, can't

40:35.400 --> 40:39.720
call that anymore, the Silver Lining demo available to you.

40:39.720 --> 40:42.540
It's about 77 megs, it's free, check it out.

40:42.540 --> 40:48.880
If you like, I mean the art style is very Kings Quest 5, Kings Quest 6-ish.

40:48.880 --> 40:53.380
It's kind of 3D, but it's not unfaithful to the previous games.

40:53.380 --> 40:54.820
It's very cool, check it out.

40:54.820 --> 40:59.860
It's an early build, but it just is a sign of things to come.

40:59.860 --> 41:04.860
And it's not just that, they released, they actually had a guy write an original song

41:04.860 --> 41:08.420
for the game, and they released the song today, and it's pretty good.

41:08.420 --> 41:13.140
I mean, it's amazing, they have voice actors, it's crazy, it's like a big, it's like what

41:13.140 --> 41:18.140
you'd see going into a high dollar production, but it's all happening on an independent scale.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.140
That's awesome.

41:19.140 --> 41:20.140
So check that out.

41:20.140 --> 41:26.580
If you want to visit their website, it's www.tsl-game.com, and thanks to those guys again for inviting

41:26.580 --> 41:28.340
us to the press event today.

41:28.340 --> 41:29.340
That was cool.

41:29.340 --> 41:30.340
Alrighty.

41:30.340 --> 41:31.340
Awesome.

41:31.340 --> 41:37.540
We're kind of, you know, talking about things that have been cancelled and, you know, not

41:37.540 --> 41:38.540
happening.

41:38.540 --> 41:45.660
One thing that was confirmed actually at Microsoft Vision Retail Conference was that the Project

41:45.660 --> 41:52.780
Gotham 360 bundle, the Project Gotham 3, with the 360, you know, being bundled and everything

41:52.780 --> 41:58.180
not happening. Despite what all those other websites out there say, not happening. Confirmed

41:58.180 --> 42:05.540
by Microsoft. Here's my thing though. Not happening in the United States. All these

42:05.540 --> 42:09.140
sites that are listing it, from what I've noticed so far, like Toys R Us I think was

42:09.140 --> 42:15.420
in Canada, and I think the EB1 I saw was in Canada too, maybe happening in Canada. That

42:15.420 --> 42:19.300
That might be something because, you know, maybe the 360 is just not selling as well

42:19.300 --> 42:21.660
as the United States.

42:21.660 --> 42:28.100
So you might see a bundle either being put together by retailers themselves, or maybe,

42:28.100 --> 42:30.540
you know, being done in another country.

42:30.540 --> 42:34.540
So look for that, but it is not happening in the United States, I mean, I don't think

42:34.540 --> 42:39.140
they really have to worry about dropping the price, especially with the Playstation 3 being

42:39.140 --> 42:40.140
so expensive.

42:40.140 --> 42:42.660
They are really not worried about that.

42:42.660 --> 42:46.500
is one of our Canadian listeners in chat and says there is no EB game website for Canada.

42:46.500 --> 42:50.700
Well, whatever. The one site I saw, the one site I saw I assumed it was Canada because

42:50.700 --> 42:55.140
all their prices were wrong. Because they were listing everything as $69.99 retail for

42:55.140 --> 43:01.780
like all the Xbox 360 games and that's way off. So, whatever. It doesn't matter. It might

43:01.780 --> 43:05.380
be happening in another country. That's my only assumption that people are getting this

43:05.380 --> 43:12.380
from someplace, but Microsoft is saying no, so take it as you will.

43:12.800 --> 43:16.280
I do have some things that are coming out. Well that's good, that's refreshing.

43:16.280 --> 43:19.560
But for the UK. Great, so we have more news about games that

43:19.560 --> 43:22.720
aren't coming out in this country. Well, because they probably already have or

43:22.720 --> 43:26.800
will be around the same time. True, so enjoy these UK guys.

43:26.800 --> 43:30.480
So these are the games that will be released first week in August.

43:30.480 --> 43:38.320
First, we have Pox Nora for PC, then we have on the fourth, Monster House for various systems,

43:38.320 --> 43:49.600
Pro Stroke Golf World Tour 2007, and Sing Star Anthems on PlayStation 2.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.560
There's a few things that are announced.

43:51.560 --> 43:54.040
Oh, Sing Star Anthems is the gay one, isn't it?

43:54.040 --> 43:55.040
I think so.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.040
I think that is.

43:56.040 --> 43:57.640
It's one that they're marketing towards the gay audience.

43:57.640 --> 44:00.920
I remember talking about this a few shows ago.

44:00.920 --> 44:01.920
Still not interested.

44:01.920 --> 44:02.920
Sorry.

44:02.920 --> 44:06.720
But our listeners over there should keep their eyes open, though later on in the month there's

44:06.720 --> 44:13.640
going to be Dig Dug Digging Strike, Guilty Gear Dust Strikers, and Star Fox Command.

44:13.640 --> 44:14.640
Alright.

44:14.640 --> 44:15.640
Very cool.

44:15.640 --> 44:16.640
Good stuff.

44:16.640 --> 44:20.080
In the United States, though, we're getting some pretty neat stuff.

44:20.080 --> 44:26.180
First thing's going to be FlatOut 2 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and also, I believe, the PC.

44:26.180 --> 44:30.740
so that should be pretty awesome. Um, I know we're getting Super Monkey Ball Adventure,

44:30.740 --> 44:34.660
so if you're a fan of the Super Monkey Ball games, look for that. How many of those freaking

44:34.660 --> 44:40.380
Monkey Ball games are there now? Too many. Um, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and PSP. Um,

44:40.380 --> 44:45.500
let's see, I believe there was also Barnyard coming out, which is based on the upcoming

44:45.500 --> 44:50.940
animated film, which, yay. Sorry, that just made me think of Barnstorming, and if you're

44:50.940 --> 44:55.220
an old school 2600 player, you gotta know Barnstorming. It was one of the baddest games

44:55.220 --> 45:00.780
They had I mean bad meeting good because this was the 80s after all it's one of the baddest games on the Xbox 360 was barnstorming

45:00.780 --> 45:03.660
That's all okay. Why don't they remake that I?

45:04.580 --> 45:06.140
want barnstorming

45:06.140 --> 45:10.460
2006 on the Xbox 360 move over chickens here I come

45:12.180 --> 45:16.560
That's basically the good stuff. I'm really waiting for in the week after that though. We're

45:18.460 --> 45:21.860
Dead rising is coming out 99 nights is around the corner to write

45:21.860 --> 45:25.660
Yeah, Dead Rising is coming out in 99 nights is the week after that very exciting

45:26.060 --> 45:30.380
So lots of good stuff and then scenes row at the end of August as well as Madden

45:30.380 --> 45:36.860
I was at a I was at a GameStop today finally getting rid of top spin too because I just didn't freaking play it and

45:37.680 --> 45:39.600
picking up prey and

45:39.600 --> 45:44.960
They were taking the pre-orders for you know those games, but they were like, you know

45:44.960 --> 45:51.440
They had the demo or they had the really nice setup there for 99 nights coming soon Dead Rising coming soon all that stuff

45:51.440 --> 45:56.440
So and I checked out the trailer on Xbox 360 for Dead Rising very bloody very fun

45:56.440 --> 46:03.040
Oh, I can't wait parents are gonna be mad. Jack Thompson's gonna have a stroke. It's gonna be great. Oh really? I

46:03.640 --> 46:05.560
Won't tape somebody

46:05.560 --> 46:12.040
Well, I'm hoping I can do though is be able to derail that train that's in Saints Row. That's gonna be awesome

46:12.560 --> 46:15.480
But yeah, that's basically what's coming out. It's gonna be a little slow for a while

46:15.480 --> 46:18.520
But um, give it a couple more weeks, but about the week of August

46:18.520 --> 46:25.520
Probably the third week in August or so, things are going to start picking up and they're just not going to stop until Christmas.

46:25.520 --> 46:27.520
Sweet.

46:27.520 --> 46:29.520
Guess what's not coming out, though?

46:29.520 --> 46:31.520
Aw, sad. What?

46:31.520 --> 46:33.520
The Sopranos on Xbox 360.

46:33.520 --> 46:35.520
It got the big boot.

46:35.520 --> 46:40.520
I have to be honest, I totally forgot. They were making this game, so no loss here.

46:40.520 --> 46:42.520
And I don't watch the show. Well, what happened?

46:42.520 --> 46:43.520
I just think that the reason is funny.

46:43.520 --> 46:48.520
HQ is saying because there's no difference between that and the PlayStation 2 version.

46:48.520 --> 46:49.520
What?!

46:49.520 --> 46:53.360
Okay, that hasn't stopped them from releasing other multiplatform games?

46:53.360 --> 46:54.520
Well then again, they're not EA.

46:54.520 --> 46:58.500
Yeah, that's true, maybe this is a different developer, maybe they just have a different

46:58.500 --> 47:02.380
outlook on this, a more realistic outlook of, maybe we just don't want to upcode the

47:02.380 --> 47:03.680
damn thing and sell it again.

47:03.680 --> 47:04.960
Maybe it's just a waste of our time.

47:04.960 --> 47:10.480
Well, they were saying that after they spoke to their, after a few financial conferences,

47:10.480 --> 47:15.760
basically said, uh, it's discontinued. Um, the PlayStation 2 version is still going to

47:15.760 --> 47:22.700
go through, it should be out around Christmas, um, or Yule, or whatever holiday you worship.

47:22.700 --> 47:25.320
Just in time for the show to be going off the air, from what I understand, because I

47:25.320 --> 47:29.780
think their last season's coming up, so, or early 2007 or something, so.

47:29.780 --> 47:35.940
Well the game is supposed to be sort of a GTA style, as in you go out and do jobs. I

47:35.940 --> 47:38.640
didn't watch the surprise. Sorry, I have to roll my eyes a little bit

47:38.640 --> 47:41.580
at that it kind of seems like all these mob things are caught in between like

47:41.580 --> 47:46.300
Scarface, they're all copying the... Hey, don't talk bad about Scarface. I'm not, I'm not.

47:46.300 --> 47:50.640
The movie's a legacy, but I'm just saying it's kinda like I can't, I hope

47:50.640 --> 47:52.800
when they say GTA-like

47:52.800 --> 47:57.000
it means inspired by but very different.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.600
Well, they're all kinda down in that sandbox games is what it, it's basically

48:01.600 --> 48:03.640
like a genre now. Well, that's okay.

48:03.640 --> 48:06.100
Well, speaking of Scarface,

48:06.100 --> 48:08.820
Apparently the Xbox 360 version's been cancelled.

48:08.820 --> 48:12.440
To be honest, I didn't realize there was an Xbox 360 version coming out

48:12.440 --> 48:17.860
because this thing was announced, what, back in E3 2005 for the 360?

48:17.860 --> 48:19.540
And I didn't even realize that they had

48:19.540 --> 48:23.940
decided to continue doing that because it's always been PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PSP.

48:23.940 --> 48:27.220
Which is not a surprise. Eddie in our chatroom says Scarface was never officially announced for

48:27.220 --> 48:31.600
360. Exactly. That's what I was kind of surprised. I was like, I don't remember that.

48:31.600 --> 48:34.420
But apparently people have been writing the news stories that it's not, I guess.

48:34.420 --> 48:38.700
before it must be true. I guess, if the press is saying it. If they're not liars in the

48:38.700 --> 48:45.700
corporate media. Or drunks. Anyway, after all, Final Fantasy 13 looks very much like

48:45.700 --> 48:53.420
7. Anyways, the 360 Scarface not coming out, the PSP Scarface though is coming out, and

48:53.420 --> 48:56.780
to be honest Scarface looks very similar, I mean I guess it's very similar to Vice City

48:56.780 --> 49:01.620
because Vice City ripped off Scarface, so it should be a pretty awesome game, the voice

49:01.620 --> 49:07.440
talent and it's amazing and just it looks very fun so check that out it's

49:07.440 --> 49:14.800
coming out in September all right any other 360 news while we're at it I can

49:14.800 --> 49:24.000
do a 360 all right no actually there is you could do a 360 I don't yeah I don't

49:24.000 --> 49:30.420
don't really know how to read it or a graphic I don't know as in I can turn

49:30.420 --> 49:37.940
around in 360 degrees geez guys I can do a 60 you know what I'm not gonna finish

49:37.940 --> 49:45.480
it pop you know what we don't need to do that yeah so 360 my Xbox 360 dark I have

49:45.480 --> 49:50.400
nothing else about the 360 but I do have something about PSP okay Scarface is

49:50.400 --> 50:00.780
coming out on PSP really we get more mob fun so yes Scarface the world is yours

50:00.780 --> 50:08.640
is not coming out on the Xbox 360 it is coming out on PSP hmm all right anyway

50:08.640 --> 50:13.280
that's sort of a stripped-down version what about this game dawn of war there

50:13.280 --> 50:18.420
was more no has different name to it's called power of money respect it's a

50:18.420 --> 50:23.940
turn-based strategy. Anyways, there's this Warhammer 4000 game coming out on the

50:23.940 --> 50:28.820
360 as well called Dawn of War, which to be honest, I remember playing Warhammer 4000,

50:28.820 --> 50:33.540
actually Space Marines, because I used to have the actual miniatures and stuff,

50:33.540 --> 50:39.660
which is pretty cool, but the Warhammer 4000 game, the series has been around

50:39.660 --> 50:43.740
for a long time, especially in tabletop and PC games now. We'll actually be getting

50:43.740 --> 50:47.460
a 360 version, so it's pretty sweet. They're also planning on making a PS3

50:47.460 --> 50:53.140
version of course whenever that system finally rolls out um so look forward to that pretty soon

50:53.140 --> 50:57.300
it's kind of nice to see them doing it i remember actually uh space marines they used to do a space

50:57.300 --> 51:03.780
marine game on uh the pc and have a really cool intro song but uh yeah space marines kind of

51:03.780 --> 51:08.420
sucked sorry i have to mention the scarface comment in our chat room because it's kind of funny

51:08.420 --> 51:14.740

51:14.740 --> 51:24.060

out that same month though in you know september so there is stuff coming out on the psp but

51:41.580 --> 51:45.580
and NASCAR, if you like NASCAR, whatever. Speaking of things that are not funny,

51:45.580 --> 51:48.860
Gears of War is, apparently there's some

51:48.860 --> 51:53.260
users spamming on Xbox Live,

51:53.260 --> 51:56.840
some Gears of War stuff, and people are thinking, oh wow, it's some crappy viral

51:56.840 --> 51:57.780
campaign.

51:57.780 --> 52:02.380
And, well, we don't really know, but it's, a lot of the messages have been pointing

52:02.380 --> 52:02.940
back

52:02.940 --> 52:07.340
to Gears of War forum, and apparently there's more messages on there, and apparently

52:07.340 --> 52:10.820
some giant announcement is supposed to be happening this week, so... How come I'm not getting

52:10.820 --> 52:14.640
spammed. It kind of makes me feel left out. I'm not getting spammed either. This makes

52:14.640 --> 52:20.180
me kind of sad. Apparently we're just not real press. Apparently not. We're just not

52:20.180 --> 52:24.640
cool enough to be getting spammed. You know what, maybe it's just some dick spamming a

52:24.640 --> 52:30.140
forum. It happens all the damn time. It's the same people spamming on live and it's

52:30.140 --> 52:36.760
basically some stupid little... It's the main character's names and they're Marcus Phoenix

52:36.760 --> 52:42.520
or M Phoenix in this case, he's, you know, we need your help, can't talk now, don't know

52:42.520 --> 52:46.840
who to trust, we'll send more tomorrow, and just, you know, kind of messages like this

52:46.840 --> 52:49.720
very cryptic, retarded messages.

52:49.720 --> 52:52.720
Yeah, but Gears of War still looks cool, so I forgive it.

52:52.720 --> 52:53.720
Here's my question to you.

52:53.720 --> 52:54.720
That game was pretty hot.

52:54.720 --> 52:56.560
Do you really need a viral campaign?

52:56.560 --> 52:58.720
I mean, people think the game's awesome anyway.

52:58.720 --> 52:59.720
Yeah, that's true.

52:59.720 --> 53:04.880
That's like, oh, let's hype up Halo 3 because people don't know about Halo 3.

53:04.880 --> 53:05.880
Come on.

53:05.880 --> 53:10.560
stupid but whatever you know at least hey at least it's not saying this is

53:10.560 --> 53:13.840
Marcus Fenix and I want you to check out my new burnout revenge clip that I have

53:13.840 --> 53:21.920
online be sure to recommend it by the way bike years war coming on November

53:21.920 --> 53:25.640
well November so far because we're not sure to make they might push it up

53:25.640 --> 53:31.160
according to some of the rumors out there all right well now every week on

53:31.160 --> 53:35.400
this program we like to let dark soccer speaking of Gears of War we like to let

53:35.400 --> 53:43.420
DarkSakura start grinding her gears over there and surf the internet up and down and back

53:43.420 --> 53:51.300
and forth and try to find a website that she wants you, yes you, our listener to view promptly

53:51.300 --> 53:54.600
because it's awesome. So DarkSakura, what are the kiddies going to be looking at this

53:54.600 --> 53:55.600
week per your request?

53:55.600 --> 54:05.880
Our listeners are going to be looking at the best page in the universe.

54:05.880 --> 54:06.880
orangetownsradio.com?

54:06.880 --> 54:07.880
It's worth a try.

54:07.880 --> 54:09.200
Okay, second best page in the universe.

54:09.200 --> 54:11.200
Alright, what is this?

54:11.200 --> 54:16.000
The address is maddox, m-a-b-d-o-x dot x mission dot com.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Jesus.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Alright.

54:18.000 --> 54:22.320
I just think that this guy's sense of humor is pretty funny.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.840
He's kind of controversial.

54:23.840 --> 54:24.840
It's controversial.

54:24.840 --> 54:28.840
I mean, even if you don't agree with what he says, at least it's remotely entertaining.

54:28.840 --> 54:29.840
Fair enough.

54:29.840 --> 54:32.840
I meant to get his book, though, but...

54:32.840 --> 54:33.840
The alphabet manliness.

54:33.840 --> 54:34.840
I think...

54:34.840 --> 54:37.840
The whole C is for Chuck Norris, and there's a whole chapter on him.

54:37.840 --> 54:40.840
Let the Chuck Norris joke die.

54:40.840 --> 54:42.840
Step away from the Chuck Norris joke.

54:42.840 --> 54:44.840
He's talking about how bad-ass Chuck Norris is.

54:44.840 --> 54:46.840
I'm talking to you barons, folks.

54:46.840 --> 54:47.840
We can dig it.

54:47.840 --> 54:51.840
But some of the editorials on here are as follows.

54:51.840 --> 54:58.840
I hate Cameron Diaz. Star Wars Episode 3 is a steaming pile of Sith. If these words were

54:59.240 --> 55:04.640
people I would embrace their genocide. I just wanted a video game, not an eternal damnation

55:04.640 --> 55:11.400
in hell. I am a genius. Oh, that was me playing Pink Pals. I am a genius, you are not. The

55:11.400 --> 55:16.760
Eleven War Songs of 2004, which by the way, they're all YouTube. Ben Stiller should star

55:16.760 --> 55:24.020
every movie and video games you'll never play which is great that was what kind

55:24.020 --> 55:29.000
of games will we never play you know what I have to pull that up give me a

55:29.000 --> 55:33.020
second how about that backwards compatible Barbie game on the Xbox

55:33.020 --> 55:36.940
that's one game I won't play how about just the really manly suicide of ramming

55:36.940 --> 55:40.380
your head against the pavement you know a game I will play though that looks a

55:40.380 --> 55:48.540
lot like Barbie. Dead or Alive Xtreme 2. That trailer is minutes of entertainment. I can't

55:48.540 --> 55:50.100
say hours, because the trailer is only a few minutes.

55:50.100 --> 55:51.100
Rob, even I wouldn't play that.

55:51.100 --> 55:58.220
He also puts up his hate mail, too. And apparently writes whole articles based on hate mail.

55:58.220 --> 55:59.660
And he did one about Ikaruga.

55:59.660 --> 56:02.900
Yeah, but then people will write hate mail just to be in the hate mail page.

56:02.900 --> 56:06.300
Of course. And apparently he's also banned in several countries.

56:06.300 --> 56:07.300
Wonderful.

56:07.300 --> 56:08.740
His website is not accessible from the...

56:08.740 --> 56:10.740
I love what he wrote about Ikaruga though.

56:10.740 --> 56:14.340
If you suck at video games, don't bother reading this review because this game is hard

56:14.340 --> 56:17.860
and I don't want whining retards who can't pass the first level bitching to me about

56:17.860 --> 56:18.860
it.

56:18.860 --> 56:23.020
When I say this game is hard, I mean hard light nipples on a plymoth pin.

56:23.020 --> 56:24.580
Oh my god, I can't say that.

56:24.580 --> 56:28.260
Okay, way to go Dark Sakura, trying to earn this show an explicit tag.

56:28.260 --> 56:30.260
I didn't say it.

56:30.260 --> 56:36.260
Visit for yourself to read what was too hot for Dark Sakura to say on air.

56:36.260 --> 56:42.180
moving right along them. Speaking of hard, Final Fantasy XI's achievements are fucking

56:42.180 --> 56:49.340
impossible is what they are. But anyways, yeah, so, so far a lot of the achievements,

56:49.340 --> 56:55.060
all 32 of them, you know, are fucking impossible, including most of which are level up your

56:55.060 --> 57:00.580
character to 75, you know, excellent, you know, or just finish all the Promethea missions,

57:00.580 --> 57:06.020
finish all the, you know, whatever. 30 shitty points for getting my bard to 75. Do you know

57:06.020 --> 57:13.020
how long that'll take. You know what though, aren't achievement points are the easiest

57:13.460 --> 57:18.160
character to fucking level. Hold on though. I can attest that they are not easy to level

57:18.160 --> 57:24.420
as I was a bard. Aren't achievement points supposed to be hard to get? I mean, they're

57:24.420 --> 57:27.700
badges of honor, right? Let me put it this way. Cause people bitch when they're too easy

57:27.700 --> 57:31.180
like we just bitched earlier. Galaga's achievements are too easy. That's fine, that's fine. But

57:31.180 --> 57:35.820
But if they're going to be hard, make them worth something like, you know, 100 points

57:35.820 --> 57:38.220
or something instead of, you know, 30.

57:38.220 --> 57:42.900
I don't want to play for 50,000 hours and go, ooh, 10 points!

57:42.900 --> 57:43.900
Hell yeah!

57:43.900 --> 57:46.700
They've only got 1,000 to distribute, though.

57:46.700 --> 57:48.500
Because that's the Microsoft laws.

57:48.500 --> 57:51.720
And you know what, they shouldn't have put achievement points anyways, because no one

57:51.720 --> 57:56.020
was expecting them, and then they had to go put them out there, and now they suck.

57:56.020 --> 57:57.020
Way to go.

57:57.020 --> 57:58.420
You're just mad because you'll never get them.

57:58.420 --> 57:59.620
I'm not playing that game.

57:59.620 --> 58:05.620
I cancelled it yesterday, actually. Sorry, but I just wasn't playing it.

58:05.620 --> 58:10.260
After you bought it on 360. Yes. Did you return it? Oh, you can't return that sucker.

58:10.260 --> 58:14.140
No, I can't return it. Someday I might go back.

58:14.140 --> 58:17.200
I quit once before. I'll go back.

58:17.200 --> 58:23.700
But we'll see. God, one hell of an expensive frisbee.

58:23.700 --> 58:26.980
You know, I can't addict.

58:26.980 --> 58:30.620
You know what?

58:30.620 --> 58:34.540
What? I wish this would happen to just about everybody that played it.

58:34.540 --> 58:38.220
Hey, I know some great people that played Final Fantasy 11.

58:38.220 --> 58:42.580
I played it for years and years. Addict! Now you're addicted to another crack.

58:42.580 --> 58:46.100
I have nothing bad to say about it. It was time for me to move on and if

58:46.100 --> 58:48.140
there's ever a sequel, you know I'm going to be playing it.

58:48.140 --> 58:51.940
White mage equal party bitch. Alright, anyway.

58:51.940 --> 58:55.860
However, all those people who are cheating,

58:55.860 --> 59:03.620
uh-uh not anymore if you were basically caught cheating there's actually they've

59:03.620 --> 59:08.460
actually banned another 2,000 accounts for the use of third-party software

59:08.460 --> 59:13.860
tools I think they just don't want to be one up to buy World of Warcraft

59:13.860 --> 59:16.740
because World of Warcraft put out that press release I remember was this week

59:16.740 --> 59:21.260
or last week saying they banned like 30,000 people from the game or something

59:21.260 --> 59:24.720
like that and Squeenix is like well we can't let them have the last laugh let's

59:24.720 --> 59:30.600
ban some people too they're just good just because we can this is this is you

59:30.600 --> 59:37.800
know Final Fantasy 11 honestly you need every so the window er it needs the

59:37.800 --> 59:41.980
window er yes but that's a third-party utility and technically that didn't they

59:41.980 --> 59:46.600
ban anyone who's using the window er can't you know is probably included in

59:46.600 --> 59:51.000
the ban and I think they're that stupid because why should they monopolize your

59:51.000 --> 59:55.980
resources you know that's why I love World of Warcraft you know at first I

59:55.980 --> 01:00:00.380
was like eh but you can play it windowed you can change you can do other things

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.780
while you're playing when I was playing Final Fantasy 11 I had my laptop set up

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:07.940
beside me so that I could freakin browse the internet while I was playing a game

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:11.060
I still have my laptop for World of Warcraft because I have thought bought

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.820
up on it because I just can't I can't you know and maybe after years and years

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.500
of Final Fantasy 11 I can't play a game in a window like that I played Ragnarok

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:22.100
online for a very long time and also with that with Ragnarok you can't click outside

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:29.660
of it you have to just you have to shift you have to alt-tab remember kids alt-tab lets

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:34.620
you switch between your programs on a PC so which MMO do you think is going to ban people

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:41.320
next city villains toontown matrix all right well it's been a little while since we've

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:45.360
had an interview on the program and tonight we're proud to welcome Nick Murray of Artistry

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.780
entertainment to the program.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.140
Now, if you've been listening the past couple weeks of show, you'll know that some of us

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:55.300
here in studio have been giving the Xbox 360 version of Prey a little bit of play lately.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:59.140
Part of what makes Prey such a memorable gaming experience is the use of integrated cinematics

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.440
into the game engine.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.780
You can't have a great cinematic, though, without a great soundtrack.

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:07.020
Through the website DirectSong.com, you can purchase two different soundtracks to the

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:12.240
game Prey, as well as the compilation CD, Byte Meme, Music Inspired by Prey, which features

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.480
There's bands such as MXPX, Real Big Fish, and the After Midnight Project.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.840
Nick not only produced this album, but contributed two tracks, and he's here with us to talk

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.360
about this wide selection of music from the games.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:23.360
Nick, are you there?

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.360
Yep.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.360
Hi, Scott.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.360
How are you?

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.360
Hey, I'm really good.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.360
Thanks so much for being on our program tonight.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360
I appreciate it.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.360
Yeah, my pleasure.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.360
Thanks for having me.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.360
Awesome.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.440
So now, for those folks that haven't played the game Prey, what do you think they're missing

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.440
out on?

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:42.280
Well, youíre definitely missing out on a lot of aliens, Indians, and everything in

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.280
between.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:50.000
Itís a great storyline intertwined with shooting and endless hours of fun, basically.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.240
Tell us a little bit about the three separate Prey soundtracks available on DirectSong.com.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:00.920
DirectSong.com, first of all, is a website thatís been around for almost a year now

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:05.860
It features video game music exclusively.

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:11.380
So when Prey came out, we really wanted to showcase the two volumes of the soundtrack

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:12.380
for Prey.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:16.800
It's over three hours of music for the video game, and it's all done by Jeremy and Julian

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:23.140
Soule, who are British Academy Award-winning video game composers.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:28.540
They added their orchestral skills to the game soundtrack, which intertwined very nicely

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:29.540
with the video game.

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:34.580
So those are both available for download on directsong.com, and all you have to do is

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:41.780
log in and enter your information and stuff like that, and then you get the soundtrack

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:45.420
in actually industry-leading audio quality.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:50.880
It's twice as good as iTunes and better than most of any of those other sites out there.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:57.780
So it's going at a rate of 320 kilobits, so it's almost CD quality.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:02.780
pretty much be undiscernable to any normal set of ears.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:07.020
Awesome. Now I know there's a third soundtrack available on the site as well, this Bite Me

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.180
compilation. It's a compilation of music inspired by Prey, right?

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:17.020
Yeah, this is a really fun project that we just put out, and basically what that is,

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:22.780
is some of the music is from the video game, including the song that's in the end credits

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:27.740
to the game by After Midnight Project called Take Me Home, and then we also have original

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:34.380
music from MXPX, Real Big Fish, and lots of other artists. I think there's 13 artists

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:39.600
involved total. This is a new thing for video games, to have bands come together and write

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:45.980
music specifically for a video game. So this is kind of an industry first as well, where

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:50.640
we really wanted to get bands of different genres, so it appeals to all different kinds

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.640
We've got punk rock, we've got mainstream rock, we've got electronica, yet all the songs

01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:01.560
directly relate to Prey, whether it be through the musical instruments involved or the samples

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:08.360
used or the lyrics and the themes invoked in the lyrics and stuff like that.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.600
What is it, do you think, about the game Prey that inspires all these artists to create

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:18.680
these diverse kinds of music that all come back to being inspired by Prey?

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:24.360
I think one of the things that inspired everyone throughout this process is the incredible

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.560
graphics and the storyline that's portrayed through that.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:33.400
A lot of these people got to see some video clips and some of the trailers that came out

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:41.240
before as well as we sent everyone an email that had the full storyline of Prey.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:45.080
Everyone saw quickly that this wasn't just a first person shooter with no story behind

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.080
it.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.400
big part in most of the songs.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:54.840
You yourself contributed two tracks to this compilation, the tracks, Existence and Intervention.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.680
How did your experience with Prey inspire these tracks that you yourself contributed?

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:07.720
Since I've been involved with Prey for about six months or so producing this album, it's

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:15.160
been a part of my everyday work, so I've been thinking about it and looking at videos and

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:19.560
really been intertwined with it for a long time, so being inspired by it wasn't that

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.560
much of a problem.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.080
I really wanted to combine the themes of the game and the music.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.760
So in the game, you've got Tommy, the Native American, gets abducted by aliens.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.720
I really wanted to portray it through the music, kind of the same feeling, starting

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:37.920
off with Native American themes and then have it be pretty much abducted by aliens and come

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:43.880
across with more techno or industrial type sounds and stuff like that and work that all

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.880
together.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.780
Now I remember actually playing through the Prey demo and then later on the game

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.380
and I kind of remember the music was a really big part

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:55.400
of setting the atmosphere in the game so definitely you know music lends itself

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:59.080
very well to Prey and is an important part of setting the mood in the game.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:03.120
Exactly. Well we'd like to give our listeners... Oh, I'm sorry?

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.860
Nothing, I was just going to say that

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:09.700
Jeremy and Julian Stoll did a great job in my opinion of intertwining the music with

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:13.220
the game. Sometimes you don't even notice there's music going because you're just so

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:18.280
emotionally involved, and that takes a lot of skill from a composer to do that in a video

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.280
game.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.280
Definitely, absolutely.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.160
Well, we'd like to give our listeners a taste of what's on this soundtrack, if you

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.160
don't mind.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:29.300
So we're going to play track 10 from the Bite Me music, inspired by Prey compilation,

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:36.280
The opinions rendered herein are those of the guests, and not necessarily those of Douglas

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:42.280
And we're going to start the night by opening up the lines, and I can already tell you folks it's going to get very interesting.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:47.280
I'm getting some reports of strange lights in the sky from the Oklahoma area.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:54.280
Our affiliate in Oklahoma City is telling us that the state police, get this, are reporting mysterious lights all over the area.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.280
And that they're having a hard time responding to all of the calls.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.280
It's going to be a wild and woolly night, folks. I just know it.

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.280
Let's go to the phones.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.280
Caller, you're on the air with Art Bennett.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.280
Yeah, art. That's art.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.280
Yes, it's art. Yes, it's art, caller.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.280
Yeah, this is George from Garland.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.280
You won't believe what's going on around here.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.280
There's lights all over the sky. I can't believe it.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.280
There's lights, you mean, in the sky right now?

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.280
Yeah, right now. It's amazing.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.280
Where?

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.280
Everywhere. Right over my house.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.280
They're moving from north to south.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.280
Can you tell me what they look like?

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.280
Exactly what they look like. Can you tell me about it?

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:39.280
There's our board of wing roll, neutral side, the three board, the board float, and the bridge.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.280
Oh my god!

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.280
Wouldn't want a boarder that was so kind of a spaceship.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.280
It's coming right over the end of the sea.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.280
It's beautiful!

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.280
The fellows out there in Texas giving a call, let us know what's going on in the sky, so that I can...

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.280
I'll take the next call. You're on the air with our tail.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.280
Yes?

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.280
Our tail?

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.280
That would be a good idea.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.280
Oh, no, no, I'm not too bad.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.280
I don't believe you.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.280
Boo.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.280
Yes, you are.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.280
Come on, come on, come on!

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.280
Strange things are happening tonight, both of you.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.280
You've made someone disappear.

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:51.280
Okay Paul, you're still one of my spare clients, so expect that I could get you one of my non-weds excreting things from any other giant company.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:11:20.780
I'm telling you, in research and awkward load of American legends, I've found several mentions

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:25.780
of creatures returning to Earth from a grappling point of view.

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:29.380
Alright, now that was Intervention by Nick Murray here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:31.940
Nick is joining us tonight to talk about the soundtrack.

01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:39.300
So Nick, Art Bell is in that song, and I remember hearing that same sample when I played through

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.300
Prey.

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.020
This guy is a legend in UFO culture.

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:43.460
How did you get him on board?

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:50.500
Well, he was actually signed on by Human Head to do some voiceovers for the game, and Human

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:56.340
Head Studios was nice enough to give all of the artists involved in the soundtrack a sound

01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:03.640
tree and sound clips from the game ranging from aliens vomiting to gunshot sounds to

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:08.260
these voice-over samples and stuff like that, so it was really fun to try to remix that

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.260
into the music.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:13.140
Now, for folks that really enjoyed that song, obviously they could pick up the Bite Me music

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:16.040
inspired by Prey soundtrack, but what about your own other music?

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.060
Do you have another site where you have your own music or...?

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:28.540
Yeah, definitely. You can just go to nickmurraymusic.com and that has my updated blog and streaming

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:30.420
mp3s for all my songs.

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:34.280
Awesome. Now, talking about one of the other bands on the CD really quick, the After Midnight

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.300
Project, of course, has the credit song from the game Take Me Home. There's actually a

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:44.460
whole music video that you can see on the website about this. I was on G4 and some of

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:48.980
the other TV stations. How did that happen? How did you guys think, oh, let's do a music

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:52.420
video out of this?

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:56.220
First of all, working with After Midnight Project has been really great throughout the

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.220
whole process.

01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:04.400
They've been really nice to us, really involved in stuff like that, really good with promotion.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:07.740
One of the guys that works with us and actually works with the video game company, who's one

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:12.140
of our main connections, named Jaron Moore, he has a film background and really wants

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:15.540
to get into film directing.

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:17.580
He managed that whole project, the whole music video.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:22.260
He went out to L.A. and filmed the band and actually did all the editing and splicing

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:26.620
and the game footage and all of that, so it was a really good effort by Jern and it turned

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:27.620
out really well.

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:28.620
Awesome.

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.100
Well, congratulations on that.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.980
I know this has been getting airplay I read about on the site, so that's great.

01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:39.500
Now, talking about the website as a whole, directsong.com, I noticed that Prey isn't

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.900
really the only thing available there.

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:44.940
There's several game soundtracks like Oblivion, Dungeon Siege 2.

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:50.460
What do you think are the advantages of digital distribution for music?

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:58.580
One thing is that games are digital, so weíre staying within the same realms as what gamers

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.580
are used to.

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:08.020
Second of all, what we hope to do is give the users more game music expansion.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:13.980
Right now, you can download expansion packs for Guild Wars on our website, one of the

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:16.660
the first games that we put up on our website,

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.260
and that music is brand new music

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:21.260
that will then work in-game.

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:23.060
So that's a really fun piece of technology

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.780
that we're offering,

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.740
besides just downloading the soundtracks.

01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:28.740
That of course all needs to be digital

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.780
so it can work into the online games.

01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:33.080
I noticed that's a really exciting addition

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.460
I noticed to the site,

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:35.940
is that you can actually download

01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:38.500
these new soundtracks for games,

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.460
and especially when you think about an MMO type of game

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.420
like Guild Wars, where you're hearing the same music

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:49.540
over and over, this seems like somebody should have done this a long time ago. This is great.

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:54.020
Exactly. It's one of those ideas that you say, man, I wish I had thought of that.

01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:57.940
Well, you guys did, so congratulations. Have fun raking in the money there.

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:00.940
Well, we hope so.

01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:05.500
All right. Well, now just kind of out of curiosity, going to the other side of it, because we're

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:11.060
talking about game soundtracks as a whole, some people in the past have complained that

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:16.520
Why is it that you have all these B-movie soundtracks sitting on store shelves yet thereís

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.460
no game soundtracks out there?

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:23.860
Do you think that in the end thereís a market for game soundtracks in a CD-based traditional

01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:28.220
format or is digital distribution where itís at and where things are going?

01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:30.620
Iím not quite sure about that.

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:34.620
Weíve had some producers and distributors come and talk to us about putting these on

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:39.020
actual CDs and putting an online store on our site and that stuff may all be in the

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:41.020
future as well.

01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:45.820
Right now, this is, like I said, this site's only been up for about a year, so that's just

01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:48.260
basically what we've been rolling out first.

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:55.580
In terms of long-term industry, hard for me to say on that one, but I think the gaming

01:15:55.580 --> 01:16:03.060
music is progressing so much as a whole that it will start getting as much clout or as

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:06.440
much respect as movie scores as well.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.580
I definitely agree.

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:10.980
It ought to be getting that same level of respect, and I hope it's coming for you guys

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:11.980
soon.

01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:17.820
Now, one thing I have to ask, because we always ask folks here on Orange Lounge Radio, what

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.140
other games have you been playing?

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:22.640
What kind of video games have you been playing, besides Prey, Prey's Too Easy, what other

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:24.700
kinds of video games have you been playing lately?

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:31.700
Myself, I actually just bought an Xbox 360, because I was waiting for my standard Xbox

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:35.740
to die out, and it finally just crashed way too many times for me to even handle.

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:41.740
I was stuck playing FIFA 06 on my other Xbox, which actually, I've been addicted to that

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.420
game for months now.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:50.180
Personally, I'm more of a sports game guy than a shooter kind of person.

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.180
Alright.

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.180
Awesome.

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:55.020
Do you ever do gaming online?

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:57.020
Do you go online and do any of that stuff?

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.020
I haven't really got into that yet.

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.700
I hope to get into that soon.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.220
I'm kind of waking up to that whole world of online gaming.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.220
Alright.

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:08.720
Anyway, if our folks want to check that out, it's music from prey

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:15.620
There's two soundtracks as well as the bite me music inspired by prey soundtrack. It's available on direct song calm Nick

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:19.680
Thanks so much for joining us tonight on the show. We really appreciate it. Thank you very much

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:21.980
Is there anything else you want to say?

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:25.100
Nope, all right

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:31.700
Sounds good. Thanks so much. Thank you. That's pretty cool. I know definitely the music in prey and

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:35.140
and Elder Scrolls and all that kind of stuff is actually pretty sweet.

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:40.180
Well, anyways, speaking of music, I know Microsoft's been trying

01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:43.860
to very eagerly keep this whole Zune

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:47.660
thing kind of under wraps because of their surprises and how they're gonna

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:49.180
basically take over the whole

01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:52.220
you know, music and portable markets.

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:55.220
Well anyways, Microsoft exec,

01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:59.180
let's see, one of the top ones actually, he

01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:05.180
is basically dismissing the PlayStation 3 and the Wii launches as just pretty much

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:09.900
who cares because we're gonna be, you know, launching with

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:13.100
our brand new Zune and all that stuff and our system is just awesome.

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:17.780
Anyways, it's just kinda interesting, um, reading this. This is actually being run on

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:22.900
MCV Interactive Entertainment Weekly and they were talking about

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.400
how because the PlayStation 3 price

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.600
being so high and how that the Wii is basically not able to compete with them

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:34.800
processor-wise and graphically that

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.040
Microsoft doesn't really have anything to worry about as far as

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.880
winning the next-gen console war

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.480
which I think is a bit, I don't know, that's not a very good way to look at it.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.360
Maybe in this country.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.040
Yeah. But I don't know. I kinda said this a long time ago on the show. It's very

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.280
interesting what this next-gen

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:58.600
War is going to be on a worldwide scale, because Xbox is still struggling in Japan.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.160
Well, and I'm surprised that they don't look at it

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.640
you know with like the success of Live, you know,

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:10.120
it doesn't take great, you know, graphics and stuff to make an awesome game. Look at,

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.040
you know,

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.440
Geometry Wars. Look at the upcoming, you know,

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.400
Castle Crashers or whatever that was. It's simple graphics

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.680
and just fun gameplay. It doesn't need to be all...

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.600
Yeah, seriously, one of the most anticipated titles, Street Fighter II.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.200
Street Fighter II, yeah, perfect example. I mean, it's just all about gameplay.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.680
But, you know, they were comparing the GameCube or the Wii, it's all...

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:36.200
Although Wii is almost a GameCube with a DVD drive, Nintendo...

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.080
Is Nintendo going to have enough quantity

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.360
to satisfy the demand? They're talking about shortages. That's

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:47.360
like the pot calling the kettle black, but whatever.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.600
But basically they said, you know, wait,

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:58.380
They've got a lot of Q4 surprises coming, of course with the Zune and whatever they're

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:04.600
going to be, possibly linking the Zune with the 360 and PC, Vista, etc.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:10.120
So it should be interesting, we'll have to wait and see though.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:14.440
Well there actually is a little bit more about a Nintendo game.

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:15.440
Okay.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:20.840
Well, people by now know that we've had our little bit of excitement over Osutantakayo

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:25.040
and on getting a US release as Elite Beat agents.

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:29.760
Well there's a list released, a partial list I should say, of songs that might be in the

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:30.760
game.

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:31.760
Oh, cool.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.760
Mm-hmm.

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:35.080
There's a stereogram, Walkie Talkie Man.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.920
This is by the way coming from Bimani style.

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:37.920
Okay.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:44.120
Deep Purple, Highway Star, Eve Six, Inside Out, Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida Loca, Savage

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:49.560
garden truly madly deeply hmm okay weird al yankovic hardware store that's that's cool

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:54.680
i love weird al yankovic that's that's hardcore that's awesome lincoln park in the end okay just

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:59.160
lost interest yeah that's that's the song that should be playing while you're playing like uh

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.600
that's okay that's for the myspace kids that's fine what else

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:11.800
no i was actually gonna say while you're playing r-type okay um offspring hit that uh queens of

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.240
of the Stone Age go with the flow Kylie Minogue locomotion why can't they pick

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:20.600
any of her new stuff interesting Guns N' Roses sweet child of mine I can dig

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:27.960
that and Barenaked Ladies one week yeah spirits near in our chat room says lol

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:33.760
emo tendo well there's also some new features that are gonna be in it there's

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:38.280
a single card multiplayer now oh cool but there will still be multi-card

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:43.560
multiplayer. You can also send the equivalent of the E3 demo which is walkie talkie man

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:49.640
highway star and tutorial mode from the Japanese game by download play. Oh well that's kind of cool.

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:54.840
There's two new scenarios. There's a young man trying to win the heart of his dream girl

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.880
and a construction worker who's behind on a project and has one hour to

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:04.040
finish it. The hardware store sounds like the song. Yeah sounds like yeah interesting. Well

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.960
we'll see more I think was most it I'm sorry

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:10.680
this gives me more incentive to import I was gonna say what's most interesting

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:14.320
about that song list is it kinda really makes the Japanese one stand out like

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.320
these are really two different games

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.120
and for those who don't know what this game is essentially it's a rhythm game

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:24.320
but you use tapping you tap in rhythm on the DS I know that sounds kinda hokey

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.280
you also trace the line but you do like tracing it's

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.480
yeah a lot like um what's that game with the spinny thing

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.420
Um, Technic Beat? Technic Beat. Yeah. A little bit, yeah. Technic Beat.

01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:38.860
Yeah, that's a fair assessment. So, but it's

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:43.940
Technic Beat kind of got old after a couple days. This one is funny, like the art style

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:46.980
and everything really keeps you into it. So I hope it doesn't lose that flair.

01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:52.380
I hope they don't Americanize it too much. I just miss the... WENDON!

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:56.540
Well anyways, speaking of music,

01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:00.860
Luminous 2 is actually getting another song called Heavenly Star.

01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:04.780
and Tetsuya Mizuguchi and his team actually

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:09.420
created the song. It's supposedly insanely catchy

01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:13.260
you know and also I'm gonna have a really awesome video to go

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:19.180
with background which features an alien singer. I thought that was Hollaback Girl

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:22.900
no I'm sorry. Incredibly catchy song with alien singer?

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:29.960
A simply stunning video I don't think Hollaback Girl would follow on that

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:37.680
But he says he was inspired by Take On Me with the video, so expecting Take On Me kind

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:40.440
of video, which is kind of neat.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:45.160
Speaking of the game itself, they're saying it's going to have 100 new icons, which, big

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.920
deal, and basically be the same damn gameplay.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:55.400
Additional 3D backgrounds and some videos, as well as puzzles and skin play, edit feature.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.760
Hmm, kind of neat.

01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:03.400
If there at any point is a reference to Luminous 2 going, this game is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S,

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:12.240
I will have a video on YouTube of me smashing my PSP.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.680
Something else that sometimes makes me want to smash something is MySpace.

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:21.040
By the way, join the Orange Lounge Radio MySpace, it's MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio,

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:25.780
and Kotaku ran a very interesting observation earlier this week on their site, capturing

01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:31.420
a very interesting MySpace ad, and you guys can maybe see that ad here in studio a little

01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.420
bit.

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:37.020
It's got, I guess, I don't know if that's a guy or a girl or something, whispering to

01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:41.020
a, you know, a hot chick, quote-unquote, and then there's another hot chick sitting there,

01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:46.020
so it's like, you know, everybody's dream of two chicks, I suppose, not my dream, whatever.

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.020
I think those are two chicks about to make out.

01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:49.020
Is it?

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:50.020
Okay, well, whatever.

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:55.420
Well, the text on there says, Horny Gamer Girls Looking For Fun, and I'm wondering,

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:58.920
Is this like targeted advertising by Myspace?

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.900
Because I know whenever, you know, it's no real secret on this program, I'm gay, and

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:07.240
whenever I log on to Myspace, that's all I ever get are gay personal sites.

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:11.580
Like how many freaking times I could see these ad banners is incredible.

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:14.800
Sadly, I will probably never see this one.

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.960
Maybe I'll get a horny gamer guys, but I somehow doubt that, doesn't seem to be the...

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.520
Is this an incentive for me to unblock ads?

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.520
You know what?

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.240
Myspace has some pretty funny ads, actually.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:32.240
I remember there was one for some movie and it said the movie was just like Napoleon Dynamite

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:40.240
except they spelled Dynamite like DINOMITE like old school good times.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:45.240
It was spelled completely wrong and it was all over the site.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:53.240
I don't really know why we brought this up but I suppose gamers are being targeted in advertising on MySpace

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:58.080
So keep an eye out for the ad just don't click on it because then that shows you support this and there'll be more

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.360
And I said you want there to be more. I don't know I support hot, you know

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.080
Gamer girls making out with each other. I support that fully gets my endorsement. But anyways

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:17.080
Pig the other thing I support fully is violence in much violence now this this I can I

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:22.080
I think all of OLR can agree on this one. Violence in games is wonderful.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.080
Violence is fantastic.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:35.080
But anyways, in Iowa State researchers have found violent gaming sessions can reduce the psychological response or physiological response of real life violence in the short term.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:42.080
term. But, I question this still. Anyways, going this further, they basically had a,

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:49.920
you know, 257 college students and they were made to play, you know, certain games. And

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:56.920
they were following like, with real life violence 20 minutes later. So they were showing them

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.400
and seeing what their reactions were. The games they made them play though, well these

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:06.380
are just a bit old I don't think it's a very good representation of games

01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:14.280
nowadays Carmageddon Duke Nukem 3d Mortal Kombat future cop which were on

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:19.560
the violent side and I've never heard of these games glider pro 3d pinball 3d

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:25.640
munch man and tetra mattes on the non-violent side I'm reminded somehow

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.080
of that scene from a clockwork orange you remember that scene where they're

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:34.240
forcing him to watch all the movies you know I for some reason this whole story

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.360
reminds me of that because it's like they're shoving all these violent games

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:43.320
down someone's throat but it's gonna you know they're gonna get used to they're

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.880
gonna be numb to the imagery after a while but I I think it's not matter of

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:54.000
violent games I think it's a matter of boring games and non boring games I mean

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.400
say for example Carmageddon okay I'm sure that's much more exciting than 3d

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.760
Munch Man or Glider Pro, a game which sounds like it's probably on a hang

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:08.080
glider you're just flying around doing nothing. I'm sorry those games are boring

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:12.320
you know whereas you know if I'm bored to death and all of a sudden someone shows me

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:17.000
a shot of someone being shot point-blank I'm all whoa you know whereas you know

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
if I'm kind of awake I might go wow that's kind of neat. But you know I'm not going to be just like

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.240
oh my god that's really offensive because I've been playing Munch Man

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.620
instead of, you know, oh my god, I destroyed, you know, giant mutant pigs.

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:33.120
That does not offend me in any way.

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.120
I don't know.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120
I think it's kind of retarded.

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.320
Wasn't Munch Man the name of the little guy on Square One TV?

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.960
Math Man, never mind.

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.240
Munch Man, I believe, is a knock-off of probably Pac-Man.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.200
Here's my thought.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:53.280
What if they did this exact same study, but instead replaced it with the nightly news,

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:59.520
Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, any zombie B-movie flick from the 70s, I mean, wouldn't it all

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.880
have the same effect?

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:01.880
Yeah.

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:08.000
So this study seems to be kind of, I don't know, like targeted to kind of blame games?

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Like it's skewed.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Yeah.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.120
Like it seems like there needed to be a control here.

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:14.120
I think so.

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:18.240
Are games more desensitizing than the nightly news or than movies?

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.600
That's the study I want to see.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:22.140
Show me a comparison.

01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:25.220
just throw these numbers at me you know what I mean

01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:28.380
that's my problem with it. Darkstalker do you have a thought on this at all?

01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:32.580
As far as the desensitization goes

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:36.820
um there's already a lot of exposure

01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:42.020
honestly I mean it's like you take the child who grows up never able to watch

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.540
the news never able to watch TV never able to play a video game

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:49.420
and how are they when they grow up and see what the real world is like

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:54.320
you know, go pretty nuts. And then you take one who may not have been allowed to play

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:59.000
video games, but they watch the news with their parents, I think they'll be just as

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:04.180
equally desensitized from it as someone who's an avid gamer.

01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:08.420
You know, I've been gaming for a long time now, and I believe you as well have been gaming

01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:12.280
a long time, and Matt, you as well have been gaming a long time, Andrew, also been gaming

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:16.400
a long time. Do you feel that you're desensitized to violence?

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:22.900
I've been desensitized to violence, but not from games. I think it was more from watching violent cartoons, violent anime, violent anything.

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:28.400
It's not necessarily violence, it's just that we see this on TV every day, and you know, watching, you know,

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:35.700
I'd say movies are worse than games, because so what in games you can control the action, big frickin' whoop.

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:41.600
I can control the action on a DVD player too, I can rewind, I can freeze frame, it doesn't matter.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:46.600
The whole thing is, just like with Saw, for example, let's take Saw, that's a perfect example.

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:57.600
You have, you know, a basic movie where someone is kidnapped and they have a giant device on their face with spikes in it that's gonna basically, you know, slam into them and kill them.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.600
Well, and they also show someone sawing off their foot.

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:07.600
I think that's a lot more violent than, say, Duke Nukem 3D, which has pixelated graphics that look like a cartoon.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:12.640
Did anyone throw a fit when you know the Roadrunner, you know got Wile E. Coyote the fall off a cliff

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:19.280
That's hundreds of hundreds of feet that he fell to his death. But oh sure he came back later on guess what?

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:24.620
That's what happens when you shoot the pig it spawns later on so I don't see what the big deal is

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.080
For me, um

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.960
I've been gaming a long time

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:32.800
I've played a lot of violent games and a lot of you know funny violent games

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:39.200
Like I love Mortal Kombat but like real blood like my brain totally knows the difference between game movie and real life

01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:45.240
Because like I could watch somebody cut their cut their hand and they need stitches and I freak out like I'm like, oh my god

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:51.320
It's real blood gross gross, you know, I get all freaked out, you know, I'm totally one of those I get you know

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:56.320
I you drive by a horrific car accident and I'm gonna cry if I see a body, you know, like it's

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:02.140
And even watching the news you see a lot of horrible stuff on the news and I just feel I feel depressed

01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:09.060
You know I my brain knows the difference between the two I can I can feel that you know reaction to real blood

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:12.660
But then I can play a game, and I think it's funny because it's not real because yeah

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.020
You're smart enough to know it's not real

01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:18.620
Well, I like the hell is wrong with people if they don't know what's real and don't know what's not real

01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:24.420
That's the bigger problem not being desensitized to violence being desensitized to what's reality. What's not reality

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:28.540
That's the big problem right there, and I think if people are that retarded well

01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:32.540
Well, they need to be put in some sort of mental hospital because obviously they're

01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:34.620
not fit for society.

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:35.620
True.

01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:38.560
No, no, no.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:45.100
I think that, again, this goes back to parental responsibility.

01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:46.580
It is their job.

01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:54.500
When they brought that life into the world, they had an unwritten contract that they would

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:58.700
make sure that this entity would grow up to be a functional member of society

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:02.560
that if they could not become a functional member of society they would

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:07.760
help them seek the treatment they need and so therapist bull and not using if

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:14.880
there's anything else might be causing the problem but you know I think that a

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:18.120
good parent will pay attention to what their child you know I admit you know

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:21.920
child is gonna be sneaky I was a sneaky kid you know they're not gonna be able

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:27.500
able to be there 24-7, but if a parent takes an active interest in what their children

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:33.580
are doing, participates in their life instead of dictates their life, you know what I mean?

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:39.700
Then, um, we, I don't think there'll be as much of a, they don't have a right to blame

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:46.020
a game when it's their responsibility for making sure that their child turns out how

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:51.180
they feel is right and if they if they think that the game is going to

01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:54.700
desensitize them to violence later and want them to retain a feeling of

01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:59.000
sensitivity they need to limit how much their child's gonna play it I think

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.520
that's the problem with human nature these days people are far more apt to

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.900
blame other things other objects blame the TV blame a video game for what's

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:13.300
really the problem you want your kid is just a maladjusted dick it's a it's a

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:17.620
lack of accountability. I really think it's a lack of self-accountability. You have no

01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:23.840
one to blame for what goes on in your life but yourself and how you act on it.

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:27.180
For example, here's another thing I think that's also the main problem with this study

01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:33.360
is the footage that is shown, the real-life footage, it basically was courtroom outbursts,

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:40.260
police confrontations, shootings, and prison fights. Can you, I'm sorry, cops, the TV,

01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:45.360
stuff is out there all the time in any of your dramas like 24 I mean how many

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:49.740
law and order police you know dramas out there right now this stuff is all over

01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:53.540
the place like and people aren't probably surprised about that because

01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:59.580
it's like yeah I've seen that before you know it's kind of like you know I don't

01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:06.460
know it's it's like a like a like Pamela Anderson naked I've seen that before

01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:11.980
for it's not surprising it's not like wow oh my god I was not expecting her to

01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:16.860
have breasts under there but it's just you know it's not surprising you're not

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:22.020
gonna be and for example if you're like you know playing these boring ass

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:26.180
knockoffs of games by the sound of the generic names that they have 3d munch

01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:30.260
man who you know if you're playing that then all of a sudden they show you no

01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:35.900
you know prison fight I'm like hell yes a lot better than 3d munch man I mean

01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:39.120
so I don't know what the hell they were expecting.

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.940
All right, I gotta let our chat room have a say here

01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:43.740
over at orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat.

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:46.120
Eddie of the OL Army says my mom played Halo

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:49.320
for a few weeks with me when I first got my Xbox.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.360
Oh, that's cute.

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.200
Good for your mom.

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:53.520
Yeah, I know, you know the family that plays together

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:55.840
is closer, I don't know, I don't know.

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:58.820
That sounds almost dirty though, but that's not true.

01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:03.000
GK128 says there is a difference between violence

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.140
in a video game and violence from say a real video

01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:08.100
where a dude is blown to bits from a torrent.

01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:10.500
That's gross, but true.

01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:14.140
Darth Tetsuya says Hello Kitty drove him to violence.

01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:16.460
Hello Kitty drives everyone to violence.

01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:18.580
Funnydale seems to think Munch Man was a knockoff

01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:21.620
of an 80s porn film, actually.

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:24.540
Leave it to him to make the funny.

01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:27.080
All right, any other thoughts on this topic?

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.940
We'd love to get your thoughts in our mailbag.

01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:31.220
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:33.020
If you want to send us some emails,

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:36.060
Jamie's going to be digging into the mail back in our next segment.

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:37.060
I sure will.

01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:38.060
Alright.

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:41.020
I think this time I'm going to need like an extra thick hazmat suit this time.

01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:42.020
Alright.

01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:43.740
Maybe some asbestos gloves.

01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:44.900
Just one last thing.

01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:49.700
If they want to test whether people are desensitized to violence, you know, they don't need to

01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:53.980
show courtroom battles, cops, that kind of thing, like Loki said.

01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:57.780
Show us some pictures of some guy with his head blown off by a shotgun, you know, stuff

01:36:57.780 --> 01:36:59.260
you would see on shock sites.

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:00.260
Yeah.

01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:03.000
that will test your sensitivity to violence.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.960
The courtroom battle made me think of Phoenix Wright, sorry.

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:10.160
Objection! Exactly, people don't need to see that. I've seen pictures of people eating babies.

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.960
I mean that's pretty disturbing, so...

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.380
courtroom, or like

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:19.360
outbursts in a courtroom. I've never seen that in a movie before.

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:25.480
Cops, oh my god, never seen Cops before. I object to where the show is headed so I

01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:27.260
think it's time that we have a break.

01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:30.260
Speaking of violence real quick, though, I need to get this out here.

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:35.260
If you don't listen to the rebroadcast of Orange Lounge Radio over on AllGames.com,

01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:37.260
there will be violence.

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:40.260
Yeah, we'll poke you in the nose and call you a poopy head.

01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:43.260
And, by the way, we're moving times over there.

01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.260
There have been some schedule changes over at AllGames,

01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:47.260
and you East Coasters are going to love this.

01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:51.260
The show is now Mondays at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time,

01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:53.260
which would be 8 o'clock for you East Coasters.

01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:55.260
So if we're making you stay up too late on a Sunday,

01:37:55.260 --> 01:38:01.140
You can always listen to the show in its entirety, parts A and B, over on allgames.com on Monday

01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:02.140
nights.

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:05.500
And that's right after the big live show they do, All Games Interactive, which is taped

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:11.740
live at the Arena Interactive Lounge, home of the E3 Outpost, and I don't know what's

01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:13.220
going to happen with that next year.

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:16.340
We'll see in light of what we've talked about earlier in this segment.

01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:18.500
Alright, so let's go to a break.

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:21.540
We'll be back a little later with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
