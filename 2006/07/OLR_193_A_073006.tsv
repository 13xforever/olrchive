32777	36200	Welcome, everybody, to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

100962	105384	Alright, let's talk about some gaming news tonight.
105704	109965	But first, we always talk about what we've been playing in our gaming week.
110526	111786	Let's start it off with DarkSakura.
111806	113847	What have you been playing during your gaming week?
114307	116268	But loads of stuff.
117568	121990	I played Getting Lost in San Francisco this weekend, but that's...
122526	124506	Is that like Crazy Taxi or what?
124526	125327	No, no, no, no.
125487	135969	I played, we actually went to Santa Cruz this morning to play, actually just to go hang out at the boardwalk for a little while and, you know, have me not die on that little thing that goes across.
136069	136609	Who is we?
136669	137489	Was this the girls?
138029	149092	It was me and Disney Punk 10, Kristen, and her friend from L.A., Marissa, who's now my friend, very cool person, music nerd, like moi.
149474	150435	So it was like a girl thing.
150455	151296	It was a slumber party.
151316	152437	Yeah, it was a big slumber party.
152457	153438	Did you go in your PJs?
153698	154299	Pillow fight?
154579	155980	Did you have a pillow fight?
156200	156380	No.
156781	159403	But we did have some... Ice cream?
159523	160084	Talk about boys?
160204	161345	We actually did eat a lot of ice cream.
161365	162046	We had Dippin' Dots.
162826	162967	But...
167086	170868	I played Star Wars Episode I Pinball, which is Pinball 2000.
171728	172909	I love the Pinball 2000 games.
173389	175009	Revenge from Mars, Pinball 2000.
175069	176190	Those are the hologram ones, right?
176870	177090	Yeah.
177250	177731	Those are cool.
178351	181252	I played The Sopranos Pinball, which is actually pretty decent.
181952	188195	I played the first Star Wars game, Pinball, that's put out by Sega, which is kind of a crappy table.
189395	190056	And I played...
191796	192557	Oh, shoot.
192677	194758	It was another table that was really good.
194778	197180	I just had a brainstorm.
197740	198401	It hurt a little bit.
198901	201763	Why doesn't Sega put out a Sonic pinball table?
202083	203304	They could have a little blue pinball.
203424	204685	They had a Super Mario Bros.
204725	205986	pinball table there that wasn't working.
206026	206727	But that's not Sonic.
207227	210409	No, but I played Lord of the Rings pinball, which is also put up by Stern.
210509	211430	One ball to rule them all?
212994	214595	It's a pretty difficult table, actually.
214615	216315	It was a really good machine, though.
216695	218336	Rob, you are stealing my material.
218536	218976	Shush.
219096	222817	But basically, Stern is the only company still making pins right now, pretty much.
224237	226998	I also, we got a new pinball table.
227578	233500	I woke up Friday morning to see Dan face down on the futon, and in our garage is a Twilight Zone pinball.
234943	235343	DarkSakura.com
255336	256796	Maybe you can autograph it for a listener.
256996	257917	You know what's funny, though?
259337	261858	Dan and I decided that that Twilight Zone was destined to be.
262218	269479	Because if you lift up the playfield to look at it, if you look at the very end of it that's facing toward the coin slots, you'll have two dates on there.
269499	271360	The first date is the date that the board was cut.
271420	274381	The second date is the date the playfield was assembled.
274901	278242	And the date that the board on that Twilight Zone was cut was my birthday.
279262	279502	Oh, wow.
279522	280282	It was April 19th.
280502	280842	Very cool.
280862	282603	I actually played DDR today.
284554	285354	I did not die.
286275	291057	And I played this other, it was a ticket game, but it plays like pop-up music with eggs, and there's only four buttons.
291417	292758	It's called Rhythm and Something.
293298	296340	It was really stupid, the music sucked, but it was like, this is pop-up music.
296440	297200	That sounds kind of cute.
297620	298180	It was cute.
298821	301302	And they had a Tron machine that I didn't play.
302442	306624	Alright, say hello to our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.
306664	311126	Funnydale is actually letting us know that Sonic did have a pinball game somewhere between 93 and 95.
311827	312487	So that's news to me.
312507	312987	That is true.
313287	313928	I had forgotten about it.
314208	314308	Oh.
314798	315299	Pin Mame
327691	328832	Oh, that's true.
328872	329652	I could play it in there.
330532	330932	Let's see.
331132	333433	NintendoManiac64 says, I have a pinball machine.
333533	333954	That's cool.
334394	336775	DJ Dark Knight says, give me the Simpsons pinball.
336975	339996	That was a good table, too, because the bumpers were the big nuclear reactors.
340396	340976	That was awesome.
340996	342277	They had a Funhaus pinball.
342377	345058	I hate that machine because that head thing on there.
346119	350200	It's just... They had a laughing cell at the boardwalk, though.
350840	351661	When we were at...
353924	355905	California Extreme.
357165	361327	Playland used to be an amusement park in New York that they had to destroy.
361347	363948	I guess they sold the property or something.
364628	370011	There are people who made a Playland memorial or museum.
370911	372451	They have games from there and everything.
372632	374812	They have two Laughing Souths.
374852	378594	When I saw the one at Santa Cruz, I was like, oh, I remember that.
379232	379932	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
397717	398918	The J-pop one.
399158	401380	So our music gaming fans would be very happy at this place.
401400	402421	They have a DDR Supernova.
402681	402902	Wow.
403322	404183	And it's a new unit.
404303	407806	I haven't even played the... Well, I mean, I played it at E3 and the Konami Gamers.
407846	410328	I haven't played, like, the final release version of it yet.
410348	417194	I actually didn't play it because when we went to one of the little smaller ones just to play skee-ball, they had an Extreme there, so Chris and I played that.
418835	420196	Probably lots of the DDR-free kits.
420216	421517	He's played Spider Stomp.
421878	423119	I counted three Spider Stomp machines.
423139	424340	Now, that's old-school DDR.
424600	425260	Spider Stomp.
425320	425681	Yeah.
426488	428129	and they have a dock upstairs now.
428869	429910	Very cool.
430650	430991	Alright.
432432	434653	Anyway, Loki, how was your gaming week?
435513	436174	It was pretty good.
437655	442357	I've been playing the hell out of the Saints Row demo.
442818	452003	Actually, it was funny because I thought my magazine, the official Xbox magazine, I thought my subscription ended, but it has now after I got the demo, which is where it counts.
453504	454184	It's really fun.
454304	455165	Saints Row is
455803	457104	Basically Grand Theft Auto.
457224	462106	I mean, they've improved on a few things, and there's a few things that are kind of not as great.
462526	469470	But for the most part, it's very enjoyable, and that demo we play for an entire hour each lunch.
470150	471511	What are the things that are different?
472011	478594	The things that are different, first off, the camera's a lot better with the right analog stick.
479214	482596	For example, if you have pipe bombs and stuff, you can toss stuff behind you.
483036	483657	Thanks for watching!
502297	502978	Rob Storrs
532755	540724	Other than that, I've been playing a little bit of other Xbox stuff like Ridge Racer 6 a little bit.
541145	543307	I haven't really played too much of Chromehounds.
543367	544448	I did finish the...
545365	546226	Thank you for watching!
563079	564599	OrangeLoungeRadio.com OrangeLoungeRadio.com
592745	593706	At least it's not that I read.
594526	597768	And if you didn't read it, then hell, who cares?
598208	599569	If I didn't see it, it's not illegal.
599589	604031	Anyways, so the game itself, it's pretty cool.
604151	608513	I mean, it plays very similar to the Xbox 360 demo that I played.
608894	613136	Of course, graphics are a lot less Xbox 360, but they do the job.
613736	615537	It is an online game, completely.
617618	618759	And you still roll down the window?
618779	618819	No.
619332	621233	That was an impressive feature in the Xbox demo.
621253	621993	Well, here's the thing, though.
622013	624033	A lot of the stuff isn't finished yet because of this beta.
624313	625234	Like, all the interiors.
625274	627854	Like, I went, oh, okay, I'm going to look at the interior of the car and see what it looks like.
628514	629075	Nothing happened.
629095	629995	It was just all glitched out.
630015	631355	I'm like, okay, that doesn't work.
631995	634356	I look to see what my driver looked like.
634636	635276	There's no driver.
635296	636577	It's just the ghost car.
637157	638437	Because they haven't finished that yet.
638597	639477	Because it's still beta.
639817	640718	But it's still fun, though.
640758	644059	And you can drive off-road just as easily as you can with this car.
644759	645079	I don't know.
645619	645719	It's...
646454	651617	The PlayStation 2 version, I probably wouldn't pick it up because I have the 360s, so why bother?
651977	652878	And you know what's weird?
653838	658921	Unless they drop the PlayStation 2 one, I think the 360 one is actually going to be cheaper.
659421	662203	Because it's going to be $39.99, so why not pick it up?
662703	664144	But it's a fun game.
664864	671548	It's pretty cool, and it's definitely easy to get online with, which I haven't played too many online games, but I know there's been some difficulty.
671688	674650	No lag, I haven't noticed any lag in it, but it's pretty fun.
675471	678553	Yeah, HitStun also really loved your review there on the graphics.
679233	681454	The graphics are a lot less Xbox 360.
683335	684675	They're very stripped down.
684815	686396	Very, very, very stripped down.
686436	686636	How so?
686736	687337	What's missing?
687457	688977	Just a lot of detail that's in there.
689838	694180	Definitely textures are, you know... It's just not as detailed as the Xbox 360.
694440	696501	It reminds me of the old test drive games, which...
697442	702367	Last Test Drive I played other than this, which was a long time ago, Test Drive 3 on the PC.
702587	704389	I mean, that's when the cars were blocks.
704689	710054	Yeah, I was going to say, probably the last Test Drive game I played seriously was like Test Drive 2 The Duel.
710274	710755	Was that it?
710995	712656	On Commodore 64.
712836	714418	It was pretty old.
715038	720263	I mean, this was back in the day when Test Drive, you just basically had to get to the end of the map or whatever.
720904	721004	And
721892	722633	And that was a journey.
722813	731703	I mean, I would always try to take the shortcuts through the fields and run over the 2D chicken or whatever and just... I don't know.
731783	732403	It's a good game.
732784	734005	All you have is a PlayStation 2.
734325	735367	It's still going to be very good.
735527	736428	So, you know, check it out.
736708	739491	Or even the PSP one, when that comes out, will be pretty decent.
739631	741433	So, they're worth checking out.
741954	743876	And then I think, of course, more Grand Theft Auto and...
744798	747080	We're getting to a point now with Grand Theft Auto.
747460	755726	Every day we play this game, the more and more frustrated we are at the developers and the more we want to kill them because of how buggy the multiplayer is.
755866	769456	And it's really sad because I wish I had a way to contact the developers at Rockstar because I have so much feedback I can give them on their game, both positive and negative, because I've basically played this game every single day for at least 30 minutes.
770397	771578	So, yeah.
771598	771678	Yeah.
772142	772942	They need to give me a call.
773022	782947	If anyone from Rockstar is listening, contact Loki at orangelongeradio.com L-O-K-I I hope to God, because this is built on the Vice City engine.
782967	791731	You know, Liberty City Stories was, and now that Vice City Stories is coming out, you bet your ass they're not going to do anything to fix any of the multiplayer, because they're fucking stupid.
792632	793552	But I'll still buy the game.
796767	799168	When does the Saints Row demo get released for the rest of us?
799228	800088	I heard Tuesday.
800308	800548	Is it?
800649	801769	April or August 1st.
802169	802429	Sweet.
803089	804350	So, check it out.
805630	805931	I will.
806571	808852	For whatever reason, it's not up that day.
808872	811893	You can always find it at the official Xbox magazine.
812453	812713	Alrighty.
814374	816334	Mr. 23rd Magus, a.k.a.
816435	817575	Andrew, how was your gaming week?
818055	818655	It was alright.
818675	825398	I was looking to make some crazy money, but instead I just sat my ass on the couch, sort of chair, yeah, chair,
826024	827525	and played Tell Your Iris.
828085	833088	You can tell that Nippon Ichi did all the translating because the script is absolutely hilarious.
833408	833949	What is this game?
834909	836290	Tell Your Iris, Eternal Mantle.
836690	836791	Oh.
838892	844275	Just a little dialogue with a cat girl asking the protagonist to sleep in bed with her.
844555	849058	The response is, I can't, the ESRB would go nuts.
852627	857050	Other than that, I haven't been doing much gaming, mostly because of the heat affecting my computer.
857870	862033	I have been trying Fable off and on, and it's the first time I've actually played Fable.
862233	862974	PC or Xbox?
863214	863574	PC.
864895	865296	What do you think?
866477	871660	It's interesting, it's not what it was hyped up to be, obviously, but it's still pretty damn fun.
872161	877224	It's not a completely open world like it was promised, but it is still pretty fun.
877244	880287	It plays more like Knights of the Old Republic, with the whole good and evil thing.
880747	880907	Okay.
882872	883472	My Gaming Week.
883733	885173	I actually played quite a bit as well.
885273	891036	I downloaded the 99 Nights demo because I really liked the game at E3 when I got to play it.
892156	898259	I seem to remember when I actually played the full game at E3, it was a lot easier than the demo because I died like three times in the demo.
898319	899560	I think I was doing something wrong.
900400	901400	The game's really fun.
902021	903181	I liked it a lot.
903321	911905	It's kind of a button masher, but it reminds me of a game like Final Fight or probably more rather something like Golden Axe
912281	913821	But on a much bigger scale.
913861	918843	I mean, in Golden Axe, you cannot kill 50 people in one swoop of the sword and things like that.
918883	924424	And you can't stab somebody on the end of your sword and then use his body to attack other people.
924744	925084	It's fun.
925104	928145	I mean, you're fighting armies, just lots and lots of people.
928265	930065	And the game's pretty intricate.
930125	930925	It looks great.
931345	932386	I really enjoyed the demo.
932406	934666	I definitely want to pick up the full game, even if I suck at it.
935466	938267	I noticed already in the chat room, though, some other folks didn't seem to like the game.
938647	947353	It definitely seems like the type of game you're either going to really like or you're going to really hate maybe because of its simplicity and the fact that it is kind of a bit of a button masher.
947373	948874	I think some people are really going to get turned off by that.
948894	951236	And a lot of people are comparing it to Dynasty Warriors, to be honest.
951276	953378	I think this is actually a lot better than Dynasty Warriors.
953718	958661	It definitely looks a lot better because Dynasty Warriors 5 fucking sucked on the Xbox 360.
959742	960623	They didn't really do anything.
960663	963785	And Samurai Warriors 2, when that comes out, that one's going to suck also because...
964221	967764	Also another just port without any effort is basically what it was.
969086	973330	But it looks, to be honest, this demo looks a lot better than what I remember from E3.
973890	975071	It looks like a lot more fun.
975832	976933	So, I don't know.
977093	981237	And it just seems more fun than Dynasty Warriors was.
982018	982238	All right.
984693	991015	I picked back up Oblivion randomly.
991135	1002639	I had tried playing this game a while back, and I thought it was very pretty, but I think the problem was I had someone hovering over my shoulder telling me what to do, like everything, and I think that might have ruined the gaming experience for me, so I went back and checked it out, and...
1003726	1004346	It's great.
1004827	1006748	I wouldn't be that person, would I?
1006788	1007708	No, it wasn't really you.
1007848	1009689	It was kind of everybody was hovering.
1009709	1013111	Everybody else had played it but me, because a lot of people, and everybody was like, do this, do this, do this.
1013151	1013812	I'm like, shut up!
1015232	1022316	But I had a chance to just sit down and sort of explore it for myself, and it's so... I guess the only word I can use to describe this game is vast.
1023237	1024818	You really can do just whatever you want.
1025178	1028780	It reminds me of a first-person shooter, but with swords.
1028920	1032542	But yet, the world is open, and you can go anywhere you want.
1033240	1045884	But that vastness is kind of like a good thing and a bad thing because that vastness, I'm so used to very linear types of story in games, so it was really hard for me to go, oh, I could just go anywhere I want and do these other quests before doing the main quest.
1046104	1048945	Because I tried to just go, da-da-da-da-da, start doing the main quest.
1049105	1054967	I got murdered ten ways from Sunday, like, so horribly because my character wasn't buffed up enough yet.
1055287	1057668	I hadn't really practiced with spells and all that stuff.
1057708	1061649	My character didn't have enough stuff, so it kind of took me a little while to get used to that, but...
1062871	1072793	It's a great game, and I think it's a way for folks who are in the first-person shooters and that genre game, sort of like a really good entry-level RPGs.
1072853	1075353	Maybe you're the type of person that's like, I hate RPGs.
1075453	1077414	Well, maybe this is more your style.
1077714	1079134	There's different types of RPGs.
1079374	1082435	This is not a Final Fantasy RPG by any means.
1082775	1083915	This is completely different.
1083955	1088676	It actually, it really reminds me of an old PC, which makes sense, I mean, when you consider what the game is.
1088736	1089536	It reminds me of an old
1089807	1091028	Thank you for watching!
1109833	1116796	Although honestly, I just don't know how long I'm going to be able to put up with it before my brain explodes from all that stuff to do and just a million other games I want to play.
1117036	1119677	Because if I get too far into Oblivion, I'm not going to play anything else.
1119757	1121498	Here's the best thing you've got to know about Oblivion.
1121598	1121838	Okay.
1122779	1124039	Oblivion, join the guilds.
1124420	1131243	Because when you join the guilds, you can clear off their entire shelves of everything and go sell it for money.
1131983	1132763	That's the best part.
1133083	1138666	I spent like a couple hours just clearing off everything until I found out about the dupe, you know,
1139113	1140555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1154671	1155251	Sold back.
1155431	1156372	That was great.
1156432	1160473	DJ Kibbles and Bits in our chatroom says, Oblivion is one of those games you have to experience on your own.
1160533	1162514	It's just too damn huge to rush, though.
1162914	1163274	I agree.
1163314	1165795	This is not like a typical gaming experience.
1165915	1168016	It's something you really have to invest a little time in.
1168116	1168316	Andrew?
1168436	1171698	You said you were having problems just getting slaughtered in Oblivion, right?
1171898	1172098	Yeah.
1172338	1172958	Here's the thing.
1173398	1176840	In Oblivion, the way it works is the enemies level up as you do.
1177120	1177700	Oh, great.
1177720	1181081	So if you level up, they're going to level up, and you're still going to get slaughtered.
1181101	1181361	That's right.
1181381	1182362	I thought I remembered reading that somewhere.
1182382	1183222	The trick is to gear up.
1183720	1189043	That's what I need, because I'm still using the crappy gear you get in the beginning, minus what I raided from dead bodies.
1189723	1190804	So yeah, I need to gear up.
1190824	1191384	Yeah, gear up.
1191624	1194005	Because when they hit me, I take massive damage.
1196106	1197087	Here, I thought I was going to say that.
1197287	1198928	Anyway, let's see.
1199788	1209573	I picked up Prey, because I like the demo, but I haven't played past the demo sequence yet, so more to come on Prey next time.
1210472	1211192	Just wait for them to die.
1228006	1230107	Also, real quickly, one other game I want to mention, Cloning Clyde.
1230307	1231888	I picked that up too from Xbox Live Arcade.
1232448	1235449	Definitely reminds me of an old Super Nintendo puzzler with a sense of humor.
1236370	1242132	I keep wanting to say like Krusty's Funhouse type game, except Krusty's Funhouse wasn't that great, but Cloning Clyde's fun.
1242372	1248995	I mean, if you are curious if you're going to like Cloning Clyde or not, seriously, just check out the demo because I think it's got a really good demo.
1249355	1249935	What about Galaga?
1269076	1271236	Galaga I checked out too, thank you for reminding me.
1271797	1273177	Very easy achievement points.
1273557	1275057	Super easy achievement points.
1275297	1281299	I mean, I had a friend on my Xbox Live list who got all 200 achievement points within a couple hours.
1282019	1285039	The thing about Galaga is it lets you continue from the stage where you died.
1285339	1288500	So getting that level 30 achievement or whatever is not a problem.
1288760	1291941	And all the monsters and those achievements, you kind of pick those up along the way.
1291981	1295861	So there's very few that require a lot of real skill.
1297582	1298082	Galaga...
1300876	1309361	It's not really an arcade game that I remember fondly from the 80s, but I know other people do who are probably yelling at me right now for saying that.
1309481	1311943	I mean, it just really depends what type of games you were raised on.
1312223	1313824	I think there is an audience for Galaga.
1313904	1315905	I don't think I was it because I got bored of it pretty quick.
1315925	1322349	Blackwolf, Bobby, he was saying that be careful with the side images because it causes burn-in on your screens.
1323857	1324277	Wow.
1324538	1327560	Well, it's not a game I would play for an incredibly long time anyway.
1328680	1330501	What you just said reminded me of something, too.
1330622	1330942	What's that?
1331142	1338427	If anyone's ever interested in any of those Namco keychains like they were handing out at E3, you can actually buy them at Kid Robot store.
1339547	1339948	Where's that?
1340908	1342169	Well, Kid Robot has a site online.
1342189	1344751	They're the ones that were selling those big vinyl gorillas figures.
1345091	1345811	Oh, okay.
1346072	1348253	But they have a store on Hayton Ashbury in San Francisco.
1348273	1348353	Okay.
1349318	1353959	Speaking of Namco and E3 and stuff, I saw some old pictures last night.
1353979	1354679	I found some old pictures.
1354779	1358500	I found the pictures from the year that they were demoing We Heart Katamari.
1358960	1361401	And remember when they had the giant Katamari and everybody was putting their stuff on it?
1361421	1364162	So I found the picture of us putting the ferret on the Katamari.
1366402	1369583	I also put one of our demo samplers on there.
1369603	1370163	Yeah, I remember that.
1370343	1371764	And a Reject False Icon sticker.
1373304	1376825	Look, see in chat, GK128 says, Galaga sucks, you sir suck.
1377685	1378825	It's not that Galaga sucks.
1378985	1382626	It certainly led the way for a certain genre of games.
1382726	1384927	It's just, it's not my bag, baby.
1385287	1387587	Okay, you can continue from where you died.
1388087	1388527	Yeah.
1389108	1392908	That kind of eliminates the whole hardcore factor of Galaga.
1393168	1394129	They hit it with a nerf bat.
1394869	1395649	But you don't have to.
1395829	1396329	You don't have to.
1396349	1398189	Why can't they put, like, Ikaruga on live?
1398470	1398870	I don't know.
1398950	1402090	Okay, I mean, that would be... But that's right, there's better stuff coming.
1402150	1403971	You actually just reminded me of the other pinball I saw.
1403991	1404991	It was Austin Powers' pinball.
1406326	1406766	You know what?
1406846	1409848	Actually, we need Radiant Silvergun.
1411428	1411848	There we go.
1411908	1412229	Thank you.
1412269	1412949	Legend of Zaku.
1413069	1413729	Right there.
1413829	1414990	Radiant Silvergun would be awesome.
1415030	1416090	Zaku has it as well.
1416150	1417831	Gradius, greater than Galaga.
1418271	1419251	I would love to see Gradius.
1419491	1422192	But then again, I already have Gradius Collection on PSP.
1422212	1423273	I thought Gradius was coming.
1423673	1423973	Was it?
1424133	1426214	No, there's some shooter that was in that.
1426234	1427494	Well, Gradius and Contra.
1427574	1429115	Contra and Super Contra are coming.
1429295	1429595	Are they?
1430115	1430816	Oh, Contra.
1430836	1431476	I love Contra.
1432020	1432841	I know Contra was.
1432921	1434462	I didn't know it was Contra and Super Contra.
1434562	1441926	Contra and Super Contra and I think Gradius and I've heard some other ones and Street Fighter 2 next week.
1441967	1444088	I saw Time Pilot in that preview too.
1444268	1445049	I like Time Pilot.
1445589	1446950	I think Rally X is coming.
1447890	1448271	What else?
1449391	1453134	Next week of course Street Fighter 2 which I couldn't give a shit.
1453274	1453814	You know what's funny?
1453894	1456956	Now that it's finally here I'm very meh about the whole thing.
1456996	1458417	I'm like I kind of don't care anymore.
1458437	1459618	Now that it's here it's like
1460402	1461662	Is it really going to be that great?
1461822	1464103	I don't know.
1464303	1471785	By the way, something else I think that our chat room might be vaguely interested in is that the person that we bought our Twilight Zone from was the guy who owned Working Designs.
1472765	1473105	Really?
1473505	1479106	We actually have a Goemon doll now that they were going to put out with the next game they were going to do.
1479126	1480066	Let's get them on the show.
1480086	1481167	We should talk to them.
1481307	1481887	We'll see.
1481907	1484327	We'll still get a copy of Sega Ages for Saturn.
1484607	1485107	Very cool.
1485768	1487428	But I thought that that would be just a fun little bit.
1488499	1491660	Eddie of the OL Army says Konami was a lot better than Namco in the arcade.
1492601	1495362	Well, it just depends what you're into.
1495622	1497742	It depends on if you read a Namco arcade.
1498243	1499723	It just depends on the type of games you're into.
1500023	1502124	All right, enough about my gaming week.
1502144	1502524	That's enough.
1503064	1506145	Let's do some housekeeping real, real quick, and then we'll get into the gaming news.
1506185	1507126	Just some quick housekeeping things.
1507446	1510167	OrangeDanceRadio.com had some website downtime earlier this week.
1510187	1511347	We're not sure what caused it.
1511367	1514128	I think it was some type of DNS issue, tech stuff that goes above my head.
1514528	1523530	Needless to say, when stuff like that happens, our fearless webmaster, MrVXJasonXV, who we love and adore because he does the job for free, is on things like that.
1523590	1528411	So we're sorry, but that type of stuff is going to be inevitable, that things go down.
1528851	1534013	Remember, it's all free to you guys, so just keep in mind, things are going to happen once in a while.
1534393	1536613	We are addressing some things with the website.
1536773	1541975	You may see some real facelifts coming to the website in the future, but a lot of that is a long ways down the line.
1542255	1543535	Can't talk about much more than that yet.
1544721	1545622	We could, but it'd be a lie.
1546162	1546942	And then we'd have to kill you.
1547202	1547703	That's right.
1548163	1552585	We'd have to reveal what happens at the secret OLR staff meetings, and then you'd have to die.
1552906	1554086	And then the murders commence.
1555327	1558429	Also, we want to say something about the podcast awards real quick.
1558969	1562091	The podcast awards nominations were announced, and we're not there.
1562851	1563431	But, oh well.
1564232	1568674	The folks that were nominated, all five of them, independent podcasts, which is pretty awesome.
1568834	1569355	That's awesome.
1569575	1572536	And we said, you know, we'd be happy as long as an independent won it.
1572756	1573637	You know, we can't.
1574547	1575328	We don't want to hog it.
1576208	1576888	We can share.
1577048	1580910	No, in all seriousness, folks that were nominated, there's some great shows in there.
1581471	1584372	I know the folks at Gamertag, very passionate about what they do.
1584552	1587014	DreamStation, huge community over there.
1587394	1592176	VGN Radio, fellow all-games show, completely different vibe than what we do here, but that's awesome.
1592476	1594737	I think every independent show should do their own thing.
1595098	1600660	Podtacular, Halo, nothing but Halo, which for some gamers, that's what they do, nothing but Halo.
1601561	1602601	Good show over there as well.
1603382	1603562	So,
1604224	1604704	Have fun.
1604864	1605384	Go vote.
1605764	1607265	Vote for an independent podcast.
1607425	1607925	You don't have a choice.
1607945	1609825	You have to vote for an independent podcast.
1610425	1616086	Maybe we could invite the winners on our show so we could hand over our crown.
1616146	1617867	Like at Miss America, what they do.
1618067	1619387	Where is our crown?
1620467	1622228	I think it's sitting on Jamie's fireplace.
1623528	1624588	It is sitting on my fireplace.
1624988	1626509	It's on my mantle.
1626549	1626849	I don't know.
1626869	1627789	We'll come up with something.
1627809	1628369	Seriously, though.
1628969	1657587	have fun remember independent podcasts we're there to support each other I think every independent podcaster brings something different to the table and you look at those shows I previously named and they're all they've all got something different like you know we have the music you know we have that history being the music game and you know we go to anime expos because a lot of our fan base goes there's these other shows have their own spin on things that they do so you know it's great and diversity is what makes the independent stand out over the commercial stuff um
1658479	1675212	In a way, though, I almost kind of feel sorry for whoever wins, because you're going to have to put up with that same backlash that we did last year from kind of the corporates who I think probably didn't like it that we won, because there was some nasty stuff written about us, including, oh, we're liars, we're drunks, da-da-da, whatever.
1675652	1676873	Only on certain shows.
1676893	1677714	We're still here.
1678054	1679075	We're almost at episode 200.
1679135	1682718	You corp casts are not going to scare us away, and, you know...
1683246	1683586	So what?
1683606	1684127	We didn't get nominated.
1684147	1686648	That would be fun to do an entire show of lies.
1688149	1689290	I would love that.
1689330	1690150	That would be awesome.
1690250	1691771	Lying and being drunk.
1691791	1693092	That'd be excellent.
1693853	1694653	All right.
1694673	1695594	Drunken lie show.
1695634	1695994	I like it.
1696154	1698095	Have fun with the podcast awards this year.
1699016	1699616	Go vote.
1700417	1704019	And vote in the other categories, too, because there's some other independent podcasters in other categories.
1704099	1707401	There's some I've been listening to since, you know, that have nothing to do with gaming.
1707721	1710403	I've been listening to since we started podcasting and good stuff out there.
1711449	1716613	Let's get into some actual gaming news now, and huge news, Jamie, huge news.
1717093	1718114	It's very big.
1719235	1726360	Well, you know how every year we get our butts into E3 and cover all the big news that's coming out?
1726400	1727120	Well, guess what?
1727721	1730002	That has gone right down the crapper.
1730423	1734406	There will be no more E3 as it is known now.
1735186	1737628	That's an important footnote, as it is known now.
1738288	1739189	Because there might be something.
1740171	1749135	Well, basically, Doug Lowenstein, who's the president of Entertainment Software Association, is going to make the announcement that it's gone.
1749155	1749875	Bye-bye, kaput.
1750535	1758698	Yeah, it kind of stinks that we're recording on Sunday, because there'll be more information on this tomorrow, Monday, but we won't be here until next Sunday to really talk about it.
1759459	1767722	Well, a lot of the reason being is that the publishers are, I guess, they're going, you need to pay attention to us.
1769763	1769963	We're
1770487	1772909	We want love, too.
1774931	1777893	So, they whined, and E3 listened.
1778594	1779615	So, no more E3.
1780936	1787141	But there is talk of smaller shows next year, different, more focused events.
1787281	1788942	There already are other shows that go on.
1789022	1790804	Yeah, like, you know, the developers put on their own things.
1790984	1792545	Microsoft did something recently, right?
1792785	1795607	Yeah, the Microsoft Vision Retail Conference.
1795828	1796908	Konami's got something coming up.
1796928	1799771	I don't know if I'm supposed to say that, but Konami has something coming up, and...
1800677	1802758	There's other stuff, too, as well.
1803599	1805800	A lot of the own developers put on their own shows.
1806100	1808181	Microsoft's X06 is coming up.
1808261	1810182	It's going to suck to not have it all in one roof.
1810662	1815425	However, it will keep, I think, a more even flow of information out for people.
1815505	1816705	It makes it easier on us.
1817366	1829712	Because, you know, if we have the different shows come up, introduce their news, we're not putting out... You know, Loki was working his butt off on the PSP site.
1830410	1844960	instead of having to cram everything in and get the information out there before the next guy there's actually going we'll be able to put it out in more digestible forms for other people I think did you see this coming did anybody see this coming yeah
1845566	1846747	I saw them fussing about it.
1846767	1849430	I thought they were just going to close it off to certain groups.
1850271	1861103	Well, maybe that might be what they're doing because we've heard downsizing of the show mentioned a lot where it's going to be a very select audience meeting with developers in meeting rooms.
1861223	1863746	But that kind of screws a lot of the small people out.
1863826	1865127	It screws over the small press.
1865167	1866649	There's no way in hell we're going to get in there.
1867069	1868690	and it's going to screw over Kensha.
1868990	1877354	Everybody that had a show in Kensha with the exception of Red Octane is going to get screwed too, which is kind of sad because there was some pretty kick-butt stuff in Kensha.
1878275	1879635	How are they going to get it out there now?
1880996	1882036	It's kind of sad.
1882276	1893682	I don't know, but I mean it's hard to say because all we have to go off of right now is like kind of a, well, I wouldn't call it rumors, but a very cloudy statement is all we really have to go off of right now.
1894804	1902085	But, you know, for me, E3 kind of started becoming a farce when there was that whole line of people to see Paris Hilton.
1902685	1906406	Seriously, that was my first clue that something's up with the show that's going to change.
1906686	1912107	I mean, that whole freaking hours-long line of people to see Paris Hilton, that's not what E3 is about.
1912507	1913507	Adam West, that's okay.
1913587	1913987	He's cool.
1914207	1915288	Paris Hilton, not cool.
1916728	1917968	Just because she had a game.
1918048	1919828	And how did she have a game anyways?
1919928	1921089	Her likeness is in it.
1921509	1921869	I don't know.
1922329	1922889	It's kind of stupid.
1924282	1927926	Blaze Revolution says, OK, Independent Gamers Conference in our chat room, by the way.
1928326	1930949	Independent Gamers Conference, something for those Kensha Halls companies.
1931669	1935874	I think it's a great idea, but will it be covered by the big gaming sites?
1937255	1938356	And granted, we cover it.
1939014	1949279	and, you know, we'd like to think that we could take on corporate, but the fact of the matter is, a lot of people get their news from the corporate sites, so the corporate folks don't cover it, or give it as a little footnote in their magazine.
1949959	1963446	The fact of the matter is, the corporates are the ones that are at the top of the press list anyways when it comes to these small little sites, or, you know, get-togethers anyways, you know, like, you know, EA's just have their little press event and stuff, and, uh...
1964266	1970091	Yeah, the smaller guys don't see invites because, you know what, in their eyes, the smaller guy doesn't really matter.
1971832	1974734	PooEater says, oh no, what will G4 do for one week a year?
1976035	1981619	Bandit in our chatroom says, did anyone see the video of when E3 opened this year and saw how many people were running just to get to the Wii?
1982520	1982740	Yeah.
1983081	1983281	Yeah.
1983521	1989986	I mean, granted, the Wii was a great thing to check out, but that probably is part of the reason why E3 is changing.
1990406	1991347	You put all that together.
1993241	1993601	I don't know.
1995742	1998822	What would you like to see happen from all this?
2001723	2006524	I really do think the idea of independent shows being the more likely thing.
2006804	2015005	I really do like the idea of different specific companies putting out events where they can cater to their audience a little bit better.
2015465	2019886	Put more focus into it instead of just their little corner of E3 and having to compete with everybody else there.
2021701	2025202	I think it'd be cheaper for them anyways because they don't have to make these giant elaborate booths.
2025222	2028343	They can just rent out a building like Konami's Gamer Day.
2028823	2032824	They rented out a club and they just had some machines set up and stuff.
2033124	2035084	I'm sure that was a lot less money for them.
2035264	2043946	Because a club in the middle of the day when it's not open anyways, that probably didn't cost as much as running a multi-million dollar booth.
2045266	2046667	Banda in chat has a good idea.
2046807	2048147	Independent shows open to the public.
2049480	2052141	Why not have your Kenshiya show that's open to the public?
2052261	2053342	Get everybody talking about it.
2054022	2055603	Well, haven't they been trying stuff like this?
2055663	2060385	I mean, like, well, you've got PAX, for example, which is kind of like an E3, you know, in a sense.
2061025	2065808	You've also got, you know, that show that was in San Francisco, I think, that they had some stuff there.
2066988	2073571	Just like a lot of small... There's the New York City thing they have, the October one that some of our listeners are trying to get us to go to.
2073591	2074512	I can't remember the name of it now.
2074572	2075332	They had the big DDR tourney.
2075352	2076233	Visual Life or something.
2076253	2077053	Yeah, something like that.
2078514	2082378	I heard of another one in Pennsylvania somewhere that's a big show.
2084280	2085861	Why not just do it?
2086222	2092608	Well, I don't know about this, but why don't they just do the mall tours again?
2092968	2095110	The mall tours?
2096031	2097973	Get into a mall and show off your new game.
2098913	2100395	Go right to where the consumer is.
2101058	2101398	I don't know.
2101558	2104959	It's going to be very interesting to see what happens as time goes on.
2106020	2109060	Do you think there's going to be a show that's trying to take the E3 crown?
2109261	2112642	No, I think what's going to happen is E3 will still be around next year.
2112662	2118883	I think it's just going to be a lot smaller and more retarded who gets invited.
2119023	2119744	It doesn't matter anyways.
2119784	2120844	It's kind of going that way anyways.
2121244	2122625	Each year you go there.
2122785	2125706	The first time we went there, we went there as general admission or whatever.
2125766	2127186	Then everything was press only.
2127819	2136528	and then you go there last year and we're press and you go there and know, oh sorry, you're not good enough press to get into our press little thing here.
2137068	2139991	So next year you come back with even more credentials.
2140091	2143815	Oh, I'm sorry, you're just still not good enough as these people that have been doing it longer than you.
2144635	2145496	It gets more ridiculous.
2145536	2147018	Our chat room is yelling...
2147805	2150846	The East Coast Contingent is yelling digital life, digital life.
2150967	2155569	October 4th through 6th, digital life is where the little guys get their chance and all that.
2155589	2158190	So maybe that's something that's going to take the place.
2159451	2164253	Our good buddy Bobby Blackwell from All Games reminded me of what the deal is in Pennsylvania.
2164273	2168375	It's in Philadelphia, America's Video Game Expo at vgexpo.com.
2168795	2170636	And apparently All Games is doing something with that.
2171531	2177537	So that should be pretty cool because I don't know what's going to happen now to E3 Outpost Electric Boogaloo that was supposed to happen in 2007.
2178118	2179059	I say they do it anyway.
2181141	2182082	The E3 funeral.
2182702	2183023	I'd go.
2183663	2184724	Bobby, if you go, we'll go.
2184925	2185565	The E3 memorial.
2186006	2186586	E3 memorial.
2187727	2189169	So we have no idea what's going to happen with that.
2189229	2190730	It just depends on what E3 turns into.
2190770	2193173	I think that we should save up our money and go to Tokyo Game Show.
2194609	2195450	That would be pretty rad.
2195931	2199295	You think the Tokyo Game Show will end up taking the crown on this stuff?
2199535	2200436	It does anyway.
2200476	2201618	Well, in a way, yeah.
2201758	2202479	I mean, it does in a way.
2203379	2205120	Even Tokyo Game Show I think is too big.
2205941	2207662	I personally like these smaller shows.
2208603	2210285	Like, for example, Konami's Gamer Day.
2210385	2212046	You got to play the games.
2213487	2215549	There was not lines to play stuff.
2215709	2216329	It was great.
2216369	2217050	It was small.
2217730	2218951	That's the way it should be.
2219052	2220253	Everybody got to play the games.
2220273	2221514	They got all the information.
2222634	2223175	And that's it.
2223275	2228419	None of the bullshit of, oh, well, sorry, you got to make a meeting in order to see this game that we're showing.
2228899	2231942	What the hell do you go to a convention for to advertise your game...
2232794	2234295	and then you don't show your game.
2234615	2235896	That is the dumbest thing ever.
2236056	2237657	I mean, I didn't understand that at all.
2237818	2238898	It doesn't make any sense.
2239299	2242841	You know, like, especially with, you know, the Nintendo thing.
2242881	2247464	That kind of pissed me off a little bit because you go there to hype up your new machine so what do you do?
2247484	2250026	You make a line and you hold it behind closed doors.
2250886	2251587	That's stupid.
2253288	2253848	It's dumb.
2253968	2256370	I mean, I don't get what they're trying to do.
2257031	2257511	Alright.
2258171	2258892	Well, um...
2259572	2262802	We're going to open up our voicemails of the week on this topic.
2264031	2269434	Showroll, there's something different listed, but I think with this breaking news, we should shift our voicemail of the week to this topic.
2269954	2272435	And if you want to give us a call, it's 916-226-9067.
2273556	2277898	Not right now during the show, if you're listening live, but any time during the week, give that a call.
2278478	2280920	Unless you don't pay your phone bill, then you need to have somebody's permission.
2281160	2281640	And give us a call.
2281660	2282540	We want to know your thoughts.
2282640	2285422	What do you think about this announcement with E3?
2285462	2289504	Especially, because there'll be more information on Monday after we've taped.
2289864	2291285	Really want to know what your guys' thoughts are.
2291325	2293426	Is E3 going to be as relevant as it once was?
2293786	2300350	Is this something that... If not, where do you think the must-be place is going to be next year?
2300630	2301571	We want to know your thoughts.
2301851	2302912	So leave us a voicemail.
2303052	2303792	It's 916-226-9671.
2303832	2315700	You know where I kind of wanted to go because I knew Nellie wasn't going to let me go to E3 next year, but now she's even more happy that it's canceled.
2316480	2320162	Or at least, you know, possibly canceled.
2320442	2320983	Comic-Con.
2321623	2322824	I think Comic-Con would be fun.
2323362	2325583	It would be interesting to see if Comic-Con picks up some of this.
2325643	2327303	Well, Comic-Con had a ton of games there anyway.
2327323	2327703	That's true.
2329104	2330204	Plus, they have movie stuff.
2330264	2335225	We could speculate forever, but we won't know for real until we get some more information.
2335245	2340567	Comic-Con's talking about another show that's way too much stuff going on.
2341087	2343608	There's a lot of stuff that doesn't even have to do with comics.
2344168	2344468	All right.
2345336	2347678	Moving on to another story here.
2347738	2352701	We talked about independent podcasts and independent developers being hurt by E3.
2353022	2354983	I want to talk about this independent production.
2355043	2362889	We had some folks from this production on our show a couple months ago, and it's a game that's being made called The Silver Lining.
2363209	2370292	Now, at one time, this was known as King's Quest IX, The Silver Lining, but there was a whole little bit of back and forth with Vivendi, who owns the rights to King Quest.
2370552	2376294	Well, Vivendi, there was a whole Save the Silver Lining campaign, and they were, you know, I'd call it a success.
2376354	2381136	Vivendi is allowing this game to be released, only the title is now simply The Silver Lining.
2381156	2382837	Well, they had a big press event today.
2382857	2388479	It was like a virtual press event, and they were nice enough to invite me, because we had them on the show previously, so I checked it out, and...
2390070	2392191	I would call this King's Quest labor of love.
2392431	2402475	I mean, it is so obvious to me that the folks behind this game just absolutely love these characters that I'm assuming most of them grew up with, you know, through the various King's Quest games.
2403095	2403775	How can you blame them?
2404035	2405456	The King's Quest characters were awesome.
2405516	2407917	Even I love, like, King's Quest 4, Rosella, and, you know...
2408578	2409018	and all that.
2409058	2412623	So they have really just poured their hearts into this fan project.
2412903	2417429	And their big news today is that they've actually released a playable demo that you can download for free.
2417729	2418690	You want to check this out?
2419051	2421153	Here's the other cool part about this.
2421494	2423716	Orange Lounge Radio, we're mirroring that demo.
2423757	2425539	You can download it on our site right now.
2425879	2449395	Check out www.orangeslaunchradio.com Go to the downloads page and you're going to see what you heard on the show recently You're going to see the Silver Lining demo available to you It's about 77 megs, it's free, check it out The art style is very King's Quest 5, King's Quest 6-ish It's kind of 3D
2450686	2452888	But it's not unfaithful to the previous games.
2453308	2454029	It's very cool.
2454149	2454669	Check it out.
2454749	2459393	It's an early build, but it just is a sign of things to come.
2459753	2460834	And it's not just that.
2461555	2467140	They actually had a guy write an original song for the game, and they released the song today.
2467260	2468421	And it's pretty good.
2468481	2469602	I mean, it's amazing.
2469622	2470622	They have voice actors.
2471223	2471803	It's crazy.
2471863	2477608	It's like what you'd see going into a high-dollar production, but it's all happening on an independent scale.
2478088	2478589	It's awesome.
2479096	2479376	www.tsl-game.com
2505080	2507401	Was it the Project Gotham 360 bundle?
2508081	2512543	The Project Gotham 3 with the 360 being bundled and everything?
2512843	2513443	Not happening.
2514303	2517404	Despite what all those other websites out there say, not happening.
2517504	2519125	Confirmed by Microsoft.
2521566	2522226	Here's my thing though.
2522966	2524347	Not happening in the United States.
2525267	2532189	All these sites that are listing it from what I've noticed so far, like Toys R Us I think was in Canada and I think the EB one I saw was in Canada too.
2533330	2534530	Maybe happening in Canada.
2535305	2541067	That might be something because maybe the 360 is just not selling as well as the United States.
2541607	2549889	So you might see a bundle either being put together by retailers themselves or maybe being done in another country.
2550450	2553551	So look for that, but it is not happening in the United States.
2554171	2559892	I don't think they really have to worry about dropping the price, especially with the PlayStation 3 being so expensive.
2559932	2561553	They're really not worried about that.
2562556	2566278	Eddie is one of our Canadian listeners in chat and says there is no EB game website for Canada.
2566559	2567139	Well, whatever.
2567219	2571782	The one site I saw, I assumed it was Canada because all their prices were wrong.
2571842	2578145	Because they were listing everything at $69.99 retail for all the Xbox 360 games and that's way off.
2578305	2580266	So, whatever.
2580407	2580987	It doesn't matter.
2581547	2583248	It might be happening in another country.
2583308	2586270	That's my only assumption that people are getting this from some place.
2587250	2588611	But Microsoft is saying no.
2588911	2591553	So, take it as you will.
2592887	2594548	I do have some things that are coming out.
2594648	2595268	Well, that's good.
2595328	2595968	That's refreshing.
2596709	2597549	But for the UK.
2598029	2598309	Great.
2598389	2600510	So we have more news about games that aren't coming out in this country.
2601010	2603931	Well, because they probably already have or will be around the same time.
2604072	2604432	True.
2604552	2606452	So enjoy these UK guys.
2606753	2610254	So these are the games that will be released first week in August.
2610494	2612775	On the first, we have Pox Nora for PC.
2613755	2617657	Then we have, on the fourth, Monster House for various systems.
2618217	2619838	Pro Stroke Golf World Tour 2007, ooh, golf.
2619858	2620098	And Stroke.
2624701	2627003	and SingStar Anthems on PlayStation 2.
2628764	2631567	There's actually a few things that are announced.
2631847	2633848	Oh, SingStar Anthems is the gay one, isn't it?
2634089	2634529	I think so.
2634569	2635049	I think that is.
2635129	2637651	It's one that they're marketing towards the gay audience.
2637671	2639413	I remember talking about this a few shows ago.
2640774	2641815	Still not interested, sorry.
2642015	2648440	But our listeners over there should keep their eyes open, though later on in the month there's going to be Dig Dug Digging Strike.
2649033	2653336	Guilty Gear, Dust Strikers, and Star Fox Command.
2654677	2655557	Alright, very cool.
2655817	2656217	Good stuff.
2656838	2659560	In the United States, though, we're getting some pretty neat stuff.
2659880	2665783	First thing's going to be Flat Out 2 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and also, I believe, the PC.
2666104	2667364	So that should be pretty awesome.
2668205	2669906	I know we're getting Super Monkey Ball Adventure.
2670689	2673812	So if you're a fan of the Super Monkey Ball games, look for that.
2673832	2676034	How many of those freaking Monkey Ball games are there now?
2676214	2676534	Too many.
2677054	2679016	PlayStation 2, GameCube, and PSP.
2680257	2680818	Let's see.
2680998	2686362	I believe there was also Barnyard coming out, which is based on the upcoming animated film.
2687043	2689805	Sorry, that just made me think of Barnstorming.
2690706	2693929	And if you're an old-school 2600 player, you've got to know Barnstorming.
2693949	2695630	It was one of the baddest games they had.
2695650	2697852	I mean, bad meaning good, because this was the 80s after all.
2698359	2700780	One of the baddest games on the Xbox 360 was Barnstorming.
2701100	2701420	That's all.
2701881	2703481	Why don't they remake that?
2704862	2705842	I want Barnstorming 2006.
2705982	2709144	On the Xbox 360.
2709204	2710565	Move over, chickens, here I come.
2712565	2713966	That's basically the good stuff.
2714106	2720449	I'm really waiting for the week after that, though, where Dead Rising's coming out.
2720589	2721950	99 Nights is around the corner, too, right?
2722590	2724731	Dead Rising's coming out, and 99 Nights is the week after that.
2725011	2725671	Very exciting.
2726452	2726772	So, uh...
2727216	2727696	Lots of good stuff.
2727716	2730418	And then Saints Row at the end of August, as well as Madden.
2731078	2738543	I was at a GameStop today, finally getting rid of Top Spin 2, because I just didn't freaking play it, and picking up Prey.
2739062	2762844	and um they uh were taking the pre-orders for uh you know those games but they were like you know they had the demo or they had the um really nice setup there for 99 Nights coming soon Dead Rising coming soon all that stuff so and I checked out the trailer on Xbox 360 for Dead Rising very bloody very fun oh I can't wait parents are gonna be mad Jack Thompson's gonna have a stroke it's gonna be great ooh really?
2764005	2764906	get that on tape somebody
2766024	2767185	The Sopranos on Xbox 360 It got the big boot
2796445	2800327	I have to be honest, I totally forgot they were making this game, so no loss here.
2800408	2801228	And I don't watch the show.
2801308	2801888	Well, what happened?
2801969	2803249	I just think that the reason's funny.
2803309	2807932	THQ is saying because there's no difference between that and the PlayStation 2 version.
2808573	2808793	What?
2809673	2813135	Okay, that hasn't stopped them from releasing other multi-platform games?
2813276	2814676	Well, then again, they're not EA.
2815237	2815717	Yeah, that's true.
2815757	2817218	Maybe this is a different developer.
2817278	2820440	Maybe they just have a different outlook on this, a more realistic outlook of,
2821138	2823439	Maybe we just don't want to upcode the damn thing and sell it again.
2823519	2824579	Maybe it's just a waste of our time.
2824759	2833562	Well, they were saying that after they spoke to their... After a few financial conferences, they basically said it's discontinued.
2834462	2836202	The PlayStation 2 version is still going to go through.
2836222	2842344	It should be out around Christmas or Yule or whatever holiday you worship.
2842524	2848186	Just in time for the show to be going off the air, from what I understand, because I think their last season's coming up, or early 2007 or something, so...
2849707	2854590	Well, the game is supposed to be sort of a GTA style, as in you go out and do jobs.
2855871	2857171	I didn't watch the surprise.
2857191	2858952	Sorry, I have to roll my eyes a little bit at that.
2858992	2862494	It kind of seems like all these mob things are caught in between Scarface.
2862514	2865116	They're all copying the... Hey, don't talk bad about Scarface.
2865376	2866297	I'm not, I'm not.
2866337	2868998	The movie's a legacy, but I'm just saying.
2869038	2875622	I hope when they say GTA-like, it means inspired by, but very different.
2877045	2880867	Well, they're all kind of down in that sandbox games.
2881127	2882687	It's basically like a genre now.
2882788	2883408	Well, that's okay.
2884148	2888370	Well, speaking of Scarface, apparently the Xbox 360 version has been cancelled.
2888850	2891852	To be honest, I didn't realize there was an Xbox 360 version coming out.
2892472	2895413	Because this thing was announced, what, back in E3 2005 for the 360?
2897878	2903860	And I didn't even realize that they had decided to continue doing that because it's always been PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PSP.
2903981	2904781	We're not surprised.
2904941	2907262	Eddie in our chatroom says Scarface was never officially announced for 360.
2907982	2908402	Exactly.
2908722	2909963	That's what I was kind of surprised.
2909983	2911324	I was like, I don't remember that.
2911684	2914045	But apparently people have been writing the news stories that it's not.
2914245	2915205	Therefore, it must be true.
2915505	2916105	I guess.
2916326	2917346	If the press is saying it.
2917406	2919387	If they're not liars in the corporate media.
2921108	2921528	Anyway.
2921548	2921988	Or drunks.
2923328	2926010	After all, Final Fantasy XIII looks very much like VII.
2926150	2926870	Anyways, um...
2929436	2931117	The 360 Scarface not coming out.
2931137	2933018	The PSP Scarface though is coming out.
2933178	2935079	And to be honest, Scarface looks very similar.
2935199	2938842	I mean, I guess it's very similar to Vice City because Vice City ripped off Scarface.
2938922	2941324	So it should be a pretty awesome game.
2941344	2943345	The voice talent in it is amazing.
2943665	2945487	And just, I don't know, it looks very fun.
2946347	2947288	So check that out.
2947348	2948369	It's coming out in September.
2950490	2950850	All right.
2951651	2953652	Any other 360 news while we're at it?
2954633	2954993	I can do a 360.
2955033	2955233	All right.
2959633	2959793	No.
2960954	2962634	Actually, there is... Did she say she could do a 360?
2962994	2965075	I don't really know how to read into that.
2965095	2965735	That's pretty pornographic.
2965755	2966175	I don't know.
2969617	2972438	As in, I can turn around in 360 degrees.
2972598	2973478	Jeez, guys.
2976139	2977459	I can do a 60... You know what?
2977479	2978460	I'm not going to finish the talk.
2978540	2979040	You know what?
2979500	2980500	We don't need to know that, Rob.
2980740	2981821	Yeah, so, 360, Xbox.
2981841	2983461	You're listening to KTMI.
2983681	2984842	Xbox, 360, DarkSakura.
2985102	2986162	No, I have nothing else about the 360.
2986402	2988483	But I do have something about PSP.
2989946	2991287	Scarface is coming out on PSP.
2992688	2994309	It's sort of a stripped down version.
3011091	3012612	What about this game, Dawn of War?
3012972	3013592	Oh, there's more.
3014032	3014852	It has a different name, too.
3015752	3017393	It's called Power Money Respect.
3018213	3019333	It's a turn-based strategy.
3020494	3025755	Anyways, there's this Warhammer 4000 game coming out on the 360 as well called Dawn of War.
3026495	3028156	Which, to be honest, I remember playing Warhammer 4000.
3029616	3030536	Actually, Space Marines.
3030936	3034778	Because I used to have the actual miniatures and stuff, which is pretty cool.
3035778	3036138	But the...
3037461	3038742	Warhammer 4000 game.
3038782	3042545	This series has been around for a long time, especially in tabletops and PC games now.
3043146	3045728	We'll actually be getting a 360 version, so that's pretty sweet.
3046008	3050052	They're also planning on making a PS3 version, of course, whenever that system finally rolls out.
3051453	3053054	So look forward to that pretty soon.
3053315	3054436	It's kind of nice to see them doing it.
3054676	3056537	I remember actually Space Marines.
3056578	3064084	They used to do a Space Marines game on the PC, and it had the really cool intro song, but yeah, Space Marines kind of sucked.
3065049	3068210	Sorry, I have to mention the Scarface comment in our chatroom because it's kind of funny.
3068550	3072412	Legend of Zaku says, Scarface on the PSP, say hello to my little friend.
3072832	3073092	Get it?
3073532	3073812	Little?
3073852	3074893	Because it's PSP?
3075673	3076093	Get it?
3076813	3077234	Yeah.
3077574	3077894	Okay.
3078454	3079614	Anyways.
3080635	3083516	Or Pooeater's tagline here, Scarface PSP.
3083776	3084476	You might as well buy it.
3084496	3085257	There's nothing else out.
3086357	3086897	Hey.
3088178	3088738	He's right.
3088818	3089178	No, I'm kidding.
3089875	3092857	What about, there's Vice City Stories coming, right?
3092877	3093417	It's October.
3093657	3094638	Alright, anyway, moving on.
3094678	3098880	Well, Gun Showdown's also coming out that same month, though, in, you know, September.
3098960	3103943	So there is stuff coming out on the PSP, but, and NASCAR, if you like NASCAR, whatever.
3104383	3117431	Speaking of things that are not funny, Gears of War is, apparently there's some users spamming on Xbox Live some Gears of War stuff, and people are thinking, oh, wow, it's some crappy viral campaign.
3118507	3124569	And, well, we don't really know, but a lot of the messages have been pointing back to Gears of War forum.
3125149	3126829	And apparently there's more messages on there.
3126989	3129950	And apparently some giant announcement is supposed to be happening this week.
3130110	3131310	How come I'm not getting spammed?
3131471	3132671	It kind of makes me feel left out.
3132871	3134331	I'm not getting spammed either.
3134351	3135392	This makes me kind of sad.
3135452	3136312	I want a Gears of War spam.
3136332	3137772	Apparently we're just not real press.
3138292	3139153	Apparently not.
3139853	3141993	We're just not cool enough to be getting spammed.
3142253	3142653	You know what?
3142733	3144834	Maybe it's just some dick spamming a forum.
3145695	3147136	It happens all the damn time.
3147296	3158564	It's the same people spamming on live, and it's basically some stupid little... It's the main characters' names, and they're Marcus Phoenix, or M. Phoenix in this case.
3159745	3167611	He's, you know, we need your help, can't talk now, don't know who to trust, we'll send more tomorrow, and just kind of messages this very cryptic
3168767	3172529	Yeah, but Gears of War still looks cool, so I forgive it.
3172850	3174251	That game was pretty hot.
3174291	3176392	Do you really need a viral campaign?
3176612	3178733	I mean, people think the game's awesome anyways.
3178753	3179514	Yeah, that's true.
3179554	3183456	It's like, oh, let's hype up Halo 3 because people don't know about Halo 3.
3183516	3185337	I mean, come on.
3185538	3186618	It's stupid.
3187639	3188179	But whatever.
3188539	3194423	Hey, at least it's not saying, this is Marcus Fenix, and I want you to check out my new Burnout Revenge clip that I have online.
3194863	3195764	Be sure to recommend it.
3198823	3200806	By the way, Biker's War, coming out in November.
3202810	3204533	Well, November so far, because we're not sure.
3204973	3207778	They might push it up, according to some of the rumors out there.
3208118	3208399	All right.
3210051	3219234	Well now, every week on this program, we like to let DarkSakura, speaking of Gears of War, we like to let DarkSakura start grinding her gears over there and surf the internet.
3219254	3220794	That wasn't a 360 joke, don't worry.
3221575	3232198	Surf the internet up and down and back and forth and try to find a website that she wants you, yes you, our listener, to view promptly because it's awesome.
3232578	3235619	So DarkSakura, what are the kitties going to be looking at this week per your request?
3240524	3243285	Our listeners are going to be looking at the best page in the universe.
3245867	3246767	OrangeSoundsRadio.com?
3247347	3247788	It's worth a try.
3247828	3249068	Okay, second best page in the universe.
3249128	3249949	Alright, what is this?
3251209	3255851	The address is Maddox, M-A-D-D-O-X dot X-Mission dot com.
3255871	3256552	Jesus.
3257852	3258233	Alright.
3259353	3262194	I just think that this guy's sense of humor is pretty funny.
3262294	3263295	He's kind of controversial.
3263775	3264676	It's controversial.
3265256	3268597	I mean, even if you don't agree with what he says, at least it's remotely entertaining.
3269358	3269678	Fair enough.
3270038	3271239	I meant to get his book, though.
3272060	3274281	The Alphabet of Manliness.
3274982	3277463	C is for Chuck Norris, and there's a whole chapter on him.
3278324	3280786	Let the Chuck Norris joke die.
3281166	3282747	Step away from the Chuck Norris joke.
3282767	3284628	He's talking about how badass Chuck Norris is.
3284708	3286670	I'm talking to you, Barons, folks.
3286950	3287510	We can dig it.
3288471	3292074	But some of the editorials on here are as follows.
3292514	3293675	I hate Cameron Diaz.
3294775	3296777	Star Wars Episode III is Steaming Pile of Sith.
3298695	3300836	If these words were people, I would embrace their genocide.
3302416	3305037	I just wanted a video game, not an eternal damnation in hell.
3306518	3307198	I am a genius.
3307218	3308599	Oh, that was me playing Pink Pals.
3309139	3309759	I am a genius.
3309999	3310459	You are not.
3311339	3313920	The 11 Worst Songs of 2004, which, by the way, they're all U2.
3315981	3317482	Ben Stiller should star in every movie.
3319582	3321063	And video games you'll never play.
3321983	3322723	Which is great.
3322743	3325464	What kind of video games will we never play?
3326725	3326845	Uh...
3327569	3327949	You know what?
3327989	3328710	I have to pull that up.
3328750	3329290	Give me a second.
3330131	3333192	How about that backwards compatible Barbie game on the Xbox?
3333232	3334573	That's one game I won't play.
3334653	3337995	How about just the really manly suicide of ramming your head against the pavement?
3338635	3341197	You know what game I will play, though, that looks a lot like Barbie?
3342057	3343618	Dead or Alive Extreme 2.
3344699	3347761	That trailer is minutes of entertainment.
3348281	3350442	I can't say hours, because the trailer's only a few minutes.
3350462	3351823	He also puts up his hate mail, too.
3353104	3356686	And apparently writes a whole article's
3357256	3357976	Based on hate mail.
3358677	3359737	And he did one about Ikaruga.
3360037	3362419	Yeah, but then people will write hate mail just to be in the hate mail page.
3362879	3363259	Of course.
3363459	3365800	And apparently he's also banned in several countries.
3367141	3370282	His website is not accessible from... I love what he wrote about Ikaruga, though.
3371323	3377886	If you suck at video games, don't bother reading this review because this game is hard and I don't want whining retards who can't pass the first level bitching to me about it.
3378607	3381550	When I say this game is hard, I mean hard like nipples on the playlist.
3383071	3384052	Oh my god, I can't say that.
3384352	3387615	Okay, way to go, DarkSakura, trying to earn this show an explicit tag.
3387855	3388896	I didn't say it.
3390177	3393720	Visit for yourself to read what was too hot for DarkSakura to say on air.
3394601	3397483	And moving right along then.
3397763	3403808	Speaking of hard, Final Fantasy XI's achievements are fucking impossible is what they are.
3404809	3406751	But anyways, yeah, so...
3407950	3422261	So far, a lot of the achievements, all 32 of them, you know, are fucking impossible, including most of which are level up your character to 75, you know, excellent, you know, or just finish all the Promethea missions, finish all the changes, you know, whatever.
3422281	3425703	30 shitty points for getting my bard to 75.
3425783	3427625	Do you know how long that'll take?
3427665	3428165	You know what, though?
3429502	3431023	Dude, you're a fucking bard.
3432183	3434684	Bards are the easiest character to fucking level.
3434744	3435244	Hold on, though.
3436164	3439165	I can attest that they are not easy to level as I was a bard.
3440225	3442646	Aren't achievement points those supposed to be hard to get?
3443126	3445307	I mean, they're badges of honor, right?
3445327	3446247	Let me put it this way.
3446287	3447707	Because people bitch when they're too easy.
3447727	3448707	Like, we just bitched earlier.
3448747	3449828	Galaga's achievements are too easy.
3449848	3450788	That's fine, that's fine.
3451108	3454109	But if they're going to be hard, make them worth something like, you know...
3455513	3456894	100 points or something instead of 30.
3457895	3463279	I don't want to play for 50,000 hours and go, 10 points!
3463359	3468644	They've only got 1,000 to distribute though because that's the Microsoft laws.
3468744	3469304	And you know what?
3469324	3475389	They shouldn't have put achievement points anyways because no one was expecting them and they had to go put them out there and now they suck.
3475889	3476410	Way to go.
3476450	3477871	You're just mad because you'll never get them.
3478532	3479372	I'm not playing that game.
3479733	3481094	I canceled it yesterday actually.
3481434	3482775	Sorry, but I just wasn't playing it.
3485703	3486483	After you bought it on 360.
3487064	3487404	Yes.
3488304	3489525	Oh, you can't return that sucker.
3490385	3491206	No, I can't return it.
3491426	3493467	Someday I might go back.
3494267	3495268	I quit once before.
3495668	3496208	I'll go back.
3497228	3497689	But we'll see.
3498149	3499930	One hell of an expensive frisbee.
3503732	3506713	You know, I can't addict.
3507693	3507994	All right.
3508794	3509934	Final Fantasy XI.
3509954	3510515	You know what?
3510935	3511095	What?
3512205	3514467	I wish this would happen to just about everybody that played it.
3514627	3517569	Hey, I know some great people that play Final Fantasy XI.
3517609	3519970	Don't talk... I played it for years and years.
3520290	3520991	Addict.
3521071	3522732	Now you're addicted to another crack.
3522752	3524373	I have nothing bad to say about it.
3524433	3525934	It was time for me to move on.
3525974	3528136	And if there's ever a sequel, you know I'm going to be playing it.
3528176	3529717	White Mage, equal, party bitch.
3529897	3530537	Alright, anyway.
3531538	3531818	Okay.
3532398	3537642	However, all those people who are cheating, uh-uh, not anymore.
3538582	3540544	If you were basically...
3541744	3542445	caught cheating.
3543265	3548710	They've actually banned another 2,000 accounts for the use of third-party software tools.
3549390	3553934	I think they just don't want to be one-upped by World of Warcraft.
3554134	3561540	Because World of Warcraft put out that press release, I don't remember if it was this week or last week, saying they banned like 30,000 people from the game or something like that.
3561900	3564562	And Squeenix is like, well, we can't let them have the last laugh.
3564582	3565643	Let's ban some people too.
3566804	3568405	Just because we can.
3569466	3570787	This is, you know...
3571480	3576604	Final Fantasy XI, honestly, you need the windower.
3577304	3578245	It needs the windower.
3579146	3582428	Yes, but that's a third-party utility, and technically, didn't they ban people for that?
3582448	3586972	So basically anyone who's using the windower is probably included in the ban.
3587532	3591835	And I think that's stupid, because why should they monopolize your resources?
3593777	3595258	That's why I love World of Warcraft.
3595278	3597920	At first I was like, eh, but you can play it windowed.
3598658	3601199	You can do other things while you're playing.
3601439	3608022	When I was playing Final Fantasy XI, I had my laptop set up beside me so that I could freaking browse the internet while I was playing a game.
3608202	3611484	I still have my laptop for World of Warcraft because I have Thoughtbot up on it.
3612824	3616286	Maybe after years and years of Final Fantasy XI, I can't play a game in a window like that.
3616806	3619027	I played Ragnarok online for a very long time.
3619427	3619687	I know.
3619767	3622449	And also with Ragnarok, you can't click outside of it.
3622569	3623389	You have to alt-tab.
3628055	3632418	Remember kids, Alt Tab lets you switch between your programs on a PC.
3632918	3634999	So which MMO do you think is going to ban people next?
3636199	3636760	City of Villains.
3636980	3637420	Toontown.
3638761	3639061	Matrix.
3639790	3640070	DarkSakura.com
3660404	3661005	Thanks for watching!
3683991	3685172	Yep, hi Sky, how are you?
3685392	3686432	Hey, I'm really good.
3686512	3688013	Thanks so much for being on our program tonight.
3688053	3688694	I appreciate it.
3688974	3689754	Yeah, my pleasure.
3689814	3690515	Thanks for having me.
3690795	3691075	Awesome.
3691115	3694877	So now for those folks that haven't played the game Prey, what do you think they're missing out on?
3695377	3702681	Well, you're definitely missing out on a lot of aliens, Indians, and everything in between.
3703402	3709365	It's a great storyline intertwined with shooting and endless hours of fun, basically.
3709764	3714245	Now tell us a little bit about the three separate Prey soundtracks available on directsong.com.
3715266	3723448	Well, directsong.com, first of all, is a website that's been around for almost a year now that features video game music exclusively.
3724669	3731871	And so when Prey came out, we really wanted to showcase the two volumes of the soundtrack for Prey.
3731911	3734152	It's over three hours of music for the video game.
3734798	3741940	and it's all done by Jeremy and Julian Soule who are British Academy Award winning video game composers.
3742901	3749183	And they added the orchestral skills to the game's soundtrack which intertwined very nicely with the video game.
3749663	3762607	So those are both available for download on directsong.com and all you have to do is log in and enter your information and stuff like that and then you get the soundtrack and actually
3763334	3765055	industry-leading audio quality.
3765315	3770737	It's twice as good as iTunes and better than most of any of those other sites out there.
3770817	3774819	So it's going at a rate of 320 kilobits.
3775479	3777400	So it's almost CD quality.
3777660	3782241	It'll pretty much be undiscernible to any normal set of ears.
3783182	3783442	Awesome.
3783482	3787884	Now, I know there's a third soundtrack available on the site as well, this Bite Me compilation.
3787924	3791145	It's a compilation of music inspired by Prey, right?
3791165	3791265	Right.
3791946	3794588	Yeah, this is a really fun project that we just put out.
3795349	3806618	And basically what that is, is some of the music is from the video game, including the song that's in the end credits to the game by After Midnight Project called Take Me Home.
3806698	3812803	And then we also have original music from MXPX, Real Big Fish, and lots of other artists.
3812863	3815184	I think there's 13 artists involved total.
3815525	3818367	This is a new thing for video games, to have bands come together
3819062	3822043	and write music specifically for a video game.
3823043	3830946	So this is kind of an industry first as well, where we really wanted to get bands of different genres, so it appeals to all different kinds of people.
3830986	3842090	We've got punk rock, we've got mainstream rock, we've got electronica, yet all the songs directly relate to Prey, whether it be through the musical instruments involved or the samples used.
3842777	3846320	or the lyrics and the themes invoked in the lyrics and stuff like that.
3846580	3848181	It kind of leads into my next question.
3848261	3857007	What is it, do you think, about the game Prey that inspires all these artists to create these diverse kinds of music that all come back to being inspired by Prey?
3858768	3867534	I think one of the things that inspired everyone throughout this process is the incredible graphics and the storyline that's portrayed through that.
3868600	3880109	A lot of these people got to see some video clips and some of the trailers that came out before, as well as we sent everyone an email that had the full storyline of Prey.
3880150	3885113	So everyone saw quickly that this wasn't just a first-person shooter with no story behind it.
3885153	3888276	So the storyline was a big part in most of the songs.
3888876	3889137	Awesome.
3889157	3892059	Now you yourself contributed two tracks to this compilation.
3892655	3894716	The tracks Existence and Intervention.
3894796	3899459	How did your experience with Prey inspire these tracks that you yourself contributed?
3901300	3910024	Since I've been involved with Prey for about six months or so producing this album, it's been a part of my everyday work.
3910464	3917288	I've been thinking about it and looking at videos and really been intertwined with it for a long time.
3918008	3920509	Being inspired by it wasn't that much of a problem.
3920609	3921410	I really wanted to
3922048	3924350	Combine the themes of the game in the music.
3925010	3928793	So in the game, you've got Tommy, the Native American, gets abducted by aliens.
3929634	3944265	I really wanted to portray to the music kind of the same feeling, starting off with Native American themes and then have it be pretty much abducted by aliens and come across with more techno or industrial type sounds and stuff like that and work that all together.
3944966	3953213	Now, I remember actually playing through the Prey demo and then later on the game, and I kind of remember the music was a really big part of setting the atmosphere in the game.
3953313	3958698	So definitely, you know, music lends itself very well to Prey and is an important part of setting the mood in the game.
3959519	3960039	Exactly.
3960279	3962421	Well, we'd like to give our listeners... Oh, I'm sorry?
3963642	3963902	Nothing.
3963922	3970128	I was just going to say that Jeremy and Julian Stoll did a great job, in my opinion, of intertwining the music with the game.
3970188	3972590	Sometimes you don't even notice there's music going because you're just so...
3973360	3976922	From the high desert in the great American Southwest, I'm Art Bell.
3976942	3978562	And we're going to start the night by opening up the lines.
3978823	3981604	And I can already tell you folks, it's going to get very interesting.
4002813	4007034	I'm getting some reports of strange lights in the sky from the Oklahoma area.
4007194	4017277	Our affiliate in Oklahoma City is telling us that the state police, get this, are reporting mysterious lights all over the area and that they're having a hard time responding to all of the calls.
4017477	4020358	It's going to be a wild and woolly night, folks.
4020438	4021258	I just know it.
4021298	4022419	Let's go to the phones.
4022459	4024719	Caller, you're on the air with Art Bell.
4024739	4024899	Yeah, Art?
4024919	4025459	This Art?
4028055	4030198	Yes, it's our caller.
4030679	4034024	There's lights coming in the sky right now?
4034044	4034185	Where?
4044051	4044651	Everywhere.
4045212	4046232	Right over my house.
4046312	4049193	They're moving from north to south.
4049233	4050414	Can you tell me what they look like?
4050434	4051814	Exactly what they look like.
4051834	4052935	Can you tell me about them?
4052955	4059397	There's some are blue, some are green, some are blue, and some red.
4059497	4060177	Oh my God!
4060237	4062458	One of them is so kind of a real spaceship.
4062558	4063739	It's hovering right over me.
4063899	4064319	It's huge, man.
4076545	4077305	I'll take the next call.
4118143	4120028	Strange things are happening in my boat.
4120048	4122174	Do you think someone disappeared?
4122194	4123758	Hey, Paul, I still got my special line.
4199580	4200188	Thanks for watching!
4277540	4295078	Alright, now that was Intervention by Nick Murray here on Orange Lounge Radio Nick is joining us tonight to talk about the soundtrack So Nick, Art Bell is in that song
4296229	4299592	I remember hearing that same sample when I played through Prey.
4299672	4301694	This guy is a legend in UFO culture.
4301974	4303135	How did you get him on board?
4304216	4309161	Well, he was actually signed on by Human Head to do some voiceovers for the game.
4310042	4316667	And Human Head Studios was nice enough to give all of the artists involved in the soundtrack a sound tree.
4317168	4321452	And sound clips from the game ranging from aliens vomiting to
4322430	4325751	and Gunshot Sounds to these voiceover samples and stuff like that.
4325811	4328872	So it was really fun to try to remix that into the music.
4329492	4335973	Now for folks that really enjoyed that song, obviously they could pick up the Bite Me music inspired by Prey soundtrack, but what about your own other music?
4336013	4338354	Do you have another site where you have your own music?
4339774	4340475	Yeah, definitely.
4340495	4349917	You can just go to nickmurraymusic.com and that has my updated blog and streaming mp3s for all my songs.
4350333	4350673	Awesome.
4350973	4357296	Now, talking about one of the other bands on the CD really quick, the After Midnight Project, of course, has the credit song from the game Take Me Home.
4357856	4365420	There's actually a whole music video that you can see on the website about this, and I guess you guys, it was on G4 and some of the other TV stations.
4366160	4366821	How did that happen?
4366861	4369802	How did you guys think, oh, let's do a music video out of this?
4372263	4376805	First of all, working with After Midnight Project has been really great throughout the whole process.
4376825	4378626	They've been really well integrated
4379802	4381503	Really nice to us, really involved and stuff like that.
4381523	4383083	Really good with promotion.
4383783	4389545	And one of the guys that works with us and actually works with the video game company, who's one of our main connections, named Jaron Moore.
4390105	4393225	He has a film background and really wants to get into film directing.
4394306	4397427	And he managed that whole project, the whole music video.
4397447	4403568	And he went out to LA and filmed the band and actually did all the editing and splicing and the game footage and all of that.
4403608	4406089	So it was a really, really good effort by Jaron.
4406289	4407189	And it turned out really well.
4408459	4408699	Awesome.
4408719	4410080	Well, congratulations on that.
4410121	4413103	I know this has been getting airplay I read about on the site, so that's great.
4414124	4420790	Now, talking about the website as a whole, directsong.com, I noticed that Prey isn't really the only thing available there.
4420810	4424333	There's several game soundtracks like Oblivion, Dungeon Siege 2.
4424853	4428736	What do you think are the advantages of digital distribution for music?
4429997	4436583	Well, one thing is that games are digital, so we're staying within the same realms as
4438144	4439304	What gamers are used to.
4440345	4447210	Second of all, what we hope to do is give the users more game music expansion.
4447750	4456256	So right now you can download expansion packs for Guild Wars on our website, one of the first games that we put up on our website.
4456657	4460579	And that music is brand new music that will then work in game.
4461220	4463802	So that's a really fun piece of technology that we're offering.
4464778	4466539	besides just downloading the soundtracks.
4466759	4467239	I noticed that.
4467299	4470380	It all needs to be digital so it can work into the online games.
4470980	4478382	I noticed that's a really exciting addition I noticed to the site is that you can actually download these new soundtracks for games.
4478442	4487985	And especially when you think about an MMO type of game like Guild Wars where you're hearing the same music over and over, this seems like somebody should have done this a long time ago.
4488105	4488746	This is great.
4489646	4490106	Exactly.
4490326	4493407	It's one of those ideas that you say, man, I wish I thought of that.
4494294	4496622	Well, you guys did, so congratulations.
4496683	4498268	Have fun raking in the money there.
4498810	4499533	Well, we hope so.
4500831	4507293	Alright, well, now, just kind of out of curiosity, going to the other side of it, because, you know, we're talking about game soundtracks as a whole.
4507714	4518317	Some people in the past have complained that, you know, why is it that you have all these B-movie soundtracks sitting on store shelves, yet there's no game soundtracks out there?
4518397	4524360	Do you think that, in the end, there's a market for game soundtracks in a CD-based traditional format?
4524660	4527901	Or is digital distribution where it's at, and where things are going?
4529325	4530486	You know, I'm not quite sure about that.
4530526	4539673	We've had some distributors come and talk to us about putting these on actual CDs and putting an online store on our site, and that stuff may all be in the future as well.
4540734	4547438	But right now, like I said, this site's only been up for about a year, so that's just basically what we've been rolling out first.
4548279	4553163	In terms of long-term industry, hard for me to say on that one, but...
4554811	4565459	The gaming music is progressing so much as a whole that it will start getting as much clout or as much respect as movie scores as well.
4585536	4595624	Myself, I actually just bought an Xbox 360 because I was waiting for my other standard Xbox to die out and it finally just crashed way too many times for me to even handle.
4596625	4603350	So I was stuck playing FIFA 06 on my other Xbox, which actually I've been addicted to that game for months now.
4604650	4609274	So yeah, personally I'm more of a sports game guy than a shooter kind of person, but
4611363	4612404	Alright, awesome.
4612864	4614925	Well, you ever do gaming on live?
4614985	4616186	You go online, do any of that stuff?
4616907	4618208	I haven't really got into that yet.
4618228	4619429	I hope to get into that soon.
4620729	4623611	I'm kind of waking up to that whole world of online gaming.
4624032	4624392	Alright.
4624772	4628795	Well, anyway, if our folks want to check that out, it's music from Prey.
4628815	4632758	There's two soundtracks as well as the Bite Me music inspired by Prey soundtrack.
4633078	4635120	It's available on directsong.com.
4635500	4637421	Nick, thanks so much for joining us tonight on the show.
4637441	4638282	We really appreciate it.
4639062	4639742	Thank you very much.
4639762	4640302	My pleasure.
4640462	4641602	Is there anything else you wanted to say?
4641622	4643223	Nope.
4643443	4644843	Sounds good.
4645443	4646083	Sounds good.
4646163	4646823	Thanks so much.
4647244	4647664	Thank you.
4648424	4649004	That was pretty cool.
4649824	4655045	I know definitely the music in Prey and Elder Scrolls and all that kind of stuff is actually pretty sweet.
4655865	4665787	Well, anyways, speaking of music, I know Microsoft's been trying to very eagerly keep this whole Zune thing kind of under wraps because of their...
4666266	4692989	surprises and how they're going to basically take over the whole you know music and portable markets well anyways Microsoft exec let's see one of the top ones actually he is basically dismissing the PlayStation 3 and the Wii launches as just pretty much who cares because we're going to be you know launching with our brand new Zune and all that stuff and our system is just awesome and
4694073	4723264	Anyways, it was just kind of interesting, this was actually being run on MCV Interactive Entertainment Weekly and they were talking about how because the PlayStation 3 price being so high and how that the Wii is basically not able to compete with them processor-wise and graphically that Microsoft doesn't really have anything to worry about as far as winning the next-gen console war, which I think is a bit I don't know
4724830	4727072	That's not a very good way to look at it.
4727252	4728193	Maybe in this country.
4728973	4730274	But, I don't know.
4731435	4732756	I kind of said this a long time ago on the show.
4732796	4736319	It's very interesting what this next-gen war is going to be on a worldwide scale.
4736619	4738641	Because Xbox is still struggling in Japan.
4739542	4743685	I'm surprised that they don't look at it with the success of Live.
4744806	4749690	It doesn't take great graphics and stuff to make an awesome game.
4749790	4752052	Look at Geometry Wars.
4752172	4753172	Look at the upcoming...
4754537	4756118	Castle Crashers or whatever that was.
4757098	4759679	It's simple graphics and just fun gameplay.
4759699	4764182	It doesn't need to be all... Yeah, seriously, one of the most anticipated titles, Street Fighter 2.
4764762	4766403	Street Fighter 2, yeah, perfect example.
4766503	4768143	I mean, it's just all about gameplay.
4768604	4775347	But, you know, they were comparing the GameCube or the Wii, it's all... Although the Wii is almost a GameCube with a DVD drive.
4775367	4781250	Nintendo... Is Nintendo going to have enough quantity to satisfy the demand?
4781650	4782790	They're talking about shortages.
4783011	4783831	That's like the
4784892	4787213	Pot calling the kettle black, but whatever.
4788593	4790554	But basically they said, you know, wait.
4791074	4803900	They've got a lot of Quarter 4 surprises coming, of course, with the Zune and whatever they're going to be, you know, possibly linking the Zune with 360 and PC Vista, etc.
4804540	4806641	So it should be interesting.
4806661	4807581	We'll have to wait and see, though.
4810022	4814004	Well, there actually is a little bit more about a Nintendo game.
4814344	4814584	Okay.
4815766	4823515	Well, people by now know that we've had our little bit of excitement over Osutatakayo and on getting a US release as Elite Beat Agents.
4824977	4829964	Well, there's a list released, a partial list, I should say, of songs that might be in the game.
4830584	4831185	Oh, cool.
4831606	4831826	Okay.
4832298	4834420	There's a Stereogram Walkie Talkie Man.
4835040	4836401	This is, by the way, coming from Bin Mani Style.
4837182	4837883	Okay.
4837983	4842026	Deep Purple Highway Star, Eve Six Inside Out, Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida Loca.
4842606	4843327	Uh-huh.
4843887	4845469	Savage Garden, Truly Madly Deeply.
4846530	4846810	Okay.
4847110	4848711	Weird Al Yankovic, Hardware Store.
4848891	4849412	That's cool.
4849812	4850273	I love Weird Al.
4850293	4851934	Weird Al Yankovic, that's hardcore.
4851954	4852394	That's awesome.
4852755	4853755	Linkin Park, In The End.
4854096	4855397	Okay, just lost interest.
4856057	4856778	Yeah.
4856898	4859060	That's the song that should be playing while you're playing, like...
4860351	4861571	Okay, that's for the MySpace kids.
4861611	4861991	That's fine.
4862371	4862672	What else?
4863852	4865612	No, I was actually going to say why you're playing R-Type.
4867412	4868593	Okay.
4870033	4870873	Offspring, hit that.
4871653	4874354	Queens of the Stone Age, Go With the Flow, Kylie Minogue, Locomotion.
4874614	4876194	Why can't they pick any of her new stuff?
4876994	4877554	Interesting.
4878575	4879755	Guns N' Roses, Sweet Child of Mine.
4880275	4880835	I can dig that.
4881495	4882475	Bare Naked Ladies, One Week.
4885636	4886016	Yeah.
4886316	4888897	Spirit Snare in our chatroom says, LOL, Emotendo.
4889577	4890037	Emotendo.
4891215	4893497	Well, there's also some new features that are going to be in it.
4893577	4895879	There's single-card multiplayer now.
4896399	4896819	Oh, cool.
4896940	4898881	But there will still be multi-card multiplayer.
4899922	4907488	You can also send the equivalent of the E3 demo, which is Walkie Talkie Man, Highway Star, and Tutorial Mode from the Japanese game by download play.
4908868	4909488	Well, that's kind of cool.
4909788	4911289	There's two new scenarios.
4911409	4918432	There's a young man trying to win the heart of his dream girl, and a construction worker who's behind on a project and has one hour to finish it.
4918472	4920773	Hmm, Hardware Store sounds like the song for that one.
4920793	4921674	Yeah, it sounds like, yeah.
4922574	4923094	Interesting.
4923554	4924735	Well, we'll see more.
4925035	4926896	I think it was most... I'm sorry.
4927216	4928977	This gives me more incentive to import.
4929317	4934239	I was going to say, what's most interesting about that song list is it kind of really makes the Japanese ones stand out.
4934259	4936140	Like, these are really two different games.
4937051	4937652	TechnicBeat TechnicBeat
4957598	4961400	Luminous 2 Heavenly Star Tetsuya Mizuguchi and his team actually created the song and it
4987608	4995794	Supposedly insanely catchy, and also I'm going to have a really awesome video to go with the background, which features an alien singer.
4997776	4999016	I thought that was Hollaback Girl.
5000257	5000958	No, I'm sorry.
5001018	5002779	Incredibly catchy song with alien singer?
5004380	5006562	A simply stunning video.
5006582	5010005	I don't think Hollaback Girl would follow on that.
5010085	5014028	But he says he was inspired by Take On Me with...
5015043	5016684	Oh, now that's cool.
5016724	5017884	Hmm, kind of neat.
5037768	5046133	If there at any point is a reference to Luminous 2 going, this game is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S, I will have a video on YouTube of me smashing my PSP.
5046393	5046793	Bah.
5047494	5047974	Nah.
5048714	5049175	Nah.
5052096	5055118	Something else that sometimes makes me want to smash something is Myspace.
5055698	5057739	By the way, join the Orange Lounge Radio Myspace.
5057779	5060281	It's Myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
5060954	5071710	and Kotaku ran a very interesting observation earlier this week on their site capturing a very interesting MySpace ad and you guys can maybe see that ad here in studio a little bit.
5071810	5072832	It's got
5073408	5080955	I guess, I don't know if that's a guy or a girl or something, whispering to a hot chick, quote unquote, and then there's another hot chick sitting there.
5080995	5085279	So it's like, you know, everybody's dream of two chicks, I suppose.
5085540	5086320	Not my dream, but whatever.
5086340	5087922	I think those are two chicks about to make out.
5088002	5088242	Is it?
5088362	5088923	Okay, well, whatever.
5089083	5093307	Well, the text on there says, horny gamer girls looking for fun.
5094828	5098472	And I'm wondering, is this like targeted advertising by Myspace?
5098797	5102598	Because I know whenever, you know, it's no real secret on this program, I'm gay.
5102678	5106739	And whenever I log on to MySpace, that's all I ever get are gay personal sites.
5107159	5111500	Like, how many freaking times I could see these ad banners is incredible.
5112180	5114240	Sadly, I will probably never see this one.
5114641	5117061	Maybe I'll get a Horny Gamer Guys, but I somehow doubt that.
5117081	5121322	It doesn't seem to be the... Is this an incentive for me to unblock ads?
5122462	5122802	You know what?
5122822	5125063	MySpace has some pretty funny ads, actually.
5125103	5125443	There's some...
5126095	5126775	Thank you for watching!
5148140	5154964	I don't really know why we brought this up, but I suppose gamers are being targeted in advertising on Myspace, so keep an eye out for the ad.
5154984	5158186	Just don't click on it, because then that shows you support this, and there'll be more.
5158666	5160347	Unless you want there to be more, I don't know.
5160627	5164930	I support hot, you know, gamer girls making out with each other.
5165250	5166571	I support that fully.
5166711	5167451	It's my endorsement.
5167691	5168132	But anyways.
5169232	5169532	Pig.
5169752	5172654	The other thing I support fully is violence!
5173315	5174775	And much violence.
5175096	5177477	Now this, this, I can... This I can
5178078	5179999	I think all of OLR can agree on this one.
5180039	5182080	Violence in games is wonderful.
5182480	5183541	Violence is fantastic.
5183701	5195227	But anyways, in Iowa State researchers have found violent gaming sessions can reduce the psychological response or physiological response of real-life violence in the short term.
5196328	5198269	But I question this still.
5198409	5203431	Anyways, going this further, they basically had a...
5206066	5215869	257 college students and they were made to play certain games and they were following with real life violence 20 minutes later.
5216269	5218310	So they were showing them and seeing what their reactions were.
5219090	5223591	The games they made them play though, well these are just a bit old.
5224151	5226892	I don't think it's a very good representation of games nowadays.
5227232	5229633	Carmageddon, Duke Nukem 3D,
5231608	5235209	Mortal Kombat, Future Cop, which were on the violent side.
5235409	5237089	And I've never heard of these games.
5237190	5242771	Glider Pro, 3D Pinball, 3D Munchman, and Tetra Mattis on the non-violent side.
5244451	5248032	I'm reminded somehow of that scene from A Clockwork Orange.
5248072	5250733	You remember that scene where they're forcing them to watch all the movies?
5251993	5254994	For some reason, this whole story reminds me of that.
5255014	5258575	Because they're shoving all these violent games down someone's throat.
5261093	5265875	Duh, they're going to be numb to the imagery after a while.
5266495	5268936	I think it's not a matter of violent games.
5269376	5273557	I think it's a matter of boring games and non-boring games.
5274057	5275798	Say, for example, Carmageddon.
5275978	5286001	I'm sure that's much more exciting than 3D Munchman or Glider Pro, a game which sounds like it's probably on a hang glider and you're just flying around doing nothing.
5286451	5288473	I'm sorry, those games are boring.
5288513	5296180	Whereas, if I'm bored to death and all of a sudden someone shows me a shot of someone being shot point blank, I'm going, whoa!
5296280	5299803	Whereas, if I'm kind of awake, I might go, wow, that's kind of neat.
5300264	5310053	But I'm not going to be just like, oh my god, that's really offensive because I've been playing Munchman instead of, oh my god, I destroyed giant mutant pigs.
5310513	5312135	That does not offend me in any way.
5313188	5313468	I don't know.
5313708	5314549	I think it's kind of retarded.
5314629	5317250	Wasn't Munchman the name of the little guy on Square One TV?
5318271	5319091	Mathman, never mind.
5319932	5323474	Munchman, I believe, is a knockoff of probably Pac-Man.
5323634	5324794	Okay.
5325134	5325855	Here's my thought.
5327095	5338141	What if they did this exact same study, but instead replaced it with the nightly news, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, any zombie B-movie flick from the 70s?
5338582	5340323	I mean, wouldn't it all have the same effect?
5341043	5341163	Yeah.
5342558	5347760	So this study seems to be kind of, I don't know, like targeted to kind of blame games.
5348080	5348740	Like it's skewed.
5349941	5351941	Like it seems like there needed to be a control here.
5353222	5353602	I think so.
5353642	5357863	Are games more desensitizing than the nightly news or than movies?
5358043	5359384	That's the study I want to see.
5359544	5361825	Show me a comparison.
5361925	5364546	Don't just throw these numbers at me.
5364566	5365066	You know what I mean?
5365346	5366186	That's my problem with it.
5366486	5368247	DarkSakura, do you have a thought on this at all?
5370692	5378056	As far as the desensitization goes, there's already a lot of exposure, honestly.
5379356	5389301	It's like you take the child who grows up never able to watch the news, never able to watch TV, never able to play a video game, and how are they when they grow up and see what the real world is like?
5389801	5391242	They go pretty nuts.
5392122	5396704	And then you take one who may not have been allowed to play video games, but they watch the news with their parents.
5398025	5399586	I think they'll be just as equally...
5400615	5402599	and Desensitized Remedies, someone who's an avid gamer.
5413923	5417126	I've been desensitized to violence, but not from games.
5435779	5438240	I can control the action on a DVD player too.
5438380	5439201	I can rewind.
5439461	5440561	I can freeze frame.
5440821	5441381	It doesn't matter.
5441942	5444722	The whole thing is, just like with Saw, for example.
5444763	5445483	Let's take Saw.
5445523	5446383	That's a perfect example.
5447063	5454326	You have a basic movie where someone is kidnapped and they have a giant device on their face with spikes in it that's going to basically...
5455788	5457228	Slam into them and kill them.
5457448	5460369	Well, and they also show, you know, someone sawing off their foot.
5460829	5467031	I think that's a lot more violent than, say, Duke Nukem 3D, which has pixelated graphics that look like a cartoon.
5467411	5472672	I mean, did anyone throw a fit when, you know, the Roadrunner, you know, got Wile E. Coyote to fall off a cliff?
5473052	5476713	That's hundreds of feet that he fell to his death.
5477113	5478654	But, oh, sure, he came back later on.
5478954	5479334	Guess what?
5479374	5481034	That's what happens when you shoot the pig.
5481334	5482534	It spawns later on.
5482674	5484655	So, I don't see what the big deal is.
5486451	5510512	for me um i i've been gaming a long time i've played a lot of violent games and a lot of you know funny violent games like i love mortal combat but like real blood like my brain totally knows the difference between game movie and real life because like i could watch somebody cut their cut their hand and they need stitches and i freak out like i'm like oh my god it's real blood uh gross gross you know i get all freaked out you know i'm totally one of those i get
5511102	5515605	You drive by a horrific car accident and I'm going to cry if I see a body.
5515805	5522570	Even watching the news, you see a lot of horrible stuff on the news and I just feel depressed.
5522870	5524571	My brain knows the difference between the two.
5526247	5531571	I can feel that reaction to real blood, but then I can play a game and I think it's funny because it's not real.
5532171	5534073	Because, yeah, you're smart enough to know it's not real.
5534173	5538676	What the hell is wrong with people if they don't know what's real and don't know what's not real?
5539117	5544400	That's the bigger problem, not being desensitized to violence, being desensitized to what's reality and what's not reality.
5544841	5546362	That's the big problem right there.
5546682	5553727	And I think if people are that retarded, well, they need to be put in some sort of mental hospital because obviously they're not fit for society.
5555589	5555849	True.
5557335	5564239	I think that, again, this goes back to parental responsibility.
5565040	5566220	It is their job.
5566441	5573025	When they brought that life into the world, they had an unwritten contract.
5574197	5578739	They would make sure that this entity would grow up to be a functional member of society.
5579239	5584080	That if they could not become a functional member of society, they would help them seek the treatment they need.
5584401	5586281	Instead of going, oh, therapist, blah.
5586821	5589502	And not noticing if there's anything else that might be causing the problem.
5590062	5599226	But, you know, I think that a good parent will pay attention to what their child... You know, I admit, a child is going to be sneaky.
5599666	5600426	I was a sneaky kid.
5601327	5615560	They're not going to be able to be there 24-7, but if a parent takes an active interest in what their children are doing, participates in their life instead of dictates their life, you know what I mean?
5616160	5627010	I don't think they'll be as much of a... They don't have a right to blame a game when it's their responsibility for making sure that their child turns out how they feel is right.
5627959	5637664	and if they think that the game is going to desensitize them to violence later and want them to retain a feeling of sensitivity, they need to limit how much their child's going to play it.
5638785	5640606	I think that's the problem with human nature these days.
5640966	5648751	People are far more apt to blame other things, other objects, blame the TV, blame a video game for what's really the problem.
5648911	5649291	You know what?
5649391	5651632	Your kid is just a maladjusted dick.
5652753	5654554	It's a lack of accountability.
5654814	5656435	I really think it's a lack of self-accountability.
5656475	5656615	Well,
5657130	5657590	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5676678	5700949	Can you, I'm sorry, cops, the TV, this stuff is out there all the time in any of your dramas, like 24, I mean, how many Law and Order, police, you know, dramas out there right now, this stuff is all over the place, like, and people aren't probably surprised about that, because it's like, yeah, I've seen that before, you know, it's kind of like, you know, um, I don't know, it's like, uh,
5703358	5705320	Like Pamela Anderson naked.
5705780	5706740	I've seen that before.
5706900	5707901	It's not surprising.
5708862	5716546	It's not like, wow, oh my god, I was not expecting her to have breasts under there, but it's just, you know, it's not surprising.
5716566	5730255	You're not going to be... For example, if you're like, you know, playing these boring ass knockoffs of games by the sound of the generic names that they have, 3D Munchman, you know, if you're playing that, then all of a sudden they show you, you know,
5731415	5735459	Prison Fight, I'm going to be like, hell yeah, this is a lot better than 3D Munch, man.
5735679	5738962	I mean, so I don't know what the hell they were expecting.
5739122	5740923	All right, I got to let our chat room have a say here.
5740963	5742845	Over at OrangeLawnTrader.com, click on chat.
5743806	5748430	Eddie of the Oil Army says, my mom played Halo for a few weeks with me when I first got my Xbox.
5749331	5750351	Oh, that's cute.
5750371	5750952	Good for your mom.
5751052	5754195	Yeah, you know, the family that plays together is closer.
5754255	5754575	I don't know.
5755055	5755316	I don't know.
5756317	5756717	That sounds...
5757262	5758302	Almost dirty, though, but that's not true.
5758823	5766725	GK128 says, There is a difference between violence in a video game and violence from, say, a real video where a dude is blown to bits from a torrent.
5768126	5769466	That's gross, but true.
5770507	5772547	DarkTetsuya says, Hello Kitty drove him to violence.
5774148	5775889	Hello Kitty drives everyone to violence.
5776709	5780030	Funnydale seems to think Munchman was a knockoff of an 80s porn film, actually.
5781671	5782771	Leave it to him to make the funny.
5784632	5785292	Alright, uh,
5785825	5787006	Any other thoughts on this topic?
5787026	5788607	We'd love to get your thoughts in our mailbag.
5788987	5795110	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you want to send us some emails, Jamie's going to be digging into the mailbag in our next segment.
5796191	5796771	I sure will.
5797132	5800674	I think this time I'm going to need an extra thick hazmat suit this time.
5801514	5802615	Maybe some asbestos gloves.
5803595	5804776	Just one last thing.
5805216	5813261	If they want to test whether people are desensitized to violence, they don't need to show courtroom battles, cops, that kind of thing like Loki said.
5813965	5817047	Show some pictures of some guy with his head blown off by a shotgun.
5817587	5819088	Stuff you would see on shock sites.
5820449	5822791	That will test your sensitivity to violence.
5823792	5825813	Courtroom Battle made me think of Phoenix Wright.
5826093	5826533	Objection!
5826694	5827314	Exactly.
5827414	5828495	People don't need to see that.
5828535	5830216	I've seen pictures of people eating babies.
5830496	5831617	That's pretty disturbing.
5834158	5834619	Courtroom.
5834999	5836720	Or outbursts in a courtroom.
5837140	5839182	I've never seen that in a movie before.
5840544	5843326	Cops, oh my god, never seen cops before.
5843406	5847149	I object to where this show is headed, so I think it's time that we have a break.
5847529	5850151	Speaking of violence real quick though, I need to get this out here.
5850752	5856576	If you don't listen to the rebroadcast of Orange Lounge Radio over on allgames.com, there will be violence.
5858057	5860519	Yeah, we'll poke you in the nose and call you a poopy head.
5861240	5863441	And by the way, we're moving times over there.
5863461	5865463	There have been some schedule changes over all games.
5865743	5866884	East Coasters are going to love this.
5867264	5869746	The show is now Mondays at 5 o'clock.
5870603	5873424	Pacific Standard Time, which would be 8 o'clock for you East Coasters.
5873444	5881387	So if we're making you stay up too late on a Sunday, you can always listen to the show in its entirety, parts A and B, over on allgames.com on Monday nights.
5881407	5889489	And that's right after the big live show they do, All Games Interactive, which is taped live at the Arena Interactive Lounge, home of the E3 Outpost.
5890050	5893071	And I don't know what's going to happen with that next year.
5893131	5895592	We'll see in light of what we've talked about earlier in this segment.
5896372	5896652	All right.
5897573	5898375	So let's go to a break.
5898395	5901426	We'll be back a little later with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
