controversial changes in its expansion, and brace yourselves for Animal Crossing the movie.

01:02.500 --> 01:07.460

01:07.460 --> 01:11.460
a California guy my whole life very humid and I realize it's not East Coast

01:11.460 --> 01:15.460
humid but it's pretty darn humid which we're not used to here this is not humid

01:15.460 --> 01:21.160
yeah but it's humid er than usual it's not humid it's maybe moist it's not the

01:21.160 --> 01:27.480
humid uh Loki is also here our tech master Loki that was a horrible joke I know how you

hello to Andrew Loktar bitches how you doing for the Horde uh we're here to talk about

01:40.960 --> 01:45.560
video game news that doesn't suck uh sometimes we talk about sucky news this is actually

01:45.560 --> 01:48.680
a little bit of a slow news week so we might have some news of suck tonight I don't know

01:48.680 --> 01:54.140
We'll see we'll see what's on our plate, but we're gonna start off tonight's show as we always do talking about what video games

01:54.240 --> 01:57.320
We've been playing Dark Sakura. What have you been playing my friend?

01:58.040 --> 02:02.840
played some Animal Crossing in World of Warcraft for like an hour and

02:04.480 --> 02:06.480
a lot of pinball a

02:07.620 --> 02:09.460
lot of pinball

02:09.460 --> 02:12.820
What machines that's just the same ones you own just the same ones

02:12.820 --> 02:18.140
So I actually played a lot of last action hero today except it's really hot in the garage and I wanted to die

02:18.420 --> 02:22.800
So I went back in and tried not to you know become a corpse since I had to do the show today

02:23.140 --> 02:28.380
Gotcha, and I played with Legos last night, but you baked cookies. I made cookies amongst your you know boredom

02:28.380 --> 02:31.060
So that's great and my cookies are made of awesome and win

02:33.060 --> 02:34.700
And chocolate

02:34.700 --> 02:38.520
You could also make you could almost make a sequel to the milkshake song out of that

02:38.520 --> 02:41.520
My cookies are made of awesome and win. Forget it.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.520
Rob.

02:42.520 --> 02:45.520
Kill me. It's made of lose and fail, sorry.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.520
Shut up.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.520
Look, I have had a really strange week, okay? That's all I have to say.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.520
Anything else then?

02:52.520 --> 02:53.520
Excuses, excuses.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.520
I know, I always have excuses. Anything else then?

02:56.520 --> 02:58.520
Dark soccer with the games?

02:58.520 --> 02:59.520
No.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.520
Alright. Loki, what have you been playing this week?

03:02.520 --> 03:08.920
I played Crowhounds, and, well, what else did I play this week?

03:08.920 --> 03:10.520
Blazing Angels, even though it sucks.

03:10.520 --> 03:14.120
I haven't played any Blazing Angels this week, Jackass.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.120
Wow!

03:15.120 --> 03:16.120
Did you finally get rid of it?

03:16.120 --> 03:17.120
No, not yet.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.600
I still have to finish it, even though it sucks.

03:19.600 --> 03:25.880
So I played more Grand Theft Auto, because that's awesome, and actually I'm going to

03:25.880 --> 03:29.120
be cleaning out some of my games here pretty soon, so I do need to finish Blazing Angels,

03:29.120 --> 03:31.120
because that's got to go back.

03:31.120 --> 03:36.120
So um, selling back Katamari, me and my Katamari, just bored at that game.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.560
But it's so cute and fun!

03:37.560 --> 03:41.280
It's so cute but who cares, you know, I don't care.

03:41.280 --> 03:46.080
But anyways, um, other than that, what else did I play, I think I played a little bit

03:46.080 --> 03:54.620
more Ridge Racer, and, oh uh, I watched Nellie play Cloning Clyde, because I played more

03:54.620 --> 03:55.620
Frogger too.

03:55.620 --> 03:59.120
What's Cloning Clyde all about, because I didn't have time to really download it and

03:59.120 --> 04:00.120
check it out.

04:00.120 --> 04:04.120
been watching her play and you have no idea what's going on. Yeah, but I've been watching her play it from the couch

04:04.120 --> 04:08.120
while I'm watching TV. So, it looks like

04:08.120 --> 04:12.120
it's basically solving puzzles. You have to kill all these robots in the level

04:12.120 --> 04:16.120
before you're allowed to exit. And they have, you know, 20 different levels or so.

04:16.120 --> 04:20.120
And you basically can clone yourself as well as

04:20.120 --> 04:24.120
you know, be able to transform into different things. Plus it has exploding chickens

04:24.120 --> 04:28.120
that you get the kick. So, that's really fun. Well, I always wanted to play

04:28.120 --> 04:31.740
game where I can kick chickens that's great exactly but um you know it's nice

04:31.740 --> 04:37.300
to see that they're actually putting out some new live arcade games and I don't

04:37.300 --> 04:41.420
know I was trying to get a hold of the Saints Road demo but I haven't made it

04:41.420 --> 04:45.780
over to like a GameStop or something to pre-order the game yet but apparently it

04:45.780 --> 04:50.620
did pop up on the German server for a little bit and some people were able to

04:50.620 --> 04:54.540
nab it before it you know dropped down one of my instant message buddies said

04:54.540 --> 04:58.540
he got a copy of the uh... september magazine original xbox whatever it's

04:58.540 --> 05:00.420
called magazine and it's in there

05:00.420 --> 05:01.560
uh... so

05:01.560 --> 05:04.980
i didn't know it was out yet but i'll pick that one up instead of there you

05:04.980 --> 05:06.300
go

05:06.300 --> 05:09.500
orange launch radio helping you find what you need exactly

05:09.500 --> 05:10.620
or anything else

05:10.620 --> 05:14.100
uh... that's about it i think

05:14.100 --> 05:16.460
well now i'll do my gaming week and we'll go to andrew

05:16.460 --> 05:20.300
uh... my gaming week you know just a lot of the same you know world of warcraft

05:20.300 --> 05:22.140
and uh... couple games of frogger here and there

05:22.140 --> 05:26.720
But one new thing I did check out is that I heard through the grapevine that GameTap

05:26.720 --> 05:28.280
went through some pretty major upgrades.

05:28.280 --> 05:34.380
The GameTap service rehab is basically paying for emulation in a way, but we had one of

05:34.380 --> 05:39.220
the folks on the board over there at GameTap, one of the vice presidents, a few episodes

05:39.220 --> 05:43.140
ago talking about some of the new things that were going to be coming to GameTap.

05:43.140 --> 05:46.480
One thing he would never give a clear answer on, but we said, GameTap needs this, GameTap

05:46.480 --> 05:48.140
needs this, was multiplayer.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.500
And sure enough, guess what GameTap upgraded to recently?

05:50.500 --> 05:54.940
They have some limited multiplayer stuff in there now.

05:54.940 --> 06:00.460
It's a little bit new, it's not perfect yet, it's not supported on all games, it's supported

06:00.460 --> 06:04.300
on about 15, and some of the games they picked are really random.

06:04.300 --> 06:08.580
You can kind of tell that they're sort of testing this right now because a lot of the

06:08.580 --> 06:12.540
games are not two-player simultaneous games.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.820
They're games like Pac-Man, which is one of the most popular multiplayer games on there

06:15.820 --> 06:16.820
right now is Pac-Man.

06:16.820 --> 06:21.820
You know, the way multiplayer Pac-Man works is like, I play, then you play, then I play, you know, it kind of trades off.

06:21.820 --> 06:29.820
But they do have some same-time multiplayer games on there right now, like Joust, and I played some Joust against somebody.

06:29.820 --> 06:37.820
And so that's pretty exciting because that means that, you know, this is probably the first step in the direction of Street Fighter II,

06:37.820 --> 06:42.820
other popular two-player arcade games, you know, in the future.

06:42.820 --> 06:47.620
My only complaint about the whole thing is that it was really weird setup like it was it took a minute for me to figure

06:47.620 --> 06:49.380
out okay, what's the difference between

06:49.380 --> 06:55.620
Being an orange name and clicking on instant match and being you know, it wasn't really explained very well

06:55.620 --> 07:01.340
But it's new and I figure after they get some of the bugs worked out because there is some lag issues

07:01.340 --> 07:06.540
But it's not as bad as I would have thought and actually I had a smoother game of joust on game tap than I did

07:06.540 --> 07:10.380
On Xbox Live, maybe that's because you don't have voice going through there at the same time

07:10.380 --> 07:12.720
I don't know, but I had a really smooth game of joust with somebody

07:13.600 --> 07:17.280
But it's just but it's a start. You know what I mean?

07:17.280 --> 07:22.440
This is a really exciting upgrade because it means that game tap has that technology and is likely to move forward

07:22.480 --> 07:24.680
You know with this and adding more games, you know

07:24.680 --> 07:29.400
They're gonna want stuff like Street Fighter 2 puzzle fighter and some of the other great, you know, two-player games

07:29.400 --> 07:31.840
They have on there. Oh, I wish they do magic sword. That would be awesome

07:31.840 --> 07:37.040
They just added like Mega Man power battle one and two and hopeful. Hopefully those will be multiplayer in the future

07:37.040 --> 07:39.480
You know, I'd be pretty awesome. So it's very exciting

07:39.480 --> 07:44.480
I think GameTap needed something like that to justify why you should pay for it.

07:44.480 --> 07:49.520
I mean, I already liked it as it is because they work with the gaming companies to make

07:49.520 --> 07:55.840
sure that the games run smoothly and accurately like the originals and, you know, it's the

07:55.840 --> 07:57.920
whole good karma thing.

07:57.920 --> 08:02.880
But it's nice now that they are starting to get more and more away from, hey, I'm just

08:02.880 --> 08:06.840
paying for emulation, but I'm getting a lot of extra crap that's pretty cool.

08:06.840 --> 08:10.480
So now they have AOL, Instant Messenger built in, all this other stuff I think is really

08:10.480 --> 08:11.480
cool.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.560
So I like the direction GameTap is going.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.920
The weird thing is though, I don't hear of a lot of people that are subscribed to them.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.920
I don't know anyone else who subscribes but me.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.000
I mean I run into people obviously on their multiplayer.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.880
I hope that's not a bad sign.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.420
I hope their business is doing well, but I think things like this will help.

08:28.420 --> 08:32.120
And I think if they ever are able to get it working on Macs, that's going to be a huge

08:32.120 --> 08:33.120
help too.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.120
It'll be a huge, huge help.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.740
So anyway, that was pretty much my gaming week.

08:36.740 --> 08:40.660
And I do rec- you know, I've talked a lot of positive things about it, but I really

08:40.660 --> 08:42.140
do recommend it and I enjoy it.

08:42.140 --> 08:43.140
What, Logie?

08:43.140 --> 08:46.500
Yeah, like, cause if they got that working on Macs, that would, you know, multiply the

08:46.500 --> 08:50.060
amount of games that Mac can play by like a hundred.

08:50.060 --> 08:51.060
It would!

08:51.060 --> 08:52.060
It actually would!

08:52.060 --> 08:53.060
It'd be pretty cool!

08:53.060 --> 08:57.800
No, seriously, though, you know, you give Macs a hard time, but, okay, obviously one

08:57.800 --> 09:01.260
of the things that people always say is you can't really play as many games on a Mac,

09:01.260 --> 09:05.620
so having GameTab would be a pretty cool little upgrade, so, it really would.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.620
Alright Andrew, how was your gaming week?

09:07.620 --> 09:09.620
Not bad, I was getting in some

09:11.620 --> 09:13.620
some World of Warcraft on the test servers

09:13.620 --> 09:15.620
testing out the new Rogue Talent Review

09:15.620 --> 09:17.620
pretty impressed by that

09:17.620 --> 09:21.620
also took the time to finish up Tales of Legendia

09:21.620 --> 09:23.620
an English program, still pissed off that

09:23.620 --> 09:25.620
they never took the time to

09:25.620 --> 09:29.620
do voice acting for the second half of the game

09:29.620 --> 09:31.620
good game there Namco

09:31.620 --> 09:33.620
also starting to get into

09:33.620 --> 09:38.220
Wild Arms 3, which is a pretty decent RPG, recommended.

09:38.220 --> 09:42.380
That's about all that I've done this week.

09:42.380 --> 09:47.340
We have some folks in our chat room over at www.orangelaungerator.com, click on chat talking

09:47.340 --> 09:51.900
about the whole GameTap thing, talking about it there.

09:51.900 --> 09:56.200
Some love there for Joust, two player simultaneous there from VX JasonXV.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.860
Yuri Lover wants to know when GameTap's going to get multiplayer Ridge Racer.

10:00.860 --> 10:01.860
Something tells me that.

10:01.860 --> 10:02.860
Well, they do have other...

10:02.860 --> 10:08.100
They do have I know that joke is kind of like really old now, but they do have other Namco games on there

10:08.100 --> 10:12.900
But I don't know if that would really work. They don't like PlayStation is not one of the systems. They emulate right now

10:12.900 --> 10:17.640
They have dreamcast as I don't know. Maybe you're emulating dreamcast. Why not emulate Soul Calibur?

10:17.640 --> 10:20.700
I my god, would that not be my god

10:20.700 --> 10:24.940
Do you know how many freaking game tab subscriptions that would sell right there, but I don't know

10:24.940 --> 10:27.020
Maybe it's just too much of a pain in the ass. Who knows?

10:27.740 --> 10:29.980
Like I said, I'm hoping it's the start of something good

10:29.980 --> 10:35.040
and then they're talking about a little bit about looks like Xbox Live vs. Game

10:35.040 --> 10:39.500
Tap. VidPala says so Game Tap is like Xbox Live Arcade now but then RSF says

10:39.500 --> 10:43.060
Game Tap and Xbox Live Arcade are different business models which is true.

10:43.060 --> 10:47.620
Game Tap doesn't have achievements either and it doesn't have voice chat but at

10:47.620 --> 10:54.180
the same time you pay one flat fee for access to 500 some odd games whereas

10:54.180 --> 10:58.540
Xbox Live Arcade you're paying $5-$10 a game so it's just a different business

10:58.540 --> 11:02.200
model it depends whatever you like so I think that's probably the direction game

11:02.200 --> 11:07.180
tab is going in but that's not really a big surprise because you know xbox live

11:07.180 --> 11:10.560
is successful who wouldn't want a little piece of that business I don't know

11:10.560 --> 11:16.480
jaded2006 agrees that SoulCalibur would be awesome

11:16.480 --> 11:21.820
there you go alright we're gonna go and get into some news now some gaming news

11:21.820 --> 11:26.760
so Loki why don't you start us off tonight yes and what a perfect way to start us off by

11:26.760 --> 11:31.320
talking about the PSP and how there's going to be yet another firmware upgrade and this

11:31.320 --> 11:36.720
one's going to be 2.8 it's going to add video RSS feeds so you can download those wonderful

11:36.720 --> 11:42.940
video podcasts out there as well as a bunch of other fun stuff probably security things

11:42.940 --> 11:48.480
to prevent you from running homebrew and all that wonderful stuff.

11:48.480 --> 11:52.880
This was also coming from Comic Con 2006 which they're kind of displaying some of the stuff

11:52.880 --> 11:58.540
right now. Some of the other things that are actually happening, they were showing off

11:58.540 --> 12:01.720
some of their brand new Sony Connect stuff where they're going to try to get it where

12:01.720 --> 12:08.000
you can download movies to your PSP's memory stick there.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.640
Seeing as they won't be selling UMD's much longer, it makes sense.

12:10.640 --> 12:16.260
Well, you know, they were saying that there's 350 UMD movies out there and they're making

12:16.260 --> 12:17.260
more so...

12:17.260 --> 12:20.760
I think downloadable movies is a smart move right now.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.420
They're going to do it, I mean...

12:22.420 --> 12:27.300
not so I I don't think I will use it that much but you never know you know

12:27.300 --> 12:32.280
before I travel a lot as you guys been listening to the show a while no you

12:32.280 --> 12:35.620
might be kind of tempting to download a movie before I go on the plane next time

12:35.620 --> 12:39.580
I don't know and one of the other things on that's coming with that firmware

12:39.580 --> 12:45.500
update as well is they're going to be including a demo world tour soccer too

12:45.500 --> 12:50.620
which I mean I guess if you're you know excited about that that makes the grand

12:50.620 --> 12:55.860
total of demos that they put out so far to a whopping two or three I mean that's

12:55.860 --> 13:00.260
pretty pathetic I mean I would think you would want to put tons of demos out

13:00.260 --> 13:04.420
there so that they buy your games I do think Sony is making a bit of a mistake

13:04.420 --> 13:09.140
with that but I don't know I mean maybe it's yeah you look at Xbox 360

13:09.140 --> 13:15.020
marketplace and so so many demos some good good news though video out is

13:15.020 --> 13:18.060
something that they're working on right now one thing they aren't working on

13:18.060 --> 13:22.740
though is improving the text entry system on there and no plans for first

13:22.740 --> 13:28.620
party keyboard so yeah that sucks so all this was announced at comic-con right

13:28.620 --> 13:32.140
yeah so what was Sony doing there because it's well comic cons become

13:32.140 --> 13:36.180
like almost like it's become like a nerd con hasn't it exactly it's less less of

13:36.180 --> 13:40.140
comics and more of here's what's coming out movies here's what's coming out

13:40.140 --> 13:44.020
comics here's just coming out toys well but games but but in a way doesn't

13:44.020 --> 13:47.740
comics kind of tie into all that like comics ties into movies you know a lot

13:47.740 --> 13:51.080
of the big grossing movies lately have been you know comic book based like what

13:51.080 --> 13:54.500
Batman Begins was an awesome movie yeah and then you know same thing with games

13:54.500 --> 13:57.980
a lot of games based off comic book franchises as well usually because of

13:57.980 --> 14:02.020
the movies but you know well exactly but it's just it's become a huge nerd fest

14:02.020 --> 14:05.320
so oh that's kind of neat yeah it's funny cuz I was telling my friend the

14:05.320 --> 14:08.180
other day I want to go to comic-con he's like why you don't read comic books I'm

14:08.180 --> 14:16.180
like well but there's cool stuff exactly so yeah that's something look forward to

14:16.180 --> 14:29.180
However though, just for people that aren't in the know, if you are worried that upgrading your PSP is going to possibly ruin your chances for running homebrew stuff,

14:29.180 --> 14:38.180
fear not, because there are plenty of things out there to help you with that, including this wonderful program called DevHook, which is out right now.

14:38.180 --> 14:47.580
They're on version 0.45 and now that you can actually fully emulate the 2.71 firmware and

14:47.580 --> 14:52.740
basically run it with all the functionality of 2.71 as well as homebrew stuff.

14:52.740 --> 14:56.620
And they're also using this to load on custom firmwares as well.

14:56.620 --> 15:02.300
And that on top of the mod chip that's coming out for it, I mean, how much longer are these

15:02.300 --> 15:04.640
firmware updates really going to be a problem?

15:04.640 --> 15:07.120
So, I don't know, it's something interesting.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.120
Hmm.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.120
Alright.

15:09.120 --> 15:12.680
I'll be interested in a new upgrade, especially for the movie thing.

15:12.680 --> 15:16.440
I might have to buy one movie online just to see what it's like.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.200
Just to review it for you guys here on Orange Launch Radio.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.200
We'll see.

15:19.200 --> 15:24.800
Well, if I remember correctly, if I read correctly on this, at least this is the case with those,

15:24.800 --> 15:29.520
how we talked about last week, how they're including a 1GB memory stick and you have

15:29.520 --> 15:33.680
four movies that you can download to that.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.440
the movies aren't full screen, which is really lame.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.760
They're that 320 by whatever on the PSP.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.760
A normal TV ratio.

15:40.760 --> 15:41.760
Yeah, exactly.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.760
That is a little bit of a bummer.

15:42.760 --> 15:43.760
It's really lame.

15:43.760 --> 15:44.760
So, whatever.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.760
Not cool.

15:45.760 --> 15:46.760
We'll see.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.960
Well, anyway, speaking of movies, of course, last week on the show we talked about how

15:48.960 --> 15:51.480
Target had gotten rid of UMDs from their shelves.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.440
We're in the process of phasing that out.

15:53.440 --> 15:58.120
Well, recently, United Press International spoke to the senior VP of marketing at Sony

15:58.120 --> 15:59.340
Computer Entertainment.

15:59.340 --> 16:01.080
His name is Peter Dial.

16:01.080 --> 16:07.920
This is what he said basically about all this negative press it basically comes down to too many releases hmm

16:07.920 --> 16:13.040
here's a quote we have seen studios cut back on releasing their full content on UMD as

16:13.440 --> 16:16.660
Unlike the DVD market the PSP consumer is targeted

16:16.660 --> 16:23.440
We are committed to helping the studios better understand our product and our consumer and will continue to educate them as we evolve and enhance

16:23.440 --> 16:25.440
the functionality of the PSP

16:25.440 --> 16:30.160
So basically it just kinda sounds like that

16:30.160 --> 16:33.320
they're not saying they're done yet but

16:33.320 --> 16:38.260
I don't know. Well I also think it comes down to a space issue too because those

16:38.260 --> 16:40.480
UMDs can't hold a whole lot and to fit

16:40.480 --> 16:44.240
you know more content on top of that it's

16:44.240 --> 16:47.900
tough it's just you can't really fit it that and also they're not making a lot

16:47.900 --> 16:48.840
of money on UMDs

16:48.840 --> 16:52.880
so why bother you know putting exclusive content on there in the first place why

16:52.880 --> 16:57.080
why even bother it's interesting though that the guy reference the whole

16:57.080 --> 17:00.800
you know fact that the PSP is targeted market is we're kinda saying that when

17:00.800 --> 17:03.680
the PSP first came out you saw the list at the launch movies

17:03.680 --> 17:07.840
they were coming out for the PSP it was kinda like while you have a lot of very

17:07.840 --> 17:11.000
you know teenage boy movies coming on PSP but that

17:11.000 --> 17:15.160
I guess is the target market you're not exactly gonna sell a bunch of UMD's

17:15.160 --> 17:19.240
of steel magnolias you know on PSP I would totally buy that movie

17:19.240 --> 17:22.800
me too but you know we'd be the only two actually I wouldn't buy that movie

17:22.800 --> 17:26.880
okay then I'd be the only one. You'd be the only one. Just to say I owned it.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.680
I'm actually not really you know that huge on that movie but just to say I own it.

17:30.680 --> 17:34.360
I was excited about Death Race 2000 on UMD that is

17:34.360 --> 17:38.440
fucking awesome. See that movie is very targeted and the fact that the

17:38.440 --> 17:40.440
remake is even more awesome it's

17:40.440 --> 17:43.880
I'm there when that movie comes out I'm there I don't care how

17:43.880 --> 17:48.880
fuck snakes on a train you know plane even fuck the knockoff snakes on a train

17:48.880 --> 17:50.560
which is coming out by the way

17:50.560 --> 17:55.280
um that's fantastic but Death Race 3000 is where it's all at

17:55.280 --> 17:59.760
Jeremy Todd 1 has a very interesting uh point here well they have two disc DVD

17:59.760 --> 18:00.280
movies

18:00.280 --> 18:05.040
why not two disc UMD movies and they have the cases for two disc UMD movies

18:05.040 --> 18:07.760
too I know that's true those cases are huge you can fit

18:07.760 --> 18:11.440
you can probably fit four UMDs in there if you tried maybe not that many with a

18:11.440 --> 18:12.600
little folding thingy

18:12.600 --> 18:16.640
well yeah you don't need that many for a movie but you could well remember what

18:16.640 --> 18:17.920
was it there was um

18:17.920 --> 18:20.380
I think they did this with Advent Children, even,

18:20.380 --> 18:24.200
where they had the soundtrack was available on there.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.920
Like, you know, you can watch the movie,

18:25.920 --> 18:28.900
then you can also access soundtrack stuff on there.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.320
Like, you can download music tracks or something.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.200
I thought that was kind of neat.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.800
That's what they should be doing.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.400
Now, of course, someone in our chat room

18:36.400 --> 18:40.040
had to bring up Snakes on a Plane for UMD, I guess,

18:40.040 --> 18:42.200
campaigning to get that released on UMD.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.200
So you could actually watch it in a plane,

18:44.200 --> 18:45.340
because you know they're not going to show that

18:45.340 --> 18:46.880
as the in-flight movie.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.360
That'd be funny, though.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.320
That would be actually pretty funny.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.520
I would fly on an airline that showed that as the in-flight movie.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.320
What about, like, movies like Red Eye and stuff?

18:53.320 --> 18:55.640
I bet Southwest would do something like that.

18:55.640 --> 18:56.600
Because they're just sort of...

18:56.600 --> 18:57.880
Southwest is too...

18:57.880 --> 18:59.800
Southwest is too poor to show movies.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.920
I know, but if they did show a movie...

19:01.920 --> 19:03.760
Fly the Ghetto Skies.

19:03.760 --> 19:07.280
But no, if they did show a movie, I bet that'd be one that they would, like, put up right away.

19:07.280 --> 19:11.400
Because, oh my, they have some snarky people doing their little...

19:11.400 --> 19:16.320
Okay, if the plane starts to go down, this probably won't matter because you'll be dead anyway.

19:16.320 --> 19:20.960
I can't remember who is putting out snakes on a plane, but

19:21.640 --> 19:27.860
Can you imagine what like the motion picture? You know how they always create a stupid theme to ride based on it?

19:27.860 --> 19:30.720
We're gonna have the snakes on a plane roller coaster at some point

19:31.560 --> 19:33.260
It's awful

19:33.260 --> 19:35.260
moving on back to games

19:35.920 --> 19:37.920
Who needs them? Oh

19:38.640 --> 19:41.720
Actually, we do. Yeah, I'd miss my games too much

19:41.720 --> 19:48.140
I love games very much, but in any race speaking of the game that I've been stuck on for a little bit

19:48.620 --> 19:50.620
world of Warcraft

19:51.380 --> 19:53.940
Well, you know how you've got shamans for

19:54.580 --> 20:01.320
You know horn and paladins on alliance. Well now they're gonna be nothing will ever change to upset that balance of the force, right?

20:02.940 --> 20:04.940
Bullshit no

20:05.940 --> 20:08.620
They actually are now having

20:08.620 --> 20:14.380
Using Alliance Shamans and Horde Paladins, the new races are going to be pulling them

20:14.380 --> 20:18.400
in with the whole upgrade for Burning Crusade.

20:18.400 --> 20:23.420
There's going to be Blood Elf Paladins, there's going to be, I know I'm going to mispronounce

20:23.420 --> 20:24.420
it, Draenai.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.420
Draeno.

20:25.420 --> 20:26.420
Draeno.

20:26.420 --> 20:27.420
Draeno.

20:27.420 --> 20:28.420
Draeno Shamans.

20:28.420 --> 20:32.100
Their faces look like something you'd want to use Draeno on, actually.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.660
They use the power of unclogging.

20:34.660 --> 20:38.540
You know why those particular races were picked, right?

20:38.540 --> 20:42.060
And I know Andrew is going to have to comment on this, he's the biggest wowhorn in the robot,

20:42.060 --> 20:46.660
let me just get this out, okay, you had to have blood elves on the horde side because

20:46.660 --> 20:51.540
the horde needed a pretty character, because everybody on the horde side is ugly, and you

20:51.540 --> 20:58.580
needed the draenei people on the alliance side because the alliance needed uglies.

20:58.580 --> 20:59.860
The alliance already has uglies.

20:59.860 --> 21:08.300
I understand, but you know, it's just, you know what the fish face draenei remind me

21:08.300 --> 21:14.540
of what that like kiko man like music video thing where they've got the fish face you know creature

21:15.500 --> 21:23.660
not to remind me of sorry did you have more story i'm sorry yes but um if you want to know some of

21:23.660 --> 21:28.140
the the word behind that there's actually a post on the world of warcraft forums where they're

21:28.140 --> 21:34.140
giving the the background to the decision for doing all that and apparently there's a forum

21:34.140 --> 21:39.860
shitstorm about it, but just talking about how A, it butchers a balance, A, it makes

21:39.860 --> 21:41.300
things more balanced.

21:41.300 --> 21:46.900
They are actually giving certain abilities for each class, though, that are class-specific.

21:46.900 --> 21:50.840
And B, they say it's butchering lore, and it's kind of funny how most of the people

21:50.840 --> 21:54.780
on the forums wouldn't give a damn about lore anyway if it beat them upside the head.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.460
Would you call yourself earlier to be a lore-whore?

21:56.460 --> 21:57.460
I'm a lore-whore.

21:57.460 --> 22:02.980
Okay, so as the wow-whore lore-whore, the only one in this room with a level 60, what

22:02.980 --> 22:04.940
What do you personally feel about this whole change?

22:04.940 --> 22:09.820
I think we're going to have to wait and see, story-wise, how Metzen decides to right his

22:09.820 --> 22:13.820
way into and out of this one, see if it makes sense.

22:13.820 --> 22:16.340
Balance-wise though, I think it's a good change.

22:16.340 --> 22:20.420
Horde has been complaining how Shamans have been really underpowered for PvE content,

22:20.420 --> 22:25.580
raid content, how all they get to do is heal and lay down totems and don't get any kind

22:25.580 --> 22:28.700
of buffs like, say, Blessings, like Paladins do.

22:28.700 --> 22:33.120
And Alliance has been whining that, oh, we don't have the PvP strength because we don't

22:33.120 --> 22:34.120
have shamans.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.120
Guess what?

22:35.120 --> 22:37.560
Now you're going to have shamans and now you're going to have paladins.

22:37.560 --> 22:39.040
Best of both worlds.

22:39.040 --> 22:44.920
And you know, the thing is, when that expansion first hits, the servers are going to be inundated

22:44.920 --> 22:48.560
with blood elf paladins and dranny, dranny, whatever.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.800
That should be the quit your bitching update.

22:50.800 --> 22:54.040
Blizzard does a lot of those, actually.

22:54.040 --> 22:58.280
I really have two minds about that though, but I'm hoping it'll be a good thing.

22:58.280 --> 23:04.000
I mean, I'll probably play a Blood Elf Paladin, you know, just to do, say I've done it.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.480
It's making me seriously reconsider making a Blood Elf Priest and changing him to a Paladin.

23:09.480 --> 23:12.300
I think everybody is thinking in the back of their mind, depending on whether they play

23:12.300 --> 23:16.280
more Horde or more Alliance, which kind of character, I think most of us are Horde players,

23:16.280 --> 23:18.560
you know, kind of thinking in the back of our mind what we're going to make our Blood

23:18.560 --> 23:19.560
Elf.

23:19.560 --> 23:22.760
Like, everybody is going to make one of these new ones, it's just interesting to me.

23:22.760 --> 23:28.560
I've already got it set from the start, but I don't want to be a squishy healer.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.560
Not on a PVP server, that's what I found out.

23:30.560 --> 23:33.920
Being a priest on a PVP server is like asking for a beating.

23:33.920 --> 23:38.880
Unless you have a death wish or your, for instance, specced shadow.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.740
Adult faces.

23:41.740 --> 23:43.360
So when's Burning Crusade coming out?

23:43.360 --> 23:44.360
Pretty soon, right?

23:44.360 --> 23:49.400
Estimate release date of October, but it'll probably be closer to December.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.840
Awesome.

23:50.840 --> 23:56.240
Now, Final Fantasy XI, we can't have a WoW story without talking about the other MMO

23:56.240 --> 23:58.040
that a lot of us have played on and off.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.040
Who gives a crap?

23:59.040 --> 24:03.520
I know, I'm a little done with Final Fantasy XI, but this was exciting news, they announced

24:03.520 --> 24:07.960
earlier this week that there was a sequel being made to Final Fantasy XI, and that news

24:07.960 --> 24:14.680
came out about six or seven days ago, and then a few days later, no, unfortunately,

24:14.680 --> 24:18.360
it looks like Squeenix put out a little statement.

24:18.360 --> 24:22.920
As the company announced in May 2005, it is currently developing an online title for next-gen

24:22.920 --> 24:25.440
platforms, including game consoles and PCs.

24:25.440 --> 24:30.200
However, this title is being developed as a completely new MMORPG.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.760
We will disclose further details of this title, including which platform it is going to be

24:33.760 --> 24:37.060
on immediately after any relevant decisions are made.

24:37.060 --> 24:41.740
But they didn't exactly say, we're not doing Final Fantasy XI II.

24:41.740 --> 24:44.620
They're just saying, we're not going to tell you either way.

24:44.620 --> 24:47.300
Final Fantasy XIII, another title!

24:47.300 --> 24:50.640
Will it involve dress-up just like that other direct sequel?

24:50.640 --> 24:52.260
No, seriously, I think it's going to be...

24:52.260 --> 24:53.260
The dress-up was great!

24:53.260 --> 24:56.660
Okay, it was a little too Charlie's Angels, though.

24:56.660 --> 24:57.740
That was what made it great.

24:57.740 --> 25:00.420
It was like the ultimate girl Final Fantasy.

25:00.420 --> 25:03.660
Legend of Zaku in our chat room seems to think it's Front Mission Online that they're talking

25:03.660 --> 25:04.660
about.

25:04.660 --> 25:05.660
That would be awesome.

25:05.660 --> 25:06.660
Personally, I think it's going to be Fantasy Earth Online.

25:06.660 --> 25:11.140
They had run a couple articles about it last year, how the Enix part of Square Enix was

25:11.140 --> 25:13.140
going to do Fantasy Earth.

25:13.140 --> 25:15.300
Raven's Dolphin in chat has an interesting perspective.

25:15.300 --> 25:19.540
Maybe it's not Final Fantasy XI Part II, he says Final Fantasy XIV the MMO.

25:19.540 --> 25:20.540
Maybe?

25:20.540 --> 25:21.540
God forbid.

25:21.540 --> 25:22.540
Maybe?

25:22.540 --> 25:25.060
They need to do one called Final Fantasy The End of Things.

25:25.060 --> 25:30.140
They said what it was in like E3 2005 and there was a whole bunch of stuff that was

25:30.140 --> 25:33.820
coming out E3 2005 that wasn't there for 2006.

25:33.820 --> 25:39.620
Like I want to say it was fantasy or it was another MMO not of Final Fantasy or just...

25:39.620 --> 25:43.540
Well remember how everybody thought World of Mana was a game and everybody like creamed

25:43.540 --> 25:46.700
their pants because it's like, you know, oh my god, Secret of Mana Online, how awesome

25:46.700 --> 25:47.700
would that be?

25:47.700 --> 25:51.580
And then they were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, World of Mana is like all these

25:51.580 --> 25:55.540
new Mana games where it's a marketing thing, not an actual game.

25:55.540 --> 26:00.580
Well, it'll be cool, no matter what it is, I don't know.

26:00.580 --> 26:04.500
Well, one other thing I just want to mention real quick, Final Fantasy XI is not without

26:04.500 --> 26:05.940
any love or upgrades.

26:05.940 --> 26:09.900
If you're playing the Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy XI, you may have noticed that

26:09.900 --> 26:13.800
You don't get any achievement points for all those hours upon hours that you pour into

26:13.800 --> 26:14.800
the game.

26:14.800 --> 26:19.940
Well, it looks like Final Fantasy XI will be getting 32 achievements on Xbox.

26:19.940 --> 26:22.040
This is thanks to Xbox.com.

26:22.040 --> 26:26.100
They're all secret achievements right now, so we don't even know what they are.

26:26.100 --> 26:31.340
But if it's 32 achievements, that would be about 30 to 40 points apiece.

26:31.340 --> 26:36.040
The rumor is that with the next Final Fantasy XI patch, you will now be able to get achievements.

26:36.040 --> 26:39.520
My question is, since I'm a dummy and I haven't canceled my account over there yet and I'm

26:39.520 --> 26:42.120
still paying for it could I just log in with my character and since he's a

26:42.120 --> 26:44.400
certain level and done stuff already what am I gonna unlock all these

26:44.400 --> 26:48.640
achievements I mean that those are what the achievements are for yeah I don't

26:48.640 --> 26:52.320
know who knows it could it could be they could be right relations you bought a

26:52.320 --> 26:56.680
new expansion times 32 it could it could be interesting because they could be

26:56.680 --> 26:59.920
you're right they could be things relevant to chocobo racing or things

26:59.920 --> 27:03.360
that are going to be the new things that they put in father's 11 the achievements

27:03.360 --> 27:06.080
may not even have anything to do with the rest of the game are you just stuff

27:06.080 --> 27:12.160
like winning a game of Ballista possibly oh something that like you know you can

27:12.160 --> 27:17.560
do over and over again yeah hmm well we shall soon see when the next patch goes

27:17.560 --> 27:27.680
out to Final Fantasy 11 excellent anyways another news here speaking of

27:27.680 --> 27:32.460
Xbox Live you know how they're doing this Xbox Live Wednesday's thing where

27:32.460 --> 27:37.440
they're releasing brand new games coming out every Wednesday. In fact, next week we are

27:37.440 --> 27:43.560
getting Galaga, which is awesome. And of course after that Street Fighter 2 and after that

27:43.560 --> 27:48.440
Pac-Man. But there are going to be about 50 live arcade games by the end of the year,

27:48.440 --> 27:57.440
which is great. And this is coming from Major Nelson. And basically, that's a lot of games.

27:57.440 --> 28:01.720
And I know they were showing some new ones actually at Comic-Con, including I believe

28:01.720 --> 28:04.440
as Castle Crashers, which looks fucking awesome.

28:04.440 --> 28:08.960
Oh, is that the one that looked like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game style game?

28:08.960 --> 28:09.960
That is rad.

28:09.960 --> 28:10.960
I love those type of games.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.720
We haven't had a good one like that in a long time.

28:13.720 --> 28:19.360
And it's done by the same people that did Alien Hominid, which is also coming to Live

28:19.360 --> 28:20.360
Arcade.

28:20.360 --> 28:24.200
Knights of the Round, Golden Axe, all those games sound awesome.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.920
Yeah, it's going to be pretty awesome.

28:25.920 --> 28:30.880
I know what was it, Contra and stuff were going to be coming out as well, Contra and

28:30.880 --> 28:32.320
Super Contra.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.240
Just all this, Luminous Live of course.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.120
So lots of good games to look up before the end of the year.

28:37.120 --> 28:41.160
So at least they're going to be supporting Live Arcade for a while.

28:41.160 --> 28:44.840
Alrighty.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.760
One other thing that's going to be coming to Xbox Live pretty soon is a table tennis

28:48.760 --> 28:49.760
demo.

28:49.760 --> 28:55.760
Rockstar Games confirmed that a table tennis demo is on the way and this was through May

28:55.760 --> 29:01.120
Major Nelson blogged, I happened to be down talking to the folks that work with Rockstar

29:01.120 --> 29:05.120
and they told me it would be okay for me to mention that there is a demo on its way to

29:05.120 --> 29:07.000
the marketplace for table tennis.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.440
I also found out that the demo is single and two player but not live play.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.440
Live play is kind of, you know, if you gave them everything, I don't know if there would

29:15.440 --> 29:19.080
be much point to buying the game despite the fact that there are additional characters

29:19.080 --> 29:20.320
and arenas and things like that.

29:20.320 --> 29:23.220
But this will be good, you know, folks wanting to find out if they want to spend the money

29:23.220 --> 29:26.540
on the game or not, even though it is, you know, next-gen budget priced.

29:26.540 --> 29:31.220
Excellent, and speaking of stuff, coming in live, I think I mentioned last week, Texas

29:31.220 --> 29:34.660
Hold'em, they announced it was going to be free, actually that's not the case.

29:34.660 --> 29:38.540
It ends up being that they haven't decided on a price point yet, but it's definitely

29:38.540 --> 29:40.180
not going to be free.

29:40.180 --> 29:46.940
So unfortunately, you know, probably, you know, decent price, but no handouts this time,

29:46.940 --> 29:47.940
unfortunately.

29:47.940 --> 29:50.740
Well, and that was something we reported on last week, right?

29:50.740 --> 29:51.860
Yes, it was.

29:51.860 --> 29:53.740
it was going to be free.

29:53.740 --> 29:57.980
That was originally the announcement, but apparently not.

29:57.980 --> 29:58.980
Apparently they found out, hey, you know what?

29:58.980 --> 30:01.900
We can make money off this, so let's do that.

30:01.900 --> 30:08.280
All right, well, Microsoft is seeing some pretty good Xbox 360 sales.

30:08.280 --> 30:13.340
Microsoft reported that the earnings for its fourth quarter, which ended June 30, 2006,

30:13.340 --> 30:20.900
because it's a fiscal year, they got $2.3 billion in profits on revenue of $11.8 billion.

30:20.900 --> 30:28.700
Its server and tools division was the fastest growing sector, having $3.18 billion of quarterly

30:28.700 --> 30:29.700
income.

30:29.700 --> 30:36.460
When you get to Xbox revenue, this would be Xbox and Xbox 360, this increased about $503

30:36.460 --> 30:41.980
million or 129%, of course that being attributed to Xbox 360.

30:41.980 --> 30:48.820
The home and entertainment division, unfortunately for them, had an operating loss of $414 million

30:48.820 --> 30:53.060
for the quarter and they're saying that the biggest reason for this is because

30:53.060 --> 30:59.980
they lose money on each Xbox 360 sold so kind of some interesting profits and

30:59.980 --> 31:03.300
stuff from Microsoft if you like to follow that or if your own stock in

31:03.300 --> 31:07.300
Microsoft, I bet you really want to know about that information.

31:07.300 --> 31:11.320
...

31:11.320 --> 31:15.340
...

31:15.340 --> 31:19.360
...

31:19.360 --> 31:23.380
...

31:23.380 --> 31:27.400
Just one moment folks, we're getting reorganized.

31:27.400 --> 31:31.420
There actually is another game coming out on Xbox 360.

31:31.420 --> 31:41.420
Actually, it's more in the realm of the unconfirmed rumor, but it's been stated that Guitar Hero

31:41.420 --> 31:43.580
is coming to the Xbox 360.

31:43.580 --> 31:50.180
Microsoft hasn't commented yet, but Red Octane is actually working on the PS2 sequel and

31:50.180 --> 31:53.540
a 360 version.

31:53.540 --> 31:56.380
So yeah, that's looked forward to.

31:56.380 --> 31:58.380
I'm sure that's something they're probably working on.

31:58.380 --> 32:03.460
I mean it makes sense, especially with live marketplace kind of set up for downloading

32:03.460 --> 32:06.500
songs and that kind of thing.

32:06.500 --> 32:09.380
I don't know, it's interesting.

32:09.380 --> 32:10.380
What would you think?

32:10.380 --> 32:14.220
Do you think that Guitar Hero would see a lot of its fan base moving over to Xbox with

32:14.220 --> 32:18.140
this or is this just a way for Guitar Hero to expand its fan base or what?

32:18.140 --> 32:19.140
Both?

32:19.140 --> 32:20.140
Why not?

32:20.140 --> 32:23.940
I mean do a version that's on the PlayStation 2 and then do another version that's on the

32:23.940 --> 32:28.260
Xbox 360 with the same kind of strategy as Dance Dance Revolution.

32:28.260 --> 32:34.340
You have games that are put out on the Xbox 360, on the Xbox, on Playstation 2, and they're

32:34.340 --> 32:36.620
usually different but the same at the same time.

32:36.620 --> 32:41.020
You've got the same type of gameplay but different features in each one.

32:41.020 --> 32:42.680
Online play.

32:42.680 --> 32:45.780
That would be a huge selling point for Xbox version, that's for sure.

32:45.780 --> 32:46.780
Definitely.

32:46.780 --> 32:51.620
Well, it's interesting because the story talks about Guitar Hero 2, but in DDR, yeah, the

32:51.620 --> 32:55.780
are similar but they're not really the same. UltraMix offers completely

32:55.780 --> 32:59.500
different types of features than you know the Xtreme and I'm assuming

32:59.500 --> 33:02.740
Supernova are you know going to be offering so it's kind of I don't know

33:02.740 --> 33:07.280
it's a little bit apples and oranges to me I think they could do I think it

33:07.280 --> 33:11.220
would just be you know different on Xbox or should be different. Definitely and

33:11.220 --> 33:16.480
including you know since we're talking about Guitar Hero here there was

33:16.480 --> 33:24.020
actually a MySpace blog post put out by the Guitar Hero team, and it was actually entitled

33:24.020 --> 33:31.120
Ghoul's Night Out, which teases a logo to possibly a brand new game with a skull and

33:31.120 --> 33:38.800
cross guitars with the title Ghoul, and Ghoul looks to be an acronym for something. It's

33:38.800 --> 33:43.960
interesting though, as no one really knows what exactly that means, people are suspecting

33:43.960 --> 33:48.520
maybe it's like a Guitar Hero online user league or something like that or some sort

33:48.520 --> 33:54.800
of, you know, some sort of online play or maybe even the Xbox 360 game, but of course

33:54.800 --> 33:59.400
right now nothing more than a logo, nothing more than speculations, so at least they're

33:59.400 --> 34:00.400
working on something.

34:00.400 --> 34:03.960
Just trying to get the fanboys talking, basically, and it's working.

34:03.960 --> 34:04.960
Look at us.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.360
Alright, well another very popular music game that actually got brought up just a second

34:08.360 --> 34:10.560
ago is Dance Dance Revolution.

34:10.560 --> 34:16.040
And Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix is coming out again, sort of.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.040
Here's the thing.

34:17.040 --> 34:21.040
Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix actually came out many years ago on the PlayStation

34:21.040 --> 34:22.040
1.

34:22.040 --> 34:26.080
It was only the second DDR game released here in the US on the console.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.340
What's interesting about that now is that the whole idea is being revisited and it's

34:29.340 --> 34:33.720
due to a partnership between Disney and Majesco Entertainment, because what they're doing

34:33.720 --> 34:37.280
with this now is it's going to be a plug-and-play version of the game.

34:37.280 --> 34:41.280
However, an early screenshot I saw floating around on the internet somewhere didn't look

34:41.280 --> 34:46.160
like the DDR mix on PS1, it looked like it had some upgrades to it, it had a more max

34:46.160 --> 34:50.680
kind of look to it, and it looked like it had stationary backgrounds, which for a plug

34:50.680 --> 34:54.760
and play device wouldn't be too surprising, you can't put a whole lot in those things.

34:54.760 --> 35:00.040
So it's very interesting, these plug and play dance pads, now Konami, you know, I've seen

35:00.040 --> 35:05.920
these before, I saw the crappy 8-bit Nintendo style dance pads at the mall before, but now

35:05.920 --> 35:11.520
Now Konami looks like they're gonna be endorsing these official ones and kind of a more kid

35:11.520 --> 35:14.080
audience going for the DDR Disney mix.

35:14.080 --> 35:20.360
Exactly, and speaking of wonderful plug and play DDR type things, Konami is putting out

35:20.360 --> 35:23.680
Strawberry Shortcake Dance Dance Revolution.

35:23.680 --> 35:29.120
Yes, you can play as Strawberry Shortcake and Dance Dance Revolution with the equally

35:29.120 --> 35:35.600
cheesy dance pad that looks like, I don't know, basically getting any 5 year old pre-teen

35:35.600 --> 35:42.480
girl super excited about jumping around to her favorite strawberry shortcake song, which

35:42.480 --> 35:46.680
to be honest, I didn't think there was that many strawberry shortcake songs out there.

35:46.680 --> 35:49.260
I didn't think there were that many either. I didn't even think strawberry shortcake was

35:49.260 --> 35:56.820
still popular. I mean, where's My Little Pony? My Little Pony's elegant too. I thought it

35:56.820 --> 36:01.160
would have been Bratz DDR if nothing else. Well, I remember those, and I don't remember

36:01.160 --> 36:05.960
whatever came of this but they were talking about a DDR TV show that was

36:05.960 --> 36:08.800
supposed to be on Saturday mornings or something right in between all these

36:08.800 --> 36:13.120
girly shows on I don't remember if it was ABC or what it's been so long that this was

36:13.120 --> 36:17.000
first announced like since E3 or something but it kind of seems like DDR

36:17.000 --> 36:21.160
is definitely going after the girly girls aren't they yeah which makes some

36:21.160 --> 36:27.560
of us guys go hmm hey if you're looking for something you know to give to your

36:27.560 --> 36:30.800
or a five-year-old kid or a sister or whatever.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.120
There you go, strawberry shortcake DDR.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.720
I don't mind it.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.200
I know it's tempting to roll my eyes at this

36:37.200 --> 36:38.680
and go, this is stupid.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.360
But you have to realize, this isn't for me.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.880
This isn't for the DDR hardcore.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.040
This is just to sell the DDR brand

36:44.040 --> 36:45.840
and get more people talking about DDR.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.560
Because look at the positives that could come from this.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.440
If more parents start playing DDR with their kids,

36:51.440 --> 36:53.960
then maybe the parents will want a DDR for themselves,

36:53.960 --> 36:54.640
so on and so on.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.300
I look at it in the same way that they

36:56.300 --> 36:59.300
the Yo-Ha style one in Japan, honestly. It's the same thing.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.100
Exactly. Oh, that's a good point.

37:01.100 --> 37:08.100
This features such wonderful songs like the theme music, Straw-ba-ba-ba-berry shortcake.

37:08.740 --> 37:15.740
So apparently, Strawberry Shortcake has a stutter. That's excellent. Straw-ba-ba-ba-ba-berry

37:15.740 --> 37:20.220
shortcake! Yeah! Whatever.

37:20.220 --> 37:24.220
Blaze Revolution says, I bought DDR Disney Mix for my sister and I played it for her.

37:24.220 --> 37:31.020
I actually got both of them, except I didn't get the Nintendo 64 one.

37:31.020 --> 37:34.780
You know, DDR Disney Mix did have something that was pretty revolutionary for DDR at the

37:34.780 --> 37:35.780
time.

37:35.780 --> 37:36.780
Dance Magic.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.140
Dance Magic is fabulous.

37:38.140 --> 37:40.860
That was the best part of the game.

37:40.860 --> 37:44.240
Honestly, for the hardcore DDR fans, that was the whole reason to own it.

37:44.240 --> 37:48.180
That and Electrical Parade, says VidPower, except Electrical Parade wasn't in the US

37:48.180 --> 37:49.180
version.

37:49.180 --> 37:50.180
Only in the Japanese one.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.340
You had to get Disney's Rave, the Japanese version.

37:52.340 --> 37:55.780
Johnny's Rave, though, did have a few better songs, I have to say.

37:55.780 --> 37:56.780
It had the Macarena.

37:56.780 --> 37:57.780
Eh?

37:57.780 --> 38:00.780
I remember you making me play that Milpitas.

38:00.780 --> 38:07.460
I was like, okay, Rob, pick me a song, Macarena, I hate you.

38:07.460 --> 38:09.100
And then Mr. Bassman.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.100
That song's awesome.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.300
It is, but it's, like, slow.

38:11.300 --> 38:17.420
I played Mr. Bassman a few weeks ago, and I nearly died because I was out of shape.

38:17.420 --> 38:21.140
Jeremy Todd 1 suggests DDR Pirates of the Caribbean, the game where you have to dance

38:21.140 --> 38:27.540
to dodge the skeletons. Hey, if DDR Disney does well, you can expect a whole bunch of

38:27.540 --> 38:32.460
freaking clones of it. That's when you do a jig and the stage moves like you're on a

38:32.460 --> 38:36.860
boat. Andrew, why are you making a face? You're about to swallow your bottom lip there. This

38:36.860 --> 38:43.860
is my sad panda face. Why though? Isn't exposure for the DDR brand a good thing for the fanbase?

38:45.060 --> 38:48.300
Not when it's freaking Disney. Leave it to Kingdom Hearts or something. What Kingdom

38:48.300 --> 39:01.020
DDR Kingdom Hearts Edition. Kingdom Hearts 3 has a DDR mode. Rewind. Rewind. I'm not

39:01.020 --> 39:05.680
understanding. How is DDR Kingdom Hearts any different from DDR Disney? Because Kingdom

39:05.680 --> 39:11.520
Hearts is Disney, you boob. No, I mean leave the dancing games out of Disney. Leave Disney

39:11.520 --> 39:18.280
out of dancing games. Swim This Way was bad enough. The whole part was bad enough. Unfortunately,

39:18.280 --> 39:21.660
it's not going to happen since there was a partnership between Konami and Buena Vista

39:21.660 --> 39:26.920
to put out a ton more games. So you're going to see a lot more of these before they go

39:26.920 --> 39:30.440
away. And they will never go away by the way.

39:30.440 --> 39:38.440
Hooray, hooray. Well, speaking of DDR Ohasta and things that just won't go away, every

39:38.440 --> 39:43.760
week here on this program we have Dark Sakura's website of the week segment because she serves

39:43.760 --> 39:48.240
the web up and down and left and right and back and forth inside and out, looking for

39:48.240 --> 39:50.720
sites that you need to be visiting right now.

39:50.720 --> 39:54.440
So DarkSakura, where should the kids be going in their browsers right now?

39:54.440 --> 40:01.520
A site that illustrates something that will never go away that's called Desperate Otaku.

40:01.520 --> 40:04.080
This one was brought to me by Rob.

40:04.080 --> 40:06.140
Thank you, Rob.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.720
I don't remember this being the site.

40:07.720 --> 40:08.720
You suggested it.

40:08.720 --> 40:10.480
I thought I suggested a different one, that's alright.

40:10.480 --> 40:17.040
I'm doing it out of pure just thinking that it's out of it's so desperate. I suggest it was world of datecraft

40:18.880 --> 40:22.800
Oh, it's a spin-off of the oh, okay Wow world of datecraft

40:24.760 --> 40:28.760
The website is wow date dot full wiki comm

40:29.840 --> 40:32.160
Yeah, it's a I'll spell it out

40:32.160 --> 40:39.480
W o w dat dot f u ll w ik i.com which I will not spell if you can't spell comm go back to school

40:39.480 --> 40:46.220
So, yeah, this site is a dating site for people on World of Warcraft.

40:46.220 --> 40:55.000
How to meet people who may or may not be of the gender they specify, or the age they specify.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.400
Is this a site for me to put up a personal ad for my WoW character, or a personal ad

41:00.400 --> 41:01.820
for me?

41:01.820 --> 41:09.460
Because I know my friend, the sick, sick woman she is, has a MySpace for her WoW character.

41:09.460 --> 41:16.260
This is apparently real profiles and you can put your pictures and there's also the couples

41:16.260 --> 41:17.260
on here too.

41:17.260 --> 41:19.900
I guess looking for other couples to experiment with.

41:19.900 --> 41:20.900
Excellent.

41:20.900 --> 41:25.780
World of Datecraft where everybody looks like the Horde.

41:25.780 --> 41:32.820
So you never know that that 18 year old woman from Cleveland might really be a 56 year old

41:32.820 --> 41:35.580
man from Albany, Georgia.

41:35.580 --> 41:36.580
Hey!

41:36.580 --> 41:37.580
Hey!

41:37.580 --> 41:46.500
stop. Woman. Alright, alright, alright. Confession, I do play a female orc warlock, okay? Exactly.

41:46.500 --> 41:50.660
I will never play a male character in any MMO ever again. I will always play female

41:50.660 --> 41:56.900
characters. You know why? Free stuff. True. Free stuff? It's sad and true. Even on the

41:56.900 --> 42:02.300
board, free stuff. All you people are making me very ill. Slash dance for silver. Works

42:02.300 --> 42:10.740
every time. Even bipedal cows get free stuff. I play with my co-workers and they give me

42:10.740 --> 42:15.420
money. I don't like it either. I don't like that difference. Then don't do it! Take the

42:15.420 --> 42:22.580
moral high ground! No! Free stuff, Jamie! Well, I can actually get away with cuting

42:22.580 --> 42:27.660
on a game and having them give me money. Hey, if you can, shake what the Earth Mother gave

42:27.660 --> 42:33.980
vidpawas says 99.9% of female night elves are guys

42:33.980 --> 42:39.500
true true true statement because remember girls don't play on the internet

42:39.500 --> 42:43.420
there are no girls on the internet yeah we're there

42:43.420 --> 42:47.820
we're making fun of all the guys I got a question do most gamer girls

42:47.820 --> 42:49.540
that you know do they like to play

42:49.540 --> 42:52.580
as sexy women in games or like

42:52.580 --> 42:55.960
beast I'm gonna kick your ass don't even look at me women

42:55.960 --> 43:00.200
in MMOs. About equal I guess

43:00.200 --> 43:03.680
I don't know. Depending on what mood you're in? When I was

43:03.680 --> 43:06.800
um, shoot, what was that mecha game back in the day?

43:06.800 --> 43:11.000
Back on Virtual On, my two characters were either

43:11.000 --> 43:14.720
Feynn or the big bulky one with the big gun

43:14.720 --> 43:19.120
because I was like, I can shoot you from over here and you can't get close to me.

43:19.120 --> 43:23.720
One thing I liked about Ragnarok online when I played that is- Nobody's ugly?

43:23.720 --> 43:29.260
No, well because everybody looks the same, but one thing you could do is you could cross dress on Ragnarok online

43:29.260 --> 43:32.840
Like remember I used to have the giant bow. Yeah, I had the giant bow in my hair. That was awesome

43:32.840 --> 43:36.580
I still have that picture. My rogue has a dress. I'm sorry

43:37.540 --> 43:39.540
My rogue has a spare dress

43:41.120 --> 43:43.240
For when the roleplay gets kind of weird

43:44.820 --> 43:51.700
This show's starting to get a little weird and you admit this on the airway in front of several thousand downloaders

43:51.700 --> 43:57.380
And you can message him at Thisis23rdman.com

43:57.380 --> 44:03.700
Will you do a search for 21 year olds in the Sacramento area because I want to see if Andrew

44:03.700 --> 44:08.020
comes up on uh actually will you look for some profiles in our area maybe we should respond to

44:08.020 --> 44:17.620
one are you on here are we gonna find you not yet I will do that just for shits I will indulge you

44:17.620 --> 44:23.740
on that I don't think it actually lets you look in area however there's a guy

44:23.740 --> 44:29.720
I found a guy in Baton Rouge that's not bad it's a little far but it's long some

44:29.720 --> 44:32.600
long-distance day you know what okay even though we're giving this crap I

44:32.600 --> 44:40.320
found a person who looks like Tran even as in big alien from Australia even

44:40.320 --> 44:43.300
though we're giving this crap a hard time you for I want to be devil's

44:43.300 --> 44:46.960
advocate for a minute talking about Wow dating and all that stuff when it comes

44:46.960 --> 44:52.700
to long-distance relationships, isn't WoW like a way that you could kind of, and please

44:52.700 --> 44:56.960
don't take this as me saying I do this because I don't, but like, I've heard of other people

44:56.960 --> 45:02.520
doing this, isn't WoW kind of a way that you could like be with somebody even though you're

45:02.520 --> 45:04.580
not?

45:04.580 --> 45:05.580
You know what I mean?

45:05.580 --> 45:09.240
Like you can adventure and do things together with somebody in a virtual form even though

45:09.240 --> 45:10.880
you're not there, really there?

45:10.880 --> 45:18.020
you know when Dan and I first met we would just hang out on an AOL chat for

45:18.020 --> 45:20.740
like ever because you know at the time that's what we had we played Gemstone

45:20.740 --> 45:27.780
for a little while but yeah back in the day Gemstone and Slingo no I hate Slingo

45:27.780 --> 45:35.920
okay and I played a tetranet I was a tetranet girl but yeah it's I suppose

45:35.920 --> 45:42.280
it's sort of a way to at least see a part of you together with the person

45:42.280 --> 45:48.640
you're interested in you know and online relationships can make long distance

45:48.640 --> 45:53.160
easier I think but honestly nothing's gonna make up for the face-to-face

45:53.160 --> 46:00.040
meeting and when you start wanking to the in-game sprites that might be why

46:00.040 --> 46:04.060
something you need to share I know so you're the one who's been buying out the

46:04.060 --> 46:06.460
plastic covers that fries up.

46:06.460 --> 46:08.060
So that was you on YouTube?

46:08.060 --> 46:10.180
Oh really?

46:10.180 --> 46:12.180
Under Wankmaster.

46:12.180 --> 46:20.900
Seriously, though, online gaming can be kind of a touchy thing with relationships, especially

46:20.900 --> 46:24.660
in party-based games, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy.

46:24.660 --> 46:29.020
If your significant other isn't, say, pulling his or her weight, that could lead to any

46:29.020 --> 46:32.180
bigger argument that you can ever have in person.

46:32.180 --> 46:33.280
Interesting.

46:33.280 --> 46:36.040
So you think WoW could actually cause fights?

46:36.040 --> 46:38.000
It could cause a whole lot of fights.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
Interesting.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.640
Especially if one of them happens to be a healer.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.000
I'm looking through chat here.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
I kind of thought it would be a little...

46:45.000 --> 46:47.920
You mean you could actually get married on Ragnarok on the Korean servers?

46:47.920 --> 46:49.520
I thought it would be a little more lit up in chat.

46:49.520 --> 46:50.520
Why do we never get this stuff?

46:50.520 --> 46:54.680
Yuri Lover in chat says, when I play WoW, I get free tampons and condoms.

46:54.680 --> 46:57.960
I have no idea how that works, but okay.

46:57.960 --> 46:58.960
Hack!

46:58.960 --> 47:00.440
It's gonna be in the next patch, probably.

47:00.440 --> 47:04.240
That's a hell of a hack.

47:04.240 --> 47:05.920
What exactly would a tampon do for you?

47:05.920 --> 47:06.920
Plus two to stamina?

47:06.920 --> 47:07.920
What exactly?

47:07.920 --> 47:10.220
I still think that they should do the hat idea.

47:10.220 --> 47:18.080
They had a Ragnarok with the poo hat and the apple of Archer.

47:18.080 --> 47:22.120
Jeremy Todd One says, the wow dating service is just for nerds who can tell their friends

47:22.120 --> 47:23.840
that they have a girlfriend.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.760
Yeah, so?

47:25.760 --> 47:27.080
I resemble that remark.

47:27.080 --> 47:30.440
EvilCheese666 says ultimate wow pickup line

47:30.440 --> 47:33.920
so hey baby you grind here often? Nice!

47:33.920 --> 47:37.400
That one's great. I'll show you my Arcanite Reaper.

47:37.400 --> 47:41.520
Oh, I didn't say that on the air.

47:41.520 --> 47:45.720
What'd you say? I picked my proficiencies by the way. What's that? I picked tailoring

47:45.720 --> 47:49.320
and herbalism. Fun.

47:49.320 --> 47:55.800
So I can, you know, go get Gloomweed. YuriLover says he plays triple X wow so no, where are you going?

47:55.800 --> 48:02.120
So you can make you can make clothes with hemp and you can I can make hemp clothes and be a hippie a

48:02.640 --> 48:06.880
Hippie zombie. All right. I think we probably should go on to the next topic now. I think

48:08.400 --> 48:12.880
No, no, no, well maybe later we'll come back to it later, but this is huge. I think this is huge

48:12.880 --> 48:19.720
It's a rumor, but it's it could be huge and you know that we've been speculating for a long time that Apple

48:19.720 --> 48:24.320
Apple wants to get into the gaming market and also there's been speculation out there

48:24.320 --> 48:28.080
that Apple and Nintendo want to get into bed together.

48:28.080 --> 48:33.120
So that just makes this story... actually Apple and Nintendo have been dating on World

48:33.120 --> 48:35.680
of Warcraft believe it or not.

48:35.680 --> 48:42.360
No seriously, there is a rumor going around on MacRumors and it's saying that Apple is

48:42.360 --> 48:48.100
currently planning on making classic Nintendo games playable on the next iPod.

48:48.100 --> 48:53.620
Now the website is not able to confirm this speculation, but you know, it does fit into

48:53.620 --> 48:56.040
that whole fanboy dream, doesn't it?

48:56.040 --> 49:02.780
Now MacRumor says that it's going to be playable with a special accessory.

49:02.780 --> 49:04.000
Whatever that is.

49:04.000 --> 49:14.160
That special accessory, trans-vibrator, special accessory is another game system.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.160
What do you think, Loki?

49:15.160 --> 49:17.020
I'm really curious to see what you think about this.

49:17.020 --> 49:18.960
You know I need your input on this.

49:18.960 --> 49:19.960
What do I think?

49:19.960 --> 49:21.200
I think, well that would be disruption.

49:21.200 --> 49:22.200
They're always talking about the...

49:22.200 --> 49:26.320
I think it's all bullshit just because I don't think that they would want their classics

49:26.320 --> 49:27.720
to be played on an iPod.

49:27.720 --> 49:32.400
One, you couldn't do it on an iPod anyways because, I mean come on, the iPod is not meant

49:32.400 --> 49:33.400
for gaming.

49:33.400 --> 49:34.400
I mean...

49:34.400 --> 49:38.300
But okay, but let's say, like, iPods have that little slot at the bottom that you usually

49:38.300 --> 49:39.800
put the USB charger into.

49:39.800 --> 49:41.720
I know you wouldn't know that, but they do.

49:41.720 --> 49:45.240
You could easily plug a joystick in there, or like a little NES-style controller.

49:45.240 --> 49:49.240
There you go, gaming system on the go. I could see it. You couldn't do it with the current setup.

49:49.240 --> 49:51.240
You would have to have this attachment, but you could do it.

49:51.240 --> 49:53.240
But the question is, would they want to?

49:53.240 --> 49:58.240
Because my thought when reading this was, well, what about Virtual Console and being able to download to your DS?

49:58.240 --> 50:04.240
Again, I'm speculating with that. They haven't said you'll officially be able to do that.

50:04.240 --> 50:09.240
But logically, you'll be able to download some stuff to the DS, why not Virtual Console games?

50:09.240 --> 50:11.240
So why would Nintendo compete with itself?

50:11.240 --> 50:15.280
I would they wouldn't compute itself they would use it probably just to help

50:15.280 --> 50:17.080
promote themselves I don't know I don't think

50:17.080 --> 50:20.480
so you think you're 1Z2Zing it but who's gonna buy the accessory for 1Z2Z games?

50:20.480 --> 50:24.120
I don't know and here's the thing too is I don't know if they would do that because

50:24.120 --> 50:27.900
just because you're playing retro games on your iPod does not make you

50:27.900 --> 50:28.760
wanna buy

50:28.760 --> 50:32.280
you know Wii or whatever I mean it's kinda my

50:32.280 --> 50:35.280
take on it is this isn't gonna sell more systems

50:35.280 --> 50:39.420
or you know I don't know they're I don't know how they're gonna make money off

50:39.420 --> 50:40.720
this I guess if you buy

50:40.720 --> 50:43.800
you know each individual title or whatever and download it to your iPod

50:43.800 --> 50:47.800
I guess I'd be kinda neat but whatever I mean

50:47.800 --> 50:51.240
to be honest I don't think this is going to happen

50:51.240 --> 50:54.360
chat rooms lit up on this a little bit blaze revolution says Apple is trying to

50:54.360 --> 50:56.760
grow a gaming penis and isn't doing a good job of it

50:56.760 --> 51:00.160
Apple does have a booth at E3 every year

51:00.160 --> 51:03.520
it's little and it's in the back and you have to have an invite to get there

51:03.520 --> 51:07.280
but they're there but I always kind of assumed it was for their graphics

51:07.280 --> 51:11.780
type stuff that they can do for computer anyway and then let's see Mac Man says

51:11.780 --> 51:15.260
they're announcing a new iPod this August well that's no surprise they they

51:15.260 --> 51:18.780
need to announce a new iPod to sell them this Christmas but my thought was it's

51:18.780 --> 51:22.340
gonna be the movie iPod yeah because it's already been going around they want

51:22.340 --> 51:26.540
to put that in iTunes so that makes sense what do you think about this Jamie

51:26.540 --> 51:32.180
would this make you want a game on the iPod having NES games on it yeah I'd be

51:32.180 --> 51:36.820
something to do at work between the Animal Crossing no I don't play Animal

51:36.820 --> 51:44.300
crossing at work anymore I take a nap it's true I my doctor told me to it's

51:44.300 --> 51:51.780
true but no I would do it you know say that I'm like stuck like in line for the

51:51.780 --> 51:57.160
bathroom at the Riptide arcade which I was standing in for 25 minutes it'd give

51:57.160 --> 52:05.680
me something to do so yeah all right hmm okay well speaking of other portable

52:05.680 --> 52:11.720
music systems, the Zune has been officially confirmed by Microsoft.

52:11.720 --> 52:16.440
It is coming and it's actually all will be revealed soon according to them in a brand

52:16.440 --> 52:21.560
new Billboard magazine article which is going to be talking about it and how they also plan

52:21.560 --> 52:25.480
to release additional Zune branded devices.

52:25.480 --> 52:31.440
There's also a fun little website you can go view which is comingzune.com and it has

52:31.440 --> 52:36.480
a really stupid video that's on there that hopefully is not their advertising campaign

52:36.480 --> 52:41.540
for this because it shows like some really ugly stick figure drawing or whatever of some

52:41.540 --> 52:45.440
guy and then some little person that's humping a rabbit and I don't really know what the

52:45.440 --> 52:51.320
hell that has to do with anything but whatever and so one kind of interesting thing though

52:51.320 --> 52:58.320
they said that it will reportedly include access to digital media and wide range of

52:58.320 --> 53:03.960
Windows-powered devices, and also they're saying that it's going to be something that

53:03.960 --> 53:09.280
aspires to be one part MySpace, one part iTunes, and one part Xbox Live.

53:09.280 --> 53:14.240
So I don't know exactly what that's supposed to mean, but they're saying that maybe after

53:14.240 --> 53:19.920
this you're going to see probably a video player and possibly a portable games device,

53:19.920 --> 53:22.480
all branded with this brand new Zune thing.

53:22.480 --> 53:26.240
Does this have anything to do with gaming, though?

53:26.240 --> 53:28.040
In the end, do you think anything gaming will come of this?

53:28.040 --> 53:31.400
actually one thing that was interesting about that and I'm reading this a while

53:31.400 --> 53:36.920
back is the zoom is actually gonna be fit with a processor that's a bit more

53:36.920 --> 53:44.000
powerful than you would really need for playing music on it so it's you know

53:44.000 --> 53:48.380
something comparable to maybe like a PSP or even more powerful than that which is

53:48.380 --> 53:53.040
interesting when you think about it hmm so interesting it's it I think it's

53:53.040 --> 53:56.600
interesting you brought up the whole myspace thing to myspace is interesting

53:56.600 --> 53:59.600
By the way, Orange Launch Radio has a Myspace. You should add us. It's your friend today.

53:59.600 --> 54:01.600
Myspace.com slash Orange Launch Radio. Thank you.

54:01.600 --> 54:04.600
But Myspace is huge right now. What is it? Like the fourth

54:04.600 --> 54:09.600
most visited site on the internet? I would think more people want a piece of Myspace.

54:09.600 --> 54:13.600
I don't think competitors to Myspace work as well. Why aren't people trying to...

54:13.600 --> 54:15.600
They are. Just team up with Myspace.

54:15.600 --> 54:20.600
Well, think about this. Altair Wireless has that Myspace on-the-go type thing

54:20.600 --> 54:23.600
that it actually is branded with Myspace.

54:23.600 --> 54:27.040
where you, I don't know what the hell you do with that, post messages I guess

54:27.040 --> 54:31.120
whatever but still though that's something that you know they can have and maybe even

54:31.120 --> 54:33.760
add later on like they're gonna have you know myzoon.com

54:33.760 --> 54:37.400
or something like that where you'd have your own like personal

54:37.400 --> 54:40.400
web page maybe showing what you're playing on there what music you're

54:40.400 --> 54:41.480
listening to when

54:41.480 --> 54:45.640
you can you know go all emo on it or something and just you know let

54:45.640 --> 54:49.800
everybody know. It's like you're all, I'm planning on blowing up this bus!

54:49.800 --> 54:53.560
It's like oh crap he's sitting next to me! Damn!

54:53.560 --> 54:56.720
So myspace is so interesting though. It's like that site

54:57.400 --> 55:02.460
That everybody uses because they have to but nobody likes to admit they use it. You know what I mean?

55:02.460 --> 55:08.220
I stayed after clerks to to see the myspace names on there and apparently I'm on there twice

55:08.220 --> 55:15.220
But I it's like six rows of names going pretty fast down the screen and even though it's in alphabetical order by our last name

55:15.220 --> 55:17.560
It's still fucking hard to find yourself on there

55:17.560 --> 55:21.760
and the DVD it's gonna have everybody that's on there right now so that's over

55:21.760 --> 55:27.480
a hundred thousand names on the TV our buddy Bobby Black Wolf's in chat right

55:27.480 --> 55:30.920
now by the way he had his one-year birthday tonight for his show so

55:30.920 --> 55:37.160
congratulations Bobby and it's all downhill from there my black wolf says

55:37.160 --> 55:42.600
Microsoft's ad campaign my space is where the internet goes to die my zoom

55:42.600 --> 55:50.340
is where the internet goes to live anywhere get it live live uh-huh it's

55:50.340 --> 55:54.900
true that was it's actually that's pretty punny I'm not writing that shit

55:54.900 --> 56:01.580
down Bobby all right are you a big myspace fan dark soccer I'm only there

56:01.580 --> 56:05.760
because I have to be exactly that's how I feel about it friends it won't get on

56:05.760 --> 56:09.660
live journal so I have to keep up with them on myspace although I did find my

56:09.660 --> 56:12.620
one of my best friends from high school yeah that's that's kind of the same

56:12.620 --> 56:16.900
reason I use it is that I found people that I would never have reconnected with

56:16.900 --> 56:22.020
someone I didn't like his sister messaged me so yeah my brother's so

56:22.020 --> 56:25.140
cool were you friends with him uh yeah you know the other great thing about

56:25.140 --> 56:28.420
Myspace and I swear I'll get back into games I've been able to go back to my

56:28.420 --> 56:33.220
high school graduating class and see who's gay you know because like you know

56:33.220 --> 56:36.900
you can go back and really see what became of everybody like oh I knew he

56:36.900 --> 56:40.080
was gay I knew she was gay I knew that you know and then you know all the

56:40.080 --> 56:43.400
people that had you know 70 babies you know just everything played out exactly

56:43.400 --> 56:52.320
turned out to be a breeder exactly anyway sorry for that randomness there

56:52.320 --> 56:56.280
let's get back to games and we'll talk about Konami we love to talk about

56:56.280 --> 57:00.000
Konami we talked about them for years and years and years Konami has announced

57:00.000 --> 57:04.640
a partnership with mobile gaming company Tokyo pop to launch a new series of

57:04.640 --> 57:05.800
of mobile games.

57:05.800 --> 57:10.480
Now Tokyo Pop is kind of like this youth-oriented entertainment and all that stuff.

57:10.480 --> 57:14.240
Now Tokyo Pop is also the number one manga company in the U.S. and they will be launching

57:14.240 --> 57:19.420
together a series of mobile games starting with East Coast Rising.

57:19.420 --> 57:23.000
This is a story that has to do with pirates and high seas adventure and that will be available

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
in early fall.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.840
Comes a quote from Stu Levy, the CEO of Tokyo Pop.

57:27.840 --> 57:31.600
We are very excited to be partnering with Konami to move to Tokyo Pop's creative juice

57:31.600 --> 57:33.920
in the white-hot area of mobile gaming.

57:33.920 --> 57:39.620
Our two brands both stand for an East-meets-West aesthetic that really speaks out to fans worldwide,

57:39.620 --> 57:43.260
so working together is a natural fit that will truly push the envelope.

57:43.260 --> 57:46.260
It should be interesting to see where that partnership goes.

57:46.260 --> 57:50.460
I like the way that CEO of Tokyo Pop talks, by the way.

57:50.460 --> 57:53.820
Creative juice into the white-hot area of mobile gaming.

57:53.820 --> 57:57.140
There's something X-rated about that.

57:57.140 --> 58:01.820
Speaking of X-rated, we have to delete those porn emails from our mailbag every week to

58:01.820 --> 58:06.800
to find your emails because we love to hear from you guys and all you have to do is drop

58:06.800 --> 58:11.820
us a line at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com and DarkSakura gets your emails and she picks

58:11.820 --> 58:16.240
her favorites to read on the air, which she's going to do right now, right Jamie?

58:16.240 --> 58:23.720
That's right, Rob.

58:23.720 --> 58:30.800
My first email actually has to do with something that my husband's been ogling over but I'd

58:30.800 --> 58:38.060
like to thank our dear friend Rob with two B's for mentioning it to me stern

58:38.060 --> 58:42.680
basically the only company that's still making pinball machines has a pirate to

58:42.680 --> 58:47.100
the Caribbean pinball machine and I saw pictures of it last night it actually

58:47.100 --> 58:52.580
looks pretty darn cool it has a sinking ship and a treasure chest and all kinds

58:52.580 --> 58:59.240
of cool stuff that pops up but it's actually around $4,000 right now so yeah

58:59.240 --> 59:05.380
We've been sort of debating to can we justify the expense of a $4,000 pinball machine? Yeah, let's do it

59:05.380 --> 59:11.500
I don't know but um, but anyway, yeah post a bit of a of an article on here that said

59:12.300 --> 59:13.500
that

59:13.500 --> 59:18.860
To quote on here Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is the perfect title and theme for a pinball said factory honcho

59:18.980 --> 59:24.340
Gary Stern it lends itself to lots of mechanical action pinball shots and toys for casual players

59:24.340 --> 59:29.740
yet the story cries for deep rules to challenge the best of players and from

59:29.740 --> 59:34.000
what I've heard from other pinball geeks like me and my hubby it's supposed to be

59:34.000 --> 59:40.760
pretty hardcore so got another email we got one a short one from a Krispy

59:40.760 --> 59:46.360
Creamy who's one of our chat room people too said hey guys I just got guitar hero

59:46.360 --> 59:49.040
for my birthday and it totally rocks but I would also like to try out the new

59:49.040 --> 59:54.080
guitar freaks game new because my guitar freaks controller broke is it possible

59:54.080 --> 59:58.800
to use a guitar hero controller on guitar freaks the answer is yes it is

59:58.800 --> 01:00:03.200
yes oh I didn't know that I would I would have said no but I haven't tried

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.100
we actually and actually the guitar freaks controller works on guitar hero

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:11.160
two only barely hmm you have to configure it but we were trying to do

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.720
two players I thought they did experiments that showed that wasn't true

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:20.280
I had no oh it's barely compatible but it is huh I'll be damned yeah the new

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:24.600
I remember how we talked about the, oh maybe you, it was one of the shows where you weren't

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:32.960
here, Konami trademarked Guitar Revolution, okay I couldn't remember, that was a big thing,

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.960
I know but.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.760
Well you do remember Red Octane made those generic third party guitars in the first place,

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.600
four guitar freaks in there like, hey let's make a game out of this.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.920
Whose idea was it, harmonics or Red Octane?

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.200
No Red Octane had those controllers out since Guitar Freaks has been out like originally.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.920
Those controllers didn't have a whammy bar.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:55.480
oh my god well that was so brand new okay that's a huge part of Guitar Hero

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.440
but they did actually get the licensing from Gibson which I thought was cool so

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.280
you can actually get that they need to do a flying V controller then I'll be

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:07.400
happy um we got one from the gamer here's a question I was just wondering

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.340
he's the gamer that's it there's that's it he's the gamer and every time we

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:19.640
talk about gaming news it's about this guy I had to million Margaret Cho quotes

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:25.400
going through my head now. Let's keep it moving. Where's this parade? Let's keep it moving.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.000
Since you guys live in California, do you ever go to the Price is Right, Rob? I've been

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.240
one time. I have. I went once. You sat by dude, right? Yes, it was in April. I got you

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:42.320
on TV. It was April of 2002, and I was in LA for Coachella that year. This has nothing

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.360
to do with gaming, but I don't care. I was in LA for Coachella that year because I went

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.240
And we decided we would go by the price is right, you know, hell, why not?

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.920
Well, we actually got to go to two tapings because a big group had canceled for the second

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.920
taping.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.020
They do two tapings on Monday.

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.560
And for the second taping, I got to sit right behind Rod Roddy because this was about a

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.080
year before he passed away.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.900
And it was sparkling in my face and everything, it sparkles.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.660
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.780
You know what I could see on Rod Roddy's platform?

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:08.780
Tax forms.

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.720
You know what's on those tax forms?

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.340
All of the prices of all the prizes.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:17.180
So all you had to do was look at that and if they called me up on stage, which they

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:23.100
didn't because I'm boring I guess, then I would have won the Showcase Showdown.

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:26.540
And I kind of would have been cheating, but at the same time I don't think I would have

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:28.540
felt bad about it.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.540
Because I would have had a new car.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.260
That you have to pay taxes on.

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:37.460
I would have sold the...there's always some crap prize in the Showcase Showdown.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:43.020
I would have sold the...I don't even fucking have room for a dinette set in the house.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.140
I would have sold that shit to pay the taxes on the car

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:49.940
Well, I'm saying I just think it's kind of funny that you win all these prizes and you have to pay taxes for him

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.900
Well, you know

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.900
our friend Mel one on

01:02:54.300 --> 01:03:00.460
That's right wheel of fortune real fortune. We should go on a game show. We should all go on a game show like survivor

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:08.460
No, how much weight I'd lose our anyway, but the rest of this email basically didn't leave a voicemail because he didn't want to pay for

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:09.420
it

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:13.860
Fair enough. Okay. Um, I think the games have gotten easier because back in the 80s

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.780
There were arcade games like Pac-Man centipede of this command where there was no storyline to it

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:24.020
All it was was basically the same level except the enemies moved faster and less time to do stuff and that made it harder

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.800
Also the old game since it is harder

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:32.280
You're most you are mostly going to get a game over and a game over minute

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.160
You had to start from the beginning now once you get past a certain point in the game

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.160
just it would save so you'd have to start from the beginning and this is

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.120
repeating sort of um some games now start to get boring after a while

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:49.380
playing it I remember one game on my dad's Atari 2600 it makes me so sad to

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:55.960
hear my dad's Atari 7600 and oh wow that he had when he was a kid that just hit

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:00.560
me too oh wow that hurt there was a game called Grand Prix that was actually I

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.880
I think the Odyssey 2 I think

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.320
It was a racing game that had the same cars in the same position

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.840
Everything and it challenged you to remember the order of the cars you could get it perfectly

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:18.000
But you had to get to the second level the cars completely changed position. It was really hard. Oh, yeah

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.480
That was Atari 2600. That was a lot like a

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:27.500
Rally X to rally X had the where you had to do anyway

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:30.900
But yeah, he said that he thinks games got easier.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.100
I don't see any punctuation, I'm sorry.

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:38.940
You know, our chat room over at orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat, is

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.540
talking about the Orange Lounge game show.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.620
They're saying, you know, we shouldn't be on a game show, we should have our own damn

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:45.400
game show. And

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.560
it looks like some folks are suggesting, like Tigerclaw says, it should be kinda

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.420
like Starcade.

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:52.620
And Starcade was an awesome game show. Starcade was cool.

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:56.820
You know, didn't we meet one of the guys from Gameplay HD at E3? Maybe we should

01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:00.600
send a treatment or something because that would be awesome you know little

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.180
little little tidbit about me it's always been a secret dream of mine to be

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.620
a game show host I would I would love it so much

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:13.340
Loki you could be a Barker's Beauty or something what I had outlined something

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:18.140
similar to that that's right I remember that was a orange lounge show that never

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:22.700
happened we need to talk about that we should do that I still have it you know

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:27.700
We're talking off air because I bet would really want to do something like that.

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:28.700
Okay.

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:29.700
Okay.

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:30.700
Okay.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.700
Ooh!

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:34.700
I think this is what happens in an Orange Lounge meeting.

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:37.700
Gas is a beer!

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.700
Live on air staff meeting.

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:40.700
Okay, anyway.

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.700
Next email comes from Tyson.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.700
He says, I'm a console gamer.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:49.700
I have two TVs, two Xboxes, two Nintendo 64s, a PlayStation 2, and a PSP.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:53.700
I've been playing a lot of Nintendo 64 games lately, and I realize they take longer to beat.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:57.700
For example, my friend lent me a Banjo-Tooie and Zelda.

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:04.700
I also own Mario. In the past two months, I have only beaten Zelda, and I am halfway done with Banjo-Tooie and Mario.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.700
I usually beat Xbox or PS2 games in a week.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:11.700
Why do you think newer consoles don't follow suit?

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.700
As in, longer levels, more gameplay.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:16.700
More games to buy.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:18.700
You're done with the game, you can go buy another one now.

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:22.540
now you lower the replayability then you're ready for the next thing to come

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:27.180
out honestly and that's someone left this on one of the voicemails of the

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:30.560
week which you'll hear in the next part of our show but it might have to do a

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.580
level design and the cost of level design and the you know difficulty of

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:38.340
level design makes it harder to do long levels I'm almost saying sort of and I

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:43.260
hate to bring back pinball in the middle of this but why not but um well you know

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:48.100
I'm with pinball when your only competition is yourself you have to make

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:55.000
your old games obsolete and make it so where you can make them obsolete so that

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.860
you bring out a newer better product so I think that they actually put this

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:04.540
limitation in some games so that they know that by the time the average player

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:09.800
is done with this game their next title is ready to come out it's kind of shady

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.260
but sadly I wouldn't disagree that some folks are doing that I don't think

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:16.380
everyone does but some folks but even nowadays they're kind of going on a

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:20.620
trend anyways, not necessarily just so you go buy another title, but so you buy the add-on

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.220
content that they add later on in episodic form.

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.820
Yeah, I was gonna say, isn't this what episodic gaming's all about?

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:26.820
Yeah.

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:27.820
Sort of.

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:35.580
Our last one comes from, uh, uh, xiaoran108, greetings, O.L.R. crew, recently you've been

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:39.740
mentioning an Orange Lounge army on the podcast that got me thinking, I recently started a

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:44.180
file in Disgaea Hour of Darkness and decided to name my starting non-storyline characters

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.180
after members of the O.L.R. crew.

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:49.360
So cute. And some other people mentioned on the show. My three, uh,

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.960
printies are named Skyloki and Shane. My red mage is Tia.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.160
And it's spelled like Tia does on her, on her,

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.640
MySpace. Yeah, he probably got it off the MySpace. Blue mage is Rice Princess. The green mage is

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.520
Pixie Dust. I have two brawlers and a dark saccharide next to her. Okay, this person is an

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.520
old-school OLL listener, because Rice Princess hasn't even been on

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.120
Orange Lounge Radio in probably at least a year, if not more. It's been ages since,

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:15.840
um, we've also had the- Pixie Dust, oh my gosh, yeah. The Orange Lounge Madam.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:20.120
Wow. You sir are old school and we applaud you.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.720
Tia moved to New York. Yeah. She's not going to be on our show anymore.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.680
Not if we can help it. We'll get her on the phone at some point.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:31.000
I will chase her ass down. I love her. Anyway.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.240
Anyway, getting to the point, I intend to pick up Disgaea 2 Cursed Memories as soon

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.000
as it is released

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.560
in the US, and would like to create an Orange Lounge attack before the character is named after the

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.400
LLR crew.

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:44.080
August 28th, by the way. If you have played the first game,

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.080
Seeing as how I believe most of the character classes and monster classes will be brought

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.820
over from the first game, I would like not only your permission to call them a faction

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:56.080
of the O.L. Army, but also have opinions on what character monster classes you would like

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.160
to be represented as.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.200
As far as I'm concerned, name a way.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.800
Use O.L. Army in your game all you want.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.800
I think that's rad.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.800
Send screenshots.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.800
Send screenshots.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.680
If it involves fire, I'll take anything that involves fire.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.680
I tend to go...

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.680
Fire and cute.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.040
It has to be fire and cute.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.300
You know Disgaea has that one, Disgaea kind of has cute all over it.

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:16.300
You know what I mean?

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.300
Fire.

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.300
Fuego.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.300
Fiore.

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.860
You'll have to forgive me, I haven't played a whole lot of Disgaea, but I remember one

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:25.740
of the lead characters was a vampire girl that was kind of a smart-ass.

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:26.740
Etna?

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:27.740
Yeah.

01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:28.740
I'd be a vampire smart-ass.

01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:30.340
She reminds me of you.

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:33.380
She reminds me of you.

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.380
That would be a...

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.820
That's because I am a smart-ass.

01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:37.820
Just not a vampire.

01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:38.820
Or are you?

01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.820
Are you oh do I need to get my garlic necklace?

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:47.700
Anyway, you invited me in I tend to be drawn. I tend to be drawn towards healing types, but I don't know

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:52.260
I like summoners too, but I don't think does this guy have something like that. I don't I didn't play enough of it

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:55.220
So I like fire make me a treasure hunter

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.640
But it has to be the thief treasure hunter

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:04.760
I like fire and you tell locks one of my favorite characters ever in a game love lock treasure hunter

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.760
Loki, what would you be?

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:07.760
I don't care.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.760
He'd be a big oaf with a club, that's Loki.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:10.760
He'd be the brute.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.760
Smash Mac, Smash Mac.

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.760
He'd be the Hulk.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.760
And Andrew would be one of those penguins that you throw and explode.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:25.760
I also did get another piece of news that has nothing to do with games or anything in the mailbox.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.760
Weird Al's next album is going to be out September 26th.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.760
Ooh.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.760
Sweet.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.200
By the way, I have to say this since the O.L. Army got brought up.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:39.140
I love, love, love this on the threads. Have you guys seen the trading card game?

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:44.360
People are going off. It's gone like three pages, the trading card game in

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.520
our forums, like people coming up with these cards

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:51.160
and man there's some like old-school references back to like pre-podcast

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.400
episodes of Orange Lounge Radio and stuff.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.760
It's nutty. You guys are awesome. We have such awesome listeners and even

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.920
the screenshots have continued. People have been submitting screenshots of like Orange

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.540
lounge references in games and like, you guys are so awesome, like, we don't even have to

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:08.640
promote when you guys are doing that, it's so awesome, but word of mouth is where it's

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640
at, so you guys are doing us a huge favor.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:13.280
I've been trying to play more online ChromeHounds, since I know we have the OLR army on there.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.920
The problem is though, in order to play online, you know, and actually have some decent mechs,

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.200
you have to play the offline version, and uh, yeah, whatever.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.760
Seriously though, send us your screenshots of orange lounge in random games and we will

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.360
like do a collage for the site or something, it'll be awesome.

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.880
You know, I'll tell you what, if everyone does it high quality enough, who knows, maybe

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.420
we'll see about having an official game or something.

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:38.600
Dark Knight says, we are the Orange Lounge Radio Street Team.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.600
That's a good reference.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.960
You guys really are doing that for us.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.200
We love you guys for it.

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.280
Here's my thought.

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.280
I would love this.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.320
I don't know about you guys.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.940
And I know we have a couple industry people that listen to the show.

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:53.560
How awesome would it be to be like a voice in a video game?

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.320
Like actually voice a character for some game?

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.780
I've been voice acting before.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.300
Not for a major game, have you?

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:00.420
No, but I've done voice acting for a radio drama.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.420
Oh, okay.

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:02.420
That's cool.

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:06.060
I've done a little voice acting for a fandub, and that's about it.

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.060
Okay.

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:11.420
Yeah, somebody was supposed to give me information about voice acting for said fandub.

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:12.420
Okay, okay.

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.420
I'll give it to you.

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:15.420
Oh, sheesh.

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:19.260
Yeah, that would be awesome, but I don't know.

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:22.100
I was doing I Feel Sick, the radio drama.

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.460
All right, anyway.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:26.020
I was the B-girl.

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:28.820
Industry peeps, if you're listening, throw us a cameo.

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.820
Seriously.

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.820
Alright, so that's it for the mailbag?

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:32.820
Yes it is.

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:37.260
Send us email mailbag at orangeloungerator.com because we love getting emails.

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.260
You guys rock.

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:39.260
Alright, excellent.

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:47.100
Well, speaking of fun stuff, Sony is patenting a brand new, well I guess next gen iToy type

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.100
of device.

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.740
Which is not too surprising when you think about it because I mean it did after all have

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:57.740
the Eye of Justice, or Eye of Judgment. Yeah, not Justice. That'd be a whole other game.

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:05.380
But Eye of Judgment. Basically, in a nutshell, this whole brand new eye toy, what's supposed

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:10.740
to be kind of neat about it, is that it has technology that allows one single 2D camera

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:17.180
to analyze objects in full 3D using some sort of patented mapping technique. Previously,

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:20.960
The only way you could do this is with two cameras.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.620
But now they've basically found a way to do that.

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:25.480
So great!

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.020
That's awesome that they're doing that.

01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:30.240
Still the Eye of Judgment sucks ass.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.380
And that's just because the game sucks and is really unfeasible.

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:37.660
But nice to see that they are releasing some new itoy games.

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:41.340
Hopefully they won't suck as bad as all the other itoy games in existence.

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:44.500
Oh you know they can't make a good itoy game.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:48.460
Well here's the problem with the eye toy. It's just that in their perfect world an eye

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:54.900
toy would work fine against a white background. Except my living room is not a white background

01:13:54.900 --> 01:14:00.540
as seen in said test areas. But I don't know.

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:05.780
This is the day of like Martha Stewart where everybody paints her like has a red wall and

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:09.140
then a green wall and then a beige wall and then a puce wall.

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.860
I see a red wall and I want to paint it black.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:18.220
Anyways, well I think the problem is though is like these itoy games you want to play

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:22.060
them in like kind of a party environment and when you have people you know drunkenly moving

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.240
around in the background, it kind of interferes with the game.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.840
So I guess that's kind of neat that they're going to be doing this.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.020
Hopefully though they fix a few of the problems that were with the original itoy.

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.020
So yippee.

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:36.020
Hooray!

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:41.700
Well I have something to make people go yippee, sort of.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:44.820
Sony, so how excited can we be?

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:47.140
Sony Online Entertainment actually

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.420
has an agreement done with Epic Games

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:52.700
to license the Unreal Engine 3.

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:58.180
So there's a quote here from the Epic's game president, Mark

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.340
Raine, saying, Sony Online Entertainment

01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:03.380
has a reputation for delivering detailed, truly engaging

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:04.780
interactive online worlds.

01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.580
It is a great privilege for us that they're

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:11.340
using Unreal Engine 3 to create their next generation projects.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:16.500
Of course, we've also seen it licensed by THQ, Bioware, Midway, Atari, Buena Vista.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:20.860
Yeah... Who hasn't licensed it at this point?

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:24.420
Heck, I licensed it just yesterday to do my taxes.

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:28.380
Oh yeah? Well, I better get a return on this.

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:33.660
Die! No. Oh, what a compliment to the creators there, you know? Your engine's getting

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:34.500
used everywhere.

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:38.860
Sony's just jealous everybody else had it first. Eddie in our chat room says, oh, I

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:41.920
should say OL Army yet he said in our chat room says boo epic for supporting

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.400
Sony seriously speaking of everyone having a piece of it Hillary Clinton

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.720
she's and I'm not talking about Bill Clinton by the way yeah I don't know if

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:57.840
you phrase that exactly the way you intended anyways Hillary Clinton piece

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:03.040
of it or full of it piece of it you know cuz everybody is fucked Bill Clinton I

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.280
I didn't fuck but you know what? Let's just let's get this

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:13.880
Please games. Okay speaking of what is it the heat that's making everyone crazy tonight heat. Oh my god

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.880
Did you put something in those fucking cookies?

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.920
Joe's cookie mix

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.320
Trader Joe's ganja cookie

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:31.640
Natural man, first of all, I know that you were allergic and I am allergic and I would be pretty funny to get Andrew

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.940
all on some ganja cookies though we orange down's radio does not sorry

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:43.040
cookies condone the use I mean you can make our crap I'd be door but we do

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:48.440
endorse beer can we anyways get through party for God's sake Hillary Clinton go

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:55.320
Hillary um no she's actually trying to give her some ganja cookies she already

01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:00.840
had her batch of those when she was in law school in hell she baked she baked

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:06.520
I bet that she baked a batch of, uh, of, like, brownies, special brownies for her teacher.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.520
That's how she passed all her finals.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.520
Okay.

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:10.520
Poor Loki.

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:13.720
I have done the X-Racks brownie trick, do not laugh about that.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:18.400
Loki is usually the one that derails this show, and he looks so frustrated right now.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:28.720
Anyways, so, Hillary Clinton, Cookie, um, she, she's actually kind of in the focus

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:35.140
sort of a brand new scandal now. It's having to do with legislation that she's supposedly

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:43.640
going to be trying to pass to impose a tax on games. And, you know, basically, I don't

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.680
know what the purpose of this would be at, you know, and still no way to actually confirm

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:56.520
whether this is true or not, but great! Taxing games! God, I really hate her. And she just

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:59.880
gives me another reason you know there's already an ugly skank there's already a

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.880
tax on them it's called sales tax yeah but she wants a better tax because you

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:07.800
know everybody's got to pay for you know the crazy people that you go out and

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:11.660
murder in the name of video games and so I guess this would pay for this then

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:17.160
they need to put a tax on board games they need to put a tax on other computer

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:20.960
don't give her any idea I could only support this if it was across the board

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:26.280
like you know it's video games movies and lots of forms of entertainment

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.960
rather than just singling out video games because honestly what's the

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.080
difference? Well this is a really stupid platform for her to be you know talking

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:35.320
on anyways and I really hate how they're gonna you know the rumor is that they're

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:39.040
gonna be using this in the 2008 elections video game violence and that

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:44.960
kind of crap. She should take a cue from her you know buddy Jack who got basically

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.400
told to fuck off by the court. That was legendary. That was beautiful.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:53.200
Seriously next thing you know they'll be putting a tax on cigarette oh wait. He

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.300
tried to do his whole friend of the court thing and the judge is like screw

01:18:56.300 --> 01:19:06.360
you piss off and the paraphrase by the way oh we'll see what happens so

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.960
basically you know one thing is you know Clinton is waging a public crusade

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.820
against games and apparently you know recent speech in front of the Kaiser

01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:20.940
Family Foundation she's a she accused modern society of performing a massive

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:26.760
experiment on millions of children by exposing them to games, electronic media, and omnipresent

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.080
advertising.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.200
At the rate technology is advancing, people will be implanting chips in our children to

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.400
advertise directly into their brains and tell them what kind of products to buy.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.400
Clinton warned.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:43.520
Of course, being that she's in a government position, I'm sure she realizes that also

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:47.820
the U.S. Army is using those tactics with America's Army as their recruiting tool.

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:51.880
Do you know how bad I would want to just pick her brain and see where she's coming from

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.880
on this?

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.540
Like, I want her on the show so, so bad.

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:56.540
It is not even funny.

01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:59.620
Like, I just want to know, why games?

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:02.780
What is, what is, what is making you tick on this whole thing?

01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:03.780
You know?

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:07.540
Well, my husband would rather play some Grand Theft Auto than give her Nookie, okay?

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:08.700
Wait, wait, wait.

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.540
Loki, read that last paragraph again.

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:12.540
The one about the chips.

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:19.100
At the rate that technology is advancing, people will be implanting chips in our children

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:23.780
to advertise directly into their brains and tell them what kind of products to buy.

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:27.420
Ladies and gentlemen, we already know this, but this bitch has gone off the deep end.

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.420
Seriously, what.

01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:29.420
The.

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:30.420
Hell.

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:36.540
That's just making me think of that one episode of C-Lab.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:40.660
You remember C-Lab, where they went on the surface and all these people were addicted

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:41.660
to a video game?

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.660
Oh, God.

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:49.500
Well, basically, this comes to us from Rocky Mountain News, and it was shared to them from

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:54.780
a very reliable source, but very reliable and very anonymous, so interesting.

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.820
What are you looking at there?

01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:05.140
I'm looking at the notice in order by James Brady, judge of the Middle District of Louisiana.

01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:10.180
It is ordered that the motion for leave to file an amicus curiae brief be, and he's hereby

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.180
denied.

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:15.060
What they should have added is denied

01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:19.700
Bitch. It's in capital letters. Notice how big

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:23.540
bold and beautiful that word denied is. It's one

01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:26.740
page with no explanation. It's basically

01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:30.900
the legal fuck off. So I'm going to post this in the chat room. I didn't mean to

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:35.620
hijack your thing but the chat room should see this. EvilCheese666 in chat room says

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:39.660
we need to mobilize the O.L. Army. We're going to war to stop the evil of taxes.

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:51.660
I'm not anti-taxes if it's going to a good cause, but I'm not for this because it's unfair.

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:58.660
It's targeting one element of entertainment that seems to be the common scapegoat.

01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:03.820
Well, if any if any of our listeners that would like, you know who are hearing this later in in the week

01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:10.180
It's a game politics comm slash images slash la dash jt dash denied PDF

My cookies are top notch.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:02.320
I think that's a good time to go to break and find our rails

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.600
again, and let it cool off a little more in here,

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.280
get this heat out of here.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.720
