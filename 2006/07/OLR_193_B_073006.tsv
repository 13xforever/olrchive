15450	19131	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19851	23792	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 193.
24312	27513	Inching closer and closer to that magic 200 number.
29103	32505	We are a video game podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know.
32905	35806	And if you haven't heard the first part of our show yet, what's wrong with you?
35926	41588	Go back in our podcast feed available on iTunes or on our website or wherever you downloaded this podcast.
41848	56874	Go look for Part A. And of course you can always listen to us live as well on OrangeLaunchRadio.com Sunday night when we tape our show or our rebroadcast on AllGames.com which just moved to Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 8 o'clock Eastern Standard Time.
57642	59723	And now let's get back into some gaming news.
59763	63364	I'm going to start us off, if you guys are okay with that, DarkSakura and Loki.
63784	64424	I'm sorry, no.
64625	65085	Okay, go ahead.
65285	67105	We didn't talk a lot last segment about the Wii.
67426	69526	So I want to bring up a story about the Wii.
69566	75989	This is a rumor going around, and I emphasize the word rumor here, that Nintendo is sending out free Wii dev kits.
76069	79430	It's a rumor from an insider that wrote to Kotaku.com.
80150	85014	According to Kotaku, it seems Nintendo is giving Wii development kits to smaller studios.
85634	92259	A developer in a coastal American city apparently received a package from Nintendo, and nobody was aware what was even inside.
92319	95221	But the box was opened, and there was a Wii dev kit inside.
95734	97775	Now, this could be seen multiple ways.
97795	112005	This might be a way for we to get indie developers to make games for the console, and it certainly would show a shift in Nintendo's attitude towards third-party supporters, maybe recognizing where some of the mistakes were with the GameCube.
112045	116508	It's kind of like, hey, we really want third parties, indies, everybody on board with this.
116548	121292	So, certainly interesting if it's true, but it may not be true.
121352	121752	It's still
122584	123424	A rumor at this time.
123444	125085	Well, the dev kits weren't that expensive anyways.
125125	127025	I think they were like a grand or two.
127065	130126	Well, I would hope not, considering the hardware is supposed to not be as much.
130527	135608	Well, they put out an email now that has their DS lineup.
136508	136988	Oh, cool!
139029	139909	Here's what's coming out.
140429	148392	There is October 9th Clubhouse Games, Nintendogs Dalmatian version on October 16th, October 23rd Magical Star Sign,
149486	152047	In 30th, there's a Pokemon Ranger and Children of Mana.
152167	153408	Ooh, Children of Mana.
154488	156289	November 6th has Elite Beat Agents.
156809	157930	13th, Yoshi's Island.
157970	161671	December 4th is Custom Robo Arena and Kirby's Squeak Squad.
161691	165012	You know what's pretty awesome about that Clubhouse Games?
165273	165553	Hmm.
165793	169834	It's over Wi-Fi with all 48 games that are going to be in it.
169994	170355	Yeah.
171495	175397	And, which might come into the show, PictoChat over Wi-Fi.
176810	177490	Oh, that's right.
177530	178610	I remember hearing about that.
179110	180871	Isn't this game already out somewhere else?
180911	182191	It's called something else in other countries.
182231	183211	No, it's coming out in the UK.
183251	185732	It's called 48 Collection or something like that.
185772	186572	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
186592	188752	Because when I first read about the game, that's what it was called.
189112	191233	Now, none of these games are nothing spectacular, right?
191273	195353	It kind of reminds me of those Hoyle collections that are available on the PC.
195433	200194	But being able to play it over Wi-Fi with PictoChat, hooray.
201154	203555	Drawn genitalia galore while playing Hearts.
204545	205026	Summer Camp
222458	225241	and Nintendo is actually holding a summer camp of their own.
226121	227503	It's called Camp Hyrule.
227803	229324	Now, it's not a real camp.
229524	231306	I mean, obviously it's about video games.
231406	233027	Come on, the idea is to stay indoors.
233388	234649	It's a virtual camp.
235089	237131	Now, not a lot is known about this.
237211	239413	Camp Hyrule is going to have activities like
239773	240874	Thanks for watching.
240934	241895	See you next time.
262731	263773	There's a quote here, though.
264314	275190	If you like to talk about video games, play practical jokes, and rub elbows with Nintendo's expert gamers, then get ready to meet new friends at Nintendo's Camp Hyrule 2006 and win prizes like T-shirts and magazines.
275551	276933	Subscriptions while you're at it.
278255	287661	Coming the week of August 14th through 18th, 2006, the rumored theme this year might be The Legend of Zelda, The Phantom Hourglass, Nintendo Wii, and Super Mario Galaxy.
288082	293225	Interesting because I noticed in DarkSakura's list of what's coming out for the DS, Phantom Hourglass wasn't even there.
293725	295427	So, I don't know what that means.
295447	297748	Well, there was rumors that it was going to be delayed until next year.
298849	299069	Huh.
299793	303116	Oh, now Blaze Revolution in chat says Camp Hyrule is nothing new.
303136	304577	They've been doing it for at least five years.
304617	305658	Yeah, they've been doing it for a while.
305678	305798	Really?
305838	306459	I've never heard of it.
306919	307460	What do they do?
307780	308140	I don't know.
308340	309021	How did I miss this?
309041	310422	We've been doing this show how long now?
310502	311583	And I've never heard of this.
312083	312284	Ever.
312544	318929	Well, this is on the Nintendo site, Nintendo.com, so if you don't read that site, you probably won't.
319330	321311	I do sometimes, but I don't know.
321331	321912	All right, fine.
322212	325014	So I apparently have been living in a cave the past ten years, so fine.
325995	327336	Are any of you guys doing Camp Hyrule?
327857	327997	Nope.
328476	328636	No.
328816	329837	No, I didn't sign up either.
330878	332399	I was like, eh, investment of my time.
332639	333060	You might?
333280	333580	I might.
333600	334561	Somebody needs to do it.
334661	335241	Someone has to.
335642	335962	You know what?
335982	337783	You need to go represent the OL Army for us.
338064	338424	Why not?
338624	341306	Hey, I remember Nestor and Howard.
341346	342327	I could get on this.
342347	343328	Pimp the damn show.
343748	344489	That's what I mean.
344529	345149	We need our folks.
345389	346530	We need an OLR cabin.
347391	347711	We need it.
348112	348432	Fuck it.
348472	349713	We need Camp OLR.
349893	350193	Come on.
350333	351434	OL Army, assemble.
352075	354757	It'll be on that chess board in front of your apartment complex.
355832	357813	I totally want to have a Campo LR.
357833	358493	That would be fun.
358573	363296	Actually, I want to do a real con thing or something, but we'll see.
363416	364016	Orange con?
366397	367038	Orange con.
367058	367778	That would be rad.
368458	371080	Someday, when we have lots and lots of money, we'll see what happens.
373261	381225	Anyways, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, but one thing that did happen is an AMD and ATI merger.
381245	382746	Thank you for your enthusiasm, by the way.
383166	383586	Yeah, but...
383945	385787	I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.
386427	389089	By the way, great transition.
389369	389990	Love you, Loki.
390750	406323	Anyways, yes, the $5.4 billion transaction took place last week with AMD purchasing ATI, and now you've got a big combination of both processors and graphics chips.
406923	407884	Where will this lead?
408525	409525	Who the fuck knows?
409665	411547	That's where it's going to lead.
412045	419610	Probably going to see some ATI-based graphics chips on AMD motherboards.
421451	421671	Yay.
422412	425534	So this is great news, though, for your PC gamer, I guess.
425654	431118	But I always used to buy AMD chips for my PCs and ATI cards.
431218	432799	So I guess that works.
434760	435100	Excellent.
437782	441905	What I'm worried about, what if you're an AMD user with an NVIDIA video card?
443409	443589	Ooh.
445470	446450	Then fuck you.
446510	447230	You suck.
447751	448151	I don't know.
448171	449391	Then go buy a Mac.
451632	452632	Go buy a Mac.
454593	455313	Hold on here.
456493	458094	Let's get back on the Sandy bus.
459594	460355	Okay, listen.
460435	462495	I get my Mac in very soon.
462535	463276	God damn it.
463296	467757	Just when I thought the hate mail for Loki would stop coming in.
470378	470818	Anyways.
470838	470978	Anyways.
471730	473932	How about we just turn this right around?
473992	476273	How about we turn this bus around right now?
476594	478535	We're talking about PCs and gaming.
479456	480316	Mac wouldn't be in there.
480817	483699	Gee, I wish somebody had a story to save us right about now.
483999	486241	You know that female otaku need love too?
487001	487302	Really?
487382	489003	In Japan, you can rent a friend.
491124	491545	Wait, wait, wait.
491865	493806	Are they horny gamer girls?
494147	495748	Yeah, did you find out about this on Myspace?
497229	497329	No.
498126	498726	It's on Kotaku.
499047	499327	Oh, okay.
499587	500007	Just as bad.
500067	500407	No, I'm kidding.
500427	501308	How much?
501728	503169	We love you, Kotaku.
503449	504430	They're cool.
504870	505490	Five dollars.
506571	506891	No, no.
507091	511274	It's actually 12,000 yen for two and a half hours of friendship.
511594	512034	Wait, wait, wait.
512194	514696	Now, but this is not like a whore thing.
514756	515276	No, no, no.
515316	516857	This is girls for other girls.
517898	520579	This is called the Secret Otaku Support Commission.
521139	527203	They rent out women who are knowledgeable in video game culture to girl gamers who got no friends.
527679	535321	If I want to pay for friends, I join a frat.
535401	537302	Sorry, so many college memories just came back to me.
537702	543124	As it's said by Seiji Hirokawa, who is their creator and operator.
543504	544644	Funny that it's a man.
546685	550826	It says, we're an otaku dispatch agency that caters exclusively to female clientele.
551246	556128	Many women otaku don't have other women otaku to talk to, and they get pretty lonely.
556168	556968	That's where we come in.
558432	564253	They charge 12,000 yen, basically 120 bucks for two and a half hours of friendship.
564593	567274	Are you a lonely, lonely girl?
567294	568174	Pick up the phone!
568394	573395	Have you been a bad, lonely girl playing your video games all night long?
574096	577016	Do you want someone to play your games with?
577536	580437	Do you want someone to come over and have a pillow fight with you?
581277	584218	Well, Otaku Female Rental Service is for you!
585492	586832	This is very... I don't know.
586852	588333	There's just something kind of scary about it.
588353	592554	Maybe it's just the cultural difference or whatever, but there's something almost predatory about this whole thing.
592915	593295	I don't know.
593515	594015	Is it just me?
594935	595976	Jamie, would you pay for this?
596736	597496	No, I have friends.
598737	599117	That's true.
599777	600517	I'd pay for that.
600817	601117	That's right.
601137	602118	You had a pillow fight this weekend.
602138	602498	I forgot.
603158	605119	Anyway... Rob, shh.
605939	611141	You know, I'm not too surprised that a man is selling women to, you know, clientele.
611161	614302	I mean, pimps have been around for ages, so... But...
615250	625612	What I'm really surprised about is why an Asian chick that likes games and otaku stuff can't get some nerdy guy to be her friend.
625652	626752	I mean, come on.
627353	629653	That's where we need to be importing them, okay?
629733	631453	Just like, you know, there's Russian wives.
631894	634434	We need to get the Asian gamer chicks to come in.
634874	639015	Import them in, you know, and... Because we've got the demand here.
639215	640335	They have the supply there.
640755	641336	It's perfect.
641696	642156	Screw that.
642176	643156	Just export me.
645424	645964	I'm done with that.
647466	648006	Yes, please.
648046	648707	Can we look into that?
648747	649207	I'm just kidding.
650748	651129	Wow.
654852	655692	That's awesome.
656513	658155	That is excellent news.
659576	660076	I'm scared.
660116	661998	Now the chat room's got the wrong idea of me.
662218	663899	We have Justin in our chat room.
663919	664840	I don't know how else to pronounce it.
664860	666461	I think it's just Justin, but it's in elite speak.
666501	667322	It looks like Justin.
668003	670905	Justin says, I think Sky is suited well for a phone sex line.
670925	672947	That's kind of scary to me.
673607	674488	That's not my bag, baby.
675942	676402	Anyways.
676623	677543	Yes, please, anyways.
677824	688013	Speaking of women, a certain game coming out soon, Dead Rising, which is awesome, rewards you for...
688874	716732	taking erotic pictures of women um actually yeah one of the genres of pictures you can take in the game besides you know horror and drama and stuff like that is erotic erotica and they have a perfect picture of one of the leads in there i guess in fishnet stockings and lingerie and uh you're taking pictures of her and one of the focal points is her breasts and it's perfect and you get um prestige points for that it's kind of like experience points in the games but it's kind of interesting though because um
717349	719832	You can also take erotic zombie pictures.
722715	724397	Erotic zombie pictures?
724497	724817	Yes.
725618	726980	Erotic zombie pictures.
727320	729042	Why didn't they just call the game that?
730203	733046	Why didn't they just call the damn game erotic zombie pictures?
733127	735089	You know how many more copies would have sold?
735109	736510	This is a simple 2000 series, okay?
736550	737872	This is a cool game.
739709	741910	How many more copies would have sold?
742230	746192	Dead Rising, you had to tell me about what this game was about before I was interested in it.
746232	747172	I actually had to see the preview.
747452	754456	But if you told me there was a game on the market called Erotic Zombie Pictures, I would have been like, say no more.
754616	754956	Sold.
755216	755536	Sold!
756837	758097	I didn't know that was your bag.
760618	762499	Well, I think it's pretty awesome.
763539	767061	Apparently, you can also get points by just
767793	768673	You know, pretty much doing everything.
768913	769314	I love this.
769534	772154	This is actually translated from Famitsu Magazine.
772875	778517	And they have, it says, and this is the exact, you know, English translation.
778777	790041	If the sexy survivor you rescue by the chance arrival which photographs the seductive scene because also sexy acquisition PP increases.
790721	791941	PP being prestige points.
792221	793502	You dirty bastards out there.
794522	796803	Okay, I'm, okay.
796903	797283	Whether it,
797876	802420	Just The Woman, also, it is... How can you not comment on that?
802500	806244	How can you just overlook that blatant reference there?
807425	808686	Hey, the debt is rising.
809787	810167	Oh, God.
813050	813750	Blah.
813871	816193	Welcome to the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio, everybody.
816433	818094	It was lovely knowing you these past four years.
818174	822999	Unfortunately, the jokes, we've suffocated ourselves on the bad jokes tonight, and we're dying.
823099	824200	It's going to be an awesome game.
825503	826344	It's gonna be an awesome game.
826464	828485	Just buy it for the awesomeness in the game.
829225	833748	I mean, I knew right away when they saw the little publicity shots of who the characters are gonna be in the game.
833789	837471	I mean, we're talking like horny otaku women.
839412	846137	I have a quote from Mystery Science 3000 to quote in regards to the whole taking pictures of half-naked girls.
846237	847077	Erotic zombie pictures?
848218	849219	Well, whoop-dee-shit.
851921	853041	That's your outlook on that?
853262	855263	Aren't you excited to be taking erotic pictures?
858769	860090	I love zombies, but not that much.
861871	862652	Bruce Campbell, yes.
863973	865474	I need the human chin to come talk to me.
865494	869337	Can you use, like, because you can use anything to kill things in Dead Rising, right?
869357	869437	Yes.
869477	870477	Can you use pants?
872059	872479	I don't know.
873314	879319	It depends on if you mean in the American sense or the British sense because if you use someone's stinky pants, then yes, probably.
879339	884144	You can dress up like a little kid and you can wear stinky pants.
884224	888007	By the way, if Bruce Campbell is listening to this podcast, come hang out with us.
888127	888788	We want to interview you.
889605	890626	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
905001	907783	The rule, like, it's just weird, okay?
907843	909764	You take weird pictures and stuff.
910064	913806	I don't know how far it goes into the erotic stuff, but whatever.
914006	916348	Hey, hey, none of this shark jumping talk.
916908	917909	Oh, chat room?
918069	918609	No, we haven't.
918889	919309	No, we haven't.
919550	920290	No, no, no, no.
920350	922631	If we jump the shark, that happened a long time ago.
922751	926494	Like, you know... If we jump the shark, we are going to literally jump over a shark.
926934	928335	We jumped the shark episode two.
928395	932277	Jamie skipped town on episode two of Orange Launch Radio, if you guys remember.
932677	934118	All right, anyway, let's move on.
934997	935317	Please.
936118	945202	PlayStation 2, how we love thee and your cheap games because there's cheaper games coming out for the PlayStation 2 thanks to a new greatest hits collection.
945582	959868	That's right, 1999 will buy you Jack X, Combat Racing, SOCOM 3, Sly 3, Honor Among Thieves, Ratchet Deadlocked, and sure to excite folks everywhere, Shadow of the Colossus.
961029	961529	Very nice.
963336	971022	No idea when that is supposedly coming out, but it's the next series according to a leak from Circuit City, which I imagine will be very soon.
971102	973363	Yeah, I'll have the release coming soon, probably.
973643	973924	Awesome.
974044	976926	Also getting greatest hits, I just want to mention real quick, is the PSP.
977526	979327	And these are also going to be $19.99.
979488	985952	ATV Off-Road Fury, Ape Escape On The Loose, Hot Shots Golf, Twisted Metal Head-On, and Wipeout Pier.
986954	988135	GS68 says no Luminous for the lose
1015478	1016418	Yeah, that kind of sucks.
1016699	1019440	Well, they want to suck all the money they can out of that stupid thing.
1019940	1020500	But, whatever.
1021001	1023602	I have a personal bone to pick about Luminous.
1023782	1023962	Why?
1024602	1026563	I couldn't get Luminous 2 to install on my phone.
1027664	1029365	Oh, you tried to get the cell version?
1029525	1029865	Yeah.
1029925	1030605	I didn't know it was out.
1031226	1033487	Yeah, and it wouldn't install, stupid network.
1033887	1035928	I'm totally going to try and see if I can get that game.
1036748	1037128	Sweet.
1038089	1042191	Anyways, the former manager of Sony's...
1043424	1049368	Third Party Relations has left and actually went to Ubisoft, which is kind of interesting.
1051370	1054812	So, you know, people leaving Sony, I guess that's not really big news.
1054832	1060696	What is big news is they're saying that they've sent out over 10,000 PS3 dev kits.
1062097	1064238	So, wow, lots of dev kits going out there.
1065519	1067861	But all the dev kits in the world won't make that system any cheaper.
1069935	1072517	Yes, but it might get more games worthy of you to talk about.
1072537	1073037	More games, I'm hoping.
1073057	1074118	More exclusive games.
1075299	1076800	And it's a good thing they've sent them out.
1076840	1081022	Because before, I remember they were saying that it's really costly to develop for it.
1082623	1089447	And so those 10,000 dev kits to over 208 companies in 11 countries.
1090068	1090348	Nice.
1091509	1096952	And that's apparently the largest on any PlayStation platform to date.
1097272	1098313	So that's actually pretty cool.
1099312	1099933	That is pretty cool.
1100875	1105883	Speaking of cool, and actually, you know, we brought this up last week with the release dates.
1108207	1110030	EA is bringing out Sims 2 Pets.
1111453	1112655	There's some details on this.
1113809	1120712	It actually is going to be a PC expansion, standalone for PS2, GameCube, PSP, Nintendo DS, and Game Boy Advance.
1121353	1127776	You can have kitty cat, and puppy dogs, and guinea pigs, and birds, and whatever else they decide to put in there.
1128837	1130017	You can create... Penguins?
1131038	1131878	Yes, raw penguins.
1131958	1132458	Yay!
1132939	1133259	I don't know.
1133919	1141403	You can create your own pet, and customize everything from fur to body, personality, you can make them smart puppies, or...
1142073	1143474	Stupid guinea pigs.
1143674	1144775	Evil purple penguins?
1145596	1147457	Yes, Rob, evil purple penguins.
1147477	1148117	Yay!
1148238	1150719	You can name them Bob.
1152140	1154422	Oh, Ari Masa wants to know snakes?
1155023	1155523	On a plane?
1157424	1158065	Ba-dum-bum.
1158625	1159486	Yeah.
1159866	1166031	You can teach your pets to shake, roll over, play dead, you know, dig up dead bodies, that type of thing.
1167172	1171595	No, if you catch your puppies digging in the garden or scratching up the furniture, you'll have to spank.
1172592	1174793	and you'll be taking them to go get spayed or neutered.
1175654	1183038	You can also use codes where you can share accessories, fur, markings, that type of thing.
1183058	1184919	So basically you can make skins for your pets.
1186420	1187741	Different versions will have different things.
1187821	1192544	PC will let you have designer pets like labrapoodles and puggles and schnoodles.
1194044	1196346	Can you breed hamsters with dogs?
1197006	1197066	No.
1197086	1197426	Or cats?
1197526	1197887	I don't know.
1198667	1200208	Can I breed a pig with an elephant?
1200928	1201329	Exactly.
1201349	1201629	Hey!
1204111	1207652	And your creative pet, you can actually create them as unique pedigrees and put them online.
1209113	1215555	They can actually have career paths, which is a show pet security or service with five job levels apiece.
1216375	1220037	The PS2, GameCube, PSP versions will let you take them for a walk in the park.
1220377	1221977	Or they make friends with other animals.
1222297	1227919	Does the hamster have an employment path of sex toy?
1228519	1228780	Yes.
1229400	1230700	It comes with a cardboard tube.
1230980	1232701	Can you take erotic pictures of the pets?
1235492	1237294	Can you kill them by drowning them?
1237594	1242620	So those are the PS2, GameCube, and PSP, are all getting like Nintendogs version, basically.
1242740	1244301	Do the parrots have large talons?
1245683	1246524	Hey, shut up.
1247565	1254692	On the DS, you can have a pet care center, and other owners can come to have you take care of their pets.
1254752	1256054	You have shops and...
1256792	1259873	You can earn money by having a pet shop, basically.
1260453	1265674	And the Game Boy Advance one will have different careers for the sim, including veterinarian and pet trainer.
1265854	1266994	I hope they can become rabid.
1268454	1272415	Blaze Revolution in our chatroom, orangelawntrainer.com, click on chat, says, I want a Liger.
1272915	1274515	Man, that Napoleon Dynamite.
1274635	1275375	So funny.
1275895	1277636	I want an Octocat, actually.
1277676	1280496	DJ Kibbles and Bits says, man, we need Spore already.
1281576	1283397	In talks of all these, you know, make your animals game.
1283617	1284377	Just give us Spore.
1285705	1287045	Damn it, EA, just give us Spore.
1287385	1287785	We're good.
1288126	1290726	Yeah, this is sounding a little too much like, what was it, RTS?
1290786	1292606	Impossible Creatures, if you remember that.
1296027	1296807	You're so hardcore.
1298227	1309129	Anyways, speaking of cool stuff coming out, the Wii, basically, Ubisoft in the UK has confirmed that Red Steel's coming out in November in the UK.
1310029	1312210	What does that mean to us, though?
1313010	1313270	Well...
1313769	1314709	Not a damn thing.
1314829	1315490	A couple things, though.
1315910	1317170	Red Steel is supposed to be a launch title.
1318050	1323092	Now, Red Steel is supposed to be coming, or the Wii is supposed to be coming out before the PlayStation 3.
1323993	1324473	That we know.
1325053	1329194	So, for example, the PlayStation 3 is coming out in mid-November.
1329715	1332155	So, therefore, this has to be coming out early November.
1332816	1337457	Well, in the UK, and the UK is probably going to be getting the Wii a few weeks after us.
1338458	1340878	What's a couple weeks before November?
1341719	1342099	October 18th.
1345195	1354083	I am so sick of all these news stories about the Wii's speculated release date.
1354123	1356365	I mean, the damn thing will come out when it comes out.
1357301	1360323	Guess which date I had in my system when they put Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam.
1360343	1360843	That's right.
1386311	1388573	I'm going to kind of feel bad if it doesn't come out October 18th.
1388593	1390934	I'm going to feel like Reggie personally fucked with us.
1391815	1395597	He's all, I'll show you, think you know when it's coming out, bastards.
1397558	1399840	Ah, how you like them apples?
1400661	1405524	Ari Mawson in chat says Zelda Twilight Princess is scheduled for November, though, and that game's coming out on launch day.
1406384	1410187	Yeah, but there's been no official date announced for Twilight Princess because...
1411300	1414742	That's going to be the day that the Wii comes out, so obviously they're not going to announce that.
1415143	1417444	Yeah, by the way, Twilight Princess is coming out this day.
1418065	1419466	Oh, crap.
1419946	1420547	They're not going to do that.
1420607	1422208	Guys, we have a huge scoop for you guys.
1422328	1423769	The Wii is out right now.
1424169	1427251	In fact, go to your local GameStop or EB Games and ask for one.
1427411	1428252	They'll love you for it.
1430774	1433596	And if the store tells you they don't have them yet, they're playing a joke on you.
1433636	1434717	Go to another store and ask.
1435998	1436658	Exactly.
1437118	1438439	Please, I hope you guys know I'm kidding.
1438900	1439440	Please don't.
1440003	1441384	It's super secret.
1441404	1448046	Because there's nothing one of those employees at those stores loves more than people coming in going, Do you have the Wii yet?
1450487	1462331	Anyways, speaking of lies and speculation, there's been a lot of rumors going around to what some of the secrets of the Wii and what they might be.
1462391	1469014	So, anyways, some speculation here we've got for you, including this is apparently from...
1470900	1477728	The full scope of the Wii controller details have yet to be revealed by Pixar and Nintendo Although I cannot elaborate
1493082	1503712	Any further, let me say that Nintendo should show that movement in 3D space will allow experiences outside of just the TV screen, and it's not 3D projection related.
1504172	1513701	But this also kind of, if you think about it, goes back to that one article we had about Red Steel and how some of the multiplayer won't take place on TV, which is interesting.
1514642	1527658	The first game that's going to be shown to the public that will demonstrate the full scope of the Wii controller potential will be Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2, which is also scheduled for October, by the way.
1528540	1530142	That's for all systems, including the Wii.
1532631	1541377	The sensor bar was in all actuality in no use at E3.
1542137	1544279	What it will allow hasn't been shown yet.
1544859	1548101	Which, I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but interesting.
1548121	1559929	It says, according to people who are working close with everyday events at Nintendo Research and Development, Nintendo Wii specifications were far and away developed solely for the machine.
1560515	1563536	and says apparently that the specs keep changing on it.
1564276	1578362	Also that there's plans on maybe doing a Wii headset for the online capability and they might even go further in having it have a gyroscope inside of the headset for game use.
1579182	1579602	Interesting.
1581383	1584364	Some of it far-fetched, some of it maybe.
1584944	1585284	I don't know.
1586425	1586905	We'll see.
1587694	1587794	Roar.
1625373	1626974	Here come the FUs of the week, boys and girls.
1631376	1635377	My FU of the week goes toward websites that use flash ads that have sound on them.
1636418	1643861	Like when you go on Myspace and you hear SMACK THE BUG to win a million dollars.
1645001	1649683	Or like whatever site that was playing the sounds of death and I couldn't find what ad it was to turn it off.
1651224	1653225	Just a big, stinky pile of poo on that.
1654497	1679302	Okay, um, you know, FU to IGN, and FU to IGN for one reason, and I've covered this before, Jessica Chobot, I don't like her, and the reason I don't like her is because she's, it's like a Paris Hilton situation here, famous for no apparent reason, famous because of something stupid, famous because she licked a PSP, come on now, and now they have her in like this
1680595	1683236	My FU of the week goes to my facial hair for growing too fast.
1683316	1685557	As you can see, I was too lazy to shave today.
1685577	1685958	Or yesterday.
1709870	1711591	and I practically have a beard at this point.
1712572	1715814	So, an FU to the, and an FU to the inflating cost of razors.
1717775	1718155	Magus!
1720636	1724899	Yo, my, uh, FU this week is the same as last week.
1725159	1726500	FU to my air conditioner.
1727060	1730042	Apparently the compressor took a shit, they have to replace the whole unit.
1730462	1733484	Oh no, we're not gonna replace the whole unit, we're just gonna fix all we have.
1733664	1738227	Well, you know, make a decision and get to it because it's still like 90 degrees in my den.
1739264	1743167	My computer will not work right, and it's just a big pain in the ass.
1745149	1745469	Alright.
1746750	1748792	Thanks for keeping the angst quick tonight, guys.
1748832	1750453	It allows us to move on to another story.
1751334	1756638	Anyway, speaking of fun stuff, this week Fusion Frenzy 2 was announced.
1757279	1761522	And for those who might not remember, it was a really cool game that was on the Xbox.
1762463	1767127	And it's basically a collection of about, you know, 40 or so minigames.
1767845	1785356	Well, this time they're going to be having more mini-games as well, over 40, and set on seven different planets, as well as online multiplayer matches and tournaments, and it says players will be able to use tournament cards they've earned for a variety of purposes, including selecting the next game to be played or choosing the next planet to go to.
1786076	1791200	So, it sounds like a pretty fun little 360 game, and it's set to hit the stores this holiday season.
1791580	1796583	Well, if you're having a hard time playing through Fusion Frenzy 1, maybe you ought to get a tutor!
1797421	1803887	The Wall Street Journal has recently run a report on gamers who are using their skills to help pay the rent.
1804827	1808490	And basically what they're doing is they're setting up this whole enterprise here.
1809611	1822022	Seeing as gamers that work all day have not a lot of time to perfect their skills, gaming-lessons.com has this guy, Tom Taylor,
1822976	1830483	who you pay $45 for an hour and he will turn you into an expert master chief.
1832665	1835487	What do you guys think about hiring tutors to get better at games?
1839551	1843255	It's, I guess, an interesting idea for them to use to make money, but no.
1844736	1844856	No.
1846144	1850106	By the way, if you're questioning whether this is legit or anything, what can this guy do for me?
1850186	1855890	This is the guy who also just signed this big fat quarter million dollar contract to play Halo, essentially.
1857371	1859952	Okay, well how's he going to teach me to play something other than Halo?
1861233	1861833	Oh, that's right.
1862054	1866036	Well maybe if the business model works here, then it can work elsewhere.
1866136	1867057	So what kind of a tutor is he?
1868953	1871634	That's like saying, I'm a master at fractions.
1871975	1874016	Well, can you teach me some multiplication?
1874496	1876037	I'm a master at fractions.
1877138	1877498	No.
1878518	1878918	I don't know.
1878999	1880419	It's just kind of dumb.
1880579	1881400	I'm actually kind of curious.
1881420	1882661	I want to look at this site real quick.
1883281	1884962	It's gaming-lessons.com.
1885942	1886182	Hmm.
1886903	1888844	They have a gaming lessons store available?
1888864	1892466	It looks like they have some free, you know, sold-out lessons.
1892566	1892886	Wow.
1893246	1893987	People are buying these.
1894327	1895348	Sounds oddly familiar.
1895408	1897489	Sounds like that whole Penny Arcade Academy of...
1898444	1901065	I would laugh at that idea.
1923840	1924701	Alright, fair enough.
1925101	1929984	If you have a comment on that, you can always send it into our mailbag, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
1930425	1936109	And every week, DarkSakura likes to dig into the mailbag and pull out her favorite letters that hopefully aren't too moldy.
1937250	1938530	Some of them had some funk on them.
1938891	1940912	And was it convention funk?
1941873	1943014	Not as bad as fanboy funk.
1943194	1943454	Alright.
1943874	1949058	Anyway, she's going to open up that mailbag right now, kids, and pull out some of her favorite letters to share with us right now.
1952485	1955266	One of our emails comes from Ion671.
1955726	1959828	I'm not going to read the whole thing, but he calls us the OL Army Generals.
1959848	1960788	I think that's pretty funny.
1961928	1963249	That's Senior Sergeant to you.
1966190	1967470	Actually, General is above Sergeant.
1967670	1968470	Whatever, it doesn't matter.
1968590	1969931	I'm making a Warcraft joke, but whatever.
1971211	1972332	You guys are music game fans.
1972352	1975493	Do you have any favorite game soundtracks from any game, music game or not?
1975633	1976893	My favorite is definitely Jet Set Radio.
1979830	1981330	Wow, that's a really broad question.
1981350	1984231	I mean, do you want like recent game soundtracks or old school stuff?
1984251	1986452	You were singing Wonga Midnight Maximum.
1986512	1988032	Oh, I love Wonga.
1988092	1991813	As far as like a non-rhythm game, oh yeah, that's got a great soundtrack for driving.
1991893	1996394	Heck, I'll use that soundtrack, well at least the cuts I have, I don't have the whole thing, I need to re-get it.
1997214	1999835	I'll use the cuts when I play Xbox 360 driving games.
2000115	2007097	Like instead of EA tracks, because I don't really like a lot of that stuff, I'll listen to that music while playing driving games.
2007157	2007557	It's awesome.
2008021	2009942	I've told you you have access to all my stuff.
2010182	2011303	I know, I just keep forgetting.
2012724	2016866	Dance Dance Revolution 3rd Mix had a kick-ass soundtrack, in my opinion.
2017446	2018507	If you want to go new school.
2018527	2024069	If you want to go really old school, I like soundtracks like Super Metroid, but it's really old.
2024250	2025430	Loki, anything you want to suggest?
2027031	2028552	What was a really fun one I had?
2028792	2031874	Well, I had my car, Gran Turismo, the first one.
2031894	2034895	That had a pretty decent soundtrack.
2035315	2035475	Rez?
2036707	2037427	and Space Channel 5.
2037467	2040489	Justin and Chat wins Symphony of the Night.
2065593	2065874	Win.
2066394	2070878	Actually, actually, actually, I have many... I love Symphony of the Night soundtrack, especially the Saturn one.
2071238	2073420	They had the remixes of Bloody Tears and Vampire Hunter.
2073500	2073761	Oh, yes.
2074561	2088254	But I actually will take my... I actually burned off all the music off of my Rondo of Blood just to listen to the remixed versions of all the old school Castlevania tunes.
2088814	2089675	That and there's just...
2090814	2090894	Choo!
2090914	2090994	Choo!
2091114	2091194	Choo!
2117964	2121705	She used to be the real life anime girl is what her whole deal was.
2123005	2129327	Apparently she gave a shot of her business to the crowd at CoastCon about five years ago.
2130327	2130927	Home lighting.
2131027	2132207	Kitchenware.
2135228	2137129	And I get this from an eyewitness, by the way.
2137969	2140929	Next email before I say something really bad.
2141830	2143730	I was going down a troublesome path.
2143770	2145150	I needed to be shown the light.
2145951	2147191	The Grand Theft Auto New Wave one.
2147431	2147511	Oh.
2148208	2148568	A-Ryth Dying
2176111	2178773	But he's basically displeased with the fanboys on the internet.
2178793	2188980	He has a one-up club for people who are into the same games as he is and people are all like blah blah blah blah blah and he tried to ask them nicely not to and they were being rude back.
2189740	2192882	You know what, that's the nature of the internet.
2192902	2194343	I think isn't there an abuse report?
2194383	2196465	I'm biting my tongue so bad right now you don't even know.
2197265	2198946	Get off of one-up, start a Yahoo group.
2202088	2202348	Okay.
2203629	2203989	How's that?
2204310	2204690	That's fine.
2205467	2208828	Get off of Yahoo and go to OrangeLunchRadio.com Exactly.
2208848	2210449	Hang out with us.
2210469	2210849	Start a website.
2210869	2211689	Start a real website.
2211749	2212569	Anyway, moving on.
2213830	2217571	Our friend Rob with two B's sends us an email.
2217751	2218011	Uh-huh.
2219052	2222633	Here's some fuel for the fire the next time you discuss watching your own children.
2224533	2225854	My nephews visited yesterday.
2225894	2227815	Their mom had no clue which games they owned.
2228175	2228935	It turns out that Neil...
2229705	2233607	that only the ones I gave them, all appropriate for kids, are the ones they had.
2233947	2235527	But talking with the kids made me realize something.
2235568	2238489	Your children will be exposed to almost every game made through their friends.
2239309	2240670	That's a rough realization.
2240710	2245152	Despite your best efforts, little Johnny Doe will have Resident Evil on his DS because Mommy bought it for him.
2246272	2248833	Johnny will show the other kids, regardless of age, including your own.
2249213	2258037	Therefore, as long as one's parent doesn't care which games their kids play, no amount of laws will be effective or even practical in keeping that game away from your own children unless you live under a rock.
2258877	2264518	You can only battle this type of outside influence by teaching your kids to understand what is real, what is fantasy, and why they're different.
2265279	2265919	Amen!
2266659	2267439	Nail on the head.
2269359	2274461	Also, now this is something that I had actually half thought of getting for myself.
2274901	2276841	We'd been discussing it.
2277701	2282543	We got an email from... Ooh, I think our connection just hiccuped.
2285243	2287644	Anyway, we got an email from...
2291329	2301712	Gareth, who asked about the GP2X, which is the sequel to the GP32, which comes from Korea.
2302412	2305893	It's an open source handheld system.
2307333	2314495	You can load, as he says in here, I can play loads of classic emulated games, watch videos and podcasts all on one device.
2314535	2315235	It's at GP2X.com.
2318297	2320438	or gp2x.co.uk.
2322838	2324959	By the way, I want to thank the listeners.
2324979	2326440	This is a completely different random topic.
2326460	2335702	I don't remember who suggested it to me, but somebody suggested the front row application for the Mac and how you can install it on a Mac that it didn't really come with.
2335782	2339404	That's been great for my laptop for video podcasts and movies and stuff.
2339844	2342424	You talking about a device that would play all that kind of made me think of that.
2343305	2347046	I've decided when I buy my Mac, I'm going to be getting the Virtual XP.
2348083	2349683	I forgot who told me about that, but thank you.
2350603	2352484	Anyway, sorry.
2354384	2365426	And then one comes, the last one I'm going to point at tonight is actually a question that comes from Skater Dude.
2367086	2372447	Hey, Orange Nails Radio, I was wondering about how the DS sales are dramatically larger than the PSP sales.
2372487	2374568	Do you think it is because the DS is cheaper or what?
2374968	2375828	Please give me your thoughts.
2375908	2376288	Love the show.
2378035	2378495	I like my white light.
2405383	2409626	I just, you know, there'll be a cooler color that all the cool kids want.
2410666	2411667	So why do you have a white one?
2415289	2415789	Any more emails?
2415809	2416209	Here, Rob.
2416409	2417290	S-T-F-U.
2417310	2418751	Okay, thanks.
2418831	2419111	Bye.
2419431	2420071	Any more emails?
2420552	2421973	No, there aren't.
2422133	2432118	Then we should have more emails sent to us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Tell us how much you love it when I make those jokes that make Jamie uncomfortable.
2434318	2434959	Hope to hear from you
2445888	2453330	The creator of Electroplankton's brand new project, the Tenori On, would be something that you'll want to talk about.
2453550	2459392	And basically, Toshio Iwai is coming up with this brand new device.
2459472	2468135	It's basically a 16 by 16 grid of LCD switches, or LED switches, which are used to actually play music.
2468455	2471916	And you can kind of use this to create your own mixes
2472873	2488941	He actually has a website that you can visit, which is www.global.yamaha.com slash design slash tenori dash on, which is T-E-N-O-R-I dash O-N.
2489661	2490982	And you can check it out.
2491002	2493723	The device looks pretty interesting.
2493803	2499826	He says that anybody can use it to make music, and it looks kind of sexy.
2500839	2502780	So kind of a neat little device there.
2503520	2506141	And if it's anything like electroplankton, it should be pretty awesome.
2507221	2509762	Well, I know some people that played a lot of electroplankton.
2509782	2511322	In fact, so much they were addicted.
2511562	2518504	And you might remember on a previous program, episode of Orange Launch Radio, we talked about the Dutch Game Addiction Clinic.
2519044	2523246	And we were talking about all that, the folks that were signing up to go to this clinic.
2523266	2523866	Well, guess what?
2524206	2528127	Ever since this hit some of the mainstream news, apparently...
2528863	2534926	The gaming treatment program has been inundated with calls from parents wanting to get their kids in this.
2536766	2543869	Clinic director Keith Becker explained, Computer game addiction is obviously an even greater problem than we imagined.
2545650	2546270	Everything okay?
2547070	2548451	No, nothing.
2548591	2548891	Okay.
2550432	2551172	Just making sure.
2553053	2554834	Sounded like there was something bad going on over there.
2557422	2558982	You're having a little too much fun here.
2559042	2564484	I can say something about that name, however, I don't want to reveal where I... Does the game addiction thing strike a chord with you?
2565484	2566264	No, I'm not addicted.
2566764	2566984	Much.
2568065	2579528	Alright, it is conceded that video game addiction, also by the same guy, quote, is not a chemical dependency, but it's got everything of an obsessive-compulsive disorder and all the other stuff that comes with chemical dependencies.
2580268	2581008	Hmm, interesting.
2581308	2585269	You know, and I know there was another related story that talked about some guy was so addicted to video games...
2586131	2589233	that he never left his room and he peed in a bottle or something like that.
2589313	2590453	That's awesome.
2590774	2597697	Okay, dude, that guy had more problems of being addicted to video games because I don't know in what universe that's considered sanitary by any means.
2597777	2599218	That's obsessive compulsive disorder.
2599238	2600659	Yeah, there's something else going on there.
2600779	2602019	That's more than game addiction.
2602039	2603140	That's craziness.
2603320	2603740	I don't know.
2603920	2606382	It needs professional help, absolutely.
2606682	2607042	I don't know.
2608305	2618114	But I'm kind of weary about these people just having the parents call in and say, oh yeah, my kids are addicted to games because they just play them a lot and stuff.
2618134	2620716	And it kind of reminds me of that But I'm a Cheerleader movie.
2621857	2624639	Why is our chat room supporting the peeing in a bottle thing?
2624679	2626301	I mean, is this just an internet chat thing?
2626581	2628923	We have Eddie saying, pee in a bottle for the win.
2629463	2631445	Cage says, peeing in a bottle is awesome.
2631485	2632166	It's liberating.
2632907	2639810	Okay, the only time when it's ever socially acceptable to pee in a bottle is when you just can't pull over for some reason.
2639990	2640691	At the doctor's office.
2641831	2642432	Okay, fine.
2643092	2648114	Or if you have cancer and have a colostomy and have to pee in a bottle.
2648194	2648514	Fine.
2648655	2650535	Those are all medically necessary reasons.
2650655	2660920	But, I mean, because you're too lazy to put down the controller for five seconds of Halo 2 and go pee, it doesn't take that long to pee.
2661761	2662221	Poop socks.
2663107	2664548	I don't even want to go to number two.
2664568	2665589	I don't even want to go there.
2665950	2668432	This show's fucked up enough as it is.
2670754	2672676	Yeah, this show's gone down the toilet, and I mean that.
2672996	2681363	If you think that's crazy, well, you know, the talk of the Xbox 360 dropping down to $2.99, that is crazy talk.
2681764	2682404	That's a pisser.
2683505	2684086	Exactly.
2684466	2689010	It says, um, our analyst Michael Patcher has, um,
2691035	2693896	Pretty much explain why this isn't going to happen.
2694316	2705180	And the reason why is Microsoft Brass has informed the Xbox division that it must turn a profit or at least break even in the fiscal 2007 year, which ends in June 30th of next year.
2705621	2716305	He explains that that means that the price cuts on the Xbox 360 will only come if the box costs less to produce, ship, and market than wholesale price.
2716985	2719606	But the best guess is the box currently costs around $4 to $5
2720066	2720686	Thank you for watching!
2738535	2750702	The only reason they'll drop the price to $2.99 is say the PS3 comes out and they're like, Oh yeah, by the way, when we said it was going to come out for $4.99, actually $2.99 is the price that we're going to come out for it.
2750822	2751983	Then they'll drop the price.
2753264	2753864	Not going to happen.
2756186	2757046	No, don't hold your breath.
2757286	2758847	There's better games coming out in the fall.
2759568	2763250	When all those games come out, then you can decide which system you want.
2763632	2769014	Well, you know who's actually thinking that they're going to be doing a lot of profit?
2770615	2771515	That would be Nintendo.
2772776	2776817	They're going Wii.
2778858	2786521	Nintendo has actually just put out their results for their quarter ending last month.
2786981	2788162	Are they going Wii in a bottle?
2789522	2790943	I didn't want anybody to go there.
2791023	2791663	I really didn't.
2793718	2798464	Basically, DS is pulling in so much profit.
2798584	2802109	Basically, they've sold 21 million DSs and 4.1 million DS lights.
2804633	2808636	They've also sold more than 78 million games.
2809837	2819685	Nintendo's basically projecting that from April of this year through March of next, they will sell another 17 million DSs and 75 million games.
2821446	2823848	They were actually higher than their E3 predictions.
2825710	2827811	Actually, they're still supporting Game Boy Advance.
2827891	2830994	They're expecting to sell another 2.5 million Game Boy Advances.
2832194	2860722	30 million games for the system now they basically have ditched the micro I own a micro I remember when seeing that at E3 I'm like wow that's the dumbest idea I've seen yet I actually like my micro because when I was really bored standing around in line I had my micro on my lanyard around my neck and I could pick it up whenever I got really bored and play me some Kingdom Hearts it was
2861326	2863547	or, you know, I was playing Pocket Fighter.
2863928	2865289	Not Pocket Fighter, Puzzle Fighter.
2869031	2870512	Now, this is the interesting part.
2870532	2873233	Nintendo's got some predictions about the Wii, as I had mentioned.
2874975	2880258	Basically, for over the next five or six months, they're going to be selling the system.
2880618	2885081	They're expecting six million consoles and 17 million games.
2886782	2887222	Ambitious.
2887882	2888523	You think they can do it?
2889123	2889423	Oh, yeah.
2889704	2889984	It's Nintendo.
2890024	2890324	Nintendo.
2892432	2898254	GameCube, Nintendo 64, GameCube was actually pretty good.
2898534	2900035	Wii vs. PS3.
2900956	2901616	No contest.
2901636	2904217	At this point, absolutely.
2904277	2905018	But I don't know.
2905358	2907979	The Sony fanboy in me still thinks Sony might be up to something.
2908199	2908659	We'll see.
2909640	2909940	Anyway.
2910526	2912867	What do you guys think about anything we've talked about tonight?
2912927	2913607	Give us a call.
2913748	2914988	Our Skype line is open.

2930015	2932416	We are looking forward to your calls right now.
2933877	2934837	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2934857	2935238	Who's this?
2935758	2936478	Can you hear me now?
2936598	2937779	Yes, I can hear you just fine.
2937799	2938319	What's on your mind?
2939324	2941467	Hey Ranma, from the East Coast, what's on your mind?
2941487	2941667	Wow, so...
2961693	2969175	I mean, E3 is like the thing that you go to, but yet you probably have to sell one of your kidneys just to get in, you know?
2969675	2970176	Not really.
2970876	2973617	I mean, I have to be honest, it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
2975397	2978698	If you have a legitimate reason for being there, it's really not hard to get in there.
2980419	2980739	Yeah.
2981279	2981919	But, you know.
2983382	2984683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3012495	3020905	And it's like you got gaming in one section, talk about the latest technology in one, nothing but free demos and stuff to walk away with.
3021165	3023788	Plus you have freaking cosplayers there having a great time.
3028874	3030396	So this is a show that's open to the public?
3031037	3031197	Yeah.
3033650	3040095	Is this the direction that a show like E3 or whatever hopes to become the next E3, is that a direction that they should be taking?
3040595	3042477	Is to be a public show, you think?
3043157	3044218	I tend to think so.
3044398	3052145	I mean, the way they should have it up, like maybe the first day, important industry people only, then open to the public for everyone else.
3053165	3053746	I don't think so.
3054226	3054566	Why not?
3055047	3058109	Well, if you do E3 public, it's going to be a clusterfuck.
3058149	3059971	I mean, think of how it is right now.
3061032	3061972	How many people are there?
3062232	3064273	Can you imagine double that?
3065393	3066434	Yes, I can.
3066494	3067894	It's called New York Comic Con.
3070535	3070975	Interesting.
3073415	3078757	But then again, LA is pretty big too, and it's a good place to have something like that.
3078797	3080837	So I don't know how much bigger New York City could be.
3080877	3082137	I mean, yes, it's New York City.
3082478	3088219	There's no shortage of places to stay or anything like that, but I don't know.
3088749	3093292	You see, on the plus side, New York City is like this melt for all types of great stuff.
3093452	3103057	But on the downside, where the Jacob Javits Center is for digital life, it's like a 15-minute walk to the most local hotel unless you cross the river to Jersey.
3103618	3110181	I mean, for something like this, you'd have to bank on the fact that most people will be taking the bus and the subways to get to and fro.
3112383	3113323	Well, interesting.
3113603	3116245	It actually generates more revenue for the city.
3117468	3121171	Yeah, I hope so, because then I'm hiking up the fares for another year.
3121611	3124412	Do you see something like that realistically happening in the next couple years?
3124753	3125953	The show getting bigger and bigger?
3126754	3128255	Yeah, I tend to think so, yeah.
3128275	3130256	Alright, well, we'll see what happens.
3130696	3132657	If it gets big enough, we'll have to come out there, you know that.
3133398	3137781	Of course, I have to send you my list of all the cons I'm hitting up next year, so you three can come on out.
3137841	3141123	Hey, of course, with no E3 this year, that might mean I can make an East Coast con.
3141203	3145225	Exactly, that's what I'm thinking too, is like, hey, travel budget back, so maybe I can go somewhere.
3146475	3148536	Digital Life is something I've been wanting to do for a while.
3150576	3152457	It's like a geek's paradise.
3152537	3161699	The first day I went, they had teams from local high schools having a contest of how fast they could build a computer from start to finish, including boot up to Windows.
3162339	3165480	I just realized I'm going to be in New York City in October.
3165860	3170901	I haven't said anything about this on the show yet, but I'm planning on going to New York City in October, but it's the wrong weekend.
3171001	3172062	I won't be there for Digital Life.
3172222	3173222	It's going to be towards the end of October.
3173951	3174892	I don't know for sure yet.
3174932	3180558	I'll have more details later because I'll definitely go to the Nintendo store or something and meet fans if they want to come out.
3180698	3181579	I'll be at Wicon.
3182901	3183962	I'll be your security guard.
3183982	3188847	God, I shouldn't have said anything on the New York City thing.
3188867	3191850	Yeah, that's going to happen in October, but I'll say more about that later.
3192311	3194233	I'll be at SkyCon New York City.
3194253	3194633	Whatever.
3195114	3196015	Anything else you want to say?
3197183	3222045	uh that's basically it and I'm loving the show because if you didn't notice I was feeling sick earlier but listening made me feel better so laughter heals everything thank you so much appreciate it no problem have a good one buddy later later oh you know what let's move E3 to YowieCon I like that idea oh that's a pretty boy Nikki hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this uh hi this is Eddie hi Eddie what's on your mind buddy
3223752	3227955	I just wanted to comment on the E3 going public thing.
3228616	3230738	Realistically, I really don't think that's going to happen.
3231859	3236022	E3 is there for industry people to get stuff done.
3238304	3245851	If you have one day that's open to the industry and the rest is open to the public, I don't think there's enough time for people to get things done.
3247712	3250915	If they open it to both the industry and the public at the same time,
3251533	3257898	The industry people doesn't want to be tripping over, you know, all these fanboys who are there to see, you know, the latest game.
3258179	3258379	Right.
3258659	3261041	So what would your suggestion be for the independents?
3261101	3262542	What do the Kenshiya folks do now?
3264164	3272571	I actually think the IndieCon is a pretty good idea, but I still don't think it should be open to the public.
3272631	3279937	I think it should still be, you know, an industry-only thing where, you know, like,
3280672	3281132	All right.
3281212	3288715	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3289936	3290536	No, not really.
3290716	3290936	All right.
3290956	3291877	Well, thanks for your thoughts.
3292437	3292617	Yeah.
3292897	3293698	Thanks for the show.
3294618	3295218	Not a problem.
3295398	3298279	We like doing it because fine folks like yourself call us every week.
3298940	3299220	All right.
3299400	3299920	Have a good one, buddy.
3300360	3300560	Later.
3301781	3302521	We'll do one more call.
3303842	3304102	All right.
3305382	3306283	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3306303	3306623	Who's this?
3307276	3309218	It's Raven Stoffen again, sorry about that.
3309258	3310579	That's alright, much better connection.
3310699	3311760	Porn Torn's off this time?
3312340	3312681	Yes.
3313041	3313501	Much better.
3313541	3314942	Alright, Pornotube's off?
3315583	3317745	Yes, Pornotube's off.
3317765	3319266	Alright, let's try this again.
3319346	3320287	What did you want to call in about?
3321388	3326892	E3, and like you said, I don't think it's going to be cancelled.
3327032	3328533	I think it's going to be downsized.
3329294	3331056	Oh no, we never said cancelled.
3331436	3332577	Oh, okay, yeah, we did.
3332637	3335079	We said cancelled as we know it.
3336310	3341575	I have no doubt the ESA is going to do something, but the question is, is that something going to be good enough?
3341656	3342576	And that's what I ask you.
3342677	3344038	Is that something going to be good enough?
3345079	3345739	I don't know.
3346380	3347681	I think, I don't know.
3348242	3350304	It might be bad news for Nintendo and Sony.
3350344	3355389	Don't they have like these flashy plaz ads and everything to go all out for this thing?
3356405	3361587	Yes, but what's to stop Nintendo from doing a... Well, hell, they're doing their Fusion Tour.
3362127	3363788	I mean, they can take that stuff on the road.
3364208	3370670	And rumor is there was something going around on Kotaku or something saying that they were going to be doing a special tour.
3370710	3372391	I don't know if it was the Fusion Tour or something separate.
3372631	3374212	But they were going to take their show on the road.
3374252	3377693	There's nothing to stop Sony from doing something similar, having a huge event in LA.
3378133	3379974	All these guys could still do press conferences.
3380274	3383415	It's just going to be weird because E3 kind of brought it all together.
3384235	3389976	And now you're going to have, I think at least in 2007, you're just going to have a clusterfuck of all these random events.
3390316	3391357	It's going to be really weird.
3392157	3395198	That's going to be funny, all this clusterfuck of all these things.
3395758	3397618	It might be an interesting time in 2007.
3399298	3406020	True, but for us little guys who don't really have a travel budget, who like to bring the news to you guys, we're screwed.
3406917	3408158	I mean, maybe not so much us.
3408278	3410499	We're fortunate enough to be in the Bay Area-ish.
3410899	3415101	I mean, Bay Area is a 90-minute drive, so realistically we can get to most events over there pretty easy.
3415622	3421205	But, you know, I feel sorry for a lot of other folks who don't have that same luxury of being able to drive.
3421445	3422906	And not every company is in the Bay Area.
3422946	3427788	Some are in L.A., which is a little harder to get to, and some are in, you know what, Canada, other countries.
3427868	3432811	Hell, one of the nicest people we talked to at E3 this year were those folks from Spain that were developing the...
3433766	3434026	What was it?
3434046	3435767	It was like American Pie meets Grand Theft Auto.
3435787	3436888	I can't remember the name of the game now.
3437208	3438069	What was it called?
3438629	3439369	Summer something.
3439710	3441251	Summer Heat or something?
3441271	3445333	Yeah, it was funny because it had a guy stealing panties on the cover.
3445353	3445753	It was funny.
3445934	3448775	Anything else you want to share with our listeners, Raven Stolfen?
3449456	3451397	Yeah, you left this out of your note.
3451857	3454779	PSP got a firmware update.
3454819	3454999	Yeah, 2.8.
3455039	3456700	I thought we talked about that last week.
3456760	3458601	Yeah, go listen to last week's show, buddy.
3459742	3460362	It came out.
3460763	3461003	I mean...
3462034	3465776	Oh yeah, we didn't have it on the show roll tonight because we already talked about that it was coming out.
3466777	3467237	What do you think?
3467277	3467878	Did you download it?
3469019	3469959	It's on the PSP.
3469979	3471900	I have to put it in.
3472020	3474122	I didn't really have a chance to test it out yet.
3474222	3477244	Alright, call us back next week after you've tested it out because I haven't upgraded mine yet.
3477264	3477904	I'm a little lazy.
3478965	3479865	Oh, one more thing.
3479966	3480646	Yes.
3481006	3482947	About the PSP and the DS Lite sales.
3482967	3483368	Go for it.
3483488	3483628	Yeah.
3484873	3492677	Well, this is my opinion why the DS is doing better, because it's targeted to little kids and people that like things.
3492817	3494138	Nintendo's a little kid company.
3494218	3495058	I'm not being mean.
3495118	3496019	That's what they say.
3496899	3497179	Okay.
3498300	3499601	It's a family-friendly company.
3500281	3504243	Yeah, it's a family-friendly company, and when people see it, they go, oh, friendly.
3504623	3508045	But Sony has family-friendly stuff on it, too.
3509164	3513887	Well, yeah, but Sony's looking for that luxury liner.
3513947	3515227	They want you to get your money.
3515327	3517148	This thing is not cheap either.
3519049	3519350	All right.
3519530	3520670	Well, thanks for sharing your thoughts.
3520730	3521231	Appreciate it.
3521851	3523612	Sorry about the bad quality the first time.
3523632	3524412	That's okay.
3524832	3526533	It'll be edited out like it was never there.
3527114	3527654	Oh, thank you.
3527814	3529975	Our podcast listeners are going to go, what are they talking about?
3530436	3531516	That first call's not even there.
3531556	3532016	Have a good one.
3532577	3532877	You too.
3532897	3533097	Bye.
3534728	3538150	I just want our podcast folks to know we really don't edit a lot on the show.
3538190	3538750	We really don't.
3538770	3540151	We like to keep things pure here.
3540171	3544773	The only things we really edit out, dead air and bad Skype calls, and there's a really bad connection.
3544914	3546294	So just wanted you guys to know that.
3546354	3547235	All right, one more call.
3547755	3549276	It's another New Yorker, so this should be fun.
3550256	3551297	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3551317	3551637	Who's this?
3552367	3554088	It's one and only Legend of Zaku.
3554308	3555889	Oh, another New Yorker on the line.
3555949	3556410	Let me guess.
3556550	3557190	Digital Life?
3557350	3557911	New E3?
3557951	3559872	Yeah, of course.
3560592	3563514	That's the same thing as Ranma said.
3563594	3565075	Alright, then what are your thoughts on this?
3565115	3568398	Why is Digital Life to be the new E3 besides the fact it's in your backyard?
3568518	3573081	Basically, you're breaking down E3 and spreading it across the country.
3573121	3574962	That's pretty much what is going to happen next year.
3576551	3577512	I'm going to restate this.
3577572	3580654	I'm going to second the statements I already said.
3580754	3581494	It's a clusterfuck.
3581594	3601825	What will happen is that the elements that made E3 really successful in the earlier days, in the first few ones, like allowing the public to go in, is basically going to help the other smaller shows, which are going to steal E3's lightning like that.
3602817	3619369	and E3 on the other hand well now you know it's a wake-up call for them it's a wake-up call for the industry for the you know for the fact that this show went out it was just flooded with hype too much fat when basically the whole purpose of E3 was to focus on you know the hardcore content.
3619509	3621670	Zaku when was the public ever allowed in E3?
3622431	3624492	I think in the earlier days according to the Wikipedia.
3626681	3632366	It wasn't really that the public was allowed, but my understanding is it was pretty easy to get in.
3632586	3634428	Yes, that's basically what I'm saying.
3635008	3635829	Let me restate that.
3635869	3636930	It was a lot easier to get in.
3636950	3637790	Alright, fine, whatever.
3639352	3644055	So basically, by adding the element of having the public involved, then you build up hype.
3644095	3646177	You bring the hype to the people directly.
3646397	3652943	But at the same time, one of the dangers about that is that people are going to play these demos at E3 and then go, well, that game sucks.
3653886	3654286	Exactly.
3654326	3655587	And when it wasn't really half finished.
3655607	3658609	And the problem is that it's just too many people that aren't supposed to be there.
3659209	3664652	And that's one of the risks associated with letting, you know, opening a show of that magnitude to the public.
3664672	3665613	It'll be too crowded.
3666073	3667253	I want to hear from some developers.
3667313	3672336	I'm excited for tomorrow, Monday, because I'm excited to hear from some developers about what their plans are.
3672356	3672977	That's true.
3673717	3675559	God, I hope I have enough frequent flyer miles.
3689057	3690037	Yeah, that's true.
3690177	3695999	If anything, you could just outsource your reporting to other people online.
3696179	3704862	Hey, we've always said we would love to get reports from other people that can go to shows like this when we can't, but nobody does it.
3705702	3709323	Yeah, but this would be a good call to reiterate that.
3710264	3711484	Consider it reiterated.
3712524	3716085	You can email myself personally, or you'll mail the mailbag.
3716365	3717686	Hell, email Loki.
3718326	3719668	He'll say, sure, go for it.
3719748	3721710	Hey, email me.
3721750	3724192	But you do the mailbag, so I kind of already said that.
3724212	3724853	Yeah, email me anyway.
3724893	3726274	Hell, email 23rd Magus.
3726314	3727435	He'll make sure we find out.
3728276	3729758	Not like I get any other email anyway.
3729778	3732841	That's the best way to do it, by just spreading out, having a network.
3734722	3755087	and so basically it'll come down to that it'll be spread out when you're covering these shows follow the OL Army principle of don't be a dick and remember you don't represent Orange Lounge Radio I just want to let the listeners know that but if you want to send us fan stuff out there that you taped for us as a gift to us, go for it
3755820	3756180	Love it.
3756260	3757320	We'd love to get fan stuff in here.
3757340	3759221	You can count all these other guys as contributors.
3759481	3761642	That's basically what we'll become anyways.
3761662	3763142	Yeah, it works for me.
3763302	3764462	Nothing but good contributors.
3764642	3768404	All right, Zaku, then go to Digital Life with your camcorder and send us some stuff back, all right?
3768944	3771044	I'll get you something from there like I did last year.
3771524	3772765	Oh, that's right, our poster.
3773205	3774625	Remember from Digital Life last year.
3775205	3777306	All right, it's hanging up right here, right over Jamie's head.
3778401	3780702	In all of its illustrator glory.
3780742	3784063	Hanging right next to the Jay and Silent Bob, all you motherfuckers are going to pay.
3784103	3785764	You are the one who's going to wear the Bollickers poster.
3785784	3788185	Alright, Zaku, have a good one.
3788745	3789445	Alright, you too.
3789505	3789845	Bye.
3796048	3798028	Well, that was an animated Skype line tonight.
3798989	3800409	Half the calls were from New York City.
3801490	3802370	I love New York City.
3802430	3803570	Not a problem in New York City.
3803590	3805031	I'm looking forward to going there very soon.
3805271	3806291	New York City!
3806952	3807832	Somebody get a rope.
3808844	3812085	I haven't been to New York since I was in high school.
3812445	3813245	It's a fun place.
3813505	3814466	I played at Carnegie Hall.
3814546	3816166	There's always stuff to do in New York City.
3816266	3816666	It's true.
3817626	3820767	Any last minute stories before we get into the final story of the night?
3824428	3825088	I don't think so.
3825148	3826769	Then I guess we go to the final story of the night.
3828289	3829289	Sorry, I did have one.
3829429	3829750	You lie!
3831986	3833266	No, I was not lying.
3833627	3835267	It's impossible!
3835547	3841949	I was going to mention there's a demo out there now if you have upgraded your PSP the firmware 2.8 for Mercury Meltdown.
3842449	3843770	So you can check that out for free.
3846471	3848071	I don't know, I thought that was kind of neat.
3849572	3852292	Not a reason I would go and upgrade mine to 2.8.
3852593	3853833	Although I should because...
3855390	3856810	I don't know, I have nothing better to do with it.
3857291	3858851	But yeah, check it out.
3859451	3862592	Anyways, no, that's it.
3864613	3866333	All right, then let's go to our last story of the evening.
3866853	3875016	Let's talk about what's wrong with this world and why Brazil just couldn't win the World Cup.
3875796	3878877	Well, the reason why they couldn't win the World Cup?
3880137	3881678	Sex and PlayStation 2.
3882998	3883699	That's right.
3884179	3885099	At least that's what they're blaming.
3885532	3887713	And I thought that was kind of funny.
3889793	3890234	Anywho.
3892955	3909860	Yeah, so apparently the reason why there are lead footballers out there getting too sexed up, which is apparently, I guess, against their rules during the World Cup, and playing too much FIFA 06 on PlayStation 2.
3911621	3914262	Good at the game, but not good at the actual game.
