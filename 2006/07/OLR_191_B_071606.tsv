490	5575	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5895	14744	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15464	19088	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19582	20022	Orange Lounge Radio
49551	52052	Because I have a video game story I'd like to share first.
52112	53133	Is that okay, DarkSakura?
53333	53993	It's about the Wii!
54653	55194	I guess.
55274	55594	Alright.
56534	57175	This is interesting.
57595	64218	Toys R Us in Australia is taking pre-orders for the Wii at what equates to $249 US.
64878	68900	But what's very interesting about this deal is that that comes with a free game.
69260	72502	So folks are speculating that this is pretty much proving...
72782	73503	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
90157	91198	Perfect Pack and Title.
91238	95602	That would be for the Wii because that would give you a little taste of everything what the Wii can do.
96182	100206	And, you know, if you think about it, that's one thing that they kind of sold to the Nintendo press conference as well.
100586	102748	Remember that guy who won the contest?
103028	106912	Remember when they flew all those guys to LA and then only let one come up on stage to play?
107632	109554	It was Wii Sports, the tennis game.
109954	112917	And Wii Tennis, I mean, it's fun, but it's not...
113522	114142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
139218	140998	That you could just put on this collection.
141078	142819	And maybe not even call it Wii Sports.
142859	145700	Just have it, I don't know, be something.
146560	150261	Mori in our chatroom seems to think that World Class TrackMe needs to have a Wii version.
152581	155582	I honestly think that Wii Sports sort of smacks of the Super Scope games.
156722	157102	How so?
157702	163924	It just had the multi-games to show off the different things you could play with the Super Scope, like Blastress and that really weird mole game.
164504	165724	Yeah, I like the mole game, though.
165844	166844	It just makes me think of that.
167225	168805	Okay.
168825	168865	Um...
169690	171671	Alright, well that's all I have to say on that story for the Wii.
172111	179314	Okay, well speaking of the Wii, there's been another secret flap that's been spotted.
179454	182615	Oh, is this like the third or fourth secret flap that's on the Wii?
183535	189818	Boy, the Wii must sure be feeling like it's getting violated all over left and right with people looking in every flap they can find.
189858	191138	The Wii has compartments everywhere.
191278	191598	I see.
192039	194419	But no idea what it is.
195220	197781	Looks like a SD card port, but...
199195	200915	It's a really odd position for it.
200975	201815	Let me put it that way.
203136	204056	What do I think it is?
204736	206716	I think it might be just nothing.
207537	210197	I think it's just maybe... It's a flap for nothing?
210317	211977	I think it actually is not a flap.
212017	218759	I think it's just kind of a hole that would be for... Because it's at the very, very bottom of the console.
218979	226220	I mean, if this were going to be in their little docking bay or whatever it is, I don't think you'd be able to...
228064	237547	Access this panel, but my guess is it's probably just for the docking stations, probably a clip, you know, so the whole thing snaps in so it doesn't come loose.
238428	239388	That's my thought on that.
239488	239848	I don't know.
240628	241469	No idea what it is.
242109	243309	But to be honest, I don't care.
243569	245990	It's not like some super-duper secret thing.
246290	248591	Yeah, VR is hidden in the tiny little thing right there.
248691	252553	Yeah, I don't think these flaps are going to have these earth-shattering new features.
252613	256674	I think it's just going to be for plugs, cards, you know, things you can stick in your Wii.
257602	264024	Because, yeah, even looking at this right now, the actual picture that they show of this said flap doesn't even look like a flap.
264504	270927	It just looks like a part in the console where it might snap in.
271367	272387	That's all it is.
272907	273087	Yeah.
274328	274588	All right.
275188	283191	Now, DarkSakura, I know you have some stuff you want to share with the Wii with us, too, but I also understand you have a special shout-out you want to give, so please get that out before you move on.
284198	288079	To one of, actually, my really good friend's friend.
288940	289780	Her name is Larissa.
289900	292081	She was in a car accident a few days ago.
292121	294621	I'd like to give a big shout out.
295702	299003	I don't think she's listening, being that she's currently in the hospital.
299063	305205	But for anyone who's listening, who knows her, pass on that we wish her a very quick recovery and glad she's coming out of it okay.
305625	306185	Absolutely.
306305	310246	Hope you get out of the hospital fast, because I know hospitals are not a fun place to be.
310306	311227	So please get well soon.
311647	312067	Very much.
313393	324140	Well, as far as the story that I have, there's actually some more games being mentioned that's coming out for Wii, actually specifically from EA.
325060	332425	Well, there's also Need for Speed Carbon and Madden NFL, but they're also announcing Tiger Woods, Godfather, SSX, and Harry Potter coming out.
333686	334527	I wouldn't mind, you know.
334847	337630	Oh, goody, am I going to get to cast spells with the Wii controller?
337810	340552	That would actually be cool, you know, if you have to wave it a certain way.
340632	342254	What was the little... You're a Harry Potter nerd.
342274	344816	What's the little spell... Give me some of the spells they say.
344876	347639	Like, what makes the light... Luminos or something.
347659	348119	What do they say?
348139	348539	Lumos.
348800	349220	Lumos?
349460	349720	Yeah.
349740	350821	Can you imagine being able to do that?
351142	353144	And if the Wii had a microphone in it, too?
353164	353924	That would be perfect.
354845	355726	Use voice recognition.
355746	356286	Oh, my gosh.
356567	359029	Harry Potter fangirls everywhere are going to, like...
359690	360150	Never Leave the House.
360170	361591	Isn't that going to be a microphone attachment?
362091	364732	Yeah, they say that the Wii... Well, I don't think it's confirmed.
364752	365632	It has a speaker in it.
365672	371935	We all know that from E3, but it's rumored that a speaker could easily be a microphone, so why not have a microphone on it, too?
371995	376077	I don't think we have confirmation on that yet, though, but imagine if it did have a microphone.
376117	384380	You could, you know, say, you know, Luminos and move the thing, and then you might even hear the spell come from the wand, and it would even vibrate.
384700	385661	How crazy is that?
385781	386561	That would be special.
387558	388698	Special Ed.
389178	394799	You might need to go Ruminous for it to... It doesn't understand some of the... That's right.
394879	397420	If it's going to be like brain training where you have to say, Brew!
397940	398340	Brew!
398860	399260	Ruminous!
399300	399820	I swear it works.
399880	400541	I swear it works.
400561	403141	Go back to the OLR archives where I review brain training.
403461	404101	It really works.
404141	409382	If you are having a hard time getting your DS to understand you saying Brew, say Brew, and it works every time.
410062	410503	At least for me.
410763	411423	Exactly.
411963	412943	So that's pretty awesome.
414357	416419	Some of those games I'm actually pretty cool.
416559	418021	I wonder how SXX is going to control.
418582	420204	Maybe Godfather you could just go around shooting people.
420624	425770	I think it's really interesting with all these Wii game announcements that our first thoughts are, I wonder what it's going to play like on the Wii.
425810	431117	I wonder what that controller is going to do for that game or how that's going to be different because of that whole Wii thing.
431477	439681	This is very interesting how... I hope they're good because all it's going to take is a couple games that suck with that kind of controller configuration for people to go, ah, damn it.
439741	441681	But every console has shitty games.
441842	443122	I say the other way around.
443242	447504	If you have a few stellar games, it's really going to sell that console.
447724	450665	There's a lot of crap games on every console.
451085	452226	It doesn't ruin it for them.
452626	459189	PS2, wonderful console, legendary console will be remembered for years and years, has some real shit games on it.
459882	461303	You know what's something that's occurring to me?
461963	465424	There's mentioning a Tiger Woods game, but what's stopping them from making MoCap Golf?
466845	468265	Or even Police 911?
469426	469826	With the Wii?
470686	470986	Maybe?
472267	476168	I think those are franchises that our developer friends should be looking into.
476673	492848	Speaking of the Wii, though, and other fun things about it, IGN has actually come in contact with a Wii developer documentation, like kind of a little pamphlet that basically explains to developers how the Wii works and some of the fun little details about it.
494338	502103	One of the things that's pretty interesting is there's going to be six kilobytes of non-volatile memory in each controller.
502983	511088	And the speculation is that it's possible that that will be for storing player settings.
511408	518032	So if you're a person that uses Controller 1 all the time, it's going to remember your settings, and that's kind of neat.
520287	527729	Other than that, they're also mentioning that the sensor bar itself is only going to be about 20 centimeters long.
528589	536652	And pretty much the LEDs, I guess, on the Wii controller and stuff are going to be for battery life and show you that kind of stuff.
537352	545474	And also that light sources from fluorescent halogen plastic mirrors and many more interfere with the actual pointer.
545979	546479	Oh, interesting.
547180	550542	But to eliminate this, though, the actual... Don't play in a spaceship.
551263	556446	No, to eliminate this, it says the pointer must identify the sensor bar and mark its two coordinates.
556947	568055	And when pointing with the Wiimote, the unit is actually interfacing with the sensor bar, which translates the data to the television and, in effect, simulating a direct aim to the television.
568075	568115	So...
569579	581532	In a sense, it's basically comparing it to an eye measuring the coordinates between 0 and 1023 on the x-axis and 0 and 767 on the y-axis.
581652	585797	So it's basically seeing a megapixel image or something like that.
585977	586958	So it's kind of neat.
587939	590102	And it says the pointer could sub as a camera.
590993	592614	It's probably like a Pokemon Snap game.
592634	595935	Boy, that controller will do your dishes pretty soon with all these things they keep saying.
596035	604057	I can't wait for the third party controllers to come out and you know some perverted Japanese company out there is going to turn like Wii controller and sex toy.
605118	605638	It's going to happen.
605678	606738	Hello Kitty Wii.
608399	608759	We'll see.
609959	615901	Anyway, Nintendo, one of their biggest franchises is Pokemon and still after all these years, Pokemon has some very loyal fans.
616702	617542	Very, very loyal fans.
617884	623507	Diamond and Pearl is coming out very soon, and a lot of folks have been asking, when is Pokemon going to go online?
623567	626208	Well, it looks like it's going to be happening soon.
626268	633652	There are some scans from Famitsu that show Pokemon Diamond and Pearl with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection logo.
634512	641456	Now, they have said before that the game would support Wi-Fi, but it was unclear if that meant local Wi-Fi or internet Wi-Fi.
642023	642584	Internet Wi-Fi
660768	661848	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
690919	691959	To make an MMO out of?
692039	692560	I mean, really?
692840	695161	You know, go out, collect monsters, fight other trainers?
695481	697361	It's just a matter of finding a good concept.
697561	698682	Isn't it kind of surprising?
699022	700242	I mean, it is and it isn't.
700262	702123	Nintendo really doesn't do MMOs.
702143	702763	They never have.
703223	707425	But really, here's the perfect opportunity for them to get into the MMO.
707465	708926	And I bet it would be a really big game.
709466	711947	I wonder why they're holding back.
711987	714728	I mean, maybe the Wii will see something new.
714808	716988	But do you think Pokemon could work as an MMO?
717449	717769	I don't know.
717789	718509	I don't like Pokemon.
719417	720318	I think it would work very well
743124	743564	Pokemon Snap
772020	773061	I love Pokemon Snap.
773821	776383	Pokemon's a great concept, the whole monster collecting.
776443	779204	I mean, it's a great franchise.
779705	782026	Yeah, the cartoon, I may be over it now.
782046	784748	I used to watch the cartoon a long time ago, and I think I'm kind of over it now.
785842	787062	Maybe I'd watch it once in a while.
787122	787823	It's like a funny thing.
787983	789323	It's a stoner cartoon now.
790183	790683	Maybe.
790763	791404	I could see that.
791524	793524	Dude, man, he's talking!
793604	794865	Pikachu!
794965	795825	Pikachu!
795865	796765	Pikachu!
797485	797745	Maybe.
797785	798105	I don't know.
798465	799766	But the games are neat.
800646	804987	The problem is, for me, the games have so much more potential than what Nintendo's doing with it.
805647	806428	That's just my opinion.
806588	806888	I don't know.
807328	808268	I like Pokemon Pinball, though.
809164	809784	Neo Geo Battle Coliseum
833986	834487	What am I saying?
834507	835808	I'm a fangirl of just about any game.
837129	838750	We're going to be getting it by Ignition.
838790	843353	It's actually going to be out in Europe on PS2 in the autumn.
845515	852720	Basically what Battle Coliseum is, it's a fighting in which players use different characters from a range of SNK.
854101	859926	Different games like World of Heroes, Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown, Last Blade, Metal Slug, Kizuna Encounter.
861813	867576	and you'll have your regular fighting modes, but you'll also have tag battle.
868057	870578	It's sort of making me think of King of Fighters, but not quite.
870998	886487	There's also a rumor of six different hidden characters, but it's actually going to be out with other games like King of Fighters 11, King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2, SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters, and Metal Slug Anthology.
886507	890710	That'd be awesome as if that game, one of the hidden fighters, is Magical Lord.
891971	892471	Remember that game?
892531	893372	That game was awesome.
894832	901456	That's what I used to play when they had those Neo Geo machines down at Rayleigh's or something like that.
901496	903097	We need hidden characters to be Bub and Bob.
903497	904277	You know what they need to do?
904457	911921	They need to take this and kind of make another Capcom vs. SNK and actually put some of the characters like Mel's characters and stuff.
912741	917484	I've been hearing rumors about DC vs. Capcom.
918384	919265	Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.
920265	921706	I think it's still a rumor, but
922903	926226	They should actually do DC vs. Marvel as a fighting game.
926406	927247	That would be tough.
927307	930930	I don't think either one of those comic companies would want to do something like that.
931050	932852	But I'm sure Capcom would love to make that game.
933112	934494	They were together before.
935114	940119	Eddie in our chatroom seems to think that the listeners should rally together to make an Orange Lounge radio card game.
941826	942586	I don't think there's enough.
942786	943967	Our own collectible card game.
944007	947468	You would have to really go back into the show's history to get enough people.
947648	959333	I mean, granted, there's the three of us that host the show, and obviously Mikotov's here half the time, and even in recent memory we've had some other guests, but really we haven't had the orgy of guests we used to have during some of our live shows back in the day.
959653	961614	You'd have to way go back to some of our old members.
961854	963455	They do it in Magic, where you have your fire...
966772	968273	Fire Jamie, Earth Jamie Battle of the Portable Systems
993066	996969	The DS has actually overtaken the PSP in sales in the United States.
997449	1004314	So, now Sony can't brag that the PSP is at least winning in the United States because they're getting their ass handed to them now.
1005595	1017063	Sales, though, overall in video games have gone up about 25%, but in the sold units, as far as the two consoles are concerned, the Nintendo DS is right now over $5,200.
1020922	1021883	The PSP is currently at 4.7 million units.
1039642	1045845	Yeah, basically the DS Lite kind of pushed them over the limit there.
1046265	1048987	And lots of new games, of course, coming out for the DS.
1049367	1055110	And to be honest, the PSP hasn't had that many great releases lately, so it's kind of hurting.
1055330	1058171	But you watch when Vice City Stories comes out.
1058331	1058791	Oh, yeah.
1059592	1067936	But anyways, beyond that, though, the Xbox 360 has finally reached 2 million units in the United States about time.
1069264	1098851	and of course the Playstation 2 is still selling pretty strong they sold another 300,000 units in June alone and puts the total up to about 34 million units in the United States which is almost as many Game Boy Advance units out there they're up to almost 33 million Game Boy Advance of course now if you think about it how many Game Boy Advance systems have there been I mean there's tons of different reiterations so that's pretty cool that sounds pretty cool
1100034	1106776	Well, as far as things that are coming out, we actually have our Europe release dates, if anybody is interested.
1107536	1109896	I know our European listeners would probably be very interested.
1110016	1124679	I've noticed we've actually had an increase in the amount of listeners coming from Europe lately, and part of the reason for that, as I understand it, is that folks over there are very appreciative that we are an American gaming show that is willing to acknowledge that there's other people around the world that play video games.
1124759	1127960	So, thank you guys for recognizing what we try to recognize.
1128467	1129948	I love hearing from our UK listeners.
1129968	1130388	They're great.
1130488	1131308	I love hearing from everywhere.
1131329	1132229	It doesn't have to be UK.
1132249	1133570	It can be anywhere.
1133970	1137832	We've gotten emails from all over the world and I'm always looking forward to it.
1138032	1139933	Especially Canada lately because I was just there.
1141594	1142774	I'm on a Canada kick lately.
1142914	1143435	Oh, Canada.
1143815	1145596	I have to give you one of the maple cookies I got there.
1145716	1146316	So good.
1146396	1146656	Okay.
1146736	1148797	I'm going to go get one right now while you do the next story.
1151019	1151579	Addict, huh?
1152659	1152960	Okay.
1153040	1156301	What we have coming out though, just a handful of games on the 21st.
1156321	1156361	Uh,
1158360	1160121	The following three are on PSP.
1160161	1169224	We have Def Jam, Fight for New York, The Takeover, Field Commander, Me Sneezing, and no, Jamie Sneezing the game isn't.
1169344	1169664	Okay.
1170244	1170644	Cookie.
1171004	1171224	Okay.
1171945	1172165	Okay.
1172545	1174125	We have, oh, God, I smell like syrup.
1174805	1175546	They're hella good.
1175646	1176266	Sorry, guys.
1176546	1177026	Back to game.
1177106	1178007	Sorry.
1178027	1179307	These cookies are the shit.
1179987	1180847	I think we have another list.
1180887	1182528	I think one of our listeners is in Vancouver.
1182568	1184109	I'm going to make him send me more of these cookies.
1184389	1185349	They are so freaking good.
1186377	1186897	Anyway, sorry.
1187037	1188017	My eyes are rolling back in my head.
1188037	1188658	They are good.
1188678	1188938	Sorry.
1189338	1189678	Okay.
1190318	1191078	As I was saying.
1191698	1192558	Sorry, UK listeners.
1193939	1198080	For PSP, we have Def Jam, Fight for New York, The Takeover, Field Commander, and Infected.
1199200	1202100	Coming out on PlayStation 2, we have Super World Police.
1203241	1211423	Some things to look forward to, though, the next week is Juiced Eliminator, Pac-Man World 3, Civ 4, Civ City Rome.
1212903	1213243	Lots of...
1213891	1214891	Pretty cool stuff coming out.
1214971	1218732	Actually, Shin Megami Tensei and The Ant Bully.
1220032	1220472	Pretty cool.
1221353	1222813	Okay, Miami Vice is on here.
1223153	1223773	What's the point?
1224253	1225654	They're doing a Miami Vice movie.
1225674	1226374	Yeah, it's movie time.
1226654	1228094	I know, but still, what's the point?
1229354	1231955	Pastel suits should have stayed gone in the 80s.
1232415	1234016	Okay, that's my tangent.
1235196	1235496	Okay.
1236236	1239377	Anyways, in the U.S., similar stuff.
1240037	1240577	Not a whole lot.
1241328	1251794	But if you are ready for some football, NCAA Football 07 is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and the PSP.
1252454	1253515	So check those out.
1253995	1261099	If you're not a fan of football, you may be a fan of CG animated movies, in which case Monster House will be the game for you.
1261199	1267423	That comes out on PlayStation 2, GameCube, the DS, and the Game Boy Advance.
1268170	1273454	And if you're not a fan of either of those, maybe you're a fan of Super Dragon Ball Z, which is coming out on PlayStation 2.
1274836	1284123	Then, of course, there's Blade Dancer on the PSP, Valkyrie Profile, Lineth, which is a remake of the very first Valkyrie Profile on the PSP.
1284583	1288086	And Miami Vice is also coming out on the PSP.
1288126	1291569	And that was a PSP-only title, which was kind of interesting, but it looks pretty decent.
1291729	1293391	So be sure to check it out.
1296913	1297314	Anyways...
1300131	1304173	and... Did you want to say something on The Sims 2?
1304353	1305094	Oh, I'm sorry.
1306374	1308215	I did want to mention something.
1308515	1313418	We have two listeners from Vancouver in chat, so I'm reminiscing my trip and telling them where to get the cookies.
1313886	1315267	Jamie and I are eating right now.
1315287	1318030	Those cookies are addicting.
1318070	1318930	There's a farmer's market.
1318950	1320972	They do this little island called Granville Island.
1321553	1321853	You know what?
1321873	1323154	I'm sorry to turn this into cookie chat.
1323174	1325736	Just do your game thing.
1325936	1327898	I thought I would like to talk about something.
1328538	1331341	GameSpot actually, they had their kind of retail radar thing.
1331941	1340789	I think it was actually a rumor control article that they had about during E3, EA had a game coming out called Sims 2 Pets.
1341548	1367355	and Sims 2 Pets was supposed to be this PC only kind of almost like an expansion for the Sims 2 but I can confirm now today that Sims 2 Pets is actually coming to the consoles and you'll be able to play that here pretty soon it is coming coming out here I believe was it towards the fourth quarter and
1368834	1369455	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1392635	1394396	Are you going to try and murder the pets like you murder people?
1394416	1395917	I am going to check this game out.
1396117	1404843	Especially on the PC, because if you can kill it... I mean, granted, that's morbid, but I killed the Sims, so... You know, GS191 in chat has an excellent point, though.
1405223	1406544	He has a message to EA here.
1406684	1408625	Stop making the Sims and work on Spore.
1410466	1411667	They are working on Spore.
1412107	1413248	But I like Spore more.
1413628	1416910	Even from the demos I've seen, I'm like, Spore!
1417370	1419051	Need Spore now!
1419651	1420312	Give it to me!
1421238	1423600	Seriously, that game is going to be a serious crack for people.
1423820	1426461	If you think The Sims is bad, just wait for Spore.
1426621	1427082	I'm telling you.
1427102	1429923	Spore is... That's all people are going to be talking about next year.
1430103	1434546	People in China are going to be killing themselves for spending too much time on there.
1434566	1439249	They're going to leave babies in hot cars and not feed them and all that fun stuff.
1440165	1441486	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1460702	1461663	Mario stuff.
1461703	1463965	But here, they're putting these characters into the game.
1464405	1470850	Moogle, White Mage, Ninja, Black Mage, and a Cactar named Sabotender.
1471310	1474553	So we're not sure quite what that means yet, but at least you're getting a Cactar.
1474613	1475253	So that's kind of cool.
1475573	1478636	Makes me think of this great overlooked PS1 title.
1478676	1479717	At least I like this game.
1479757	1483379	I don't think a lot of people did, but Chocobo Racing was a game they had on PS1.
1483439	1485000	It was kind of like a Mario Kart type game.
1485341	1489184	But you could be like White Mage or Black Mage or a Chocobo and you could actually unlock...
1489983	1493944	You could unlock Squall, I think was one, and I want to say you got Cloud at some point, too.
1494264	1495244	You could unlock all these characters.
1495264	1496445	It was actually a fun little racer.
1496825	1499226	I really wish they'd revisit that concept.
1499846	1501086	I think it was a cute little game.
1502586	1508668	My message to Square and Nintendo, stop working on Mario Hoops.
1509288	1510849	No one cares about Mario Hoops.
1511609	1514590	I care about a new Super Mario RPG.
1515010	1518391	That's what Nintendo and Square Enix should be working on, is not...
1519321	1520922	Stupid basketball game, whatever.
1522702	1523282	But fine.
1523542	1524883	At least they're doing something new.
1525163	1526123	I can't complain, I guess.
1526563	1527544	But I will.
1527884	1528444	I will complain.
1529464	1531765	Anyways, on a completely different topic, though.
1532185	1534506	And it actually kind of follows with more complaining.
1535727	1544690	Some of the ex-frag dolls are attacking the whole sponsorships of gaming teams and Girl Gamers topic.
1544890	1546750	And it's kind of interesting, though.
1547931	1548611	And basically...
1549346	1555809	Quote here from them, Although we may have strong opinions, you can be sure of one thing.
1555909	1558430	We're not here to endorse any product or sell you anything.
1558810	1562672	If we say it, it's because we mean it, not because it pays our wage.
1563092	1573877	And kind of, you know, basically attacking the frag dolls and those girl gaming teams, especially the ones that are sponsored by Ubisoft or Microsoft, etc.
1574037	1576058	Anyways, I'm going to get back more into this here.
1577728	1584371	On a similar note, we may be both girls who game, but we are not here to wave the girl gamer flag.
1584411	1589773	We believe that drawing attention to the gender, you create a barrier that's otherwise irrelevant.
1590133	1603839	In our experience, promoting girl gamers can often be used as a cover story of big business, but trying to widen its market share while still getting some pretty faces in the magazines.
1603900	1605500	In other words, free advertising.
1605660	1606901	So, they're kind of a
1607605	1612408	Coming out and saying that these girl gamer groups are nothing more than a marketing ploy and they suck.
1615811	1617652	I don't really know what to think about all this stuff anymore.
1617812	1620274	I'm just like, just shut up and play games.
1620614	1620935	I don't care.
1620955	1625978	Because I want to tell a lot of these people, you know, the people that are passionate on both sides of it is like, make it about the games.
1626478	1627379	Let's just go back to the games.
1628060	1631242	Seriously, when it needs to come back down to, it needs to come to
1631943	1632744	Thanks for watching!
1652151	1656714	That should be all that matters, unfortunately, if you are on the receiving end of the discrimination.
1657375	1664461	Yeah, but as a homosexual, I've been on somewhat the receiving end of that discrimination before, too.
1664982	1667784	Having to put up with a lot of MMOs, you know, that's gay and this is gay.
1668084	1675711	And I don't let that kind of talk really get to me, but I know that it's tough for any type of minority, really.
1676071	1677933	But I don't know.
1677973	1679254	At the same time, it's like,
1680083	1686907	Because of the internet, in a way, people can be people that they're really not, at least in an MMO.
1686947	1688808	Guys can play girls, girls can play guys.
1688848	1692110	It's a great way for everybody to be anonymous.
1692170	1694751	You don't know what's sitting behind an Xbox Live gamer tag.
1694791	1699174	Sure, you can hear a voice, but even then, some people play Xbox Live and don't use their voice.
1699314	1699814	Or mask it.
1700374	1702596	Well, you can't do that on 360, but the old school one you could.
1702616	1703056	On the old one, yeah.
1703176	1703417	Yeah.
1703797	1704377	Even though it was awful.
1704518	1709321	But, you know, I knew a guy in college that had a really, really high-pitched voice and sounded like a girl.
1710762	1715826	Yeah, and a lot of Xbox Live sounds like that, too, where you don't know what gender it is because it's so ridiculous.
1715906	1718108	I'm going to poke you, noob.
1718128	1719789	You know, you can't tell really what they're saying.
1719809	1720890	They all sound the same.
1720970	1721911	Everybody sounds the same.
1722692	1728156	Actually, if it's on PSO, you get your own feedback first before you hear everybody else's.
1729360	1730581	and join the OL Army.
1730861	1734763	We're all about, you know, just shut up and play the game.
1734823	1739105	It doesn't matter what you look like, who you sleep with, what gender you are.
1739165	1739666	It doesn't matter.
1739826	1740266	It doesn't matter.
1740406	1742547	Just play a game and have fun and don't be a dick.
1743187	1743748	Exactly.
1743808	1744628	And speaking of the OL Army.
1744648	1745909	That's rule number one of the OL Army.
1745949	1746489	Don't be a dick.
1747810	1748350	Or a twat.
1749591	1751252	He said twat.
1751332	1754773	Speaking of things, though, that are super cool.
1754973	1755154	Yes.
1756294	1757875	You know, blah, blah, blah.
1758678	1759259	Tungtai today.
1788901	1810830	and basically that's the OLR army and we're looking for anybody that's got a mech in the game doesn't matter what you know you're playing that's all good and there is a password though up up down down is the password I couldn't add the rest of the Konami code because there's just not enough space for it but up up down down is the password to get in and don't be a dick
1811414	1812135	and Don'tBeADick.
1812435	1813516	You can be a dick to other people.
1813636	1815157	That's perfectly fine in the game.
1815177	1817039	Don't be a dick to each other.
1817079	1819281	We totally approve of smack talking in the game.
1819321	1820442	That's fine.
1821583	1823044	Because after all, you're all on a team.
1823424	1824425	Be excellent to each other.
1824945	1825446	Party on.
1827568	1828789	Are we going to party on?
1829169	1830150	So can I do my thing now?
1830170	1830630	Yes, you may.
1830670	1830991	You may.
1831211	1832232	Yes, you may do your thing.
1832252	1833553	Do you need your music for your thing?
1833833	1834213	I do.
1834273	1835334	I feel incomplete without it.
1837856	1838297	Yay.
1838397	1839498	It's all happy and cute.
1841941	1849685	So, I have been hanging out on the interwebs, and actually this is one that was brought to my attention at California Extreme.
1849805	1854647	It's, uh, go to www.thefutureofpinball.com.
1855247	1857048	Yeah, again, I'm still stuck on pinball.
1857508	1861450	But this, um, actually we watched their, uh, little, uh,
1862438	1862978	DarkSakura.com
1891508	1898831	Because pinball, basically, the way that the pinball industry was staying going was the fact that you have this machine that does this.
1898911	1901152	Okay, now we have to make this machine obsolete.
1901492	1902913	Our competition is ourself.
1903493	1908455	Because, I mean, once, you know, we lost Capcom, and Williams basically only had themselves.
1909135	1917179	To keep, you know, to keep that whole area open, they had to basically make their old machines obsolete and make new things that people wanted to do.
1917199	1920100	So Pinball 2000 was how they were going to revive the whole...
1921571	1946862	pinball industry except they decided to close it down anyway now they make casino machines but this it was it was very cool it also has some footage of some very rare machines like this I think it's called pinball carnival or something to that effect but it's basically like a multi-layer pinball machine we have to work about getting it to the top of the thing
1947462	1949423	It's a very cool, very cool, very big machine.
1950363	1952463	But lots of really cool stuff.
1952683	1963426	If you're into pinball, if you're into video games in general, because the other good thing about this is that it brings in techniques that were actually incorporated into some of the old games, like the... What was the update to Space Invaders?
1964226	1967267	Where you have the background behind it, but the thing projected over it.
1967507	1970188	I don't remember, but yeah, I know what game you're talking about, though.
1970748	1970908	But...
1972409	1972970	It's very cool.
1973030	1974090	I suggest checking it out again.
1974190	1975991	It's thefutureofpinball.com.
1976311	1979933	I think this guy's movie is supposed to be out around October, I want to say.
1980593	1982134	So check out the trailer.
1982194	1982814	Lots of good stuff.
1983475	1984095	Very interesting.
1985316	1985996	Excellent.
1987237	1988137	And speaking about...
1988703	1990305	The next generation of stuff.
1991185	1997331	Microsoft, of course, revealed this week their brand new media player called the Zune.
1997751	1999353	And no, it's not meant for games.
2000033	2003056	But it does look very similar to an iPod, kind of.
2003296	2005358	I mean, it's got a giant screen on it though.
2005619	2011404	But it's basically going to be used for just playing games and
2012469	2013329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2034434	2041862	Supposedly, this isn't the only device that they're releasing as part of that, so maybe a portable gaming device out there, but not this one.
2042143	2044746	So the Zune is not a gaming device.
2048290	2052014	Moving on to a completely different topic in regards to Sony and the Blu-ray.
2052074	2055478	This is kind of an iffy thing because it came through Internet Movie Database, but
2055854	2061140	A Chinese newspaper is reporting that Sony is having some major problems with Blu-ray production.
2062282	2069670	Supposedly, production facilities are not being able to meet the demand for the diode that generates the blue laser that puts the blue in Blu-ray.
2070171	2074876	And apparently, Sony's own plants and some at Nisha Corp.
2074896	2075337	in Japan
2075757	2078798	have been having run-ins regarding supply shortcoming.
2079119	2084881	This may not only affect the supply of DVD players' Blu-ray, but it might also affect the PlayStation 3.
2085781	2087882	So, I don't know.
2088243	2090263	Could be running into some delay problems with PlayStation 3.
2090363	2095186	Delays or possibly low yields might even have a huge shortage.
2095286	2097467	More of a shortage than the Xbox 360.
2097527	2100208	People thought, you know, the Xbox 360 launch was botched.
2101348	2102329	You ain't seen nothing yet.
2104950	2105170	Okay.
2105854	2110196	Well, you know there's supposed to be a Pirates MMO?
2111696	2112397	Pirates of the Caribbean?
2112597	2112777	Yep.
2113737	2116878	Well, they're saying that there's going to be user-submitted content.
2118399	2130184	Now, as far as user-submitted content, I'm really not sure how that's going to be feasible in-game, honestly.
2130824	2133025	I'm going to go ahead and read this quote here off of Kotaku.
2134597	2137829	It simply cannot be the case that Flying Lab meant what they say above.
2137889	2139173	Basically, what they were saying...
2139810	2144913	is that they're going to let you put in user-submitted and peer-reviewed content.
2146614	2166605	But to get back into the quote, the developers must intend to have a high degree of control over the designs that make their way into the world because it is a certainty that if they don't want the entire Port Royal Harbor to look like T-shirts at a fanfare with sales that feature large-breasted elven princesses, Darth Vader in a jaunty pirate hat, and slogans like minus 50 DKP or WTS...
2167865	2170869	That's great.
2170889	2171550	That's a great quote.
2172451	2175816	How many freaking Jack Sparrows are going to be on that game?
2175876	2177939	How many Sephiroths are in Final Fantasy XI?
2178139	2179661	Captain Jack Sephiroth.
2181318	2182259	I will kill you all.
2182519	2182980	And Lakot.
2184140	2186562	I think the idea... I'm going to be honest.
2186602	2189725	I'm probably the only person in the world that has not seen either Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
2190746	2193668	But I still think the concept of this MMO game is kind of cool.
2193748	2199013	Except it does make me cry a little bit because Puzzle Pirates was such the cutest little MMO.
2199473	2200434	And you know, there's been...
2200754	2201855	There's still Puzzle Pirates.
2220034	2221335	Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates
2250526	2251307	Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates
2265982	2268443	Xbox Live Arcade is going to get a free game.
2268844	2271785	That's right, you too can play Texas Hold'em for free.
2272225	2276427	It's coming out August 23rd and it will be free.
2276507	2277948	That's in no money.
2278849	2281090	So be sure to check it out when it comes out.
2281390	2284432	It's going to support tournaments and 8 players online.
2284952	2286953	So it looks like Microsoft wants to get you gambling.
2287753	2288674	Sounds pretty cool.
2289194	2292576	I think if I remember correctly, I think this game also supported the live vision camera.
2292656	2294937	So that would be kind of neat too.
2295993	2300156	There's actually another demo on Xbox 360.
2300977	2302558	That's the Lord of the Rings demo.
2303518	2307081	The Battle for Middle Earth 2 is actually on Xbox Live Marketplace now.
2307661	2310883	It's at 148.84 megabytes.
2310904	2311524	That's pretty funny.
2312284	2314526	And has a single and multiplayer available.
2315407	2317108	Has a tutorial to tell you how to play it.
2319450	2322131	Actually, there's also First Mission available on there, too.
2322312	2322432	It's...
2323340	2327783	and lots of themes have also been made available on the marketplace too.
2328923	2331865	It's interesting because I saw this and I downloaded it but I haven't actually played it yet.
2333606	2335647	I don't know, it's kind of neat.
2336497	2339418	I'm not really sure about the whole Lord of the Rings aspect of it.
2339799	2342039	I'm just waiting for a good RTS game to be on there.
2343340	2344701	Something like Command & Conquer.
2345021	2349543	I'm sure Command & Conquer 3, when they're putting that out, would be pretty awesome.
2350003	2351003	Probably going to put that out on the 360.
2351123	2356786	I think they were testing to see how well a game like that would do with Lord of the Rings, so it should be interesting.
2358041	2361762	I will want to check this demo out, just because I like free stuff, even if it's just demos.
2361982	2383506	One thing to mention, though, about that demo, they did have, um, slightly before the demo was released, they had a walkthrough of the demo, um, which was kind of interesting, um, and that was pretty cool, and they also had a walkthrough of some other demo, and I remember a walkthrough of the demo of, um, To Human, I believe, or no, not To Human, um,
2385677	2386798	God, what the hell the other game was.
2386858	2394023	But anyways, there were three walkthroughs on there and two demos, so possibly a third demo coming out.
2394464	2400268	And I think that was their new MMO, their sci-fi MMO, which for some reason the name is escaping me.
2402390	2402670	Whatever.
2404532	2407654	All right, well, we're going to move on to an interactive element of our show.
2407694	2412478	We love to get mails from you guys every week at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2413134	2413855	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2437694	2442159	DarkSakura reads them all, and I read some of them too, but we don't have time to respond on air to all of them.
2442399	2445663	But there are quite a number that I'm going to actually make a typed response to.
2445944	2448526	Alright, and real quick, that was Mass Effect I was talking about.
2448807	2449748	Alright, here we go.
2449828	2450268	Mailbag!
2452531	2454934	The first one comes from Brandon from Texas.
2455407	2456448	This is good afternoon.
2456989	2458430	Actually, it is sort of afternoon now, isn't it?
2459071	2461193	I am a new listener of your podcast and love it.
2461213	2465217	I just wanted to make a comment about the comments about game patching you did in episode 190.
2465498	2469282	It is always a bad idea to rush a product out and fix it later.
2469342	2471084	The examples of why is Windows XP.
2472026	2476608	Microsoft has rushed the development of XP and caused it to be inherently insecure.
2477248	2480370	It wasn't until Service Pack 2 that the majority of security flaws were fixed.
2480490	2481730	Of course, there are still problems.
2482050	2486953	The sad reality is that if there is buggy software, it is a risk to security and your systems.
2487013	2488673	People can exploit a flaw in a Wii game.
2489194	2491195	It will cause cheating and other malignant hacks.
2491315	2492375	I like that use of malignant.
2493776	2494636	Okay, I'm the grammar nerd.
2495857	2496617	It's Madatuma.
2498633	2499374	Thank you for watching!
2521483	2523085	Good email.
2523585	2525467	I like the comparison.
2525527	2532553	I like the point that he's trying to make with XP being, you know, they have tons of flaws and they're always releasing patches for it all the time.
2532593	2534054	He still has tons of flaws.
2534515	2541481	At the same time, to me, it's a little bit of apples and oranges because you're talking about an operating system, which is like the backbone of the computer, versus a game.
2542145	2543566	It's a little bit apples and oranges for me.
2543586	2548550	Don't get me wrong, I get the comparison, but it's a little bit apples and oranges for me.
2548570	2552433	I'll tell you what system actually that would have been a very accurate comparison to is the Dreamcast.
2553194	2559579	For any of the games that ran in the Windows CE environment, the game loads Windows CE onto the system prior to playing the game.
2559839	2570567	Or even more recent, some of the Xbox 360 games and their save game errors, which once you're playing through some of the game, you go back into it and your save game's gone.
2570928	2571228	So...
2572003	2576345	That was something that they had to patch and fix and hopefully I think it's fixed by now.
2577305	2577805	More mail!
2578025	2591450	Yes, actually an email from our dear friend Rob with two B's actually sent me a little bit of an article that was posted on Instant Replay about Namco of America.
2592151	2592971	They have a new president.
2595192	2598293	Toyoshi Nishikawa is now the president and CEO of
2599653	2628193	COO of Namco America Incorporated Kevin Hayes is now going to be focusing on Namco Cybertainment which is the arcade good I mean good that arcade stuff is going up you know I was listening to another show I think it was Bobby talking about arcade stuff and how there's kind of a need to re-energize what's going on in the arcade scene and I want to say it was something like Sega
2629516	2632777	had a big interest in trying to revitalize what was going on in the arcade market.
2632877	2638998	I know some of the things that they were citing was look at a game like Derby Owner's Club that has a huge social following behind it.
2639258	2645540	That's really where arcades can come back to life is through the social element.
2646960	2647580	Look at DDR.
2647760	2651521	I mean, hell, this show was born of the social element of DDR.
2652141	2653562	It boils down to something as simple as that.
2653582	2654082	That's
2655222	2656183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2671289	2674632	I like that people are putting resources back into making arcades fun.
2674812	2676874	Because arcades have so much potential.
2676994	2678655	They're pretty much dying over here for a little while.
2678955	2680136	But they need to come back to life.
2680156	2681077	There's so much potential.
2681357	2684600	I think it's actually pretty good that they brought over somebody from the Japanese side of it.
2684620	2691286	Because the arcades there are still... If they're not surviving fully, they're still going on strong.
2691646	2694288	I don't think there's been as many closures there as there were here.
2694708	2696750	But a little bit more background on Nishikawa.
2696810	2698471	He's been with Namco since 1987.
2701144	2705746	He's been the EVP CEO since January.
2706306	2709347	So basically he's been with Namco for a while.
2709447	2711767	He's got a lot of experience in the company.
2711787	2717469	So being that I am a big Namco fan, I worked for several of their arcades.
2718650	2721390	A GS68 in our chatroom has a great comment too.
2721430	2723611	Maximum Tune 2 is very social as well.
2723691	2723931	Yeah.
2727352	2728792	This could be a good thing for arcades.
2729032	2731273	So congratulations on your promotions, boys.
2731933	2737975	Speaking of arcades, I was at Riptide Arcade yesterday.
2739335	2740816	That's the Pier 39 one, right?
2740896	2741616	Yeah, in San Francisco.
2741996	2745457	They have now this machine that you can win iPods and...
2745956	2746657	Yeah, I've seen those, yeah.
2746757	2748638	And PSPs and DSs out of.
2748698	2751000	I saw one at Universal CityWalk in one of the random stores there.
2751261	2753022	Wow, we've all been traveling a lot lately.
2753102	2756585	Like, we have these, like, I've had these random Reno, Canada stories.
2757886	2758727	And LA.
2758787	2760669	Including interesting text messages.
2760709	2761650	San Francisco.
2762110	2762470	Yeah.
2762490	2766414	I was in San Francisco, San Jose, Los Gatos, like, in the span of two days.
2766654	2767555	It's kind of crazy.
2767615	2767835	Anyway.
2768135	2769376	Anyway, back to the emails.
2770177	2770998	One from Fireboma.
2772549	2773809	One of our long-time listeners.
2797632	2803916	Xplay, the show that usually laden with knowledge about obscure Japanese RPGs and action games, forgot to do its homework and is now talking out of its ass.
2804596	2815622	The main problem is that this lack of knowledge about the Bimani series when it comes to comparing Guitar Hero to other games is commonplace in many publications about the Guitar Hero series, calling it groundbreaking and such.
2816022	2820685	This is like calling In the Groove a unique dancing game the likes of which never have been seen before.
2821525	2824587	I'm wondering what your thoughts on this issue and what you think about Xplay's review.
2825223	2829005	I think as far as X-Play's review goes, I think you pretty much said it right there.
2829025	2831046	I mean, if they didn't do the research, you can tell.
2831126	2833307	It shows, and it makes you mad or whatever.
2833727	2841690	So their review, they will bear the brunt of the fan base getting mad at them for their review.
2842410	2846852	But unfortunately, it's kind of a trend you're seeing because while... Here it is for me.
2847272	2849213	Guitar Hero is a good game.
2849793	2851114	In fact, it's a great game.
2851883	2853063	But people give it too much credit.
2853503	2856924	It didn't do as much as people think it did.
2857064	2863606	And the problem is, exactly what this is, is that people are giving Guitar Hero credit for something it didn't do.
2864006	2867187	And that was like creating the music genre, essentially.
2868288	2870788	In a way, creating the music-making genre, I should say.
2870808	2873749	Because you could go back, Beatmania didn't really create the music.
2873789	2880031	And you could go back further and say Parappa the Rapper was really... But as far as the music-making genre, Beatmania is really the granddaddy
2880561	2883909	and so you can't credit Guitar Hero with that.
2884149	2883909	1998.
2884931	2886936	But you can credit Guitar Hero with
2888559	2893340	I remember seeing this review a while back and I remember complaining about it as well.
2893420	2893941	Because, you know...
2918513	2939970	I had pretty good respect for X-Play because I love how they rip in some of the stupid games out there and they point out what's really dumb about them or what's glitchy about it and they do it in a funny way sometimes but then there's some times where they're just talking out their ass about things and I don't know, it's just you kind of
2940740	2946525	Expect a certain level of criticism from them and a little bit of research involved.
2946585	2948867	And then when you see them just kind of completely...
2949915	2975537	you know turn around and become like all those other shows out there you kind of let down and I really think if you know if they want to play you know devil's advocate here Guitar Hero wouldn't be as great as it was if Guitar Freaks had more licensed music that wasn't all kind of in-house or non-mainstream I mean it was a Japanese game and it had Japanese style music and in fact if I remember correctly I think that was one of the complaints of Beatmania was
2975997	2977939	Oh, none of these music tracks.
2977979	2980841	They're just all generic techno, and I don't recognize any of these.
2980921	2988086	But yeah, if you follow Beatmania, these are some classic tracks from like 10 years ago and some of the beginning games.
2988747	2991449	I want to get to some chatroom comments real quick before we get back to the mailbag.
2991489	2995452	And I want to say 23rd Magus in our chatroom says, Guitar Hero did a hell of a lot.
2995532	2997433	It made music games more accessible.
2997813	2998574	That's kind of the point there.
2998594	2999515	That's a good way of putting it.
2999675	3002397	It made music games more accessible to a wider audience.
3002417	3002997	I like that point.
3003338	3005099	And then GS191 also makes a good point.
3005399	3006619	Hey, don't blame the hosts.
3006960	3010361	None of us are, for the record, but everybody out there should keep in mind this.
3010661	3011681	Hey, don't blame the hosts.
3011781	3013242	Blame the fucking writers and editors.
3013302	3015823	They are the people that are putting that show down the tubes.
3016483	3020965	So whatever intern at X-Play wrote that review, a spanking for you, my friend.
3021465	3022205	Not even a good one.
3022345	3023806	Granted, still, don't blame the hosts.
3023826	3024426	That's fine.
3024526	3034590	But I would take it that these people, hosts of a gaming show, should have some common knowledge to a game series that is, I don't know, over 10 years old now.
3037291	3044095	To the credit though, the two that they have hosting that show have more knowledge than a lot of folks on that network, so I can't complain.
3044275	3056742	They've talked about DDR in the past, and they've talked about when Guitar Freaks, when Guitar Hero came out, so I know they're aware of Guitar Hero, or Guitar Freaks, so what, is this the brain fart?
3056822	3057102	Whatever.
3058102	3060944	I've got one last email, and this is from Blaze.
3062006	3069693	Hey Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, as always this show is going amazingly well and I can't wait for each week's episode.
3069773	3072235	I just wanted to offer an opinion on a couple of different things.
3072876	3072235	1.
3073396	3078801	In regards to a question about retailers not having the quote unpopular like Phoenix Wright, Katamari Damacy,
3079719	3080840	Games, I would like to say this.
3081280	3084542	Retailers need to understand that these games exist because people do play them.
3084922	3089925	Therefore, stores should come up with a better way of figuring out what to stock and what not to stock.
3090085	3095869	Even if a store only keeps two or three copies of a game at a given time, it is better than running out and not doing anything about it.
3095989	3102212	I called three GameStop CBs in the past week, and none of them had Phoenix Wright, not a big surprise, or Katamari Damacy, a rather odd surprise.
3102793	3108276	When I spoke to the people at these stores, they did nothing in order to try and be more helpful other than, no, we don't have the game.
3109048	3112670	In their defense, it is based on how much they sell.
3112770	3125938	If they sell one copy of Katamari during pre-orders, and they sell 40 of Madden, their big seller is going to be Madden.
3126539	3131862	It is going to make more sense for them to stock more of this, better to cater to the larger numbers than to...
3133528	3156458	but on the other side of this and the part that kind of makes me go huh is that you know like let's say Tower Records if they didn't have a CD I wanted they would offer to order it for me so why aren't these stores that he's calling offering to at least order the game for him that would be what I would do I know that they don't actually have that capability so that's why they wouldn't offer it however I think that if you will if you want to see more retailers do that write their customer service line
3157924	3161907	I'm just speaking, and I'm not trying to rip on any store, because he named a couple stores here.
3162448	3166051	From a customer service angle, you don't turn the customers away.
3166111	3167612	You try to do whatever you can.
3167632	3169194	I train customer service for a living.
3169514	3172376	You have to try and keep them somehow, and that's one way you can do it.
3173397	3177338	I mean, if that's a corporate restriction, that's the corporate, they need to, the corporate needs to look into that.
3177458	3180939	I do know, and I've seen, I've actually been in this, and it's not just my husband that does this.
3180999	3181179	Right.
3181659	3183480	Um, and I'm not just saying it because he's my husband too.
3183520	3183720	Right.
3184080	3188101	But, um, I've actually been in a couple of GameStops where they will call other stores and find out.
3188121	3189201	Well, now that's a little better.
3189221	3189301	Yeah.
3189321	3190102	That's a little better.
3190122	3190342	That's good.
3190362	3190942	That's something.
3191022	3191522	That's good.
3192262	3201045	Um, I've, I went back, kind of on the same subject, I went back to GameStop the other day to, um, was I was looking to maybe pick up another used, uh, Xbox 360 game.
3201065	3201105	Um,
3203479	3203919	DarkSakura.com
3227930	3228570	Final Fantasy XII
3247399	3252281	I think that they should actually do a network-wide inventory and be able to do store-to-store.
3252301	3255882	You actually can do store-to-store transfers for items at GameStop.
3256682	3259323	I think that's more just in case they need stock of stuff.
3259823	3265805	But I think that they should actually be able to have it where, hey, we can pull this copy from this store for you and have it for you on this day.
3267306	3267906	It's a suggestion.
3268806	3271167	Well, hopefully somebody who has the power to change.
3271227	3272587	It doesn't have to be GameStop.
3272607	3273728	It can be any of these stores.
3274768	3281871	If anybody's listening that might have control over corporate, I hope you have... I would love to hear from you guys that work in the corporate side of these things.
3282151	3283712	What's your view on these types of policies?
3284460	3288061	If we're way off base with what we think are good ideas, we'd like to know why.
3288101	3290182	What are the reasons why you wouldn't do that?
3290502	3292203	I should see if I could interview my husband's boss.
3293003	3293583	That would be fun.
3295784	3300285	The second item on here, pre-ordering games is something I only do if I'm going to get a bonus out of it.
3300746	3303447	For example, I pre-ordered Soul Calibur 2 for the Xbox.
3303587	3310209	I had pre-ordered it two or three days after the offer had expired, but I received my very awesome lithograph that hangs in the frame in my room.
3310769	3312709	and a gorgeous book with artwork from the game.
3313110	3316250	So I say that reserving the game is only worth it if you get a nice bonus.
3317190	3318091	I do disagree with that.
3318891	3328293	For some of those more rare, hard to find games that you know there's going to be a limited run of, pre-ordering guarantees you get your copy.
3329273	3335134	And honestly, because it's really convenient for me anyway because I can just say, hey, Dan, pick up our pre-orders.
3336254	3340255	But even so, if you live a block from a GameStop or it's on your way home from work
3340905	3344573	What's gonna hurt you to stop in, drop your five bucks off, and pick it up after work one day?
3346138	3349701	I don't want to keep delaying this issue out, but I did think about it.
3349821	3351522	So I just want to leave with this note.
3351622	3354385	I really thought about what is the reason, Rob, why you don't pre-order games.
3354405	3355145	And I thought about it.
3355205	3366394	This is why I don't like to pre-order games, because I feel like when I put down $5 a GameStop, the day the game comes out, then I see an ad in the paper, and, oh, Best Buy is offering a free copy of such and such, or they're offering this deal.
3366434	3371358	So it's like, well, damn, now I've already committed the $5 to buy it here, and now I can really get the special deal here.
3371758	3374941	and honestly, I think that's what stopped me from doing it in the past.
3375121	3382888	I put down $5 on a game and then suddenly Best Buy or one of the other companies, I'm just using them as an example, gave a better deal and I was a little miffed by that.
3383188	3385790	As a small rebuttal, you can transfer your reserves to other games.
3386791	3388673	I think you actually can cancel your reserve.
3389153	3390975	I guess that's a good thing to know, but I don't
3391351	3392232	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3421027	3422408	I've actually been to that site.
3422808	3424128	It's worth your time checking out.
3424148	3426529	An honorable mention for site of the week.
3427169	3427630	It's cute.
3428330	3429751	I can't think of any other word to describe.
3429771	3430131	It's cute.
3430171	3432992	Check it out.
3433272	3435773	I know we have some OL Army people on there.
3436457	3437197	Well, you know what?
3437697	3438318	I'll tell you what.
3438498	3447880	If anyone of you is playing Kingdom of Loathing, I will make, because again, I'm hosting stuff for our ORL Army also on roleplay.darksakura.com.
3448400	3451061	I will make a Kingdom of Loathing discussion forum for you guys.
3451301	3457763	Ooh, now Roz in our chat room or Dance Cook, whatever, says that Kingdom of Loathing needs to go die in a fire.
3458163	3459403	Apparently something happened.
3459803	3460523	Some drama.
3460623	3461024	I don't know.
3461824	3463164	Is there drama on Kingdom of Loathing?
3463204	3463524	I wouldn't know.
3463544	3463804	Anyway.
3463884	3465645	What game does not have drama?
3465865	3466165	Please.
3467411	3470953	Pac-Man, Brain Age, Brew!
3471993	3473393	Alright, anyways.
3473533	3474474	That's the last of the emails.
3474534	3475054	That's the last email.
3475094	3478955	Alright, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, we'd love to hear from you.
3479295	3481596	Also, there's the voicemail, 916-226-9067.
3482497	3483577	That's not a toll-free call.
3483877	3486478	Our voicemail question of the week, are games too easy?
3487017	3495500	One last thing I do want to mention is that for the kind person who sent me an email directly with the compliments and support, thank you very much.
3495580	3496801	You will be getting a reply.
3496861	3499362	I just did not have an opportunity to do it when I first read your email.
3499694	3508316	and to the people who did not email me this week directly with admiration and support, you may feel free to email me this week.
3508796	3509177	Thank you.
3509257	3512337	Hey, I text messaged you.
3512437	3514078	I don't want the listeners text messaging me.
3514138	3515318	I get charged for that.
3515458	3516458	No, send me an email.
3516498	3517039	That's free.
3517099	3518279	I'll text you five times.
3518979	3526282	And also, one more thing to add on there, thank you for anybody that nominated us for the podcast awards as well.
3527403	3529844	Let's hope it's five indies that got nominated.
3529904	3535446	Let's hope that it is indie podcasts that got in there, but we'll know in about a week or so what's going on there.
3535586	3542009	I would bet anything Gamertag Radio gets nominated, because I've gotten like five emails from those guys.
3543177	3543798	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3568823	3572046	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3595709	3605456	Goodman has an issue with the game's plot, which sees the terrorists taking over a swanky casino on the city strip and seizing a number of hostages.
3606337	3618645	Apparently, Goodman reported saying the game was based on a false premise, adding he has been repeatedly told by the government officials that Las Vegas is the safest place imaginable when it comes to terrorist attacks.
3619625	3624531	The mayor also said he'll look into whether or not the city can prevent the game from being released.
3624612	3633022	It could be harmful economically and it may be something that's not entitled to free speech protection.
3633463	3633543	Um,
3634542	3636823	Wonderdog Harold has an excellent point here in the chatroom.
3636943	3641364	You'd think he'd object to all the murders that take place in Las Vegas on CSI.
3641384	3641664	Exactly!
3641684	3642004	Exactly!
3663905	3664525	That's true.
3665126	3667627	CSI does not make Las Vegas look like a pretty place.
3667888	3669348	I don't really watch the show a whole lot.
3669409	3675492	I've caught it a couple times because I shouldn't have to feel ashamed to admit this, but I like Survivor.
3675592	3680195	And CSI comes on after Survivor and, you know, sometimes I catch the first little pieces.
3680275	3683197	It doesn't paint Vegas to be a pretty town at all.
3684558	3687220	So you'd think the mayor would... Maybe he has, I don't know.
3687260	3692123	I mean, after all, their catchphrase for Vegas is, you know, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
3692183	3692323	I mean...
3695710	3696531	Anyway, moving on.
3696551	3698193	I want to point this out.
3698213	3702297	This is very random, but when was the last time we had Atari 2600 news on this show?
3703138	3704399	Hey, we love all consoles.
3704999	3705460	We mean it.
3706206	3712231	Well get this, Simon Kornhorst is developing for the Atari 2600.
3712571	3714993	Yes, folks are still developing for the Atari 2600.
3715353	3719817	It's called AVCS Tech Challenge is the name of the game.
3719857	3724260	That's a little bit of a play on the word Aztec Challenge that was a game on the Commodore 64.
3725521	3734188	There's a quote from Simon Kornhorst that says as follows, I somehow remember the game Aztec Challenge from 1983 on the Commodore 64, and I always liked the first level called the Gauntlet.
3734548	3739511	And the game music, I thought a similar game for the VCS would be cool, he says on his website.
3739892	3747717	For the game's release, there will be handmade copies complete with a manual cartridge and packaging, but only for the first 55 owners.
3748537	3751339	Most of those have already been secured by Nostalgia Gamers.
3751840	3752280	However...
3753055	3760500	Mr. Cornhorse is willing to produce as many copies as is needed with just manuals and cartridges for those folks that may want to pick this up.
3760720	3762261	A VCS tech challenge.
3762601	3765923	Now, you know, they keep making these flashback consoles.
3766023	3770486	I think they should, you know, I think it would be cool to see games like this be put in the flashback consoles.
3770506	3771366	And I think they did this.
3771946	3775589	I remember a story way, way back when Atari Flashback 2 came out.
3775609	3777330	They had like a contest, like a 24-hour development contest.
3777910	3779831	and they put the winning game in the flashback too.
3780191	3786836	They should reach out to this guy and put this AVCS Tech Challenge in Flashback 3 if they do it.
3787916	3791899	You've got to really love the 2600 to still be developing for it.
3792579	3793400	You know what it looks like though?
3793420	3796261	The game itself kind of looks like Enduro to me.
3797182	3799984	And how the hell I remember a game like Enduro, I'll never know.
3801204	3803646	But instead of driving, it looks like a little guy running.
3805104	3805545	It's kind of cool.
3806886	3807627	Interesting.
3808748	3813472	Anyways, brand new news here, talking about TV now.
3814082	3824386	Direct TV and IGN have teamed up with Microsoft and a bunch of other companies to put together a brand new pro gaming series called the Championship Gaming Series.
3825086	3830008	And it's basically a new professional gaming league that will air competitions exclusively to Direct TV.
3830748	3842593	And apparently next weekend, Direct TV and the company will take over a 16,000 square foot airplane hangar at former Treasure Island Naval Base in San Francisco and turn it into an indoor video game arena.
3843345	3847866	Project Gotham Racing 3, Halo 2, DOA 4, Counter-Strike 1.6 The Weekends event will be aired in August.
3869565	3870145	Thank you for watching!
3890117	3894220	Yeah, because the one that we used to have, we just don't count anymore, period.
3894380	3894900	We don't count it.
3895461	3898082	Anyway, we're going to go to a new section of our show.
3898643	3900244	Actually, this is not a new section.
3900264	3902485	It's a section we do every week, but it's new for this week.
3902866	3903926	It's the Skype line.
3904286	3911791	If you would like to call into our program, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us, and you can call the show.
3912132	3918956	Our phone number is 916-226-9067, or you can call us on Skype, username OrangeloungeRadio.
3918996	3919917	Let's go to the phones.
3920317	3921299	Legend of Zaku Legend of Zaku
3930974	3939316	Um, basically picking off of where you actually said about the whole X-Play fiasco and, you know, Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb just not doing their job.
3939376	3940197	Well, now, wait a minute.
3940217	3941697	Didn't we say don't blame the hosts?
3941797	3946819	Because... I know, but I know, but still, as I said, you know, there's a lot of blame to go around.
3946899	3954041	Not only them two, but, you know, the people behind them that are making, you know, that are, you know, the people that are actually feeding them this stuff.
3955141	3958582	And I firmly believe that there's a bias against them.
3959417	3961819	There's a bias against Konami?
3962620	3967484	Well, basically, any type of game that doesn't fit their criteria.
3968104	3972908	Like, you know, in this case, they're just kissing the ass of Guitar Hero, basically.
3972928	3979734	That's all I see now, from not only X-Play, but from GameSpot and other people that bastardize Beatmania.
3980354	3981896	What is the criteria?
3982691	3998404	I mean, from what I've been seeing, they usually come down hard on good games that turn out to be really, you know, they really, you know, they really talk down on, you know, on good games, on really good games.
3998584	4003668	I mean, I know... Was there another game that they did a review of that made you upset?
4005329	4006610	I'm trying to remember right now.
4007170	4013333	It's been a while since I watched X-Play, but usually... Okay, that's alright.
4013353	4014153	You can't think of an example.
4014173	4019176	But to play Devil's Advocate for a bit, you're never going to agree with game reviews 100% of the time.
4019196	4021077	They're kind of meant to ruffle your feathers a little bit.
4021837	4024738	Yeah, and that's the truth, and I understand that.
4025299	4030141	But I mean, the only thing, what I don't get is how, you know, they're saying...
4030856	4044605	They're taking one thing like Guitar Hero and making it hold more weight than something like Beatmania which has been around there for almost 10 times as long as Guitar Hero.
4044625	4045305	It doesn't make sense.
4045465	4046546	Somebody didn't do their homework.
4046726	4048087	It's as simple as that.
4048527	4049248	That too.
4049448	4055452	And the fact that from what I heard in the Beatmania review and expo, they only played the 5 key.
4058251	4069394	Zaku, honestly, I think they just gave it to some intern who did the review in a day, if even that.
4069534	4073254	I mean, that's what happened, but, you know, two things happened.
4073294	4079616	It's good news for X-Play, because now we've spent how much time during this program essentially giving them free advertising, and two...
4082141	4087285	It's going to make themselves look bad in that community for not having done that, but that's just part of life.
4087545	4087926	You know what?
4087986	4093170	We get criticized because we make mistakes sometimes, but we just have to realize shit happens.
4093430	4094471	We make lots of mistakes.
4094951	4096032	So what?
4096112	4098634	We don't claim to be all-knowing.
4098994	4108241	It pisses me off when I read things on the internet that bash on us for this type of stuff, and it's like we're supposed to be these all... We don't get paid for this.
4108782	4111484	If I was getting paid to do eight hours of research a day on video games...
4111924	4117485	Everything that comes out of my mouth, Loki's mouth, DarkSakura's mouth, is love of games and hobbyists.
4117545	4118585	It's hobbyists and things we do.
4118625	4123186	And these two guys go through playing the games before saying something about them.
4123887	4128448	Whereas Adam and Morgan just read off the teleprompter.
4128468	4131808	Well, to be honest, though, it would take forever for one person to play all the games.
4131948	4134889	I mean, trying to play everything that comes out.
4135089	4139310	I remember when we first started doing the podcast full-time and everything.
4140829	4142850	I was just trying to play everything and you can't.
4143471	4144111	You really can't.
4152095	4159919	Adam was doing shows on ZDTV, the GameSpot TV, where I think the hosts were responsible for a lot more of the work.
4159979	4162021	So you can't discredit them as gamers.
4162041	4164862	Morgan was part of Screensavers a long time ago.
4165023	4175829	I would really take them a lot more seriously if they actually did more work as in actually giving an honest opinion rather than just reading it off.
4175849	4177030	That can't really happen.
4178000	4181302	That might be the producer or the network's problem, though.
4181322	4182423	But, Zaku, we've got to let you go.
4182783	4183263	We're running long.
4183283	4184104	We've got to get another call.
4184124	4190088	But thank you so much for the perspective and making us talk about it a little bit.
4190108	4190949	Let's go to another call.
4190989	4192230	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4192250	4192650	Who's this?
4193550	4194971	This is 23rd Magus.
4195192	4195992	Hi, 23rd Magus.
4196012	4198694	Back away from your speakers a little bit and tell us what's on your mind.
4199355	4202757	Okay, I just thought I'd pitch in with a little WoW update.
4203317	4203838	Okay, what's up?
4204218	4205519	I'm the resident WoW addict anyway.
4207045	4208426	Okay, what's up on WoW?
4209026	4218810	Okay, IGN has released a new story unveiling the new additions to World PvP in the 1.12 patch that should be coming out, I'd say probably within a month.
4220170	4228994	The Eastern Plaguelands will feature resource points that must be captured, and Silithus will have piles of magical dust called Silithist that must be collected.
4229614	4235536	Alliance and Horde players will fight over these resources, which, when turned in, will provide a zone-wide buff to your faction.
4237548	4245932	The 1.2 patch with the World PvP objectives, the Cross-Circle Battlegrounds, and the Rogue Talent Review should be live on the test rooms by Monday.
4246252	4253676	I did notice on WorldofWarcraft.com they posted the list of which... Magus, I have to let you go because we're getting really bad feedback.
4253896	4256057	Let me respond to that just a little bit, what he was saying.
4256857	4258498	Thank you for the World of Warcraft update, that was cool.
4259098	4264501	But I did want to say really quickly that on WorldofWarcraft.com I did notice that they had the list...
4264961	4268803	of which realms are in which group for the cross-battle realms.
4268863	4275405	And, of course, I looked where Airy Peak is at, which is where we've been playing, and it looks like I'll be able to play my old friends on Doomhammer because we're in the same group.
4275745	4276526	So that's kind of cool.
4276586	4277706	So we'll see what happens with that.
4278026	4280107	Let's go to the phones one more time.
4280167	4281508	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4281548	4281948	Who's this?
4282668	4283228	It's Ranma.
4283268	4284089	Who am I supposed to be?
4284309	4284569	All right.
4284589	4285369	What's on your mind, Ranma?
4286230	4290211	I want to talk about a point that you made about customer service in gaming stores.
4290731	4292852	I understand exactly where you're coming from with that.
4293393	4293853	Okay.
4293933	4294173	How so?
4295371	4301693	I work at Staples, and if an item is not in stock, we have to go in the systems and track it down.
4301933	4307075	If we can't get from one machine, we have to go to the AS400 and check all the stores in the area.
4307475	4310516	We have to bend over backwards for the customers, make sure they get what they want.
4310796	4317238	And I have no problem doing that because when I do it for a customer, I expect the same thing done for me.
4318078	4324760	To be honest, that's a good company policy, but to be fair to whatever companies we were talking about earlier in the show,
4325242	4334671	We don't have a representative to really give us the exact policy, so we can only talk about what your company is doing, which sounds like a good thing.
4335959	4340940	See, but the thing is, let's say that it's company policy with all these companies.
4341160	4347822	When it comes down to the individual stores, it seems that management of those stores or the employees just don't, how I say, don't give a shit.
4348022	4350962	Because I had to deal with the same thing that Sunday.
4351022	4352903	I went looking for a couple games at Circuit City.
4353123	4356423	They expected me to go calling all the stores for the games.
4356623	4358944	I said to the two people standing there that...
4360246	4361147	This is your job.
4361347	4364352	You're supposed to go looking at the computers for the games that I want.
4364613	4366415	I'm here being very nice about it.
4366556	4368499	There's no need for you to be rude to me.
4368759	4373146	And don't you know the following day I called corporate and I gave them my two cents about it.
4373896	4379319	I was told by a game store once when I called in asking if they had a certain game in stock and it wasn't anything major.
4379339	4382441	I wasn't talking like an Xbox 360 or Halo 2 or something.
4382802	4386324	I called in asking if a game was in stock and I was told, I'm busy right now.
4386384	4388645	Come down and look and see if we have it on the shelves.
4388945	4392127	Needless to say, I bought the game at their competitor across town.
4393783	4394484	Thanks for watching!
4415405	4423908	that work at these type of places, and it could be anything from the GameStop EB stores to Best Buy, Office Depot, Staples to mom-pop stores, whatever.
4424268	4436072	Keep in mind that it might be an inconvenience sometimes, but bad customer service leads to lost business, leads to your store getting closed and you getting laid off.
4436652	4439853	And that's one of the reasons why one of the guys at my job got fired on Tuesday.
4440294	4440574	Yeah.
4440874	4441254	It's too bad.
4441897	4442077	Right.
4442397	4444898	Ranma, we've got to let you go to get more calls in, but thank you so much for the perspective.
4444938	4445378	Sure, no problem.
4445398	4445778	Bye.
4446258	4446719	Much love.
4447059	4447599	Bye, Ukyo.
4447839	4448419	Hugs and kisses.
4448539	4448859	Bye-bye.
4448939	4449579	Right back at you.
4452100	4452380	All right.
4452801	4453681	We'll do one more call.
4453721	4455861	Somebody wants to call in on our Skype line.
4455922	4458042	It's www.warrenslaunchradio.com.
4458062	4461403	Click on Interact With Us or our phone number, 916-226-9067.
4462864	4466345	In the meantime, does anybody have any last-minute stories they wanted to get off their chest here in studio?
4468325	4469066	Oh, is that a big no?
4469266	4469726	Oh, yes.
4470516	4472297	DarkSakura had a mic to her mouth first.
4472417	4473498	I was going to say, uh-uh.
4473698	4474558	Oh, okay, then Loki.
4475859	4477459	Oh, nope, cut off by the Skype call.
4477479	4478020	Here we go.
4479040	4480141	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4480161	4480541	Who's this?
4481281	4482582	Hi, this is PK or Kira88.
4483702	4484763	I'm sorry, what was that?
4485983	4486784	This is PK or Kira88.
4486864	4488665	Hi, PK or Kira88.
4488685	4489245	What's on your mind?
4490286	4492967	Hey, actually, yeah, I just got back on vacation from the Philippines.
4493887	4497569	And the thing is, I spent a lot of time in the arcades over there.
4498209	4499110	And one thing I noticed...
4500714	4504416	The social environment over there is much more lively than it is over here.
4505877	4506438	How so?
4507798	4511621	Well, like, okay, it's not just the, say, hardcore gamers that are always there.
4511881	4512661	They're there all the time.
4513342	4522828	There'd be, like, families and, you know, usually people that you wouldn't consider gamers that are hanging around, like, playing the games or just having fun.
4523028	4528191	Why do you think families are more apt to play games together in the Philippines than they are here?
4528999	4536261	Well, you know what, honestly, I think it's because of the social, economic conditions, because most of these families can't really afford, say, like, a console, a home console.
4536901	4543382	But, also at the same time, these arcades are making a lot more money than the arcades that we have over here.
4543802	4545283	Yet their games are, like, dirt cheap.
4545503	4551144	Like, for example, I was playing Public Up Zero for, like, 25 cents a game.
4552064	4552184	Hmm.
4553353	4554534	Well, very interesting perspective.
4554554	4559037	I've got to let you go, buddy, because you're a little quiet, but thanks so much for calling in to us tonight.
4559077	4559517	Have a good one.
4560118	4568844	You know, this reminds me of back when my parents used to take me down to Chuck E. Cheese back before it was all neon lights and ball bins, and it was actually just pizza and arcade.
4570965	4575028	They would totally take me down there, and we'd play games and stuff together as a family.
4575248	4577830	Everybody would go and play different video games.
4577950	4578511	Not my mom.
4578931	4580752	She'd hand me a roll of quarters and go sit in the corner.
4580772	4581533	She'd be like, have fun, kid.
4582788	4584489	My mom would sometimes play Pac-Man with me.
4584609	4586750	My mom hates video games.
4587670	4598415	But she always kind of, like, every time something interesting happens with our show, like, you know, last year when we won the podcast award, or we were on, you know, you guys were on the news, and I think we were all on it at one point, too, or in the paper, remember that?
4598695	4600136	You know, those little things that happen?
4600416	4602077	My mom always kind of goes, huh.
4602957	4606539	Like, kind of one of those, wow, I always told them that would never amount to anything.
4607139	4608640	Boy, was I wrong, but that makes me feel good.
4609831	4612954	Well, I still don't think it's amounted to much yet until we get an extra paycheck.
4612974	4613554	This is Apollo.
4613574	4619039	Sorry, I just wanted to really talk about the arcades because I just came back from Japan a few weeks ago.
4636897	4639978	and I wanted to talk about the arcades over there compared to the arcades here.
4641239	4642340	What was the comparison you made?
4643460	4644360	I'm sorry, repeat that?
4644561	4645661	What was the comparison you made?
4647062	4655706	I just wanted to talk about the arcades in Japan and America because the arcades in Japan are a whole lot busier and there's a lot more focus on different styles of gaming.
4657186	4660468	And the UFO catchers, like the crane games are a lot bigger over there too.
4660728	4665090	It's just crazy how much more stuff they have there compared to what we have here.
4666318	4667780	Why do you think it's different?
4670022	4674646	I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the population density in Japan is so much bigger.
4676188	4681473	And I think that that kind of makes it more possible for lots of people to go to one place.
4683976	4685317	Well, very interesting perspective.
4685357	4686318	We appreciate the phone call.
4686358	4687059	Have a good one, okay?
4687740	4688340	Alrighty, thank you.
4688500	4689141	Later, bye-bye.
4689437	4691038	I think that was actually a very good point.
4691518	4697540	Just with, you know, it's actually pretty commonplace for someone to get off work and then go to a game center.
4698241	4703043	Or for, you know, children after school to go to the game center or spend their Sundays there since school's on Saturday, too.
4703723	4712127	But, I mean, I think that that's actually, because it's so integrated into everything and it has been for so long, I think that that is a good reason why it's, you know, surviving.
4712527	4717929	There's a new game center going up by us, by a local theater that we have up in Eldry Hills.
4718616	4721477	There's a new gaming center going on down there.
4721497	4725399	It almost looks like it could be a console gaming center, which I'm kind of interested to check out.
4725699	4729161	They don't have it built yet, but it's going in.
4729201	4730022	Any of the last minute stories?
4730782	4732883	I was just going to mention one thing real quick.
4733763	4739186	There was a report about the Xbox 360 branded ecstasy popping up in the UK.
4739686	4740727	I thought that was kind of funny.
4741527	4744088	There's a new type of ecstasy that they're calling Xbox 360 pills.
4747786	4748207	Jump in.
4749208	4751992	Exactly.
4753073	4757279	Well, I guess that's about going to wrap it up then for this week's edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
4757319	4760584	We really appreciate you guys tuning in to us and supporting independent radio.
4760604	4761325	You guys rock.
4761769	4763691	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4764391	4765292	Loki, your final thought.
4765772	4769655	I'm going to try to play more Chromehounds this week because I've only been playing the training missions.
4769675	4774900	I need to get a lot more parts to actually make a mech so I can go play online.
4775020	4777582	I've been really trying to play more online games.
4779183	4786109	My final thought is big thanks to Miklatov for being a special guest on the show tonight, even though we might get some angry emails from what he said in the first half, but that's all right.
4786881	4787621	Freedom of Speech, right?
4788062	4795325	And I want to say I have to catch him up in level on WoW because he's an addict.
4796045	4796826	I'm supposed to mention.
4796846	4798046	Same with Annie.
4798126	4801408	Or you're supposed to mention, actually, according to the chat room.
4802048	4805830	Someone posted a link to some OLR card game that they're working on.
4806510	4807571	Poozeater.
4809032	4810432	You guys are crazy, but I love you.
4811052	4812153	DarkSakura, your final thought.
4812608	4813649	My final thought is two parts.
4813669	4815570	The first one is always reject false icons.
4816010	4817051	Second is define yourself.
4817091	4817991	Don't let the world define you.
4820833	4822754	You're such the mommy sometimes, but I like it.
4824114	4827676	It has to do with... You leave good moral messages for the youth of America.
4827696	4831238	I've had stuff going on, so that's very important right now.
4831258	4831659	I understand.
4832459	4832739	All right.
4832999	4833760	Well, that's it, guys.
4833780	4834740	We'll see you next week.
4834780	4837962	We are back on Sunday night, 6 o'clock, and we'll see you next time.
4838503	4840964	And you podcast folks, stay tuned to our podcast feed.
4841551	4842652	and have a great week.
4842952	4843552	Keep on gaming.
4843792	4844293	Don't be a dick.
