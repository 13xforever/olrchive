[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any sites you're affiliated with you want to pimp my show?

23
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a podcast?

[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's talk about some gaming news tonight.

26
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:49,965
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, we always talk about what we've been playing in our gaming week.

27
00:01:50,526 --> 00:01:51,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start it off with DarkSakura.

28
00:01:51,806 --> 00:01:53,847
[SPEAKER_05]: What have you been playing during your gaming week?

29
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,268
[SPEAKER_02]: But loads of stuff.

30
00:01:57,568 --> 00:02:01,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Getting Lost in San Francisco this weekend, but that's...

31
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:04,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like Crazy Taxi or what?

32
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:05,327
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.

33
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:15,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I played, we actually went to Santa Cruz this morning to play, actually just to go hang out at the boardwalk for a little while and, you know, have me not die on that little thing that goes across.

34
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:16,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is we?

35
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this the girls?

36
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:29,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It was me and Disney Punk 10, Kristen, and her friend from L.A., Marissa, who's now my friend, very cool person, music nerd, like moi.

37
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:30,435
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like a girl thing.

38
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:31,296
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a slumber party.

39
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:32,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a big slumber party.

40
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:33,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you go in your PJs?

41
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:34,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Pillow fight?

42
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a pillow fight?

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,380
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

44
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,403
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did have some... Ice cream?

45
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:40,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about boys?

46
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:41,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually did eat a lot of ice cream.

47
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:42,046
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Dippin' Dots.

48
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:42,967
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

49
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:50,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Star Wars Episode I Pinball, which is Pinball 2000.

50
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:52,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Pinball 2000 games.

51
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:55,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Revenge from Mars, Pinball 2000.

52
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the hologram ones, right?

53
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

54
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are cool.

55
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:01,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I played The Sopranos Pinball, which is actually pretty decent.

56
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:08,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the first Star Wars game, Pinball, that's put out by Sega, which is kind of a crappy table.

57
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:10,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played...

58
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:12,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shoot.

59
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:14,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It was another table that was really good.

60
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a brainstorm.

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,401
[SPEAKER_05]: It hurt a little bit.

62
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:21,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Why doesn't Sega put out a Sonic pinball table?

63
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,304
[SPEAKER_05]: They could have a little blue pinball.

64
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:24,685
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a Super Mario Bros.

65
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:25,986
[SPEAKER_02]: pinball table there that wasn't working.

66
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:26,727
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not Sonic.

67
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:30,409
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I played Lord of the Rings pinball, which is also put up by Stern.

68
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:31,430
[SPEAKER_02]: One ball to rule them all?

69
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:34,595
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty difficult table, actually.

70
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really good machine, though.

71
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:38,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, you are stealing my material.

72
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:38,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Shush.

73
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:42,817
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, Stern is the only company still making pins right now, pretty much.

74
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:46,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I also, we got a new pinball table.

75
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:53,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I woke up Friday morning to see Dan face down on the futon, and in our garage is a Twilight Zone pinball.

76
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,343
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

77
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:16,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you can autograph it for a listener.

78
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:17,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny, though?

79
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:21,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I decided that that Twilight Zone was destined to be.

80
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:29,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you lift up the playfield to look at it, if you look at the very end of it that's facing toward the coin slots, you'll have two dates on there.

81
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:31,360
[SPEAKER_02]: The first date is the date that the board was cut.

82
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,381
[SPEAKER_02]: The second date is the date the playfield was assembled.

83
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:38,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And the date that the board on that Twilight Zone was cut was my birthday.

84
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:39,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

85
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:40,282
[SPEAKER_02]: It was April 19th.

86
00:04:40,502 --> 00:04:40,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

87
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:42,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually played DDR today.

88
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:45,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not die.

89
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:51,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played this other, it was a ticket game, but it plays like pop-up music with eggs, and there's only four buttons.

90
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:52,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Rhythm and Something.

91
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:56,340
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really stupid, the music sucked, but it was like, this is pop-up music.

92
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,200
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds kind of cute.

93
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,180
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cute.

94
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:01,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a Tron machine that I didn't play.

95
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:06,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, say hello to our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.

96
00:05:06,664 --> 00:05:11,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Funnydale is actually letting us know that Sonic did have a pinball game somewhere between 93 and 95.

97
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:12,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's news to me.

98
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:12,987
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.

99
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:13,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I had forgotten about it.

100
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:14,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

101
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:15,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Pin Mame

102
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:28,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's true.

103
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:29,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I could play it in there.

104
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:30,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

105
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:33,433
[SPEAKER_05]: NintendoManiac64 says, I have a pinball machine.

106
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:33,954
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

107
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:36,775
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Dark Knight says, give me the Simpsons pinball.

108
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:39,996
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good table, too, because the bumpers were the big nuclear reactors.

109
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:40,976
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome.

110
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:42,277
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a Funhaus pinball.

111
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:45,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that machine because that head thing on there.

112
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:50,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... They had a laughing cell at the boardwalk, though.

113
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,661
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were at...

114
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:55,905
[SPEAKER_02]: California Extreme.

115
00:05:57,165 --> 00:06:01,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Playland used to be an amusement park in New York that they had to destroy.

116
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:03,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they sold the property or something.

117
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:10,011
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people who made a Playland memorial or museum.

118
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,451
[SPEAKER_02]: They have games from there and everything.

119
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:14,812
[SPEAKER_02]: They have two Laughing Souths.

120
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:18,594
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw the one at Santa Cruz, I was like, oh, I remember that.

121
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:19,932
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

122
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:38,918
[SPEAKER_02]: The J-pop one.

123
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:41,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So our music gaming fans would be very happy at this place.

124
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,421
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a DDR Supernova.

125
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:42,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

126
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:44,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a new unit.

127
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't even played the... Well, I mean, I played it at E3 and the Konami Gamers.

128
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:50,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played, like, the final release version of it yet.

129
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:57,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't play it because when we went to one of the little smaller ones just to play skee-ball, they had an Extreme there, so Chris and I played that.

130
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably lots of the DDR-free kits.

131
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:01,517
[SPEAKER_02]: He's played Spider Stomp.

132
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:03,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I counted three Spider Stomp machines.

133
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, that's old-school DDR.

134
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Spider Stomp.

135
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

136
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:08,129
[SPEAKER_02]: and they have a dock upstairs now.

137
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:09,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

138
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:10,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

139
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, Loki, how was your gaming week?

140
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:16,174
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty good.

141
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:22,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing the hell out of the Saints Row demo.

142
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:32,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it was funny because I thought my magazine, the official Xbox magazine, I thought my subscription ended, but it has now after I got the demo, which is where it counts.

143
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:34,184
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really fun.

144
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:35,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Saints Row is

145
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically Grand Theft Auto.

146
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:42,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they've improved on a few things, and there's a few things that are kind of not as great.

147
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:49,470
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the most part, it's very enjoyable, and that demo we play for an entire hour each lunch.

148
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,511
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the things that are different?

149
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:58,594
[SPEAKER_04]: The things that are different, first off, the camera's a lot better with the right analog stick.

150
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:02,596
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, if you have pipe bombs and stuff, you can toss stuff behind you.

151
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:03,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

152
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:22,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob Storrs

153
00:08:52,755 --> 00:09:00,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, I've been playing a little bit of other Xbox stuff like Ridge Racer 6 a little bit.

154
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:03,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really played too much of Chromehounds.

155
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:04,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I did finish the...

156
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:06,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

157
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,599
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com OrangeLoungeRadio.com

158
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:53,706
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it's not that I read.

159
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:57,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you didn't read it, then hell, who cares?

160
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,569
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't see it, it's not illegal.

161
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:04,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so the game itself, it's pretty cool.

162
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:08,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it plays very similar to the Xbox 360 demo that I played.

163
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:13,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, graphics are a lot less Xbox 360, but they do the job.

164
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:15,537
[SPEAKER_04]: It is an online game, completely.

165
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And you still roll down the window?

166
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:18,819
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

167
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:21,233
[SPEAKER_04]: That was an impressive feature in the Xbox demo.

168
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:21,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing, though.

169
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:24,033
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the stuff isn't finished yet because of this beta.

170
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:25,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, all the interiors.

171
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:27,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I went, oh, okay, I'm going to look at the interior of the car and see what it looks like.

172
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:29,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing happened.

173
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:29,995
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just all glitched out.

174
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, that doesn't work.

175
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:34,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I look to see what my driver looked like.

176
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:35,276
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no driver.

177
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:36,577
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the ghost car.

178
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:38,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they haven't finished that yet.

179
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's still beta.

180
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:40,718
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still fun, though.

181
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:44,059
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can drive off-road just as easily as you can with this car.

182
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

183
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:45,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

184
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:51,617
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 2 version, I probably wouldn't pick it up because I have the 360s, so why bother?

185
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:52,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what's weird?

186
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:58,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they drop the PlayStation 2 one, I think the 360 one is actually going to be cheaper.

187
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:02,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's going to be $39.99, so why not pick it up?

188
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,144
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a fun game.

189
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:11,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool, and it's definitely easy to get online with, which I haven't played too many online games, but I know there's been some difficulty.

190
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:14,650
[SPEAKER_04]: No lag, I haven't noticed any lag in it, but it's pretty fun.

191
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:18,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, HitStun also really loved your review there on the graphics.

192
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,454
[SPEAKER_05]: The graphics are a lot less Xbox 360.

193
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:24,675
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very stripped down.

194
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:26,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very, very stripped down.

195
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:26,636
[SPEAKER_05]: How so?

196
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:27,337
[SPEAKER_05]: What's missing?

197
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:28,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a lot of detail that's in there.

198
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:34,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely textures are, you know... It's just not as detailed as the Xbox 360.

199
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,501
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me of the old test drive games, which...

200
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:42,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Last Test Drive I played other than this, which was a long time ago, Test Drive 3 on the PC.

201
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:44,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's when the cars were blocks.

202
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:50,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to say, probably the last Test Drive game I played seriously was like Test Drive 2 The Duel.

203
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:50,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that it?

204
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:52,656
[SPEAKER_05]: On Commodore 64.

205
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty old.

206
00:11:55,038 --> 00:12:00,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this was back in the day when Test Drive, you just basically had to get to the end of the map or whatever.

207
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:01,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And

208
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:02,633
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was a journey.

209
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:11,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would always try to take the shortcuts through the fields and run over the 2D chicken or whatever and just... I don't know.

210
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:12,403
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good game.

211
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:14,005
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have is a PlayStation 2.

212
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:15,367
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still going to be very good.

213
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, check it out.

214
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even the PSP one, when that comes out, will be pretty decent.

215
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:21,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they're worth checking out.

216
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:23,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think, of course, more Grand Theft Auto and...

217
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:27,080
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting to a point now with Grand Theft Auto.

218
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:35,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day we play this game, the more and more frustrated we are at the developers and the more we want to kill them because of how buggy the multiplayer is.

219
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:49,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really sad because I wish I had a way to contact the developers at Rockstar because I have so much feedback I can give them on their game, both positive and negative, because I've basically played this game every single day for at least 30 minutes.

220
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:51,578
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

221
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:51,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

222
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:52,942
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to give me a call.

223
00:12:53,022 --> 00:13:02,947
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone from Rockstar is listening, contact Loki at orangelongeradio.com L-O-K-I I hope to God, because this is built on the Vice City engine.

224
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:11,731
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Liberty City Stories was, and now that Vice City Stories is coming out, you bet your ass they're not going to do anything to fix any of the multiplayer, because they're fucking stupid.

225
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:13,552
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll still buy the game.

226
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:19,168
[SPEAKER_05]: When does the Saints Row demo get released for the rest of us?

227
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:20,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard Tuesday.

228
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:20,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?

229
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:21,769
[SPEAKER_04]: April or August 1st.

230
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:22,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

231
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:24,350
[SPEAKER_04]: So, check it out.

232
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:25,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

233
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:28,852
[SPEAKER_04]: For whatever reason, it's not up that day.

234
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:31,893
[SPEAKER_04]: You can always find it at the official Xbox magazine.

235
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:32,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

236
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:36,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. 23rd Magus, a.k.a.

237
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:37,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew, how was your gaming week?

238
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:38,655
[SPEAKER_03]: It was alright.

239
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:45,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking to make some crazy money, but instead I just sat my ass on the couch, sort of chair, yeah, chair,

240
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:47,525
[SPEAKER_03]: and played Tell Your Iris.

241
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:53,088
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell that Nippon Ichi did all the translating because the script is absolutely hilarious.

242
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:53,949
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this game?

243
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:56,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell Your Iris, Eternal Mantle.

244
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:56,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

245
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:04,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little dialogue with a cat girl asking the protagonist to sleep in bed with her.

246
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:09,058
[SPEAKER_03]: The response is, I can't, the ESRB would go nuts.

247
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:17,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I haven't been doing much gaming, mostly because of the heat affecting my computer.

248
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been trying Fable off and on, and it's the first time I've actually played Fable.

249
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:22,974
[SPEAKER_05]: PC or Xbox?

250
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:23,574
[SPEAKER_03]: PC.

251
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:25,296
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

252
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:31,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting, it's not what it was hyped up to be, obviously, but it's still pretty damn fun.

253
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:37,224
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a completely open world like it was promised, but it is still pretty fun.

254
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:40,287
[SPEAKER_03]: It plays more like Knights of the Old Republic, with the whole good and evil thing.

255
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:40,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

256
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:43,472
[SPEAKER_05]: My Gaming Week.

257
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:45,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually played quite a bit as well.

258
00:14:45,273 --> 00:14:51,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I downloaded the 99 Nights demo because I really liked the game at E3 when I got to play it.

259
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:58,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember when I actually played the full game at E3, it was a lot easier than the demo because I died like three times in the demo.

260
00:14:58,319 --> 00:14:59,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I was doing something wrong.

261
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
[SPEAKER_05]: The game's really fun.

262
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:03,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it a lot.

263
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:11,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a button masher, but it reminds me of a game like Final Fight or probably more rather something like Golden Axe

264
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:13,821
[SPEAKER_05]: But on a much bigger scale.

265
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:18,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in Golden Axe, you cannot kill 50 people in one swoop of the sword and things like that.

266
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:24,424
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can't stab somebody on the end of your sword and then use his body to attack other people.

267
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:25,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun.

268
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:28,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're fighting armies, just lots and lots of people.

269
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:30,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And the game's pretty intricate.

270
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:30,925
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks great.

271
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:32,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoyed the demo.

272
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:34,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely want to pick up the full game, even if I suck at it.

273
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:38,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed already in the chat room, though, some other folks didn't seem to like the game.

274
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:47,353
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely seems like the type of game you're either going to really like or you're going to really hate maybe because of its simplicity and the fact that it is kind of a bit of a button masher.

275
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:48,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some people are really going to get turned off by that.

276
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:51,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people are comparing it to Dynasty Warriors, to be honest.

277
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:53,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is actually a lot better than Dynasty Warriors.

278
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:58,661
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely looks a lot better because Dynasty Warriors 5 fucking sucked on the Xbox 360.

279
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:00,623
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't really do anything.

280
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:03,785
[SPEAKER_04]: And Samurai Warriors 2, when that comes out, that one's going to suck also because...

281
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:07,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Also another just port without any effort is basically what it was.

282
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:13,330
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks, to be honest, this demo looks a lot better than what I remember from E3.

283
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a lot more fun.

284
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:16,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

285
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:21,237
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just seems more fun than Dynasty Warriors was.

286
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:22,238
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

287
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:31,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked back up Oblivion randomly.

288
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:42,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I had tried playing this game a while back, and I thought it was very pretty, but I think the problem was I had someone hovering over my shoulder telling me what to do, like everything, and I think that might have ruined the gaming experience for me, so I went back and checked it out, and...

289
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:44,346
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

290
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:46,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be that person, would I?

291
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:47,708
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't really you.

292
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:49,689
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of everybody was hovering.

293
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody else had played it but me, because a lot of people, and everybody was like, do this, do this, do this.

294
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:53,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, shut up!

295
00:16:55,232 --> 00:17:02,316
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had a chance to just sit down and sort of explore it for myself, and it's so... I guess the only word I can use to describe this game is vast.

296
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:04,818
[SPEAKER_05]: You really can do just whatever you want.

297
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:08,780
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminds me of a first-person shooter, but with swords.

298
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,542
[SPEAKER_05]: But yet, the world is open, and you can go anywhere you want.

299
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:25,884
[SPEAKER_05]: But that vastness is kind of like a good thing and a bad thing because that vastness, I'm so used to very linear types of story in games, so it was really hard for me to go, oh, I could just go anywhere I want and do these other quests before doing the main quest.

300
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:28,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I tried to just go, da-da-da-da-da, start doing the main quest.

301
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:34,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I got murdered ten ways from Sunday, like, so horribly because my character wasn't buffed up enough yet.

302
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I hadn't really practiced with spells and all that stuff.

303
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,649
[SPEAKER_05]: My character didn't have enough stuff, so it kind of took me a little while to get used to that, but...

304
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:52,793
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great game, and I think it's a way for folks who are in the first-person shooters and that genre game, sort of like a really good entry-level RPGs.

305
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:55,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you're the type of person that's like, I hate RPGs.

306
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:57,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe this is more your style.

307
00:17:57,714 --> 00:17:59,134
[SPEAKER_05]: There's different types of RPGs.

308
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:02,435
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not a Final Fantasy RPG by any means.

309
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:03,915
[SPEAKER_05]: This is completely different.

310
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:08,676
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually, it really reminds me of an old PC, which makes sense, I mean, when you consider what the game is.

311
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:09,536
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminds me of an old

312
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

313
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:36,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Although honestly, I just don't know how long I'm going to be able to put up with it before my brain explodes from all that stuff to do and just a million other games I want to play.

314
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:39,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if I get too far into Oblivion, I'm not going to play anything else.

315
00:18:39,757 --> 00:18:41,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the best thing you've got to know about Oblivion.

316
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:41,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

317
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Oblivion, join the guilds.

318
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:51,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you join the guilds, you can clear off their entire shelves of everything and go sell it for money.

319
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:52,763
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best part.

320
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:58,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent like a couple hours just clearing off everything until I found out about the dupe, you know,

321
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:00,555
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

322
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:15,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Sold back.

323
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:16,372
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great.

324
00:19:16,432 --> 00:19:20,473
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Kibbles and Bits in our chatroom says, Oblivion is one of those games you have to experience on your own.

325
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just too damn huge to rush, though.

326
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:23,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

327
00:19:23,314 --> 00:19:25,795
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not like a typical gaming experience.

328
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,016
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something you really have to invest a little time in.

329
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:28,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew?

330
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:31,698
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you were having problems just getting slaughtered in Oblivion, right?

331
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:32,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

332
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:32,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

333
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:36,840
[SPEAKER_03]: In Oblivion, the way it works is the enemies level up as you do.

334
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.

335
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,081
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you level up, they're going to level up, and you're still going to get slaughtered.

336
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:41,361
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

337
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I remembered reading that somewhere.

338
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,222
[SPEAKER_05]: The trick is to gear up.

339
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,043
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I need, because I'm still using the crappy gear you get in the beginning, minus what I raided from dead bodies.

340
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:50,804
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I need to gear up.

341
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:51,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, gear up.

342
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when they hit me, I take massive damage.

343
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:57,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I thought I was going to say that.

344
00:19:57,287 --> 00:19:58,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's see.

345
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:09,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up Prey, because I like the demo, but I haven't played past the demo sequence yet, so more to come on Prey next time.

346
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:11,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wait for them to die.

347
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:30,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, real quickly, one other game I want to mention, Cloning Clyde.

348
00:20:30,307 --> 00:20:31,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked that up too from Xbox Live Arcade.

349
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely reminds me of an old Super Nintendo puzzler with a sense of humor.

350
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:42,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep wanting to say like Krusty's Funhouse type game, except Krusty's Funhouse wasn't that great, but Cloning Clyde's fun.

351
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:48,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you are curious if you're going to like Cloning Clyde or not, seriously, just check out the demo because I think it's got a really good demo.

352
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:49,935
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Galaga?

353
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:11,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Galaga I checked out too, thank you for reminding me.

354
00:21:11,797 --> 00:21:13,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Very easy achievement points.

355
00:21:13,557 --> 00:21:15,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Super easy achievement points.

356
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:21,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I had a friend on my Xbox Live list who got all 200 achievement points within a couple hours.

357
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,039
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about Galaga is it lets you continue from the stage where you died.

358
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:28,500
[SPEAKER_05]: So getting that level 30 achievement or whatever is not a problem.

359
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,941
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the monsters and those achievements, you kind of pick those up along the way.

360
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:35,861
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's very few that require a lot of real skill.

361
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:38,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Galaga...

362
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:49,361
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really an arcade game that I remember fondly from the 80s, but I know other people do who are probably yelling at me right now for saying that.

363
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:51,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it just really depends what type of games you were raised on.

364
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:53,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there is an audience for Galaga.

365
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:55,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I was it because I got bored of it pretty quick.

366
00:21:55,925 --> 00:22:02,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf, Bobby, he was saying that be careful with the side images because it causes burn-in on your screens.

367
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:04,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

368
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:07,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not a game I would play for an incredibly long time anyway.

369
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,501
[SPEAKER_02]: What you just said reminded me of something, too.

370
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:10,942
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

371
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:18,427
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone's ever interested in any of those Namco keychains like they were handing out at E3, you can actually buy them at Kid Robot store.

372
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:19,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's that?

373
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:22,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Kid Robot has a site online.

374
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:24,751
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones that were selling those big vinyl gorillas figures.

375
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:25,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

376
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:28,253
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have a store on Hayton Ashbury in San Francisco.

377
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:28,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

378
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:33,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Namco and E3 and stuff, I saw some old pictures last night.

379
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:34,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I found some old pictures.

380
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:38,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I found the pictures from the year that they were demoing We Heart Katamari.

381
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,401
[SPEAKER_05]: And remember when they had the giant Katamari and everybody was putting their stuff on it?

382
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:44,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So I found the picture of us putting the ferret on the Katamari.

383
00:22:46,402 --> 00:22:49,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I also put one of our demo samplers on there.

384
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:50,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember that.

385
00:22:50,343 --> 00:22:51,764
[SPEAKER_02]: And a Reject False Icon sticker.

386
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:56,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, see in chat, GK128 says, Galaga sucks, you sir suck.

387
00:22:57,685 --> 00:22:58,825
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that Galaga sucks.

388
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:02,626
[SPEAKER_05]: It certainly led the way for a certain genre of games.

389
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,927
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's not my bag, baby.

390
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:07,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you can continue from where you died.

391
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:08,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

392
00:23:09,108 --> 00:23:12,908
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of eliminates the whole hardcore factor of Galaga.

393
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:14,129
[SPEAKER_03]: They hit it with a nerf bat.

394
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:15,649
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't have to.

395
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:16,329
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to.

396
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:18,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't they put, like, Ikaruga on live?

397
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

398
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I mean, that would be... But that's right, there's better stuff coming.

399
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,971
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually just reminded me of the other pinball I saw.

400
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:24,991
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Austin Powers' pinball.

401
00:23:26,326 --> 00:23:26,766
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

402
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:29,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we need Radiant Silvergun.

403
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:31,848
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

404
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:32,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

405
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:32,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend of Zaku.

406
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:33,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Right there.

407
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Radiant Silvergun would be awesome.

408
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Zaku has it as well.

409
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Gradius, greater than Galaga.

410
00:23:38,271 --> 00:23:39,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see Gradius.

411
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:42,192
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I already have Gradius Collection on PSP.

412
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Gradius was coming.

413
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:43,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it?

414
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,214
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's some shooter that was in that.

415
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:47,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Gradius and Contra.

416
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:49,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra and Super Contra are coming.

417
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:49,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they?

418
00:23:50,115 --> 00:23:50,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Contra.

419
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:51,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Contra.

420
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Contra was.

421
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:54,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know it was Contra and Super Contra.

422
00:23:54,562 --> 00:24:01,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra and Super Contra and I think Gradius and I've heard some other ones and Street Fighter 2 next week.

423
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:04,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw Time Pilot in that preview too.

424
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:05,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Time Pilot.

425
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:06,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Rally X is coming.

426
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,271
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

427
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:13,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week of course Street Fighter 2 which I couldn't give a shit.

428
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:13,814
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

429
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:16,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that it's finally here I'm very meh about the whole thing.

430
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:18,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like I kind of don't care anymore.

431
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:19,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that it's here it's like

432
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:21,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it really going to be that great?

433
00:24:21,822 --> 00:24:24,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

434
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:31,785
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, something else I think that our chat room might be vaguely interested in is that the person that we bought our Twilight Zone from was the guy who owned Working Designs.

435
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:33,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

436
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:39,106
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have a Goemon doll now that they were going to put out with the next game they were going to do.

437
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:40,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get them on the show.

438
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:41,167
[SPEAKER_02]: We should talk to them.

439
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:41,887
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

440
00:24:41,907 --> 00:24:44,327
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll still get a copy of Sega Ages for Saturn.

441
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:45,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

442
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:47,428
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought that that would be just a fun little bit.

443
00:24:48,499 --> 00:24:51,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie of the OL Army says Konami was a lot better than Namco in the arcade.

444
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:55,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it just depends what you're into.

445
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:57,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on if you read a Namco arcade.

446
00:24:58,243 --> 00:24:59,723
[SPEAKER_05]: It just depends on the type of games you're into.

447
00:25:00,023 --> 00:25:02,124
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, enough about my gaming week.

448
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:02,524
[SPEAKER_05]: That's enough.

449
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:06,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do some housekeeping real, real quick, and then we'll get into the gaming news.

450
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:07,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Just some quick housekeeping things.

451
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:10,167
[SPEAKER_05]: OrangeDanceRadio.com had some website downtime earlier this week.

452
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:11,347
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not sure what caused it.

453
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:14,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was some type of DNS issue, tech stuff that goes above my head.

454
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:23,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Needless to say, when stuff like that happens, our fearless webmaster, MrVXJasonXV, who we love and adore because he does the job for free, is on things like that.

455
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,411
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're sorry, but that type of stuff is going to be inevitable, that things go down.

456
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:34,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, it's all free to you guys, so just keep in mind, things are going to happen once in a while.

457
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:36,613
[SPEAKER_05]: We are addressing some things with the website.

458
00:25:36,773 --> 00:25:41,975
[SPEAKER_05]: You may see some real facelifts coming to the website in the future, but a lot of that is a long ways down the line.

459
00:25:42,255 --> 00:25:43,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't talk about much more than that yet.

460
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:45,622
[SPEAKER_02]: We could, but it'd be a lie.

461
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:46,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'd have to kill you.

462
00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:47,703
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

463
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:52,585
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd have to reveal what happens at the secret OLR staff meetings, and then you'd have to die.

464
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:54,086
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the murders commence.

465
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:58,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we want to say something about the podcast awards real quick.

466
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:02,091
[SPEAKER_05]: The podcast awards nominations were announced, and we're not there.

467
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:03,431
[SPEAKER_05]: But, oh well.

468
00:26:04,232 --> 00:26:08,674
[SPEAKER_05]: The folks that were nominated, all five of them, independent podcasts, which is pretty awesome.

469
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:09,355
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

470
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:12,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And we said, you know, we'd be happy as long as an independent won it.

471
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:13,637
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we can't.

472
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:15,328
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to hog it.

473
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:16,888
[SPEAKER_05]: We can share.

474
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:20,910
[SPEAKER_05]: No, in all seriousness, folks that were nominated, there's some great shows in there.

475
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:24,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the folks at Gamertag, very passionate about what they do.

476
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:27,014
[SPEAKER_05]: DreamStation, huge community over there.

477
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:32,176
[SPEAKER_05]: VGN Radio, fellow all-games show, completely different vibe than what we do here, but that's awesome.

478
00:26:32,476 --> 00:26:34,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I think every independent show should do their own thing.

479
00:26:35,098 --> 00:26:40,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Podtacular, Halo, nothing but Halo, which for some gamers, that's what they do, nothing but Halo.

480
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:42,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Good show over there as well.

481
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:43,562
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

482
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:44,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun.

483
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Go vote.

484
00:26:45,764 --> 00:26:47,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Vote for an independent podcast.

485
00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:47,925
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have a choice.

486
00:26:47,945 --> 00:26:49,825
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to vote for an independent podcast.

487
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:56,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we could invite the winners on our show so we could hand over our crown.

488
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:57,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Like at Miss America, what they do.

489
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is our crown?

490
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:02,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's sitting on Jamie's fireplace.

491
00:27:03,528 --> 00:27:04,588
[SPEAKER_02]: It is sitting on my fireplace.

492
00:27:04,988 --> 00:27:06,509
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on my mantle.

493
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:06,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

494
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:07,789
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll come up with something.

495
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:08,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, though.

496
00:27:08,969 --> 00:27:37,587
[SPEAKER_05]: have fun remember independent podcasts we're there to support each other I think every independent podcaster brings something different to the table and you look at those shows I previously named and they're all they've all got something different like you know we have the music you know we have that history being the music game and you know we go to anime expos because a lot of our fan base goes there's these other shows have their own spin on things that they do so you know it's great and diversity is what makes the independent stand out over the commercial stuff um

497
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:55,212
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way, though, I almost kind of feel sorry for whoever wins, because you're going to have to put up with that same backlash that we did last year from kind of the corporates who I think probably didn't like it that we won, because there was some nasty stuff written about us, including, oh, we're liars, we're drunks, da-da-da, whatever.

498
00:27:55,652 --> 00:27:56,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Only on certain shows.

499
00:27:56,893 --> 00:27:57,714
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still here.

500
00:27:58,054 --> 00:27:59,075
[SPEAKER_05]: We're almost at episode 200.

501
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:02,718
[SPEAKER_05]: You corp casts are not going to scare us away, and, you know...

502
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:03,586
[SPEAKER_05]: So what?

503
00:28:03,606 --> 00:28:04,127
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get nominated.

504
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:06,648
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fun to do an entire show of lies.

505
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:09,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love that.

506
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,150
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

507
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Lying and being drunk.

508
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,092
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be excellent.

509
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:14,653
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

510
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:15,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Drunken lie show.

511
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:15,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.

512
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun with the podcast awards this year.

513
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:19,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Go vote.

514
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:24,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And vote in the other categories, too, because there's some other independent podcasters in other categories.

515
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:27,401
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some I've been listening to since, you know, that have nothing to do with gaming.

516
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:30,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been listening to since we started podcasting and good stuff out there.

517
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:36,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some actual gaming news now, and huge news, Jamie, huge news.

518
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:38,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very big.

519
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:46,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know how every year we get our butts into E3 and cover all the big news that's coming out?

520
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?

521
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:50,002
[SPEAKER_02]: That has gone right down the crapper.

522
00:28:50,423 --> 00:28:54,406
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be no more E3 as it is known now.

523
00:28:55,186 --> 00:28:57,628
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an important footnote, as it is known now.

524
00:28:58,288 --> 00:28:59,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there might be something.

525
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:09,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, basically, Doug Lowenstein, who's the president of Entertainment Software Association, is going to make the announcement that it's gone.

526
00:29:09,155 --> 00:29:09,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye, kaput.

527
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:18,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it kind of stinks that we're recording on Sunday, because there'll be more information on this tomorrow, Monday, but we won't be here until next Sunday to really talk about it.

528
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:27,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of the reason being is that the publishers are, I guess, they're going, you need to pay attention to us.

529
00:29:29,763 --> 00:29:29,963
[SPEAKER_02]: We're

530
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:32,909
[SPEAKER_02]: We want love, too.

531
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:37,893
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they whined, and E3 listened.

532
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:39,615
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no more E3.

533
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:47,141
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is talk of smaller shows next year, different, more focused events.

534
00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:48,942
[SPEAKER_02]: There already are other shows that go on.

535
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:50,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like, you know, the developers put on their own things.

536
00:29:50,984 --> 00:29:52,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft did something recently, right?

537
00:29:52,785 --> 00:29:55,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the Microsoft Vision Retail Conference.

538
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:56,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami's got something coming up.

539
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'm supposed to say that, but Konami has something coming up, and...

540
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:02,758
[SPEAKER_05]: There's other stuff, too, as well.

541
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,800
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the own developers put on their own shows.

542
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft's X06 is coming up.

543
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:10,182
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to suck to not have it all in one roof.

544
00:30:10,662 --> 00:30:15,425
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it will keep, I think, a more even flow of information out for people.

545
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:16,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it easier on us.

546
00:30:17,366 --> 00:30:29,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, if we have the different shows come up, introduce their news, we're not putting out... You know, Loki was working his butt off on the PSP site.

547
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:44,960
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of having to cram everything in and get the information out there before the next guy there's actually going we'll be able to put it out in more digestible forms for other people I think did you see this coming did anybody see this coming yeah

548
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:46,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw them fussing about it.

549
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:49,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they were just going to close it off to certain groups.

550
00:30:50,271 --> 00:31:01,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe that might be what they're doing because we've heard downsizing of the show mentioned a lot where it's going to be a very select audience meeting with developers in meeting rooms.

551
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:03,746
[SPEAKER_05]: But that kind of screws a lot of the small people out.

552
00:31:03,826 --> 00:31:05,127
[SPEAKER_05]: It screws over the small press.

553
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:06,649
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way in hell we're going to get in there.

554
00:31:07,069 --> 00:31:08,690
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's going to screw over Kensha.

555
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:17,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody that had a show in Kensha with the exception of Red Octane is going to get screwed too, which is kind of sad because there was some pretty kick-butt stuff in Kensha.

556
00:31:18,275 --> 00:31:19,635
[SPEAKER_05]: How are they going to get it out there now?

557
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:22,036
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of sad.

558
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:33,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but I mean it's hard to say because all we have to go off of right now is like kind of a, well, I wouldn't call it rumors, but a very cloudy statement is all we really have to go off of right now.

559
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:42,085
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, for me, E3 kind of started becoming a farce when there was that whole line of people to see Paris Hilton.

560
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:46,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, that was my first clue that something's up with the show that's going to change.

561
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:52,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that whole freaking hours-long line of people to see Paris Hilton, that's not what E3 is about.

562
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:53,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam West, that's okay.

563
00:31:53,587 --> 00:31:53,987
[SPEAKER_05]: He's cool.

564
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:55,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Paris Hilton, not cool.

565
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:57,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because she had a game.

566
00:31:58,048 --> 00:31:59,828
[SPEAKER_04]: And how did she have a game anyways?

567
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:01,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Her likeness is in it.

568
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:01,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

569
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:02,889
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of stupid.

570
00:32:04,282 --> 00:32:07,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Blaze Revolution says, OK, Independent Gamers Conference in our chat room, by the way.

571
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Independent Gamers Conference, something for those Kensha Halls companies.

572
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:15,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a great idea, but will it be covered by the big gaming sites?

573
00:32:17,255 --> 00:32:18,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And granted, we cover it.

574
00:32:19,014 --> 00:32:29,279
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, we'd like to think that we could take on corporate, but the fact of the matter is, a lot of people get their news from the corporate sites, so the corporate folks don't cover it, or give it as a little footnote in their magazine.

575
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:43,446
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact of the matter is, the corporates are the ones that are at the top of the press list anyways when it comes to these small little sites, or, you know, get-togethers anyways, you know, like, you know, EA's just have their little press event and stuff, and, uh...

576
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:50,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the smaller guys don't see invites because, you know what, in their eyes, the smaller guy doesn't really matter.

577
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:54,734
[SPEAKER_05]: PooEater says, oh no, what will G4 do for one week a year?

578
00:32:56,035 --> 00:33:01,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Bandit in our chatroom says, did anyone see the video of when E3 opened this year and saw how many people were running just to get to the Wii?

579
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:02,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

580
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:03,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

581
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:09,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, the Wii was a great thing to check out, but that probably is part of the reason why E3 is changing.

582
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:11,347
[SPEAKER_05]: You put all that together.

583
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:13,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

584
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:18,822
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you like to see happen from all this?

585
00:33:21,723 --> 00:33:26,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do think the idea of independent shows being the more likely thing.

586
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:35,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do like the idea of different specific companies putting out events where they can cater to their audience a little bit better.

587
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:39,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Put more focus into it instead of just their little corner of E3 and having to compete with everybody else there.

588
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:45,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be cheaper for them anyways because they don't have to make these giant elaborate booths.

589
00:33:45,222 --> 00:33:48,343
[SPEAKER_04]: They can just rent out a building like Konami's Gamer Day.

590
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:52,824
[SPEAKER_04]: They rented out a club and they just had some machines set up and stuff.

591
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:55,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that was a lot less money for them.

592
00:33:55,264 --> 00:34:03,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a club in the middle of the day when it's not open anyways, that probably didn't cost as much as running a multi-million dollar booth.

593
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:06,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Banda in chat has a good idea.

594
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:08,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Independent shows open to the public.

595
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not have your Kenshiya show that's open to the public?

596
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Get everybody talking about it.

597
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:15,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, haven't they been trying stuff like this?

598
00:34:15,663 --> 00:34:20,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, well, you've got PAX, for example, which is kind of like an E3, you know, in a sense.

599
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:25,808
[SPEAKER_04]: You've also got, you know, that show that was in San Francisco, I think, that they had some stuff there.

600
00:34:26,988 --> 00:34:33,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like a lot of small... There's the New York City thing they have, the October one that some of our listeners are trying to get us to go to.

601
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:34,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember the name of it now.

602
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,332
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the big DDR tourney.

603
00:34:35,352 --> 00:34:36,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Visual Life or something.

604
00:34:36,253 --> 00:34:37,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, something like that.

605
00:34:38,514 --> 00:34:42,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard of another one in Pennsylvania somewhere that's a big show.

606
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not just do it?

607
00:34:46,222 --> 00:34:52,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know about this, but why don't they just do the mall tours again?

608
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:55,110
[SPEAKER_04]: The mall tours?

609
00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:57,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Get into a mall and show off your new game.

610
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Go right to where the consumer is.

611
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:01,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

612
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,959
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be very interesting to see what happens as time goes on.

613
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think there's going to be a show that's trying to take the E3 crown?

614
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:12,642
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think what's going to happen is E3 will still be around next year.

615
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:18,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just going to be a lot smaller and more retarded who gets invited.

616
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:19,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter anyways.

617
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,844
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of going that way anyways.

618
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Each year you go there.

619
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:25,706
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time we went there, we went there as general admission or whatever.

620
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:27,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Then everything was press only.

621
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:36,528
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you go there last year and we're press and you go there and know, oh sorry, you're not good enough press to get into our press little thing here.

622
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So next year you come back with even more credentials.

623
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:43,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, you're just still not good enough as these people that have been doing it longer than you.

624
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:45,496
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets more ridiculous.

625
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Our chat room is yelling...

626
00:35:47,805 --> 00:35:50,846
[SPEAKER_05]: The East Coast Contingent is yelling digital life, digital life.

627
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:55,569
[SPEAKER_05]: October 4th through 6th, digital life is where the little guys get their chance and all that.

628
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:58,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe that's something that's going to take the place.

629
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:04,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Our good buddy Bobby Blackwell from All Games reminded me of what the deal is in Pennsylvania.

630
00:36:04,273 --> 00:36:08,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in Philadelphia, America's Video Game Expo at vgexpo.com.

631
00:36:08,795 --> 00:36:10,636
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently All Games is doing something with that.

632
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:17,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be pretty cool because I don't know what's going to happen now to E3 Outpost Electric Boogaloo that was supposed to happen in 2007.

633
00:36:18,118 --> 00:36:19,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I say they do it anyway.

634
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:22,082
[SPEAKER_05]: The E3 funeral.

635
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:23,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd go.

636
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:24,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, if you go, we'll go.

637
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:25,565
[SPEAKER_05]: The E3 memorial.

638
00:36:26,006 --> 00:36:26,586
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 memorial.

639
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have no idea what's going to happen with that.

640
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It just depends on what E3 turns into.

641
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we should save up our money and go to Tokyo Game Show.

642
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,450
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be pretty rad.

643
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:39,295
[SPEAKER_05]: You think the Tokyo Game Show will end up taking the crown on this stuff?

644
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:40,436
[SPEAKER_05]: It does anyway.

645
00:36:40,476 --> 00:36:41,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in a way, yeah.

646
00:36:41,758 --> 00:36:42,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it does in a way.

647
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:45,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Even Tokyo Game Show I think is too big.

648
00:36:45,941 --> 00:36:47,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally like these smaller shows.

649
00:36:48,603 --> 00:36:50,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, Konami's Gamer Day.

650
00:36:50,385 --> 00:36:52,046
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to play the games.

651
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:55,549
[SPEAKER_04]: There was not lines to play stuff.

652
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:56,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

653
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:57,050
[SPEAKER_04]: It was small.

654
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way it should be.

655
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:00,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody got to play the games.

656
00:37:00,273 --> 00:37:01,514
[SPEAKER_04]: They got all the information.

657
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:03,175
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

658
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:08,419
[SPEAKER_04]: None of the bullshit of, oh, well, sorry, you got to make a meeting in order to see this game that we're showing.

659
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:11,942
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell do you go to a convention for to advertise your game...

660
00:37:12,794 --> 00:37:14,295
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you don't show your game.

661
00:37:14,615 --> 00:37:15,896
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the dumbest thing ever.

662
00:37:16,056 --> 00:37:17,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I didn't understand that at all.

663
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make any sense.

664
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:22,841
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, especially with, you know, the Nintendo thing.

665
00:37:22,881 --> 00:37:27,464
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of pissed me off a little bit because you go there to hype up your new machine so what do you do?

666
00:37:27,484 --> 00:37:30,026
[SPEAKER_04]: You make a line and you hold it behind closed doors.

667
00:37:30,886 --> 00:37:31,587
[SPEAKER_04]: That's stupid.

668
00:37:33,288 --> 00:37:33,848
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dumb.

669
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:36,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't get what they're trying to do.

670
00:37:37,031 --> 00:37:37,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

671
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:38,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, um...

672
00:37:39,572 --> 00:37:42,802
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to open up our voicemails of the week on this topic.

673
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:49,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Showroll, there's something different listed, but I think with this breaking news, we should shift our voicemail of the week to this topic.

674
00:37:49,954 --> 00:37:52,435
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to give us a call, it's 916-226-9067.

675
00:37:53,556 --> 00:37:57,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Not right now during the show, if you're listening live, but any time during the week, give that a call.

676
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:00,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you don't pay your phone bill, then you need to have somebody's permission.

677
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And give us a call.

678
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,540
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to know your thoughts.

679
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,422
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about this announcement with E3?

680
00:38:05,462 --> 00:38:09,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially, because there'll be more information on Monday after we've taped.

681
00:38:09,864 --> 00:38:11,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Really want to know what your guys' thoughts are.

682
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:13,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Is E3 going to be as relevant as it once was?

683
00:38:13,786 --> 00:38:20,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something that... If not, where do you think the must-be place is going to be next year?

684
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,571
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to know your thoughts.

685
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:22,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So leave us a voicemail.

686
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:23,792
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 916-226-9671.

687
00:38:23,832 --> 00:38:35,700
[SPEAKER_04]: You know where I kind of wanted to go because I knew Nellie wasn't going to let me go to E3 next year, but now she's even more happy that it's canceled.

688
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least, you know, possibly canceled.

689
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:40,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Comic-Con.

690
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:42,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Comic-Con would be fun.

691
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,583
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be interesting to see if Comic-Con picks up some of this.

692
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:47,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Comic-Con had a ton of games there anyway.

693
00:38:47,323 --> 00:38:47,703
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

694
00:38:49,104 --> 00:38:50,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, they have movie stuff.

695
00:38:50,264 --> 00:38:55,225
[SPEAKER_04]: We could speculate forever, but we won't know for real until we get some more information.

696
00:38:55,245 --> 00:39:00,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Comic-Con's talking about another show that's way too much stuff going on.

697
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:03,608
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff that doesn't even have to do with comics.

698
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:04,468
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

699
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:07,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to another story here.

700
00:39:07,738 --> 00:39:12,701
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about independent podcasts and independent developers being hurt by E3.

701
00:39:13,022 --> 00:39:14,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about this independent production.

702
00:39:15,043 --> 00:39:22,889
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some folks from this production on our show a couple months ago, and it's a game that's being made called The Silver Lining.

703
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:30,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, at one time, this was known as King's Quest IX, The Silver Lining, but there was a whole little bit of back and forth with Vivendi, who owns the rights to King Quest.

704
00:39:30,552 --> 00:39:36,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Vivendi, there was a whole Save the Silver Lining campaign, and they were, you know, I'd call it a success.

705
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:41,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Vivendi is allowing this game to be released, only the title is now simply The Silver Lining.

706
00:39:41,156 --> 00:39:42,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they had a big press event today.

707
00:39:42,857 --> 00:39:48,479
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a virtual press event, and they were nice enough to invite me, because we had them on the show previously, so I checked it out, and...

708
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I would call this King's Quest labor of love.

709
00:39:52,431 --> 00:40:02,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is so obvious to me that the folks behind this game just absolutely love these characters that I'm assuming most of them grew up with, you know, through the various King's Quest games.

710
00:40:03,095 --> 00:40:03,775
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you blame them?

711
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,456
[SPEAKER_05]: The King's Quest characters were awesome.

712
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:07,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Even I love, like, King's Quest 4, Rosella, and, you know...

713
00:40:08,578 --> 00:40:09,018
[SPEAKER_05]: and all that.

714
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:12,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have really just poured their hearts into this fan project.

715
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:17,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And their big news today is that they've actually released a playable demo that you can download for free.

716
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:18,690
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to check this out?

717
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:21,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the other cool part about this.

718
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:23,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio, we're mirroring that demo.

719
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:25,539
[SPEAKER_05]: You can download it on our site right now.

720
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:49,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out www.orangeslaunchradio.com Go to the downloads page and you're going to see what you heard on the show recently You're going to see the Silver Lining demo available to you It's about 77 megs, it's free, check it out The art style is very King's Quest 5, King's Quest 6-ish It's kind of 3D

721
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:52,888
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not unfaithful to the previous games.

722
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:54,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very cool.

723
00:40:54,149 --> 00:40:54,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.

724
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:59,393
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an early build, but it just is a sign of things to come.

725
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:00,834
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not just that.

726
00:41:01,555 --> 00:41:07,140
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually had a guy write an original song for the game, and they released the song today.

727
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's pretty good.

728
00:41:08,481 --> 00:41:09,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's amazing.

729
00:41:09,622 --> 00:41:10,622
[SPEAKER_05]: They have voice actors.

730
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:11,803
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

731
00:41:11,863 --> 00:41:17,608
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like what you'd see going into a high-dollar production, but it's all happening on an independent scale.

732
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:18,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

733
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:19,376
[SPEAKER_05]: www.tsl-game.com

734
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it the Project Gotham 360 bundle?

735
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:52,543
[SPEAKER_04]: The Project Gotham 3 with the 360 being bundled and everything?

736
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Not happening.

737
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite what all those other websites out there say, not happening.

738
00:41:57,504 --> 00:41:59,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Confirmed by Microsoft.

739
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:02,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my thing though.

740
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:04,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Not happening in the United States.

741
00:42:05,267 --> 00:42:12,189
[SPEAKER_04]: All these sites that are listing it from what I've noticed so far, like Toys R Us I think was in Canada and I think the EB one I saw was in Canada too.

742
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe happening in Canada.

743
00:42:15,305 --> 00:42:21,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be something because maybe the 360 is just not selling as well as the United States.

744
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:29,889
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might see a bundle either being put together by retailers themselves or maybe being done in another country.

745
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,551
[SPEAKER_04]: So look for that, but it is not happening in the United States.

746
00:42:34,171 --> 00:42:39,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they really have to worry about dropping the price, especially with the PlayStation 3 being so expensive.

747
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,553
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really not worried about that.

748
00:42:42,556 --> 00:42:46,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Eddie is one of our Canadian listeners in chat and says there is no EB game website for Canada.

749
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:47,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whatever.

750
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:51,782
[SPEAKER_04]: The one site I saw, I assumed it was Canada because all their prices were wrong.

751
00:42:51,842 --> 00:42:58,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they were listing everything at $69.99 retail for all the Xbox 360 games and that's way off.

752
00:42:58,305 --> 00:43:00,266
[SPEAKER_04]: So, whatever.

753
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:00,987
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

754
00:43:01,547 --> 00:43:03,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be happening in another country.

755
00:43:03,308 --> 00:43:06,270
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my only assumption that people are getting this from some place.

756
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,611
[SPEAKER_04]: But Microsoft is saying no.

757
00:43:08,911 --> 00:43:11,553
[SPEAKER_04]: So, take it as you will.

758
00:43:12,887 --> 00:43:14,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have some things that are coming out.

759
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:15,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's good.

760
00:43:15,328 --> 00:43:15,968
[SPEAKER_05]: That's refreshing.

761
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:17,549
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the UK.

762
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:18,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

763
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:20,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have more news about games that aren't coming out in this country.

764
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because they probably already have or will be around the same time.

765
00:43:24,072 --> 00:43:24,432
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

766
00:43:24,552 --> 00:43:26,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So enjoy these UK guys.

767
00:43:26,753 --> 00:43:30,254
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the games that will be released first week in August.

768
00:43:30,494 --> 00:43:32,775
[SPEAKER_02]: On the first, we have Pox Nora for PC.

769
00:43:33,755 --> 00:43:37,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have, on the fourth, Monster House for various systems.

770
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:39,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Pro Stroke Golf World Tour 2007, ooh, golf.

771
00:43:39,858 --> 00:43:40,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And Stroke.

772
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:47,003
[SPEAKER_02]: and SingStar Anthems on PlayStation 2.

773
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:51,567
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a few things that are announced.

774
00:43:51,847 --> 00:43:53,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, SingStar Anthems is the gay one, isn't it?

775
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:54,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

776
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:55,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is.

777
00:43:55,129 --> 00:43:57,651
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one that they're marketing towards the gay audience.

778
00:43:57,671 --> 00:43:59,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember talking about this a few shows ago.

779
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:01,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Still not interested, sorry.

780
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:08,440
[SPEAKER_02]: But our listeners over there should keep their eyes open, though later on in the month there's going to be Dig Dug Digging Strike.

781
00:44:09,033 --> 00:44:13,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Guilty Gear, Dust Strikers, and Star Fox Command.

782
00:44:14,677 --> 00:44:15,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, very cool.

783
00:44:15,817 --> 00:44:16,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Good stuff.

784
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:19,560
[SPEAKER_04]: In the United States, though, we're getting some pretty neat stuff.

785
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,783
[SPEAKER_04]: First thing's going to be Flat Out 2 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and also, I believe, the PC.

786
00:44:26,104 --> 00:44:27,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So that should be pretty awesome.

787
00:44:28,205 --> 00:44:29,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're getting Super Monkey Ball Adventure.

788
00:44:30,689 --> 00:44:33,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're a fan of the Super Monkey Ball games, look for that.

789
00:44:33,832 --> 00:44:36,034
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of those freaking Monkey Ball games are there now?

790
00:44:36,214 --> 00:44:36,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Too many.

791
00:44:37,054 --> 00:44:39,016
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 2, GameCube, and PSP.

792
00:44:40,257 --> 00:44:40,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

793
00:44:40,998 --> 00:44:46,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe there was also Barnyard coming out, which is based on the upcoming animated film.

794
00:44:47,043 --> 00:44:49,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, that just made me think of Barnstorming.

795
00:44:50,706 --> 00:44:53,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're an old-school 2600 player, you've got to know Barnstorming.

796
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:55,630
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the baddest games they had.

797
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, bad meaning good, because this was the 80s after all.

798
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:00,780
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the baddest games on the Xbox 360 was Barnstorming.

799
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:01,420
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

800
00:45:01,881 --> 00:45:03,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't they remake that?

801
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:05,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I want Barnstorming 2006.

802
00:45:05,982 --> 00:45:09,144
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Xbox 360.

803
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:10,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Move over, chickens, here I come.

804
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:13,966
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically the good stuff.

805
00:45:14,106 --> 00:45:20,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really waiting for the week after that, though, where Dead Rising's coming out.

806
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:21,950
[SPEAKER_05]: 99 Nights is around the corner, too, right?

807
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Rising's coming out, and 99 Nights is the week after that.

808
00:45:25,011 --> 00:45:25,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Very exciting.

809
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:26,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh...

810
00:45:27,216 --> 00:45:27,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of good stuff.

811
00:45:27,716 --> 00:45:30,418
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Saints Row at the end of August, as well as Madden.

812
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:38,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at a GameStop today, finally getting rid of Top Spin 2, because I just didn't freaking play it, and picking up Prey.

813
00:45:39,062 --> 00:46:02,844
[SPEAKER_05]: and um they uh were taking the pre-orders for uh you know those games but they were like you know they had the demo or they had the um really nice setup there for 99 Nights coming soon Dead Rising coming soon all that stuff so and I checked out the trailer on Xbox 360 for Dead Rising very bloody very fun oh I can't wait parents are gonna be mad Jack Thompson's gonna have a stroke it's gonna be great ooh really?

814
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:04,906
[SPEAKER_02]: get that on tape somebody

815
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:07,185
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sopranos on Xbox 360 It got the big boot

816
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:40,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be honest, I totally forgot they were making this game, so no loss here.

817
00:46:40,408 --> 00:46:41,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't watch the show.

818
00:46:41,308 --> 00:46:41,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what happened?

819
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that the reason's funny.

820
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:47,932
[SPEAKER_02]: THQ is saying because there's no difference between that and the PlayStation 2 version.

821
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:48,793
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

822
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:53,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that hasn't stopped them from releasing other multi-platform games?

823
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:54,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then again, they're not EA.

824
00:46:55,237 --> 00:46:55,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's true.

825
00:46:55,757 --> 00:46:57,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe this is a different developer.

826
00:46:57,278 --> 00:47:00,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they just have a different outlook on this, a more realistic outlook of,

827
00:47:01,138 --> 00:47:03,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we just don't want to upcode the damn thing and sell it again.

828
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:04,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's just a waste of our time.

829
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:13,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they were saying that after they spoke to their... After a few financial conferences, they basically said it's discontinued.

830
00:47:14,462 --> 00:47:16,202
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation 2 version is still going to go through.

831
00:47:16,222 --> 00:47:22,344
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be out around Christmas or Yule or whatever holiday you worship.

832
00:47:22,524 --> 00:47:28,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in time for the show to be going off the air, from what I understand, because I think their last season's coming up, or early 2007 or something, so...

833
00:47:29,707 --> 00:47:34,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the game is supposed to be sort of a GTA style, as in you go out and do jobs.

834
00:47:35,871 --> 00:47:37,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't watch the surprise.

835
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:38,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I have to roll my eyes a little bit at that.

836
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:42,494
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of seems like all these mob things are caught in between Scarface.

837
00:47:42,514 --> 00:47:45,116
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all copying the... Hey, don't talk bad about Scarface.

838
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:46,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, I'm not.

839
00:47:46,337 --> 00:47:48,998
[SPEAKER_05]: The movie's a legacy, but I'm just saying.

840
00:47:49,038 --> 00:47:55,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope when they say GTA-like, it means inspired by, but very different.

841
00:47:57,045 --> 00:48:00,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're all kind of down in that sandbox games.

842
00:48:01,127 --> 00:48:02,687
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically like a genre now.

843
00:48:02,788 --> 00:48:03,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's okay.

844
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:08,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, speaking of Scarface, apparently the Xbox 360 version has been cancelled.

845
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:11,852
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I didn't realize there was an Xbox 360 version coming out.

846
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this thing was announced, what, back in E3 2005 for the 360?

847
00:48:17,878 --> 00:48:23,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't even realize that they had decided to continue doing that because it's always been PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PSP.

848
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:24,781
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not surprised.

849
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:27,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie in our chatroom says Scarface was never officially announced for 360.

850
00:48:27,982 --> 00:48:28,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

851
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:29,963
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was kind of surprised.

852
00:48:29,983 --> 00:48:31,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I don't remember that.

853
00:48:31,684 --> 00:48:34,045
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently people have been writing the news stories that it's not.

854
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, it must be true.

855
00:48:35,505 --> 00:48:36,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

856
00:48:36,326 --> 00:48:37,346
[SPEAKER_04]: If the press is saying it.

857
00:48:37,406 --> 00:48:39,387
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're not liars in the corporate media.

858
00:48:41,108 --> 00:48:41,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

859
00:48:41,548 --> 00:48:41,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Or drunks.

860
00:48:43,328 --> 00:48:46,010
[SPEAKER_04]: After all, Final Fantasy XIII looks very much like VII.

861
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:46,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, um...

862
00:48:49,436 --> 00:48:51,117
[SPEAKER_04]: The 360 Scarface not coming out.

863
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,018
[SPEAKER_04]: The PSP Scarface though is coming out.

864
00:48:53,178 --> 00:48:55,079
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, Scarface looks very similar.

865
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:58,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess it's very similar to Vice City because Vice City ripped off Scarface.

866
00:48:58,922 --> 00:49:01,324
[SPEAKER_04]: So it should be a pretty awesome game.

867
00:49:01,344 --> 00:49:03,345
[SPEAKER_04]: The voice talent in it is amazing.

868
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:05,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And just, I don't know, it looks very fun.

869
00:49:06,347 --> 00:49:07,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.

870
00:49:07,348 --> 00:49:08,369
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out in September.

871
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:10,850
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

872
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:13,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other 360 news while we're at it?

873
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:14,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do a 360.

874
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:15,233
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

875
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:19,793
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

876
00:49:20,954 --> 00:49:22,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, there is... Did she say she could do a 360?

877
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:25,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know how to read into that.

878
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:25,735
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty pornographic.

879
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:26,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

880
00:49:29,617 --> 00:49:32,438
[SPEAKER_02]: As in, I can turn around in 360 degrees.

881
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:33,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez, guys.

882
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do a 60... You know what?

883
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:38,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to finish the talk.

884
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,040
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

885
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,500
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to know that, Rob.

886
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so, 360, Xbox.

887
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:43,461
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to KTMI.

888
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:44,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox, 360, DarkSakura.

889
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:46,162
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have nothing else about the 360.

890
00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:48,483
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have something about PSP.

891
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Scarface is coming out on PSP.

892
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:54,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of a stripped down version.

893
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,612
[SPEAKER_04]: What about this game, Dawn of War?

894
00:50:12,972 --> 00:50:13,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's more.

895
00:50:14,032 --> 00:50:14,852
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a different name, too.

896
00:50:15,752 --> 00:50:17,393
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Power Money Respect.

897
00:50:18,213 --> 00:50:19,333
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a turn-based strategy.

898
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:25,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, there's this Warhammer 4000 game coming out on the 360 as well called Dawn of War.

899
00:50:26,495 --> 00:50:28,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, to be honest, I remember playing Warhammer 4000.

900
00:50:29,616 --> 00:50:30,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Space Marines.

901
00:50:30,936 --> 00:50:34,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I used to have the actual miniatures and stuff, which is pretty cool.

902
00:50:35,778 --> 00:50:36,138
[SPEAKER_04]: But the...

903
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:38,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Warhammer 4000 game.

904
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:42,545
[SPEAKER_04]: This series has been around for a long time, especially in tabletops and PC games now.

905
00:50:43,146 --> 00:50:45,728
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll actually be getting a 360 version, so that's pretty sweet.

906
00:50:46,008 --> 00:50:50,052
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also planning on making a PS3 version, of course, whenever that system finally rolls out.

907
00:50:51,453 --> 00:50:53,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So look forward to that pretty soon.

908
00:50:53,315 --> 00:50:54,436
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of nice to see them doing it.

909
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember actually Space Marines.

910
00:50:56,578 --> 00:51:04,084
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to do a Space Marines game on the PC, and it had the really cool intro song, but yeah, Space Marines kind of sucked.

911
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:08,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I have to mention the Scarface comment in our chatroom because it's kind of funny.

912
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:12,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend of Zaku says, Scarface on the PSP, say hello to my little friend.

913
00:51:12,832 --> 00:51:13,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

914
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:13,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Little?

915
00:51:13,852 --> 00:51:14,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's PSP?

916
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:16,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

917
00:51:16,813 --> 00:51:17,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

918
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:17,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

919
00:51:18,454 --> 00:51:19,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

920
00:51:20,635 --> 00:51:23,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Pooeater's tagline here, Scarface PSP.

921
00:51:23,776 --> 00:51:24,476
[SPEAKER_05]: You might as well buy it.

922
00:51:24,496 --> 00:51:25,257
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing else out.

923
00:51:26,357 --> 00:51:26,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey.

924
00:51:28,178 --> 00:51:28,738
[SPEAKER_05]: He's right.

925
00:51:28,818 --> 00:51:29,178
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

926
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:32,857
[SPEAKER_04]: What about, there's Vice City Stories coming, right?

927
00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:33,417
[SPEAKER_04]: It's October.

928
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:34,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway, moving on.

929
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:38,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Gun Showdown's also coming out that same month, though, in, you know, September.

930
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,943
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is stuff coming out on the PSP, but, and NASCAR, if you like NASCAR, whatever.

931
00:51:44,383 --> 00:51:57,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of things that are not funny, Gears of War is, apparently there's some users spamming on Xbox Live some Gears of War stuff, and people are thinking, oh, wow, it's some crappy viral campaign.

932
00:51:58,507 --> 00:52:04,569
[SPEAKER_04]: And, well, we don't really know, but a lot of the messages have been pointing back to Gears of War forum.

933
00:52:05,149 --> 00:52:06,829
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently there's more messages on there.

934
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:09,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently some giant announcement is supposed to be happening this week.

935
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:11,310
[SPEAKER_05]: How come I'm not getting spammed?

936
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:12,671
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of makes me feel left out.

937
00:52:12,871 --> 00:52:14,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not getting spammed either.

938
00:52:14,351 --> 00:52:15,392
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes me kind of sad.

939
00:52:15,452 --> 00:52:16,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a Gears of War spam.

940
00:52:16,332 --> 00:52:17,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently we're just not real press.

941
00:52:18,292 --> 00:52:19,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently not.

942
00:52:19,853 --> 00:52:21,993
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just not cool enough to be getting spammed.

943
00:52:22,253 --> 00:52:22,653
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

944
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:24,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just some dick spamming a forum.

945
00:52:25,695 --> 00:52:27,136
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens all the damn time.

946
00:52:27,296 --> 00:52:38,564
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same people spamming on live, and it's basically some stupid little... It's the main characters' names, and they're Marcus Phoenix, or M. Phoenix in this case.

947
00:52:39,745 --> 00:52:47,611
[SPEAKER_04]: He's, you know, we need your help, can't talk now, don't know who to trust, we'll send more tomorrow, and just kind of messages this very cryptic

948
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:52,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but Gears of War still looks cool, so I forgive it.

949
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,251
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was pretty hot.

950
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:56,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you really need a viral campaign?

951
00:52:56,612 --> 00:52:58,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people think the game's awesome anyways.

952
00:52:58,753 --> 00:52:59,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's true.

953
00:52:59,554 --> 00:53:03,456
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, let's hype up Halo 3 because people don't know about Halo 3.

954
00:53:03,516 --> 00:53:05,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

955
00:53:05,538 --> 00:53:06,618
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

956
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:08,179
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.

957
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:14,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, at least it's not saying, this is Marcus Fenix, and I want you to check out my new Burnout Revenge clip that I have online.

958
00:53:14,863 --> 00:53:15,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Be sure to recommend it.

959
00:53:18,823 --> 00:53:20,806
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, Biker's War, coming out in November.

960
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, November so far, because we're not sure.

961
00:53:24,973 --> 00:53:27,778
[SPEAKER_04]: They might push it up, according to some of the rumors out there.

962
00:53:28,118 --> 00:53:28,399
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

963
00:53:30,051 --> 00:53:39,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Well now, every week on this program, we like to let DarkSakura, speaking of Gears of War, we like to let DarkSakura start grinding her gears over there and surf the internet.

964
00:53:39,254 --> 00:53:40,794
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't a 360 joke, don't worry.

965
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:52,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Surf the internet up and down and back and forth and try to find a website that she wants you, yes you, our listener, to view promptly because it's awesome.

966
00:53:52,578 --> 00:53:55,619
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura, what are the kitties going to be looking at this week per your request?

967
00:54:00,524 --> 00:54:03,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Our listeners are going to be looking at the best page in the universe.

968
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:06,767
[SPEAKER_05]: OrangeSoundsRadio.com?

969
00:54:07,347 --> 00:54:07,788
[SPEAKER_05]: It's worth a try.

970
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, second best page in the universe.

971
00:54:09,128 --> 00:54:09,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, what is this?

972
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:15,851
[SPEAKER_02]: The address is Maddox, M-A-D-D-O-X dot X-Mission dot com.

973
00:54:15,871 --> 00:54:16,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.

974
00:54:17,852 --> 00:54:18,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

975
00:54:19,353 --> 00:54:22,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that this guy's sense of humor is pretty funny.

976
00:54:22,294 --> 00:54:23,295
[SPEAKER_05]: He's kind of controversial.

977
00:54:23,775 --> 00:54:24,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's controversial.

978
00:54:25,256 --> 00:54:28,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even if you don't agree with what he says, at least it's remotely entertaining.

979
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:29,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

980
00:54:30,038 --> 00:54:31,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant to get his book, though.

981
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,281
[SPEAKER_04]: The Alphabet of Manliness.

982
00:54:34,982 --> 00:54:37,463
[SPEAKER_04]: C is for Chuck Norris, and there's a whole chapter on him.

983
00:54:38,324 --> 00:54:40,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Let the Chuck Norris joke die.

984
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:42,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Step away from the Chuck Norris joke.

985
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:44,628
[SPEAKER_04]: He's talking about how badass Chuck Norris is.

986
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:46,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking to you, Barons, folks.

987
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,510
[SPEAKER_05]: We can dig it.

988
00:54:48,471 --> 00:54:52,074
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the editorials on here are as follows.

989
00:54:52,514 --> 00:54:53,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate Cameron Diaz.

990
00:54:54,775 --> 00:54:56,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Wars Episode III is Steaming Pile of Sith.

991
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,836
[SPEAKER_02]: If these words were people, I would embrace their genocide.

992
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:05,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted a video game, not an eternal damnation in hell.

993
00:55:06,518 --> 00:55:07,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a genius.

994
00:55:07,218 --> 00:55:08,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that was me playing Pink Pals.

995
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:09,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a genius.

996
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:10,459
[SPEAKER_02]: You are not.

997
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:13,920
[SPEAKER_02]: The 11 Worst Songs of 2004, which, by the way, they're all U2.

998
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:17,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Ben Stiller should star in every movie.

999
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And video games you'll never play.

1000
00:55:21,983 --> 00:55:22,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is great.

1001
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:25,464
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of video games will we never play?

1002
00:55:26,725 --> 00:55:26,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

1003
00:55:27,569 --> 00:55:27,949
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1004
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:28,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to pull that up.

1005
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:29,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me a second.

1006
00:55:30,131 --> 00:55:33,192
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that backwards compatible Barbie game on the Xbox?

1007
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:34,573
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one game I won't play.

1008
00:55:34,653 --> 00:55:37,995
[SPEAKER_03]: How about just the really manly suicide of ramming your head against the pavement?

1009
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:41,197
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what game I will play, though, that looks a lot like Barbie?

1010
00:55:42,057 --> 00:55:43,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead or Alive Extreme 2.

1011
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:47,761
[SPEAKER_05]: That trailer is minutes of entertainment.

1012
00:55:48,281 --> 00:55:50,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say hours, because the trailer's only a few minutes.

1013
00:55:50,462 --> 00:55:51,823
[SPEAKER_02]: He also puts up his hate mail, too.

1014
00:55:53,104 --> 00:55:56,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently writes a whole article's

1015
00:55:57,256 --> 00:55:57,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on hate mail.

1016
00:55:58,677 --> 00:55:59,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did one about Ikaruga.

1017
00:56:00,037 --> 00:56:02,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but then people will write hate mail just to be in the hate mail page.

1018
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:03,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

1019
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:05,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently he's also banned in several countries.

1020
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:10,282
[SPEAKER_03]: His website is not accessible from... I love what he wrote about Ikaruga, though.

1021
00:56:11,323 --> 00:56:17,886
[SPEAKER_02]: If you suck at video games, don't bother reading this review because this game is hard and I don't want whining retards who can't pass the first level bitching to me about it.

1022
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:21,550
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say this game is hard, I mean hard like nipples on the playlist.

1023
00:56:23,071 --> 00:56:24,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, I can't say that.

1024
00:56:24,352 --> 00:56:27,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, way to go, DarkSakura, trying to earn this show an explicit tag.

1025
00:56:27,855 --> 00:56:28,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say it.

1026
00:56:30,177 --> 00:56:33,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Visit for yourself to read what was too hot for DarkSakura to say on air.

1027
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:37,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And moving right along then.

1028
00:56:37,763 --> 00:56:43,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of hard, Final Fantasy XI's achievements are fucking impossible is what they are.

1029
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:46,751
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, yeah, so...

1030
00:56:47,950 --> 00:57:02,261
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, a lot of the achievements, all 32 of them, you know, are fucking impossible, including most of which are level up your character to 75, you know, excellent, you know, or just finish all the Promethea missions, finish all the changes, you know, whatever.

1031
00:57:02,281 --> 00:57:05,703
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 shitty points for getting my bard to 75.

1032
00:57:05,783 --> 00:57:07,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how long that'll take?

1033
00:57:07,665 --> 00:57:08,165
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

1034
00:57:09,502 --> 00:57:11,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you're a fucking bard.

1035
00:57:12,183 --> 00:57:14,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Bards are the easiest character to fucking level.

1036
00:57:14,744 --> 00:57:15,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, though.

1037
00:57:16,164 --> 00:57:19,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I can attest that they are not easy to level as I was a bard.

1038
00:57:20,225 --> 00:57:22,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't achievement points those supposed to be hard to get?

1039
00:57:23,126 --> 00:57:25,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're badges of honor, right?

1040
00:57:25,327 --> 00:57:26,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

1041
00:57:26,287 --> 00:57:27,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people bitch when they're too easy.

1042
00:57:27,727 --> 00:57:28,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we just bitched earlier.

1043
00:57:28,747 --> 00:57:29,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Galaga's achievements are too easy.

1044
00:57:29,848 --> 00:57:30,788
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine, that's fine.

1045
00:57:31,108 --> 00:57:34,109
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they're going to be hard, make them worth something like, you know...

1046
00:57:35,513 --> 00:57:36,894
[SPEAKER_04]: 100 points or something instead of 30.

1047
00:57:37,895 --> 00:57:43,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to play for 50,000 hours and go, 10 points!

1048
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:48,644
[SPEAKER_05]: They've only got 1,000 to distribute though because that's the Microsoft laws.

1049
00:57:48,744 --> 00:57:49,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

1050
00:57:49,324 --> 00:57:55,389
[SPEAKER_04]: They shouldn't have put achievement points anyways because no one was expecting them and they had to go put them out there and now they suck.

1051
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:56,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to go.

1052
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:57,871
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just mad because you'll never get them.

1053
00:57:58,532 --> 00:57:59,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not playing that game.

1054
00:57:59,733 --> 00:58:01,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I canceled it yesterday actually.

1055
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:02,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, but I just wasn't playing it.

1056
00:58:05,703 --> 00:58:06,483
[SPEAKER_04]: After you bought it on 360.

1057
00:58:07,064 --> 00:58:07,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1058
00:58:08,304 --> 00:58:09,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can't return that sucker.

1059
00:58:10,385 --> 00:58:11,206
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can't return it.

1060
00:58:11,426 --> 00:58:13,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday I might go back.

1061
00:58:14,267 --> 00:58:15,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I quit once before.

1062
00:58:15,668 --> 00:58:16,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go back.

1063
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:17,689
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

1064
00:58:18,149 --> 00:58:19,930
[SPEAKER_04]: One hell of an expensive frisbee.

1065
00:58:23,732 --> 00:58:26,713
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can't addict.

1066
00:58:27,693 --> 00:58:27,994
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1067
00:58:28,794 --> 00:58:29,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI.

1068
00:58:29,954 --> 00:58:30,515
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1069
00:58:30,935 --> 00:58:31,095
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1070
00:58:32,205 --> 00:58:34,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish this would happen to just about everybody that played it.

1071
00:58:34,627 --> 00:58:37,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I know some great people that play Final Fantasy XI.

1072
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:39,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't talk... I played it for years and years.

1073
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:40,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Addict.

1074
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:42,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're addicted to another crack.

1075
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I have nothing bad to say about it.

1076
00:58:44,433 --> 00:58:45,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It was time for me to move on.

1077
00:58:45,974 --> 00:58:48,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's ever a sequel, you know I'm going to be playing it.

1078
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:49,717
[SPEAKER_02]: White Mage, equal, party bitch.

1079
00:58:49,897 --> 00:58:50,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

1080
00:58:51,538 --> 00:58:51,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1081
00:58:52,398 --> 00:58:57,642
[SPEAKER_02]: However, all those people who are cheating, uh-uh, not anymore.

1082
00:58:58,582 --> 00:59:00,544
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were basically...

1083
00:59:01,744 --> 00:59:02,445
[SPEAKER_02]: caught cheating.

1084
00:59:03,265 --> 00:59:08,710
[SPEAKER_02]: They've actually banned another 2,000 accounts for the use of third-party software tools.

1085
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:13,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they just don't want to be one-upped by World of Warcraft.

1086
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:21,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Because World of Warcraft put out that press release, I don't remember if it was this week or last week, saying they banned like 30,000 people from the game or something like that.

1087
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And Squeenix is like, well, we can't let them have the last laugh.

1088
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:25,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's ban some people too.

1089
00:59:26,804 --> 00:59:28,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because we can.

1090
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:30,787
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, you know...

1091
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:36,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI, honestly, you need the windower.

1092
00:59:37,304 --> 00:59:38,245
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs the windower.

1093
00:59:39,146 --> 00:59:42,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but that's a third-party utility, and technically, didn't they ban people for that?

1094
00:59:42,448 --> 00:59:46,972
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically anyone who's using the windower is probably included in the ban.

1095
00:59:47,532 --> 00:59:51,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's stupid, because why should they monopolize your resources?

1096
00:59:53,777 --> 00:59:55,258
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I love World of Warcraft.

1097
00:59:55,278 --> 00:59:57,920
[SPEAKER_02]: At first I was like, eh, but you can play it windowed.

1098
00:59:58,658 --> 01:00:01,199
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do other things while you're playing.

1099
01:00:01,439 --> 01:00:08,022
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was playing Final Fantasy XI, I had my laptop set up beside me so that I could freaking browse the internet while I was playing a game.

1100
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:11,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have my laptop for World of Warcraft because I have Thoughtbot up on it.

1101
01:00:12,824 --> 01:00:16,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe after years and years of Final Fantasy XI, I can't play a game in a window like that.

1102
01:00:16,806 --> 01:00:19,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Ragnarok online for a very long time.

1103
01:00:19,427 --> 01:00:19,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1104
01:00:19,767 --> 01:00:22,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And also with Ragnarok, you can't click outside of it.

1105
01:00:22,569 --> 01:00:23,389
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to alt-tab.

1106
01:00:28,055 --> 01:00:32,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember kids, Alt Tab lets you switch between your programs on a PC.

1107
01:00:32,918 --> 01:00:34,999
[SPEAKER_05]: So which MMO do you think is going to ban people next?

1108
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:36,760
[SPEAKER_02]: City of Villains.

1109
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:37,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Toontown.

1110
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:39,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Matrix.

1111
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:40,070
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1112
01:01:00,404 --> 01:01:01,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1113
01:01:23,991 --> 01:01:25,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, hi Sky, how are you?

1114
01:01:25,392 --> 01:01:26,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm really good.

1115
01:01:26,512 --> 01:01:28,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much for being on our program tonight.

1116
01:01:28,053 --> 01:01:28,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

1117
01:01:28,974 --> 01:01:29,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my pleasure.

1118
01:01:29,814 --> 01:01:30,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having me.

1119
01:01:30,795 --> 01:01:31,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1120
01:01:31,115 --> 01:01:34,877
[SPEAKER_05]: So now for those folks that haven't played the game Prey, what do you think they're missing out on?

1121
01:01:35,377 --> 01:01:42,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're definitely missing out on a lot of aliens, Indians, and everything in between.

1122
01:01:43,402 --> 01:01:49,365
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great storyline intertwined with shooting and endless hours of fun, basically.

1123
01:01:49,764 --> 01:01:54,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Now tell us a little bit about the three separate Prey soundtracks available on directsong.com.

1124
01:01:55,266 --> 01:02:03,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, directsong.com, first of all, is a website that's been around for almost a year now that features video game music exclusively.

1125
01:02:04,669 --> 01:02:11,871
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when Prey came out, we really wanted to showcase the two volumes of the soundtrack for Prey.

1126
01:02:11,911 --> 01:02:14,152
[SPEAKER_09]: It's over three hours of music for the video game.

1127
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:21,940
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's all done by Jeremy and Julian Soule who are British Academy Award winning video game composers.

1128
01:02:22,901 --> 01:02:29,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And they added the orchestral skills to the game's soundtrack which intertwined very nicely with the video game.

1129
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:42,607
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are both available for download on directsong.com and all you have to do is log in and enter your information and stuff like that and then you get the soundtrack and actually

1130
01:02:43,334 --> 01:02:45,055
[SPEAKER_09]: industry-leading audio quality.

1131
01:02:45,315 --> 01:02:50,737
[SPEAKER_09]: It's twice as good as iTunes and better than most of any of those other sites out there.

1132
01:02:50,817 --> 01:02:54,819
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going at a rate of 320 kilobits.

1133
01:02:55,479 --> 01:02:57,400
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's almost CD quality.

1134
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:02,241
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll pretty much be undiscernible to any normal set of ears.

1135
01:03:03,182 --> 01:03:03,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1136
01:03:03,482 --> 01:03:07,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I know there's a third soundtrack available on the site as well, this Bite Me compilation.

1137
01:03:07,924 --> 01:03:11,145
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a compilation of music inspired by Prey, right?

1138
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:11,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1139
01:03:11,946 --> 01:03:14,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is a really fun project that we just put out.

1140
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:26,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically what that is, is some of the music is from the video game, including the song that's in the end credits to the game by After Midnight Project called Take Me Home.

1141
01:03:26,698 --> 01:03:32,803
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we also have original music from MXPX, Real Big Fish, and lots of other artists.

1142
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,184
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's 13 artists involved total.

1143
01:03:35,525 --> 01:03:38,367
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a new thing for video games, to have bands come together

1144
01:03:39,062 --> 01:03:42,043
[SPEAKER_09]: and write music specifically for a video game.

1145
01:03:43,043 --> 01:03:50,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is kind of an industry first as well, where we really wanted to get bands of different genres, so it appeals to all different kinds of people.

1146
01:03:50,986 --> 01:04:02,090
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got punk rock, we've got mainstream rock, we've got electronica, yet all the songs directly relate to Prey, whether it be through the musical instruments involved or the samples used.

1147
01:04:02,777 --> 01:04:06,320
[SPEAKER_09]: or the lyrics and the themes invoked in the lyrics and stuff like that.

1148
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,181
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of leads into my next question.

1149
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:17,007
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it, do you think, about the game Prey that inspires all these artists to create these diverse kinds of music that all come back to being inspired by Prey?

1150
01:04:18,768 --> 01:04:27,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the things that inspired everyone throughout this process is the incredible graphics and the storyline that's portrayed through that.

1151
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:40,109
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of these people got to see some video clips and some of the trailers that came out before, as well as we sent everyone an email that had the full storyline of Prey.

1152
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:45,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So everyone saw quickly that this wasn't just a first-person shooter with no story behind it.

1153
01:04:45,153 --> 01:04:48,276
[SPEAKER_09]: So the storyline was a big part in most of the songs.

1154
01:04:48,876 --> 01:04:49,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1155
01:04:49,157 --> 01:04:52,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you yourself contributed two tracks to this compilation.

1156
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:54,716
[SPEAKER_05]: The tracks Existence and Intervention.

1157
01:04:54,796 --> 01:04:59,459
[SPEAKER_05]: How did your experience with Prey inspire these tracks that you yourself contributed?

1158
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:10,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Since I've been involved with Prey for about six months or so producing this album, it's been a part of my everyday work.

1159
01:05:10,464 --> 01:05:17,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been thinking about it and looking at videos and really been intertwined with it for a long time.

1160
01:05:18,008 --> 01:05:20,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Being inspired by it wasn't that much of a problem.

1161
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:21,410
[SPEAKER_09]: I really wanted to

1162
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:24,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Combine the themes of the game in the music.

1163
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:28,793
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the game, you've got Tommy, the Native American, gets abducted by aliens.

1164
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:44,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I really wanted to portray to the music kind of the same feeling, starting off with Native American themes and then have it be pretty much abducted by aliens and come across with more techno or industrial type sounds and stuff like that and work that all together.

1165
01:05:44,966 --> 01:05:53,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I remember actually playing through the Prey demo and then later on the game, and I kind of remember the music was a really big part of setting the atmosphere in the game.

1166
01:05:53,313 --> 01:05:58,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely, you know, music lends itself very well to Prey and is an important part of setting the mood in the game.

1167
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:00,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1168
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:02,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'd like to give our listeners... Oh, I'm sorry?

1169
01:06:03,642 --> 01:06:03,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing.

1170
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:10,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just going to say that Jeremy and Julian Stoll did a great job, in my opinion, of intertwining the music with the game.

1171
01:06:10,188 --> 01:06:12,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes you don't even notice there's music going because you're just so...

1172
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,922
[SPEAKER_09]: From the high desert in the great American Southwest, I'm Art Bell.

1173
01:06:16,942 --> 01:06:18,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to start the night by opening up the lines.

1174
01:06:18,823 --> 01:06:21,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can already tell you folks, it's going to get very interesting.

1175
01:06:42,813 --> 01:06:47,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting some reports of strange lights in the sky from the Oklahoma area.

1176
01:06:47,194 --> 01:06:57,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Our affiliate in Oklahoma City is telling us that the state police, get this, are reporting mysterious lights all over the area and that they're having a hard time responding to all of the calls.

1177
01:06:57,477 --> 01:07:00,358
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a wild and woolly night, folks.

1178
01:07:00,438 --> 01:07:01,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I just know it.

1179
01:07:01,298 --> 01:07:02,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the phones.

1180
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:04,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Caller, you're on the air with Art Bell.

1181
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:04,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Art?

1182
01:07:04,919 --> 01:07:05,459
This Art?

1183
01:07:08,055 --> 01:07:10,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's our caller.

1184
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:14,024
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lights coming in the sky right now?

1185
01:07:14,044 --> 01:07:14,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Where?

1186
01:07:24,051 --> 01:07:24,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Everywhere.

1187
01:07:25,212 --> 01:07:26,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Right over my house.

1188
01:07:26,312 --> 01:07:29,193
[SPEAKER_06]: They're moving from north to south.

1189
01:07:29,233 --> 01:07:30,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me what they look like?

1190
01:07:30,434 --> 01:07:31,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly what they look like.

1191
01:07:31,834 --> 01:07:32,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me about them?

1192
01:07:32,955 --> 01:07:39,397
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some are blue, some are green, some are blue, and some red.

1193
01:07:39,497 --> 01:07:40,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God!

1194
01:07:40,237 --> 01:07:42,458
One of them is so kind of a real spaceship.

1195
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:43,739
It's hovering right over me.

1196
01:07:43,899 --> 01:07:44,319
It's huge, man.

1197
01:07:56,545 --> 01:07:57,305
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take the next call.

1198
01:08:38,143 --> 01:08:40,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Strange things are happening in my boat.

1199
01:08:40,048 --> 01:08:42,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think someone disappeared?

1200
01:08:42,194 --> 01:08:43,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Paul, I still got my special line.

1201
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:00,188
Thanks for watching!

1202
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:35,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, now that was Intervention by Nick Murray here on Orange Lounge Radio Nick is joining us tonight to talk about the soundtrack So Nick, Art Bell is in that song

1203
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:39,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember hearing that same sample when I played through Prey.

1204
01:11:39,672 --> 01:11:41,694
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy is a legend in UFO culture.

1205
01:11:41,974 --> 01:11:43,135
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you get him on board?

1206
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:49,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, he was actually signed on by Human Head to do some voiceovers for the game.

1207
01:11:50,042 --> 01:11:56,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And Human Head Studios was nice enough to give all of the artists involved in the soundtrack a sound tree.

1208
01:11:57,168 --> 01:12:01,452
[SPEAKER_09]: And sound clips from the game ranging from aliens vomiting to

1209
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:05,751
[SPEAKER_09]: and Gunshot Sounds to these voiceover samples and stuff like that.

1210
01:12:05,811 --> 01:12:08,872
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was really fun to try to remix that into the music.

1211
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:15,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Now for folks that really enjoyed that song, obviously they could pick up the Bite Me music inspired by Prey soundtrack, but what about your own other music?

1212
01:12:16,013 --> 01:12:18,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have another site where you have your own music?

1213
01:12:19,774 --> 01:12:20,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, definitely.

1214
01:12:20,495 --> 01:12:29,917
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just go to nickmurraymusic.com and that has my updated blog and streaming mp3s for all my songs.

1215
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:30,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1216
01:12:30,973 --> 01:12:37,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, talking about one of the other bands on the CD really quick, the After Midnight Project, of course, has the credit song from the game Take Me Home.

1217
01:12:37,856 --> 01:12:45,420
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually a whole music video that you can see on the website about this, and I guess you guys, it was on G4 and some of the other TV stations.

1218
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:46,821
[SPEAKER_05]: How did that happen?

1219
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:49,802
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you guys think, oh, let's do a music video out of this?

1220
01:12:52,263 --> 01:12:56,805
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, working with After Midnight Project has been really great throughout the whole process.

1221
01:12:56,825 --> 01:12:58,626
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been really well integrated

1222
01:12:59,802 --> 01:13:01,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Really nice to us, really involved and stuff like that.

1223
01:13:01,523 --> 01:13:03,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Really good with promotion.

1224
01:13:03,783 --> 01:13:09,545
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the guys that works with us and actually works with the video game company, who's one of our main connections, named Jaron Moore.

1225
01:13:10,105 --> 01:13:13,225
[SPEAKER_09]: He has a film background and really wants to get into film directing.

1226
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:17,427
[SPEAKER_09]: And he managed that whole project, the whole music video.

1227
01:13:17,447 --> 01:13:23,568
[SPEAKER_09]: And he went out to LA and filmed the band and actually did all the editing and splicing and the game footage and all of that.

1228
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:26,089
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was a really, really good effort by Jaron.

1229
01:13:26,289 --> 01:13:27,189
[SPEAKER_09]: And it turned out really well.

1230
01:13:28,459 --> 01:13:28,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1231
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, congratulations on that.

1232
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:33,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this has been getting airplay I read about on the site, so that's great.

1233
01:13:34,124 --> 01:13:40,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, talking about the website as a whole, directsong.com, I noticed that Prey isn't really the only thing available there.

1234
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:44,333
[SPEAKER_05]: There's several game soundtracks like Oblivion, Dungeon Siege 2.

1235
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:48,736
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think are the advantages of digital distribution for music?

1236
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:56,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, one thing is that games are digital, so we're staying within the same realms as

1237
01:13:58,144 --> 01:13:59,304
[SPEAKER_09]: What gamers are used to.

1238
01:14:00,345 --> 01:14:07,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Second of all, what we hope to do is give the users more game music expansion.

1239
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:16,256
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now you can download expansion packs for Guild Wars on our website, one of the first games that we put up on our website.

1240
01:14:16,657 --> 01:14:20,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And that music is brand new music that will then work in game.

1241
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:23,802
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a really fun piece of technology that we're offering.

1242
01:14:24,778 --> 01:14:26,539
[SPEAKER_09]: besides just downloading the soundtracks.

1243
01:14:26,759 --> 01:14:27,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that.

1244
01:14:27,299 --> 01:14:30,380
[SPEAKER_09]: It all needs to be digital so it can work into the online games.

1245
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:38,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that's a really exciting addition I noticed to the site is that you can actually download these new soundtracks for games.

1246
01:14:38,442 --> 01:14:47,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially when you think about an MMO type of game like Guild Wars where you're hearing the same music over and over, this seems like somebody should have done this a long time ago.

1247
01:14:48,105 --> 01:14:48,746
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

1248
01:14:49,646 --> 01:14:50,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1249
01:14:50,326 --> 01:14:53,407
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of those ideas that you say, man, I wish I thought of that.

1250
01:14:54,294 --> 01:14:56,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you guys did, so congratulations.

1251
01:14:56,683 --> 01:14:58,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun raking in the money there.

1252
01:14:58,810 --> 01:14:59,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we hope so.

1253
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:07,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, now, just kind of out of curiosity, going to the other side of it, because, you know, we're talking about game soundtracks as a whole.

1254
01:15:07,714 --> 01:15:18,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people in the past have complained that, you know, why is it that you have all these B-movie soundtracks sitting on store shelves, yet there's no game soundtracks out there?

1255
01:15:18,397 --> 01:15:24,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that, in the end, there's a market for game soundtracks in a CD-based traditional format?

1256
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:27,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is digital distribution where it's at, and where things are going?

1257
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:30,486
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm not quite sure about that.

1258
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:39,673
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had some distributors come and talk to us about putting these on actual CDs and putting an online store on our site, and that stuff may all be in the future as well.

1259
01:15:40,734 --> 01:15:47,438
[SPEAKER_09]: But right now, like I said, this site's only been up for about a year, so that's just basically what we've been rolling out first.

1260
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:53,163
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of long-term industry, hard for me to say on that one, but...

1261
01:15:54,811 --> 01:16:05,459
[SPEAKER_09]: The gaming music is progressing so much as a whole that it will start getting as much clout or as much respect as movie scores as well.

1262
01:16:25,536 --> 01:16:35,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Myself, I actually just bought an Xbox 360 because I was waiting for my other standard Xbox to die out and it finally just crashed way too many times for me to even handle.

1263
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:43,350
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was stuck playing FIFA 06 on my other Xbox, which actually I've been addicted to that game for months now.

1264
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:49,274
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, personally I'm more of a sports game guy than a shooter kind of person, but

1265
01:16:51,363 --> 01:16:52,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, awesome.

1266
01:16:52,864 --> 01:16:54,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you ever do gaming on live?

1267
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,186
[SPEAKER_05]: You go online, do any of that stuff?

1268
01:16:56,907 --> 01:16:58,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really got into that yet.

1269
01:16:58,228 --> 01:16:59,429
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope to get into that soon.

1270
01:17:00,729 --> 01:17:03,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of waking up to that whole world of online gaming.

1271
01:17:04,032 --> 01:17:04,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1272
01:17:04,772 --> 01:17:08,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, if our folks want to check that out, it's music from Prey.

1273
01:17:08,815 --> 01:17:12,758
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two soundtracks as well as the Bite Me music inspired by Prey soundtrack.

1274
01:17:13,078 --> 01:17:15,120
[SPEAKER_05]: It's available on directsong.com.

1275
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Nick, thanks so much for joining us tonight on the show.

1276
01:17:17,441 --> 01:17:18,282
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

1277
01:17:19,062 --> 01:17:19,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1278
01:17:19,762 --> 01:17:20,302
[SPEAKER_09]: My pleasure.

1279
01:17:20,462 --> 01:17:21,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else you wanted to say?

1280
01:17:21,622 --> 01:17:23,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

1281
01:17:23,443 --> 01:17:24,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1282
01:17:25,443 --> 01:17:26,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1283
01:17:26,163 --> 01:17:26,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much.

1284
01:17:27,244 --> 01:17:27,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1285
01:17:28,424 --> 01:17:29,004
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty cool.

1286
01:17:29,824 --> 01:17:35,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I know definitely the music in Prey and Elder Scrolls and all that kind of stuff is actually pretty sweet.

1287
01:17:35,865 --> 01:17:45,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyways, speaking of music, I know Microsoft's been trying to very eagerly keep this whole Zune thing kind of under wraps because of their...

1288
01:17:46,266 --> 01:18:12,989
[SPEAKER_04]: surprises and how they're going to basically take over the whole you know music and portable markets well anyways Microsoft exec let's see one of the top ones actually he is basically dismissing the PlayStation 3 and the Wii launches as just pretty much who cares because we're going to be you know launching with our brand new Zune and all that stuff and our system is just awesome and

1289
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:43,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, it was just kind of interesting, this was actually being run on MCV Interactive Entertainment Weekly and they were talking about how because the PlayStation 3 price being so high and how that the Wii is basically not able to compete with them processor-wise and graphically that Microsoft doesn't really have anything to worry about as far as winning the next-gen console war, which I think is a bit I don't know

1290
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:47,072
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a very good way to look at it.

1291
01:18:47,252 --> 01:18:48,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe in this country.

1292
01:18:48,973 --> 01:18:50,274
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I don't know.

1293
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of said this a long time ago on the show.

1294
01:18:52,796 --> 01:18:56,319
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very interesting what this next-gen war is going to be on a worldwide scale.

1295
01:18:56,619 --> 01:18:58,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Xbox is still struggling in Japan.

1296
01:18:59,542 --> 01:19:03,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that they don't look at it with the success of Live.

1297
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:09,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't take great graphics and stuff to make an awesome game.

1298
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:12,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at Geometry Wars.

1299
01:19:12,172 --> 01:19:13,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the upcoming...

1300
01:19:14,537 --> 01:19:16,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Castle Crashers or whatever that was.

1301
01:19:17,098 --> 01:19:19,679
[SPEAKER_04]: It's simple graphics and just fun gameplay.

1302
01:19:19,699 --> 01:19:24,182
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't need to be all... Yeah, seriously, one of the most anticipated titles, Street Fighter 2.

1303
01:19:24,762 --> 01:19:26,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Fighter 2, yeah, perfect example.

1304
01:19:26,503 --> 01:19:28,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just all about gameplay.

1305
01:19:28,604 --> 01:19:35,347
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, they were comparing the GameCube or the Wii, it's all... Although the Wii is almost a GameCube with a DVD drive.

1306
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:41,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo... Is Nintendo going to have enough quantity to satisfy the demand?

1307
01:19:41,650 --> 01:19:42,790
[SPEAKER_04]: They're talking about shortages.

1308
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:43,831
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the

1309
01:19:44,892 --> 01:19:47,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Pot calling the kettle black, but whatever.

1310
01:19:48,593 --> 01:19:50,554
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically they said, you know, wait.

1311
01:19:51,074 --> 01:20:03,900
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a lot of Quarter 4 surprises coming, of course, with the Zune and whatever they're going to be, you know, possibly linking the Zune with 360 and PC Vista, etc.

1312
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So it should be interesting.

1313
01:20:06,661 --> 01:20:07,581
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to wait and see, though.

1314
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:14,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there actually is a little bit more about a Nintendo game.

1315
01:20:14,344 --> 01:20:14,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1316
01:20:15,766 --> 01:20:23,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people by now know that we've had our little bit of excitement over Osutatakayo and on getting a US release as Elite Beat Agents.

1317
01:20:24,977 --> 01:20:29,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a list released, a partial list, I should say, of songs that might be in the game.

1318
01:20:30,584 --> 01:20:31,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

1319
01:20:31,606 --> 01:20:31,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1320
01:20:32,298 --> 01:20:34,420
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Stereogram Walkie Talkie Man.

1321
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,401
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, by the way, coming from Bin Mani Style.

1322
01:20:37,182 --> 01:20:37,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1323
01:20:37,983 --> 01:20:42,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep Purple Highway Star, Eve Six Inside Out, Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida Loca.

1324
01:20:42,606 --> 01:20:43,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

1325
01:20:43,887 --> 01:20:45,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Savage Garden, Truly Madly Deeply.

1326
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:46,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1327
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:48,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird Al Yankovic, Hardware Store.

1328
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:49,412
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

1329
01:20:49,812 --> 01:20:50,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Weird Al.

1330
01:20:50,293 --> 01:20:51,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Weird Al Yankovic, that's hardcore.

1331
01:20:51,954 --> 01:20:52,394
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

1332
01:20:52,755 --> 01:20:53,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Linkin Park, In The End.

1333
01:20:54,096 --> 01:20:55,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, just lost interest.

1334
01:20:56,057 --> 01:20:56,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1335
01:20:56,898 --> 01:20:59,060
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the song that should be playing while you're playing, like...

1336
01:21:00,351 --> 01:21:01,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's for the MySpace kids.

1337
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:01,991
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

1338
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:02,672
[SPEAKER_05]: What else?

1339
01:21:03,852 --> 01:21:05,612
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was actually going to say why you're playing R-Type.

1340
01:21:07,412 --> 01:21:08,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1341
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:10,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Offspring, hit that.

1342
01:21:11,653 --> 01:21:14,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Queens of the Stone Age, Go With the Flow, Kylie Minogue, Locomotion.

1343
01:21:14,614 --> 01:21:16,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't they pick any of her new stuff?

1344
01:21:16,994 --> 01:21:17,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1345
01:21:18,575 --> 01:21:19,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Guns N' Roses, Sweet Child of Mine.

1346
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:20,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I can dig that.

1347
01:21:21,495 --> 01:21:22,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Bare Naked Ladies, One Week.

1348
01:21:25,636 --> 01:21:26,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1349
01:21:26,316 --> 01:21:28,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Spirit Snare in our chatroom says, LOL, Emotendo.

1350
01:21:29,577 --> 01:21:30,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Emotendo.

1351
01:21:31,215 --> 01:21:33,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's also some new features that are going to be in it.

1352
01:21:33,577 --> 01:21:35,879
[SPEAKER_02]: There's single-card multiplayer now.

1353
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:36,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

1354
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:38,881
[SPEAKER_02]: But there will still be multi-card multiplayer.

1355
01:21:39,922 --> 01:21:47,488
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also send the equivalent of the E3 demo, which is Walkie Talkie Man, Highway Star, and Tutorial Mode from the Japanese game by download play.

1356
01:21:48,868 --> 01:21:49,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's kind of cool.

1357
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:51,289
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two new scenarios.

1358
01:21:51,409 --> 01:21:58,432
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a young man trying to win the heart of his dream girl, and a construction worker who's behind on a project and has one hour to finish it.

1359
01:21:58,472 --> 01:22:00,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, Hardware Store sounds like the song for that one.

1360
01:22:00,793 --> 01:22:01,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sounds like, yeah.

1361
01:22:02,574 --> 01:22:03,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1362
01:22:03,554 --> 01:22:04,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see more.

1363
01:22:05,035 --> 01:22:06,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was most... I'm sorry.

1364
01:22:07,216 --> 01:22:08,977
[SPEAKER_02]: This gives me more incentive to import.

1365
01:22:09,317 --> 01:22:14,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, what's most interesting about that song list is it kind of really makes the Japanese ones stand out.

1366
01:22:14,259 --> 01:22:16,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, these are really two different games.

1367
01:22:17,051 --> 01:22:17,652
[SPEAKER_05]: TechnicBeat TechnicBeat

1368
01:22:37,598 --> 01:22:41,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Luminous 2 Heavenly Star Tetsuya Mizuguchi and his team actually created the song and it

1369
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:15,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposedly insanely catchy, and also I'm going to have a really awesome video to go with the background, which features an alien singer.

1370
01:23:17,776 --> 01:23:19,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was Hollaback Girl.

1371
01:23:20,257 --> 01:23:20,958
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry.

1372
01:23:21,018 --> 01:23:22,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredibly catchy song with alien singer?

1373
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:26,562
[SPEAKER_04]: A simply stunning video.

1374
01:23:26,582 --> 01:23:30,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Hollaback Girl would follow on that.

1375
01:23:30,085 --> 01:23:34,028
[SPEAKER_04]: But he says he was inspired by Take On Me with...

1376
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, now that's cool.

1377
01:23:36,724 --> 01:23:37,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, kind of neat.

1378
01:23:57,768 --> 01:24:06,133
[SPEAKER_05]: If there at any point is a reference to Luminous 2 going, this game is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S, I will have a video on YouTube of me smashing my PSP.

1379
01:24:06,393 --> 01:24:06,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Bah.

1380
01:24:07,494 --> 01:24:07,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

1381
01:24:08,714 --> 01:24:09,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

1382
01:24:12,096 --> 01:24:15,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Something else that sometimes makes me want to smash something is Myspace.

1383
01:24:15,698 --> 01:24:17,739
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, join the Orange Lounge Radio Myspace.

1384
01:24:17,779 --> 01:24:20,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1385
01:24:20,954 --> 01:24:31,710
[SPEAKER_05]: and Kotaku ran a very interesting observation earlier this week on their site capturing a very interesting MySpace ad and you guys can maybe see that ad here in studio a little bit.

1386
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:32,832
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got

1387
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:40,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, I don't know if that's a guy or a girl or something, whispering to a hot chick, quote unquote, and then there's another hot chick sitting there.

1388
01:24:40,995 --> 01:24:45,279
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, you know, everybody's dream of two chicks, I suppose.

1389
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:46,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Not my dream, but whatever.

1390
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:47,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those are two chicks about to make out.

1391
01:24:48,002 --> 01:24:48,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

1392
01:24:48,362 --> 01:24:48,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, whatever.

1393
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:53,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the text on there says, horny gamer girls looking for fun.

1394
01:24:54,828 --> 01:24:58,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm wondering, is this like targeted advertising by Myspace?

1395
01:24:58,797 --> 01:25:02,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know whenever, you know, it's no real secret on this program, I'm gay.

1396
01:25:02,678 --> 01:25:06,739
[SPEAKER_05]: And whenever I log on to MySpace, that's all I ever get are gay personal sites.

1397
01:25:07,159 --> 01:25:11,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how many freaking times I could see these ad banners is incredible.

1398
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:14,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, I will probably never see this one.

1399
01:25:14,641 --> 01:25:17,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll get a Horny Gamer Guys, but I somehow doubt that.

1400
01:25:17,081 --> 01:25:21,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't seem to be the... Is this an incentive for me to unblock ads?

1401
01:25:22,462 --> 01:25:22,802
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1402
01:25:22,822 --> 01:25:25,063
[SPEAKER_05]: MySpace has some pretty funny ads, actually.

1403
01:25:25,103 --> 01:25:25,443
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some...

1404
01:25:26,095 --> 01:25:26,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1405
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:54,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know why we brought this up, but I suppose gamers are being targeted in advertising on Myspace, so keep an eye out for the ad.

1406
01:25:54,984 --> 01:25:58,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't click on it, because then that shows you support this, and there'll be more.

1407
01:25:58,666 --> 01:26:00,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you want there to be more, I don't know.

1408
01:26:00,627 --> 01:26:04,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I support hot, you know, gamer girls making out with each other.

1409
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:06,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I support that fully.

1410
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:07,451
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my endorsement.

1411
01:26:07,691 --> 01:26:08,132
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways.

1412
01:26:09,232 --> 01:26:09,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Pig.

1413
01:26:09,752 --> 01:26:12,654
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I support fully is violence!

1414
01:26:13,315 --> 01:26:14,775
[SPEAKER_04]: And much violence.

1415
01:26:15,096 --> 01:26:17,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this, this, I can... This I can

1416
01:26:18,078 --> 01:26:19,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of OLR can agree on this one.

1417
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:22,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Violence in games is wonderful.

1418
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Violence is fantastic.

1419
01:26:23,701 --> 01:26:35,227
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, in Iowa State researchers have found violent gaming sessions can reduce the psychological response or physiological response of real-life violence in the short term.

1420
01:26:36,328 --> 01:26:38,269
[SPEAKER_04]: But I question this still.

1421
01:26:38,409 --> 01:26:43,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, going this further, they basically had a...

1422
01:26:46,066 --> 01:26:55,869
[SPEAKER_04]: 257 college students and they were made to play certain games and they were following with real life violence 20 minutes later.

1423
01:26:56,269 --> 01:26:58,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were showing them and seeing what their reactions were.

1424
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:03,591
[SPEAKER_04]: The games they made them play though, well these are just a bit old.

1425
01:27:04,151 --> 01:27:06,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's a very good representation of games nowadays.

1426
01:27:07,232 --> 01:27:09,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Carmageddon, Duke Nukem 3D,

1427
01:27:11,608 --> 01:27:15,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Mortal Kombat, Future Cop, which were on the violent side.

1428
01:27:15,409 --> 01:27:17,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've never heard of these games.

1429
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:22,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Glider Pro, 3D Pinball, 3D Munchman, and Tetra Mattis on the non-violent side.

1430
01:27:24,451 --> 01:27:28,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm reminded somehow of that scene from A Clockwork Orange.

1431
01:27:28,072 --> 01:27:30,733
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember that scene where they're forcing them to watch all the movies?

1432
01:27:31,993 --> 01:27:34,994
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, this whole story reminds me of that.

1433
01:27:35,014 --> 01:27:38,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're shoving all these violent games down someone's throat.

1434
01:27:41,093 --> 01:27:45,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Duh, they're going to be numb to the imagery after a while.

1435
01:27:46,495 --> 01:27:48,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's not a matter of violent games.

1436
01:27:49,376 --> 01:27:53,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a matter of boring games and non-boring games.

1437
01:27:54,057 --> 01:27:55,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Say, for example, Carmageddon.

1438
01:27:55,978 --> 01:28:06,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that's much more exciting than 3D Munchman or Glider Pro, a game which sounds like it's probably on a hang glider and you're just flying around doing nothing.

1439
01:28:06,451 --> 01:28:08,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, those games are boring.

1440
01:28:08,513 --> 01:28:16,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas, if I'm bored to death and all of a sudden someone shows me a shot of someone being shot point blank, I'm going, whoa!

1441
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas, if I'm kind of awake, I might go, wow, that's kind of neat.

1442
01:28:20,264 --> 01:28:30,053
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not going to be just like, oh my god, that's really offensive because I've been playing Munchman instead of, oh my god, I destroyed giant mutant pigs.

1443
01:28:30,513 --> 01:28:32,135
[SPEAKER_04]: That does not offend me in any way.

1444
01:28:33,188 --> 01:28:33,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1445
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:34,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's kind of retarded.

1446
01:28:34,629 --> 01:28:37,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't Munchman the name of the little guy on Square One TV?

1447
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:39,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Mathman, never mind.

1448
01:28:39,932 --> 01:28:43,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Munchman, I believe, is a knockoff of probably Pac-Man.

1449
01:28:43,634 --> 01:28:44,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1450
01:28:45,134 --> 01:28:45,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my thought.

1451
01:28:47,095 --> 01:28:58,141
[SPEAKER_05]: What if they did this exact same study, but instead replaced it with the nightly news, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, any zombie B-movie flick from the 70s?

1452
01:28:58,582 --> 01:29:00,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, wouldn't it all have the same effect?

1453
01:29:01,043 --> 01:29:01,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1454
01:29:02,558 --> 01:29:07,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So this study seems to be kind of, I don't know, like targeted to kind of blame games.

1455
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:08,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's skewed.

1456
01:29:09,941 --> 01:29:11,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it seems like there needed to be a control here.

1457
01:29:13,222 --> 01:29:13,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

1458
01:29:13,642 --> 01:29:17,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Are games more desensitizing than the nightly news or than movies?

1459
01:29:18,043 --> 01:29:19,384
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the study I want to see.

1460
01:29:19,544 --> 01:29:21,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Show me a comparison.

1461
01:29:21,925 --> 01:29:24,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't just throw these numbers at me.

1462
01:29:24,566 --> 01:29:25,066
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1463
01:29:25,346 --> 01:29:26,186
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my problem with it.

1464
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:28,247
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, do you have a thought on this at all?

1465
01:29:30,692 --> 01:29:38,056
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the desensitization goes, there's already a lot of exposure, honestly.

1466
01:29:39,356 --> 01:29:49,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you take the child who grows up never able to watch the news, never able to watch TV, never able to play a video game, and how are they when they grow up and see what the real world is like?

1467
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,242
[SPEAKER_02]: They go pretty nuts.

1468
01:29:52,122 --> 01:29:56,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take one who may not have been allowed to play video games, but they watch the news with their parents.

1469
01:29:58,025 --> 01:29:59,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they'll be just as equally...

1470
01:30:00,615 --> 01:30:02,599
[SPEAKER_02]: and Desensitized Remedies, someone who's an avid gamer.

1471
01:30:13,923 --> 01:30:17,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been desensitized to violence, but not from games.

1472
01:30:35,779 --> 01:30:38,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I can control the action on a DVD player too.

1473
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:39,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I can rewind.

1474
01:30:39,461 --> 01:30:40,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I can freeze frame.

1475
01:30:40,821 --> 01:30:41,381
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

1476
01:30:41,942 --> 01:30:44,722
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing is, just like with Saw, for example.

1477
01:30:44,763 --> 01:30:45,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take Saw.

1478
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:46,383
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a perfect example.

1479
01:30:47,063 --> 01:30:54,326
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a basic movie where someone is kidnapped and they have a giant device on their face with spikes in it that's going to basically...

1480
01:30:55,788 --> 01:30:57,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Slam into them and kill them.

1481
01:30:57,448 --> 01:31:00,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and they also show, you know, someone sawing off their foot.

1482
01:31:00,829 --> 01:31:07,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a lot more violent than, say, Duke Nukem 3D, which has pixelated graphics that look like a cartoon.

1483
01:31:07,411 --> 01:31:12,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, did anyone throw a fit when, you know, the Roadrunner, you know, got Wile E. Coyote to fall off a cliff?

1484
01:31:13,052 --> 01:31:16,713
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hundreds of feet that he fell to his death.

1485
01:31:17,113 --> 01:31:18,654
[SPEAKER_04]: But, oh, sure, he came back later on.

1486
01:31:18,954 --> 01:31:19,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

1487
01:31:19,374 --> 01:31:21,034
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happens when you shoot the pig.

1488
01:31:21,334 --> 01:31:22,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It spawns later on.

1489
01:31:22,674 --> 01:31:24,655
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't see what the big deal is.

1490
01:31:26,451 --> 01:31:50,512
[SPEAKER_05]: for me um i i've been gaming a long time i've played a lot of violent games and a lot of you know funny violent games like i love mortal combat but like real blood like my brain totally knows the difference between game movie and real life because like i could watch somebody cut their cut their hand and they need stitches and i freak out like i'm like oh my god it's real blood uh gross gross you know i get all freaked out you know i'm totally one of those i get

1491
01:31:51,102 --> 01:31:55,605
[SPEAKER_05]: You drive by a horrific car accident and I'm going to cry if I see a body.

1492
01:31:55,805 --> 01:32:02,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Even watching the news, you see a lot of horrible stuff on the news and I just feel depressed.

1493
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:04,571
[SPEAKER_05]: My brain knows the difference between the two.

1494
01:32:06,247 --> 01:32:11,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I can feel that reaction to real blood, but then I can play a game and I think it's funny because it's not real.

1495
01:32:12,171 --> 01:32:14,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, yeah, you're smart enough to know it's not real.

1496
01:32:14,173 --> 01:32:18,676
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is wrong with people if they don't know what's real and don't know what's not real?

1497
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:24,400
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the bigger problem, not being desensitized to violence, being desensitized to what's reality and what's not reality.

1498
01:32:24,841 --> 01:32:26,362
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the big problem right there.

1499
01:32:26,682 --> 01:32:33,727
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if people are that retarded, well, they need to be put in some sort of mental hospital because obviously they're not fit for society.

1500
01:32:35,589 --> 01:32:35,849
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

1501
01:32:37,335 --> 01:32:44,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, again, this goes back to parental responsibility.

1502
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It is their job.

1503
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:53,025
[SPEAKER_02]: When they brought that life into the world, they had an unwritten contract.

1504
01:32:54,197 --> 01:32:58,739
[SPEAKER_02]: They would make sure that this entity would grow up to be a functional member of society.

1505
01:32:59,239 --> 01:33:04,080
[SPEAKER_02]: That if they could not become a functional member of society, they would help them seek the treatment they need.

1506
01:33:04,401 --> 01:33:06,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of going, oh, therapist, blah.

1507
01:33:06,821 --> 01:33:09,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And not noticing if there's anything else that might be causing the problem.

1508
01:33:10,062 --> 01:33:19,226
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think that a good parent will pay attention to what their child... You know, I admit, a child is going to be sneaky.

1509
01:33:19,666 --> 01:33:20,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a sneaky kid.

1510
01:33:21,327 --> 01:33:35,560
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be able to be there 24-7, but if a parent takes an active interest in what their children are doing, participates in their life instead of dictates their life, you know what I mean?

1511
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:47,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they'll be as much of a... They don't have a right to blame a game when it's their responsibility for making sure that their child turns out how they feel is right.

1512
01:33:47,959 --> 01:33:57,664
[SPEAKER_02]: and if they think that the game is going to desensitize them to violence later and want them to retain a feeling of sensitivity, they need to limit how much their child's going to play it.

1513
01:33:58,785 --> 01:34:00,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the problem with human nature these days.

1514
01:34:00,966 --> 01:34:08,751
[SPEAKER_03]: People are far more apt to blame other things, other objects, blame the TV, blame a video game for what's really the problem.

1515
01:34:08,911 --> 01:34:09,291
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1516
01:34:09,391 --> 01:34:11,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Your kid is just a maladjusted dick.

1517
01:34:12,753 --> 01:34:14,554
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lack of accountability.

1518
01:34:14,814 --> 01:34:16,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think it's a lack of self-accountability.

1519
01:34:16,475 --> 01:34:16,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,

1520
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:17,590
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1521
01:34:36,678 --> 01:35:00,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you, I'm sorry, cops, the TV, this stuff is out there all the time in any of your dramas, like 24, I mean, how many Law and Order, police, you know, dramas out there right now, this stuff is all over the place, like, and people aren't probably surprised about that, because it's like, yeah, I've seen that before, you know, it's kind of like, you know, um, I don't know, it's like, uh,

1522
01:35:03,358 --> 01:35:05,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Pamela Anderson naked.

1523
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen that before.

1524
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:07,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not surprising.

1525
01:35:08,862 --> 01:35:16,546
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like, wow, oh my god, I was not expecting her to have breasts under there, but it's just, you know, it's not surprising.

1526
01:35:16,566 --> 01:35:30,255
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to be... For example, if you're like, you know, playing these boring ass knockoffs of games by the sound of the generic names that they have, 3D Munchman, you know, if you're playing that, then all of a sudden they show you, you know,

1527
01:35:31,415 --> 01:35:35,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Prison Fight, I'm going to be like, hell yeah, this is a lot better than 3D Munch, man.

1528
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:38,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so I don't know what the hell they were expecting.

1529
01:35:39,122 --> 01:35:40,923
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I got to let our chat room have a say here.

1530
01:35:40,963 --> 01:35:42,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Over at OrangeLawnTrader.com, click on chat.

1531
01:35:43,806 --> 01:35:48,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie of the Oil Army says, my mom played Halo for a few weeks with me when I first got my Xbox.

1532
01:35:49,331 --> 01:35:50,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's cute.

1533
01:35:50,371 --> 01:35:50,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for your mom.

1534
01:35:51,052 --> 01:35:54,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, the family that plays together is closer.

1535
01:35:54,255 --> 01:35:54,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1536
01:35:55,055 --> 01:35:55,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1537
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:56,717
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds...

1538
01:35:57,262 --> 01:35:58,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost dirty, though, but that's not true.

1539
01:35:58,823 --> 01:36:06,725
[SPEAKER_05]: GK128 says, There is a difference between violence in a video game and violence from, say, a real video where a dude is blown to bits from a torrent.

1540
01:36:08,126 --> 01:36:09,466
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gross, but true.

1541
01:36:10,507 --> 01:36:12,547
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya says, Hello Kitty drove him to violence.

1542
01:36:14,148 --> 01:36:15,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello Kitty drives everyone to violence.

1543
01:36:16,709 --> 01:36:20,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Funnydale seems to think Munchman was a knockoff of an 80s porn film, actually.

1544
01:36:21,671 --> 01:36:22,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave it to him to make the funny.

1545
01:36:24,632 --> 01:36:25,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, uh,

1546
01:36:25,825 --> 01:36:27,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other thoughts on this topic?

1547
01:36:27,026 --> 01:36:28,607
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to get your thoughts in our mailbag.

1548
01:36:28,987 --> 01:36:35,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you want to send us some emails, Jamie's going to be digging into the mailbag in our next segment.

1549
01:36:36,191 --> 01:36:36,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure will.

1550
01:36:37,132 --> 01:36:40,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this time I'm going to need an extra thick hazmat suit this time.

1551
01:36:41,514 --> 01:36:42,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some asbestos gloves.

1552
01:36:43,595 --> 01:36:44,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one last thing.

1553
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:53,261
[SPEAKER_03]: If they want to test whether people are desensitized to violence, they don't need to show courtroom battles, cops, that kind of thing like Loki said.

1554
01:36:53,965 --> 01:36:57,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Show some pictures of some guy with his head blown off by a shotgun.

1555
01:36:57,587 --> 01:36:59,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff you would see on shock sites.

1556
01:37:00,449 --> 01:37:02,791
[SPEAKER_03]: That will test your sensitivity to violence.

1557
01:37:03,792 --> 01:37:05,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Courtroom Battle made me think of Phoenix Wright.

1558
01:37:06,093 --> 01:37:06,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Objection!

1559
01:37:06,694 --> 01:37:07,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1560
01:37:07,414 --> 01:37:08,495
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't need to see that.

1561
01:37:08,535 --> 01:37:10,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen pictures of people eating babies.

1562
01:37:10,496 --> 01:37:11,617
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty disturbing.

1563
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:14,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Courtroom.

1564
01:37:14,999 --> 01:37:16,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Or outbursts in a courtroom.

1565
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:19,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen that in a movie before.

1566
01:37:20,544 --> 01:37:23,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Cops, oh my god, never seen cops before.

1567
01:37:23,406 --> 01:37:27,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I object to where this show is headed, so I think it's time that we have a break.

1568
01:37:27,529 --> 01:37:30,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of violence real quick though, I need to get this out here.

1569
01:37:30,752 --> 01:37:36,576
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't listen to the rebroadcast of Orange Lounge Radio over on allgames.com, there will be violence.

1570
01:37:38,057 --> 01:37:40,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll poke you in the nose and call you a poopy head.

1571
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,441
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, we're moving times over there.

1572
01:37:43,461 --> 01:37:45,463
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been some schedule changes over all games.

1573
01:37:45,743 --> 01:37:46,884
[SPEAKER_05]: East Coasters are going to love this.

1574
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:49,746
[SPEAKER_05]: The show is now Mondays at 5 o'clock.

1575
01:37:50,603 --> 01:37:53,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Pacific Standard Time, which would be 8 o'clock for you East Coasters.

1576
01:37:53,444 --> 01:38:01,387
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we're making you stay up too late on a Sunday, you can always listen to the show in its entirety, parts A and B, over on allgames.com on Monday nights.

1577
01:38:01,407 --> 01:38:09,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's right after the big live show they do, All Games Interactive, which is taped live at the Arena Interactive Lounge, home of the E3 Outpost.

1578
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:13,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know what's going to happen with that next year.
