Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Mojo.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, July 30th, 2006, E3 might be cancelled. That's right, cancelled!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The latest news on the silver lining when we talk about the music of Prey in an interview with Nick Murray of Artistry Entertainment.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,340
Welcome, everybody, to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,540
We are a video game podcast dedicated to what gamers really want to know, and we're here

7
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,540
to help you through that.

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,540
My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,660
You might know me as Sky.

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,540
Joining me, as always, say hello to my lovely co-host in that corner over there, even though

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,860
it's radio and you can't see it, DarkSakura Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,860
That's me in the corner.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,660
Is that you in the spotlight?

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,660
Yeah.

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,540
Losing Up.

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,300
Also playing pinball, more likely than anything.

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,420
I played a lot of pinball.

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,940
Say hello as well to Loki.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,940
Hi.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,460
How you doing, Loki?

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,460
Good.

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,460
All right.

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,020
And also joining us once again tonight, crashing the program with his endless wit and charm,

24
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,980
say hello to 23rd Magus, Andrew.

25
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,140
Flattery will get you nowhere.

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,740
Do you have any sites that you're pimping out when you're here?

27
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,380
Do you have any sites you're affiliated with you want to pimp my show?

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,380
Do you have a podcast? Everybody has a podcast now.

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,380
I don't have a podcast yet.

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,380
I do listen to...

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,380
Ooh, yet! That was a nice teaser. Okay.

32
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,380
I do listen to Warcraft Radio, though, at wcradio.com.

33
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,380
Okay. Cool.

34
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,380
We like independent radio. Good deal.

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,380
Alright, let's talk about some gaming news tonight.

36
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,380
But first, we always talk about what we've been playing in our gaming week.

37
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,380
Let's start it off with Dark Soccer. What have you been playing during your gaming week?

38
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:01,940
loads of stuff I played getting lost in San Francisco this weekend but that's

39
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:08,200
that like crazy taxi or well I played um we actually went to Santa Cruz this

40
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,640
morning to play actually just to go hang out the boardwalk for a little while and

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,760
you know have me not die on that little thing that goes across who is we was

42
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:24,940

Marissa who's now my friend very cool person music nerd like moi so it was

44
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,800
like a girl thing it was a slumber party yeah I was a big summer did you go in

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,440

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,400
have some ice cream talk about boys we actually did eat a lot of ice cream we

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,920
We had Dib and Dots, but, um, but, um, we, uh, I played Star Wars, uh, Episode 1 Pinball,

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,640
which is, uh, Pinball 2000.

49
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,400
I love the Pinball 2000 games.

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,160
Revenge from Mars, Pinball 2000.

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,520
Those are the hologram ones, right?

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Uh, yeah.

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Those are cool.

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,840
Um, I played The Sopranos Pinball, which is actually pretty decent.

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,120
I played Star Wars, uh, uh, the first Star Wars game, Pinball, that's put out by Sega,

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,240
which is kind of a crappy table, and I played, oh shoot, it was another table that was really

57
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
good.

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,760
I just had a brain storm.

59
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,960
It hurt a little bit.

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,120
Why doesn't Sega put out a Sonic pinball table?

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,440
They can have a little blue pinball.

62
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,040
They had a Super Mario Brothers pinball table there that wasn't working.

63
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
But that's not Sonic.

64
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,540
No, but I played Lord of the Rings pinball, which is also put out by Stern.

65
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,080
One ball to rule them all?

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,560
It's a pretty difficult table, actually.

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,600
It was a really good machine, though.

68
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,400
Rob, you are stealing my material.

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,060
Shush.

70
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,720
But basically Stern is the only company still making pins

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,120
right now, pretty much.

72
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,520
I also, we got a new pinball table.

73
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,440
I woke up Friday morning to see Dan face down on the futon.

74
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,920
And in our garage is a Twilight Zone pinball,

75
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,880
which is like one of the best tables ever.

76
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,360
How many pinball machines do you have now?

77
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,800
Five.

78
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,880
You're going to open up an arcade soon.

79
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah, we're going to be selling our Johnny Mnemonic.

80
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,760
Well, that's a good one to sell.

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,160
Johnny Mnemonic is a good table.

82
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,200
I've actually played the table, it's a fair table.

83
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,480
But if any of our listeners want to own a Johnny Mnemonic pinball that has lived in

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,480
my house that I have touched...

85
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,060
Maybe you can autograph it for a listener.

86
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,960
You know what's funny, though, is that Dan and I decided that that Twilight Zone was

87
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,120
destined to be, because if you lift up the playfield to look at it, if you look at the

88
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,520
very end of it that's facing toward the coin slots, you'll have two dates on there.

89
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,800
The first date is the date that the board was cut, the second date is the date the playfield

90
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,360
was assembled and the date that the board on that Twilight Zone was cut was my birthday.

91
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Oh wow.

92
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
It was April 19th.

93
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Very cool.

94
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,120
So I also played some, I actually played DDR today.

95
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,120
I did not die and I played this other, it was a ticket game, but it plays like popin'

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,520
music with eggs and there's only four buttons.

97
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
It's called rhythm and something.

98
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,520
It was really stupid, the music sucked, but it was like, this is popin' music.

99
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,640
That sounds kinda cute.

100
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,000
It was cute and they had a Tron machine that I didn't play.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,780
All right, say hello to our chat room over at www.orangelaungeradio.com, click on chat.

102
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,340
Funnydale is actually letting us know that Sonic did have a pinball game somewhere between

103
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,880
93 and 95.

104
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
So that's news to me.

105
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
That is true.

106
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
I had forgotten about it.

107
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Oh, wow.

108
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
That's cool.

109
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,880
Did it have the little blue...?

110
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,080
I actually haven't played one.

111
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,200
I don't want to have bad jokes come out here.

112
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
He doesn't want to say it.

113
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
He doesn't want to say it.

114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
He doesn't want to say it.

115
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
But did it have a blue colored pinball in the thing?

116
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
No.

117
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Oh, okay.

118
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
But pinmame.

119
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Oh, I think you get pinmame.

120
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
I could play it in there.

121
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,440
Nintendo Maniac 64 says I have a pinball machine, that's cool.

122
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,060
DJ Dark Knight says give me the Simpsons pinball.

123
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,560
That was a good table too, because like the bumpers were the big nuclear reactors, that

124
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
was awesome.

125
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,200
They had a funhouse pinball, I hate that machine because that head thing on there, ugh, it's

126
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
just ugh.

127
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:54,360
They had a laughing cell at the boardwalk though, because when we were at California

128
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,360
There was a, you know Playland used to be an amusement park in New York that they had to destroy.

129
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,360
I guess they sold the property or something.

130
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:12,360
But there are people who made a Playland memorial or museum, and they have games from there and everything.

131
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,360
And they have two laughing styles, so when I saw the one at Santa Cruz, I was like,

132
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Oh, I remember them talking about that. That's really cool.

133
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,860
cool how is the Santa Cruz boardwalk as an arcade because arcades are kind of a

134
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,380
dying breed these days dear god it's like for arcade spread out over the

135
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,900
whole thing now that sounds pretty hot it was cool and they actually have a

136
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:38,500
beat me in the final oh cool and they have the dance maniac second the jpop

137
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,960
one so our music gaming fans would be very happy at this they have a DDR

138
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,920
supernova Wow oh it's a new unit I haven't even played the why me I played

139
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,120
it at e3 and the Konami gamers I haven't played like the final release version of

140
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,860
Yeah, I actually didn't play because when we went it went to one a little smaller ones just to play skee-ball

141
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,960
They had an extreme there. So Chris and I played that but

142
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:05,180
Probably lots of the DER free kids spider stomp there. I counted three spider. That's old-school DDR spider stomp

143
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,900
Yeah, and there's it they have a dock upstairs now Derby Inner Club. Very cool. All right

144
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,120
Anyway, Loki. How was your gaming week? It was pretty good

145
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,020
I've been playing

146
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:25,220
the hell out of the Saints Row demo. Got mine. Actually it was funny because I thought my magazine,

147
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,060
the official Xbox magazine, I thought my subscription ended, but it has now

148
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,140
after I got the demo, which is, you know, where it counts.

149
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,340
And it's really fun. Saints Row is

150
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,300
basically Grand Theft Auto. I mean, they've improved on a few things and

151
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,620
there's a few things that are kind of

152
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,780
not as great. But for the most part, it's very enjoyable and

153
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,660
That demo we play for an entire hour each lunch.

154
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,460
What are the things that are different? The things that are different, first off,

155
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,860
the camera's a lot better

156
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,980
with the right analog stick and like for example if you have pipe bombs and stuff

157
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,780
you can toss stuff behind you

158
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,940
as you're running, you know, which you can't do in Grand Theft Auto.

159
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,620
Also most of the guns you can run and fire at the same time and stuff like that.

160
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,220
Plus the cars explode a lot better, shrapnel flies everywhere and you can

161
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,980
actually get hit with shrapnel and stuff like that. You can do some of the fun things. You

162
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:27,300
can rob stores and hold people up at gunpoint and stuff like that. You can beat old people

163
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,860
and steal their money, which is great. Hooray! And one other fun thing you can do, gang wars

164
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:40,340
and stuff like that. It's just very involved and the demo so far is pretty awesome. Just

165
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,260
the sheer amount of stuff you can do in the game

166
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,540
is pretty cool.

167
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,300
You can drive cars into gas tanks and make them explode

168
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,420
which is awesome.

169
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,860
Let's see, other than that I've been playing a little bit

170
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,800
of just, you know, other Xbox stuff like Ridge Racer 6 a little bit

171
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,280
and haven't really played too much of ChromeHounds. I did finish like the

172
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,620
was it soldier mission thing or whatever and

173
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,860
Speaking of ChromeHounds real quick, Blaze Revolution in chat says

174
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,060
he's having problems getting into the OL army clan on ChromeHounds. How did the

175
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,820
folks get in there?

176
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,900
Well apparently from what people have told me now, someone has to be online

177
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,260
in order to join. So I have to be online at some point in order for people to join.

178
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,020
So watch the forums. I'll

179
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,780
take a time where I'm actually logged in and then everybody can come join.

180
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,020
OrangeLoungeRadio.com click on forums. Exactly. The other thing though that's

181
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,100
kind of fun and neat

182
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,980
is I think a while back I mentioned I signed up for the Atari

183
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,220
beta for Test Drive Unlimited and I got in

184
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,460
and I got my disc and it's interesting on PlayStation 2

185
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,660
the game... Wait, aren't you under like an NDA or something? No.

186
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,820
Anyways, the game, at least not that I read

187
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,940
and if you didn't read it then hell, who cares?

188
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,260
If I didn't see it, it's not illegal. Anyways, so the game itself

189
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,040
it's pretty cool I mean it plays very similar to the Xbox 360 demo that I

190
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,600
played

191
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,360
of course graphics are a lot less you know Xbox 360 but

192
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,120
they do the job you know it is an online game you know completely so

193
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,920
if you still roll down the window that was an impressive feature in the Xbox

194
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
demo here's the thing though

195
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,640
a lot of stuff isn't finished yet because it's beta like all the interiors like I went

196
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,920
oh I'm gonna look at the interior of the car see it looks like

197
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,440
nothing happened it's all glitched out I'm like okay that doesn't work

198
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:39,440
I'd like to see what my driver looked like. There's no driver, it's just the ghost car, because they haven't finished that yet, because it's still beta.

199
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,440
But it's still fun though, and you can drive off-road just as easily as you can with this car.

200
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:51,440
I don't know, the PlayStation 2 version, I probably wouldn't pick it up because I have a 360, so why bother?

201
00:10:51,440 --> 00:11:02,440
And you know what's weird is unless they drop the Playstation 2 one, I think the 360 one is actually going to be cheaper, because it's going to be $39.99, so why not pick it up?

202
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:11,440
But it's a fun game, you know, it's pretty cool, and it's definitely easy to get online with, which I haven't played too many online games, but I know there's been some difficulty.

203
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,440
No lag, I haven't noticed any lag in it, but it's pretty fun.

204
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,640
fun. Yeah, Hitstun also really loved your review there on the graphics. The graphics

205
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:26,440
are a lot less Xbox 360. They're very stripped down, very, very, very stripped down. How

206
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,140
so? What's missing? Just a lot of the detail that's in there. A lot of the, like, definitely

207
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,400
textures are, you know, it's just not as detailed as, like, the Xbox 360. It reminds me of the

208
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,800
old Test Drive games, which, you know, last Test Drive I played other than this, which

209
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,520
was a long time ago, Test Drive 3 on the PC. I mean, that's when the cars were blocks.

210
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,000
I mean, just... Yeah, I was gonna say, probably the last Test Drive game I've played seriously

211
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,440
was like Test Drive 2 The Duel, was that it, on Commodore 64. It was pretty old. I mean,

212
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,960
this was back in the day when Test Drive, you just basically had to get, you know, to

213
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,240
the end of the map or whatever, and that was a journey. I mean, I would always try to take

214
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,240
the shortcuts through the fields and run over the 2D chicken or whatever and just... I don't

215
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,080
know. It's a good game. All you have is a PlayStation 2. It's still going to be very

216
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,760
good. So, you know, check it out. Or even the PSP one, when that comes out, will be

217
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,240
pretty decent. So, they're worth checking out. And then I think, of course, more Grand

218
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,640
Theft Auto. And, you know, we're getting to a point now with Grand Theft Auto. Every

219
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,240
day we play this game, the more and more frustrated we are at the developers and the more we want

220
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,920
to kill them because of how buggy the multiplayer is.

221
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,200
And it's really sad because I wish I had a way to contact the developers at Rockstar

222
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,520
because I have so much feedback I can give them on their game, both positive and negative,

223
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,440
because I've basically played this game every single day for at least 30 minutes.

224
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
So yeah.

225
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,040
They need to give me a call.

226
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,800
If anyone from Rockstar is listening, contact Loki at loki.orangelaunchradio.com.

227
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
L-O-K-I.

228
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,080
I hope to god, because this is built on the Vice City engine

229
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,600
Liberty City Stories was, and now that Vice City Stories is coming out, you bet your ass

230
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,680
they're not going to do anything to fix any of the multiplayer because they're

231
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,360
fucking stupid. But I'll still buy the game.

232
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,200
When does the Saints Rogue demo get released for the rest of us? I heard Tuesday

233
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,500
Is it? Or August 1st. Sweet. So

234
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,760
check it out. I will. For whatever reason

235
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,320
It's not up that day. You can always find it at the official Xbox magazine.

236
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,760
Alrighty. Mr. 23rd Magus, AKA Andrew, how was your gaming week?

237
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,120
It was alright. I was looking to make some crazy money, but instead I just sat my ass on the couch,

238
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:50,240
sort of chair, yeah chair, and played Tellur-Iris. You could tell that Nippon Ichi did all the

239
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,200
translating because the script is absolutely hilarious.

240
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,160
What is this game?

241
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,400
Uh, Tellur-Iris Eternal Mantle.

242
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Just a little dialogue with the catgirl asking the protagonist to sleep in bed with her.

243
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,400
The response is, I can't, the ESRB would go nuts.

244
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Other than that, I haven't been doing much gaming, mostly because of the heat affecting my computer.

245
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,400
I have been trying Fable off and on, and it's the first time I've actually played Fable.

246
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
PC or Xbox?

247
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
PC.

248
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
What do you think?

249
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,400
It's interesting. It's not what it was hyped up to be, obviously.

250
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
How so?

251
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,400
But it's still pretty damn fun. It's not a completely open world like it was promised.

252
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,400
But it is still pretty fun. It plays more like Knights of the Old Republic, with the whole good and evil thing.

253
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Okay.

254
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:51,400
My Gaming Week. I actually played quite a bit as well. I downloaded the 99 Knights demo because I really liked the game at E3 when I got to play it.

255
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,960
I seem to remember when I actually played the full game at E3, it was a lot easier than

256
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,280
the demo, because I died like three times in the demo.

257
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,400
I think I was doing something wrong.

258
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
The game's really fun.

259
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,520
I liked it a lot.

260
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,240
It's kind of a button masher, but it reminds me of a game like Final Fight or probably

261
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,720
more rather something like Golden Axe, but on a much bigger scale.

262
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,320
I mean, in Golden Axe, you cannot kill 50 people in one swoop of the sword and things

263
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,480
like that, and you can't stab somebody on the end of your sword and then use his body

264
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,840
to attack other people.

265
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,200
It's fun, I mean you're fighting armies, just lots and lots of people.

266
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,840
The game's pretty intricate, it looks great, I really enjoyed the demo, I definitely want

267
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,360
to pick up the full game even if I suck at it.

268
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,680
I noticed already in the chatroom though some other folks didn't seem to like the game.

269
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,160
It definitely seems like the type of game you're either going to really like or you're

270
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,200
going to really hate maybe because of its simplicity and the fact that it is kind of

271
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,920
a bit of a button masher. I think some people are really going to get turned off by that.

272
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,980
And a lot of people are comparing it to Dynasty Warriors, to be honest. I think this is actually

273
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,180
a lot better than Dynasty Warriors. It definitely looks a lot better because Dynasty Warriors

274
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:02,000
5 fucking sucked on the Xbox 360. They didn't really do anything. And Samurai Warriors 2,

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,020
when that comes out, that one's going to suck also because also another port without any

276
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,800
effort is basically what it was. But it looks, to be honest, this demo looks a lot better

277
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,200
than what I remember from E3. It looks like a lot more fun. So, I don't know. And it just

278
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:24,800
seems more fun than Dynasty Warriors was. Alright. Let's see what else I've been playing.

279
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,000
I actually picked up- did you have something? Oh, okay. I picked back up Oblivion randomly.

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,720
I had tried playing this game a while back and I thought it was very pretty, but I think

281
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,720
the problem was I had someone hovering over my shoulder telling me what to do, like everything,

282
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,640
and I think that might have ruined the gaming experience for me, so I went back and checked

283
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,760
it out, and it's great.

284
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
I wouldn't be that person.

285
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Do something, would I?

286
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,960
No, it's not, it wasn't really you, it was kind of everybody was hovering, everybody

287
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,840
else had played it but me, because a lot of people, and everybody was like, do this, do

288
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,320
this, do this, and I'm like, shut up!

289
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,020
But I had a chance to just sit down and sort of explore it for myself, and it's so, I guess

290
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,260
the only word I can use to describe this game is vast.

291
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,180
You really can do just whatever you want.

292
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,800
It reminds me of like a first person shooter but with swords, but yet the world is open

293
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,900
and you can go anywhere you want, but that vastness is kind of like a good thing and

294
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,300
a bad thing because that vastness, I'm so used to very linear types of story in games,

295
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,260
so it was really hard for me to go, oh, I could just go anywhere I want and do these

296
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,260
other quests before doing the main quest.

297
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,980
Because I tried to just go, da da da da da, start doing the main quest.

298
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,220
I got murdered ten ways from Sunday, like so horribly, because my character wasn't buffed

299
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,340
up enough yet, I hadn't really practiced with spells and all that stuff, my character didn't

300
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,960
have enough stuff, so it kind of took me a little while to get used to that, but it's

301
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,100
a great game, and I think it's a way for folks who are in the first person shooters in that

302
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,940
genre game, sort of like a really good entry level to RPGs, maybe you're the type of person

303
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,440
that's like, I hate RPGs, well maybe this is more your style, there's different types

304
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,660
of RPGs, this is not a Final Fantasy RPG by any means, this is completely different, it

305
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,780
It really reminds me of an old PC, which makes sense when you consider what the game is.

306
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,780
It reminds me of an old PC-type role-playing game.

307
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,940
That's more what it is.

308
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,820
But I had a great time with it, and the graphics are gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.

309
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,080
And I think the way that they expand it in Marketplace is just great.

310
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,860
This is definitely probably the title to have at launch.

311
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,860
It's a great game.

312
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,860
Loved it.

313
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,900
Although, honestly, I just don't know how long I'm going to be able to put up with it

314
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,320
before my brain explodes from all that stuff to do and there's just a million other games

315
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,660
I want to play. Because if I get too far into Oblivion, I'm not going to play anything else.

316
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,540
Here's the best thing you've got to know about Oblivion.

317
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,660
Okay.

318
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,620
Oblivion, join the guilds. Because when you join the guilds, you can clear off their entire

319
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:54,480
shelves of everything and go sell it for money. That's the best part. I spent like a couple

320
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,300
hours just clearing off everything until I found out about the dupe, you know, trick

321
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:05,060
you can do but anyways I I've cleared off like just rated the entire you know

322
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,060
mage guild from all stole all their books and all their weapons and all

323
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,380
their potions and everything I just must have had like thousands of books that

324
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,020
I've taken and sold back as great DJ kibbles and bits in our chat room says

325
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,060
oblivion is one of those games you have to experience on your own it's just too

326
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,700
damn huge to rush though I agree this is not like a typical gaming experience

327
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,780
it's something you really have to invest a little time in Andrew you said

328
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,500
you were having problems you know just getting slaughtered in oblivion right yeah here's

329
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,980
the thing in oblivion the way it works is the enemies level up as you do oh great if

330
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,940
you level up they're gonna level up and you're still gonna answer i think i thought i remembered

331
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,820
green that somewhere gear up that's what i need because i'm still using like the crappy

332
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,060
gear you get in the beginning minus what i raided from dead bodies you know so that yeah

333
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:56,380
i need to gear up yeah gear up because when they hit me i take massive damage here i thought

334
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
I thought I was going to say that.

335
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:05,700
Anyway, let's see, I picked up Prey because I like the demo, but I haven't played past

336
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,620
the demo sequence yet, so more to come on Prey next time.

337
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,820
Just they have achievements actually in Prey where you can play the poker and the arcade

338
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,340
games and the bar, and I think that's kind of funny.

339
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,340
Really?

340
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,340
Yeah.

341
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,340
Oh that's cute.

342
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,340
I like that, that's great.

343
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,940
One of the things with Oblivion is you can make poison tipped weapons and stuff like

344
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,340
that, so you can shoot them with a poison tipped arrow and just kind of wait for them

345
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,540
and die. Also real quickly, one other game I want to mention, Cloning Clyde. I picked

346
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,600
that up too from Xbox Live Arcade. Definitely reminds me of an old Super Nintendo puzzler

347
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,100
with a sense of humor. I keep wanting to say, like, Krusty's Fun House type game, except

348
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,200
Krusty's Fun House wasn't that great, but Cloning Clyde's fun. I mean, if you are curious

349
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,400
if you're going to like Cloning Clyde or not, seriously, just check out the demo, because

350
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,700
I think it's got a really good demo that really demonstrates what the game is all about. And

351
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,340
it's free you can't go wrong because I've had people send me like some folks that listen to the show had me on their

352
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,360
Friends list and I've gotten messages from people saying, you know, dude, should I get cloning Clyde?

353
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,200
I'm like seriously check out the demo

354
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,720
It's a really good representative of what the game is all about and if you like the demo you're gonna like the game

355
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,720
I think what about Galaga?

356
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:15,100
Galaga I checked out too. Thank you for reminding me a very easy achievement points super easy achievement points

357
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,420
I mean, I had a friend on my Xbox Live list who got all 200 achievement points within

358
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,060
like a couple hours.

359
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,420
The thing about Galaga is that it lets you continue from the stage where you died.

360
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,860
So getting that level 30 achievement or whatever is not a problem.

361
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,060
And all the monsters and those achievements, you kind of pick those up along the way.

362
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:38,020
So there's very few that require a lot of real skill.

363
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:45,020
it's not really an arcade game that I remember fondly from the 80s

364
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,740
but I know other people do who are probably yelling at me right now for

365
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,460
saying that I mean it just really depends what type of games you were

366
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,020
raised on

367
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,140
I think there is an audience for Galaga I don't think I was it because I got

368
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,860
bored of it pretty quick. Black Wolf

369
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,300
Bobby he was saying that be careful with the side images because it causes burn-in

370
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,420
on your screens. Wow

371
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,660
well it's not a game I would play for an incredibly long time anyway

372
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,020
What you just said reminded me of something too. What's that?

373
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,940
If anyone's ever interested in any of those Namco keychains like they were handing out at E3,

374
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,540
you can actually buy them at Kidrobot's store.

375
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:23,620
Where's that? Well, Kidrobot has a site online. They're the ones that were selling those big

376
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,860
vinyl gorillas figures. Oh, okay. But they have a store on Hayton Ashbury in San

377
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,380
Francisco.

378
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,940
Speaking of Namco and E3 and stuff, I

379
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,180
saw some old pictures last night. I found some old pictures. I found the pictures from

380
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,580
the year that they were demoing Wiiheart Katamari and remember when they had the

381
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,340
giant Katamari and everybody was putting their stuff on it so I found the picture of us

382
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,180
putting the ferret

383
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,220
on the Katamari. I also put one of our

384
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,900
demo samplers on there and a reject false icon sticker.

385
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,980
Yeah look see in chat GK128 says Galaga sucks you sir suck.

386
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,580
It's not that Galaga sucks it certainly led the way for a certain genre of games

387
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,300
it's just

388
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,740
it's not my bag baby okay you can continue from where you died

389
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:13,020
yeah it's that kind of eliminates a whole hardcore factor of Galaga

390
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,860
they hit it with a nerf bat but you don't have to you don't have to why can they put

391
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,060
like

392
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,060
Ikaruga on live I don't know okay I mean that would be

393
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,300
but that's right there's better stuff coming you actually just reminded me of the other

394
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,100
pinball I saw was Austin Powers pinball

395
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,580
but no you know what actually we need radiant silver gun

396
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,020
on a there we go thank you Legend of Zaku

397
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,860
right there that radiance over going to be awesome Zaku has it as well Gradius

398
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,240
greater than Galaga I would love to see Gradius but then again I already

399
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,540
have Gradius collection on PSP so maybe not so much. I thought Gradius was coming

400
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,540
was it? I think it was one of the ones. I know there was some shooter that was in that. Well Gradius and Contra

401
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,840
Contra and Super Contra are coming. Are they? Oh Contra I love Contra

402
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,820
I know Contra was I didn't know it was Contra and Super Contra. Contra and Super Contra

403
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,620
and I think Gradius and I've heard some other ones and

404
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,880
Street Bear 2 next week. I was gonna say I saw Time Pilot

405
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,460
in that preview too. I like Time Pilot. I think Rally-X

406
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,020
is coming. What else? Next week of course Street Fighter 2

407
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,180
which I couldn't give a shit. You know what's funny now that it's finally here

408
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm very meh about the whole thing. I'm like I kinda don't care anymore now that it's

409
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,720
here it's like

410
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,160
is it really gonna be that great? I don't know.

411
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,760
By the way, something else I think that our chat room might be vaguely interested in

412
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,960
is that the person that we bought our Twilight Zone from was the guy who

413
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,680
own working designs. We actually have a Goemon doll now that they were going to put out with

414
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,120
the next game they were going to do. Let's get them on the show. You should talk to them,

415
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,160
I'll see. I also have a copy of Sega Ages for Saturn. Very cool. But I thought that

416
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,720
that would be just a fun little bit. Eddie of the O.L. Army says Konami was a lot better than

417
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,120
Namco in the arcade. Well, it just depends what you're into. It depends on if you're at a Namco

418
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,020
arcade. It just depends on the type of games you're into. Alright, enough about my gaming

419
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,580
week, that's enough. Let's do some housekeeping real, real quick and then we'll get into the

420
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,020
gaming news. Just some quick housekeeping things. OrangeDawnTradio.com had some website

421
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,220
downtime earlier this week. We're not sure what caused it. I think it was some type of

422
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,360
DNS issue, tech stuff that goes above my head. Needless to say, when stuff like that happens,

423
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,140
our fearless webmaster, Mr. VX JasonXV, who we love and adore because he does the job

424
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:26,740
for free, is on things like that. So, we're sorry, but you know, that type of stuff is

425
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,900
gonna be inevitable, that things go down, you know, remember it's all free to you

426
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,620
guys, so just keep in mind things are gonna happen once in a while. We are

427
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,620
addressing some things with the website. You may see some real facelifts coming

428
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,700
to the website in the future, but a lot of that is a long ways down the line.

429
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,340
Can't talk about much more than that yet. We could, but it'd be a lie, and they

430
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,380
would have to kill you. That's right, we'd have to reveal what

431
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,260
happens at the secret OLR staff meetings, and then you'd have to die. And then the

432
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,540
the murders commence.

433
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,980
Also we wanted to say something about the podcast awards real quick.

434
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,020
The podcast awards nominations were announced and we're not there.

435
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,960
But oh well, the folks that were nominated, all five of them, independent podcasts, which

436
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
is pretty awesome.

437
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
That's awesome.

438
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,800
And we said, you know, we'd be happy as long as an independent won it.

439
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,280
You know, we can't, we don't want to hog it.

440
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,540
We can share, no, in all seriousness, folks that were nominated, there's some great shows

441
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
in there.

442
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,500
I know the folks at Gamertag, very passionate about what they do, DreamStation, huge community

443
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,460
over there, VGN Radio, fellow all-games show, completely different vibe than what we do

444
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
here, but that's awesome.

445
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:38,340
I think every independent show should do their own thing, Podtacular, Halo, nothing but Halo,

446
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,020
which for some gamers, that's what they do, nothing but Halo, you know, good show over

447
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,420
there as well.

448
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,100
So have fun, go vote, vote for an independent podcast, you don't have a choice, you have

449
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,820
to vote for an independent podcast.

450
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:56,580
And maybe we could invite the winners on our show so we could hand over our crown, like

451
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
at Miss America.

452
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,580
What they do.

453
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,380
Where is our crown?

454
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,700
I think it's sitting on Jamie's fireplace, actually.

455
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,860
It is sitting on my fireplace, yes, it's on my mantle.

456
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,700
So we'll, I don't know, we'll come up with something.

457
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,060
No, seriously though, have fun, remember, independent podcasts, we're there to support

458
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,060
each other.

459
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,880
I think every independent podcaster brings something different to the table.

460
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,240
And you look at those shows I've previously named and they've all got something different.

461
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,000
We have that history being the music game and we go to anime expos because a lot of

462
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
our fan base goes there.

463
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,940
These other shows have their own spin on things that they do.

464
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,920
So it's great.

465
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,480
And diversity is what makes the independent stand out over the commercial stuff.

466
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,040
In a way though, I almost kind of feel sorry for whoever wins because you're going to have

467
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,960
to put up with that same backlash that we did last year from kind of the corporates

468
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,940
who, I think, probably didn't like it that we won because there was some nasty stuff

469
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,780
written about us, including, oh, we're liars, we're drunks, dah, dah, dah, whatever.

470
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,940
Only on certain shows.

471
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,020
We're still here, we're almost at episode 200, you Corp cast are not going to scare

472
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,060
us away, and, you know, so what, we didn't get nominated.

473
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,900
It would be fun to do an entire show of lies.

474
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,420
I would love that.

475
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,420
That would be awesome.

476
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,460
Lying and being drunk, that'd be excellent.

477
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
Alright.

478
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,900
So have fun with the podcast awards this year.

479
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,220
Go vote.

480
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,020
And vote in the other categories, too,

481
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,300
because there's some other independent podcasters

482
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,100
in other categories.

483
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,780
There's some I've been listening to that have nothing

484
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,020
to do with gaming I've been listening to since we started

485
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,060
podcasting, and good stuff out there.

486
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,860
All right, let's get into some actual gaming news now,

487
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,940
and huge news, Jamie, huge news.

488
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,220
It's very big.

489
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,260
Well, you know how every year we get our butts into E3

490
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,260
and cover all the big news that's coming out, well guess what?

491
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,880
That has gone right down the crapper. There will be no more

492
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,580
E3 as it is known now. That's an important footnote,

493
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,940
as it is known now. There might be something. Well basically

494
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,780
Doug Lowenstein, who's the president of Entertainment Software Association,

495
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,460
is going to make the announcement that it's

496
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,500
gone by by kaput. Yeah, it kind of stinks that we're recording on Sunday

497
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,580
because there'll be more information on this tomorrow, Monday,

498
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,780
but we won't be here till next Sunday to really talk about it.

499
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,940
Well, a lot of the reason being is that

500
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,140
the publishers are, I guess, they're like,

501
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,100
you need to pay attention to us.

502
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,220
We want love too.

503
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,340
So, they whined,

504
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,700
and E3 listened. So, no more E3.

505
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:46,700
But there is talk of smaller shows next year, different, more focused events.

506
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,700
There are already other shows that go on.

507
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,700
Yeah, like the developers put on their own things.

508
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,700
Microsoft did something recently, right?

509
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,700
Yeah, the Microsoft Vision retail conference.

510
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
Konami's got something coming, I don't know if I'm supposed to say that,

511
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,700
but Konami has something coming up, and there's other stuff too, as well.

512
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,700
A lot of the own developers put on their own shows.

513
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,700
Microsoft's X06 is coming up.

514
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,380
It's gonna suck to not have it all on one roof.

515
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,040
However, it will keep, I think, a more even flow of information out for

516
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,180
people. It makes it easier on us. Because, you know,

517
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,300
if we have the different shows

518
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,580
come up, introduce their news, we're not putting

519
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,820
out. You know, Loki was working, you know, his butt off on the PSP site.

520
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,720
Instead of having to cram everything in and get the information out there before

521
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,560
the next guy,

522
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,440
There's actually going we'll be able to put it out in more digestible forms for other people. I think

523
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,760
Did you see this coming did anybody see this coming yeah, I saw them fussing about it

524
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,280
I thought they were just gonna close it off to certain groups

525
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,400
But well, maybe that might be what they're doing because we you know

526
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,560
We've heard downsizing of the show mentioned a lot where it's gonna be, you know, a very select audience

527
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,640
Meeting with developers in you know meeting rooms, but that kind of screws a lot of the small people out

528
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,640
It screws over the small press. There's no way in hell we're gonna get in there.

529
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
And it's gonna screw over Kenshiya.

530
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Everybody that had a show in Kenshiya, with the exception of Red Octane, is gonna get screwed too.

531
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Which is kinda sad, because there was some pretty kick-butt stuff in Kenshiya.

532
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,640
How are they gonna get it out there now?

533
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
It's kinda sad. I don't know.

534
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,640
But I mean, it's hard to say because all we have to go off of right now is like, kind of a...

535
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,920
Well, I wouldn't call it rumors, but a very cloudy statement is all we really have to

536
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,920
go off of right now.

537
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,920
But you know, for me, E3 kind of started becoming a farce when there was that whole line of

538
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,640
people to see Paris Hilton.

539
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,600
Seriously, that was my first clue that something's up with the show that's going to change.

540
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,200
I mean, that whole frickin' hours-long line of people to see Paris Hilton, that's not

541
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
what E3 is about.

542
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,680
Adam West, that's okay.

543
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
He's cool.

544
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Paris Hilton?

545
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,940
Just because she had a game, and how did she have a game anyways?

546
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,320
Her likenesses in it, I don't know, it's kind of stupid.

547
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,800
Blaze Revolution says, okay, independent gamers conference, something for those Kensha Halls

548
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
companies.

549
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:17,320
I think it's a great idea, but will it be covered by the big gaming sites?

550
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,380
And granted, we cover it, and we'd like to think that we could take on corporate, but

551
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,660
the fact of the matter is a lot of people get their news from the corporate

552
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,800
site so the corporate folks don't cover it or give it a little footnote in their

553
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,940
magazine.

554
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,340
The fact of the matter is that corporates are the ones that are the top of the

555
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,780
press list anyways when it comes to these small sites or

556
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,100
get togethers anyways. Like EA's

557
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,180
just have their little press event and stuff and

558
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,780
yeah the smaller guys don't see invites because you know what

559
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,660
in their eyes the smaller guy doesn't really matter.

560
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:56,060
Pleader says, oh no, what will G4 do for one week a year?

561
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,460
Bandit in our chat room says, did anyone see the video of when E3 opened this year and

562
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,180
saw how many people were running just to get to the Wii?

563
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Yeah?

564
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,180
Yeah.

565
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,260
I mean, granted, the Wii was a great thing to check out, but that probably is part of

566
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,420
the reason why E3 is changing.

567
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,420
You put all that together.

568
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,820
So I don't know.

569
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,540
What would you like to see happen from all this?

570
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,860
I really do think the idea of

571
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,580
independent shows being the more likely thing

572
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,580
I really do like the idea of different specific companies

573
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,060
putting out events where they can, I think, cater to

574
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,860
their audience a little bit better. Put more focus into instead of just their

575
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,820
little corner of

576
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,700
E3 and having to compete with everybody else there. I think it'd be cheaper for them

577
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,140
anyways because they all have to make these giant elaborate booths. They can just rent out a

578
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,340
building like Konami's gamer day they rented out what a club

579
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,980
and they just had you know some machine set up and stuff I'm sure that was a lot

580
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,220
less money for them

581
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,380
then you know because a club in the middle of the day when it's not open anyways

582
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,540
I mean that probably didn't cost as much as running a multi-million dollar

583
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,100
booth

584
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,300
Banda in chat has a good idea independent shows open to the public

585
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,220
why not have your Kenshi a show that's open to the public

586
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,820
get everybody talking about it. Well haven't they been trying stuff like this I mean

587
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,100
like, well, you've got PAX, for example, which is kind of like an E3, you know, in a sense.

588
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,900
You've also got, you know, that show that was in San Francisco, I think, that they had

589
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,100
some stuff there. Just, like, a lot of small...

590
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,780
There's the New York City thing they have, the October one that some of our listeners

591
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,540
trying to get us to go to. I can't remember the name of it now. They had the big DDR tourney.

592
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
Visual Life, something like that.

593
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,780
Yeah, something like that. And then I heard of another one in Pennsylvania somewhere that's

594
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,580
a big show, and, you know, there's...

595
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:51,360
Why not just do what, well, I don't know about this, but like, you know, why don't they just

596
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,160
do the mall tours again, you know?

597
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Just like...

598
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
The mall tours?

599
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,560
It's like, get into a mall and show off your new game, get, you know, go right to where

600
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
the consumer is.

601
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
I don't know.

602
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,040
It's gonna be very interesting to see what happens as time goes on with the whole...

603
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,080
Do you think there's gonna be a show that's trying to take the E3 crown?

604
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,720
No, I think that, well, I think what's gonna happen is E3 will still be around next year,

605
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,320
I think it's just gonna be a lot smaller

606
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,960
and more retard is who gets invited.

607
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,800
It doesn't matter anyways,

608
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,080
it's kinda going that way anyways.

609
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,440
Each year you go there,

610
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,960
like the first time we went there,

611
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,740
we went there as general admission or whatever,

612
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,600
then everything was press only.

613
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,840
And then you go there last year and we're press

614
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,000
and you go there and know,

615
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,220
oh sorry, you're not good enough press

616
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,000
to get into our press little thing here.

617
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,060
So next year you come back with even more credentials,

618
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,020
oh I'm sorry, you're just still not good enough

619
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,520
because these people have been doing it longer than you.

620
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,820
Our chat room is yelling.

621
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,820
The East Coast contingent is yelling, digital life, digital life, October 4th through 6th.

622
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,980
Digital life is where the little guys get their chance and all that, so maybe that's

623
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,440
something that's looking to take the place.

624
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,340
Our good buddy Bobby Blackwell from All Games reminded me of what the deal is in Pennsylvania.

625
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:09,580
It's in Philadelphia, America's video game expo at VGExpo.com, and apparently All Games

626
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,560
is doing something with that.

627
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,160
So that should be pretty cool, because I don't know what's going to happen now to E3 Outpost

628
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,980
Electric Boogaloo that was supposed to happen in 2007.

629
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,180
I say they do it anyway.

630
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,600
The E3 Funeral.

631
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
I'd go.

632
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
Bobby, if you go, we'll go.

633
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
The E3 Memorial.

634
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,760
The E3 Memorial.

635
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,600
So we have no idea what's going to happen with that, it just depends on what E3 turns

636
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
into.

637
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,480
I think that we should save up our money and go to Tokyo Game Show.

638
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,000
That would be pretty rad.

639
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,200
You think that Tokyo Game Show will end up taking the crown on this stuff?

640
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,640
It does in a way, yeah, I mean it does in a way.

641
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,760
Even Tokyo Game Show I think is too big. I personally like these smaller shows

642
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,180
because, like for example, Konami's Gamer Date, you've got to play the games.

643
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,560
There was not lines to play stuff.

644
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,940
It was great, it was small. That's the way it should be. Everybody got to play the

645
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,640
games, they got all the information,

646
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,900
you know, and that's it. None of the bullshit, you know, of, oh, well, sorry, you gotta make a

647
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,460
meeting, you know, in order to see this game that we're showing.

648
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:14,160
What the hell do you go to convention for to advertise your game and then you don't show your game?

649
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,560
That is the dumbest thing ever. I mean, I didn't understand that at all. It doesn't make any sense

650
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,840
You know like especially with you know

651
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,800
The Nintendo thing that kind of pissed me off a little bit because you go there to hype up your new machine

652
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,920
So what do you you make a line and you hold it behind closed doors?

653
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,200
That's stupid

654
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,360
Yeah, it's dumb. I mean, I don't get what they're trying to do. All right

655
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
Right.

656
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,880
Well, we're going to open up our voicemails of the week on this topic.

657
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,640
I know in the show role there's something different listed, but I think with this breaking

658
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,420
news we should shift our voicemail of the week to this topic, and if you want to give

659
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,200
us a call, it's 916-226-9067.

660
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,200
Not right now during the show, if you're listening live, but any time during the week,

661
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,600
give that a call unless you don't pay your phone bill, then you need to have somebody's

662
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
permission.

663
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
And give us a call.

664
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
We want to know your thoughts.

665
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,160
this announcement with e3 especially because there'll be more information on

666
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,760
Monday after we've taped really want to know what your guys thoughts are is e3

667
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,840
gonna be as relevant as it once was is this something that if not where do you

668
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,920
think the must be place is gonna be next year we want to know your thoughts so

669
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,560
leave us a voicemail it's 9 1 6 2 2 6 96 Iowa because you know where I kind of

670
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,520
wanted to go because I knew Nellie wasn't gonna let me go to e3 next year

671
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,480
especially but now she's even more happy that it's canceled or at least you know

672
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,880
possibly canceled comic-con I think comic-con be fun I'll be it would be

673
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,520
interesting to see if comic-con picks up some of this well comic-con had a ton of

674
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,840
games there anyway it's true so and plus they have movie stuff we could speculate

675
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,880
forever but we won't know for real until we get some more information cons talk

676
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,480
about another show that's like way you know too much stuff going on I mean

677
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,640
I mean, there's a lot that doesn't even have to do with comics.

678
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,840
Moving on to another story here, we talked about independent podcasts and independent

679
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,080
developers being hurt by E3, I want to talk about this independent production.

680
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:20,640
We had some folks from this production on our show a couple months ago, and it's a game

681
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,240
that's being made called the Silver Lining.

682
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,120
Now at one time this was known as King's Quest IX, the Silver Lining, but there was a whole

683
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,420
little bit of back-and-forth with Vivendi, who owns the rights to King Quest.

684
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,900
Well, Vivendi, there was a whole Save the Silver Lining campaign, and they were, you

685
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,420
know, I'd call it a success.

686
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,980
Vivendi is allowing this game to be released, only the title is now simply The Silver Lining.

687
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,820
Well, they had a big press event today, it was like a virtual press event, and they were

688
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,500
nice enough to invite me, because we had them on the show previously, so I checked it out,

689
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,380
and I would call this King's Quest labor of love.

690
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,880
I mean, it is so obvious to me that the folks behind this game just absolutely love these

691
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,660
characters that I'm assuming most of them grew up with, you know, through the various

692
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,060
King's Quest games, and how can you blame them?

693
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,620
The King's Quest characters were awesome.

694
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,600
Even I love, like, King's Quest IV, Rosella, and, you know, Graham and all that, so they

695
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,700
have really just poured their hearts into this fan project, and their big news today

696
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,780
is that they have actually released a playable demo that you can download for free.

697
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,660
You want to check this out?

698
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,800
Here's the other cool part about this, Orange Launch Radio, we're mirroring that demo.

699
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,020
You can download it on our site right now.

700
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,600
Check out www.orangelaunchradio.com, go to the downloads page, and you're going to see

701
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,400
in what you heard on the show recently, you're going to see the Kings Quest, I'm sorry, can't

702
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,720
call that anymore, the Silver Lining demo available to you.

703
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,540
It's about 77 megs, it's free, check it out.

704
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:48,880
If you like, I mean the art style is very Kings Quest 5, Kings Quest 6-ish.

705
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,380
It's kind of 3D, but it's not unfaithful to the previous games.

706
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,820
It's very cool, check it out.

707
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:59,860
It's an early build, but it just is a sign of things to come.

708
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,860
And it's not just that, they released, they actually had a guy write an original song

709
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,420
for the game, and they released the song today, and it's pretty good.

710
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:13,140
I mean, it's amazing, they have voice actors, it's crazy, it's like a big, it's like what

711
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,140
you'd see going into a high dollar production, but it's all happening on an independent scale.

712
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,140
That's awesome.

713
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,140
So check that out.

714
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:26,580
If you want to visit their website, it's www.tsl-game.com, and thanks to those guys again for inviting

715
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,340
us to the press event today.

716
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,340
That was cool.

717
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,340
Alrighty.

718
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,340
Awesome.

719
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:37,540
We're kind of, you know, talking about things that have been cancelled and, you know, not

720
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,540
happening.

721
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:45,660
One thing that was confirmed actually at Microsoft Vision Retail Conference was that the Project

722
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:52,780
Gotham 360 bundle, the Project Gotham 3, with the 360, you know, being bundled and everything

723
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:58,180
not happening. Despite what all those other websites out there say, not happening. Confirmed

724
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:05,540
by Microsoft. Here's my thing though. Not happening in the United States. All these

725
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,140
sites that are listing it, from what I've noticed so far, like Toys R Us I think was

726
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:15,420
in Canada, and I think the EB1 I saw was in Canada too, maybe happening in Canada. That

727
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,300
That might be something because, you know, maybe the 360 is just not selling as well

728
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,660
as the United States.

729
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:28,100
So you might see a bundle either being put together by retailers themselves, or maybe,

730
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,540
you know, being done in another country.

731
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,540
So look for that, but it is not happening in the United States, I mean, I don't think

732
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:39,140
they really have to worry about dropping the price, especially with the Playstation 3 being

733
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,140
so expensive.

734
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,660
They are really not worried about that.

735
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,500
is one of our Canadian listeners in chat and says there is no EB game website for Canada.

736
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,700
Well, whatever. The one site I saw, the one site I saw I assumed it was Canada because

737
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:55,140
all their prices were wrong. Because they were listing everything as $69.99 retail for

738
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:01,780
like all the Xbox 360 games and that's way off. So, whatever. It doesn't matter. It might

739
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,380
be happening in another country. That's my only assumption that people are getting this

740
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:12,380
from someplace, but Microsoft is saying no, so take it as you will.

741
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,280
I do have some things that are coming out. Well that's good, that's refreshing.

742
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,560
But for the UK. Great, so we have more news about games that

743
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,720
aren't coming out in this country. Well, because they probably already have or

744
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,800
will be around the same time. True, so enjoy these UK guys.

745
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,480
So these are the games that will be released first week in August.

746
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:38,320
First, we have Pox Nora for PC, then we have on the fourth, Monster House for various systems,

747
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:49,600
Pro Stroke Golf World Tour 2007, and Sing Star Anthems on PlayStation 2.

748
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,560
There's a few things that are announced.

749
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,040
Oh, Sing Star Anthems is the gay one, isn't it?

750
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,040
I think so.

751
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,040
I think that is.

752
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,640
It's one that they're marketing towards the gay audience.

753
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,920
I remember talking about this a few shows ago.

754
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,920
Still not interested.

755
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,920
Sorry.

756
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,720
But our listeners over there should keep their eyes open, though later on in the month there's

757
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:13,640
going to be Dig Dug Digging Strike, Guilty Gear Dust Strikers, and Star Fox Command.

758
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
Alright.

759
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
Very cool.

760
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,640
Good stuff.

761
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,080
In the United States, though, we're getting some pretty neat stuff.

762
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:26,180
First thing's going to be FlatOut 2 on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and also, I believe, the PC.

763
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,740
so that should be pretty awesome. Um, I know we're getting Super Monkey Ball Adventure,

764
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,660
so if you're a fan of the Super Monkey Ball games, look for that. How many of those freaking

765
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:40,380
Monkey Ball games are there now? Too many. Um, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and PSP. Um,

766
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,500
let's see, I believe there was also Barnyard coming out, which is based on the upcoming

767
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,940
animated film, which, yay. Sorry, that just made me think of Barnstorming, and if you're

768
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,220
an old school 2600 player, you gotta know Barnstorming. It was one of the baddest games

769
00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:00,780
They had I mean bad meeting good because this was the 80s after all it's one of the baddest games on the Xbox 360 was barnstorming

770
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,660
That's all okay. Why don't they remake that I?

771
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,140
want barnstorming

772
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,460
2006 on the Xbox 360 move over chickens here I come

773
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,560
That's basically the good stuff. I'm really waiting for in the week after that though. We're

774
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,860
Dead rising is coming out 99 nights is around the corner to write

775
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,660
Yeah, Dead Rising is coming out in 99 nights is the week after that very exciting

776
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:30,380
So lots of good stuff and then scenes row at the end of August as well as Madden

777
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:36,860
I was at a I was at a GameStop today finally getting rid of top spin too because I just didn't freaking play it and

778
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,600
picking up prey and

779
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,960
They were taking the pre-orders for you know those games, but they were like, you know

780
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,440
They had the demo or they had the really nice setup there for 99 nights coming soon Dead Rising coming soon all that stuff

781
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,440
So and I checked out the trailer on Xbox 360 for Dead Rising very bloody very fun

782
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:03,040
Oh, I can't wait parents are gonna be mad. Jack Thompson's gonna have a stroke. It's gonna be great. Oh really? I

783
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,560
Won't tape somebody

784
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:12,040
Well, I'm hoping I can do though is be able to derail that train that's in Saints Row. That's gonna be awesome

785
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,480
But yeah, that's basically what's coming out. It's gonna be a little slow for a while

786
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,520
But um, give it a couple more weeks, but about the week of August

787
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:25,520
Probably the third week in August or so, things are going to start picking up and they're just not going to stop until Christmas.

788
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
Sweet.

789
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,520
Guess what's not coming out, though?

790
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,520
Aw, sad. What?

791
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,520
The Sopranos on Xbox 360.

792
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,520
It got the big boot.

793
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,520
I have to be honest, I totally forgot. They were making this game, so no loss here.

794
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,520
And I don't watch the show. Well, what happened?

795
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,520
I just think that the reason is funny.

796
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,520
HQ is saying because there's no difference between that and the PlayStation 2 version.

797
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,520
What?!

798
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,360
Okay, that hasn't stopped them from releasing other multiplatform games?

799
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,520
Well then again, they're not EA.

800
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,500
Yeah, that's true, maybe this is a different developer, maybe they just have a different

801
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,380
outlook on this, a more realistic outlook of, maybe we just don't want to upcode the

802
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,680
damn thing and sell it again.

803
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,960
Maybe it's just a waste of our time.

804
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,480
Well, they were saying that after they spoke to their, after a few financial conferences,

805
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,760
basically said, uh, it's discontinued. Um, the PlayStation 2 version is still going to

806
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:22,700
go through, it should be out around Christmas, um, or Yule, or whatever holiday you worship.

807
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,320
Just in time for the show to be going off the air, from what I understand, because I

808
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:29,780
think their last season's coming up, so, or early 2007 or something, so.

809
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:35,940
Well the game is supposed to be sort of a GTA style, as in you go out and do jobs. I

810
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,640
didn't watch the surprise. Sorry, I have to roll my eyes a little bit

811
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,580
at that it kind of seems like all these mob things are caught in between like

812
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,300
Scarface, they're all copying the... Hey, don't talk bad about Scarface. I'm not, I'm not.

813
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,640
The movie's a legacy, but I'm just saying it's kinda like I can't, I hope

814
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,800
when they say GTA-like

815
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,000
it means inspired by but very different.

816
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,600
Well, they're all kinda down in that sandbox games is what it, it's basically

817
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,640
like a genre now. Well, that's okay.

818
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,100
Well, speaking of Scarface,

819
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,820
Apparently the Xbox 360 version's been cancelled.

820
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,440
To be honest, I didn't realize there was an Xbox 360 version coming out

821
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,860
because this thing was announced, what, back in E3 2005 for the 360?

822
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,540
And I didn't even realize that they had

823
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,940
decided to continue doing that because it's always been PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PSP.

824
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,220
Which is not a surprise. Eddie in our chatroom says Scarface was never officially announced for

825
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:31,600
360. Exactly. That's what I was kind of surprised. I was like, I don't remember that.

826
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,420
But apparently people have been writing the news stories that it's not, I guess.

827
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:38,700
before it must be true. I guess, if the press is saying it. If they're not liars in the

828
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:45,700
corporate media. Or drunks. Anyway, after all, Final Fantasy 13 looks very much like

829
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:53,420
7. Anyways, the 360 Scarface not coming out, the PSP Scarface though is coming out, and

830
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,780
to be honest Scarface looks very similar, I mean I guess it's very similar to Vice City

831
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:01,620
because Vice City ripped off Scarface, so it should be a pretty awesome game, the voice

832
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:07,440
talent and it's amazing and just it looks very fun so check that out it's

833
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:14,800
coming out in September all right any other 360 news while we're at it I can

834
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:24,000
do a 360 all right no actually there is you could do a 360 I don't yeah I don't

835
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,420
don't really know how to read it or a graphic I don't know as in I can turn

836
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:37,940
around in 360 degrees geez guys I can do a 60 you know what I'm not gonna finish

837
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:45,480
it pop you know what we don't need to do that yeah so 360 my Xbox 360 dark I have

838
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,400
nothing else about the 360 but I do have something about PSP okay Scarface is

839
00:49:50,400 --> 00:50:00,780
coming out on PSP really we get more mob fun so yes Scarface the world is yours

840
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:08,640
is not coming out on the Xbox 360 it is coming out on PSP hmm all right anyway

841
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,280
that's sort of a stripped-down version what about this game dawn of war there

842
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,420
was more no has different name to it's called power of money respect it's a

843
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:23,940
turn-based strategy. Anyways, there's this Warhammer 4000 game coming out on the

844
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,820
360 as well called Dawn of War, which to be honest, I remember playing Warhammer 4000,

845
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,540
actually Space Marines, because I used to have the actual miniatures and stuff,

846
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:39,660
which is pretty cool, but the Warhammer 4000 game, the series has been around

847
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,740
for a long time, especially in tabletop and PC games now. We'll actually be getting

848
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,460
a 360 version, so it's pretty sweet. They're also planning on making a PS3

849
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:53,140
version of course whenever that system finally rolls out um so look forward to that pretty soon

850
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,300
it's kind of nice to see them doing it i remember actually uh space marines they used to do a space

851
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:03,780
marine game on uh the pc and have a really cool intro song but uh yeah space marines kind of

852
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:08,420
sucked sorry i have to mention the scarface comment in our chat room because it's kind of funny

853

858
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:45,580
and NASCAR, if you like NASCAR, whatever. Speaking of things that are not funny,

859
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,860
Gears of War is, apparently there's some

860
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:53,260
users spamming on Xbox Live,

861
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,840
some Gears of War stuff, and people are thinking, oh wow, it's some crappy viral

862
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,780
campaign.

863
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:02,380
And, well, we don't really know, but it's, a lot of the messages have been pointing

864
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:02,940
back

865
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,340
to Gears of War forum, and apparently there's more messages on there, and apparently

866
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,820
some giant announcement is supposed to be happening this week, so... How come I'm not getting

867
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,640
spammed. It kind of makes me feel left out. I'm not getting spammed either. This makes

868
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:20,180
me kind of sad. Apparently we're just not real press. Apparently not. We're just not

869
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:24,640
cool enough to be getting spammed. You know what, maybe it's just some dick spamming a

870
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,140
forum. It happens all the damn time. It's the same people spamming on live and it's

871
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:36,760
basically some stupid little... It's the main character's names and they're Marcus Phoenix

872
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:42,520
or M Phoenix in this case, he's, you know, we need your help, can't talk now, don't know

873
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,840
who to trust, we'll send more tomorrow, and just, you know, kind of messages like this

874
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,720
very cryptic, retarded messages.

875
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,720
Yeah, but Gears of War still looks cool, so I forgive it.

876
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,720
Here's my question to you.

877
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,720
That game was pretty hot.

878
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,560
Do you really need a viral campaign?

879
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,720
I mean, people think the game's awesome anyway.

880
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,720
Yeah, that's true.

881
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,880
That's like, oh, let's hype up Halo 3 because people don't know about Halo 3.

882
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,880
Come on.

883
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,560
stupid but whatever you know at least hey at least it's not saying this is

884
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,840
Marcus Fenix and I want you to check out my new burnout revenge clip that I have

885
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:21,920
online be sure to recommend it by the way bike years war coming on November

886
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,640
well November so far because we're not sure to make they might push it up

887
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:31,160
according to some of the rumors out there all right well now every week on

888
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,400
this program we like to let dark soccer speaking of Gears of War we like to let

889
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:43,420
DarkSakura start grinding her gears over there and surf the internet up and down and back

890
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:51,300
and forth and try to find a website that she wants you, yes you, our listener to view promptly

891
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,600
because it's awesome. So DarkSakura, what are the kiddies going to be looking at this

892
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,600
week per your request?

893
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:05,880
Our listeners are going to be looking at the best page in the universe.

894
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,880
orangetownsradio.com?

895
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,880
It's worth a try.

896
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,200
Okay, second best page in the universe.

897
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,200
Alright, what is this?

898
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,000
The address is maddox, m-a-b-d-o-x dot x mission dot com.

899
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Jesus.

900
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Alright.

901
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,320
I just think that this guy's sense of humor is pretty funny.

902
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,840
He's kind of controversial.

903
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,840
It's controversial.

904
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,840
I mean, even if you don't agree with what he says, at least it's remotely entertaining.

905
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,840
Fair enough.

906
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,840
I meant to get his book, though, but...

907
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,840
The alphabet manliness.

908
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,840
I think...

909
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,840
The whole C is for Chuck Norris, and there's a whole chapter on him.

910
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,840
Let the Chuck Norris joke die.

911
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,840
Step away from the Chuck Norris joke.

912
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,840
He's talking about how bad-ass Chuck Norris is.

913
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,840
I'm talking to you barons, folks.

914
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
We can dig it.

915
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,840
But some of the editorials on here are as follows.

916
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:58,840
I hate Cameron Diaz. Star Wars Episode 3 is a steaming pile of Sith. If these words were

917
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:04,640
people I would embrace their genocide. I just wanted a video game, not an eternal damnation

918
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:11,400
in hell. I am a genius. Oh, that was me playing Pink Pals. I am a genius, you are not. The

919
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:16,760
Eleven War Songs of 2004, which by the way, they're all YouTube. Ben Stiller should star

920
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:24,020
every movie and video games you'll never play which is great that was what kind

921
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:29,000
of games will we never play you know what I have to pull that up give me a

922
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,020
second how about that backwards compatible Barbie game on the Xbox

923
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,940
that's one game I won't play how about just the really manly suicide of ramming

924
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:40,380
your head against the pavement you know a game I will play though that looks a

925
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:48,540
lot like Barbie. Dead or Alive Xtreme 2. That trailer is minutes of entertainment. I can't

926
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,100
say hours, because the trailer is only a few minutes.

927
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,100
Rob, even I wouldn't play that.

928
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:58,220
He also puts up his hate mail, too. And apparently writes whole articles based on hate mail.

929
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,660
And he did one about Ikaruga.

930
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,900
Yeah, but then people will write hate mail just to be in the hate mail page.

931
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,300
Of course. And apparently he's also banned in several countries.

932
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,300
Wonderful.

933
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,740
His website is not accessible from the...

934
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,740
I love what he wrote about Ikaruga though.

935
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,340
If you suck at video games, don't bother reading this review because this game is hard

936
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,860
and I don't want whining retards who can't pass the first level bitching to me about

937
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,860
it.

938
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:23,020
When I say this game is hard, I mean hard light nipples on a plymoth pin.

939
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,580
Oh my god, I can't say that.

940
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:28,260
Okay, way to go Dark Sakura, trying to earn this show an explicit tag.

941
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,260
I didn't say it.

942
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:36,260
Visit for yourself to read what was too hot for Dark Sakura to say on air.

943
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:42,180
moving right along them. Speaking of hard, Final Fantasy XI's achievements are fucking

944
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:49,340
impossible is what they are. But anyways, yeah, so, so far a lot of the achievements,

945
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:55,060
all 32 of them, you know, are fucking impossible, including most of which are level up your

946
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:00,580
character to 75, you know, excellent, you know, or just finish all the Promethea missions,

947
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:06,020
finish all the, you know, whatever. 30 shitty points for getting my bard to 75. Do you know

948
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:13,020
how long that'll take. You know what though, aren't achievement points are the easiest

949
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:18,160
character to fucking level. Hold on though. I can attest that they are not easy to level

950
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:24,420
as I was a bard. Aren't achievement points supposed to be hard to get? I mean, they're

951
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:27,700
badges of honor, right? Let me put it this way. Cause people bitch when they're too easy

952
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,180
like we just bitched earlier. Galaga's achievements are too easy. That's fine, that's fine. But

953
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:35,820
But if they're going to be hard, make them worth something like, you know, 100 points

954
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,220
or something instead of, you know, 30.

955
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:42,900
I don't want to play for 50,000 hours and go, ooh, 10 points!

956
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,900
Hell yeah!

957
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,700
They've only got 1,000 to distribute, though.

958
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,500
Because that's the Microsoft laws.

959
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,720
And you know what, they shouldn't have put achievement points anyways, because no one

960
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:56,020
was expecting them, and then they had to go put them out there, and now they suck.

961
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,020
Way to go.

962
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,420
You're just mad because you'll never get them.

963
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,620
I'm not playing that game.

964
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:05,620
I cancelled it yesterday, actually. Sorry, but I just wasn't playing it.

965
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:10,260
After you bought it on 360. Yes. Did you return it? Oh, you can't return that sucker.

966
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:14,140
No, I can't return it. Someday I might go back.

967
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,200
I quit once before. I'll go back.

968
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:23,700
But we'll see. God, one hell of an expensive frisbee.

969
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,980
You know, I can't addict.

970
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,620
You know what?

971
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:34,540
What? I wish this would happen to just about everybody that played it.

972
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:38,220
Hey, I know some great people that played Final Fantasy 11.

973
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:42,580
I played it for years and years. Addict! Now you're addicted to another crack.

974
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:46,100
I have nothing bad to say about it. It was time for me to move on and if

975
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,140
there's ever a sequel, you know I'm going to be playing it.

976
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,940
White mage equal party bitch. Alright, anyway.

977
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,860
However, all those people who are cheating,

978
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:03,620
uh-uh not anymore if you were basically caught cheating there's actually they've

979
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:08,460
actually banned another 2,000 accounts for the use of third-party software

980
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:13,860
tools I think they just don't want to be one up to buy World of Warcraft

981
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,740
because World of Warcraft put out that press release I remember was this week

982
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:21,260
or last week saying they banned like 30,000 people from the game or something

983
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,720
like that and Squeenix is like well we can't let them have the last laugh let's

984
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:30,600
ban some people too they're just good just because we can this is this is you

985
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:37,800
know Final Fantasy 11 honestly you need every so the window er it needs the

986
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,980
window er yes but that's a third-party utility and technically that didn't they

987
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:46,600
ban anyone who's using the window er can't you know is probably included in

988
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:51,000
the ban and I think they're that stupid because why should they monopolize your

989
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,980
resources you know that's why I love World of Warcraft you know at first I

990
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,380
was like eh but you can play it windowed you can change you can do other things

991
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,780
while you're playing when I was playing Final Fantasy 11 I had my laptop set up

992
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,940
beside me so that I could freakin browse the internet while I was playing a game

993
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:11,060
I still have my laptop for World of Warcraft because I have thought bought

994
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,820
up on it because I just can't I can't you know and maybe after years and years

995
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:17,500
of Final Fantasy 11 I can't play a game in a window like that I played Ragnarok

996
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:22,100
online for a very long time and also with that with Ragnarok you can't click outside

997
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:29,660
of it you have to just you have to shift you have to alt-tab remember kids alt-tab lets

998
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:34,620
you switch between your programs on a PC so which MMO do you think is going to ban people

999
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:41,320
next city villains toontown matrix all right well it's been a little while since we've

1000
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,360
had an interview on the program and tonight we're proud to welcome Nick Murray of Artistry

1001
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,780
entertainment to the program.

1002
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:50,140
Now, if you've been listening the past couple weeks of show, you'll know that some of us

1003
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:55,300
here in studio have been giving the Xbox 360 version of Prey a little bit of play lately.

1004
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:59,140
Part of what makes Prey such a memorable gaming experience is the use of integrated cinematics

1005
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,440
into the game engine.

1006
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,780
You can't have a great cinematic, though, without a great soundtrack.

1007
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:07,020
Through the website DirectSong.com, you can purchase two different soundtracks to the

1008
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:12,240
game Prey, as well as the compilation CD, Byte Meme, Music Inspired by Prey, which features

1009
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,480
There's bands such as MXPX, Real Big Fish, and the After Midnight Project.

1010
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,840
Nick not only produced this album, but contributed two tracks, and he's here with us to talk

1011
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,360
about this wide selection of music from the games.

1012
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,360
Nick, are you there?

1013
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,360
Yep.

1014
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,360
Hi, Scott.

1015
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,360
How are you?

1016
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,360
Hey, I'm really good.

1017
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,360
Thanks so much for being on our program tonight.

1018
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,360
I appreciate it.

1019
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,360
Yeah, my pleasure.

1020
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,360
Thanks for having me.

1021
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,360
Awesome.

1022
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,440
So now, for those folks that haven't played the game Prey, what do you think they're missing

1023
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,440
out on?

1024
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:42,280
Well, youíre definitely missing out on a lot of aliens, Indians, and everything in

1025
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,280
between.

1026
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:50,000
Itís a great storyline intertwined with shooting and endless hours of fun, basically.

1027
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,240
Tell us a little bit about the three separate Prey soundtracks available on DirectSong.com.

1028
01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:00,920
DirectSong.com, first of all, is a website thatís been around for almost a year now

1029
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:05,860
It features video game music exclusively.

1030
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:11,380
So when Prey came out, we really wanted to showcase the two volumes of the soundtrack

1031
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,380
for Prey.

1032
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:16,800
It's over three hours of music for the video game, and it's all done by Jeremy and Julian

1033
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:23,140
Soule, who are British Academy Award-winning video game composers.

1034
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:28,540
They added their orchestral skills to the game soundtrack, which intertwined very nicely

1035
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,540
with the video game.

1036
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:34,580
So those are both available for download on directsong.com, and all you have to do is

1037
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:41,780
log in and enter your information and stuff like that, and then you get the soundtrack

1038
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:45,420
in actually industry-leading audio quality.

1039
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:50,880
It's twice as good as iTunes and better than most of any of those other sites out there.

1040
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:57,780
So it's going at a rate of 320 kilobits, so it's almost CD quality.

1041
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:02,780
pretty much be undiscernable to any normal set of ears.

1042
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:07,020
Awesome. Now I know there's a third soundtrack available on the site as well, this Bite Me

1043
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:11,180
compilation. It's a compilation of music inspired by Prey, right?

1044
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:17,020
Yeah, this is a really fun project that we just put out, and basically what that is,

1045
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:22,780
is some of the music is from the video game, including the song that's in the end credits

1046
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:27,740
to the game by After Midnight Project called Take Me Home, and then we also have original

1047
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:34,380
music from MXPX, Real Big Fish, and lots of other artists. I think there's 13 artists

1048
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:39,600
involved total. This is a new thing for video games, to have bands come together and write

1049
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,980
music specifically for a video game. So this is kind of an industry first as well, where

1050
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:50,640
we really wanted to get bands of different genres, so it appeals to all different kinds

1051
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,640
We've got punk rock, we've got mainstream rock, we've got electronica, yet all the songs

1052
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:01,560
directly relate to Prey, whether it be through the musical instruments involved or the samples

1053
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:08,360
used or the lyrics and the themes invoked in the lyrics and stuff like that.

1054
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:12,600
What is it, do you think, about the game Prey that inspires all these artists to create

1055
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:18,680
these diverse kinds of music that all come back to being inspired by Prey?

1056
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:24,360
I think one of the things that inspired everyone throughout this process is the incredible

1057
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:28,560
graphics and the storyline that's portrayed through that.

1058
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:33,400
A lot of these people got to see some video clips and some of the trailers that came out

1059
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:41,240
before as well as we sent everyone an email that had the full storyline of Prey.

1060
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:45,080
Everyone saw quickly that this wasn't just a first person shooter with no story behind

1061
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,080
it.

1062
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,400
big part in most of the songs.

1063
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:54,840
You yourself contributed two tracks to this compilation, the tracks, Existence and Intervention.

1064
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:59,680
How did your experience with Prey inspire these tracks that you yourself contributed?

1065
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:07,720
Since I've been involved with Prey for about six months or so producing this album, it's

1066
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:15,160
been a part of my everyday work, so I've been thinking about it and looking at videos and

1067
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:19,560
really been intertwined with it for a long time, so being inspired by it wasn't that

1068
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,560
much of a problem.

1069
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:25,080
I really wanted to combine the themes of the game and the music.

1070
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,760
So in the game, you've got Tommy, the Native American, gets abducted by aliens.

1071
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,720
I really wanted to portray it through the music, kind of the same feeling, starting

1072
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:37,920
off with Native American themes and then have it be pretty much abducted by aliens and come

1073
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,880
across with more techno or industrial type sounds and stuff like that and work that all

1074
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,880
together.

1075
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,780
Now I remember actually playing through the Prey demo and then later on the game

1076
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,380
and I kind of remember the music was a really big part

1077
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:55,400
of setting the atmosphere in the game so definitely you know music lends itself

1078
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,080
very well to Prey and is an important part of setting the mood in the game.

1079
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:03,120
Exactly. Well we'd like to give our listeners... Oh, I'm sorry?

1080
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,860
Nothing, I was just going to say that

1081
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:09,700
Jeremy and Julian Stoll did a great job in my opinion of intertwining the music with

1082
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:13,220
the game. Sometimes you don't even notice there's music going because you're just so

1083
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:18,280
emotionally involved, and that takes a lot of skill from a composer to do that in a video

1084
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,280
game.

1085
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,280
Definitely, absolutely.

1086
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,160
Well, we'd like to give our listeners a taste of what's on this soundtrack, if you

1087
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,160
don't mind.

1088
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,300
So we're going to play track 10 from the Bite Me music, inspired by Prey compilation,

1089
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:36,280
The opinions rendered herein are those of the guests, and not necessarily those of Douglas

1090
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:42,280
And we're going to start the night by opening up the lines, and I can already tell you folks it's going to get very interesting.

1091
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:47,280
I'm getting some reports of strange lights in the sky from the Oklahoma area.

1092
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:54,280
Our affiliate in Oklahoma City is telling us that the state police, get this, are reporting mysterious lights all over the area.

1093
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:57,280
And that they're having a hard time responding to all of the calls.

1094
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,280
It's going to be a wild and woolly night, folks. I just know it.

1095
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,280
Let's go to the phones.

1096
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,280
Caller, you're on the air with Art Bennett.

1097
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,280
Yeah, art. That's art.

1098
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,280
Yes, it's art. Yes, it's art, caller.

1099
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,280
Yeah, this is George from Garland.

1100
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,280
You won't believe what's going on around here.

1101
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,280
There's lights all over the sky. I can't believe it.

1102
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,280
There's lights, you mean, in the sky right now?

1103
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,280
Yeah, right now. It's amazing.

1104
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,280
Where?

1105
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,280
Everywhere. Right over my house.

1106
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,280
They're moving from north to south.

1107
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,280
Can you tell me what they look like?

1108
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,280
Exactly what they look like. Can you tell me about it?

1109
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:39,280
There's our board of wing roll, neutral side, the three board, the board float, and the bridge.

1110
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,280
Oh my god!

1111
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,280
Wouldn't want a boarder that was so kind of a spaceship.

1112
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,280
It's coming right over the end of the sea.

1113
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,280
It's beautiful!

1114
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,280
The fellows out there in Texas giving a call, let us know what's going on in the sky, so that I can...

1115
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,280
I'll take the next call. You're on the air with our tail.

1116
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,280
Yes?

1117
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,280
Our tail?

1118
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,280
That would be a good idea.

1119
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,280
Oh, no, no, I'm not too bad.

1120
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,280
I don't believe you.

1121
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,280
Boo.

1122
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,280
Yes, you are.

1123
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,280
Come on, come on, come on!

1124
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,280
Strange things are happening tonight, both of you.

1125
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,280
You've made someone disappear.

1126
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:51,280
Okay Paul, you're still one of my spare clients, so expect that I could get you one of my non-weds excreting things from any other giant company.

1127
01:10:51,280 --> 01:11:20,780
I'm telling you, in research and awkward load of American legends, I've found several mentions

1128
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:25,780
of creatures returning to Earth from a grappling point of view.

1129
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:29,380
Alright, now that was Intervention by Nick Murray here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1130
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:31,940
Nick is joining us tonight to talk about the soundtrack.

1131
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:39,300
So Nick, Art Bell is in that song, and I remember hearing that same sample when I played through

1132
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,300
Prey.

1133
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,020
This guy is a legend in UFO culture.

1134
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:43,460
How did you get him on board?

1135
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:50,500
Well, he was actually signed on by Human Head to do some voiceovers for the game, and Human

1136
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:56,340
Head Studios was nice enough to give all of the artists involved in the soundtrack a sound

1137
01:11:56,340 --> 01:12:03,640
tree and sound clips from the game ranging from aliens vomiting to gunshot sounds to

1138
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:08,260
these voice-over samples and stuff like that, so it was really fun to try to remix that

1139
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:09,260
into the music.

1140
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:13,140
Now, for folks that really enjoyed that song, obviously they could pick up the Bite Me music

1141
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:16,040
inspired by Prey soundtrack, but what about your own other music?

1142
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,060
Do you have another site where you have your own music or...?

1143
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:28,540
Yeah, definitely. You can just go to nickmurraymusic.com and that has my updated blog and streaming

1144
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:30,420
mp3s for all my songs.

1145
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,280
Awesome. Now, talking about one of the other bands on the CD really quick, the After Midnight

1146
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:38,300
Project, of course, has the credit song from the game Take Me Home. There's actually a

1147
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:44,460
whole music video that you can see on the website about this. I was on G4 and some of

1148
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,980
the other TV stations. How did that happen? How did you guys think, oh, let's do a music

1149
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:52,420
video out of this?

1150
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:56,220
First of all, working with After Midnight Project has been really great throughout the

1151
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,220
whole process.

1152
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:04,400
They've been really nice to us, really involved in stuff like that, really good with promotion.

1153
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,740
One of the guys that works with us and actually works with the video game company, who's one

1154
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:12,140
of our main connections, named Jaron Moore, he has a film background and really wants

1155
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:15,540
to get into film directing.

1156
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,580
He managed that whole project, the whole music video.

1157
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:22,260
He went out to L.A. and filmed the band and actually did all the editing and splicing

1158
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:26,620
and the game footage and all of that, so it was a really good effort by Jern and it turned

1159
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:27,620
out really well.

1160
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,620
Awesome.

1161
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,100
Well, congratulations on that.

1162
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:33,980
I know this has been getting airplay I read about on the site, so that's great.

1163
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:39,500
Now, talking about the website as a whole, directsong.com, I noticed that Prey isn't

1164
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,900
really the only thing available there.

1165
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:44,940
There's several game soundtracks like Oblivion, Dungeon Siege 2.

1166
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:50,460
What do you think are the advantages of digital distribution for music?

1167
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:58,580
One thing is that games are digital, so weíre staying within the same realms as what gamers

1168
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,580
are used to.

1169
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:08,020
Second of all, what we hope to do is give the users more game music expansion.

1170
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:13,980
Right now, you can download expansion packs for Guild Wars on our website, one of the

1171
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,660
the first games that we put up on our website,

1172
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:19,260
and that music is brand new music

1173
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:21,260
that will then work in-game.

1174
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,060
So that's a really fun piece of technology

1175
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,780
that we're offering,

1176
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:26,740
besides just downloading the soundtracks.

1177
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,740
That of course all needs to be digital

1178
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:30,780
so it can work into the online games.

1179
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:33,080
I noticed that's a really exciting addition

1180
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,460
I noticed to the site,

1181
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:35,940
is that you can actually download

1182
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:38,500
these new soundtracks for games,

1183
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,460
and especially when you think about an MMO type of game

1184
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,420
like Guild Wars, where you're hearing the same music

1185
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:49,540
over and over, this seems like somebody should have done this a long time ago. This is great.

1186
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:54,020
Exactly. It's one of those ideas that you say, man, I wish I had thought of that.

1187
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:57,940
Well, you guys did, so congratulations. Have fun raking in the money there.

1188
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:00,940
Well, we hope so.

1189
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:05,500
All right. Well, now just kind of out of curiosity, going to the other side of it, because we're

1190
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:11,060
talking about game soundtracks as a whole, some people in the past have complained that

1191
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:16,520
Why is it that you have all these B-movie soundtracks sitting on store shelves yet thereís

1192
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,460
no game soundtracks out there?

1193
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:23,860
Do you think that in the end thereís a market for game soundtracks in a CD-based traditional

1194
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:28,220
format or is digital distribution where itís at and where things are going?

1195
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,620
Iím not quite sure about that.

1196
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:34,620
Weíve had some producers and distributors come and talk to us about putting these on

1197
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:39,020
actual CDs and putting an online store on our site and that stuff may all be in the

1198
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:41,020
future as well.

1199
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:45,820
Right now, this is, like I said, this site's only been up for about a year, so that's just

1200
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:48,260
basically what we've been rolling out first.

1201
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:55,580
In terms of long-term industry, hard for me to say on that one, but I think the gaming

1202
01:15:55,580 --> 01:16:03,060
music is progressing so much as a whole that it will start getting as much clout or as

1203
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:06,440
much respect as movie scores as well.

1204
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,580
I definitely agree.

1205
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:10,980
It ought to be getting that same level of respect, and I hope it's coming for you guys

1206
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:11,980
soon.

1207
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:17,820
Now, one thing I have to ask, because we always ask folks here on Orange Lounge Radio, what

1208
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,140
other games have you been playing?

1209
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:22,640
What kind of video games have you been playing, besides Prey, Prey's Too Easy, what other

1210
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,700
kinds of video games have you been playing lately?

1211
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:31,700
Myself, I actually just bought an Xbox 360, because I was waiting for my standard Xbox

1212
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:35,740
to die out, and it finally just crashed way too many times for me to even handle.

1213
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:41,740
I was stuck playing FIFA 06 on my other Xbox, which actually, I've been addicted to that

1214
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:43,420
game for months now.

1215
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:50,180
Personally, I'm more of a sports game guy than a shooter kind of person.

1216
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:51,180
Alright.

1217
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,180
Awesome.

1218
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:55,020
Do you ever do gaming online?

1219
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,020
Do you go online and do any of that stuff?

1220
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,020
I haven't really got into that yet.

1221
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,700
I hope to get into that soon.

1222
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:04,220
I'm kind of waking up to that whole world of online gaming.

1223
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,220
Alright.

1224
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:08,720
Anyway, if our folks want to check that out, it's music from prey

1225
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:15,620
There's two soundtracks as well as the bite me music inspired by prey soundtrack. It's available on direct song calm Nick

1226
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:19,680
Thanks so much for joining us tonight on the show. We really appreciate it. Thank you very much

1227
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,980
Is there anything else you want to say?

1228
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,100
Nope, all right

1229
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:31,700
Sounds good. Thanks so much. Thank you. That's pretty cool. I know definitely the music in prey and

1230
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:35,140
and Elder Scrolls and all that kind of stuff is actually pretty sweet.

1231
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:40,180
Well, anyways, speaking of music, I know Microsoft's been trying

1232
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:43,860
to very eagerly keep this whole Zune

1233
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:47,660
thing kind of under wraps because of their surprises and how they're gonna

1234
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,180
basically take over the whole

1235
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:52,220
you know, music and portable markets.

1236
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:55,220
Well anyways, Microsoft exec,

1237
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:59,180
let's see, one of the top ones actually, he

1238
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:05,180
is basically dismissing the PlayStation 3 and the Wii launches as just pretty much

1239
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:09,900
who cares because we're gonna be, you know, launching with

1240
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:13,100
our brand new Zune and all that stuff and our system is just awesome.

1241
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:17,780
Anyways, it's just kinda interesting, um, reading this. This is actually being run on

1242
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:22,900
MCV Interactive Entertainment Weekly and they were talking about

1243
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:26,400
how because the PlayStation 3 price

1244
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:31,600
being so high and how that the Wii is basically not able to compete with them

1245
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,800
processor-wise and graphically that

1246
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,040
Microsoft doesn't really have anything to worry about as far as

1247
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,880
winning the next-gen console war

1248
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:46,480
which I think is a bit, I don't know, that's not a very good way to look at it.

1249
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,360
Maybe in this country.

1250
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:53,040
Yeah. But I don't know. I kinda said this a long time ago on the show. It's very

1251
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,280
interesting what this next-gen

1252
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:58,600
War is going to be on a worldwide scale, because Xbox is still struggling in Japan.

1253
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,160
Well, and I'm surprised that they don't look at it

1254
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,640
you know with like the success of Live, you know,

1255
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:10,120
it doesn't take great, you know, graphics and stuff to make an awesome game. Look at,

1256
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,040
you know,

1257
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,440
Geometry Wars. Look at the upcoming, you know,

1258
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:18,400
Castle Crashers or whatever that was. It's simple graphics

1259
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,680
and just fun gameplay. It doesn't need to be all...

1260
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,600
Yeah, seriously, one of the most anticipated titles, Street Fighter II.

1261
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,200
Street Fighter II, yeah, perfect example. I mean, it's just all about gameplay.

1262
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:32,680
But, you know, they were comparing the GameCube or the Wii, it's all...

1263
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,200
Although Wii is almost a GameCube with a DVD drive, Nintendo...

1264
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:40,080
Is Nintendo going to have enough quantity

1265
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,360
to satisfy the demand? They're talking about shortages. That's

1266
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,360
like the pot calling the kettle black, but whatever.

1267
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,600
But basically they said, you know, wait,

1268
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:58,380
They've got a lot of Q4 surprises coming, of course with the Zune and whatever they're

1269
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:04,600
going to be, possibly linking the Zune with the 360 and PC, Vista, etc.

1270
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:10,120
So it should be interesting, we'll have to wait and see though.

1271
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:14,440
Well there actually is a little bit more about a Nintendo game.

1272
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,440
Okay.

1273
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:20,840
Well, people by now know that we've had our little bit of excitement over Osutantakayo

1274
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:25,040
and on getting a US release as Elite Beat agents.

1275
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:29,760
Well there's a list released, a partial list I should say, of songs that might be in the

1276
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,760
game.

1277
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:31,760
Oh, cool.

1278
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,760
Mm-hmm.

1279
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:35,080
There's a stereogram, Walkie Talkie Man.

1280
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,920
This is by the way coming from Bimani style.

1281
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:37,920
Okay.

1282
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:44,120
Deep Purple, Highway Star, Eve Six, Inside Out, Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida Loca, Savage

1283
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:49,560
garden truly madly deeply hmm okay weird al yankovic hardware store that's that's cool

1284
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:54,680
i love weird al yankovic that's that's hardcore that's awesome lincoln park in the end okay just

1285
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:59,160
lost interest yeah that's that's the song that should be playing while you're playing like uh

1286
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,600
that's okay that's for the myspace kids that's fine what else

1287
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:11,800
no i was actually gonna say while you're playing r-type okay um offspring hit that uh queens of

1288
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,240
of the Stone Age go with the flow Kylie Minogue locomotion why can't they pick

1289
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:20,600
any of her new stuff interesting Guns N' Roses sweet child of mine I can dig

1290
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:27,960
that and Barenaked Ladies one week yeah spirits near in our chat room says lol

1291
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:33,760
emo tendo well there's also some new features that are gonna be in it there's

1292
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,280
a single card multiplayer now oh cool but there will still be multi-card

1293
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:43,560
multiplayer. You can also send the equivalent of the E3 demo which is walkie talkie man

1294
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:49,640
highway star and tutorial mode from the Japanese game by download play. Oh well that's kind of cool.

1295
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:54,840
There's two new scenarios. There's a young man trying to win the heart of his dream girl

1296
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,880
and a construction worker who's behind on a project and has one hour to

1297
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:04,040
finish it. The hardware store sounds like the song. Yeah sounds like yeah interesting. Well

1298
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,960
we'll see more I think was most it I'm sorry

1299
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,680
this gives me more incentive to import I was gonna say what's most interesting

1300
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:14,320
about that song list is it kinda really makes the Japanese one stand out like

1301
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,320
these are really two different games

1302
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:20,120
and for those who don't know what this game is essentially it's a rhythm game

1303
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:24,320
but you use tapping you tap in rhythm on the DS I know that sounds kinda hokey

1304
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,280
you also trace the line but you do like tracing it's

1305
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:31,480
yeah a lot like um what's that game with the spinny thing

1306
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:35,420
Um, Technic Beat? Technic Beat. Yeah. A little bit, yeah. Technic Beat.

1307
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:38,860
Yeah, that's a fair assessment. So, but it's

1308
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:43,940
Technic Beat kind of got old after a couple days. This one is funny, like the art style

1309
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:46,980
and everything really keeps you into it. So I hope it doesn't lose that flair.

1310
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:52,380
I hope they don't Americanize it too much. I just miss the... WENDON!

1311
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:56,540
Well anyways, speaking of music,

1312
01:22:56,540 --> 01:23:00,860
Luminous 2 is actually getting another song called Heavenly Star.

1313
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:04,780
and Tetsuya Mizuguchi and his team actually

1314
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:09,420
created the song. It's supposedly insanely catchy

1315
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:13,260
you know and also I'm gonna have a really awesome video to go

1316
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:19,180
with background which features an alien singer. I thought that was Hollaback Girl

1317
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:22,900
no I'm sorry. Incredibly catchy song with alien singer?

1318
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:29,960
A simply stunning video I don't think Hollaback Girl would follow on that

1319
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:37,680
But he says he was inspired by Take On Me with the video, so expecting Take On Me kind

1320
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,440
of video, which is kind of neat.

1321
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:45,160
Speaking of the game itself, they're saying it's going to have 100 new icons, which, big

1322
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,920
deal, and basically be the same damn gameplay.

1323
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:55,400
Additional 3D backgrounds and some videos, as well as puzzles and skin play, edit feature.

1324
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,760
Hmm, kind of neat.

1325
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:03,400
If there at any point is a reference to Luminous 2 going, this game is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S,

1326
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:12,240
I will have a video on YouTube of me smashing my PSP.

1327
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,680
Something else that sometimes makes me want to smash something is MySpace.

1328
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:21,040
By the way, join the Orange Lounge Radio MySpace, it's MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio,

1329
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:25,780
and Kotaku ran a very interesting observation earlier this week on their site, capturing

1330
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:31,420
a very interesting MySpace ad, and you guys can maybe see that ad here in studio a little

1331
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:32,420
bit.

1332
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:37,020
It's got, I guess, I don't know if that's a guy or a girl or something, whispering to

1333
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:41,020
a, you know, a hot chick, quote-unquote, and then there's another hot chick sitting there,

1334
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:46,020
so it's like, you know, everybody's dream of two chicks, I suppose, not my dream, whatever.

1335
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,020
I think those are two chicks about to make out.

1336
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,020
Is it?

1337
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,020
Okay, well, whatever.

1338
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:55,420
Well, the text on there says, Horny Gamer Girls Looking For Fun, and I'm wondering,

1339
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:58,920
Is this like targeted advertising by Myspace?

1340
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:02,900
Because I know whenever, you know, it's no real secret on this program, I'm gay, and

1341
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:07,240
whenever I log on to Myspace, that's all I ever get are gay personal sites.

1342
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:11,580
Like how many freaking times I could see these ad banners is incredible.

1343
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:14,800
Sadly, I will probably never see this one.

1344
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,960
Maybe I'll get a horny gamer guys, but I somehow doubt that, doesn't seem to be the...

1345
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,520
Is this an incentive for me to unblock ads?

1346
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,520
You know what?

1347
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,240
Myspace has some pretty funny ads, actually.

1348
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:32,240
I remember there was one for some movie and it said the movie was just like Napoleon Dynamite

1349
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:40,240
except they spelled Dynamite like DINOMITE like old school good times.

1350
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:45,240
It was spelled completely wrong and it was all over the site.

1351
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:53,240
I don't really know why we brought this up but I suppose gamers are being targeted in advertising on MySpace

1352
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:58,080
So keep an eye out for the ad just don't click on it because then that shows you support this and there'll be more

1353
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:02,360
And I said you want there to be more. I don't know I support hot, you know

1354
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:08,080
Gamer girls making out with each other. I support that fully gets my endorsement. But anyways

1355
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:17,080
Pig the other thing I support fully is violence in much violence now this this I can I

1356
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:22,080
I think all of OLR can agree on this one. Violence in games is wonderful.

1357
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,080
Violence is fantastic.

1358
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:35,080
But anyways, in Iowa State researchers have found violent gaming sessions can reduce the psychological response or physiological response of real life violence in the short term.

1359
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:42,080
term. But, I question this still. Anyways, going this further, they basically had a,

1360
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:49,920
you know, 257 college students and they were made to play, you know, certain games. And

1361
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:56,920
they were following like, with real life violence 20 minutes later. So they were showing them

1362
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,400
and seeing what their reactions were. The games they made them play though, well these

1363
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,380
are just a bit old I don't think it's a very good representation of games

1364
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:14,280
nowadays Carmageddon Duke Nukem 3d Mortal Kombat future cop which were on

1365
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:19,560
the violent side and I've never heard of these games glider pro 3d pinball 3d

1366
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:25,640
munch man and tetra mattes on the non-violent side I'm reminded somehow

1367
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:29,080
of that scene from a clockwork orange you remember that scene where they're

1368
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:34,240
forcing him to watch all the movies you know I for some reason this whole story

1369
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:37,360
reminds me of that because it's like they're shoving all these violent games

1370
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:43,320
down someone's throat but it's gonna you know they're gonna get used to they're

1371
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:47,880
gonna be numb to the imagery after a while but I I think it's not matter of

1372
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:54,000
violent games I think it's a matter of boring games and non boring games I mean

1373
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,400
say for example Carmageddon okay I'm sure that's much more exciting than 3d

1374
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:03,760
Munch Man or Glider Pro, a game which sounds like it's probably on a hang

1375
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,080
glider you're just flying around doing nothing. I'm sorry those games are boring

1376
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:12,320
you know whereas you know if I'm bored to death and all of a sudden someone shows me

1377
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:17,000
a shot of someone being shot point-blank I'm all whoa you know whereas you know

1378
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,000
if I'm kind of awake I might go wow that's kind of neat. But you know I'm not going to be just like

1379
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,240
oh my god that's really offensive because I've been playing Munch Man

1380
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:30,620
instead of, you know, oh my god, I destroyed, you know, giant mutant pigs.

1381
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:33,120
That does not offend me in any way.

1382
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,120
I don't know.

1383
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,120
I think it's kind of retarded.

1384
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,320
Wasn't Munch Man the name of the little guy on Square One TV?

1385
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,960
Math Man, never mind.

1386
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:45,240
Munch Man, I believe, is a knock-off of probably Pac-Man.

1387
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,200
Here's my thought.

1388
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:53,280
What if they did this exact same study, but instead replaced it with the nightly news,

1389
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:59,520
Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, any zombie B-movie flick from the 70s, I mean, wouldn't it all

1390
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,880
have the same effect?

1391
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:01,880
Yeah.

1392
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:08,000
So this study seems to be kind of, I don't know, like targeted to kind of blame games?

1393
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Like it's skewed.

1394
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Yeah.

1395
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,120
Like it seems like there needed to be a control here.

1396
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,120
I think so.

1397
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:18,240
Are games more desensitizing than the nightly news or than movies?

1398
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,600
That's the study I want to see.

1399
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,140
Show me a comparison.

1400
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:25,220
just throw these numbers at me you know what I mean

1401
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:28,380
that's my problem with it. Darkstalker do you have a thought on this at all?

1402
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:32,580
As far as the desensitization goes

1403
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:36,820
um there's already a lot of exposure

1404
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:42,020
honestly I mean it's like you take the child who grows up never able to watch

1405
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:45,540
the news never able to watch TV never able to play a video game

1406
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:49,420
and how are they when they grow up and see what the real world is like

1407
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:54,320
you know, go pretty nuts. And then you take one who may not have been allowed to play

1408
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:59,000
video games, but they watch the news with their parents, I think they'll be just as

1409
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,180
equally desensitized from it as someone who's an avid gamer.

1410
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:08,420
You know, I've been gaming for a long time now, and I believe you as well have been gaming

1411
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:12,280
a long time, and Matt, you as well have been gaming a long time, Andrew, also been gaming

1412
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:16,400
a long time. Do you feel that you're desensitized to violence?

1413
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:22,900
I've been desensitized to violence, but not from games. I think it was more from watching violent cartoons, violent anime, violent anything.

1414
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:28,400
It's not necessarily violence, it's just that we see this on TV every day, and you know, watching, you know,

1415
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:35,700
I'd say movies are worse than games, because so what in games you can control the action, big frickin' whoop.

1416
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:41,600
I can control the action on a DVD player too, I can rewind, I can freeze frame, it doesn't matter.

1417
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,600
The whole thing is, just like with Saw, for example, let's take Saw, that's a perfect example.

1418
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:57,600
You have, you know, a basic movie where someone is kidnapped and they have a giant device on their face with spikes in it that's gonna basically, you know, slam into them and kill them.

1419
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,600
Well, and they also show someone sawing off their foot.

1420
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:07,600
I think that's a lot more violent than, say, Duke Nukem 3D, which has pixelated graphics that look like a cartoon.

1421
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:12,640
Did anyone throw a fit when you know the Roadrunner, you know got Wile E. Coyote the fall off a cliff

1422
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:19,280
That's hundreds of hundreds of feet that he fell to his death. But oh sure he came back later on guess what?

1423
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:24,620
That's what happens when you shoot the pig it spawns later on so I don't see what the big deal is

1424
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,080
For me, um

1425
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:29,960
I've been gaming a long time

1426
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:32,800
I've played a lot of violent games and a lot of you know funny violent games

1427
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:39,200
Like I love Mortal Kombat but like real blood like my brain totally knows the difference between game movie and real life

1428
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:45,240
Because like I could watch somebody cut their cut their hand and they need stitches and I freak out like I'm like, oh my god

1429
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:51,320
It's real blood gross gross, you know, I get all freaked out, you know, I'm totally one of those I get you know

1430
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:56,320
I you drive by a horrific car accident and I'm gonna cry if I see a body, you know, like it's

1431
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:02,140
And even watching the news you see a lot of horrible stuff on the news and I just feel I feel depressed

1432
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:09,060
You know I my brain knows the difference between the two I can I can feel that you know reaction to real blood

1433
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:12,660
But then I can play a game, and I think it's funny because it's not real because yeah

1434
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,020
You're smart enough to know it's not real

1435
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:18,620
Well, I like the hell is wrong with people if they don't know what's real and don't know what's not real

1436
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:24,420
That's the bigger problem not being desensitized to violence being desensitized to what's reality. What's not reality

1437
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:28,540
That's the big problem right there, and I think if people are that retarded well

1438
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:32,540
Well, they need to be put in some sort of mental hospital because obviously they're

1439
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:34,620
not fit for society.

1440
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:35,620
True.

1441
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:38,560
No, no, no.

1442
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:45,100
I think that, again, this goes back to parental responsibility.

1443
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,580
It is their job.

1444
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:54,500
When they brought that life into the world, they had an unwritten contract that they would

1445
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:58,700
make sure that this entity would grow up to be a functional member of society

1446
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:02,560
that if they could not become a functional member of society they would

1447
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:07,760
help them seek the treatment they need and so therapist bull and not using if

1448
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:14,880
there's anything else might be causing the problem but you know I think that a

1449
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,120
good parent will pay attention to what their child you know I admit you know

1450
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:21,920
child is gonna be sneaky I was a sneaky kid you know they're not gonna be able

1451
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:27,500
able to be there 24-7, but if a parent takes an active interest in what their children

1452
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:33,580
are doing, participates in their life instead of dictates their life, you know what I mean?

1453
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:39,700
Then, um, we, I don't think there'll be as much of a, they don't have a right to blame

1454
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:46,020
a game when it's their responsibility for making sure that their child turns out how

1455
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:51,180
they feel is right and if they if they think that the game is going to

1456
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:54,700
desensitize them to violence later and want them to retain a feeling of

1457
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:59,000
sensitivity they need to limit how much their child's gonna play it I think

1458
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,520
that's the problem with human nature these days people are far more apt to

1459
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:07,900
blame other things other objects blame the TV blame a video game for what's

1460
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:13,300
really the problem you want your kid is just a maladjusted dick it's a it's a

1461
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:17,620
lack of accountability. I really think it's a lack of self-accountability. You have no

1462
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:23,840
one to blame for what goes on in your life but yourself and how you act on it.

1463
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,180
For example, here's another thing I think that's also the main problem with this study

1464
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:33,360
is the footage that is shown, the real-life footage, it basically was courtroom outbursts,

1465
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:40,260
police confrontations, shootings, and prison fights. Can you, I'm sorry, cops, the TV,

1466
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:45,360
stuff is out there all the time in any of your dramas like 24 I mean how many

1467
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:49,740
law and order police you know dramas out there right now this stuff is all over

1468
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:53,540
the place like and people aren't probably surprised about that because

1469
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:59,580
it's like yeah I've seen that before you know it's kind of like you know I don't

1470
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:06,460
know it's it's like a like a like Pamela Anderson naked I've seen that before

1471
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:11,980
for it's not surprising it's not like wow oh my god I was not expecting her to

1472
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:16,860
have breasts under there but it's just you know it's not surprising you're not

1473
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:22,020
gonna be and for example if you're like you know playing these boring ass

1474
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:26,180
knockoffs of games by the sound of the generic names that they have 3d munch

1475
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:30,260
man who you know if you're playing that then all of a sudden they show you no

1476
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:35,900
you know prison fight I'm like hell yes a lot better than 3d munch man I mean

1477
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:39,120
so I don't know what the hell they were expecting.

1478
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,940
All right, I gotta let our chat room have a say here

1479
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:43,740
over at orangelaunchradio.com, click on chat.

1480
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:46,120
Eddie of the OL Army says my mom played Halo

1481
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:49,320
for a few weeks with me when I first got my Xbox.

1482
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:50,360
Oh, that's cute.

1483
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,200
Good for your mom.

1484
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,520
Yeah, I know, you know the family that plays together

1485
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,840
is closer, I don't know, I don't know.

1486
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,820
That sounds almost dirty though, but that's not true.

1487
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:03,000
GK128 says there is a difference between violence

1488
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,140
in a video game and violence from say a real video

1489
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:08,100
where a dude is blown to bits from a torrent.

1490
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:10,500
That's gross, but true.

1491
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:14,140
Darth Tetsuya says Hello Kitty drove him to violence.

1492
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:16,460
Hello Kitty drives everyone to violence.

1493
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,580
Funnydale seems to think Munch Man was a knockoff

1494
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:21,620
of an 80s porn film, actually.

1495
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:24,540
Leave it to him to make the funny.

1496
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:27,080
All right, any other thoughts on this topic?

1497
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,940
We'd love to get your thoughts in our mailbag.

1498
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:31,220
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1499
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:33,020
If you want to send us some emails,

1500
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:36,060
Jamie's going to be digging into the mail back in our next segment.

1501
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:37,060
I sure will.

1502
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:38,060
Alright.

1503
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:41,020
I think this time I'm going to need like an extra thick hazmat suit this time.

1504
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:42,020
Alright.

1505
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:43,740
Maybe some asbestos gloves.

1506
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:44,900
Just one last thing.

1507
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:49,700
If they want to test whether people are desensitized to violence, you know, they don't need to

1508
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:53,980
show courtroom battles, cops, that kind of thing, like Loki said.

1509
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:57,780
Show us some pictures of some guy with his head blown off by a shotgun, you know, stuff

1510
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:59,260
you would see on shock sites.

1511
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:00,260
Yeah.

1512
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:03,000
that will test your sensitivity to violence.

1513
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,960
The courtroom battle made me think of Phoenix Wright, sorry.

1514
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:10,160
Objection! Exactly, people don't need to see that. I've seen pictures of people eating babies.

1515
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,960
I mean that's pretty disturbing, so...

1516
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:15,380
courtroom, or like

1517
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:19,360
outbursts in a courtroom. I've never seen that in a movie before.

1518
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:25,480
Cops, oh my god, never seen Cops before. I object to where the show is headed so I

1519
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,260
think it's time that we have a break.

1520
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:30,260
Speaking of violence real quick, though, I need to get this out here.

1521
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:35,260
If you don't listen to the rebroadcast of Orange Lounge Radio over on AllGames.com,

1522
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:37,260
there will be violence.

1523
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:40,260
Yeah, we'll poke you in the nose and call you a poopy head.

1524
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:43,260
And, by the way, we're moving times over there.

1525
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:45,260
There have been some schedule changes over at AllGames,

1526
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:47,260
and you East Coasters are going to love this.

1527
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:51,260
The show is now Mondays at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time,

1528
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:53,260
which would be 8 o'clock for you East Coasters.

1529
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:55,260
So if we're making you stay up too late on a Sunday,

1530
01:37:55,260 --> 01:38:01,140
You can always listen to the show in its entirety, parts A and B, over on allgames.com on Monday

1531
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:02,140
nights.

1532
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:05,500
And that's right after the big live show they do, All Games Interactive, which is taped

1533
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:11,740
live at the Arena Interactive Lounge, home of the E3 Outpost, and I don't know what's

1534
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,220
going to happen with that next year.

1535
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:16,340
We'll see in light of what we've talked about earlier in this segment.

1536
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:18,500
Alright, so let's go to a break.

1537
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,540
We'll be back a little later with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
