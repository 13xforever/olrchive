00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,800
Tonight, July 16th, 2006, Target pulls UMDs from shelves, new rumors are floating around

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:29,840
about the Wii controller, and is Konami planning to directly compete with Guitar Hero?

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,600
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,500
This is episode number 191 for this July the 16th of 2006, but if you can't listen live

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,920

8
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
You might know me as Sky.

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:07,580
as always say hello to Loki yes I'm here yes he's here Dark Sakura is coming

11
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,400
she's just running late tonight she was in the Bay Area this weekend doing

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,380
something and she's running a little late but she says she will be here in

13
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,900
time for part B and she might even make it to the show depending on how long we

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,420
run during part a I told her whenever she gets here just barge on in and say

15
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,540
hello so we'll be looking forward to hearing from her very sure you didn't

16
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,380
to tell her to do that she'll just kick the door down i'm here uh anyway we'll see the traffic was

17
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,380
horrible okay yeah what do you want to bet when she gets here there's going to be some type of

18
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,220
rant about the traffic but i already know there was an accident she told me she told me part of

19
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,140
the reason she wasn't here is that there's an accident that on one of the highways that kept

20
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,540
her excellent she'll be bright and cheery all right bright good we'll try to we'll try to time

21
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,940
the fus of the week in time for her arrival but i don't know we gotta we gotta plan we gotta stick

22
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,940
Anyway, we do have the one and only Miklotov filling in again.

23
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,940
You never leave.

24
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,940
I try not to.

25
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,940
Alright, but Miklotov has something very important he's going to say tonight.

26
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,940
It's somewhat.

27
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,940
It's probably about women.

28
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,940
Alright, anyway.

29
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,940
Yeah, actually when DarkSakura gets here, maybe her and Miklotov will have a fight.

30
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,940
That would be pretty cool. Maybe there will be hair pulling and all that good stuff.

31
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,940
Alright, anyway, we do like to talk about video games here on Orange Lounge Radio.

32
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,660
Radio, and we like to start it off always by talking about our gaming week.

33
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,860
So, Loki, why don't you go ahead and start us off tonight with how was your gaming week?

34
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:33,820
It was okay, I got two new games, got of course ChromeHounds and Prey, and I haven't played

35
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,760
much of Prey, I've played a little bit of ChromeHounds, basically you have to go through

36
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,100
all the training missions, as you would call them, and they have it split up into like

37
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,020
six different sections for each type of class you want to do.

38
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,940
And you unlock parts that way because basically if you want to build a mech you got to play

39
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,400
through the whole single player game in order to get some good parts.

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,300
And so I've been playing that and playing a lot of Ridge Racer.

41
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,840
I'm kind of done with that game because when you finish the races and you have a harder

42
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,260
set of races then you have an even harder set of races and it just keeps going and going

43
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,260
and going.

44
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,800
like that with the the PSP version I played it up through like the pro

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,200
section that's like I'm done this game it's all the same damn shit all over and

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,840
over again and Ridge Racer 6 is no different and that's another reason why

47
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,600
I will not be buying Ridge Racer 2 when that comes out for the PSP it's just

48
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,760
gonna be same damn shit all over again. That's so weird to me that you already

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,160
have Ridge Racer 6 yet they're gonna go back and do Ridge Racer 2 I know it's

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,240
like different. It's Ridge Racer PSP 2. I know it's different but it's still just kind of

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,140
of weird when you talk about it.

52
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,620
Well, the thing that sucks about it though is that they have all the same tracks.

53
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,040
Like the PSP one had a lot of the tracks from all Ridge Racer 5 and back, and so I had played

54
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,960
a lot of them in Ridge Racer 4 because R4 was awesome, but I'm like, oh yeah, I remember

55
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,680
this track, so you know how to race it already, and the drifting is just completely wrong

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
anyways.

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,560
And I played...

58
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
I'm done with the game.

59
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,920
just need to sell it before it drops price again and just get rid of it so I can buy

60
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:26,600
more games in August. The other game I played was Xor, and basically this is a Japanese

61
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,840
only Xbox 360 game but doing a nifty little region trick you can download a demo that's

62
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,640
on the live marketplace right now. It's an interesting game, reminds me a bit of Zone

63
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,440
of vendors just the way the combat system is. It is kind of neat though because you

64
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,440
use the right analog to kind of switch targets to which one you want to fire against. And

65
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,880
then basically you have your normal shot and charged shots and then this kind of like special

66
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,880
attack which is just more charged shots. It's neat. I wouldn't buy it but it's kind of neat.

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,680
Play a little bit of Frogger and what can I say Frogger is Frogger. And yeah I think

68
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,340
that was I'm still playing through blazing angels you know the games now

69
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,620
to the point where I just want to be over I love how every week you come like

70
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,380
for the past four or five weeks and I've come on the show I've been playing

71
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,220
blazing angels this week I hate it yet it's been like the past five weeks you

72
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,460
haven't stopped playing it I have to play the game throw away the last

73
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,500
achievement man last achievement true points horror true points horror well I

74
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,380
have to and the fact that they make these different modes like arcade mode

75
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,940
mode, and the mini campaign mode, and the campaign mode, they're all the same, all the

76
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,940
same.

77
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,660
The only difference between the arcade mode and like say the mini campaign mode, mini

78
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,620
campaign mode, you fight 20 planes, that's it.

79
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,880
In the arcade mode you fight 3 waves of 12 planes, and that's give or take because it's

80
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,600
really been kind of glitchy, like I'll shoot the first 4 planes in a wave or something

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,580
really quick, and the second wave will start, yet for some reason more planes will come,

82
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,900
And those planes don't count towards my, you know, amount because they're still the same

83
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,140
planes from the first wave.

84
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,540
It gets confused sometimes.

85
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,740
I also need to introduce our other guests we always have every week here on the program,

86
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,900
our chat room over at orangeloungeradio.com, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat if

87
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,560
you are listening live on Sunday, come on over and join in the fun and we read your

88
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,220
comments throughout the show.

89
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,120
In fact, Eddie was responding in our chat room to something Loki was saying earlier

90
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,580
when he was making fun of Jamie for always bitching about traffic, saying that, Loki

91
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,760
rants about traffic too so you know that's that's true I do remember your

92
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,100
past few I've used the week have been about traffic so I think you just got

93
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,260
pwned okay let's see oh here we go you will bow to me once know exactly how

94
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,820
many achievement points do you have these a lot we always call you an

95
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,440
achievement points horror but you really don't have that many I don't I some

96
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,660
people I just don't have enough time to play stuff but I don't you break like

97
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,620
3,000 yeah okay but that's a lot I only have like 12 it's mainly well it's

98
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,760
mainly I'm just trying to like, what I try to do is I sit down with a game that you know

99
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:10,760
I want to get rid of like you know Ridge Racer or, what was it, Blazing Angels and I just

100
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,060
play it and play it and play it and play it until I finally get all the achievement points

101
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:20,520
and then I go and sell it. And my game after Ridge Racer and Blazing Angels, the next one

102
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,500
is going to be Rumble Roses XX because that game was lame. Luckily though, Blazing Angels

103
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,780
and Rumpelroses I did not pay for. I got those free

104
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,260
from Konami and Ubisoft. Yeah, they were really

105
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,900
thankful to give those away but

106
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,020
Ridge Racer did spend money on and to be honest, you know, Ridge Racer is fun.

107
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,860
It's fun but it was okay. I think there's better racers on

108
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,580
360 right now but I had fun with it. It's a fun game. As a more traditional racer that's not

109
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,080
like blow shit up it's pretty good. I would like to see the next burnout

110
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,340
you know something that's made from scratch and not a port

111
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,660
I think that'd be better. Or maybe, I don't know, this is a good arcade racing game

112
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,220
is what we need out there. Alright, anything else you've been playing this week?

113
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,820
I think that's it. Uh, Grand Theft Auto, of course. Always.

114
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,180
Um, my gaming week was, well I've been doing a little bit traveling again, so

115
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,260
you know, I was in LA the first part of the week and I was in

116
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,060
um, hello, Reno yesterday, thank you.

117
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,540
Been a long week, what can I say, but I have had a little bit of time in there to play some other games.

118
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,520
I checked out Frogger on Xbox Live Arcade, I mean, hell, it was five bucks and I wanted

119
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,380
something new, so I was kind of a sucker, I got it.

120
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,020
And it was actually a lot better than I expected.

121
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,440
I was expecting it to just be a straight arcade port with not a lot of extra frills, but I

122
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,660
think it's kind of cool that they have some extra stuff, like they did enhance the graphics

123
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,740
for whatever it's worth, I mean, it's nothing to scream about.

124
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,220
It looks like they enhanced it from the Atari 2600 style graphics that it used to be, well

125
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,660
Well actually, I'll give it more of a credit, more like NES style graphics, they souped

126
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:03,300
it up to like, Super NES style graphics, so it's still not that great, but you know, it's

127
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
alright.

128
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,740
But the game, you know, it's amazingly simple and will entertain you for a little bit.

129
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,820
I do like the fact they have co-op modes in there and some other multiplayer modes, except

130
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,020
I only played one co-op game, but it was laggy as hell.

131
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,300
I mean, it was to the point where, you know, you would press the button to hop and it would

132
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,940
take a minute before the guy would actually hop and in Frogger you know

133
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,900
timing is a lot so that would really screw you up

134
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,220
I don't understand since in co-op you're not really going head to head it's like

135
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,180
both people

136
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,260
are playing on opposite sides working to one score

137
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,100
I don't see why they just couldn't have it running and then the other side kinda

138
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,940
catches up

139
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,300
I don't know I just would have done it differently maybe I maybe I miss

140
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,660
something I don't know but

141
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,380
it did to be honest that's not that great a co-op

142
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,120
I mean it's just two people playing at the same time working towards one score, you're

143
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,480
not even playing on the same playing field.

144
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,960
It's opposite play fields and it just splits the screen in two, so it's kind of weird.

145
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,560
So I guess, you know, for five bucks though, you know, you can't expect a lot and to be

146
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,280
honest it's better than the cell phone version which I think runs just as much, so why not

147
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,000
go and get this if you are interested in all and some retro-ness there.

148
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's cheap five dollars.

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,060
The other game I played, I checked out the Prey demo on Xbox Live Arcade, of course there

150
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,320
was a lot of this talk about, oh the demo was delayed and dah dah dah, I wasn't really

151
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,080
following all that because this wasn't a game I was super excited about because I don't

152
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,000
really get into first person shooter games a whole lot.

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,220
But Prey was kind of neat.

154
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,820
I think I liked it as well when it was called Doom 3, no I'm kidding, it's definitely on

155
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,820
a...

156
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,340
More like I liked it better when it was called Duke Nukem 3.

157
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,580
This is very obvious so there's a lot in common with the Doom 3 interface, and to be honest

158
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,460
I haven't done my research on the game, I'm not sure if they use the Doom 3 interface.

159
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,140
That's not a surprise at all, honestly, I can tell.

160
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,900
You instead of having a flashlight, you have a lighter.

161
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,900
But you do have the gravity stuff, which is kind of cool, like you can walk up these ramps

162
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,660
and go upside down and stuff.

163
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,980
But the problem is that I have a hard enough time conceptualizing 3D space.

164
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,260
I don't know if it's just me having been an old school gamer since Atari 2600 days that

165
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,780
when everything started moving into 3D I had a hard time sometimes conceptualizing 3D space

166
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:27,480
like levels and things and so to be able to run upside down and up walls and stuff is

167
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,960
even more confusing to me and trying to figure out how the levels laid out but I mean it's

168
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,020
okay the game control is pretty good I didn't play multiplayer I only played single player

169
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,420
I did think to the game's credit I thought the setup was really good and the drama in

170
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,980
the opening parts of the game were done very well and very seamlessly and I

171
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,380
thought it was kind of cool like you could really put yourself right in the

172
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,620
action but yet it's a first-person shooter now granted Doom 3 did the same

173
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,620
thing kind of at the beginning but I think Prey kind of improved on that so I

174
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,560
like this I wish I could have gotten far enough into the demo where I are into

175
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,900
the game really from the demo or I could see more of the story and how it plays

176
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,620
out but I do really like that you don't have cutscenes in this game really it's

177
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,980
just it's all done within the engine I think that's very cool so you know you

178
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,620
can definitely tell how far technologies come when you when you don't have much

179
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,780
of a need for cutscenes anymore I remember playing pre-demo and all I did

180
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,220
was I walked up to the little machine one of the arcade machines in there and

181
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,580
it was like a pac-man demo and I played that going over to the chat room looking

182
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,780
at some questions there.

183
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:41,020
Ubuntu Maniac 64 says, Sky would die playing F-Zero X and GX then because of all the ramps

184
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,020
and upside down.

185
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,780
No, actually, I really, really, really enjoyed F-Zero on the GameCube.

186
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,260
I was a little annoyed with the arcade version because it only had six tracks.

187
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,560
But otherwise, I thought the game was magnificent and I wish they'd done more with the arcade.

188
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,800
I think the arcade and home link-up was six.

189
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,680
The arcade and home link-up was a brilliant idea and it needed to be expanded on.

190
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,840
No, actually in a racing game it doesn't bother me so much, I mean, granted you go upside

191
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,440
down in ramps, but there's still really only one path or branching paths in a racing game,

192
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
you know, it's not that complicated.

193
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,800
You don't have these, like, this, you know, teleportation bullshit, you know, or, you

194
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
know, the...

195
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
I'm not...

196
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Yeah.

197
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm not...

198
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,520
Yeah, I'm not totally incompetent when it comes to, you know, visualizing 3D, okay,

199
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,120
give me a little credit, but I'm telling you Prey really pushes the envelope, yeah, because

200
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,700
you go through portals, like suddenly this box will now be a portal into another place

201
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,760
in the level and it's like, okay I'm going across, and I have no map, I don't, you probably

202
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,340
can bring it up easily but I didn't even figure out how to bring up a map in the demo, and

203
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,640
usually, and somebody else had commented, have I ever played Descent, it looks like

204
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,880
23Magus was asking have I ever played Descent, actually yes, and I actually really enjoyed

205
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,940
Descent, but Descent also had a map button that I would press like every five seconds

206
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,100
to see where I am, that's why I like games with Minnie Mouse.

207
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,140
Hated Descent, hated that game.

208
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,780
I actually kind of enjoyed Descent, but see you know what 3D game really just was Metroid

209
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,140
and a lot of people really into Metroid Prime

210
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,500
and for some reason the little levels, the head to head levels are cool but like

211
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,060
those big massive Metroid levels

212
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,180
especially in the first it's just too much

213
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,000
I don't know

214
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,100
and just the fact that it wasn't Metroid to me I mean I

215
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,520
remember Super Metroid and it's one of the best video games ever made

216
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,720
So I was mentioning in the chatroom that the Saints Row demo is out on the Xbox magazine.

217
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Oh really?

218
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,080
I haven't got my new issue yet.

219
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,040
I don't remember if I've run out of issues or not.

220
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,560
I can't remember when I subscribed to that.

221
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,560
But I know the last few demo discs that they've had on there have been crap.

222
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,720
It's been just like, you know, demos that have been on live forever.

223
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,620
Like I think one of the months was Call of Duty 2, Quake 4, and Condemned or something

224
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,620
like that.

225
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,460
Wow, these were awesome back in November.

226
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:55,780
Well anyway, as far as Prey goes, I'm going to withhold making a real judgement call on

227
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,300
the game until I can play the full version and get a little hands-on multiplayer, but

228
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,580
you know what can I say, I love the fact that you can download demos for free and judge

229
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,460
for yourself if you like the game or not.

230
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,580
So what do you need me to review this game for you for?

231
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
Go download the demo and see for yourself.

232
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,380
If you like shooters, if you like Doom 3, I think you'll like Prey.

233
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,620
Here's my major bitch on this game.

234
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,260
No split-screen multiplayer.

235
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,280
Now I understand that's not a big deal for some people that do the LAN parties and stuff

236
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,220
like that, but when I'm playing at work, or playing at home, and I have some friends over

237
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,820
and we want to bust out this game, we can't do that.

238
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,160
You cannot play split screen multiplayer on there.

239
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:40,020
So that kind of sucks, but they do have, like I said, the link mode and they also have over

240
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,020
live.

241
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,740
I don't know, that's why I like Call of Duty 2, because you can split up 4 screens.

242
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,140
You know, yeah, the screens may be small, but so what?

243
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,900
It's still fun, and I'd rather have that, but yeah, it wouldn't be able to work.

244
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,060
Jaded2006 in our chat says, Pray is a LAN party game.

245
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,060
It's not meant for split screen multiplayer.

246
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,060
Tough!

247
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,540
I want split screen multiplayer!

248
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,180
Alright, I will make the decision, I'm glad that they have that mode in there, but I will

249
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,460
make the decision whether I want to use it or not.

250
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,180
If I really want to keep, you know, a really tiny ass little section of the screen for

251
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:17,840
my view, that's fine, you know, but I don't have, you know, four Xbox 360s and four high

252
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,340
def TVs that I can, you know, share with my friends.

253
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,020
Alright, let's keep it moving, because we want to get to the news here.

254
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,460
Miklotov, how was your gaming week?

255
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,900
I played World of Warcraft, and that was just this weekend.

256
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,900
That's about it.

257
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,180
Yeah, but when you say you played World of Warcraft this weekend, you played all weekend,

258
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,180
right?

259
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,820
Yeah, I played, it was Warsong Honor this week, so, or Double Warsong Honor, so I had

260
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,980
keep playing and playing and playing now what do you get for racking up a bunch

261
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,980
of points in the pvp war song goal i don't know

262
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,740
i just want to keep playing i just know i have to do it is it like an internet

263
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,620
penis thing like you want to have the big title in front of your names that

264
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,620
you're special or what no but i like seeing the bar fill up for

265
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,300
each little um thing i become honored or friendly

266
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,940
with okay serious question though how many hours would you say this weekend

267
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,740
alone did you play war song gold holy crap um

268
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,140
total 12 wow

269
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,300
it was really fun though because I kept owning people

270
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,780
sadly enough I think I know probably people that are more addicted to World

271
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,780
Warcraft than that

272
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,100
I'm not addicted, I just like to have my little bursts

273
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,660
I was in Reno randomly yesterday as I mentioned before and

274
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,620
we were at a restaurant at Circus Circus kinda later in the evening

275
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,600
and this guy was very very drunk and with his very very drunk girlfriend was

276
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,820
trying to start a conversation with us you know how like there's some drunkies

277
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,040
that'll do that, like try to start a conversation with strangers.

278
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Yeah they're stupid.

279
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,320
And there's a right way to start a conversation with strangers, and there's a wrong way to

280
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
do it like,

281
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Hey!

282
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Hey!

283
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
How ya doin' dude?

284
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Hey guy!

285
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
That's how he sounded too.

286
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,800
He sounded like Animal from The Muppets.

287
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,400
Hey guy!

288
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,020
And he actually said, I'm a WoW player!

289
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,520
And I'm like, you're a WoW, you're retarded.

290
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,620
Yeah, I'm like me too.

291
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,560
But then he tried to tell me, he's like, yeah man, I like EverQuest on the PlayStation 2,

292
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,720
to run it and you have to play a watered-down version.

293
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,760
Wow, I never knew that!

294
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,640
Oh, is this EverQuest 2? Because I was going to say, you can't really water down EverQuest 1.

295
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,480
Yeah, you can. You can open up Microsoft Paint

296
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,520
and just draw things there and it looks almost as good.

297
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,440
Alright, anything else you've been playing this week, Mikaela?

298
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,760
Well, I've been kind of sick and while I was waiting for

299
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,400
Warsong Gulch to queue up, I just play a lot of Uwendan

300
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,500
and Koth on the screen.

301
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,060
It was pretty terrible. Please tell me that's not my screen.

302
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,980
My DS Lite screen. And know what else he played?

303
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,500
He forgot to mention that.

304
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,680
What did I play?

305
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,540
In the Groove 2.

306
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,260
Oh yeah, I played In the Groove 2. Oh yeah, I forgot. We were all at the Arcana Pro.

307
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,220
I played In the Groove 2, too. I don't...

308
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,260
I did not touch In the Groove 2, other than to step on the panels, which,

309
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,200
by the way, the dance pad used to be a Max 2, therefore it is still kosher.

310
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,940
You know, it's like...

311
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,740
it's like pre-op, okay?

312
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,340
But it's still, you know, it's still DDR, it's just got stickers on it, you know, but...

313
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,380
I hate In the Groove and all, but they did get a couple really good songs, and so, and

314
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,100
the steps were fun for those songs.

315
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,460
I won't touch like 98% of that game, but there are like three songs that I'll play.

316
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,780
Yeah, and here's the thing, is that Miklotov, not only will he play those same three songs

317
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,300
over and over, but then he'll like stand by the machine and try to get everybody else

318
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
to play the same damn song.

319
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,300
He's like, play this, play this, I'm like, no, goddammit, I want to find my own song

320
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,300
to play.

321
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,300
But you didn't want to find your own song.

322
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Cuz you'll pick a crappy

323
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,260
I was going through all the songs listening to clip see if there's anything I wanted to play in there really wasn't a whole lot

324
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,260
But to be fair

325
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:21,100
To be fair. I didn't know the songs there's like three song when I you know what but when I did DDR Supernova the first

326
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,620
Time I did that too. I went through the whole thing

327
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,180
I'm like, I don't really know if I want to play. I don't know if I wanna play a play tierra buena

328
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,700
It's the best. All right, forget it. Anyway, let's

329
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,700
We did play Q's are in that was awesome. Sure. It was awesome

330
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,420
Except not.

331
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,420
Let's get into tonight.

332
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,340
Shout out to LazerQuest back in Wichita for being better.

333
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,540
Oh, LazerQuest sucks.

334
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,340
Alright, can we get into the news tonight please?

335
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,780
Thank you.

336
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,620
Start off with a little PSP news, but unfortunately this might be a bit of bad news for some of

337
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,960
you PSP fans.

338
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,620
Target stores have recently pulled the UMD movies.

339
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,980
GamePro recently got a scoop that UMDs are now being discontinued in all Target stores

340
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,620
this as of last week.

341
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:08,620
You know what though? Honestly, UMDs, $10 more expensive than a DVD, yet less extras.

342
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,180
It never really made sense to me. I mean, sure you can do it on the go, but you can

343
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:18,200
also get a DVD player for on the go. You know, I think I own like one UMD movie and that's

344
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
it.

345
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,700
I still want the Silent Hill one, the Silent Hill experience, but that's about it.

346
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Now that is a better idea.

347
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
That's not totally a movie though.

348
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,860
Yeah, that's a much better idea because that's more like interactive, you know.

349
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,500
the Metal Gear comic that came out. Exactly, that's where things should be headed.

350
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,000
It sounds like we'll be headed, but we'll see. The thing, I think what's kind of funny

351
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,540
about the whole Target and pulling the UMD thing is, who cares, because Target didn't

352
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,480
really have a selection of UMDs in the first place, and the second thing is, kind of, Sony

353
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,460
is pushing this brand new, like, one gig memory stick with movies already on there.

354
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,980
Oh, so you think maybe it's a matter of Sony might go to this digital distribution thing

355
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:01,020
I only want to do digital distribution for everything because they're a little sad that

356
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,300
their UMD format didn't take off, which the only thing I did think was pretty good about

357
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,400
it is the fact that it's covered in a plastic case and you can't really scratch this thing

358
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,020
unless you really try.

359
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
Which is good.

360
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,980
I think that's how they should have done BluRay or something like that and have it in an old

361
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,980
style...

362
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,640
That's probably why they're more expensive though.

363
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,540
This is a plastic case.

364
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,540
They're not more expensive actually.

365
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,540
It's just...

366
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,540
They'll charge for everything.

367
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:45,140
Whatever. It's still, though, I think that was a pretty cool idea, just because, you know, it's good for the rental market, but the whole packaging of UMD with, and by the way, these aren't exactly my favorite picks of movies, like was it Hitch, Triple X, um, god, and there was, like, Stealth, and something else.

368
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,380
They just won't let Stealth die.

369
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,220
Stealth was a bad movie.

370
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,720
I'm going to a chat room, orangeonstrategy.com, and

371
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,660
Maury says, I'm amazed they didn't drop them earlier, referring to the UMDs.

372
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,360
Because they're stubborn. You know, I want their stuff to work. You bring up a good point though

373
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,300
about the digital distribution here. You know,

374
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,440
everybody kind of is assuming, and you know, it would make logical sense that

375
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,360
Apple, with their video iPods, are going to get into movie distribution by the

376
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,200
end of the year. Like,

377
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,520
that'll be the way that they sell iPods this Christmas, is that video iPods will

378
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,280
come out with a little larger of a screen,

379
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,920
and they're gonna sell movies through the iTunes Music Store.

380
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,260
In fact, it's already somewhat been confirmed because I believe there's

381
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,840
been news reports about

382
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,240
Apple trying to negotiate with the movie companies and they want to do...

383
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,600
they don't want a flat rate for all the movies. They want varying,

384
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,500
you know, depending on how new the movie is and all that stuff. So maybe Sony's just

385
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,080
trying to beat them to the punch a little bit.

386
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,560
I mean, hypothetically, Sony could set up like a PSP store

387
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,840
to download movies on your stick and that would be kinda interesting

388
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,200
if they could beat Apple to it I don't think it would be enough

389
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,920
you know I you don't think of a lot of people don't think

390
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,920
of you know a gamer might be different but the

391
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,760
the normal average person probably doesn't think of hey if I'm gonna go

392
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,120
listen to music on the go

393
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,120
I'm gonna use my PSP I think the general public still views the PSP as a gaming

394
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,860
system

395
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,720
it's yeah basically is a gaming system it's a gaming system that can also view

396
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,880
movies if I want it's like

397
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,060
if I'm tired of playing a game I can pop in a movie but to be honest

398
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:19,460
I don't wanna sit for like 3 hours or 2 hours in front of my PSP trying to watch a movie.

399
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
It's not fun.

400
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:26,180
And even like the Spiderman 2 UMD that was in there with the PSP, I just don't care.

401
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,060
I think it's lame, I don't know.

402
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,780
But whatever.

403
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,100
Speaking of things being pulled, Sony has actually pulled their PSP ad campaign in the

404
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
Netherlands.

405
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,220
The one that's been getting people all pissed off with the fact that it's got black and

406
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,740
white people in it, oh my god, and there's got to be something racial about it.

407
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,140
Well apparently, you know, all the bitching and moaning by the US, which is stupid because

408
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:56,380
they shouldn't have even been getting in this business anyways, it's a different country,

409
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:02,860
but they pulled it anyways, and basically, yeah, the campaign's gone.

410
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,260
Thank you people in the United States and other places that were complaining about stuff

411
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,700
that's not even going to be visible in your country.

412
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,220
Well, we talked about this a little bit more in depth last week, so if you want to hear

413
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,860
our thoughts on this controversial issue, go download last week's show, episode 190.

414
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,260
But we invited you guys in our voicemail of the week segment to leave your thoughts on

415
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,640
what you thought about the whole controversy behind what was going on.

416
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,620
So I thought we could play a couple voicemails.

417
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,420
Some of you guys left some really good points, but your voicemails were really, really long.

418
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,700
We didn't have quite enough time to play them.

419
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,020
But I enjoyed listening to them, and I will share them with Dark Soccer and Loki later

420
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,600
But I'm gonna play two kind of short feedback ones that I thought were pretty good here in our voicemails of the week

421
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,340
Here's voicemail number one

422
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:52,900
Hey, this is Mac man, and in response to your question of course Sony isn't of course

423
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,120
Sony isn't racist. They're just risky

424
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:02,520
Remember the 10 years of passion sign or the take a jumping take a running jump here on the subway sign

425
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,800
They've done this before, except this time it involved two women of different color trying

426
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,360
to kill each other.

427
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,560
Sony got us, but the important part is, Sony got us to talk about the white PSP, didn't

428
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
they?

429
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,940
See you on the flip side, Mac Man.

430
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,720
Very interesting because he says there that, yeah, it got everybody to talk about the white

431
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
PSP, didn't it?

432
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Here's the point.

433
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,560
And Sony kind of has this history of doing these pushing the envelope ads.

434
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,060
What they really need to focus on was, and I think a lot of people miss this, it wasn't

435
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,540
white and black.

436
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,360
It wasn't these two people fighting each other.

437
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,540
It was chick fight.

438
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,820
It was a chick fight.

439
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,560
And nothing brings out a crowd of people like a good chick fight.

440
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,500
Like a drunken chick ball, just right outside of a bar, just beating each other up.

441
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,100
That sells PSPs.

442
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,880
But unfortunately, you know, everyone had to bring color into it.

443
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,840
But it's all about cat fights.

444
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,560
So it's just a good old-fashioned cat fight.

445
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
It's a good old-fashioned cat fight.

446
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:06,680
And to be honest, I think the whole ad campaign was a bit skewed anyways because they did

447
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,200
have like 100 different images, and of course the one where it shows the white person beating

448
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
up on the black person.

449
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Oh my god!

450
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Racist!

451
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,520
But, you know, when it's the black person beating up on the white person, it's just...

452
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,160
Oh my god, LA!

453
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Let's do another.

454
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,920
This is our last voicemail.

455
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,280
Just a couple short ones this week.

456
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Let's hear this next voicemail.

457
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,560
Hi there, this is Apollo from Nashville, Tennessee.

458
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,140
I'm just giving my thoughts on the whole Sony billboard ad thingamajig.

459
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,280
I just wanted to say that I think, since Sony's a worldwide company and they've got their

460
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,720
hands all over the world, I think that they're perfectly aware that race is still a very

461
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,920
controversial topic in many places, and I kind of think that they should be more cautious

462
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,780
to make sure that they're not releasing advertisements that are obvious targets for criticism.

463
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,500
I guess regardless, it did get released, so I don't know.

464
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,900
I don't think their message was that white is better than black, and I don't think that's

465
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,140
what they intended to think, and I don't think they wanted to say that white people are better

466
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,140
than black people.

467
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,380
So I think it's kind of ridiculous that people are making a huge deal out of it, but at the

468
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,220
same time, Sophie should have been watching for it.

469
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,540
But anyway, that's just all I wanted to say.

470
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,380
Love you guys' show, and I hope you hear from me too.

471
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,380
Bye.

472
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,380
Thanks for the voicemail.

473
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,380
It was very nice.

474
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:26,380
I like how that person says that Sony kind of knew what they were doing in a way, like

475
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:31,180
using the race would probably come up, but the fact that maybe it wasn't necessarily

476
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,420
they were trying to say that white is better than black, and I don't think anybody really,

477
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,860
I don't know, maybe some of these congressmen feel that that's what they were trying to

478
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,980
say, but I don't think that's what they were trying to say, especially when you see all

479
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:45,380
of the ad campaign, but maybe we're just trying to use the contrast, I guess was their big

480
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,380
thing.

481
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,020
especially in hearing about some of these other ads, it was just about showing different

482
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:56,540
types of contrast, and certainly that was a contrasting image, but it also polarized

483
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,420
the community in many different ways.

484
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,420
Any final thoughts on this issue?

485
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,420
I don't know.

486
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:07,140
I think the whole issue is stupid to begin with, but then again, Sony is known for stupid

487
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,060
ad campaigns sometimes, but so is Microsoft though.

488
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,060
I don't know.

489
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,900
I think people that are advertising for video game systems really need to simplify things.

490
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
Do what Nintendo does.

491
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,980
I mean, at least theirs, you know, they show the games and, you know, here's what's on

492
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:27,860
the DS Lite, check it out, you know, and then people buy the DS Lite or buy, you know, whatever.

493
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,980
Except no one bought the GameCube for that, I don't know, whatever ad campaign they were

494
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,580
doing for the GameCube just didn't work.

495
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:40,460
Alright, now if you'd like to leave us a voicemail, our phone number is 916-226-9067, but please

496
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,380
remember if you don't pay the phone bill, please ask whoever does their permission before

497
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,620
you call in because that's not an 800 number, it's not a toll-free call.

498
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,440
Or you can always call us on Skype, username OrangeLawnsRadio, when we are not live.

499
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,820
That way you get our voicemail.

500
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,380
It was just like the whole Xbox 360 advertising campaign jump in.

501
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
It made no sense.

502
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,860
It had nothing to do with the Xbox 360, it's like, people having fun, Xbox 360.

503
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,780
And like I said before, I've probably mentioned this before, we had a project in our high

504
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,260
school economics class to create a product and make a commercial for it.

505
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,280
product and my friend he created took a bunch of clips from like different TV

506
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,480
shows and showing explosions and stuff and just one big long montage set to

507
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,140
music and the very end buy bumper stickers it was great because it it was

508
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,020
just something that entertained you but it had nothing to do with the product I

509
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,260
helped my friends in Spanish class my senior year of high school they had to

510
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,340
do a commercial but in Spanish so we did a condom commercial and they got an F

511
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,780
for doing a condom commercial.

512
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,340
Oh come on, that's retarded.

513
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,260
But I remember because we were all sitting around the bed,

514
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,020
like we would film, we just filmed the product on the bed

515
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,580
and everybody was pushing the bed

516
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,900
so it was going up and down.

517
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,620
And they failed, but it was really funny

518
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,240
and if that was on TV, if that was on Univision,

519
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,580
I think it was funny.

520
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,420
Bitch teacher.

521
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,340
Anyway, I'm sorry.

522
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,980
A voicemail topics for this week,

523
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,100
I want to give you guys a topic for this week, and it kind of goes into our next story here.

524
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,740
This is a great blog piece that was on a website called Twitch Guru.

525
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,340
It's actually kind of old, it's an older piece, but it was picking up some notoriety on gaming

526
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,340
blogs.

527
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,980
I mean, literally you'd have to go back to September of 2005 to see this piece, but for

528
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,660
some reason it was getting picked up by a bunch of sites this week, so that's how it

529
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,860
caught our attention.

530
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,300
But you can ask this question anytime.

531
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,420
This is kind of a timeless issue, yet it's not.

532
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,900
Are video games getting easier?

533
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,900
Think about it.

534
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:44,700
In the 1980s, you had things like Pac-Man, where it was pretty hard to get far into that

535
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
game.

536
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,620
I mean, seriously, what's the furthest you've ever gotten Pac-Man?

537
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,700
Or think about Ms. Pac-Man, have you ever gotten past the first two boards?

538
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,900
You know how there's the pink board and there's the blue board?

539
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,700
Have you ever gotten to the red boards or the ones that come later on?

540
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:05,300
The old games there were really, really hard, but games today don't seem to be as challenging.

541
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,700
It seems to be there's more finite, a way to finish them.

542
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,020
You know what's funny too is a lot of those older games like Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man

543
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,700
they see as like approachable games for people even though they are harder.

544
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,740
That's kind of funny.

545
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,620
So I'm curious, what do you guys think?

546
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,620
Are video games getting easier as time goes on?

547
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,500
I think they're dumbing them down for the dumb people out there that buy video game

548
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,700
systems and there's a lot of them out there, so yeah.

549
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,060
Because they're also afraid, you know, that their reviews on the games or whatever are

550
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:40,180
the game was too hard and I returned it because I couldn't do it and also they

551
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,980
also kind of want to make sure that people play through the game so that

552
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,940
they go and buy another one you know and the article continues to speculate that

553
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,940
possibly one reason why games get easier is because they want to target the

554
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,740
casual gamer well the casual gamer buys the so-called casual games like pac-man

555
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:04,740
Galaga, Frogger, Gauntlet, uh, wait, these were all harder games, what the hell, I mean,

556
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:14,020
I don't get it. I think what it is is less complex games, maybe. They're simpler concepts

557
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:20,180
but harder difficulty. So, you know, Pac-Man's easy. You know, Gobble Dots.

558
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,660
Isn't that what, and that's kind of what the Wii's selling point is, right? Pick up the

559
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,900
thing and go. Yeah, simple games. Anybody can learn. You can make a simple game that is really hard.

560
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,700
It's just, you know, don't make it so complex with 52 buttons.

561
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,700
I mean that's, it's basically, you know, Pac-Man,

562
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,780
pick up dots, you know, and eat ghosts.

563
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,620
Pretty simple. You don't even need to use a button, just a joystick for it. So,

564
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,740
I don't know. Tigerclaw makes an interesting point in our chat room. Back in the 80s,

565
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,060
video games were more about getting high scores so you could enter your initials

566
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,260
in the top 5 or 10.

567
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,180
I used to have the top score on a moon patrol machine at the

568
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,460
local pizza parlor. I rock. Anyway, we're curious about your thoughts on this. Are

569
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,760
video games getting easier?

570
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,220
Or is this just where the market is headed and it's not that the

571
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,220
games are getting easier? I mean, think about some really hard games that have come out like

572
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,260
Ninja Gaiden and things.

573
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:15,140
Are video games getting easier? Or is there just the misconception because

574
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,420
games used to be a lot

575
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,740
simpler? They weren't as complex. So we're really curious what you guys' thoughts are on that

576
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,340
and we look forward to hearing your voicemails of the week. We'll play some of our

577
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,580
favorites on next week's show.

578
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,500
Awesome. Well, I'm kinda speaking a little bit

579
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,100
about difficulty. One thing that's been difficult is Sony selling the

580
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,620
PlayStation 3 to

581
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,300
the gamers out there. Well, one thing that they did supposedly

582
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,420
make, and this was leaked out apparently, was this internal kind of almost like a

583
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,380
Q&A

584
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,500
for E3 for anybody that's working for Sony to be able to answer like press

585
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,540
questions about the

586
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,420
PlayStation 3, and I thought it was quite interesting, some of the things on there.

587
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,800
One of the most interesting things on there is they are really stressing the fact that

588
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,040
the PlayStation 3 is a computer.

589
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,600
In fact, I think it mentions it about six or seven times in here, saying, PlayStation

590
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,040
3 is a computer system.

591
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,520
Then they also basically saying, it's one product with different configurations.

592
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,520
So they're trying to basically say, Sony, we can sell you a PlayStation 3.

593
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,900
It's kind of like Dell, we can build you a custom system.

594
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,440
One interesting thing though about it is that they're saying that the noise of the system

595
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,020
is supposed to be about the same as a slim PS2, so pretty quiet.

596
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,280
Also of course kind of following up with what they said during E3 that it will be able to

597
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:45,880
support 8 controllers, they're guessing maybe 4 wireless, 4 wired controllers, not sure.

598
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,560
And that the specs are pretty close to final, that was one of the other things.

599
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,680
And that the blu-ray drive is going to be BD Live compliant, in other words you'll be

600
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:03,760
able to connect to the internet using some of the special features on the blu-ray disc.

601
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,600
Kind of interesting but I thought it was kind of funny though just how much they were stressing

602
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,800
the Playstation 3 being an actual computer system.

603
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:18,880
In fact, there are some interesting things on here including, right here, it says the

604
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,080
PS3 is being positioned as a computer system, not a computer entertainment system.

605
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,120
Like other computer systems, it can be upgraded through the use of readily available industry

606
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,080
standard adapters.

607
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:36,880
So they're basically saying any PC, USB components you can use with this PlayStation 3.

608
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,400
Another interesting thing on here is they were asking them the difference between Xbox

609
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,900
live and the PlayStation 3 live and well they kind of dodged the question which was kind

610
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
of funny.

611
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,460
But yeah, so it was pretty interesting.

612
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,640
I love this comment in our chat room, Rini says if the PlayStation 3 is a computer system

613
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,580
I want to run Word and Photoshop on it.

614
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,580
Well you know...

615
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
Why not?

616
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,120
If the PlayStation 3 is such a computer?

617
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,680
Well they said that you can run Linux on it and in fact you know one of the questions

618
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,880
is, will Linux OS be adopted as you have planned?

619
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,840
And it says, yes, PS3 is a computer system,

620
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,060
and Linux OS is adopted as one of the standard OSes on there.

621
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,360
Our chat room also seems to be running with that story

622
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,900
from a couple weeks ago, where the controller is supposedly

623
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,680
called the Poohs.

624
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,400
And now they're calling it, I see

625
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,240
DMN made a comment here where he says, HD DVD is greater

626
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,640
than Pooh-ray.

627
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,800
And now they're calling it Pooh-ray.

628
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,840
That's cute.

629
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,760
And now even DJ Pooh Eater changed his name to Poohs Eater.

630
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,320
Get it? I still say that story was a piece of poo.

631
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,280
I don't think it's true, but we'll see. We'll see when it comes out. I think

632
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,360
they probably won't call it the Poohs. It'll probably be like, you know, some

633
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,520
infinity sign something or other, but

634
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,120
everyone will call it Poohs. Yeah, everybody's gonna... Seriously, Sony, if you're

635
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,440
listening, just change the name.

636
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,680
Just call it the PS3 controller. Really, it works.

637
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,560
Anyway, one other PlayStation 3 thing that kind of left a lot of people with a question

638
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,880
mark over their head was this trailer that they showed at E3.

639
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
You remember?

640
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,320
It was this trailer and then there was all these animals that would come out, yes it

641
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:21,040
was Africa was the big title, and the people were like, I mean you could seriously, I remember

642
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,880
we were all sitting at the arena interactive lounge where a lot of the all games contingent,

643
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,440
us and some of our cousin shows that all broadcast on allgames.com, we're all kind of sitting

644
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,160
around and watching the Sony thing and there was just this big collective, what the fuck

645
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,240
was that after that trailer?

646
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,000
And we were all kind of speculating what the fuck Africa is going, is it like Pokemon Snap?

647
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,940
And that was kind of the consensus that we came to is it has to be something like Pokemon

648
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,880
Snap until we hear something more.

649
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,040
Well, there has been a little detail about Africa released, but don't expect it to tell

650
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,320
you very much.

651
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:03,040
Famitsu Magazine came out and revealed that Sony Computer Entertainment's Daisaku Ikajiri

652
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,080
is involved with the game's development.

653
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:12,320
Now, Ikajiri has also worked on Hot Shots Golf 3, 4, Portable, and Online.

654
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,540
So this game may or may not have something in common with Hot Shots Golf.

655
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
That's it!

656
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,540
That's the only detail you get!

657
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,540
Africa...

658
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah, that sounds exciting.

659
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
One thing I forgot to mention...

660
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,960
However, in light of recent events, I hope Sony really uses some tact when promoting

661
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
this game.

662
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Yeah, well, one thing I forgot to mention in the last story, the one question, how the

663
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,480
PS3 network service is going to be, we'll also start the service at day one where the

664
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,340
differences between Xbox Live and the PS3 network services, I thought I'd just quote

665
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,760
exactly what they said here.

666
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,200
Apart from providing basic features and functions, the most important element is content and

667
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,960
is downloading music in SingStar, purchasing or exchanging game data as we had demonstrated

668
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,160
at the E3 press conference and many other new ways of enjoyment too will be provided."

669
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Wow, that doesn't say anything.

670
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,480
And also the fact that they were also saying that the PlayStation 3 will be only available

671
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,480
in black at launch.

672
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,680
So no white PS3 for you guys.

673
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:20,520
Well anyways, speaking still of the PlayStation 3, there was an interview with Sony's Phil

674
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,160
Harrison on Joystick.

675
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,800
week and one of the questions, this was during the developers conference in Brighton, and

676
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,300
their question was basically, because right now Sony's kind of being shown as arrogant

677
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,180
and kind of, you know, there's been numerous quotes out there saying, you know, that you'll

678
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:45,420
buy a Playstation 3 even if there weren't any games for it because it's a Playstation.

679
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:55,200
So, it was kind of funny though because during the whole interview here, one of the quotes

680
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:03,520
that they were saying about Kaz, he blatantly said, Microsoft is copying Sony. And of course,

681
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,040
Phil Harrison's remark was, well quotes can be taken out of contests. Well, that was the

682
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:16,920
actual sentence, though. Taking out, you know, how can you take that out of context? I mean,

683
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,480
that seems pretty clear to me. But anyways, yeah, he didn't like the fact that they were

684
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,600
asking him hard questions, which I thought was pretty funny. But, you know, you gotta

685
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,340
feel sorry for that Phil Harrison guy, because I mean, I remember when they were first talking

686
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:35,940
about the PlayStation 3 before we knew anything, you know, about the price. It, you know, he's

687
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:40,860
He's got to cover up for all these higher ups there saying really dumb shit every week

688
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:47,060
and you've got to feel bad for him or whatever.

689
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,960
I think we should just move on to some Xbox news for a little bit here and I think this

690
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,220
is kind of interesting.

691
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,260
I think we already knew this but the Xbox has been officially discontinued.

692
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,860
At least that's a rumor going around but honestly seeing as I can't seem to find a new Xbox

693
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,860
for sale anywhere.

694
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,860
The Xbox has been officially discontinued.

695
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,860
We're not talking about 360, I'm talking about the regular old school Xbox.

696
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:17,860
But what's the other rumor that's kind of interesting to note is that there is a new Xbox 360 Pro bundle being prepared by Microsoft supposedly

697
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:27,860
that has Project Gotham Racing 3 included with it along with a 1250 Microsoft point card and a 3 month subscription to Xbox Live Gold

698
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,860
and it will run you $399.

699
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,660
But what's not mentioned there is, does that include the hard drive?

700
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,660
I'm assuming it does, because normally on live you've got to have a hard drive or a memory card.

701
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,460
I guess that's true.

702
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,460
Or the point, you know, how you're going to spend the points with no hard drive.

703
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,460
So, we'll see. But maybe, would you lose the cables?

704
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,660
No. I think what they'll do is they'll probably just put that out.

705
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,860
It's just going to be a bundle.

706
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,060
You know, instead of, you won't be able to find the system by itself,

707
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:59,860
then it'll be just coming with that game and stuff instead of the premium bundle or premium system.

708
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,120
SSJ100, Matt makes an interesting observation in chatroom, it's funny that the PlayStation

709
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,020
1 lasted longer in production than the original Xbox.

710
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:14,220
Well, I don't know, I hope it doesn't happen because that sucks for us because we have

711
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:20,220
a stockpile of like a thousand units and yeah, it's totally not a good thing.

712
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,740
But anyways, send them to a landfill in Africa.

713
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,620
No, we're not sending them to a landfill, they'll sell.

714
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:33,500
So one good thing that is going on right now is they've kicked off the Xbox Live gold event

715
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:41,180
and basically that was to kind of showcase the releases of some brand new Xbox Live games

716
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:47,180
including of course Street Fighter 2, Galaga, Frogger, and Pac-Man.

717
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:52,140
And they're going to be releasing them every Wednesday starting with, well, last Wednesday

718
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,020
when Frogger came out.

719
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,460
week you can look forward to cloning Clyde which will be pretty fun and then

720
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:04,320
of course Galaga following on the 26th Street Fighter 2 on August 2nd are you

721
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,300
sure this time are we sure this is official press release from Microsoft

722
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:14,460
freaking better be last chance and pac-man on August 9th and I believe

723
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,260
shortly after that there'll be some more stuff coming out but they're trying to

724
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,760
do it you know every you know week or so they're gonna be really seeing a new

725
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,280
title and you know not very expensive they're gonna be about you know five to

726
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,080
ten dollars Street Fighter 2 being ten dollars same with Cloning Clyde

727
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,200
everything else is five bucks. I have this random thought because we were

728
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,920
talking earlier about you know our video games getting you know easier and we're

729
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,320
talking about the retro games so it does seem like these retro games are really

730
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,600
making a comeback slowly but surely with all these retro collections we saw you

731
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,120
know the Atari the Intellivision lives the Midway collections and now kind of

732
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,800
the Xbox Live Arcade sort of getting some new life to the retro games as well.

733
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,640
Is that possibly because people feel that these retro games present a challenge, especially

734
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,520
for the value you get, that really isn't provided by mainstream gaming today?

735
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,800
I don't know.

736
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,800
Maybe.

737
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,800
It's kind of an odd thought.

738
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,800
I don't know.

739
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,640
But it's pretty cool that they're releasing all this stuff finally, since it's been like

740
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,600
a while since UNO came out.

741
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,080
Yeah, that's very good news to hear.

742
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,840
I'm very glad to see that Xbox Live is finally getting some new stuff, so hopefully even

743
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,200
more arcade releases by the end of the year.

744
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,400
Not only are there releases in the arcade category, but they are also getting some releases

745
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,440
in some of the video and movie categories as well.

746
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,640
In fact, I actually downloaded this this week.

747
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:39,280
It's Halo 3 In The Beginning was released on Xbox Live this week.

748
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:46,040
In Halo 3 In The Beginning, basically what it is, it's a trailer about making the teaser

749
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:51,480
announcement for Halo 3 a trailer of a trailer yes it's a trailer about the

750
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,000
making of a trailer and it's not even like the real trailer it's the teaser

751
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,040
trailer but I and so in a way I'm kind of going this is just like the biggest

752
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:08,440
self-ego inflation piece I've ever seen on a video game console but I don't know

753
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,800
at the same time I downloaded it because it's free and I'm like oh this is pretty

754
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,360
and it's HD and I'll watch anything in HD because it's pretty especially what

755
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,020
has to do with gaming but I did find it was fascinating I mean all the freaking

756
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,980
work that went into making just that you know one-minute trailer they showed at

757
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:28,620
the e3 speaking of pretty in HD I actually was we're picking up a new

758
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:33,960
couch this weekend over at RC Willie and we were checking out the electronics

759
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:40,440
section there and we had one of the guys show me a HD DVD demonstration on a 70

760
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,980
inch plasma screen it looks pretty I don't know if I'd spend the four thousand

761
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:49,520
dollars on the plasma screen for it but if I had a 7 inch plasma screen you know

762
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,260
a next-gen you know video device would look pretty nice on it but you can

763
00:46:54,260 --> 00:47:01,140
actually see like some of the you know details like the little hairs individual

764
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:06,460
hairs on like a flower and stuff like that just insane amount of detail all

765
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:11,480
right well I'm someone just joined us who wants to comment on all this actually

766
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,480
Hi everybody. I am literally just off the road.

767
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,480
I actually had a conversation with DMN when I did my Tuesday show.

768
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:25,480
Mentioned that basically HD DVD was blowing away Blu-ray for quality.

769
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,480
I think they're about neck and neck if I remember correctly.

770
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:34,480
But even still I was asking about the 1080p plasma screens out there.

771
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,480
And they didn't have too many at the store.

772
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,480
I mean they carried a lot of stuff.

773
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,040
So, it's good that they're supporting 1080p, but there's not a lot of TVs out there to

774
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:49,240
choose from, to be honest, so, I don't know, it's kind of interesting.

775
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,240
Alright.

776
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
Well, welcome DarkSakura, how are you?

777
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,240
Uh, road-weary.

778
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,240
Yeah?

779
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,600
I'm actually weary of stupid men drivers.

780
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,600
You were right.

781
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,400
Should I put money on it?

782
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,400
What?

783
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,520
We had a bet if you would complain about drivers when you got here to the show.

784
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,520
Don't I always?

785
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,520
Exactly.

786
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,520
At least she admits it!

787
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,520
Amazingly enough, all the bad drivers were male.

788
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:21,520
Especially the one who was tailgating the person in front of him, skidded off the side of the road, and blew a rocket into my windshield.

789
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,520
I forgot we had somebody else on your mic, so I want to make sure we're not blowing the audience away there. Sorry about that.

790
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,520
With the awesomeness of my voice.

791
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,520
Sorry about that.

792
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Anyway, how was your gaming week? You want to get that out?

793
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,660
Sure my gaming week was actually was a lot of Animal Crossing and a lot of

794
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:44,560
pinball a lot of pinball. I played so much pinball last weekend. Was it was it

795
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,360
just that show that you called us from last week? Well that and playing pinball

796
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,680
in my garage you know. Did you end up buying any new machines? We did not and actually we

797
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,640
lost out on the Black Knight 2000 we were gonna get because we went back to

798
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,560
check on it and it had been sold to somebody else for $600 can you believe

799
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:04,280
it and but we are working on a World Cup soccer 94 which is actually one of my

800
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:10,280
favorite machines for nostalgia value and we actually had two of our triggers

801
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,240
on our last action hero broke so we have to replace that before we can keep

802
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,640
playing it but Dan got our roulette working on our who done it pinball so

803
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,480
that's awesome it now completely works all right sounds fun and I put a lot of

804
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,000
crossing I got an I got a note that our chat room here is just there they're

805
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,700
celebrating that you're back.

806
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,460
We have DMN says, nice of you to show up, Dark Sakura.

807
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,460
Hey!

808
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,980
No, I think you meant that in a good way, though.

809
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,980
Oh, hi.

810
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,980
And let's see, what else?

811
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,320
Morrie says, yay, Dark Sakura's around again.

812
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,320
Life is fun.

813
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,660
Life is always fun with me here at the party every day.

814
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:46,180
And then somebody referred to, oh, Dark Knight said, Dark Sakura is the queen of the show,

815
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,940
all hail the OLR queen.

816
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:52,220
And then DMN followed that up with, I thought Skye was the queen of the show.

817
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,220
Screw you.

818
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,220
Anyways.

819
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,440
Anyways. Only on special occasions.

820
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,700
Okay, well anyways, back to the new stuff.

821
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:05,060
One of the things that actually happened this week was EA's Summer Showcase

822
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,900
and that's basically kind of like their little press event that they have

823
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,060
showcasing their brand new titles that are going to be coming out.

824
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,900
And the top of the showcase, of course, the next-gen version of Half-Life 2

825
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,100
which is going to be on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

826
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,900
So that's pretty interesting that that's been confirmed and not too much of a

827
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:29,340
a surprise since, you know, it's going to be, you know, it's a pretty major game, especially

828
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:35,060
now that they're doing the episodes and stuff. And of course, you know, it's exciting and

829
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:41,260
that also kind of confirms the thing that was on GameStop not too long ago. But yeah,

830
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:46,100
pretty sweet. And of course I know they were also releasing some other games that I thought

831
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:55,940
that have been vaporware including actually oh what was it oh god I can't

832
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:01,380
remember anyways yeah lots of good stuff team fortress 2 that's what it was so

833
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,780
pretty cool all right for those of you guys listening live here on this Sunday

834
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:09,020
evening we all got booted from chat because we had too many of us trying to

835
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,900
hit the chat room at once all four of us here in the room we're all in the chat

836
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,580
room and we got booted from the server so it's probably gonna be a few more

837
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,980
minutes before we get back in so

838
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,860
apologize for that you guys and we'll work on that at least throughout the break

839
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,420
meanwhile we just gotta keep it running here so I'm gonna go to the next story here

840
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,740
every extend extra has a demo that's been released and

841
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:33,700
it's only for the PC so even though this game is gonna be coming out for the PSP

842
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,100
you can only get the demo on your PC that's stupid

843
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,820
well here's the thing though is that every extend was actually a PC game

844
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,060
way back in the day so I'm assuming that every extend extra is also coming out for

845
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,760
the PC

846
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,440
So well, why don't they do like another PSP demo because I know that they had what?

847
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,080
loco roko and

848
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,600
You know, there's some well in Japan there was like some

849
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,960
sudoku demo and stuff like that, but

850
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:05,060
That's about it. I mean this brand new feature that they add to the PSP and they do nothing with

851
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,720
excellent use of the PSP because you know

852
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:14,080
You know, no one really wants demos to download off the internet, of course, because Xbox

853
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:21,800
Live's Marketplace demos, no one ever downloads those, especially with the PSP needing people

854
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:26,280
to buy some of this software out there, because there hasn't really been that many great games

855
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,280
lately.

856
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,560
I don't know, just hear me rant some more.

857
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:36,800
Alright, well let's go to another story here.

858
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,880
This is something that our music game fans, I'm kind of mad that we're booted from chat

859
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,720
right now because I really would love to get reaction to this, but anyway, Konami has filed

860
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,480
a patent for the title Guitar Revolution.

861
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,960
Now what's interesting about this is that a lot of people are saying, oh well this means

862
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,840
that Konami is planning to compete with Guitar Hero, they're going to go directly head to

863
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,820
head with Guitar Hero, and a lot of people seem to be neglecting the fact that Konami

864
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:08,460
had a guitar game out in Japan for quite some time

865
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,700
they did release a version here in the US but

866
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,000
it didn't do so well. It didn't come out for the home consoles though. It was only in the

867
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,420
arcade. They had one mix in the arcade. It didn't do so hot

868
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,620
over here. It just didn't catch on for whatever reason.

869
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,420
So we didn't hear much on the guitar freaks front

870
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,300
unless you were an import gamer here in the US for quite some time. But now

871
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,980
they've gone and trademarked the name Guitar Revolution.

872
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,980
So that would indicate if they are planning to revive the franchise here in

873
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:34,540
the US

874
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:40,560
They're gonna change the name of it to fit DDR, you know, dance dance revolution and karaoke revolution and all that good stuff

875
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:49,480
Of course just because they patented the name doesn't mean that they are going to make it

876
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,520
I mean they could just be you know, it could be a concept thing at this time

877
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,660
They just don't want anyone else to jump in on it, but I don't know kind of looks

878
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:02,200
Like they could be prepping for a new game. What do you think look?

879
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:09,200
Probably. It makes sense, especially with the success of Guitar Hero. It would be something

880
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,560
that they would probably want to do. I don't know. I think the whole problem before is

881
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:20,840
they didn't know how to market Guitar Freaks to the people, and now that they've seen how

882
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:27,280
it's basically been done, they can kind of go from there. So yeah.

883
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,880
So I have to ask Miklatov, if we can get him a mic real quick, because he had to move a

884
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,740
little bit there. How you doing? Good. Okay now what do you I know you can't

885
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,740
really talk a whole lot about this because you you work at Konami or

886
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:44,700
whatever but surely you must have some thoughts on kind of the reaction out

887
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:50,820
there that people are having to this? I totally do. First of all I'd like to say

888
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:56,020
that my opinions do not reflect Konami's opinions just a lot of people that work

889
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:02,200
there or our opinion or yeah whoever it's my opinion and that's what I'm

890
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:08,560
sticking to okay so when this guitar revolution stuff came out a wonderfully

891
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:14,120
crappy site named one up calm decided that one of their idiots would write

892
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:21,080
about it and his name is Jared Rhea just so everybody knows he also goes by slip

893
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:28,360
I think I don't know I don't pay attention to him but what he did in his

894
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:34,680
little blog post is pretty much say how our company actually works internally

895
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:40,080
which he doesn't know and because he doesn't work there so that's pretty

896
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:47,440
libelous and he also decided to bash on so like the DDR team that's in America

897
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,900
saying that uh we care more about what songs we get in the game rather than the

898
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:57,060
quality which is not true because we can't do anything about quality or

899
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:03,580
songs so he's a moron and then apparently really recently maybe today I

900
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:11,420
don't know how to read dates he talks about how he and one of my co-workers

901
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:15,420
are pretty... read read read read read read.

902
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:19,420
That he's taking credit for

903
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,420
being a catalyst to the DDR

904
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,420
revolution sort of thing in America

905
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:31,420
and that he's one of the people that is behind

906
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,420
the scenes making everyone move their feet to quote his blog post. Well he's not.

907
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:39,420
He never worked at Konami. All he is is this whiny little punk that

908
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:46,460
worked at 1UP.com, he no longer does it looks like, and I pretty much hate his guts,

909
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:53,740
and he's an idiot. I could say a whole lot more, but it would involve a lot of cussing,

910
00:56:53,740 --> 00:57:01,260
and since I don't do that, I can't say anymore. Let me try to go back to the topic at hand,

911
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:08,380
because I'm just trying to not go there. I'll go there. I know you will. I'm trying to think,

912
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:19,380
Okay, what is the public, you have these people that are very vocal about, especially I notice

913
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:23,620
within the Groove fans, I'm not talking about this blogger, but like in the Groove fans,

914
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:29,100
have this huge misconception about the way DDR is made in America.

915
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:32,860
What are the biggest misconceptions people have of Konami in general and the way that

916
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,940
they're making their games, if there's anything you can say on that?

917
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,420
I don't think there's anything I can actually say about that.

918
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,980
All right, well, I think, um, I was going to beat him up.

919
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:47,260
I think Mieglatov got us started on a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge

920
00:57:47,260 --> 00:58:00,380
Radio called the FUs of the Week.

921
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,940
Every week we like to get a little bit ranty and say FU to things that piss us off.

922
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,940
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

923
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:10,780
that I've just come off the road a big f-you goes to that guy in the truck who

924
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:14,540
sent a rock into my windshield and luckily enough it didn't put another

925
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:20,380
crack in my windshield but it was just very surprising very dangerous how he

926
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:25,780
was driving and so I got away from as fast as I could and also all the traffic

927
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,780
back to home the 17 but that's another story

928
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:39,780
Loki, I'd like to say a big FU, and not really a problem I have anymore, to my old couch.

929
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:48,780
It sucked, and it's gone. Dump that piece of shit in landfill. I have a nice new couch

930
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:53,780
now. Alright, Niklasov, do you have anything additional?

931
00:58:53,780 --> 00:59:01,700
I'd like to say an FU to oneup.com for being a terrible, terrible site and for hiring people

932
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,180
that have no skills.

933
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:09,940
I'd also like to clarify the views and opinions of our guests, do not reflect those of the

934
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:14,380
rest of us.

935
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,380
Let's see.

936
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,380
I'm not done.

937
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,380
What else?

938
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:24,580
I'll give an FU to Milpitas Golfland because they put all their dancing games right next

939
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,580
to each other.

940
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:29,460
So now, if I want to go play Pump, I have to weed through the Supernova people and the

941
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,420
In the Groove people, which are taking up way too much space for me.

942
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:35,060
Oh yeah, I saw a Pump Zero machine in Reno yesterday.

943
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,060
It's really fun.

944
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,060
I didn't play it.

945
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:40,060
What do I want to give an FU to this week?

946
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:43,860
Oh, I'll give an FU to Reno for robbing me of $40 from their slot machines.

947
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:47,660
I thought Reno was supposed to have better slot machines than the Indian casinos we have

948
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:51,340
here, but I suppose not.

949
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:54,140
F you to those one-armed bandits taking money from me.

950
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,260
They're supposed to give me money.

951
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,260
That's not fair.

952
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:01,820
All right, let's get back into some news here, and again, we are still locked out of the

953
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,820
chat room.

954
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:03,820
There's not a lot we can do.

955
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:07,700
We're just kind of going to try and keep getting back in there, and we'll be hopefully back

956
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,700
soon.

957
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,700
So, meanwhile.

958
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,700
Yes, excellent.

959
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:20,540
But meanwhile, I'd like to talk to you guys about Take Two and how they just constantly

960
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,460
like to get in the trouble.

961
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:28,780
This time they're in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission and this luckily has

962
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:36,260
nothing to do with the whole hot coffee thing, but it actually has to do with the stock option

963
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:42,940
grants that are made by the company from 1997 to the present.

964
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:48,460
And basically they're just, they're not having a good day.

965
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,580
And they really need another grant that thought it would come out.

966
01:00:51,580 --> 01:01:00,100
And they better not fuck up the network gameplay on Vice City Stories or I will be pissed.

967
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:08,020
I will fly my ass down there to beat the crap out of them personally.

968
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:11,820
I hate those network programmers, god dammit they were so lazy.

969
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:20,440
Anyways, moving on, speaking of programming, Hellgate London, the source code has been

970
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,540
stolen and leaked to the internet.

971
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:29,300
Kind of like some other games out there, but yeah so apparently someone on the inside stole

972
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:37,300
I remember seeing this at E3, the Hellgate London game, but it didn't really play it.

973
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,540
I don't know, interesting.

974
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:45,620
But yeah, hacker strike again, yay.

975
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:49,660
Going to another story here, speaking of London-ish, it's about the UK.

976
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:52,340
It's about the government in the UK.

977
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:56,820
The British government is actually going to be organizing a census to track the game industry's

978
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:57,820
growth.

979
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:02,780
The survey is being administered by Skill Set and this is an entertainment research

980
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:07,280
group and what they are going to do is they are going to gather data and this could actually

981
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,540
influence decisions made by the parliament later on.

982
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:16,040
There is a quote from the creative director of Eidos Interactive, the census is a headcount

983
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,100
of the industry.

984
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:21,080
It helps Skill Set influence government policy makers and public funds for the benefit and

985
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:26,280
support of the industry and the Skill Set will be going out to company managing directors

986
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,040
and Human Resource Departments, and you can also, if you happen to be one of these people,

987
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,480
you can do it online.

988
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:37,440
It's available on the Skill Set website at skillset.org slash research slash census,

989
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,320
and they'll start the result calculating on July 12th.

990
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:46,920
So if you want to influence what's going on in the UK government, maybe a little bit.

991
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,880
It sounds a little bit like, I don't know, it kind of seems like it has some comparisons

992
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,840
to video game voters dot org, but not really.

993
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,320
You know what it comes down to, huh?

994
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:00,600
It comes down to census or die.

995
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,160
We're going to go ahead and take a break here.

996
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,000
We're going to call it the end of part A. When we come back, more Orange Lounge Radio

997
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,080
with our part B.

998
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:12,360
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream
