00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:25,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, July 16th, 2006, Target pulls UMDs from shelves, new rumors are floating around about the Wii controller, and is Konami planning to directly compete with Guitar Hero?

2
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:36,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:38,224
[SPEAKER_04]: This is episode number 191 for this

4
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:40,241
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

5
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:09,537
[SPEAKER_04]: She's just running late tonight.

6
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: She was in the Bay Area this weekend doing something and she's running a little late, but she says she will be here in time for Part B and she might even make it to the show depending on how long we run during Part A. I told her whenever she gets here, just barge on in.

7
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:22,722
[SPEAKER_04]: and say hello.

8
00:01:22,802 --> 00:01:24,723
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be looking forward to hearing from her very soon.

9
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:26,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you didn't have to tell her to do that.

10
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:28,344
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll just kick the door down.

11
00:01:28,624 --> 00:01:29,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here!

12
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:30,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we'll see.

13
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:33,065
[SPEAKER_07]: The traffic was horrible!

14
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:34,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what do you want to bet when she gets here?

15
00:01:34,726 --> 00:01:36,306
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be some type of rant about the traffic.

16
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:37,767
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I already know there was an accident.

17
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:38,207
[SPEAKER_04]: She told me...

18
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:43,949
[SPEAKER_04]: She told me part of the reason she wasn't here is that there's an accident on one of the highways that kept her kind of late.

19
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,169
[SPEAKER_05]: She'll be bright and cheery.

20
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:45,749
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

21
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:45,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

22
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:50,331
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try to time the FUs of the week in time for her arrival, but I don't know.

23
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,211
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a plan we got to stick to.

24
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:56,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we do have the one and only Miklatov filling in again.

25
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:57,433
[SPEAKER_04]: You never leave.

26
00:01:58,013 --> 00:01:58,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I try not to.

27
00:01:58,994 --> 00:01:59,254
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

28
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:02,095
[SPEAKER_04]: But Miklatov has something very important he's going to say tonight.

29
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:04,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhat.

30
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:05,096
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably about women.

31
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:05,636
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

32
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:06,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

33
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:09,295
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34
00:02:35,233 --> 00:03:04,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Played a little bit of Chromehounds Basically you have to go through all the training missions As you would call them And they have it split up into six different sections For each type of class you want to do And you unlock parts that way Because basically if you want to build a mech You have to play through the whole single player game In order to get some good parts And so I've been playing that And playing a lot of Ridge Racer I'm kind of done with that game

35
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:06,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

36
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:30,286
[SPEAKER_05]: RidgeRacer 6 is no different, and that's another reason why I will not be buying RidgeRacer 2 when that comes out for the PSP.

37
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:32,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just going to be the same damn shit all over again.

38
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:36,773
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so weird to me that you already have RidgeRacer 6, yet they're going to go back and do RidgeRacer 2.

39
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:38,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's different.

40
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,797
[SPEAKER_04]: It's RidgeRacer PSP 2.

41
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:42,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's different, but it's still just kind of weird when you talk about it.

42
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:43,612
[SPEAKER_05]: R4 was awesome, but

43
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:01,337
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I didn't have to like, I'm like, oh yeah, I remember this track.

44
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:02,917
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know how to race it already.

45
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:04,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And the drifting is just completely wrong anyways.

46
00:04:04,898 --> 00:04:08,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played... I'm done with the game.

47
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need to sell it before it drops price again.

48
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, you know, get rid of it.

49
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,861
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can, you know, buy more games in August.

50
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:20,443
[SPEAKER_05]: The other game I played was Zygopane.

51
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:22,463
[SPEAKER_05]: XOR.

52
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:23,824
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

53
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:33,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, this is a Japanese-only Xbox 360 game, but doing a nifty little region trick, you can download a demo that's on the live marketplace right now.

54
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:36,144
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an interesting game.

55
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:40,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Reminds me a bit of Zone of Vendors, just the way the combat system is.

56
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:45,889
[SPEAKER_05]: It is kind of neat, though, because you use the right analog to kind of switch targets to which one you want to fire against.

57
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:53,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And then basically, you have your normal shot and charged shots, and then this kind of like special attack, which is just more charged shots.

58
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:55,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat.

59
00:04:55,552 --> 00:04:57,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't buy it, but it's kind of neat.

60
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:01,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a little bit of Frogger, and what can I say?

61
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:01,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Frogger's Frogger.

62
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:07,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, I think that was... I'm still playing through Blazing Angels.

63
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:11,481
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the game's now to the point where I just want it to be over.

64
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:17,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how every week you come... Like, for the past four or five weeks when I've come on the show, I've been playing Blazing Angels this week.

65
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:18,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it!

66
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:21,106
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been like the past five weeks.

67
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:22,606
[SPEAKER_04]: You haven't stopped playing it.

68
00:05:23,086 --> 00:05:24,807
[SPEAKER_04]: If you hate a game, throw it away.

69
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,427
[SPEAKER_05]: The last achievement, man.

70
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:27,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Last achievement.

71
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:29,168
[SPEAKER_05]: True points horror.

72
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:30,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have to.

73
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:37,230
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that they make these different modes, like arcade mode and the mini campaign mode, they're all the same.

74
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,490
[SPEAKER_05]: All the same.

75
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:44,432
[SPEAKER_05]: The only difference between the arcade mode and, say, the mini campaign mode, you fight 20 planes.

76
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:45,792
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

77
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:47,673
[SPEAKER_05]: In the arcade mode, you fight

78
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

79
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:12,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

80
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:36,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's true.

81
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:40,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember your past few FUs of the week have been about traffic, so I think you just got pwned.

82
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:42,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

83
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:43,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here we go.

84
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:46,448
[SPEAKER_04]: You will bow to me once you know exactly how many achievement points do you have.

85
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:47,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a lot.

86
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:49,649
[SPEAKER_04]: We always call you an achievement points whore, but you really don't have that many.

87
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:50,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

88
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:51,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Compared to some people.

89
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't have enough time to play stuff.

90
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:54,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you break like 3,000?

91
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:55,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

92
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:57,172
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot.

93
00:06:57,212 --> 00:07:00,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I only have like 1,200 or something.

94
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:09,357
[SPEAKER_05]: What I try to do is I sit down with a game that I want to get rid of, like Ridge Racer or Blazing Angels.

95
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:15,016
[SPEAKER_05]: and I just play it and play it and play it and play it until I finally get all the achievement points and then I go and sell it.

96
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:24,000
[SPEAKER_05]: And my game after Ridge Racer and Blazing Angels, the next one's going to be Rumble Roses XX because that game was lame.

97
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily though, Blazing Angels and Rumble Roses, I did not pay for.

98
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:32,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I got those free from Konami and Ubisoft.

99
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:35,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they were really thankful to give those away.

100
00:07:36,994 --> 00:07:38,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Ridge Racer did spend money on.

101
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:40,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, Ridge Racer's fun.

102
00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:43,556
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun, but... It was okay.

103
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:46,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's better racers on 360 right now, but I had fun with it.

104
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:47,417
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun game.

105
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:51,078
[SPEAKER_04]: As a more traditional racer that's not like blow shit up, it's pretty good.

106
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:52,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see the next Burnout.

107
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:55,679
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, something that's made from scratch and not a port.

108
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:57,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be better.

109
00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:01,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe, I don't know, it's a good arcade racing game is what we need out there.

110
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:03,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you've been playing this week?

111
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:05,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's it.

112
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:06,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto, of course.

113
00:08:25,393 --> 00:08:26,514
[SPEAKER_04]: on Xbox Live Arcade.

114
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:30,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hell, it was five bucks, and I wanted something new, so I was kind of a sucker.

115
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:30,616
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.

116
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:33,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually a lot better than I expected.

117
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:42,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I was expecting it to just be a straight arcade port with not a lot of extra frills, but I think it's kind of cool that they have some extra stuff.

118
00:08:42,203 --> 00:08:44,685
[SPEAKER_04]: They did enhance the graphics for whatever it's worth.

119
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's nothing to scream about.

120
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:52,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like they enhanced it from the Atari 2600-style graphics that it used to be

121
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:54,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, I'll give them more credit.

122
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:56,256
[SPEAKER_04]: More like NES-style graphics.

123
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:59,698
[SPEAKER_04]: They souped it up to, like, Super NES-style graphics.

124
00:08:59,758 --> 00:09:01,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's still not that great.

125
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:03,540
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's alright.

126
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:09,703
[SPEAKER_04]: But the game, you know, it's amazingly simple and will entertain you for a little bit.

127
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:12,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like the fact they have co-op modes in there and some other multiplayer modes.

128
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Except, I only played one co-op game, but it was laggy as hell.

129
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was to the point where

130
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:20,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

131
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:38,189
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

132
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:01,429
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

133
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:17,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Prey Doom 3

134
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:39,061
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

135
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,943
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely on there.

136
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:43,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like, I liked it better when it was called Duke Nukem 3.

137
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:47,408
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very obvious, so there's a lot in common with the Doom 3 interface.

138
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,649
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, I haven't done my research on the game.

139
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:51,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if they use the Doom 3 interface.

140
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the Doom 3 interface.

141
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:53,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's not a surprise at all, honestly.

142
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:54,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell.

143
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you, instead of having a flashlight, you have a lighter.

144
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:02,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you do have the gravity stuff, which is kind of cool.

145
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:03,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you go...

146
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,242
[SPEAKER_04]: You can walk up these ramps and go upside down and stuff.

147
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:11,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem is that I have a hard enough time conceptualizing 3D space.

148
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:22,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's just me having been an old school gamer since Atari 2600 days that when everything started moving into 3D, I had a hard time sometimes conceptualizing 3D space, like levels and things.

149
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:30,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to be able to run upside down and up walls and stuff is even more confusing to me in trying to figure out how the levels laid out.

150
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,120
[SPEAKER_04]: But

151
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's okay.

152
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:33,141
[SPEAKER_04]: The game controls pretty good.

153
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:33,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play multiplayer.

154
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:34,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I only played single player.

155
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:44,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I did think, to the game's credit, I thought the setup was really good and the drama in the opening parts of the game were done very well and very seamlessly.

156
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:45,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought it was kind of cool.

157
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:48,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you could really put yourself right in the action.

158
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:49,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Doom 3 Prey Improved

159
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:11,306
[SPEAKER_04]: In this game, really.

160
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,407
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's all done within the engine.

161
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:14,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's very cool.

162
00:12:14,888 --> 00:12:19,911
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you can definitely tell how far technology's come when you don't have much of a need for cutscenes anymore.

163
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:28,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember playing the Prey demo, and all I did was I walked up to the little machine, one of the arcade machines in there, and it was like a Pac-Man demo, and I played that.

164
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:33,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Going over to the chat room, looking at some questions there...

165
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:41,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Ubuntu Maniac 64 says, Sky would die playing F-Zero, X, and GX then because of all the ramps and upside down.

166
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:45,616
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, I really, really, really enjoyed F-Zero on the GameCube.

167
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:48,860
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a little annoyed with the arcade version because it only had six tracks.

168
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:53,566
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, I thought the game was magnificent, and I really wish they'd done more with the arcade.

169
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the arcade had four tracks.

170
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:59,772
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have these, like, uh, this, uh, you know, teleportation bullshit, you know, or, um, you know, the...

171
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:24,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not totally incompetent when it comes to visualizing 3D.

172
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:25,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a little credit.

173
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,792
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm telling you, Prey really pushes the envelope.

174
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:29,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because you go through portals.

175
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:33,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Suddenly this box will now be a portal into another place in the level.

176
00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:35,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had no map.

177
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:39,704
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably can bring it up easily, but I didn't even figure out how to bring up a map in the demo.

178
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:41,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Descent Metroid Prime

179
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:12,187
[SPEAKER_04]: For some reason, the little levels, the head-to-head levels are cool, but those big, massive Metroid levels, especially in the first game, it's just too much.

180
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:13,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

181
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:16,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And just the fact that it wasn't Metroid to me.

182
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I remember Super Metroid, and it's one of the best video games ever made.

183
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:25,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone was mentioning in the chat room that the Saints Row demo is out on the Xbox magazine.

184
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:26,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

185
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:27,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't gotten my new issue yet.

186
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember if I've run out of issues or not.

187
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:31,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember when I subscribed to that.

188
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:33,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Call of Duty 2, Quake 4, and Condemned

189
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:58,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, as far as Prey goes, I'm going to withhold making a real judgment call on the game until I can play the full version and get a little hands-on multiplayer.

190
00:14:59,213 --> 00:14:59,854
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what can I say?

191
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:05,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the fact that you can download demos for free and judge for yourself if you like the game or not.

192
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,498
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you need me to review this game for you?

193
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:09,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Go download the demo and see for yourself.

194
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,262
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like shooters, if you like Doom 3, I think you'll like Prey.

195
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:13,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my major bitch on this game.

196
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:15,724
[SPEAKER_05]: No split-screen multiplayer.

197
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:28,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I understand that's not a big deal for some people that do the LAN parties and stuff like that, but when I'm playing at work or playing at home, you know, and I have some friends over and we want to bust out this game, you know, we can't do that.

198
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:31,620
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot play, you know, split-screen multiplayer on there.

199
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,246
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that kind of sucks, but, you know, they do have, like I said, the, um...

200
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:39,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Jada2006 Pray is a LAN party game.

201
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:41,384
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not meant for split-screen multiplayer.

202
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:57,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Tough!

203
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I want split-screen multiplayer!

204
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:20,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I will make the decision, I'm glad that they have that mode in there, but I will make the decision whether I want to use it or not, and if I really want to keep, you know, a really tiny-ass little section of the screen for my view, that's fine, you know, but I don't have, you know, four Xbox 360s and four high-def TVs that I can, you know, share with my friends.

205
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's keep it moving because we want to get to the news here.

206
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:24,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov, how was your gaming week?

207
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I played World of Warcraft

208
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,340
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just this weekend.

209
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,520
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

210
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but when you say you played World of Warcraft this weekend, you played all weekend, right?

211
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:41,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was Warsong Honor this week, or Double Warsong Honor, so I had to keep playing and playing and playing.

212
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:45,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what do you get for racking up a bunch of points in the PvP Warsong Gold?

213
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:46,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

214
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:49,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So why do you keep playing?

215
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:50,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I just know I have to do it.

216
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:52,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like an internet penis thing?

217
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you want to have the big title in front of your name so that you're special, or what?

218
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:02,561
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I like seeing the bar fill up for each little thing I become honored or friendly with.

219
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:03,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, serious question, though.

220
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:06,362
[SPEAKER_04]: How many hours would you say this weekend alone did you play Warsong Gulch?

221
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:08,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crap.

222
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:10,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Total, 12.

223
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

224
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:17,246
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really fun, though, because I kept owning people.

225
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:21,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly enough, I think I know probably people that are more addicted to World of Warcraft than that.

226
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:22,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm not addicted.

227
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:24,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like to have my little bursts.

228
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:37,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in Reno randomly yesterday, as I mentioned before, and we were at a restaurant at Circus Circus kind of later in the evening, and this guy was very, very drunk and with his very, very drunk girlfriend and was trying to start a conversation with us.

229
00:17:37,821 --> 00:17:41,003
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how there's some drunkies that'll do that, like try to start a conversation with strangers?

230
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:41,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're stupid.

231
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:45,626
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a right way to start a conversation with strangers, and there's a wrong way to do it.

232
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, hey!

233
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:46,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey!

234
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:48,668
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, guy?

235
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:50,289
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how he sounded, too.

236
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,151
[SPEAKER_04]: He sounded like Animal from the Muppets.

237
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:53,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guy!

238
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:53,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey!

239
00:17:55,362 --> 00:17:58,645
[SPEAKER_04]: and he actually said, I'm a WoW player!

240
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:01,267
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, that's great.

241
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:02,589
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a WoW, you're retarded.

242
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:03,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm like, me too.

243
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:09,675
[SPEAKER_04]: But then he tried to tell me, he's like, yeah man, I like EverQuest on the PlayStation 2, that game's awesome!

244
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:10,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like...

245
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:12,953
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't make EverQuest on the PlayStation 2.

246
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:13,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say this.

247
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:14,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they really?

248
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,174
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't make EverQuest on the PlayStation 2.

249
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:16,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they did.

250
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:16,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they?

251
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:18,674
[SPEAKER_05]: EverQuest Online Adventures.

252
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:22,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's one of the games I think they even bundled the hard drive with at one time.

253
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they didn't put EverQuest on PS2.

254
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,436
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they didn't require the hard drive.

255
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:26,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they did.

256
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:26,497
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

257
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:28,377
[SPEAKER_06]: God, why would you play EverQuest on PS2?

258
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:31,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the same reason you play Final Fantasy XI on the PS2, I guess, but...

259
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:35,439
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

260
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you play EverQuest on a PlayStation 2?

261
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you don't have a good enough computer to run it, and you have to play a watered-down version.

262
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:44,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, I never knew that.

263
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:45,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is this EverQuest 2?

264
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:47,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was going to say, you can't really water down EverQuest 1.

265
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:50,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can.

266
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:51,885
[SPEAKER_06]: You can open up Microsoft Paint.

267
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:54,610
[SPEAKER_06]: and then just draw things there and it looks almost as good.

268
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anything else you've been playing this week?

269
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:07,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've been kind of sick and while I was waiting for Warsong Gulch to queue up, I just played a lot of a Wendon and cough on the screen.

270
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:09,277
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty terrible.

271
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:10,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Please tell me that's not my screen.

272
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:11,898
[SPEAKER_05]: My DS Lite.

273
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:14,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And know what else he played?

274
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:15,800
[SPEAKER_05]: You forgot to mention that.

275
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

276
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:34,126
[SPEAKER_05]: in the groove 2 oh yeah I played in the groove 2 oh yeah I forgot we were all at the Arcana I played in the groove 2 too I did not touch in the groove 2 other than to step on the panels which by the way the dance pad used to be a max 2 therefore it is still kosher you know it's like

277
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:36,664
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like pre-op, okay?

278
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:41,448
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's still DDR, it's just got stickers on it.

279
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:48,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate In The Groove and all, but they did get a couple really good songs, and the steps were fun for those songs.

280
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:54,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't touch, like, 98% of that game, but there are, like, three songs that I'll play.

281
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:02,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and here's the thing is that Miklatov, not only will he play those same three songs over and over, but then he'll, like, stand by the machine and try to get everybody else to play the same damn song.

282
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:03,392
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, play this, play this.

283
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no, goddammit, I want to find my own song to play.

284
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:07,433
[SPEAKER_04]: But you didn't want to find your own song.

285
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:08,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you'll pick a crappy trap song.

286
00:20:08,994 --> 00:20:13,335
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but what I was doing is I was going through all the songs, listening to clips, see if there's anything I wanted to play, and they're really...

287
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:14,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't a whole lot.

288
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:15,737
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be fair, I don't know.

289
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,779
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, I didn't know the songs that well.

290
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,260
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like three songs.

291
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:19,600
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

292
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I did DDR Supernova the first time, I did that too.

293
00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:22,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I went through the whole thing.

294
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:23,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't really know if I want to play.

295
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:24,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I want to play.

296
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:25,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Play Tierra Buena.

297
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:26,086
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the best.

298
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:26,606
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, forget it.

299
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:31,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's... We did play Cusar and that was awesome.

300
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:31,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Cusar.

301
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:32,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure it was awesome.

302
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:34,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Except not.

303
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into tonight.

304
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:39,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to LaserQuest back in Wichita for being better.

305
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:39,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Boo!

306
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,318
[SPEAKER_06]: LaserQuest sucks.

307
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:42,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get into the news tonight, please?

308
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

309
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:48,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Start off with a little PSP news, but unfortunately this might be a bit of bad news for some of you PSP fans.

310
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:53,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Target stores have recently pulled the UMD movies.

311
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:59,444
[SPEAKER_04]: GamePro recently got a scoop that UMDs are now being discontinued in all Target stores as of last week.

312
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:01,305
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

313
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:07,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, UMDs, $10 more expensive than a DVD, yet.

314
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:07,649
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

315
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:33,138
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

316
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:56,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so you think maybe it's a matter of Sony might go to this digital distribution thing for movies?

317
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:58,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they want to do digital distribution for everything.

318
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:07,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're a little sad that their UMD format didn't take off, which the only thing I did think was pretty good about it is the fact that it's covered in a plastic case and you can't

319
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:09,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

320
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:25,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

321
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:45,237
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still, though, I think that was a pretty cool idea, just because, you know, it's good for the rental market, but the whole packaging of UMD with, and by the way, these aren't exactly my favorite picks of movies, like, was it Hitch, Triple X, God, and there was, like, Stealth, and something else.

322
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:47,078
[SPEAKER_06]: They just won't let Stealth die.

323
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:49,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Stealth was a bad movie.

324
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:56,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to our chatroom, OrangeLunchRadio.com, and Maury says, I'm amazed they didn't drop them earlier, referring to the UMDs.

325
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:57,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're stubborn.

326
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:59,427
[SPEAKER_04]: They want their stuff to work.

327
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:02,209
[SPEAKER_04]: You bring up a good point, though, about the digital distribution here.

328
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:10,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody kind of is assuming, and it would make logical sense, that Apple, with their video iPods, are going to get into movie distribution by the end of the year.

329
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:18,939
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be the way that they sell iPods this Christmas is that video iPods will come out with a little larger of a screen and they're going to sell movies through the iTunes Music Store.

330
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:33,808
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, it's already somewhat been confirmed because I believe there's been news reports about Apple trying to negotiate with the movie companies and they don't want a flat rate for all the movies they want varying depending on how new the movie is and all that stuff.

331
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:37,014
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe Sony's just trying to beat them to the punch a little bit.

332
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:42,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hypothetically, Sony could set up like a PSP store to download movies on your stick.

333
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:44,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be kind of interesting if they could beat Apple to it.

334
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:46,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it would be enough.

335
00:23:47,504 --> 00:24:00,135
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you don't think of a lot of people don't think of, you know, a gamer might be different, but the normal average person probably doesn't think of, hey, if I'm going to go listen to music on the go, I'm going to use my PSP.

336
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:04,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the general public still views the PSP as a gaming system.

337
00:24:05,388 --> 00:24:06,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it basically is a gaming system.

338
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,529
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a gaming system that can also view movies if I want it.

339
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,370
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm tired of playing a game, I can pop in a movie.

340
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:18,792
[SPEAKER_05]: But to be honest, I don't want to sit for three hours or two hours in front of my PSP trying to watch a movie.

341
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:19,892
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not fun.

342
00:24:19,932 --> 00:24:26,054
[SPEAKER_05]: And even the Spider-Man 2 UMD that was in there with the PSP, I just don't care.

343
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:27,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's lame.

344
00:24:28,115 --> 00:24:28,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

345
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:30,898
[SPEAKER_05]: But, whatever.

346
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:37,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of things being pulled, Sony has actually pulled their PSP ad campaign in Netherlands.

347
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:43,121
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the one that's been getting people all pissed off with the fact that it's got black and white people in it.

348
00:24:43,261 --> 00:24:43,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

349
00:24:44,321 --> 00:24:46,561
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's got to be something racial about it.

350
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:54,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently, all the bitching and moaning by the US, which is stupid because they shouldn't have even been getting in the business anyways.

351
00:24:54,443 --> 00:24:55,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different country.

352
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,464
[SPEAKER_05]: But, they pulled it anyways.

353
00:24:58,224 --> 00:24:58,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And,

354
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:00,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

355
00:25:15,543 --> 00:25:17,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Go download last week's show, episode 190.

356
00:25:17,744 --> 00:25:26,507
[SPEAKER_04]: But we invited you guys in our voicemail of the week segment to leave your thoughts on what you thought about the whole controversy behind what was going on.

357
00:25:26,587 --> 00:25:28,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought we could play a couple voicemails.

358
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:32,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you guys left some really good points, but your voicemails were really, really long.

359
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:33,649
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have quite enough time to play them.

360
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:39,051
[SPEAKER_04]: But I enjoyed listening to them, and I will share them with DarkSakura and Loki later on.

361
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:43,673
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to play two kind of short feedback ones that I thought were pretty good here in our voicemails of the week.

362
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:44,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's voicemail number one.

363
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:46,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is Macman.

364
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:54,188
[SPEAKER_00]: And in response to your question, of course Sony isn't racist.

365
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:55,169
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just risky.

366
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:02,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the 10 years of passion sign or the take a running jump here on the subway sign?

367
00:26:03,435 --> 00:26:08,699
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done this before, except this time it involved two women of different color trying to kill each other.

368
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Sony got us, but the important part is, Sony got us to talk about the white PSP.

369
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, didn't they?

370
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,249
[SPEAKER_00]: See you on the flip side, Macman.

371
00:26:38,311 --> 00:26:38,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Catfights

372
00:26:58,777 --> 00:27:00,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just a good old-fashioned cat fight.

373
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:01,598
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good old-fashioned cat fight.

374
00:27:01,618 --> 00:27:08,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, I think the whole ad campaign was a bit skewed anyways because they did have like 100 different images.

375
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:12,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course the one where it shows the white person beating up on the black person.

376
00:27:12,623 --> 00:27:13,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, racist!

377
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:19,646
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, when it's the black person beating up on the white person, it's just... Oh my god, LA.

378
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:20,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do another.

379
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,468
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our last voicemail.

380
00:27:22,528 --> 00:27:24,108
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a couple short ones this week.

381
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:25,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear this next voicemail.

382
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there, this is Apollo from Nashville, Tennessee.

383
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,801
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just giving my thoughts on the whole Sony billboard ad thingamajig.

384
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:53,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say that I think since Sony's a worldwide company and they've got their hands all over the world, I think that they're perfectly aware that race is still a very controversial topic in many places, and I kind of think that they should be more cautious to make sure that they're not releasing advertisements that are obvious targets for criticism.

385
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:56,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess regardless, it did get released, so...

386
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:57,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

387
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think their message was that white is better than black.

388
00:28:00,224 --> 00:28:01,784
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that's what they intended to think.

389
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:04,805
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think they wanted to say that white people are better than black people.

390
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:08,045
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's kind of ridiculous that people are making a huge deal out of it.

391
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:10,206
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, 50 should have been watching for it.

392
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,307
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, that's just all I wanted to say.

393
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:14,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Love your guys' show.

394
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,027
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to hear from you soon.

395
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:16,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

396
00:28:17,107 --> 00:28:17,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the voicemail.

397
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:18,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very nice.

398
00:28:19,428 --> 00:28:24,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how that person says that Sony kind of knew what they were doing.

399
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

400
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:57,723
[SPEAKER_04]: But it also polarized the community in many different ways.

401
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,404
[SPEAKER_04]: So, any final thoughts on this issue?

402
00:29:00,184 --> 00:29:00,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

403
00:29:00,484 --> 00:29:02,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the whole issue was stupid to begin with.

404
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:08,487
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, you know, Sony is known for stupid ad campaigns sometimes.

405
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so is Microsoft, though.

406
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:10,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

407
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:14,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people that are advertising for video game systems really need to simplify things.

408
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:15,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Do what Nintendo does.

409
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, at least theirs, you know, they show...

410
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:47,591
[SPEAKER_04]: the games and you know here's what's on the DS Lite check it out you know and then people buy the DS Lite or buy you know whatever except no one bought the GameCube for that I don't know that's that whatever ad campaign they were doing for the GameCube just didn't work alright now if you'd like to leave us a voicemail our phone number is 916-226-9067 but please remember if you don't pay the phone bill please ask whoever does their permission before you call in because that's not an 800 number it's not a toll free call

411
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:52,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can always call us on Skype, username OrangeLoungeRadio when we are not live.

412
00:29:52,382 --> 00:29:53,563
[SPEAKER_04]: That way you get our voicemail.

413
00:29:53,803 --> 00:29:56,926
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like the whole Xbox 360 advertising campaign.

414
00:29:57,707 --> 00:29:58,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Jump in.

415
00:29:58,507 --> 00:29:59,128
[SPEAKER_05]: It made no sense.

416
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:00,609
[SPEAKER_05]: It had nothing to do with the Xbox 360.

417
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:03,031
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, people having fun, Xbox 360.

418
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:31,862
[SPEAKER_05]: and like I said before I probably mentioned this before we had a project in our high school economics class to create a product and make a commercial for it advertising the product and my friend he created took a bunch of clips from like different TV shows and showing explosions and stuff and just one big long montage set to music and the very end buy bumper stickers it was great because it it was just something to entertain you but it had nothing to do with the product

419
00:30:32,282 --> 00:31:00,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I helped my friends in Spanish class my senior year of high school they had to do a commercial but in Spanish so we did a condom commercial and they got an F for doing a condom commercial oh come on that's retarded but I remember because we were all sitting around the bed like we would film we just filmed the product on the bed and everybody was pushing the bed so it was going up and down and they failed but it was really funny and if that was on TV if that was on Univision I think it was funny

420
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:03,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, bitch teacher.

421
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:03,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, anyway.

422
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

423
00:31:06,301 --> 00:31:08,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, a voicemail topics for this week.

424
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:10,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give you guys a topic for this week.

425
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:11,843
[SPEAKER_04]: And it kind of goes into our next story here.

426
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:16,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a great blog piece that was on a website called Twitch Guru.

427
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:17,886
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually kind of old.

428
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:18,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an older piece.

429
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:21,387
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was picking up some notoriety on gaming blogs.

430
00:31:21,427 --> 00:31:24,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, literally, you'd have to go back to September of 2005 to see this piece.

431
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:27,210
[SPEAKER_04]: But for some reason, it was getting picked up by a bunch of sites this week.

432
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,450
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how it caught our attention.

433
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,951
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can ask this question.

434
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:31,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Any time.

435
00:31:31,186 --> 00:31:34,749
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of a timeless issue, yet it's not.

436
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Are video games getting easier?

437
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:38,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about it.

438
00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:44,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the 1980s, you had things like Pac-Man, where it was pretty hard to get far into that game.

439
00:31:44,797 --> 00:31:47,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, what's the furthest you've ever gotten Pac-Man?

440
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:48,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Or think about Ms.

441
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:48,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man.

442
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever gotten past the first two boards?

443
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:54,836
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how there's the pink board and there's the blue board?

444
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:58,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever gotten to the red boards or the ones that come later on?

445
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the old games there were really, really hard.

446
00:32:01,681 --> 00:32:05,204
[SPEAKER_04]: But games today don't seem to be as challenging.

447
00:32:05,264 --> 00:32:07,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be there's more finite, a way to finish them.

448
00:32:07,606 --> 00:32:14,551
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny, too, is a lot of those older games like Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man they see as approachable games for people, even though they are harder.

449
00:32:14,871 --> 00:32:15,472
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of funny.

450
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:18,494
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm curious, what do you guys think?

451
00:32:18,594 --> 00:32:20,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Are video games getting easier as time goes on?

452
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,391
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

453
00:32:53,191 --> 00:33:01,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the casual gamer buys the so-called casual games like Pac-Man, Galaga, Frogger, Gauntlet.

454
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:04,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, these were all harder games.

455
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:05,323
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

456
00:33:05,504 --> 00:33:07,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't get it.

457
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what it is is less complex games, maybe.

458
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:12,571
[SPEAKER_05]: They're

459
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:16,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Simpler concepts, but harder difficulty.

460
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:18,447
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, Pac-Man's easy.

461
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:19,968
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, gobble dots.

462
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:23,610
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of what the Wii's selling point is, right?

463
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick up the thing and go.

464
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:26,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, simple games.

465
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:29,753
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make a simple game that is really hard.

466
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:33,555
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, don't make it so complex with 52 buttons.

467
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:37,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's basically, you know, Pac-Man, pick up dots.

468
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:39,584
[SPEAKER_05]: and Eat Ghosts.

469
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:40,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty simple.

470
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:43,165
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even need to use a button, just a joystick for it.

471
00:33:43,225 --> 00:33:44,686
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

472
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:46,966
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw makes an interesting point in our chat room.

473
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:51,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the 80s, video games were more about getting high scores so you could enter your initials in the top 5 or 10.

474
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:57,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to have the top score on a moon patrol machine at the local pizza parlor.

475
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:57,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I rock.

476
00:33:58,655 --> 00:34:00,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we're curious about your thoughts on this.

477
00:34:00,396 --> 00:34:07,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Are video games getting easier or is this just where the market is headed and it's not that the games are getting easier?

478
00:34:07,082 --> 00:34:10,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you think about some really hard games that have come out like Ninja Gaiden and things.

479
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:17,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Are video games getting easier or is there just the misconception because games used to be a lot simpler?

480
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,551
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't as complex.

481
00:34:18,971 --> 00:34:22,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're really curious what you guys' thoughts are on that and we look forward to hearing your voicemails of the week.

482
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:25,476
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll play some of our favorites on next week's show.

483
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:26,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

484
00:34:27,256 --> 00:34:36,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, kind of speaking a little bit about difficulty, one thing that's been difficult is Sony selling the PlayStation 3 to all the gamers out there.

485
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:51,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one thing that they did supposedly make, and this was leaked out apparently, was this internal kind of almost like a Q&A for E3, for anybody that's working for Sony to be able to answer press questions about the PlayStation 3.

486
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:54,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought it was quite interesting, some of the things on there.

487
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,121
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the most interesting things on there is they are really stressing the fact that the PlayStation 3 is a computer.

488
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:06,202
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I think it mentions it about six or seven times in here, saying PlayStation 3 is a computer system.

489
00:35:06,902 --> 00:35:11,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they're also basically saying it's one product with different configurations.

490
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:15,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're trying to basically say, Sony, we can sell you a PlayStation 3.

491
00:35:16,404 --> 00:35:17,564
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like Dell.

492
00:35:18,064 --> 00:35:19,685
[SPEAKER_05]: We can build you a custom system.

493
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:29,452
[SPEAKER_05]: One interesting thing, though, about it is they're saying that the noise of the system is supposed to be about the same of a slim PS2, so, you know, pretty quiet.

494
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:36,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, of course, you know, kind of following up with what they said during E3, that it'll be able to support eight controllers.

495
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:42,596
[SPEAKER_05]: They're guessing maybe four wireless, four wired controllers.

496
00:35:43,116 --> 00:35:43,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Not sure.

497
00:35:45,737 --> 00:35:47,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And that the specs are pretty close to final.

498
00:35:48,544 --> 00:35:49,445
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of the other things.

499
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:56,010
[SPEAKER_05]: And that the Blu-ray drive is going to be BD Live compliant.

500
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:01,654
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, you'll be able to connect to the internet using some of the special features on the Blu-ray discs.

501
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:11,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of interesting, but I thought it was kind of funny though just how much they were stressing the PlayStation 3 being an actual computer system.

502
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:17,326
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, there were some interesting things on here including right here

503
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:23,507
[SPEAKER_05]: PS3 is being positioned as a computer system, not a computer entertainment system.

504
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:29,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Like other computer systems, it can be upgraded through the use of readily available industry standard adapters.

505
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:35,850
[SPEAKER_05]: They're basically saying any PC USB components you can use with this PlayStation 3.

506
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:45,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Another interesting thing on here is they were asking them the difference between Xbox Live and the PlayStation 3 Live.

507
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:48,333
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of dodged the question, which was kind of funny.

508
00:36:49,703 --> 00:36:52,404
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so it was pretty interesting.

509
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:53,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this comment in our chat room.

510
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:58,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Rini says, if the PlayStation 3 is a computer system, I want to run Word and Photoshop on it.

511
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know... Why not?

512
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:03,633
[SPEAKER_04]: If the PlayStation 3 is such a computer?

513
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:12,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they said that you can run Linux on it, and in fact, one of the questions is, will Linux OS be adopted as you have planned?

514
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:18,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says, yes, PS3 is a computer system, and Linux OS is adopted as one of the standard OSes.

515
00:37:19,242 --> 00:37:24,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Our chatroom also seems to be running with that story from a couple weeks ago where the controller is supposedly called the Poos.

516
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:31,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're calling it... I see DMN made a comment here where he says, HD DVD is greater than Pooray.

517
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:33,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're calling it Pooray.

518
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:35,315
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cute.

519
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:38,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And now even DJ Pooeater changed his name to Pooseater.

520
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:40,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

521
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I...

522
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:44,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I still say that story was a piece of poo.

523
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:45,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's true.

524
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see when it comes out.

525
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:49,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they probably won't call it the poos.

526
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:54,599
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll probably be like some infinity sign, something or other.

527
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone will call it poos.

528
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:00,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, Sony, if you're listening, just change the name.

529
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:00,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Just

530
00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:02,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Call it the PS3 controller.

531
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:03,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, it works.

532
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:10,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, one other PlayStation 3 thing that kind of left a lot of people with a question mark over their head was this trailer that they showed at E3.

533
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:11,315
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember?

534
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,960
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this trailer, and then there was all these animals that would come out.

535
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it was Africa was the big title, and the people were like... I mean, you could seriously... I remember we were all sitting at the...

536
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:35,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Arena Interactive Lounge, where a lot of the All Games contingent, us and some of our cousin shows that all broadcast on allgames.com were all kind of sitting around and watching the Sony thing and there was just this big collective

537
00:38:35,762 --> 00:38:37,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Fumitsu Magazine Revealed

538
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:05,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony Computer Entertainment's Daisaku Ikajiri is involved with the game's development.

539
00:39:06,187 --> 00:39:11,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Ikajiri has also worked on Hot Shots Golf 3, 4, Portable, and Online.

540
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:16,014
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this game may or may not have something in common with Hot Shots Golf.

541
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:17,755
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

542
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:18,916
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only detail you get.

543
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:20,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Africa.

544
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that sounds exciting.

545
00:39:24,952 --> 00:39:25,873
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I forgot to mention.

546
00:39:25,913 --> 00:39:30,419
[SPEAKER_04]: However, in light of recent events, I hope Sony really uses some tact when promoting this game.

547
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:35,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, one thing I forgot to mention in the last story.

548
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:41,254
[SPEAKER_05]: The one question, how the PS3 network service is going to be.

549
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:43,154
[SPEAKER_05]: will also start the service at day one.

550
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:46,116
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the differences between Xbox Live and the PS3 network services?

551
00:39:46,377 --> 00:39:48,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I'd just quote exactly what they said here.

552
00:39:48,698 --> 00:40:02,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Apart from providing basic features and functions, the most important element is content and services, downloading music in SingStar, purchasing or exchanging game data, as we demonstrated at the E3 press conference, and many other new ways of enjoyment, too, will be provided.

553
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:03,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that doesn't say anything.

554
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:09,074
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the fact that they're also saying that the PlayStation 3 will be only available in black.

555
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:10,815
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

556
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:33,332
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

557
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:02,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Interview here, one of the quotes that they were saying about Kaz, he blatantly said Microsoft is copying Sony.

558
00:41:02,806 --> 00:41:07,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, Phil Harrison's remark was, well, quotes can be taken out of contests.

559
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was the actual sentence, though.

560
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:15,615
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you take that out of context?

561
00:41:15,675 --> 00:41:17,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that seems pretty clear to me.

562
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:18,396
[SPEAKER_05]: But, anyways...

563
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:24,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he didn't like the fact that they were asking him hard questions, which I thought was pretty funny.

564
00:41:24,697 --> 00:41:32,439
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, you gotta feel sorry for that Phil Harrison guy, because, I mean, I remember when they were first talking about the PlayStation 3 before we knew anything, you know, about the price.

565
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:43,022
[SPEAKER_05]: It, you know, he's got to cover up for all these, like, you know, higher-ups that are saying really dumb shit every week, and you gotta feel bad for him.

566
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

567
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:45,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

568
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:50,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should just move on to some Xbox news for a little bit here.

569
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:52,957
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is kind of interesting.

570
00:41:53,318 --> 00:41:57,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we already knew this, but the Xbox has been officially discontinued.

571
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:03,420
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's a rumor going around, but honestly, seeing as I can't seem to find a new Xbox for sale anywhere.

572
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,121
[SPEAKER_05]: If I remember correctly, the Xbox has been officially discontinued.

573
00:42:06,181 --> 00:42:09,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking about 360, I'm talking about the regular old school Xbox.

574
00:42:10,282 --> 00:42:10,582
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's...

575
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:28,225
[SPEAKER_04]: The other rumor that's kind of interesting to note is that there is a new Xbox 360 Pro bundle being prepared by Microsoft, supposedly, that has Project Gotham Racing 3 included with it, along with a 1,250 Microsoft point card and a three-month subscription to Xbox Live Gold.

576
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,031
[SPEAKER_04]: and it will run you $399.

577
00:42:30,932 --> 00:42:34,595
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's not mentioned there is does that include the hard drive?

578
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:37,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming it does because in order to get on live you've got to have a hard drive.

579
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

580
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:41,841
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you going to spend the points with no hard drive?

581
00:42:43,302 --> 00:42:43,603
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

582
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:45,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you lose the cables?

583
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:46,845
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

584
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:47,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

585
00:42:47,646 --> 00:42:49,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what they'll do is they'll probably just put that out.

586
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,728
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just going to be a bundle.

587
00:42:52,148 --> 00:42:59,812
[SPEAKER_05]: You won't be able to find the system by itself and then it'll be just coming with that game and stuff instead of the premium bundle or premium system.

588
00:43:00,032 --> 00:43:02,633
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100, Matt makes an interesting observation in chat room.

589
00:43:02,673 --> 00:43:06,695
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny that the PlayStation 1 lasted longer in production than the original Xbox.

590
00:43:09,877 --> 00:43:10,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know.

591
00:43:11,858 --> 00:43:16,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it doesn't happen because that sucks for us because we have a stockpile of like a thousand units and

592
00:43:18,193 --> 00:43:20,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter 2, Galaga Frogger and Pac-Man

593
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:53,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going to be releasing them every Wednesday, starting with, well, last Wednesday when Frogger came out.

594
00:43:53,823 --> 00:43:57,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week you can look forward to cloning Clyde, which will be pretty fun.

595
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:00,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course Galaga following on the 26th.

596
00:44:01,593 --> 00:44:03,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter 2 on August 2nd.

597
00:44:04,134 --> 00:44:05,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure this time?

598
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we sure this time?

599
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:09,357
[SPEAKER_05]: This is official press release from Microsoft.

600
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:10,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Freaking better be.

601
00:44:10,497 --> 00:44:11,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Last chance.

602
00:44:11,578 --> 00:44:13,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And Pac-Man on August 9th.

603
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:17,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe shortly after that there'll be some more stuff coming out.

604
00:44:17,461 --> 00:44:21,543
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're trying to do it every week or so.

605
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,124
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be releasing a new title.

606
00:44:23,364 --> 00:44:25,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And not very expensive.

607
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:27,726
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be about $5 to $10.

608
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter 2 being $10.

609
00:44:29,106 --> 00:44:30,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Same with Cloning Clyde.

610
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:30,867
[SPEAKER_05]: everything else is $5.

611
00:44:30,987 --> 00:44:37,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I have this random thought because we were talking earlier about our video games getting easier and we were talking about the retro games.

612
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:45,492
[SPEAKER_04]: It does seem like these retro games are really making a comeback slowly but surely with all these retro collections we saw.

613
00:44:45,753 --> 00:44:53,795
[SPEAKER_04]: The Atari, the Intellivision Lives, the Midway collections and now Xbox Live Arcade sort of getting some new life to the retro games as well.

614
00:44:54,756 --> 00:44:57,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that possibly because people feel that

615
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:00,443
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX Live is finally getting some new stuff, so...

616
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully even more arcade releases by the end of the year.

617
00:45:23,444 --> 00:45:31,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not only are there releases in the arcade category, but they're also getting some releases in some of the video and movie categories as well.

618
00:45:31,568 --> 00:45:33,149
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I actually downloaded this this week.

619
00:45:33,529 --> 00:45:38,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Halo 3 in the Beginning was released on Xbox Live this week.

620
00:45:38,991 --> 00:45:48,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Halo 3 in the Beginning, basically what it is, it's a trailer about making the teaser announcement for Halo 3.

621
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:50,277
[SPEAKER_04]: A trailer of a trailer.

622
00:45:50,377 --> 00:45:52,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's a trailer about the making of a trailer.

623
00:45:52,858 --> 00:45:57,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not even like the real trailer, it's the teaser trailer.

624
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:04,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in a way I'm kind of going, this is just like the biggest self-ego inflation piece I've ever seen on a video game console.

625
00:46:07,262 --> 00:46:16,212
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I don't know, at the same time, I downloaded it because it's free, and I'm like, oh, this is pretty, and it's HD, and I'll watch anything in HD because it's pretty, especially when it has to do with gaming.

626
00:46:16,453 --> 00:46:21,899
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did find it was fascinating, I mean, all the freaking work that went into making just that, you know...

627
00:46:22,782 --> 00:46:28,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'd spend the $4,000 on the plasma screen for it, but if I had a 70-inch plasma screen, you know, a next-gen...

628
00:46:51,543 --> 00:46:53,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Video device would look pretty nice on it.

629
00:46:53,604 --> 00:47:03,347
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can actually see some of the details, like the little individual hairs on a flower and stuff like that.

630
00:47:03,827 --> 00:47:05,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Just an insane amount of detail.

631
00:47:06,428 --> 00:47:09,609
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, someone just joined us who wants to comment on all this.

632
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:12,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, hi, everybody.

633
00:47:13,036 --> 00:47:13,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, DarkSakura!

634
00:47:13,656 --> 00:47:15,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I am literally just off the road.

635
00:47:15,978 --> 00:47:19,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I had a conversation with DMN when I did my Tuesday show.

636
00:47:19,721 --> 00:47:24,886
[SPEAKER_02]: He mentioned that basically the HD DVD was blowing away Blu-ray for quality.

637
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:28,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're about neck and neck, if I remember correctly.

638
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:36,435
[SPEAKER_05]: But even still, I was asking about the 1080p plasma screens out there, and they didn't have too many at the store.

639
00:47:36,455 --> 00:47:37,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they carried a lot of stuff.

640
00:47:38,337 --> 00:47:38,557
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

641
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:40,182
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

642
00:48:06,596 --> 00:48:07,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't I always?

643
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:08,478
[SPEAKER_02]: At least she admits it.

644
00:48:08,498 --> 00:48:09,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazingly enough, all the bad drivers were male.

645
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:14,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

646
00:48:15,003 --> 00:48:21,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially the one who was tailgating the person in front of him, skidded off the side of the road, and blew a rock into my windshield.

647
00:48:21,528 --> 00:48:25,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I forgot we had somebody else on your mic, so I want to make sure we're not blowing the audience away there.

648
00:48:25,551 --> 00:48:26,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

649
00:48:26,191 --> 00:48:28,193
[SPEAKER_02]: With the awesomeness of my voice.

650
00:48:28,353 --> 00:48:28,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

651
00:48:30,154 --> 00:48:30,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

652
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, well, how was your gaming week?

653
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:33,537
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to get that out?

654
00:48:33,957 --> 00:48:34,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

655
00:48:34,257 --> 00:48:39,081
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week actually was a lot of Animal Crossing and a lot of pinball.

656
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:40,622
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of pinball.

657
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:43,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I played so much pinball last weekend.

658
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:46,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it just that show that you called us from last week?

659
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that and playing pinball in my garage.

660
00:48:48,836 --> 00:48:50,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you end up buying any new machines?

661
00:48:50,717 --> 00:48:56,759
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not, and actually we lost out on the Black Knight 2000 we were going to get because we went back to check on it and it had been sold to somebody else for $600!

662
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you believe it?

663
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yikes.

664
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:06,123
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are working on a World Cup Soccer 94, which is actually one of my favorite machines for nostalgia value.

665
00:49:07,084 --> 00:49:07,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

666
00:49:08,303 --> 00:49:14,651
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually, two of our triggers on our last action hero broke, so we have to replace that before we can keep playing it.

667
00:49:15,592 --> 00:49:19,177
[SPEAKER_02]: But Dan got our roulette working on our whodunit pinball, so that's awesome.

668
00:49:19,237 --> 00:49:20,138
[SPEAKER_02]: It now completely works.

669
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:20,959
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

670
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:21,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds fun.

671
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And I play a lot of eyeball crossing.

672
00:49:23,823 --> 00:49:27,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a note that our chat room here is just, they're celebrating that you're back.

673
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,233
[SPEAKER_04]: DMN says, nice of you to show up, DarkSakura.

674
00:49:31,253 --> 00:49:31,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey!

675
00:49:32,334 --> 00:49:33,835
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think you meant that in a good way, though.

676
00:49:33,855 --> 00:49:34,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hi.

677
00:49:34,435 --> 00:49:35,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see, what else?

678
00:49:35,996 --> 00:49:38,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Mori says, yay, DarkSakura's around again.

679
00:49:38,197 --> 00:49:38,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is fun.

680
00:49:39,478 --> 00:49:40,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Life is always fun with me here.

681
00:49:40,558 --> 00:49:41,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a party every day.

682
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And then somebody referred to, oh, Dark Knight said, DarkSakura is the queen of the show.

683
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:47,482
[SPEAKER_04]: All hail the OLR queen.

684
00:49:47,862 --> 00:49:50,964
[SPEAKER_04]: And then DMN followed that up with, I thought Skye was the queen of the show.

685
00:49:52,185 --> 00:49:52,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw you.

686
00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:54,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

687
00:49:54,806 --> 00:49:55,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Only on special occasions.

688
00:49:57,489 --> 00:49:59,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well anyways, back to the new stuff.

689
00:50:00,891 --> 00:50:04,634
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that actually happened this week was EA's Summer Showcase.

690
00:50:05,415 --> 00:50:11,539
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's basically kind of like their little press event that they have showcasing their brand new titles that are going to be coming out.

691
00:50:12,419 --> 00:50:19,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And the top of the showcase, of course, the next-gen version of Half-Life 2, which is going to be on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

692
00:50:20,205 --> 00:50:25,569
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty interesting that that's been confirmed and not too much of a surprise since, you know, it's going to be...

693
00:50:27,421 --> 00:50:28,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, I can't remember.

694
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:58,106
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, yeah, lots of good stuff.

695
00:50:58,126 --> 00:50:59,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Team Fortress 2, that's what it was.

696
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So, pretty cool.

697
00:51:02,888 --> 00:51:09,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, for those of you guys listening live here on this Sunday evening, we all got booted from chat because we had too many of us trying to hit the chatroom at once.

698
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:12,131
[SPEAKER_04]: All four of us here in the room, we're all in the chatroom.

699
00:51:12,631 --> 00:51:16,593
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got booted from the server, so it's probably going to be a few more minutes before we get back in.

700
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:20,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So, apologize for that, you guys, and we'll work on that at least throughout the break.

701
00:51:21,632 --> 00:51:24,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, we've just got to keep it running here, so I'm going to go to the next story here.

702
00:51:24,895 --> 00:51:30,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Every Xtend Extra has a demo that's been released, and it's only for the PC.

703
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:36,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So even though this game is going to be coming out for the PSP, you can only get the demo on your PC.

704
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,065
[SPEAKER_04]: That's stupid.

705
00:51:37,145 --> 00:51:44,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing, though, is that every Xtend was actually a PC game way back in the day, so I'm assuming that every Xtend Extra is also coming out for the PC.

706
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:49,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, why don't they do another PSP demo, because I know that they had what...

707
00:51:50,356 --> 00:52:00,678
[SPEAKER_05]: LocoRoco, and, you know, there was some, well, in Japan there was, like, some Sudoku demo and stuff like that, but that's about it.

708
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:07,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this brand new feature that they add to the PSP and they do nothing with, excellent use of the PSP.

709
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:17,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, no one really wants demos to download off the internet, of course, because, you know, Xbox Live's Marketplace, demos, just, no one ever downloads those.

710
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:26,473
[SPEAKER_05]: and especially with the PSP needing people to buy some of this software out there because there hasn't really been that many great games lately.

711
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:28,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

712
00:52:29,673 --> 00:52:31,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Just hear me rant some more.

713
00:52:33,454 --> 00:52:33,774
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

714
00:52:34,214 --> 00:52:35,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's go to another story here.

715
00:52:36,675 --> 00:52:42,696
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that our music game fans... I'm kind of mad that we're booted from chat right now because I really would love to get reaction to this.

716
00:52:43,296 --> 00:52:43,716
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway...

717
00:52:45,012 --> 00:52:49,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami has filed a patent for the title Guitar Revolution.

718
00:52:50,456 --> 00:52:57,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what's interesting about this is that a lot of people are saying, oh, well, this means that Konami is planning to compete with Guitar Hero.

719
00:52:57,301 --> 00:53:01,084
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to go directly head-to-head with Guitar Hero.

720
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:08,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people seem to be neglecting the fact that Konami had a game, Guitar Game Out, in Japan for quite some time.

721
00:53:08,854 --> 00:53:09,914
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

722
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Here in the US for quite some time.

723
00:53:28,137 --> 00:53:30,838
[SPEAKER_04]: But now they've gone and trademarked the name Guitar Revolution.

724
00:53:31,198 --> 00:53:40,621
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would indicate if they are planning to revive the franchise here in the US, they're going to change the name of it to fit DDR, you know, Dance Dance Revolution and Karaoke Revolution and all that good stuff.

725
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:49,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, just because they patented the name doesn't mean that they are going to make it.

726
00:53:49,985 --> 00:53:51,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they could just be

727
00:53:52,046 --> 00:53:53,628
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a concept thing at this time.

728
00:53:53,668 --> 00:53:55,750
[SPEAKER_04]: They just don't want anyone else to jump in on it.

729
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:01,575
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I don't know, it kind of looks like they could be prepping for a new game.

730
00:54:01,595 --> 00:54:03,417
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, Loki?

731
00:54:03,777 --> 00:54:04,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

732
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:09,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it makes sense, especially with the success of Guitar Hero.

733
00:54:09,402 --> 00:54:11,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it would be something that they would probably want to do.

734
00:54:12,901 --> 00:54:13,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

735
00:54:13,241 --> 00:54:19,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the whole problem before is they didn't know how to market Guitar Freaks to the people.

736
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:25,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And now that they've seen how it's basically been done, they can kind of go from there.

737
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:26,853
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

738
00:54:27,253 --> 00:54:31,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to ask Miklatov if we can get him a mic real quick.

739
00:54:31,457 --> 00:54:32,478
[SPEAKER_04]: He had to move a little bit there.

740
00:54:32,698 --> 00:54:33,158
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

741
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:33,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

742
00:54:34,543 --> 00:54:46,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you can't really talk a whole lot about this because you work at Konami or whatever, but surely you must have some thoughts on the reaction out there that people are having to this?

743
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:47,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally do.

744
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:56,416
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I'd like to say that my opinions do not reflect Konami's opinions, just a lot of people that work there.

745
00:54:56,696 --> 00:54:57,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Or our opinion.

746
00:54:58,257 --> 00:54:58,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, whoever.

747
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,740
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my opinion and that's what I'm sticking to.

748
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

749
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:14,672
[SPEAKER_06]: So, when this Guitar Revolution stuff came out, a wonderfully crappy site named 1up.com decided that one of their idiots would write about it.

750
00:55:16,153 --> 00:55:19,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And his name is Jared Rhea, just so everybody knows.

751
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:22,118
[SPEAKER_06]: He also goes by Slip, I think?

752
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:23,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

753
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:24,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't pay attention to him.

754
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:25,921
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

755
00:55:27,443 --> 00:55:38,727
[SPEAKER_06]: What he did in his little blog post is pretty much say how our company actually works internally, which he doesn't know, because he doesn't work there.

756
00:55:39,347 --> 00:55:40,587
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty libelous.

757
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:51,831
[SPEAKER_06]: And he also decided to bash on the DDR team that's in America, saying that we care more about what songs we get in the game.

758
00:55:52,398 --> 00:55:57,701
[SPEAKER_06]: rather than the quality, which is not true because we can't do anything about quality or songs.

759
00:55:58,281 --> 00:56:00,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So, he's a moron.

760
00:56:00,663 --> 00:56:15,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, apparently really recently, maybe today, I don't know how to read dates, he talks about how he and one of my co-workers are pretty... I'll read, read, read, read, read.

761
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:21,674
[SPEAKER_06]: That he's taking credit for being a catalyst...

762
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:34,420
[SPEAKER_06]: to the DDR revolution sort of thing in America, and that he's one of the people that is behind the scenes making everyone move their feet, to quote his blog post.

763
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's not.

764
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,001
[SPEAKER_06]: He never worked at Konami.

765
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:41,263
[SPEAKER_06]: All he is is this whiny little punk that worked at 1up.com.

766
00:56:41,303 --> 00:56:42,663
[SPEAKER_06]: He no longer does, it looks like.

767
00:56:43,864 --> 00:56:48,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And I pretty much hate his guts.

768
00:56:49,046 --> 00:56:49,786
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's an idiot.

769
00:56:50,743 --> 00:56:57,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I could say a whole lot more, but it would involve a lot of cussing, and since I don't do that, I can't say any more.

770
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:03,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me try to go back to the topic at hand, because I'm trying to not go there.

771
00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:05,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go there.

772
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:06,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you will.

773
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think.

774
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:08,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

775
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:28,347
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the public, you have these people that are very vocal about, especially I noticed within the Groove fans, I'm not talking about this blogger, but like in the Groove fans have this huge misconception about the way DDR is made in America.

776
00:57:29,005 --> 00:57:35,007
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the biggest misconceptions people have of Konami in general and the way that they're making their games, if there's anything you can say on that?

777
00:57:35,107 --> 00:57:37,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's anything I can actually say about that.

778
00:57:37,447 --> 00:57:41,769
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, I think... I was going to beat him up.

779
00:57:42,089 --> 00:57:49,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Miklatov got us started on a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio called the FUs of the Week.

780
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:00,419
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

781
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:38,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to say a big F you, and not really a problem I have anymore, to my old couch.

782
00:58:39,729 --> 00:58:41,869
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucked, and it's gone.

783
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:45,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Dump that piece of shit in the landfill.

784
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:47,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a nice new couch now.

785
00:58:50,392 --> 00:58:50,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

786
00:58:51,953 --> 00:58:53,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Nikolatov, do you have anything additional?

787
00:58:54,953 --> 00:58:59,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to say an F you to 1up.com for being a terrible, terrible site.

788
00:59:00,683 --> 00:59:02,864
[SPEAKER_06]: and for hiring people that have no skill.

789
00:59:04,185 --> 00:59:12,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd also like to clarify that views and... Yeah, like all views and opinions of our guests do not reflect those of the rest of us, but... Okay.

790
00:59:14,211 --> 00:59:14,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

791
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:15,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not done.

792
00:59:15,691 --> 00:59:16,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what else?

793
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:25,497
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to Lopedis Golf Land because they put all their dancing games right next to each other, so now...

794
00:59:25,942 --> 00:59:32,126
[SPEAKER_06]: If I want to go play Pump, I have to weed through the Supernova people and the Groove people, which are taking up way too much space for me.

795
00:59:32,646 --> 00:59:34,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I saw a Pump Zero machine in Reno yesterday.

796
00:59:34,967 --> 00:59:35,668
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really fun.

797
00:59:35,748 --> 00:59:36,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play it.

798
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:40,030
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I want to give an FU to this week?

799
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:43,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'll give an FU to Reno for robbing me of $40 from their slot machines.

800
00:59:43,992 --> 00:59:48,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Reno was supposed to have better slot machines than the Indian casinos we have here, but I suppose not.

801
00:59:51,397 --> 00:59:53,938
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to those one-armed bandits taking money from me.

802
00:59:54,618 --> 00:59:55,579
[SPEAKER_04]: They're supposed to give me money.

803
00:59:56,172 --> 00:59:56,672
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not fair.

804
00:59:58,353 --> 00:59:59,934
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get back into some news here.

805
01:00:00,174 --> 01:00:02,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we are still locked out of the chat room.

806
01:00:02,535 --> 01:00:03,576
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot we can do.

807
01:00:03,616 --> 01:00:06,457
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just kind of going to try and keep getting back in there.

808
01:00:06,517 --> 01:00:07,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll be hopefully back soon.

809
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:08,999
[SPEAKER_04]: So meanwhile.

810
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:11,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, excellent.

811
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,922
[SPEAKER_05]: But meanwhile, I'd like to talk to you guys.

812
01:00:16,972 --> 01:00:21,635
[SPEAKER_05]: about Take-Two and how they just constantly like to get in the trouble.

813
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:26,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this time, they're in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

814
01:00:27,158 --> 01:00:31,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And this, luckily, has nothing to do with the whole hot coffee thing.

815
01:00:31,921 --> 01:00:39,645
[SPEAKER_05]: But it actually has to do with the stock option grants that are made by the company from 1997 to the present.

816
01:00:39,685 --> 01:00:40,406
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, they're just

817
01:00:45,862 --> 01:00:47,563
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not having a good day.

818
01:00:48,323 --> 01:00:50,525
[SPEAKER_05]: And they really need another Grand Theft Auto to come out.

819
01:00:51,445 --> 01:00:59,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And they better not fuck up the network gameplay on Vice City Stories or I will be pissed.

820
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:04,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I will fly my ass down there and beat the crap out of them personally.

821
01:01:08,174 --> 01:01:09,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate those network programmers.

822
01:01:09,495 --> 01:01:10,616
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it, they were so lazy.

823
01:01:13,197 --> 01:01:14,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, moving on.

824
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:22,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of programming, Hellgate London, the source code has been stolen and leaked to the internet.

825
01:01:22,389 --> 01:01:36,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like some other games out there, but apparently someone on the inside stole the... I remember seeing this at E3, the Hellgate London game, but didn't really play it.

826
01:01:37,455 --> 01:01:37,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

827
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:38,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

828
01:01:38,456 --> 01:01:40,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Hacker Strike again.

829
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:40,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

830
01:01:41,717 --> 01:01:41,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

831
01:01:43,478 --> 01:01:43,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

832
01:01:45,444 --> 01:01:48,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to another story here, speaking of kind of London-ish.

833
01:01:48,725 --> 01:01:49,546
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the UK.

834
01:01:49,586 --> 01:01:50,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the government in the UK.

835
01:01:52,307 --> 01:01:57,088
[SPEAKER_04]: The British government is actually going to be organizing a census to track the game industry's growth.

836
01:01:57,849 --> 01:02:03,151
[SPEAKER_04]: The survey is being administered by Skill Set, and this is an entertainment research group.

837
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:10,013
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they're going to do is they're going to gather data, and this could actually influence decisions made by the parliament later on.

838
01:02:10,474 --> 01:02:14,135
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a quote from the creative director of Eidos Interactive saying,

839
01:02:14,655 --> 01:02:16,716
[SPEAKER_04]: The census is a headcount of the industry.

840
01:02:17,076 --> 01:02:22,178
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps Skill Set influence government, policymakers, and public funds for the benefit and support of the industry.

841
01:02:23,058 --> 01:02:27,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Skill Set will be going out to company managing directors and human resource departments.

842
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can also, if you happen to be one of these people, you can do it online.

843
01:02:31,401 --> 01:02:33,301
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available on the Skill Set website.

844
01:02:33,361 --> 01:02:37,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It's skillset.org slash research slash census.

845
01:02:37,383 --> 01:02:40,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll start the result calculating on July 12th.

846
01:02:40,464 --> 01:02:40,504
[SPEAKER_04]: So...
