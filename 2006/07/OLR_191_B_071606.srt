Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,500
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 191 for this July 16th, 2006.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,700
I think we got some of our chatroom issues from part A, at least we have a temporary fix tonight.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,860
Alright so hello to the chat room, we missed you guys during the very interesting second

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,380
half of our part A this week.

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,980
But our aim is improving.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,420
Yes, and Dark Sakura is here, back in the house.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,220
She visited us in the middle of part A there a little bit earlier than she anticipated

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,580
getting back.

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,660
She's here now to share some stories with you during part B. But not just yet, because

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,140
I have a video game story I'd like to share first.

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,400
Is that okay, Dark Sakura?

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
It's about the Wii!

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
I guess.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:04,960
Toys R Us in Australia is taking pre-orders for the Wii at what equates to $249 U.S.,

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,320
but what's very interesting about this deal is that that comes with a free game.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,880
So folks are speculating that this is pretty much proving that the Wii is going to come

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,880
with a pack-in game, which doesn't come as too much of a surprise.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,200
But if you consider, we haven't had a lot of pack-in games at launch for our console

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,200
in quite a long time, so that's kind of interesting.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,920
And of course, many, many folks are speculating that it's going to be Wii Sports as the pack-in

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
title.

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,920
I mean, what a perfect pack-in title that would be for the Wii, because that would give

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,300
you a little taste of everything what the Wii can do.

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,240
And you know, if you think about it, that's one thing that they kind of sold at the Nintendo

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,880
press conference as well.

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,200
Remember that guy who won the contest?

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,420
Remember when they flew all those guys to LA and then only let one come up on stage

32
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,620
to play?

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,060
It was Wii Sports, the tennis game.

34
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,120
And Wii Tennis, I mean, it's fun, but it's not going to be a great tennis sim.

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,320
It's really there to just show off what the Wii can do.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,800
So I couldn't see spending money on Wii Sports, but I think it would be a fun pack-in title.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,840
I think it would be good because it's also one of those titles that kind of shows you

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,640
what the Wii can do and kind of orients you to using the controller and that type of stuff.

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,760
And you could put a lot of those stupid tech demos and crap that they had on there because

40
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,560
they were fun, stupid games that you could just put on this collection.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,460
not even call it Wii Sports, just have it, I don't know, be something.

42
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,280
Maury in our chat room seems to think that World Class TrackMe needs to have a Wii version.

43
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,560
I honestly think that Wii Sports sort of smacks of the Super Scope games.

44
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,640
How so?

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,840
It just had the multi-games to show off the different things you could play with the Super

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,440
Scope like Blastris and that really weird mole game.

47
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,320
Yeah, I like the mole game though, that was fun. It just makes me think of that.

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,000
Um, alright, well that's all I have to say on my story for the Wii.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,840
Okay, well speaking of the Wii, there's been another

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,360
another secret flap that's been spotted.

51
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,480
How is this like the third or fourth secret flap that's on the Wii?

52
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,640
Boy, the Wii must sure be feeling like it's, you know, getting violated all over

53
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,960
left and right with people looking in every flap they can find.

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,000
The Wii has compartments everywhere. I see.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,960
But um, no idea what it is. Um, looks like

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:23,360
a SD card port, but it's a really odd position for it. Let me put it that way. What do I

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,260
think it is? I think it might be just nothing. I think it's just maybe, it's a flap for nothing?

58
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,900
I think it actually is not a flap, I think it's just kind of a hole that would be for,

59
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,280
because it's at the very very bottom of the console. I mean if this were going to be in

60
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,200
their little docking bay or whatever it is.

61
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,280
I don't think you'd be able to access this panel, but my guess is it's probably just

62
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,080
for the docking station, it's probably a clip so the whole thing snaps in so it doesn't

63
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
come loose.

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,660
That's my thought on that, I don't know.

65
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,640
No idea what it is, but to be honest I don't care.

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,200
It's not like some super duper secret thing, yeah VR is hidden in the tiny little thing

67
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
right there.

68
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,600
I don't think these flaps are going to have these earth-shattering new features.

69
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,200
I think it's just going to be for plugs, cards, you know, things you can stick in your Wii.

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,600
Because, yeah, even looking at this right now, the actual picture that they show of

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
this said flap doesn't even look like a flap.

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,160
It just looks like a part in the console where it might snap in.

73
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,200
That's all it is.

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Yeah.

75
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,640
Alright, now Dark Soccer, I know you have some stuff you want to share with the Wii

76
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,460
with us too, but I also understand you have a special shout out you want to give, so please

77
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,280
get that out before you move on.

78
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,000
To one of my really good friends' friends, her name is Larissa.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,160
She was in a car accident a few days ago.

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,440
I'd like to give a big shout out, and I don't think she's listening being that she's currently

81
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,920
in the hospital, but for anyone who's listening who knows her, pass on that we wish her a

82
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,880
very quick recovery and glad she's coming out of it okay.

83
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Absolutely.

84
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,200
get out of the hospital fast because I know hospitals are not a fun place to be

85
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,360
so please get well soon

86
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,880
very much. Well as far as

87
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,360
the story that I have there's actually some more

88
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,200
games being mentioned that's coming out for

89
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,600
Wii actually specifically from EA. Well there's also Need for Speed Carbon in

90
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,760
Madden NFL but

91
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,200
they're also announcing Tiger Woods, Godfather, SSX and Harry Potter coming

92
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,520
out

93
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,760
I wouldn't mind you know. Oh goody am I gonna get to cast spells with the Wii controller?

94
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,960
That would actually be cool you know if you have to wave it a certain way that would be...

95
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,880
You're a Harry Potter nerd what's the little

96
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,760
spells, give me some of the spells they say like what makes the light

97
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,400
luminous or something what do they say? Lumos. Lumos?

98
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,240
Yeah. Can you imagine being able to do that? And if the Wii had a microphone in it too?

99
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,360
That would be perfect. Use voice recognition. Oh my gosh

100
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,760
Harry Potter fangirls everywhere are gonna like never leave the house. Isn't that going to be a microphone attachment?

101
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,360
yeah they say that the we my well I don't think it's confirmed has a speaker

102
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,760
in it we all know that for me three but

103
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,000
it's a groomer that a speaker could easily be a microphone so why not have a

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,040
microphone on it too I don't think we have confirmation on that yet though but

105
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,120
imagine if it did have a microphone you could you know

106
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,400
say you know luminous and move the move the

107
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,520
thing and then you might even hear the spell come from the wand and it would

108
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,480
even vibrate

109
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,680
how crazy is that that would be special special it might

110
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,160
You might need to go Ruminos for it to, uh, cause it doesn't understand some of the-

111
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,980
That's right, if it's gonna be like, uh, brain training where you have to say,

112
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,680
BREW! BREW!

113
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,280
I swear it works! I swear it- go back to the OLR archives where I review brain training.

114
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,280
It really works. If you- if you are having a hard time getting your DS to understand you saying blue,

115
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,780
say BREW! And it works. Every time. At least for me. Exactly.

116
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,780
So that's pretty awesome.

117
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,280
But, some of those games I'm actually pretty- pretty cool. I- I wonder how SXX is gonna control.

118
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Maybe Godfather you could just go around shooting people.

119
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,280
I think it's really interesting with all these Wii game announcements that our first thoughts are

120
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,280
I wonder what it's going to play like on the Wii. I wonder what that controller is going to do for that game.

121
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Or how that's going to be different because of that whole Wii thing.

122
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
This is very interesting how...

123
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,280
I hope they're good because all it's going to take is a couple games that suck with that kind of controller configuration for people to go

124
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
Ah, dammit.

125
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,280
But every console has shitty games. I say the other way around.

126
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,280
If you have a few stellar games it's really going to sell that console.

127
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
It's all fun.

128
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,380
There's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of crap games on every console that doesn't

129
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,380
ruin it for them.

130
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,760
There's, you know, PS2, wonderful console, legendary console to be remembered for years

131
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,400
and years, has some real shit games on it.

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,920
Well, you know what's something that's occurring to me is that with, there's mentioning a Tiger

133
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,840
Woods game, what's stopping them from making like mocap golf?

134
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,460
Or even police 911?

135
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,460
With the Wii.

136
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,460
Maybe?

137
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,460
I don't know.

138
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,680
I think those are franchises that our developer friends should be looking into.

139
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,420
Speaking of the Wii though, and other fun things about it, IGN has actually come in

140
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:08,480
contact with a Wii developer documentation, like kind of a little pamphlet that basically

141
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,400
explains to developers how the Wii works, and some of the fun little details about it.

142
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,120
One of the things that's pretty interesting is there's going to be 6 kilobytes of non-volatile

143
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:29,840
memory in each controller. And the speculation is that it's possible that that will be for

144
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,240
storing player settings. So if you're a person that uses controller 1 all the time, it's

145
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,440
going to remember your settings and that's kind of neat. But other than that, they're

146
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,280
They're also mentioning that the sensor bar itself is only going to be about 20 centimeters

147
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:54,360
long and pretty much the LEDs I guess on the Wii controller and stuff are going to be for

148
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,960
battery life and show you that kind of stuff.

149
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,560
Also that light sources from fluorescent halogen plastic mirrors and many more interfere with

150
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,960
the actual pointer.

151
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,340
Oh interesting.

152
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,800
But to eliminate this though the actual inter...

153
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Don't play in a spaceship.

154
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,000
To eliminate this, it says the pointer must identify the sensor bar and mark its two coordinates.

155
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,700
And when pointing with the Wiimote, the unit is actually interfacing with the sensor bar,

156
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,480
which translates the data to the television and in effect simulating a direct aim to the

157
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
television.

158
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,880
So, in a sense, it's basically comparing it to an eye measuring the coordinates between

159
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,880
0 and 1023 on the x-axis and 0 and 767 on the y-axis. So it's basically seeing like

160
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,560
a megapixel image or something like that. So it's kinda neat. And it says the pointer

161
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,680
could sub as a camera. Probably like a Pokemon Snap game. Boy that controller will do your

162
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,400
dishes pretty soon with all these things they keep saying. I can't wait for like the third

163
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,340
party controllers to come out and you know some perverted Japanese company out there

164
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,220
is gonna turn like Wii controller and sex toy you know it's gonna happen hello kitty

165
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:13,140
Wii we'll see anyway Nintendo one of their biggest franchises is Pokemon and

166
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,180
still after all these years Pokemon has some very loyal fans very very loyal

167
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,300
fans diamond and pearl is coming out very soon and a lot of folks have been

168
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,420
asking when is Pokemon gonna go online well it looks like it's going to be

169
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,820
happening soon there are some scans from Famitsu that show Pokemon diamond and

170
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,460
Pearl with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection logo.

171
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,060
Now, they have said before that the game would support Wi-Fi,

172
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,940
but it was unclear if that meant local Wi-Fi or internet Wi-Fi.

173
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,060
With this logo, it knows it's going to be internet Wi-Fi.

174
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,540
So now we don't know what it's going to be.

175
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,780
Is it going to be battling?

176
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,500
Is it going to be Pokemon trading only?

177
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,180
Is it going to be emailing, like Final Fantasy III is having,

178
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,100
like we talked about last week, or what it's going to be?

179
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,900
We don't know yet.

180
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,380
But more details, hopefully, to come soon.

181
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,480
That is definitely if you're a Pokemon fan still very exciting and I think could actually breathe new life into the series

182
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,920
And I can't remember where I read this and I really apologize. I think it was on live journal

183
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,640
It was on one of the live journal communities

184
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,920
I'm on which is a good chance to plug the orange lounge live journal community as well

185
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,400
We have a live journal and a myspace, please

186
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,080
Head on over and join if you're a live journal member or myspace member and look for us orange orange lounge on

187
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
live journal and orange on radio on myspace

188
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,120
Somebody was talking about how they really need to do a Pokemon MMO

189
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,720
you know, because Pokemon is like the perfect game to make an MMO out of, I mean really

190
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,200
you know, go out, collect monsters, fight other trainers, it's just a matter of

191
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,480
finding a good concept

192
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,000
isn't it kind of surprising? I mean it is and it isn't. Nintendo really doesn't do MMOs

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,920
that they never have

194
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,520
but really here's the perfect opportunity for them to get into

195
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,040
the MMO and I bet it would be a really big game. I wonder

196
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,540
why they're holding back. I mean, maybe the Wii will

197
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,100
will see something new, but do you think Pokemon could work as an MMO?

198
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,100
I don't know. I don't like Pokemon. I think it would work very well as an MMO.

199
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,460
Just because, I mean, what's gonna be different in your experience?

200
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,220
When you're playing through Pokemon, you go through and you challenge other

201
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,180
people in the game. Why not go around and challenge other people?

202
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,420
You know, say they have their own gym there and that's like your different server

203
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,740
or... I think that would work very well.

204
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,860
and then your exploring modes are like going out and catching your different

205
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,380
Pokemon

206
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,140
I'm looking to see here on the chat room see if

207
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,660
anybody has comments. Mostly it's either Pokemon bashing or Pokemon supporting

208
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,840
like we have SatanBanana says someone needs to kill Pokemon series because it

209
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,140
sucks if you're over nine

210
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,220
and then 23rd Magus probably tells SatanBanana to go to hell

211
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,540
so we definitely have a... it may suck but it sounds like crazy

212
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,340
yeah and you know a lot of you, somebody else said who said they like the

213
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,940
Games, but not the oh here. We go l3 pa says the show is horrible, but the games are awesome

214
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,340
Pokemon snap I love Pokemon snap. I think pokemons a great concept the whole monster collecting

215
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,740
I mean, it's it's it's a great franchise. I you know yeah the cartoon

216
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,700
I may be over it now. I used to watch the cartoon a long time ago, and I think I'm kind of over it now

217
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,240
I don't know. Maybe I'd watch it once in a while. It's like a funny thing. It's a stoner cartoon now

218
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,940
Maybe I could see that dude man. It's dark in pika

219
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
Pikachu!

220
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,940
Pikachu!

221
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
Pikachu!

222
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,620
Maybe, I don't know.

223
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,660
But the games are neat, and the problem is, for me, the games have so much more potential

224
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,540
than what Nintendo's doing with it, that that's just my opinion.

225
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,540
I don't know.

226
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,220
I like Pokemon Pinball, though.

227
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,260
And Squirtle was a gay Pokemon, just so you know.

228
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,380
If you didn't know that Squirtle is a gay Pokemon, if you want to know my reasons why,

229
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,900
just email me, I'm not going to talk about it on air.

230
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
Oh, I remember that.

231
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,900
Yeah, I think I have a...

232
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,820
Just look up a book, it's called Come Out, Squirtle, and it'll explain everything.

233
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,820
Alright, anyway.

234
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,820
You gave me a copy of that.

235
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,580
That's funny. Actually, I have different types of battle stuff in mind though.

236
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,080
Oh, yes.

237
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,100
Neo Geo Battle Colosseum. That makes me particularly happy since I'm an SNK fangirl.

238
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,960
Oh, what am I saying? I'm a fangirl of just about any game, but

239
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,860
we're gonna be getting it by Ignition. It's actually going to

240
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,280
Gonna be out in Europe on PS2 in the autumn.

241
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,340
What's basically what Battle Colosseum is, it's a

242
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,620
fighting which players use different characters from a range of SNK

243
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,100
different games like World of Heroes, Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, Samurai

244
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:23,500
Showdown, Last Blade, Metal Slug, Kizuna Encounter and you'll have your

245
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,860
regular fighting modes but you also have like tag battle. It's sort of making me

246
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,540
think of King of Fighters but not quite. There's also a rumor of six different

247
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,580
hidden characters but it's actually going to be out with other games like

248
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,580
King of Fighters 11, King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2, SNK vs Capcom Card Fighters, and Metal Slug Anthology.

249
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,580
That'd be awesome, as if that game, one of the hidden fighters, is Magical Lord.

250
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,580
Remember that game? That game is awesome.

251
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:01,580
That's what I used to play at, like, when they had those Neo Geo machines down at, like, Rayleigh's or something like that.

252
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,580
We need hidden characters to be Bub and Bob.

253
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,580
You know what they need to do? They need to take this and kind of make another Capcom vs SNK.

254
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:13,480
And actually put some of the you know characters like metal slug characters and stuff. I've been hearing rumors about

255
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,180
DC DC vs. Capcom

256
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,820
Yeah, that'd be pretty cool

257
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:27,140
It's I think still a rumor. But yeah, they should actually do DC vs. Marvel as a fighting game. That would be tough

258
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,100
I don't think either one of those

259
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,820
Comic companies would want to do something like that, but I'm sure Capcom would love to make that game

260
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,020
They weren't together before.

261
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,880
Eddie in our chat room seems to think that the listeners should rally together to make

262
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,780
an Orange Longs radio card game.

263
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
I don't think there's enough.

264
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,060
Our own collectible card game?

265
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,840
You would have to really go back into the show's history to get enough people, I mean

266
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,720
granted there's the three of us that host the show and obviously Mikatov's here half

267
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,980
the time and you know even in recent memory we've had some other guests but really we

268
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,820
haven't had like the orgy of guests we used to have during some of our live shows back

269
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,820
in the day.

270
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,900
I mean you'd have to way go back to some of our old members.

271
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,860
could do it like they do in Magic, you know, where you have your different, your fire,

272
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,860
you know, your different...

273
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,860
What would you have?

274
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,860
Fire Jamie and Earth Jamie?

275
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,500
Dude, I have my, no, I have my red black deck.

276
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
My red black deck was pretty nice.

277
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Alright, anyway, anyway.

278
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,940
But they could, we could each have our own, like, series, you know, it'd be cool.

279
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,940
Interesting.

280
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:24,600
Well, speaking of battling, one battle has been decided here in the United States and

281
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,180
that is the Battle of the Portable Systems.

282
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:34,000
As if you didn't realize, last month, or actually even kind of sort of in May, the DS has actually

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,500
overtaken the PSP in sales in the United States.

284
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,400
So now the PSP can't, or Sony can't brag that the PSP is at least winning the United States

285
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,860
because they're getting their ass handed to them now.

286
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,620
Sales though, overall in video games have gone up about 25%, but in the sold units as

287
00:16:50,620 --> 00:17:03,380
far as the two consoles are concerned. The Nintendo DS is right now over 5200,000 units

288
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,500
and this was kind of towards the end of June so that number is probably even higher right

289
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:18,360
now. And the PSP is right now at 4,600,000 units, so actually more, 4.7 million units.

290
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:27,140
So basically the DS Lite kind of pushed them over the limit there and lots of new games

291
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:32,540
of course coming out for the DS and to be honest the PSP hasn't had that many great

292
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,440
releases lately so it's kind of hurting.

293
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,700
But you watch when Vice City Stories comes out, oh yeah.

294
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:46,460
But anyways, beyond that though the Xbox 360's finally reached 2 million units in the United

295
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,460
States about time. And of course the PlayStation 2 is still selling pretty strong. They sold

296
00:17:53,460 --> 00:18:00,260
another 300,000 units in June alone and puts the total up to about 34 million units in

297
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,580
the United States, which is almost as many Game Boy Advance units out there. They're

298
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,320
up to almost 33 million Game Boy Advance. Of course, now that if you think about it,

299
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,660
how many Game Boy Advance systems have there been? I mean, there's tons of different reiterations.

300
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,100
So that's pretty cool.

301
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,500
That sounds pretty cool.

302
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,460
But as far as things that are coming out, we actually have

303
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,420
our Europe release dates, if anybody is interested.

304
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,540
I know our European listeners would probably be very

305
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:29,940
interested in that.

306
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,300
I've noticed we've actually had an increase in the amount

307
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,220
of listeners coming from Europe lately.

308
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,420
And part of the reason for that, as I understand it, is

309
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,660
that folks over there are very appreciative that we are an

310
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,740
American gaming show that is willing to acknowledge that

311
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,820
there's other people around the world

312
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,700
that play video games.

313
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,140
so thank you guys for recognizing what we try to recognize

314
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,420
I love hearing from our UK listeners, they're great

315
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,340
I love hearing from everywhere, it doesn't have to be UK, it can be anywhere

316
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,420
Seriously, we've gotten emails from all over the world

317
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,900

00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,860
especially Canada lately because I was just there so you know that's

319
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,500
I'm on a Canada kick lately

320
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,700
I have to give you one of the maple cookies I got there so good

321
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,820

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,460

334
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,180
Actually a Shin Megami Tensei and the Ant Bully.

335
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,180
Pretty cool.

336
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,300
Okay, Miami Vice is on here.

337
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,300
What's the point?

338
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,300
They're doing a Miami Vice movie.

339
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Yeah, it's movie time.

340
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,780
I know, but it's still, like, what's the point?

341
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,380
Pastel suits should have stayed gone in the 80s.

342
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,300
Okay, that's my tangent.

343
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
Okay.

344
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:44,260
Anyways, in the US, similar stuff, not a whole lot, but if you are ready for some football,

345
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:51,060
NCAA Football 07 is coming out on pretty much every, well, Playstation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360

346
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,020
and the PSP, so check those out.

347
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:59,140
If you're not a fan of football, and you may be a fan of CG animated movies, in which case

348
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:05,260
Monster House will be the game for you, and that comes out on Playstation 2, or GameCube,

349
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,980
the DS and the Game Boy Advance. And if you're not a fan of either of those, maybe you're

350
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:15,480
a fan of Super Dragon Ball Z, which is coming out on Playstation 2. Then of course there's

351
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,880
Blade Dancer on the PSP Valkyrie Profile Lenith, which is a remake of the very first Valkyrie

352
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Profile on the PSP. And Miami Vice is also coming out on the PSP. And that was a PSP

353
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,080
only title, which was kind of interesting, but it looks pretty decent. Be sure to check

354
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:46,560
it out. Anyways, did you want to say something about The Sims 2? Oh, I'm sorry, yes. I did

355
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,600
want to mention something. I've been chatting, we have two listeners from Vancouver in chat

356
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,320
so I'm reminiscing my trip and telling them where to get the cookies that Jamie and I

357
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,440
are eating right now. Those cookies are addicting. There's a farmer's market they do at this

358
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,600
little island called Granville Island in Vancouver. You know what, I'm sorry to turn this into

359
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,640
cookie chat, just do your game play. Anyways, I thought I would like to talk about something.

360
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
GameSpot actually, they had their kind of retail radar thing. And there's also, I think

361
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,840
there's actually a rumor control article that they had about, during E3, EA had a game coming

362
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,080
out called Sims 2 Pets. And Sims 2 Pets was supposed to be this PC only, kind of almost

363
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,760
Looks like an expansion for The Sims 2.

364
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:36,280
But I can confirm now today that Sims 2 Pets is actually coming to the consoles and you'll

365
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,720
be able to play that here pretty soon.

366
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:48,920
It is coming out here I believe towards the fourth quarter.

367
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,560
It's basically October 18th is the date.

368
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,560
PlayStation 2 and GameCube are going to be $32.99 retail, and it's also going to be coming

369
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,840
out in the DS and Game Boy Advance for $29.99, so be sure to check that out in October.

370
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,420
So more Sims 2 games for you.

371
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,120
And you know, that kind of seems like Nintendogs to me, but whatever.

372
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Maybe you can kill them.

373
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Ooh!

374
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Ooh!

375
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,280
I am going to check this game out, especially on the PC, because if you can kill it, granted

376
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,760
You know morbid, but I killed the sims. So, you know GS 191 in Chaz an excellent point though

377
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,540
He has a message to EA here. Stop making the sims and work on spore

378
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,600
They are working on spore. Yeah, but I like spore more even from the demos I've seen I'm like

379
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,640
spore needs sport now

380
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,160
Give it to me

381
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,440
Seriously, that game is gonna be serious crack for people. Yeah, you think the sims is bad. Just wait for spore

382
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,740
I'm telling you for is that's all people are gonna be talking about next year people in

383
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,540
China are gonna be killing themselves for spending too much time on there. They're gonna leave babies in hot cars and

384
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Not feed them and all that fun stuff

385
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:07,120
All right. Anyway moving to a completely different topic regarding an upcoming Mario game. Well Mario hoops anyway

386
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,620
Squeenix has added five characters from the Final Fantasy world into the DS game

387
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,300
Mario hoops because they're actually making the game so it's kinda like they

388
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,540
you know borrowed Mario stuff but here they're putting these characters into

389
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,100
the game

390
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,860
Moogle, White Mage, Ninja, Black Mage

391
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,020
and a Cactuar named Sabotender

392
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,660
so we're not sure quite what that means yet but at least you're getting a Cactuar so

393
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,340
that's kinda cool

394
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,940
makes me think of this great overlooked PS1 title, at least I like this game

395
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,060
I don't think a lot of people did but Chocobo Racing

396
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,660
was a game they had on PS1, it was kind of like a Mario Kart type game, but you could

397
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:51,540
be like White Mage or Black Mage or a Chocobo, and you could actually unlock Squall, I think

398
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,940
was one, and I want to say you got Cloud at some point too, you could unlock all these

399
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,780
characters, it was actually a fun little racer, I really wish they'd revisit that concept,

400
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,620
I think it was a cute little game.

401
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:11,380
My message to Square and Nintendo, stop working on Mario Hoops, no one cares about Mario Hoops,

402
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:17,360
I care about a new Super Mario RPG, that's what Nintendo and Square Enix should be working

403
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
on.

404
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,860
It's not a stupid basketball game, whatever.

405
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,020
But fine, at least they're doing something new.

406
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,780
I can't complain I guess, but I will.

407
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,780
I will complain.

408
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:35,820
Anyways, on a completely different topic though, and actually kind of follows with more complaining.

409
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:43,780
Some of the ex-frag dolls are attacking the whole sponsorships of gaming teams and girl

410
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,020
gamers topic and it's kind of interesting though.

411
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:55,020
And basically quote here from them, although we may have strong opinions, you can be sure

412
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,840
of one thing, we're not here to endorse any product or sell you anything.

413
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,140
If we say it, it's because we mean it, not because it pays our wage.

414
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:10,000
kind of, you know, basically attacking the Frag dolls and those girl gaming teams, especially

415
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,440
the ones that are sponsored by Ubisoft or Microsoft, etc. Anyways, let me get back more

416
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,500
into this here. On a similar note, we may be both girls who game, but we're not here

417
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,360
to wave the girl gamer flag. We believe that drawing attention to the gender, you create

418
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,500
a barrier that's otherwise irrelevant. In our experience, promoting girl gamers can

419
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:40,800
often be used as a cover story of big business, but trying to widen its market share while

420
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,480
still getting some pretty faces in the magazines. In other words, free advertising. So they're

421
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,080
kind of coming out and saying that these girl gamer groups are nothing more than a marketing

422
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,640
ploy and they suck.

423
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,600
I don't really know what to think about all this stuff anymore. I'm just like, just shut

424
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,640
up and play games. I don't care. Because what I want to tell a lot of these people, you

425
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,960
know, the people that are passionate on both sides of it is like, make it about the games.

426
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,960
Let's just go back to the games. You know, seriously, when it needs to come back down

427
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,720
to, it needs to come to the arcade, where you've got, you know, some guy dressed up

428
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,600
all like funky and shit and kicking the crap out of an arcade game. Sure, if a chick wants

429
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,000
to walk up and then just, you know, completely defeat him in, you know, an actual game, great.

430
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,240
It's all about gamers. It doesn't matter what sex race you are. As long as you kick ass

431
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,280
in the games, that should be all that matters.

432
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,240
That should be all that matters, and fortunately, if you are on the receiving end of the discrimination.

433
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
And if you want to look...

434
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,320
Yeah, but as a homosexual, I've been on somewhat the receiving end of that discrimination before

435
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,720
too, you know, having to put up with a lot of MMOs, you know, that's gay and this is

436
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:53,480
gay, and I don't let that kind of talk really get to me, but I know that it's tough for

437
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,280
any type of minority, you know, really.

438
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,940
But I don't know, at the same time it's like, because of the internet, in a way, people

439
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,100
can be people that they're really not, at least in an MMO.

440
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,900
Guys can play girls, girls can play guys.

441
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,200
It's a great way for everybody to be anonymous.

442
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,900
You don't know what's sitting behind an Xbox Live gamertag.

443
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,860
Sure you can hear a voice, but even then some people play Xbox Live and don't use their

444
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,860
voice.

445
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,860
Or mask it.

446
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,060
Well, you can't do that on 360, but the old school one you could.

447
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Oh, the old one, yeah.

448
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,060
Even though it was awful.

449
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,760
You know, I knew a guy in college that had a really, really high-pitched voice and sounded

450
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
like a girl.

451
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,380
And a lot of Xbox Live sounds like that, too, where you don't know what gender it is because

452
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,380
it sounds like gender.

453
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,380
I'm gonna pwn you, noob.

454
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,620
You know, you can't tell really what they're saying.

455
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,060
They all sound the same.

456
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,940
Everybody sounds the same.

457
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:49,220
Actually, if it's on a PSO, you get your own feedback first before you hear everybody else.

458
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,280
And join the OL Army.

459
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,840
We're all about, you know, just shut up and play the game.

460
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,180
It doesn't matter what you look like, who you sleep with, what gender you are.

461
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
It doesn't matter.

462
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
It doesn't matter.

463
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,180
Just play a game and have fun.

464
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
And don't be a dick.

465
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,180
Yeah.

466
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,180
Exactly.

467
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,180
And speaking of the O.L.

468
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
That's rule number one of the O.L. Army.

469
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,180
Don't be a dick.

470
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
Or a twat.

471
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,640
He said twat.

472
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,800
Speaking of things, though, that are super cool.

473
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Yes.

474
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Super cool.

475
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
And you know, blah, blah, blah.

476
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Tongue tied today.

477
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,120
Sorry to interrupt you, Jamie.

478
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
I just wanted...

479
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
No, you're not.

480
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:30,720
about the OLR army real quick, I was going to mention that we did start a clan on ChromeHounds.

481
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,920
And if you want to join it, there's a couple things you should know. First thing, you've

482
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,840
got to be a member of the Kingdom of Salkar, which is one of the alliances on there when

483
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,800
you start the game, so when you're creating a character. And then what you'll do is search

484
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:52,620
for OLR, all capital, and then MY. And basically that's the OLR army. And we're looking for

485
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,020
anybody that's got a mech in the game, doesn't matter what, you know, you're playing, that's

486
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:04,260
all good. And there is a password though. UpUpDownDown is the password. I couldn't add

487
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,500
the rest of the Konami code because there's just not enough space for it, but UpUpDownDown

488
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,860
is the password to get in. And don't be a dick. And don't be a dick. You can be a dick

489
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,980
to other people, that's perfectly fine in the game. Don't be a dick to each other. We

490
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,380
We totally approve of smack talking in the game, that's fine, because after all, you're

491
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,380
all on a team.

492
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,140
Be excellent to each other.

493
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,580
Party on.

494
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,940
Are we gonna party on?

495
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,420
So can I do my thing now?

496
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,260
Yes you may, yes you may do your thing.

497
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,620
Do you need your music for your thing?

498
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,620
I do, I feel incomplete without it.

499
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:42,020
Yay, I'm so happy with you.

500
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,420
So I have been hanging out on the interwebs, and actually this is one that was brought

501
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:54,500
to my attention at California Extreme it's go to www.thefutureofpinball.com

502
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:00,140
yeah again I'm still stuck on pinball but this actually we watched their

503
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,940
little discussion they had about a movie that the guy behind this is doing about

504
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,300
the pinball 2000 series you know if you've ever seen the revenge from Mars

505
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:15,900
or wasn't there an episode 1 machine it has video integrated into the pinball

506
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,140
oh yeah those machines are cool yeah this was actually

507
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,740
there's some more information on the site as well as a trailer for the movie he's

508
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,300
working on

509
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,940
but he basically interviewed a bunch of the Williams designers and some of the

510
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,940
higher-ups in the company to see what happened because

511
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,620
pinball basically the way that the pinball industry was staying going

512
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,860
was the fact that you have this machine that does this

513
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,380
okay now we have to make this machine obsolete our competition is

514
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,460
ourself because I mean once you know we lost Capcom and it Williams basically

515
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,100
only had themselves to keep you know with to keep that whole area open they

516
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,860
had to basically make their old machines obsolete and make new things people want

517
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,860
to do so pinball 2000 was how they were going to revive the whole pinball

518
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:07,060
industry except they decided to close it down anyway now they make casino

519
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:13,660
machines but this it was it was very cool it also has some footage of some

520
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:19,460
very rare machines like this I think it's called pinball carnival or

521
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,940
something to that effect but it's basically like a multi-layer pinball

522
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,980
machine we have to work about getting it to the top of the thing it's very cool

523
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:33,100
very cool very big machine but lots of lots of really cool stuff if you're into

524
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,260
pinball if you're into video games in general because the other good thing

525
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,140
about this is that it brings in, um, techniques that were actually incorporated into some

526
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,700
of the old games, like the, uh, what was the update to Space Invaders? Where you have the

527
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,340
background behind it, but the thing projected over it.

528
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,940
I don't remember, but yeah, I know what game you're talking about, though.

529
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,940
But, um, it's, it's, it's very cool. Actually, just checking out again, it's the future of

530
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,780
pinball.com. I think this guy's movie is supposed to be out around October, I want to say. So,

531
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:05,260
um, check out the trailer. Lots of good stuff. Very interesting.

532
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:13,620
Excellent. And speaking about the next generation of stuff, Microsoft, of course, revealed this

533
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:20,220
week their brand new media player called the Zune. And no, it's not meant for games. But

534
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,420
it does look very similar to an iPod, kind of. I mean, it's got a giant screen on it

535
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:33,260
though. But it's basically going to be used for just playing games and probably, or not

536
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,900
games. I just contradicted myself there. They said they might be used for some games like

537
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,260
live arcade games or something like that. You know kind of the same stuff that you see

538
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,620
on iPods nowadays where they have the little simple games on there but mainly for music

539
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,580
and media. Probably to tie in with some other stuff that they're going to be launching here.

540
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:56,160
But it is all part of this Microsoft's Project Argo and supposedly this isn't the only device

541
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,980
that they're releasing as part of that so maybe a portable gaming device out there but

542
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,900
not this one. So the Zune is not a gaming device.

543
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:11,300
Alright, moving on to a completely different topic in regards to Sony and

544
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,640
the Blu-ray. This is kind of a iffy thing, because it came through Internet Movie

545
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,580
Database, but

546
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,940
a Chinese newspaper is reporting that Sony is having some major problems with

547
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,260
Blu-ray production.

548
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,580
Supposedly, production facilities are not being able to meet the demand for the

549
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,380
diode

550
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,780
that generates the blue laser that puts the blue in Blu-ray.

551
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,100
and apparently Sony's own plants and

552
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,180
some at Nisha Corp in Japan have

553
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,100
been having run-ins regarding supply shortcoming. This may not only

554
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,180
affect the supply of DVD players' Blu-ray, but it might also affect the

555
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:48,060
PlayStation 3. So, I don't know,

556
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,980
could be running into some delay problems with PlayStation 3. Delays are

557
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,740
possibly

558
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:57,380
low-yields, might even have more of a shortage than the Xbox 360.

559
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,340
people thought you know the xbox 360 launch was botched

560
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,740
you ain't seen nothing yet

561
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,920
well uh...

562
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,680
you know there's supposed to be uh... a uh... pirates mmo

563
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,620
pirates of caribbean

564
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,300
well um... they're saying that there's going to be user submitted content

565
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,660
now

566
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,260
as far as

567
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,820
user submitted content i'm really not sure

568
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,180
how that's going to be

569
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,660
feasible in game

570
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,520
honestly, I'm going to go ahead and read this quote here off of Kotaku

571
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,260
it simply cannot be the case that flying lab meant what they say above basically

572
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,660
what they were saying

573
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,200
is that uh...

574
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,620
they're going to let you put in user submitted and peer reviewed content

575
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,540
uh... but to get back into the quote the developers must intend to have a high

576
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,640
degree of control over the designs that make their way into the world because it

577
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,000
It is a certainty that if they don't want the entire Port Royal Harbor to look like

578
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,440
t-shirts at a fanfare, with sales that featured large-breasted elven princesses Darth Vader

579
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,680
in a jaunty pirate hat, and slogans like Minus 50 DKP or WTS PST.

580
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,480
That's great, that's a great quote.

581
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,620
How many freaking Jack Sparrows are going to be on that game, you know?

582
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,160
Just like how many Sephiroths are in Final Fantasy XI.

583
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,760
Captain Jack Sephiroth.

584
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,540
I will kill you all and look hot I think the idea I haven't I'm gonna be honest

585
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,700
I'm probably the only person in the world that has not seen either Pirates of the Caribbean movie

586
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,600
But I still think the concept of this MMO game is kind of cool

587
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
except it does make me cry a little bit because

588
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,740
Puzzle pirates was such the cutest little MMO and you know

589
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:46,300
There's been there's been pirate people that love playing that game like long before Pirates of the Caribbean was you know

590
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,660
what everybody was talking about so I kind of I kind of feel bad for those

591
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,180
guys but they'll keep their game going it's it's it's pretty cute oh yeah

592
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,300
there's still puzzle pirates going and it's it's a cute game I I don't I

593
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,820
unfortunately don't really have the time for it and you know cuz I'm playing too

594
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,620
much World of Warcraft but I respect puzzle pirates players it's it's a fun

595
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,760
game I can't call you an addict anymore I know I'm playing on two servers now

596
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,380
you freaking play it too you need to sign in to a yeah we actually have our

597
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:17,180
our guild now. I'm in the guild, hello, you gave me bags and stuff. I know, I'm just saying.

598
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,940
The only reason I didn't play the other day is because Airy Peak was down. Oh, oh yeah,

599
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,500
that's true. Anyway, moving on, what else was I gonna say? Oh, Dance Cook in our chat

600
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:30,900
room says, Puzzle Pirates needs to be on the DS. Say hell yeah. Mm-hmm. Amen. I think that

601
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,900
would be a good game for the DS. Hell yeah. It would totally work with the touch screen,

602
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,340
absolutely. Anyways, speaking of games, and speaking of Puzzle Pirates, Puzzle Pirates

603
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,380
was free for a while during the little trial there. And that's when I played it, when it

604
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:49,020
was free. Exactly. Well guess what? Xbox Live Arcade is going to get a free game. That's

605
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:55,220
right, you too can play Texas Hold'em for free. It's coming out August 23rd and it will

606
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:02,140
be free. That's no money. So be sure to check it out when it comes out. It's going to support

607
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:07,980
tournaments and 8 players online. So it looks like Microsoft wants to get you gambling.

608
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,740
pretty cool. And I think if I remember correctly, I think this game also supported the Live

609
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:16,140
Vision camera, so that would be kind of neat too.

610
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:23,140
There's actually another demo on Xbox 360. That's the Lord of the Rings demo. The Battle

611
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:30,960
from Middle Earth 2 is actually on the Xbox Live Marketplace now. It's at 148.84 megabytes,

612
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:36,540
that's pretty funny, and has a single multiplayer available. It has a tutorial to tell you how

613
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:44,100
to play it actually there's also a first mission available on there too it's lots

614
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,980
of themes have also been made available on the marketplace to you it's

615
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,220
interesting as I saw this and I downloaded it but I haven't actually

616
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:57,500
played it yet I don't know it it's kind of neat I have not really sure about the

617
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,500
whole Lord of the Rings you know aspect of it I'm just waiting for a good RTS game to

618
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,540
be on there you know something like command and conquer sure command and

619
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:10,480
Conquer 3 when they're, you know, putting that out. Pretty awesome. Probably gonna put

620
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,920
that on the 360. I think they were testing to see how well a game like that would do

621
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,960
with Lord of the Rings, so it should be interesting.

622
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,900
I will want to check this demo out, just because I like free stuff, even if it's just demos.

623
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,100
One thing to mention though about that demo, they did have, slightly before the demo was

624
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:33,260
released, they had a walkthrough of the demo, which was kind of interesting. That was pretty

625
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,740
cool. And they also had a walkthrough of some other demo, and I remember a walkthrough of

626
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:46,740
the demo of Two Human, I believe. Or no, not Two Human. God, what the hell the other game

627
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:53,260
was. But anyways, there was three walkthrough on there, and two demos, so possibly a third

628
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:58,860
demo coming out, and I think that was their new MMO, their sci-fi MMO, which for some

629
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:06,200
reason the name is escaping me whatever all right we're gonna move on to an

630
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,440
interactive element of our show we love to get mails from you guys every week at

631
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,000
mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer likes to put on our hazmat

632
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,920
suit and try to dodge the anthrax in there and pull out some of our favorite

633
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,480
emails yeah there was there was some pretty good hate mail in there from what

634
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,440
I remember from when I last ducked in there because I remember I went in for

635
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,880
last week's show I pulled some out. A few things I've had good responses to but I

636
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,320
have a few other I'm just only gonna look at a few of them today. All right

637
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,880
well let's go in and yeah we don't have time to read every email I mean Dark

638
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,720
Sakura reads them all and I read some of them too but we don't have time to

639
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,040
respond on air to all of them so. But there are quite a number that I'm going

640
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,960
to actually make a typed response to. All right real quick that was Mass Effect I

641
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,280
was talking about thank you all right here we go mailbag. The first one comes

642
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,580
from Brandon from Texas this is good afternoon actually this sort of

643
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,200
afternoon now isn't it I am a new listener of your podcast and love it I

644
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,800
just wanted to make a comment about the comments about game patching you did an

645
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,120
episode 190 it is always a bad idea to rush your product out and fix it later

646
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,560
the examples of why is Windows XP Microsoft has rushed the development of

647
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,720
XP and caused to be inherently insecure it wasn't until service pack 2 that the

648
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,280
majority of security flaws were fixed of course there are still problems the sad

649
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,360
reality is that if there is buggy software it is a risk to security and

650
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,200
your systems people can exploit a flaw in a Wii game it will cause cheating and

651
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,520
other malignant hacks I'd like that use of malignant okay I'm the grammar nerd

652
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:42,000
um not a tumor I may sound paranoid but listening to podcasts such as security

653
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,060
now makes one very aware of risks in terms of gaming a fundamental piece of

654
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,820
software could be damaged if there is a bug that affects system memory data such

655
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:57,160
as virtual console games on the Wii, it could corrupt the data. What will this world come

656
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,120
to if we do not have proper quality control prior to release?" Very good point.

657
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:08,560
Good email. I like the comparison. I like the point that he's trying to make with XP

658
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,040
being, you know, they have tons of flaws and they're always releasing patches for it all

659
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,920
the time, but at the same time, to me, it's a little bit of apples and oranges because

660
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,120
you're talking about operating system, which is like the backbone of the computer, versus

661
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,680
a game. It's a little bit apples and oranges for me. Don't get me wrong, I get the comparison,

662
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,480
but it's a little bit apples and oranges for me.

663
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,800
I'll tell you what system actually that would have been a very accurate comparison to is

664
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,480
the Dreamcast. For any of the games that ran in the Windows CE environment, the game loads

665
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,700
Windows CE onto the system prior to playing the game.

666
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:45,640
Or even more recent, some of the Xbox 360 games and their save game errors, which, you

667
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,920
know, once you're playing through some of the game, you go back into it and your save

668
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,420
games gone so you know that was something that they had the patch and

669
00:42:53,420 --> 00:43:00,260
fix and hopefully I think is fixed by now. More mail! Yes actually an email from

670
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:06,740
our dear friend Rob with two B's actually sent me a little bit of a of an article

671
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:12,540
that was posted on instant replay that about Namco of America they have a new

672
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:20,580
president. Toyoshi Nishikawa is now the president and CEO of Namco

673
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:27,620
America Incorporated. Kevin Hayes is now going to be focusing on Namco

674
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:34,580
Cybertainment which is the arcade. Good! I mean good that arcade stuff is going up

675
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,860
again. You know I was listening to another show. I think it was Bobby? They're

676
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:44,060
talking about arcade stuff and how there's kind of a need to re-energize

677
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,620
what's going on in the arcade scene and I want to say it was something like Sega

678
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,100
had a big interest in trying to revitalize what was going on in the

679
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,060
arcade market I know some of the things that they were citing was look at a game

680
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,700
like Derby Owners Club that is a huge social following behind it that's really

681
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,460
where the ask that's really where arcades can come back to life is

682
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:10,140
through the social element, you know, look at DDR, I mean hell, this show was born of

683
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:15,580
the social element of DDR, it boils down to something as simple as that, you know, that's,

684
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,580
you gotta deliver something in an arcade setting that you can't get being able to sit at home

685
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,540
and play on your big butt on your big couch, you know, being able to play games, you gotta

686
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,960
be able to deliver something different in an arcade, and like, networking arcades together

687
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,500
for like site competitions is another like cool thing, so, I like that people are putting

688
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,340
resources back into making arcades fun because arcades arcades have so much

689
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,180
potential they're pretty much dying over here for a little while they need to

690
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,720
they need to come back to life there's so much potential I think it's actually

691
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,580
pretty good that they brought over somebody from the Japanese side of it

692
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:48,620
because there are kids there are still you know if they're not surviving fully

693
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:52,660
they're still you know going on strong there's only I don't think there's been

694
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,740
as many closures there as there were here but a little bit more background on

695
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:05,660
Nishikawa he's been with Namco since 1987 he's been the EVP CEO since January

696
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:10,620
so basically he's been with Namco for a while he's got a lot of experience in

697
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:16,320
the company so I'm being being that I am a big Namco fan I worked for you know

698
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,840
several of their arcades a GS 68 in our chat room has a great comment to maximum

699
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:29,120
Toon 2 is very social as well, so that's, you know, this could be a good thing for arcades.

700
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,000
So congratulations on your promotions, boys.

701
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,720
Speaking of arcades, I actually saw, I was at Riptide Arcade yesterday, and they have,

702
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,600
that's the Pier 39 one, right, in San Francisco, they have now this machine that you can win

703
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,640
iPods and PSPs and DSs out of.

704
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,120
I saw one at Universal City Walk in one of the random stores there.

705
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,040
Wow, we've all been traveling a lot lately.

706
00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:01,760
Like, we have these random Reno, Canada stories in LA, and now you've got San Francisco.

707
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,500
Yeah.

708
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,440
And this is San Francisco, San Jose, Los Gatos, like, in the span of two days.

709
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,540
It's kind of crazy.

710
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:07,800
Anyway.

711
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,360
Anyway, back to the emails.

712
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,940
One from Fireboma, one of our long-time listeners.

713
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,580
Dear OLR, recently while watching X-Play, a review on the US release of Beatmania got

714
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,860
my interest.

715
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,300
Besides the usual complaints of the game's learning curve and lack of familiar songs,

716
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,880
the folks over at X-Play decided to go the extra mile and say that the game in general

717
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,240
was simply not good at all.

718
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,360
They then continued to say Guitar Hero was clearly a better game and that Beatmania was

719
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,600
a blatant ripoff of Guitar Hero.

720
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,680
Needless to say, this made me annoyed to a fanboy-ish level.

721
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,920
X-Play, the show that usually laden with knowledge about obscure Japanese RPGs and action games,

722
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,640
forgot to do its homework and is now talking out of its ass.

723
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,600
The main problem is that this lack of knowledge about the Bimani series when it comes to comparing

724
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:53,360
Guitar Hero to other games is commonplace in many publications about the Guitar Hero

725
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,080
series, calling it groundbreaking and such.

726
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,800
This is like calling In the Groove a unique dancing game the likes of which never have

727
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,440
been seen before.

728
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,900
I'm wondering what your thoughts on this issue and what you think about X-Play's review.

729
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,960
As far as X-Play's review goes, I think you pretty much said it right there.

730
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,120
I mean if they didn't do the research you you can tell it shows and you it makes you mad or whatever

731
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,560
So it you know their review they will

732
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:23,640
Bear the brunt of the fan base getting mad at them for their review, but unfortunately it's kind of a trend

733
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:29,080
You're seeing because while here's here. It is for me guitar. Hero is a good game

734
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,060
It's a it's in fact. It's a great game, but people give it too much credit

735
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,980
it didn't do as much as people think it did.

736
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,540
And the problem is, exactly what this is, is that people are giving

737
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,780
Guitar Hero credit for something it didn't do.

738
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,340
And that was like creating the music genre, essentially,

739
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,140
in a way. Creating the music making genre, I should say, because you know,

740
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:51,780
you could go back,

741
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,820
Beatmania didn't really create the music, and you could go back further and say,

742
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,180
Parappa the Rappa was really,

743
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:00,140
but as far as the music making genre, Beatmania is really the granddaddy,

744
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:04,220
and so you know you can't credit Guitar Hero with that. 1998!

745
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,100
But you can credit Guitar Hero with

746
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:13,000
putting the American spin on it and making it and kinda catering to what I

747
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,420
think American audiences wanted and really finding that. Or even still just

748
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,660
comparing it to like

749
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:21,340
frequency and amplitude I mean since that was if you wanna you know completely

750
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,620
ignore the Japanese side of everything

751
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:27,380
those games were out a long time before and they were basically the same

752
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,340
damn thing

753
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:34,620
Well, yeah, exactly, it's the same company, but I remember seeing this review a while

754
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:40,180
back and I remember complaining about it as well, because, you know, I had pretty good

755
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:46,740
respect for, you know, X-Play, because I love how they rip in some of the stupid games out

756
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:51,500
there and they point out what's really dumb about them, or what's glitchy about it, and

757
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,740
they do it in a funny way sometimes, but then there's sometimes where they're just talking

758
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:01,980
other ass about things. And I don't know, it's just, you kind of expect a certain level

759
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,980
of, you know, criticism from them and a little bit of research involved and then when you

760
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:12,140
see them just kind of completely turn around and become like all those other shows out

761
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:19,140
there, you kind of let down. And I really think if they want to play devil's advocate

762
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:24,980
here, Guitar Hero wouldn't be as great as it was if guitar freaks had more licensed

763
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:29,860
music that wasn't all kinda in-house or non-mainstream. I mean, it was a Japanese game and it had

764
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:34,540
Japanese-style music. And in fact, if I remember correctly, I think that was one of the complaints

765
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:39,700
of Beatmania was, oh, none of these beat music tracks, they're just all generic techno and

766
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:45,540
I don't recognize any of these. But yeah, if you follow Beatmania, these are some classic

767
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,380
tracks from like ten years ago in some of the beginning games.

768
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,540
I want to get to some chatroom comments real quick before we get back to the mailbag. And

769
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:56,580
I want to say 23 Maggots in our chat room says guitar hero did a hell of a lot it made music games more

770
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,140
Accessible, that's kind of the point there. That's a good way of putting it. It made music games more accessible to a wider audience

771
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,020
I like that point and then GS 191 also makes a good point

772
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:10,300
Hey, don't blame the hosts. None of us are but for the record, but everybody out there should keep in mind this

773
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:15,700
Hey, don't blame the hosts blame the fucking writers and editors. They are the people that are putting that show down the tubes

774
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,420
So whatever intern at x-play wrote that review a spanking for you, my friend

775
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,780
Okay, granted still don't blame the host, that's fine, but

776
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,060
I would take it that these people, hosts of a gaming show,

777
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,800
should have some common knowledge to a game series that is,

778
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,580
I don't know, over 10 years old now.

779
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:39,860
To the credit though, the two that they have hosting that show

780
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,060
have more knowledge than a lot of folks on that network, so

781
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,780
I can't complain. They've talked about, you know, DDR in the past, and they've

782
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,820
talked about when

783
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:52,500
guitar freaks when guitar hero came out so I know they're aware of guitar hero

784
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,700
or guitar freaks so what

785
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,260
it's just a brain fart whatever I've got one last email

786
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:03,700
and this is from blaze saying hey skyloki and dark sakura

787
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,820
I've always as always the show is going amazingly well and I can't wait for each

788
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:12,340
week's episode I just wanted to offer an opinion on a couple different things

789
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,860
number one in regards to a question about retailers not having the

790
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,960
quote unpopular like a Phoenix Wright, Katamari Damacy

791
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,340
games I would like to say this. Retailers need to understand that these games exist

792
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,680
because people do play them.

793
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,760
Therefore, stores should come up with a better way of figuring out what to stock

794
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,420
and what not to stock. Even if the store only keeps two or three copies of the

795
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,480
game at a given time, it is better than running out

796
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,160
and not doing anything about it. I called three GameStop CB's in the past week

797
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,760
and none of them had Phoenix Wright, not a big surprise, or Katamari Damacy, a rather odd

798
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,320
surprise.

799
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,600
When I spoke to the people at these stores, they did nothing in order to try and be more helpful other than no

800
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:54,040
We don't have the game in their defense. It is based on how much they sell they're going to if they sell

801
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,480
40 like I'm just gonna pick random numbers if they sell one copy of

802
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,400
Katamari during pre-orders and they sell 40 of Madden

803
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,880
Their big seller is going to be Madden

804
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,200
it is going to make more sense for them to stock more of this

805
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,480
better to cater to the larger numbers than to the niche market.

806
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,240
But on the other side of this and the part that kind of makes me go huh is that you

807
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,320
know like let's say Tower Records if they didn't have a CD I wanted they

808
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,520
would offer to order it for me so why aren't these

809
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,800
stores that he's calling offering to at least order the game for him?

810
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,480
That would be what I would do. I know that they don't actually have that

811
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,320
capability

812
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,720
so that's why they wouldn't offer it however I think that if you

813
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,920
if you wanna see more retailers do that,

814
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,920
write their customer service line.

815
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,800
Yeah, because I'm just speaking,

816
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,360
and I'm not trying to rip on any store,

817
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,360
because he named a couple stores here.

818
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,040
From a customer service angle,

819
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,120
you don't turn the customers away.

820
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,840
You try to do whatever you can.

821
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,480
I train customer service for a living.

822
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,340
You have to try and keep them somehow,

823
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,360
and that's one way you can do it.

824
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,760
I mean, if that's a corporate restriction,

825
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,200
that's the corporate,

826
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,400
the corporate needs to look into that.

827
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,440
I do know, and I've actually been in this,

828
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,560
and it's not just my husband that does this.

829
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,480
and I'm not just saying it because he's my husband too, but I've actually been in a

830
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,560
couple of GameStops where they will call other stores

831
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,680
and find out if they have it. Well now that's a little better. That's a little better. That's something. That's good.

832
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,880
I went back, kind of on the same subject, I went back to GameStop the other day to

833
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,800
was I was looking to maybe pick up another used Xbox 360 game

834
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,620
but I also checked to see if they had point blank DS

835
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,720
which they haven't had a copy in since it came out and

836
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,580
Neil, that kind of peeves me. I understand that there might not be a huge demand for it.

837
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,700
Bring in one copy. I'm going to kill you to have one copy of the game.

838
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,900
Loki, just go to the internet at this point. Order it online. You bitch about this every week.

839
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,040
You just order it online.

840
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:44,660
No. I do want to say though, Dark Soccer, since you weren't here last week,

841
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,780
I pre-ordered my first game in many years.

842
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,540
Final Fantasy XII because I want that uber bundle. The game stops kidding.

843
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,460
Well that actually goes to the next topic on here, but one other thing I wanted to touch on is that

844
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,540
I actually do think that it might be a good idea for

845
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,820
people to write in and actually make suggestions to these companies.

846
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,520
They should have ways to, you know, like what McDonald's was trying to do with their whole

847
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,940
big network thing, you know.

848
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:12,360
I think that they should actually do a network wide inventory and be able to do stores.

849
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,620
You actually can do store to store transfers for items at GameStop.

850
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,900
I think that's more just in case they need stock of stuff.

851
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:23,460
But I think that they should actually be able to have it where, hey, we can pull this copy

852
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,060
from this store for you and have it for you on this day.

853
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,060
Right.

854
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,820
it's a suggestion. Well hopefully somebody who has the power to

855
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,940
change, it doesn't have to be

856
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,900
GameStop, it can be any of these stores. If anybody's listening that might

857
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,820
have control over corporate, I hope you have...

858
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:41,540
I would love to hear from you guys that work in the corporate side of these

859
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,180
things. What's your view on these types of policies? If we're

860
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,740
way off base with what we think are good ideas, we'd like to know

861
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,460
why. What are the

862
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,580
reasons why you wouldn't do that? I should see if I could interview my

863
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,300
husband's boss.

864
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,420
That would be fun.

865
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,420
The second item on here, pre-ordering games is something I only do if I'm going to get a bonus out of it.

866
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,420
For example, I pre-ordered Soul Calibur II for the Xbox.

867
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:10,420
I had pre-ordered it two or three days after the offer had expired, but I received my very awesome lithograph that hangs in the frame in my room,

868
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,420
and a gorgeous book with artwork from the game.

869
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,420
So I say that reserving the game is only worth it if you get a nice bonus.

870
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,420
Um, I do disagree with that.

871
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:24,420
For some of those more rare, hard to find, you know, games that you know there's going to be a limited run of,

872
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:31,300
of pre-ordering guarantees you get your copy so I and honestly because I it's

873
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,660
really convenient for me anyway because I can just say hey Dan pick up our

874
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:39,220
pre-orders but even so you know if you live a block from a GameStop or it's on

875
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:43,020
your way home from work what's gonna hurt you to stop in drop your five bucks

876
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:47,780
off and pick it up after work one day I don't want to keep delaying this issue

877
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,340
out but I did think about it so I just want to leave with this no this is this

878
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,340
is I really thought about what is the reason Rob why you don't pre-order games

879
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,340
and I thought about it.

880
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:58,920
This is why I don't like to pre-order games because I feel like when I put down $5 a game

881
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,560
stop, the day the game comes out, then I see an ad in the paper and, oh, Best Buy is offering

882
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,460
a free copy of such and such, or offering this deal.

883
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:10,080
So it's like, well, damn, now I've already committed the $5 to buy here and now I can

884
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,800
really get the special deal here.

885
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,380
And honestly, I think that's what stopped me from doing it in the past is when I put

886
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,680
down $5 on a game and then suddenly Best Buy or one of the other companies, I'm just using

887
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,200
them as an example, gave a better deal and I was a little miffed by that.

888
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,360
As a small rebuttal, you can transfer your reserves to other games, and I think you actually

889
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,760
can cancel your reserve.

890
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,240
Well, I guess that's a good thing to know, but I guess maybe the common knowledge out

891
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,400
there is you think, oh, it's on this game, I have to buy it, you know, so anyway, I don't

892
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,160
want to go into this whole issue again, we've had enough talk on it.

893
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,720
The last thing on here is, Blaze actually made a suggestion for Side of the Week, and

894
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,720
since I've already done Side of the Week, I think I'll make a mention of this one.

895
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,920
It's kingdomofloathing.com.

896
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,780
It's an online game that mocks the entire foundation of RPGs as it is known today.

897
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:58,420
If you think Atari 2600 graphics look bad these days, then this site is a step down

898
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,420
the ladder.

899
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,880
It is done completely in stick figures.

900
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,880
I've actually been to that site.

901
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,160
It's worth your time checking out.

902
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,260
An honorable mention for Site of the Week.

903
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,260
It's cute.

904
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,820
I can't think of any other word to describe it.

905
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:10,820
It's cute.

906
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:11,820
Check it out.

907
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,820
Cute is, yeah.

908
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:13,820
Honestly, I had...

909
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,080
I know we have some OL Army people on there.

910
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,640
Well, you know what?

911
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:23,480
I'll tell you what, if anyone of you is playing on Kingdom of Loathing, I will make, you know,

912
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:28,560
because again I'm hosting stuff for our OL army also on roleplay.darksacra.com, I will

913
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,240
make a Kingdom of Loathing discussion forum for you guys.

914
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:36,880
Ooh, now Roz in our chat room, or Dance Cook, whatever, says that Kingdom of Loathing needs

915
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,200
to go die in a fire.

916
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,840
Apparently something happened, some drama, I don't know.

917
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,160
Is there drama on Kingdom of Loathing?

918
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,160
I wouldn't know, anyway.

919
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,520
What game does not have drama, please?

920
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:54,900

00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,720
And also the kind of, also one more thing to add on there, thank you for anybody that

940
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,300
nominated us for the podcast awards as well.

941
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,820
Let's hope it's five indies that got nominated. Let's hope that it is indie

942
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,220
podcasts they got in there, but we'll know in

943
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,900
about a week or so what's going on there. I would bet anything

944
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,460
Gamertag Radio gets nominated because I've gotten like five emails from those

945
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,220
guys.

946
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:07,380
Whether it be on Xbox, and no disrespect, they've got a fine show, they are really

947
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,540
passionate about what they do.

948
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,380
Really, I mean they are

949
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:16,980
They love what they do and it's it's obvious, but it's just funny because I got it on Xbox live

950
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:23,220
We got it in our own mailbag. I mean, it's just everywhere, but I I don't they're they're absolutely deserving

951
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:26,160
I think would be cool if they got it and that there's lots of deserving shows out there

952
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,720
I can't wait to see what what happens

953
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:33,420
I wish I wish everybody on all games and some of the other cool ones can get all get nominated

954
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:38,340
But we'll see what happens. Yeah, okay. Anyways, I'm speaking of you know, all that fun stuff

955
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:43,900
There's a little bit of drama going on and this drama is kind of taking place in Las

956
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:49,340
Vegas with Mayor Oscar Goodman and apparently he doesn't like the brand new Rainbow Six

957
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:54,780
Vegas game that's coming out that depicts terrorists taking over a hotel in Vegas.

958
00:59:54,780 --> 01:00:00,220
Anyways, Goodman has an issue with the game's plot which sees the terrorists taking over

959
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:06,580
a swanky casino on the city strip and seizing a number of hostages.

960
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:12,780
Goodman reported saying the game was based on a false premise, adding he has been repeatedly

961
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,180
told by the government officials that Las Vegas is the safest place imaginable when

962
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,580
it comes to terrorist attacks.

963
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,780
The mayor also said he'll look into whether or not the city can prevent the game from

964
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:24,780
being released.

965
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:32,260
It could be harmful economically and it may be something that's not entitled to free speech

966
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,540
protection.

967
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:41,000
So that's kind of interesting, kind of along the same lines of Mercenaries 2 and the people

968
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,580
in Venezuela getting pissed off about that game, so it should be interesting.

969
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:50,460
But I mean, come on, the game in the end, they save the people, so I mean, it's not

970
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:55,220
like, you know, oh, the people get all killed and yeah, Vegas sucks.

971
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,860
WonderDogHerald has an excellent point here in the chat room.

972
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,700
You'd think he'd object to all the murders that take place in Las Vegas on CSI.

973
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,700
Exactly!

974
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:07,700
That's true. CSI does not make Las Vegas look like a pretty place.

975
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,700
I don't really watch the show a whole lot. I've caught it a couple times because

976
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,700
I shouldn't have to feel ashamed to admit this, but I like Survivor.

977
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:19,700
And CSI comes on after Survivor, and you know, sometimes I catch the first little pieces.

978
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,700
It doesn't paint Vegas to be a pretty town at all.

979
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,700
So you think the mayor would... maybe he has, I don't know.

980
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,700
I mean, after all, their catchphrase for Vegas is, you know,

981
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:34,780
You know, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, I mean, whatever.

982
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:38,320
Alright, anyway, moving on, I want to point this out.

983
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,700
This is very random, but when was the last time we had Atari 2600 news on this show?

984
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,060
Hey, we love all consoles.

985
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,060
We mean it.

986
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:54,180
Well, get this, Simon Kornhorst is developing for the Atari 2600, yes, folks are still developing

987
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,460
for the Atari 2600.

988
01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:00,580
called a VCS tech challenge is the name of the game that's a little bit of a

989
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:05,700
play on the word as tech challenge there was a game on the Commodore 64 there's a

990
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,020
quote from Simon Cornhorse that says as follows I somehow remember the game as

991
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:12,660
tech challenge from 1983 on the Commodore 64 and I always liked the

992
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:16,980
first level called the gauntlet and the game music I thought that a similar game

993
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:20,940
for the VCS would be cool he says on his website for the game's release there

994
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,180
will be handmade copies complete with a manual cartridge and packaging but only

995
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:28,780
for the first 55 owners.

996
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:33,740
Most of those have already been secured by nostalgia gamers, however, Mr. Cornhorse is

997
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:38,800
willing to produce as many copies as is needed with just manuals and cartridges for those

998
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,660
folks that may want to pick this up a VCS tech challenge.

999
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:49,060
Now they keep making these flashback consoles, I think it would be cool to see games like

1000
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,700
this be put in the flashback consoles and I think they did this.

1001
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:56,540
I remember a story way, way back there. Atari Flashback 2 came out, they had like a contest,

1002
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:00,500
like a 24 hour development, and they put the winning game in the Flashback 2. They should

1003
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:08,060
reach out to this guy and put this AVCS tech challenge in Flashback 3 if they do it. You've

1004
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:13,340
got to really love the 2600 to still be developing for it. You know what it looks like though?

1005
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:18,740
The game itself kind of looks like Enduro to me, and how the hell I remember a game

1006
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:24,880
like Enduro, I'll never know. But instead of driving, it looks like a little guy running.

1007
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,880
So that's kind of cool.

1008
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:36,120
Interesting. Anyways, brand new news here talking about TV now. DirecTV and IGN have

1009
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,880
teamed up with Microsoft and a bunch of other companies to put together a brand new pro

1010
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,520
gaming series called the Championship Gaming Series. It's basically a new professional

1011
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:50,840
gaming league that will air competitions exclusively to DirecTV.

1012
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:55,640
And apparently next weekend DirecTV and the company will take over a 16,000 square foot

1013
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:00,820
airplane hangar at former Treasure Island Naval Base in San Francisco and turn it into

1014
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,640
an indoor video game arena.

1015
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:09,860
And it says it will use 16 HD cameras to film the two day invitational event.

1016
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:14,680
And no word how the competitors for the event were chosen, but they'll be playing a variety

1017
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:22,680
including Battlefield 2, Project Gotham Racing 3, Halo 2, DOA 4, and Counter-Strike 1.6.

1018
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:29,680
And it should be interesting, it says the weekend's event will be aired in August.

1019
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,680
Isn't DirecTV the home of Gameplay HD as well?

1020
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,680
I think so.

1021
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,680
And it looks like there's a lot of love for games over at DirecTV.

1022
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,680
That's kind of promising, because from what I've heard of Gameplay HD,

1023
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,680
it sounds like it's going to be a very good thing for gamers.

1024
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,800
for gamers I hope it gets out there just beyond one satellite carrier I hope it

1025
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,240
gets really out there in the mainstream because we need a real gaming channel

1026
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:53,760
yeah because the one that used we used to have we just don't count anymore

1027
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,920
period we don't count it anyway we're gonna go to a new section of our show

1028
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,160
the sky actually this is not a new section it's the section we do every

1029
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:05,040

1033
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,920
Obviously, you know who's on the other line. Well, you still need to introduce yourself for those folks in the sock

1034
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,920
All right, what's on your mind? Let's do Zaku

1035
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:37,780
Basically picking off of where you actually said about the whole x-play fiasco and you know Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb

1036
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,180
Just not doing their job. Well now wait a minute

1037
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:45,220
Didn't we say don't blame the host because I know but I know but still as I said, you know

1038
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:49,700
There's a lot of blame to go around not only them too, but you know the people behind them

1039
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,980
They're making them, you know, that are you know, the people they're actually feeding them this stuff

1040
01:05:53,980 --> 01:06:01,740
I and I believe I firmly believe that there's a bias against them. There's a bias against against you know

1041
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:06,700
well basically any type of any type of game that doesn't fit their their

1042
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:11,420
criteria like you know in this case they they're just they're just kissing the

1043
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:16,260
ass of guitar hero basically that's all I see now from not only xplay but from

1044
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:20,980
game spot and other people that you know that bastardize beatmania what is the

1045
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:26,340
criteria I mean they from what I've been seeing they they usually come down hard

1046
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:31,280
on good games that turn out to be really you know they really they really you

1047
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,240
know it really speaks it talked down on

1048
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,840
and you know on good games and really

1049
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,840
good games I mean I know was there

1050
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,620
another game that they did a review of

1051
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:45,840
that made you upset um I'm trying to

1052
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,440
remember right now it also it's been a

1053
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,080
while since I watch X play but usually

1054
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,080
okay I know okay but so okay that's

1055
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:53,880
alright you can't think of an example

1056
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,640
but to play devil's advocate for a bit

1057
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,860
you're never gonna agree with game

1058
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,600
reviews 100% of the time they're kind of

1059
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:04,000
meant to ruffle your feathers a little bit yeah and that's that's the truth and I

1060
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,260
understand that but I mean the only thing what I don't get is how you know

1061
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:15,120
they're saying it's you know taking one thing like guitar hero and making it so

1062
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,120
you know make it hold more weight and something that has like beatmania which

1063
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:24,240
which has been around there for long for like almost ten times as long as guitar

1064
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,040
hero it doesn't make sense somebody didn't do their homework I mean it's

1065
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:33,760
Well, that too, and I mean, and the fact that from what I heard in the BeatMania review

1066
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,040
in X-Play, they only played the 5-key side.

1067
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:43,660
They never explored the 2DX side, and that, you know, so you see how half-assed the whole

1068
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:44,660
review was.

1069
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,660
Exactly.

1070
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,380
Honestly, I think they just gave it to some intern who did the review in a day, if even

1071
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,380
that.

1072
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:53,380
I mean, that's what happened, but, you know, two things happened.

1073
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:57,640
It's good news for X-Play because now we've spent how much time during this program essentially

1074
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:04,100
giving them free advertising, and two, it's also going to make themselves look bad in

1075
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:07,620
that community for not having done that, but that's just part of life.

1076
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,620
You know what?

1077
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:13,060
We get criticized because we make mistakes sometimes, but you just have to realize shit

1078
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,060
happens.

1079
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:15,620
We make lots of mistakes.

1080
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,620
So what?

1081
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,020
We don't claim to be all knowing.

1082
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:23,560
It pisses me off when I read things on the internet that bash on us for this type of

1083
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:28,260
stuff and it�s like we don�t get paid for this.

1084
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:32,240
If I was getting paid to do eight hours of research a day on video games, everything

1085
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,900
that comes out of my mouth, Loki�s mouth, Dark Sakura�s mouth is love of games and

1086
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,460
hobbyists as hobbyists and things we do.

1087
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:44,300
At least you guys go through playing the games before saying something about them, whereas

1088
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:48,260
Adam and Morgan just read off the teleprompter.

1089
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:53,580
Well, to be honest, though, it would take forever for one person to play all the games.

1090
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:57,260
Trying to play everything that comes out, I remember when we first started doing the

1091
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:03,540
podcast full-time and everything, I was just trying to play everything, and you can't.

1092
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,540
You really can't.

1093
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:08,420
And to Adam and Morgan's credit, at least as hosts, they've been doing other programs

1094
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,420
with that.

1095
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:12,220
They've kind of earned their way into those spots.

1096
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:18,680
was doing shows on ZDTV, like the GameSpot TV, where I think the hosts were responsible

1097
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,020
for a lot more of the work.

1098
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:23,400
So I don't, you can't discredit this game, and Morgan was part of Screensavers a long

1099
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,940
time ago.

1100
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:29,640
I would really take them, you know, I would take them a lot more seriously if they actually,

1101
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:34,780
you know, did more work as in actually giving an honest opinion rather than just reading

1102
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:35,780
it off.

1103
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:38,220
You know, that can't really happen.

1104
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:41,380
That might be the producer or the network's problem, though.

1105
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:44,480
But Zaku, we gotta let you go, we're running a lot, we gotta get another call, but thank

1106
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:50,180
you so much for the perspective and making us talk about it a little bit.

1107
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,180
Let's go to another call.

1108
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,660
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1109
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,140
This is 23rd Magus.

1110
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:59,260
Hi 23rd Magus, back away from your speakers a little bit and tell us what's on your mind.

1111
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:03,220
Okay, I just thought I'd pitch in with a little WoW update.

1112
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,220
Okay what's up?

1113
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:06,980
I'm the resident WoW addict anyway.

1114
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,940
Okay what's up on WoW?

1115
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:15,940
Okay, IGN has released a new story unveiling the new additions to World PvP in the 1.12 patch.

1116
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:18,940
It should be coming out, I'd say, probably within a month.

1117
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:23,440
The Eastern Plague Lands will feature resource points that must be captured,

1118
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:28,940
and Silithist will have piles of magical dust called Silithist that must be collected.

1119
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:31,940
Alliance and Horde players will fight over these resources,

1120
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:35,940
which, when turned in, will provide a zone-wide buff to your faction.

1121
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:42,780
The 1.12 patch with the world PVP objectives, the cross several battlegrounds, and the road

1122
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,020
talent review should be live on the test rooms by Monday.

1123
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:50,060
I did notice on worldofwarcraft.com they posted the list of which...

1124
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:54,700
Magus, I have to let you go because we're getting really bad feedback, but let me respond

1125
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,980
to that just a little bit, what he was saying.

1126
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:59,260
Thank you for the World of Warcraft update, that was cool.

1127
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:03,900
But I did want to say really quickly that on worldofwarcraft.com I did notice that they

1128
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:09,000
the list of which realms are in which group for the cross battle realms and of

1129
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,120
course I'd look to where airy peak is at which where we've been playing and it

1130
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,740
looks like I'll be able to play my old friends on doom hammer because we're in

1131
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:18,140
the same group so that's kind of cool so we'll see what happens with that let's

1132
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,860
go to the phones one more time hello you're on orange lounge radio who's this

1133
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:27,820
it's Ron all right what's on your mind Rama I want to talk about point that you

1134
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:32,140
a customer service and gaming stores I can I understand exactly where you're

1135
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:33,140
coming from with that.

1136
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:34,140
Okay.

1137
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,140
How so?

1138
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:41,140
I work at Staples and if the item is not in stock, we have to go in the systems and track

1139
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,140
it down.

1140
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:46,400
If we can't get from one machine, we have to go to the AS400 and check all the stores

1141
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,540
in the area.

1142
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:50,880
We have to bend over backwards for the customers, make sure they get what they want.

1143
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,900
And I have no problem doing that because when I do it for a customer, I expect the same

1144
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,160
thing done for me.

1145
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:03,680
To be honest, that's a good company policy, but to be fair to whatever companies we were

1146
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,800
talking about earlier in the show, we don't have a representative to really give us the

1147
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,100
exact policy.

1148
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:16,240
So we can only talk about what your company is doing, which it sounds like a good thing.

1149
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:21,240
But the thing is, let's say that it's company policy with all these companies.

1150
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:25,000
When it comes down to the individual stores, it seems that management of that store or

1151
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,740
employees just don't how I say don't give a shit because I had to deal with

1152
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:32,620
the same thing that Sunday I went looking for a couple games at Circuit

1153
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:37,220
City they expected me to go calling all the stores for the games I said to the

1154
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:41,740
two people standing there that um excuse me this is your job you're supposed to

1155
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:45,820
go looking at the computers for the games as I want I'm here being very nice

1156
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:49,460
about it there's no need for you to be rude to me and don't you know the

1157
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:53,680
following day I called corporate and I gave them my two cents about it yeah I'm

1158
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:57,760
I was told by a game store once when I called in asking if they had a certain game in stock

1159
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:02,400
And it wasn't anything major. I wasn't talking like you know an Xbox 360 or Halo 2 or something

1160
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,000
I called in asking if a game was in stock

1161
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,560
And I was told I'm busy right now come down and look and see if we have it on the shelves and needless to say

1162
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,000
I bought the game at their competitor across town

1163
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,220
Because it was a lot nicer when I called they checked you know

1164
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:22,760
It's just that's the reality of what happens bad customer service is lost business, but yeah, right again again

1165
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:27,620
we can't we can't go quoting who's who's what company policy we can't let one

1166
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:32,240
worker be ruin the reputation of entire company either so I'm just gonna say for

1167
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:36,160
anybody I know we probably have a lot of people that listen that work at these

1168
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:40,960
type of places and it could be anything from the GameStop EB stores to Best Buy

1169
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:47,200
Office Depot staples to mom-pop stores whatever keep in mind that it might be

1170
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:54,320
inconvenience sometimes but bad customer service leads to lost business leads to

1171
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,120
your store getting closed and you getting laid off and that's one of the

1172
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:01,200
reasons why one of the guys at my job got fired on Tuesday yeah it's too bad

1173
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,320
all right well we got to let you go to get more calls in but thank you so much

1174
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,800
sure no problem much love bye okay hugs and kisses bye bye

1175
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:15,080
right back at you all right we'll do one more call somebody wants to call in on

1176
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:19,640
our skype line it's www.orangelaungeradio.com click on interact with us or our phone number

1177
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:25,080
916-226-9067 in the meantime does anybody have any last minute stories they wanted to

1178
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:31,520
get off their chest here in studio oh is that a big no oh yes dark soccer had a mic to her

1179
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:37,380
mouth first i just i was gonna say oh okay then loki oh nope cut off by the skype call

1180
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:44,280
here we go hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hi this is speaker kerry i am sorry

1181
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:56,840
I just got back on vacation from the Philippines, and the thing is I spent a lot of time in

1182
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:02,600
the arcades over there, and one thing I noticed, the social environment over there is much

1183
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,840
more lively than it is over here.

1184
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:12,200
Well, like, okay, it's not just the hardcore gamers that are always there, that are there

1185
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,200
all the time.

1186
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:18,960
there'd be like families and you know usually people that you wouldn't consider gamers that

1187
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:25,360
are hanging around like playing the games or just having fun. Why do you think families are more

1188
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,840
apt to play games together in the Philippines than they are here? Well you know what honestly

1189
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,520
I think it's because of the social economic conditions because most of these families

1190
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:40,080
can't really afford say like a console a home console but also at the same time these these

1191
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,000
Arcades are making a lot more money than the arcades that we have over here, yet their

1192
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,600
games are like dirt cheap.

1193
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:53,440
Like for example, I was playing Cup Cup Zero for like 25 cents a game.

1194
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,360
Well very interesting perspective, I gotta let you go buddy because you're a little quiet

1195
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,120
but thanks so much for calling in to us tonight.

1196
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,160
Have a good one.

1197
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:04,240
You know this reminds me of back when my parents used to take me down to Chuck E. Cheese back

1198
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:08,800
before it was all neon lights and ball bins and it was actually just pizza and arcade

1199
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:14,980
Um, and that's you know, they would totally take me down there and we'd play games and stuff together as a family

1200
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:18,400
You know everybody would you know go and play different video games and not my mom

1201
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,500
She'd hand me a roll of quarters and go sit in the corner. She'll have fun kid

1202
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,700
My mom hates our my mom hates video games

1203
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:32,780
but she she always kind of like every time something interesting happens with our show like, you know last year when we won the

1204
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,440
Podcast award or we were on you know

1205
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,800
You guys are on the news and I think we were all on it at one point two or in the paper

1206
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,920
Remember that those little things that happen my mom always kind of goes, huh?

1207
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,760
Like kind of one of those. Wow. I always told him that would never amount to anything boy was I wrong

1208
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,200
But that makes me feel good

1209
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,700
In a pen. I still don't think it's amounted to much yet until we get actually a paycheck. I guess that's true

1210
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:59,680
What you know what though I in the audience we have is so awesome that I feel rewarded

1211
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:03,840
Anyway, one more call on Skype then we'll wrap it up higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1212
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:09,440
Hi, what's on your mind? You're a little quiet so I'm just going to let you get your thoughts

1213
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,440
out and we'll respond.

1214
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:15,120
Alright, I just wanted to really talk about the arcades because I just came back from

1215
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:19,720
Japan two weeks ago and I wanted to talk about the arcades over there compared to the arcades

1216
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,320
here.

1217
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,400
What was the comparison you made?

1218
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,640
I'm sorry, repeat that?

1219
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,000
What was the comparison you made?

1220
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,520
I just wanted to talk about the arcades in Japan and America because the arcades in Japan

1221
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:37,240
are a whole lot busier, and there's a lot more focus on different styles of gaming.

1222
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:40,800
And the UFO catchers, like the crane games, are a lot bigger over there too.

1223
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:46,400
It's just crazy how much more stuff they have there compared to what we have here.

1224
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,960
Why do you think it's different?

1225
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:54,000
I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the population density in Japan is so

1226
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,920
much bigger, and I think that that kind of makes it more possible for lots of people

1227
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,060
to go to one place.

1228
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,380
Well very interesting perspective.

1229
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,380
We appreciate the phone call.

1230
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:07,380
Have a good one.

1231
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,380
Okay?

1232
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:09,380
All right.

1233
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,380
Thank you.

1234
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,380
Later.

1235
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,380
Bye bye.

1236
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:13,380
I think that was actually a very good point.

1237
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:16,380
Just with, you know, it's actually pretty commonplace for someone to get off work and

1238
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:21,020
then go to a game center or for, you know, children after school to go to the game center

1239
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:24,820
or spend their Sundays there since school's on Saturday too, but I mean I think that that's

1240
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:29,860
actually because it's so integrated into everything and it has been for so long I think that

1241
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:34,100
that is a good reason why it's you know surviving there's a new game center going up

1242
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:39,940
by us by a local theater that we have up um in aldrod hills there's a new gaming center going on

1243
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:44,340

1246

There's a report about the Xbox 360 branded ecstasy popping up in the UK, I thought that

1247
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
was kind of funny.

1248
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Right.

1249
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,240
There's a new type of ecstasy that they're calling Xbox 360 pills.

1250
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,240
So jump in.

1251
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,240

1260
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:49,480

1261
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:55,300
