00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:14,744
[SPEAKER_11]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:19,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:20,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:52,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I have a video game story I'd like to share first.

6
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:53,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that okay, DarkSakura?

7
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:53,993
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about the Wii!

8
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:55,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

9
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:55,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

10
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:57,175
[SPEAKER_12]: This is interesting.

11
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:04,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Toys R Us in Australia is taking pre-orders for the Wii at what equates to $249 US.

12
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:08,900
[SPEAKER_12]: But what's very interesting about this deal is that that comes with a free game.

13
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,502
[SPEAKER_12]: So folks are speculating that this is pretty much proving...

14
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:13,503
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect Pack and Title.

16
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:35,602
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be for the Wii because that would give you a little taste of everything what the Wii can do.

17
00:01:36,182 --> 00:01:40,206
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, if you think about it, that's one thing that they kind of sold to the Nintendo press conference as well.

18
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember that guy who won the contest?

19
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:46,912
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember when they flew all those guys to LA and then only let one come up on stage to play?

20
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:49,554
[SPEAKER_12]: It was Wii Sports, the tennis game.

21
00:01:49,954 --> 00:01:52,917
[SPEAKER_12]: And Wii Tennis, I mean, it's fun, but it's not...

22
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:54,142
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:20,998
[SPEAKER_02]: That you could just put on this collection.

24
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:22,819
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe not even call it Wii Sports.

25
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:25,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Just have it, I don't know, be something.

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Mori in our chatroom seems to think that World Class TrackMe needs to have a Wii version.

27
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:35,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly think that Wii Sports sort of smacks of the Super Scope games.

28
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:37,102
[SPEAKER_07]: How so?

29
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:43,924
[SPEAKER_07]: It just had the multi-games to show off the different things you could play with the Super Scope, like Blastress and that really weird mole game.

30
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:45,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I like the mole game, though.

31
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:46,844
[SPEAKER_07]: It just makes me think of that.

32
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:48,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

33
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:48,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

34
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well that's all I have to say on that story for the Wii.

35
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:59,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well speaking of the Wii, there's been another secret flap that's been spotted.

36
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:02,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, is this like the third or fourth secret flap that's on the Wii?

37
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:09,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Boy, the Wii must sure be feeling like it's getting violated all over left and right with people looking in every flap they can find.

38
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:11,138
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii has compartments everywhere.

39
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:11,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

40
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,419
[SPEAKER_02]: But no idea what it is.

41
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like a SD card port, but...

42
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:20,915
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really odd position for it.

43
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:21,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it that way.

44
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,056
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I think it is?

45
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:26,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might be just nothing.

46
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:30,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just maybe... It's a flap for nothing?

47
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:31,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it actually is not a flap.

48
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:38,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just kind of a hole that would be for... Because it's at the very, very bottom of the console.

49
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:46,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if this were going to be in their little docking bay or whatever it is, I don't think you'd be able to...

50
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:57,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Access this panel, but my guess is it's probably just for the docking stations, probably a clip, you know, so the whole thing snaps in so it doesn't come loose.

51
00:03:58,428 --> 00:03:59,388
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my thought on that.

52
00:03:59,488 --> 00:03:59,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

53
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:01,469
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea what it is.

54
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,309
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be honest, I don't care.

55
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,990
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like some super-duper secret thing.

56
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, VR is hidden in the tiny little thing right there.

57
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:12,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I don't think these flaps are going to have these earth-shattering new features.

58
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:16,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's just going to be for plugs, cards, you know, things you can stick in your Wii.

59
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:24,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, yeah, even looking at this right now, the actual picture that they show of this said flap doesn't even look like a flap.

60
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:30,927
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looks like a part in the console where it might snap in.

61
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,387
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it is.

62
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:33,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

63
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:34,588
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

64
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:43,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, DarkSakura, I know you have some stuff you want to share with the Wii with us, too, but I also understand you have a special shout-out you want to give, so please get that out before you move on.

65
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:48,079
[SPEAKER_07]: To one of, actually, my really good friend's friend.

66
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Her name is Larissa.

67
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,081
[SPEAKER_07]: She was in a car accident a few days ago.

68
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:54,621
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to give a big shout out.

69
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:59,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think she's listening, being that she's currently in the hospital.

70
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:05,205
[SPEAKER_07]: But for anyone who's listening, who knows her, pass on that we wish her a very quick recovery and glad she's coming out of it okay.

71
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

72
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:10,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Hope you get out of the hospital fast, because I know hospitals are not a fun place to be.

73
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:11,227
[SPEAKER_12]: So please get well soon.

74
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:12,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Very much.

75
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:24,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as far as the story that I have, there's actually some more games being mentioned that's coming out for Wii, actually specifically from EA.

76
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:32,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's also Need for Speed Carbon and Madden NFL, but they're also announcing Tiger Woods, Godfather, SSX, and Harry Potter coming out.

77
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:34,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't mind, you know.

78
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, goody, am I going to get to cast spells with the Wii controller?

79
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,552
[SPEAKER_07]: That would actually be cool, you know, if you have to wave it a certain way.

80
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,254
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the little... You're a Harry Potter nerd.

81
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:44,816
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the little spell... Give me some of the spells they say.

82
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:47,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, what makes the light... Luminos or something.

83
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:48,119
[SPEAKER_12]: What do they say?

84
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:48,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Lumos.

85
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Lumos?

86
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

87
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you imagine being able to do that?

88
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,144
[SPEAKER_12]: And if the Wii had a microphone in it, too?

89
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:53,924
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be perfect.

90
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:55,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Use voice recognition.

91
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:56,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my gosh.

92
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:59,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Harry Potter fangirls everywhere are going to, like...

93
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Never Leave the House.

94
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that going to be a microphone attachment?

95
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they say that the Wii... Well, I don't think it's confirmed.

96
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:05,632
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a speaker in it.

97
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:11,935
[SPEAKER_12]: We all know that from E3, but it's rumored that a speaker could easily be a microphone, so why not have a microphone on it, too?

98
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:16,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we have confirmation on that yet, though, but imagine if it did have a microphone.

99
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:24,380
[SPEAKER_12]: You could, you know, say, you know, Luminos and move the thing, and then you might even hear the spell come from the wand, and it would even vibrate.

100
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,661
[SPEAKER_12]: How crazy is that?

101
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:26,561
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be special.

102
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:28,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Special Ed.

103
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:34,799
[SPEAKER_02]: You might need to go Ruminous for it to... It doesn't understand some of the... That's right.

104
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,420
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's going to be like brain training where you have to say, Brew!

105
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Brew!

106
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Ruminous!

107
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,820
[SPEAKER_12]: I swear it works.

108
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,541
[SPEAKER_12]: I swear it works.

109
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:43,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Go back to the OLR archives where I review brain training.

110
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:44,101
[SPEAKER_12]: It really works.

111
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:49,382
[SPEAKER_12]: If you are having a hard time getting your DS to understand you saying Brew, say Brew, and it works every time.

112
00:06:50,062 --> 00:06:50,503
[SPEAKER_12]: At least for me.

113
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:51,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

114
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:52,943
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty awesome.

115
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:56,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those games I'm actually pretty cool.

116
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder how SXX is going to control.

117
00:06:58,582 --> 00:07:00,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Godfather you could just go around shooting people.

118
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:05,770
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's really interesting with all these Wii game announcements that our first thoughts are, I wonder what it's going to play like on the Wii.

119
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,117
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder what that controller is going to do for that game or how that's going to be different because of that whole Wii thing.

120
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:19,681
[SPEAKER_12]: This is very interesting how... I hope they're good because all it's going to take is a couple games that suck with that kind of controller configuration for people to go, ah, damn it.

121
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:21,681
[SPEAKER_12]: But every console has shitty games.

122
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,122
[SPEAKER_12]: I say the other way around.

123
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:27,504
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have a few stellar games, it's really going to sell that console.

124
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:30,665
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of crap games on every console.

125
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,226
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't ruin it for them.

126
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:39,189
[SPEAKER_12]: PS2, wonderful console, legendary console will be remembered for years and years, has some real shit games on it.

127
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:41,303
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's something that's occurring to me?

128
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:45,424
[SPEAKER_07]: There's mentioning a Tiger Woods game, but what's stopping them from making MoCap Golf?

129
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:48,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Or even Police 911?

130
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:49,826
[SPEAKER_07]: With the Wii?

131
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:50,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe?

132
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:56,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I think those are franchises that our developer friends should be looking into.

133
00:07:56,673 --> 00:08:12,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of the Wii, though, and other fun things about it, IGN has actually come in contact with a Wii developer documentation, like kind of a little pamphlet that basically explains to developers how the Wii works and some of the fun little details about it.

134
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:22,103
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that's pretty interesting is there's going to be six kilobytes of non-volatile memory in each controller.

135
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:31,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And the speculation is that it's possible that that will be for storing player settings.

136
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:38,032
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a person that uses Controller 1 all the time, it's going to remember your settings, and that's kind of neat.

137
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:47,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, they're also mentioning that the sensor bar itself is only going to be about 20 centimeters long.

138
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:56,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty much the LEDs, I guess, on the Wii controller and stuff are going to be for battery life and show you that kind of stuff.

139
00:08:57,352 --> 00:09:05,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that light sources from fluorescent halogen plastic mirrors and many more interfere with the actual pointer.

140
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:06,479
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, interesting.

141
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,542
[SPEAKER_02]: But to eliminate this, though, the actual... Don't play in a spaceship.

142
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:16,446
[SPEAKER_02]: No, to eliminate this, it says the pointer must identify the sensor bar and mark its two coordinates.

143
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:28,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And when pointing with the Wiimote, the unit is actually interfacing with the sensor bar, which translates the data to the television and, in effect, simulating a direct aim to the television.

144
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:28,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

145
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:41,532
[SPEAKER_02]: In a sense, it's basically comparing it to an eye measuring the coordinates between 0 and 1023 on the x-axis and 0 and 767 on the y-axis.

146
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:45,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically seeing a megapixel image or something like that.

147
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:46,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of neat.

148
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:50,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says the pointer could sub as a camera.

149
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:52,614
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably like a Pokemon Snap game.

150
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Boy, that controller will do your dishes pretty soon with all these things they keep saying.

151
00:09:56,035 --> 00:10:04,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait for the third party controllers to come out and you know some perverted Japanese company out there is going to turn like Wii controller and sex toy.

152
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:05,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to happen.

153
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:06,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello Kitty Wii.

154
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:08,759
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

155
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, Nintendo, one of their biggest franchises is Pokemon and still after all these years, Pokemon has some very loyal fans.

156
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:17,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Very, very loyal fans.

157
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:23,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Diamond and Pearl is coming out very soon, and a lot of folks have been asking, when is Pokemon going to go online?

158
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:26,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it looks like it's going to be happening soon.

159
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:33,652
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some scans from Famitsu that show Pokemon Diamond and Pearl with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection logo.

160
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:41,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, they have said before that the game would support Wi-Fi, but it was unclear if that meant local Wi-Fi or internet Wi-Fi.

161
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:42,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Internet Wi-Fi

162
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:01,848
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

163
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:31,959
[SPEAKER_12]: To make an MMO out of?

164
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:32,560
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, really?

165
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,161
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, go out, collect monsters, fight other trainers?

166
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,361
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a matter of finding a good concept.

167
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't it kind of surprising?

168
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:40,242
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it is and it isn't.

169
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:42,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo really doesn't do MMOs.

170
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:42,763
[SPEAKER_12]: They never have.

171
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:47,425
[SPEAKER_12]: But really, here's the perfect opportunity for them to get into the MMO.

172
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:48,926
[SPEAKER_12]: And I bet it would be a really big game.

173
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,947
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder why they're holding back.

174
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:54,728
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, maybe the Wii will see something new.

175
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:56,988
[SPEAKER_12]: But do you think Pokemon could work as an MMO?

176
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:57,769
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

177
00:11:57,789 --> 00:11:58,509
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like Pokemon.

178
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:00,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would work very well

179
00:12:23,124 --> 00:12:23,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Pokemon Snap

180
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,061
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Pokemon Snap.

181
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:56,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Pokemon's a great concept, the whole monster collecting.

182
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,204
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's a great franchise.

183
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:02,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the cartoon, I may be over it now.

184
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:04,748
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to watch the cartoon a long time ago, and I think I'm kind of over it now.

185
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:07,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'd watch it once in a while.

186
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:07,823
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a funny thing.

187
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:09,323
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a stoner cartoon now.

188
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:10,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

189
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:11,404
[SPEAKER_12]: I could see that.

190
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, man, he's talking!

191
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:14,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Pikachu!

192
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:15,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Pikachu!

193
00:13:15,865 --> 00:13:16,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Pikachu!

194
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:17,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

195
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:18,105
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

196
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,766
[SPEAKER_12]: But the games are neat.

197
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:24,987
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem is, for me, the games have so much more potential than what Nintendo's doing with it.

198
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:26,428
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just my opinion.

199
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:26,888
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

200
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:28,268
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Pokemon Pinball, though.

201
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:29,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Neo Geo Battle Coliseum

202
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:54,487
[SPEAKER_07]: What am I saying?

203
00:13:54,507 --> 00:13:55,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a fangirl of just about any game.

204
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,750
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be getting it by Ignition.

205
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually going to be out in Europe on PS2 in the autumn.

206
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:12,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically what Battle Coliseum is, it's a fighting in which players use different characters from a range of SNK.

207
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:19,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Different games like World of Heroes, Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown, Last Blade, Metal Slug, Kizuna Encounter.

208
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:27,576
[SPEAKER_07]: and you'll have your regular fighting modes, but you'll also have tag battle.

209
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:30,578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of making me think of King of Fighters, but not quite.

210
00:14:30,998 --> 00:14:46,487
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a rumor of six different hidden characters, but it's actually going to be out with other games like King of Fighters 11, King of Fighters Maximum Impact 2, SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters, and Metal Slug Anthology.

211
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:50,710
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be awesome as if that game, one of the hidden fighters, is Magical Lord.

212
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:52,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that game?

213
00:14:52,531 --> 00:14:53,372
[SPEAKER_02]: That game was awesome.

214
00:14:54,832 --> 00:15:01,456
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I used to play when they had those Neo Geo machines down at Rayleigh's or something like that.

215
00:15:01,496 --> 00:15:03,097
[SPEAKER_07]: We need hidden characters to be Bub and Bob.

216
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:04,277
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they need to do?

217
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:11,921
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to take this and kind of make another Capcom vs. SNK and actually put some of the characters like Mel's characters and stuff.

218
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:17,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been hearing rumors about DC vs. Capcom.

219
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.

220
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:21,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's still a rumor, but

221
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:26,226
[SPEAKER_07]: They should actually do DC vs. Marvel as a fighting game.

222
00:15:26,406 --> 00:15:27,247
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be tough.

223
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:30,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think either one of those comic companies would want to do something like that.

224
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,852
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure Capcom would love to make that game.

225
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:34,494
[SPEAKER_07]: They were together before.

226
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:40,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Eddie in our chatroom seems to think that the listeners should rally together to make an Orange Lounge radio card game.

227
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:42,586
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think there's enough.

228
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:43,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Our own collectible card game.

229
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:47,468
[SPEAKER_12]: You would have to really go back into the show's history to get enough people.

230
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:59,333
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, granted, there's the three of us that host the show, and obviously Mikotov's here half the time, and even in recent memory we've had some other guests, but really we haven't had the orgy of guests we used to have during some of our live shows back in the day.

231
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,614
[SPEAKER_12]: You'd have to way go back to some of our old members.

232
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:03,455
[SPEAKER_07]: They do it in Magic, where you have your fire...

233
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:08,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Fire Jamie, Earth Jamie Battle of the Portable Systems

234
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:36,969
[SPEAKER_02]: The DS has actually overtaken the PSP in sales in the United States.

235
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:44,314
[SPEAKER_02]: So, now Sony can't brag that the PSP is at least winning in the United States because they're getting their ass handed to them now.

236
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:57,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Sales, though, overall in video games have gone up about 25%, but in the sold units, as far as the two consoles are concerned, the Nintendo DS is right now over $5,200.

237
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:01,883
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP is currently at 4.7 million units.

238
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:25,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically the DS Lite kind of pushed them over the limit there.

239
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:28,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of new games, of course, coming out for the DS.

240
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:35,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, the PSP hasn't had that many great releases lately, so it's kind of hurting.

241
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,171
[SPEAKER_02]: But you watch when Vice City Stories comes out.

242
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:38,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

243
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:47,936
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, beyond that, though, the Xbox 360 has finally reached 2 million units in the United States about time.

244
00:17:49,264 --> 00:18:18,851
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course the Playstation 2 is still selling pretty strong they sold another 300,000 units in June alone and puts the total up to about 34 million units in the United States which is almost as many Game Boy Advance units out there they're up to almost 33 million Game Boy Advance of course now if you think about it how many Game Boy Advance systems have there been I mean there's tons of different reiterations so that's pretty cool that sounds pretty cool

245
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:26,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as far as things that are coming out, we actually have our Europe release dates, if anybody is interested.

246
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:29,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I know our European listeners would probably be very interested.

247
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:44,679
[SPEAKER_12]: I've noticed we've actually had an increase in the amount of listeners coming from Europe lately, and part of the reason for that, as I understand it, is that folks over there are very appreciative that we are an American gaming show that is willing to acknowledge that there's other people around the world that play video games.

248
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:47,960
[SPEAKER_12]: So, thank you guys for recognizing what we try to recognize.

249
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:49,948
[SPEAKER_07]: I love hearing from our UK listeners.

250
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:50,388
[SPEAKER_07]: They're great.

251
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:51,308
[SPEAKER_12]: I love hearing from everywhere.

252
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,229
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't have to be UK.

253
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:53,570
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be anywhere.

254
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,832
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gotten emails from all over the world and I'm always looking forward to it.

255
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:59,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially Canada lately because I was just there.

256
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:02,774
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm on a Canada kick lately.

257
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:03,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Canada.

258
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:05,596
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to give you one of the maple cookies I got there.

259
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:06,316
[SPEAKER_12]: So good.

260
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:06,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

261
00:19:06,736 --> 00:19:08,797
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go get one right now while you do the next story.

262
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:11,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Addict, huh?

263
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:12,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

264
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,301
[SPEAKER_07]: What we have coming out though, just a handful of games on the 21st.

265
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:16,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh,

266
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,121
[SPEAKER_07]: The following three are on PSP.

267
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:29,224
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Def Jam, Fight for New York, The Takeover, Field Commander, Me Sneezing, and no, Jamie Sneezing the game isn't.

268
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:29,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

269
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:30,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Cookie.

270
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:31,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

271
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:32,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

272
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:34,125
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, oh, God, I smell like syrup.

273
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:35,546
[SPEAKER_12]: They're hella good.

274
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:36,266
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, guys.

275
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:37,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Back to game.

276
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:38,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

277
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,307
[SPEAKER_12]: These cookies are the shit.

278
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:40,847
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we have another list.

279
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:42,528
[SPEAKER_12]: I think one of our listeners is in Vancouver.

280
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:44,109
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to make him send me more of these cookies.

281
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:45,349
[SPEAKER_12]: They are so freaking good.

282
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:46,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, sorry.

283
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,017
[SPEAKER_07]: My eyes are rolling back in my head.

284
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:48,658
[SPEAKER_07]: They are good.

285
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:48,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

286
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:49,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

287
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:51,078
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was saying.

288
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:52,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, UK listeners.

289
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:58,080
[SPEAKER_07]: For PSP, we have Def Jam, Fight for New York, The Takeover, Field Commander, and Infected.

290
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out on PlayStation 2, we have Super World Police.

291
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:11,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Some things to look forward to, though, the next week is Juiced Eliminator, Pac-Man World 3, Civ 4, Civ City Rome.

292
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:13,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of...

293
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:14,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty cool stuff coming out.

294
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:18,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Shin Megami Tensei and The Ant Bully.

295
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:20,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

296
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Miami Vice is on here.

297
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:23,773
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the point?

298
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:25,654
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing a Miami Vice movie.

299
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:26,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's movie time.

300
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:28,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but still, what's the point?

301
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Pastel suits should have stayed gone in the 80s.

302
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:34,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's my tangent.

303
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:35,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

304
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:39,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, in the U.S., similar stuff.

305
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:40,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot.

306
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:51,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you are ready for some football, NCAA Football 07 is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and the PSP.

307
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:53,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So check those out.

308
00:20:53,995 --> 00:21:01,099
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not a fan of football, you may be a fan of CG animated movies, in which case Monster House will be the game for you.

309
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:07,423
[SPEAKER_02]: That comes out on PlayStation 2, GameCube, the DS, and the Game Boy Advance.

310
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:13,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not a fan of either of those, maybe you're a fan of Super Dragon Ball Z, which is coming out on PlayStation 2.

311
00:21:14,836 --> 00:21:24,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, of course, there's Blade Dancer on the PSP, Valkyrie Profile, Lineth, which is a remake of the very first Valkyrie Profile on the PSP.

312
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And Miami Vice is also coming out on the PSP.

313
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:31,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a PSP-only title, which was kind of interesting, but it looks pretty decent.

314
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:33,391
[SPEAKER_02]: So be sure to check it out.

315
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:37,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

316
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:44,173
[SPEAKER_12]: and... Did you want to say something on The Sims 2?

317
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:45,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm sorry.

318
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:48,215
[SPEAKER_12]: I did want to mention something.

319
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:53,418
[SPEAKER_12]: We have two listeners from Vancouver in chat, so I'm reminiscing my trip and telling them where to get the cookies.

320
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:55,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie and I are eating right now.

321
00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:58,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Those cookies are addicting.

322
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,930
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a farmer's market.

323
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,972
[SPEAKER_12]: They do this little island called Granville Island.

324
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:01,853
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

325
00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:03,154
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry to turn this into cookie chat.

326
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:05,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Just do your game thing.

327
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:07,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I would like to talk about something.

328
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:11,341
[SPEAKER_02]: GameSpot actually, they had their kind of retail radar thing.

329
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:20,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was actually a rumor control article that they had about during E3, EA had a game coming out called Sims 2 Pets.

330
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:47,355
[SPEAKER_02]: and Sims 2 Pets was supposed to be this PC only kind of almost like an expansion for the Sims 2 but I can confirm now today that Sims 2 Pets is actually coming to the consoles and you'll be able to play that here pretty soon it is coming coming out here I believe was it towards the fourth quarter and

331
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:49,455
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

332
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:14,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to try and murder the pets like you murder people?

333
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to check this game out.

334
00:23:16,117 --> 00:23:24,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially on the PC, because if you can kill it... I mean, granted, that's morbid, but I killed the Sims, so... You know, GS191 in chat has an excellent point, though.

335
00:23:25,223 --> 00:23:26,544
[SPEAKER_12]: He has a message to EA here.

336
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:28,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop making the Sims and work on Spore.

337
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:31,667
[SPEAKER_12]: They are working on Spore.

338
00:23:32,107 --> 00:23:33,248
[SPEAKER_12]: But I like Spore more.

339
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:36,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Even from the demos I've seen, I'm like, Spore!

340
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Need Spore now!

341
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:40,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Give it to me!

342
00:23:41,238 --> 00:23:43,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, that game is going to be a serious crack for people.

343
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,461
[SPEAKER_12]: If you think The Sims is bad, just wait for Spore.

344
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:47,082
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm telling you.

345
00:23:47,102 --> 00:23:49,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Spore is... That's all people are going to be talking about next year.

346
00:23:50,103 --> 00:23:54,546
[SPEAKER_02]: People in China are going to be killing themselves for spending too much time on there.

347
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:59,249
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to leave babies in hot cars and not feed them and all that fun stuff.

348
00:24:00,165 --> 00:24:01,486
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

349
00:24:20,702 --> 00:24:21,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Mario stuff.

350
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:23,965
[SPEAKER_12]: But here, they're putting these characters into the game.

351
00:24:24,405 --> 00:24:30,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Moogle, White Mage, Ninja, Black Mage, and a Cactar named Sabotender.

352
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,553
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're not sure quite what that means yet, but at least you're getting a Cactar.

353
00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:35,253
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of cool.

354
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:38,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Makes me think of this great overlooked PS1 title.

355
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:39,717
[SPEAKER_12]: At least I like this game.

356
00:24:39,757 --> 00:24:43,379
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think a lot of people did, but Chocobo Racing was a game they had on PS1.

357
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:45,000
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of like a Mario Kart type game.

358
00:24:45,341 --> 00:24:49,184
[SPEAKER_12]: But you could be like White Mage or Black Mage or a Chocobo and you could actually unlock...

359
00:24:49,983 --> 00:24:53,944
[SPEAKER_12]: You could unlock Squall, I think was one, and I want to say you got Cloud at some point, too.

360
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:55,244
[SPEAKER_12]: You could unlock all these characters.

361
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:56,445
[SPEAKER_12]: It was actually a fun little racer.

362
00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:59,226
[SPEAKER_12]: I really wish they'd revisit that concept.

363
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,086
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was a cute little game.

364
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:08,668
[SPEAKER_02]: My message to Square and Nintendo, stop working on Mario Hoops.

365
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:10,849
[SPEAKER_02]: No one cares about Mario Hoops.

366
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:14,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I care about a new Super Mario RPG.

367
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,391
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Nintendo and Square Enix should be working on, is not...

368
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:20,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid basketball game, whatever.

369
00:25:22,702 --> 00:25:23,282
[SPEAKER_02]: But fine.

370
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:24,883
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they're doing something new.

371
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:26,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't complain, I guess.

372
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:27,544
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will.

373
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:28,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I will complain.

374
00:25:29,464 --> 00:25:31,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, on a completely different topic, though.

375
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:34,506
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually kind of follows with more complaining.

376
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:44,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the ex-frag dolls are attacking the whole sponsorships of gaming teams and Girl Gamers topic.

377
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of interesting, though.

378
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:48,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically...

379
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:55,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote here from them, Although we may have strong opinions, you can be sure of one thing.

380
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:58,430
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not here to endorse any product or sell you anything.

381
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,672
[SPEAKER_02]: If we say it, it's because we mean it, not because it pays our wage.

382
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:13,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of, you know, basically attacking the frag dolls and those girl gaming teams, especially the ones that are sponsored by Ubisoft or Microsoft, etc.

383
00:26:14,037 --> 00:26:16,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I'm going to get back more into this here.

384
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:24,371
[SPEAKER_02]: On a similar note, we may be both girls who game, but we are not here to wave the girl gamer flag.

385
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:29,773
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe that drawing attention to the gender, you create a barrier that's otherwise irrelevant.

386
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:43,839
[SPEAKER_02]: In our experience, promoting girl gamers can often be used as a cover story of big business, but trying to widen its market share while still getting some pretty faces in the magazines.

387
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,500
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, free advertising.

388
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,901
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they're kind of a

389
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:52,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out and saying that these girl gamer groups are nothing more than a marketing ploy and they suck.

390
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:57,652
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really know what to think about all this stuff anymore.

391
00:26:57,812 --> 00:27:00,274
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just like, just shut up and play games.

392
00:27:00,614 --> 00:27:00,935
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care.

393
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:05,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I want to tell a lot of these people, you know, the people that are passionate on both sides of it is like, make it about the games.

394
00:27:06,478 --> 00:27:07,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just go back to the games.

395
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, when it needs to come back down to, it needs to come to

396
00:27:11,943 --> 00:27:12,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

397
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:36,714
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be all that matters, unfortunately, if you are on the receiving end of the discrimination.

398
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:44,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but as a homosexual, I've been on somewhat the receiving end of that discrimination before, too.

399
00:27:44,982 --> 00:27:47,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Having to put up with a lot of MMOs, you know, that's gay and this is gay.

400
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:55,711
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't let that kind of talk really get to me, but I know that it's tough for any type of minority, really.

401
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:57,933
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know.

402
00:27:57,973 --> 00:27:59,254
[SPEAKER_12]: At the same time, it's like,

403
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:06,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Because of the internet, in a way, people can be people that they're really not, at least in an MMO.

404
00:28:06,947 --> 00:28:08,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Guys can play girls, girls can play guys.

405
00:28:08,848 --> 00:28:12,110
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a great way for everybody to be anonymous.

406
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,751
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't know what's sitting behind an Xbox Live gamer tag.

407
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:19,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, you can hear a voice, but even then, some people play Xbox Live and don't use their voice.

408
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:19,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Or mask it.

409
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:22,596
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you can't do that on 360, but the old school one you could.

410
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:23,056
[SPEAKER_07]: On the old one, yeah.

411
00:28:23,176 --> 00:28:23,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

412
00:28:23,797 --> 00:28:24,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it was awful.

413
00:28:24,518 --> 00:28:29,321
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I knew a guy in college that had a really, really high-pitched voice and sounded like a girl.

414
00:28:30,762 --> 00:28:35,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and a lot of Xbox Live sounds like that, too, where you don't know what gender it is because it's so ridiculous.

415
00:28:35,906 --> 00:28:38,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to poke you, noob.

416
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:39,789
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you can't tell really what they're saying.

417
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:40,890
[SPEAKER_02]: They all sound the same.

418
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:41,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody sounds the same.

419
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:48,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, if it's on PSO, you get your own feedback first before you hear everybody else's.

420
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,581
[SPEAKER_12]: and join the OL Army.

421
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:54,763
[SPEAKER_12]: We're all about, you know, just shut up and play the game.

422
00:28:54,823 --> 00:28:59,105
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter what you look like, who you sleep with, what gender you are.

423
00:28:59,165 --> 00:28:59,666
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter.

424
00:28:59,826 --> 00:29:00,266
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter.

425
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Just play a game and have fun and don't be a dick.

426
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:03,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

427
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:04,628
[SPEAKER_12]: And speaking of the OL Army.

428
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:05,909
[SPEAKER_12]: That's rule number one of the OL Army.

429
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:06,489
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't be a dick.

430
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Or a twat.

431
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:11,252
[SPEAKER_12]: He said twat.

432
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of things, though, that are super cool.

433
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:15,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

434
00:29:16,294 --> 00:29:17,875
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, blah, blah, blah.

435
00:29:18,678 --> 00:29:19,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Tungtai today.

436
00:29:48,901 --> 00:30:10,830
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically that's the OLR army and we're looking for anybody that's got a mech in the game doesn't matter what you know you're playing that's all good and there is a password though up up down down is the password I couldn't add the rest of the Konami code because there's just not enough space for it but up up down down is the password to get in and don't be a dick

437
00:30:11,414 --> 00:30:12,135
[SPEAKER_02]: and Don'tBeADick.

438
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,516
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be a dick to other people.

439
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:15,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfectly fine in the game.

440
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:17,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a dick to each other.

441
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:19,281
[SPEAKER_02]: We totally approve of smack talking in the game.

442
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:20,442
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

443
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Because after all, you're all on a team.

444
00:30:23,424 --> 00:30:24,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Be excellent to each other.

445
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:25,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Party on.

446
00:30:27,568 --> 00:30:28,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going to party on?

447
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:30,150
[SPEAKER_12]: So can I do my thing now?

448
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:30,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you may.

449
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:30,991
[SPEAKER_07]: You may.

450
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:32,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you may do your thing.

451
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:33,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you need your music for your thing?

452
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:34,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

453
00:30:34,273 --> 00:30:35,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel incomplete without it.

454
00:30:37,856 --> 00:30:38,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

455
00:30:38,397 --> 00:30:39,498
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all happy and cute.

456
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:49,685
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I have been hanging out on the interwebs, and actually this is one that was brought to my attention at California Extreme.

457
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:54,647
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, uh, go to www.thefutureofpinball.com.

458
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:57,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, again, I'm still stuck on pinball.

459
00:30:57,508 --> 00:31:01,450
[SPEAKER_07]: But this, um, actually we watched their, uh, little, uh,

460
00:31:02,438 --> 00:31:02,978
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

461
00:31:31,508 --> 00:31:38,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Because pinball, basically, the way that the pinball industry was staying going was the fact that you have this machine that does this.

462
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:41,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now we have to make this machine obsolete.

463
00:31:41,492 --> 00:31:42,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Our competition is ourself.

464
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:48,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, once, you know, we lost Capcom, and Williams basically only had themselves.

465
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:57,179
[SPEAKER_07]: To keep, you know, to keep that whole area open, they had to basically make their old machines obsolete and make new things that people wanted to do.

466
00:31:57,199 --> 00:32:00,100
[SPEAKER_07]: So Pinball 2000 was how they were going to revive the whole...

467
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:26,862
[SPEAKER_07]: pinball industry except they decided to close it down anyway now they make casino machines but this it was it was very cool it also has some footage of some very rare machines like this I think it's called pinball carnival or something to that effect but it's basically like a multi-layer pinball machine we have to work about getting it to the top of the thing

468
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:29,423
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very cool, very cool, very big machine.

469
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:32,463
[SPEAKER_07]: But lots of really cool stuff.

470
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:43,426
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're into pinball, if you're into video games in general, because the other good thing about this is that it brings in techniques that were actually incorporated into some of the old games, like the... What was the update to Space Invaders?

471
00:32:44,226 --> 00:32:47,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you have the background behind it, but the thing projected over it.

472
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,188
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember, but yeah, I know what game you're talking about, though.

473
00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:50,908
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

474
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:52,970
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very cool.

475
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I suggest checking it out again.

476
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,991
[SPEAKER_07]: It's thefutureofpinball.com.

477
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:59,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this guy's movie is supposed to be out around October, I want to say.

478
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:02,134
[SPEAKER_07]: So check out the trailer.

479
00:33:02,194 --> 00:33:02,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of good stuff.

480
00:33:03,475 --> 00:33:04,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting.

481
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:05,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

482
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:08,137
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking about...

483
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:10,305
[SPEAKER_02]: The next generation of stuff.

484
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:17,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, of course, revealed this week their brand new media player called the Zune.

485
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,353
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, it's not meant for games.

486
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:23,056
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does look very similar to an iPod, kind of.

487
00:33:23,296 --> 00:33:25,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's got a giant screen on it though.

488
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:31,404
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's basically going to be used for just playing games and

489
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,329
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

490
00:33:54,434 --> 00:34:01,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly, this isn't the only device that they're releasing as part of that, so maybe a portable gaming device out there, but not this one.

491
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:04,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Zune is not a gaming device.

492
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on to a completely different topic in regards to Sony and the Blu-ray.

493
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:15,478
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of an iffy thing because it came through Internet Movie Database, but

494
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:21,140
[SPEAKER_12]: A Chinese newspaper is reporting that Sony is having some major problems with Blu-ray production.

495
00:34:22,282 --> 00:34:29,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Supposedly, production facilities are not being able to meet the demand for the diode that generates the blue laser that puts the blue in Blu-ray.

496
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:34,876
[SPEAKER_12]: And apparently, Sony's own plants and some at Nisha Corp.

497
00:34:34,896 --> 00:34:35,337
[SPEAKER_12]: in Japan

498
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:38,798
[SPEAKER_12]: have been having run-ins regarding supply shortcoming.

499
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,881
[SPEAKER_12]: This may not only affect the supply of DVD players' Blu-ray, but it might also affect the PlayStation 3.

500
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:47,882
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know.

501
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:50,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Could be running into some delay problems with PlayStation 3.

502
00:34:50,363 --> 00:34:55,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Delays or possibly low yields might even have a huge shortage.

503
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:57,467
[SPEAKER_02]: More of a shortage than the Xbox 360.

504
00:34:57,527 --> 00:35:00,208
[SPEAKER_02]: People thought, you know, the Xbox 360 launch was botched.

505
00:35:01,348 --> 00:35:02,329
[SPEAKER_02]: You ain't seen nothing yet.

506
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:05,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

507
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:10,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know there's supposed to be a Pirates MMO?

508
00:35:11,696 --> 00:35:12,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Pirates of the Caribbean?

509
00:35:12,597 --> 00:35:12,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

510
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're saying that there's going to be user-submitted content.

511
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:30,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, as far as user-submitted content, I'm really not sure how that's going to be feasible in-game, honestly.

512
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:33,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go ahead and read this quote here off of Kotaku.

513
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:37,829
[SPEAKER_07]: It simply cannot be the case that Flying Lab meant what they say above.

514
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:39,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, what they were saying...

515
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,913
[SPEAKER_07]: is that they're going to let you put in user-submitted and peer-reviewed content.

516
00:35:46,614 --> 00:36:06,605
[SPEAKER_07]: But to get back into the quote, the developers must intend to have a high degree of control over the designs that make their way into the world because it is a certainty that if they don't want the entire Port Royal Harbor to look like T-shirts at a fanfare with sales that feature large-breasted elven princesses, Darth Vader in a jaunty pirate hat, and slogans like minus 50 DKP or WTS...

517
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,869
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

518
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:11,550
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a great quote.

519
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:15,816
[SPEAKER_12]: How many freaking Jack Sparrows are going to be on that game?

520
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:17,939
[SPEAKER_12]: How many Sephiroths are in Final Fantasy XI?

521
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:19,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Captain Jack Sephiroth.

522
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:22,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I will kill you all.

523
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:22,980
[SPEAKER_12]: And Lakot.

524
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,562
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the idea... I'm going to be honest.

525
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,725
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm probably the only person in the world that has not seen either Pirates of the Caribbean movie.

526
00:36:30,746 --> 00:36:33,668
[SPEAKER_12]: But I still think the concept of this MMO game is kind of cool.

527
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:39,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Except it does make me cry a little bit because Puzzle Pirates was such the cutest little MMO.

528
00:36:39,473 --> 00:36:40,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, there's been...

529
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:41,855
[SPEAKER_12]: There's still Puzzle Pirates.

530
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:01,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates

531
00:37:30,526 --> 00:37:31,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates

532
00:37:45,982 --> 00:37:48,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox Live Arcade is going to get a free game.

533
00:37:48,844 --> 00:37:51,785
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you too can play Texas Hold'em for free.

534
00:37:52,225 --> 00:37:56,427
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out August 23rd and it will be free.

535
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,948
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in no money.

536
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:01,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So be sure to check it out when it comes out.

537
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to support tournaments and 8 players online.

538
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,953
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like Microsoft wants to get you gambling.

539
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:08,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds pretty cool.

540
00:38:09,194 --> 00:38:12,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I remember correctly, I think this game also supported the live vision camera.

541
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:14,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be kind of neat too.

542
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:20,156
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually another demo on Xbox 360.

543
00:38:20,977 --> 00:38:22,558
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the Lord of the Rings demo.

544
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:27,081
[SPEAKER_07]: The Battle for Middle Earth 2 is actually on Xbox Live Marketplace now.

545
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:30,883
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at 148.84 megabytes.

546
00:38:30,904 --> 00:38:31,524
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty funny.

547
00:38:32,284 --> 00:38:34,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And has a single and multiplayer available.

548
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:37,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Has a tutorial to tell you how to play it.

549
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there's also First Mission available on there, too.

550
00:38:42,312 --> 00:38:42,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

551
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:47,783
[SPEAKER_07]: and lots of themes have also been made available on the marketplace too.

552
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:51,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting because I saw this and I downloaded it but I haven't actually played it yet.

553
00:38:53,606 --> 00:38:55,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's kind of neat.

554
00:38:56,497 --> 00:38:59,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure about the whole Lord of the Rings aspect of it.

555
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:02,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just waiting for a good RTS game to be on there.

556
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like Command & Conquer.

557
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:09,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Command & Conquer 3, when they're putting that out, would be pretty awesome.

558
00:39:10,003 --> 00:39:11,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably going to put that out on the 360.

559
00:39:11,123 --> 00:39:16,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were testing to see how well a game like that would do with Lord of the Rings, so it should be interesting.

560
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:21,762
[SPEAKER_12]: I will want to check this demo out, just because I like free stuff, even if it's just demos.

561
00:39:21,982 --> 00:39:43,506
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing to mention, though, about that demo, they did have, um, slightly before the demo was released, they had a walkthrough of the demo, um, which was kind of interesting, um, and that was pretty cool, and they also had a walkthrough of some other demo, and I remember a walkthrough of the demo of, um, To Human, I believe, or no, not To Human, um,

562
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:46,798
[SPEAKER_02]: God, what the hell the other game was.

563
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:54,023
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, there were three walkthroughs on there and two demos, so possibly a third demo coming out.

564
00:39:54,464 --> 00:40:00,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that was their new MMO, their sci-fi MMO, which for some reason the name is escaping me.

565
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

566
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:07,654
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, we're going to move on to an interactive element of our show.

567
00:40:07,694 --> 00:40:12,478
[SPEAKER_12]: We love to get mails from you guys every week at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

568
00:40:13,134 --> 00:40:13,855
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

569
00:40:37,694 --> 00:40:42,159
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura reads them all, and I read some of them too, but we don't have time to respond on air to all of them.

570
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:45,663
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are quite a number that I'm going to actually make a typed response to.

571
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, and real quick, that was Mass Effect I was talking about.

572
00:40:48,807 --> 00:40:49,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, here we go.

573
00:40:49,828 --> 00:40:50,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag!

574
00:40:52,531 --> 00:40:54,934
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one comes from Brandon from Texas.

575
00:40:55,407 --> 00:40:56,448
[SPEAKER_07]: This is good afternoon.

576
00:40:56,989 --> 00:40:58,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it is sort of afternoon now, isn't it?

577
00:40:59,071 --> 00:41:01,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a new listener of your podcast and love it.

578
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:05,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to make a comment about the comments about game patching you did in episode 190.

579
00:41:05,498 --> 00:41:09,282
[SPEAKER_07]: It is always a bad idea to rush a product out and fix it later.

580
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,084
[SPEAKER_07]: The examples of why is Windows XP.

581
00:41:12,026 --> 00:41:16,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft has rushed the development of XP and caused it to be inherently insecure.

582
00:41:17,248 --> 00:41:20,370
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't until Service Pack 2 that the majority of security flaws were fixed.

583
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, there are still problems.

584
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,953
[SPEAKER_07]: The sad reality is that if there is buggy software, it is a risk to security and your systems.

585
00:41:27,013 --> 00:41:28,673
[SPEAKER_07]: People can exploit a flaw in a Wii game.

586
00:41:29,194 --> 00:41:31,195
[SPEAKER_07]: It will cause cheating and other malignant hacks.

587
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:32,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that use of malignant.

588
00:41:33,776 --> 00:41:34,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm the grammar nerd.

589
00:41:35,857 --> 00:41:36,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Madatuma.

590
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:39,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

591
00:42:01,483 --> 00:42:03,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Good email.

592
00:42:03,585 --> 00:42:05,467
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the comparison.

593
00:42:05,527 --> 00:42:12,553
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the point that he's trying to make with XP being, you know, they have tons of flaws and they're always releasing patches for it all the time.

594
00:42:12,593 --> 00:42:14,054
[SPEAKER_12]: He still has tons of flaws.

595
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:21,481
[SPEAKER_12]: At the same time, to me, it's a little bit of apples and oranges because you're talking about an operating system, which is like the backbone of the computer, versus a game.

596
00:42:22,145 --> 00:42:23,566
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little bit apples and oranges for me.

597
00:42:23,586 --> 00:42:28,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get me wrong, I get the comparison, but it's a little bit apples and oranges for me.

598
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you what system actually that would have been a very accurate comparison to is the Dreamcast.

599
00:42:33,194 --> 00:42:39,579
[SPEAKER_07]: For any of the games that ran in the Windows CE environment, the game loads Windows CE onto the system prior to playing the game.

600
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:50,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even more recent, some of the Xbox 360 games and their save game errors, which once you're playing through some of the game, you go back into it and your save game's gone.

601
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:51,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

602
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:56,345
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something that they had to patch and fix and hopefully I think it's fixed by now.

603
00:42:57,305 --> 00:42:57,805
[SPEAKER_02]: More mail!

604
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:11,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, actually an email from our dear friend Rob with two B's actually sent me a little bit of an article that was posted on Instant Replay about Namco of America.

605
00:43:12,151 --> 00:43:12,971
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a new president.

606
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:18,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Toyoshi Nishikawa is now the president and CEO of

607
00:43:19,653 --> 00:43:48,193
[SPEAKER_12]: COO of Namco America Incorporated Kevin Hayes is now going to be focusing on Namco Cybertainment which is the arcade good I mean good that arcade stuff is going up you know I was listening to another show I think it was Bobby talking about arcade stuff and how there's kind of a need to re-energize what's going on in the arcade scene and I want to say it was something like Sega

608
00:43:49,516 --> 00:43:52,777
[SPEAKER_12]: had a big interest in trying to revitalize what was going on in the arcade market.

609
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:58,998
[SPEAKER_12]: I know some of the things that they were citing was look at a game like Derby Owner's Club that has a huge social following behind it.

610
00:43:59,258 --> 00:44:05,540
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really where arcades can come back to life is through the social element.

611
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at DDR.

612
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,521
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, hell, this show was born of the social element of DDR.

613
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:13,562
[SPEAKER_12]: It boils down to something as simple as that.

614
00:44:13,582 --> 00:44:14,082
[SPEAKER_12]: That's

615
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:16,183
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

616
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:34,632
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that people are putting resources back into making arcades fun.

617
00:44:34,812 --> 00:44:36,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Because arcades have so much potential.

618
00:44:36,994 --> 00:44:38,655
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pretty much dying over here for a little while.

619
00:44:38,955 --> 00:44:40,136
[SPEAKER_12]: But they need to come back to life.

620
00:44:40,156 --> 00:44:41,077
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so much potential.

621
00:44:41,357 --> 00:44:44,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's actually pretty good that they brought over somebody from the Japanese side of it.

622
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:51,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the arcades there are still... If they're not surviving fully, they're still going on strong.

623
00:44:51,646 --> 00:44:54,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's been as many closures there as there were here.

624
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:56,750
[SPEAKER_07]: But a little bit more background on Nishikawa.

625
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,471
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been with Namco since 1987.

626
00:45:01,144 --> 00:45:05,746
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been the EVP CEO since January.

627
00:45:06,306 --> 00:45:09,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically he's been with Namco for a while.

628
00:45:09,447 --> 00:45:11,767
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a lot of experience in the company.

629
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:17,469
[SPEAKER_07]: So being that I am a big Namco fan, I worked for several of their arcades.

630
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,390
[SPEAKER_12]: A GS68 in our chatroom has a great comment too.

631
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Maximum Tune 2 is very social as well.

632
00:45:23,691 --> 00:45:23,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

633
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:28,792
[SPEAKER_12]: This could be a good thing for arcades.

634
00:45:29,032 --> 00:45:31,273
[SPEAKER_12]: So congratulations on your promotions, boys.

635
00:45:31,933 --> 00:45:37,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of arcades, I was at Riptide Arcade yesterday.

636
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:40,816
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the Pier 39 one, right?

637
00:45:40,896 --> 00:45:41,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, in San Francisco.

638
00:45:41,996 --> 00:45:45,457
[SPEAKER_07]: They have now this machine that you can win iPods and...

639
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:46,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I've seen those, yeah.

640
00:45:46,757 --> 00:45:48,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And PSPs and DSs out of.

641
00:45:48,698 --> 00:45:51,000
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw one at Universal CityWalk in one of the random stores there.

642
00:45:51,261 --> 00:45:53,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, we've all been traveling a lot lately.

643
00:45:53,102 --> 00:45:56,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, we have these, like, I've had these random Reno, Canada stories.

644
00:45:57,886 --> 00:45:58,727
[SPEAKER_12]: And LA.

645
00:45:58,787 --> 00:46:00,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Including interesting text messages.

646
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:01,650
[SPEAKER_12]: San Francisco.

647
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:02,470
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

648
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:06,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in San Francisco, San Jose, Los Gatos, like, in the span of two days.

649
00:46:06,654 --> 00:46:07,555
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of crazy.

650
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:07,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

651
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:09,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, back to the emails.

652
00:46:10,177 --> 00:46:10,998
[SPEAKER_07]: One from Fireboma.

653
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:13,809
[SPEAKER_07]: One of our long-time listeners.

654
00:46:37,632 --> 00:46:43,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Xplay, the show that usually laden with knowledge about obscure Japanese RPGs and action games, forgot to do its homework and is now talking out of its ass.

655
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:55,622
[SPEAKER_07]: The main problem is that this lack of knowledge about the Bimani series when it comes to comparing Guitar Hero to other games is commonplace in many publications about the Guitar Hero series, calling it groundbreaking and such.

656
00:46:56,022 --> 00:47:00,685
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like calling In the Groove a unique dancing game the likes of which never have been seen before.

657
00:47:01,525 --> 00:47:04,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering what your thoughts on this issue and what you think about Xplay's review.

658
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:09,005
[SPEAKER_12]: I think as far as X-Play's review goes, I think you pretty much said it right there.

659
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:11,046
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if they didn't do the research, you can tell.

660
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:13,307
[SPEAKER_12]: It shows, and it makes you mad or whatever.

661
00:47:13,727 --> 00:47:21,690
[SPEAKER_12]: So their review, they will bear the brunt of the fan base getting mad at them for their review.

662
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:26,852
[SPEAKER_12]: But unfortunately, it's kind of a trend you're seeing because while... Here it is for me.

663
00:47:27,272 --> 00:47:29,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Guitar Hero is a good game.

664
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:31,114
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, it's a great game.

665
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:33,063
[SPEAKER_12]: But people give it too much credit.

666
00:47:33,503 --> 00:47:36,924
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't do as much as people think it did.

667
00:47:37,064 --> 00:47:43,606
[SPEAKER_12]: And the problem is, exactly what this is, is that people are giving Guitar Hero credit for something it didn't do.

668
00:47:44,006 --> 00:47:47,187
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was like creating the music genre, essentially.

669
00:47:48,288 --> 00:47:50,788
[SPEAKER_12]: In a way, creating the music-making genre, I should say.

670
00:47:50,808 --> 00:47:53,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you could go back, Beatmania didn't really create the music.

671
00:47:53,789 --> 00:48:00,031
[SPEAKER_12]: And you could go back further and say Parappa the Rapper was really... But as far as the music-making genre, Beatmania is really the granddaddy

672
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:03,909
[SPEAKER_12]: and so you can't credit Guitar Hero with that.

673
00:48:04,149 --> 00:48:03,909
1998.

674
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:06,936
[SPEAKER_12]: But you can credit Guitar Hero with

675
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,340
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember seeing this review a while back and I remember complaining about it as well.

676
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:13,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know...

677
00:48:38,513 --> 00:48:59,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I had pretty good respect for X-Play because I love how they rip in some of the stupid games out there and they point out what's really dumb about them or what's glitchy about it and they do it in a funny way sometimes but then there's some times where they're just talking out their ass about things and I don't know, it's just you kind of

678
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:06,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Expect a certain level of criticism from them and a little bit of research involved.

679
00:49:06,585 --> 00:49:08,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you see them just kind of completely...

680
00:49:09,915 --> 00:49:35,537
[SPEAKER_02]: you know turn around and become like all those other shows out there you kind of let down and I really think if you know if they want to play you know devil's advocate here Guitar Hero wouldn't be as great as it was if Guitar Freaks had more licensed music that wasn't all kind of in-house or non-mainstream I mean it was a Japanese game and it had Japanese style music and in fact if I remember correctly I think that was one of the complaints of Beatmania was

681
00:49:35,997 --> 00:49:37,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, none of these music tracks.

682
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:40,841
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just all generic techno, and I don't recognize any of these.

683
00:49:40,921 --> 00:49:48,086
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if you follow Beatmania, these are some classic tracks from like 10 years ago and some of the beginning games.

684
00:49:48,747 --> 00:49:51,449
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to get to some chatroom comments real quick before we get back to the mailbag.

685
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,452
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to say 23rd Magus in our chatroom says, Guitar Hero did a hell of a lot.

686
00:49:55,532 --> 00:49:57,433
[SPEAKER_12]: It made music games more accessible.

687
00:49:57,813 --> 00:49:58,574
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of the point there.

688
00:49:58,594 --> 00:49:59,515
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good way of putting it.

689
00:49:59,675 --> 00:50:02,397
[SPEAKER_12]: It made music games more accessible to a wider audience.

690
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:02,997
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that point.

691
00:50:03,338 --> 00:50:05,099
[SPEAKER_12]: And then GS191 also makes a good point.

692
00:50:05,399 --> 00:50:06,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, don't blame the hosts.

693
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,361
[SPEAKER_12]: None of us are, for the record, but everybody out there should keep in mind this.

694
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:11,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, don't blame the hosts.

695
00:50:11,781 --> 00:50:13,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Blame the fucking writers and editors.

696
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,823
[SPEAKER_12]: They are the people that are putting that show down the tubes.

697
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:20,965
[SPEAKER_12]: So whatever intern at X-Play wrote that review, a spanking for you, my friend.

698
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:22,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even a good one.

699
00:50:22,345 --> 00:50:23,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, still, don't blame the hosts.

700
00:50:23,826 --> 00:50:24,426
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

701
00:50:24,526 --> 00:50:34,590
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would take it that these people, hosts of a gaming show, should have some common knowledge to a game series that is, I don't know, over 10 years old now.

702
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:44,095
[SPEAKER_12]: To the credit though, the two that they have hosting that show have more knowledge than a lot of folks on that network, so I can't complain.

703
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:56,742
[SPEAKER_02]: They've talked about DDR in the past, and they've talked about when Guitar Freaks, when Guitar Hero came out, so I know they're aware of Guitar Hero, or Guitar Freaks, so what, is this the brain fart?

704
00:50:56,822 --> 00:50:57,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

705
00:50:58,102 --> 00:51:00,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got one last email, and this is from Blaze.

706
00:51:02,006 --> 00:51:09,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, as always this show is going amazingly well and I can't wait for each week's episode.

707
00:51:09,773 --> 00:51:12,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to offer an opinion on a couple of different things.

708
00:51:12,876 --> 00:51:12,235
1.

709
00:51:13,396 --> 00:51:18,801
[SPEAKER_07]: In regards to a question about retailers not having the quote unpopular like Phoenix Wright, Katamari Damacy,

710
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:20,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Games, I would like to say this.

711
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Retailers need to understand that these games exist because people do play them.

712
00:51:24,922 --> 00:51:29,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, stores should come up with a better way of figuring out what to stock and what not to stock.

713
00:51:30,085 --> 00:51:35,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if a store only keeps two or three copies of a game at a given time, it is better than running out and not doing anything about it.

714
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:42,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I called three GameStop CBs in the past week, and none of them had Phoenix Wright, not a big surprise, or Katamari Damacy, a rather odd surprise.

715
00:51:42,793 --> 00:51:48,276
[SPEAKER_07]: When I spoke to the people at these stores, they did nothing in order to try and be more helpful other than, no, we don't have the game.

716
00:51:49,048 --> 00:51:52,670
[SPEAKER_07]: In their defense, it is based on how much they sell.

717
00:51:52,770 --> 00:52:05,938
[SPEAKER_07]: If they sell one copy of Katamari during pre-orders, and they sell 40 of Madden, their big seller is going to be Madden.

718
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:11,862
[SPEAKER_07]: It is going to make more sense for them to stock more of this, better to cater to the larger numbers than to...

719
00:52:13,528 --> 00:52:36,458
[SPEAKER_12]: but on the other side of this and the part that kind of makes me go huh is that you know like let's say Tower Records if they didn't have a CD I wanted they would offer to order it for me so why aren't these stores that he's calling offering to at least order the game for him that would be what I would do I know that they don't actually have that capability so that's why they wouldn't offer it however I think that if you will if you want to see more retailers do that write their customer service line

720
00:52:37,924 --> 00:52:41,907
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just speaking, and I'm not trying to rip on any store, because he named a couple stores here.

721
00:52:42,448 --> 00:52:46,051
[SPEAKER_12]: From a customer service angle, you don't turn the customers away.

722
00:52:46,111 --> 00:52:47,612
[SPEAKER_12]: You try to do whatever you can.

723
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:49,194
[SPEAKER_12]: I train customer service for a living.

724
00:52:49,514 --> 00:52:52,376
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to try and keep them somehow, and that's one way you can do it.

725
00:52:53,397 --> 00:52:57,338
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if that's a corporate restriction, that's the corporate, they need to, the corporate needs to look into that.

726
00:52:57,458 --> 00:53:00,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I do know, and I've seen, I've actually been in this, and it's not just my husband that does this.

727
00:53:00,999 --> 00:53:01,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

728
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:03,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I'm not just saying it because he's my husband too.

729
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:03,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

730
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,101
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, I've actually been in a couple of GameStops where they will call other stores and find out.

731
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:09,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now that's a little better.

732
00:53:09,221 --> 00:53:09,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

733
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:10,102
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a little better.

734
00:53:10,122 --> 00:53:10,342
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

735
00:53:10,362 --> 00:53:10,942
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something.

736
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:11,522
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

737
00:53:12,262 --> 00:53:21,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've, I went back, kind of on the same subject, I went back to GameStop the other day to, um, was I was looking to maybe pick up another used, uh, Xbox 360 game.

738
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:21,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

739
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:23,919
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

740
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:48,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy XII

741
00:54:07,399 --> 00:54:12,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they should actually do a network-wide inventory and be able to do store-to-store.

742
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:15,882
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually can do store-to-store transfers for items at GameStop.

743
00:54:16,682 --> 00:54:19,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's more just in case they need stock of stuff.

744
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:25,805
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that they should actually be able to have it where, hey, we can pull this copy from this store for you and have it for you on this day.

745
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:27,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a suggestion.

746
00:54:28,806 --> 00:54:31,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, hopefully somebody who has the power to change.

747
00:54:31,227 --> 00:54:32,587
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't have to be GameStop.

748
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:33,728
[SPEAKER_12]: It can be any of these stores.

749
00:54:34,768 --> 00:54:41,871
[SPEAKER_12]: If anybody's listening that might have control over corporate, I hope you have... I would love to hear from you guys that work in the corporate side of these things.

750
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:43,712
[SPEAKER_12]: What's your view on these types of policies?

751
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:48,061
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're way off base with what we think are good ideas, we'd like to know why.

752
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:50,182
[SPEAKER_12]: What are the reasons why you wouldn't do that?

753
00:54:50,502 --> 00:54:52,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I should see if I could interview my husband's boss.

754
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:53,583
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be fun.

755
00:54:55,784 --> 00:55:00,285
[SPEAKER_07]: The second item on here, pre-ordering games is something I only do if I'm going to get a bonus out of it.

756
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:03,447
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, I pre-ordered Soul Calibur 2 for the Xbox.

757
00:55:03,587 --> 00:55:10,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I had pre-ordered it two or three days after the offer had expired, but I received my very awesome lithograph that hangs in the frame in my room.

758
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:12,709
[SPEAKER_07]: and a gorgeous book with artwork from the game.

759
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,250
[SPEAKER_07]: So I say that reserving the game is only worth it if you get a nice bonus.

760
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I do disagree with that.

761
00:55:18,891 --> 00:55:28,293
[SPEAKER_07]: For some of those more rare, hard to find games that you know there's going to be a limited run of, pre-ordering guarantees you get your copy.

762
00:55:29,273 --> 00:55:35,134
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, because it's really convenient for me anyway because I can just say, hey, Dan, pick up our pre-orders.

763
00:55:36,254 --> 00:55:40,255
[SPEAKER_07]: But even so, if you live a block from a GameStop or it's on your way home from work

764
00:55:40,905 --> 00:55:44,573
[SPEAKER_07]: What's gonna hurt you to stop in, drop your five bucks off, and pick it up after work one day?

765
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:49,701
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to keep delaying this issue out, but I did think about it.

766
00:55:49,821 --> 00:55:51,522
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to leave with this note.

767
00:55:51,622 --> 00:55:54,385
[SPEAKER_12]: I really thought about what is the reason, Rob, why you don't pre-order games.

768
00:55:54,405 --> 00:55:55,145
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought about it.

769
00:55:55,205 --> 00:56:06,394
[SPEAKER_12]: This is why I don't like to pre-order games, because I feel like when I put down $5 a GameStop, the day the game comes out, then I see an ad in the paper, and, oh, Best Buy is offering a free copy of such and such, or they're offering this deal.

770
00:56:06,434 --> 00:56:11,358
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's like, well, damn, now I've already committed the $5 to buy it here, and now I can really get the special deal here.

771
00:56:11,758 --> 00:56:14,941
[SPEAKER_12]: and honestly, I think that's what stopped me from doing it in the past.

772
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:22,888
[SPEAKER_12]: I put down $5 on a game and then suddenly Best Buy or one of the other companies, I'm just using them as an example, gave a better deal and I was a little miffed by that.

773
00:56:23,188 --> 00:56:25,790
[SPEAKER_07]: As a small rebuttal, you can transfer your reserves to other games.

774
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:28,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you actually can cancel your reserve.

775
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:30,975
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess that's a good thing to know, but I don't

776
00:56:31,351 --> 00:56:32,232
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

777
00:57:01,027 --> 00:57:02,408
[SPEAKER_12]: I've actually been to that site.

778
00:57:02,808 --> 00:57:04,128
[SPEAKER_12]: It's worth your time checking out.

779
00:57:04,148 --> 00:57:06,529
[SPEAKER_12]: An honorable mention for site of the week.

780
00:57:07,169 --> 00:57:07,630
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cute.

781
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:09,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't think of any other word to describe.

782
00:57:09,771 --> 00:57:10,131
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cute.

783
00:57:10,171 --> 00:57:12,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.

784
00:57:13,272 --> 00:57:15,773
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we have some OL Army people on there.

785
00:57:16,457 --> 00:57:17,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?

786
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:18,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you what.

787
00:57:18,498 --> 00:57:27,880
[SPEAKER_07]: If anyone of you is playing Kingdom of Loathing, I will make, because again, I'm hosting stuff for our ORL Army also on roleplay.darksakura.com.

788
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I will make a Kingdom of Loathing discussion forum for you guys.

789
00:57:31,301 --> 00:57:37,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, now Roz in our chat room or Dance Cook, whatever, says that Kingdom of Loathing needs to go die in a fire.

790
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently something happened.

791
00:57:39,803 --> 00:57:40,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Some drama.

792
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,024
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

793
00:57:41,824 --> 00:57:43,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there drama on Kingdom of Loathing?

794
00:57:43,204 --> 00:57:43,524
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't know.

795
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:43,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

796
00:57:43,884 --> 00:57:45,645
[SPEAKER_07]: What game does not have drama?

797
00:57:45,865 --> 00:57:46,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

798
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:50,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Pac-Man, Brain Age, Brew!

799
00:57:51,993 --> 00:57:53,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, anyways.

800
00:57:53,533 --> 00:57:54,474
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the last of the emails.

801
00:57:54,534 --> 00:57:55,054
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the last email.

802
00:57:55,094 --> 00:57:58,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, we'd love to hear from you.

803
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,596
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, there's the voicemail, 916-226-9067.

804
00:58:02,497 --> 00:58:03,577
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a toll-free call.

805
00:58:03,877 --> 00:58:06,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Our voicemail question of the week, are games too easy?

806
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:15,500
[SPEAKER_07]: One last thing I do want to mention is that for the kind person who sent me an email directly with the compliments and support, thank you very much.

807
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,801
[SPEAKER_07]: You will be getting a reply.

808
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:19,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I just did not have an opportunity to do it when I first read your email.

809
00:58:19,694 --> 00:58:28,316
[SPEAKER_12]: and to the people who did not email me this week directly with admiration and support, you may feel free to email me this week.

810
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:29,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

811
00:58:29,257 --> 00:58:32,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I text messaged you.

812
00:58:32,437 --> 00:58:34,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want the listeners text messaging me.

813
00:58:34,138 --> 00:58:35,318
[SPEAKER_12]: I get charged for that.

814
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:36,458
[SPEAKER_12]: No, send me an email.

815
00:58:36,498 --> 00:58:37,039
[SPEAKER_12]: That's free.

816
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:38,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll text you five times.

817
00:58:38,979 --> 00:58:46,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, one more thing to add on there, thank you for anybody that nominated us for the podcast awards as well.

818
00:58:47,403 --> 00:58:49,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope it's five indies that got nominated.

819
00:58:49,904 --> 00:58:55,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope that it is indie podcasts that got in there, but we'll know in about a week or so what's going on there.

820
00:58:55,586 --> 00:59:02,009
[SPEAKER_12]: I would bet anything Gamertag Radio gets nominated, because I've gotten like five emails from those guys.

821
00:59:03,177 --> 00:59:03,798
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

822
00:59:28,823 --> 00:59:32,046
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

823
00:59:55,709 --> 01:00:05,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Goodman has an issue with the game's plot, which sees the terrorists taking over a swanky casino on the city strip and seizing a number of hostages.

824
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:18,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, Goodman reported saying the game was based on a false premise, adding he has been repeatedly told by the government officials that Las Vegas is the safest place imaginable when it comes to terrorist attacks.

825
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:24,531
[SPEAKER_02]: The mayor also said he'll look into whether or not the city can prevent the game from being released.

826
01:00:24,612 --> 01:00:33,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be harmful economically and it may be something that's not entitled to free speech protection.

827
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:33,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

828
01:00:34,542 --> 01:00:36,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderdog Harold has an excellent point here in the chatroom.

829
01:00:36,943 --> 01:00:41,364
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd think he'd object to all the murders that take place in Las Vegas on CSI.

830
01:00:41,384 --> 01:00:41,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly!

831
01:00:41,684 --> 01:00:42,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly!

832
01:01:03,905 --> 01:01:04,525
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

833
01:01:05,126 --> 01:01:07,627
[SPEAKER_12]: CSI does not make Las Vegas look like a pretty place.

834
01:01:07,888 --> 01:01:09,348
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really watch the show a whole lot.

835
01:01:09,409 --> 01:01:15,492
[SPEAKER_12]: I've caught it a couple times because I shouldn't have to feel ashamed to admit this, but I like Survivor.

836
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:20,195
[SPEAKER_12]: And CSI comes on after Survivor and, you know, sometimes I catch the first little pieces.

837
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:23,197
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't paint Vegas to be a pretty town at all.

838
01:01:24,558 --> 01:01:27,220
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'd think the mayor would... Maybe he has, I don't know.

839
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:32,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, after all, their catchphrase for Vegas is, you know, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

840
01:01:32,183 --> 01:01:32,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

841
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:36,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, moving on.

842
01:01:36,551 --> 01:01:38,193
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to point this out.

843
01:01:38,213 --> 01:01:42,297
[SPEAKER_12]: This is very random, but when was the last time we had Atari 2600 news on this show?

844
01:01:43,138 --> 01:01:44,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, we love all consoles.

845
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:45,460
[SPEAKER_12]: We mean it.

846
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:52,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Well get this, Simon Kornhorst is developing for the Atari 2600.

847
01:01:52,571 --> 01:01:54,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, folks are still developing for the Atari 2600.

848
01:01:55,353 --> 01:01:59,817
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called AVCS Tech Challenge is the name of the game.

849
01:01:59,857 --> 01:02:04,260
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a little bit of a play on the word Aztec Challenge that was a game on the Commodore 64.

850
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:14,188
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a quote from Simon Kornhorst that says as follows, I somehow remember the game Aztec Challenge from 1983 on the Commodore 64, and I always liked the first level called the Gauntlet.

851
01:02:14,548 --> 01:02:19,511
[SPEAKER_12]: And the game music, I thought a similar game for the VCS would be cool, he says on his website.

852
01:02:19,892 --> 01:02:27,717
[SPEAKER_12]: For the game's release, there will be handmade copies complete with a manual cartridge and packaging, but only for the first 55 owners.

853
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:31,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of those have already been secured by Nostalgia Gamers.

854
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,280
[SPEAKER_12]: However...

855
01:02:33,055 --> 01:02:40,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Cornhorse is willing to produce as many copies as is needed with just manuals and cartridges for those folks that may want to pick this up.

856
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,261
[SPEAKER_12]: A VCS tech challenge.

857
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:45,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, you know, they keep making these flashback consoles.

858
01:02:46,023 --> 01:02:50,486
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they should, you know, I think it would be cool to see games like this be put in the flashback consoles.

859
01:02:50,506 --> 01:02:51,366
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think they did this.

860
01:02:51,946 --> 01:02:55,589
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember a story way, way back when Atari Flashback 2 came out.

861
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:57,330
[SPEAKER_12]: They had like a contest, like a 24-hour development contest.

862
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:59,831
[SPEAKER_12]: and they put the winning game in the flashback too.

863
01:03:00,191 --> 01:03:06,836
[SPEAKER_12]: They should reach out to this guy and put this AVCS Tech Challenge in Flashback 3 if they do it.

864
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:11,899
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got to really love the 2600 to still be developing for it.

865
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:13,400
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what it looks like though?

866
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,261
[SPEAKER_12]: The game itself kind of looks like Enduro to me.

867
01:03:17,182 --> 01:03:19,984
[SPEAKER_12]: And how the hell I remember a game like Enduro, I'll never know.

868
01:03:21,204 --> 01:03:23,646
[SPEAKER_12]: But instead of driving, it looks like a little guy running.

869
01:03:25,104 --> 01:03:25,545
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of cool.

870
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:27,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

871
01:03:28,748 --> 01:03:33,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, brand new news here, talking about TV now.

872
01:03:34,082 --> 01:03:44,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Direct TV and IGN have teamed up with Microsoft and a bunch of other companies to put together a brand new pro gaming series called the Championship Gaming Series.

873
01:03:45,086 --> 01:03:50,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically a new professional gaming league that will air competitions exclusively to Direct TV.

874
01:03:50,748 --> 01:04:02,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently next weekend, Direct TV and the company will take over a 16,000 square foot airplane hangar at former Treasure Island Naval Base in San Francisco and turn it into an indoor video game arena.

875
01:04:03,345 --> 01:04:07,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Gotham Racing 3, Halo 2, DOA 4, Counter-Strike 1.6 The Weekends event will be aired in August.

876
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:30,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

877
01:04:50,117 --> 01:04:54,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because the one that we used to have, we just don't count anymore, period.

878
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:54,900
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't count it.

879
01:04:55,461 --> 01:04:58,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, we're going to go to a new section of our show.

880
01:04:58,643 --> 01:05:00,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, this is not a new section.

881
01:05:00,264 --> 01:05:02,485
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a section we do every week, but it's new for this week.

882
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:03,926
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the Skype line.

883
01:05:04,286 --> 01:05:11,791
[SPEAKER_12]: If you would like to call into our program, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us, and you can call the show.

884
01:05:12,132 --> 01:05:18,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Our phone number is 916-226-9067, or you can call us on Skype, username OrangeloungeRadio.

885
01:05:18,996 --> 01:05:19,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the phones.

886
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:21,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Legend of Zaku Legend of Zaku

887
01:05:30,974 --> 01:05:39,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, basically picking off of where you actually said about the whole X-Play fiasco and, you know, Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb just not doing their job.

888
01:05:39,376 --> 01:05:40,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now, wait a minute.

889
01:05:40,217 --> 01:05:41,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we say don't blame the hosts?

890
01:05:41,797 --> 01:05:46,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Because... I know, but I know, but still, as I said, you know, there's a lot of blame to go around.

891
01:05:46,899 --> 01:05:54,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only them two, but, you know, the people behind them that are making, you know, that are, you know, the people that are actually feeding them this stuff.

892
01:05:55,141 --> 01:05:58,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And I firmly believe that there's a bias against them.

893
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:01,819
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a bias against Konami?

894
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:07,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, basically, any type of game that doesn't fit their criteria.

895
01:06:08,104 --> 01:06:12,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, in this case, they're just kissing the ass of Guitar Hero, basically.

896
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:19,734
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I see now, from not only X-Play, but from GameSpot and other people that bastardize Beatmania.

897
01:06:20,354 --> 01:06:21,896
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the criteria?

898
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:38,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, from what I've been seeing, they usually come down hard on good games that turn out to be really, you know, they really, you know, they really talk down on, you know, on good games, on really good games.

899
01:06:38,584 --> 01:06:43,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know... Was there another game that they did a review of that made you upset?

900
01:06:45,329 --> 01:06:46,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to remember right now.

901
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:53,333
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a while since I watched X-Play, but usually... Okay, that's alright.

902
01:06:53,353 --> 01:06:54,153
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't think of an example.

903
01:06:54,173 --> 01:06:59,176
[SPEAKER_12]: But to play Devil's Advocate for a bit, you're never going to agree with game reviews 100% of the time.

904
01:06:59,196 --> 01:07:01,077
[SPEAKER_12]: They're kind of meant to ruffle your feathers a little bit.

905
01:07:01,837 --> 01:07:04,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and that's the truth, and I understand that.

906
01:07:05,299 --> 01:07:10,141
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, the only thing, what I don't get is how, you know, they're saying...

907
01:07:10,856 --> 01:07:24,605
[SPEAKER_08]: They're taking one thing like Guitar Hero and making it hold more weight than something like Beatmania which has been around there for almost 10 times as long as Guitar Hero.

908
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:25,305
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make sense.

909
01:07:25,465 --> 01:07:26,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody didn't do their homework.

910
01:07:26,726 --> 01:07:28,087
[SPEAKER_12]: It's as simple as that.

911
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:29,248
[SPEAKER_08]: That too.

912
01:07:29,448 --> 01:07:35,452
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that from what I heard in the Beatmania review and expo, they only played the 5 key.

913
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:49,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Zaku, honestly, I think they just gave it to some intern who did the review in a day, if even that.

914
01:07:49,534 --> 01:07:53,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's what happened, but, you know, two things happened.

915
01:07:53,294 --> 01:07:59,616
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good news for X-Play, because now we've spent how much time during this program essentially giving them free advertising, and two...

916
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:07,285
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to make themselves look bad in that community for not having done that, but that's just part of life.

917
01:08:07,545 --> 01:08:07,926
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

918
01:08:07,986 --> 01:08:13,170
[SPEAKER_12]: We get criticized because we make mistakes sometimes, but we just have to realize shit happens.

919
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,471
[SPEAKER_02]: We make lots of mistakes.

920
01:08:14,951 --> 01:08:16,032
[SPEAKER_12]: So what?

921
01:08:16,112 --> 01:08:18,634
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't claim to be all-knowing.

922
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:28,241
[SPEAKER_12]: It pisses me off when I read things on the internet that bash on us for this type of stuff, and it's like we're supposed to be these all... We don't get paid for this.

923
01:08:28,782 --> 01:08:31,484
[SPEAKER_12]: If I was getting paid to do eight hours of research a day on video games...

924
01:08:31,924 --> 01:08:37,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything that comes out of my mouth, Loki's mouth, DarkSakura's mouth, is love of games and hobbyists.

925
01:08:37,545 --> 01:08:38,585
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hobbyists and things we do.

926
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:43,186
[SPEAKER_08]: And these two guys go through playing the games before saying something about them.

927
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:48,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas Adam and Morgan just read off the teleprompter.

928
01:08:48,468 --> 01:08:51,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to be honest, though, it would take forever for one person to play all the games.

929
01:08:51,948 --> 01:08:54,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, trying to play everything that comes out.

930
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:59,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when we first started doing the podcast full-time and everything.

931
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:02,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just trying to play everything and you can't.

932
01:09:03,471 --> 01:09:04,111
[SPEAKER_02]: You really can't.

933
01:09:12,095 --> 01:09:19,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Adam was doing shows on ZDTV, the GameSpot TV, where I think the hosts were responsible for a lot more of the work.

934
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:22,021
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can't discredit them as gamers.

935
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:24,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Morgan was part of Screensavers a long time ago.

936
01:09:25,023 --> 01:09:35,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I would really take them a lot more seriously if they actually did more work as in actually giving an honest opinion rather than just reading it off.

937
01:09:35,849 --> 01:09:37,030
[SPEAKER_12]: That can't really happen.

938
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,302
[SPEAKER_12]: That might be the producer or the network's problem, though.

939
01:09:41,322 --> 01:09:42,423
[SPEAKER_12]: But, Zaku, we've got to let you go.

940
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,263
[SPEAKER_12]: We're running long.

941
01:09:43,283 --> 01:09:44,104
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to get another call.

942
01:09:44,124 --> 01:09:50,088
[SPEAKER_12]: But thank you so much for the perspective and making us talk about it a little bit.

943
01:09:50,108 --> 01:09:50,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to another call.

944
01:09:50,989 --> 01:09:52,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

945
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:52,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

946
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:54,971
[SPEAKER_12]: This is 23rd Magus.

947
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:55,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, 23rd Magus.

948
01:09:56,012 --> 01:09:58,694
[SPEAKER_12]: Back away from your speakers a little bit and tell us what's on your mind.

949
01:09:59,355 --> 01:10:02,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I just thought I'd pitch in with a little WoW update.

950
01:10:03,317 --> 01:10:03,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, what's up?

951
01:10:04,218 --> 01:10:05,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the resident WoW addict anyway.

952
01:10:07,045 --> 01:10:08,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, what's up on WoW?

953
01:10:09,026 --> 01:10:18,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, IGN has released a new story unveiling the new additions to World PvP in the 1.12 patch that should be coming out, I'd say probably within a month.

954
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:28,994
[SPEAKER_09]: The Eastern Plaguelands will feature resource points that must be captured, and Silithus will have piles of magical dust called Silithist that must be collected.

955
01:10:29,614 --> 01:10:35,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Alliance and Horde players will fight over these resources, which, when turned in, will provide a zone-wide buff to your faction.

956
01:10:37,548 --> 01:10:45,932
[SPEAKER_09]: The 1.2 patch with the World PvP objectives, the Cross-Circle Battlegrounds, and the Rogue Talent Review should be live on the test rooms by Monday.

957
01:10:46,252 --> 01:10:53,676
[SPEAKER_12]: I did notice on WorldofWarcraft.com they posted the list of which... Magus, I have to let you go because we're getting really bad feedback.

958
01:10:53,896 --> 01:10:56,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me respond to that just a little bit, what he was saying.

959
01:10:56,857 --> 01:10:58,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the World of Warcraft update, that was cool.

960
01:10:59,098 --> 01:11:04,501
[SPEAKER_12]: But I did want to say really quickly that on WorldofWarcraft.com I did notice that they had the list...

961
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:08,803
[SPEAKER_12]: of which realms are in which group for the cross-battle realms.

962
01:11:08,863 --> 01:11:15,405
[SPEAKER_12]: And, of course, I looked where Airy Peak is at, which is where we've been playing, and it looks like I'll be able to play my old friends on Doomhammer because we're in the same group.

963
01:11:15,745 --> 01:11:16,526
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of cool.

964
01:11:16,586 --> 01:11:17,706
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll see what happens with that.

965
01:11:18,026 --> 01:11:20,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the phones one more time.

966
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:21,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

967
01:11:21,548 --> 01:11:21,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

968
01:11:22,668 --> 01:11:23,228
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Ranma.

969
01:11:23,268 --> 01:11:24,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Who am I supposed to be?

970
01:11:24,309 --> 01:11:24,569
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

971
01:11:24,589 --> 01:11:25,369
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind, Ranma?

972
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:30,211
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to talk about a point that you made about customer service in gaming stores.

973
01:11:30,731 --> 01:11:32,852
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand exactly where you're coming from with that.

974
01:11:33,393 --> 01:11:33,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

975
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:34,173
[SPEAKER_12]: How so?

976
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:41,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I work at Staples, and if an item is not in stock, we have to go in the systems and track it down.

977
01:11:41,933 --> 01:11:47,075
[SPEAKER_10]: If we can't get from one machine, we have to go to the AS400 and check all the stores in the area.

978
01:11:47,475 --> 01:11:50,516
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to bend over backwards for the customers, make sure they get what they want.

979
01:11:50,796 --> 01:11:57,238
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have no problem doing that because when I do it for a customer, I expect the same thing done for me.

980
01:11:58,078 --> 01:12:04,760
[SPEAKER_12]: To be honest, that's a good company policy, but to be fair to whatever companies we were talking about earlier in the show,

981
01:12:05,242 --> 01:12:14,671
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have a representative to really give us the exact policy, so we can only talk about what your company is doing, which sounds like a good thing.

982
01:12:15,959 --> 01:12:20,940
[SPEAKER_10]: See, but the thing is, let's say that it's company policy with all these companies.

983
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:27,822
[SPEAKER_10]: When it comes down to the individual stores, it seems that management of those stores or the employees just don't, how I say, don't give a shit.

984
01:12:28,022 --> 01:12:30,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I had to deal with the same thing that Sunday.

985
01:12:31,022 --> 01:12:32,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I went looking for a couple games at Circuit City.

986
01:12:33,123 --> 01:12:36,423
[SPEAKER_10]: They expected me to go calling all the stores for the games.

987
01:12:36,623 --> 01:12:38,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I said to the two people standing there that...

988
01:12:40,246 --> 01:12:41,147
[SPEAKER_10]: This is your job.

989
01:12:41,347 --> 01:12:44,352
[SPEAKER_10]: You're supposed to go looking at the computers for the games that I want.

990
01:12:44,613 --> 01:12:46,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here being very nice about it.

991
01:12:46,556 --> 01:12:48,499
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no need for you to be rude to me.

992
01:12:48,759 --> 01:12:53,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't you know the following day I called corporate and I gave them my two cents about it.

993
01:12:53,896 --> 01:12:59,319
[SPEAKER_12]: I was told by a game store once when I called in asking if they had a certain game in stock and it wasn't anything major.

994
01:12:59,339 --> 01:13:02,441
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't talking like an Xbox 360 or Halo 2 or something.

995
01:13:02,802 --> 01:13:06,324
[SPEAKER_12]: I called in asking if a game was in stock and I was told, I'm busy right now.

996
01:13:06,384 --> 01:13:08,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Come down and look and see if we have it on the shelves.

997
01:13:08,945 --> 01:13:12,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Needless to say, I bought the game at their competitor across town.

998
01:13:13,783 --> 01:13:14,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

999
01:13:35,405 --> 01:13:43,908
[SPEAKER_12]: that work at these type of places, and it could be anything from the GameStop EB stores to Best Buy, Office Depot, Staples to mom-pop stores, whatever.

1000
01:13:44,268 --> 01:13:56,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep in mind that it might be an inconvenience sometimes, but bad customer service leads to lost business, leads to your store getting closed and you getting laid off.

1001
01:13:56,652 --> 01:13:59,853
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's one of the reasons why one of the guys at my job got fired on Tuesday.

1002
01:14:00,294 --> 01:14:00,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1003
01:14:00,874 --> 01:14:01,254
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too bad.

1004
01:14:01,897 --> 01:14:02,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1005
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:04,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma, we've got to let you go to get more calls in, but thank you so much for the perspective.

1006
01:14:04,938 --> 01:14:05,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, no problem.

1007
01:14:05,398 --> 01:14:05,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

1008
01:14:06,258 --> 01:14:06,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Much love.

1009
01:14:07,059 --> 01:14:07,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, Ukyo.

1010
01:14:07,839 --> 01:14:08,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Hugs and kisses.

1011
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:08,859
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye-bye.

1012
01:14:08,939 --> 01:14:09,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Right back at you.

1013
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:12,380
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1014
01:14:12,801 --> 01:14:13,681
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll do one more call.

1015
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:15,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody wants to call in on our Skype line.

1016
01:14:15,922 --> 01:14:18,042
[SPEAKER_12]: It's www.warrenslaunchradio.com.

1017
01:14:18,062 --> 01:14:21,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Click on Interact With Us or our phone number, 916-226-9067.

1018
01:14:22,864 --> 01:14:26,345
[SPEAKER_12]: In the meantime, does anybody have any last-minute stories they wanted to get off their chest here in studio?

1019
01:14:28,325 --> 01:14:29,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, is that a big no?

1020
01:14:29,266 --> 01:14:29,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes.

1021
01:14:30,516 --> 01:14:32,297
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura had a mic to her mouth first.

1022
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:33,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, uh-uh.

1023
01:14:33,698 --> 01:14:34,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay, then Loki.

1024
01:14:35,859 --> 01:14:37,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, nope, cut off by the Skype call.

1025
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:38,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.

1026
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1027
01:14:40,161 --> 01:14:40,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1028
01:14:41,281 --> 01:14:42,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is PK or Kira88.

1029
01:14:43,702 --> 01:14:44,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, what was that?

1030
01:14:45,983 --> 01:14:46,784
[SPEAKER_04]: This is PK or Kira88.

1031
01:14:46,864 --> 01:14:48,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, PK or Kira88.

1032
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:49,245
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

1033
01:14:50,286 --> 01:14:52,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, actually, yeah, I just got back on vacation from the Philippines.

1034
01:14:53,887 --> 01:14:57,569
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing is, I spent a lot of time in the arcades over there.

1035
01:14:58,209 --> 01:14:59,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing I noticed...

1036
01:15:00,714 --> 01:15:04,416
[SPEAKER_04]: The social environment over there is much more lively than it is over here.

1037
01:15:05,877 --> 01:15:06,438
[SPEAKER_12]: How so?

1038
01:15:07,798 --> 01:15:11,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like, okay, it's not just the, say, hardcore gamers that are always there.

1039
01:15:11,881 --> 01:15:12,661
[SPEAKER_04]: They're there all the time.

1040
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:22,828
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be, like, families and, you know, usually people that you wouldn't consider gamers that are hanging around, like, playing the games or just having fun.

1041
01:15:23,028 --> 01:15:28,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you think families are more apt to play games together in the Philippines than they are here?

1042
01:15:28,999 --> 01:15:36,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what, honestly, I think it's because of the social, economic conditions, because most of these families can't really afford, say, like, a console, a home console.

1043
01:15:36,901 --> 01:15:43,382
[SPEAKER_04]: But, also at the same time, these arcades are making a lot more money than the arcades that we have over here.

1044
01:15:43,802 --> 01:15:45,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet their games are, like, dirt cheap.

1045
01:15:45,503 --> 01:15:51,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, I was playing Public Up Zero for, like, 25 cents a game.

1046
01:15:52,064 --> 01:15:52,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

1047
01:15:53,353 --> 01:15:54,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, very interesting perspective.

1048
01:15:54,554 --> 01:15:59,037
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to let you go, buddy, because you're a little quiet, but thanks so much for calling in to us tonight.

1049
01:15:59,077 --> 01:15:59,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

1050
01:16:00,118 --> 01:16:08,844
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this reminds me of back when my parents used to take me down to Chuck E. Cheese back before it was all neon lights and ball bins, and it was actually just pizza and arcade.

1051
01:16:10,965 --> 01:16:15,028
[SPEAKER_02]: They would totally take me down there, and we'd play games and stuff together as a family.

1052
01:16:15,248 --> 01:16:17,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody would go and play different video games.

1053
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:18,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Not my mom.

1054
01:16:18,931 --> 01:16:20,752
[SPEAKER_12]: She'd hand me a roll of quarters and go sit in the corner.

1055
01:16:20,772 --> 01:16:21,533
[SPEAKER_12]: She'd be like, have fun, kid.

1056
01:16:22,788 --> 01:16:24,489
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom would sometimes play Pac-Man with me.

1057
01:16:24,609 --> 01:16:26,750
[SPEAKER_12]: My mom hates video games.

1058
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:38,415
[SPEAKER_12]: But she always kind of, like, every time something interesting happens with our show, like, you know, last year when we won the podcast award, or we were on, you know, you guys were on the news, and I think we were all on it at one point, too, or in the paper, remember that?

1059
01:16:38,695 --> 01:16:40,136
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, those little things that happen?

1060
01:16:40,416 --> 01:16:42,077
[SPEAKER_12]: My mom always kind of goes, huh.

1061
01:16:42,957 --> 01:16:46,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, kind of one of those, wow, I always told them that would never amount to anything.

1062
01:16:47,139 --> 01:16:48,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Boy, was I wrong, but that makes me feel good.

1063
01:16:49,831 --> 01:16:52,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I still don't think it's amounted to much yet until we get an extra paycheck.

1064
01:16:52,974 --> 01:16:53,554
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Apollo.

1065
01:16:53,574 --> 01:16:59,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I just wanted to really talk about the arcades because I just came back from Japan a few weeks ago.

1066
01:17:16,897 --> 01:17:19,978
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to talk about the arcades over there compared to the arcades here.

1067
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:22,340
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the comparison you made?

1068
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,360
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, repeat that?

1069
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:25,661
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the comparison you made?

1070
01:17:27,062 --> 01:17:35,706
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to talk about the arcades in Japan and America because the arcades in Japan are a whole lot busier and there's a lot more focus on different styles of gaming.

1071
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:40,468
[SPEAKER_00]: And the UFO catchers, like the crane games are a lot bigger over there too.

1072
01:17:40,728 --> 01:17:45,090
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just crazy how much more stuff they have there compared to what we have here.

1073
01:17:46,318 --> 01:17:47,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you think it's different?

1074
01:17:50,022 --> 01:17:54,646
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the population density in Japan is so much bigger.

1075
01:17:56,188 --> 01:18:01,473
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that kind of makes it more possible for lots of people to go to one place.

1076
01:18:03,976 --> 01:18:05,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, very interesting perspective.

1077
01:18:05,357 --> 01:18:06,318
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate the phone call.

1078
01:18:06,358 --> 01:18:07,059
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one, okay?

1079
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:08,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Alrighty, thank you.

1080
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:09,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Later, bye-bye.

1081
01:18:09,437 --> 01:18:11,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was actually a very good point.

1082
01:18:11,518 --> 01:18:17,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Just with, you know, it's actually pretty commonplace for someone to get off work and then go to a game center.

1083
01:18:18,241 --> 01:18:23,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Or for, you know, children after school to go to the game center or spend their Sundays there since school's on Saturday, too.

1084
01:18:23,723 --> 01:18:32,127
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, I think that that's actually, because it's so integrated into everything and it has been for so long, I think that that is a good reason why it's, you know, surviving.

1085
01:18:32,527 --> 01:18:37,929
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new game center going up by us, by a local theater that we have up in Eldry Hills.

1086
01:18:38,616 --> 01:18:41,477
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new gaming center going on down there.

1087
01:18:41,497 --> 01:18:45,399
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost looks like it could be a console gaming center, which I'm kind of interested to check out.

1088
01:18:45,699 --> 01:18:49,161
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have it built yet, but it's going in.

1089
01:18:49,201 --> 01:18:50,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Any of the last minute stories?

1090
01:18:50,782 --> 01:18:52,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to mention one thing real quick.

1091
01:18:53,763 --> 01:18:59,186
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a report about the Xbox 360 branded ecstasy popping up in the UK.

1092
01:18:59,686 --> 01:19:00,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was kind of funny.

1093
01:19:01,527 --> 01:19:04,088
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new type of ecstasy that they're calling Xbox 360 pills.

1094
01:19:07,786 --> 01:19:08,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Jump in.

1095
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:11,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1096
01:19:13,073 --> 01:19:17,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I guess that's about going to wrap it up then for this week's edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

1097
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:20,584
[SPEAKER_12]: We really appreciate you guys tuning in to us and supporting independent radio.

1098
01:19:20,604 --> 01:19:21,325
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys rock.

1099
01:19:21,769 --> 01:19:23,691
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1100
01:19:24,391 --> 01:19:25,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, your final thought.

1101
01:19:25,772 --> 01:19:29,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to play more Chromehounds this week because I've only been playing the training missions.

1102
01:19:29,675 --> 01:19:34,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get a lot more parts to actually make a mech so I can go play online.

1103
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been really trying to play more online games.

1104
01:19:39,183 --> 01:19:46,109
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought is big thanks to Miklatov for being a special guest on the show tonight, even though we might get some angry emails from what he said in the first half, but that's all right.

1105
01:19:46,881 --> 01:19:47,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Freedom of Speech, right?

1106
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:55,325
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to say I have to catch him up in level on WoW because he's an addict.

1107
01:19:56,045 --> 01:19:56,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to mention.

1108
01:19:56,846 --> 01:19:58,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with Annie.

1109
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:01,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you're supposed to mention, actually, according to the chat room.

1110
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:05,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone posted a link to some OLR card game that they're working on.

1111
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Poozeater.

1112
01:20:09,032 --> 01:20:10,432
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are crazy, but I love you.

1113
01:20:11,052 --> 01:20:12,153
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1114
01:20:12,608 --> 01:20:13,649
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is two parts.

1115
01:20:13,669 --> 01:20:15,570
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one is always reject false icons.

1116
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Second is define yourself.

1117
01:20:17,091 --> 01:20:17,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't let the world define you.

1118
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:22,754
[SPEAKER_12]: You're such the mommy sometimes, but I like it.

1119
01:20:24,114 --> 01:20:27,676
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to do with... You leave good moral messages for the youth of America.

1120
01:20:27,696 --> 01:20:31,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had stuff going on, so that's very important right now.

1121
01:20:31,258 --> 01:20:31,659
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand.

1122
01:20:32,459 --> 01:20:32,739
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1123
01:20:32,999 --> 01:20:33,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's it, guys.

1124
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:34,740
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see you next week.

1125
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:37,962
[SPEAKER_12]: We are back on Sunday night, 6 o'clock, and we'll see you next time.

1126
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:40,964
[SPEAKER_12]: And you podcast folks, stay tuned to our podcast feed.

1127
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:42,652
[SPEAKER_12]: and have a great week.

1128
