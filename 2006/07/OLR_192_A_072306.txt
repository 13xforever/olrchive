Tonight, July 23rd, 2006, details on PSP updates from Comic-Con, World of Warcraft undergoes controversial changes in its expansion, and brace yourselves for Animal Crossing the Movie.
Yes, they're controversial, Andrew.
Mobile
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Loki is also here, our tech master Loki That was a horrible joke I know How you doing?
I'm doing okay And also our very special guest, or spatial guest taking up space Say hello to Andrew Loktar, bitches How you doing?
For the Horde We're here to talk about video game news that doesn't suck Sometimes we talk about sucky news This is actually a little bit of a slow news week So we might have some news of suck tonight I don't know, we'll see
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Just the same ones you own?
Just the same ones I own.
I played a lot of Last Action Hero today, except it's really hot in the garage and I wanted to die.
So I went back in and tried not to become a corpse since I had to do the show today.
Gotcha.
And I played with Legos last night.
But you baked cookies.
I baked cookies.
Amongst your boredom, so that's great.
I did, and my cookies are made of awesome and win.
And chocolate.
You could almost make a sequel to the Milkshake song out of that.
My cookies are made of awesome and win, man.
I haven't played any Blades of the Angels this week, jackass.
Wow!
Wow!
Did you finally get rid of it?
No, not yet.
I still have to finish it, even though it sucks.
So, I played more Grand Theft Auto, because that's awesome, and actually I'm going to be cleaning out some of my games here pretty soon, so I do need to finish Blades of the Angels, because that's got to go back.
Also, I'm selling back Katamari, me and my Katamari.
Just
I'm bored of that game.
But it's so cute and fun!
It's so cute, but who cares?
You know, I don't care.
But anyways, other than that, what else did I play?
I think I played a little bit more Ridge Racer and... Oh, I watched Nelly play Cloning Clyde.
Because I play more Frogger, too.
Unlock that TV.
What's cloning client all about?
Because I didn't have time to really download it and check it out.
You've been watching her play and you have no idea what's going on.
Yeah, but I've been watching her play it from the couch while I'm watching TV.
So it looks like it's basically solving puzzles.
You have to kill all these robots in the level before you're allowed to exit.
And they have 20 different levels or so.
And you basically can clone yourself as well as be able to transform into different things.
Plus it has exploding chickens that you get to kick.
So, um, that's really fun.
Well, I always wanted to play a game where I can kick chickens, that's great.
Exactly, but, um, you know, it's nice to see that they're actually putting out some new, um, live arcade games.
And, I don't know, um, I was trying to get a hold of the Saints Row demo, but I haven't made it over to, like, a GameStop or something to pre-order the game yet.
But apparently it did pop up on the German server for a little bit, and some people were able to nab it before it
One of my instant message buddies said he got a copy of the September magazine, original Xbox, whatever it's called, magazine, and it's in there.
I didn't know it was out yet, but I'll pick that one up instead then.
There you go.
Orange Lounge Radio, helping you find what you need.
Exactly.
Anything else?
That's about it, I think.
GameTap Service Rehab
GameTap Upgraded
And some of the games they picked are really random.
You can kind of tell that they're sort of testing this right now because a lot of the games are not two-player simultaneous games.
They're games like Pac-Man, which is one of the most popular multiplayer games on there right now, is Pac-Man.
You know, and the way multiplayer Pac-Man works is like I play, then you play, then I play.
You know, it kind of trades off.
But they do have some same-time multiplayer games on there right now, like Joust.
And so that's pretty exciting because that means that, you know, this is probably the first step in the direction of Street Fighter 2, other popular two-player arcade games, you know, in the future.
My only complaint about the whole thing is that it was a really weird setup.
Like, it took a minute for me to figure out, okay, what's the difference between being an orange name and clicking on instant match and being, you know...
GameTap has that technology and is likely to move forward.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
GameTap needed something like that to justify why you should pay for it
Thanks for watching!
I hope that's not a bad sign.
I hope their business is doing well, but I think things like this will help.
And I think if they ever are able to get it working on Macs, that's going to be a huge help, too.
It'll be a huge, huge help.
So, anyway, that was pretty much my gaming week.
And I do, you know, I've talked a lot of positive things about it, but I really do recommend it, and I enjoy it.
What, Loki?
Yeah, like, because if they got that working on Macs, that would, you know, multiply the amount of games that Mac can play by, like, 100.
It would.
It actually would.
It'd be pretty cool.
No, seriously though, you know, you give Macs a hard time, but okay, obviously one of the things that people always say is you can't really play as many games on a Mac, so having GameTap would be a pretty cool little upgrade, so it really would.
Alright, Andrew, how was your gaming week?
Not bad.
I was getting in some World of Warcraft on the test servers, testing out the new Rogue Talent Review.
Pretty impressed by that.
Um...
Also took the time to finish up Tales of Legendia, an English program.
Still pissed off that they never took the time to do voice acting for the second half of the game.
Good game there, Namco.
Also starting to get into Wild Arms 3, which is a pretty decent RPG.
Recommended.
That's about all that I've done this week.
We have some folks in our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat talking about the whole GameTap thing, talking about it there Some love there for Joust, two player simultaneous there from VXJasonXV Yuri Lover wants to know when GameTap's going to get multiplayer Ridge Racer Something tells me that, well they do have other Kill it with fire They do have, I know that joke is kind of like really old now
They do have other Namco games on there, but I don't know if that would really work.
PlayStation's not one of the systems they emulate right now.
They have Dreamcasts.
I don't know.
If you're emulating Dreamcasts, why not emulate Soul Calibur?
My God, would that not be... There we go.
My God, do you know how many freaking GameTap subscriptions that would sell right there?
But I don't know.
Maybe it's just too much of a pain in the ass.
Who knows?
Like I said, I'm hoping it's the start of something good.
And then they're talking a little bit about...
versus GameTap.
VidPower says, so GameTap is like Xbox Live Arcade now, but then RSF says GameTap and Xbox Live Arcade are different business models, which is true.
GameTap doesn't have achievements either, and it doesn't have voice chat, but at the same time, you pay one flat fee for access to 500 some odd games, whereas...
Xbox Live Arcade, you're paying $5, $10 a game.
So it's just a different business model.
It depends whatever you like.
So I think that's probably the direction GameTab is going in, but that's not really a big surprise because, you know, Xbox Live is successful.
Who wouldn't want a little piece of that business?
I don't know.
All right.
Oh, Jada2006 agrees that Soul Calibur would be awesome.
So there you go.
All right.
We're going to go and get into some news now, some gaming news.
So, Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
Yes, and what a perfect way to start us off by talking about the PSP and how there's going to be yet another firmware upgrade.
And this one's going to be 2.8.
It's going to add video RSS feeds, so you can download those wonderful video podcasts out there, as well as a bunch of other fun stuff, probably security things to prevent you from running homebrew and all that wonderful stuff up.
This was also coming from Comic Con 2006, which they're kind of displaying some of the stuff right now.
Some of the other things that are actually happening, they were showing off some of their brand new Sony Kinect stuff where they're going to try to get it where you can download movies to your PSP's memory stick there.
Seeing as they won't be selling UMDs much longer, it makes sense.
Well, you know, they were saying that there's 350 UMD...
I think downloadable movies is a smart move right now.
They're going to do it.
Why not?
I don't think I will use it that much, but you never know.
I travel a lot, as you guys have been listening to this show a while now.
It might be kind of tempting to download a movie before I go on the plane next time.
One of the other things that's coming with that firmware update as well
is there going to be including a demo of World Tour Soccer 2?
I guess if you're excited about that.
That makes the grand total of demos that they've put out so far to a whopping two or three.
That's pretty pathetic.
I would think you would want to put tons of demos out there so that they buy your games.
I do think Sony's making a bit of a mistake with that, but I don't know.
You look at Xbox 360...
Marketplace, and so, so many demos.
Some good news, though.
Video ad is something that they're working on right now.
One thing they aren't working on, though, is improving the text entry system on there and no plans for a first-party keyboard.
So, yeah, that sucks.
So all this was announced at Comic-Con, right?
Yeah.
So what was Sony doing there?
Well, Comic-Con's become almost like... It's become like Nerd-Con, hasn't it?
Exactly.
It's less of comics and more of, here's what's coming out movies, here's what's coming out comics, here's what's coming out toys, games.
But in a way, doesn't comics kind of tie into all that?
Like, comics ties into movies.
A lot of the big, grossing movies lately have been comic book-based, like Batman Begins was an awesome movie.
Yeah.
And then, you know, same thing with games.
A lot of games based off comic book franchises as well, usually because of the movies, but, you know.
Well, exactly, but it's just, it's become a huge nerd fest, so.
I don't know, that's kind of neat.
Yeah, it's funny, because I was telling my friend the other day, I want to go to Comic Con.
He's like, why?
You don't read comic books.
I'm like, well, but there's cool stuff.
Exactly.
So, yeah, that's something to look forward to.
However, though, just, you know, for people that aren't in the know,
DevHook
Which is out right now.
They're on version 0.45.
And now that you can actually fully emulate the 2.71 firmware and basically run it with all the functionality of 2.71 as well as homebrew stuff.
And they're also using this to load on custom firmwares as well.
And that on top of the mod chip that's coming out for it.
I mean, how much longer are these firmware updates really going to be a problem?
That's something interesting.
All right.
I'll be interested in the new upgrades, especially for the movie thing.
I might have to buy one movie online just to see what it's like, just to review it for you guys here on Orange Launch Radio.
We'll see.
Well, if I remember correctly, if I read correctly on this, at least this is the case with those, how we talked about last week, how they're including a one gigabyte memory stick and you have four movies that you can download to that.
Apparently the movies aren't full screen, which is really lame.
They're that 320 by whatever on the PSP.
Normal TV ratio.
Yeah, exactly.
That is a little bit of a bummer.
It's really lame.
Not cool.
We'll see.
Well, anyway, speaking of movies, of course, last week on the show we talked about how Target had gotten rid of UMDs from their shelves.
We're in the process of phasing that out.
Well, recently, United Press International spoke to the Senior VP of Marketing at Sony Computer Entertainment.
His name is Peter Dial, and this is what he said, basically, about all this negative press.
It basically comes down to too many releases.
Here's a quote.
We have seen studios cut back on releasing their full content on UMD, as unlike the DVD market, the PSP consumer is targeted.
We are committed to helping the studios better understand our product and our consumer, and will continue to educate them as we evolve and enhance the functionality of the PSP.
So basically it just kind of sounds like they're not saying they're done yet, but I don't know.
Well, I also think it comes down to a space issue too because those UMDs can't hold a whole lot and to fit more content on top of that, it's tough.
It's just you can't really fit it.
That and also they're not making a lot of money on UMDs, so why bother putting exclusive content on there in the first place?
Why even bother?
It's interesting though that the guy referenced the whole fact that the PSP is a targeted market because we were kind of saying that when the PSP first came out and you saw the list of the launch movies that
that were coming out for the PSP.
It was kind of like, wow, you have a lot of very teenage boy movies coming on PSP, but that, I guess, is the target market.
You're not exactly going to sell a bunch of UMDs of Steel Magnolias on PSP.
Oh, I would totally buy that movie.
Me too, but we'd be the only two.
Actually, I wouldn't buy that movie.
Okay, then I'd be the only one.
You'd be the only one.
Just to say I owned it.
I'm actually not really that huge on that movie, but just to say I own it.
I was excited about it.
Death Race 2000
Death Race 3000
Snakes on a Plane
For UMD, I guess.
Campaigning to get that released on UMD.
So you could actually watch it in a plane.
Because you know they're not going to show that as the in-flight movie.
That would be funny, though.
That would be actually pretty funny.
I would fly on an airline that showed that as the in-flight movie.
What about movies like Red Eye?
I bet Southwest would do something like that.
because they're just sort of... Southwest is too poor to show movies.
I know, but if they did show a movie... Fly the ghetto skies.
But no, if they did show a movie, I bet that'd be one that they would put up right away because they have some snarky people doing their little... Okay, if the plane starts to go down, this probably won't matter because I'll be dead anyway.
I said that on one of my flights.
I can't remember who is putting out snakes on a plane, but...
Can you imagine with the motion picture?
You know how they always create a stupid themed ride based on it?
We're going to have the snakes on a plain roller coaster at some point.
It's awful.
Moving on back to games.
Ah, who needs them?
Well, actually, we do.
Yeah, I'd miss my games too much.
I love games very much.
But at any rate, speaking of a game that I've been stuck on for a little bit,
World of Warcraft.
Well, you know how you've got Shamans for Horde and Paladins on Alliance?
Well, now they're going to be... And nothing will ever change to upset that balance of the force, right?
Bullshit!
No.
They actually are now having Alliance Shamans and Horde Paladins.
The new races are going to be pulling them in with the whole...
Upgrade for Burning Crusade.
There's going to be Blood Off Paladins.
There's going to be... I know I'm going to mispronounce... Draenei.
Draeno.
Draeno.
Draeno.
Their faces look like something you'd want to use Draeno on, actually.
They use the power of unclogging.
You know why those particular races were picked, right?
And I know Andrew's going to have to comment on this.
He's the biggest wow-horn in the room.
Let me just get this out.
Okay.
You...
You had to have blood elves on the Horde side because the Horde needed a pretty character.
Because everybody on the Horde side is ugly.
Some of the zombies are pretty.
You needed the Drani people on the Alliance side because the Alliance needed uglies.
The Alliance already has uglies.
I understand, but you know, it's just...
You know what the fish-faced Dranae remind me of?
That Kikoman music video thing where they've got the fish-faced creature.
That's what it reminds me of.
Sorry, did you have more story?
I'm sorry.
Yes, but if you want to know some of the word behind that, there's actually a post on the World of Warcraft forums where they're giving the background to the decision for doing all that.
And apparently there's a forum shitstorm about it.
Just talking about how A, it butchers balance.
A, it makes things more balanced.
They are actually giving certain abilities for each class, though, that are class-specific.
And B, they say it's butchering lore, and it's kind of funny how...
Most of the people on the forums wouldn't give a damn about lore anyway if we beat them upside the head.
Would you call yourself earlier to be a lore whore?
I'm a lore whore.
Okay, so as the WoW whore, lore whore, the only one in this room with a level 60, what do you personally feel about this whole change?
I think we're going to have to wait and see, story-wise, how Metzen decides to write his way into and out of this one, see if it makes sense.
Balance-wise, though, I think it's a good change.
Horde has been complaining how Shamans have been really underpowered for PvE content, raid content, how all they get to do is heal and lay down totems and don't get any kind of buffs like, say, Blessings like Paladins do.
And Alliance has been whining that, oh, we don't have the PvP strength because we don't have Shamans.
Guess what?
Now you're going to have Shamans and now you're going to have Paladins.
Best of both worlds.
And you know, the thing is, when that expansion first hits, the servers are going to be inundated with Blood Elf Paladins and Trani, Trani, whatever.
That should be the Quit Your Bitching update.
Blizzard does a lot of those.
I really have two minds about that, though, but I'm hoping it'll be a good thing.
I mean, I'll probably play a Blood Elf Paladin, you know, just to do, say I've done it.
It's making me seriously reconsider making a Blood Elf Priest and changing him to a Paladin.
Hmm.
I think everybody is thinking in the back of their mind, depending on whether they play more Horde or more Alliance, which kind of character.
I think most of us are Horde players, you know, kind of thinking in the back of our mind what we're going to make our Blood Elf.
Like, everybody is going to make one of these new ones.
It's just interesting to me.
I've already got it set from the start, but I don't want to be a squishy healer.
Not on a PvP server.
That's what I found out.
Being a priest on a PvP server is like asking for a beating.
Unless you have a Death Wish or your, for instance, Spect Shadow.
Ha ha ha.
All right.
So when's Burning Crusade coming out?
Pretty soon, right?
Estimated release date of October, but they'll probably be closer to December.
Awesome.
Well, Final Fantasy XI, we can't have a WoW story without talking about the other MMO that a lot of us have played on and off.
Ah, who gives a crap?
I know.
I'm a little done with Final Fantasy XI, but this was exciting news.
They announced earlier this week that there was a sequel being made to Final Fantasy XI.
And that news came out about six or seven days ago.
And then a few days later, no, unfortunately, it looks like Squeenix put out a little...
As the company announced in May 2005, it is currently developing an online title for next-gen platforms, including game consoles and PCs.
However, this title is being developed as a completely new MMORPG.
We will disclose further details of this title, including which platforms it's going to be on, immediately after any relevant decisions are made.
But they didn't exactly say, we're not doing Final Fantasy XI, too.
They're just saying, we're not going to tell you either way.
Final Fantasy XIII, another title!
Will it involve dress-up, just like that other direct sequel?
No, seriously, I think it's going to be... The dress-up was great!
Okay, it was all too Charlie's Angels, though.
That was what made it great.
It was like the ultimate girl Final Fantasy.
Legend of Zaku in our chatroom seems to think it's Front Mission Online that they're talking about.
That would be awesome!
Personally, I think it's going to be Fantasy Earth Online.
They had run a couple articles about it last year.
How the Enix part of Square Enix was going to do Fantasy Earth.
Raven's Dolphin in chat has an interesting perspective.
Maybe it's not Final Fantasy XI Part 2.
He says Final Fantasy XIV, the MMO.
Maybe.
God forbid.
Maybe.
They need to do one called Final Fantasy The End of Things.
They said what it was in E3 2005.
There was a whole bunch of stuff that was coming out in E3 2005 that wasn't there for 2006.
I want to say it was Fantasy.
Or it was another MMO not of Final Fantasy.
Or just...
Well, remember how everybody thought World of Mana was a game and everybody like creamed their pants because it's like, you know, oh my god, Secret of Mana Online, how awesome would that be?
And then they were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
World of Mana is like all these new Mana games where it's a marketing thing, not an actual game.
Well, it'll be cool no matter what it is.
I don't know.
One other thing I just want to mention real quick, Final Fantasy XI is not without any love or upgrades.
If you're playing the Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy XI, you may have noticed that you don't get any achievement points for all those hours upon hours that you pour into the game.
Well, it looks like Final Fantasy XI will be getting 32 achievements on Xbox.
This is thanks to Xbox.com.
They're all secret achievements right now, so we don't even know what they are.
But if it's 32 achievements, that would be about 30 to 40 points apiece.
The rumor is that with the next Final Fantasy XI patch, you will now be able to get achievements.
My question is, since I'm a dummy and I haven't canceled my account over there yet and I'm still paying for it, could I just log in with my character and since he's a certain level and done stuff already, am I going to unlock all these achievements suddenly?
Assuming that those are what the achievements are for.
Yeah, I don't know.
Who knows?
It could be... Congratulations!
You bought a new expansion!
Times 32.
It could be interesting because they could be... You're right.
They could be things relevant to Chocobo Racing or things that are going to be the new things that they put in Final Fantasy XI.
The achievements may not even have anything to do with the rest of the game.
That would be interesting.
Or it could be just stuff like winning a game of Ballista.
Possibly.
Oh, something that you can do over and over again.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Well, we shall soon see when the next patch goes out to Final Fantasy XI.
Excellent.
Anyways, another news here.
Speaking of Xbox Live, you know how they're doing this Xbox Live Wednesday thing where they're releasing brand new games coming out every Wednesday.
In fact, next week we are getting Galaga, which is awesome.
and of course after that Street Fighter 2 and after that Pac-Man.
But there are going to be about 50 live arcade games by the end of the year, which is great.
And this is coming from Major Nelson.
And basically...
Night of the Round, Golden Axe
All those games sound awesome.
Yeah, it's going to be pretty awesome.
And I know Contra and stuff are going to be coming out as well.
Contra and Super Contra.
Just all this Luminous Live, of course.
So lots of good games to look up before the end of the year.
So at least they're going to be supporting live arcade for a while.
All righty.
One other thing that's going to be coming to Xbox Live pretty soon is a table tennis demo.
Rockstar Games confirmed that a table tennis demo is on the way and this was through Major Nelson.
Major Nelson blogged, I happen to be down talking to the folks that work with Rockstar and they told me it would be okay for me to mention that there is a demo on its way to the marketplace for table tennis.
I also found out that the demo is single and two player but not live play.
Live play is kind of, you know,
If he gave them everything, I don't know if there'd be much point to buying the game, despite the fact that there are additional characters and arenas and things like that.
But this will be good.
Folks wanting to find out if they want to spend the money on the game or not, even though it is next-gen budget-priced.
Excellent.
And speaking of stuff coming in live, I think I mentioned last week Texas Hold'em announced it was going to be free.
Actually, that's not the case.
It ends up being that they haven't decided on a price point yet, but it's definitely not going to be free.
So...
Unfortunately, you know, probably, you know, decent price, but no handouts this time, unfortunately.
And that was something we reported on last week, right?
Yes, it was, that it was going to be free.
That was originally the announcement, but apparently not.
Apparently they found out, hey, you know what, we can make money off this, so let's do that.
All right, well, Microsoft is seeing some pretty good Xbox 360 sales.
Microsoft reported that the earnings for its fourth quarter, which ended June 30, 2006, because it's a fiscal year, they got $2.3 billion in profits on revenue of $11.8 billion.
Its server and tools division was the fastest growing sector, having $3.18 billion of quarterly income.
When you get to Xbox revenue,
This would be Xbox and Xbox 360.
This increased about $503 million or 129%.
Of course, that being attributed to Xbox 360.
Now, the home entertainment division, unfortunately for them, had an operating loss of $414 million for the quarter.
And they're saying that the biggest reason for this is because they lose money on each Xbox 360 sold.
Kind of some interesting profits and stuff.
from Microsoft.
If you'd like to follow that, or if you own stock in Microsoft, I bet you really want to know about that information.
Just one moment, folks.
We're getting reorganized.
There actually is another game coming out on Xbox 360.
Actually, it's more in the realm of the unconfirmed rumor, but it's been stated that Guitar Hero is coming to the Xbox 360.
Microsoft hasn't commented yet, but Red Octane is actually working on the PS2 sequel and a 360 version.
So, yeah, that's to look forward to.
I don't know, it's interesting.
What would you think?
Do you think that Guitar Hero would see a lot of its fanbase moving over to Xbox with this, or is this just a way for Guitar Hero to expand its fanbase, or what?
Both.
Online play That would be a huge selling point for Xbox version, that's for sure
Well, it's interesting because the story talks about Guitar Hero 2, but in DDR, yeah, the games are similar, but they're not really the same.
Ultramix offers completely different types of features than the Extreme and I'm assuming Supernova are going to be offering.
So it's kind of, I don't know, it's a little bit apples and oranges to me.
I think they could do, I think it would just be different on Xbox or should be different.
Definitely, and including, you know, since we're talking about Guitar Hero here, there was actually a MySpace blog post put out by the Guitar Hero team, and it was actually entitled Ghoul's Night Out, which teases a logo to possibly a brand new game with the skull and cross guitars with the title Ghoul, and Ghoul...
Looks to be an acronym for something.
It's interesting, though, is no one really knows what exactly that means.
People are, you know, suspecting maybe it's like a Guitar Hero Online User League or something like that or some sort of, you know, some sort of online play or maybe even the Xbox 360 game.
But, of course, right now, nothing more than a logo, nothing more than speculation, so at least they're working on something.
Just trying to get the fanboys talking.
It's basically, and it's working.
Look at us.
Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix
and so on.
And it looked like it had stationary backgrounds, which for a plug-and-play device wouldn't be too surprising.
You can't put a whole lot in those things.
So it's very interesting, these plug-and-play dance pads.
I've seen these before.
I saw the crappy 8-bit Nintendo-style dance pads at the mall before, but now Konami looks like they're going to be endorsing these official ones and kind of a more kid audience going for the DDR Disney mix.
Exactly, and speaking of wonderful plug-and-play DDR type things, Konami is putting out Strawberry Shortcake Dance Dance Revolution.
Yes, you can play as Strawberry Shortcake in Dance Dance Revolution with the equally cheesy dance pad that looks like, I don't know, basically getting any five-year-old pre-teen girl super excited about...
Jumping around to her favorite Strawberry Shortcake song.
Which, to be honest, I didn't think there was that many Strawberry Shortcake songs out there.
I didn't think there were that many either.
I didn't even think Strawberry Shortcake was still popular.
I mean, where's My Little Pony?
My Little Pony's out again too.
I thought it would have been Bratz DDR, if nothing else.
Well, remember those, I don't remember whatever came of this, but they were talking about a DDR TV show.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
D.D.R.
Hardcore
that maybe the parents will want a DDR for themselves, so on and so on.
I look at it in the same way that they got the Oha style one in Japan, honestly.
It's the same thing.
Exactly.
Oh, that's a good point.
And this features such wonderful songs like the theme music, Straw-ba-ba-ba-berry shortcake.
So apparently Strawberry Shortcake has a stutter.
That's excellent.
Straw-ba-ba-ba-ba-shortcake!
Yeah!
Whatever.
I don't know.
Blaze Revolution says, I bought DDR Disney Mix for my sister and I played it for her.
LOL.
That brings the family together.
I actually have both of them.
Except I didn't get the Nintendo 64 one.
You know, DDR Disney Mix did have something that was pretty revolutionary for DDR at the time.
Dance Magic.
DanceMagic is fabulous.
That was the best part of the game.
Honestly, for the hardcore DDR fans, that was the whole reason to own it.
That and Electrical Parade, says VidPower, except Electrical Parade wasn't in the US version.
Only in the Japanese one.
You had to get Disney's Rave, the Japanese version.
Disney's Rave, though, did have a few better songs, I have to say.
It had the Macarena.
I remember you making me play that in Milpitas.
I was like, okay, Rob, pick me a song.
Macarena, I hate you.
And then Mr. Bassman.
That song's awesome.
It is, but it's like slow.
I played Mr. Bassman a few weeks ago, and I nearly died because I was out of shape.
Jeremy Todd 1 suggests DDR Pirates of the Caribbean, the game where you have to dance to dodge the skeletons.
Hey, if DDR Disney does well, you can expect a whole bunch of freaking clones of it.
That's when you do a jig and the stage moves like you're on a boat.
Andrew, why are you making a face?
You're about to swallow your bottom lip there.
This is my sad panda face.
Why, though?
Isn't exposure for the DDR brand a good thing for the fanbase?
Not when it's freaking Disney.
Leave it to Kingdom Hearts or something.
Kingdom Hearts?
No more DDR Disney.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
The whole part was bad enough.
Unfortunately it's not going to happen since there was a partnership between Konami and Buena Vista to put out a ton more games.
So you're going to see a lot more of these before they go away.
And they will never go away, by the way.
Hooray, hooray.
Well, speaking of DDR, Ohasta, and things that just won't go away, every week here on this program, we have DarkSakura's Website of the Week segment because she serves the web up and down and left and right and back and forth, inside and out, looking for sites that you need to be visiting right now.
So, DarkSakura, where should the kids be going in their browsers right now?
World of Datecraft World of Datecraft
The website is wowdate.fullwiki.com Yeah, I'll spell it out.
w-o-w-d-a-t-e dot f-u-l-l-w-i-k-i dot com Which I will not spell.
If you can't spell com, go back to school.
So, yeah, this site is a dating site for people on World of Warcraft.
How to meet people who may or may not be of the gender they specify.
Wait, wait.
Or the age that they specify.
Is this a site for me to put up a personal ad for my WoW character or a personal ad for me?
Because I know my friend, this sick, sick woman she is, has a MySpace for her WoW character.
This is apparently real profiles.
And you can put your pictures.
And there's also couples on here, too, I guess, looking for other couples to experiment with.
Excellent.
World of Datecraft, where everybody looks like the Horde.
So you never know that that 18-year-old woman from Cleveland might really be a 56-year-old man from Albany, Georgia.
Hey, hey, it's a post-op.
Woman.
All right, all right, all right.
Confession, I do play a female orc warlock, okay?
Exactly.
I will never play a male character in any MMO ever again.
I will always play female characters.
You know why?
Free stuff.
True.
Free stuff?
It's sad and true.
Even on board, free stuff.
You people are making me very ill.
Slash dance for silver.
Works every time.
Even bipedal cows get free stuff.
I play with my coworkers and they give me money.
I don't like it either.
I don't like that difference.
Then don't do it!
Take the moral high ground!
No!
Free stuff, Jamie!
Well, I can actually get away with cuting on a game and having them give me money.
Hey, if you can, shake what the Earth Mother gave you.
VidPower says 99.9% of female night elves are guys.
True.
This is truth.
True statement.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Back on Virtual On, my two characters were either Fae-En or the big bulky one with the big gun.
Because I was like, who I can shoot you from over here and you can't get close to me.
One thing I liked about Ragnarok Online when I played that is... Nobody's ugly?
Well, because everybody looks the same.
But one thing you could do is you could cross-dress on Ragnarok Online.
Like, remember I used to have the giant bow?
Yeah, I had the giant bow in my hair.
That was awesome.
I still have that picture.
It used to be my cell phone.
My rogue has a dress.
I'm sorry.
My rogue has a spare dress.
For when the roleplay gets kind of weird.
Dot, dot, dot.
The show's starting to get a little weird.
And you admit this on the airway in front of several thousand downloaders.
Yes, yes.
You can, uh, no.
And you can message him at this is 23rd Megan.
Where's this?
At World of Warcraft.
Will you do a search for 21-year-olds in the Sacramento area?
Because I want to see if Andrew comes up.
Actually, will you look for some profiles in our area?
Maybe we should respond to one.
Are you on here, Andrew?
Are we going to find you?
Not yet.
I will do that just for shits.
I will indulge you on that.
I don't think it actually lets you look in area.
However, there's a guy.
I found a guy in Baton Rouge.
That's not bad.
That's a little far, but it's some long-distance dating.
You know what?
Okay, even though we're giving this crap a hard time.
I found a person who looks like Tran, as in Big Alien.
From Australia.
Even though we're giving this crap a hard time.
I want to be devil's advocate for a minute talking about wow dating and all that stuff.
When it comes to long distance relationships, isn't wow like a way that you could, and please don't take this as me saying I do this because I don't, but like I've heard of other people doing this.
Isn't wow kind of a way that you could like be with somebody even though you're not?
You know what I mean?
Like, you can adventure and do things together with somebody in a virtual form, even though you're not there, really there.
Well, you know, when Dan and I first met, we would just hang out on an AOL chat for, like, ever.
Because, you know, at the time, that's what we had.
We played Gemstone for a little while.
But, yeah, back in the day, Gemstone.
And Slingo?
No, I hate Slingo.
Okay.
And I played Tetranet.
I was a Tetranet girl.
But, yeah, it's...
I suppose it's sort of a way to at least see a part of you together with the person you're interested in.
And online relationships can make long distance easier, I think.
But honestly, nothing's going to make up for the face-to-face meeting.
And when you start wanking to the in-game sprites, that might be a little... No, no, no, that's not going to happen.
Why?
Something you need to share?
Uh, no.
So you're the one who's been buying out the plastic covers at Fry's.
So that was you on YouTube.
Oh, really?
Under Wankmaster.
Seriously, though, online gaming can be kind of a touchy thing with relationships.
Especially in party-based games, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy.
If your significant other isn't, say, pulling his or her weight, that could lead to an even bigger argument than you can ever have in person.
Interesting.
So you think WoW could actually cause fights?
It could cause a whole lot of fights.
Interesting.
Especially if one of them happens to be a healer.
I'm looking through chat here.
I kind of thought it would be a little... You can actually get married on Ragnarok on the Korean servers.
I thought it would be a little more lit up in chat.
Why do we never get this stuff?
Yuri Lover in chat says, when I play WoW, I get free tampons and condoms.
I have no idea how that works, but okay.
Hack!
It's going to be in the next patch, probably.
That's a hell of a hack.
What exactly would a tampon do for you?
Plus two to stamina?
What exactly?
I still think that they should do the hat idea like they had in Ragnarok with the poo hat and the apple of archer.
Jeremy Todd 1 says the WoW dating service is just for nerds who can tell their friends that they have a girlfriend.
Yeah, so?
I resemble that remark.
EvilCheese666 says ultimate WoW pickup line.
So, hey baby, you grind here often?
Nice!
That one's great.
I'll show you my Arcanite Reaper.
Oh, I didn't say that on the... What'd you say?
I picked my proficiencies, by the way.
Oh, what's that?
I picked tailoring and herbalism.
Fun.
So I can, you know, go get Gloomweed.
Your lover says he plays Triple X WoW, so now where are you going?
So you can make...
You can make clothes with hemp and you can... I can make hemp clothes and be a hippie.
A hippie zombie.
I think we probably should go on to the next topic now.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Maybe later.
We'll come back to it later.
This is huge.
I think this is huge.
It's a rumor, but it could be huge.
And you know that we've been speculating for a long time that Apple wants to get into the gaming market.
and also there's been speculation out there that Apple and Nintendo want to get into bed together.
So that just makes this story... Actually, Apple and Nintendo have been dating on World of Warcraft, believe it or not.
No, seriously, there is a rumor going around on MacRumors, and it's saying that Apple is currently planning on making classic Nintendo games playable on the next iPod.
Now, the website is not able to confirm this speculation, but, you know, it does fit into that whole fanboy dream, doesn't it?
Now, MacRumors says that it's going to be playable with a special accessory.
Whatever that is.
That special accessory...
Transvibrator.
No, it's... Special Accessory is another game system.
What do you think, Loki?
I'm really curious to see what you think about this.
You know I need your input on this.
What do I think?
I think, well, that would be disruption.
They're always talking about the... I think it's all, you know, bullshit just because I don't think that they would want their classics to be played on iPod.
One, you couldn't do it on iPod anyways because, I mean, come on, the iPod is not meant for gaming.
I mean...
But, okay, but let's say, like, iPods have that little slot at the bottom that you usually put the USB charger into.
I know you wouldn't know that, but they do.
You could easily plug a joystick in there, or like a little NES-style controller.
There you go.
Gaming system on the go.
I could see it.
You couldn't do it with the current setup.
You would have to have this attachment, but you could do it.
But the question is, would they want to?
Because my thought when reading this was, well, what about virtual console and being able to download to your DS?
Why not?
Again, I'm speculating with that.
They haven't said you'll officially be able to do that.
But logically, you'll be able to download some stuff to the DS.
Why not virtual console games?
So why would Nintendo compete with itself?
They wouldn't compete with itself.
They would use it probably just to help promote themselves.
I don't know.
I don't think... So you're thinking 1Z, 2Z games?
But who's going to buy the accessory for 1Z, 2Z games?
I don't know.
And here's the thing, too.
I don't know if they would do that because just because you're playing retro games on your iPod does not make you want to buy...
I don't know how they're going to make money off this.
I guess if you buy each individual title or whatever and download it to your iPod, I guess that would be kind of neat, but whatever.
To be honest, I don't think this is going to happen.
Apple is trying to grow a gaming penis and isn't doing a good job of it.
Apple does have a booth at E3 every year.
It's little, and it's in the back, and you have to have an invite to get there, but they're there.
But I always kind of assumed it was for their graphics or type stuff that they can do for computer.
Anyway, and then let's see.
Macman says they're announcing a new iPod this August.
Well, that's no surprise.
They need to announce a new iPod to sell them this Christmas.
But my thought was it's going to be the movie iPod because it's already been going around.
They want to put that in iTunes, so that makes sense.
What do you think about this, Jamie?
Would this make you want a game on the iPod, having NES games on it?
Yeah, it'd be something to do at work.
I'm kidding, no.
In between the Animal Crossing?
No, I don't play Animal Crossing at work anymore.
I take a nap.
It's true.
My doctor told me to.
It's true.
I would do it.
Say that I'm stuck in line...
for the bathroom at the Riptide Arcade, which I was standing in for 25 minutes.
Wow.
It gave me something to do.
So, yeah.
All right.
Okay.
Well, speaking of other portable music systems, the Zune has been officially confirmed by Microsoft.
It is coming, and it's actually all will be revealed soon, according to them, in a brand-new Billboard magazine article, which is going to be talking about it and how they also plan to release additional Zune-branded devices.
There's also a fun little website you can go view, which...
Thank you for watching!
So one kind of interesting thing though, they said that it will reportedly include access to digital media and a wide range of Windows-powered devices.
And also they're saying that it's going to be something that aspires to be one part MySpace, one part iTunes, and part Xbox Live.
So I don't know what exactly that's supposed to mean, but they're saying that maybe after this you're going to see probably a video player and possibly a portable games device.
All branded with this brand new Zune thing.
Does this have anything to do with gaming though?
In the end, do you think anything gaming will come of this?
Actually, one thing that was interesting about that, and I remember reading this a while back, is the Zune is actually going to be fit with a processor that's a bit more powerful than you would really need for playing music on it.
So it's something comparable to maybe like a PSP or even more powerful than that, which is interesting when you think about it.
Interesting.
I think it's interesting you brought up the whole MySpace thing too.
MySpace is interesting.
By the way, Orange Launch Radio has a MySpace.
You should add us as your friend today.
MySpace.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
Thank you.
But MySpace is huge right now.
What is it, like the fourth most visited site on the internet?
Yeah.
I would think more people want a piece of Myspace.
I don't think competitors to Myspace work as well.
Why aren't people trying to team up with Myspace?
Think about this.
Altel Wireless has that Myspace on-the-go type thing.
It actually is branded with Myspace.
I don't know what the hell you'd do with that.
Post messages, I guess?
Whatever.
Still, though, that's something that they can have and maybe even add later on.
They're going to have MyZune.com or something like that where you'd have your own
MySpace is so interesting though.
It's like that site that everybody uses because they have to, but nobody likes to admit they use it.
You know what I mean?
I stayed after Clerks 2 to see the MySpace names on there, and apparently I'm on there twice, but it's like six rows of names going pretty fast down the screen, and even though it's in alphabetical order by our last name, it's still fucking hard to find yourself on there.
and the DVD.
It's going to have everybody that's on there right now.
So that's over 100,000 names on the DVD.
Our buddy Bobby Blackwolf is in chat right now.
By the way, he had his one year birthday tonight for his show.
So congratulations, Bobby.
And it's all downhill from there.
Blackwolf says, Microsoft's ad campaign.
MySpace is where the internet goes to die.
MyZune is where the internet goes to live anywhere.
Get it?
Live?
Life?
It's true, though.
Actually, that's pretty punny.
I am not writing that shit down, Bobby.
Don't ask.
Alright.
Are you a big MySpace fan, DarkSakura?
I'm only there because I have to be.
Exactly, that's how I feel about it too.
Because I have friends that won't get on LiveJournal, so I have to keep up with them on MySpace.
Although I did find one of my best friends from high school.
Yeah, that's kind of the same reason I use it, is that I found people that I would never have reconnected with.
Someone I didn't like, his sister messaged me.
Said, oh yeah, my brother's so cool.
Are you friends with him?
Yeah.
You know the other great thing about MySpace, and I swear I'll get back into games.
I've been able to go back to my high school graduating class
and see who's gay.
Because you can go back and really see what became of everybody.
Like, oh, I knew he was gay.
I knew she was gay.
I knew that.
And then all the people that had 70 babies.
Just everything played out exactly like you expected.
You turned out to be a breeder.
Exactly.
Excellent.
Anyway, sorry for that randomness there.
Let's get back to games and we'll talk about Konami.
We love to talk about Konami.
We've talked about them for years and years and years.
Konami has announced a partnership with mobile gaming company Tokyopop to launch a new series of mobile games.
Now, Tokyopop is kind of like this youth-oriented entertainment and all that stuff.
Now, Tokyopop is also the number one manga company in the U.S.
and they will be launching together a series of mobile games starting with East Coast Rising.
This is a story that has to do with pirates and high seas adventure and that will be available in early fall.
Comes a quote from Stu Levy, the CEO of Tokyopop.
We are very excited to be partnering with Konami to move to Tokyopop's creative juice in the white hot area of mobile gaming.
Our two brands both stand for an east meets west aesthetic that really speaks out to fans worldwide.
So working together is a natural fit that will truly push the envelope.
Should be interesting to see where that partnership goes.

My first email actually has to do with something that my husband's been ogling over, but I'd like to thank our dear friend Rob with Two Bees for mentioning it to me.
Stern, basically the only company that's still making pinball machines, has a Pirates of the Caribbean pinball machine.
And I saw pictures of it last night.
It actually looks pretty darn cool.
It has a sinking ship and a treasure chest and all kinds of cool stuff that pops up.
But it's actually around $4,000 right now.
So yeah, we've been sort of debating, can we justify the expense of a $4,000 pinball machine?
Yeah, let's do it.
But anyway, I posted a bit of an article on here that said, to quote on here, Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is the perfect title and theme for a pinball, said Factory Honcho Gary Stern.
It lends itself to lots of mechanical action pinball shots and toys for casual players, yet the story cries for deep rules to challenge the best of players.
And from what I've heard from other pinball geeks like me and my hubby, it's supposed to be pretty hardcore, so...
Got another email.
We got one, a short one from Crispy Creamy, who's one of our chatroom people too.
Said, hey guys, I just got Guitar Hero for my birthday and it totally rocks, but I would also like to try out the new Guitar Freaks game.
New?
Because my Guitar Freaks controller broke.
Is it possible to use a Guitar Hero controller on Guitar Freaks?
The answer is yes.
It is?
Yes.
Oh.
I didn't know that.
I would have said no, but I haven't tried.
Actually, the Guitar Freaks controller works on Guitar Hero 2 only barely.
You have to configure it, but we were trying to do two-player.
I thought they did experiments that showed that wasn't true.
No.
It's barely compatible, but it is.
I'll be damned.
Remember how we talked about the... Oh, maybe it was one of the shows where you weren't here.
Kenami Trademarked Guitar Revolution Hey, let's make a game out of this
The Gamer
Here's a question I was just wondering.
He's the gamer.
That's it.
He's the gamer.
And every time we talk about gaming news, it's about this guy.
I had to, sorry.
A million Margaret Cho quotes are going through my head now.
Let's keep it moving.
Where's this parade?
Let's keep it moving.
Since you guys live in California, do you ever go to the Price is Right?
Rob?
I've been one time.
I have.
I went once.
You sat by Dude, right?
Yes, it was in April.
I got you on TV.
It was April of 2002, and I was in L.A.
for Coachella that year.
This has nothing to do with gaming, but I don't care.
I was in L.A.
for Coachella that year, because I went, and we decided we would go by The Price is Right.
You know, hell, why not?
Well, we actually got to go to two tapings, because a big group had canceled for the second taping.
They do two tapings on Monday.
And for the second taping, I got to sit right behind Rod Roddy, because this was about a year before he passed away.
And it was sparkling in my face, and everything sparkles.
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
You know what I could see on Rod Roddy's platform?
Tax forms.
You know what's on those tax forms?
All of the prices of all the prizes.
So all you had to do was look at that, and if they called me up on stage, which they didn't because I'm boring, I guess, then I would have won the Showcase Showdown.
And I kind of would have been cheating, but at the same time, I don't think I would have felt bad about it because I would have had a new car.
That you have to pay taxes on.
I would have sold the... There's always some crap prize in the Showcase Showdown.
I would have sold like the, you know... I don't even fucking have room for a dinette set in the house, okay?
I would have sold that shit to pay the taxes on the car.
Well, I'm saying... I just think it's kind of funny that you win all these prizes and you have to pay taxes for them.
Well, you know, our friend Mel won on... That's right.
On Wheel of Fortune.
Wheel of Fortune.
We should go on a game show.
We should all go on a game show.
Like Survivor.
No.
No.
You know how much weight I'd lose?
Alright, anyway.
But the rest of this email, basically he didn't leave a voicemail, because he didn't want to pay for it.
Fair enough.
Okay.
I think the games have gotten easier, because back in the 80s, there were arcade games like Pac-Man, Centipede, and this command where there was no storyline to it.
All it was was basically the same level, except the enemies moved faster and less time to do stuff, and that made it harder.
Also, the old games, since it is harder, your most...
You are mostly going to get a game over and a game over meant that you had to start from the beginning.
Now once you get past a certain point in the game, it would save, so you'd have to start from the beginning.
This is repeating sort of.
Some games now start to get boring after a while of playing it.
I remember one game on my dad's Atari 2600.
It makes me so sad to hear my dad's Atari 2600.
Oh, wow.
That he had when he was a kid.
That just hit me, too.
Oh, ow, that hurt.
There was a game called Grand Prix.
That was actually, I think, the Odyssey 2, I think.
It was a racing game that had the same cars in the same position, everything, and it challenged you to remember the order of the cars so you could get it perfectly.
But you had to get to the second level.
The cars completely changed position, and it was really hard.
Oh, yeah, that was Atari 2600.
That was...
A lot like RallyX too.
RallyX had the, where you had to do the, oh anyway.
But yeah, he said that he thinks games got easier.
I don't see any punctuation, I'm sorry.
You know, our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat, is talking about the Orange Lounge game show.
They're saying, you know, we shouldn't be on a game show, we should have our own damn game show.
And it looks like some folks are suggesting, like TigerClaw says, it should be kind of like Starcade.
and Starcade was an awesome game show.
Starcade was cool.
You know, didn't we meet one of the guys from Gameplay HD at E3?
Maybe we should send a treatment or something because that would be awesome.
You know, little tidbit about me, it's always been a secret dream of mine to be a game show host.
I would love it so much.
Loki, you could be a Barker's Beauty or something.
I had outlined something similar to that.
That's right.
I remember that was an Orange Lounge show that never happened.
We need to talk about that.
We should do that.
I still have it.
We're talking off air because I bet you would really want to do something like that.
Okay.
This is what happens in an Orange Lounge meeting.
Pass the beer!
Live on-air staff meeting.
Next email comes from Tyson.
As in longer levels, more gameplay.
More games to buy.
You're done with the game, you can go buy another one now.
You lower the replayability, then you're ready for the next thing to come out.
Honestly, it makes... Someone left this in one of the voicemails of the week, which you'll hear in the next part of our show.
But it might have to do with level design and the cost of level design and the difficulty of level design makes it harder to do long levels.
I'm almost seeing sort of, and I hate to bring back pinball in the middle of this...
Why not?
Well, you know, with pinball, when your only competition is yourself, you have to make your old games obsolete and make it so where you can make them obsolete so that you bring out a newer, better product.
So I think that they actually put this limitation in some games so that they know that by the time the average player is done with this game, their next title is ready to come out.
Shaoran108
Greetings, OLR crew.
Recently, you have been mentioning an Orange Launch Army on the podcast that got me thinking.
I recently started a file in Disgaea Hour of Darkness and decided to name my starting non-storyline characters after members of the OLR crew.
That's so cute.
And some other people mentioned on the show.
My three prinnies are named Sky, Loki, and Shane.
My red mage is Tia.
And it's spelled like Tia doesn't hurt, though.
Blue Mage is Rice Princess, the Green Mage is Pixie Dust, I have two brawlers and DarkSakura This person is an old school OLR listener because Rice Princess has been on Orange Lounge Radio for at least a year if not more It's been ages since we've also had Pixie Dust, oh my gosh The Orange Lounge Madam Wow You sir are old school and we applaud you Tia moved to New York
Yeah.
She's not going to be on our show anymore.
Not if we can help it.
We'll get her on the phone at some point.
I will chase her ass down.
I love her.
Anyway.
Anyway, getting to the point, I intend to pick up Disgaea 2, Cursed Memories, as soon as it is released in the U.S.
I would like to create an Orange Lounge attack force with characters named after the LLR crew.
August 28th, by the way.
If you have played the first game, seeing as how I believe most of the character classes and monster classes will be brought over from the first game, I would like not only your permission to call them a faction of the OL Army, but also have opinions on what character monster classes you would like to be represented as.
As far as I'm concerned, name away.
Use OL Army in your game all you want.
I think that's rad.
Send screenshots.
Send screenshots.
If it involves fire, I'll take anything that involves fire.
Fire and cute.
It has to be fire and cute.
You know, Disgaea has that one... Disgaea kind of has cute all over it.
Like, you know what I mean?
Fire, fuego, fiore.
You'll have to forgive me.
I haven't played a whole lot of Disgaea, but I remember there was like a... One of the lead characters was like a vampire girl that was kind of a smartass.
Etna.
Etna, yeah.
I'd be a vampire smartass.
She reminds me of you.
She reminds me of you.
So, that would be... Just because I am a smartass.
Just not a vampire.
Alright.
or are you?
Oh, do I need to get my garlic necklace?
You invited me in.
I tend to be drawn towards healing types, but I don't know.
I like summoners too, but I don't think, does this guy have something like that?
I didn't play enough of it.
I like fire.
Make me a treasure hunter.
Probably has to be the thief.
Treasure hunter.
I like fire.
Can you tell Locke's one of my favorite characters ever in a game?
I love Locke.
Treasure hunter.
Loki, what would you be?
I don't care.
He'd be a big oaf with a club.
That's Loki.
He'd be the brute.
Smash Mac.
Smash Mac.
He'd be the Hulk.
And Andrew would be one of those penguins that you throw and explode.
I also did get another piece of news that has nothing to do with games or anything in the mailbox.
Weird Al's next album is going to be out September 26th.
Sweet.
by the way I have to say this since the OL Army got brought up I love love love this on the threads have you guys seen the trading card game people are going off on like it's gone like three pages the trading card game in our forums like people coming up with these cards and man there's some like old school references back to like pre-podcast episodes of Orange Lounge Radio and stuff it's just it's nutty you guys are awesome we have such awesome listeners and even the screenshots have continued people have been submitting screenshots of like Orange Lounge references and games and like
You guys are so awesome.
We don't even have to promote when you guys are doing that.
It's so awesome.
But word of mouth is where it's at.
I've been trying to play more online Chromehounds since I know we have the OLR army on there.
The problem is, though, in order to play online and actually have some decent mechs, you have to play the offline version.
Seriously though, send us your screenshots of Orange Lounge in random games and we will do a collage for the site or something.
It would be awesome.
I'll tell you what, if everyone does it high quality enough, who knows, maybe we'll see about having an official game or something.
Dark Knight says, we are the Orange Lounge Radio Street team.
That's a good reference.
You guys really are doing that for us.
We love you guys for it.
Here's my thought.
I would love this.
I don't know about you guys.
And I know we have a couple industry people that listen to the show.
How awesome would it be to be like a voice in a video game?
Like actually voice a character for some game?
I've done voice acting before.
Not for a major game, have you?
No, but I've done voice acting for a radio drama.
Oh, okay.
That's cool.
I've done a little voice acting for a fan dub and that's about it.
Okay.
Yeah, somebody was supposed to give me information about voice acting for said fan dub.
Okay, okay.
Anyway, yeah, that would be awesome, but I don't know.
I was doing a I Feel Sick the radio drama.
All right, anyway.
I was the b-girl.
Industry peeps, if you're listening, throw us a cameo.
Seriously.
All right, so that's it for the mailbag?
Yes it is.
Send us email mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com because we love getting emails.
You guys rock.
All right.
Excellent.
Well, speaking of fun stuff, Sony is patenting a brand new, well, I guess next gen eye toy type of device, which is not too surprising when you think about it because, I mean, it did after all have the eye of justice or eye of judgment.
Yeah, not justice.
That'd be a whole other game.
But I have judgment.
Basically, in a nutshell, this whole brand new eye toy, what's supposed to be kind of neat about it is that it has technology to allow one single 2D camera to analyze objects in full 3D using some sort of patented mapping technique.
Previously, the only way you could do this is with two cameras, but now they've
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Except my living room is not a white background, as seen in said test areas.
But, I don't know.
This is the day of Martha Stewart, where everybody paints her, like has a red wall, and then a green wall, and then a beige wall, and then a puce wall.
I see a red wall and I want to paint it black
Hooray!
Well, I have something to make people go yippy, sort of.
It's Sony, so how excited can we be?
Sony Online Entertainment actually has an agreement done with Epic Games to license the Unreal Engine 3.
So, there's a quote here from...
via Epic's Game President Mark Raine saying, Sony Online Entertainment has a reputation for delivering detailed, truly engaging, interactive online worlds.
It is a great privilege for us that they're using Unreal Engine 3 to create their next generation projects.
Of course, we've also seen it licensed by THQ, BioWare, Midway, Atari, Buena Vista.
Yeah.
Who hasn't licensed it at this point?
Heck, I licensed it just yesterday to do my taxes.
Oh yeah, well I better get a return on this, die!
No.
Oh, what a compliment to the creators there, you know, your engine's getting used everywhere.
Sony's just jealous everybody else had it first.
Eddie in our chatroom says, oh I should say OL Army Eddie in our chatroom says, boo Epic for supporting Sony.
Seriously.
Speaking of everyone having a piece of it, Hillary Clinton, she's, I'm not talking about Bill Clinton by the way.
Yeah, I don't know if you phrased that exactly the way you intended.
Anyways, Hillary Clinton... We mean piece of it or full of it?
Piece of it, you know, because everybody has fucked Bill Clinton.
I didn't fuck... You know what, let's just get this started.
Games, games, please, games.
Is it the heat that's making everyone crazy tonight?
It is the heat, oh my god.
Did you put something in those fucking cookies?
No, I didn't, they're Trader Joe's cookie mix.
Trader Joe's ganja cookie mix.
Oh, come on!
It's all natural, man!
First of all, I know that you are allergic, and I am allergic, and it would be pretty funny to get Andrew all on some ganja cookies, though.
Orange Downs Radio does not condone the use of drugs or crap, but we do endorse beer.
Anyways, let's go back to this.
Hillary Clinton!
Go Hillary!
No, she's actually trying to... Give her some ganja cookies.
Seriously.
No, no, no, no.
She already had her batch of those when she was in law school.
I didn't inhale.
I bet she baked a batch of special brownies for her teacher and that's how she passed all her finals.
Okay.
Poor Loki!
I have done the X-Facts bounty trick.
Do not laugh about that.
Loki is usually the one that derails this show, and he looks so frustrated right now.
Anyways, so, Hillary Clinton.
Cookie!
She's actually kind of in the focus of a brand new scandal now.
It's having to do with legislation that she's supposedly going to be trying to pass to impose a tax on games.
and, you know, basically, I don't know what the purpose of this would be, you know, and still no way to actually confirm whether this is true or not, but great!
Taxing games!
God, I really hate her.
And she just gives me another reason.
Other than her being an ugly skank.
There's already a tax on them.
It's called sales tax.
Yeah, but she wants a better tax because, you know, everybody's got to pay for the crazy people that go out and murder in the name of video games.
And so I guess this would pay for this.
Then they need to put a tax on board games.
They need to put a tax on other computer programs.
Don't give her any ideas.
I could only support this if it was across the board.
Like, you know, it's video games, movies...
and lots of forms of entertainment rather than just singling out video games.
Because honestly, what's the difference?
Well, this is a really stupid platform for her to be talking on anyways.
And I really hate how the rumor is that they're going to be using this in the 2008 elections.
Video game violence and that kind of crap.
She should take a cue from her buddy Jack who got basically told to fuck off by the court.
That was legendary.
That was beautiful.
Seriously, next thing you know they'll be putting a tax on cigarettes.
Oh, wait.
He tried to do his whole friend of the court thing and the judge is like, screw you!
Piss off!
In a paraphrase, by the way.
We'll see what happens.
He's probably thinking it.
So basically, one thing is, Clinton is waging a public crusade against games and apparently, a recent speech in front of the Kaiser Family Foundation, she accused modern society of performing a massive experiment on millions of children
by exposing them to games, electronic media, and omnipresent advertising.
At the rate technology is advancing, people will be implanting chips in our children to advertise directly into their brains and tell them what kind of products to buy, Clinton warned.
Of course, being that she's in a government position, I'm sure she realizes that also the U.S.
Army is using those tactics with America's Army as their recruiting tool.
Do you know how bad I would want to just pick her brain and see where she's coming from on this?
Like, I want her on the show so, so bad.
It is not even funny.
Like, I just want to know, why games?
What is making you tick on this whole thing, you know?
Because her husband would rather play some Grand Theft Auto than give her Nookie, okay?
Wait, wait, wait, Loki, read that last paragraph again, the one about the chips.
Let's see here.
At the rate that technology is advancing, people will be implanting chips in our children to advertise directly into their brains and tell them what kind of products to buy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we already know this, but this bitch has gone off the deep end.
Seriously, what the hell?
This is making me think of that one episode of C-Lab.
You remember C-Lab, where they went on the surface and all these people were addicted to a video game?
Oh, God.
Well, basically, this comes to us from Rocky Mountain News, and it was shared to them from a very reliable source, but very reliable and very anonymous.
Interesting.
What are you looking at there?
I'm looking at the notice in order by James Brady, judge of the Middle District of Louisiana.
It is ordered that the motion for leave to file an amicus curiae brief be and is hereby denied.
God, you can find anything on the internet.
It's denied, bitch.
It's in capital letters.
Notice how big, bold, and beautiful that word denied is.
It's one page with no explanation.
It's basically the legal fuck-off.
So I'm going to post this in the chatroom.
I didn't mean to hijack your thing, but the chatroom should see this.
EvilCheese666 in the chatroom says, We need to mobilize the OL Army.
We're going to war to stop the evil of taxes.
I'm not anti-taxes if it's going to a good cause.
No tax return.
I'm not for this because it's unfair.
It's targeting one element of entertainment that seems to be the common scapegoat.
Well, if any of our listeners that would like, you know, who are hearing this later in the week, it's at gamepolitics.com slash images slash la-jt-denied.pdf.
Make sure you have that for that reader.
Game Politics is a beautiful site.
I love Game Politics.
Those guys are like my hero forever.
By the way, just as a friendly reminder, if you want to, you know, we at Orange Lawn Trader are all about making your, getting your,
Thank you for watching!
Tell your friends.
It's just like we said before.
If you have a problem with what the companies are doing, buy stock.
No, I'm serious.
You can't buy stock in Hillary Clinton, though.
I'm saying the companies.
If you have problems with what the government's doing, write your congressman.
Send a letter in to the various different... There's also a number of different bureaus that are in charge of these various different proposals that will eventually go back in effect.
You can...
What, the Trade Commission, I believe it is?
Even on an international level, there's also international, you know, the Tariff and Trade.
Rob?
Sorry, something in the chat room gave me the giggles.
Go ahead and finish, sorry.
You derailed me.
It's funny because, where was it?
OL Army Eddie in chat room says, Dear Snedder, I'm a registered boater.
Please stop eating cookies.
My cookies are top notch.
I think now's a good time to go to break and find our rails again and let it cool off a little more in here and get this heat out of here.
And we'll be back with Part B. Who knows what's to come in Part B of Orange Launch Radio.
I know your Skype calls are coming.
The voicemails of the week are coming.
News on the Wii's coming.
It's all coming up in Part B right after this.
