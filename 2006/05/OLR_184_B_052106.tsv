45394	45734	DarkSakura.com
74366	75207	I know what you mean.
75568	77770	Okay, it's something far superior to anime.
77810	78631	Whatever, whatever.
79312	86020	It is a convention that is happening that we're going to be at and doing our show live Saturday, 7 o'clock, panel room 1.
86340	87522	Make sure you bathe.
89329	90990	DarkSakura will be there with Febreze.
91570	93312	I will be there with Febreze and deodorant.
93592	95533	I will also be cosplaying.
95953	100836	We're also doing a panel Sunday at 7 about podcasting but it's not the show being taped.
100856	103218	We hope you come out to that anyway but that's not actually our show being taped.
103438	105980	That's us talking about how to be podcasting superstars.
106020	107461	We should record it anyways.
108291	109272	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
133792	141516	Just remember, even if you think we suck, we do this for free, and we don't get paid to do it like some of those guys over at some of the bigger websites, you know?
141656	143958	So, um, just keep that in mind.
144818	145118	Jerk.
145799	148800	Yes, we put as much effort into it as we get paid.
148960	151482	Alright, Loki, getting into the news.
151982	152742	PlayStation 3.
154083	156264	Yes, oh, PlayStation 3.
157285	158405	What is wrong with you?
159206	159686	Seriously.
159706	160326	Where can we start?
162147	163208	No, but anyways, um,
164292	168556	The big gripe with everyone in PlayStation 3 is, what games are going to be at launch?
168996	173000	And well, that's a good question, because we don't really know.
173220	174441	There's a lot of titles missing.
175502	189816	For example, the CEO David Reeves of Sonic Beer Entertainment Europe mentioned that quite a few titles won't be making their launch date on November 17th.
191147	196230	And here's basically the status, kind of running down things, of certain titles that they definitely showed at E3.
196710	197770	First one, SingStar.
198591	199771	Eh, certainly before Christmas.
200172	202333	But it doesn't really say, you know, at launch.
203033	206375	An iToy game will be available after Christmas.
206675	211337	iToy is not playable at the moment, but it will come before March 2007.
211477	212798	Oh, that's good.
213478	214119	Sooner than never.
215779	220622	Heavenly Sword Formula 1 Motorstorm will not come out until after Christmas.
222016	224718	Resistance, Fall of Man will certainly be a launch title.
224738	227621	Well, I'm glad one of those is actually going to be available.
228922	233885	So, you know, which 15 launch titles are supposed to be there?
234005	234326	Who knows?
235146	238489	But, well, I know a couple of them, but, you know.
239109	239589	Oh, do you?
239790	241171	I'm not sharing that.
241731	249777	Well, for example, one of them that actually most websites haven't been mentioning, Fear is going to be on the PlayStation 3 at launch.
250217	250838	How do you know this?
251758	254460	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
281388	282550	But your systems contradict that.
283130	283270	Yep.
283511	283791	Alright.
284091	289378	We have it for... We actually have it for the PlayStation 3 and the 360, so... Yeah.
290479	290680	Alright.
290960	292522	Sorry, no Wii version of fear out there.
294349	295750	All right.
296630	302674	Moving on, also about the PlayStation 3, a lot of people kind of mad about the lack of a rumble feature.
303154	311598	Now, Sony is saying that they didn't want to do it because it interferes with the whole tilt thing, but I think a lot of us are looking at that and going, mm-hmm, what about the lawsuit?
311939	313459	Well, this is what is interesting.
314600	323182	Immersion, who's the company who's involved in this lawsuit, says, I don't believe it's a very difficult problem to solve, referring to the shocking getting in the way of the tilt sensory.
323522	326883	And Immersion is experts that would be happy to solve that problem for them.
327723	334145	But in exchange, Sony is going to have to drop its current appeal against the 2004 lawsuit.
334765	337045	So that is a very interesting exchange.
337065	339626	Like, sure, we'll get you, Rumble, if you pay us a lot of money.
341368	341929	I think so.
341949	343770	I think their system needs all the help it can get.
343790	344070	All right.
362769	364250	I would like to see them do the rumble as well.
364270	369673	Personally, if I had to choose, you know, rumble or tilt, I'd choose a rumble, because the tilt function sucked.
369814	372355	I haven't seen anything that really sells me on the tilt function.
372395	375577	Sure, there was Warhawk, but not enough for me.
376177	380200	So, show me why I need tilt, and maybe I'll say that.
380780	380940	Yeah.
381761	382001	Alright.
382281	383542	I can get tilt already at home.
384383	385243	Oh, with the pinball machine?
385263	385803	With the pinball machine.
386704	387545	Well, that's a little different.
388245	388745	You know what?
388905	391287	I prefer that kind of tilt to Sony's tilt, so...
392556	394338	Maybe they just haven't put it in the right game yet.
394358	394818	We'll see, though.
394858	395138	We'll see.
395879	397400	Loki, developers.
398040	401883	Getting frustrated because they haven't received PS3 dev kits yet.
402644	407767	In fact, some of the major ones, THQ and Sega, just haven't gotten dev kits.
409108	419536	THQ boss Brian Farrell reportedly said that his company had killed the work on Sopranos for the PlayStation 3 because it was too risky at the moment since they don't have a dev kit.
420655	427317	So that's kind of important if you want games to be included with your $600 system that's coming out in the fall.
429717	433979	Which, hopefully it's coming out in the fall because they said, oh yeah, we're launching in the fall.
434559	436339	We're launching November 17th or whatever.
437259	439660	Yeah, I remember when they said they were launching back in spring.
440400	443361	So, yeah, it's not looking good.
445902	446302	Interesting.
447852	455117	Loki, we're going to go ahead and go back to you for another story about the Final Fantasy VII remake that was rumored last E3.
455157	455937	What's going on with this?
456318	460460	Well, according to EGM, they're saying yes, it is.
461261	473188	Actually, in their latest edition of the magazine, which I think was actually on the show floor at E3, it says, Last year, Square Enix teased everyone with what they called the Final Fantasy VII PS3 tech demo.
473666	474646	Well, what do you know?
474967	479789	This test case was really a sneak peek at the next gen revival of the PlayStation 1 role-playing hit.
480929	481750	Is it actually coming out?
482550	482970	Eh, maybe.
483910	487252	So, you know, just because the magazine says so, who knows.
487799	488700	Okay, interesting.
489420	493642	I think a lot, well, it would make sense with all the Final Fantasy VII love that Square's been giving lately.
493743	494723	Yeah, it makes total sense.
494963	495644	Yeah, so.
496044	501047	And, you know, there was a whole I heard a friend of a friend thing a while back that said it was happening, but, you know, take that with a grain of salt.
501067	502027	But here's another interesting one.
502067	511433	This isn't from a friend, but, well, you know, someone, I would call this person a friend, but a listener of our station tipped me off on something, which I think is very interesting.
511913	516336	And this was overheard by people that would know what they're talking about.
517537	518157	from Nintendo.
518898	529146	And basically, Nintendo is trying to secure the rights to remake Final Fantasy VII for a portable console in the near future.
530393	540259	So take it with a grain of salt, but this was overheard by a listener of ours from people that would know what they're talking about, that Final Fantasy VII is coming to a portable console, and this is Nintendo.
540579	545502	So obviously it's the DS or some other crazy thing they might have in the works, but I'm pretty sure it's the DS.
546003	552667	So again, take it with a grain of salt, but when I think about it, it makes a lot of sense that Final Fantasy VII would come out on the DS, right?
553267	557570	Well, there's also the fact that basically since the DS is a glorified Nintendo 64 console,
558830	570240	They had Final Fantasy 6 characters as a demo for what would have been Final Fantasy 7 back on the Nintendo 64 until they went to Sony instead.
571060	576885	So basically, they've even had work on this before, technically.
578143	579164	That's a very interesting point.
579184	580905	It wouldn't be too hard to, I guess, make it happen.
581726	583167	People think, oh, it was CD to cartridge.
583688	584008	I don't know.
584308	584669	Not at all.
585289	587571	I think that it would be in their best interest to remake it.
587831	590554	Especially after seeing Final Fantasy III at E3.
590614	595778	Final Fantasy III is in a very similar graphical style, in fact a little better than Final Fantasy VII.
596018	596919	I could totally see it happening.
597660	603685	And let's not also forget that Squeenix is on a currently Final Fantasy binge right now.
605527	634532	Saturating us with Final Fantasy 7 everything What an interesting retort from Nintendo though if that happened because Sony has been really selling you know the PSP you can download the PlayStation 1 game and the game that everyone asks about can I play Final Fantasy 7 on it they're not asking about Ridge Racer they're asking about Final Fantasy 7 will I be able to play Final Fantasy 7 on the PSP and of course the answer is yes but what a great response from Nintendo to be able to play Final Fantasy 7 on the DS but again guys
635112	639281	You know, you have to take it with a little bit of grain of salt right now, but just don't be surprised if it actually happens.
639822	640804	Be very, very interesting.
643289	643549	All right.
645193	645634	Moving on.
647947	660774	There is an HDMI cable coming to the Xbox 360, and Liksang is supposedly offering that you can put your name on a list to be one of the first ones to get this cable when it does come out.
661074	665516	So Liksang has taken pre-orders for this HDMI cable, so people are kind of jumping to conclusions there.
665536	666837	That means one is on the way.
667637	668498	And it would make sense.
668738	670019	Microsoft likes to do that.
670119	673341	If their competition does something, they'll do it as well.
673381	674642	They'll release an upgrade or something.
674662	678765	They've built that 360 to be pretty quickly upgradable, so I could totally see this happening.
678985	680927	I don't know why it didn't happen at launch, but whatever.
681527	681887	It's coming.
682288	692675	And especially if there's an HD DVD player in the works, and this whole discussion about 1080p is the true HD, I think that would make a lot of sense for that HD DVD player to come out, as well as an HDMI cable.
692815	693656	I think that would be...
694494	702038	A good way to answer Sony's Blu-ray is the true HD or whatever.
702078	703479	Moving on, Loki.
704240	704540	Yes.
704860	705320	What else on the 360?
706881	710883	Other things on the 360, well, Devil May Cry.
711884	722250	Actually, they're saying that Devil May Cry 4 might not be exclusive to the PS3, but may debut on the 360 and Revolution as well.
723188	723669	You mean the Wii?
724790	727433	Whatever, the Wii.
727513	739045	According to the latest issue of Famitsu, they basically feature an interview with Hiroshi Kobayashi, the producer of the Devil May Cry series.
739906	741367	So, interesting.
742909	743529	But that's not all.
744591	744851	No, no.
745604	750347	Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition may be coming to Xbox 360 as well.
750367	760332	According to Planet Xbox 360, and they don't really give a source on it, but they say that it's coming to the 360 in the PAL territories.
760953	765655	So they mention September as the launch date for that.
766396	767056	That'd be interesting.
767796	768737	But a rumor for now.
769218	770499	Lots of Devil May Cry love on the 360.
771620	771940	Good deal.
772621	775503	I'm going over to the chat room over at www.orangeentree.com.
775523	776063	Click on chat.
776083	779466	There's a lot of feedback there to what we were saying earlier about the Final Fantasy VII remakes.
780066	782829	DJ PooEater says, How many times can I watch Aeris die?
782909	785010	Stop pulling my heart out, you bastard squeenix.
785811	787712	I can't watch it enough.
788233	792976	I have my game saved where she dies so that I can watch her die over and over.
792996	796819	Will you do that on the PSP version and the PS3 remake and the DS version?
796839	797079	Hell yeah!
799401	801243	I hate Aerith!
801323	806766	You should set it up so that you have it all play at once on all the different... I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate her.
806807	810929	The question is, how are they going to fit all that on a cartridge?
811710	814952	Those DS cartridges are pretty big, and I could see it happening.
816874	825480	I think somebody made a joke, I think Bobby said something, Blackwolf in the chatroom said something about they could put Final Fantasy VII on three carts, and the third cartridge is nothing but the ending.
828423	834905	Rene was saying, in response to me saying everybody's asking for Final Fantasy VII, he's saying I'm asking for Intelligent Cube.
836146	837106	Good call, good call.
838446	841487	Alright, moving on with topics.
842328	845368	There's a brand new add-on coming to Oblivion.
845408	848389	This is really being an expanding, ever-expanding game.
848950	853551	The latest one, according to a Bethesda developer, saying basically it's Goonies.
854537	860920	Because what happens in this mission is that you will take control of a cavernous lair that has a pirate ship in it.
861341	864342	And then once you get the pirate ship, you get to go loot things.
865063	867764	So it's just like the Goonies, because remember they had the pirate ship in the cave?
868204	878590	So get this, even if that doesn't interest you, Bethesda is supposedly working on an additional six to seven add-ons, including an epic dungeon, and they want to release this stuff every three to four weeks.
878910	881171	That's the smartest way to keep your game going, honestly.
881191	882292	That's a great tactic.
883119	890488	Oblivion, a very impressive game, one I need to play more of, but I can't tear myself away from that other RPG I keep playing over and over.
891929	894652	I think Oblivion would be better if it had co-op over live.
895666	897367	Yeah, but then it's an MMO, in a way.
898288	898548	In a way.
898608	899288	Not necessarily.
899588	900689	Alright.
900809	911155	Anyway, it's been a little while since we've been able to take a look inside our old mailbag, but DarkSakura hasn't forgotten about you guys who email us every week at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
911495	916378	So we've got a little bit of a backlog tonight, so we want to let DarkSakura get to it and check the mailbag.
916458	921001	So, DarkSakura, put on your hazmat suit and your rubber gloves and dig on into the mailbag.
927343	929384	This week is actually asbestos.
930344	931185	Yeah, I'm gonna die.
931725	932945	What, are we getting flames this week?
933425	933565	No.
933705	935586	No, I was just saying.
935786	953892	Jeremy Todd emailed us, and basically he wanted to state, and we've actually been talking about this back and forth, about saying that the Wii controller and the PlayStation 3 controller...
956166	957066	Well, let me just start over.
957246	958507	Let me just start over reading this.
958547	958907	That's right.
959927	960447	I'm tired.
961568	961808	Okay.
962108	968050	I just want to address to many people that the PS3 isn't like the Wii controller, since many of the people who watch the Sony conference probably got this impression.
968510	971711	The Wii controller can sense 3D space, but the PS3 controller cannot.
972151	973451	Now, we discussed this.
974391	982094	And basically, to go ahead and point this out, for everybody else who has this misconception, they are almost the same.
982194	983654	The tilt is a gyroscope.
984833	987274	The connection to the TV is infrared.
987894	989715	Not 3D space, it's infrared.
990495	993656	It's just sensitivity the closer and further away you get it.
994276	998097	And it connects to the PS2, I'm sorry, to the Wii by Bluetooth.
999298	1000138	So, basically...
1003429	1029700	I remember when Bobby was talking about this though accelerometers is a big part of the Wii thing too though that not every game uses infrared some use just the accelerometers and some use just the infrared so it just kind of depends on the game you're playing but it's really not all that you know fantastic they just took actually very simple technology and used it in a complex way how I see it okay so yeah um
1031331	1038277	Now this was, our good friend Rob linked me to another editorial at Pointless Waste of Time.
1039138	1047284	And for anyone who wants to read it, because I'm not going to go into the whole thing, it's at pointlesswasteoftime.com slash games slash crash.html.
1047765	1050687	It's life after the video game crash, post E3 2006 edition by...
1054300	1055000	and David Wong.
1062387	1064948	I'm going to read these two paragraphs on here.
1064968	1066208	It says, Who am I?
1066288	1068269	I am the creator of a certain video game console.
1068329	1074050	I don't want to toot my own horn, but let's just say the profits of this machine were $4 billion higher than the Microsoft Xbox.
1074590	1077571	My console consisted of a plastic milk crate with a kitten placed inside.
1077891	1080212	The controller was a wooden rod that could be used to poke the kitten.
1080652	1083433	I sold zero of these consoles, which cost me zero to manufacture.
1083833	1085293	Therefore, my profits were zero.
1085353	1087434	The Xbox, however, lost $4 billion."
1089076	1090817	I want to buy the Poke the Kitten console.
1090837	1091597	That sounds like fun.
1091938	1093879	I need the Poke the Rabbit console instead.
1094579	1102583	And actually, there is a link on this to an article at Joystick about just how much they've kept losing over the Xbox.
1104284	1115430	But it's pretty much going into a lot more detail about basically why the video game industry is going to crash, especially with the release of the PS3.
1116430	1117391	Sony is basically...
1117952	1121854	Planning to take a $400-$500 loss on every single PS3 they sell.
1123195	1125896	Maybe in a few years they'll start making money on it.
1128398	1133200	The first thing that it brings up that I just think is probably the most apt comparison here.
1133721	1135602	It's like, why does the industry have to crash it all?
1135642	1138883	The movie industry is still around over a century later.
1139424	1147028	But it's been proven, especially with the Atari 2600, that you can have a system for a few years, but after a while you'll stop playing it.
1148092	1151693	They're saying that when they released E.T.
1153153	1153993	In 1983, E.T.
1154753	1158934	was supposed to be Atari's biggest game to hit the market.
1159694	1164475	About 6 million of them stayed on shelves.
1164535	1166595	Then again, the game was pretty wretched.
1167295	1170056	But even so, it was just that people weren't playing their 2600s by 1983.
1170176	1171256	Nothing new was out.
1171276	1172516	People got tired of it.
1172576	1173096	It was an old toy.
1179144	1182126	I think that's a very, very good comparison right there.
1182226	1187229	And it's why, you know, how many were all up all over it when they got their GameCube, you know?
1187869	1189130	How many of you are still playing it?
1189210	1190631	When was the last time you played your GameCube, Rob?
1191211	1192252	A while ago, I'll be honest.
1192312	1192852	It was a while ago.
1193173	1196294	But that's because there hasn't been any games that have come out lately that have made me go, wow.
1196615	1202558	And I haven't had a good nerd party lately where people... Because, like, that was pretty much where my GameCube was getting the most use.
1202658	1206481	People come over, we play F-Zero, we play Smash Bros., we play Mario Party.
1206581	1208682	It's the greatest party console ever.
1209953	1211395	What's the oldest system that you own right now?
1213096	1213937	That still works?
1215659	1216860	Probably my Super Nintendo.
1216880	1217941	When was the last time you touched it?
1218341	1219082	Oh, it's in a box.
1220323	1221043	Because I don't need to.
1221144	1222004	I can emulate it.
1222164	1225387	But I emulated a Super Nintendo game last week.
1225688	1227429	But when did you pull your system out and play it?
1228030	1228630	Oh, ages ago.
1228670	1229351	Probably in college.
1229631	1233575	Okay, if you didn't have an emulator, would you pull out your SNES and play it?
1235288	1237529	I'm going to be honest, probably.
1238409	1240030	But not on a regular basis.
1240090	1242771	It would be one of those things where it's like, dude, remember Super Metroid?
1242811	1243611	Fuck yeah, let's play.
1243631	1245312	Because that's what emulators are kind of like.
1245332	1246432	But you wouldn't play it every day.
1246832	1246972	No.
1247253	1249313	You'd play it for a little bit and then you'd just put it away.
1249413	1249593	Yes.
1250474	1256996	And Dan and I own all these systems, but honestly, the last time we touched our TurboGrafx was a few months ago.
1257917	1261338	I haven't touched my own Super Nintendo that I moved out here with in a year.
1263033	1265834	Except when I moved it, when we moved into our house.
1266814	1270995	So, yeah, you keep it around, and the novel aspect is there.
1271075	1277077	Yeah, I'm going to go play my Nintendo, but are you going to have it hooked up as your primary system?
1277217	1277717	Hell no.
1278177	1283299	If it was the only thing you owned, would you still have found other things to do after three years had passed?
1286655	1288276	It would really depend on my scenario.
1288296	1299664	But on the other hand, if I didn't have the money to afford a new console and I could go to a garage sale or a flea market and buy Super Nintendo games for like two bucks a pop, I'd get a lot more life out of it.
1300545	1305028	But would you still play it more often if you could go out and do stuff instead?
1305345	1307766	It's hard to say, because I'm not in that situation.
1307806	1311327	Well, that's just the point of view I'm trying to point out, you know.
1311467	1311867	Understandable.
1311927	1322692	I had, you know, my Super Nintendo, I had for years, and after a couple years, even though, you know, I was still a big gamer, I still loved to play my Super Nintendo, I put more attention toward other things.
1323232	1331235	You know, that's just how I was with it, even though I loved to death, and I'd go through and have my, you know, massive three-hour games of Kirby's Avalanche, you know.
1332735	1334356	I think that's a pretty good, you know...
1336098	1338379	I thought that was a pretty neat point to bring up.
1339380	1345123	23rd Magus in our chatroom, by the way, would like to point out that your pet Shermie does not approve of the Poke the Kitten console.
1345984	1347645	I don't approve of the Poke the Kitten console.
1348465	1349226	I totally approve.
1349326	1359572	The next point on this, though... Well, see, it keeps bringing out, though, that, you know, that, yeah, you get it with slightly better graphics, but really aren't the games the same?
1359652	1361493	I thought that was a funny comparison, though, of...
1365033	1368834	Jet Goblins Attack in 1980, and The Legend of Zelda in 1987.
1369154	1373196	I'll show you.
1373956	1377557	You have orange box, yellow box, and of course we all know what Zelda looks like.
1378357	1387840	But it's really going into, a lot more of this article goes into how, oh, these systems are so great, but now you're getting just more of the same with everything released.
1387860	1389461	There's no new innovation, which is actually why I think
1390248	1399350	I don't know if you noticed how much bigger the crowds were at Nintendo than they were for Microsoft and Sony.
1400050	1403531	Well, a part of that I blame on Nintendo's design, though.
1403571	1406611	You could walk right into Sony's and play their console on Microsoft.
1406631	1408212	I mean, there's a whole variety.
1408232	1409872	And then you have the whole hype behind the Wii.
1410352	1412092	I don't know if I can relate it to this.
1412112	1415753	Did you see how much line they had anticipated getting at Sony?
1416840	1417300	That's true.
1418081	1420102	And they got maybe a third of that?
1420423	1424546	Well, here's the other thing, too, that all their consoles are playable at other booths.
1425527	1426467	That's a good point, too.
1426527	1430610	You could walk into Sega and play Full Auto 2 in the Sonic game.
1431031	1432712	So, that's a good point.
1435404	1437104	I would recommend giving this article a read.
1437144	1438965	It's a very well-written editorial.
1439105	1443506	It goes a lot more into detail about, you know, supporting proof.
1443686	1445246	You know, it gives actual numbers.
1445306	1446326	It gives actual information.
1446386	1448506	I thought that was very, very smart.
1448946	1452127	So I would say definitely go take a look.
1452147	1453087	Check it out, dudes.
1453647	1453967	Yeah.
1454447	1454907	And dudettes.
1455708	1460328	But I did like the whole, you know, bringing up the comparison there.
1461169	1463549	We got an email from Jay Vez.
1464656	1465597	We got another one from Ldriver.
1465617	1465737	Cool.
1480680	1480900	Yeah.
1482521	1485542	Just wanted to give you a shout and let you know how awesome your E3 coverage was.
1485602	1493586	Yours was my favorite, and it was cool to have you guys, all games, GamerAndy and BobbyBlackWolf, all on the same... I'm sorry, all on each other's shows.
1494187	1495407	You should try to do that more often.
1495567	1496067	Agreed.
1496288	1496868	It was fun.
1497368	1517492	I had a great it was a brilliant idea from the all games people to put us all under one roof the only unfortunate thing is is that again you had Gamer Andy who's based in the bay us who's based in Sacramento Scott and Lawrence who are based in LA and Bobby who's in Atlanta so it's you know that doesn't happen very often where everybody's in the same city except for something as massive as E3
1518377	1525822	Maybe Game Developers Conference next year because I could see us going to that and probably at least... I know Bobby flew out this year, so maybe something will happen again.
1526303	1526903	But who knows?
1527263	1531186	Oh, the guy from Chatterbox as well is in Arizona.
1531266	1532367	He was there for one of the shows too.
1534188	1536750	It's not very often everybody gets under one roof, but we thought it was a good time.
1537611	1541794	You know what I liked about it, too, was that there was no sense of competition.
1542135	1545978	Sure, we had the joking chat, oh, how many people you got listening, oh, how many people you got listening.
1545998	1557867	We kind of had that joke, but it was just kind of like we all realize that our shows are different because of who hosts it, and there's just different things that each show brings to the table, and we can all coexist.
1558207	1561390	People will gravitate to the host's
1562046	1568112	or hopefully multiple shows of the hosts that they seem to reflect their personality or the complete opposite.
1568132	1570134	Some people might listen to us because what we say pisses them off.
1570575	1570875	I don't know.
1571095	1574598	I thought it was great though that we could have such different points of view.
1575279	1577601	It was very nice to have new people to bounce off of.
1577882	1580404	I think one of the reasons I like the whole all games thing is because
1581625	1582346	I play Super High Impact.
1609285	1610085	That was it.
1610186	1610746	I know, I know.
1611126	1612626	I'm a Tecmo ball for life.
1612947	1614467	But L Driver has a question for us.
1614507	1614747	Sure.
1615408	1619789	My question is, who was the coolest industry person you met at the show?
1620470	1622630	Or who were you most excited about meeting or seeing?
1622671	1629373	I've heard people say nothing about, I'm sorry, say nothing about great things about Major Nelson and Trixie.
1629393	1633755	And I think it's telling Microsoft that people like working for them.
1634175	1636256	I don't see that on the Sony side, just a thought.
1637503	1641524	Rob took my photo with Igarashi Koji, who's the producer of the Castlevania games.
1661803	1663764	That's the one I met too that I thought was really exciting.
1663804	1668368	But honestly, I gotta be honest, nothing will beat Akira from two years ago.
1668388	1669329	Akira Yamaoka.
1669549	1670009	That was mine.
1672071	1672951	Hey, you met Koji Kondo.
1675033	1675273	Alright.
1677755	1679076	Loki, did you meet any industry people?
1679276	1684900	No, but I wish I had met I think it was like Steve Odedeck or whatever that was there.
1685100	1687642	I remember the guy did Kung Pao.
1687862	1689483	He apparently was walking around in E3.
1689744	1690324	So I was like,
1690959	1695146	I'm cool to meet him because I gotta punch him in the face and say, Make goddamn Kung Pao 2!
1695547	1697210	Because I need to see the movie now!
1698071	1698993	Get off your ass!
1699113	1703360	Stop wasting your time with Barnyard and those other crappy animated movies.
1703581	1704522	I want Kung Pao 2!
1706281	1711525	I gotta be honest, though, I try not to be fanboy at E3 because it's supposed to be, you know, a professional thing.
1711565	1714627	So I don't run up to people and go, OMG, I'm your biggest fan.
1714927	1725195	But, you know, in the case of, you know, the guy, Igarashi, you know, it's just kind of, the way we just kind of talked to him was like, hey, you know, we wanted to actually just tell him about our show in hopes that we could get him on.
1725715	1728217	But, you know, and, you know, take a picture while we're at it for the website.
1728257	1728537	Why not?
1728898	1729038	Fun.
1730439	1732020	Yeah, we're gonna cut out the part with me in it.
1732380	1732840	No, stop.
1733241	1733341	Um...
1734483	1735947	Also, I got an email.
1736067	1740738	We've been picked for Podzinger, our podcast of the week.
1741439	1742482	Yay, Podzinger.
1743120	1746061	Yeah, so everyone should go to Podzinger.com.
1746361	1747381	Go check it out.
1747481	1755162	The other cool thing about Podzinger and part of what sets them apart from other podcast search engines is that they actually will break down what we say.
1755402	1760603	It somehow converts our MP3 into text.
1760623	1767085	You can't actually read it, but if you do search, you'll actually see Podzinger try to read the sentence as we spoke it.
1767145	1768805	It's really weird technology, but it's cool.
1769225	1771827	So you can actually search for words in podcasts.
1771847	1772868	So I think that's kind of neat.
1772888	1773689	So thank you, Podsinger.
1773809	1774229	Appreciate it.
1774609	1779453	Our last one comes from Nintendomaniac64, who has a question for us.
1780774	1791242	So it was, I was wondering if there was a way of taking an AGP or PCI port out of a PC and hooking it up to a laptop via internally or externally so that I could use a decent video card.
1792563	1793584	No idea, Loki.
1793924	1794585	I have no idea.
1794765	1794905	What?
1797196	1797796	Pay attention!
1797816	1797936	Fired!
1797956	1798997	Sorry, I was reading something.
1799017	1805441	You should take an AGP or PCI port out of a PC and hook it up to a laptop to use a better video card.
1806582	1808043	You're not going to probably be able to do that.
1808103	1811045	Because laptops, a lot of times, they have PCI Express.
1811205	1813546	Well, especially the recent ones, they have PCI Express cards.
1814427	1817589	And I'm not sure if there are their own versions of them.
1818029	1823753	Like, my laptop right now has a ATI Mobility Radeon X600.
1823953	1824413	So it's kind of a
1826119	1827120	My laptop plays games just fine.
1853431	1854152	Alienware does make a...
1872145	1873665	Well, yeah, buy a Mac if you want good graphics.
1873685	1874146	Yeah, just get a Mac.
1874706	1875366	Sorry, Loki.
1875646	1876966	I know how you feel, but honestly.
1877026	1878367	Did you see the stuff for the new MacBook?
1878847	1879527	Isn't it hot?
1880087	1881187	I gotta take it back to gaming.
1881207	1881968	We gotta keep it going.
1882248	1883028	MacBook Pro.
1883048	1886229	Well, if you're taking it back to gaming, then obviously Mac is the wrong way to go there.
1886249	1886789	Shut up.
1887469	1888169	Oh, sorry.
1888189	1888969	I dropped my mic.
1888989	1890530	Oh, I've done to my computer.
1890650	1890930	Damn it.
1891690	1894951	You know, I'll be playing World of Warcraft on my Mac.
1896833	1898294	and I'll be playing Ragnarok online.
1898414	1900796	Alright, look, shut up.
1900956	1907480	If you want to email us, add to the mailbag for next week, yell at Loki for his Matt Cate mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is the address.
1908421	1920529	Moving on, I gotta mention this because we have a lot of folks who love the music games and by the way, we have a video coming to the website tonight of some of the new DDR games, so some of you kids can see the interface, so check that out.
1920569	1922930	But Rez, hugely popular game.
1923010	1923751	Rez, Rez, Rez.
1924511	1931836	In an interview with Eurogamer, the creator of Rez spoke about the possibilities of a sequel to Rez.
1932777	1940101	Basically, he says that he is looking at the next generation possibilities and trying to do a Rez kind of experience.
1940241	1945264	If Sega were to approach him to make a Rez sequel, he is currently seriously considering it.
1945625	1946405	It's always there.
1946505	1947966	I'm always thinking about it.
1948306	1974573	so it's kind of interesting to think about which system would it be on would it be on like the Wii where you could move it around or would it be on like the 360 where you could do like updates or would it be on the PlayStation 3 which is supposed to have the true high definition who knows who knows but I believe Rez was originally a Dreamcast game and just brought over to the PlayStation 2 right that's right yeah that's exciting though I really hope that happens and while we're at it how about more Space Channel 5 please thank you
1975888	1976308	Loki!
1976588	1978349	Got some news on Pac-Man.
1978669	1979509	Pac-Man World Rally.
1979609	1985090	And I did play this game, and it's actually a complete rip-off of Mario Kart.
1985710	1999813	So anyways, Namco mentioned that all versions of their upcoming game on all the different consoles will feature as an unlockable character the Prince of All Cosmos from the Katamari series.
2000473	2003094	And how you unlock this character, you may ask?
2003479	2010340	by winning the gold trophy in all the circuit cups with the easy difficulty setting, which makes me believe there's more characters.
2011580	2014381	Not a surprise at all, though, that the prince is hidden in there.
2014421	2017721	I mean, they've got to milk the Katamari franchise if there's not going to be any games.
2018101	2019702	The hard difficulty, you may ask?
2020122	2022862	Hard difficulty, you get to drive as the king's package.
2023802	2024082	Shut up.
2024102	2026683	I think on the hard difficulty, you should drive a Katamari and roll over everybody.
2027263	2027943	Now, that would be fun.
2028223	2031504	You know, that racing level in We Heart Katamari was like the best thing ever.
2031744	2032764	I love the racing level.
2033755	2034636	That and the fire level.
2037258	2041402	DarkSakura, another sequel possibly in the works?
2041982	2043604	Oh, this makes my heart happy.
2045065	2050570	There was a bit of conversation heard at the Sony party.
2052171	2060759	Yuji Naka apparently was basically on some, I guess, impromptu interview was admitting that there's a new Knights game in development.
2061823	2062243	Cool.
2062643	2064084	It's about freaking time.
2065124	2068445	Just please don't let the controls suck like Sonic PS3.
2069825	2072406	Dude, Sonic PS3 just hurt my heart.
2073106	2073326	I know.
2073626	2076347	You know, it got my worst game of E3.
2076467	2077387	I know, I know.
2079447	2080388	And that's saying something.
2081148	2083528	Because that Family Feud game was god-awful.
2083588	2084409	I wouldn't play that.
2086590	2087470	I don't play set games.
2087671	2093994	I think this is interesting is that HAL is actually taking suggestions.
2094354	2106860	They've actually put up a consumer survey on Nintendo of Japan's website and the poll is designed to let gamers help select what type of characters should be in the next Super Smash Brothers.
2106920	2111822	Of course, fanboys everywhere wet their pants when they saw that Pit and Snake were going to be in the next Super Smash Brothers.
2112142	2113503	Is there a character that you think
2114764	2115385	We need Eggplant Wizard.
2115405	2115505	Hmm.
2144725	2146667	I think Eggplant Wizard would be pretty rockin' too.
2147667	2149909	Gosh, I'm really kind of stretched for ideas.
2149969	2150889	Mother Brain playable.
2151470	2153331	That's weird.
2154091	2155792	Now, Kraid might be cool.
2156172	2156953	Or like one of the baddies.
2156973	2158234	You can play as a Metroid.
2160815	2161155	I don't know.
2161856	2163217	It seems like they've done a lot of good ones.
2163277	2166299	I guess, you know, I'm glad they're just going back to Kid Icarus, honestly.
2168260	2171642	But I've heard rumors, rumblings, that...
2172386	2174807	Final Fantasy characters are supposed to make an appearance as well.
2174927	2177129	But again, that's like a big old grain of salt.
2177149	2179050	I think that sounds like more of a fanboy thing to me.
2179610	2180030	But I don't know.
2180070	2180370	We'll see.
2181911	2190176	Well, after all, I mean, they did have DreamXTV World Fighters with all the Konami characters in there, including Snake.
2190696	2192937	So why not add some of those characters?
2193097	2198080	In which case, they would have had... Was it Simon Belmont?
2198720	2199201	And I remember...
2200137	2205819	from, like, Hudson, since now Konami seems to publish all the Hudson games, Bomberman.
2207520	2212442	They even had, oh, God, Yugo from, what was it?
2214082	2215143	God, I can't remember the game now.
2215243	2215723	The crappy...
2217554	2223537	I gotta go over the chat room because they've seen some great stuff right now.
2223597	2227339	Jeremy Todd 1 wants to point out you can always Google translate the website.
2227399	2227780	Good point.
2228120	2229601	And they're sharing some great ideas.
2229681	2230941	Bobby Blackwolf says K.K.
2231001	2232702	Slider could be a character.
2233442	2234823	DMN says Little Mac.
2236564	2238005	O2G says King Hippo.
2238925	2239606	That's a good idea.
2240646	2241967	Spirit Stare says Reggie.
2245430	2246090	and Reni.
2246330	2247211	I love this idea.
2247291	2248131	A Tetris piece.
2249732	2250332	That would be funny.
2250392	2251033	And Spirit Snare.
2251073	2251573	I mean, why not?
2251613	2252493	You have Mr. Game & Watch.
2252774	2254975	Spirit Snare also suggests the dog from Duck Hunt.
2257776	2259217	Okay.
2259517	2261398	Who hasn't wanted to kick that dog's ass?
2261558	2263759	We're getting a dog though in Duck Hunt, aren't we?
2265420	2266640	But in the Smash Brothers.
2266680	2267621	Can you imagine playing the dog?
2267881	2268821	I want to kick that thing's ass.
2268841	2271783	Here are some of the ones that they had from DreamXTV.
2272643	2273083	Twinbee.
2273103	2273183	Yes.
2274304	2274584	Yes.
2275815	2282558	They also had Amoy Head from Gradius, which I thought was pretty interesting.
2282918	2284359	Solid Snake, of course, was there.
2285299	2287981	They also had Simon Belmont.
2288021	2289641	These are all Konami.
2289761	2291222	Yeah, those were all Konami ones.
2291802	2293523	So I think it's pretty cool.
2295197	2296658	S&K, who I have a lot of love for.
2296678	2302039	Basically, it was confirmed by S&K USA's president that they are going to try to get stuff out on the Wii.
2324176	2328699	They have a game for the Wii already in progress.
2332922	2335443	Basically they're saying they think Sony will do very well.
2335483	2337285	They're saying Xbox 360 will do very well.
2337785	2339866	And they're saying Xbox 360 is doing well over here.
2340727	2346791	But it seems to me like they're really looking toward the Wii.
2347191	2351634	And if Loki's list from Part A is to be believed, then Metal Slug Anthology is that game they're working on.
2352233	2357978	SNK previously announced a Metal Slug Anthology Wii game will use the new controller.
2358398	2362562	They're also working a sixth game in the Metal Slug series.
2363102	2366345	It won't necessarily show up on all of the consoles.
2366365	2372630	They're saying it is a 2D game, so they're not bringing it to the PS3 or Xbox 360 as it is.
2372811	2376113	And you can guarantee that it's not going to be any different than the other five.
2376394	2376754	Hey!
2377588	2380050	The other games had different stuff in them when they kept releasing them.
2380350	2384573	There were new characters, there were new attacks, and you had mummies.
2384773	2385153	Hey!
2385954	2390077	You know, SNK knows when they have a winner.
2390257	2391798	I'm not going to knock Metal Slug.
2392058	2393439	It is fun, and that's what's important.
2393659	2395521	They have a working formula.
2395941	2400364	They add just enough stuff to make it a little different for whoever's playing it.
2400785	2404927	I really think that if you've got something that works, if you have something that fans like, don't fuck with it.
2405288	2405548	You know?
2406772	2407392	Well said.
2408752	2409092	All right.
2410373	2411073	Moving on.
2411833	2424236	If you're downloading a lot of crap from E3, as I'm sure you guys are, beware, guys, because if you're not downloading your stuff from a trusted website, then you might actually get some spyware hidden in there.
2424336	2424716	Guess what?
2424796	2429817	Spyware folks and the people that do that, in fact, one in particular is called Spy Falcon.
2430637	2436538	There's a report running on gamesarefun.com where somebody actually got this bug in there downloading E3 coverage.
2436858	2443120	So I guess the spyware people are smartening up here and putting this stuff into, I guess, E3 videos or whatever.
2443761	2450563	So please, guys, make sure you download all your E3 coverage from E3OnPSP.com because it's the only site we can trust.
2451323	2453424	Unfortunately, everybody else puts crap in there.
2453944	2460887	By the way, Macintosh folks, if you think you're safe just because you run on Mac, Spy Falcon knows how to get into your Mac too, so watch out.
2463871	2465072	Spyware pisses me off.
2465112	2466092	I don't know about the rest of you.
2466112	2467733	Does spyware piss you off, DarkSakura?
2468914	2471255	Does it piss you off enough to want to do the FUs of the week?
2471536	2471716	Sure.
2471996	2473217	I hope so, because that's what's queued up.
2487485	2492368	FU to a person whose name I will not say.
2493843	2502324	who decided to pug me out the last day of E3 and act like an absolute child and involve himself in something that didn't involve him.
2502845	2508005	Yeah, when two people have a fight and they've resolved it, don't get emo over it.
2508166	2509266	Stay the fuck out of it.
2509826	2510966	Pardon me for saying so.
2512326	2514567	Other people's drama does not have to be your drama.
2514647	2516027	Only children do that, okay?
2516407	2519587	So grow up and get over it and get your shoes out of my car.
2521048	2521408	I'm done.
2523195	2544734	Uh, Loki, um, fuck you to whoever is behind ruining G4, because, you know, I guess I'm the last one on the face of the earth to realize that G4 is no longer a gaming network, and, you know, after, you know, browsing their section to find, oh, look, there's nine hours of non-gaming programming on there.
2545314	2549598	Whatever, okay, so I'm a little behind the game, but mainly fucking ruining X-Play.
2550974	2561326	I don't know if they've gotten lazy or what, but their review of Beatmania just pissed me off with the whole lack of knowledge in the game and just basically saying, well, it's not this game, so it gets a 2 or whatever.
2561406	2564390	So, fuck them for being lazy now.
2564410	2567193	Made the whole network burn to hell.
2567213	2567554	I don't know.
2570585	2571446	Uh, my F.U.
2571506	2573868	of the week goes to Jelly Bellies.
2574568	2580433	Because, for one, they're really addicting, and, like, they're hella good and make me fat, but that's not why I'm giving them the F.U.
2580493	2581313	I'm giving them the F.U.
2581353	2589419	because I bought this thing at the Jelly Bellies store, and it's the Hot Buttered Popcorn, and it's this case, and Buttered Popcorn Jelly Bellies are my favorite.
2589440	2590480	They're so good.
2590740	2594543	And I know a lot of people think they're gross, but you suck, because Buttered Popcorn is the best.
2595024	2595244	Actually...
2595842	2597303	Next to Toasted Marshmallow.
2597823	2598763	Buttered popcorn is the best.
2599204	2602245	And this is the thing, I bought this because it was on sale for $5.
2602285	2604686	And I'm like, cool, that's a lot of buttered popcorn jelly beans.
2605007	2607528	And it was like filling up here with all these jelly beans.
2607908	2609689	Well, I come home and I open it.
2610365	2614048	And the damn thing is filled almost to the brim with styrofoam.
2614528	2619012	There was only a handful of buttered popcorn jelly beans to fill out the top of that thing.
2619052	2620273	I realize we're not on TV.
2620293	2621053	You can't see that.
2621494	2626698	But like an inch of that was filled with jelly beans to give the illusion.
2626798	2627618	And you know what?
2627738	2629780	I should have known when I picked the damn thing up.
2630100	2634461	That it didn't feel full, but I guess, I don't know, because the styrofoam's in there, it feels weighted.
2634481	2635902	That's pretty false advertising right there.
2635962	2636962	Oh, that pissed me off.
2637002	2638142	No wonder it was discounted.
2638583	2643784	It was five, so for five bucks I got a handful of jelly beans in this useless fucking tin I will never do anything with.
2643864	2644224	You know what?
2644244	2646225	But look at it every day to remind me how much I hate it.
2646245	2647705	We'll fill it with Jelly Bellies for you.
2648065	2648605	Hooray!
2649086	2650806	No, don't do that, because Jelly Bellies make me fat.
2651586	2654727	No, Jelly Bellies don't make you fat, it's eating the Jelly Bellies that makes you fat.
2654967	2656128	Which is your decision.
2656788	2656948	Alright.
2661068	2662409	Ew, gross, DT.
2662930	2663150	What?
2663470	2665051	Bringing up freaking super bacon.
2665091	2665712	Disgusting.
2665732	2667033	They have bacon jelly bellies.
2667073	2667673	Can you believe that?
2667733	2668474	That's nasty.
2668534	2671816	Although I almost bought wild blackberry jelly bellies at the Winchester Mystery House.
2671836	2672577	That's nasty.
2672937	2674238	But coconut's my favorite.
2674538	2675098	All right, Loki.
2676055	2677637	Who's also a Jelly Belly eater, right?
2677958	2678879	I don't like Jelly Bellies.
2678939	2679219	Really?
2679620	2681022	I don't really like Jelly Beans anymore.
2681042	2685007	I used to eat them as a kid, but, you know, I'm just not really a huge fan of Jelly Beans anymore.
2685748	2687991	Anyways, um... Naughty people at E3!
2688392	2689413	Naughty, naughty people!
2689734	2693279	Fucking... Hey, dude, seriously, um... NCSoft, they have the...
2693863	2694764	Thank you for watching.
2694784	2695464	See you next time.
2710915	2711735	I think you did.
2711975	2712536	No, I did not.
2712556	2713756	I'm going to go back and play.
2713796	2716838	I could almost swear you named Sega your booth at the show.
2716938	2717158	Why?
2717318	2719540	Because it had Full Auto 2 and stuff.
2719840	2722081	I'm almost positive you named Sega your booth at the show.
2722121	2722822	I didn't really care.
2722842	2723963	No, I said Capcom had good 360 games.
2724023	2724463	Oh, whatever.
2724503	2724683	Whatever.
2724743	2734069	Anyway, so like little whiny bitches, they went and complained to the E3 management who, I don't even know how the hell you can determine that a, you know,
2734949	2736010	A booth is too noisy.
2736050	2737810	Apparently they registered the decibels.
2737850	2742773	It was two decibels above, you know, where it should be, so they had to pay $5,000 for that.
2742953	2748215	So, you know, NCSoft said, fuck it, who cares, we're going to play our music as loud as we want.
2749576	2752798	And they did that, so... Yes.
2752898	2754038	Rock on, you guys.
2754058	2759301	Yeah, Sega gets my whiny pussy of E3 awards, so... Way to go.
2761302	2761982	Alright, um...
2764170	2766593	Sony, changing gears completely here.
2767314	2774564	Sony, this is interesting because if you think about the PSP, they have tried to prevent homebrew so many times.
2774905	2777007	They keep patching the damn thing over and over and they won't give up.
2777368	2781253	But yet they are embracing homebrew on the PlayStation 3.
2782935	2790620	The system development manager, Izumi Kwanishi, says that the console is going to ship with Linux built-in, so you don't have to bother to figure out how to install it.
2790640	2797525	It's going to be already installed on there, and Sony is saying, hey, homebrew folks, go ahead and develop for this.
2797585	2798245	This would be awesome.
2798585	2805070	By the way, Sony will not be providing technical support or access to SDK libraries, but Linux support is there.
2806360	2809182	That's a very strange policy when you consider the PSP.
2809202	2812284	I'm glad that they put a free operating system on their hard drives.
2812584	2814205	How very thoughtful of them.
2816646	2819268	But you know what will be interesting about this?
2821609	2822750	I just thought of this just now.
2824751	2829434	In a roundabout way, could this just be a big F you to the virtual console?
2829794	2831975	Because just run a Linux emulator.
2832596	2834277	There you got all the old school games you want.
2835330	2844434	If somebody perfects their Linux emulator, like NES emulator, for the PlayStation, did you think maybe Sony had this forethought when they saw that people were making this on the PSP?
2844774	2847195	No, because they had Linux on PlayStation 2 as well.
2847355	2849896	Don't you think Sony kind of realizes this is what's going to happen?
2849936	2851296	People are going to make emulators on this?
2852197	2852597	Probably.
2853697	2853957	Hmm.
2855358	2856218	They're little bitches.
2856558	2857679	That's what it comes down to.
2858871	2859811	Fucking little wine bitch.
2860072	2861392	But here's the thing, Sony.
2861432	2864934	People gotta buy your console before they can program emulators for it.
2865134	2866575	It's a win-win situation for Sony.
2868116	2869296	Yeah, they gotta buy them first.
2869737	2870457	That's the problem, though.
2870617	2874339	That is the major problem, is getting people to buy your console.
2874379	2875219	People will buy it.
2876680	2878381	Alright, uh, Loki.
2879742	2882083	How about that Nintendo Wii?
2882223	2883463	Does that have Linux on it?
2884084	2885364	No, it doesn't have Linux on it.
2886105	2886325	But,
2887388	2892389	Um, apparently the E3 ones were running off of quasi-GameCube hardware.
2892589	2896390	Basically, they were housed in GameCubes and stuff, which is not surprising.
2896410	2898271	I mean, it's a fucking dev kit it's running off of.
2898291	2901491	Of course it's gonna be, you know, it's sort of based on the GameCube anyway.
2901511	2902912	It's not really a big surprise.
2903032	2906132	I don't get why this is such a huge uproar in the community right now.
2906192	2908513	Like, OMG, the Wii was running off of GameCubes.
2908653	2908813	Well...
2910276	2911317	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2927051	2927551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2951653	2956298	BlackWolf liked to clarify the hardware was Wii, the box it was housed in was just a GameCube.
2956478	2957419	Okay, makes sense.
2958300	2960001	But why is this a problem?
2960041	2961823	Why are people blogging about this?
2961843	2962644	Who cares anyways?
2962684	2963985	It's a giant fucking case.
2964025	2967048	It could be the size of a giraffe.
2967148	2967709	It wouldn't matter.
2967889	2969510	And of course it wasn't GameCube hardware.
2969530	2971012	Their games were actually widescreen.
2972890	2977491	GameCube never really... I mean, there's a couple games on GameCube that'll do widescreen, but shit, hardly any.
2978191	2981312	And of course, now our chatroom, www.orange.com, click on chat.
2981332	2985654	They're just going off on the Linux thing, and they're talking about everything you can install Linux on.
2986614	2988474	DJ PooEater says, Linux on a jelly belly.
2988954	2989335	Bastard.
2990015	2992055	Hey, they put Linux on a toaster.
2992095	2992475	Why not?
2992575	2994116	And Roz says, Linux on a plane.
2995436	2995716	Uh-huh.
2995916	2996116	Uh-huh.
2996316	2996577	Uh-huh.
2996757	2997157	Uh-huh.
2999631	3000852	I'll make the joke first.
3001232	3003133	Linux on Ridge Racer.
3003333	3004694	There's actually somebody already beat you to that.
3004794	3005155	Damn it!
3005835	3006916	Linux in Africa.
3007956	3008457	Africa.
3008697	3009097	Africa.
3009557	3012559	With a K. Africa with a K. Linux 2, Linux in Africa.
3012920	3014461	What the hell was Africa?
3015361	3016082	We don't know.
3016102	3017703	It was a monstrous digging up dirt game.
3018763	3020865	I'm hoping it's Pokemon Snap, but in Africa.
3021225	3024527	I hope it's like, you know, Big Game Hunter, you know, Poacher.
3024667	3025568	You are messed up.
3026168	3026989	Big Game Poacher.
3027819	3028400	Rhino Hunter.
3029881	3032163	Moving on, now let's talk about Xbox 360.
3032264	3036007	Rumors abound that the Xbox 360 is going to get a Final Fantasy title as well.
3036708	3049541	The 360 is supposedly going to get one of the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII, because you know it's a series here, is that there's two of them on the PlayStation 3, and then one of them on the mobile phone.
3051300	3052881	Well, here's the interesting thing.
3052941	3057885	Supposedly, they've actually even trademarked a new name with Final Fantasy XIII.
3058185	3058466	What?
3059146	3062929	So that there's another sub-game that might be out on the 360.
3063009	3063529	What?
3064010	3064330	I know.
3064470	3065131	Isn't that crazy?
3065951	3066372	God.
3067352	3067913	Release one.
3067953	3068774	Here's Squeenix.
3070011	3070893	What the hell?
3071153	3071714	I know.
3072055	3073377	I don't... Oh my god.
3073437	3073958	It's weird.
3074018	3078045	I don't... You know, we don't know enough about the series yet to know if this is justifiable or not.
3078085	3081090	Well, I know the mobile game is not going to be justifiable under any circumstances.
3081110	3081871	Gotta buy them all.
3082052	3082212	But...
3084042	3086703	But I'm curious to see what is in the works of the other ones.
3086943	3096526	Again, the 360 thing is just a rumor at this stage, you guys, and sounds like it might be a little bit of hopeful MSFanboy thinking, but at the same time, it's not impossible.
3096646	3097586	Final Fantasy XI's on 360.
3097906	3100647	I heard that it might be on the live arcade.
3101628	3102848	That would be very interesting.
3102948	3105729	Why don't you support the phone game to the live arcade or something?
3105749	3106449	Make it better.
3106909	3107789	That's a better idea.
3108470	3112491	Why don't they just create Ironhander 2 instead?
3113775	3114336	DarkSakura,
3132333	3134715	But make sure you have good reception, because I hate it when we get bad sales.
3135015	3141100	But the better way to call on the show is to use the Skype line, and that is Skype username OrangeLoungeRadio.
3141841	3143903	We're going to be opening up right after this story.
3143963	3144223	Loki.
3144483	3147846	And be sure to also call Echo123 first.
3147866	3150328	Yes, call Echo123 first if you're using Skype.
3151969	3152310	Anyways.
3153371	3153611	So.
3156513	3157474	Speaking of games coming out.
3158972	3165558	Capcom saying that they're going to have both Resident Evil 5 and Devil May Cry 4 playable at Tokyo Game Show this year.
3166138	3167159	So that's excellent.
3167339	3168140	We'll get to see that.
3169621	3174746	Hey, that's just in time for the PlayStation 3 launch in a few months afterwards.
3175186	3176988	But I'm sure those aren't going to be launch titles.
3179390	3180111	But hey, more games!
3180431	3181152	Can't knock that.
3181472	3181812	You know what?
3181832	3183113	I was really impressed with their games.
3184771	3187053	Lost Planet, and Dead Rising is here.
3187633	3189074	That Dead Rising game sounds hella fun.
3189114	3189655	I'm sad I missed it.
3189675	3190435	More power to it.
3190495	3192116	I heard other podcasts talking about it.
3192136	3194418	Dead Rising is really fun.
3195739	3197320	Definitely got to check it out.
3197520	3199742	It lived up to my expectations of it.
3201423	3201803	I can't wait.
3203564	3209087	All right, our Skype line is open over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
3209868	3211168	You can call us right now.
3211208	3215831	The username is OrangeloungeRadio, or you can pick up the phone and call 916-226-9067.
3216131	3220054	We do have voicemail on there, so you can call any time during the week and leave us a voicemail if you want.
3221414	3222695	But if you don't, I'm not going to force you.
3223736	3224796	Hi, you're on OrangeloungeRadio.
3225697	3227238	Hi, this is RavensDolphin.
3227358	3228859	Hello, RavensDolphin, what's on your mind?
3230139	3232701	Well, the all-game thing...
3233635	3234376	The All Games thing?
3250222	3254385	What did you think of Alon from Chatterbox Game Show?
3271693	3275235	Yeah, but he came off of an asshole, but I listen to his show every day.
3275815	3277856	But I didn't know how he came out like that.
3278756	3282398	You know, sometimes people just have... I'm going to be bluntly honest.
3282758	3288300	I've had very little time to listen to other podcasts, and his is one of them that's on my... I want to listen to it, but I haven't yet.
3288641	3293583	But remember that sometimes people come off on the radio a lot different than they do in real life.
3293963	3296284	Like, if you ever watched that movie about Howard Stern...
3296724	3297245	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3315159	3316140	It didn't sound too good.
3316340	3319282	He seemed like he was aggravated to death.
3319642	3321683	Well, I got to shift this topic, guy.
3321703	3323764	We don't want to knock other podcasts, especially independent.
3323784	3324905	No, no, I'm not knocking them.
3325065	3325365	All right.
3325705	3325925	All right.
3325965	3326806	Well, what else is on your mind?
3329207	3329607	Let's see.
3329707	3330608	What else is on my mind?
3330668	3332149	The PSPs, WTF.
3333289	3334510	Oh, God, that game was great.
3335785	3339466	Yeah, there's a lot of MarioWare minigames coming out.
3339486	3341046	I cut the bunnies very much.
3341086	3342146	You know what's really sad, though?
3342166	3343706	It's not going to be named WTF.
3343926	3344426	Why?
3344546	3345647	You've got to put it in our system.
3345687	3347027	It's WFF now.
3347067	3347347	Watch.
3347747	3348627	Work for fun.
3349327	3349947	Aw, lame.
3349967	3350447	I know.
3350548	3351328	It's retarded.
3351588	3352448	Freaking Americans.
3353668	3357049	I wanted WTF so I can say I got what the fuck.
3359269	3359669	All right.
3361689	3362650	Anything else you want to share?
3364170	3364650	Yeah.
3364830	3365110	All right.
3366764	3370366	Well, do you... No, I'm just going to hang up.
3370866	3371246	All right.
3371966	3372667	Have a good one, buddy.
3373147	3373387	Bye.
3373567	3374187	Ridge Racer.
3376048	3376948	Please let us die.
3376968	3378089	No, it says it in his bio.
3378109	3378949	It says Ridge Racer.
3380550	3381010	Couldn't resist.
3381050	3382131	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3383771	3385772	As much as I cost, you get my own theme song.
3386913	3388473	La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
3388573	3389034	There you go.
3390234	3393856	We had somebody sing our FU theme, so you get your theme song sung.
3393896	3394236	What's up?
3395120	3396481	Not much, it's the one and only Ranma.
3396501	3397842	How are you guys doing?
3397902	3398542	Good, Ranma.
3398562	3399463	He's my cosplay buddy.
3401824	3405407	Why aren't you coming to Faname?
3405427	3405407	2007.
3405667	3406647	Alright, fair enough.
3407008	3407808	What's on your mind?
3408148	3409029	What are you calling about tonight?
3409529	3410069	A couple things.
3410090	3412431	First of all, I want to say congratulations for Loki for getting married.
3413712	3414052	Thank you.
3415513	3416794	May the gods have mercy on your soul.
3419415	3420356	She's a nice girl.
3420416	3421797	She hates games, but she's a nice girl.
3423177	3424838	Actually, she's not a nice girl, but she's funny.
3425118	3426880	That's what makes it worth it.
3427760	3428521	Good enough, good enough.
3429061	3429342	All right.
3429602	3431423	Do you have anything game-related you want to ask about?
3431443	3433224	I have a couple of things.
3433284	3433565	All right.
3434045	3438969	I was at Nintendo World for E3 2006 press conference, and I have tons of pictures to that.
3439349	3440170	Ooh, where are they going to be at?
3441070	3442912	On my website that I'm posting right now.
3444293	3446814	In the chat room there, it looks like DJRanmaS.net.
3447395	3448896	Follow the linky links once you get in there.
3449952	3451353	Yes, and it was pretty awesome.
3451593	3455735	After the whole presentation, they had like a party to celebrate the one year anniversary.
3455956	3458157	Then they had like a nice VIP party at the end.
3459478	3459778	Cool.
3461019	3465721	And I have more pictures of me at Nintendo World meeting Reggie Phil's aims.
3466402	3473546	Actually, wait, before we get into you meeting Reggie, did the catering at the Nintendo party have those potato things with bacon and cheddar in them?
3474497	3481722	No, all we had was like quote-unquote like phony like alcoholic drinks, but they were just regular soda and crap like that.
3481782	3483823	Okay, because E3 Outpost had the potato things.
3483863	3484964	He was at the Nintendo party?
3485004	3485404	Delicious.
3486224	3489006	No, he was at the store on the East Coast.
3489647	3493489	Like you know how at E3 Outpost we had like a viewing party that was like all the podcasters watching it?
3493849	3495851	That was what they did, but at the store.
3497351	3500914	They had like these mini tacos, quesadillas, and mini hamburgers and stuff.
3500994	3502134	Enough about food.
3502154	3502755	Tell us about Reggie.
3504369	3506110	I asked him why.
3506750	3507710	I asked him.
3508991	3510811	He's like, we is everything.
3510951	3512112	We is all about us.
3512172	3513352	We is awesome.
3513892	3515833	I think I wanted to smack him for saying that.
3516553	3517673	We is awesome.
3518674	3518954	Yes.
3521875	3522355	You know what?
3522395	3523815	That's a really odd response.
3523855	3525876	That sounds like a textbook response to me.
3525956	3532018	Like in the FAQs for a PR person, here's what to say when asked this question.
3533666	3535688	Did it sound a little textbook to you when he said it?
3536549	3537930	Very much so.
3539151	3539431	Hmm.
3539832	3540152	All right.
3541353	3543495	Anything else you want to share about your experiences there at the store?
3544236	3545617	No, it was pretty much fun.
3545737	3553144	It was crowded, and I could have heard people crapping their pants after seeing the whole presentation, especially for me for seeing Starbucks.
3553164	3553624	Oh, God.
3553745	3559410	Put all those Nintendo fanboys under one roof, and it must have just smelled awful by the time it was over.
3560410	3561911	Oh, Lord, you have no idea.
3562251	3563232	All right.
3563752	3566594	Even us at the Outpost were kind of going, ooh, ah, interesting.
3566634	3570457	And when the Star Fox thing came up, we were like, damn, neat, cool.
3570957	3573078	All right, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get more calls in, okay?
3573659	3574019	Take care.
3574059	3574739	Have a good one, buddy.
3574759	3576360	Tell Reggie we said hi next time.
3576921	3577421	That I will.
3577541	3578121	Love the hair.
3578322	3578562	All right.
3578642	3578902	All right.
3580589	3581349	Let's go to another call.
3581850	3583130	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3583150	3583531	Who's this?
3584051	3585032	This is DMN.
3585112	3586112	Hello, DMN.
3586152	3586713	What's on your mind?
3586753	3589994	Well, first of all, exclusive announcement.
3590335	3590635	Okay.
3591515	3594117	They're going to remake Portal Runner on the DS.
3594537	3595077	Just kidding.
3595498	3595818	Oops.
3596378	3596698	Nerd.
3601401	3606504	I was calling... Crap, I completely lost my train of thought.
3607386	3607746	That's right.
3607766	3610287	We do that all the time in hosting the show.
3614008	3614588	Take a moment.
3614628	3615329	Collect your thoughts.
3615469	3615689	What?
3616549	3617609	I completely drew a blank.
3618109	3618650	I apologize.
3618870	3619390	Take a moment.
3619410	3620770	We take a moment to meditate.
3621050	3621991	Work on your brain there.
3622051	3622851	Collect your thoughts.
3623111	3626712	Okay.
3626732	3627492	Did you think of it yet?
3627973	3628293	All right.
3628333	3629573	Well, call us back when you think of it.
3630273	3630653	All right.
3630693	3631194	Sorry.
3631234	3631874	That's all right.
3631934	3632194	Bye.
3634252	3635014	Live radio, kids.
3635194	3635775	We tape live.
3635995	3636717	Let's go to this call.
3636737	3637859	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3637879	3638260	Who's this?
3639382	3640043	Hi, Sky.
3640063	3640925	This is Spirit Snare.
3641085	3641907	Hi, Spirit Snare.
3641927	3642448	What's on your mind?
3644069	3645390	Nothing much.
3645490	3651672	First off, am I the only one in the chat who's going to stand in base?
3652052	3664197	You know, I guess so, because a lot of our chatters are from all around, and they're all too cheap to travel or can't afford it or whatever, so you might be the only... I hope we have more than one person that shows up at the panel, though, or I'll be sad.
3666398	3668138	So you've got to help us advertise.
3668198	3669259	Get word out at the con.
3670860	3673703	DarkSakura, what kind of chocolate do you like most?
3673723	3675124	Because I need to give you that at a
3700413	3701794	I think you said, what chocolate?
3701834	3702434	Is that what you asked?
3702614	3703335	What chocolate?
3705876	3706576	You broke up there.
3706976	3707617	Was that the question?
3707657	3708277	What chocolate?
3709578	3711959	No, what kind of chocolate do you like best?
3712719	3715921	Because remember a couple episodes ago you were saying they have to... Right, I said chocolate.
3715941	3717102	There you go.
3717202	3722184	I am a big fan of dark chocolate, especially anything that's 75% cocoa.
3723445	3724205	What kind of brands?
3724305	3724685	Give a hint.
3725666	3727767	Drost, Lindt.
3728717	3730458	Basically the Belgian brand.
3730678	3731659	L-I-N-D-T.
3731719	3732960	I can't blame you, man.
3733960	3734721	L-I-N-D-T.
3735221	3736822	But Josta is one of my favorites.
3736882	3740424	Those truffles are like crack.
3740464	3747529	I only eat dark chocolate because milk chocolate is kind of not good for you and white chocolate is made out of the leftover milk fat when they make regular chocolate.
3747669	3750571	Why is it that every fucking week this show turns into the Food Network?
3753581	3754322	Who knows?
3754682	3755383	Without fail.
3755803	3760107	I must say, though, that when it comes to chocolate, I am a big fan of dark, dark chocolate.
3762269	3764631	So, thank you for appeasing my chocolate craving.
3765672	3766292	No problem.
3766773	3767613	You're my hero now.
3767854	3768154	All right.
3768394	3768654	Yeah.
3769135	3770436	Spirit Snare, anything else on your mind?
3771417	3771897	Nope.
3771937	3772798	Five more days.
3773439	3773679	What?
3774687	3775468	Five more days.
3775528	3776088	That's right.
3776128	3781232	And then you get to meet us in the flesh and be disappointed with our underwhelming presence in person.
3781633	3781813	All right.
3781833	3783014	Have a good one, Spirit Snare.
3783254	3783735	Okay.
3783915	3784275	Take care.
3784295	3784455	Thanks.
3784575	3784996	Good night.
3785336	3785736	Good night.
3787738	3788759	We're getting a call over here.
3790560	3790820	Hi.
3790861	3791821	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3792162	3792522	Who's this?
3792622	3793022	Hi.
3793263	3795104	I remembered what I wanted to talk about.
3795124	3795424	All right.
3795464	3796245	Welcome back.
3796265	3796805	Welcome back.
3796826	3797246	What is it?
3799007	3801249	I was seeing if you guys were interested in something.
3801690	3801890	Okay.
3802537	3803357	Work at Nintendo.
3803417	3804598	I do get the Wii early.
3805719	3816804	And I was wondering if the listeners and you guys would be interested in me buying one out of my own pocket, donating it to OLR, and you guys giving it away on the launch date.
3817664	3818204	Fuck yes.
3819825	3819905	Okay.
3820766	3823207	Yeah, I mean, what's the deal here?
3823367	3824948	Do we have to give you something out of this?
3824968	3825088	No.
3827792	3828933	Do we get to play it first?
3829034	3832317	Because if we get it early, we're going to crack that shit open and play with it.
3834239	3837621	I guess you guys can give away a quote-unquote slightly used Wii console.
3837841	3839081	We'll autograph it or something.
3839101	3839682	That'll make it special.
3839702	3841443	Yeah, it'll be the special OLR edition Wii.
3842663	3843143	That's what we'll do.
3843183	3845284	We'll get out an orange highlighter and color it orange.
3845605	3846305	Screw that.
3846405	3847065	I'll spray paint it.
3847085	3847946	There you go.
3847966	3851347	Yeah, we'll spray paint the Wii and we'll give away the world's only orange Wii.
3851387	3851888	It'll be great.
3852448	3853068	It would work.
3853088	3857370	Also, in regards to the launch date, I don't think it's going to be October.
3858471	3859111	Oh, why is that?
3860712	3863273	Seeing as it's an October launch date,
3863914	3867096	We haven't seen any titles come into my department yet.
3867997	3871500	If it comes out in October, that gives us less than six months to test the console.
3872460	3874482	And we would probably be a bit rushed by that.
3874762	3877804	So I would probably say shoot more for November.
3878044	3879645	Did you guys test those E3 demos?
3881227	3882508	I personally did not.
3883148	3888252	I got the screw with some of them because the company has their own little mini E3 at Nintendo.
3889252	3892735	But I did not personally test any of the Wii demos.
3893086	3893786	Hmm.
3894006	3895107	Well, I don't know.
3895187	3896788	Maybe there'll be a lot of overtime coming.
3897108	3900889	The evidence for October is still pretty good, the way we're looking at it.
3900989	3906031	But, I mean, we're not necessarily claiming that is the definitive date.
3906051	3908893	We're just saying, hey, here's some evidence that makes it look pretty strong.
3909193	3910013	It's going to be October.
3910073	3911153	But, you know, you bring up a good point.
3913074	3914695	Well, maybe you'll get it in next week.
3915835	3916216	Hopefully.
3916496	3916776	All right.
3917076	3917616	Well, we've got to go.
3917656	3918757	We're going to take one more call, okay?
3918777	3919397	All right.
3919417	3919937	Take care, guys.
3920057	3920277	Bye.
3921198	3921398	All right.
3921478	3921998	One last call.
3922659	3923560	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3925141	3925501	Who's this?
3926842	3930946	Uh, Nintendo MX64, I just wanted to talk about a little bit of things.
3931186	3932627	Alright, make it quick, what's up?
3933428	3936450	Wait, wait, hang on, let me turn down volume stream.
3936490	3937011	Hang on to what?
3937031	3937651	Please do, you guys.
3938032	3938332	Alright.
3939693	3940574	Can you hear me?
3940614	3941374	Yes, we can, what's up?
3943336	3945518	Oh crap, I turned down the volume on the entire thing.
3945598	3946359	Oh my god.
3947319	3947860	Okay.
3947940	3948701	Hi, you there?
3949363	3950584	Technical Difficulties
3967253	3980177	Yeah, because in three weeks I'll be going to New York for this art show that my sister's in, and we're not going to take our van with TV and stuff that I normally play video games with, because where are you going to park in New York?
3981657	3982397	Parking garages.
3982597	3982837	Good point.
3982857	3983658	Our van's not going to fit.
3983918	3984318	Good point.
3985658	3988819	So I was going to take my laptop and stuff and do games on there.
3991198	3992399	I've played it before, yeah.
4016286	4017707	Okay, cool.
4018787	4021808	Because I mentioned a couple.
4021968	4024629	Yeah, I remember some phone call talking about this a while back.
4026549	4027970	All right, we got to let you go.
4028090	4028690	We're wrapping up.
4029470	4031891	Okay, that's fine.
4032311	4033512	What is with people forgetting tonight?
4033532	4034772	All right, have a good one.
4035352	4036713	What is with people forgetting tonight?
4036913	4037633	Something in the air.
4038914	4042795	It's because all you people have your attention diverted with the Desperate Housewives finale or something.
4044687	4045187	I'm just kidding.
4045227	4046248	I really hope you're not watching that.
4046909	4047489	Moving on.
4048550	4049470	Last Minute Stories.
4049690	4051692	We have to give our listeners more credit than that.
4051832	4052132	Anyone?
4052252	4052532	Anyone?
4052632	4055955	Actually, I have friends that watch the show and say it's great.
4055995	4056735	It's just not my thing.
4057195	4058096	I'm turning into Jamie.
4058296	4059637	There's no show I've been watching.
4059897	4061458	I haven't even watched The Soup for three weeks.
4061498	4063440	That's rare for me because that's like my favorite show.
4063720	4064660	I don't watch anything at all.
4064961	4065921	That's been me lately.
4066302	4067963	Anyway, Dark Sakura, Last Minute Stories.
4068183	4071225	Xbox Live hits 24 million downloads.
4072626	4076468	Over 600 terabytes of data were transferred during E3.
4076668	4076949	Wow.
4077149	4077909	The week of E3.
4078569	4083012	Which is 30 times more data than is found in all the printed material in the U.S.
4083052	4084133	Library of Congress.
4084773	4085754	I contributed to that number.
4086754	4087374	As we all did.
4087414	4091357	Well, we had them downloading Lost Planet at the E3 Outpost, too.
4092017	4092878	And then we played Uno.
4094018	4100202	But the single most popular item downloaded for Xbox Live Marketplace was the trailer for Halo 3.
4101294	4107059	But the rest of the download chart shows that the playable demos were more popular than the videos in general.
4108079	4112183	They had Lost Planet, Test Drive Unlimited, and MotoGP06.
4113724	4115966	So that was a bit of Microsoft news.
4117086	4117367	Awesome.
4120294	4124775	Black Wolf would like to point out Uno greater than Lost Planet.
4126036	4129177	He also says we downloaded the Halo 3 trailer at the outpost too.
4129477	4130157	I didn't see it there.
4130538	4134319	I didn't see it until I got home.
4136260	4137940	You know you just gave that away to all our listeners?
4137960	4138401	That's fine.
4138421	4139281	That's my husband.
4139541	4141682	I won't tell anybody what mine is because I don't have one.
4143602	4143883	Alright.
4145748	4147008	Loki, any last minute stories?
4147348	4151230	Yeah, if you happen to buy a DS Lite here next month or so.
4152930	4155911	You do know you can put homebrew stuff on there really simple.
4159652	4166014	Daytail actually has their Max Media Launcher, which, guess what, works just like one of those PassMe keys that they used to have.
4166514	4169635	So you can put all this wonderful stuff on there, including homebrew.
4170396	4177800	including such things as SCUMM VMDS, which is for running Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc.
4178241	4185645	DS Linux, and of course, an IRC program, among other homebrew apps.
4186826	4191268	And that Daydell thing, I believe, has carried most major retailers.
4191328	4194530	I think even they had it at Best Buy and GameStop and stuff, so.
4195836	4196316	Check it out.
4196916	4197657	All right.
4197717	4203018	Chat room is pointing out I actually cut DarkSakura off before she got her husband's full screen name out.
4203698	4205119	What?
4206059	4213401	I don't think you got the second word of his screen name out, but that's okay because if you're smart and you know what kind of games Jamie plays, you can figure out what the screen name is.
4213701	4214301	It's not mine.
4214741	4214962	Yeah.
4215502	4217182	Gunstar, come on.
4218002	4219423	I said it.
4220383	4221283	You just talked over me.
4221543	4221904	Oh, okay.
4222964	4223264	Okay.
4224446	4226127	If you're in our chat room, you'll know what it is.
4226547	4235550	If you really want to know what it is, you can send me an email to Jamie at OrangeLandRadio.com I got one of those 360 blogs for my gamer tag.
4235990	4238832	If you really want to know it, it's on the OLR forums.
4238852	4242533	I don't think Dan would come close to doing anything like that.
4242553	4243873	He just plays lots of Uno these days.
4244334	4245774	That's all you're going to see is Dan playing Uno.
4246234	4250156	Alright, let's get to the very last story of the evening and Loki's going to bring it to you.
4250316	4250596	Loki.
4251276	4253037	Yes, have you ever thought, you know,
4253812	4255754	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4272816	4283779	It's a real life obstacle course which a player jumps through a bunch of different levels and stuff using a power harness provided by them.
4284339	4288200	And there's nothing digital, nothing projected, and nothing really virtual.
4288260	4290480	It's just kind of silly fun, I guess.
4291481	4296602	But if you are interested in it, check it out at NintendoAmusementPark.com.
4297202	4300243	And it's just weird.
4302161	4305644	You know the first thought that went through my mind when I read Nintendo Amusement Park?
4306345	4309287	Nintendo Amusement Park, where the lines are four hours long.
4311469	4314832	But, yeah, it's just very strange.
4315792	4323038	They have a video on their website, though, showing the ridiculousness of it, and it's interesting.
4323699	4323959	All right.
4324804	4325805	We're going to wrap it up, kids.
4326185	4329187	That's it for tonight's show, which I think might be our longest to date.
4329307	4332189	I think we're running on three hours just about here, just shy of three hours.
4333149	4334310	We've got to go around again.
4334510	4334950	Yes, Loki?
4334970	4336211	Sorry, I forgot one more thing.
4336231	4337272	All right, make it quick.
4337332	4340934	Prey demo coming to Xbox Live on June 22nd.
4340974	4341374	All right.
4343215	4344116	Now I want to finish this.
4344316	4344796	Can we finish?
4345257	4345537	All right.
4346513	4352035	Thank you guys for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio tonight and supporting Internet Radio and Independent Radio.
4352075	4352895	You guys are the best.
4352935	4353795	We love our fans.
4353835	4354816	We do this for you guys.
4355256	4357456	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4357537	4365979	Remember, no live show next week because we'll be at Fanime, but stay tuned to the podcast stream because our live show from Fanime will hit the podcast stream on Monday-ish.
4366019	4366899	Loki, your final thought?
4367420	4371601	My final thought is I haven't been to Fanime in a while.
4373453	4379588	My final thought is I'm looking for a place to crash in San Jose on Saturday night.
4380029	4380671	Dark Sakura.
4380911	4381794	Reject false icons.
4382708	4383749	Alright, that's it guys.
4383789	4386390	Thank you so much for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
4386410	4387530	We hope you guys have a great week.
4387870	4390792	We'll see you next week with our live show from Fanime.
4390832	4392393	Can't wait to meet some of you guys in person.
4392773	4399116	And then we'll see you back here the week after for Orange Lounge Radio Live episode number 185.
4400937	4402317	And thanks so much for listening.
