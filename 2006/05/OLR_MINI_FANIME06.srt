1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:00,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:51,514 --> 00:00:56,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we are here live at Foname 2006, Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:56,497 --> 00:01:01,300
[SPEAKER_04]: We're taping our podcast here in front of, you know, dozens and dozens of people.

4
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:04,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Dozens and dozens of people.

5
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:09,646
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what though, there's more people in here now than listened to the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio, so it's alright.

6
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:12,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically there's dozens of people in the other room in front of us.

7
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, listening to the rock concert, so it counts.

8
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

9
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:21,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo.

11
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:24,054
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are you dressed up as today, DarkSakura?

12
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:27,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Temari from Naruto, only in the manga so far.

13
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:29,715
[SPEAKER_04]: She's cosplaying today, boys and girls.

14
00:01:30,155 --> 00:01:34,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And isn't, though, the Naruto thing kind of played out when it comes to cosplay?

15
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:36,296
[SPEAKER_07]: It isn't when you only have a week to make your costume.

16
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:37,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuses, excuses.

17
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:40,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year, you need to... Next year is going to be a lot.

18
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:42,498
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude's got an interdict costume back there.

19
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim is always the best.

20
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:45,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, how is that?

21
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:47,479
[SPEAKER_07]: We have our Starblazers costumes.

22
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:48,245
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

23
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:50,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

24
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:50,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

25
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:51,366
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

26
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:53,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is actually the second time we're recording the intro.

27
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:54,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to Tech Master Loki.

28
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:55,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

29
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:55,907
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

30
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:56,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

31
00:01:56,588 --> 00:01:57,028
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's okay.

32
00:01:57,048 --> 00:01:59,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Through the magic of radio, it'll all be brought together.

33
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:03,810
[SPEAKER_05]: At least we figured that out about 10 minutes in and not all the way in.

34
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an interview I did at E3 a couple years ago with Jason Enos.

35
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:08,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

36
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I still hate you for that.

37
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:10,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

38
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:12,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki asked Jason Enos.

39
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:15,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason Enos is the guy who produces the DDR games.

40
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:17,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Asked him point blank what he thinks about In the Groove.

41
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:19,725
[SPEAKER_04]: and the answer's lost forever thanks to yours truly.

42
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:21,486
Whoops!

43
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:26,547
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway, we like to start off the show talking about our gaming week and what we've been playing.

44
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:29,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DarkSakura, what kind of stuff have you been playing this week on the game scene?

45
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:36,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Metal Slug 5, big shock to everybody, on Friday.

46
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Have they increased the graphics yet on Metal Slug?

47
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:39,510
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

48
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:39,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

49
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,111
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

50
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:44,712
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can shoot more people and stab people and get heavy machine gun.

51
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:45,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool death.

52
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:46,012
[SPEAKER_07]: More often.

53
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:51,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently they have Metal Slug 6 in the e-gaming room, so I have to go check that out later.

54
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:52,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

55
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played Ragnarok online, I played World of Warcraft, I'm still level 7, go me.

56
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:04,411
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I played some Kingdom Hearts, and I've played a little bit of everything.

57
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:05,813
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dana's still playing Uno.

58
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:05,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Uno.

59
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been tempted to go back to World of Warcraft a little bit.

60
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:09,872
[SPEAKER_07]: You should.

61
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:10,412
[SPEAKER_07]: You should.

62
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:11,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Be a noob with me.

63
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:13,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to play two MMOs.

64
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing two MMOs.

65
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:20,797
[SPEAKER_04]: My link shell on Final Fantasy XI is going to hate me if I don't play more and get up to level 70 so I can do Dynamis with them.

66
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:23,579
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, we got another pinball machine.

67
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:24,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, what'd you get?

68
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Johnny Mnemonic, which pisses me off because we were supposed to have a Doctor Who.

69
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:32,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, please tell me the Johnny Mnemonic table is not as crappy as the movie was.

70
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:33,484
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be a pretty good table.

71
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:35,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I was too upset with it to look at it.

72
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:36,845
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkNight2000 DarkNight2000

73
00:03:58,678 --> 00:03:59,658
[SPEAKER_05]: New Super Mario Bros.

74
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:00,338
[SPEAKER_05]: That was fun.

75
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:04,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And played a little bit of Ridge Racer 6, which is really cool.

76
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:11,920
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on the 360 because, yeah, it was fun shooting people.

77
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me guess, easy achievement points, huh?

78
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:15,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it is.

79
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:19,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's an achievement points whore.

80
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:22,102
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, I think that's pretty much it.

81
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:25,023
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit bejeweled just because we have it now.

82
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why I bought that game.

83
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:28,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Nellie likes it more than I do.

84
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:29,243
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

85
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:32,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought it for you.

86
00:04:32,984 --> 00:04:33,364
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

87
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:34,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, see?

88
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:41,146
[SPEAKER_07]: For everyone hearing only half of this conversation, we've got Nellie looking a little bit upset.

89
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:44,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a little bit WTF.

90
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:47,368
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so anyways, yeah, that's it.

91
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:58,475
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, my gaming week's been interesting because I actually am playing a sports game, which if you know me, I don't really get into a lot of sports titles because, you know, I don't get mad.

92
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,796
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, the last like sport game I really got into is probably Blades of Steel.

93
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:06,198
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll tell you what, there's a great sports game out for the 360 right now that I'm having a lot of fun with.

94
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:07,599
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Rockstar Table Tennis.

95
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:11,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's funny because I thought you said sports and table tennis in the same sentence.

96
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:12,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

97
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have thought that Rockstar, who made these Grand Theft Auto games, would make such a fun little sports title?

98
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it because it's really easy to pick up.

99
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:20,582
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to kind of get into it.

100
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:22,183
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a really good training mode with it.

101
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:25,563
[SPEAKER_04]: The only downside is that I would have liked... It's table tennis?

102
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:26,683
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's fun.

103
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:28,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't have any character creation.

104
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:31,604
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering how they have time to make games when they're busy being sued.

105
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:33,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Who, Rockstar?

106
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:35,465
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not going to get sued over table tennis.

107
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:35,845
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't.

108
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:37,165
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no... Unless there's a hidden sex scene.

109
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:37,385
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

110
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm suing them over table tennis.

111
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:40,346
[SPEAKER_04]: No, what if there's a hidden sex scene?

112
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know what girls can do with ping pong balls.

113
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, but I don't think that's in there, so forget it.

114
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:52,734
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've been having a lot of fun with it, and it's really easy to pick up, and the online mode plays pretty well.

115
00:05:52,754 --> 00:06:06,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually playing against some guy on the East Coast this morning, and it was cool because I haven't really played a lot of games on Xbox where people have been nice to talk to, because if you play Halo 2, you get a lot of little kids on there going, I'm going to kick your ass.

116
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:10,187
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but on table tennis, I had some pleasant conversation.

117
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:14,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you say I'm going to kick your ass in table tennis, that sounds retarded.

118
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:18,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, the guy asked me if I actually played real table tennis or if I was just playing the game.

119
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:18,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

120
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,232
[SPEAKER_04]: He probably plays real table tennis.

121
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:20,492
[SPEAKER_04]: He does.

122
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:22,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God, they made a game for me, finally.

123
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:27,215
[SPEAKER_04]: He told me he plays real table tennis, and I'm like, this must bug the hell out of you that you can't control the characters.

124
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:32,418
[SPEAKER_05]: All those people that play table tennis and own a 360, the demographic has finally been realized.

125
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:35,119
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's great about it, though, is it's cheap.

126
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,912
[SPEAKER_04]: It's relatively cheap for a 360 title, and it's fun.

127
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:39,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

128
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:41,695
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely something you guys should rent.

129
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:49,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not going to be a game for everybody, but rent it, check it out, read the reviews, see if it's something that sounds like you'd be interested in, and I think you'd be surprised.

130
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:49,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I was.

131
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:56,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Or wait and buy Hitman, which also came out the week after, which is probably a far superior game.

132
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:57,369
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, whatever.

133
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:58,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's killing.

134
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some news.

135
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,252
[SPEAKER_04]: We only have a little bit of time here.

136
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,493
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to talk about the Wii.

137
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:08,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, last week on the program, we made a bold prediction stating that October 18th would be the release date for the Wii.

138
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:15,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, remind us real quick for the crowd here who may not have heard the show, why did we come to an October 18th speculated date?

139
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a couple things.

140
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:22,322
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, we have a few dates actually from three or four different publishers right now.

141
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:27,424
[SPEAKER_05]: and S&K, THQ, and God, I can't remember the last one.

142
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:34,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, they've all agreed that the date is going to... Well, they have games coming out on October 11th and also October 18th.

143
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:39,267
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually, you know, you have games come out before the release date and on the release date.

144
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:40,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, when you say we have dates...

145
00:07:41,138 --> 00:07:42,500
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about your distributor?

146
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:42,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

147
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:43,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

148
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:49,832
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is that October 18th happens to mark the anniversary of the original Nintendo Entertainment System.

149
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:54,280
[SPEAKER_05]: What a nice way to celebrate the virtual console with the 8-bit downloads, right?

150
00:07:54,815 --> 00:08:02,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, and so of course it makes perfect sense that they're going to release it on the anniversary because Nintendo likes doing things like that.

151
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:13,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Now by itself that doesn't seem like compelling evidence, but when you consider that you've got three publishers who've all targeted the same date and put it in the distributor system, that's too much of a coincidence to ignore.

152
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:38,338
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know I read another story on the internet this week that was from I think a British site that was talking about they're anticipating the release of the Wii to be November 20th over there because I guess Red Steel showed up and some computer over there is November 20th which is a confirmed launch title and typically there's a one month delay between US and Europe so you roll one month back from November 20th and you're just barely there within that same time frame so makes a lot of sense

153
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:49,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Now granted, take this with a grain of salt, somebody called into the show last week who has ties with Nintendo who said, nope, October 18th can't be the date, we haven't seen enough of it here, but the coincidences keep piling up, don't they, Loki?

154
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:55,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because Konami also gave us just this week information about Elebits and...

155
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:57,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, funny enough, it's coming out on the 18th.

156
00:08:58,573 --> 00:08:59,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Of October.

157
00:08:59,433 --> 00:08:59,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

158
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:01,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

159
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:03,054
[SPEAKER_04]: More and more coincidences.

160
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:03,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

161
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:04,855
[SPEAKER_04]: What about prices?

162
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:06,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys get info on prices?

163
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:14,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're actually THQ on their two games, both the SpongeBob Creature from the Krusty Krab and Avatar The Last Airbender.

164
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:16,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Both those games are going to be priced at $49.99.

165
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:23,651
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to be keeping the same price points that you'd see now in current generation titles, but hopefully they'll go down a little bit.

166
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:24,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

167
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:28,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, first party titles typically run a little cheaper than third parties though, right?

168
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:28,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually.

169
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:31,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So possibly we might have Mario Galaxy for $39?

170
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:32,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

171
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:33,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda Twilight Princess, $39?

172
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:35,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

173
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:35,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

174
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:38,116
[SPEAKER_04]: If they can milk more money out of Zelda, I think they'll charge $49.

175
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:39,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you?

176
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

177
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:40,737
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

178
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:42,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Takahashi Keita Katamari Damashii

179
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:01,354
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy is kind of eccentric, isn't he?

180
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:02,455
[SPEAKER_04]: A little.

181
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:04,877
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I'm not going to do video games anymore.

182
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:07,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go design playground equipment for children.

183
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a quote of his is, I'm not really interested in the Wii.

184
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:13,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think a controller should have that much influence on the enjoyment of games.

185
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:17,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he's basically going on saying he understands that, yeah, they're excited.

186
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:22,129
[SPEAKER_07]: The controller will allow this to happen and this to happen, but they're putting too much emphasis on the controller.

187
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:26,672
[SPEAKER_07]: He has also confirmed that he is no longer working on any Katamari Damacy games.

188
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,773
[SPEAKER_07]: However, Namco is releasing more without him.

189
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:33,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the PSP one is any indication, yeah.

190
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:42,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I could agree with that, though, that, you know, right now it looks like the Wii is all emphasizing on the motion.

191
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:43,440
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, that's a selling point.

192
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,161
[SPEAKER_04]: And you think about Nintendo, when they first showed the DS, they had a lot of touch-heavy things that were going into that.

193
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seemed like Nintendo was going to whore the touchscreen.

194
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,161
[SPEAKER_04]: And to an extent, the launch titles did.

195
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:59,823
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it's settled down a little bit, and you look at a game like New Super Mario Bros., it's a perfect balance for the DS.

196
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:02,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think the Wii will go that route, too.

197
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he did make another semi-announcement, too.

198
00:11:04,593 --> 00:11:05,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, what's that?

199
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:07,373
[SPEAKER_07]: About what he's doing next.

200
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:11,255
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, all I can say is it'll be on a next-gen console, and it will be fun.

201
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:12,115
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I can say.

202
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:13,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So he is doing games still.

203
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:14,275
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doing games.

204
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:15,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't he say he wasn't going to do games?

205
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:19,417
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to do Playground Designer Tycoon.

206
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:20,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Playground of Doom.

207
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:21,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Sim Playground.

208
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:23,978
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, we'll see.

209
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's talk about the PlayStation 3 for a little bit.

210
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:30,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, this has to do with the Wii, too, doesn't it, Loki?

211
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:32,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, about that.

212
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:41,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there was a survey done for Fumitsu Magazine, which they were basically polling their readers to which next-gen system they were looking forward to.

213
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:46,603
[SPEAKER_05]: And interesting enough, the Wii pretty much won out.

214
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:52,848
[SPEAKER_05]: 73% of the vote was towards the Wii, with PS3 coming in second at 22.6%, and the 360 only getting a measly 4.4%.

215
00:11:56,988 --> 00:12:01,250
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things, though, that they were also questioning was the price of the system.

216
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:12,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's quite funny that most of the readers of Fumitsu found that the PS3 was way too damn expensive, and even they wouldn't pay for that.

217
00:12:12,555 --> 00:12:14,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

218
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I find that kind of interesting.

219
00:12:16,697 --> 00:12:24,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's interesting that the Xbox is trailing so much in Japan, and yet it seems to, after E3, the kind of general feeling I have is it seems to have...

220
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,063
[SPEAKER_04]: All the inertia here in this country right now.

221
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:34,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the Wii did such a huge showing too, but it's definitely a different order here in the US.

222
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:44,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, after having spoken with a few of my friends in the UK, I've only talked to one person who has any excitement at all about the PS3.

223
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything has been Wii, Wii, Wii, Wii all the way home.

224
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:58,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I think part of that might be because Nintendo didn't make a whole lot of promises in the outset, but PlayStation 3, you know, last year at E3, Sony came out and said all these promises.

225
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:02,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we're going to have two HDMI ports, we're going to do all this stuff, and here's some games that didn't even come back the next year.

226
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:03,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

227
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:09,161
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so I think Sony's press conference felt a lot more like, hmm, hmm, hmm, let down.

228
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:14,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas, you know, Nintendo's press conference was kind of like, hmm, hmm, hmm, you know, kind of a little more.

229
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:15,943
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all Zelda.

230
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:17,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh.

231
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,461
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

232
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the audience just said Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

233
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:22,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of stole the show there.

234
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:25,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, speaking of which, who saw VG Cats lately?

235
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:27,155
[SPEAKER_04]: What did they do in that?

236
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:31,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it had a snake sneaking up in the box behind Mario and going...

237
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,951
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like blood, decapitation?

238
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:36,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, it was blood and decapitation.

239
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:37,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Kirby's like, uh.

240
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:38,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we've got to keep them moving.

241
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:39,195
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got 30 minutes.

242
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the PlayStation 3, now this could be very good for them.

243
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,121
[SPEAKER_04]: If they see something popular, they ought to do something just like it, right?

244
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:48,463
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have downloadable games just like Xbox Live.

245
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:49,885
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're thinking right now.

246
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,846
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually a job posting that showed up on Craigslist.

247
00:13:53,306 --> 00:14:04,790
[SPEAKER_04]: That game company, that's the name of them, that game company, they're looking for a superstar engineer with a strong graphics background to develop an unannounced downloadable title for the PlayStation 3 launch in November.

248
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,971
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is right there on Craigslist that they're doing some type of

249
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:11,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Downloadable title that's going to be available on the launch.

250
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:28,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I guess some IGN who picked up this story actually contacted somebody that worked for the game company and found out that they are going to be having a service that has downloadable casual games just like Xbox Live Arcade and it's going to be available on the launch day of the PlayStation 3.

251
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:41,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the game is going to be just like their current free web game called Flow, that I guess has a lot of addictive qualities about it, although I've never played it, so I couldn't tell you.

252
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:47,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So, not a really big surprise there that Sony's going to be doing something similar to the Xbox Live Arcade.

253
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:57,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's kind of doing it too, just in a different way with a virtual console, but they've also said before that they're going to allow folks to come up with their own stuff, not just classic 8-bit titles.

254
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:03,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I would like to see some of those horrible Mario ROM hacks show up on the virtual console.

255
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:04,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be fun.

256
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:07,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what else about PlayStation 3?

257
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:12,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the first PS3s off the production line are actually going to be the ones for the UK.

258
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:22,591
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be good or bad, actually, because, well, anyways, this was confirmed by the Sony Computer Entertainment president of Europe, and also he happens to be the CEO, David Reeves.

259
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:27,073
[SPEAKER_05]: He confirmed that the first PS3s off the production line will be the PAL units, and

260
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:31,780
[SPEAKER_05]: What's kind of interesting about that is usually the first units off the line are the ones that are the buggiest.

261
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

262
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:36,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's funny.

263
00:15:37,863 --> 00:15:41,866
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, shifting gears a little bit, moving away from the PlayStation 3 for a minute.

264
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:42,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God.

265
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:49,931
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned before, we kind of started here as a music-based station and then kind of grew into other video games.

266
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,574
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some news lately on Guitar Hero, possibly making a move to the arcade.

267
00:15:54,914 --> 00:16:04,240
[SPEAKER_04]: There was kind of a post that was floating around some of the big Bomani forums talking about that in the Trocadero, of all places, there is a prototype machine for playing Guitar Hero.

268
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,965
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually being manned by live people, and what they do is they just take your money and then you get to play it.

269
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:18,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't know if they were trying to make money off of PlayStation 2, but supposedly the people who were running the thing were saying...

270
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,934
[SPEAKER_04]: that someone wants to see if the game has viability as an arcade machine.

271
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:27,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So that could be interesting considering we have a lot of arcades here that already have guitar freaks.

272
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:30,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't they just say, oh, the guitar freak's successful?

273
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since we copied them, why not just copy them in the arcade?

274
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:34,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait a minute, though.

275
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:37,709
[SPEAKER_07]: In Japan there was also an Unjama Lami arcade game.

276
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:39,251
[SPEAKER_07]: There was also Namco had a guitar game.

277
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:47,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I still disagree with you, because I think in certain arcades, I think there's a lot of room where Guitar Hero can deliver that Guitar Freaks can't, especially when it comes to the song list.

278
00:16:47,953 --> 00:17:00,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people kind of walk by a Guitar Freaks machine, and most people, meaning family with kids, don't recognize the stuff that's playing on a Guitar Freaks machine, but they walk by a Guitar Hero machine, they're going to go, hey, more than a feeling.

279
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:05,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be successful.

280
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:06,990
[SPEAKER_04]: If they want to do it, I don't know.

281
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:17,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyways, the other thing that they were saying is that it's going to have about 40 to 50 songs in the final arcade release, and that the controller would obviously be more sturdier, a bit larger, and a bit more like Guitar Freaks.

282
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:17,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I would hope so.

283
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:23,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And also that they were saying that there's going to be a tilt sensor in there so they'll know if you're left or right handed.

284
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:25,476
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very cool.

285
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:26,596
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's something interesting.

286
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:27,897
[SPEAKER_07]: They love us.

287
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:29,857
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.

288
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:34,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Sakura, kind of moving on to Microsoft and Nintendo.

289
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:35,079
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked a lot about Sony.

290
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:50,553
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Bill Gates was actually talking about the various motion-sensitive controllers like the Wii controller and the flippy gyroscope crap DualShock-looking thing on the PlayStation 3.

291
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:59,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's actually saying that the average gamer, and I don't know if this is something that we should all be insulted by or not, because basically he's insinuating that the average gamer is just really lazy.

292
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:02,237
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, who wants to move around a lot?

293
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:04,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Who can sit absolutely still?

294
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:12,557
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, who's going to have that kind of motor control to hold a controller out and be able to follow without just wanting to set it down.

295
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:18,922
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in fact, the quote in here is like, it's tough because sometimes you want to move the controller and you don't want to fly into the ground.

296
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:20,503
[SPEAKER_07]: You just want to put the controller down.

297
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:22,565
[SPEAKER_07]: People aren't that good at totally standing still.

298
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Even pilots actually sit in a chair when they do their flying.

299
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,289
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot to be learned about these controllers.

300
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:30,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, pilots don't, you know, freaking play games while they're flying, I hope.

301
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:36,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, basically he's going back to the future of video games, is online gaming, is mobile content.

302
00:18:37,295 --> 00:18:38,516
[SPEAKER_05]: All the stuff his company's doing.

303
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:41,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, we want you to sit down and play the game.

304
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:44,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get up because that takes away from your game time.

305
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:47,741
[SPEAKER_07]: We've now put in Halo, we have, you know, slash pizza.

306
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:52,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Another interesting quote on here.

307
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,671
[SPEAKER_07]: This actually makes me think back on the origami.

308
00:18:57,072 --> 00:19:04,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Over time you have to say you will carry in your pocket a media device and a phone and a gaming device and say a tablet device for reading.

309
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:06,858
[SPEAKER_07]: It's natural for them to be combined into one device.

310
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:08,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that thing is too big.

311
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:09,520
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll never fit in a pocket.

312
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:15,063
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll fit in maybe like one of those Bible carriers.

313
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:16,404
[SPEAKER_07]: That's his point of view.

314
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:18,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of us disagree.

315
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:20,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what else has Microsoft got in store?

316
00:19:20,947 --> 00:19:27,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they've got an Xbox Live update, and I'm going to do a brand new dashboard, including downloading in the background.

317
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:33,334
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can actually do other things while you're downloading demos or whatever other junk they have on there.

318
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:41,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, they're going to be adding, you can actually stream music and DVDs and stuff while you're downloading from the marketplace.

319
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:47,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing they were saying, too, is that they're going to actually have it where it will remember your play.

320
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:54,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Say, for example, you're playing a DVD and you pop it out and go back to a game and then go back to your DVD later, it will actually know where it is.

321
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:56,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, that's great.

322
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of like my Mac does already.

323
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:02,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's nice.

324
00:20:03,124 --> 00:20:03,884
[SPEAKER_07]: My laptop does that.

325
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:04,685
[SPEAKER_07]: My laptop's PC.

326
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:05,565
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, whatever.

327
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:07,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I love the Mac.

328
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:17,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I think these are things, you know, it would have been nice to see these a long time ago, but at the same time, you know, at least Microsoft recognizes that people want this stuff, so they're putting it in.

329
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:18,914
[SPEAKER_04]: They're offering the downloadable upgrade.

330
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:29,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think it's going to be pretty cool to just be able to download a lot of stuff and fill up my hard drive, although my hard drive's pretty much already full because Final Fantasy XI takes up, you know, like 25 million.

331
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:32,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So much room on there.

332
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:36,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, wasn't there something about fan content?

333
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:37,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they going to be putting like

334
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:43,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, like things that Microsoft likes that you're going to be able to download as well, like Red vs. Blue episodes and stuff?

335
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:43,681
[SPEAKER_04]: They already do that.

336
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:44,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

337
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:45,102
[SPEAKER_05]: They already do that.

338
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:46,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, oh, okay.

339
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:48,865
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually go to redvsblue.com and download it too.

340
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:50,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Weren't they putting it in their own section?

341
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:52,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but you can't watch it on your HDTV.

342
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:54,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're going to better organize the content that's already on.

343
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:55,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, because it's live.

344
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,151
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you use up your laptop to your TV.

345
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:59,173
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also going to let your friends know when you're idle.

346
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, when you're not playing a game or anything.

347
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:04,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so people aren't sending you messages, hello, hello, are you ignoring me?

348
00:21:04,817 --> 00:21:05,958
[SPEAKER_07]: They can speculate why you're idle.

349
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:11,375
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on to the Wii.

350
00:21:11,595 --> 00:21:17,658
[SPEAKER_04]: This was going around the internet this week that WiiKaraoke.com was registered on the internet by Nintendo.

351
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of has all this rampant speculation going that, oh my gosh, the Wii's going to have a karaoke game.

352
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:26,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be their answer to SingStar, Karaoke Revolution, all that stuff.

353
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:31,750
[SPEAKER_04]: but also kind of interesting because that means that that controller not only has a speaker but has a microphone in it.

354
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,972
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be very interesting.

355
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:34,394
[SPEAKER_04]: But they didn't stop there.

356
00:21:34,454 --> 00:21:36,597
[SPEAKER_04]: They registered a ton of other domain names.

357
00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:37,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the list is huge.

358
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:39,501
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this big old list of domain names they registered.

359
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,825
[SPEAKER_04]: WeCooking.com, WeSports.com.

360
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:43,486
[SPEAKER_07]: WeFitness.

361
00:21:43,766 --> 00:22:03,862
[SPEAKER_04]: WeFamily, I'm sure, WeVC, but that makes sense, Virtual Console, not just WeConnect24.com, WeActive24, WeAnimation, maybe that's new Mario Paint, I don't know, WeAlive24.com, yep, there's WeFitness, WePuzzle, and here we go, WeBeauty.com, but here's my favorite, ShallWe.com.

362
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:07,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not making that up.

363
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:07,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a joke.

364
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:08,207
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really there.

365
00:22:08,647 --> 00:22:11,709
[SPEAKER_04]: So those will all actually just forge you right on over to Nintendo's site.

366
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:27,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one of the ones that they have on there, there was speculation on this website, MegaGames, that they were saying that WiiChannel.com might actually be kind of like a content channel that you can pick up through the Wii, almost like their own TV station.

367
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,558
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as Comcast doesn't try to ruin it, I'll be fine with that.

368
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:30,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, what is this?

369
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,320
[SPEAKER_04]: WeBreeding.com?

370
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:32,920
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this?

371
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,581
[SPEAKER_07]: WeBreeding.

372
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:35,422
[SPEAKER_04]: WeBreeding?

373
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:36,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

374
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:37,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

375
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:40,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there might be some interesting features coming to the next Animal Crossing.

376
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:43,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, the Nintendo Wii controller is a very phallic device.

377
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:44,288
[SPEAKER_04]: That's disgusting.

378
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:44,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

379
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:47,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, back to Microsoft, please, quickly.

380
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

381
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:51,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love when I lose my place.

382
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:52,654
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so much fun.

383
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:54,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the Wii controller vibrate?

384
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:54,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

385
00:22:55,035 --> 00:22:55,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it does, actually.

386
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:59,198
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii controller does vibrate, and I don't know why that would be important.

387
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:00,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Your wife just let out a cheer there.

388
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, I'll get a use out of the gaming systems.

389
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:06,833
[SPEAKER_07]: So, res for Wii, huh?

390
00:23:08,194 --> 00:23:13,439
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that you will not find with the 360 is that a price drop is not coming soon.

391
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:18,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they've seen that the PS3 is going to be damn expensive, and you know what?

392
00:23:18,724 --> 00:23:19,825
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have to change things.

393
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:22,547
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be paying the same prices on stuff.

394
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:25,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe that, but we'll see.

395
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there'll be a price cut come the next holidays.

396
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:32,595
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think Xbox was waiting to see what Sony was going to do when they announced the PlayStation 3.

397
00:23:33,176 --> 00:23:39,881
[SPEAKER_04]: And if PlayStation 3 had come out and said, hey, we're going to release our console for $399, then Xbox would have been backed in the corner and they would have had to cut it.

398
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:43,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Sony came out and said, hey, you're going to have to sell your firstborn to get our system.

399
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:45,766
[SPEAKER_04]: The original Xbox, though, will probably get price cut.

400
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,147
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good.

401
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:51,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the original Xboxes are on their way to a flea market near you.

402
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:51,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

403
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're about to be extinct pretty soon.

404
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:58,073
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be running.

405
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:00,874
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like no first party titles coming out.

406
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:02,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there?

407
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:02,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

408
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:03,355
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

409
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:09,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so when things don't get cut in price and we have to pay more money, we get a little bit angsty.

410
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:12,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So that takes us to one of our favorite segments called the FUs of the week.

411
00:24:15,182 --> 00:24:15,522
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

412
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:18,162
[SPEAKER_04]: That's two people that listen to this show in a room.

413
00:24:18,182 --> 00:24:19,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Insert one wing in here.

414
00:24:21,104 --> 00:24:21,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that got a response.

415
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:22,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows that one.

416
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,447
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, DarkSakura, what's your FU of the week?

417
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:30,251
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU of the week goes to cosplay, as in the preparation that goes into cosplay.

418
00:24:32,092 --> 00:24:32,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, shut up.

419
00:24:33,553 --> 00:24:35,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, I thought you were going to make some people mad for a minute.

420
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:36,695
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

421
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:41,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to go into the whole scope of things that piss me off about cosplay.

422
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:42,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one.

423
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:45,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't use props.

424
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:45,242
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

425
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:45,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't use props.

426
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:48,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a good prop.

427
00:24:49,994 --> 00:24:53,626
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was saying, first of all, it goes into the whole

428
00:24:54,204 --> 00:25:00,347
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when you have finals week and there's an anime convention the week after finals, when are you going to have time to finish your costume?

429
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:02,008
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to spend a whole week working on it.

430
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:02,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Sleep is for the week.

431
00:25:03,008 --> 00:25:03,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

432
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:14,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And then imagine having to sew and you find good linen on sale, nice black linen, and three sewing machines break while doing it.

433
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:20,237
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to get someone to sew it about six hours before you're supposed to be at said convention.

434
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:36,612
[SPEAKER_07]: and then having to deal with paint and having to deal with your cat walking all over your fan while you're painting it and your husband playing pinball while he's supposed to be holding down the other end for you and then let's get into the people who man fade that's all I have to say

435
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:44,509
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some people who do not have the physical characteristics to carry off certain costumes.

436
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:45,750
[SPEAKER_07]: You're picking a fight.

437
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,530
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

438
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,731
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

439
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:50,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that there's such a thing as tasteful.

440
00:25:50,252 --> 00:25:53,854
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are built like a freaking booth babe, by all means, show it off.

441
00:25:54,695 --> 00:25:59,777
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're of an average build, in short, like me, you wear a kimono.

442
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:00,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

443
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:02,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you're FUSB.

444
00:26:03,594 --> 00:26:11,257
[SPEAKER_05]: My FE of the week, very themed for Fanime, is to ugly chicks who dress up like hot anime chicks.

445
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:19,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, if you're a 7, do not try to dress up like a 10, because nobody wants to see that.

446
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody.

447
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:22,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Not anybody.

448
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:26,123
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're not looking that hot, keep the clothes on.

449
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:27,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

450
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:29,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the same thing goes to guys, too.

451
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Same goes to guys.

452
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:36,053
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some really ugly guys out there dressing up like, you know, I don't know, studly anime characters.

453
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:37,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Unacceptable.

454
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:40,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no problem with cross-play.

455
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:46,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, if you are a really, really pretty guy, you can pull... Like the Utena from AX three years ago.

456
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I know AX.

457
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:50,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Gentlemen, please don't wear anything that might give you a uniball.

458
00:26:53,842 --> 00:26:54,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, damn.

459
00:26:54,902 --> 00:26:56,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, please...

460
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:05,368
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, everybody loves the mainstream characters out there, but my God, how many Vashes, how many Clouds, how many Sephiroths do you really need in the world?

461
00:27:05,428 --> 00:27:10,430
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people, who has counted at least five Naruto in one room today?

462
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody raises their hands.

463
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:15,272
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm going to go ahead and explain.

464
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:18,633
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole reason I cosplayed Tamari is, again, I had a week.

465
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,234
[SPEAKER_07]: This is her lazy cosplay.

466
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:22,615
[SPEAKER_07]: This is cosplay in a week.

467
00:27:22,795 --> 00:27:23,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Ta-da!

468
00:27:24,005 --> 00:27:25,287
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes for great radio, by the way.

469
00:27:26,148 --> 00:27:28,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, moving on because we're getting pressed for time.

470
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:31,976
[SPEAKER_07]: That and all of my other costumes are too big for me because I made them when I was 80 pounds heavier.

471
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:43,041
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to my roommate, Extifer, because he left out the Silent Hill 2 on the Xbox, and it's all scratched up now, and if my Pyramid Head scene starts skipping, somebody's going to get an ass kicking.

472
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:44,162
[SPEAKER_07]: You can borrow mine, Rob.

473
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:45,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Pyramid Head is a rock star.

474
00:27:45,743 --> 00:27:48,844
[SPEAKER_07]: You can borrow mine, because I've had your Silent Hill 4 for like three years.

475
00:27:49,005 --> 00:27:49,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that works.

476
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:50,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Before it was out.

477
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:54,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on, we've got to get to some more news, because this, oh, this is so great.

478
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,348
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

479
00:27:55,728 --> 00:27:59,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't have memories of seeing the movie The Wizard on the big screen?

480
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:00,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what?

481
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:02,272
[SPEAKER_04]: You can relive those memories all over again.

482
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:05,132
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wizard is coming to DVD August 29th.

483
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:13,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, Fred Savage, It's So Bad, the Mario 3 previews and all that stuff.

484
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:14,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't Christian Slater in that?

485
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:18,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Christian Slater's holed up in a hotel room and he gets addicted to Nintendo.

486
00:28:18,595 --> 00:28:20,756
[SPEAKER_04]: He's supposed to be looking for Fred Savage and they never leave the hotel room.

487
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:22,232
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

488
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:53,983
[SPEAKER_07]: On the second, we have a whole bunch of stuff coming out.

489
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:58,186
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Final Fantasy IV on Game Boy Advance, Nintendo of Europe.

490
00:28:58,626 --> 00:29:00,467
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Half-Life 2 on PC.

491
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:04,550
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Pac-Man World 3 on PSP, Super Monkey Ball Adventure.

492
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it take this long?

493
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:07,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

494
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:10,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Tourist Trophy, The Real Writing Simulator.

495
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:11,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

496
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:14,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also have Zoo Tycoon 2, African Adventure.

497
00:29:18,729 --> 00:29:19,050
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

498
00:29:19,731 --> 00:29:20,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, do you have U.S.

499
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:20,992
[SPEAKER_05]: dates?

500
00:29:21,113 --> 00:29:22,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.

501
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:23,937
[SPEAKER_05]: This week, not a whole lot.

502
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:30,125
[SPEAKER_05]: But definitely in the month of June, you've got Grand Theft Auto Liberty Histories on the PS2, finally.

503
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:31,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.

504
00:29:31,988 --> 00:29:33,250
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some mixed-in stuff there.

505
00:29:34,928 --> 00:29:38,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a whole lot of good games coming out in June.

506
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:39,869
[SPEAKER_05]: July is your month, though.

507
00:29:39,949 --> 00:29:42,230
[SPEAKER_05]: July you've got Chromehounds, which is awesome.

508
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Naruto Ultimate Ninja, if you're an anime fan.

509
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:51,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, man, I really wish Dead Rising was coming out in that month, but that's August.

510
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:56,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how DarkSakura always has her list very planned out, and then Loki's like, man, you know, there's...

511
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:59,235
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of crap coming out this month, maybe a couple cool games.

512
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,717
[SPEAKER_04]: There is, honestly.

513
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:04,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, is anyone going to buy Cars the Game?

514
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:07,243
[SPEAKER_05]: You, sir, are a loser!

515
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:14,490
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, Cars the Game and One Street Ball is coming out this week.

516
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,873
[SPEAKER_05]: But, if you have the PSP, Gradius Collection.

517
00:30:18,214 --> 00:30:19,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray, games for the PSP!

518
00:30:20,215 --> 00:30:20,976
[SPEAKER_04]: That is newsworthy.

519
00:30:22,827 --> 00:30:24,628
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we've got to jam through these last few stories here.

520
00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:27,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, a new game by Sony of an old franchise.

521
00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:30,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, coming to the UK, SingStar Anthems.

522
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:34,090
[SPEAKER_05]: More crappy songs on another karaoke game.

523
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

524
00:30:35,091 --> 00:30:36,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I like SingStar.

525
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:37,812
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually one of the few games I've ever seen.

526
00:30:37,852 --> 00:30:38,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, wait a minute.

527
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:42,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't this supposed to be like the gay and women-themed SingStar game?

528
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:44,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

529
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:48,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you look at the list, it has like We Are Family and Scissor Sisters.

530
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:52,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we've got Queen, Radio Gaga, Cher, if I could turn back time.

531
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:53,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a gay one.

532
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Cher, I mean, come on.

533
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:58,822
[SPEAKER_05]: The Steps, because The Steps are in every single music game in the UK.

534
00:30:58,962 --> 00:31:00,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Deeper Shade of Blue.

535
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:02,504
[SPEAKER_05]: You spin me right around.

536
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:04,505
[SPEAKER_05]: By Dead or Alive.

537
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:06,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Gloria Gaynor, I Will Survive.

538
00:31:07,506 --> 00:31:09,448
[SPEAKER_05]: The Pussycat Dolls for some reason, don't ya?

539
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:12,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Leanne Rimes can't fight the moonlight.

540
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Charlotte Church.

541
00:31:13,591 --> 00:31:17,335
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, the minute this game comes out, we will have Loki live on the show singing Don't Ya.

542
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:17,915
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be great.

543
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:18,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Never.

544
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:20,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It's vice applauding.

545
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:21,128
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

546
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:24,049
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

547
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:25,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

548
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:27,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, somewhat gay theme.

549
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:28,710
[SPEAKER_04]: This is interesting.

550
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:40,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Out Magazine, they actually had this, I don't know, best of list that was lately in their magazine, and they just named Link the hottest video game character in Out Magazine.

551
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:48,573
[SPEAKER_04]: When darkness enshrouds the land, this is a quote from the magazine, when darkness enshrouds the land, Nintendo's sexy farm boy turned wolf sets out to save the day in this upcoming game.

552
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:54,814
[SPEAKER_04]: his weapons, a sword, a bow, arrows, and kick-ass grooming skills.

553
00:31:57,175 --> 00:31:57,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

554
00:31:57,775 --> 00:32:00,435
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the gayest thing I've ever heard.

555
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:07,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a gay gamer myself, and I don't get the big ear thing.

556
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:11,918
[SPEAKER_04]: They must love big ears over at Out Magazine or something, because I don't find that very sexy.

557
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:14,478
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what they say about a guy's ears?

558
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:16,479
[SPEAKER_07]: He can hear really well.

559
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:18,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

560
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:20,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, please.

561
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:21,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, next, please.

562
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:24,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we talked about this before.

563
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,852
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii microphone, yeah, might have it.

564
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:27,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

565
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:32,035
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if it's not actually in the controller, they do have that stupid port in the bottom that they could add one on.

566
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:34,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, microphone coming out for the Wii, great.

567
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:36,193
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

568
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:37,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought there was another part to it.

569
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:38,936
[SPEAKER_05]: What about voice over IP?

570
00:32:39,436 --> 00:32:43,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, voice over IP because they've already got that on the DS so why not on the Wii?

571
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Because talking into a giant remote looking thing would be cool.

572
00:32:48,704 --> 00:32:53,067
[SPEAKER_04]: You know if they're trying to market this to mom and dad, that might be a feature that sells them on it.

573
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:57,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, I wish I could talk into a retarded looking microphone thing.

574
00:32:57,531 --> 00:32:58,252
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be great.

575
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,333
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only thing missing from my life.

576
00:33:00,594 --> 00:33:03,176
[SPEAKER_07]: We like retarded microphone looking things, don't we?

577
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:03,992
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

578
00:33:26,552 --> 00:33:39,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, thinks that Mercenaries 2 is an example of psychological warfare preparing everybody for a real invasion of Venezuela by the United States, apparently.

579
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:42,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we want their oil.

580
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:45,628
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true, we do want their oil, but...

581
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:54,642
[SPEAKER_07]: But basically they're taking steps to have certain video games now with that type of theme in mind banned in Venezuela.

582
00:33:55,463 --> 00:34:04,264
[SPEAKER_07]: One of their lawmakers, Gabriela Ramirez, added, sends a message to Americans, you have a danger next door here in Latin America and action must be taken.

583
00:34:04,324 --> 00:34:06,404
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a justification for imperialist aggression.

584
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:07,745
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like they're going to invade us.

585
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,205
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we don't have anything they want.

586
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:11,705
[SPEAKER_07]: We just have beer.

587
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:12,185
[SPEAKER_04]: People.

588
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:14,026
[SPEAKER_07]: We have bad beer and hot dogs.

589
00:34:14,046 --> 00:34:15,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Blood spilling in the streets.

590
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:18,700
[SPEAKER_07]: and they don't have that there.

591
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,721
[SPEAKER_07]: They can get it in their own backyard.

592
00:34:21,762 --> 00:34:30,247
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, basically there's a law proposing that they're trying to prevent violent video games in Venezuela now.

593
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:31,168
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all over the world.

594
00:34:31,588 --> 00:34:32,809
[SPEAKER_07]: The infection has spread.

595
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Jacob, why does Loki hate Apple?

596
00:35:03,382 --> 00:35:04,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, why do you hate Apple?

597
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:06,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, where do I begin?

598
00:35:06,644 --> 00:35:11,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, listen, that computer, it may look pretty, but it does nothing.

599
00:35:11,506 --> 00:35:14,147
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets you on the internet, and that's about it.

600
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:19,129
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mac OS is such a nice operating system.

601
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice if you want to browse the internet.

602
00:35:23,852 --> 00:35:24,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Video editing.

603
00:35:24,812 --> 00:35:25,192
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

604
00:35:25,212 --> 00:35:26,893
[SPEAKER_05]: A PC can do video editing just as well.

605
00:35:27,737 --> 00:35:28,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

606
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:31,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Explain why things done in Photoshop on a Mac look better than they do on a PC.

607
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:32,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Mac is good for print.

608
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:33,579
[SPEAKER_05]: That is it.

609
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:34,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Print media only.

610
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,701
[SPEAKER_05]: No, online web media does not matter.

611
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:39,922
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the lack of viruses?

612
00:35:40,382 --> 00:35:41,462
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the lack of games?

613
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:42,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

614
00:35:42,983 --> 00:35:44,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Who games on a Mac?

615
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:46,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody, because a Mac can't game.

616
00:35:47,364 --> 00:35:48,105
[SPEAKER_07]: World of Warcraft?

617
00:35:49,045 --> 00:35:49,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

618
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:56,428
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just where you guys, the Mac lovers, look, I love Mac too, as you can see, but you're just not going to change his mind.

619
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:57,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, guys.

620
00:35:57,526 --> 00:35:57,846
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

621
00:35:58,146 --> 00:35:58,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else?

622
00:35:59,507 --> 00:35:59,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody?

623
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:00,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask us questions.

624
00:36:00,948 --> 00:36:01,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask Orange Lounge.

625
00:36:01,948 --> 00:36:02,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Video game questions.

626
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:03,149
[SPEAKER_04]: E3 stuff.

627
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:03,989
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sadistic.

628
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:05,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I see a dude getting up and back.

629
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we're masochistic.

630
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:06,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

631
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:07,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on down.

632
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:08,512
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the next contestant.

633
00:36:08,652 --> 00:36:09,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

634
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:10,332
Woo!

635
00:36:10,352 --> 00:36:11,013
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

636
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:11,793
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big room.

637
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:12,273
[SPEAKER_03]: You win air.

638
00:36:13,994 --> 00:36:14,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Your name, sir?

639
00:36:15,595 --> 00:36:15,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael.

640
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:17,796
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see you're wearing a Squeenix shirt.

641
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:18,336
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

642
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:19,297
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your question for us, Michael?

643
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:38,534
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times do you think by the end of the year that the Blu-ray technology will crash because of various problems reading different... Because the difference between reading a DVD semi-sequentially and maybe having to grab different things from all different parts of a game disc, I think is going to be a big problem for the PS3.

644
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:40,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was wondering what you guys thought about that.

645
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:42,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask you a question as an answer.

646
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,495
[SPEAKER_07]: How many times does a person blink in a day?

647
00:36:45,598 --> 00:36:46,798
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how often it will crash.

648
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:47,138
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them.

649
00:36:47,558 --> 00:36:49,159
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm not getting a PS3.

650
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:53,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been looking forward to it until I saw the price point and then saw what it was.

651
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:53,880
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, no.

652
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's press conference was depressing.

653
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Sony kind of just made a grave mistake in not putting the Blu-ray movies out there on the show floor.

654
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:08,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what they should have done is they should have on the show floor had, here's a Blu-ray movie playing next to a regular DVD.

655
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:10,143
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why you need to upgrade the Blu-ray.

656
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:10,343
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

657
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:11,363
[SPEAKER_05]: We've tried that before.

658
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:11,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they did.

659
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:16,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how many people in this room actually have an HDTV capable of that high resolution?

660
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,749
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about a half of the room.

661
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:20,609
[SPEAKER_04]: A third half.

662
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:25,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but of course we're all... Yeah, you all are nerds, so of course you have an HDTV.

663
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:26,312
[SPEAKER_04]: We all love our games.

664
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,633
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in here because we're gamers and anime fans, right?

665
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:29,833
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to make them look pretty.

666
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:32,235
[SPEAKER_07]: But... That's okay.

667
00:37:34,356 --> 00:37:35,076
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

668
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:45,124
[SPEAKER_07]: But seriously, how many people though across the world in the areas that would, you know, they're going to market the PS3 and do you think are actually going to be able to take advantage of that level of technology?

669
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:47,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Japan, yeah, exactly.

670
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Could they be setting themselves up for the long run?

671
00:37:50,106 --> 00:37:53,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's not so much about launch day, but it's about what's going on a couple years in advance?

672
00:37:55,074 --> 00:37:59,856
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be a mistake given the Xbox 360 has been out a year already.

673
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:11,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've already got a person who hates Microsoft gaming, but has already said that Microsoft may be making leaps and bounds towards somewhat evening the console wars between the two sides.

674
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:12,992
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it sounded like to me.

675
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:20,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if Blu-ray doesn't take off, it's not like that's ever held Sony back with the fact that they've had a failed media format.

676
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:24,736
[SPEAKER_05]: MiniDisc, the UMDs, Beta.

677
00:38:24,796 --> 00:38:26,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Beta was good.

678
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:31,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Microsoft's learning from their lack of diversity on the first Xbox, at least if E3 is any showing.

679
00:38:31,678 --> 00:38:35,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're really finally starting to learn what the rest of us really want.

680
00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:36,379
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

681
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:39,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'll tell you, games like 99 Nights and stuff were pretty hot.

682
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we got another question here.

683
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:41,842
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your name, sir?

684
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:42,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Willie.

685
00:38:43,383 --> 00:38:45,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Willie, and Willie's got a DDR Freak shirt on.

686
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:45,964
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a lot of buddies over there.

687
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:47,105
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks like one of the old school DDR Freak shirts.

688
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:47,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Willie, what's on your mind?

689
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:52,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I did want to hear Loki rant, but he got that taken care of.

690
00:38:52,189 --> 00:38:55,070
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was wondering what you guys thought of the arcade here.

691
00:38:55,911 --> 00:38:56,852
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't checked it out yet.

692
00:38:56,932 --> 00:38:59,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually got here about an hour before we had to get up here.

693
00:39:00,554 --> 00:39:02,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything left at Miggle?

694
00:39:02,035 --> 00:39:04,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it just looks like they moved Miggle over here, Milpitas Golf Land.

695
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:08,248
[SPEAKER_04]: OnCampus Entertainment brought all this stuff over here.

696
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,910
[SPEAKER_07]: So what games are in there right now?

697
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:16,657
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Extreme, Parapara, Initial D, and Wangan, and all that air hockey.

698
00:39:16,717 --> 00:39:19,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to get my cards out and freaking play some Long God Midnight.

699
00:39:21,482 --> 00:39:22,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I will challenge anybody in this room.

700
00:39:23,364 --> 00:39:23,685
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

701
00:39:23,745 --> 00:39:25,426
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got the right games for this crowd.

702
00:39:25,806 --> 00:39:26,126
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.

703
00:39:26,286 --> 00:39:27,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they left.

704
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:31,670
[SPEAKER_05]: They really have enough room left for some actual go-kart racing.

705
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,251
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I thought that the only thing was missing.

706
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:34,752
[SPEAKER_04]: That room over there is kind of empty.

707
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:38,295
[SPEAKER_04]: You could be doing Mario Kart Live around the arcade.

708
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of room over there.

709
00:39:39,696 --> 00:39:40,076
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

710
00:39:40,096 --> 00:39:43,398
[SPEAKER_07]: We should get the people to cosplay the initial D cars again and run around the room.

711
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,240
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the last question, guys, because we've got to wrap it up.

712
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,381
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to be rude to the next folks.

713
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:47,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Your name, sir?

714
00:39:48,062 --> 00:39:48,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Ricardo.

715
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:49,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Ricardo.

716
00:39:49,463 --> 00:39:49,863
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your question?

717
00:39:51,257 --> 00:39:59,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Aside from the idea of the new Guitar Hero Arcade, what new music game do you guys think ought to come out that will get the crowd up and amped again?

718
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Sax Mania.

719
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:05,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Clarinet Freaks.

720
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:08,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we need more Parappa.

721
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:09,769
[SPEAKER_07]: We need another Um Jammerlammy.

722
00:40:11,057 --> 00:40:13,719
[SPEAKER_07]: that utilizes the Guitar Hero controller.

723
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:15,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you talking arcade or are you talking console?

724
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:16,121
[SPEAKER_04]: He says arcade.

725
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:16,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, arcade.

726
00:40:17,162 --> 00:40:21,385
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a tough one because I would like to see something new.

727
00:40:21,726 --> 00:40:24,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Sega needs to hop up and make me a Universe Harrier.

728
00:40:26,169 --> 00:40:29,311
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to freaking bring Planet Harrier out on some system or the other.

729
00:40:29,832 --> 00:40:31,193
[SPEAKER_07]: We need Planet Harrier on the Wii.

730
00:40:31,893 --> 00:40:32,414
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we need.

731
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:36,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see something like frequency amplitude type stuff in the arcade.

732
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be pretty hot because I like those games.

733
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:38,899
[SPEAKER_04]: They're awesome.

734
00:40:39,542 --> 00:41:09,169
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know with Harmonix having that formula work so successfully now that they've just attached a guitar to it they ought to go back and revisit the idea of doing one of their you know trancy techno type games so that's my answer I want to see like a frequency amplitude type thing in the arcade you want Technic beat on arcade no Technic beat was kind of lame alright that's it one more story one more quick story here and then we're going to wrap it up Loki yes a perfect story to end on basically you know you know a company's got a really dumb idea when they come out with this

735
00:41:09,605 --> 00:41:12,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Co-masters, they're coming out with a game called The Turds.

736
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:15,967
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, you play crap.

737
00:41:16,968 --> 00:41:17,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

738
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:21,009
[SPEAKER_05]: What exactly are The Turds, you might ask?

739
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:23,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is from the official website.

740
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this the sequel to Boonga Boonga or whatever that thing was called?

741
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:26,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

742
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:30,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, here's from their official website, hopefully going to answer the question.

743
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:38,836
[SPEAKER_05]: On a winter's night in 2001, during a heavy drinking session at home amongst friends, I decided to stumble off to the toilet for what I was going to...

744
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:43,722
[SPEAKER_05]: for what was going to be a good pan-splitting chunder.

745
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:52,704
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, and don't ask why, I brought a small lump of brown plasticine with me from our studio.

746
00:41:53,085 --> 00:42:02,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Whilst performing my toilet bowl opera and singing my guts up for the toilet gods, Hugh and Frank, I managed to crush the plasticine into a pulp.

747
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:11,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I delivered the goods and that wonderful feeling of calm sank in, I found myself looking at the plasticine.

748
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:15,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I decided to take that pulp and create a turd with a face.

749
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:19,283
[SPEAKER_05]: As I played with my new friend on the side...

750
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:23,368
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why you don't drink that much.

751
00:42:23,388 --> 00:42:25,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Put that person in a jacket and put them in the back of the van.

752
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:30,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I wonder who spiked this person's beer with, like, antifreeze.

753
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:31,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that guy.

754
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:37,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, as I played with my new friend on the side of the toilet seat, I knew this was the start of something special.

755
00:42:37,356 --> 00:42:43,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I just want to say, Mac fans, what I'm going to do for you guys is we'll crop what he's saying right here, so we'll have little sound bites that you can download.

756
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,041
[SPEAKER_05]: History was made that night.

757
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:47,462
[SPEAKER_05]: The turd world was born.

758
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:53,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like... I don't know what the hell... So anyways, I saw the pictures of the website.

759
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:55,555
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like these giant turds with guns.

760
00:42:55,735 --> 00:42:56,876
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know what?

761
00:42:58,858 --> 00:42:59,918
[SPEAKER_05]: More power to you.

762
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:02,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you really want to play a game that's crap, there you go.

763
00:43:02,941 --> 00:43:03,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody just yelled it out.

764
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:04,702
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like worms.

765
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:06,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Worms with turds.

766
00:43:06,904 --> 00:43:08,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the sequel, Ringworms.

767
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:11,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that note...

768
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:15,643
[SPEAKER_04]: What a good note to end this show on, a poop.

769
00:43:16,203 --> 00:43:18,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, very fitting, don't you think?

770
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:20,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

771
00:43:20,749 --> 00:43:21,310
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

772
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Reject false icons.

773
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get a PS3.

774
00:43:25,174 --> 00:43:26,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, harsh words.

775
00:43:26,196 --> 00:43:26,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

776
00:43:27,017 --> 00:43:30,241
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to laugh, but the first part of the show didn't tape.

777
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:37,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess this won't be going up on the podcast stream or something.

778
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:38,155
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the first part of the show.

779
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:40,036
[SPEAKER_05]: We missed like about ten minutes or so.

780
00:43:40,276 --> 00:43:41,156
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what we can do with it.

781
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:42,416
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll fake it.

782
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:43,357
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll fake it like a woman.

783
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:43,897
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

784
00:43:48,478 --> 00:43:48,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Nellie, here.

785
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:49,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Hit your husband.

786
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:51,859
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

787
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:55,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for coming out and watching the show.

790

791

[SPEAKER_05]: We also have a panel tomorrow night about podcasting if you're interested.

792
00:44:12,077 --> 00:44:13,538
[SPEAKER_05]: How we became internet rock stars.

793
00:44:14,578 --> 00:44:17,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we are the celebrities of the internet.

794
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

795
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:20,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it.

796
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:21,242
[SPEAKER_04]: End of show.
