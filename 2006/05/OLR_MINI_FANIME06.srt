00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
This week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio was recorded live at Fanime 2006 at the San Jose Convention Center.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,000
Due to the additional technical challenges with the live recording, you may notice sound quality issues compared to our usual shows.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Enjoy this special live episode of Orange Lounge Radio, and we'll see you back here next week with episode 185 of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:56,520
All right, we are here live at Fanime 2006, Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,520
We're taping our podcast here in front of, you know, dozens and dozens of people.

6
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,920
Dozens and dozens of people.

7
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,920
You know what, though?

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,180
There's more people in here now than listen to the very first episode of Orange Lounge

9
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,520
Radio, so it's all right.

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,240
Technically there's dozens of people in the other room.

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:21,240
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,240
What are you dressed up as today, Dark Sakura?

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Tamari from Naruto, only in the manga so far.

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,240
She's cosplaying today, boys and girls. Isn't the Naruto thing played out when it comes to cosplay?

15
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
It isn't when you only have a week to make your costume.

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,120
Excuses, excuses, next year, you need to, now I like this.

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,420
This dude's got an intricate costume back there.

18
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:42,920
I like that.

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,520
Tim is always the best.

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,680
OK, how is that?

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,640
We have our Star Blazers.

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,800
That's awesome.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,680
Also, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,080
Hi.

25
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,680
All right, so this is actually the second time

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,040
we're recording the intro, thanks to Tech Master Loki.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,520
Thank you.

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,980
All right, but that's OK.

29
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,320
Through the magic of radio, it'll all be brought together.

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,960
At least we figured that out about 10 minutes in and not

31
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,000
all the way in.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
like an interview I did at E3 a couple years ago with Jason Enos.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You know what? I still hate you for that.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I know. Loki asked Jason Enos,

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
like Jason Enos is the guy who produces the DDR games,

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
asked him point blank what he thinks about In the Groove,

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and the answer's lost forever thanks to yours truly.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Whoops!

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Alright, anyway.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We like to start off the show talking about our gaming week and what we've been playing.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So Dark Soccer, what kind of stuff have you been playing this week on the game scene?

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,840
I played Metal Slug 5 big shock to everybody on on Friday have they

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,960
increased the graphics yet on Metal Slug no okay but you can shoot more people

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,120
and stab people and get heavy machine gun cool death more often apparently

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,560
they have Metal Slug 6 in the e-gaming room so I have to go check that out

46
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,400
later right on and I played Ragnarok online I played World of Warcraft I'm

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm still level 7.

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,920
Go me.

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,680
And then I played some Kingdom Hearts.

50
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,480
And I've played a little bit of everything.

51
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,680
And Dana's still playing Uno.

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,480
I've been tempted to go back to World of Warcraft a little bit.

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:09,980
You should.

54
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,480
You should.

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,300
Be a noob with me.

56
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,080
I don't want to play two MMOs.

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,280
I'm playing two MMOs.

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,920
My link shell on Final Fantasy XI

59
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,080
is going to hate me if I don't play more and get up

60
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
to level 70 so I can do dynamics with them.

61
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,160
But also, we got another pinball machine.

62
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,080
Oh, what'd you get?

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,760
Johnny Mnemonic, which pisses me off because we were supposed to have a Doctor Who.

64
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,260
Now, please tell me the Johnny Mnemonic table is not as crappy as the movie was.

65
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,340
It's supposed to be a pretty good table. I was too upset with it to look at it.

66
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,320
I want a Doctor Who.

67
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,900
All right. Are you ever going to get Adam's Family pinball? No, I'm going to get World Cup Soccer 2006.

68
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,600
That's going to be expensive, isn't it? No, dirt cheap. They made a bajillion of them.

69
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,780
Oh, wow. All right. Cool. You need to get an Elvira table. That's what I want.

70
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,920
Uh-uh. Or pinbot.

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,800
Dark Knight 2000, Black Knight 2000, Black Knight, sorry.

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,640
Loki, how's your gaming week been?

73
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,560
New Super Mario Brothers, that was fun.

74
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,040
And played a little bit of Ridge Racer 6,

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,080
which is really cool.

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,440
And then, of course, goes Recon Advanced War Fighter

77
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,360
on the 360, because yeah, it was fun shooting people.

78
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,720
Let me guess, easy achievement points, huh?

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,880
Actually, it is.

80
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,560
Loki's an achievement points whore.

81
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,200
But then, I think that's pretty much it.

82
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,340
little bit bejeweled just because we have it now. I don't know why I bought

83
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:33,280
that game. Nellie likes it more than I do. What? I bought it for you. That's right.

84
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,680
Yeah, see. For everyone hearing only half of this conversation, we've got Nellie

85
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:47,360
looking a little bit upset. Or a little bit WTF. All right, so anyways, yeah that's it.

86
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,880
All right, my gaming week's been interesting because I actually am

87
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,280
playing a sports game which if you know me I don't really get into a lot of

88
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,680
sports titles because you know I don't get mad and yeah the last like sport

89
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,700
game I really got into is probably Blades of Steel but I'll tell you what

90
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,720
there's a great sports game out for the 360 right now that I'm having a lot of

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,240
fun with it's Rockstar table tennis oh that's funny because I thought you said

92
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,200
sports and table tennis in the same who would have thought that Rockstar who

93
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,000
made these Grand Theft Auto games would make such a fun little sports title I

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,760
like it because it's really easy to pick up it's easy to kind of get into it it's

95
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,480
got a really good training mode with it.

96
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,760
The only downside is that I would have liked table tennis.

97
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,320
No, it's fun.

98
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,900
It didn't have any character creation.

99
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,820
I'm wondering how they have time to make games

100
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,480
when they're busy being sued.

101
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Who, Rockstar?

102
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,880
But they're not going to get sued over table tennis.

103
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,320
There's no, unless there's a hidden sex scene.

104
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,880
That's it, I'm suing them over table tennis.

105
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,580
No, what if there's a hidden sex scene?

106
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,920
Because you know what girls can do with ping pong balls.

107
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,960
Bop, bop, bop.

108
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,080
Anyway, but I don't think that's in there.

109
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,280
So forget it.

110
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,000
But I've been having a lot of fun with it.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
And it's really easy to pick up.

112
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,780
And the online mode plays pretty well.

113
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,200
I was actually playing against some guy on the East Coast

114
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,840
this morning.

115
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,600
And it was cool because I haven't really

116
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,960
played a lot of games on Xbox where people

117
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
have been nice to talk to.

118
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,080
Because if you play Halo 2, you get a lot of little kids

119
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,360
on there going, I'm going to kick your ass.

120
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,320
But on table tennis, I had some place in the competition.

121
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,960
Because if you say, I'm going to kick your ass in table tennis,

122
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,160
that sounds retarded.

123
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, no, the guy asked me if I actually

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,120
played real table tennis or if I was just playing a game.

125
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,800
Oh my god.

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:32,800
He told me he plays real table tennis, and I'm like, this must bug the hell out of you that you can't control all those people that play table tennis and own a 360. The demographic has finally been realized.

127
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,800
You know what's great about it, though, is it's cheap. It's relatively cheap for a 360 title, and it's fun. I liked it.

128
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
It's definitely something you guys should rent.

129
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,200
I mean, it's not going to be a game for everybody, but rent it, check it out, read the reviews,

130
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,500
see if it's something that sounds like you'd be interested in, and I think you'd be surprised. I was.

131
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Or wait and buy Hitman, which also came out the week after, which is probably a far superior game.

132
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,200
Alright, whatever. Anyway, let's get into some news. We only have a little bit of time here.

133
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,700
We want to talk about the Wii.

134
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:07,200
Now, last week on the program, we made a bold prediction stating that October 18th

135
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,560
would be the release date for the Wii. And Loki, remind us real quick for the crowd here

136
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,960
who may not have heard the show,

137
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,360
why did we come to an October 18th speculated date?

138
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,720
Well, a couple things. First off, we have a few dates actually from

139
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,760
three or four different publishers right now

140
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,880
and SNK, THQ,

141
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,360
and, God, I can't remember the last one. Anyways, they've all agreed that the date is going to...

142
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,240
Well, they have games coming out on October 11th and also October 18th.

143
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,940
And usually, you know, you have games come out before the release date and on the release

144
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
date.

145
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,820
Now when you say we have dates, you're talking about your distributor.

146
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,820
Yes.

147
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,820
Okay.

148
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,920
The other thing is that October 18th happens to mark the anniversary of the original Nintendo

149
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,720
Entertainment System.

150
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,820
What a nice way to celebrate the virtual console with the 8-bit downloads, right?

151
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Of course.

152
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,740
And so, of course, it makes, you know, perfect sense that they're going to release it on

153
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,220
the anniversary because Nintendo likes doing things like that.

154
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,380
Now by itself, that doesn't seem like compelling evidence, but when you consider that you've

155
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,380
got three publishers who've all targeted the same date and put it in the distributor system,

156
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,540
that's too much of a coincidence to ignore.

157
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,260
And you know, I read another story on the internet this week that was from, I think,

158
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,140
a British site that was talking about their anticipating the release of the Wii to be

159
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,500
November 20th over there, because I guess Red Steel showed up and some computer over

160
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,680
there is November 20th, which is a confirmed launch title.

161
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,700
And typically, there's a one-month delay between U.S. and Europe.

162
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,200
So you roll one month back from November 20th and you're just barely there within that same

163
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
time frame.

164
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,800
So it makes a lot of sense.

165
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,040
Now granted, take this with a grain of salt, somebody called into the show last week who

166
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,440
has ties with Nintendo who said, nope, October 18th can't be the date, we haven't seen enough

167
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,960
of it here, but the coincidences keep piling up, don't they, Loki?

168
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Yes.

169
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
What happened?

170
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,040
Konami also gave us just this week information about Elibits and yeah, funny enough, it's

171
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
coming on the 18th.

172
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Of October.

173
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Yeah.

174
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Very interesting.

175
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Very interesting.

176
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,340
More and more coincidences.

177
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
Very interesting.

178
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,340
What about prices?

179
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,660
Do you guys get info on prices?

180
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,660
Yeah.

181
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:13,380
Actually, THQ on their two games, both the SpongeBob Creature from the Krusty Krab and

182
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,300
Avatar The Last Airbender, both those games are going to be priced at $49.99.

183
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,980
So it seems to be keeping the same price points that you'd see now in current generation titles,

184
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,060
but hopefully they'll go down a little bit.

185
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,060
Awesome.

186
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,540
Now, first party titles typically run a little cheaper than third parties though, right?

187
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,540
Usually.

188
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:35,480
we might have Mario Galaxy for 39 maybe Zelda Twilight Princess 39 I don't know

189
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,260
if they can milk more money out of Zelda I think they'll charge 49 don't you

190
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,060
definitely yeah all right so I guess that's some of our further predictions

191
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,420
on the Wii it's all added it's too much coincidence for us to ignore there are

192
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,580
some people who don't really care for the Wii though well who well that would

193
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:58,460
actually be Takahashi Keita who was the designer of Katamari Damacy but that guy

194
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,920
is kind of like a he's kind of a centric isn't he cuz he's like I'm not gonna do

195
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,140
video games anymore I'm gonna go design playground equipment for children

196
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,820
I'm not really interested in the Wii I don't think a controller should have

197
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,200
that much influence on the enjoyment of games I mean he's basically going on

198
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,740
saying he understands that yeah they're excited you're the controller will allow

199
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,700
this to happen this to happen but they're putting too much emphasis on the

200
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,820
controller he has also confirmed that he is no longer working on any Katamari

201
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:32,080
Damacy games however Namco is releasing more without him and if the PSP one is

202
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:39,140
any indication yeah now I I could agree with that though that you know right now

203
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,080
it looks like the Wii is all emphasizing on the motion but you know that's a

204
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,860
selling point and you think about Nintendo when they first showed the DS

205
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,820
they had a lot of touch heavy things that were going into that and it seemed

206
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,580
like Nintendo was gonna whore the touchscreen and to an extent the launch

207
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,580
titles did but now it's settled down a little bit and you look at a game like

208
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,740
new Super Mario Brothers it's a perfect balance for the DS and so I think the

209
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,340
Wii will go that route too. Well he did make another semi-announcement too.

210
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,380
What's that? About what he's doing next is all I can say is it'll be on a next

211
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,940
gen console and it will be fun that's all I can say. So he is doing games still.

212
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,760
Didn't he say he wasn't gonna do games? He's gonna do playground designer

213
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,040
tycoon. Playground of doom. Sim playground. Alright well we'll see. Anyway

214
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Let's talk about the PlayStation 3 for a little bit.

215
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,040
Actually, no, this has to do with the Wii 2, doesn't it, Loki?

216
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Yeah, about that.

217
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Actually, there was a survey done for Famitsu Magazine,

218
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,040
which they were basically polling their readers

219
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,040
to which next-gen system they were looking forward to.

220
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,040
And interesting enough, the Wii pretty much won out.

221
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,040
73% of the vote was towards the Wii,

222
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,040
with PS3 coming in second at 22.6%,

223
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,960
and the 360 only getting a measly 4.4%.

224
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,720
One of the things, though, that they were also questioning

225
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,880
was the price of the system,

226
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,040
and it was quite funny that most of,

227
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,280
well, it's kind of obvious,

228
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,600
most of the readers of Famitsu found

229
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,920
that the PS3 was way too damn expensive,

230
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,320
and even they wouldn't pay for that, so I don't know.

231
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,720
I find that kind of interesting.

232
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,260
I think it's interesting that the Xbox

233
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,040
is trailing so much in Japan,

234
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,240
and yet it seems to, after E3,

235
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,900
kind of general feeling I have is it seems to have all the inertia here in

236
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,960
this country right now you know with well kind of the we did it you know such

237
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,960
a huge showing too but you know it's definitely a different order here in the

238
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,760
US definitely actually after I've spoken with a few of my friends in the UK I've

239
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,160
only talked to one person who has any excitement at all about the ps3 it's all

240
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:51,200
been everything has been we we we we all the way home well you know I think part

241
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,080
of that might be because Nintendo didn't make a whole lot of promises on the

242
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,880
outset but PlayStation 3 you know last year at e3 Sony came out and said all

243
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,760
these promises hey we're gonna have two HDMI ports we're gonna do all this stuff

244
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,320
and here's some games that didn't even come back the next year you know so I

245
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,000
think Sony's press conference felt a lot more like let down whereas you know

246
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,040
Nintendo's press conference was kind of like you know kind of a little more it

247
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,000
was all Zelda that's right it's I mean the audience who said Super Smash

248
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,280
Brothers Brawl, I mean that's kind of stole the show there.

249
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,400
Actually speaking of which, who saw VG Cats lately?

250
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,440
What did they do in that?

251
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,920
OK, it had a snake sneaking up in the box behind Mario

252
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,800
and going, crat.

253
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,200
It was like blood, decapitation?

254
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,440
Yeah, it was blood and decapitation.

255
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,600
Then Kirby's like, uh.

256
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,480
All right, we've got to keep them moving.

257
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,400
We've got 30 minutes.

258
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,880
Anyway, the PlayStation 3, now this

259
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,120
could be very good for them.

260
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,760
If they see something popular, they

261
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,140
ought to do something just like it, right?

262
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,640
It's going to have downloadable games just like Xbox Live.

263
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,280
is what we're thinking right now.

264
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,200
There's actually a job posting that showed up on Craigslist.

265
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,380
That game company, that's the name of them,

266
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,960
that game company, they're looking for a superstar

267
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,120
engineer with a strong graphics background

268
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,880
to develop an unannounced downloadable title

269
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,920
for the PlayStation 3 launch in November.

270
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,000
So there it is right there on Craigslist

271
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,500
that they're doing some type of downloadable title that's

272
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,940
going to be available on the launch.

273
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,040
Now, I guess some IGN who picked up this story actually

274
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,620
contacted somebody that worked for the game company and found out that they are

275
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,740
going to be having a service that has downloadable casual games just like

276
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,960
Xbox Live Arcade and it's going to be available on the launch day of the

277
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,660
PlayStation 3. Also it's going to be the game is going to be just like their

278
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,980
current free web game called flow that I guess has a lot of addictive qualities

279
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,580
about it although I've never played it so I can tell you. So not a really big

280
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,300
surprise there that Sony is going to be doing something similar to the Xbox Live

281
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,860
Arcade you know Nintendo's kind of doing it too just in a different way with a

282
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,300
virtual console but they've also said before that they're going to allow folks

283
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,820
to come up with their own stuff not just classic 8-bit you know titles although I

284
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,500
would like to see some of those horrible Mario ROM hacks show up on the virtual

285
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,540
console I think that would be fun Loki what else about PlayStation 3 well the

286
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,540
first ps3 is off the production line are actually going to be the ones for the UK

287
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,680
that could be good or bad actually because well anyways this was confirmed

288
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,480
by the Sony Computer Entertainment president of Europe and also he happens

289
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,440
to be a CEO David Reeves confirmed that the first ps3s off the production line

290
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,440
will be the PAL units and what's kind of interesting about that is usually the

291
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,120
first units off the line are the ones that are the buggiest so sorry sorry yeah

292
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,480
that's funny all right shifting gears a little bit moving away from the

293
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,120
PlayStation 3 for a minute. As I mentioned before, we kind of started here

294
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,660
as a music-based station and then kind of grew into other video games. There's

295
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,000
been some news lately on Guitar Hero possibly making a move to the arcade. It

296
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,140
was kind of a post that was floating around some of the big Bahmani forums

297
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,100
talking about that in the Trocadero, of all places, there is a prototype machine

298
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,540
for playing Guitar Hero. It's actually being manned by live people and what

299
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,860
they do is they just take your money and then you get to play it. Now, I don't know if they

300
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,720
were doing like a, you know, trying to make money off of PlayStation 2, but supposedly

301
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,860
the people who were running the thing were saying that someone wants to see if the game

302
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,060
has viability as an arcade machine. So that could be interesting considering we have a

303
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,740
lot of arcades here that already have guitar free.

304
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,640
Yeah, I was going to say, couldn't they just say, oh, the guitar fix is successful, maybe,

305
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,860
well, since we copied them, why not just copy them in the arcade? So...

306
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,860
Oh, wait a minute though, wait a minute though.

307
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,860
There was also an Njermulami arcade game.

308
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,860
There was also Namco had a guitar game.

309
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,860
I still disagree with you because I think in certain arcades,

310
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,860
I think there's a lot of room where Guitar Hero can deliver that Guitar Freaks can,

311
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,860
especially when it comes to the song list.

312
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,860
I think people kind of walk by a Guitar Freaks machine,

313
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,860
and most people, meaning family with kids,

314
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,860
don't recognize the stuff that's playing on a Guitar Freaks machine,

315
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,860
but they walk by a Guitar Hero machines, they're going to go,

316
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,860
hey, more than a feeling.

317
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,860
I think it's going to be successful.

318
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,860
If they want to do it, I don't know.

319
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,860
The other thing that they were saying is that it's going to have about 40 to 50 songs in the final arcade release,

320
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,860
and that the controller would obviously be more sturdier, a bit larger, and a bit more like Guitar Freaks.

321
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,860
Well, I would hope so.

322
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,860
Also, they were saying that there's going to be a tilt sensor in there so they'll know if you're left or right-handed.

323
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
That's very cool.

324
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,860
That's something interesting.

325
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,860
They love us.

326
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,980
Dark Sakura, kind of moving on to Microsoft and Nintendo.

327
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,780
We talked a lot about Sony.

328
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,180
You know, Bill Gates was actually

329
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,620
talking about the various motion-sensitive controllers,

330
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,380
like the Wii controller and the flippy gyroscope

331
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,300
crap dual-shock looking thing on the PlayStation 3.

332
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,580
And he's actually saying that the average gamer,

333
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,060
and I don't know if this is something

334
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,300
that we should all be insulted by or not,

335
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,720
because basically he's insinuating

336
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,000
The average gamer is just like really lazy.

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,320
He said, you know, who wants to move around a lot?

338
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,720
Who can sit absolutely still?

339
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,880
You know, who's going to have that kind of motor control

340
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,360
to hold a controller out and be able to follow it

341
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,240
without just wanting to set it down?

342
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,920
So in fact, the quote in here is like, it's tough

343
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,440
because sometimes you want to move the controller

344
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,280
and you don't want to fly into the ground.

345
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,600
You just want to put the controller down.

346
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
People aren't that good at totally standing still.

347
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,640
Even pilots actually sit in a chair

348
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,760
when they do their flying.

349
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,480
There's a lot to be learned about these controllers.

350
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,240
pilots don't, you know, freaking play games while they're flying, I hope.

351
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,720
Basically, he's going back to the future of video games is online gaming is mobile

352
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,400
content. It's all the stuff his company is doing. Listen, we want you to sit

353
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,920
down and play the game. Don't get up because that takes away from your game

354
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,760
time. We've now put in in Halo we have, you know, slash pizza. But no, is also

355
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,760
another interesting quote on here. This actually makes me think back on the

356
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,600
origami over time you have to say you will carry in your pocket immediate

357
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,720
device and a phone and a gaming device and say a tablet device for reading it's

358
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,440
natural for them to be combined into one device do that thing is too big it'll

359
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,720
never fit in a pocket it'll fit maybe like one of those Bible carriers all

360
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,620
right that's his point of view all right some of us disagree Loki what else is

361
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,940
Microsoft got in store?

362
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,820
Well, they've got an Xbox Live update, and I'm going to do a

363
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,900
brand new dashboard, including downloading in the background.

364
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,120
So you can actually do other things while you're downloading

365
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,300
demos or whatever other junk they have on there.

366
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,700
Also, they're going to be adding, you can actually

367
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,500
stream music and DVDs and stuff while you're downloading

368
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,260
from the marketplace.

369
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,060
Another thing they were saying, too, is that they're

370
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,500
going to actually have it where it'll

371
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,340
remember your place.

372
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,660
Say, for example, you're playing a DVD and you pop it out

373
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,140
and go back to a game and then go back to your DVD later,

374
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,100
it'll actually know where it is.

375
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,780
So, you know, that's great.

376
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,620
My laptop does that.

377
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,020
Sort of like my Mac does already.

378
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,140
Yeah, that's nice.

379
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,020
My laptop does that, my laptop's PC.

380
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,860
All right, whatever.

381
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,180
Hey, I love the Mac.

382
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,340
I think these are things, you know,

383
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,380
it would have been nice to see these a long time ago,

384
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,760
but at the same time, you know,

385
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,420
at least Microsoft recognizes that people wants this stuff,

386
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,340
So they're putting it in.

387
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,780
They're offering the downloadable upgrade.

388
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,180
I think it's going to be pretty cool to just be able to

389
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,140
download a lot of stuff and fill up my hard drive.

390
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,100
Although my hard drive is pretty much already full,

391
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,340
because Final Fantasy XI takes up like 25 things.

392
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,380
So much room on there.

393
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,700
Also, when there's something about fan content, are they

394
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,940
going to be putting, I don't know, things that Microsoft

395
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,780
likes that you're going to be able to download as well, like

396
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,060
red versus blue episodes and stuff?

397
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,340
They already do that.

398
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,540
They already do that.

399
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,340
I didn't know.

400
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,940
You can actually go to redversusblue.com and download it too.

401
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,740
Weren't they putting it in their own section or what?

402
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,440
Yes, but you can't watch it on your HDTV with us.

403
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,640
Well, they're going to better organize the content that's already on.

404
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,940
Good, because live.

405
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,240
Why don't you use up your laptop to your TV?

406
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,340
They're also going to let your friends know when you're idle.

407
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,940
And so, you know, when you're not playing a game or anything.

408
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,440
Okay, so if people aren't sending you messages, hello, hello.

409
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,140
You can speculate why you're idle.

410
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,740
All right, moving on to the Wii.

411
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,540
This was going around the internet this week that

412
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:19,460
WiiKaraoke.com was registered on the internet by Nintendo and that kind of

413
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,460
has all this rampant speculation going that oh my gosh the Wii is gonna have a

414
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,900
karaoke game it's gonna be their answer to sing star, karaoke revolution all that

415
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,240
stuff but also kind of interesting because that means that that controller

416
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,500
not only has a speaker but has a microphone in it so that would be very

417
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,300
interesting but they didn't stop there they registered a ton of other domain

418
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,060
names I mean the list is huge it's just this big old list of domain names they

419
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:46,480
registered we cooking.com we sports.com we fitness we family I'm sure we vc but

420
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,200
that makes sense virtual console not not just we connect 24 calm we active 24 we

421
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,840
animation maybe that's new Mario paint I don't know we alive 24 calm yep there's

422
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,840
we fitness we puzzle and here we go we beauty calm but here's my favorite

423
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:09,160
shall we dot-com I'm not making that up it's not Joe it's really there so those

424
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,340
will all actually just forward you right on over to Nintendo site well one of the

425
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,120
ones that they have on there there was speculation on this website mega games

426
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,680
so they're saying that we channel calm might actually be kind of like a content

427
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:26,800
channel that you can pick up through the we almost like their you know on TV

428
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,400
stage as long as Comcast doesn't try to ruin it I'll be fine with that what was

429
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,140
this we breeding dot-com what is this we breed we breeding sack okay I guess

430
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,500
there might be some interesting features coming to the next well you know the

431
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,800
Nintendo Wii controller is a very phallic device that's disgusting okay

432
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:51,500
Loki back to Microsoft please quickly anyways gotta love when I lose my place

433
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,180
that's so much fun does a Wii controller vibrate um yes it does actually the Wii

434
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,460
controller does vibrate again I don't know why that would be important your

435
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,020
Your wife just let out a cheer there.

436
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,900
Finally I'll get a use out of the gaming systems.

437
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,860
So rez for Wii, huh?

438
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,220
Listen, okay.

439
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,180
One thing that you will not find with the 360 is that price drop is not coming soon.

440
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,740
Basically they've seen that the PS3 is going to be damn expensive and you know what?

441
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,900
They don't have to change things.

442
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,700
So you're going to be paying the same prices on stuff.

443
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Now I don't believe that, but we'll see.

444
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,520
I think there will be a price cut come the next holidays.

445
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,680
But I think Xbox was waiting to see what Sony was going to do when they announced the PlayStation

446
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
3.

447
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,160
And if PlayStation 3 had come out and said, hey, we're going to release our console for

448
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,840
$399, then Xbox would have been backed in the corner and they would have had to cut

449
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
it.

450
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,880
Because Sony came out and said, hey, you're going to have to sell your first born to get

451
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
our system.

452
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,720
The original Xbox, though, will probably get price cut.

453
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
So that's good.

454
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,440
Well, the original Xboxes are on their way to a flea market near you.

455
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,460
I mean, yeah, they're about to be extinct pretty soon.

456
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,040
gonna be running there there's like no first party titles coming out is there

457
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,700
I don't know all right anyway so when things don't get cut in price and we

458
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,420
have to pay more money we get a little bit angsty so that takes us to one of

459
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:17,580
our favorite segments called the F use of the week that's two people listen to

460
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,740
the show all right now that got a risk my everybody knows that one all right

461
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,300
dark soccer what's your F you the week my F you of the week goes to cosplay as

462
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:33,940
in the preparation that goes into cosplay okay shut up damn I thought

463
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,740
you're gonna make some people mad for a minute no no no no no no no okay I'm

464
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,140
going to go into the whole scope of things that pissed me off about cosplay

465
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:53,300
number one what I have a good prop as I was saying first of all it goes into the

466
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,020
whole you know when you have finals week and there's an anime convention the week

467
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,740
after finals when are you gonna have time to finish your costume you're gonna

468
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,920
spend a whole week working on it sleep is for the week and shut up and then

469
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:10,380
and then imagine having to sew and you buy you find good linen on sale nice

470
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,980
black linen and three sewing machines break while doing it so you have to get

471
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,260
someone to sew it about six hours before you're supposed to be at said convention

472
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,900
and then having to deal with paint and having to deal with your cat walking all

473
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,820
over your fan while you're painting it and your husband playing pinball while

474
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,100
he's supposed to be holding down the other end for you and then let's get

475
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,820
into the people who manfaid that's all I have to say there are some people who do

476
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:45,100
not have the physical characteristics to carry off certain costumes you're

477
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:50,300
picking a fight all right I think that there's such a thing as tasteful like if

478
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,180
you are built like a freaking booth babe by all means show it off but you know if

479
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,660
you're of an average build like you know in short like me you wear a kimono thank

480
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:08,940
you. Loki, your FUs. My FU of the week, very themed for fanime, is the ugly

481
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,820
chicks who dress up like hot anime chicks. Listen, if you're a seven, do not

482
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:21,100
try to dress up like a ten, because nobody wants to see that. Nobody. Not

483
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:28,100
anybody. So if you're not looking that hot, keep the clothes on. Thank you. Yeah,

484
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,680
the same thing goes to guys the guys there's some really ugly guys out there

485
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,980
dressing up like you know I don't know studly anime characters unacceptable I

486
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,780
have no problem with cross play like if you are really really pretty guy you

487
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,220
can't pull like like the antenna from a X three years ago I know a X gentleman

488
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:55,260
please don't wear anything that might give you a uniball cuz damn and also

489
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,720
please you know everybody loves the mainstream characters out there but my

490
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,920
god how many vashes how many clouds how many Sephiroth's do you really need in

491
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,840
the world how many how many people who has counted at least five Naruto in one

492
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,000
room today everybody raises their hands you know I'm going to go ahead and

493
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,260
explain the whole reason I cosplayed Tamari is again I had a week this is

494
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,240
lazy cosplay this is cosplay in a week this makes for great radio by the way

495
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Anyway, moving on because we're getting pressed for time.

496
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,240
That and all of my other costumes are too big for me because I made them when I was 80 pounds heavier.

497
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,240
My F.U. of the week goes to my roommate Xtifer because he left out the Silent Hill 2 on the Xbox

498
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
and it's all scratched up now.

499
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,240
And if my Pyramid Head scene starts skipping, somebody's going to get an ass-kicking.

500
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
You can borrow mine, Rob.

501
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Because Pyramid Head is a rock star.

502
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,240
You can borrow mine because I've had your Silent Hill 4 for like three years before it was out.

503
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
All right.

504
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Moving on, we've got to get to some more news because this, oh, this is so great.

505
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,760
so great who doesn't who doesn't have memories of seeing the movie the wizard

506
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,240
on the big screen well guess what you can relive those memories all over again

507
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,200
the wizard is coming to DVD August 29th and of course Fred Savage it's so bad

508
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,240
cute the Mario 3 previews later in that yes Christian Slater Christian Slater

509
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,920
Slater's hold up in a hotel room and he gets addicted to Nintendo he's supposed

510
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,200
to be looking for Fred Savage they never leave the hotel room but who see

511
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,260
everybody always talks about the power glove and it's so bad but I think the

512
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,500
best scene in that movie was the girl and when she tries to get the mobsters

513
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:34,300
in trouble she yells out she goes he touched my breast that always makes me

514
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:40,060
laugh huh all right Dark Sakura although we don't have anybody British in here I

515
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,900
don't think we might have some folks listening so tell us if you've got Brit

516
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,780
love here at a Japanese convention okay well that's all right we're doing the

00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:03,060
Nintendo of Europe. We have Half-Life 2 on PC. We have Pac-Man World 3 on PSP

520
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:08,680
Super Monkey Ball Adventure. Is it this long? Okay. Tourist Trophy the real

00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:18,020
writing simulator. Yay. And we also have Zoo Tycoon 2 African Adventure. Africa, Africa.

522
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,520
All right, Loki, do you have U.S. dates or you don't have any?

523
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Yeah, pretty much this week, not a whole lot, but definitely, you know, in the month of June,

524
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,520
you've got Grand Theft Auto Liberty Stories on the PS2, finally.

525
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,520
And I don't know, there's some mixed in stuff there.

526
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,520
Not a whole lot of good games coming out in June.

527
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,020
July is your month, though.

528
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,020
July, you've got ChromeHounds, which is awesome.

529
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,020
Naruto, Ultimate Ninja, if you're an anime fan.

530
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,420
and also, man, I really wish Dead Rising was coming out

531
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,020
in that month, but that's August.

532
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,980
You know, I love how Dark Soccer always has her list

533
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,840
very planned out, and then Loki's like,

534
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,520
man, you know, there's a bunch of crap coming out this month

535
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,360
and maybe a couple cool things.

536
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,240
There is, honestly, I mean, are you,

537
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,520
and seriously, is anyone gonna buy Cars the Game?

538
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,460
Ooh, you, sir, are a loser!

539
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,420
Woo!

540
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,220
No, but anyways, Cars the Game,

541
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,200
and one Street Ball's coming out this week, you know, eh.

542
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,200
And but if you have the PSP, greatest collection.

543
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Hooray, games for the PSP.

544
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,400
That is newsworthy.

545
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,640
Are we going to jam through these last few stories here?

546
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,600
Loki, a new game by Sony of an old franchise.

547
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes, coming to the UK, SingStar anthems, more crappy songs

548
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,160
on another karaoke game.

549
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,120
Yay.

550
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,920
I like SingStar.

551
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,800
That's actually one of the few games ever.

552
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,500
Now wait a minute, isn't this supposed

553
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,720
to be like the gay and women themed SingStar game?

554
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,440
Wow.

555
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,320
Because if you look at the list, it has We Are Family and

556
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,200
Scissor Sisters.

557
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,720
OK, we've got Queen, Radio Gaga, Cher, if I could turn

558
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,400
back time, there you go, Cher.

559
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,640
I mean, come on.

560
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,780
The Steps, because the Steps are in every single music

561
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,080
game in the UK, deeper shade of blue.

562
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,040
You spin me right round, by Dead or Alive.

563
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,720
Gloria Gaynor, I Will Survive, the Pussycat Dolls for some

564
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,600
reason, don't you?

565
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,320
LeAnn Rimes, Can't Fight the Moonlight.

566
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,560
Charlotte Church.

567
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,280
By the way, the minute this game comes out,

568
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,680
we will have Loki live on the show,

569
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,300
singing, don't ya, it'll be great.

570
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,840
Never, it's vice applauding.

571
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,120
All right, all right, anyway.

572
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,080
Moving on, also, somewhat gay theme, this is interesting.

573
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,740
Out Magazine, they actually had this, I don't know,

574
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,280
best of list that was lately in their magazine,

575
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,440
and they just named Link

576
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,440
the hottest video game character in Out Magazine.

577
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,100
When darkness enshrouds the land,

578
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,940
this is a quote from the magazine,

579
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,920
Darkness enshrouds the land Nintendo's sexy farm boy turned wolf sets out to

580
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:53,100
save the day in this upcoming game his weapons a sword wink wink a bow arrows

581
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:59,460
and kick-ass grooming skills I don't know you know that's the gayest thing

582
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:07,140
I've ever look I I am a gay gamer myself and I don't get the big ear thing I why

583
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,820
why is they must love big ears over it out magazine or something because I

584
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,500
I don't find that very sexy, but I don't know.

585
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,300
You know what they say about a guy's ears.

586
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,780
He can hear really well.

587
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,860
Exactly.

588
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,660
Next, please.

589
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,900
Loki, next, please.

590
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,020
I think we talked about this before, the Wii microphone.

591
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,060
Yeah, might have it.

592
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,940
Great.

593
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,860
If it's not actually in the controller, they do have that

594
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,400
stupid port in the bottom that they could add one on.

595
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,820
So yeah, microphone coming out for the Wii.

596
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,980
Great.

597
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,100
That's it.

598
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,980
I thought there was another part out.

599
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,440
What about voice over IP?

600
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,440
Oh yeah, voice over IP, because they've already got that on the DS, so why not on the Wii?

601
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,440
You know, because talking into a giant, you know, remote looking thing would be cool.

602
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,440
You know, if they're trying to market this to, you know, mom and dad, that might be a feature that sells them on it.

603
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Wow, I wish I could talk into a retarded looking microphone thing.

604
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,440
That'd be great! That's the only thing missing from my life.

605
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,440
We like retarded microphone looking things, don't we?

606
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,440
I know, we're talking into retarded looking microphones right now, I don't get...

607
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,040
All right, Dark Sakura, another story here.

608
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,360
Well, guess what, you know a game they don't like in Venezuela?

609
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,020
Mercenaries 2.

610
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,060
They have games in Venezuela?

611
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
Yes.

612
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,260
I'm sorry, we probably have listeners there.

613
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,560
Sorry guys, just teasing, having fun.

614
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,860
We love you in Venezuela.

615
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,860
Love you guys.

616
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,720
But your president is kind of being a little bit paranoid much.

617
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:32,060
Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, thinks that Mercenaries 2 is an example

618
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,860
of psychological warfare preparing everybody

619
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,480
for a real invasion of Venezuela

620
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,900
by the United States apparently.

621
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,280
Yeah, we want their oil.

622
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,420
It's true, we do want their oil, but basically,

623
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,880
they're taking steps to have a certain video games now

624
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,620
with that type of theme in mind banned in Venezuela.

625
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,240
One of their lawmakers, Gabriela Ramirez, added,

626
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,480
It sends a message to Americans, you have a danger next door here

627
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,220
in Latin America and action must be taken.

628
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,340
It's justification for imperialist aggression.

629
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,820
That sounds like they're going to invade us.

630
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,160
No, they, we don't have anything they want.

631
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,700
We just have beer.

632
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,400
People.

633
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,000
We have bad beer and hot dogs.

634
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,420
Blood spilling in the streets.

635
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,700
And they don't have that there?

636
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,720
They can get it in their backyard.

637
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,820
But no, they're basically, there's a law proposing

638
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,200
that they're trying to prevent

639
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,280
violent video games in Venezuela now.

640
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,500
It's all over the world.

641
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,540
The infection has spread.

642
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,380
All right.

643
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,460
What we wanna do now,

644
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,140
and I don't know how successful this is gonna be,

645
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,140
but we wanna go ahead and open it up to you guys

646
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,800
who might have questions for us.

647
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,700
We're gonna do a little segment

648
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,660
called Ask Orange Lounge in person.

649
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,600
Can I move this microphone or I'm gonna get busted?

650
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,740
You're gonna get in trouble.

651
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,580
Now go ahead.

652
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,660
Are the guys gone?

653
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,500
Or no?

654
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,340
We'll hold it out.

655
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,940
If you guys wanna come and ask us a question.

656
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,000
Does anybody wanna ask us a question about anything?

657
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,320
All right, you, come on down.

658
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,160
This guy should be interesting.

659
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,400
What's your name, buddy?

660
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,340
Jacob.

661
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,180
All right, Jacob, what's your question?

662
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,360
Why does Loki hate Apple?

663
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,120
Loki, why do you hate Apple?

664
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,640
I mean, where do I begin?

665
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,160
Okay, listen, that computer, it may look pretty,

666
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,480
but it does nothing.

667
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,120
It gets you on the internet, and that's about it.

668
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,800
But the Mac OS is such a nice operating system.

669
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,760
It's nice if you wanna browse the internet.

670
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,840
Video editing, video editing.

671
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,720
You know what, a PC can do video editing just as well.

672
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,280
Not really.

673
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
Explain why things done in Photoshop on a Mac

674
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,680
look better than they do on a PC.

675
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,080
Mac is good for print.

676
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,720
That is it.

677
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,200
Print media only.

678
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,720
Online web media does not matter.

679
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,400
What about the lack of viruses?

680
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,840
What about the lack of games?

681
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,000
Oh!

682
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,440
Who games on a Mac?

683
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,320
Nobody, because a Mac can't game.

684
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,960
World of Warcraft.

685
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,240
Oh, wow.

686
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,160
This is just where you guys, the Mac lovers.

687
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,680
Look, I love Mac too, as you can see,

688
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,520
but you're just not gonna change his mind.

689
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
I'm sorry guys.

690
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,480
All right, anybody else?

691
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,320
Anybody?

692
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,160
Ask us questions.

693
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,000
Ask Orange Lounge,

694
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,920
video game questions,

695
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,760
these three stuff.

696
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,580
We're sadistic.

697
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,420
I think I see a dude getting up and back.

698
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,000
I mean, we're masochistic, sorry.

699
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,680
Come on down, you're the next contestant.

700
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,280
Welcome.

701
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,120
Woo!

702
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,960
It's a big room.

703
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,800
You win air.

704
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,600
Your name, sir?

705
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,420
Michael.

706
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,880
And I see you're wearing a Squeenix shirt,

707
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,720
that's awesome.

708
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,120
What's your question for us, Michael?

709
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,340
How many times do you think by the end of the year

710
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,460
that the Blu-ray technology will crash because of various

711
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,300
problems reading different, because the difference

712
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,300
between reading a DVD semi-sequentially

713
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,180
and maybe having to grab different things

714
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,580
from all different parts of a game disc,

715
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,020
I think is gonna be a big problem for the PS3.

716
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,780
And I was wondering what you guys thought about that.

717
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,820
Let me ask you a question as an answer.

718
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,580
How many times does a person blink in a day?

719
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,540
That's how often it will crash.

720
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,580
A lot of them.

721
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,180
That's why I'm not getting a PS3.

722
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,660
I've been looking forward to it till I saw the price point

723
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,180
and then saw what it was.

724
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:53,900
It's like, no.

725
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,060
Sony's press conference was depressing.

726
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,700
I think Sony kind of just made a grave mistake

727
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,060
in not putting the Blu-ray movies out there

728
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,940
on the show floor.

729
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,060
I think what they should have done is they should have

730
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,020
on the show floor had, here's a Blu-ray movie playing

731
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,660
next to a regular DVD.

732
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,500
This is why you need to upgrade the Blu-ray.

733
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,060
We've tried that before.

734
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,660
Well, how many people in this room

735
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,820
actually have an HDTV capable of that high resolution?

736
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,020
That's about a half of the room.

737
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,020
Third half.

738
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,160
OK, but of course, we're all.

739
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,780
Yeah, you all are nerds, so of course you have an HDTV.

740
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,660
We're in here because we're gamers and anime fans, right?

741
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,340
So we want to make them look pretty, but that's OK.

742
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,220
That's awesome.

743
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,820
But seriously, how many people though across the world

744
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,680
in the areas that they're going to market the PS3 in,

745
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,460
do you think are actually going to be

746
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,020
able to take advantage of that level of technology?

747
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,580
Japan, yeah.

748
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,060
Could they be setting themselves up for the long run?

749
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,780
Maybe it's not so much about launch day,

750
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,980
but it's about what's going on a couple years in advance.

751
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,960
And that might be a mistake given the Xbox 360 has been out

752
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,380
a year already.

753
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,380
I mean, I've already got a person

754
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,260
who hates Microsoft gaming, but has already

755
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,940
said that Microsoft may be making leaps and bounds

756
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,860
towards somewhat evening the console

757
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,820
wars between the two sides.

758
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,500
That's what it sounded like to me.

759
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,100
And even if Blu-ray doesn't take off,

760
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,420
it's not like that's ever held Sony back with the fact

761
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,500
that they've had a failed media format, mini disk, the UMDs,

762
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,620
beta.

763
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,780
I think Microsoft's learning.

764
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,580
Hey, beta was good.

765
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,380
I think Microsoft's learning from their lack of diversity

766
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,300
on the first Xbox.

767
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,960
At least if E3 is any showing, I think

768
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,660
they're really finally starting to learn what the rest of us

769
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,780
really want.

770
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,540
So we'll see.

771
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,660
Because I'll tell you, games like 99 Nights and stuff

772
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,380
are pretty hot.

773
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,300
Anyway, we got another question here.

774
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,500
What's your name, sir?

775
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,300
Willie.

776
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,180
Willie, and Willie's got a DDR Freak shirt on.

777
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,060
We got a lot of buddies over there.

778
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,180
That's like one of the old school DDR Freak shirts.

779
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,260
Willie, what's on your mind?

780
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,140
Well, I did want to hear Loki read, but he got that taken care of.

781
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,860
But I was wondering what you guys saw in the arcade here.

782
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,020
I haven't checked it out yet.

783
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,460
I actually got here about an hour before we had to get up here.

784
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,060
Is there anything left at Miggle?

785
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:06,220
Because it just looks like they moved Miggle over here, Milpitas, Oakland.

786
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,340
On Campus Entertainment brought all this stuff over here.

787
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,140
So what games are in there right now?

788
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:16,700
They got DDR Extreme, Para Para, Initial D, and Wagon, and all that air hockey.

789
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,980
OK, I am going to get my cards out and freaking play some

790
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,100
long time midnight.

791
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,060
I will challenge anybody in this room.

792
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,780
You know what?

793
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,820
They've got the right games for this crowd.

794
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,260
They do.

795
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,340
So they left.

796
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,380
They really have enough room left for some

797
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,700
actual go-kart racing.

798
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,220
That's why I thought that the only thing was missing.

799
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,340
That room over there is kind of empty.

800
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,360
You could be doing Mario Kart live around the arcade.

801
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,700
I mean, there's a lot of room over there.

802
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,140
That's all right.

803
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,340
We should get the people to cosplay the

804
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,620
initial D cars again.

805
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,580
And run around the room.

806
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,900
This is the last question, guys, because we've got to

807
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,260
wrap it up.

808
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,460
We don't want to be rude to the next folks.

809
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:52,620
your name sir Ricardo hi Ricardo what's your question aside from the idea of the

810
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,620
new guitar hero arcade what new music game you guys think ought to come out

811
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:04,060
you know that will get the crowd up and amped again I want I want sax mania

812
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:09,860
clarinet freaks yeah we need more perhaps we need another in jammer Lamy

813
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:15,020
that utilizes the guitar hero controller are you talking arcade you talking

814
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,580
console he says okay that's a tough one because they I would like you know what

815
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,380
I would like to see something new you know it needs to hop up and make me a

816
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:29,140
universe Harrier any freaking bring planet Harrier out on some system or the

817
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,960
other we need planet Harrier on the Wii that's what we need I would like to see

818
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,020
something like frequency amplitude type stuff in the arcade I think that would

819
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,540
be pretty hot because I like those games they're awesome and you know it's with

820
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,220
with harmonics having that formula work so successfully now they've just

821
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,760
attached a guitar to it they ought to go back and revisit the idea of doing one

822
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,880
of their you know trancy techno type games so that's my answer I want to see

823
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,620
like a frequency amplitude type thing in the air no technique was kind of lame

824
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,520
all right that's it one more story one more quick story here and then we're

825
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,460
gonna wrap it up Loki yes a perfect story to end on basically you know you

826
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,120
know a company's got a really dumb idea when they come out with this co-masters

827
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,120
They're coming out with a game called The Turds.

828
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,120
That's right, you play crap.

829
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,120
Excellent.

830
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,120
What exactly are the turds, you might ask?

831
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,120
Well, this is from the official website.

832
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,120
Is this the sequel to Boonga Boonga or whatever that thing was called?

833
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
I don't know.

834
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,120
Anyways, here's from their official website, hopefully going to answer the question.

835
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:35,120
On a winter's night in 2001, during a heavy drinking session at home amongst friends,

836
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:40,880
I decided to stumble off to the toilet for what I was going to for what was going to be a good

837
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
pantsplitting chunder mr.

838
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:52,560
For some reason and don't ask why I brought a small lump of brown plasticine with me from our studio

839
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:58,740
Whilst performing my toilet bowl opera and seeing my guts up for the toilet gods Hugh and Frank

840
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:04,680
I just I managed to crush the plasticine into a pulp once I delivered the goods

841
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:11,080
and that wonderful feeling of calm sank in, I found myself looking at the

842
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:16,720
plasticine, I decided to take that pulp and create a turd with a face. As I

843
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:23,160
played with my new friend on the side. This is why you don't drink that much.

844
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,080
Put that person in a jacket and put them in the back of the van. Okay, I wanted to

845
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:32,140
spike this person's beer with like antifreeze. It was that guy. Okay, as I

846
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:36,100
played with my new friend on the side of the toilet seat I knew this was the

847
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,540
start of something special okay I just wanna say Mac fans what I'm gonna do for

848
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,540
you guys is we'll crop what he's saying right here so we'll have a little sound

849
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,380
bite so you can download history was made that night the turd world was born

850
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:53,060
it's just like I don't know what the hell so anyways I saw the pictures of

851
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:59,580
the website it's like these giant turds with guns so you know what more power to

852
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,800
Yeah, I mean if you really want to play a game that's crap there. Yeah, somebody just yelled it out

853
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,920
It's like worms except it's with turds. Yes. It's the sequel ringworms

854
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,080
And on that note

855
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,460
