00:14.717 --> 00:22.754
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, May 7th, 2006, Boobies in Oblivion brings on the Wrath of the M rating, news on the new DS, and E3 Madness!

00:32.964 --> 00:36.225
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.265 --> 00:37.086
[SPEAKER_05]: It is May 7th, 2006.

00:37.326 --> 00:45.990
[SPEAKER_05]: This is episode number 183 of our live radio program and podcast dedicated to games that don't suck.

00:46.030 --> 00:52.453
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes we've got to talk about games that do suck just because we want to taunt them and laugh at them and take them outside and beat them.

00:52.893 --> 00:55.254
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

00:55.314 --> 00:57.595
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

00:57.715 --> 01:01.417
[SPEAKER_05]: In that corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:01.717 --> 01:01.857
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

01:05.080 --> 01:05.640
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

01:05.660 --> 01:06.341
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Bunny?

01:06.361 --> 01:08.563
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you said bunny and I was thinking of the Cadbury Bunny.

01:08.903 --> 01:09.623
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I thought too.

01:09.643 --> 01:10.944
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how fattening those things are?

01:10.964 --> 01:11.825
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're so good though.

01:11.845 --> 01:13.486
[SPEAKER_05]: They're so good but they're so bad for you.

01:13.686 --> 01:17.449
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to tell myself that things that are very tasty like that are really, you know, they taste like poo.

01:17.989 --> 01:19.851
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, chocolate is the color of poo.

01:20.918 --> 01:24.240
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to keep that in my head whenever I look at chocolate, like I want to eat some.

01:24.740 --> 01:27.042
[SPEAKER_00]: But green tea frappuccino doesn't look like anything.

01:27.102 --> 01:27.942
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks like yummy.

01:28.202 --> 01:28.823
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had one.

01:29.063 --> 01:29.603
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two.

01:30.224 --> 01:34.166
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them, though, had fat-free milk in it because I got it at Whole Foods.

01:34.366 --> 01:39.709
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet if I went through the last 20 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, 10 of them would start off with you talking about food.

01:42.571 --> 01:43.732
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:08.519 --> 02:08.759
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

02:09.519 --> 02:09.920
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.260
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a busy, busy show tonight, a lot of news.

02:12.340 --> 02:19.343
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to join in the fun, if you're listening live to us right now on OrangeLoungeRadio.com, head on over to our chat room, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that easy to join the chat room.

02:22.981 --> 02:24.322
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:47.774 --> 02:48.034
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

02:48.434 --> 02:50.256
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought a Judge Dredd pinball machine.

02:50.476 --> 02:51.676
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, why didn't you buy a good machine?

02:51.736 --> 02:52.697
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good machine.

02:52.777 --> 02:54.278
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, it's really awesome.

02:54.858 --> 02:57.820
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're getting this other one called, I think, Frenzy or something.

02:58.140 --> 03:00.382
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be a really expensive pin table.

03:01.162 --> 03:06.245
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting one that's kind of in crap repair for like, you know, a few hundred, but we're going to fix it up and resell it for like $5,000.

03:06.365 --> 03:07.486
[SPEAKER_05]: Call me when you get Pinbot.

03:08.386 --> 03:09.347
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a freaking Pinbot.

03:09.367 --> 03:12.509
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, the machine I really want, really, really... Bride of Pinbot.

03:13.309 --> 03:15.591
[SPEAKER_00]: Bride of Pinbot was awesome, but I want Black Knight 2000.

03:16.482 --> 03:17.202
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:41.550 --> 03:46.913
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan and I, when I first moved out here, we used to go eat at this Godfather's Pizza because I worked at GNC and it was right there.

03:47.474 --> 03:49.875
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd drop off my deposit and go get dinner at Godfather's.

03:50.515 --> 03:52.897
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a Last Action Hero pinball machine in there.

03:53.397 --> 03:55.218
[SPEAKER_00]: And we played the hell out of it.

03:55.318 --> 04:01.502
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the reason we stopped eating at that Godfather's Pizza was because they got rid of the damn pinball table.

04:01.962 --> 04:03.383
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had Snow Brothers there, too.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.826
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great game, arcade game.

04:06.727 --> 04:08.409
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Bubble Bobble, but it's not.

04:08.750 --> 04:09.330
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?

04:09.410 --> 04:09.831
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.

04:10.191 --> 04:10.572
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.

04:10.612 --> 04:12.494
[SPEAKER_05]: I play that on the Ultra Kade.

04:13.355 --> 04:16.719
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the rest of my gaming week had to actually do with me downloading gaming stuff.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.441
[SPEAKER_00]: I played a crap load of Ragnarok.

04:18.621 --> 04:20.003
[SPEAKER_00]: I am now level 64, 48.

04:25.772 --> 04:29.257
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Addict, Final Fantasy Ask me how much Final Fantasy I played this week How much did you play?

04:29.277 --> 04:39.451
[SPEAKER_00]: Zip, thank you You're just in detox Zip You're going to get back on the habit like you did before After E3, you bet It's right where I'm going, right after E3 is over Yeah, but I can bring Ragnarok with me

04:40.458 --> 04:43.381
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:05.342 --> 05:09.866
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's all the, let's sing the Silent Hill song!

05:09.886 --> 05:11.467
[SPEAKER_00]: Heather!

05:11.487 --> 05:13.348
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's sing the whole thing, it was great.

05:14.349 --> 05:15.250
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the dog ending.

05:16.010 --> 05:22.075
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the one thing that disappointed me about the Silent Hill movie is I wanted after the credits there to be a dog ending or a UFO ending.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.177
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the DVD is going to have a UFO ending.

05:24.237 --> 05:24.557
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet!

05:24.617 --> 05:30.522
[SPEAKER_00]: It better not be the craptastic same ones like they had in the games because the only good one was like the Heather one.

05:31.397 --> 05:36.881
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, on the Internet Movie Database, they said that the original cut of the Silent Hill movie was three and a half hours long.

05:37.402 --> 05:39.243
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, deleted scenes!

05:39.323 --> 05:45.308
[SPEAKER_05]: Take everything you read on Internet Movie Database with a grain of salt, but, you know, still be kind of neat if the DVD is... I'd rather take it with a spoon of sugar.

05:46.349 --> 05:46.889
[SPEAKER_05]: ...action-packed.

05:47.470 --> 05:57.137
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think a lot of people now are filming extra stuff, even though they know it's not going to be in their things they think are neat, because it's going to be on the DVD.

05:57.578 --> 06:00.240
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have, like, an Uber Director's Edition unrated...

06:01.152 --> 06:05.316
[SPEAKER_00]: and Hoopla We're Gonna Save the World type DVD release.

06:05.817 --> 06:09.240
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the 20 million Lord of the Rings DVDs that are out.

06:10.201 --> 06:11.983
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know Kevin Smith does it.

06:12.083 --> 06:12.883
[SPEAKER_00]: He does it on purpose.

06:13.804 --> 06:14.685
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's hilarious.

06:15.286 --> 06:19.550
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the DVD of Silent Hill is going to be like the diggity...

06:19.926 --> 06:22.948
[SPEAKER_05]: Just if you want to hear hilarity, and then we'll get back into games.

06:23.628 --> 06:24.609
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's Mallrats.

06:24.649 --> 06:26.150
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either Mallrats or Chasing Amy.

06:26.250 --> 06:32.513
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those, when you start listening to the director's commentary, they go, fuck DVD, because they were originally recording it for the LaserDisc edition.

06:32.553 --> 06:34.014
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember if it was Mallrats or Chasing Amy.

06:34.054 --> 06:34.454
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the two.

06:34.694 --> 06:35.715
[SPEAKER_00]: Our stuff has a comment for you.

06:35.975 --> 06:36.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what?

06:36.515 --> 06:38.256
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just to grain the whole damn shaker.

06:41.858 --> 06:42.199
[SPEAKER_00]: Hee hee.

06:44.419 --> 06:45.180
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

06:45.700 --> 06:50.883
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, though, that same night, I had a dream that I was stuck in Silent Hill with a dog.

06:52.304 --> 06:55.546
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the craziest, weirdest, most freaking out... It was an actual nightmare.

06:55.786 --> 06:56.407
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not kidding.

06:56.687 --> 06:57.888
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a dog there the whole time.

06:58.068 --> 06:59.469
[SPEAKER_00]: Same stupid little dog wearing headphones.

07:00.970 --> 07:01.830
[SPEAKER_05]: You are so weird.

07:02.531 --> 07:03.131
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.

07:03.331 --> 07:05.473
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was because I also was eating spaghetti.

07:07.174 --> 07:09.015
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, blame your problems on spaghetti.

07:09.727 --> 07:15.595
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay, you ever notice that if you eat something before you go to bed and you've, like, watched something, you almost always end up having a weird dream?

07:16.957 --> 07:17.819
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does it just happen to me?

07:19.180 --> 07:21.944
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember my dreams, like, ever.

07:22.425 --> 07:24.448
[SPEAKER_05]: Once every three months, I'll remember a dream.

07:24.847 --> 07:26.709
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories It's not open yet.

07:26.729 --> 07:27.589
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking it to E3.

07:49.379 --> 07:49.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.500
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:52.941 --> 07:53.981
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost non-existent.

07:55.381 --> 07:56.042
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's true.

07:56.482 --> 07:59.763
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki got married, in case you weren't listening last week.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.824
[SPEAKER_05]: So congratulations, Loki, on your marriage.

08:02.764 --> 08:06.306
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Mutant Storm Reloaded on Xbox Live's arcade.

08:06.846 --> 08:07.486
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty fun.

08:08.146 --> 08:13.668
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories, because I can.

08:14.649 --> 08:14.809
[SPEAKER_03]: And

08:17.248 --> 08:21.912
[SPEAKER_03]: The new firmware update did help some of the problems, but they're still there.

08:22.293 --> 08:36.686
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, when you start playing more of the multiplayer stuff and actually starting to play the other modes that are in there, like team playing stuff, you start noticing how rushed the multiplayer was in the game, and how it really sucks and is really unfinished.

08:37.587 --> 08:37.727
[SPEAKER_03]: But,

08:38.308 --> 08:38.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Still fun.

08:39.129 --> 08:39.469
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

08:41.550 --> 08:47.695
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I've been playing a little bit of LocoRoco, which is also the demo that you can download for the PSP firmware 2.7.

08:48.115 --> 08:49.476
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned that last week.

08:50.237 --> 08:51.077
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually kind of cool.

08:51.277 --> 08:51.998
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different game.

08:52.018 --> 08:53.559
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

08:53.579 --> 08:58.523
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of seems in the same pot as Katamari.

08:59.123 --> 09:00.864
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of a little quirky game.

09:00.884 --> 09:03.987
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of if Katamari and Yoshi's Island had a baby.

09:04.227 --> 09:04.707
[SPEAKER_03]: This would be...

09:07.694 --> 09:11.536
[SPEAKER_03]: A big, cute, cutesy blob.

09:11.576 --> 09:12.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Something's wrong with it, baby.

09:13.277 --> 09:14.218
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that, yeah.

09:14.378 --> 09:16.819
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's different, I'll give them that.

09:19.081 --> 09:20.902
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it, I think.

09:21.983 --> 09:22.263
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

09:24.357 --> 09:28.538
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week, actually, I didn't play anything new because of my work trip that really cut into my week.

09:28.558 --> 09:31.299
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted $10 a night for internet access in my hotel.

09:31.339 --> 09:32.340
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, F you.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.260
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I don't like about swanky hotels.

09:34.300 --> 09:40.762
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that my work puts me up in swanky hotels when I go travel, but then they want more money for internet access that my work's not going to pay for.

09:40.862 --> 09:43.022
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't get to really play any games.

09:43.143 --> 09:46.764
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't play World of Warcraft, even though I canceled my account anyway.

09:46.804 --> 09:48.444
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I got bored enough, I would have reactivated it.

09:49.165 --> 09:50.527
[SPEAKER_05]: or any Flash games or anything.

09:50.587 --> 09:52.670
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did have my DS.

09:52.970 --> 09:55.674
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing my brain training mostly every day.

09:55.754 --> 09:59.499
[SPEAKER_05]: I've unlocked, I think I've got my 17th stamp as of today.

09:59.579 --> 10:03.385
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've unlocked the triangle math was the last thing I got, the hard mode.

10:03.465 --> 10:05.247
[SPEAKER_05]: No, wait, I think there was another game after that.

10:05.928 --> 10:07.609
[SPEAKER_05]: I only have one more game left to unlock.

10:08.030 --> 10:08.970
[SPEAKER_05]: Brain Training is going good.

10:09.131 --> 10:10.231
[SPEAKER_05]: Also Tetris DS.

10:10.892 --> 10:16.196
[SPEAKER_05]: Extifer, my roommate, has been borrowing my Tetris DS and he actually unlocked level 20.

10:16.616 --> 10:23.101
[SPEAKER_05]: He beat the whole game and so playing Tetris on level 20 is insane because the blocks don't even fall.

10:23.181 --> 10:24.442
[SPEAKER_05]: They just drop.

10:24.482 --> 10:26.944
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine just having the blocks drop every time.

10:26.964 --> 10:27.745
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it does on level 20.

10:28.265 --> 10:34.730
[SPEAKER_05]: But level 20 is inspired by classic NES Tetris which is pretty cool because you know how Tetris DS is all inspired by different

10:35.050 --> 10:35.330
[SPEAKER_05]: N.E.S.

10:35.350 --> 10:36.031
[SPEAKER_05]: games of the past.

10:36.231 --> 10:37.551
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, level 20 is N.E.S.

10:37.571 --> 10:40.092
[SPEAKER_05]: Tetris, so I thought that was pretty rad, and it has a remix of the theme.

10:40.833 --> 10:44.714
[SPEAKER_05]: Played six-player multiplayer Tetris DS last night.

10:45.234 --> 10:46.015
[SPEAKER_05]: Craziness.

10:46.255 --> 10:47.175
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolute craziness.

10:47.455 --> 10:47.795
[SPEAKER_05]: But fun.

10:48.396 --> 10:48.736
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

10:50.487 --> 10:51.227
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

11:06.014 --> 11:07.654
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up on what's going on for E3.

11:07.995 --> 11:11.355
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, we have a whole lot of news to get into tonight.

11:11.395 --> 11:14.136
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, we have a very special announcement.

11:14.196 --> 11:15.856
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let Loki plug this.

11:16.197 --> 11:19.997
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something we've been teasing for a few weeks, but it is now official.

11:20.217 --> 11:21.158
[SPEAKER_05]: We're announcing it tonight.

11:21.298 --> 11:22.098
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, tell us about it.

11:22.258 --> 11:25.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course, we're working on a new site for weeks now.

11:26.679 --> 11:30.440
[SPEAKER_03]: New site is going to be, I think it is the only...

11:30.933 --> 11:33.380
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP formatted site covering E3.

11:37.492 --> 11:37.772
[SPEAKER_03]: E3 on PSP.com

12:04.109 --> 12:06.050
[SPEAKER_03]: and so we'll get a lot of exclusive content.

12:06.891 --> 12:17.896
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to the Nintendo Party on Tuesday, so hopefully you'll actually get to see what the Nintendo Party looks like, because a lot of people don't get to go to the E3, let alone go to parties and stuff like that.

12:17.976 --> 12:20.718
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely lots of content on there.

12:20.918 --> 12:24.820
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some stuff on there already, just to give you an idea of what they're...

12:25.330 --> 12:25.810
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:47.746 --> 12:48.948
[SPEAKER_05]: To what extent just yet?

12:49.148 --> 12:52.593
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Bobby said he'd do some on-camera stuff for us, so I'm going to hold him to that.

12:52.954 --> 12:56.419
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, you're going to have videos with myself, Loki.

12:56.599 --> 12:59.644
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can give DarkSakura enough sugar, maybe we'll get her in one of the videos.

12:59.664 --> 13:01.827
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe if I can find a Dr. Doom mask.

13:02.928 --> 13:19.350
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm sure we'll have Bobby and then hopefully maybe Scott and Lawrence as well so all on the E3 on PSP site giving you walkthroughs of Boost just talking about games and of course you know our big thing is interactiveness so if you guys want to send us an email and say hey guys

13:20.580 --> 13:21.321
[SPEAKER_05]: Check this out.

13:21.721 --> 13:23.022
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see this.

13:23.062 --> 13:25.625
[SPEAKER_05]: We did this last year at E3.

13:25.905 --> 13:31.591
[SPEAKER_05]: We pulled the shows from our archives, but if you talk to some of our listeners who've been around a while, you can probably find copies of these shows.

13:31.891 --> 13:33.773
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually opened it up during these shows.

13:34.033 --> 13:35.915
[SPEAKER_05]: Like on Wednesday, we said, okay, send us your questions.

13:36.175 --> 13:37.697
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out the answers on Thursday.

13:37.717 --> 13:42.781
[SPEAKER_05]: And we actually took all the questions and went out on the floor and figured out the answers to them and brought them to you on Thursday's show.

13:42.802 --> 13:44.743
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to do the same thing with the site as well.

13:45.566 --> 13:51.471
[SPEAKER_05]: The other great thing about the site is that if you're an E3 attendee, we're going to put maps of the show floor on there.

13:51.491 --> 13:53.473
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, that's the one thing that's still missing, right?

13:53.533 --> 13:54.373
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, it's up there.

13:54.453 --> 13:55.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, did you get it done?

13:55.194 --> 13:56.335
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's up there.

13:56.715 --> 13:59.498
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not just going to be maps, just like everything.

13:59.518 --> 14:09.046
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's good to have, if you have access to even some of the Wi-Fi there, you can actually see, you know, okay, I'm waiting on this giant line.

14:09.066 --> 14:11.908
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly are they showing at the Sony booth or, you know,

14:12.694 --> 14:13.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

14:33.925 --> 14:40.487
[SPEAKER_05]: You can look at it in Firefox, Internet Explorer, but it's not going to look right.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.187
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're okay with that, go ahead.

14:42.207 --> 14:43.527
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a lot of great videos you can look at.

14:43.547 --> 14:45.008
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're asking if Flash is on there yet.

14:45.208 --> 14:49.529
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't support Flash on this because not everyone is upgrading their firmware to 2.7.

14:50.349 --> 14:54.430
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't want to force people to do that and didn't want to exclude people from certain things.

14:54.550 --> 14:59.371
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no Flash on there, but it'll still be pretty quick and...

15:00.592 --> 15:02.732
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, the Flash on the PSP is not that great right now.

15:02.752 --> 15:04.613
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to play with it, see what I can do with it.

15:04.733 --> 15:08.853
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll table the Flash thing for a later OLR PSP upgrade.

15:08.873 --> 15:09.454
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be cool.

15:09.934 --> 15:17.615
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, later on when we're done with the PSP site, E3 and PSP, you'll see some definite improvements.

15:17.695 --> 15:19.855
[SPEAKER_03]: I have ideas.

15:21.096 --> 15:25.516
[SPEAKER_03]: But lots and lots and lots of content, and it should be good.

15:26.396 --> 15:29.057
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go into some other news.

15:30.273 --> 15:34.134
[SPEAKER_05]: While you're all checking out E3 on PSP.com, we'll talk about Nintendo.

15:34.154 --> 15:42.998
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a little bit of a follow-up to last week's mini-episode, and by the way, if you haven't figured it out, there's a little joke at the end of last week's episode.

15:43.058 --> 15:50.220
[SPEAKER_05]: If you turned off the show before DarkSakura and I came back and talked about the Wii, you missed the last ten minutes of the show.

15:50.320 --> 15:50.940
[SPEAKER_00]: And we laugh at you.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.301
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we played a little gag.

15:52.621 --> 15:58.063
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most people probably figured it out because they probably saw the MP3 wasn't finished yet, but just in case you missed it,

15:58.483 --> 16:01.865
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, DarkSakura and I did talk about the Wii last week when Loki wasn't here.

16:02.445 --> 16:09.788
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things we talked about was the conspiracy theories going on on the internet that, oh, the Wii's not trademarked, so it can't be true.

16:10.129 --> 16:12.990
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all a viral gag campaign.

16:13.610 --> 16:15.011
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pulling your leg.

16:15.071 --> 16:17.272
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo's going to come out and announce the real name.

16:17.812 --> 16:18.873
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

16:19.493 --> 16:22.775
[SPEAKER_05]: This week, the Wii trademark did show up on the website.

16:23.935 --> 16:24.755
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's there.

16:24.795 --> 16:27.077
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to check the database for yourself, have fun.

16:27.317 --> 16:27.837
[SPEAKER_05]: W-I-I

16:29.542 --> 16:30.903
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has trademarked it.

16:31.883 --> 16:34.405
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually right up there on their site as a tab.

16:34.625 --> 16:41.248
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm sure that you guys will have crazy conspiracy theories that say, well it's still fake or whatever.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.590
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's going to be the name of the console, just deal with it.

16:44.670 --> 16:52.314
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most people are kind of backing off on the name now and waiting to see what the games are like, which is what we were saying all along last week.

16:53.034 --> 17:07.408
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the name does exactly what any type of name should do like I said last week the whole purpose you know things you should do when advertising anything is to have something simple something that people are going to remember and something that people are going to talk about and I think that they've accomplished that pretty well

17:09.370 --> 17:09.930
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fine.

17:10.191 --> 17:10.831
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we'll see.

17:11.251 --> 17:15.772
[SPEAKER_05]: The real test will be in a few days when we start seeing the games at E3.

17:16.293 --> 17:20.454
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki has a news article on some of the games we're going to be seeing on the Wii.

17:20.494 --> 17:22.675
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we'll see this at E3, but later on.

17:22.815 --> 17:23.135
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

17:23.775 --> 17:28.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Spider-Man 3, they're going to have a special version for it, which is not surprising.

17:28.977 --> 17:33.578
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, most of the games I think that are going to be ported to it are going to be having unique versions of it.

17:34.718 --> 17:35.959
[SPEAKER_03]: But got to report it, Spider-Man 3.

17:36.767 --> 17:37.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Unique version for the Wii.

17:38.229 --> 17:39.710
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that'd be pretty interesting.

17:41.532 --> 17:48.379
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think that ties in with something we talked about a while ago, where they're saying that they're going to have some web slinging you can do with the controller or something.

17:48.399 --> 17:49.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the same thing.

17:49.641 --> 17:52.744
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just me, or does all this control stuff sound too good to be true?

17:52.864 --> 17:59.311
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can't help it at this stage, I get flashbacks to the Power Glove, and I kind of go...

18:00.453 --> 18:04.575
[SPEAKER_05]: The Power Glove was a neat concept, but it wasn't really that great.

18:04.595 --> 18:07.436
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, technology has progressed, what, 15 years since then?

18:07.876 --> 18:11.838
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can't help but wonder, is it going to be accurate?

18:12.018 --> 18:15.919
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it really going to be as in the game as everyone says it is?

18:15.999 --> 18:17.300
[SPEAKER_05]: Better than the eye toy.

18:17.980 --> 18:18.440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.821
[SPEAKER_05]: And the eye toy is still kind of gimmicky to me, too.

18:21.261 --> 18:21.642
[SPEAKER_05]: So I...

18:23.783 --> 18:24.583
[SPEAKER_05]: Midway's Blitz The League

18:45.789 --> 18:48.650
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, whatever they're going to be calling it this time.

18:49.030 --> 18:54.252
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, it looks pretty cool, especially if they're going to be doing similar stuff to what Madden's going to be doing.

18:54.992 --> 18:58.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be a pretty good game, so looking forward to that.

18:59.353 --> 19:03.514
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, God knows what other stuff they're going to have coming out.

19:04.054 --> 19:05.995
[SPEAKER_03]: But Blitz League will be pretty cool.

19:08.507 --> 19:14.629
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole, like, throwing the football with the... That just... Oh, I can just see remotes going through TVs.

19:14.789 --> 19:25.412
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they have VAs doing their... They're having a passing and kicking demo, as well as a one-game demo for Madden 2007.

19:26.493 --> 19:27.793
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see how it's going to work.

19:28.633 --> 19:30.494
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting for, like, a game where...

19:31.314 --> 19:32.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Super Smash Bros.

19:32.315 --> 19:34.537
[SPEAKER_03]: or something like that where you start beating someone with a remote.

19:34.918 --> 19:36.219
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun.

19:37.060 --> 19:38.601
[SPEAKER_05]: Going over to our chat room for some comments.

19:38.821 --> 19:41.624
[SPEAKER_05]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.

19:43.376 --> 19:43.736
[SPEAKER_05]: Paraparaparadise

20:11.141 --> 20:11.641
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so bad.

20:36.445 --> 20:40.908
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, a series that you talk about a lot is coming to the Wii, right?

20:41.288 --> 20:41.669
Wii!

20:42.289 --> 20:45.051
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, you're probably the only person I know that still plays these games.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.713
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Dan does too, and a lot of our friends.

20:48.013 --> 20:49.834
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you two live happily ever after.

20:49.934 --> 20:52.416
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because we're old school, like that, yo.

20:53.517 --> 20:55.979
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Metal Slug is coming out on the Wii!

20:57.180 --> 20:59.021
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I was going to call it Wii from now on.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.154
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take bets on how long before that gets annoying.

21:02.334 --> 21:04.456
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you had right now, you just won.

21:04.976 --> 21:05.437
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

21:05.797 --> 21:06.097
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut up.

21:08.539 --> 21:11.202
[SPEAKER_00]: The Metal Slug Anthology is going to be out on the Wii.

21:12.743 --> 21:16.307
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be the 20 millionth release of Metal Slug whatever.

21:17.071 --> 21:18.272
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love Metal Slug.

21:18.292 --> 21:22.814
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is saying it's going to be the complete Metal Slug Arcade Edition with a bunch of bonus stuff.

21:23.134 --> 21:23.654
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

21:23.774 --> 21:29.157
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you use the Wii controller in a, quote, new and unique way.

21:29.577 --> 21:34.339
[SPEAKER_00]: But he didn't, you know, it was actually announced by Ben Herman, who's the president of SNK.

21:34.720 --> 21:35.640
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't give any details.

21:37.561 --> 21:42.904
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that's supposed to, I think, go hand in hand with the release of SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters.

21:43.184 --> 21:45.745
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll use the Wii controller too, you know.

21:46.226 --> 21:52.311
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw up your money that's going to be thrown into the fire because you're throwing away your money to buy this stupid game.

21:52.371 --> 21:58.636
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're put in mummy mode, do you like wave your Wii and puke or something?

21:58.916 --> 22:02.259
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you be able to use your Wii to actually make the graphics look next gen?

22:03.981 --> 22:04.401
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

22:04.461 --> 22:10.186
[SPEAKER_00]: If SNK really wanted to make us happy, they would freaking put out another Metal Slug on the Neo Geo.

22:11.291 --> 22:13.132
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us who have our Neo Geo's collecting dice.

22:13.172 --> 22:13.933
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not make me happy.

22:14.033 --> 22:14.754
[SPEAKER_03]: All three of you.

22:14.774 --> 22:16.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop making Metal Slug games.

22:16.295 --> 22:17.376
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there's not three of us.

22:17.396 --> 22:18.176
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at least five.

22:18.236 --> 22:22.519
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do an S&K Classic Collection or something like that and be done with it.

22:22.620 --> 22:24.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop re-releasing Metal Slug.

22:24.181 --> 22:25.021
[SPEAKER_03]: No one buys them.

22:25.262 --> 22:26.402
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I do.

22:27.823 --> 22:29.845
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but did you buy every single re-release of it?

22:29.865 --> 22:30.445
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes.

22:32.807 --> 22:33.828
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have them on our meme.

22:35.309 --> 22:38.872
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, what if, like, say that we have, like, the PlayStation hooked up one day?

22:39.810 --> 22:41.411
[SPEAKER_00]: I love SNK I love SNK almost as much as I love Sega

23:08.103 --> 23:08.803
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:39.052 --> 23:39.714
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that idea.

23:39.814 --> 23:40.516
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you know what?

23:40.757 --> 23:41.579
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me ammo.

23:42.318 --> 23:45.600
[SPEAKER_03]: No, what I want to do, I want to convert one of the ferrets into a rev mode.

23:45.801 --> 23:46.541
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be hilarious.

23:46.561 --> 23:47.041
[SPEAKER_03]: Great idea.

23:47.242 --> 23:47.802
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the ferret?

23:47.942 --> 23:48.222
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

23:48.242 --> 23:48.643
[SPEAKER_05]: We burned it.

23:49.003 --> 23:49.383
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

23:49.663 --> 23:50.204
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

23:50.564 --> 23:51.665
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting into a story here.

23:52.105 --> 23:53.546
[SPEAKER_05]: This was huge news this week.

23:53.726 --> 23:54.527
[SPEAKER_05]: Oblivion.

23:55.127 --> 23:57.049
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this the sequel to Hot Coffee?

23:57.089 --> 23:59.050
[SPEAKER_05]: This whole debacle going on on Oblivion.

23:59.070 --> 24:09.098
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have probably read about this, but if you've been living in a cave or you just avoid Oblivion news for whatever reason, the ESRB changed the rating of the PC version of Oblivion from T...

24:09.818 --> 24:13.182
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

24:27.785 --> 24:31.228
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the boobies were never meant to be accessed.

24:31.588 --> 24:34.290
[SPEAKER_05]: You were not allowed to have a topless character in Oblivion.

24:34.551 --> 24:36.752
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no up, up, down, down, left, right.

24:36.852 --> 24:39.074
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no code to get the boobies.

24:39.575 --> 24:43.818
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to do a third-party outside hack to put the boobies on.

24:44.218 --> 24:46.140
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of this third-party hack...

24:47.208 --> 24:55.911
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been exposed that the boobs were on the disc the whole time, and therefore this game is not safe for children, and it's slapped with an M rating.

24:56.331 --> 24:57.731
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my problem with this whole thing.

24:58.291 --> 25:12.336
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, I mean, that's just like saying, if I took, let's say, Care Bearers the movie, and I spliced in porn in there, and put that ISO on the internet, would they have to re-rate that movie X because I spliced in porn?

25:12.476 --> 25:14.976
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because the porn wasn't on the disc to begin with.

25:15.076 --> 25:16.617
[SPEAKER_05]: That, I believe, is the whole thing.

25:17.205 --> 25:21.347
[SPEAKER_00]: What about then in the case of The Rescuers with the sliced in nudie photo?

25:22.808 --> 25:23.308
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

25:23.408 --> 25:34.534
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was done at the animation studio and has been on every subsequent release except for the modern ones after these, you know, uptight anal retentive right-wing people decided to watch every frame and pick out stuff in it.

25:34.754 --> 25:37.215
[SPEAKER_05]: Or The Lion King where the stars spell out sex.

25:37.796 --> 25:37.976
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

25:38.056 --> 25:41.297
[SPEAKER_05]: Or in Aladdin where if you listen real carefully it goes, take your clothes off.

25:41.437 --> 25:45.179
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that was deemed to be fake and I found that out at Snopes.com, your website of the week.

25:45.199 --> 25:45.640
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Snopes.

25:45.700 --> 25:46.120
[SPEAKER_05]: However...

25:47.077 --> 25:49.500
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still, I mean, it looks like those stars do say sex.

25:49.640 --> 25:50.661
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you look at it real carefully.

25:50.681 --> 25:53.944
[SPEAKER_00]: You know Ronald McDonald's hair, it says hot, yummy, good.

25:54.284 --> 25:54.785
[SPEAKER_00]: It's serious.

25:55.606 --> 25:57.528
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's a very good, you know what though, that's a very good point.

25:57.568 --> 26:01.972
[SPEAKER_05]: The Rescuers wasn't made an R movie because, you know, it had that one frame of boobies in it.

26:02.292 --> 26:06.176
[SPEAKER_05]: But yet the games are, you know, damned for this.

26:06.777 --> 26:09.740
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing is, this is how I see it, you know.

26:10.785 --> 26:11.285
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloody Roar 3

26:41.580 --> 26:51.125
[SPEAKER_00]: had, if you use a cheat, a cheat whatever, you can pull up pictures that the game programmers did in of the characters in compromising positions.

26:52.406 --> 26:54.047
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, naked and doing stuff.

26:54.127 --> 26:56.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they really tried to sell that game despite the fact that it sucked.

26:57.108 --> 27:03.133
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people are saying that this is nothing like hot coffee, but I say this is exactly like hot coffee.

27:03.153 --> 27:03.633
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why?

27:03.714 --> 27:06.896
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that sex game was never meant to be found either.

27:06.956 --> 27:12.581
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on the disc, but I say it's the exact same thing that's happening between the two games.

27:14.242 --> 27:18.145
[SPEAKER_05]: Oblivion, the creators probably planned for there to be a topless character.

27:18.205 --> 27:18.945
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, why not?

27:19.005 --> 27:22.067
[SPEAKER_05]: If the game's violent, why not throw in a little nudity as well?

27:22.368 --> 27:27.291
[SPEAKER_05]: However, at some point during the beta or even the alpha testing, they decided, you know what?

27:27.351 --> 27:27.871
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad idea.

27:28.252 --> 27:30.633
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just take the pointer out to the textures.

27:30.974 --> 27:34.256
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easier to take the pointer out than to redo everything on the disc.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.923
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always said that's the exact same thing that happened with Hot Coffee.

27:37.943 --> 27:43.049
[SPEAKER_03]: The way they do clothing nowadays, it's just an actual object on top of an object.

27:43.169 --> 27:48.515
[SPEAKER_03]: So the textures are always there, it's just they're covered up by a clothing object.

27:48.835 --> 27:52.019
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just remove that clothing object, and there you go.

27:52.480 --> 27:53.681
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so irritated.

27:53.701 --> 27:55.363
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get pissed off about it with The Sims.

27:56.525 --> 27:58.066
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:18.380 --> 28:20.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Take Two Presents, or Rockstar Presents Table Tennis.

28:22.342 --> 28:25.543
[SPEAKER_00]: I blame all of those sexually repressed anal retentive people.

28:25.743 --> 28:27.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get into the follow-ups.

28:27.164 --> 28:28.985
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, Bethesda Responds.

28:29.265 --> 28:46.433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they respond, basically insist that a full and accurate comprehensive report of Oblivion's content was submitted to the ESRB before the game's release that included a 60-page document that detailed all explicit language, accents, scenes in the game.

28:46.980 --> 28:47.940
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29:16.601 --> 29:18.383
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, of course this news comes out.

29:18.723 --> 29:19.704
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what do they do?

29:19.844 --> 29:30.814
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, freaking California Assemblyman Leland Yee issued a press release calling on Take-Two and the ESRB to stop deceiving parents.

29:31.574 --> 29:41.063
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, and I quote, The ESRB again has failed our parents and it's clearly shown that they cannot police themselves.

29:41.772 --> 29:51.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Plain and simple, the current rating system is drastically flawed and here is yet another reason why we need legislation to assist parents and protect children.

29:51.919 --> 29:58.083
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, somebody didn't do their research at all before coming out and sounding like a complete jackass.

29:58.784 --> 30:00.225
[SPEAKER_03]: So, excellent.

30:02.607 --> 30:06.769
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, he was also one of the politicians to pick up on the hot coffee scandal.

30:07.550 --> 30:09.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments from chat room.

30:09.711 --> 30:10.072
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

30:11.363 --> 30:15.824
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf says, no, it was actually the way they did their 3D models.

30:16.104 --> 30:21.145
[SPEAKER_05]: The bra object was on top of the nudie object and you could not remove the bra object without a mod.

30:21.665 --> 30:24.066
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess the boobs were just there to make it more realistic.

30:24.506 --> 30:29.527
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, okay, so whatever, it was for a more complex reason.

30:29.607 --> 30:32.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, the boobies were not meant to be seen by themselves.

30:32.508 --> 30:35.948
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so like what if you have a movie and you have someone walk around in their undies?

30:36.509 --> 30:38.609
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they could have that edited off.

30:39.363 --> 30:40.023
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

30:40.204 --> 30:41.224
[SPEAKER_05]: Digital editing.

30:41.284 --> 30:42.866
[SPEAKER_05]: We could go back, you know, that scene with Tom Cruise.

30:42.886 --> 30:45.307
[SPEAKER_00]: Deleted scenes, pull off the, you know, stuff.

30:45.367 --> 30:47.509
[SPEAKER_05]: That scene with Tom Cruise from Risky Business.

30:47.569 --> 30:50.551
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we could just edit, digitally edit in a schlong, floppy floppy.

30:51.092 --> 30:52.873
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that going to get the movie re-rated NC-17?

30:53.153 --> 30:55.315
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes a lot of fangirls, I think.

30:55.735 --> 30:56.756
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what was that movie?

30:57.296 --> 31:19.962
[SPEAKER_05]: where if you freeze frame it at just the right point you can see his schlong and that happens in movies all the time where like you know you might see a titty or you might see a schlong if you pause it at just the right moment there's several movies that are like that exactly or you know like in Austin Powers there's a scene where with what's her name Elizabeth Hurley where he moves like the piece of fruit at just the wrong time and you can see the red tape over her

31:21.809 --> 31:23.130
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually was pointed out to me, by the way.

31:23.431 --> 31:26.954
[SPEAKER_05]: Arsef in the chatroom says, Leland Yee is a respectable man, I suppose.

31:26.994 --> 31:30.557
[SPEAKER_05]: He just needs to learn what the hell he's talking about before he blasts video games, it seems.

31:31.298 --> 31:37.603
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree 100% with that statement applied to about 99% of politicians out there right now.

31:37.704 --> 31:39.045
[SPEAKER_05]: Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter.

31:39.325 --> 31:41.247
[SPEAKER_05]: They all need to do their research on this subject.

31:41.547 --> 31:41.947
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

31:42.027 --> 31:44.530
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind them coming after if an actual...

31:45.171 --> 32:06.104
[SPEAKER_03]: company out there, like, say, for example, we were to find out tomorrow that EA, you know, with Sims 2, purposefully left in, you know, nudity and, say, there's child sex in the game or something like that, you know, then, yes, then they need to come after them and say, okay, you need to re-rate this and you probably need to remove this content.

32:06.524 --> 32:14.109
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, you know, if this wasn't meant to be in the game and someone added it in with a third-party, you know, patch or hack,

32:14.690 --> 32:15.458
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a little different.

32:15.479 --> 32:16.792
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to do their research.

32:18.891 --> 32:22.333
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, the gaming community is getting a little ticked off, too.

32:22.894 --> 32:24.855
[SPEAKER_05]: Specifically, we have John Romero.

32:24.895 --> 32:27.557
[SPEAKER_05]: You know him as one of the co-founders of ID Software.

32:28.237 --> 32:36.063
[SPEAKER_05]: He went off on his blog about this whole re-rating fiasco, and he was saying modders are not screwing up the industry.

32:36.103 --> 32:37.404
[SPEAKER_05]: They're supposed to be helping.

32:39.245 --> 32:47.891
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically just saying that he fears that developers are going to have to basically make their games tougher to hack to avoid these re-rating incidents in the future.

32:48.658 --> 32:51.360
[SPEAKER_05]: So, he's kind of... Oh, I'm sorry.

32:51.380 --> 32:52.541
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I say modders or not?

32:52.601 --> 32:55.403
[SPEAKER_05]: Modders are now screwing up the industry that they're supposed to be helping.

32:55.764 --> 32:57.605
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought when I read that, it sounded a little different when I first read that.

32:57.845 --> 33:00.007
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, modders are now screwing up the industry they're supposed to be helping.

33:00.387 --> 33:04.030
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know... They've been doing this crap for years, though.

33:04.210 --> 33:04.430
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

33:04.490 --> 33:14.578
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, there's actually... There was a Game Boy hack rom for the Legend of Zelda game that was on that where Link looked like a little troll and was carrying around a giant...

33:15.174 --> 33:15.495
[SPEAKER_00]: Penis.

33:16.036 --> 33:16.637
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's interesting?

33:16.677 --> 33:19.823
[SPEAKER_05]: What was one of the first games that everybody and their mom was hacking?

33:20.244 --> 33:20.584
[SPEAKER_05]: Doom?

33:21.246 --> 33:21.646
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

33:22.849 --> 33:25.273
[SPEAKER_00]: There were even games that were released, though, that were like that.

33:25.714 --> 33:27.678
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they weren't usually sanctioned, but hey.

33:30.097 --> 33:32.239
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what pisses me off most about this?

33:32.299 --> 33:34.521
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I'm getting a little political here, but I don't care.

33:35.162 --> 33:38.325
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the big deal about a couple of boobs?

33:38.966 --> 33:39.847
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

33:40.407 --> 33:43.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Oblivion is a really violent game.

33:43.090 --> 33:43.851
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there's a lot.

33:43.871 --> 33:45.052
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even have to pick on Oblivion.

33:45.072 --> 33:48.195
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of very, very violent video games out there.

33:48.756 --> 33:51.799
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet it takes a set of boobs to get your game rated M?

33:52.139 --> 33:52.760
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a theory.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.643
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get this at all.

33:54.683 --> 33:56.726
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just my rant on society.

33:57.487 --> 34:00.451
[SPEAKER_05]: I may not be a father yet, but someday I hope to.

34:00.511 --> 34:05.078
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that one of the ways I plan to raise my kid is that I would...

34:05.879 --> 34:07.260
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34:31.403 --> 34:40.942
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind also, you know, from the average child perspective, the thing that you cannot do becomes all the more attractive, you know?

34:42.384 --> 35:11.222
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that they either you know with this type of environment with that much repression of what they see they're either going to grow up to be really fucked up in the head is what I think you know not knowing the right way to do things not knowing the reality because there was as an example one of my friends her best friend growing up was not allowed to watch the news was not allowed to watch violent movies was not allowed to watch anything that wasn't G-rated when she graduated high school she had no idea how the world worked

35:12.697 --> 35:17.139
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't learn anything from her friends because she grew up in such a sheltered environment.

35:17.499 --> 35:19.540
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't allowed to go out or anything.

35:20.160 --> 35:25.082
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's interesting, too, and I promise we'll get back on games in a minute here, but you notice in movies... Okay, go ahead.

35:25.442 --> 35:31.504
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just my example on this is that she thought that oral sex was just talking about it.

35:33.453 --> 35:34.093
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm serious.

35:35.374 --> 35:36.454
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's an example.

35:36.514 --> 35:36.814
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it.

35:36.874 --> 35:48.739
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm afraid that if things like this are allowed to happen, we're going to see more kids growing up without having any type of concept of what the world is like or how to interact or anything like that.

35:48.819 --> 35:54.021
[SPEAKER_05]: You ever notice this about violent movies, that in violent movies, a lot of times the person causing the violence is the hero?

35:54.101 --> 35:58.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you look at The Terminator, an incredibly violent movie, but you cheer on Arnold.

35:58.182 --> 36:00.403
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, yeah, kick some ass, blow those guys up.

36:00.663 --> 36:01.464
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

36:21.385 --> 36:23.587
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really thinking that we've got this sort of vicious cycle going on.

36:23.967 --> 36:25.368
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, okay, think about it.

36:25.408 --> 36:25.789
[SPEAKER_05]: The more...

36:36.940 --> 36:38.302
[SPEAKER_00]: The government steps in.

36:39.223 --> 36:43.827
[SPEAKER_00]: This has actually been something that's happened, I'd say, since the late 80s, that we've seen the government stepping in.

36:44.568 --> 36:51.916
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring this up as a point, and it also is more jackass involved in it, but the whole cop killer thing, remember that?

36:52.536 --> 36:55.699
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, he was also the one responsible for the whole Two Life crew business.

36:56.220 --> 36:56.740
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that?

36:57.341 --> 37:04.847
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind that since we've had this cycle of going through, of having the government step in and try to say, hey, you know, you can't do that.

37:04.867 --> 37:05.327
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bad.

37:05.387 --> 37:09.111
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen an increase in this type of game or this type of movie.

37:09.351 --> 37:13.354
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen people want more and more the more that other people say you can't have it.

37:14.475 --> 37:19.760
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and again, it is like Sakurina said, the forbidden fruit syndrome.

37:20.347 --> 37:21.287
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fully what it is.

37:21.508 --> 37:22.768
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that stays with you.

37:23.388 --> 37:25.669
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you can't have something, the more you want it.

37:25.729 --> 37:27.070
[SPEAKER_00]: The demand keeps growing.

37:28.010 --> 37:34.713
[SPEAKER_05]: This didn't make the show roll for tonight, but it just makes me think as well that I heard about there was some sex game that got banned from E3.

37:34.913 --> 37:40.475
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I don't have the story in front of me, but E3 said that some game couldn't be exhibited on the floor because it's mostly about sex.

37:40.495 --> 37:40.996
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Three Fields?

37:42.771 --> 37:43.772
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't that.

37:43.812 --> 37:48.556
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the lady that's very well known for her sex in the games.

37:48.736 --> 37:54.541
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure somebody in chat room is going to yell it out momentarily here, but they were banned from the E3 floor, and I'm thinking... Why?

37:54.841 --> 37:55.161
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

37:55.842 --> 37:57.143
[SPEAKER_00]: No one under 18 is allowed anyway.

37:57.163 --> 37:57.723
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.806
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they are, we freaking need to get them kicked out.

38:00.826 --> 38:03.248
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I don't get about the whole booth baby thing either.

38:03.288 --> 38:03.969
[SPEAKER_00]: Naughty America.

38:04.549 --> 38:05.510
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Naughty America.

38:05.590 --> 38:06.471
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I knew they'd yell it out.

38:06.731 --> 38:06.891
[SPEAKER_00]: But...

38:07.901 --> 38:16.726
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that it's very sad, you know, and we're really one of the few countries that are really focused on such, you know, repression.

38:16.766 --> 38:17.686
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really is.

38:18.446 --> 38:19.907
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a repressed society.

38:19.947 --> 38:23.329
[SPEAKER_00]: There are way too many people in power who are not getting the nookie or something.

38:24.069 --> 38:26.050
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they're getting it, it's all dry and stale.

38:26.230 --> 38:26.631
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

38:27.471 --> 38:28.952
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a worldwide audience, though.

38:29.012 --> 38:31.953
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, some folks are probably listening to us bitching going, you know.

38:32.093 --> 38:32.974
[SPEAKER_00]: We should start our own country.

38:34.764 --> 38:36.724
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we just need more political parties in this country.

38:36.805 --> 38:39.645
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've got plenty of political parties.

38:40.065 --> 38:44.306
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole issue, and I'm not meaning to get into a political rant, but you all know how I feel on this.

38:44.906 --> 38:50.588
[SPEAKER_00]: We have too many people who are not willing to move away from this bipartisan bullshit that we've got.

38:50.868 --> 38:51.208
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon me.

38:52.648 --> 38:53.649
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I feel about it.

38:53.669 --> 38:54.989
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel very strongly about this.

38:57.089 --> 39:03.811
[SPEAKER_00]: There are too many people who, when they vote for a certain politician, say for the presidential election, they vote straight ticket.

39:04.332 --> 39:05.953
[SPEAKER_00]: because they haven't taken the time to research.

39:06.354 --> 39:09.256
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not realize that they are the ones who have fucked this up for themselves.

39:09.677 --> 39:10.497
[SPEAKER_00]: It is their fault.

39:11.518 --> 39:14.141
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary voters in this country, it is your fault.

39:14.921 --> 39:15.662
[SPEAKER_00]: Educate yourself.

39:16.042 --> 39:16.603
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious.

39:17.162 --> 39:19.483
[SPEAKER_05]: You can send those cards and letters to mailbag at orangehoundsradio.com.

39:19.663 --> 39:20.784
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made no secret of this.

39:21.064 --> 39:34.431
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's because the people of this country keep putting these type of people in power that we see... I think that the majority of people enjoy being repressed and uninformed.

39:34.871 --> 39:43.236
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they like being ignorant because usually when you find out something... A friend of mine has a quote that says, the truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off.

39:44.440 --> 39:45.560
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting comment from the chat room.

39:45.640 --> 39:50.662
[SPEAKER_05]: Blaze says, Japan is much more open about sex and their rape rate is like less than 1% of all people.

39:52.142 --> 39:54.863
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where that quote is from, but it's an interesting comment.

39:55.443 --> 39:59.264
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually have a thing going on with a lot of wives while their husbands are out on business trips.

39:59.304 --> 40:00.805
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually a business arrangement.

40:01.245 --> 40:03.565
[SPEAKER_00]: They will basically sell their services.

40:05.206 --> 40:05.346
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

40:06.784 --> 40:17.030
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common for a man to have a mistress and have his wife because his mistress will be the one to engage him socially, whereas the wife will be the one to take care of the house and raise the kids and be the goddess of her domain.

40:18.691 --> 40:20.972
[SPEAKER_05]: And how does this tie into a boobies and oblivion again?

40:20.992 --> 40:21.973
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we got off subject.

40:22.873 --> 40:30.118
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the whole thing that it is these closed-minded, ignorant people who are...

40:30.846 --> 40:35.411
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through and wanting this type of thing taken out from mainstream availability.

40:35.792 --> 40:37.213
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need more of it, honestly.

40:37.934 --> 40:41.418
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if more people are seeing the boobies, they won't go out raping people.

40:42.887 --> 40:43.267
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

41:05.105 --> 41:06.025
[SPEAKER_05]: I like violence!

41:07.106 --> 41:10.426
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like this game very much because first person shooters make me nauseous.

41:10.906 --> 41:11.266
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally.

41:11.766 --> 41:14.627
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lot of people who are into these types of games.

41:15.427 --> 41:20.068
[SPEAKER_00]: The next Call of Duty game is not going to be out on the PC.

41:21.028 --> 41:27.849
[SPEAKER_00]: Activision is basically stating and I quote, it's not a PC product it's a console product and it's all next gen.

41:28.349 --> 41:31.370
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean that there's not going to be any more on the PC.

41:31.510 --> 41:32.430
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we did see

41:33.250 --> 41:55.554
[SPEAKER_00]: um other versions released on a PS2, Xbox, GameCube, Xbox 360 um but they are going to stick it so far strictly to the next-gen consoles um there was also a question going about if um Infinity Ward's doing this year's a console title themselves um for Call of Duty um and uh

41:58.084 --> 42:01.407
[SPEAKER_00]: That has actually been seen to be left unanswered so far.

42:03.089 --> 42:04.711
[SPEAKER_00]: They also released the big red one last year.

42:07.894 --> 42:09.376
[SPEAKER_00]: But no Call of Duty on your PC.

42:10.837 --> 42:13.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a lot of PC gamers out there who are very sad at that, but

42:14.750 --> 42:19.672
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, you know, it looks like developers, a lot of them are focusing their attention on console games.

42:19.772 --> 42:21.893
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, PC games, just kind of a different market.

42:21.933 --> 42:23.734
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a different type of game that's successful there.

42:24.114 --> 42:31.617
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually, though, a really good first-person shooter making it out onto the Xbox 360.

42:32.318 --> 42:32.558
[SPEAKER_00]: Fear.

42:33.458 --> 42:34.118
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I heard about that.

42:34.298 --> 42:37.320
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually found that out from my husband today.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.481
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's pretty excited about that.

42:40.141 --> 42:41.722
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually going to be a good first-person shooter.

42:42.242 --> 42:42.382
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

42:43.438 --> 42:48.361
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we had a rumor last week about this, but we got confirmation.

42:48.401 --> 42:48.781
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?

42:49.121 --> 42:51.022
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's sort of confirmation.

42:51.742 --> 43:02.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, according to an EB Games employee, Nintendo has sent posters including a blank GameCube-branded new low-price sticker.

43:02.607 --> 43:04.328
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, they're getting the POP now.

43:05.075 --> 43:06.036
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is Tuesday, right?

43:06.056 --> 43:07.037
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

43:33.963 --> 43:34.323
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

43:34.363 --> 43:38.449
[SPEAKER_05]: With all the Wii excitement, I guess GameCube will just be kind of a budget thing.

43:38.469 --> 43:40.192
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, let's get the kids one for their room.

43:40.432 --> 43:41.313
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the 64 is.

43:44.255 --> 43:47.216
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they still have Nintendo 64 at McDonald's, some of them.

43:47.236 --> 43:54.258
[SPEAKER_05]: They still advertise them on little... Like when I was in LA, I drove by a McDonald's that actually still was advertising the Nintendo 64 on one of their things.

43:54.298 --> 43:55.238
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was very interesting.

43:55.418 --> 43:56.498
[SPEAKER_00]: That is hilarious.

43:57.319 --> 44:00.660
[SPEAKER_05]: Which might explain why you don't see Los Angeles on this list.

44:00.860 --> 44:01.200
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

44:01.260 --> 44:04.741
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the top video game cities in America.

44:05.221 --> 44:10.142
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a survey commissioned by Sperling for Best Places and Microsoft.

44:10.622 --> 44:12.643
[SPEAKER_05]: It rated Seattle, Washington...

44:13.363 --> 44:15.465
[SPEAKER_05]: as the top video game city in America

44:29.662 --> 44:34.166
[SPEAKER_05]: The other top ten, number ten, Philadelphia, number nine, San Diego, number eight, Boston, number seven, St.

44:34.206 --> 44:34.306
[SPEAKER_05]: Louis.

44:52.003 --> 44:53.784
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 6, Washington, D.C.

44:53.884 --> 45:00.166
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 5, Phoenix, Mesa Number 4, Detroit Number 3, Hotlanta Number 2, Minneapolis, St.

45:00.226 --> 45:20.895
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul And number 1, of course, Seattle Our close-by neighbor, San Francisco, is number 14 But here in Sacramento, we don't make the cut That's because they didn't interview me and Dan Neither does Los Angeles, which I find very interesting Los Angeles does not make the cut as well I wonder if it would have tilted it in Sacramento's favor If they had actually interviewed me and Dan That would have been hilarious

45:22.605 --> 45:23.426
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows, who knows.

45:23.726 --> 45:29.950
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, for every you and Dan, there's 100,000 people that don't own any systems, so you just have to remember.

45:32.172 --> 45:33.493
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting comment from the chatroom there.

45:33.553 --> 45:38.457
[SPEAKER_05]: Funnydale says, Seattle is number one only because everyone has to stay inside because it always rains.

45:39.617 --> 45:39.838
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

45:40.378 --> 45:40.978
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting point.

45:41.759 --> 45:44.041
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have the highest precipitation rate in the country.

45:44.481 --> 45:46.082
[SPEAKER_05]: It does have a pretty high suicide rate, too.

45:47.423 --> 45:47.703
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

45:47.844 --> 45:48.064
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

45:49.491 --> 45:50.271
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to make it morbid.

45:51.212 --> 45:55.854
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's going to tell us about a nice, fun, happy game to take our minds off of that.

45:56.134 --> 45:56.954
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

45:57.594 --> 46:01.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot Pixel is a new game by Atari for the PSP.

46:01.576 --> 46:02.996
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be just like WarioWare.

46:03.016 --> 46:06.018
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to feature hundreds of tiny five-second games.

46:06.478 --> 46:10.079
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have pictures of this on our E3 on the PSP website, by the way.

46:10.840 --> 46:12.240
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks pretty cool.

46:12.580 --> 46:14.001
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just lots of weird stuff.

46:14.041 --> 46:18.143
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all going to have kind of an urban spin on it.

46:18.283 --> 46:19.243
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to have a lot of

46:20.149 --> 46:21.190
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital Street Culture

46:38.359 --> 46:41.402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be another minigame type of thing, also for the PSP.

46:42.483 --> 46:43.804
[SPEAKER_03]: That one should be pretty interesting too.

46:43.864 --> 46:45.245
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm looking forward to checking this out.

46:45.265 --> 46:49.488
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have this actually at E3, I believe, and it's due out this fall.

46:49.849 --> 46:50.229
[SPEAKER_05]: I like this.

46:50.810 --> 46:57.375
[SPEAKER_05]: In our chatroom, DJ Janai says, will they make it, since this is on the PSP, will they make a game called Dead Pixel?

46:58.316 --> 46:58.616
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

46:59.397 --> 47:00.918
[SPEAKER_05]: Because PSP has had the Dead Pixels?

47:01.879 --> 47:02.159
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

47:02.339 --> 47:02.579
[SPEAKER_05]: Winner.

47:03.479 --> 47:05.221
[SPEAKER_05]: Comedy in Orange Lounge chat.

47:05.601 --> 47:06.322
[SPEAKER_05]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

47:06.342 --> 47:08.244
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if that should go in the toilet paper joke book.

47:09.724 --> 47:13.065
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're also going to find some comedy in our mailbag right now.

47:13.105 --> 47:15.706
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I don't know if there's any funny stuff in there, but we'll soon find out.

47:16.246 --> 47:26.290
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura picks out her favorites and brings them to us here on Orange Lounge Radio Live each and every week.

47:26.650 --> 47:31.272
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's actually been a little while since we've dived into the mailbag, so we're going to go in there right now.

47:32.152 --> 47:34.213
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, put on your rubber gloves.

47:35.093 --> 47:35.654
[SPEAKER_00]: Dig in there.

47:35.674 --> 47:36.614
[SPEAKER_00]: I need asbestos this time.

47:36.814 --> 47:37.574
[SPEAKER_05]: Pull something out.

47:38.715 --> 47:38.775
[SPEAKER_00]: Ew!

47:39.710 --> 47:45.675
[SPEAKER_00]: Mailbag at OrangeOnlineRadio.com We actually got a really cool email from Zohar, who is one of our Serbian listeners.

47:46.776 --> 47:55.243
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to a little bit of silliness that we had last week regarding ActionScript.org Yeah, weren't we talking about the different translations over there?

47:55.263 --> 47:57.445
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a Serbian translation available, which I was like...

47:58.683 --> 47:58.863
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

47:59.523 --> 48:03.165
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we made an offhanded comment that like, you know, if you need that.

48:03.386 --> 48:08.889
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was cool, but it struck me as very strange because it's the only technical site I've seen with Serbian translation on it.

48:09.129 --> 48:11.930
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was cool, but I was like, that's so random.

48:12.070 --> 48:13.591
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was how I thought.

48:14.432 --> 48:16.913
[SPEAKER_05]: So hope we didn't offend any of our Serbian listeners.

48:16.953 --> 48:18.194
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just kind of surprised.

48:18.274 --> 48:20.835
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually, you know, Spanish, not so surprising when you're here.

48:21.555 --> 48:24.137
[SPEAKER_05]: Russian, Japanese, you know, Serbian?

48:25.060 --> 48:25.641
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so common.

48:26.041 --> 48:31.845
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most of the time, if there's going to be a site like that, it's either going to already be strictly for that region.

48:32.766 --> 48:38.110
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to read this email, speaking of actionscript.org being in Serbian, I wanted to mention that I am a Serbian listener.

48:38.551 --> 48:42.994
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say that you guys probably have a lot of listeners in many different races from many different countries.

48:43.455 --> 48:46.697
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how many Serbian listeners you have, but I just wanted to say that I am one of them.

48:47.058 --> 48:49.359
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that one day everybody in the world will be listening to OLR.

48:49.940 --> 48:50.520
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, that's cute.

48:50.540 --> 48:51.361
[SPEAKER_05]: That was very sweet.

48:51.421 --> 48:51.921
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad...

48:52.847 --> 48:55.729
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not upset over the comment because we didn't mean it offensively.

48:55.809 --> 48:57.490
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we certainly didn't mean it that way.

48:57.590 --> 48:59.812
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just random.

49:00.632 --> 49:02.233
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an email.

49:02.253 --> 49:07.337
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a response to an email complaining about the Wii.

49:07.837 --> 49:09.298
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what children call urine.

49:11.079 --> 49:11.860
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go again.

49:12.601 --> 49:19.125
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give this author the benefit of the doubt that the email was written like one or two days after the announcement when those jokes weren't old yet.

49:19.285 --> 49:20.426
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sent by BearWhoDriveCar.

49:21.480 --> 49:22.101
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

49:35.925 --> 49:37.987
[SPEAKER_00]: console names in video game history.

49:38.388 --> 49:39.589
[SPEAKER_00]: My vote, Dreamcast best.

49:40.229 --> 49:46.936
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had actually replied saying my personal favorite system name is probably Dreamcast as well, although I like PC Engine Duo.

49:46.996 --> 49:47.536
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sounds cool.

49:47.556 --> 49:48.577
[SPEAKER_00]: It rolls off the tongue, you know.

49:49.078 --> 49:52.261
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst ever, Fairchild Channel F, which is also a horrible system.

49:53.182 --> 49:54.703
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Pico, which makes me think of Salsa.

49:54.964 --> 49:55.144
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

49:57.042 --> 50:10.599
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I got a response back it says also I have not heard one female call into your show nor one female guest come on the show since you started taking calls and doing interviews being the only vocal female representation that OLR at least in podcast form presents

50:11.332 --> 50:15.894
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel an increased sense of responsibility, DarkSakura, in being the honorary estrogen ambassador?

50:16.034 --> 50:16.614
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.

50:16.994 --> 50:18.455
[SPEAKER_05]: The estrogen ambassador?

50:18.755 --> 50:24.097
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the awareness of this problem will motivate you to include a segment to promote female awareness on your fine program.

50:24.437 --> 50:28.239
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys have discussed the problems and stereotypes that male gamers have toward female gamers.

50:28.559 --> 50:29.879
[SPEAKER_00]: I say the power is yours.

50:30.440 --> 50:32.680
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've actually been sort of working on something like that.

50:32.700 --> 50:34.041
[SPEAKER_00]: Just school's kicking my ass.

50:34.341 --> 50:34.521
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

50:34.761 --> 50:36.923
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had Roz called in just a couple weeks ago, didn't we?

50:37.163 --> 50:37.704
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had Roz.

50:37.744 --> 50:39.205
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had Mistress Tia.

50:39.445 --> 50:40.085
[SPEAKER_05]: Mistress Tia.

50:40.105 --> 50:41.606
[SPEAKER_00]: She's not necessarily a gamer.

50:41.707 --> 50:42.267
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

50:42.607 --> 50:44.288
[SPEAKER_00]: But she definitely has estrogen.

50:44.829 --> 50:51.294
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the girls were on the program before we switched over to this new format where our live show is being podcast.

50:51.614 --> 50:54.816
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we were doing the podcast for the first year, we never had special guests.

50:55.817 --> 50:57.638
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had DDR Angel.

50:57.758 --> 51:00.801
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Iguana Girl, Mistress Tia.

51:00.941 --> 51:02.442
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just been a while.

51:03.282 --> 51:06.605
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to kidnap a few more of my female... We've had Julie.

51:07.385 --> 51:07.565
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

51:08.006 --> 51:09.387
[SPEAKER_05]: But get Iguana Girl on the show.

51:09.807 --> 51:11.168
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know she's a gamer too.

51:11.368 --> 51:12.048
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know she's been busy.

51:12.168 --> 51:16.772
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also... Well, she didn't come on the show because it was my birthday thing the other week.

51:17.152 --> 51:21.255
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll have to bring my good friend Disney Punk 10 up here.

51:21.515 --> 51:21.675
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

51:21.935 --> 51:25.918
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she's into Kingdom Hearts and a lot of the same games that I do.

51:26.859 --> 51:28.540
[SPEAKER_05]: Best console name and worst console name?

51:28.780 --> 51:29.881
[SPEAKER_05]: I have answers, I think.

51:30.681 --> 51:36.785
[SPEAKER_05]: Best console name, you know, I know you might find this a little silly, but I actually really like the name Jaguar for a system.

51:36.825 --> 51:37.766
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was kind of cool.

51:37.786 --> 51:38.427
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of cool.

51:38.547 --> 51:40.508
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though the system itself kind of stuck.

51:40.628 --> 51:42.429
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have the best version of Tempest.

51:43.110 --> 51:44.991
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst console name, Philips CDI.

51:45.251 --> 51:46.512
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that doesn't tell me anything.

51:46.532 --> 51:47.453
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's not very imaginative.

51:47.473 --> 51:48.353
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't tell me anything.

51:48.574 --> 51:49.694
[SPEAKER_00]: It plays CDs.

51:51.195 --> 51:52.016
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you want to add to that?

51:52.625 --> 51:54.787
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, because the Fairchild Channel left.

51:54.807 --> 51:57.889
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, why am I going to play a channel something?

51:58.349 --> 52:01.972
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also just a really piece of shit system.

52:02.052 --> 52:04.574
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another one I thought had a really good name, though, was The Odyssey 2.

52:05.835 --> 52:08.036
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like, ooh, it's a gaming journey.

52:09.137 --> 52:11.699
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1978, when I was two years old.

52:12.059 --> 52:12.720
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the math, kids.

52:16.202 --> 52:16.582
[SPEAKER_05]: More mail.

52:16.863 --> 52:17.223
[SPEAKER_00]: More mail.

52:18.043 --> 52:18.524
[SPEAKER_00]: I like mail.

52:19.244 --> 52:20.125
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like mail.

52:23.062 --> 52:33.988
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an email from Rob, who sends a link found on Dig, which I am going to open at this time because I sort of didn't.

52:34.509 --> 52:37.951
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the unluckiest Xbox 360 owner.

52:38.231 --> 52:39.572
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God, I heard about this guy.

52:40.629 --> 52:45.432
[SPEAKER_00]: who apparently has kept getting a broken system.

52:45.913 --> 52:48.094
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's name is Chris Zarek.

52:50.396 --> 52:58.001
[SPEAKER_00]: He purchased... He's actually on his fourth Xbox 360 because of quality issues with earlier machines.

53:01.324 --> 53:05.527
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a... Actually, it's something very interesting that was...

53:07.004 --> 53:09.125
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice summary that was posted by Rob in this email.

53:09.445 --> 53:14.328
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, number one, 5% customer failure, dissatisfaction rate.

53:14.908 --> 53:16.089
[SPEAKER_00]: One bad system, one in 20.

53:16.169 --> 53:17.949
[SPEAKER_00]: Two bad systems, one in 400.

53:18.350 --> 53:19.490
[SPEAKER_00]: Three systems, one in 8,000.

53:20.071 --> 53:24.953
[SPEAKER_00]: To get three in a row that had faulty issues with it?

53:26.326 --> 53:28.107
[SPEAKER_03]: God, and I was pissed when I got the one.

53:28.447 --> 53:32.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you either have to be, you know, really lucky or a really big liar.

53:32.288 --> 53:33.609
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the blinking red lights.

53:33.649 --> 53:34.929
[SPEAKER_03]: Go buy a lottery ticket, dude.

53:34.969 --> 53:36.750
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm calling bullshit on this story.

53:36.790 --> 53:38.270
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's a fucking liar.

53:38.411 --> 53:38.851
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

53:38.991 --> 53:42.672
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're sitting with him with the last Xbox and the games.

53:42.772 --> 53:47.514
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he took all the worst possible case scenarios and just made up a damn story about it.

53:47.534 --> 53:52.896
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I'm seeing on here, I think every one of them had the blinking red light issue where it wouldn't turn on.

53:53.096 --> 53:53.256
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

53:53.621 --> 53:53.981
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

54:24.788 --> 54:37.095
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there was an article that he also sent me from Slashdot about what your next generation system preference says about you.

54:39.316 --> 54:40.216
[SPEAKER_05]: What if I want it all?

54:40.256 --> 54:41.217
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that just make me greedy?

54:41.980 --> 54:42.900
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it makes you very greedy.

54:43.160 --> 54:44.060
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm really greedy.

54:45.041 --> 54:54.422
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study done with the IGN people that says 36% claim loyalty to the PlayStation 3, 28% to the Xbox 360, 22% are interested in the Wii.

54:55.122 --> 54:56.703
[SPEAKER_00]: Undecided gamers are a minority.

54:56.763 --> 54:58.943
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 4% have not decided.

54:59.483 --> 55:03.924
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also lifestyle decisions that are associated with that.

55:07.845 --> 55:09.425
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to go off this chart here.

55:10.726 --> 55:19.829
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who were undecided PS3 and 360, for their favorite handheld is the PSP.

55:20.509 --> 55:22.309
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who are buying the Wii, it's the DS.

55:23.109 --> 55:32.212
[SPEAKER_05]: No shock there, because in order to have put down the Wii when we have not really seen the system at all in any way, you would have to be a Nintendo fanboy.

55:33.092 --> 55:35.073
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what band do you enjoy most listening to?

55:35.093 --> 55:35.993
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part I like.

55:36.613 --> 55:39.314
[SPEAKER_00]: The Undecided Group and the Wii Group both are Gorillaz fans.

55:41.409 --> 55:44.832
[SPEAKER_00]: PS3 owners listen to Eminem and Xbox 360 owners listen to Nirvana.

55:47.354 --> 55:48.655
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite TV drama?

55:48.675 --> 55:52.177
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that means I ain't getting a PS3 because I'm not a big Eminem fan.

55:52.218 --> 55:53.098
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other two are fine.

55:53.118 --> 55:54.539
[SPEAKER_05]: But Eminem, I'm not a big fan of him.

55:54.559 --> 55:55.600
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just statistical data.

55:56.221 --> 55:57.361
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite TV drama?

55:58.002 --> 56:00.744
[SPEAKER_00]: Undecided and Xbox 360 are like lost.

56:01.244 --> 56:02.485
[SPEAKER_00]: PS3 owners like 24.

56:03.246 --> 56:06.689
[SPEAKER_00]: And we potential owners are looking for Smallville.

56:08.890 --> 56:10.872
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Smallville is actually decent.

56:11.371 --> 56:14.393
[SPEAKER_00]: Some episodes are kind of crap, but Lex is cute.

56:15.633 --> 56:17.934
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I'm just shaking my head over here.

56:18.175 --> 56:18.955
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm trying to read.

56:19.015 --> 56:20.956
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that whole WB thing.

56:21.977 --> 56:24.978
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions is, do you own a TiVo or digital video recorder?

56:24.998 --> 56:29.300
[SPEAKER_00]: 19% were in the Undecided group, 29% were in the PS3 group, 32% were in the Xbox 360 group, and the Wii group was 24.

56:29.400 --> 56:30.161
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two more sections.

56:35.471 --> 56:37.132
[SPEAKER_00]: have you been to the movies in the last 30 days?

56:37.212 --> 56:44.697
[SPEAKER_00]: the greatest group of these were the PS3 and Xbox 360 players at 64 and 61% respectively and the last is do you own an iPod?

56:45.178 --> 57:01.530
[SPEAKER_05]: and the majority of those were the Xbox 360 group minimum actually a tie between Undecided and PS3 I still think although it's interesting I call BS on this survey because it leaves no room for the people who are still on the fence and considering how little we know there was an Undecided group

57:02.615 --> 57:12.139
[SPEAKER_05]: Considering how little we know about PlayStation 3 and Wii, you're basically asking, whose fanboy are you?

57:12.279 --> 57:13.780
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo.

57:13.800 --> 57:14.580
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you're asking.

57:14.600 --> 57:17.682
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the only one of those systems you can really say you know something about is the 360.

57:19.522 --> 57:23.724
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, the vast majority of people are still relatively uninformed.

57:24.925 --> 57:27.606
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like...

57:28.786 --> 57:30.286
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going over to our chat room for a comment.

57:30.346 --> 57:34.928
[SPEAKER_00]: TigerClaw wants to know, speaking of Smallville, have you guys seen the new Superman Returns trailer?

57:34.948 --> 57:37.148
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I'm hoping that this guy doesn't die or break his neck or fall to the curse.

57:37.168 --> 57:37.388
[SPEAKER_00]: BILLIONS!

57:59.329 --> 57:59.589
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

58:23.334 --> 58:24.416
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, LLR, love the show.

58:24.456 --> 58:25.077
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick question.

58:25.658 --> 58:29.605
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the store the other day and saw a network adapter for the Nintendo GameCube.

58:29.665 --> 58:30.727
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is this for?

58:32.330 --> 58:32.850
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much.

58:33.131 --> 58:33.611
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot.

58:34.291 --> 58:36.032
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even a good paperweight because it doesn't weigh much.

58:36.613 --> 58:42.536
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to play PSO on your GameCube, or not, yeah, PSO, I wanted to say PSU, but that's the new game.

58:42.957 --> 58:46.059
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to play PSO on your GameCube, that's the reason to have one.

58:46.159 --> 58:55.445
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, this will do nothing for you because Nintendo did not support internet gaming very well with the GameCube, and that's what I say killed them in the competition.

58:55.465 --> 59:00.708
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's very funny given that they had the Satellaview back in the day in Japan.

59:00.728 --> 59:00.808
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

59:00.908 --> 59:03.489
[SPEAKER_05]: However, using PSO, you could browse the internet, right?

59:03.689 --> 59:04.429
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

59:04.449 --> 59:05.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I remember right?

59:05.410 --> 59:11.912
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they had an actual browsing disk, though, for the GameCube.

59:11.952 --> 59:14.153
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of the other systems, they actually release browser disks.

59:14.193 --> 59:17.835
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, honestly, though, PSO on the GameCube is worthless.

59:17.995 --> 59:21.276
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox version is superior, mostly because of the voice chat.

59:22.136 --> 59:23.637
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other items in the GameCube one.

59:24.994 --> 59:26.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Which are all on Blue Burst.

59:26.658 --> 59:29.305
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a big fan of the Nintendo version.

59:29.325 --> 59:32.633
[SPEAKER_05]: There's other things I like about the GameCube, don't get me wrong, but PSO's not one of them.

59:33.337 --> 59:34.197
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have one more email.

59:34.497 --> 59:34.777
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

59:35.097 --> 59:39.458
[SPEAKER_00]: From, I guess it's Durley, is how it would be pronounced.

59:40.638 --> 59:41.679
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, love the show.

59:41.759 --> 59:44.979
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, a couple of shows back, you guys talked about a Silent Hill fan film.

59:45.439 --> 59:46.659
[SPEAKER_00]: Any idea where I can get that?

59:46.739 --> 59:47.660
[SPEAKER_00]: Any help would be great.

59:48.140 --> 59:51.020
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is a busy week, so just drop me a line later if you can.

59:51.140 --> 59:51.400
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

59:52.260 --> 59:53.641
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can find it on YouTube.

59:54.541 --> 59:55.741
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find everything on YouTube.

59:56.461 --> 01:00:00.722
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can actually download the DVD-I, so from, I don't even remember the site now.

01:00:01.661 --> 01:00:05.624
[SPEAKER_03]: If you search for, was it Silent Hill No Escape?

01:00:06.004 --> 01:00:07.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you should be able to find it.

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:09.747
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty decently done.

01:00:09.927 --> 01:00:10.928
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was very neat.

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.450
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't want to bother with download, it's just on YouTube.

01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:15.331
[SPEAKER_00]: It's broken up into like seven parts.

01:00:16.712 --> 01:00:16.892
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:00:18.133 --> 01:00:19.054
[SPEAKER_00]: And watch the dog ending.

01:00:20.315 --> 01:00:20.615
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:00:21.416 --> 01:00:24.538
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangetonetrader.com Do it!

01:00:26.567 --> 01:00:30.409
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, Nintendo, big conference this week.

01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:33.210
[SPEAKER_03]: People are eagerly anticipating what they're going to say.

01:00:33.791 --> 01:00:43.796
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and if you can't make the conference, like us, you can watch it at the official World Store.

01:00:44.356 --> 01:00:46.197
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually going to be streaming it.

01:00:46.838 --> 01:00:50.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting at 12.30 Eastern to visitors who come in.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.421
[SPEAKER_03]: Space is limited, of course, so first come, first serve.

01:00:54.562 --> 01:01:04.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, of course, you can view it streaming on practically every other gaming site out there, including if you're in the area, you can watch at the E3 Outpost.

01:01:05.887 --> 01:01:06.447
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out.

01:01:07.253 --> 01:01:07.493
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:13.859
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I believe Scott over at All Games is doing something with GameTrailers.com with the Nintendo press conference.

01:01:14.159 --> 01:01:15.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're streaming a game trailer.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:20.264
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is interesting because that means that, like, you know, tons of people are streaming this Nintendo conference.

01:01:20.284 --> 01:01:23.987
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to, you know, it goes to show how immediate...

01:01:24.387 --> 01:01:28.210
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people want their news now with this Wii stuff, so this is interesting.

01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.871
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

01:01:29.591 --> 01:01:30.392
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be watching.

01:01:31.733 --> 01:01:40.740
[SPEAKER_05]: If they have it on a big screen at Outpost, which I'm told they're going to, I will be there with my butt parked in the front row couch ready to see this conference, so I'm very excited.

01:01:40.981 --> 01:01:42.962
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we're not good enough to get one of the magic tickets.

01:01:42.982 --> 01:01:43.903
[SPEAKER_03]: I got nothing else to do.

01:01:43.983 --> 01:01:53.431
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to grab McD's, grab some really fatty, something with bacon and eggs, and sit down and watch HDTV in a press conference.

01:01:53.491 --> 01:01:53.751

[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:02:13.619 --> 01:02:14.200
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:14.960
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a jerk.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.021
[SPEAKER_05]: He's neither lazy nor fat.

01:02:17.141 --> 01:02:18.162
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hair is gone.

01:02:18.342 --> 01:02:19.442
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks like a monkey.

01:02:19.782 --> 01:02:21.243
[SPEAKER_05]: You do look like a monkey.

01:02:21.283 --> 01:02:21.663
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

01:02:21.884 --> 01:02:24.505
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov got all his hair cut off today.

01:02:24.565 --> 01:02:25.846
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we call you Son Goku now?

01:02:26.206 --> 01:02:26.506
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

01:02:26.606 --> 01:02:27.146
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that sounds stupid.

01:02:27.166 --> 01:02:28.247
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was the Monkey King.

01:02:28.707 --> 01:02:30.189
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be a king of monkeys.

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:32.451
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't look that much like a monkey.

01:02:32.511 --> 01:02:33.412
[SPEAKER_05]: I like your hair short though.

01:02:33.452 --> 01:02:35.674
[SPEAKER_00]: So Loki doesn't want to be a duck and you don't want to be a monkey.

01:02:35.775 --> 01:02:38.217
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like your hair long because it made you look like a wet dog.

01:02:38.778 --> 01:02:40.199
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that it was cute long.

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.421
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a fan of long hair.

01:02:43.242 --> 01:02:43.943
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it too.

01:02:43.983 --> 01:02:45.805
[SPEAKER_04]: It was floppy in a cute way.

01:02:46.185 --> 01:02:46.726
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that word?

01:02:46.746 --> 01:02:47.386
[SPEAKER_04]: Magical.

01:02:47.487 --> 01:02:48.087
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that thing.

01:02:48.127 --> 01:02:48.668
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say it.

01:02:49.093 --> 01:02:50.034
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Detangler's for.

01:02:50.194 --> 01:02:54.719
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quickly, before we get back in the news, because we're running really long in this segment, we didn't start the show until very late tonight.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.181
[SPEAKER_05]: How's your gaming week going?

01:02:58.283 --> 01:03:01.186
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going fine.

01:03:02.087 --> 01:03:02.407
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:03:04.690 --> 01:03:06.892
[SPEAKER_04]: Any games of note that you've been playing that you want to share?

01:03:07.472 --> 01:03:09.535
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Final Fantasy XI a lot.

01:03:10.155 --> 01:03:12.016
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I've been... Added.

01:03:12.056 --> 01:03:13.756
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, because I didn't play at all.

01:03:15.017 --> 01:03:16.698
[SPEAKER_04]: And getting ready for E3.

01:03:17.378 --> 01:03:21.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, for those that may not know, we've been on the show... How could you not know by now?

01:03:21.879 --> 01:03:23.280
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we get new listeners every week, thank God.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:23.780
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my shirt say?

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he's wearing his Konami shirt today.

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:28.622
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mikotov actually works for Konami, but due to NDAs... They've branded you.

01:03:28.922 --> 01:03:33.484
[SPEAKER_05]: Due to NDAs, he can't share with us a whole lot of information, but... E3?

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:36.885
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there sure is E3.

01:03:37.145 --> 01:03:38.926
[SPEAKER_05]: We gonna have a good time at Konami's booth?

01:03:39.637 --> 01:03:41.238
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, depends on what you like.

01:03:42.439 --> 01:03:43.239
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he ain't budging.

01:03:43.979 --> 01:03:44.580
[SPEAKER_04]: He ain't budging.

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:47.481
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm going to have a good time at Nintendo's booth.

01:03:49.002 --> 01:03:49.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:49.923
[SPEAKER_04]: Why Nintendo?

01:03:49.983 --> 01:03:51.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I want to play the Wii.

01:03:51.384 --> 01:03:52.884
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not working at Konami's booth?

01:03:53.004 --> 01:03:56.366
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, but I'm going to have all the official Konami attire so I'll look like I'm working.

01:03:56.747 --> 01:03:59.908
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you ask me a question, I'm just going to lie and make something up.

01:03:59.948 --> 01:04:00.509
[SPEAKER_04]: You're bad.

01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:02.150
[SPEAKER_05]: Does your boss listen to this show?

01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:02.590
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope not.

01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:03.350
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:08.413
[SPEAKER_00]: We are having Metal Gear Solid 6 for the... For the Game Boy Advance.

01:04:10.237 --> 01:04:12.618
[SPEAKER_05]: We already told you what's going to be at Konami's booth anyway.

01:04:12.638 --> 01:04:13.798
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:04:14.118 --> 01:04:15.978
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, we had that story a few weeks ago?

01:04:15.998 --> 01:04:17.999
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but who says it's true?

01:04:18.979 --> 01:04:21.959
[SPEAKER_05]: The latest issue, Nintendo Power confirmed the... I got mine.

01:04:22.119 --> 01:04:25.800
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember even subscribing or ordering it, but they sent me one.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:29.221
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo Power confirmed the Portrait of Rune thing, but, Loki, you can throw this in now.

01:04:29.261 --> 01:04:31.281
[SPEAKER_05]: The Silent Hill thing may have actually been incorrect.

01:04:32.121 --> 01:04:34.182
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the name wrong, or they changed the name on me.

01:04:34.402 --> 01:04:35.702
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Konami trying to keep on...

01:04:36.052 --> 01:04:38.293
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep Me On My Toes, Joystick, Silent Hill Origins

01:05:01.207 --> 01:05:03.968
[SPEAKER_03]: Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin

01:05:27.249 --> 01:05:31.451
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what the big news is.

01:05:32.312 --> 01:05:33.512
[SPEAKER_00]: Silent Hill for the GameCom.

01:05:34.813 --> 01:05:35.794
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a GameCom?

01:05:36.294 --> 01:05:38.875
[SPEAKER_00]: A really piece of shit LCD system.

01:05:39.396 --> 01:05:41.297
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually happen to have one of those too.

01:05:41.797 --> 01:05:42.697
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta move on.

01:05:42.977 --> 01:05:45.719
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna be here through E3 because we'll be taping so long.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:51.142
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a brand new PlayStation 3 controller that's gonna be unveiled next week.

01:05:51.182 --> 01:05:55.184
[SPEAKER_05]: So those of you guys that love the boomerang PlayStation 3 controller, tear up.

01:05:55.644 --> 01:05:57.327
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to do, like, Batman cosplay with that.

01:05:57.347 --> 01:05:57.927
[SPEAKER_05]: Not gonna happen.

01:05:58.268 --> 01:06:06.438
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it says, the rumors abound that it's gonna be unveiled at Sony's press conference, which is Monday night, if I remember, or Monday afternoon.

01:06:06.779 --> 01:06:07.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Monday 4.

01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:09.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're on the road, so...

01:06:10.306 --> 01:06:13.548
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably just get into town right about the time that's going on.

01:06:13.788 --> 01:06:16.669
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have those available for download, though, so we'll watch it later.

01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:24.994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so no idea what it's going to look like, but they're saying that probably going to go back to a more DualShock-style look.

01:06:25.794 --> 01:06:26.554
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree.

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:28.996
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they are going to change something radically about it.

01:06:29.076 --> 01:06:30.897
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to look like a giant schlong.

01:06:31.697 --> 01:06:33.678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that boomerang thing was a little weird.

01:06:35.519 --> 01:06:38.421
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to look like Batman accessories.

01:06:39.021 --> 01:06:39.221
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:06:39.972 --> 01:06:40.673
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:06:57.077 --> 01:07:01.759
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega has posted their E3 lineup, except for the, of course, unannounced stuff.

01:07:01.779 --> 01:07:22.209
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have Chromehounds on Xbox 360, working title The Clubs on PS3, Xbox 360, Full Auto 2, Battle Lines, Medieval 2, Total War, Phantasy Star Universe on just about everything under the sun, Sega Rally, Sonic Rivals, Sonic the Hedgehog on PS3 and Xbox 360, Super Monkey Ball Adventure, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz on the Wii,

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:27.808
[SPEAKER_00]: Virtual Tennis 3, oh yay, for all you tennis fans out there, all three of you.

01:07:28.248 --> 01:07:32.029
[SPEAKER_00]: Whirlpool Championship 2007, and Yakuza on PS2.

01:07:32.389 --> 01:07:35.610
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega's a booth I'm definitely spending more time at this year than I did last year.

01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:37.591
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a pretty solid lineup, it sounds like.

01:07:37.611 --> 01:07:38.691
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they have the chairs.

01:07:39.891 --> 01:07:41.332
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, outside their theater or whatever?

01:07:41.352 --> 01:07:43.653
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no, the chairs that were in the theater.

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:45.333
[SPEAKER_00]: Comfy.

01:07:45.813 --> 01:07:50.735
[SPEAKER_00]: They had these big theater seats with, like, cup holders and crap, and they were, like, as big as...

01:07:51.397 --> 01:07:52.778
[SPEAKER_00]: The chair that's in the studio.

01:07:52.878 --> 01:07:58.760
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this theme with you at E3, and that is me and you always seem to pass out in very strange areas at E3.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:05.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I remember there was a picture of us, and I think we were sitting in the corner of some random booth in Kenshi Hall.

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:05.722
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega's room.

01:08:06.322 --> 01:08:07.963
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go to Sega's room.

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:10.544
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in one of the separate rooms.

01:08:10.624 --> 01:08:13.565
[SPEAKER_00]: It was freaking Acclaim's room.

01:08:13.625 --> 01:08:14.725
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we passed out there, too.

01:08:15.265 --> 01:08:17.186
[SPEAKER_00]: And drinking Coke, the free Coke that was there.

01:08:18.701 --> 01:08:21.143
[SPEAKER_05]: And I found... It's all about food and napkin.

01:08:21.243 --> 01:08:22.504
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met other people.

01:08:22.725 --> 01:08:28.570
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to camp out on the little staircase outside of Squeenix's little thing.

01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:32.233
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just sitting back there talking and apparently... Crap, who was it?

01:08:32.253 --> 01:08:32.553
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot.

01:08:32.593 --> 01:08:38.778
[SPEAKER_00]: It was another radio personage or had a homepage who knew somebody I knew.

01:08:39.459 --> 01:08:40.340
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were talking about them.

01:08:41.842 --> 01:08:51.072
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty hilarious, but I ended up also taking a nap somewhere way back behind the SOCOM 3 area.

01:08:51.593 --> 01:08:53.015
[SPEAKER_05]: How you nap at E3 is beyond me.

01:08:53.035 --> 01:08:54.216
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we've got to keep going.

01:08:54.236 --> 01:08:54.857
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tiring.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:56.338
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:56.919
[SPEAKER_00]: Busy girl.

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:07.411
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to get a little bit outside the realm of gaming, I believe, but there was big DVD news this week, and therefore there's going to be a corresponding game thing going on with it.

01:09:07.611 --> 01:09:16.561
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we knew that LEGO Star Wars 2 was coming out, and LEGO Star Wars 2, the original trilogy, and of course now that since they're re-releasing the original trilogy DVDs on September 12th,

01:09:17.062 --> 01:09:18.103
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:43.740
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Legos.

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:44.240
[SPEAKER_05]: They're awesome.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:49.302
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the Lego Star Wars games are games I keep meaning to check out that I never do, so maybe I'll get it this time.

01:09:49.362 --> 01:09:51.023
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a business proposal for us all right now.

01:09:51.163 --> 01:09:51.463
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, dear.

01:09:52.223 --> 01:09:55.304
[SPEAKER_00]: In a few months, we should do a podcast from Legoland.

01:09:56.944 --> 01:09:57.184
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:09:57.204 --> 01:09:58.185
[SPEAKER_05]: Legoland sucks, dude.

01:09:58.205 --> 01:09:59.765
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't got the travel budget.

01:09:59.925 --> 01:10:02.046
[SPEAKER_05]: Legoland is a lame-ass theme park.

01:10:02.066 --> 01:10:04.987
[SPEAKER_05]: You find us some advertisers, we'll be fine.

01:10:05.663 --> 01:10:10.247
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, pay for us to go to Legoland, and we'll say that your product doesn't suck.

01:10:10.967 --> 01:10:12.288
[SPEAKER_05]: We go to Knott's Berry Farm, too.

01:10:12.328 --> 01:10:13.870
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just have a crappy theme park.

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:15.491
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just go to Disneyland.

01:10:16.732 --> 01:10:19.734
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's got a barrage of television and movie game news.

01:10:20.195 --> 01:10:21.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, goody.

01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:26.711
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not surprising, everyone's jumping on the bandwagon here.

01:10:27.151 --> 01:10:42.055
[SPEAKER_03]: First one we've got coming out, THQ announced The Sopranos is heading to PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 and scheduled to be released this holiday season and of course you get to play all the Sopranos cast and yeah, it's basically Godfather all over again.

01:10:42.235 --> 01:10:44.416
[SPEAKER_03]: So look for that, should be fun.

01:10:46.216 --> 01:10:47.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Then of course we've got

01:10:48.936 --> 01:10:49.476
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

01:10:49.616 --> 01:10:51.777
[SPEAKER_03]: Reservoir Dogs was going to be coming out.

01:10:52.338 --> 01:10:56.560
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one actually is being released by some really tiny company.

01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:03.823
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I've read, none of the cast are... I don't know.

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:13.208
[SPEAKER_03]: Quentin Tarantino pretends that this isn't actually going on, that the game's not being made, and just... I don't know.

01:11:13.989 --> 01:11:14.029
[SPEAKER_03]: It...

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:15.660
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:22.844
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to try to go through some of the movie's plot and show you things that you might not have seen in the actual movie.

01:11:23.665 --> 01:11:24.985
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it'll be good.

01:11:25.365 --> 01:11:28.707
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the one I'm kind of excited about, Scarface.

01:11:29.047 --> 01:11:30.328
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming out this September.

01:11:30.988 --> 01:11:34.070
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, this one looks really sweet.

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:37.812
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a huge voice cast.

01:11:37.852 --> 01:11:39.113
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody except for Al Pacino.

01:11:39.133 --> 01:11:42.394
[SPEAKER_03]: But Al Pacino, he actually picked out his voice actor for this.

01:11:42.434 --> 01:11:43.295
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got...

01:11:43.991 --> 01:11:44.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:12:05.216 --> 01:12:07.837
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:31.409
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday you get this show, 183 Part A. Tuesday, not Wednesday, Tuesday you're going to get 183 Part B, so you get it a little early this week.

01:12:31.849 --> 01:12:37.474
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, sometime in the evening, you're going to get our live shows that we're doing at the E3 Outpost.

01:12:37.774 --> 01:12:42.096
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to hear us tape these shows live, we're actually going to be doing them at allgames.com.

01:12:42.136 --> 01:12:47.799
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be on our own stream just due to technical restrictions, but it will be on allgames.com's feed.

01:12:48.279 --> 01:12:50.500
[SPEAKER_05]: 6.30ish is the time.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:56.983
[SPEAKER_05]: That all depends on basically how fast we can get our butts back from the show and upstairs to start taping.

01:12:57.023 --> 01:12:58.584
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really what everything relies on.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:00.065
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're giving ourselves 30 minutes.

01:13:00.385 --> 01:13:01.705
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope that's enough time, but we'll see.

01:13:03.703 --> 01:13:06.105
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're going to go to a break now.

01:13:06.506 --> 01:13:20.399
