Today, May 7th, 2006, Boobies and Oblivion brings on the Wrath of the M rating, News

00:20.040 --> 00:27.040
on the new DS and E3 Madness.

00:32.940 --> 00:38.360
Hello everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio. It is May 7th, 2006. This is

00:38.360 --> 00:41.200
episode number 183

00:41.200 --> 00:45.240
of our live radio program and podcast dedicated to games

00:45.240 --> 00:49.080
that don't suck but sometimes we gotta talk about games that do suck

00:49.080 --> 00:51.960
just because we want to taunt them and laugh at them and take them outside and

00:51.960 --> 00:52.600
beat them

00:52.600 --> 00:56.360
my name is Rob Roberts for you not might know me as Sky joining me as always are

00:56.360 --> 00:56.580
my

00:56.580 --> 00:59.720
awesome co-hosts and that corner the happiest bunny on the farm

00:59.720 --> 01:03.880
Dark Sakura Jamie Summers what what what what what what what what

01:03.880 --> 01:08.680
what how are you? Well you said bunny and I was thinking of the Cadbury bunny

01:08.680 --> 01:11.800
that's what I thought too. Do you know how fattening those things are? They're so good

01:11.800 --> 01:13.640
they're so good they're so bad for you

01:13.640 --> 01:16.720
I try to tell myself that things that are very tasty like that are really you know

01:16.720 --> 01:17.600
they taste like poo

01:17.600 --> 01:19.820
Because you knew chocolate is the color of poo

01:20.260 --> 01:25.720
So I tried to keep that in my head whenever I look at chocolate like I want to eat some but green tea frappuccino

01:25.920 --> 01:27.800
Doesn't look like anything. It just looks like yummy

01:27.800 --> 01:32.460
So I had one add to one of them though had fat-free milk in it because I got it at Whole Foods

01:32.760 --> 01:33.360
You know

01:33.360 --> 01:38.780
I do and was like I bet if I went through the last 20 episodes of orange lounge radio 10 of them would start off with

01:38.780 --> 01:40.780
You talking about food or coffee?

01:42.240 --> 01:45.360
Because I did not bring a latte in with me today I

01:45.360 --> 01:49.000
I am hyped up on freakin' sugar like you would not believe

01:49.000 --> 01:53.680
and very pissed off at people. Really? Can we say the angst for a little bit?

01:53.680 --> 01:56.720
I was gonna not talk about that right now.

01:56.720 --> 02:00.280
I was not gonna talk about that. We got a whole segment for the angst. We'll get to that.

02:00.280 --> 02:04.080
Sure. But I did get presents. Say hello as well to

02:04.080 --> 02:07.480
Loki. Hello. Our tech master. How you doing?

02:07.480 --> 02:12.640

Alright, let's start off this week's show as we start off every show with a little bit

02:27.260 --> 02:28.960
of how is your gaming week?

02:28.960 --> 02:30.400
What kind of stuff have you been playing?

02:30.400 --> 02:31.400
Dark Sakura, start us off.

02:31.400 --> 02:40.000
Dark Sakura I've been doing more Kingdom Hearts fan art lately.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.620
We also picked up, um, what did we get?

02:43.620 --> 02:47.360
We got some game or the other that Dan was playing, oh yeah, we got a pinball machine.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.360
What?

02:48.360 --> 02:50.120
We bought a Judge Dredd pinball machine.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.520
Oh, why didn't you buy a good machine?

02:51.520 --> 02:54.920
That is a good machine, oh my god, it's really awesome.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.800
And then we're getting this other one called I think Frenzy or something.

02:57.800 --> 03:01.920
It's supposed to be a really expensive pin table, um, we're getting one that's kind of

03:01.920 --> 03:05.320
in crap repair for like, you know, a few hundred, but we're gonna fix it up and resell it for

03:05.320 --> 03:06.320
like 5,000.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.020
Call me when you get pin-bought.

03:08.020 --> 03:11.580
I want a freakin' pinbot, but no, the machine I really want, really, really...

03:11.580 --> 03:12.580
Bride of Pinbot.

03:12.580 --> 03:16.540
Bride of Pinbot was awesome, but I want Black Knight 2000.

03:16.540 --> 03:18.120
That was a good table.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.120
Very good table.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.120
What's with the sudden pinball?

03:20.120 --> 03:22.340
Dan has always been all over the pinballs.

03:22.340 --> 03:27.340
Actually, before I got into DDR, when I would go to the arcade, I was mostly a pinball addict.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.140
I remember you stuck on Theater of Magic for a long time.

03:29.140 --> 03:30.900
I loved Theater of Magic.

03:30.900 --> 03:36.660
Theater of Magic, Addams Family, Elvira, and I can't remember the name of it, the holographic

03:36.660 --> 03:37.660
one with the space aliens.

03:37.660 --> 03:45.740
When I first moved out here, we used to go eat at this Godfather's Pizza because I worked

03:45.740 --> 03:50.380
at GNC and it was right there, so we'd drop off my deposit and go get dinner at Godfather's

03:50.380 --> 03:55.380
and they had a last action hero pinball machine in there and we played the hell out of it.

03:55.380 --> 04:00.340
In fact, the reason we stopped eating at that Godfather's Pizza was because they got rid

04:00.340 --> 04:01.660
of the damn pinball table.

04:01.660 --> 04:04.340
They also had Snow Brothers there too.

04:04.340 --> 04:06.840
That's a great arcade game.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.920
It's like Bubble Bobble, but it's not.

04:08.920 --> 04:09.920
You know what I mean?

04:09.920 --> 04:10.920
It's different.

04:10.920 --> 04:11.920
It's just got snow.

04:11.920 --> 04:12.920
I love that.

04:12.920 --> 04:13.920
I played that on the Ultra-Cade.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.000
Well, the rest of my gaming week had to actually do with me downloading gaming stuff.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.480
I played a crap load of Ragnarok.

04:18.480 --> 04:26.960
I am now level 64, uh, 40, 48, 64, hey, Addict, Mr. Addict, Final Fantasy.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.960
Ask me how much Final Fantasy I played this week.

04:28.960 --> 04:29.960
How much did you play?

04:29.960 --> 04:30.960
Zip.

04:30.960 --> 04:31.960
Thank you.

04:31.960 --> 04:32.960
You're just in detox.

04:32.960 --> 04:33.960
Zip.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.380
You're gonna get back on the habit, like you did before.

04:35.380 --> 04:36.380
After E3, you bet.

04:36.380 --> 04:38.380
That's right where I'm going, right after E3 is over.

04:38.380 --> 04:40.380
Yeah, but I can bring Ragnarok with me.

04:40.380 --> 04:48.380
Anyway, I downloaded all of the UFO endings and dog endings for the Silent Hill games.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.380
Just because I wanted to torture myself.

04:50.380 --> 04:51.380
Is that YouTube?

04:51.380 --> 04:52.380
On YouTube.

04:52.380 --> 04:56.380
YouTube is like the greatest thing to hit the internet in the past ten years.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.380
It's crack.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.380
It's like freaking heroin.

04:58.380 --> 04:59.380
It's beautiful.

04:59.380 --> 05:05.380
But I watched the alien endings and honestly the one in Silent Hill 3 was the funniest.

05:05.380 --> 05:08.180
because it's all the,

05:08.180 --> 05:10.100
let's sing the Silent Hill song.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.980
Singing the whole thing, it was great.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.020
And I liked the dog ending.

05:16.020 --> 05:17.420
That was the one thing that disappointed me

05:17.420 --> 05:18.820
about the Silent Hill movie,

05:18.820 --> 05:20.420
is I wanted after the credits there

05:20.420 --> 05:22.260
to be a dog ending or a UFO ending.

05:22.260 --> 05:24.180
I think the DVD is going to have a UFO ending.

05:24.180 --> 05:25.020
Sweet.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.860
It better not be the craptastic same ones

05:26.860 --> 05:27.780
like they had in the games,

05:27.780 --> 05:31.400
because the only good one was like the Heather one.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.320
You know on the internet movie database,

05:33.320 --> 05:37.320
They said that the original cut of the Silent Hill movie was three and a half hours long.

05:37.320 --> 05:43.360
Now take everything you read on Internet Movie Database with a grain of salt, but still be

05:43.360 --> 05:48.640
kind of neat if the DVD is action packed.

05:48.640 --> 05:53.480
I think a lot of people now are filming extra stuff, even though they know it's not going

05:53.480 --> 05:57.640
to be in their things they think are neat, because it's going to be on the DVD.

05:57.640 --> 06:03.120
They're going to have like an uber director's edition, unrated, hoopla, we're going to save

06:03.120 --> 06:08.260
the world type DVD release like all the 20 million Lord of the Rings DVDs that

06:08.260 --> 06:12.360
there are out and all the and you know you know Kevin Smith does it he does it

06:12.360 --> 06:17.160
on purpose I think that's hilarious so I think that the DVD of Silent Hill is

06:17.160 --> 06:22.360
gonna be like like the diggity just if you want to hear hilarity and then we'll

06:22.360 --> 06:25.840
get back into games I think it's mall rats it's either mall rats are chasing

06:25.840 --> 06:28.720
Amy one of those when you start listening to the director's commentary

06:28.720 --> 06:31.860
they go fuck DVD because they were originally recording it for the laser

06:31.860 --> 06:34.540
your disc edition. I don't remember if it was Mallrats or Chasing Amy, one of the two.

06:34.540 --> 06:38.420
Arsef has a comment for you. Okay, what? Not just a grain, the whole damn shaker.

06:38.420 --> 06:42.340
Hee hee.

06:42.340 --> 06:45.420
Is that it?

06:45.420 --> 06:48.980
I actually though, that same night, I went and I had like

06:48.980 --> 06:53.580
a dream that I was stuck in Silent Hill with a dog. It was the craziest, weirdest,

06:53.580 --> 06:54.580
most freaking out,

06:54.580 --> 06:58.500
it was an actual nightmare, I'm not kidding, but I had a dog there the whole time, that same stupid

06:58.500 --> 06:59.580
little dog wearing headphones.

07:00.580 --> 07:05.180
You are so weird, it's true. I think it was because I also was eating spaghetti

07:06.820 --> 07:08.940
Sure blame your problems on spaghetti

07:09.340 --> 07:13.700
Well, okay you ever notice that if you eat something before you go to bed and you've like watch something

07:13.700 --> 07:15.700
You almost always end up having a weird dream

07:16.500 --> 07:20.600
Or does it just happen to me? Uh, I don't remember my dreams like ever

07:21.380 --> 07:26.700
Once once every three months. I'll remember a dream. That's about it. It's like the whole past couple weeks

07:26.700 --> 07:32.240
I've been just having a like uber vivid dreams, and I dreamt about Silent Hill with a dog with headphones freaky

07:32.240 --> 07:35.820
It was very freaky. Oh, we gotta get back into games. I'm talking about games. I know

07:36.420 --> 07:44.220
We gotta keep it moving. I'm sorry anything else any other games um I have um Kingdom Hearts chain of memories now

07:44.220 --> 07:49.540
I heard that's missable um it's not open yet. I'm taking it to e3 all right. Have fun

07:50.260 --> 07:52.260
Loki how was your gaming week?

07:52.260 --> 07:56.120
almost non-existent, but uh... Oh yeah, it's true!

07:56.120 --> 07:59.840
And Loki got married, in case you weren't listening last week, so

07:59.840 --> 08:01.980
congratulations, Loki, on your marriage.

08:01.980 --> 08:06.380
I played Mutant Storm Reloaded on Xbox Live's arcade,

08:06.380 --> 08:12.700
and that was pretty fun, and I played more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories,

08:12.700 --> 08:16.460
because I can, and

08:16.460 --> 08:20.780
the new firmware update did help some of the problems,

08:20.780 --> 08:21.860
But they're still there

08:21.860 --> 08:26.500
It's just when you start playing more of the multiplayer stuff and actually starting to play the other

08:26.660 --> 08:30.620
Modes there and they're like team playing stuff you start noticing how rushed

08:31.020 --> 08:36.420
The multiplayer was in the game and how it really sucks, and it's really unfinished

08:37.180 --> 08:39.460
But still fun. I love it

08:41.100 --> 08:44.300
Then I've been playing a little bit loco roco

08:44.300 --> 08:48.340
Which is also that demo that you can download for the PSP firmware 2.7

08:48.340 --> 08:52.420
I mentioned that last week and it's actually kind of cool. It's a different game. I

08:52.940 --> 08:54.940
Don't know it kind of seems in the same

08:55.140 --> 08:57.300
Like pot as you know

08:57.860 --> 09:03.780
Katamari just you know kind of a little quirky game reminds me like if Katamari and Yoshi's Island had a baby

09:03.780 --> 09:05.780
This would be you know

09:06.180 --> 09:09.140
Its result a big a big cute

09:09.780 --> 09:10.900
cutesy

09:10.900 --> 09:14.280
something's wrong with it baby something like that yeah

09:14.280 --> 09:17.920
so it it's different I'll give them that

09:17.920 --> 09:21.040
that's that's pretty much it I think

09:21.040 --> 09:26.460
alright I'm my gaming week actually I didn't play anything new

09:26.460 --> 09:29.480
because my work trip that really cut into my week they wanted 10 bucks a

09:29.480 --> 09:31.840
night for internet access in my hotel I was like

09:31.840 --> 09:35.340
if you that's what I don't like about swanky hotels I like that my work puts me

09:35.340 --> 09:36.920
up in swanky hotels when I

09:36.920 --> 09:39.800
you know go travel but then they want more money for internet access and my

09:39.800 --> 09:43.580
works not going to pay for so I didn't get to really play any games like I couldn't

09:43.580 --> 09:47.160
you know play World of Warcraft or even though I cancelled my account anyway but if I got

09:47.160 --> 09:51.900
bored enough I would have reactivated it or any flash games or anything so I did have

09:51.900 --> 09:57.700
my DS so I've been doing my brain training mostly every day I've unlocked I think I've

09:57.700 --> 10:02.660
got my 17th stamp as of today so I've unlocked the triangle math was the last thing I got

10:02.660 --> 10:06.380
the hard mode no wait there was I think there was another game after that I only have one

10:06.380 --> 10:10.220
more game left unlocked so brain training is going good also Tetris DS

10:10.220 --> 10:15.900
Xtaphir, my roommate, has been borrowing my Tetris DS and he actually unlocked

10:15.900 --> 10:21.060
level 20 he beat the whole game and so playing Tetris on level 20 is insane

10:21.060 --> 10:25.660
because the blocks don't even fall they just drop like imagine just having the

10:25.660 --> 10:29.620
blocks drop every time that's what it does on level 20 but level 20 is inspired

10:29.620 --> 10:33.260
by classic NES Tetris which is pretty cool because you know how like Tetris

10:33.260 --> 10:38.300
is all inspired by different NES games of the past. Well, level 20 is NES Tetris, so

10:38.300 --> 10:43.460
I thought that was pretty rad. It has a remix of the theme. Played a six-player multiplayer

10:43.460 --> 10:50.880
Tetris DS last night. Craziness. Absolute craziness. But fun. Good times. Otherwise,

10:50.880 --> 10:54.940
there hasn't been a lot new. I'm sorry to say, no Final Fantasy XI this week. I've just

10:54.940 --> 10:59.580
been on a little vacation because, you know, just prepping for E3 and all that stuff and

10:59.580 --> 11:04.280
work trip got in the way as well so haven't had a lot of gaming time but I've been reading

11:04.280 --> 11:08.760
a lot of gaming news sites trying to keep up on what's going on for E3 and of course

11:08.760 --> 11:14.120
we have a whole lot of news to get into tonight but first we have a very special announcement

11:14.120 --> 11:16.260
I'll let Loki plug this.

11:16.260 --> 11:20.640
This is something we've been teasing for a few weeks but it is now official we're announcing

11:20.640 --> 11:21.640
it tonight.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.640
Loki tell us about it.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.640
Yes, of course, we've been working on new site for weeks now.

11:26.640 --> 11:33.280
New site is going to be, I think it is the only PSP site out there that's covering

11:33.280 --> 11:41.280
E3, or PSP formatted site covering E3, but it's E3 on PSP.com, very similar to O-L-R

11:41.280 --> 11:43.640
on PS, or O-L-R, ah.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.640
O-L-R PSP?

11:44.640 --> 11:49.680
Yes, O-L-R PSP.com, except you're going to have a lot more content on here.

11:49.680 --> 11:54.640
There's definitely, basically the whole purpose of it is we're trying to put E3 in the palm

11:54.640 --> 11:55.640
of your hands.

11:55.640 --> 11:59.600
I mean literally we're going to do video walkthroughs of like booths and stuff.

11:59.600 --> 12:03.320
You'll feel like you're on the show floor watching, you know, all the stuff we're walking

12:03.320 --> 12:04.320
around.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.800
And so we get a lot of exclusive content.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.200
I'm going to the Nintendo party on Tuesdays.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.360
So hopefully you get some stuff like, you know, you'll actually get to see what the

12:12.360 --> 12:13.720
Nintendo party looks like.

12:13.720 --> 12:17.360
I mean, because a lot of people don't get to go to the E3, let alone go to parties and

12:17.360 --> 12:18.360
stuff like that.

12:18.360 --> 12:23.820
So, definitely lots of content on there, we've got some stuff on there already, just to give

12:23.820 --> 12:28.540
you an idea of what we're going to have and it's going to be amazing.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.540
Lots and lots of stuff.

12:29.540 --> 12:33.700
We're going to work our butts off on this site this whole week for you guys, it's E3

12:33.700 --> 12:37.580
on PSP.com and it's actually not just going to be us, we're going to get some outside

12:37.580 --> 12:41.040
help on this as well, of course you've probably noticed we've been working an awful lot with

12:41.040 --> 12:44.720
our buddies at AllGames.com lately and it's my understanding they're going to be helping

12:44.720 --> 12:46.080
with this venture as well.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.300
I don't know to what extent just yet.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.540
I think Bobby said he'd do some on-camera stuff for us, so I'm going to hold him to

12:52.540 --> 12:53.540
that.

12:53.540 --> 12:58.380
So you're going to have videos with myself, Loki, if we can give Dark Sakura enough sugar,

12:58.380 --> 13:00.380
maybe we'll get her in one of the videos.

13:00.380 --> 13:04.180
Maybe if I can find a Dr. Doom mask.

13:04.180 --> 13:08.260
I'm sure we'll have Bobby and then hopefully maybe Scott and Lawrence as well, so all on

13:08.260 --> 13:12.500
the E3 on PSP site, giving you walk-throughs of Boost, just talking about games.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.140
And of course, our big thing is interactiveness.

13:16.140 --> 13:22.320
So if you guys want to send us an email and say, hey guys, check this out, I want to see

13:22.320 --> 13:23.320
this.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.920
We did this last year at E3.

13:25.920 --> 13:29.240
We pulled the shows from our archives, but if you talk to some of our listeners who have

13:29.240 --> 13:31.920
been around a while, you can probably find copies of these shows.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.280
We actually opened it up during these shows, like on Wednesday, we said, okay, send us

13:35.280 --> 13:37.800
your questions, we'll find out the answers on Thursday.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.800
We actually took all the questions and went out on the floor and figured out the answers

13:40.800 --> 13:42.760
to them and brought them to you on Thursday's show.

13:42.760 --> 13:45.580
We wanted to do the same thing with the site as well.

13:45.580 --> 13:49.700
The other great thing about the site is that if you're an E3 attendee, we're going to put

13:49.700 --> 13:51.840
maps of the show floor on there.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.320
That's the one thing that's still missing, right?

13:53.320 --> 13:54.320
But it's going to be...

13:54.320 --> 13:55.320
No, it's up there.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.320
Oh, did you get it done?

13:56.320 --> 13:57.320
Yeah, it's up there.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.320
Hooray!

13:58.320 --> 13:59.980
But it's not just going to be maps, just like everything.

13:59.980 --> 14:06.360
It's good to have, if you have access to even some of the Wi-Fi there, you can actually

14:06.360 --> 14:10.600
see, you know, okay, I'm waiting in this giant line, what exactly are they showing at the

14:10.600 --> 14:15.760
Sony booth or, you know, just so you know how to budget your time and I definitely think,

14:15.760 --> 14:21.080
I wish, you know, a lot of times like, for example, waiting in line, you know, to see

14:21.080 --> 14:25.860
Twilight Princess, you know, what exactly do they have back there, I mean, you know,

14:25.860 --> 14:26.860
see if you have three hours.

14:26.860 --> 14:32.780
Alright, so just check that out, it's E3 on PSP.com, of course it is formatted for the

14:32.780 --> 14:39.700
PSP, you can look at it in Firefox, Internet Explorer, but it's not going to be, it's not

14:39.700 --> 14:42.900
going to look right, but if you're okay with that, go ahead, there's going to be a lot

14:42.900 --> 14:43.900
of great videos you can look at.

14:43.900 --> 14:47.580
And they're asking if Flash is on there yet, no, I didn't support Flash on this because

14:47.580 --> 14:51.900
not everyone is upgrading their firmware to 2.7, and I didn't want to force people to

14:51.900 --> 14:56.500
do that, and didn't want to exclude people from certain things, so no Flash on there,

14:56.500 --> 15:02.460
but it'll still be pretty quick, and I don't know, the Flash on the PSP is not that great

15:02.460 --> 15:04.660
I just want to play with it, see what I can do with it.

15:04.660 --> 15:09.580
Yeah, we'll table the Flash thing for a later OLR PSP upgrade. That'll be cool.

15:09.580 --> 15:13.460
Well, yeah, later on when we're done with the PSP site,

15:13.460 --> 15:16.620
E3 and PSP, you'll see some

15:16.620 --> 15:20.060
definite improvements. I have ideas.

15:20.060 --> 15:23.220
So, lots and lots and lots of content

15:23.220 --> 15:28.300
and it should be good. Alright, let's go into some

15:28.300 --> 15:34.180
other news while you're all checking out E3 on PSP.com, we'll talk about Nintendo.

15:34.180 --> 15:39.040
This is a little bit of a follow-up to last week's mini episode, and by the way, if you

15:39.040 --> 15:43.060
haven't figured it out, there's a little joke at the end of last week's episode.

15:43.060 --> 15:48.880
If you turned off the show before Dark Soccer and I came back and talked about the Wii,

15:48.880 --> 15:50.380
you missed the last 10 minutes of the show.

15:50.380 --> 15:51.380
And we laugh at you.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.460
Yeah, we played a little gag.

15:52.460 --> 15:56.300
I think most people probably figured it out because they probably saw the MP3 wasn't finished

15:56.300 --> 16:00.740
yet, but just in case you missed it, yes, Dark Soccer and I did talk about the Wii last

16:00.740 --> 16:02.480
week when Loki wasn't here.

16:02.480 --> 16:06.460
One of the things we talked about was the conspiracy theories going on on the internet

16:06.460 --> 16:10.220
that, oh, the Wii's not trademarked, so it can't be true.

16:10.220 --> 16:16.440
It's all a viral gag campaign, they're pulling your leg, Nintendo's gonna come out and announce

16:16.440 --> 16:24.020
the real name, well, guess what, this week the Wii trademark did show up on the website,

16:24.020 --> 16:30.140
And it's there if you want to check the database for yourself, have fun, WII, Nintendo has

16:30.140 --> 16:31.540
trademarked it.

16:31.540 --> 16:34.640
It's actually right up there on their site as a tab.

16:34.640 --> 16:40.300
Now I'm sure that you guys will have crazy conspiracy theories that say, well it's still

16:40.300 --> 16:44.580
fake or whatever, no it's going to be the name of the console, just deal with it.

16:44.580 --> 16:49.760
I think most people are kind of backing off on the name now and waiting to see what the

16:49.760 --> 16:52.700
games are like, which is what we were saying all along last week.

16:52.700 --> 16:56.140
I think the name does exactly what any type of name should do.

16:56.140 --> 17:00.600
Like I said last week, the whole purpose of things you should do when advertising anything

17:00.600 --> 17:04.140
is to have something simple, something that people are going to remember, and something

17:04.140 --> 17:05.380
that people are going to talk about.

17:05.380 --> 17:09.400
I think that they've accomplished that pretty well.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
It'll be fine.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.400
I mean, we'll see.

17:11.400 --> 17:16.380
The real test will be in a few days when we start seeing the games at E3.

17:16.380 --> 17:20.460
And Loki has a news article on some of the games we're going to be seeing on the Wii.

17:20.460 --> 17:23.060
I don't know if we'll see this at E3, but later on.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.060
Maybe.

17:24.060 --> 17:29.400
Spider-Man 3, they're going to have a special version for it, which is not surprising.

17:29.400 --> 17:32.740
Most of the games I think that are going to be ported to it are going to be having unique

17:32.740 --> 17:34.860
versions of it.

17:34.860 --> 17:39.180
But got to report it, Spider-Man 3, unique version for the Wii, so that'll be pretty

17:39.180 --> 17:40.180
interesting.

17:40.180 --> 17:44.240
Actually, I think that ties in with something we talked about a while ago, where they're

17:44.240 --> 17:48.420
saying that they're going to have some web slinging you can do with the controller or

17:48.420 --> 17:49.420
something.

17:49.420 --> 17:50.420
Probably the same thing.

17:50.420 --> 17:54.820
all this control stuff sound too good to be true I mean it's just I I can't help

17:54.820 --> 17:59.100
it at this stage I get flashbacks to the power glove yeah you know and I kind of

17:59.100 --> 18:04.340
go you know the power glove was a neat concept but it wasn't really that

18:04.340 --> 18:08.180
grabbing granted technology's progressed what 15 years since then but you know I

18:08.180 --> 18:13.060
can't help but wonder is this is it gonna be accurate is it really gonna be

18:13.060 --> 18:18.100
as you know in the game as everyone says it is but better than my toy I can't yeah

18:18.100 --> 18:22.580
I know and the eye toy is still kind of gimmicky to me too. So I I I

18:23.460 --> 18:30.400
Don't know the skeptical side of me is coming in but I I'm holding off until e3. I will wait and

18:31.100 --> 18:33.780
Figure it out at e3 because maybe they can pull it off

18:33.780 --> 18:39.660
I mean again technologies come 15 years since all that you force and all that stuff. So yeah, hopefully it's better

18:40.260 --> 18:43.140
The other game you're gonna see at e3 would be Midway's

18:43.860 --> 18:45.620
Blitz the league

18:45.620 --> 18:46.980
of course

18:46.980 --> 18:50.340
Whatever they're gonna be calling it this time, but actually it looks pretty cool

18:51.140 --> 18:55.420
Especially if they're gonna be doing similar stuff to what Madden it's gonna be doing should be a pretty

18:55.940 --> 18:58.300
Pretty good game. So looking forward to that

18:59.180 --> 19:00.780
and then

19:00.780 --> 19:06.220
God knows what other stuff they're gonna have, you know coming out but um, let's leak will be pretty cool. I

19:07.140 --> 19:14.540
Think that the whole like throwing the football with the that just oh I could just I can just see remotes going through TVs

19:14.540 --> 19:21.220
You know they have VAs doing their, they're having a passing and kicking demo as well

19:21.220 --> 19:26.540
as a one game demo for Madden 2007.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.500
So we'll see how it's going to work.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.900
I'm just waiting for like a game where like Super Smash Bros. or something like that where

19:32.900 --> 19:34.740
you start beating someone with a remote.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.180
That would be fun.

19:37.180 --> 19:43.340
Going over to our chat room for some comments www.orangeloungeradio.com click on chat.

19:43.340 --> 19:47.220
a lot of our folks are talking about Para Para Paradise with the

19:47.220 --> 19:50.780
uh... you know it's like DDR but with your hands. You'd have to have two controllers.

19:50.780 --> 19:54.740
Yeah, you'd have to have two controllers. But a lot of the games, they're making support two controllers.

19:54.740 --> 19:58.620
That's the whole thing. And it's not really DDR with your hands, but that's honestly the best way

19:58.620 --> 20:02.540
I can describe it. It actually goes through this whole like... It's like line dancing and

20:02.540 --> 20:06.620
cheerleading meets DDR. Yeah, that's a... I just can't wait. If you ever wanted to be a

20:06.620 --> 20:11.080
Hooters girl, this is uh... the training game for you. I can't wait for some of these games to get really

20:11.080 --> 20:14.580
creative with their control schemes and like come out with like

20:14.580 --> 20:18.040
straps to strap controllers to your legs and arms and

20:18.040 --> 20:24.500
god crazy shit. Activator. And then Bandit says the wizard 2 we unite

20:24.500 --> 20:27.980
because remember the Power Glove was in the first wizard and now it can be the Wii

20:27.980 --> 20:31.500
it's so bad. Yeah I don't know

20:31.500 --> 20:35.040
I know the Power Glove suck that's all I remember. Alright.

20:35.040 --> 20:40.260
It's so bad. Dark Sakura. What? A series that you talk about a lot is coming to the

20:40.260 --> 20:40.980
Wii right?

20:40.980 --> 20:45.180
In fact, you're probably the only person I know that still plays these games.

20:45.180 --> 20:48.220
Hey, Dan does too, and a lot of our friends.

20:48.220 --> 20:49.980
That's why you two live happily ever after.

20:49.980 --> 20:53.140
It's because we're old school, like that, yo.

20:53.140 --> 20:55.620
Anyway, Metal Slug is coming out on the Wii.

20:55.620 --> 21:00.220
I told you I was going to call it Wii from now on.

21:00.220 --> 21:04.420
Let's take bets on how long before that gets annoying, and if you had right now, you just

21:04.420 --> 21:05.420
won.

21:05.420 --> 21:06.420
You know what?

21:06.420 --> 21:07.420
Shut up.

21:07.420 --> 21:14.380
But no, Metal Slug Anthology is going to be out on the Wii, and it will be the 20 millionth

21:14.380 --> 21:17.260
release of Metal Slug, whatever.

21:17.260 --> 21:20.740
I love Metal Slug, and this is saying it's going to be the complete Metal Slug Arcade

21:20.740 --> 21:27.820
Edition with a bunch of bonus stuff, and that you use the Wii controller in a quote new

21:27.820 --> 21:34.860
and unique way, but it was actually announced by Ben Herman, who is the president of SNK.

21:34.860 --> 21:40.840
give any details. Also, that's supposed to, I think, go hand in hand with the release

21:40.840 --> 21:43.140
of SNK vs Capcom Kart Fighters.

21:43.140 --> 21:47.940
You'll use the Wii controller to, you know, throw up your money that's going to be thrown

21:47.940 --> 21:52.300
into the fire because you're throwing away your money to buy this stupid game.

21:52.300 --> 21:58.820
Like, if you're put in Mummy Mode, do you, like, wave your Wii and puke or something?

21:58.820 --> 22:04.020
Will you be able to use your Wii to actually make the graphics look next-gen?

22:04.020 --> 22:08.160
You know what, if SNK really wanted to make us happy, they would freakin' put out another

22:08.160 --> 22:11.300
Metal Slug, on the Neo Geo!

22:11.300 --> 22:13.740
For those of us that have our Neo Geos collecting dust.

22:13.740 --> 22:16.260
Just stop making Metal Slug games.

22:16.260 --> 22:18.260
Hey, there's not three of us, there's at least five.

22:18.260 --> 22:22.860
You can do an SNK classic collection or something like that and be done with it.

22:22.860 --> 22:25.220
Stop re-releasing Metal Slug, no one buys them.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.220
Hey, I do!

22:26.220 --> 22:27.220
Haha.

22:27.220 --> 22:31.140
Yeah, but did you buy every single re-release of it?

22:31.140 --> 22:32.860
Yes.

22:32.860 --> 22:35.200
and we have them on our maim.

22:35.200 --> 22:39.700
Well, you know, what if, like, say that we have, like, the PlayStation hooked up one day?

22:39.700 --> 22:43.180
Well, we have to have a system to play Metal Slug on.

22:43.180 --> 22:48.540
Or what if the Neo Geo CD's hooked up? Well, we have to play Metal Slug on that.

22:48.540 --> 22:53.540
It just depends on what's hooked up. We want to leave our options open.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.720
So we have Metal Slug. Just repeat after me.

22:55.720 --> 23:01.380
I am a consumer whore. And how? I'm glad somebody's supporting SNK, because they sure as hell

23:01.380 --> 23:07.200
haven't made any new games recently. I love SNK. I love SNK almost as much as I

23:07.200 --> 23:10.420
love Sega. Alright. Ooh, King of Fighters 94 again. That'd

23:10.420 --> 23:15.160
be fun. You know what, I do have to say the King

23:15.160 --> 23:20.160
of Fighters games though on Saturn are torturous because the load screens take a minute and

23:20.160 --> 23:24.840
a half each. Alright. How about some big news? Big news

23:24.840 --> 23:27.320
this week, not about the Wii. Wii!

23:27.320 --> 23:31.920
Okay, what I'm going to do is after E3, I'm going to get a ceiling contraption installed

23:31.920 --> 23:36.320
so that every time Dark Sakura goes weeee, a Wii controller will fall from the ceiling

23:36.320 --> 23:39.000
and bonk her on the head.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
I like that idea.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
But hey, you know what?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
That gives me ammo.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
You know what I want to do?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.600
I want to convert one of the ferrets into a rev mode.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.600
That would be hilarious.

23:46.600 --> 23:47.600
That's a great idea.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.600
But where's the ferret?

23:48.600 --> 23:49.600
I don't know, we burned it.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.600
Hey!

23:50.600 --> 23:52.240
Moving on, getting into a story here.

23:52.240 --> 23:55.160
This was huge news this week, Oblivion.

23:55.160 --> 23:59.100
Was this the sequel to Hot Coffee, this whole debacle going on in Oblivion?

23:59.100 --> 24:02.780
You guys have probably read about this, but if you've been living in a cave or you just

24:02.780 --> 24:08.060
avoid Oblivion news for whatever reason, the ESRB changed the rating of the PC version

24:08.060 --> 24:16.240
of Oblivion from T to M. The Xbox 360 version got re-rated later, or

24:16.240 --> 24:17.240
it was clarified.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.880
It was stupid why they did that.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.620
If you let me finish, here's what happened.

24:22.620 --> 24:27.500
Apparently, there were a texture for boobies on the disk.

24:27.500 --> 24:31.620
However, the boobies were never meant to be accessed.

24:31.620 --> 24:34.640
You were not allowed to have a topless character in Oblivion.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.940
There is no up, up, down, down, left, right.

24:36.940 --> 24:39.620
There is no code to get the boobies.

24:39.620 --> 24:44.740
You have to do a third-party outside hack to put the boobies on.

24:44.740 --> 24:49.460
Because of this third-party hack, it has been exposed that the boobs were on the disk the

24:49.460 --> 24:55.380
whole time and therefore this game is not safe for children and it's slapped with an

24:55.380 --> 24:56.380
M rating.

24:56.380 --> 25:01.680
Here's my problem with this whole thing, that's just like saying if I took let's say Care

25:01.680 --> 25:09.340
Bears the movie and I spliced in porn in there and put that ISO on the internet, would they

25:09.340 --> 25:12.500
have to re-rate that movie X because I spliced in porn?

25:12.500 --> 25:17.300
No because the porn wasn't on the disc to begin with, that I believe is the whole thing.

25:17.300 --> 25:23.700
What about, then, in the case of The Rescuers, with the sliced-in nudie photo, which was

25:23.700 --> 25:28.540
done at the animation studio and has been on every subsequent release, except for the

25:28.540 --> 25:33.640
modern ones after these uptight anal-rotative, right-wing people decided to watch every frame

25:33.640 --> 25:34.780
and pick out stuff in it?

25:34.780 --> 25:38.060
Or The Lion King, where the stars spell out sex?

25:38.060 --> 25:41.660
Or in Aladdin, where if you listen real carefully, it goes, take your clothes off.

25:41.660 --> 25:45.060
Actually, that was deemed to be fake, and I found that out at Snopes.com, your website

25:45.060 --> 25:46.060
of the week.

25:46.060 --> 25:47.060
I love Snopes.

25:47.060 --> 25:50.420
still I mean it looks like those stars do say sex I mean if you look at it

25:50.420 --> 25:54.940
You know Ronald McDonald's hair, it says hot, yummy, good. Serious.

25:54.940 --> 25:57.580
No that's a very good, you know what though, that's a very good point the

25:57.580 --> 26:01.340
Rescuers wasn't made an R movie because you know I had that one frame of

26:01.340 --> 26:02.060
boobies in it

26:02.060 --> 26:05.760
but yet the games are you know damned

26:05.760 --> 26:09.300
for this. Well the thing is this is how I see it

26:09.300 --> 26:12.480
you know with the subsequent releases

26:12.480 --> 26:16.780
of for example the Rescuers they've gone and removed those frames of animation

26:16.780 --> 26:20.300
or replace them so that you don't have that in the newer versions.

26:20.300 --> 26:24.100
However, can't they do that on later releases of games?

26:24.100 --> 26:27.300
Just go through, delete code, and release it.

26:27.300 --> 26:30.780
Here's my question. Why the hell did someone actually spend time to create

26:30.780 --> 26:32.020
textures for boobies

26:32.020 --> 26:35.580
on these characters anyway? Because probably there was a plan to have them in

26:35.580 --> 26:38.540
the game at some point, but they decided, nope, not a good idea.

26:38.540 --> 26:42.020
Bloody Roar 3 had,

26:42.020 --> 26:45.100
if you use a cheat, a cheat whatever,

26:45.100 --> 26:48.940
you can pull up pictures that the game programmers did in

26:48.940 --> 26:52.640
of the characters in compromising positions, like

26:52.640 --> 26:56.980
naked and doing stuff. Yeah, they really tried to sell that game despite the fact that this sucked.

26:56.980 --> 27:01.820
You know, people are saying that this is nothing like hot coffee, but I say this is

27:01.820 --> 27:05.140
exactly like hot coffee. You know why? Because that sex game

27:05.140 --> 27:08.600
was never meant to be found either. It was on the disk, but

27:08.600 --> 27:13.040
I'd say it's the exact same thing that's happening between the two games.

27:13.040 --> 27:18.520
At some point, Oblivion, the creators, probably planned for there to be a topless character.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.520
Why not?

27:19.520 --> 27:22.480
If the game is violent, why not throw in a little nudity as well?

27:22.480 --> 27:27.280
However, at some point during the beta, or even the alpha testing, they decided, you

27:27.280 --> 27:28.280
know what?

27:28.280 --> 27:29.280
Bad idea.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.060
Let's just take the pointer out to the textures.

27:31.060 --> 27:35.600
It's easier to take the pointer out than to redo everything on the disk.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.720
I've always said that's the exact same thing that happened on Hot Coffee.

27:37.720 --> 27:43.220
The way they do clothing nowadays, it's just an actual, like, object on top of an object.

27:43.220 --> 27:48.880
So the textures are always there, it's just they're covered up by a clothing object.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.240
So you just remove that clothing object, and there you go.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.240
I'm so irritated.

27:53.240 --> 27:57.760
They didn't get pissed off about it with The Sims.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.920
There seems to be just this huge, I don't know, standard much?

28:00.920 --> 28:06.660
Well, it's because they hate Take-Two, you know, because Ben Aharsa's, you know, distributed

28:06.660 --> 28:11.180
by Take-Two and 2K, so, you know, let's go beat them up some more.

28:11.180 --> 28:13.140
Alright, let's get into the rest of the follow-up here.

28:13.140 --> 28:18.280
And you know what, because of all this crap, this is why we get really bad games, like

28:18.280 --> 28:21.300
Take-Two presents, or Rockstar presents, Table Tennis.

28:21.300 --> 28:25.660
I blame all of those sexually repressed anal-retentive people.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.940
Alright, let's get into the follow-ups. Low-key.

28:27.940 --> 28:28.940
Bethesda Respawns.

28:28.940 --> 28:34.980
Yeah, so Respawn basically insists that a full and accurate, comprehensive report of

28:34.980 --> 28:41.620
Oblivion's content was submitted to the ESRB before the game's release that included

28:41.620 --> 28:47.120
a 60 page document that detailed the all explicit language acts and scenes in the game. It says

28:47.120 --> 28:51.660
they did not list the nudity because there is no nudity in Oblivion without a third party

28:51.660 --> 28:57.760
modification." And so basically they're just kind of, you know, this is ridiculous.

28:57.760 --> 29:02.060
Essentially the same thing that Rockstar said, is that this was not supposed to be in the

29:02.060 --> 29:03.060
Yeah.

29:03.060 --> 29:04.060
Alright.

29:04.060 --> 29:05.060
So, then what happened?

29:05.060 --> 29:10.500
So, of course, politicians got to use this as their ammunition for their own bills.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.820
Remember when I commented on sexually repressing lieutenant people?

29:13.820 --> 29:15.380
Yes, exactly.

29:15.380 --> 29:21.020
So, you know, of course this news comes out and so what do they do, you know, freaking

29:21.020 --> 29:27.900
California Assemblyman Leland Yee issued a press release calling on Take-Two and the

29:27.900 --> 29:37.100
the ESRB to stop deceiving parents and he said, and I quote, the ESRB again has failed

29:37.100 --> 29:42.620
our parents and it's clearly shown that they cannot police themselves. Plain and simple,

29:42.620 --> 29:46.980
the current rating system is drastically flawed and here is yet another reason why we need

29:46.980 --> 29:54.460
legislation to assist parents and protect children. Wow, somebody didn't do their research

29:54.460 --> 29:58.300
at all before coming out and sound like a complete jackass

29:58.300 --> 30:04.100
so excellent by the way he was also one of the

30:04.100 --> 30:09.140
politicians to pick up on the hot coffee scandal comments from chat room

30:09.140 --> 30:12.620
let's see black wolf says

30:12.620 --> 30:16.020
no it was actually the way they did their 3d models

30:16.020 --> 30:19.820
the bra object was on top of the nudie object and you could not remove the bra

30:19.820 --> 30:21.260
object without a mod

30:21.260 --> 30:25.020
So I guess the boobs were just there to make it more realistic still I

30:25.740 --> 30:31.740
Okay, so whatever it was for a more complex reason still the boobies were not meant to be seen by themselves

30:32.180 --> 30:38.420
Okay, so like what if you have a movie and you have someone walk around in their undies? Well, they could have that edited off

30:38.940 --> 30:41.780
That's true digital editing. Oh, we could go back

30:41.780 --> 30:47.460
You know that scene with Tom deleted scenes pull off the you know stuff that scene with Tom Cruise from risky business

30:47.460 --> 30:52.620
We could just digitally edit in a schlong, and is that going to get the movie re-rated

30:52.620 --> 30:53.620
in NC-17?

30:53.620 --> 31:00.860
What was that movie where if you freeze frame it at just the right point, you can see his

31:00.860 --> 31:01.860
schlong?

31:01.860 --> 31:06.280
That happens in movies all the time where you might see a titty or you might see a schlong

31:06.280 --> 31:07.860
if you pause it at just the right moment.

31:07.860 --> 31:12.060
There are several movies that are like that.

31:12.060 --> 31:17.060
Austin Powers, there's a scene where, what's her name, Elizabeth Hurley, where he moves

31:17.060 --> 31:21.880
like the piece of fruit at just the wrong time and you can see the red tape over her.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.740
That actually was pointed out to me, by the way.

31:23.740 --> 31:27.020
R. Seth in the chat room says, Leland Yee is a respectable man, I suppose.

31:27.020 --> 31:30.180
He just needs to learn what the hell he's talking about before he blasts video games,

31:30.180 --> 31:31.180
it seems.

31:31.180 --> 31:38.100
I agree 100% with that statement applied to about 99% of politicians out there right now.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.340
Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter.

31:39.340 --> 31:41.420
They all need to do their research on this subject.

31:41.420 --> 31:46.340
Exactly. I don't mind them coming after if like an actual company out there, like say

31:46.340 --> 31:55.400
for example, we were to find out tomorrow that EA with Sims 2 purposefully left in nudity

31:55.400 --> 32:01.240
and say there's child sex in the game or something like that, then yes, then they need

32:01.240 --> 32:05.340
to come after them and say, okay, you need to re-rate this and you probably need to remove

32:05.340 --> 32:10.740
this content. Whereas, if this wasn't meant to be in the game and someone added it in

32:10.740 --> 32:15.500
with a third-party patch or hack, thatís a little different.

32:15.500 --> 32:19.980
They need to do their research.

32:19.980 --> 32:24.940
The gaming community is getting a little ticked off too, and specifically we have John Romero.

32:24.940 --> 32:28.260
You know him as one of the co-founders of ID Software.

32:28.260 --> 32:34.860
He went off on his blog about this whole re-rating fiasco, and he was saying, ìModders are not

32:34.860 --> 32:36.020
screwing up the industry.

32:36.020 --> 32:41.340
They are supposed to be helping.

32:41.340 --> 32:45.580
He fears that developers are going to have to basically make their games tougher to hack

32:45.580 --> 32:48.740
to avoid these rerating incidents in the future.

32:48.740 --> 33:05.940
They have been doing this crap for years though.

33:05.940 --> 33:12.220
There was a Game Boy hack ROM for the Legend of Zelda game that was on that, where Link

33:12.220 --> 33:16.780
looked like a little troll and was carrying around a giant penis.

33:16.780 --> 33:20.260
What was one of the first games that everybody and their mom was hacking?

33:20.260 --> 33:21.260
Doom?

33:21.260 --> 33:26.180
There were even games that were released that were like that.

33:26.180 --> 33:33.800
You know what pisses me off most about this, and maybe I'm getting a little political here

33:33.800 --> 33:38.720
but I donít care, what is the big deal about a couple of boobs?

33:38.720 --> 33:44.280
I mean seriously, Oblivion is a really violent game, actually thereís a lot, I donít even

33:44.280 --> 33:48.600
have to pick on Oblivion, thereís a lot of very, very violent video games out there,

33:48.600 --> 33:52.040
yet it takes a set of boobs to get your game rated M.

33:52.040 --> 33:53.040
I have a theory.

33:53.040 --> 33:57.120
I donít get this at all, I mean this is just my rant on society.

33:57.120 --> 34:01.540
You know I may not be a father yet but someday I hope to and I know that one of the way I

34:01.540 --> 34:10.640
I plan to raise my kid is that if I am screening the movies that my child, him or her is going

34:10.640 --> 34:15.280
to see, I would much rather my child see something with sex or the F word in it.

34:15.280 --> 34:19.120
Not that I am going to encourage it, but when I am screening movies, sex and F word is like

34:19.120 --> 34:21.780
a little lower on the scale than violence.

34:21.780 --> 34:24.940
I think violence is more of a reason to not let your kid see a movie.

34:24.940 --> 34:25.940
I don't want my kid to see that.

34:25.940 --> 34:29.180
Seriously, would you rather have your kids having sex or would you rather them killing

34:29.180 --> 34:30.180
people?

34:30.180 --> 34:31.180
Or how about learning about safe sex?

34:31.180 --> 34:36.340
Well, keep in mind also, you know, from the average child perspective,

34:36.820 --> 34:41.000
the thing that you cannot do becomes all the more attractive, you know?

34:41.640 --> 34:45.840
And I think that they either, you know, with this type of environment,

34:45.840 --> 34:49.840
with that much repression of what they see, they're either going to grow

34:49.840 --> 34:53.940
up to be really fucked up in the head is what I think.

34:53.940 --> 34:58.860
You know, not knowing the right way to do things, not knowing the reality, because there was,

34:58.860 --> 35:04.020
As an example, one of my friends, her best friend growing up, was not allowed to watch

35:04.020 --> 35:06.700
the news, was not allowed to watch violent movies, was not allowed to watch anything

35:06.700 --> 35:08.400
that wasn't G-rated.

35:08.400 --> 35:12.740
When she graduated high school, she had no idea how the world worked.

35:12.740 --> 35:17.540
She didn't learn anything but from her friends because she grew up in such a sheltered environment.

35:17.540 --> 35:19.580
She wasn't allowed to go out or anything.

35:19.580 --> 35:37.040
My example on this is that she thought that oral sex was just talking about it.

35:37.040 --> 35:40.940
I'm afraid that if things like this are allowed to happen, we're going to see more

35:40.940 --> 35:46.420
kids growing up without having any type of concept of what the world is like or how to

35:46.420 --> 35:48.700
interact or anything like that.

35:48.700 --> 35:52.140
You ever notice this about violent movies, that in violent movies, a lot of times the

35:52.140 --> 35:55.960
person causing the violence is the hero, like you look at The Terminator, an incredibly

35:55.960 --> 35:59.980
violent movie, but you cheer on Arnold and you're like, yeah, kick some ass, blow those

35:59.980 --> 36:00.980
guys up.

36:00.980 --> 36:05.260
Yet in a movie that's about sex, like you take a movie like Unfaithful or something,

36:05.260 --> 36:10.040
there are sad endings to those movies and you learn about the consequence of unsafe

36:10.040 --> 36:14.340
sex and screwing around on monogamous relationships and things.

36:14.340 --> 36:19.660
I'm not trying to say all movies make sex look bad, but usually, I've noticed in the

36:19.660 --> 36:25.840
movies I've seen, irresponsible sex in movies leads to bad news, whereas gratuitous violence

36:25.840 --> 36:27.600
in movies leads to good news.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.300
What the hell type of message is that?

36:29.300 --> 36:36.960
I'm really thinking that we've got this sort of vicious cycle going on because the more

36:36.960 --> 36:41.260
the government steps in, and this has actually been something that's happened since the

36:41.260 --> 36:45.620
the late 80s that we've seen the government stepping in, I'll bring this up as a point

36:45.620 --> 36:51.860
and it also is more you know jackass involved in it, but the whole cop killer thing, remember

36:51.860 --> 36:52.860
that?

36:52.860 --> 36:56.460
Remember, he was also responsible for the whole Two Life crew business?

36:56.460 --> 36:57.460
Remember that?

36:57.460 --> 37:02.020
Well, keep in mind that since we've had this cycle of going through of having the government

37:02.020 --> 37:06.820
step in and try to say, hey, we can't do that, this is bad, we've seen an increase in this

37:06.820 --> 37:09.380
type of game or this type of movie.

37:09.380 --> 37:13.160
We have seen people want more and more the more that other people say you can't have

37:13.160 --> 37:14.160
it.

37:14.160 --> 37:21.560
Again, it is like Sakarina said, the forbidden fruit syndrome, that is fully what it is.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.400
This is something that stays with you.

37:23.400 --> 37:28.080
The more you can't have something, the more you want it, the demand keeps growing.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.400
This didn't make the show roll for tonight, but it just makes me think as well that I

37:31.400 --> 37:35.480
heard about there was some sex game that got banned from E3 and I'm sorry, I don't have

37:35.480 --> 37:39.040
the story in front of me, but E3 said that some game couldn't be exhibited on the floor

37:39.040 --> 37:42.840
because it's mostly about sex and it just kind of made me go three fields no

37:42.840 --> 37:47.740
it's not it wasn't that it was it was uh the lady that's very well known for her

37:47.740 --> 37:50.800
sex in the games I'm sure somebody in chat rooms gonna yell it out momentarily

37:50.800 --> 37:56.000
here but they were banned from the e3 floor and I'm thinking why why no one

37:56.000 --> 38:00.160
under 18 allowed anyway exactly and if they don't freakin need to get him

38:00.160 --> 38:03.400
kicked out I mean that's why I don't get about the whole booth babe naughty

38:03.400 --> 38:08.320
America thank you naughty America see I knew they'd yell it out but I just think

38:08.320 --> 38:22.080
We are a repressed society, there are way too many people in power who are not getting

38:22.080 --> 38:27.520
the nookie or something, or if they're getting it, it's all dry and stale, I don't know.

38:27.520 --> 38:31.440
We do have a worldwide audience though, so some folks are probably listening to us bitching

38:31.440 --> 38:32.440
going, you know...

38:32.440 --> 38:33.920
We should start our own country.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.240
Maybe we just need more political parties in this country.

38:37.240 --> 38:49.960
We have too many people who are not willing to move away from this bipartisan bullshit

38:49.960 --> 38:52.720
that we've got.

38:52.720 --> 38:53.720
This is how I feel about it.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.480
I feel very strongly about this.

38:55.480 --> 39:01.760
There are too many people who when they vote for a certain politician, let's say for the

39:01.760 --> 39:05.320
presidential election, they vote straight ticket because they haven't taken the time

39:05.320 --> 39:06.400
to research.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.700
They do not realize that they are the ones who have fucked this up for themselves.

39:09.700 --> 39:11.540
It is their fault.

39:11.540 --> 39:14.780
The primary voters in this country, it is your fault.

39:14.780 --> 39:15.780
Educate yourself.

39:15.780 --> 39:16.780
I'm serious.

39:16.780 --> 39:19.540
You can send those cards and letters to Mailbag at orangelumsreader.com.

39:19.540 --> 39:20.920
I have made no secret of this.

39:20.920 --> 39:27.060
I think that it's because the people of this country keep putting these types of people

39:27.060 --> 39:34.700
in power that we see, I think that the majority of people enjoy being repressed and uninformed.

39:34.700 --> 39:39.420
I think they like being ignorant because usually when you find out something, a friend of mine

39:39.420 --> 39:44.700
has a quote that says, the truth will set you free but first it will piss you off.

39:44.700 --> 39:48.380
Interesting comment from the chat room, Blaze says, Japan is much more open about sex and

39:48.380 --> 39:52.060
their rape rate is like less than 1% of all people.

39:52.060 --> 39:55.140
I don't know where that quote is from but it's an interesting comment.

39:55.140 --> 39:59.060
They actually have a thing going on with a lot of wives while their husbands are on business

39:59.060 --> 40:01.300
trips and this is actually a business arrangement.

40:01.300 --> 40:06.900
They will basically sell their services.

40:06.900 --> 40:10.200
It's very common for a man to have a mistress and have his wife because his mistress will

40:10.200 --> 40:14.340
be the one to engage him socially, whereas the wife will be the one to take care of the

40:14.340 --> 40:17.260
house and raise the kids and be the goddess of her domain.

40:17.260 --> 40:20.980
How does this tie into boobies and oblivion again?

40:20.980 --> 40:23.180
I think we got off subject.

40:23.180 --> 40:31.480
of the whole thing that it is these close-minded, ignorant people who are going through and

40:31.480 --> 40:35.740
wanting this type of thing taken out from mainstream availability.

40:35.740 --> 40:37.540
I think we need more of it, honestly.

40:37.540 --> 40:43.500
Maybe if more people are seeing the boobies, they won't go out raping people.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.500
Politics chat here on OLR.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.500
No, it's okay.

40:45.500 --> 40:48.420
It's necessary once in a while.

40:48.420 --> 40:52.740
We have a large audience that's over 18 as well as under 18.

40:52.740 --> 40:58.240
I didn't mean to go off, it's something that I feel very strongly about, I really

40:58.240 --> 40:59.800
feel very strongly about it.

40:59.800 --> 41:03.960
Let's get back into the discussion on violent games, Dark Sakura.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.920
I like violence!

41:06.920 --> 41:12.360
I don't like this game very much because first-person shooters make me nauseous, literally.

41:12.360 --> 41:15.480
We have a lot of people who are into these types of games.

41:15.480 --> 41:21.120
The next Call of Duty game is not going to be out on the PC.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.920
Activision is basically stating, and I quote,

41:23.920 --> 41:26.160
it's not a PC product, it's a console product,

41:26.160 --> 41:28.260
and it's all next gen.

41:28.260 --> 41:31.480
Doesn't mean that there's not going to be any more on the PC.

41:31.480 --> 41:34.760
I mean, we did see other versions released

41:34.760 --> 41:40.360
on PS2, Xbox, GameCube, Xbox 360.

41:40.360 --> 41:43.960
But they are going to stick it so far strictly

41:43.960 --> 41:46.040
to the next gen consoles.

41:46.040 --> 41:47.880
There was also a question going about

41:47.880 --> 41:50.960
if Infinity Ward's doing this year's console title

41:50.960 --> 42:00.720
themselves for Call of Duty and that has actually been seen to be left unanswered

42:00.720 --> 42:06.200
so far. They also released the big red one last year.

42:06.200 --> 42:12.320
All right. But no Call of Duty on your PC. Well there's a lot of PC gamers out

42:12.320 --> 42:16.940
there who are very sad at that but I guess you know it looks like developers

42:16.940 --> 42:20.040
a lot of them are focusing their attention on console games and you know

42:20.040 --> 42:22.980
PC games just kind of a different market. There's a different type of game that's

42:22.980 --> 42:24.020
successful there.

42:24.020 --> 42:28.100
There's actually a really good first-person shooter making it out

42:28.100 --> 42:31.720
onto the Xbox 360.

42:31.720 --> 42:34.940
I heard about that.

42:34.940 --> 42:38.160
I actually found that out from my husband today.

42:38.160 --> 42:41.820
He's pretty excited about that. There's actually going to be a good first-person shooter.

42:41.820 --> 42:46.960
Loki, we had a rumor last week. I know you weren't here. We had a rumor last week

42:46.960 --> 42:48.860
about this, but we got confirmation. What is it?

42:48.860 --> 42:54.560
Well, it's sort of confirmation. Basically, according to an EB Games employee, Nintendo

42:54.560 --> 43:03.160
has sent posters including a blank GameCube branded new low price sticker. So basically

43:03.160 --> 43:08.440
they're getting the P.O.P. now at these stores for a price change for the GameCube, which

43:08.440 --> 43:14.960
I'm sure they're going to announce at their conference on Tuesday. So, the guess on the

43:14.960 --> 43:18.680
the price right now is that they're going to drop at the $79.99 for the GameCube. So

43:18.680 --> 43:24.400
we'll have to wait until a few more days here before we find out when that's going to happen.

43:24.400 --> 43:29.080
I'm guessing, though, it's got to be at the press conference.

43:29.080 --> 43:30.280
Which is Tuesday, right?

43:30.280 --> 43:37.360
That is correct. I don't know. With all the wee excitement, I guess GameCube will just

43:37.360 --> 43:41.120
be kind of a budget thing. It's like, let's get the kids one for their room. It's basically

43:41.120 --> 43:42.120
what it's going to turn into.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.120
That's what the 64 is.

43:43.120 --> 43:47.260
You know, they still have Nintendo 64 at McDonald's, some of them.

43:47.260 --> 43:48.260
They still advertise them.

43:48.260 --> 43:52.600
Like when I was in LA, I drove by McDonald's and actually still was advertising the Nintendo

43:52.600 --> 43:54.240
64 on one of their things.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.540
I thought that was very interesting.

43:55.540 --> 43:57.420
That is hilarious.

43:57.420 --> 44:00.780
Which might explain why you don't see Los Angeles on this list.

44:00.780 --> 44:01.780
I don't know.

44:01.780 --> 44:05.220
It's the top video game cities in America.

44:05.220 --> 44:10.640
It was a survey commissioned by Sperling for Best Places and Microsoft.

44:10.640 --> 44:15.900
It rated Seattle, Washington as the top video game city in America.

44:15.900 --> 44:33.980
However, the survey what they were doing is they were taken into account the number of

44:33.980 --> 44:38.260
video game systems owned per household, the number of game purchased, the number of game

44:38.260 --> 44:43.220
Reynolds and the frequency of online gameplay, whether it be Xbox Live or Windows games as

44:43.220 --> 44:44.820
well as other factors.

44:44.820 --> 44:50.620
The other top 10, number 10, Philadelphia, number 9, San Diego, number 8, Boston, number

44:50.620 --> 44:56.940
7, St. Louis, number 6, Washington, D.C., number 5, Phoenix, Mesa, number 4, Detroit,

44:56.940 --> 45:02.980
number 3, Hotlanta, number 2, Minneapolis, St. Paul, and number 1, of course, Seattle.

45:02.980 --> 45:07.660
Our close by neighbor San Francisco is number 14, but here in Sacramento, we don't make

45:07.660 --> 45:12.460
the cut, but neither does Los Angeles, which I find very interesting.

45:12.460 --> 45:15.260
Los Angeles does not make the cut as well.

45:15.260 --> 45:18.500
I wonder if it would have tilted it in Sacramento's favor if they had actually interviewed me

45:18.500 --> 45:19.500
and Dan.

45:19.500 --> 45:22.620
That would have been hilarious.

45:22.620 --> 45:23.620
Who knows?

45:23.620 --> 45:24.620
Who knows?

45:24.620 --> 45:29.180
But see, for every you and Dan, there's 100,000 people that don't own any systems, so you

45:29.180 --> 45:32.420
just have to remember.

45:32.420 --> 45:35.700
Interesting comment from the chat room there, Funny Dale says, Seattle is number one only

45:35.700 --> 45:39.540
because everyone has to stay inside because it always rains.

45:39.540 --> 45:41.700
True. Interesting point.

45:41.700 --> 45:44.460
It does have the highest precipitation rate in the country.

45:44.460 --> 45:47.340
Does it have a pretty high suicide rate too?

45:47.340 --> 45:49.380
I don't know. Anyway.

45:49.380 --> 45:50.660
Sorry to make it morbid.

45:50.660 --> 45:55.940
Loki's gonna tell us about a nice, fun, happy game to take our minds off of that.

45:55.940 --> 45:57.340
Yes.

45:57.340 --> 46:01.540
Hot Pixel is a new game by Atari for the PSP.

46:01.540 --> 46:05.580
It's going to be just like WarioWare, it's going to feature hundreds of tiny 5 second

46:05.580 --> 46:06.580
games.

46:06.580 --> 46:11.540
We actually have pictures of this on our E3, on the PSP website by the way.

46:11.540 --> 46:12.540
And it looks pretty cool.

46:12.540 --> 46:14.040
It's just lots of weird stuff.

46:14.040 --> 46:20.380
It's all going to have kind of an urban spin on it, so it's going to have a lot of digital

46:20.380 --> 46:22.660
street culture stuff.

46:22.660 --> 46:23.660
That was one of them.

46:23.660 --> 46:27.980
There's actually another game I remember reading that was under, I can't remember what it was

46:27.980 --> 46:38.460
released in Japan as, but it's coming out over here at WTF, called Work Time Fun, and

46:38.460 --> 46:42.820
it's going to be another mini-game type of thing also for the PSP, and that one should

46:42.820 --> 46:43.980
be pretty interesting too.

46:43.980 --> 46:45.380
But I'm looking forward to checking this out.

46:45.380 --> 46:49.820
They're going to have this actually at E3 I believe, and it's due out this fall.

46:49.820 --> 46:50.820
I like this.

46:50.820 --> 46:56.580
In our chat room, DJ Jenai says, since this is on the PSP, will they make a game called

46:56.580 --> 47:01.700
Dead Pixel, get it, because PSPs have the dead pixels?

47:01.700 --> 47:03.780
Nice, winner.

47:03.780 --> 47:06.420
Comedy in Orange Lounge Chat, orangeloungeradio.com, click on the chat.

47:06.420 --> 47:08.940
I wonder if that should go in the toilet paper joke book.

47:08.940 --> 47:13.460
Alright, we're also going to find some comedy in our mailbag right now, at least I don't

47:13.460 --> 47:16.340
know if there's any funny stuff in there, but we'll soon find out.

47:16.340 --> 47:20.760
Every week you guys send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and Dark

47:20.760 --> 47:25.520
Sakura picks out her favorites and brings them to us here on Orange Lounge Radio Live

47:25.520 --> 47:30.120
each and every week. So it's actually been a little while since we've dived into the mailbag, so

47:30.120 --> 47:34.360
we're going to go in there right now, Dark Sakura, put on your rubber gloves,

47:34.360 --> 47:37.640
dig in there, and pull something out.

47:37.640 --> 47:41.120
Ew! Mailbag at orangeontrader.com.

47:41.120 --> 47:45.160
We actually got a really cool email from Zohar, who is one of our Serbian

47:45.160 --> 47:45.880
listeners,

47:45.880 --> 47:50.400
thanks to a little bit of silliness that we had last week regarding

47:50.400 --> 47:54.200
actionscript.org. Yeah, the one where we talk about the different

47:54.200 --> 47:58.680
They had a Serbian translation available, which I was like, why?

47:58.680 --> 48:03.200
Yeah, I think we made an off-handed comment that like, you know, if you need that.

48:03.200 --> 48:07.000
No, it was cool, but it struck me as very strange because it's the only technical side

48:07.000 --> 48:09.120
I've seen with Serbian translation on it.

48:09.120 --> 48:14.440
I mean, it was cool, but I was like, that's so random, you know, that was how I thought.

48:14.440 --> 48:17.000
So hope we didn't offend any of our Serbian listeners.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.240
We were just kind of surprised.

48:18.240 --> 48:23.440
Usually, you know, Spanish, not so surprising when you're here, Russian, Japanese, you know,

48:23.440 --> 48:40.820
I am a Serbian listener, I just wanted to say that you guys probably have a lot of listeners

48:40.820 --> 48:43.360
in many different races from many different countries.

48:43.360 --> 48:46.360
I am not sure how many Serbian listeners you have, but I just wanted to say that I am one

48:46.360 --> 48:47.360
of them.

48:47.360 --> 48:49.640
I hope that one day everybody in the world will be listening to OLR.

48:49.640 --> 48:55.640
I'm glad they're not upset over the comment, because we didn't mean it offensively.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.640
No, we certainly didn't mean it that way.

48:57.640 --> 49:00.640
It was just random.

49:00.640 --> 49:07.640
This is actually a response to an email complaining about the wee.

49:07.640 --> 49:10.640
It's like what children call urine.

49:10.640 --> 49:12.640
Here we go again.

49:12.640 --> 49:15.640
I'm going to give this author the benefit of the doubt that the email was written

49:15.640 --> 49:18.640
one or two days after the announcement when those jokes weren't old yet.

49:18.640 --> 49:19.640
old yet.

49:19.640 --> 49:21.220
It was sent by Bear Who Drive Car.

49:21.220 --> 49:22.220
I do like that.

49:22.220 --> 49:24.220
I do love that name.

49:24.220 --> 49:29.260
The last part of this was, so I posed this question to you, gurus of gaming, and it said

49:29.260 --> 49:30.260
Dark Sklokey.

49:30.260 --> 49:31.260
Dark Sklokey?

49:31.260 --> 49:32.260
Okay, whatever.

49:32.260 --> 49:38.400
What are the best and worst console games, console names in video game history?

49:38.400 --> 49:40.280
My vote Dreamcast best.

49:40.280 --> 49:44.520
And I had actually replied saying my favorite, my personal favorite system name is probably

49:44.520 --> 49:48.360
Dreamcast as well, although I like PC Engine Duo, it just sounds cool, rolls off the tongue,

49:48.360 --> 49:53.840
Worst ever, Fairchild Channel F, which is also a horrible system, and the Pico, which

49:53.840 --> 49:57.120
makes me think of salsa.

49:57.120 --> 50:01.960
And then I got a response back that says, �Also, I have not heard one female call

50:01.960 --> 50:05.480
into your show nor one female guest come on the show since you started taking calls and

50:05.480 --> 50:06.480
doing interviews.

50:06.480 --> 50:11.360
Being the only vocal female representation in the OLR, at least in podcast form, presents.

50:11.360 --> 50:15.340
Do you feel an increased sense of responsibility, Dark Sakura, in being the honorary estrogen

50:15.340 --> 50:17.040
ambassador?� I love that.

50:17.040 --> 50:18.760
The estrogen ambassador.

50:18.760 --> 50:22.400
Perhaps the awareness of this problem will motivate you to include a segment to promote

50:22.400 --> 50:24.040
female awareness on your fine program.

50:24.040 --> 50:27.560
I know you guys have discussed the problems and stereotypes that male gamers have for

50:27.560 --> 50:28.560
female gamers.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.120
I say the power is yours.

50:30.120 --> 50:34.840
I've actually been sort of working on something like that, just schools kicking my ass.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.240
We've had Roz called in just a couple of weeks ago, didn't we?

50:37.240 --> 50:38.240
We've had Roz.

50:38.240 --> 50:45.120
We've had Mistress Tia, who is not necessarily a gamer, but she definitely has estrogen.

50:45.120 --> 50:49.420
Most of the girls were on the program before we switched over to this new format where

50:49.420 --> 50:53.620
our live show is being podcasted and when we were doing the podcast for the first year,

50:53.620 --> 50:55.840
we never had special guests.

50:55.840 --> 51:02.080
So we had, what, we had DDR Angel, we had Iguana Girl, Mistress Tia, so it's just been

51:02.080 --> 51:03.080
a while.

51:03.080 --> 51:06.080
So I have to kidnap a few more of my females.

51:06.080 --> 51:07.080
We've had Julie.

51:07.080 --> 51:11.780
Yeah, but get Iguana Girl on the show because I know she's a gamer too, but I know she's

51:11.780 --> 51:12.780
been busy.

51:12.780 --> 51:16.780
She didn't come on the show because it was my birthday thing the other week.

51:16.780 --> 51:21.780
I'll have to bring my good friend Disney Punk 10 up here.

51:21.780 --> 51:25.780
She's into Kingdom Hearts and a lot of the same games that I do.

51:25.780 --> 51:29.780
Best console name and worst console name? I have answers, I think.

51:29.780 --> 51:36.780
I know you might find this a little silly, but I actually really like the name Jaguar for a system.

51:36.780 --> 51:39.780
I thought it was kind of cool, even though the system itself kind of stuck.

51:39.780 --> 51:42.580
stuck. It does have the best version of Tempest.

51:42.580 --> 51:45.620
Worst console name, Philips CDI.

51:45.620 --> 51:48.980
That doesn't tell me anything.

51:48.980 --> 51:52.100
It plays CDs. Anything you want to add to that?

51:52.100 --> 51:55.180
Well, no, because the Fairchild Channel F, it's like

51:55.180 --> 51:59.900
why am I gonna play a channel something? And it was also just a really piece of shit

51:59.900 --> 52:04.740
system. Also, another one I thought had a really good name, though, was The Odyssey II.

52:04.740 --> 52:08.220
Because it's like, ooh, it's a gaming journey

52:08.220 --> 52:11.820
in 1978 when I was two years old.

52:11.820 --> 52:16.660
Do the math kids. So... More mail.

52:16.660 --> 52:19.700
More mail. I like mail. I mean

52:19.700 --> 52:22.780
I like me. Yeah.

52:22.780 --> 52:27.100
I got an email from Rob who sends

52:27.100 --> 52:31.300
a link found on a dig which I am going to

52:31.300 --> 52:36.140
open at this time because I sort of didn't. It was the unluckiest

52:36.140 --> 52:40.540
uh... xbox 360 owner oh god I heard about this guy

52:40.540 --> 52:42.660
who apparently uh...

52:42.660 --> 52:48.880
has kept getting a broken system uh... the guy's name is Chris Zarek

52:48.880 --> 52:50.260
uh...

52:50.260 --> 52:51.200
he uh...

52:51.200 --> 52:51.940
purchased

52:51.940 --> 52:54.460
he's actually on his fourth xbox 360

52:54.460 --> 52:58.660
because of quality issues with uh... earlier machines

52:58.660 --> 53:01.220
uh...

53:01.220 --> 53:03.980
there's a actually it's uh...

53:03.980 --> 53:09.540
something very interesting that was a nice summary that was posted by Rob in this email.

53:09.540 --> 53:15.480
It's like, number one, five percent customer failure, dissatisfaction rate, one bad system

53:15.480 --> 53:21.020
one in twenty, two bad systems one in four hundred, three systems one in eight thousand.

53:21.020 --> 53:25.540
To get three in a row that had faulty issues with it?

53:25.540 --> 53:28.260
God, and I was pissed when I got the one.

53:28.260 --> 53:32.100
Yeah, you either have to be really lucky or a really big liar.

53:32.100 --> 53:33.700
He had the blinking red lights.

53:33.700 --> 53:37.760
Go buy a lottery ticket, dude. I'm calling bullshit on this story. I think he's a fucking

53:37.760 --> 53:43.040
liar. Really? No, they're sitting with him with the last Xbox and the games? I think

53:43.040 --> 53:47.760
he took all the worst possible case scenarios and just made up a damn story about it. From

53:47.760 --> 53:51.640
what I'm seeing on here, I think every one of them had the blinking red light issue where

53:51.640 --> 53:58.780
it wouldn't turn on. Yeah, that's the only issue. Well, that's the most common issue.

53:58.780 --> 54:02.400
I've actually known someone who's turned in too for the same thing. Wow. I would have

54:02.400 --> 54:05.600
so pissed if I got a second one well you know we should probably talk to Dan and

54:05.600 --> 54:09.840
ask him how often he gets returns or how many people have had to return them

54:09.840 --> 54:12.720
several times in a row I don't need to get Dan back on the show I tried to get

54:12.720 --> 54:19.060
him on today but I actually fully believe it with the number of faulty

54:19.060 --> 54:30.320
issues I was hearing with that I 100% believe it also there was an article he

54:30.320 --> 54:36.440
he also sent me from Slashdot about what your next generation system preference

54:36.440 --> 54:41.360
says about you. What if I won it all? Does that just make me greedy?

54:41.360 --> 54:44.520
Yeah, it makes you very greedy. I guess I'm really greedy.

54:44.520 --> 54:49.360
But there was a study done with the IGN people that says 36% claim loyalty to

54:49.360 --> 54:50.280
the PlayStation 3,

54:50.280 --> 54:54.520
28% to the Xbox 360, 22% are interested in the Wii.

54:54.520 --> 54:57.920
Undecided gamers are a minority. Only 4%

54:57.920 --> 55:01.160
have not decided. Now there's also lifestyle

55:01.160 --> 55:05.280
decisions that are associated with that.

55:05.280 --> 55:09.600
I'm just going to go off this chart here

55:09.600 --> 55:13.200
that the people who

55:13.200 --> 55:16.400
were undecided PS3 and 360

55:16.400 --> 55:19.960
for their favorite handheld is the PSP.

55:19.960 --> 55:24.120
For people who are buying the Wii, it's the DS. No shock there because

55:24.120 --> 55:28.580
because in order to have put down the Wii when we have not really seen the

55:28.580 --> 55:29.080
system

55:29.080 --> 55:32.280
at all in any way, you would have to be a Nintendo fanboy.

55:32.280 --> 55:35.200
Also what band do you enjoy most listening to?

55:35.200 --> 55:38.640
This is the part I like. The Undecided group and the Wii group both are

55:38.640 --> 55:44.920
Gorillaz fans. PS3 owners listen to M&M and Xbox 360 owners listen to Nirvana.

55:44.920 --> 55:50.280
What's your favorite TV drama? I guess that means I ain't getting a PS3

55:50.280 --> 55:54.080
because I'm not a big M&M fan, but the other two are fine, but the M&M

55:54.080 --> 55:55.080
I'm not a big fan of him.

55:55.080 --> 55:56.080
This is just statistical data.

55:56.080 --> 55:58.000
What's your favorite TV drama?

55:58.000 --> 56:05.640
Undecided and Xbox 360 all lost, PS3 owners like 24, and we potential owners are looking

56:05.640 --> 56:06.640
for Smallville.

56:06.640 --> 56:11.480
Hey, Smallville is actually decent.

56:11.480 --> 56:14.200
Some episodes are kind of crap, but Lex is cute.

56:14.200 --> 56:16.360
So also, do you own-

56:16.360 --> 56:17.360
Yeah, I know.

56:17.360 --> 56:18.360
I'm just shaking my head over here.

56:18.360 --> 56:19.360
Hey, I'm trying to read.

56:19.360 --> 56:20.640
Just that whole WB thing.

56:20.640 --> 56:25.120
One of the questions is, do you own a TiVo or a digital video recorder?

56:25.120 --> 56:31.040
19% were in the undecided group, 29% were in the PS3 group, 32% were in the Xbox 360

56:31.040 --> 56:32.880
group, and the Wii group was 24.

56:32.880 --> 56:35.520
There's two more sections.

56:35.520 --> 56:37.240
Have you been to the movies in the last 30 days?

56:37.240 --> 56:43.280
The greatest group of these were the PS3 and Xbox 360 players at 64 and 61%, respectively.

56:43.280 --> 56:45.240
And the last is, do you own an iPod?

56:45.240 --> 56:48.720
And the majority of those were the Xbox 360 group.

56:48.720 --> 56:54.360
actually a tie between Undecided and PS3.

56:54.360 --> 56:58.200
Although it's interesting, I call BS on the survey because it leaves no room for the people

56:58.200 --> 56:59.760
who are still on the fence.

56:59.760 --> 57:11.480
Considering how little we know about PlayStation 3 and Wii, you're basically asking whose fan

57:11.480 --> 57:12.480
boy are you?

57:12.480 --> 57:13.480
Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo?

57:13.480 --> 57:16.640
That's what you're asking because the only one of those systems you can really say you

57:16.640 --> 57:22.040
know something about the 360. But keep in mind the vast majority of people are

57:22.040 --> 57:29.980
still relatively uninformed. I do like actually how the survey was said it

57:29.980 --> 57:34.160
actually gives a pretty interesting perspective I think but I mean you are

57:34.160 --> 57:37.120
right with the Xbox 360 being the one of course we know the most about because

57:37.120 --> 57:42.720
it's already out still I think that is actually a pretty a pretty interesting

57:42.720 --> 57:48.600
comparison I'm going over to our chat room for a comment Tigerclaw wants to

57:48.600 --> 57:51.560
know speaking of Smallville have you guys seen the new Superman Returns

57:51.560 --> 57:55.480
trailer yes and I'm hoping that this guy doesn't die or break his neck or follow

57:55.480 --> 58:02.760
the curse billions that's all hey I hope he doesn't follow the curse I'm waiting

58:02.760 --> 58:05.920
to see if the Superman curse is gonna get this guy it didn't hit Dean Cain

58:05.920 --> 58:12.480
though did you notice I did I did except for his career yeah anyway she's doing

58:12.480 --> 58:15.400
cell phone commercials I think that's true she didn't go the way of Margo

58:15.400 --> 58:23.280
kidder because that bitch was crazy anyway okay um a email from Mark says

58:23.280 --> 58:27.440
hey lol I love the show quick question I was in the store the other day and saw a

58:27.440 --> 58:32.400
network adapter for the Nintendo GameCube what the hell is this for not

58:32.400 --> 58:35.760
much not a lot not even a good paperweight because it doesn't weigh

58:35.760 --> 58:41.200
much if you want to play PSO on your GameCube wait or not yeah PSO I want to

58:41.200 --> 58:45.480
PSU, but that's the new game. If you want to play PSO on your GameCube, that's the reason

58:45.480 --> 58:51.460
to have one. Otherwise, this will do nothing for you because Nintendo did not support internet

58:51.460 --> 58:55.920
gaming very well with the GameCube, and that's what I say killed them in the competition.

58:55.920 --> 59:00.880
I think that's very funny, given that they had the Satellaview back in the day in Japan.

59:00.880 --> 59:04.000
However, using PSO, you could browse the internet, right? I think.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
I think so.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
Do I remember right?

59:06.000 --> 59:12.000
I don't think they had an actual browsing disk though for the GameCube.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Well, a lot of the other systems, they actually release browser disks.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
You know, honestly though, PSO on the GameCube is worthless.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
The Xbox version is superior, mostly because of the voice chat.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
There are other items in the GameCube one.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
Yeah, but you know, I just...

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
Which are all on Blueburst.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
I'm not a big fan of the Nintendo version.

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
There's other things I like about the GameCube, don't get me wrong, but PSO is not one of them.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
We also have one more email.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Okay.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.820
from uh...

59:36.820 --> 59:38.580
i guess it's doralee

59:38.580 --> 59:39.820
is how it would be pronounced

59:39.820 --> 59:43.680
um... first off love the show next a couple of shows back you guys talked about a

59:43.680 --> 59:45.280
silent hill fan film

59:45.280 --> 59:48.080
any idea where i can get that any help would be great

59:48.080 --> 59:51.880
i know this is a busy week so just drop me a line later if you can thanks

59:51.880 --> 59:54.040
uh... yeah you can find it on youtube

59:54.040 --> 59:56.160
uh... you can find everything on youtube

59:56.160 --> 59:59.520
uh... well you can actually download the dvdi so from

59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.600
i don't even remember the site now

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:07.600
If you search for Silent Hill No Escape, you should be able to find it.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.600
It was pretty decently done.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.600
I mean, it was very neat.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.600
But if you don't want to bother with download, it's just on YouTube.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.600
It's broken up into, like, seven parts.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.600
Yeah.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.600
And watch the dog ending.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.600
All right.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.600
If you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangeontraded.com.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.600
Do it!

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.600
Bucky!

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.600
Bongo demands it.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.600
Nintendo!

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.600
Big conference this week.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.720
People are eagerly anticipating what they're going to say.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:41.280
Exactly, and if you can't make the conference, I guess, you can actually, well you can watch

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.440
it at the official World Store.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:50.240
They're actually going to be streaming it starting at 1230 Eastern to visitors who come

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.240
in.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.840
Space is limited of course, so first come first serve.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.640
Also, of course, you can view it streaming on practically every other gaming site out

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:06.640
there, including if you're in the area, you can watch at the E3 Outpost. So check it out.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.660
Alright. Yeah, because I believe Scott over at All Games is doing something with GameTrailers.com

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:15.880
with the Nintendo Press Conference. Yeah, they're streaming a GameTrailers stuff. Which

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.320
is interesting because that means that like, you know, tons of people are streaming this

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:25.240
Nintendo Conference, so it's gonna, you know, it goes to show how immediate, you know, people

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.480
want their news now with this Wii stuff, so this is interesting.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.760
I will be watching.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.880
If they have it on a big screen at Outpost, which I'm told they're going to, I will be

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:40.120
there with my butt parked in the front row couch ready to see this conference, so I'm

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.120
very excited.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.800
Since we're not good enough to get one of the magic tickets.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.920
I've got nothing else to do.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:50.360
I want to grab McD's, grab some really fatty, something with bacon and eggs, and sit down

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.760
and watch HDTV in a press conference.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:59.080
Now I want to spend my week. So come down to e3 outpost and be lazy and fat with us. It'll be fun

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:04.860
Make sure that you have a craving for that McDonald's burger. You know, what Oh bacon

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.960
You're really making me grossed out now. All right

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:12.700
Speaking of lazy and fat. We have a special guest joining us. Say a little meekly top. No, I'm kidding

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:19.200
I'm kidding. You're a jerk. He's he's neither lazy nor fat hair is gone. Yeah, it looks like a monkey

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.200
You do look like a monkey.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200
Thank you.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.200
Miklotov got all his hair cut off today.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.200
Can we call you Son Goku now?

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.200
What? No, that sounds stupid.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.200
Because that was the Monkey King.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.200
I don't want to be a king of monkeys.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.200
You don't look that much like a monkey.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.200
I like your hair short though.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.200
So a monkey doesn't want to be a duck and you don't want to be a monkey.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.200
I didn't like your hair long because it made you look like a wet dog.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.200
Yes it did.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.200
I thought that it was cute long.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.200
I'm not a fan of long hair.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.200
It was floppy in a cute way.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.200
What's that word?

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.200
Manageable.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.200
Yeah, that thing. I can't say it.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.200
I can't say it.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.200
That's what detanglers are for.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.120
Real quickly before we get back on the news, because we're running really long this segment,

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.400
we didn't start the show until very late tonight, how's your gaming week going?

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:04.720
It's going fine.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.080
Any games of note that you've been playing that you want to share?

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:17.400
I've been playing Final Fantasy XI a lot, and then I've been getting ready for E3.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:22.440
Now for those that may not know, we've been on the show for a while now, and we get new

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.440
listeners every week.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.440
What's my shirt say?

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.640
Yes, he's wearing his Konami shirt today.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:30.840
So Miklotov actually works for Konami, but due to NDA's, he can't share with us a whole

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.040
lot of information, but E3?

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.680
Yeah, there sure is E3.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.680
We gonna have a good time at Konami's booth?

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.560
Maybe, depends on what you like.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.960
Yeah, he ain't budging.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960
He ain't budging.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:48.960
I'm going to have a good time at Nintendo's booth.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.960
Why? Why Nintendo? Because I want to play the Wii. So you're not working at Konami's booth?

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.960
Nope, but I'm going to have all the official Konami attire so I'll look like I'm working.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.960
So if you ask me a question, I'm just going to lie and make something up.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.960
Do your boss listen to this show? I don't care. We are having Metal Gear Solid 6

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.960
for the iMac.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.960
We already told you it's going to be at Konami's booth anyway.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.160
No, remember we had that story a few weeks ago?

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.960
Yeah, but who says it's true?

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.300
The latest issue Nintendo Power confirmed the...

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.300
I got mine.

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.760
I don't remember even subscribing or ordering it, but they sent me one.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.240
Nintendo Power confirmed the Port of the Ruin theme, but, Loki, you can throw this in now.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.240
The Silent Hill thing may have actually been incorrect.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.440
I got the name wrong, or they changed the name on me.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.680
Konami trying to keep me on my toes.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.520
Actually, joystick, they're there now in LA, so what do they do?

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.440
they go and go snap pictures of stuff that's going on and Konami's putting up their booth

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:49.280
and they have Silent Hill Origins with the O in Origins being a zero.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.000
Wasn't that the first game with Alessa and all them?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.400
I don't know, but Silent Hill Origins, definitely going to be there in some form.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.440
Oh, I know what it was.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.160
So not Original Sin.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:04.240
Not Original Sin, but they probably just, I mean if you think about Original Sin sounds

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:08.120
stupid so Origins kind of rolls off the tongue better I guess.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.480
I think Original Sin was a better name.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.420
I can't wait for all the mail that says we were lying

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:15.400
except we did get the portrait of ruin thing

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.860
absolutely nailed that

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:23.440
original sin and origins oh those are so different

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.820
fucking morons final still come out at the same time though

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.440
either way it's on the psp

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.200
I know what the big news is

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.820
silent hill for the game com

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.120
what's a game com

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:41.880
A really piece of shit LCD system that I actually happen to have one of those too.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:47.000
We got to move on or we're going to be here through E3 because we'll be taping so long.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.240
There is a brand new PlayStation 3 controller that's going to be unveiled next week.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.540
So those of you guys that love the Boomerang PlayStation 3 controller, tear.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:57.400
I wanted to do like Batman cosplay with that.

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.400
Not going to happen.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.480
Well, it says the rumors abound that it's going to be unveiled at Sony's press conference

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:07.320
which is Monday night if I remember or Monday afternoon yeah what's gonna

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:12.400
happen for while we're on the road so well we'll probably just get into town

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.800
right about time they're gonna have those available for download though so

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:21.520
watch it later yeah so no idea what it's gonna look like but they're saying that

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:27.120
probably gonna go back to a more dual shock style look I disagree I think they

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.840
are gonna change something radically about it but I think it look like a

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:34.180
giant schlong yeah I think that boomerang thing was a little weird so

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:40.200
it's it's not gonna look like you know Batman accessories all right it'll look

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:46.680
like you know like a throwing star all right we're gonna go ahead and move on

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:50.800
to the next story which is dark Sakura's gonna tell us a little bit about what

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:57.560
Sega is doing at e3 Sega is being awesome at e3 I love Sega Sega has

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.920
on ps2 Sega's a booth I'm definitely spending more time at this year than I

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.100
did last year they've got a

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:40.120
pretty solid lineup it sounds like I hope they have the chairs oh

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:43.760
outside their theater or whatever no no no the chairs that were in the theater

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:49.040
comfy they had these big theater seats with like cup holders and crap

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.840
and they were like as big as the chair that's in the studio.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.700
There's this theme with you at E3 and that is me and you always seem to pass

01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:00.280
out in very strange areas at E3. Because I remember there's a picture of us

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:04.640
and I think we were sitting in the corner of some random booth in

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.880
Kensho Hall.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.920
I didn't go to Sega's room.

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:12.560
It was one of the separate rooms. It was freaking

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:16.280
a claims room. Yeah, we passed out there too. And drinking coke,

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.800
the free code that was there and I found

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:24.320
all about food and nap and I met other people we decided to take it to camp out

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.560
on the little staircase

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.960
outside of a Squeenix's little thing

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.480
we were just sitting back there talking and apparently I crap who was I forgot

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.440
it was another

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.600
a radio personages are

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:41.400
are had a home page who knew somebody I knew so we were talking about them

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.640
it was pretty hilarious though it was like I took ended up also taking a nap

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:51.640
Um, some are way back in, uh, behind the, uh, SOCOM 3 area.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.160
How you nap at E3 is beyond me.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.160
Alright, we gotta keep going.

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.160
This is tiring.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.160
Low-key.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.160
I'm a busy girl.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:02.320
Uh, this is, this is gonna get a little bit outside the realm of gaming, I believe, but

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:06.680
there was big DVD news this week, and therefore there's gonna be a corresponding game that's

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.680
going on with it.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.880
Well, we knew that Lego Star Wars 2 was coming out, and Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy,

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.080
trilogy, and of course now with the sense of re-releasing the original trilogy DVDs

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.360
on September 12th, the game is going to come out at the same time. Very similar to what

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:25.200
they did with Star Wars Battlefront II when it came out with episode 3. So, not too surprising

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:30.560
there, but what is surprising is that it is going to be on the Xbox 360 as well, to get

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:37.000
some high-res, high-definition Legos. Cool, and achievements. I can get high-definition

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.360
Legos right now though. I can go play with Legos. I can go to Toys R Us and buy me some

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:46.660
Legos. I love Legos. They're awesome. Actually, the Lego Star Wars games are games I keep

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:50.160
meaning to check out that I never do, so maybe I'll get it this time. I have a business proposal

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:56.160
for us all right now. Oh, dear. In a few months we should do a podcast from Legoland. No.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:02.100
Legoland sucks, dude. We don't got the travel budget. Legoland is a lame ass theme park.

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.100
You find us some advertisers, we'll be fine.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:11.020
Hey, pay for us to go to Legoland and we'll say that your product doesn't suck.

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:14.620
We go Knott's Berry Farm too, we'll just have a crappy theme park.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.620
Let's just go to Disneyland.

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:20.340
Loki's got a barrage of television and movie game news.

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.940
Yeah, goodie.

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:27.360
It's not surprising, everyone's jumping on the bandwagon here.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:32.080
First one we've got coming out, THQ announced The Sopranos is heading to PlayStation 2 and

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:37.720
Xbox 360 and scheduled to be released this holiday season and of course you get to play

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.280
all these Sopranos cast and yeah it's basically Godfather all over again.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.280
So look for that, should be fun.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:53.080
Then of course we've got, let's see here Reservoir Dogs was going to be coming out and this one

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:59.440
actually is being released by some really tiny company and as far as I've read none

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:07.040
One of the cast, I don't know, Quentin Tarantino's not pretending that this isn't actually going

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:15.240
on, that the game's not being made, and just, I don't know.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.280
It's interesting, they're going to try to go through some of the movie's plot and show

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:24.200
you things that you might not have seen in the actual movie, and yeah.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.200
So it'll be good.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:29.660
And, of course, the one I'm kind of excited about, Scarface, is going to be coming out

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:37.780
this September, and actually this one looks really sweet. They've got a huge voice cast,

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:42.180
everybody except for Al Pacino. Al Pacino, he actually picked out his voice actor for

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:47.600
this, so you've got tons of talent in here, tons of people that are going to be in it,

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.200
and just looks really awesome, and of course, going to be very similar to Vice City, which...

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.000
Will that be coming out on the Wii?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:54.680
I don't think so.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.360
Say hello to my little Wii.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.400
Well, they're not going to say that.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.120
So that'll be cool.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.160
All right.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:08.160
That's it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.720
We're going to take ourselves a quick little break here,

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.460
and we'll be back with more just before E3.

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:14.880
Before we go to break, I just want

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.340
to remind you guys real quick, this

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:18.440
is what our E3 schedule is going to be like.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.100
If you guys are on the podcast stream,

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.120
you're going to get a new podcast every day

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:28.360

Thursday, Friday sometime in the evening you're going to get our live shows that

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.520
we're doing at the E3 Outpost. If you want to hear us tape these shows live

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.800
we're actually going to be doing them at allgames.com. It's not going to be on

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:46.320
our own stream just due to technical restrictions but it will be on

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:53.440
allgames.com's feed 630 ish is the time that all depends on LA how basically how
