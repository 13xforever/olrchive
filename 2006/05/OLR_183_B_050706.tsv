487	19082	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19815	34460	And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 183 for this May the 7th of 2006 for part B. Going to our podcast feed a little bit early this week to make way for the podcast we're going to be doing from the E3 Outpost Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
34500	35620	Very excited about that.
35920	47784	For more information, check out part A or check out our website, orangeloungeradio.com or E3onpsp.com, our brand new PSP site to bring the E3 experience to your PlayStation Portable.
49039	56132	However, if you're a DS fan, you've got some really good news coming your way, and that would be the new DS that's coming out, right, DarkSakura?
57154	59418	I like the DS Lite, and I want one.
59899	60440	I want one, too.
60460	61282	It looks very sexy.
62369	64850	But yeah, we've got a release date for the U.S.
64910	65390	on this one.
65830	69531	It's going to be released on June 11th for the price of $129.99.
72652	74432	Only the white one is going to be out in the U.S.
74492	78193	to begin with, although they've got three other colors in Japan, too.
80734	84815	They're also going to be releasing on May 15th the new Super Mario Bros.
87175	89576	So I'm going to wait and see.
90276	90596	You know,
91684	95448	Yeah, it's the DS Lite, but I want to wait for more colors.
96249	97910	I like having a selection.
98270	99692	Yeah, you know there's going to be more colors.
99832	101954	Honestly, there's nothing wrong with the DS I have now.
102354	103195	Mine works just fine.
103395	105557	You say that until you actually see one in action.
105577	106779	You're like, holy crap.
107299	109842	Do you think at Nintendo's booth they'll have everything on the DS Lite?
110401	110941	Probably.
111161	112121	Ooh, that might be interesting.
112381	115102	That'll be an interesting little, like, all their demo DSs or DS lights.
115182	121343	One of our, uh, one of my, uh, coworkers imported one, and I swear it's the best thing I've ever seen.
121663	128364	That all depends, though, because all their demos are gonna be on dev kits anyways, so... I guess that's true.
130004	130344	We'll see.
130544	131085	I don't think so.
132365	139206	But it doesn't matter anyways, remember, because you can do the firmware hack to, um, get the DS light brightness on the, uh, normal DS.
139646	139846	Mm-hmm.
140287	141688	SIGA announced Full Auto 2, exclusive for PS3
162537	164558	Kind of sucks for me, but, you know, whatever.
164578	165658	I'm getting all systems anyways.
166298	169920	This time around, they're finally going to put some sort of deathmatch mode in there.
169980	171580	It's going to be kind of arena-themed.
172180	173721	I think, I guess, twisted metal.
175862	176862	And it looks pretty sweet.
177102	179183	I've seen there's actually pictures online now.
179723	185505	They've got three pictures on Xbox Oxide or whatever, that site.
185865	190987	And it's sweet looking, so I can't wait to check that one out.
191772	199257	You know what's interesting is a lot of the news sites where I saw that news on kind of took the opportunity to bash Full Auto 1 as being a bad game, but I kind of enjoyed it.
199297	199738	It was fun.
199758	201459	I mean, it's not the best thing ever.
201479	202740	It had flaws, but you know what?
203160	204061	The second one will be better.
205562	207243	Well, isn't that usually the case with games?
207663	208224	Usually.
208544	208804	Usually.
211294	238762	All right, Xbox Live is, of course, they had a big patch this week, and assuming that they're gearing up for their big E3 showing, they're going to have an awful lot of stuff coming up for E3, including demos and trailers for Test Drive Unlimited, MotoGP 06, Crackdown, Dead or Alive Extreme 2, The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle Earth 2, Lost Planet, Sonic the Hedgehog, Splinter Cell Double Agent, and Viva Pi√±ata.
239302	244064	Also, they're saying a flood of HD trailers from games that have yet to be announced.
244564	245924	Maybe Halo 3?
246925	249966	And also, they're going to have HD trailers for movies as well.
250506	251786	Not too much of a surprise there.
252126	260229	I kind of wish the Xbox 360 front end was built a little more to handle a lot of stuff, because scrolling through a big list is going to be annoying, I think.
260509	261409	But that's just me.
262130	266251	Unless they do a page that's going to be all E3 stuff, but even still...
266767	270951	Now remember, that doesn't necessarily mean they're all playable demos, just some of them.
271311	272552	Demos, trailers, we don't know which.
272572	273653	Lost Planet is going to be a demo.
273794	274254	That's cool.
275515	278278	And they're going to have, what was the other thing that they were going to have?
279719	281701	I think the Top Spin 2 demo just came out.
282982	288247	And World Cup Soccer was another one they were talking about releasing a demo for.
289696	295978	I think it's going to be very interesting to see what sort of effect the Xbox Live integration of E3 is going to have.
296158	297399	Uno is coming out.
297639	298219	Oh, I heard about that.
298299	301120	Uno is coming out next week as part of a celebration for E3.
301380	303181	But yet no Street Fighter 2.
304061	306462	Still not out.
307843	310324	Massive problems with that game, I hear.
310824	311324	Interesting.
314125	314765	We'll fix them.
314905	315626	Get that game out.
315946	316666	Stop teasing us.
317867	319548	Loki, something new coming out for the DS?
319928	324531	Yes, Disney actually has a new exclusive title for the DS called Spectrobes.
325532	338480	And, you know, it's supposed to be infused with edgy, highly stylized look and feel of a Japanese anime or manga series with unique original characters, right?
339101	341802	And compelling storyline, breakthrough gameplay.
342203	343864	Right.
344064	345985	It says the game allows players to...
347668	352450	Excavate, and Train Battle with nearly 500 unique characters.
353451	356032	So it sounds kind of like a Pokemon game.
356052	358113	They actually have a game coming out right now.
358694	364977	It's called some stupid-ass game where you dig up dinosaur bones.
366357	371980	Basically, if Jurassic Park were to have sex with Pokemon, this is the game you would get.
372260	373761	It's just weird.
373781	374522	Okay.
374702	375062	Okay.
376115	376656	I forgot.
377136	380780	I brought out the emulators this week and I played Jurassic Park on the Super Nintendo.
382301	385004	Because I wanted to show somebody the scary first person mode.
385865	387187	Which is really bad, but anyway.
387927	388668	That game was fun.
389649	389989	I don't know.
390610	394534	So yeah, it's going to be coming out and probably at Buena Vista's booth this year.
395215	395415	All right.
396882	403524	DarkSakura likes to travel the world from her computer because she loves you UK listeners as well as everybody.
403944	404764	It doesn't matter where you're at.
404784	405284	She loves you all.
406064	408405	But UK has a release calendar of their own.
408985	414426	The UK has a release date calendar of their own and DarkSakura would like to share some upcoming UK release dates.
414726	417146	Yes, we have special things coming out.
418307	424068	On the 12th we have City Life for PC, Dreamfall The Longest Journey, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary for PC.
425448	433912	Pac-Man World 3, Sin Episodes Emergence, Time Shift, Brain Age, coming out on the DS on the 19th.
435232	437713	A couple more things on the 19th, Fire Department 3.
438634	440935	I thought that game was massively delayed.
441355	444496	Time Shift is apparently slated for PC and Xbox 360 on the 12th.
445556	448117	And Pac-Man World 3 on PSP on the 19th.
448177	451939	It was originally supposed to be on the 12th, but the problem was it got
452383	454024	I would actually like to hear from our UK listeners.
454044	456105	Let me know how the Rainbow Islands Revolution turned out.
456125	456905	It was released on the 5th.
456925	459467	So if anyone picked it up, let me know what you think about it.
459487	460467	I'd love to hear your review.
460487	461588	I'm curious about it too.
483749	484009	Is that it?
484049	484309	That's it.
484409	484749	Oh, okay.
484989	485450	Not a lot.
485470	488271	Remember, I don't think a whole bunch is going to come out during E3.
488391	489531	No, obviously not.
489571	493192	But I thought, Loki, humorous anyway, is there anything coming out for the US?
493973	496574	There's jack shit coming out for the US.
497214	502095	No, the only real game that's coming out is Over the Hedge, and that's coming out on most systems.
502836	510318	You do have the, was it the Guitar Hero SG controller coming out, which is, I guess, kind of interesting.
511079	511139	On...
513880	516042	Tringo on the Game Boy Advance
544278	545980	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
568868	569309	Xbox 360, PS3, Xbox 360
584082	591565	Screenshots will be impossible to tell the 360 from the PS3 apart.
591585	597187	I remember how they used to do that in GamePro where they'd have screenshots of Super Nintendo and Genesis versions.
597687	599548	So we'll hopefully start seeing that again.
599908	604049	I think that we're going to see differences.
606130	608051	I think the PS3 is going to end up being better.
609000	611343	Oh, well that's... We'll see this week.
611543	612024	Hopefully.
612164	612544	Hopefully.
612624	615387	It's all how you... I've seen a lot of stuff.
615407	617570	I mean, look at God of War on the PlayStation 2.
618110	624237	You can really push out a lot of graphics and quality in some of these systems.
624277	626179	You just have to know how to program for them.
626379	628281	I don't think we've seen the best of Xbox 360 yet either.
628521	630143	Not by a long shot.
630423	630764	We'll see.
632254	635116	You may not have seen the best of the PSP or the DS yet as well.
635196	649945	There are rumors abounding that Vonage, that broadband phone company, Vonage is apparently making software that is going to allow PSP and DS users to turn those handheld systems into VOIP phones.
650625	657309	Now, if you think about it, that means your handheld would basically be a phone that you could use anywhere that there's Wi-Fi, like an N-Gage.
657529	661010	First we had the taco, and now we have the quesadilla.
661690	662931	What is the DS, a clam?
662951	664971	I was saying quesadilla.
665111	667092	I was sticking with the Mexican food reference.
667112	667592	It's a clam.
667912	668832	I still think it's a taco.
668852	670433	I mean, you kind of like put it back together.
670453	671973	It doesn't matter anyways.
672193	673533	The N-Gage isn't finished.
673894	675414	Oh, the N-Gage will rule the world.
677044	678946	Yeah, and I'll be buying a Gizmondo tomorrow.
678966	685412	I think Engage should be the first booth that we do a video presentation from for the E3 on PSP site.
685432	686774	We should totally do like in Wayne's World.
687154	689516	Hi, we're at the Engage booth.
689596	690197	No, you know what?
690397	692239	We're making Bobby cover Engage.
692999	694261	I'll cover the Engage booth.
694281	697944	I want to find out what is so wonderful about this.
698785	698905	And
701139	703340	It's basically, we're just going to ask them the questions.
703760	705541	Why should I buy an N-Gage?
706101	707462	Because cell phone games rock?
707602	709522	No, I'm sorry, that's not the correct answer.
709602	710803	Why should I buy an N-Gage?
710823	711683	Because you like tacos.
712463	714344	Oh my god, Yuri Lover is so corny.
714704	716445	Now, why should we buy... Oh, sorry.
716625	717825	V over IPSP.
721727	722567	Gotta let that run.
723888	752286	doesn't matter anyways they're going to be doing that that was one of the attachments that they're going to be adding to the PSP so that's not really a surprise no but you know Vonage probably wants a piece of that because they're still I don't know if they're struggling but they're still trying to really get out there and be a major player so this could be huge for them we'll see you know what they need to do they need to be pushing you know Wi-Fi all over the United States and because you know I can tell you right now walking around I can't find that many hot spots Santa Clara though
752568	753948	They've got free Wi-Fi everywhere.
753988	754729	That's awesome.
755109	755609	That's pretty cool.
755629	756849	It's covered the entire city.
757590	760611	Rumor is that's supposed to happen in one of our suburbs, Roseville.
760651	760971	We'll see.
762191	762471	We'll see.
764452	764732	All right.
765432	766532	Let's go to another story.
766793	767493	Loki.
767953	770174	Another interesting game to be shown at E3.
770334	771134	Cooking Mama.
772034	775195	It's actually going to be part of Majesco's lineup at E3.
775675	777076	And this game is basically...
778188	778468	Bacons
803786	805507	Look forward to eating tomorrow.
832026	834367	Moving on, since somebody brought up the end gauge earlier.
834387	835688	I was going to mention, though, real quick.
835788	835988	What?
836008	836368	Real quick.
836969	838369	Do you notice it is Cooking Mama?
838689	840330	Because, you know, women in the kitchen.
840350	841071	In the kitchen.
842231	842831	You know what?
844652	847094	Explain, you know, freaking Emeril, okay?
848314	849555	Women in disguise.
851363	851703	He's crazy.
851723	852905	What about the Galloping Gourmet?
853205	854406	Woman in disguise.
854466	854947	Iron Chef.
855507	856468	Women in disguise.
856488	857009	No, no, no, no.
857029	859171	They have a woman on Iron Chef, but she's more of a man.
859191	862654	She's proud to show that she's a woman in cooking.
862714	864356	We're going to get hate mail.
864796	869401	Okay, I like... This is me as estrogen ambassador, okay?
870542	871463	I like to cook.
872243	874185	However, I don't.
874566	875847	I make my husband make me dinner.
877113	878153	Woman in Disguise.
878354	879454	No, no, no, no, no.
880014	882275	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
883516	884216	He knows his place.
885056	885696	Alright, anyway.
887277	887877	Moving on.
888358	889538	We were talking about the end gauge.
890018	891179	I thought this was hilarious.
891219	892979	Joystick ran an article this week.
893620	896541	It says, mobile market shows signs of stagnation.
896561	897741	And what was my reaction?
898842	899322	A duh!
901701	902241	You know why?
902602	903983	Here, I don't even have to read the article.
904183	906244	Because mobile games are not that great.
906384	906904	I'm sorry.
907625	909626	They're just not that fun.
910087	911347	They're really not that fun.
911408	914790	And I feel bad because I know people that develop for mobile games and stuff.
914810	917311	And I know they're trying very hard at what they do and everything.
917692	922555	But I guess they just are catered for a certain market that's not me.
923055	925877	Because as a hardcore gamer, I really don't like mobile phone games.
925897	931381	Mobile gaming is about as cool as talking on one of those cell phones from the 80s today.
933544	936645	Well, anyway, here's the actual chunk of the story here.
936705	943087	A research firm, M-Metrics, published data in March 2006 from a mobile gamer's perspective.
943568	953831	They're saying that the number of mobile gamers is remaining constant month on month, with only a tiny fraction of mobile users, 0.5%, downloading their first game in March.
954291	957913	The percentage of phone users who use their handset for downloadable games is low.
957973	958593	The U.S., 2.7%.
962068	975119	Now, given the millions and millions of mobile phones in the market, that's still a lot of people, and many of them are repeat customers, but there's really not a lot of reasons to buy new titles, and they're not exactly cheap, and it kind of puts people off.
975979	980843	Well, it's just like spending $5 on a game that actually a Flash game would be better than.
980963	981584	I mean, it's just
982492	984473	Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3
1011209	1016091	People started to think that it might actually be at E3 because there was an advertisement on IGN, of course.
1016871	1021413	Someone accidentally let that slip through there in their editing department.
1021713	1023054	High hopes.
1024154	1025114	Not at E3, huh?
1025434	1026095	That makes me sad.
1026895	1029856	That makes me very angry, and you know what happens when people get angry.
1030376	1031277	They turn into the Hulk?
1032557	1034638	No, it's time for the FUs of the Week.
1035629	1038014	That's where DarkSakura turns into the She-Hulk.
1038696	1042163	No, no, no, I am not a green-skinned, tall attorney.
1042784	1043325	Thank you.
1055669	1060352	My FU of the day goes towards this stupid kid in a Mustang.
1061173	1062514	Now I love the Mustang.
1062554	1063875	I love old Mustangs especially.
1063975	1064875	I like the very new ones.
1065396	1067237	This guy's was like a dirty convertible one.
1067317	1068137	He was like probably 16.
1069298	1069819	Really stupid.
1069879	1073081	Had like some blonde stupid looking girl with him.
1074045	1076627	And I will tell you where it is.
1077007	1078548	Anyone in this area will know.
1079268	1082090	It was as I was going from downtown.
1082690	1087934	I had just passed where the Elkhorn entrance onto the freeway goes right before Antelope.
1088694	1090775	You have that long ass merging lane.
1091136	1092777	I mean, this is a really long merging lane.
1093377	1095398	So I was well ahead of the guy.
1095899	1098200	And then he starts speeding up, trying to nose in front of me.
1098240	1099521	And I'm already going 80, okay?
1099841	1101742	I mean, 65 miles an hour.
1105564	1129624	and so finally he still keeps going and I'm blowing on my horn and finally I had to just drop back and honk at him so um he uh cut over to the other lane and I you know freaking told him off and then cut him off so uh that was my episode of the week to stupid children who don't know how to drive Loki um fuck you to the stupid DJ who like
1130319	1131260	Stay Away From Hot Tracks
1160720	1161220	Horrible.
1161601	1165463	By the way, he has some weird relationship with his sister whose name is Ting.
1166264	1166864	Cuckoo!
1166984	1167665	Crazy!
1168985	1170166	Send those cards and letters to Loki.
1170186	1173228	The views and opinions expressed by Loki do not necessarily reflect those of the staff.
1173949	1174789	Oh, come on, you agree.
1174849	1175730	He was a retard.
1177291	1179752	I did not enjoy myself as much as I could have.
1180052	1180653	Let's put it that way.
1181493	1184475	Dan kept cracking jokes about it.
1184515	1187917	He offered money to anyone who would go over and grab his inflatable guitar and beat him over the head with it.
1189218	1190179	But your wedding was still great.
1190816	1192856	We were talking about how we really enjoyed the ceremony.
1192876	1193456	It was very nice.
1219144	1219464	Thank you.
1220244	1227947	We thought it was especially cool that you had the tradition pulled in that the family wanted, but were able to do everything themselves.
1228808	1229888	It was very impressive.
1229988	1231329	I just like seeing Dan in a yarmulke.
1231349	1233169	Yeah, that was hilarious.
1233770	1237111	Let's see, my FU of the week goes to Flight Delays.
1239132	1239692	Mikotov.
1240612	1240912	Yes.
1241272	1242093	Any FUs of the week?
1242553	1245374	FU to the whole state of Hawaii.
1245734	1246394	Hate you all.
1247095	1247815	Hope you burn.
1248482	1252636	Maybe Japan will get lucky one of these days and actually hit you correctly with a bomb.
1252978	1253399	Wow!
1254673	1255214	Thank you for watching!
1280404	1285106	DarkSakura, please take us away with an actual relating to the news type story.
1285186	1285886	That would be wonderful.
1287667	1288468	We do news here?
1289288	1291049	Once in a while we are known to do that.
1291809	1292629	What do we do that for?
1295971	1297371	Can we drop the Wii controllers on her now?
1299152	1302294	Okay, well I do have a little bit of news.
1302314	1309957	Basically, Konami is doing the big pitch for the DDR for school.
1310836	1314644	So, like, because they were so successful in West Virginia or wherever?
1314664	1315366	West Virginia.
1315526	1317651	So what, they're trying to sell all the other states now on this?
1317671	1320416	They want to make DDR part of public school curriculum.
1322557	1323538	Don't look at me like that.
1324538	1326359	I got an F in DDR.
1327480	1328321	Wait, wait, wait.
1329021	1334545	Keep in mind, this has been done at other schools with a very high success rate.
1335365	1341109	A lot of people have actually gotten in better shape and lost weight through playing DDR.
1341449	1342590	I, at first...
1343450	1347712	You know, because I moved out here, got happy, you know, and got really fat.
1348493	1351195	And then started playing DDR and dropped 20 pounds over a summer.
1351495	1353696	So, I can vouch for personal experience.
1354576	1357538	You know, but I think it's a really good thing.
1357658	1359379	Although, I do like the little comment from here.
1359819	1365763	Talking about looking for all the YouTube and Google videos about their classmates playing DDR.
1366083	1366603	Oh, God.
1366683	1367044	Wow.
1368064	1368645	Comedy.
1368785	1370446	I still can't wait for somebody to come home.
1370666	1372026	I got an F in DDR.
1373530	1377031	Yeah, you don't hear them pitching in the groove to schools.
1377351	1377611	Yeah.
1377631	1379812	Don't you mean they got an E in DDR?
1380712	1382012	With a boo.
1382032	1382472	Failed.
1383432	1385473	You should practice in a closet.
1387093	1389774	I think my PE teacher should be the nurse from Solo 2000.
1390174	1392095	She's so amazing.
1392135	1393275	I can't stand it.
1396056	1396956	I want to marry her.
1397196	1397496	All right.
1398316	1401197	So check that out in a classroom near you if Konami gets their way.
1401553	1402513	I'm glad I'm in college.
1427500	1434863	It's going to be chopped down to episodes each containing about 30-40 minutes of gameplay that ends with a cliffhanger and preview of things to come.
1436924	1437204	Wow.
1437965	1441166	Yeah, I've never been so... eh, in my life.
1441746	1443207	Sounds like Shenmue, except...
1443792	1444653	Somehow worse.
1445053	1446374	I think it sounds interesting.
1446414	1447354	I like the idea of an episode.
1447374	1451377	It sounds okay, but how expensive is this going to be?
1451777	1453979	You said 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay?
1453999	1455239	30 to 40 minutes of gameplay.
1455420	1456020	Each episode.
1456040	1459942	Each episode would probably be about $5 on Xbox Live or something like that.
1459983	1462904	Think about people who buy DVD shows.
1463305	1464225	That's the same type of thing.
1464245	1466967	You watch a couple episodes, you take a break, come back.
1466987	1468408	People watch 24 on DVD.
1468708	1470549	That's what save points were invented for.
1472511	1473011	I don't get it.
1473993	1475734	and neither does Eden Games apparently.
1475754	1477855	I think it's an interesting idea.
1477935	1479056	If done right, it might be neat.
1479216	1482318	If it's under $10 an episode thing, then that's okay.
1482578	1483418	Well, if the game's good.
1483458	1484819	I mean, it depends on how good the game is.
1485059	1487361	I don't want to pay $10 for 30 minutes of gameplay.
1487381	1488141	This shit better be like $2.
1490062	1490542	Even less.
1491783	1494865	Like iTunes charges $1.99 for a 40 minute TV show.
1496466	1498087	I like $1.99 should be the price.
1499187	1499668	We'll see though.
1500228	1502209	How about the game not suck first and let's just
1503197	1509281	All right, we're going to run down some lineups that are going to be at E3, some things that were announced this week.
1509381	1510402	Loki, THQ.
1510762	1512864	Yes, THQ, we mentioned them a little bit earlier.
1513264	1519008	They're going to be having Saints Row, which is going to be pretty sweet, and I hear there may be a demo coming to Xbox Live.
1519989	1522531	Frontline's Fuel Awards is coming out of the 360 podcast.
1523473	1544452	PS3 and for PC Smackdown vs. Raw 07 and I know that's going to be there because actually I think some of the wrestlers are going to be there as well promoting it PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360 and PSP notice no Xbox The Sopranos of course we mentioned that on the 360 and PlayStation 2 also no Xbox and
1545160	1570716	MotoGP 2006 which I think is actually getting a demo during E3 week on the 360 and Supreme Commander for the PC, Company of Heroes on the PC, Titan Quest on the PC, Warhammer 40,000, Dawn of War, Dark Crusade on the PC, Disney's Pixar's Cars which is on almost every single format out there,
1571658	1577282	including the 360 and the Wii, which is coming out later on the year, probably around November, and PC and Mac.
1578322	1583225	Destroy All Humans 2, which looks sweet, and that's actually going to be on current-gen PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
1584186	1593411	SpongeBob SquarePants Creature from the Krusty Krab, which is going to be on PlayStation 2, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PC, DS, and the Wii.
1594612	1600156	Monster House, which is based on an upcoming DreamWorks movie, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and DS.
1601087	1617505	Bratz, Forever Diamonds, we don't even give a crap which systems that's on, Barnyard, also another animated movie, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PC, Juice Eliminator for the PSP, and Alex Rider, Stormbreaker on the DS and Game Boy Advance.
1618849	1621870	All right, Ubisoft's got an interesting E3 lineup this year.
1621950	1624871	Splinter Cell Double Agent will be on just about every system that's out there.
1624931	1626472	Red Steel, of course, on the Wii.
1627192	1630553	Rayman Raving Rabbids will also be on the Wii.
1630833	1631473	Should be interesting.
1631954	1636055	Rainbow Six Vegas for the PS2, PS3, and both Xboxes.
1636595	1639096	Open Season on just about every system.
1639216	1641277	Enchanted Arms, just for the Xbox 360.
1641697	1644518	Dark Messiah of Might and Magic for you PC gamers.
1644958	1652742	Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway on the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360, and Assassin's Creed on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1652922	1661566	Also, Ubisoft is supposed to do some type of next-gen and PC game from the folks who did TimeSplitters, but not a lot of more details just yet.
1661586	1662466	Oh, but TimeSplitters 4.
1664047	1664447	We'll see.
1664467	1665928	TimeSplitters is fucking awesome.
1666108	1666508	We'll see.
1667208	1670650	Army of Two, Battlefield 2142, Command & Conquer 3, Tiberian Wars, Crisis, Far Cry
1685567	1703162	Def Jam, Fight for New York, The Takeover on the PSP, Lord of the Rings, Battle for Middle Earth 2 on the 360, Madden NFL 2007 on the DS, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PSP, the Wii, the Xbox, and the Xbox 360.
1703222	1706765	I think that about covers everything except for PC on there.
1707566	1712570	NASCAR 2007 on the PSP, Orcs and Elves on mobile games,
1713449	1742841	Spore for the PC and I think that's actually on the portable systems too but I'm not sure if they're going to show them Superman Returns which got delayed to September that coincided with the DVD release that's going to be on almost every single system only next gen system though is going to be the 360 and no GameCube for that and other sports titles are going to be patched over to the mobile games as well I know the Wii Madden is supposed to be pretty neat they're going to have kicking drills and passing drills and stuff like that so
1743462	1744402	Should be pretty cool.
1747863	1748164	All right.
1749324	1751225	I thought we could have a little bit of a roundtable here.
1751425	1756546	Top three things we are looking forward to at E3 besides the Wii and the PlayStation 3.
1756786	1757927	Those are the easy answers.
1758767	1759787	Anybody want to go first?
1760487	1761048	Anybody?
1761128	1761888	All right, Miklatov.
1762628	1765049	Luminous 2 for the PSP.
1765789	1766389	Is that your number one?
1766890	1767190	No.
1767630	1768130	Okay, your number three?
1768150	1768930	Yeah, that's my number three.
1768950	1769830	Let's give this three to one.
1770251	1771231	Yeah, well, can't we...
1771946	1774127	Can I have time to think about my two-in-one?
1774567	1775007	Loki.
1776347	1799854	I'm actually kind of excited about seeing, well, I was hoping to see Take-Two's lineup this year, because I would have been looking forward to seeing Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories, but assuming I probably won't see that, I guess the next best thing would probably be seeing a Wii version of WarioWare, because that looks like fun.
1800393	1802574	DarkSakura Taking a nap under Squeenix's movie theater
1815237	1819821	My number three would be the DDRs.
1820782	1823445	There's so many of them that I'm very curious to see what's going to happen there.
1823905	1825087	Assuming we're right, but we are.
1826828	1831994	My number two would be Luminous for PS2.
1835557	1835938	Loki.
1836518	1837840	Weird Drinks for 7 for the PS3.
1839244	1839724	DarkSakura, Konami,
1865401	1867142	because their list was not that.
1867242	1868463	Chrono Trigger 3!
1868503	1874188	7 Remake, Crisis Core, and... You think the 7 Remakes?
1874208	1880553	7 Remake, Crisis Core, the... Oh, what the fuck is that stupid one that's on cell phones right now?
1881374	1882014	Before Crisis.
1882515	1883496	Oh, Before Crisis.
1883696	1885097	It's going to be ported to the PSP.
1886518	1887499	You think Indurgis Service?
1887519	1889500	Indurgis Service is coming out next month.
1889961	1891682	Or, not next month, two months from now.
1892082	1893624	July, so... Of course.
1893824	1895065	It's already out in Japan.
1896499	1896819	DarkSakura
1926573	1929615	I'm looking forward to seeing which Japanese gaming celebrity I'm going to run into this year.
1929875	1931356	I'm hoping for Yuji Naka.
1931577	1941684	I'm looking forward to seeing Paris Hilton at her booth trying to promote some cell phone game and asking her stupid questions and getting it all on film.
1942064	1943105	Rob, you should get her autograph.
1943953	1944313	We'll see.
1945954	1947416	Miklatop stole my number one.
1947456	1949577	My number one was the Luminous games.
1950618	1951779	Mine, it's three on mine.
1951839	1952779	Well, because you suck.
1952980	1956562	Dear Squeenix, by the way, we want Chrono Trigger for the DS.
1956742	1958604	And we want freaking Einhander 2.
1958964	1961766	Yes, Einhander 2 would be the best thing ever.
1961786	1962447	I love Einhander.
1962487	1964148	We broke that game out not too long ago.
1964168	1965949	I played it like a month ago.
1966049	1972394	If they're going to make an Einhander game, and since they don't really want to do that much work for it, port it over to the PSP.
1973314	1974915	or a better system.
1975256	1976536	Uh, comments in the chat room.
1977017	1977117	Yes.
1977157	1978398	Because I don't want to ignore you guys.
1978418	1978798	I'm sorry.
1979739	1983041	TetrisDSManiac64 says, Duke Nukem Forever.
1983581	1984142	Oh, yeah.
1984382	1985663	Uh, I hope to see that there.
1985983	1986503	Let's see.
1987444	1989566	Uh, 23rdMagus says, fucking StarCraft Ghost.
1989886	1990806	Although, wasn't that cancelled?
1990866	1992127	That's not coming out.
1992167	1992748	Sorry to say.
1993188	1994129	On, uh, current gen at least.
1994729	1995450	Uh, maybe later.
1996530	2001134	Um, GS191 says, Squeenix should just remake the whole damn FF series.
2001274	2001714	Give it time.
2002795	2002855	Uh,
2004189	2004589	Final Fantasy 3, Loki,
2026437	2028318	A website I used to visit an awful lot.
2028699	2030040	I don't know if I want to visit it anymore.
2030100	2030660	Why would this be?
2031100	2031481	Me too.
2032101	2039907	Alakazam used to be a really good website that was actually pretty much a hub for anything online.
2041348	2043249	Meaning games, like Final Fantasy XI.
2043309	2045871	Online games, yeah, like MMOs and stuff.
2047232	2049473	The thing is, though, is they just got bought out.
2049714	2053856	And they got bought out by a website called ZAM.
2054257	2055157	The ZAM Network.
2055438	2055938	Z-A-M.
2056573	2085956	which happens to be also like um owned there's a bunch of different chains of websites but it all comes back to one website that really gets people's panties in a bunch and that would be IGE which is best known for kill selling gold selling you name it they sell it ooh yuck and they own that website now so um sucks if you're still visiting that cause yeah lots of uh
2087728	2088449	Lots of problems there.
2088609	2090432	Mikotov, you surf Alakazam.
2090452	2091453	What's the reaction been like there?
2092295	2100747	Everybody's angry and most of the posts I saw said that everybody was canceling their premium accounts as soon as they run up for the month.
2101528	2104072	So not too many people are happy about this, I guess.
2104608	2106909	That's right, Atlas was selling the premium accounts.
2107109	2110190	And I was like, oh, it funds the dirty gill sellers.
2110270	2110930	Time to quit.
2112171	2116272	I still like Alakazam because it has information, but I'm not going to pay them money.
2117832	2119473	I didn't want to pay them money in the first place.
2119513	2120453	Yeah, I wouldn't pay them money either.
2120473	2121634	I can still use their search feature.
2121694	2122474	Internet is free!
2122894	2123214	It is.
2124174	2124755	Net zero, $9.95.
2125275	2126275	That's free.
2126315	2128556	How do you feel about gill selling, gold selling?
2128596	2129176	I don't care.
2130857	2131637	I don't care about it.
2134454	2134794	Yeah, yeah.
2135395	2139719	You know, if somebody were screwing up Ragnarok's economy that same way, you'd care about it mighty quick, I bet.
2140420	2141521	I don't play on IRO.
2144143	2145665	Oh, so you're stealing your Ragnarok.
2146265	2147367	I'm not stealing my Ragnarok.
2147387	2150129	Somebody else is stealing it, and I'm just, you know... You're just borrowing it.
2150149	2150750	...whoring them out.
2150770	2157556	You know, though, like on our new server in Final Fantasy, I haven't heard anybody talk about any gill sellers whatsoever, so it's good.
2157596	2158157	Maybe they're all gone.
2159200	2160782	or they're not a problem on this server.
2160982	2161322	We'll see.
2161983	2169711	Alright, DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down and find a good website that does deserve your attention and isn't going to sell out to gill sellers or gold sellers.
2170531	2172834	DarkSakura, what website did you pick this week?
2173804	2177226	This is actually one of the sites that I think is pretty cool is Silent Hill Heaven.
2178687	2181829	I go there all the time looking at pictures and stuff and it's pretty cool.
2182249	2193356	You can get pictures of weapons from the endings, screen captures, fan art, and they even have a translation on here that they were working on for the Silent Hill play novels.
2195584	2203367	For anyone who's probably heard me mention this before, the play novel was Japan only on the Game Boy, and it was running through two scenarios.
2203888	2209530	One where you play as Harry, and the other one where you play as Sybil.
2210558	2217466	Which, from what I understand, there was actually supposed to be a scenario with Sybil in the first game that never made it in.
2217747	2222852	So, this is more what her story was like along different ending lines.
2223974	2226977	Not all of it is there, only part of it is there, but it's pretty cool.
2227218	2228079	They're working on it.
2229995	2232877	They also, like I mentioned, have tons of pictures, tons of information.
2233318	2243406	They have stuff from the DVDs, The Lost Memories and Art of Silent Hill, Fanfic Gallery, I'm sorry, Fanfic Archive, Fan Art Gallery, all kinds of neat stuff.
2244447	2248470	If you go to SilentHillHeaven.com and just click on their image, it actually takes you to their forums.
2248931	2257858	So go to SilentHillHeaven.com slash site, that's capitalized, slash main, also capitalized, slash main.php, which is lowercase.
2258416	2260758	I don't know if it's case sensitive or not, so that's why I'm saying so.
2260778	2261979	All right.
2262379	2263400	But it's pretty neato.
2263580	2265102	Check it out now or Pyramid Head will kill you.
2266943	2267744	If you're lucky.
2269105	2270626	He'll do other things first.
2270646	2274229	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line very, very soon here.
2274249	2282016	If you want to call in and say hello, give us your opinion on whatever, you head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us, and all the details are right there.
2282036	2283597	You can also pick up the phone and call us.
2284265	2289210	916-226-9067 is the telephono number so check it out.
2291052	2298399	If you want to check out real quickly the Hideo blog, that's Hideo Kojima's blog there, there is a little
2299019	2299800	MetaGearSolid4
2329741	2335083	Shall we go to the telephones, the Skype lines, and see who's calling us today?
2336463	2337764	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2339464	2341565	How's it going, guys?
2341705	2342385	Hi, who's this?
2342465	2343205	It's DMN.
2343705	2344906	Hi, DMN.
2345006	2346366	Turn down your outgoing a little bit.
2346386	2347147	We can hear ourselves.
2347747	2348267	What's on your mind?
2351869	2352230	Not much.
2352390	2359314	I have a couple of bits of news out of the Nintendo camp that I think I can share without getting my head cut off.
2359675	2360896	Ooh, I like this.
2361016	2363317	I like this controversial news.
2363637	2365779	I hope one of them is what I think it is.
2366359	2366940	Well, let's see.
2367000	2368160	What can you share with us?
2368961	2370662	I can share some price news.
2371563	2371683	Oh.
2373744	2380949	The $79.99 I've been hearing floating around quite some time, so likely I've been hearing about
2381658	2382879	Mid-August, that might happen.
2384921	2390307	Also, when the DS Lite is released, it is likely that the regular DS model will drop to $99.99.
2394271	2396513	But other than that, I really haven't heard any other news.
2396753	2398134	Where were you guys at the soccer account?
2398535	2405622	Actually, can you confirm about Osutatakaya Landon being bought out as Elite Task Agent?
2408157	2409098	I've heard nothing of that.
2410239	2412021	I heard a rumor about that today, too.
2412181	2415745	Okay, so that's very cool, though, those rumors about the DS.
2415865	2422692	Well, I guess not so much rumors at this point, but the DS coming down to 99, the old school one, and the GameCube going down to 79.99.
2423592	2424113	Very cool.
2425234	2428017	I think I heard in there as well, where the hell were you at SakuraCon?
2428417	2435402	It just came up a little late for us, but we will definitely try to get up there next year because I miss Seattle.
2435442	2436463	I really do like it up there.
2436883	2439145	I'm actually planning on going to Vancouver at the end of June.
2440265	2442407	I've wanted to go to Sakura for a while.
2442447	2445189	I will arrange passes.
2445629	2446329	You will arrange what?
2446349	2448531	I'm repeating game manager this year.
2449411	2452774	I can arrange for some passes for you guys.
2453494	2453834	Sweet.
2453855	2454815	We like passes.
2455055	2457237	Do they get us backstage so we can meet rock stars?
2459342	2460283	Um, we'll see.
2460563	2460963	Sweet.
2461784	2462084	Awesome.
2463305	2465246	DMN, thanks so much for calling in.
2465266	2467067	Is there anything else you wanted to get out before we hang up on you?
2468808	2470729	Um, no.
2471069	2472530	Alright, then have a good one.
2472750	2473330	Thanks for calling.
2475172	2476072	Well, we appreciate that.
2476092	2478333	A little bit of the insider knowledge there on Nintendo.
2478834	2479194	Awesome.
2479934	2480455	Let's see.
2480575	2484097	Let's go and answer this one.
2484997	2485858	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2487352	2487632	Sorry.
2488113	2489634	Okay, something exploded, right?
2489654	2490414	It's picked up the phone.
2490434	2491515	Sounds like someone dropped a keyboard.
2491615	2493276	Wow, someone set us up the bomb.
2493316	2493716	Who's this?
2494777	2496098	Hi, this is Sephiroth1215.
2496138	2497739	Hi, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?
2498900	2508646	First off, I was wondering, will we be doing actual good coverage for the, you know, the Imani series this year?
2508766	2510947	Our coverage will be mediocre on all levels.
2512388	2516231	I'm just saying, like, because usually all sites, all other sites, they...
2516917	2517337	All right.
2517357	2517457	Also...
2546036	2552659	I actually made a short list of, um, things I noticed when I was playing Supernova not too long ago.
2553159	2553519	What's that?
2555460	2574567	Alright, I'm gonna try to go as fast as I can, but, um, um, I could say that I don't like the, um, there's a new mode select style because of the, um, uh, the all music is all the way down, you have to go all the way past to, um, the, uh, the, uh,
2575151	2575571	Nevermind.
2575591	2576893	Okay.
2577814	2580937	Well, that's a problem that we just took care of.
2582218	2582358	Yeah.
2582378	2584501	I'm sorry, I'm just trying to go too fast.
2584601	2585101	That's alright.
2585261	2590947	Well, you know, hopefully we'll have news on Supernova Consumer Style at E3 next week.
2590987	2591348	Yeah.
2592128	2595672	I mean, otherwise, I could just say good things about it, really.
2597494	2598515	From what I look like, it
2599048	2605573	It's pretty much done and I guess the memory card slots might be appearing because of pictures recently.
2619233	2621054	All right, well, I'm going to let you go, buddy.
2621354	2623354	Have a good one, and enjoy your DDR.
2623534	2633157	Before you take the next call, Rob, I have a DMN wanting me to share with everybody that there's a strong possibility of the new Earthbound series coming to the U.S.
2633237	2634217	Thank God.
2634397	2635477	They've heard our prayers.
2635577	2637338	I heard the new one's pretty mediocre, though.
2638498	2639398	It's still Mother.
2639418	2640438	It's still Earthbound.
2641179	2642799	I want to make love to it all night long.
2643139	2644820	I will definitely have this if it comes out.
2645200	2646180	Hi, you're on Orange Limes Radio.
2646200	2646540	Who's this?
2647557	2649439	This is Xander from somewhere.
2649639	2650700	Hi, Xander from somewhere.
2650820	2653262	Love the new icon on your Skype.
2653302	2655284	He's got the Rez game icon there.
2655324	2655605	Love it.
2655645	2655965	What's up?
2658307	2659228	Not a whole lot.
2660109	2664453	I have a theory on why they don't have any groove in the schools instead of DDR.
2664593	2665334	Because it sucks?
2665534	2666275	No, hold on.
2666355	2668477	Oh, because the kids are too fat to play it.
2671613	2672353	Wait a minute, though.
2673874	2677736	With that statement, you're just reaffirming the fact that In the Groove is not a game for beginners.
2679417	2680798	Or a game for sane people.
2681618	2682999	Or a game for people who like good games.
2683019	2684700	Be nice.
2684740	2686180	Hey, be nice.
2687201	2688942	Xander, please finish your thought.
2689002	2690743	I will hold these rude ones at bay.
2694217	2696117	I will turn these, look, I'm in front of the board.
2696157	2697217	I'll turn the mics off.
2697377	2697977	Watch me do it.
2698058	2699158	I can throw stuff at you from here.
2699278	2699758	I will do it.
2699978	2700298	I'll throw.
2700598	2701738	I got my hand on the cord.
2701778	2702659	Look, my hand's on the cord.
2702679	2703439	Stop it.
2703479	2706539	All right, Xander, what's on your mind?
2706639	2710220	I was just saying that everybody in West Virginia is a fat hillbilly.
2711801	2717622	Well, if those folks in West Virginia can address those cards and letters to Xander, care of our forums, okay?
2718658	2723802	By the way, for this summer, I'm doing this choir trip, and that's actually where we're going, is West Virginia.
2724923	2726824	Not that you really need to know that.
2726844	2727745	What choir is that?
2728845	2730427	It's a thing for a church.
2731067	2731407	All right.
2731888	2735791	Well, that's not very Christian of you to call them all fat hillbillies.
2735811	2742395	Then people in West Virginia be waiting for just all the church choirs that come through.
2742716	2745738	Ask for Xander, and when you find him, kick his ass.
2746613	2758058	I like how he said that the kids are all fat and they can handle DDR, but it's mostly because those kids are not elitist pricks and that's why they can handle ITG.
2760159	2761140	Xander, witty retort?
2763140	2763961	I like In the Groove.
2764321	2764661	I know you do.
2764681	2766142	I've been playing it a lot recently.
2766342	2766882	I know you do.
2768143	2769443	Don't listen to the haters, Xander.
2770744	2771704	It has neat music.
2772044	2773705	The steps are kind of crap.
2773825	2775006	Kidwhatever was a nice guy.
2775956	2778258	I like Life of a Butterfly, that's about it.
2778298	2779659	I like, which MC was that?
2779999	2781321	I don't know, I don't care.
2781361	2782381	I like MC Friend a lot.
2782722	2784443	Alright, Xander, anything else?
2785924	2791729	I have a question, like, do you know any video game news websites in Spanish?
2792770	2794692	Video game news websites in Spanish?
2795993	2797434	Orange Lounge Radio run through Alta Vista?
2797494	2798015	No, I don't know.
2798035	2798995	I don't know of any off the top of my head.
2799015	2800196	I found one, I think.
2801397	2804320	Well, I usually find them in, like, German and Russian.
2806207	2807067	It's not Spanish.
2807267	2809428	Which is not Spanish, so I'll have to hunt it down.
2809668	2811149	How do you say video game in Espanol?
2811429	2812309	Video game-o.
2813229	2814810	It's not video game-o.
2815310	2816670	El video game?
2817551	2818771	No, huecos de video.
2819271	2819671	There you go.
2819691	2820391	Put that in Google.
2821992	2824093	I tried, and it didn't really give me anything.
2825513	2826513	I'm going on the hunt now.
2826553	2827474	This is a personal challenge.
2827514	2827814	All right.
2828034	2830614	Stay tuned to chat room, but we're going to let you go so we can take another call, all right?
2831375	2831515	Okay.
2831535	2831735	Later.
2831955	2832155	Later.
2834451	2836493	Why does he always try to start a fight?
2837654	2839095	It's every time you're here, too.
2839175	2840917	He doesn't bring up in the groove unless you're here.
2841637	2844920	I'll come back with, you know, correct answers and the truth.
2845460	2846461	Let's go to the next call.
2846481	2847842	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2850505	2851085	No, they're not.
2851526	2853888	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
2855989	2859873	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
2862438	2863138	Okay, no one's there.
2863198	2864519	The volume's too low, dude.
2864539	2865320	We gotta let you go.
2865420	2866120	Go to somebody else.
2866380	2867541	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2868062	2868642	Hi, Sky.
2868742	2869662	It's Raven Stolfen.
2869803	2870663	Hi, Raven Stolfen.
2870683	2871243	What's on your mind?
2872824	2877387	Well, what's on my mind is those press conferences that before E3.
2877607	2877828	Yep.
2879108	2879789	On our mind, too.
2880569	2882510	Which one is you most excited for?
2882791	2886293	Nintendo, because they're holding the biggest package in their pants still.
2888257	2889558	Yeah, because it's the Wii.
2890599	2891219	You got it!
2891940	2895683	I'm interested in seeing PlayStation, or Sonys, and Nintendos.
2896083	2901107	Microsoft, I couldn't care, because they're, well, now it's probably Halo 3, which, oh my god, I didn't know that was coming out.
2901668	2903069	Ever.
2903089	2909314	I think Xbox may, I'm looking forward to all of them, because I think Xbox may, I want to know if they're going to say anything about HD DVD.
2909374	2911616	That's all I, I just want to know if they're going to even go there.
2911876	2912556	I want to laugh at them.
2913537	2914198	Oh, stop.
2914258	2914838	They're fine.
2914858	2915439	There's nothing wrong.
2915459	2915579	Me too.
2916713	2917193	I like the E3 on PSP.
2917213	2918094	That made me very giddy as hell.
2918114	2918474	Well, we're glad.
2945903	2949869	and I'm glad there's a lot of diversity on Orange Lounge Radio.
2949929	2957218	There's a girl, there's a gay guy, and there is a straight married dude that just loves Windows to death.
2959505	2983204	Yeah, you know, we're an odd pairing of people, but, you know, we like games, and I like the fact that we're just... I think part of what makes our show so interesting, if I can have an ego here for a minute, is what I like about this program is that we don't make it any secret that we have lives outside of gaming, and sometimes we're a little tongue-in-cheek with our gaming, but we're real, you know, and that's just what we want to bring to you guys.
2983264	2984685	It's just, you know, a real show.
2985105	2985425	I think...
2986226	2997035	Part of what I really liked about the show I used to be on, Under Sedation Live, that I'm trying to bring over here to Orange Lounge Radio, was the fact that it just sounded like a bunch of people at Denny's sitting around talking shit.
2997415	2998456	And that's what we do here.
2998496	3005342	We just kind of sit around and talk and let you guys all eavesdrop in on it and participate in the big thing as well.
3006463	3010146	We couldn't do it so much in the beginning, but now we can let you guys join us at the big table.
3010446	3010607	Yeah.
3011267	3013008	Oh, one more thing about the wedding.
3014428	3018890	I went to a Jewish wedding, and yeah, they do have the little chairs up in the air.
3020630	3025592	Yeah, we didn't do it because her relatives weren't getting up and doing anything.
3025612	3027412	Another thing that got botched at your wedding.
3027812	3029293	Hey, at least you didn't get hurt.
3030013	3030994	True.
3031094	3033514	Because my sister got hurt in that.
3035055	3035335	Well...
3037428	3040430	Maybe those weddings should come with disclaimers to be more careful.
3040670	3040970	I don't know.
3040990	3041771	Of course weddings.
3041991	3045572	I have no problem with them, but, you know, I've been in one.
3045873	3046233	All right.
3046753	3047614	All right, we've got to let you go.
3047634	3048414	We've got to talk games.
3048454	3049334	We'll talk weddings later.
3049875	3050135	All right.
3050215	3050815	All right, later, dude.
3050975	3052416	I found Spanish video game sites.
3052616	3053677	What is it?
3053697	3055718	A bunch of them, and I used Google Mexico.
3057239	3058299	Ah, good thought.
3058559	3059940	Google.com.mx.
3060640	3062121	What, Miklatov, what?
3063582	3065263	You're just going to censor me.
3068122	3068942	It's a free country.
3070203	3071443	No, it's okay.
3071463	3074164	I just didn't know dirty Mexicans could use the internet.
3075705	3076225	You know what?
3076685	3077025	What?
3077925	3079086	I'm bringing tequila to E3.
3079346	3079706	Wow.
3080846	3082007	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3082747	3089369	Hey, uh... Sorry, but you're cutting out.
3089709	3093551	So all we heard was the hey, and then it went dead silent.
3093871	3094311	Who is this?
3095603	3096483	SSJ100 Matt.
3096583	3097544	Hi, SSJ100 Matt.
3097564	3098384	What's on your mind?
3099685	3101726	Mazel Tov on your wedding, Loki, by the way.
3101746	3102726	Thank you.
3102746	3103066	All right.
3105727	3121814	No, I wanted to talk about when Sephiroth1215 called in, he was trying to explain... You know how in... Oh, you know, with Supernova, he was trying to explain... You know how in Konomics, you know how you had to select all songs in order to get all the songs?
3123495	3123935	Uh-huh.
3125596	3127656	Well, you kind of have to do that with Supernova.
3128877	3129677	It's kind of annoying.
3129857	3130837	Is it really the end of the world?
3131697	3132817	No, it's just kind of annoying.
3132877	3134358	Is it really going to ruin the game for people?
3135418	3135898	Not really.
3136138	3137318	Alright, so what's the big fucking deal?
3137938	3138278	I don't know.
3138979	3139999	Alright, enough said.
3140399	3141279	What else is on your mind?
3141299	3142139	Problem solved.
3142179	3142999	Problem solved.
3144720	3150741	Um... Uh... Uh... I don't know, that threw me off track.
3151001	3151081	Um...
3153692	3154873	I guess I got nothing else to say.
3156174	3156635	Gong.
3157516	3157856	All right.
3160298	3162821	I just wanted to do that to somebody all night long.
3162881	3163261	Poor guy.
3163741	3164062	All right.
3164722	3168446	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3170768	3171168	Hi.
3171549	3172329	Hi, who's this?
3173010	3174271	This is Hurricane Z-Man.
3174591	3175853	Hi, Hurricane what?
3176733	3177134	Z-Man.
3177434	3179396	Hi, Hurricane Z-Man, what's on your mind?
3181069	3185112	I just wanted to know what you guys thought of Final Fantasy XII.
3185212	3190855	I know there isn't a whole lot out about it, but I was thoroughly disappointed with Final Fantasy XI.
3191856	3192116	What?
3192996	3193857	Alright, here's the thing.
3195157	3197819	Final Fantasy XI is a completely different game.
3197859	3200200	It took the Final Fantasy universe and turned it upside down.
3200260	3200821	Here's the thing.
3200901	3208165	I've played the Final Fantasy XII demo, and I've played it twice now, essentially, because I played the E3 demo a couple years ago when they actually had it there.
3208305	3210165	That was stupid the first demo they had.
3210325	3213646	But the demo they put in with Dragon Quest VIII is great.
3213986	3219648	And the thing that's great about it is that it fuses that Final Fantasy XI universe with the rest of it.
3219688	3226529	And I don't want to say that to kind of put you off, but what I'm saying is that it kind of makes XI make sense.
3226929	3232791	Because honestly, in the scope of all the Final Fantasy games, I think the only one that XI has a lot in common with is II.
3234238	3238941	If you go and play Final Fantasy 2, it's actually very similar to 11 in some ways, without the whole real-time battle.
3240742	3241242	I thought it was 4.
3242703	3244704	Well, yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.
3244724	3249626	4 will forever be my favorite, with 6 a close runner-up, just because I'm a Super Nintendo brat.
3249987	3252888	But, you know, I think 12 is going to be really great.
3254569	3258731	I've heard really good things from folks who've imported the Japanese version.
3258911	3262073	I haven't bothered to look at it because I can't really understand Japanese anymore.
3262193	3266254	and I want my first experience with the game to be one that I understand fully.
3267174	3276916	But I don't see many reasons why this will disappoint, but I think the only thing that's going to turn people off is the battle system, because it is a little more like XI's, but not... Which is crap.
3277456	3278196	Which is fun.
3278216	3287397	No, I like XI's battle system, and I think the problem that you had with XI was that you had to sit around and wait for a party, and then when you got one, the people were, you know, bossy.
3287417	3289698	Stupid, retarded, brain damaged.
3289758	3291198	But in Final Fantasy XII, you're the boss.
3291929	3292789	They're all your bitches.
3294530	3295610	Bitch of the White Mage.
3295990	3296350	Yeah.
3296490	3296730	All right.
3297371	3299251	What was that, dude?
3299291	3299911	Sounds a lot better.
3300311	3301072	All right.
3301112	3301392	You know what?
3302932	3305233	Check out the demo because Dragon Quest VIII is a great game.
3306353	3307273	I'll have to download that.
3307473	3307713	All right.
3308394	3309254	Hey, thanks, guys.
3309274	3310954	Keep up the great work with the show, guys.
3311054	3311515	Not a problem.
3311535	3312015	Appreciate it.
3312035	3312615	Have a good one, buddy.
3313175	3313895	Thanks for calling.
3314896	3316216	We like a good... We like a good...
3317734	3319054	Ego Inflation once in a while.
3319294	3320855	Alright, thanks for the phone calls, guys.
3320915	3322915	Sorry to those that got cut out tonight.
3323755	3325216	Maybe we'll take more later if we have time.
3325236	3328237	But for now, we've got to get to the last minute stories.
3329137	3333078	Anybody have a last minute story they want to share with our listeners?
3335598	3335778	No?
3336819	3337599	I do, I do, I do.
3337739	3339259	What, DarkSakura?
3339299	3340279	Yuri, lever link this to me.
3341340	3341840	Sony turned 60.
3344858	3374175	that was pretty cool hooray happy birthday basically they started May 7th 1946 by Ibuka Masaru who was a post-war engineering entrepreneur and started Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Totsuko with Akio Morita and the company basically became Sony happy happy birthday from all of us to you I can't sing and one more

3378191	3380894	For us three people who like Perfect Dark Zero.
3380974	3382616	I just couldn't get into that game, sorry.
3383037	3385340	I know why people would like it, but I just couldn't get into it.
3386392	3389733	They've actually put up the first round of downloadable content for Perfect Dark Zero.
3389853	3392514	You do have to wait a little bit longer, though, for the premium apps.
3393895	3401318	There's new bots available in Dark Ops multiplayer games as well as in Deathmatch that split into various new AIs.
3403278	3412062	Microsoft and Rare have put in some bug fixes that basically keep people from floating through the air, keeping the capture flags.
3413763	3415464	Receiving positive points for team killing.
3415904	3416485	That's a big one.
3418226	3424570	They've just gone in and fixed a lot of the little bugs and glitches in the game as well as putting out the stuff.
3426211	3427472	That's pretty cool.
3430434	3431054	I guess that's it.
3431274	3432916	That's going to do it for tonight's program.
3433956	3434417	I'm tired.
3434457	3435577	I'm ready to go to E3.
3435697	3438079	I'm ready to pile in the car tomorrow and start driving to LA.
3438219	3439280	Fun times.
3440220	3443863	I'm looking forward to some sort of breakfast sandwich with egg and bacon.
3444904	3445605	If you're good.
3445805	3447706	I'm going home and doing homework.
3447826	3449147	Alright, let's wrap this up.
3449167	3450609	Who wants to do my flash homework for me?
3450649	3451389	Not me, said the bee.
3451549	3452390	Let's wrap this up.
3452610	3453631	Mikltov, final thought.
3453791	3454252	Oh, what?
