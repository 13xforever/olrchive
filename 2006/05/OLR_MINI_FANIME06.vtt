00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
This week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio was recorded live at Fanime 2006 at the San Jose Convention Center.

00:06.500 --> 00:13.000
Due to the additional technical challenges with the live recording, you may notice sound quality issues compared to our usual shows.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.500
Enjoy this special live episode of Orange Lounge Radio, and we'll see you back here next week with episode 185 of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:43.000 --> 00:56.520
All right, we are here live at Fanime 2006, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:56.520 --> 01:03.520
We're taping our podcast here in front of, you know, dozens and dozens of people.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.920
Dozens and dozens of people.

01:04.920 --> 01:05.920
You know what, though?

01:05.920 --> 01:08.180
There's more people in here now than listen to the very first episode of Orange Lounge

01:08.180 --> 01:10.520
Radio, so it's all right.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.240
Technically there's dozens of people in the other room.

01:12.240 --> 01:21.240
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.240
What are you dressed up as today, Dark Sakura?

01:24.240 --> 01:27.240
Tamari from Naruto, only in the manga so far.

01:27.240 --> 01:34.240
She's cosplaying today, boys and girls. Isn't the Naruto thing played out when it comes to cosplay?

01:34.240 --> 01:36.240
It isn't when you only have a week to make your costume.

01:36.240 --> 01:40.120
Excuses, excuses, next year, you need to, now I like this.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.420
This dude's got an intricate costume back there.

01:42.420 --> 01:42.920
I like that.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.520
Tim is always the best.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.680
OK, how is that?

01:45.680 --> 01:47.640
We have our Star Blazers.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.800
That's awesome.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.680
Also, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:50.680 --> 01:51.080
Hi.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.680
All right, so this is actually the second time

01:52.680 --> 01:55.040
we're recording the intro, thanks to Tech Master Loki.

01:55.040 --> 01:55.520
Thank you.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.980
All right, but that's OK.

01:56.980 --> 01:59.320
Through the magic of radio, it'll all be brought together.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.960
At least we figured that out about 10 minutes in and not

02:02.960 --> 02:04.000
all the way in.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
like an interview I did at E3 a couple years ago with Jason Enos.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
You know what? I still hate you for that.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I know. Loki asked Jason Enos,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
like Jason Enos is the guy who produces the DDR games,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
asked him point blank what he thinks about In the Groove,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
and the answer's lost forever thanks to yours truly.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Whoops!

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Alright, anyway.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
We like to start off the show talking about our gaming week and what we've been playing.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
So Dark Soccer, what kind of stuff have you been playing this week on the game scene?

02:30.000 --> 02:36.840
I played Metal Slug 5 big shock to everybody on on Friday have they

02:36.840 --> 02:41.960
increased the graphics yet on Metal Slug no okay but you can shoot more people

02:41.960 --> 02:47.120
and stab people and get heavy machine gun cool death more often apparently

02:47.120 --> 02:51.560
they have Metal Slug 6 in the e-gaming room so I have to go check that out

02:51.560 --> 02:56.400
later right on and I played Ragnarok online I played World of Warcraft I'm

02:56.400 --> 02:57.560
I'm still level 7.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.920
Go me.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.680
And then I played some Kingdom Hearts.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.480
And I've played a little bit of everything.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.680
And Dana's still playing Uno.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.480
I've been tempted to go back to World of Warcraft a little bit.

03:09.480 --> 03:09.980
You should.

03:09.980 --> 03:10.480
You should.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.300
Be a noob with me.

03:11.300 --> 03:14.080
I don't want to play two MMOs.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.280
I'm playing two MMOs.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.920
My link shell on Final Fantasy XI

03:16.920 --> 03:19.080
is going to hate me if I don't play more and get up

03:19.080 --> 03:21.080
to level 70 so I can do dynamics with them.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.160
But also, we got another pinball machine.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.080
Oh, what'd you get?

03:25.080 --> 03:28.760
Johnny Mnemonic, which pisses me off because we were supposed to have a Doctor Who.

03:28.760 --> 03:32.260
Now, please tell me the Johnny Mnemonic table is not as crappy as the movie was.

03:32.260 --> 03:36.340
It's supposed to be a pretty good table. I was too upset with it to look at it.

03:36.340 --> 03:38.320
I want a Doctor Who.

03:38.320 --> 03:43.900
All right. Are you ever going to get Adam's Family pinball? No, I'm going to get World Cup Soccer 2006.

03:43.900 --> 03:47.600
That's going to be expensive, isn't it? No, dirt cheap. They made a bajillion of them.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.780
Oh, wow. All right. Cool. You need to get an Elvira table. That's what I want.

03:50.780 --> 03:52.920
Uh-uh. Or pinbot.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.800
Dark Knight 2000, Black Knight 2000, Black Knight, sorry.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.640
Loki, how's your gaming week been?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.560
New Super Mario Brothers, that was fun.

04:00.560 --> 04:04.040
And played a little bit of Ridge Racer 6,

04:04.040 --> 04:05.080
which is really cool.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.440
And then, of course, goes Recon Advanced War Fighter

04:07.440 --> 04:12.360
on the 360, because yeah, it was fun shooting people.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.720
Let me guess, easy achievement points, huh?

04:14.720 --> 04:15.880
Actually, it is.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.560
Loki's an achievement points whore.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.200
But then, I think that's pretty much it.

04:22.200 --> 04:26.340
little bit bejeweled just because we have it now. I don't know why I bought

04:26.340 --> 04:33.280
that game. Nellie likes it more than I do. What? I bought it for you. That's right.

04:33.280 --> 04:39.680
Yeah, see. For everyone hearing only half of this conversation, we've got Nellie

04:39.680 --> 04:47.360
looking a little bit upset. Or a little bit WTF. All right, so anyways, yeah that's it.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.880
All right, my gaming week's been interesting because I actually am

04:50.880 --> 04:55.280
playing a sports game which if you know me I don't really get into a lot of

04:55.280 --> 04:59.680
sports titles because you know I don't get mad and yeah the last like sport

04:59.680 --> 05:02.700
game I really got into is probably Blades of Steel but I'll tell you what

05:02.700 --> 05:05.720
there's a great sports game out for the 360 right now that I'm having a lot of

05:05.720 --> 05:09.240
fun with it's Rockstar table tennis oh that's funny because I thought you said

05:09.240 --> 05:14.200
sports and table tennis in the same who would have thought that Rockstar who

05:14.200 --> 05:17.000
made these Grand Theft Auto games would make such a fun little sports title I

05:17.000 --> 05:20.760
like it because it's really easy to pick up it's easy to kind of get into it it's

05:20.760 --> 05:22.480
got a really good training mode with it.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.760
The only downside is that I would have liked table tennis.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.320
No, it's fun.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.900
It didn't have any character creation.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.820
I'm wondering how they have time to make games

05:30.820 --> 05:32.480
when they're busy being sued.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.480
Who, Rockstar?

05:33.480 --> 05:35.880
But they're not going to get sued over table tennis.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.320
There's no, unless there's a hidden sex scene.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.880
That's it, I'm suing them over table tennis.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.580
No, what if there's a hidden sex scene?

05:40.580 --> 05:42.920
Because you know what girls can do with ping pong balls.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.960
Bop, bop, bop.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.080
Anyway, but I don't think that's in there.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.280
So forget it.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.000
But I've been having a lot of fun with it.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.200
And it's really easy to pick up.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.780
And the online mode plays pretty well.

05:52.780 --> 05:55.200
I was actually playing against some guy on the East Coast

05:55.200 --> 05:55.840
this morning.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.600
And it was cool because I haven't really

05:58.600 --> 06:00.960
played a lot of games on Xbox where people

06:00.960 --> 06:02.880
have been nice to talk to.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.080
Because if you play Halo 2, you get a lot of little kids

06:05.080 --> 06:07.360
on there going, I'm going to kick your ass.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.320
But on table tennis, I had some place in the competition.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.960
Because if you say, I'm going to kick your ass in table tennis,

06:12.960 --> 06:14.160
that sounds retarded.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.000
Well, no, the guy asked me if I actually

06:16.000 --> 06:18.120
played real table tennis or if I was just playing a game.

06:18.120 --> 06:18.800
Oh my god.

06:18.800 --> 06:32.800
He told me he plays real table tennis, and I'm like, this must bug the hell out of you that you can't control all those people that play table tennis and own a 360. The demographic has finally been realized.

06:32.800 --> 06:39.800
You know what's great about it, though, is it's cheap. It's relatively cheap for a 360 title, and it's fun. I liked it.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.800
It's definitely something you guys should rent.

06:41.800 --> 06:46.200
I mean, it's not going to be a game for everybody, but rent it, check it out, read the reviews,

06:46.200 --> 06:49.500
see if it's something that sounds like you'd be interested in, and I think you'd be surprised. I was.

06:49.500 --> 06:56.500
Or wait and buy Hitman, which also came out the week after, which is probably a far superior game.

06:56.500 --> 07:00.200
Alright, whatever. Anyway, let's get into some news. We only have a little bit of time here.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.700
We want to talk about the Wii.

07:01.700 --> 07:07.200
Now, last week on the program, we made a bold prediction stating that October 18th

07:07.200 --> 07:10.560
would be the release date for the Wii. And Loki, remind us real quick for the crowd here

07:10.560 --> 07:11.960
who may not have heard the show,

07:11.960 --> 07:15.360
why did we come to an October 18th speculated date?

07:15.360 --> 07:19.720
Well, a couple things. First off, we have a few dates actually from

07:19.720 --> 07:22.760
three or four different publishers right now

07:22.760 --> 07:25.880
and SNK, THQ,

07:25.880 --> 07:30.360
and, God, I can't remember the last one. Anyways, they've all agreed that the date is going to...

07:30.360 --> 07:35.240
Well, they have games coming out on October 11th and also October 18th.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.940
And usually, you know, you have games come out before the release date and on the release

07:38.940 --> 07:39.940
date.

07:39.940 --> 07:42.820
Now when you say we have dates, you're talking about your distributor.

07:42.820 --> 07:43.820
Yes.

07:43.820 --> 07:44.820
Okay.

07:44.820 --> 07:48.920
The other thing is that October 18th happens to mark the anniversary of the original Nintendo

07:48.920 --> 07:50.720
Entertainment System.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.820
What a nice way to celebrate the virtual console with the 8-bit downloads, right?

07:54.820 --> 07:55.820
Of course.

07:55.820 --> 07:59.740
And so, of course, it makes, you know, perfect sense that they're going to release it on

07:59.740 --> 08:03.220
the anniversary because Nintendo likes doing things like that.

08:03.220 --> 08:07.380
Now by itself, that doesn't seem like compelling evidence, but when you consider that you've

08:07.380 --> 08:12.380
got three publishers who've all targeted the same date and put it in the distributor system,

08:12.380 --> 08:14.540
that's too much of a coincidence to ignore.

08:14.540 --> 08:17.260
And you know, I read another story on the internet this week that was from, I think,

08:17.260 --> 08:21.140
a British site that was talking about their anticipating the release of the Wii to be

08:21.140 --> 08:24.500
November 20th over there, because I guess Red Steel showed up and some computer over

08:24.500 --> 08:27.680
there is November 20th, which is a confirmed launch title.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.700
And typically, there's a one-month delay between U.S. and Europe.

08:31.700 --> 08:36.200
So you roll one month back from November 20th and you're just barely there within that same

08:36.200 --> 08:37.200
time frame.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.800
So it makes a lot of sense.

08:38.800 --> 08:42.040
Now granted, take this with a grain of salt, somebody called into the show last week who

08:42.040 --> 08:46.440
has ties with Nintendo who said, nope, October 18th can't be the date, we haven't seen enough

08:46.440 --> 08:49.960
of it here, but the coincidences keep piling up, don't they, Loki?

08:49.960 --> 08:50.960
Yes.

08:50.960 --> 08:51.960
What happened?

08:51.960 --> 08:57.040
Konami also gave us just this week information about Elibits and yeah, funny enough, it's

08:57.040 --> 08:58.040
coming on the 18th.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.040
Of October.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.040
Yeah.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.040
Very interesting.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.040
Very interesting.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.340
More and more coincidences.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.340
Very interesting.

09:04.340 --> 09:05.340
What about prices?

09:05.340 --> 09:06.660
Do you guys get info on prices?

09:06.660 --> 09:07.660
Yeah.

09:07.660 --> 09:13.380
Actually, THQ on their two games, both the SpongeBob Creature from the Krusty Krab and

09:13.380 --> 09:17.300
Avatar The Last Airbender, both those games are going to be priced at $49.99.

09:17.300 --> 09:21.980
So it seems to be keeping the same price points that you'd see now in current generation titles,

09:21.980 --> 09:24.060
but hopefully they'll go down a little bit.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.060
Awesome.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.540
Now, first party titles typically run a little cheaper than third parties though, right?

09:28.540 --> 09:29.540
Usually.

09:29.540 --> 09:35.480
we might have Mario Galaxy for 39 maybe Zelda Twilight Princess 39 I don't know

09:35.480 --> 09:39.260
if they can milk more money out of Zelda I think they'll charge 49 don't you

09:39.260 --> 09:44.060
definitely yeah all right so I guess that's some of our further predictions

09:44.060 --> 09:47.420
on the Wii it's all added it's too much coincidence for us to ignore there are

09:47.420 --> 09:51.580
some people who don't really care for the Wii though well who well that would

09:51.580 --> 09:58.460
actually be Takahashi Keita who was the designer of Katamari Damacy but that guy

09:58.460 --> 10:03.920
is kind of like a he's kind of a centric isn't he cuz he's like I'm not gonna do

10:03.920 --> 10:09.140
video games anymore I'm gonna go design playground equipment for children

10:09.140 --> 10:11.820
I'm not really interested in the Wii I don't think a controller should have

10:11.820 --> 10:15.200
that much influence on the enjoyment of games I mean he's basically going on

10:15.200 --> 10:18.740
saying he understands that yeah they're excited you're the controller will allow

10:18.740 --> 10:21.700
this to happen this to happen but they're putting too much emphasis on the

10:21.700 --> 10:25.820
controller he has also confirmed that he is no longer working on any Katamari

10:25.820 --> 10:32.080
Damacy games however Namco is releasing more without him and if the PSP one is

10:32.080 --> 10:39.140
any indication yeah now I I could agree with that though that you know right now

10:39.140 --> 10:43.080
it looks like the Wii is all emphasizing on the motion but you know that's a

10:43.080 --> 10:45.860
selling point and you think about Nintendo when they first showed the DS

10:45.860 --> 10:49.820
they had a lot of touch heavy things that were going into that and it seemed

10:49.820 --> 10:52.580
like Nintendo was gonna whore the touchscreen and to an extent the launch

10:52.580 --> 10:55.580
titles did but now it's settled down a little bit and you look at a game like

10:55.580 --> 11:00.740
new Super Mario Brothers it's a perfect balance for the DS and so I think the

11:00.740 --> 11:04.340
Wii will go that route too. Well he did make another semi-announcement too.

11:04.340 --> 11:09.380
What's that? About what he's doing next is all I can say is it'll be on a next

11:09.380 --> 11:13.940
gen console and it will be fun that's all I can say. So he is doing games still.

11:13.940 --> 11:18.760
Didn't he say he wasn't gonna do games? He's gonna do playground designer

11:18.760 --> 11:25.040
tycoon. Playground of doom. Sim playground. Alright well we'll see. Anyway

11:25.040 --> 11:28.040
Let's talk about the PlayStation 3 for a little bit.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.040
Actually, no, this has to do with the Wii 2, doesn't it, Loki?

11:31.040 --> 11:33.040
Yeah, about that.

11:33.040 --> 11:36.040
Actually, there was a survey done for Famitsu Magazine,

11:36.040 --> 11:39.040
which they were basically polling their readers

11:39.040 --> 11:42.040
to which next-gen system they were looking forward to.

11:42.040 --> 11:46.040
And interesting enough, the Wii pretty much won out.

11:46.040 --> 11:50.040
73% of the vote was towards the Wii,

11:50.040 --> 11:53.040
with PS3 coming in second at 22.6%,

11:53.040 --> 11:56.960
and the 360 only getting a measly 4.4%.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.720
One of the things, though, that they were also questioning

11:59.720 --> 12:01.880
was the price of the system,

12:01.880 --> 12:05.040
and it was quite funny that most of,

12:05.040 --> 12:06.280
well, it's kind of obvious,

12:06.280 --> 12:08.600
most of the readers of Famitsu found

12:08.600 --> 12:10.920
that the PS3 was way too damn expensive,

12:10.920 --> 12:14.320
and even they wouldn't pay for that, so I don't know.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.720
I find that kind of interesting.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.260
I think it's interesting that the Xbox

12:18.260 --> 12:20.040
is trailing so much in Japan,

12:20.040 --> 12:22.240
and yet it seems to, after E3,

12:22.240 --> 12:25.900
kind of general feeling I have is it seems to have all the inertia here in

12:25.900 --> 12:29.960
this country right now you know with well kind of the we did it you know such

12:29.960 --> 12:33.960
a huge showing too but you know it's definitely a different order here in the

12:33.960 --> 12:39.760
US definitely actually after I've spoken with a few of my friends in the UK I've

12:39.760 --> 12:44.160
only talked to one person who has any excitement at all about the ps3 it's all

12:44.160 --> 12:51.200
been everything has been we we we we all the way home well you know I think part

12:51.200 --> 12:54.080
of that might be because Nintendo didn't make a whole lot of promises on the

12:54.080 --> 12:57.880
outset but PlayStation 3 you know last year at e3 Sony came out and said all

12:57.880 --> 13:00.760
these promises hey we're gonna have two HDMI ports we're gonna do all this stuff

13:00.760 --> 13:04.320
and here's some games that didn't even come back the next year you know so I

13:04.320 --> 13:10.000
think Sony's press conference felt a lot more like let down whereas you know

13:10.000 --> 13:15.040
Nintendo's press conference was kind of like you know kind of a little more it

13:15.040 --> 13:20.000
was all Zelda that's right it's I mean the audience who said Super Smash

13:20.000 --> 13:22.280
Brothers Brawl, I mean that's kind of stole the show there.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.400
Actually speaking of which, who saw VG Cats lately?

13:26.400 --> 13:27.440
What did they do in that?

13:27.440 --> 13:30.920
OK, it had a snake sneaking up in the box behind Mario

13:30.920 --> 13:33.800
and going, crat.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.200
It was like blood, decapitation?

13:35.200 --> 13:36.440
Yeah, it was blood and decapitation.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.600
Then Kirby's like, uh.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.480
All right, we've got to keep them moving.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.400
We've got 30 minutes.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.880
Anyway, the PlayStation 3, now this

13:41.880 --> 13:43.120
could be very good for them.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.760
If they see something popular, they

13:44.760 --> 13:46.140
ought to do something just like it, right?

13:46.140 --> 13:48.640
It's going to have downloadable games just like Xbox Live.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.280
is what we're thinking right now.

13:50.280 --> 13:53.200
There's actually a job posting that showed up on Craigslist.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.380
That game company, that's the name of them,

13:55.380 --> 13:57.960
that game company, they're looking for a superstar

13:57.960 --> 14:00.120
engineer with a strong graphics background

14:00.120 --> 14:02.880
to develop an unannounced downloadable title

14:02.880 --> 14:04.920
for the PlayStation 3 launch in November.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.000
So there it is right there on Craigslist

14:07.000 --> 14:09.500
that they're doing some type of downloadable title that's

14:09.500 --> 14:11.940
going to be available on the launch.

14:11.940 --> 14:17.040
Now, I guess some IGN who picked up this story actually

14:17.040 --> 14:21.620
contacted somebody that worked for the game company and found out that they are

14:21.620 --> 14:24.740
going to be having a service that has downloadable casual games just like

14:24.740 --> 14:27.960
Xbox Live Arcade and it's going to be available on the launch day of the

14:27.960 --> 14:33.660
PlayStation 3. Also it's going to be the game is going to be just like their

14:33.660 --> 14:39.980
current free web game called flow that I guess has a lot of addictive qualities

14:39.980 --> 14:44.580
about it although I've never played it so I can tell you. So not a really big

14:44.580 --> 14:47.300
surprise there that Sony is going to be doing something similar to the Xbox Live

14:47.300 --> 14:50.860
Arcade you know Nintendo's kind of doing it too just in a different way with a

14:50.860 --> 14:54.300
virtual console but they've also said before that they're going to allow folks

14:54.300 --> 14:58.820
to come up with their own stuff not just classic 8-bit you know titles although I

14:58.820 --> 15:03.500
would like to see some of those horrible Mario ROM hacks show up on the virtual

15:03.500 --> 15:08.540
console I think that would be fun Loki what else about PlayStation 3 well the

15:08.540 --> 15:12.540
first ps3 is off the production line are actually going to be the ones for the UK

15:12.540 --> 15:16.680
that could be good or bad actually because well anyways this was confirmed

15:16.680 --> 15:21.480
by the Sony Computer Entertainment president of Europe and also he happens

15:21.480 --> 15:25.440
to be a CEO David Reeves confirmed that the first ps3s off the production line

15:25.440 --> 15:29.440
will be the PAL units and what's kind of interesting about that is usually the

15:29.440 --> 15:35.120
first units off the line are the ones that are the buggiest so sorry sorry yeah

15:35.120 --> 15:40.480
that's funny all right shifting gears a little bit moving away from the

15:40.480 --> 15:46.120
PlayStation 3 for a minute. As I mentioned before, we kind of started here

15:46.120 --> 15:50.660
as a music-based station and then kind of grew into other video games. There's

15:50.660 --> 15:55.000
been some news lately on Guitar Hero possibly making a move to the arcade. It

15:55.000 --> 15:58.140
was kind of a post that was floating around some of the big Bahmani forums

15:58.140 --> 16:03.100
talking about that in the Trocadero, of all places, there is a prototype machine

16:03.100 --> 16:07.540
for playing Guitar Hero. It's actually being manned by live people and what

16:07.540 --> 16:12.860
they do is they just take your money and then you get to play it. Now, I don't know if they

16:12.860 --> 16:16.720
were doing like a, you know, trying to make money off of PlayStation 2, but supposedly

16:16.720 --> 16:20.860
the people who were running the thing were saying that someone wants to see if the game

16:20.860 --> 16:25.060
has viability as an arcade machine. So that could be interesting considering we have a

16:25.060 --> 16:26.740
lot of arcades here that already have guitar free.

16:26.740 --> 16:30.640
Yeah, I was going to say, couldn't they just say, oh, the guitar fix is successful, maybe,

16:30.640 --> 16:33.860
well, since we copied them, why not just copy them in the arcade? So...

16:33.860 --> 16:35.860
Oh, wait a minute though, wait a minute though.

16:35.860 --> 16:37.860
There was also an Njermulami arcade game.

16:37.860 --> 16:39.860
There was also Namco had a guitar game.

16:39.860 --> 16:41.860
I still disagree with you because I think in certain arcades,

16:41.860 --> 16:45.860
I think there's a lot of room where Guitar Hero can deliver that Guitar Freaks can,

16:45.860 --> 16:47.860
especially when it comes to the song list.

16:47.860 --> 16:49.860
I think people kind of walk by a Guitar Freaks machine,

16:49.860 --> 16:53.860
and most people, meaning family with kids,

16:53.860 --> 16:56.860
don't recognize the stuff that's playing on a Guitar Freaks machine,

16:56.860 --> 16:58.860
but they walk by a Guitar Hero machines, they're going to go,

16:58.860 --> 17:02.860
hey, more than a feeling.

17:02.860 --> 17:05.860
I think it's going to be successful.

17:05.860 --> 17:07.860
If they want to do it, I don't know.

17:07.860 --> 17:12.860
The other thing that they were saying is that it's going to have about 40 to 50 songs in the final arcade release,

17:12.860 --> 17:16.860
and that the controller would obviously be more sturdier, a bit larger, and a bit more like Guitar Freaks.

17:16.860 --> 17:18.860
Well, I would hope so.

17:18.860 --> 17:23.860
Also, they were saying that there's going to be a tilt sensor in there so they'll know if you're left or right-handed.

17:23.860 --> 17:25.860
That's very cool.

17:25.860 --> 17:27.860
That's something interesting.

17:27.860 --> 17:29.860
They love us.

17:29.860 --> 17:33.980
Dark Sakura, kind of moving on to Microsoft and Nintendo.

17:33.980 --> 17:35.780
We talked a lot about Sony.

17:35.780 --> 17:38.180
You know, Bill Gates was actually

17:38.180 --> 17:42.620
talking about the various motion-sensitive controllers,

17:42.620 --> 17:47.380
like the Wii controller and the flippy gyroscope

17:47.380 --> 17:51.300
crap dual-shock looking thing on the PlayStation 3.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.580
And he's actually saying that the average gamer,

17:53.580 --> 17:55.060
and I don't know if this is something

17:55.060 --> 17:56.300
that we should all be insulted by or not,

17:56.300 --> 17:57.720
because basically he's insinuating

17:57.720 --> 18:00.000
The average gamer is just like really lazy.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.320
He said, you know, who wants to move around a lot?

18:02.320 --> 18:04.720
Who can sit absolutely still?

18:04.720 --> 18:07.880
You know, who's going to have that kind of motor control

18:07.880 --> 18:11.360
to hold a controller out and be able to follow it

18:11.360 --> 18:13.240
without just wanting to set it down?

18:13.240 --> 18:15.920
So in fact, the quote in here is like, it's tough

18:15.920 --> 18:17.440
because sometimes you want to move the controller

18:17.440 --> 18:19.280
and you don't want to fly into the ground.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.600
You just want to put the controller down.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.600
People aren't that good at totally standing still.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.640
Even pilots actually sit in a chair

18:24.640 --> 18:25.760
when they do their flying.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.480
There's a lot to be learned about these controllers.

18:27.480 --> 18:31.240
pilots don't, you know, freaking play games while they're flying, I hope.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.720
Basically, he's going back to the future of video games is online gaming is mobile

18:35.720 --> 18:40.400
content. It's all the stuff his company is doing. Listen, we want you to sit

18:40.400 --> 18:43.920
down and play the game. Don't get up because that takes away from your game

18:43.920 --> 18:50.760
time. We've now put in in Halo we have, you know, slash pizza. But no, is also

18:50.760 --> 18:53.760
another interesting quote on here. This actually makes me think back on the

18:53.760 --> 19:00.600
origami over time you have to say you will carry in your pocket immediate

19:00.600 --> 19:04.720
device and a phone and a gaming device and say a tablet device for reading it's

19:04.720 --> 19:08.440
natural for them to be combined into one device do that thing is too big it'll

19:08.440 --> 19:14.720
never fit in a pocket it'll fit maybe like one of those Bible carriers all

19:14.720 --> 19:19.620
right that's his point of view all right some of us disagree Loki what else is

19:19.620 --> 19:20.940
Microsoft got in store?

19:20.940 --> 19:23.820
Well, they've got an Xbox Live update, and I'm going to do a

19:23.820 --> 19:27.900
brand new dashboard, including downloading in the background.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.120
So you can actually do other things while you're downloading

19:30.120 --> 19:34.300
demos or whatever other junk they have on there.

19:34.300 --> 19:37.700
Also, they're going to be adding, you can actually

19:37.700 --> 19:40.500
stream music and DVDs and stuff while you're downloading

19:40.500 --> 19:42.260
from the marketplace.

19:42.260 --> 19:45.060
Another thing they were saying, too, is that they're

19:45.060 --> 19:46.500
going to actually have it where it'll

19:46.500 --> 19:47.340
remember your place.

19:47.340 --> 19:49.660
Say, for example, you're playing a DVD and you pop it out

19:49.660 --> 19:54.140
and go back to a game and then go back to your DVD later,

19:54.140 --> 19:55.100
it'll actually know where it is.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.780
So, you know, that's great.

19:56.780 --> 19:57.620
My laptop does that.

19:57.620 --> 19:59.020
Sort of like my Mac does already.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.140
Yeah, that's nice.

20:03.140 --> 20:05.020
My laptop does that, my laptop's PC.

20:05.020 --> 20:06.860
All right, whatever.

20:06.860 --> 20:08.180
Hey, I love the Mac.

20:08.180 --> 20:10.340
I think these are things, you know,

20:10.340 --> 20:12.380
it would have been nice to see these a long time ago,

20:12.380 --> 20:13.760
but at the same time, you know,

20:13.760 --> 20:16.420
at least Microsoft recognizes that people wants this stuff,

20:16.420 --> 20:17.340
So they're putting it in.

20:17.340 --> 20:19.780
They're offering the downloadable upgrade.

20:19.780 --> 20:23.180
I think it's going to be pretty cool to just be able to

20:23.180 --> 20:25.140
download a lot of stuff and fill up my hard drive.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.100
Although my hard drive is pretty much already full,

20:27.100 --> 20:31.340
because Final Fantasy XI takes up like 25 things.

20:31.340 --> 20:34.380
So much room on there.

20:34.380 --> 20:36.700
Also, when there's something about fan content, are they

20:36.700 --> 20:39.940
going to be putting, I don't know, things that Microsoft

20:39.940 --> 20:41.780
likes that you're going to be able to download as well, like

20:41.780 --> 20:43.060
red versus blue episodes and stuff?

20:43.060 --> 20:44.340
They already do that.

20:44.340 --> 20:45.540
They already do that.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.340
I didn't know.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.940
You can actually go to redversusblue.com and download it too.

20:48.940 --> 20:50.740
Weren't they putting it in their own section or what?

20:50.740 --> 20:52.440
Yes, but you can't watch it on your HDTV with us.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.640
Well, they're going to better organize the content that's already on.

20:55.140 --> 20:55.940
Good, because live.

20:55.940 --> 20:57.240
Why don't you use up your laptop to your TV?

20:57.240 --> 20:59.340
They're also going to let your friends know when you're idle.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.940
And so, you know, when you're not playing a game or anything.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.440
Okay, so if people aren't sending you messages, hello, hello.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.140
You can speculate why you're idle.

21:07.240 --> 21:10.740
All right, moving on to the Wii.

21:11.540 --> 21:13.540
This was going around the internet this week that

21:13.540 --> 21:19.460
WiiKaraoke.com was registered on the internet by Nintendo and that kind of

21:19.460 --> 21:22.460
has all this rampant speculation going that oh my gosh the Wii is gonna have a

21:22.460 --> 21:25.900
karaoke game it's gonna be their answer to sing star, karaoke revolution all that

21:25.900 --> 21:29.240
stuff but also kind of interesting because that means that that controller

21:29.240 --> 21:32.500
not only has a speaker but has a microphone in it so that would be very

21:32.500 --> 21:36.300
interesting but they didn't stop there they registered a ton of other domain

21:36.300 --> 21:39.060
names I mean the list is huge it's just this big old list of domain names they

21:39.060 --> 21:46.480
registered we cooking.com we sports.com we fitness we family I'm sure we vc but

21:46.480 --> 21:52.200
that makes sense virtual console not not just we connect 24 calm we active 24 we

21:52.200 --> 21:56.840
animation maybe that's new Mario paint I don't know we alive 24 calm yep there's

21:56.840 --> 22:01.840
we fitness we puzzle and here we go we beauty calm but here's my favorite

22:01.840 --> 22:09.160
shall we dot-com I'm not making that up it's not Joe it's really there so those

22:09.160 --> 22:12.340
will all actually just forward you right on over to Nintendo site well one of the

22:12.340 --> 22:16.120
ones that they have on there there was speculation on this website mega games

22:16.120 --> 22:20.680
so they're saying that we channel calm might actually be kind of like a content

22:20.680 --> 22:26.800
channel that you can pick up through the we almost like their you know on TV

22:26.800 --> 22:30.400
stage as long as Comcast doesn't try to ruin it I'll be fine with that what was

22:30.400 --> 22:38.140
this we breeding dot-com what is this we breed we breeding sack okay I guess

22:38.140 --> 22:40.500
there might be some interesting features coming to the next well you know the

22:40.500 --> 22:44.800
Nintendo Wii controller is a very phallic device that's disgusting okay

22:44.800 --> 22:51.500
Loki back to Microsoft please quickly anyways gotta love when I lose my place

22:51.500 --> 22:56.180
that's so much fun does a Wii controller vibrate um yes it does actually the Wii

22:56.180 --> 22:59.460
controller does vibrate again I don't know why that would be important your

22:59.460 --> 23:03.020
Your wife just let out a cheer there.

23:03.020 --> 23:04.900
Finally I'll get a use out of the gaming systems.

23:04.900 --> 23:06.860
So rez for Wii, huh?

23:06.860 --> 23:08.220
Listen, okay.

23:08.220 --> 23:14.180
One thing that you will not find with the 360 is that price drop is not coming soon.

23:14.180 --> 23:18.740
Basically they've seen that the PS3 is going to be damn expensive and you know what?

23:18.740 --> 23:19.900
They don't have to change things.

23:19.900 --> 23:22.700
So you're going to be paying the same prices on stuff.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.700
Now I don't believe that, but we'll see.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.520
I think there will be a price cut come the next holidays.

23:28.520 --> 23:32.680
But I think Xbox was waiting to see what Sony was going to do when they announced the PlayStation

23:32.680 --> 23:33.680
3.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.160
And if PlayStation 3 had come out and said, hey, we're going to release our console for

23:36.160 --> 23:39.840
$399, then Xbox would have been backed in the corner and they would have had to cut

23:39.840 --> 23:40.840
it.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.880
Because Sony came out and said, hey, you're going to have to sell your first born to get

23:42.880 --> 23:43.880
our system.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.720
The original Xbox, though, will probably get price cut.

23:46.720 --> 23:47.720
So that's good.

23:47.720 --> 23:51.440
Well, the original Xboxes are on their way to a flea market near you.

23:51.440 --> 23:57.460
I mean, yeah, they're about to be extinct pretty soon.

23:57.460 --> 24:02.040
gonna be running there there's like no first party titles coming out is there

24:02.040 --> 24:06.700
I don't know all right anyway so when things don't get cut in price and we

24:06.700 --> 24:10.420
have to pay more money we get a little bit angsty so that takes us to one of

24:10.420 --> 24:17.580
our favorite segments called the F use of the week that's two people listen to

24:17.580 --> 24:22.740
the show all right now that got a risk my everybody knows that one all right

24:22.740 --> 24:27.300
dark soccer what's your F you the week my F you of the week goes to cosplay as

24:27.300 --> 24:33.940
in the preparation that goes into cosplay okay shut up damn I thought

24:33.940 --> 24:37.740
you're gonna make some people mad for a minute no no no no no no no okay I'm

24:37.740 --> 24:41.140
going to go into the whole scope of things that pissed me off about cosplay

24:41.140 --> 24:53.300
number one what I have a good prop as I was saying first of all it goes into the

24:53.300 --> 24:57.020
whole you know when you have finals week and there's an anime convention the week

24:57.020 --> 25:00.740
after finals when are you gonna have time to finish your costume you're gonna

25:00.740 --> 25:03.920
spend a whole week working on it sleep is for the week and shut up and then

25:03.920 --> 25:10.380
and then imagine having to sew and you buy you find good linen on sale nice

25:10.380 --> 25:15.980
black linen and three sewing machines break while doing it so you have to get

25:15.980 --> 25:20.260
someone to sew it about six hours before you're supposed to be at said convention

25:20.260 --> 25:24.900
and then having to deal with paint and having to deal with your cat walking all

25:24.900 --> 25:29.820
over your fan while you're painting it and your husband playing pinball while

25:29.820 --> 25:33.100
he's supposed to be holding down the other end for you and then let's get

25:33.100 --> 25:38.820
into the people who manfaid that's all I have to say there are some people who do

25:38.820 --> 25:45.100
not have the physical characteristics to carry off certain costumes you're

25:45.100 --> 25:50.300
picking a fight all right I think that there's such a thing as tasteful like if

25:50.300 --> 25:56.180
you are built like a freaking booth babe by all means show it off but you know if

25:56.180 --> 26:00.660
you're of an average build like you know in short like me you wear a kimono thank

26:00.660 --> 26:08.940
you. Loki, your FUs. My FU of the week, very themed for fanime, is the ugly

26:08.940 --> 26:14.820
chicks who dress up like hot anime chicks. Listen, if you're a seven, do not

26:14.820 --> 26:21.100
try to dress up like a ten, because nobody wants to see that. Nobody. Not

26:21.100 --> 26:28.100
anybody. So if you're not looking that hot, keep the clothes on. Thank you. Yeah,

26:28.100 --> 26:31.680
the same thing goes to guys the guys there's some really ugly guys out there

26:31.680 --> 26:37.980
dressing up like you know I don't know studly anime characters unacceptable I

26:37.980 --> 26:42.780
have no problem with cross play like if you are really really pretty guy you

26:42.780 --> 26:48.220
can't pull like like the antenna from a X three years ago I know a X gentleman

26:48.220 --> 26:55.260
please don't wear anything that might give you a uniball cuz damn and also

26:55.260 --> 27:00.720
please you know everybody loves the mainstream characters out there but my

27:00.720 --> 27:04.920
god how many vashes how many clouds how many Sephiroth's do you really need in

27:04.920 --> 27:09.840
the world how many how many people who has counted at least five Naruto in one

27:09.840 --> 27:15.000
room today everybody raises their hands you know I'm going to go ahead and

27:15.000 --> 27:20.260
explain the whole reason I cosplayed Tamari is again I had a week this is

27:20.260 --> 27:25.240
lazy cosplay this is cosplay in a week this makes for great radio by the way

27:25.240 --> 27:28.240
Anyway, moving on because we're getting pressed for time.

27:28.240 --> 27:32.240
That and all of my other costumes are too big for me because I made them when I was 80 pounds heavier.

27:32.240 --> 27:38.240
My F.U. of the week goes to my roommate Xtifer because he left out the Silent Hill 2 on the Xbox

27:38.240 --> 27:39.240
and it's all scratched up now.

27:39.240 --> 27:43.240
And if my Pyramid Head scene starts skipping, somebody's going to get an ass-kicking.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.240
You can borrow mine, Rob.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.240
Because Pyramid Head is a rock star.

27:45.240 --> 27:50.240
You can borrow mine because I've had your Silent Hill 4 for like three years before it was out.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.240
All right.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.240
Moving on, we've got to get to some more news because this, oh, this is so great.

27:54.240 --> 27:58.760
so great who doesn't who doesn't have memories of seeing the movie the wizard

27:58.760 --> 28:02.240
on the big screen well guess what you can relive those memories all over again

28:02.240 --> 28:09.200
the wizard is coming to DVD August 29th and of course Fred Savage it's so bad

28:09.200 --> 28:15.240
cute the Mario 3 previews later in that yes Christian Slater Christian Slater

28:15.240 --> 28:18.920
Slater's hold up in a hotel room and he gets addicted to Nintendo he's supposed

28:18.920 --> 28:22.200
to be looking for Fred Savage they never leave the hotel room but who see

28:22.200 --> 28:25.260
everybody always talks about the power glove and it's so bad but I think the

28:25.260 --> 28:28.500
best scene in that movie was the girl and when she tries to get the mobsters

28:28.500 --> 28:34.300
in trouble she yells out she goes he touched my breast that always makes me

28:34.300 --> 28:40.060
laugh huh all right Dark Sakura although we don't have anybody British in here I

28:40.060 --> 28:43.900
don't think we might have some folks listening so tell us if you've got Brit

28:43.900 --> 28:48.780
love here at a Japanese convention okay well that's all right we're doing the

28:48.780 --> 28:52.980
release dates anyway so what's coming out in Europe? On the second we have a

28:52.980 --> 28:57.060
whole bunch of stuff coming out we have Final Fantasy 4 on Game Boy Advance

28:57.060 --> 29:03.060
Nintendo of Europe. We have Half-Life 2 on PC. We have Pac-Man World 3 on PSP

29:03.060 --> 29:08.680
Super Monkey Ball Adventure. Is it this long? Okay. Tourist Trophy the real

29:08.680 --> 29:18.020
writing simulator. Yay. And we also have Zoo Tycoon 2 African Adventure. Africa, Africa.

29:18.020 --> 29:21.520
All right, Loki, do you have U.S. dates or you don't have any?

29:21.520 --> 29:26.520
Yeah, pretty much this week, not a whole lot, but definitely, you know, in the month of June,

29:26.520 --> 29:30.520
you've got Grand Theft Auto Liberty Stories on the PS2, finally.

29:30.520 --> 29:34.520
And I don't know, there's some mixed in stuff there.

29:34.520 --> 29:38.520
Not a whole lot of good games coming out in June.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.020
July is your month, though.

29:40.020 --> 29:43.020
July, you've got ChromeHounds, which is awesome.

29:43.020 --> 29:46.020
Naruto, Ultimate Ninja, if you're an anime fan.

29:46.020 --> 29:49.420
and also, man, I really wish Dead Rising was coming out

29:49.420 --> 29:51.020
in that month, but that's August.

29:51.020 --> 29:53.980
You know, I love how Dark Soccer always has her list

29:53.980 --> 29:55.840
very planned out, and then Loki's like,

29:55.840 --> 29:58.520
man, you know, there's a bunch of crap coming out this month

29:58.520 --> 29:59.360
and maybe a couple cool things.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.240
There is, honestly, I mean, are you,

30:01.240 --> 30:04.520
and seriously, is anyone gonna buy Cars the Game?

30:04.520 --> 30:07.460
Ooh, you, sir, are a loser!

30:07.460 --> 30:09.420
Woo!

30:09.420 --> 30:11.220
No, but anyways, Cars the Game,

30:11.220 --> 30:14.200
and one Street Ball's coming out this week, you know, eh.

30:14.200 --> 30:18.200
And but if you have the PSP, greatest collection.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.200
Hooray, games for the PSP.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.400
That is newsworthy.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.640
Are we going to jam through these last few stories here?

30:24.640 --> 30:27.600
Loki, a new game by Sony of an old franchise.

30:27.600 --> 30:32.000
Yes, coming to the UK, SingStar anthems, more crappy songs

30:32.000 --> 30:34.160
on another karaoke game.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.120
Yay.

30:35.120 --> 30:35.920
I like SingStar.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.800
That's actually one of the few games ever.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.500
Now wait a minute, isn't this supposed

30:39.500 --> 30:43.720
to be like the gay and women themed SingStar game?

30:43.720 --> 30:44.440
Wow.

30:44.440 --> 30:47.320
Because if you look at the list, it has We Are Family and

30:47.320 --> 30:48.200
Scissor Sisters.

30:48.200 --> 30:52.720
OK, we've got Queen, Radio Gaga, Cher, if I could turn

30:52.720 --> 30:54.400
back time, there you go, Cher.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.640
I mean, come on.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.780
The Steps, because the Steps are in every single music

30:57.780 --> 31:01.080
game in the UK, deeper shade of blue.

31:01.080 --> 31:05.040
You spin me right round, by Dead or Alive.

31:05.040 --> 31:08.720
Gloria Gaynor, I Will Survive, the Pussycat Dolls for some

31:08.720 --> 31:10.600
reason, don't you?

31:10.600 --> 31:12.320
LeAnn Rimes, Can't Fight the Moonlight.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.560
Charlotte Church.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.280
By the way, the minute this game comes out,

31:15.280 --> 31:16.680
we will have Loki live on the show,

31:16.680 --> 31:18.300
singing, don't ya, it'll be great.

31:18.300 --> 31:20.840
Never, it's vice applauding.

31:20.840 --> 31:25.120
All right, all right, anyway.

31:25.120 --> 31:29.080
Moving on, also, somewhat gay theme, this is interesting.

31:29.080 --> 31:32.740
Out Magazine, they actually had this, I don't know,

31:32.740 --> 31:35.280
best of list that was lately in their magazine,

31:35.280 --> 31:37.440
and they just named Link

31:37.440 --> 31:40.440
the hottest video game character in Out Magazine.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.100
When darkness enshrouds the land,

31:42.100 --> 31:42.940
this is a quote from the magazine,

31:42.940 --> 31:46.920
Darkness enshrouds the land Nintendo's sexy farm boy turned wolf sets out to

31:46.920 --> 31:53.100
save the day in this upcoming game his weapons a sword wink wink a bow arrows

31:53.100 --> 31:59.460
and kick-ass grooming skills I don't know you know that's the gayest thing

31:59.460 --> 32:07.140
I've ever look I I am a gay gamer myself and I don't get the big ear thing I why

32:07.140 --> 32:10.820
why is they must love big ears over it out magazine or something because I

32:10.820 --> 32:12.500
I don't find that very sexy, but I don't know.

32:12.500 --> 32:15.300
You know what they say about a guy's ears.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.780
He can hear really well.

32:17.780 --> 32:19.860
Exactly.

32:19.860 --> 32:20.660
Next, please.

32:20.660 --> 32:22.900
Loki, next, please.

32:22.900 --> 32:26.020
I think we talked about this before, the Wii microphone.

32:26.020 --> 32:27.060
Yeah, might have it.

32:27.060 --> 32:27.940
Great.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.860
If it's not actually in the controller, they do have that

32:29.860 --> 32:32.400
stupid port in the bottom that they could add one on.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.820
So yeah, microphone coming out for the Wii.

32:34.820 --> 32:35.980
Great.

32:35.980 --> 32:37.100
That's it.

32:37.100 --> 32:37.980
I thought there was another part out.

32:37.980 --> 32:39.440
What about voice over IP?

32:39.440 --> 32:43.440
Oh yeah, voice over IP, because they've already got that on the DS, so why not on the Wii?

32:43.440 --> 32:48.440
You know, because talking into a giant, you know, remote looking thing would be cool.

32:48.440 --> 32:53.440
You know, if they're trying to market this to, you know, mom and dad, that might be a feature that sells them on it.

32:53.440 --> 32:57.440
Wow, I wish I could talk into a retarded looking microphone thing.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.440
That'd be great! That's the only thing missing from my life.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.440
We like retarded microphone looking things, don't we?

33:03.440 --> 33:06.440
I know, we're talking into retarded looking microphones right now, I don't get...

33:06.440 --> 33:11.040
All right, Dark Sakura, another story here.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.360
Well, guess what, you know a game they don't like in Venezuela?

33:14.000 --> 33:15.020
Mercenaries 2.

33:15.020 --> 33:16.060
They have games in Venezuela?

33:16.060 --> 33:17.060
Yes.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.260
I'm sorry, we probably have listeners there.

33:18.260 --> 33:19.560
Sorry guys, just teasing, having fun.

33:19.560 --> 33:20.860
We love you in Venezuela.

33:20.860 --> 33:21.860
Love you guys.

33:21.860 --> 33:25.720
But your president is kind of being a little bit paranoid much.

33:26.440 --> 33:32.060
Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, thinks that Mercenaries 2 is an example

33:32.060 --> 33:35.860
of psychological warfare preparing everybody

33:35.940 --> 33:38.480
for a real invasion of Venezuela

33:38.480 --> 33:39.900
by the United States apparently.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.280
Yeah, we want their oil.

33:43.840 --> 33:47.420
It's true, we do want their oil, but basically,

33:47.420 --> 33:51.880
they're taking steps to have a certain video games now

33:51.880 --> 33:54.620
with that type of theme in mind banned in Venezuela.

33:54.980 --> 33:58.240
One of their lawmakers, Gabriela Ramirez, added,

33:58.240 --> 34:02.480
It sends a message to Americans, you have a danger next door here

34:02.480 --> 34:04.220
in Latin America and action must be taken.

34:04.220 --> 34:06.340
It's justification for imperialist aggression.

34:06.340 --> 34:07.820
That sounds like they're going to invade us.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.160
No, they, we don't have anything they want.

34:10.160 --> 34:11.700
We just have beer.

34:11.700 --> 34:12.400
People.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.000
We have bad beer and hot dogs.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.420
Blood spilling in the streets.

34:15.980 --> 34:18.700
And they don't have that there?

34:19.280 --> 34:20.720
They can get it in their backyard.

34:21.620 --> 34:25.820
But no, they're basically, there's a law proposing

34:25.820 --> 34:28.200
that they're trying to prevent

34:28.200 --> 34:30.280
violent video games in Venezuela now.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.500
It's all over the world.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.540
The infection has spread.

34:33.540 --> 34:34.380
All right.

34:34.380 --> 34:35.460
What we wanna do now,

34:35.460 --> 34:37.140
and I don't know how successful this is gonna be,

34:37.140 --> 34:39.140
but we wanna go ahead and open it up to you guys

34:39.140 --> 34:40.800
who might have questions for us.

34:40.800 --> 34:41.700
We're gonna do a little segment

34:41.700 --> 34:43.660
called Ask Orange Lounge in person.

34:43.660 --> 34:45.600
Can I move this microphone or I'm gonna get busted?

34:45.600 --> 34:46.740
You're gonna get in trouble.

34:46.740 --> 34:47.580
Now go ahead.

34:47.580 --> 34:48.660
Are the guys gone?

34:48.660 --> 34:49.500
Or no?

34:49.500 --> 34:50.340
We'll hold it out.

34:50.340 --> 34:52.940
If you guys wanna come and ask us a question.

34:52.940 --> 34:55.000
Does anybody wanna ask us a question about anything?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.320
All right, you, come on down.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.160
This guy should be interesting.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.400
What's your name, buddy?

34:58.400 --> 34:59.340
Jacob.

34:59.340 --> 35:01.180
All right, Jacob, what's your question?

35:01.180 --> 35:03.360
Why does Loki hate Apple?

35:03.360 --> 35:05.120
Loki, why do you hate Apple?

35:05.120 --> 35:06.640
I mean, where do I begin?

35:06.640 --> 35:10.160
Okay, listen, that computer, it may look pretty,

35:10.160 --> 35:11.480
but it does nothing.

35:11.480 --> 35:15.120
It gets you on the internet, and that's about it.

35:15.120 --> 35:19.800
But the Mac OS is such a nice operating system.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.760
It's nice if you wanna browse the internet.

35:22.760 --> 35:24.840
Video editing, video editing.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.720
You know what, a PC can do video editing just as well.

35:27.720 --> 35:28.280
Not really.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.280
Explain why things done in Photoshop on a Mac

35:30.280 --> 35:31.680
look better than they do on a PC.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.080
Mac is good for print.

35:33.080 --> 35:33.720
That is it.

35:33.720 --> 35:36.200
Print media only.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.720
Online web media does not matter.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.400
What about the lack of viruses?

35:40.400 --> 35:41.840
What about the lack of games?

35:41.840 --> 35:43.000
Oh!

35:43.000 --> 35:44.440
Who games on a Mac?

35:44.440 --> 35:47.320
Nobody, because a Mac can't game.

35:47.320 --> 35:48.960
World of Warcraft.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.240
Oh, wow.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.160
This is just where you guys, the Mac lovers.

35:53.160 --> 35:54.680
Look, I love Mac too, as you can see,

35:54.680 --> 35:56.520
but you're just not gonna change his mind.

35:56.520 --> 35:57.520
I'm sorry guys.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.480
All right, anybody else?

35:59.480 --> 36:00.320
Anybody?

36:00.320 --> 36:01.160
Ask us questions.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.000
Ask Orange Lounge,

36:02.000 --> 36:02.920
video game questions,

36:02.920 --> 36:03.760
these three stuff.

36:03.760 --> 36:04.580
We're sadistic.

36:04.580 --> 36:05.420
I think I see a dude getting up and back.

36:05.420 --> 36:07.000
I mean, we're masochistic, sorry.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.680
Come on down, you're the next contestant.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.280
Welcome.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.120
Woo!

36:11.120 --> 36:11.960
It's a big room.

36:11.960 --> 36:12.800
You win air.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.600
Your name, sir?

36:15.600 --> 36:16.420
Michael.

36:16.420 --> 36:17.880
And I see you're wearing a Squeenix shirt,

36:17.880 --> 36:18.720
that's awesome.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.120
What's your question for us, Michael?

36:20.120 --> 36:22.340
How many times do you think by the end of the year

36:22.340 --> 36:26.460
that the Blu-ray technology will crash because of various

36:26.460 --> 36:29.300
problems reading different, because the difference

36:29.300 --> 36:32.300
between reading a DVD semi-sequentially

36:32.300 --> 36:34.180
and maybe having to grab different things

36:34.180 --> 36:36.580
from all different parts of a game disc,

36:36.580 --> 36:39.020
I think is gonna be a big problem for the PS3.

36:39.020 --> 36:40.780
And I was wondering what you guys thought about that.

36:40.780 --> 36:42.820
Let me ask you a question as an answer.

36:42.820 --> 36:45.580
How many times does a person blink in a day?

36:45.580 --> 36:46.540
That's how often it will crash.

36:46.540 --> 36:47.580
A lot of them.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.180
That's why I'm not getting a PS3.

36:49.180 --> 36:51.660
I've been looking forward to it till I saw the price point

36:51.660 --> 36:53.180
and then saw what it was.

36:53.180 --> 36:53.900
It's like, no.

36:53.900 --> 36:56.060
Sony's press conference was depressing.

36:56.060 --> 36:58.700
I think Sony kind of just made a grave mistake

36:58.700 --> 37:01.060
in not putting the Blu-ray movies out there

37:01.060 --> 37:01.940
on the show floor.

37:01.940 --> 37:04.060
I think what they should have done is they should have

37:04.060 --> 37:07.020
on the show floor had, here's a Blu-ray movie playing

37:07.020 --> 37:08.660
next to a regular DVD.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.500
This is why you need to upgrade the Blu-ray.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.060
We've tried that before.

37:12.060 --> 37:13.660
Well, how many people in this room

37:13.660 --> 37:17.820
actually have an HDTV capable of that high resolution?

37:17.820 --> 37:20.020
That's about a half of the room.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.020
Third half.

37:21.020 --> 37:23.160
OK, but of course, we're all.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.780
Yeah, you all are nerds, so of course you have an HDTV.

37:25.780 --> 37:28.660
We're in here because we're gamers and anime fans, right?

37:28.660 --> 37:34.340
So we want to make them look pretty, but that's OK.

37:34.340 --> 37:36.220
That's awesome.

37:36.220 --> 37:39.820
But seriously, how many people though across the world

37:39.820 --> 37:42.680
in the areas that they're going to market the PS3 in,

37:42.680 --> 37:43.460
do you think are actually going to be

37:43.460 --> 37:47.020
able to take advantage of that level of technology?

37:47.020 --> 37:47.580
Japan, yeah.

37:47.580 --> 37:50.060
Could they be setting themselves up for the long run?

37:50.060 --> 37:51.780
Maybe it's not so much about launch day,

37:51.780 --> 37:54.980
but it's about what's going on a couple years in advance.

37:54.980 --> 37:58.960
And that might be a mistake given the Xbox 360 has been out

37:58.960 --> 38:00.380
a year already.

38:00.380 --> 38:02.380
I mean, I've already got a person

38:02.380 --> 38:05.260
who hates Microsoft gaming, but has already

38:05.260 --> 38:07.940
said that Microsoft may be making leaps and bounds

38:07.940 --> 38:09.860
towards somewhat evening the console

38:09.860 --> 38:11.820
wars between the two sides.

38:11.820 --> 38:13.500
That's what it sounded like to me.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.100
And even if Blu-ray doesn't take off,

38:15.100 --> 38:18.420
it's not like that's ever held Sony back with the fact

38:18.420 --> 38:23.500
that they've had a failed media format, mini disk, the UMDs,

38:23.500 --> 38:24.620
beta.

38:24.620 --> 38:25.780
I think Microsoft's learning.

38:25.780 --> 38:26.580
Hey, beta was good.

38:26.580 --> 38:29.380
I think Microsoft's learning from their lack of diversity

38:29.380 --> 38:30.300
on the first Xbox.

38:30.300 --> 38:31.960
At least if E3 is any showing, I think

38:31.960 --> 38:34.660
they're really finally starting to learn what the rest of us

38:34.660 --> 38:35.780
really want.

38:35.780 --> 38:36.540
So we'll see.

38:36.540 --> 38:38.660
Because I'll tell you, games like 99 Nights and stuff

38:38.660 --> 38:39.380
are pretty hot.

38:39.380 --> 38:41.300
Anyway, we got another question here.

38:41.300 --> 38:42.500
What's your name, sir?

38:42.500 --> 38:43.300
Willie.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.180
Willie, and Willie's got a DDR Freak shirt on.

38:45.180 --> 38:46.060
We got a lot of buddies over there.

38:46.060 --> 38:47.180
That's like one of the old school DDR Freak shirts.

38:47.180 --> 38:48.260
Willie, what's on your mind?

38:48.260 --> 38:52.140
Well, I did want to hear Loki read, but he got that taken care of.

38:52.140 --> 38:55.860
But I was wondering what you guys saw in the arcade here.

38:55.860 --> 38:57.020
I haven't checked it out yet.

38:57.020 --> 39:00.460
I actually got here about an hour before we had to get up here.

39:00.460 --> 39:02.060
Is there anything left at Miggle?

39:02.060 --> 39:06.220
Because it just looks like they moved Miggle over here, Milpitas, Oakland.

39:06.220 --> 39:08.340
On Campus Entertainment brought all this stuff over here.

39:08.340 --> 39:10.140
So what games are in there right now?

39:10.140 --> 39:16.700
They got DDR Extreme, Para Para, Initial D, and Wagon, and all that air hockey.

39:16.700 --> 39:18.980
OK, I am going to get my cards out and freaking play some

39:18.980 --> 39:21.100
long time midnight.

39:21.100 --> 39:23.060
I will challenge anybody in this room.

39:23.060 --> 39:23.780
You know what?

39:23.780 --> 39:25.820
They've got the right games for this crowd.

39:25.820 --> 39:26.260
They do.

39:26.260 --> 39:28.340
So they left.

39:28.340 --> 39:30.380
They really have enough room left for some

39:30.380 --> 39:31.700
actual go-kart racing.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.220
That's why I thought that the only thing was missing.

39:33.220 --> 39:35.340
That room over there is kind of empty.

39:35.340 --> 39:38.360
You could be doing Mario Kart live around the arcade.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.700
I mean, there's a lot of room over there.

39:39.700 --> 39:40.140
That's all right.

39:40.140 --> 39:41.340
We should get the people to cosplay the

39:41.340 --> 39:42.620
initial D cars again.

39:42.620 --> 39:43.580
And run around the room.

39:43.580 --> 39:44.900
This is the last question, guys, because we've got to

39:44.900 --> 39:45.260
wrap it up.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.460
We don't want to be rude to the next folks.

39:46.460 --> 39:52.620
your name sir Ricardo hi Ricardo what's your question aside from the idea of the

39:52.620 --> 39:56.620
new guitar hero arcade what new music game you guys think ought to come out

39:56.620 --> 40:04.060
you know that will get the crowd up and amped again I want I want sax mania

40:04.060 --> 40:09.860
clarinet freaks yeah we need more perhaps we need another in jammer Lamy

40:09.860 --> 40:15.020
that utilizes the guitar hero controller are you talking arcade you talking

40:15.020 --> 40:19.580
console he says okay that's a tough one because they I would like you know what

40:19.580 --> 40:23.380
I would like to see something new you know it needs to hop up and make me a

40:23.380 --> 40:29.140
universe Harrier any freaking bring planet Harrier out on some system or the

40:29.140 --> 40:33.960
other we need planet Harrier on the Wii that's what we need I would like to see

40:33.960 --> 40:37.020
something like frequency amplitude type stuff in the arcade I think that would

40:37.020 --> 40:40.540
be pretty hot because I like those games they're awesome and you know it's with

40:40.540 --> 40:44.220
with harmonics having that formula work so successfully now they've just

40:44.220 --> 40:47.760
attached a guitar to it they ought to go back and revisit the idea of doing one

40:47.760 --> 40:50.880
of their you know trancy techno type games so that's my answer I want to see

40:50.880 --> 40:55.620
like a frequency amplitude type thing in the air no technique was kind of lame

40:55.620 --> 40:59.520
all right that's it one more story one more quick story here and then we're

40:59.520 --> 41:05.460
gonna wrap it up Loki yes a perfect story to end on basically you know you

41:05.460 --> 41:10.120
know a company's got a really dumb idea when they come out with this co-masters

41:10.120 --> 41:13.120
They're coming out with a game called The Turds.

41:13.120 --> 41:16.120
That's right, you play crap.

41:16.120 --> 41:18.120
Excellent.

41:18.120 --> 41:21.120
What exactly are the turds, you might ask?

41:21.120 --> 41:23.120
Well, this is from the official website.

41:23.120 --> 41:26.120
Is this the sequel to Boonga Boonga or whatever that thing was called?

41:26.120 --> 41:27.120
I don't know.

41:27.120 --> 41:30.120
Anyways, here's from their official website, hopefully going to answer the question.

41:30.120 --> 41:35.120
On a winter's night in 2001, during a heavy drinking session at home amongst friends,

41:35.120 --> 41:40.880
I decided to stumble off to the toilet for what I was going to for what was going to be a good

41:41.880 --> 41:43.880
pantsplitting chunder mr.

41:45.400 --> 41:52.560
For some reason and don't ask why I brought a small lump of brown plasticine with me from our studio

41:52.700 --> 41:58.740
Whilst performing my toilet bowl opera and seeing my guts up for the toilet gods Hugh and Frank

41:58.740 --> 42:04.680
I just I managed to crush the plasticine into a pulp once I delivered the goods

42:04.680 --> 42:11.080
and that wonderful feeling of calm sank in, I found myself looking at the

42:11.080 --> 42:16.720
plasticine, I decided to take that pulp and create a turd with a face. As I

42:16.720 --> 42:23.160
played with my new friend on the side. This is why you don't drink that much.

42:23.160 --> 42:27.080
Put that person in a jacket and put them in the back of the van. Okay, I wanted to

42:27.080 --> 42:32.140
spike this person's beer with like antifreeze. It was that guy. Okay, as I

42:32.140 --> 42:36.100
played with my new friend on the side of the toilet seat I knew this was the

42:36.100 --> 42:39.540
start of something special okay I just wanna say Mac fans what I'm gonna do for

42:39.540 --> 42:42.540
you guys is we'll crop what he's saying right here so we'll have a little sound

42:42.540 --> 42:47.380
bite so you can download history was made that night the turd world was born

42:47.380 --> 42:53.060
it's just like I don't know what the hell so anyways I saw the pictures of

42:53.060 --> 42:59.580
the website it's like these giant turds with guns so you know what more power to

42:59.580 --> 43:03.800
Yeah, I mean if you really want to play a game that's crap there. Yeah, somebody just yelled it out

43:03.800 --> 43:07.920
It's like worms except it's with turds. Yes. It's the sequel ringworms

43:10.080 --> 43:12.080
And on that note

43:12.480 --> 43:16.460
What a good no, I you know, what a good note to end this show on a poop. Anyway, uh

43:17.240 --> 43:23.720
Very fitting don't you think let's go around and get everybody's final thought Dark Sakura reject false icons. Don't get a ps3

43:23.720 --> 43:29.600
