And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 183 for this May the 7th of 2006 for part B.

00:26.900 --> 00:30.900
Going to our podcast feed a little bit early this week to make way for the

00:30.900 --> 00:32.240
podcast we're going to be doing

00:32.240 --> 00:35.740
from the E3 Outpost Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Very excited about that.

00:35.740 --> 00:39.780
For more information, check out part A or check out our website orangelaunchrader.com

00:39.780 --> 00:43.660
or E3 on PSP.com, our brand new

00:43.660 --> 00:47.900
PSP site to bring the E3 experience to your PlayStation Portable.

00:47.900 --> 00:52.380
However, if you're a DS fan, you've got some really good news coming your way

00:52.380 --> 00:53.620
and that would be the

00:53.620 --> 00:59.320
new DS that's coming out right Dark Sakura? I like the DS Lite and I want one.

00:59.320 --> 01:04.780
I want one too it looks very sexy. But yeah we've got a release date for the US

01:04.780 --> 01:11.400
on this one. It's going to be released on June 11th for the price of $129.99.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.440
Only the white one is going to be out in the US to begin with although

01:15.440 --> 01:22.840
they've got three other colors in Japan. They're also going to be releasing on

01:22.840 --> 01:31.840
May 15th and use Super Mario Brothers so I'm gonna wait and see you know yeah

01:31.840 --> 01:37.320
it's the DS lite but I want to wait for more colors you know I like having a

01:37.320 --> 01:40.580
selection yeah you know there's gonna be more colors and honestly there's nothing

01:40.580 --> 01:45.200
wrong with the DS I have now fine you say that until you actually see one in

01:45.200 --> 01:48.760
action you're like holy crap I do you think in Nintendo's booth they'll have

01:48.760 --> 01:52.720
everything on the DS lite probably oh that might be interesting I'll be an

01:52.720 --> 01:58.160
interesting little like all their demo DS's or DS Lite's? One of my co-workers imported

01:58.160 --> 02:04.280
one and I swear it's the best thing I've ever seen. That all depends though because all

02:04.280 --> 02:10.720
their demos are going to be on dev kits anyways so... I guess that's true. We'll see. I don't

02:10.720 --> 02:15.600
think so. But it doesn't matter anyways remember because you can do the firmware hack to get

02:15.600 --> 02:20.200
the DS Lite brightness on the normal DS.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.780
True, we did mention that last week's show, but a lot of that was over my

02:23.780 --> 02:24.760
head. I'm not gonna

02:24.760 --> 02:29.040
hack my DS, because I'll break the damn thing. I don't know enough about it.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.320
Haxal? No, not that kind of hacking.

02:32.320 --> 02:36.080
Loki! A surprising sequel announcement this week.

02:36.080 --> 02:41.240
Yes, Sega announced actually full auto 2, and it's going to be exclusive for the

02:41.240 --> 02:42.480
PS3.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.720
kind of sucks for me but you know whatever I'm getting all systems anyways

02:45.720 --> 02:49.820
this time around they're finally going to put some sort of deathmatch mode in there

02:49.820 --> 02:51.680
it's going to be kind of arena themed

02:51.680 --> 02:54.840
I think I guess twisted metal

02:54.840 --> 02:59.280
and it looks pretty sweet I've seen there's actually pictures online now

02:59.280 --> 03:02.360
they've got three pictures on Xbox

03:02.360 --> 03:05.560
Oxide or whatever that site

03:05.560 --> 03:09.600
and it's sweet looking so I can't wait to

03:09.600 --> 03:13.440
you know, check that one out. You know what's interesting is a lot of the news

03:13.440 --> 03:16.960
sites where I saw that news on kind of took the opportunity to bash full auto

03:16.960 --> 03:20.080
one as being a bad game but I kind of enjoyed it, it was fun.

03:20.080 --> 03:25.440
I mean it's not the best thing ever. It had flaws but you know what, the second one will be better.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.400
Well isn't that usually the case with games? Usually.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.200
Not always, usually.

03:31.200 --> 03:35.920
All right, uh, Xbox Live is of course they had a big patch this week and

03:35.920 --> 03:39.200
assuming that they're gearing up for their big E3 showing

03:39.200 --> 03:44.600
They're going to have an awful lot of stuff coming up for E3, including demos and trailers

03:44.600 --> 03:51.480
for Test Drive Unlimited, MotoGP 06, Crackdown, Dead or Alive Xtreme 2, The Lord of the Rings

03:51.480 --> 03:57.700
The Battle for Middle Earth 2, Lost Planet, Sonic the Hedgehog, Splinter Cell Double Agent,

03:57.700 --> 03:59.480
and Viva Pinata.

03:59.480 --> 04:04.600
Also they're saying a flood of HD trailers from games that have yet to be announced.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.000
Maybe Halo 3?

04:07.000 --> 04:10.600
And also they're going to have HD trailers for movies as well.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.960
Not too much of a surprise there.

04:11.960 --> 04:17.100
I kind of wish the Xbox 360 front end was built a little more to handle a lot of stuff

04:17.100 --> 04:21.720
because scrolling through a big list is going to be annoying, I think, but that's just me.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.820
Unless they do like a page that's going to be all E3 stuff, but even still.

04:26.820 --> 04:31.280
Now remember, that doesn't necessarily mean they're all playable demos, just some of them.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.280
Demos, trailers, we don't know which.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.980
Lost Planet is going to be a demo.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.640
That's cool.

04:35.640 --> 04:39.920
And they're going to have, what was the other thing that they were going to have, I think

04:39.920 --> 04:43.160
the Top Spin 2 demo just came out.

04:43.160 --> 04:49.600
And World Cup Soccer was another one they were talking about releasing a demo for.

04:49.600 --> 04:55.040
I think it's going to be very interesting to see what sort of effect the Xbox Live integration

04:55.040 --> 04:56.040
of E3 is going to have.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.440
UNO is coming out.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.480
Oh I heard about that, UNO is coming out next week as part of a celebration for E3.

05:01.480 --> 05:07.840
But yet no Street Fighter II, still not out.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.520
Massive problems with that game, I hear.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.160
Interesting.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.160
Well fix em!

05:15.160 --> 05:16.160
Get that game out!

05:16.160 --> 05:17.400
Stop teasing us.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.800
Loki, something new coming out for the DS?

05:19.800 --> 05:25.640
Yes, Disney actually has a new exclusive title for the DS called Spectrobes.

05:25.640 --> 05:33.160
And you know, it's supposed to be infused with edgy, highly stylized look and feel of

05:33.160 --> 05:40.040
a Japanese anime or manga series with a unique original character sprite and a compelling

05:40.040 --> 05:42.400
storyline and breakthrough gameplay.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.400
Right.

05:43.400 --> 05:51.720
And it says, the game allows players to excavate and train in battle with nearly 500 unique

05:51.720 --> 05:53.480
characters.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.080
So it sounds kind of like, almost like a Pokemon game.

05:56.080 --> 06:02.280
They actually have a game coming out right now that's called, oh god, some stupid ass

06:02.280 --> 06:08.520
game where you dig up dinosaur bones and you re- basically like if Jurassic Park were to

06:08.520 --> 06:12.280
have sex with Pokemon, this is the game you would get.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.920
It's just weird.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.880
Uh, okay.

06:15.880 --> 06:20.160
I forgot, I brought out the emulators this week and I played Jurassic Park on the Super

06:20.160 --> 06:24.920
Nintendo because I wanted to show somebody the scary first-person mode

06:24.920 --> 06:31.240
which is really bad but anyway that game was fun I don't know so yeah it's gonna

06:31.240 --> 06:36.040
be coming out and probably at Buena Vista's booth this year all right

06:36.040 --> 06:41.000
Dark Sakura likes to travel the world from her computer because she loves you

06:41.000 --> 06:44.720
UK listeners as well as everybody you know it doesn't matter where you're at

06:44.720 --> 06:49.500
she loves you all but UK has a release calendar of their own the UK has a

06:49.500 --> 06:54.100
a release date calendar of their own and Dark Soccer would like to share some upcoming UK

06:54.100 --> 06:55.100
release dates.

06:55.100 --> 06:58.300
Yes, we have special things coming out.

06:58.300 --> 07:03.540
On the 12th we have City Life for PC, Dreamfall The Longest Journey, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary

07:03.540 --> 07:13.300
for PC, Pac-Man World 3, Sin Episodes Emergence, Time Shift Brain Age coming out on the DS

07:13.300 --> 07:14.300
on the 19th.

07:14.300 --> 07:18.580
A couple more things on the 19th, Fire Department 3.

07:18.580 --> 07:21.300
I thought that game was like massively delayed.

07:21.300 --> 07:25.380
Time Shift is apparently slated for PC and Xbox 360 on the 12th.

07:25.380 --> 07:28.460
And Pac-Man World 3 on PSP on the 19th.

07:28.460 --> 07:32.320
It was originally supposed to be on the 12th, but the problem was is it got

07:32.320 --> 07:34.980
put under a different, it's actually

07:34.980 --> 07:38.700
VinVidi Universal releasing it, or I'm sorry, VinVidi

07:38.700 --> 07:43.100
that's releasing it now instead of Atari.

07:43.100 --> 07:46.540
Perhaps the calendars weren't updated, who knows, we'll see. I would actually like to hear

07:46.540 --> 07:49.480
from our UK listeners let me know how the rainbow islands revolution turned

07:49.480 --> 07:54.920
out it was released on the fifth so um is that's not that was Friday so if

07:54.920 --> 07:57.220
anyone picked it up let me know what you think about it I'd love to hear your

07:57.220 --> 08:05.320
review because I haven't I'm curious about it too that's it okay not a lot

08:05.320 --> 08:08.760
sorry I think I don't think a whole bunch is gonna come out during e3 no no

08:08.760 --> 08:12.720
obviously not but I thought Loki humor us anyway is there anything coming out

08:12.720 --> 08:18.120
Coming out for the U.S. There's just jack shit coming out for the U.S. No, the only

08:18.120 --> 08:22.880
real game that's coming out is Over the Hedge and that's coming out on most systems. You

08:22.880 --> 08:31.080
do have the, was it the Guitar Hero SG controller coming out which is I guess kind of interesting.

08:31.080 --> 08:39.360
On, what was it, I believe Gallop Racer was coming out, oh wait that might have been last

08:39.360 --> 08:44.480
week. There really isn't anything this week. This week was pretty much a throwaway week.

08:44.480 --> 08:52.480
Well yeah, not too surprising. NBA Ballers Rebound was coming out. Was it Dark Soccer's

08:52.480 --> 08:57.280
Night Warriors Alpha? The UMD release of it is coming out, which by the way our company

08:57.280 --> 09:06.720
has exclusive rights to. And Tringo on the Game Boy Advance is coming out, so yeah. Save

09:06.720 --> 09:09.520
I gave all your mining for next week, that's what I say.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.520
Alright.

09:10.520 --> 09:16.760
Loki, as games are coming out for the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360, developers have some surprising

09:16.760 --> 09:18.400
news and rumors with these systems.

09:18.400 --> 09:25.000
Well, I'm not too surprised by it, but the developers of Chronicles of Riddick, Butcher's

09:25.000 --> 09:29.440
Bay a while back, they're working on a game right now called The Darkness, for both the

09:29.440 --> 09:35.480
360 and PS3, and what they've basically commented on is that they said the PS3 will have a content

09:35.480 --> 09:42.840
size and CPU advantage, the Xbox 360 has a slight GPU advantage, but basically they expect

09:42.840 --> 09:51.120
that the screenshots will be impossible to tell the 360 from the PS3 apart. So, it's

09:51.120 --> 09:54.960
gonna be like, I remember how they used to do that in GamePro where they'd have screenshots

09:54.960 --> 09:59.740
of the Super Nintendo and Genesis versions, so we'll hopefully start seeing that again.

09:59.740 --> 10:04.220
I think that, personally I think though, that we're going to see differences.

10:04.220 --> 10:08.180
I think the PS3 is going to end up being better.

10:08.180 --> 10:11.500
Oh, well that's, we'll see this week,

10:11.500 --> 10:16.540
hopefully, hopefully. It's all how you, I've seen a lot of stuff, I mean look at God of War

10:16.540 --> 10:20.020
on the PlayStation 2, you can really, you know, push out a lot of

10:20.020 --> 10:26.220
graphics and quality in some of these systems, you just have to know how to program for them, so.

10:26.220 --> 10:28.900
I don't think we've seen the best of Xbox 360 yet either.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.900
Long shot, so we'll see

10:31.800 --> 10:35.000
You may not have seen the best of the PSP or the DS yet as well

10:35.000 --> 10:39.680
There are rumors abounding that Vonage, you know that broadband phone company

10:40.240 --> 10:44.080
Vonage is apparently making software that is going to allow

10:44.440 --> 10:49.680
PSP and DS users to turn those handheld systems into VOIP phones

10:50.160 --> 10:51.600
Now if you think about it

10:51.600 --> 10:57.680
That means your handheld would basically be a phone that you could use anywhere that there's Wi-Fi like an engage first

10:57.680 --> 11:04.320
We had the taco and now we have the quesadilla and what is the DS a clam? I think quesadilla

11:04.320 --> 11:08.680
I like I was sticking with the Mexican food reference. It's a clam. I still think it's a taco

11:08.680 --> 11:10.680
I mean you kind of like put it back together

11:10.920 --> 11:15.160
Doesn't matter. Anyways, the engage isn't finished. All the engage will rule the world

11:16.280 --> 11:22.360
Say yeah, and I'll be fine. No, I think I think engage should be the first booth that we do a video

11:22.360 --> 11:27.060
presentation from for the E3 on PSP site. We should totally do like in Wayne's World.

11:27.060 --> 11:31.260
Hi, we're at the N-Gage booth. No, you know what? We're making Bobby cover

11:31.260 --> 11:35.940
N-Gage. I'll cover the N-Gage booth. I want to find

11:35.940 --> 11:42.260
out what is so wonderful about this. And, you know, it's basically we're just going

11:42.260 --> 11:47.460
to ask them the questions. Why should I buy an N-Gage? Because cell phone games rock?

11:47.460 --> 11:50.820
No, I'm sorry, that's not the correct answer. Why should I buy an N-Gage?

11:50.820 --> 11:54.460
cuz you like tacos oh my god you're a lover is so corny

11:54.460 --> 11:57.940
now why should we but oh sorry be over IPS p

11:57.940 --> 12:03.100
go her

12:03.100 --> 12:06.060
where we're doesn't matter anyways they're gonna be doing it that was one

12:06.060 --> 12:08.580
the attachments that they're gonna be adding to the PSP

12:08.580 --> 12:11.780
so that's not really a surprise no but you know Vonage

12:11.780 --> 12:13.940
probably wants a piece of that cuz they're still I don't know if they're

12:13.940 --> 12:15.420
struggling but they're still trying to

12:15.420 --> 12:19.020
really get out there and be a major player so yeah this could be huge for

12:19.020 --> 12:20.000
most it all

12:20.000 --> 12:23.860
you know what they need to do? They need to be pushing Wi-Fi all over the

12:23.860 --> 12:25.340
United States then because

12:25.340 --> 12:29.740
you know I can tell you right now walking around I can't find that many

12:29.740 --> 12:34.220
hot spots. Santa Clara though, they got free Wi-Fi everywhere that's

12:34.220 --> 12:38.340
awesome. That's pretty cool. It's covered the entire city. Rumor is that's supposed to

12:38.340 --> 12:39.260
happen in

12:39.260 --> 12:42.580
one of our suburbs, Roseville. We'll see.

12:42.580 --> 12:47.780
Alright, let's go to another story, Loki.

12:47.780 --> 12:51.300
Another interesting game to be shown at E3. Cooking Mama.

12:51.300 --> 12:55.280
It's actually going to be part of Majesco's lineup at E3.

12:55.280 --> 13:00.780
And this game is basically based on the kind of the minigame niche

13:00.780 --> 13:06.860
out there and you're basically cooking entrees and stuff using the DS.

13:06.860 --> 13:10.100
And I think that's kinda cool. Probably see something like that on the Wii.

13:10.100 --> 13:13.660
There's a ticket game like that. Where you flip the egg.

13:13.660 --> 13:17.540
You know, and I honestly I don't like reading all these stories about food

13:17.540 --> 13:25.240
because I'm so hungry right now mmm bacon looking forward to eating tomorrow

13:25.240 --> 13:30.860
I had an organic mushroom and leek strudel today I like mushrooms they're

13:30.860 --> 13:35.980
really tasty mmm let's play what did you eat today I we went to Red Robin and I

13:35.980 --> 13:41.060
had a bacon or no I didn't have a I had a Western Western barbecue burger it was

13:41.060 --> 13:47.940
very good. You kind of were. I ate the barbecue burgers, but I had leftover... You can't make

13:47.940 --> 13:53.280
one of those in Cooking Mama. Alright, anyway. Cooking Mama. Moving on, since somebody brought

13:53.280 --> 13:57.020
up the end gauge earlier... I was going to mention though, real quick. What? Real quick.

13:57.020 --> 14:02.280
Do you notice, it is Cooking Mama, because, you know, women in the kitchen... In the kitchen.

14:02.280 --> 14:07.280
You know what? Explain, you know, freakin' Emeril, okay?

14:07.280 --> 14:11.280
Woman in disguise. He's crazy.

14:11.280 --> 14:15.280
What about the galloping gourmet? Woman in disguise. Iron Chef.

14:15.280 --> 14:19.280
Women in disguise. No, no, no, no, no. They have a woman in Iron Chef, but she's more of a man.

14:19.280 --> 14:23.280
She's vowed to show that she's a woman in cooking.

14:23.280 --> 14:30.280
We're gonna get hate, man. I, I, okay, I like, this is, this is me as estrogen ambassador, okay?

14:30.280 --> 14:35.720
Like to cook however, I don't I make my husband make me dinner

14:36.840 --> 14:42.200
Woman in disguise. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

14:43.080 --> 14:45.600
He knows his place. All right anyway

14:47.040 --> 14:52.860
Moving on we were talking about the engage. I thought this was hilarious. Joystick ran an article this week

14:53.120 --> 14:57.880
It says mobile market shows signs of stagnation and what was my reaction a

14:57.880 --> 15:02.360
You know why?

15:02.360 --> 15:06.320
Here, I don't even have to read the article because mobile games are not that great.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.800
I'm sorry, they're just not that fun.

15:09.800 --> 15:13.360
They're really not that fun and I feel bad because I know people that develop

15:13.360 --> 15:16.560
for like mobile games and stuff and I know they're trying very hard at what

15:16.560 --> 15:17.400
they do and everything

15:17.400 --> 15:22.680
but I guess they just are catered for a certain market that's not me.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.640
Mobile gaming? Because as a hardcore gamer I really don't like mobile games.

15:25.640 --> 15:29.760
Mobile gaming is about as cool as talking on one of the cell phones from

15:29.760 --> 15:30.860
the eighties

15:30.860 --> 15:33.460
today.

15:33.460 --> 15:37.800
Well anyway, here's the actual chunk of the story here. A research firm

15:37.800 --> 15:43.400
Mmetrix published data in March 2006 from a mobile gamer's perspective.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.240
They're saying that the number of mobile gamers is remaining constant month on

15:47.240 --> 15:47.740
month

15:47.740 --> 15:50.820
with only a tiny fraction of mobile users.

15:50.820 --> 15:54.260
0.5 percent downloading their first game in March.

15:54.260 --> 15:57.980
The percentage of phone users who use their handset for downloadable games is low.

15:57.980 --> 16:01.980
The US 2.7%.

16:01.980 --> 16:05.740
Now given the millions and millions of mobile phones in the market, that's still a lot of

16:05.740 --> 16:10.460
people and many of them are repeat customers, but there's really not a lot of reasons to

16:10.460 --> 16:15.500
buy new titles and they're not exactly cheap and it kind of puts people off.

16:15.500 --> 16:19.980
Well, it's just like spending five dollars on a game that actually a flash game would

16:19.980 --> 16:20.980
be better than.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.740
mean it's just imagine trying to go out there and sell like games made from

16:25.740 --> 16:33.180
basic for like $10 a pop and so maybe the mobile game community will prove us

16:33.180 --> 16:37.980
wrong with a real bang up title we all have to own but I'm not holding my

16:37.980 --> 16:46.580
breath sorry yeah all right moving on Loki what's not gonna be at e3

16:46.580 --> 16:50.380
Diablo 3, not at E3.

16:50.380 --> 16:54.040
People started to think that it might actually be at E3 because there is an

16:54.040 --> 16:56.740
advertisement on IGN, of course.

16:56.740 --> 17:02.380
Someone accidentally let that slip through there in their editing department.

17:02.380 --> 17:04.040
High hopes.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.900
Not at E3, huh? That makes me sad.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.380
That makes me very angry, and you know what happens when people get angry?

17:10.380 --> 17:12.440
They turn into the Hulk?

17:12.440 --> 17:15.580
No, it's time for the FUs of the week.

17:15.580 --> 17:18.600
that's where dark sakura turns into the she-hulk

17:18.600 --> 17:22.740
no no no i am not a green skin tall attorney

17:22.740 --> 17:29.740
thank you

17:35.580 --> 17:37.480
my f u of the day

17:37.480 --> 17:39.720
goes towards this stupid kid

17:39.720 --> 17:41.120
and a mustang

17:41.120 --> 17:45.340
now i love the mustang i love old mustangs especially i like the very new ones

17:45.340 --> 17:50.640
This guy's was like a dirty convertible one. He was like probably 16 really stupid had like some blonde

17:51.980 --> 17:53.860
stupid looking girl with him and

17:53.860 --> 18:00.480
I am I will tell you where it is if anyone in this area will know it was as I was going

18:00.780 --> 18:03.560
From downtown. I had just passed the

18:04.080 --> 18:07.860
Where the Elkhorn entrance onto the freeway goes right before antelope

18:08.500 --> 18:12.700
You have that long ass merging lane. I mean, this is a really long merging lane

18:12.700 --> 18:17.780
so I was well ahead of the guy and then he starts beating up trying to nose in

18:17.780 --> 18:25.900
front of me and I'm already going 80 okay I mean 65 miles an hour 80 and so

18:25.900 --> 18:29.820
finally he still keeps going and I'm blowing on my horn and finally I had to

18:29.820 --> 18:36.460
just drop back and honk at him so he cut over to the other lane and I you know

18:36.460 --> 18:42.580
freaking told him off and then cut him off so uh that was my a few of the

18:42.580 --> 18:45.500
to stupid children who don't know how to drive.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.500
Loki.

18:46.500 --> 18:52.900
Um, fuck you to the stupid DJ who, like, screwed everything up from playing wrong music to

18:52.900 --> 18:57.500
playing music we didn't want him to play, to playing, you know, doing the electric slide

18:57.500 --> 19:04.420
which we said we didn't want him to do, to tuning his inflatable electric guitar while

19:04.420 --> 19:11.460
he was playing the wrong music, to getting my name wrong, to just being a complete dumbass

19:11.460 --> 19:17.340
and jackass. If you ever are looking for a DJ and you happen to be in the Sacramento

19:17.340 --> 19:23.820
area, stay away from hot tracks. Horrible. By the way, he has some weird relationship

19:23.820 --> 19:29.700
with his sister whose name is Tink. Cuckoo! Crazy! Yeah. I send those cards and letters

19:29.700 --> 19:33.700
to Loki. Do views and opinions expressed by Loki do not necessarily reflect those of the

19:33.700 --> 19:39.460
staff? Oh come on, you agree, he was a retard. Uh, I did not enjoy myself as much as I could

19:39.460 --> 19:45.380
have. Let's put it that way. Dan kept cracking jokes about it. He offered money to anyone

19:45.380 --> 19:49.260
who would go over and grab his inflatable guitar and beat him over the head with it.

19:49.260 --> 19:54.440
But your wedding was still great. Yes it was. We were even talking about this on the way

19:54.440 --> 19:59.920
home. I'm sorry we had to leave early because you know about Dan's knee. No. Dan got run

19:59.920 --> 20:03.060
over when he was younger and basically had his knee put back on so it hurts him all the

20:03.060 --> 20:08.580
time and it was hurting him really bad so we had to go home. I thought I told you. Anyway.

20:08.580 --> 20:13.580
Now all our millions of listeners know now too.

20:13.580 --> 20:20.260
We were talking about how we really enjoyed the ceremony, it was very nice.

20:20.260 --> 20:25.400
We thought it was especially cool that you had the tradition pulled in that the family

20:25.400 --> 20:28.740
wanted but were able to do everything themselves.

20:28.740 --> 20:31.420
I just like seeing Dan and Iamaka.

20:31.420 --> 20:34.400
That was hilarious.

20:34.400 --> 20:42.480
My FU of the Week goes to FlightDelays, Miklotov, any FUs of the Week?

20:42.480 --> 20:49.600
FU to the whole state of Hawaii, hate you all, hope you burn, maybe Japan will get lucky

20:49.600 --> 20:53.400
one of these days and actually hit you correctly with a bomb.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.400
Wow!

20:54.400 --> 21:00.200
He addressed those cards and letters to Miklotov, just asked for him by name in the forums.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.120
You don't have an orange card on your sheet mail do you?

21:02.120 --> 21:03.120
Oh no, do I?

21:03.120 --> 21:07.120
We'll give out your email address for all those Hawaiians that we haven't listened to this show, which I'm sure this is new.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.120
Send it to the mailbag and I'll forward it all.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.120
Yeah, just send it to mailbag and uh...

21:09.120 --> 21:13.120
Hopefully by the time they hear this, the bomb is hitting their house.

21:13.120 --> 21:18.120
Or the volcano's erupting. Those dirty, dirty, baby-eating savages.

21:20.120 --> 21:26.120
Dr. Sakura, please take us away with an actual relating-to-the-news-type story. That would be wonderful.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.120
We do news here?

21:29.120 --> 21:31.120
Once in a while we are known to do that.

21:31.120 --> 21:35.120
What do we do that for?

21:35.120 --> 21:39.120
Can we drop the Wii controllers on her now?

21:39.120 --> 21:43.120
Okay, well I do have a little bit of news.

21:43.120 --> 21:47.120
Basically, Konami is doing the big pitch

21:47.120 --> 21:51.120
for the DDR for school.

21:51.120 --> 21:55.120
So like, because they were so successful in West, what was it, West Virginia or wherever?

21:55.120 --> 21:59.120
So what, they're trying to sell all the other states now on this?

21:59.120 --> 22:11.920
public school curriculum. Don't look at me like that. I got an F in DDR. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Keep in mind they've done this has been done at other

22:11.920 --> 22:17.880
schools with a very high success rate. A lot of people have actually gotten in

22:17.880 --> 22:23.640
better shape and lost weight through playing DDR. I at first you know

22:23.640 --> 22:28.920
because I moved out here got happy you know got really fat and then started

22:28.920 --> 22:33.120
playing DDR and dropped 20 pounds over a summer so I can vouch for personal

22:33.120 --> 22:38.160
experience you know but um I think it's a really good thing although I do like

22:38.160 --> 22:41.720
the little comment from here talking about looking for all the YouTube and

22:41.720 --> 22:49.040
Google videos about their classmates playing DDR Oh God Wow comedy I still

22:49.040 --> 22:54.680
can't wait for you to come home I got an F in DDR yeah you don't hear them

22:54.680 --> 22:59.800
pitching in the groove to the schools yeah what you mean they got an E in DDR

22:59.800 --> 23:07.700
why aren't we failed you should practice in a closet I think my PE

23:07.700 --> 23:12.920
teacher should be the nurse from solo 2000 oh she's so amazing I can't stand

23:12.920 --> 23:20.180
it I want to marry her all right so check that out in a classroom near you

23:20.180 --> 23:24.260
if Konami gets their way I'm glad I'm in college hmm why would Konami want that

23:24.260 --> 23:29.900
to be in every classroom. Oh yeah, money. Yeah. Loki! Something else that we hope is

23:29.900 --> 23:34.800
gonna make money, or somebody's hoping makes money. Alone in the Dark, but not the movie.

23:34.800 --> 23:41.000
Not the movie. They're talking about possibly, was it Eden Games? They've decided to adopt

23:41.000 --> 23:48.240
an episodic format for its next gen sequel to Alone in the Dark. And it's gonna be chopped

23:48.240 --> 23:53.620
down. The episodes each contain about 30-40 minutes of gameplay that ends with a cliffhanger

23:53.620 --> 23:57.300
and preview of things to come. Wow.

23:57.300 --> 24:01.460
Yeah, I've never been so, eh, in my life.

24:01.460 --> 24:04.980
Sounds like Shenmue except somehow worse.

24:04.980 --> 24:08.580
I think it sounds interesting. I like the idea of an episodic- It sounds okay but how

24:08.580 --> 24:10.340
expensive is this

24:10.340 --> 24:15.300
gonna be? I mean- You said 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay? 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay

24:15.300 --> 24:19.700
each episode. Each episode would probably be about five bucks on Xbox Live or something like that.

24:19.700 --> 24:23.780
about think about people who buy like DVD shows you know and that's the same

24:23.780 --> 24:26.540
type of thing you watch a couple episodes you take a break come back

24:26.540 --> 24:32.460
people watch 24 on DVD that's what save points were invented for you know I

24:32.460 --> 24:38.180
don't get it and neither does even good I think it's an interesting idea if done

24:38.180 --> 24:42.680
right it might be neat it's under $10 an episode thing then that's okay but well

24:42.680 --> 24:46.580
if the game's good I mean it depends on good the game is I don't pay $10 for 30

24:46.580 --> 24:51.980
minutes of gameplay this shit better be like two bucks even less nine is like I

24:51.980 --> 24:56.660
to iTunes charges about 99 for a 40-minute TV show how about I like a

24:56.660 --> 25:01.540
buck 99 should be the price we'll see though how about the game not suck first

25:01.540 --> 25:06.140
and let's just figure out you know all right we're gonna run down some lineups

25:06.140 --> 25:10.860
that are gonna be at e3 some things that were announced this week Loki THQ yes

25:10.860 --> 25:14.660
THQ we mentioned them a little bit earlier they're gonna be having Saints

25:14.660 --> 25:18.660
It's Rho, which is going to be pretty sweet, and I hear that may be a demo coming to Xbox

25:18.660 --> 25:19.660
Live.

25:19.660 --> 25:26.340
Frontline's Fuel Award, which is coming out of the 360, PS3, and for PC.

25:26.340 --> 25:30.780
Smackdown vs. Raw 07, and I know that's going to be there, because actually I think some

25:30.780 --> 25:33.940
of the wrestlers are going to be there as well promoting it.

25:33.940 --> 25:39.280
PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, and PSP, notice no Xbox.

25:39.280 --> 25:45.160

26:13.240 --> 26:18.520
is coming out later on in the year, probably around November, and PC and Mac.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.920
Destroy All Humans 2, which looks sweet, and that's actually going to be on current gen

26:21.920 --> 26:28.440
PlayStation 2 and Xbox, SpongeBob SquarePants Creature from the Krusty Krab, which is going

26:28.440 --> 26:35.720
to be on PlayStation 2, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PC, DS, and the Wii, Monster House,

26:35.720 --> 26:39.900

also another animated movie, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Game Boy Advance PC, Juice Eliminator

26:51.740 --> 26:57.740

27:19.920 --> 27:25.760
just for the Xbox 360, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic for you PC gamers, Brothers in Arms

27:25.760 --> 27:31.800
Hell's Highway on the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360, and Assassin's Creed on the PlayStation 3

27:31.800 --> 27:37.640
Xbox 360. Also, Ubisoft is supposed to do some type of next-gen and PC game from the

27:37.640 --> 27:41.320
folks who did TimeSplitters, but not a lot of more details.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.240
Oh, but TimeSplitters 4.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.320
We'll see.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.000
TimeSplitters is fucking awesome.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.360
We'll see. And of course, a big, big name every year,

27:49.360 --> 27:50.360
Logie.

27:50.360 --> 27:56.480
EA. They're going to be showing off Army of Two for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360, Battlefield

27:56.480 --> 28:03.560
2142 for the PC, Command & Conquer 3, Tiberian Wars on the PC, Crysis on the PC, which is

28:16.780 --> 28:23.560
Cube, Playstation 2, Playstation 3, PSP, the Wii, the Xbox, and the Xbox 360, I think that

28:23.560 --> 28:31.560
about covers everything except for PC on there, NASCAR 2007 on the PSP, Orcs and Elves on

28:31.560 --> 28:36.480
mobile games, Spore for the PC and I think that's actually on the portable systems too

28:36.480 --> 28:40.420
but I'm not sure if they're going to show them, Superman Returns which got delayed to

28:40.420 --> 28:45.240
September that coincided with the DVD release, that's going to be on almost every single

28:45.240 --> 28:50.880
system, only next gen system though is going to be the 360 and no GameCube for that, and

28:50.880 --> 28:56.520
other sports titles are going to be, you know, patched over to the mobile games as well.

28:56.520 --> 29:00.280
I know the Wii Madden is supposed to be pretty neat. They're going to have kicking drills

29:00.280 --> 29:04.280
and passing drills and stuff like that, so it should be pretty cool.

29:04.280 --> 29:11.280
All right. I thought we could have a little bit of a roundtable here. Top three things

29:12.520 --> 29:17.360
we are looking forward to at E3 besides the Wii and the PlayStation 3. Those are the easy

29:17.360 --> 29:25.800
answers. Anybody want to go first? Anybody? Alright, Mikl Tov. Lumines2 for the PSP. Is

29:25.800 --> 29:32.040
that your number one? No. Okay, you're number three? Excuse me, 321. Yeah, well, can't we,

29:32.040 --> 29:38.720
can I have time to think about my two-in-one? Loki. I'm actually kind of excited about seeing,

29:38.720 --> 29:43.600
well, I was hoping to see Take-Two's lineup this year because I would have been looking

29:43.600 --> 29:51.400
forward to seeing Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories, but assuming I probably won't see

29:51.400 --> 29:59.300
that, I guess the next best thing would probably be seeing a Wii version of WarioWare, because

29:59.300 --> 30:00.300
that looks like fun.

30:00.300 --> 30:04.760
Which, as I understand, someone in chat just told me that it has been confirmed by Time

30:04.760 --> 30:05.760
Magazine.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.760
Yeah, Time Magazine story.

30:06.760 --> 30:09.920
That and some type of tennis game should be interesting.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.180
Doc Sakura.

30:11.180 --> 30:14.180
taking a nap under Squeenix's movie theater?

30:14.180 --> 30:17.180
I'm serious!

30:17.180 --> 30:20.900
My number three would be the DDRs.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.820
There's so many of them that I'm very curious to see what's going to happen there.

30:23.820 --> 30:25.940
Assuming we're right, but we are.

30:25.940 --> 30:28.340
Miggletop, number two.

30:28.340 --> 30:33.180
My number two would be Luminous for PS2.

30:33.180 --> 30:39.540
Loki, Ridge Racer 7 for the PS3.

30:39.540 --> 30:40.540
Very interested to see that.

30:40.540 --> 30:44.180
Good pick. Dark Sakura. Konami. Just everything.

30:44.180 --> 30:47.180
Yeah I'm just gonna you know I'm probably gonna find somewhere I can

30:47.180 --> 30:47.980
sleep over there too.

30:47.980 --> 30:51.020
Okay. Like in one of those little things at the door

30:51.020 --> 30:55.580
I just call in and take a nap. Sounds good. My number two would be

30:55.580 --> 30:59.180
Final Fantasy 13. I'm still kinda hoping that some hints are dropped with that.

30:59.180 --> 31:00.300
I'm gonna see that. Squeenix.

31:00.300 --> 31:04.380
I want it. You know Squeenix gotta have some type of surprise.

31:04.380 --> 31:09.340
Cuz their list was not that. They had seven remakes. Chrono Trigger 3.

31:09.340 --> 31:14.940
before crisis core and uh... you think the seven remakes seven remake uh...

31:14.940 --> 31:16.220
crisis core

31:16.220 --> 31:17.740
the uh...

31:17.740 --> 31:22.140
what the fuck is that stupid one that's on cell phones right now uh... before crisis

31:22.140 --> 31:23.740
before crisis

31:23.740 --> 31:25.660
it's going to be ported to the psp

31:25.660 --> 31:27.940
uh... indurgiservice

31:27.940 --> 31:31.580
indurgiservice is coming out next month or not next month uh... two months from now

31:31.580 --> 31:33.280
july so

31:33.280 --> 31:36.460
course it's already out in japan

31:36.460 --> 31:38.940
number ones

31:38.940 --> 31:43.380
Something at Konami that I can't say, I'm sorry, but I will be there a lot for it.

31:43.380 --> 31:45.500
Alright, Logi.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.820
There's so much there, but uh...

31:48.820 --> 31:52.900
You know, I'm very interested to see...

31:52.900 --> 31:57.220
Just a lot of stuff from the PS3, actually. The game I've been looking forward to,

31:57.220 --> 31:58.500
Motorstorm.

31:58.500 --> 32:03.780
I'm looking forward to playing that game, because that looks fucking sweet, but uh...

32:03.780 --> 32:05.660
Yeah, that's just too much.

32:05.660 --> 32:09.420
I'm looking forward to seeing which Japanese gaming celebrity I'm going to run into this

32:09.420 --> 32:10.420
year.

32:10.420 --> 32:11.540
I'm hoping for Yuji Naka.

32:11.540 --> 32:17.800
I'm looking forward to seeing Paris Hilton at her booth trying to promote some cell phone

32:17.800 --> 32:21.700
game and asking her stupid questions and getting it all on film.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.060
Rob, you should get her autograph.

32:24.060 --> 32:26.060
We'll see.

32:26.060 --> 32:27.500
Miek LaTos stole my number one.

32:27.500 --> 32:30.940
My number one was the Luminous Games when they were coming out.

32:30.940 --> 32:31.940
Mine is three on mine.

32:31.940 --> 32:32.940
Well, because you suck.

32:32.940 --> 32:33.940
Well, that's better stuff.

32:33.940 --> 32:34.940
Dear Squeamix.

32:34.940 --> 32:38.500
We want chrono trigger for the DS and we want like an ein hander, too

32:38.700 --> 32:41.580
Yes, ein hander too would be the best thing ever

32:42.460 --> 32:44.460
That game out not too long ago

32:45.800 --> 32:50.660
They're gonna make an ein hander game and you know since they don't really want to do that much work for

32:51.020 --> 32:54.520
Ported over to the PSP or a better system

32:55.260 --> 32:58.740
Comments in the chat room because I don't want to ignore you guys. I'm sorry

32:59.700 --> 33:03.940
Tetris DS maniac 64 says Duke Nukem forever. Oh, yeah

33:03.940 --> 33:06.060
I hope to see that there.

33:06.060 --> 33:11.140
Let's see, 23rd Magus says fucking Starcraft Ghost, although wasn't that cancelled?

33:11.140 --> 33:12.140
That's not coming out.

33:12.140 --> 33:13.140
Sorry to say.

33:13.140 --> 33:15.100
On current gen at least.

33:15.100 --> 33:17.100
Maybe later.

33:17.100 --> 33:21.260
GS191 says Squeenix should just remake the whole damn FF series.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.260
Give it time.

33:22.260 --> 33:26.420
Well you have Final Fantasy 3 going to be shown there I think.

33:26.420 --> 33:27.940
That's true.

33:27.940 --> 33:34.940
Final Fantasy, uh, what was it, uh, five and six? I think? Yeah.

33:38.980 --> 33:45.980
Moving on. More stuff. Loki. A website I used to visit an awful lot. I don't know if I want

33:49.220 --> 33:54.100
to visit it anymore. Why would this be? Me too. Alakazam. It used to be a really good

33:54.100 --> 34:01.100
website that was actually pretty much a hub for anything online.

34:01.100 --> 34:07.420
Meaning games, like Final Fantasy XI. Online games, yeah, like MMOs and stuff. The thing

34:07.420 --> 34:14.260
is though, is they just got bought out. And they got bought out by a website called ZAM.

34:14.260 --> 34:21.260
The ZAM Network, Z-A-M, which happens to be also owned... there's a bunch of different

34:21.260 --> 34:23.260
There's a bunch of different chains of websites

34:23.260 --> 34:29.260
But it all comes back to one website that really gets people's pains in a bunch and that would be I GE

34:30.460 --> 34:34.400
Which is best known for kill selling gold selling you name it they sell it. Ooh

34:35.940 --> 34:39.420
Yuck and they own that website now, so

34:40.740 --> 34:43.500
sucks if you're still visiting that because

34:44.660 --> 34:46.660
yeah, lots of

34:46.660 --> 34:48.660
Lots of problems there.

34:48.660 --> 34:51.660
Miklotov, you surf Alakazam. What's the reaction been like there?

34:51.660 --> 34:58.660
Um, everybody's angry and most of the posts I saw said that everybody was canceling their premium accounts

34:58.660 --> 35:00.660
as soon as they run up for the month.

35:00.660 --> 35:04.660
So not too many people are happy about this, I guess.

35:04.660 --> 35:06.660
Yeah, that's right. Alaz was selling the premium accounts.

35:06.660 --> 35:11.660
Yep. And I was like, oh, it funds the Dirty Gil sellers. Time to quit.

35:11.660 --> 35:14.820
I still like Alakazam because it has information but

35:14.820 --> 35:19.500
I'm not gonna pay them money. I didn't want to pay them money in the first place.

35:19.500 --> 35:22.620
Yeah, I wouldn't pay them money either. I can still use their search feature. Internet is free!

35:22.620 --> 35:27.180
It is. Zero. $9.95. That's free. How do you feel about

35:27.180 --> 35:31.740
Gil selling gold? I don't care. I don't care about it.

35:31.740 --> 35:34.860
Yeah.

35:34.860 --> 35:38.860
You know if somebody were screwing up Ragnarok's economy that same way you'd care about it

35:38.860 --> 35:39.780
mighty quick I bet.

35:39.780 --> 35:41.780
I don't play on I.R.O.

35:43.780 --> 35:45.780
Oh, so you're stealing your Ragnarok.

35:45.780 --> 35:48.780
I'm not stealing my Ragnarok. Somebody else is stealing it.

35:48.780 --> 35:49.780
You're just borrowing it.

35:49.780 --> 35:50.780
Pouring them out.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.780
You know though, like on our new server in Final Fantasy,

35:52.780 --> 35:56.780
I haven't heard anybody talk about any Gil sellers whatsoever.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.780
Good, maybe they're all gone.

35:58.780 --> 36:00.780
Or they're not a problem on this server.

36:00.780 --> 36:01.780
We'll see.

36:01.780 --> 36:04.780
Alright, Dark Soccer likes to surf the internet up and down

36:04.780 --> 36:07.780
and find a good website that does deserve your attention.

36:07.780 --> 36:12.280
going to sell out to gill sellers or gold sellers. Dark Sakura, what website did you

36:12.280 --> 36:16.680
pick this week? This is actually one of the sites that I think is pretty cool is Silent

36:16.680 --> 36:22.320
Hill Heaven. I go there all the time looking at pictures and stuff and it's pretty cool.

36:22.320 --> 36:28.040
You can get pictures of weapons from the endings, screen captures, fan art, and they even have

36:28.040 --> 36:36.040
a translation on here that they were working on for the Silent Hill Play Novel. For anyone

36:36.040 --> 36:40.720
who's probably heard me mention this before, the play novel was Japan only on

36:40.720 --> 36:46.040
the Game Boy and it was running through two scenarios. One where you play as

36:46.040 --> 36:51.720
Harry and the other one where you play as Sybil, which from what I understand

36:51.720 --> 36:54.720
there was actually supposed to be a scenario with Sybil in the first game

36:54.720 --> 37:02.120
that never made it in. So this is more what her story was like along different

37:02.120 --> 37:06.840
ending lines not all of it is there only part of it is there but it's pretty cool

37:06.840 --> 37:12.080
they're working on it they also like I mentioned have tons of pictures tons of

37:12.080 --> 37:17.280
information they have stuff from the DVDs the lost memories and art of Silent

37:17.280 --> 37:22.880
Hill fanfic gallery I'm sorry fanfic archive fan art gallery all kinds of

37:22.880 --> 37:27.240

38:34.020 --> 38:37.500

38:46.340 --> 38:48.900
don't think anyone was writing that down with a pen very fast.

38:48.900 --> 38:53.420
Shall we go to the telephones, the Skyplines, and see who's calling us today?

38:53.420 --> 38:57.860
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

38:57.860 --> 39:01.620
How's it going guys?

39:01.620 --> 39:06.540
Hi, who's this? It's DMN. Hi DMN, turn down your outgoing a little bit, we can

39:06.540 --> 39:07.260
hear ourselves.

39:07.260 --> 39:11.740
What's on your mind?

39:11.740 --> 39:14.900
Not much, I have a couple of bits of

39:14.900 --> 39:18.660
news out of the Nintendo camp that I think I can share without getting my

39:18.660 --> 39:19.540
head cut off

39:19.540 --> 39:23.340
ooh I like this I like this controversial news

39:23.340 --> 39:27.940
I hope one of them is what I think it is well let's see what can you share with

39:27.940 --> 39:28.420
us

39:28.420 --> 39:31.820
I can share some price news

39:31.820 --> 39:36.740
I've been the $79.99 I've been hearing floating around

39:36.740 --> 39:41.060
quite some time so likely I've been hearing about

39:41.060 --> 39:44.540
mid-august that might happen

39:44.540 --> 39:50.060
Also, when the DS Lite is released, it is likely that the regular DS model will drop

39:50.060 --> 39:54.460
to $99.99.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.860
But other than that, I really haven't heard any other news.

39:56.860 --> 39:58.460
Where were you guys at Sakura Con?

39:58.460 --> 40:08.100
Actually, can you confirm about Osutata Kai and Don being bought out as elite task agent?

40:08.100 --> 40:09.980
I've heard nothing of that.

40:09.980 --> 40:12.180
I heard a rumor about that today, too.

40:12.180 --> 40:17.020
Okay, so that's very cool though, those rumors about the DS, well I guess not so much rumors

40:17.020 --> 40:21.860
at this point, but the DS coming down to 99, the old school one, and the GameCube going

40:21.860 --> 40:23.740
down to 79.99.

40:23.740 --> 40:24.860
Very cool.

40:24.860 --> 40:28.460
I think I heard in there as well, where the hell were you at SakuraCon?

40:28.460 --> 40:33.620
It just came up a little late for us, but we will definitely try to get up there next

40:33.620 --> 40:36.780
year because I miss Seattle, I really do like it up there.

40:36.780 --> 40:40.180
I'm actually planning on going to Vancouver at the end of June.

40:40.180 --> 40:42.180
I've really wanted to get a soccer cup for a while.

40:42.180 --> 40:45.180
I will arrange a few passes.

40:45.180 --> 40:47.180
You will arrange what?

40:47.180 --> 40:49.180
I'm repeating game manager this year.

40:49.180 --> 40:53.180
I can arrange for some passes for you guys.

40:53.180 --> 40:55.180
Sweet! We like passes.

40:55.180 --> 40:58.180
Do they get us backstage so we can meet rock stars?

40:58.180 --> 41:00.180
Um, we'll see.

41:00.180 --> 41:03.180
Sweet! Awesome.

41:03.180 --> 41:05.180
DMN, thanks so much for calling in.

41:05.180 --> 41:08.180
Is there anything else you want to get out before we hang up on you?

41:08.180 --> 41:12.680
Um, no. Alright, then have a good one!

41:12.680 --> 41:16.520
Thanks for calling. Well we appreciate that. A little bit of the

41:16.520 --> 41:23.640
insider knowledge there on Nintendo. Awesome. Let's see, let's go and answer

41:23.640 --> 41:27.720
this one. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Sorry.

41:27.720 --> 41:31.560
Okay, something exploded right as someone picked up the phone. It sounded like someone dropped a keyboard.

41:31.560 --> 41:36.080
Wow! Someone set us up the bomb. Who's this? Hi, this is Sephiroth1215.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.480
Hi Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

41:38.480 --> 41:41.040
First off, I was wondering,

41:41.040 --> 41:43.280
will we be doing actual good coverage

41:43.280 --> 41:44.740
for the

41:44.740 --> 41:47.920
Imani series this year?

41:47.920 --> 41:52.160
Our coverage will be mediocre on all levels.

41:52.160 --> 41:53.600
I'm just saying,

41:53.600 --> 41:56.840
because usually all sites, all other sites, they

41:56.840 --> 42:01.200
barely say anything about it, they don't really pay attention to games like DDR, so...

42:01.200 --> 42:04.400
You should actually look at our gallery and look at the twenty

42:04.400 --> 42:08.860
Thousand photos I took at Konami's booth last year. We will not ignore Bahmani. Don't worry

42:08.860 --> 42:13.460
We plan on doing a very extensive coverage of Bahmani, of course, because we know we know our fan base

42:13.460 --> 42:17.900
We started as a Bahmani show and we know that a lot of you guys stuck with us through the changes

42:17.900 --> 42:21.560
So, of course we will I'm absolutely bringing you all the Bahmani news

42:22.540 --> 42:24.340
all right

42:24.340 --> 42:26.220
also, I

42:26.220 --> 42:28.220
Actually made a short list of

42:28.220 --> 42:31.900
of things I noticed when I was playing Supernova

42:31.900 --> 42:35.820
not too long ago. What's that? Alright.

42:35.820 --> 42:40.020
I'm gonna try to go as fast as I can, but

42:40.020 --> 42:43.580
I could say that I don't like the... there's a new

42:43.580 --> 42:47.380
Milit-Select style because of the...

42:47.380 --> 42:52.020
all the music is all the way down and you have to go all the way past to

42:52.020 --> 42:55.780
the... nevermind.

42:55.780 --> 43:03.820
okay well that's a problem that we just took care of well I'm just I'm trying to

43:03.820 --> 43:06.860
go too fast that's all right well you know hopefully we'll have news on

43:06.860 --> 43:14.460
supernova consumer style at e3 next week yeah I mean otherwise I could just say

43:14.460 --> 43:20.460
good things about it really from what I look like it it's pretty much done and I

43:20.460 --> 43:25.740
I guess the memory card slots might be appearing because of pictures recently.

43:25.740 --> 43:30.180
Absolutely. They said at Economy Gamers Day that it would connect up with the home

43:30.180 --> 43:32.500
versions. I think a lot of people forgot that though, but it will.

43:32.500 --> 43:35.740
There will be memory cards or some type of connectivity through the home versions

43:35.740 --> 43:41.180
somehow. Alright, well, I'm gonna let you go, buddy.

43:41.180 --> 43:44.740
Have a good one and enjoy your DDR. Before you take the next call, Rob,

43:44.740 --> 43:48.380
I have a DMN wanting me to share with everybody

43:48.380 --> 43:55.300
Yes, there's a strong possibility of the new earthbound series coming to the US. Thank God. They've heard our prayers

43:55.300 --> 43:57.300
I heard the new one's pretty mediocre though

44:00.620 --> 44:04.760
I'm going want to make a love to it all night long. I will definitely have this if it comes out

44:04.760 --> 44:06.760
Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

44:07.140 --> 44:13.140
This is a nerd from somewhere. Hi Xander from somewhere. Love the new icon on your Skype

44:13.140 --> 44:15.920
He's got the rez game icon there. Love it. What's up?

44:15.920 --> 44:21.520
Not a whole lot. I have a theory on why

44:21.520 --> 44:24.560
they don't have In the Groove in the schools instead of DDR.

44:24.560 --> 44:27.640
Because it sucks. No, hold on. Because the kids are too fat

44:27.640 --> 44:34.640
to play it. Wait a minute though, with that statement you're

44:34.820 --> 44:37.920
just reaffirming the fact that In the Groove is not a game for beginners.

44:37.920 --> 44:41.000
Or a game for sane people.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.160
Or a game for people who like good games. Be nice. Exactly.

44:45.160 --> 44:50.180
be nice Xander please finish your thought I will I will hold these rude

44:50.180 --> 44:50.900
ones at bay

44:50.900 --> 44:54.060
I'm not rude I'm honest

44:54.060 --> 44:57.300
I will turn these, look I'm in front of the board I'll turn the mics off

44:57.300 --> 45:00.460
watch me do it I can throw stuff at you from here I will do it I'll throw

45:00.460 --> 45:03.260
I got my hand on the cord, look my hand on the cord

45:03.260 --> 45:06.860
alright Xander what's on your mind?

45:06.860 --> 45:10.300
I was just saying that everybody in West Virginia is a fat hillbilly

45:10.300 --> 45:15.120
well if those folks in West Virginia can address those cards and let

45:15.120 --> 45:18.680
letters to Zander, care of our forums, okay?

45:18.680 --> 45:22.520
By the way, for this summer, I'm doing this choir trip, and that's actually where we're

45:22.520 --> 45:23.520
going.

45:23.520 --> 45:24.520
It's West Virginia.

45:24.520 --> 45:26.800
Not that you really need to know that.

45:26.800 --> 45:28.920
What choir is that?

45:28.920 --> 45:31.080
It's a thing for a church, so...

45:31.080 --> 45:32.080
All right.

45:32.080 --> 45:33.080
Well...

45:33.080 --> 45:35.880
That's not very Christian of you to call them all fat hillbillies.

45:35.880 --> 45:42.480
Then people in West Virginia be waiting for just all the church choirs that come through,

45:42.480 --> 45:46.480
We asked for Xander, and when you find him, you know, kick his ass.

45:46.480 --> 45:53.640
I like how he said that the kids are all fat and they can handle DDR, but it's mostly because

45:53.640 --> 45:57.560
those kids are not elitist pricks, and that's why they can handle ITG.

45:57.560 --> 46:03.040
Xander, would he retort?

46:03.040 --> 46:04.120
I like In the Groove.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.120
I know you do.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.200
I've been playing it a lot recently.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.080
I know you do.

46:08.080 --> 46:10.720
Don't listen to the haters, Xander.

46:10.720 --> 46:12.080
It has neat music.

46:12.080 --> 46:18.200
steps are kinda crap. Kid Whatever was a nice guy. I like Life of a Butterfly, that's about

46:18.200 --> 46:23.120
it. I like, which MC was that? I don't know, I don't care. I like MC Frontalot. Alright,

46:23.120 --> 46:31.000
Xander, anything else? Um, I have a question, like, do you know any video game news websites

46:31.000 --> 46:37.480
in Spanish? Video game news websites in Spanish? Uh, Orange Laundry run through Alta Vista?

46:37.480 --> 46:39.480
No, I don't know. I don't know of any off the top of my head.

46:39.480 --> 46:41.480
I've found one, I think.

46:41.480 --> 46:45.480
Well, I usually find them in, like, German and Russian.

46:45.480 --> 46:47.480
Which is not Spanish.

46:47.480 --> 46:49.480
Which is not Spanish, so I'll have to hunt it down.

46:49.480 --> 46:51.480
How do you say video game in Espanol?

46:51.480 --> 46:53.480
Video game-o.

46:53.480 --> 46:55.480
It is not video game-o!

46:55.480 --> 46:57.480
El video game?

46:57.480 --> 46:59.480
No, juegos de video.

46:59.480 --> 47:01.480
There you go! Put that in Google!

47:01.480 --> 47:05.480
I tried, and it didn't really give me anything.

47:05.480 --> 47:09.040
I'm going on the hunt now. This is a personal job. All right, just stay tuned to chat room

47:09.040 --> 47:11.040
We're gonna let you go so we can take another call. All right

47:11.160 --> 47:13.160
Okay later

47:14.040 --> 47:16.280
Why does he always try to start a fight

47:17.200 --> 47:20.960
It's every time you're here too. He doesn't bring up in the groove unless you're here

47:21.200 --> 47:27.760
I'll come back with you know, correct answers and the truth. Let's go to the next call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge radio

47:27.760 --> 47:34.040
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

47:34.040 --> 47:40.720
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

47:40.720 --> 47:45.880
Okay, no one's there, the volume's too low dude, we gotta let you go, go to somebody

47:45.880 --> 47:46.880
else.

47:46.880 --> 47:47.880
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

47:47.880 --> 47:49.880
Hi Sky, it's Ravenstaufen.

47:49.880 --> 47:52.440
Hi Ravenstaufen, what's on your mind?

47:52.440 --> 47:57.520
Well, what's on my mind is those press conferences that be before E3.

47:57.520 --> 48:02.700
yep on our mind too. Which one is you most excited for?

48:02.700 --> 48:06.560
Nintendo because they're holding the biggest package in their pants still

48:06.560 --> 48:09.720
yeah because it's the Wii

48:09.720 --> 48:13.000
you got it! I'm interested in seeing

48:13.000 --> 48:17.760
playstation or Sony's and Nintendo's Microsoft I couldn't care because they're

48:17.760 --> 48:21.240
well now it's probably Halo 3 which oh my god I didn't know that was coming out

48:21.240 --> 48:25.480
I you know I you know I think Xbox may I'm looking forward to all of them because I

48:25.480 --> 48:26.540
think Xbox may

48:26.540 --> 48:30.080
I want to know if they're gonna say anything about HD DVD that's all I just

48:30.080 --> 48:31.000
want to know if they're gonna

48:31.000 --> 48:35.640
even go there. I want to laugh at them. Oh stop they're fine there's nothing wrong.

48:35.640 --> 48:38.780
Okay Ravenstahl which one are you looking forward to?

48:38.780 --> 48:43.120
I'm looking forward to the Sony one and then the Nintendo one and I don't

48:43.120 --> 48:46.780
give a rat's ass about Microsoft.

48:46.780 --> 48:49.960
Well there you have it we don't we don't fucking bleep on this show it's

48:49.960 --> 48:50.720
internet radio.

48:50.720 --> 48:54.560
Censor me all the time. That's that's because you're

48:54.560 --> 49:01.460
I like the E3 on PSP.

49:01.460 --> 49:04.960
That made me very giddy as hell.

49:04.960 --> 49:10.260
And I'm glad there's a lot of diversity on Orange Lounge Radio. There's a

49:10.260 --> 49:13.460
girl, there's a gay guy, and there

49:13.460 --> 49:17.340
is a straight married dude that just loves Windows to death.

49:17.340 --> 49:21.560
Yeah, you know, we're an odd

49:21.560 --> 49:25.440
pairing of people but you know just we like games and I like the fact that

49:25.440 --> 49:26.120
we're just

49:26.120 --> 49:29.640
we I think part of what makes our show so

49:29.640 --> 49:33.040
interesting if I can like have an ego here for a minute is what I like about

49:33.040 --> 49:34.080
this program is that

49:34.080 --> 49:37.560
we don't make it any secret that we have lives outside gaming and sometimes we're

49:37.560 --> 49:39.240
a little tongue-in-cheek with our gaming

49:39.240 --> 49:43.280
but we're real you know and that's just what we want to bring to you guys is

49:43.280 --> 49:44.800
just you know a real show

49:44.800 --> 49:48.740
I think I'm part of what I really liked about the show I used to be on

49:48.740 --> 49:51.940
under sedation live that I'm trying to kind of bring over here to orange launch radio

49:51.940 --> 49:56.460
was the fact that it just sounded like a bunch of people at Denny's sitting around talking

49:56.460 --> 50:01.020
shit and that's what we do here we just kind of sit around and talk and let you guys all

50:01.020 --> 50:06.860
eavesdrop in on it and participate in the big thing as well thanks to you know we couldn't

50:06.860 --> 50:10.340
do it so much in the beginning but now we can let you guys join us at the big table

50:10.340 --> 50:16.380
so oh one more thing yes about the wedding uh-huh I went to a Jewish wedding and yeah

50:16.380 --> 50:21.940
they do have the little chairs up in the air so that's yeah we didn't do because

50:21.940 --> 50:26.660
her relatives weren't getting up doing anything and another thing that got

50:26.660 --> 50:32.060
botched to your wedding hey at least you didn't get hurt true true because my my

50:32.060 --> 50:38.820
sister got hurt in that well be a maybe those weddings should come with

50:38.820 --> 50:42.740
disclaimers to be more careful I don't know who's weddings I have no problem

50:42.740 --> 50:47.380
with them but you know I used I've been in one all right all right we gotta let

50:47.380 --> 50:50.340
you go we gotta talk games we'll talk weddings later all right all right

50:50.340 --> 50:54.380
later dude I found Spanish video game sites what is it I'm a bunch of them and

50:54.380 --> 51:02.900
I used a Google Mexico ah good time google.com dot MX what miklotov what

51:02.900 --> 51:12.220
you're just gonna censor me it's a free country no it's okay it is a dirty

51:12.220 --> 51:19.940
Mexicans could use the Internet. You know what? What? I'm bringing Zekayla to E3. Wow.

51:19.940 --> 51:30.300
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, uh, this is SSJ100 Matt. Sorry, but you're cutting out, so all we heard

51:30.300 --> 51:37.660
was the, hey, and then it went dead silent. Who is this? SSJ100 Matt. Hi, SSJ100 Matt,

51:37.660 --> 51:39.660
Matt, what's on your mind?

51:39.660 --> 51:41.660
Mazel tov on your wedding, Loki, by the way.

51:41.660 --> 51:42.660
Thank you.

51:42.660 --> 51:45.660
All right.

51:45.660 --> 51:48.940
No, I wanted to talk about when Sephiroth, 1215, called in,

51:48.940 --> 51:54.020
he was trying to explain with supernova,

51:54.020 --> 51:57.900
he was trying to explain how in economics,

51:57.900 --> 52:00.860
you know how you had to select all songs in order

52:00.860 --> 52:03.340
to get all the songs?

52:03.340 --> 52:05.180
Uh-huh.

52:05.180 --> 52:08.800
Well, you kinda have to do that with Supernova.

52:08.800 --> 52:11.580
It's kind of annoying. Is it really the end of the world?

52:11.580 --> 52:15.340
No, it's just kind of annoying. Is it really going to ruin the game for people?

52:15.340 --> 52:18.920
Not really. Alright, so what's the big fucking deal? I don't know.

52:18.920 --> 52:24.420
Alright, enough said. What else is on your mind? Problem solved. Problem solved!

52:24.420 --> 52:26.100
Umm...

52:26.100 --> 52:29.540
Uhh...

52:29.540 --> 52:33.580
I don't know if that threw me off track.

52:33.580 --> 52:36.060
Well, I guess I got nothing else to say.

52:36.060 --> 52:37.460
Gong.

52:37.460 --> 52:40.180
All right.

52:40.180 --> 52:42.840
I just wanted to do that to somebody all night long.

52:42.840 --> 52:43.660
Poor guy.

52:43.660 --> 52:44.180
All right.

52:47.180 --> 52:50.740
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

52:50.740 --> 52:51.460
Hi.

52:51.460 --> 52:53.100
Hi, who's this?

52:53.100 --> 52:54.500
This is Hurricane Z-Man.

52:54.500 --> 52:56.620
Hi, Hurricane what?

52:56.620 --> 52:57.340
Z-Man.

52:57.340 --> 53:00.980
Hi, Hurricane Z-Man, what's on your mind?

53:00.980 --> 53:05.180
I just wanted to know what you guys thought of Final Fantasy XII.

53:05.180 --> 53:10.360
I know there isn't a whole lot out about it, but I was sorely disappointed with Final Fantasy

53:10.360 --> 53:11.360
XI.

53:11.360 --> 53:12.360
What?

53:12.360 --> 53:15.360
Alright, here's the thing.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.880
Final Fantasy XI is a completely different game.

53:17.880 --> 53:20.400
It took the Final Fantasy universe and turned it upside down.

53:20.400 --> 53:21.400
Here's the thing.

53:21.400 --> 53:25.180
I've played the Final Fantasy XII demo, and I've played it twice now, essentially, because

53:25.180 --> 53:28.240
I played the E3 demo a couple years ago when they actually had it there.

53:28.240 --> 53:30.400
That was stupid, the first demo they had.

53:30.400 --> 53:35.400
But the demo they put in with Dragon Quest VIII is great, and the thing that's great

53:35.400 --> 53:39.960
about it is that it fuses that Final Fantasy XI universe with the rest of it, and I don't

53:39.960 --> 53:45.900
want to say that to kind of put you off, but what I'm saying is that it kind of makes 11

53:45.900 --> 53:47.080
make sense.

53:47.080 --> 53:50.520
Because honestly, in the scope of all the Final Fantasy games, I think the only one

53:50.520 --> 53:54.280
that XI has a lot in common with is II.

53:54.280 --> 53:57.800
If you go and play Final Fantasy II, it's actually very similar to XI in some ways,

53:57.800 --> 54:00.660
without the whole real-time battle, hmm?

54:00.660 --> 54:02.760
I thought it was four.

54:02.760 --> 54:04.420
Well, yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong,

54:04.420 --> 54:06.620
four will forever be my favorite,

54:06.620 --> 54:08.160
with six a close runner-up,

54:08.160 --> 54:09.980
just because I'm a Super Nintendo brat,

54:09.980 --> 54:13.860
but I think 12 is gonna be really great.

54:13.860 --> 54:17.000
I've heard really good things from folks

54:17.000 --> 54:18.860
who've imported the Japanese version.

54:18.860 --> 54:20.220
I haven't bothered to look at it,

54:20.220 --> 54:22.100
because I can't really understand Japanese,

54:22.100 --> 54:24.460
and I want my first experience with the game

54:24.460 --> 54:27.180
to be one that I understand fully,

54:27.180 --> 54:30.780
But I don't see many reasons why this will disappoint, but I think the only thing that's

54:30.780 --> 54:34.740
going to turn people off is the battle system, because it is a little more like Eleven's,

54:34.740 --> 54:35.740
but not...

54:35.740 --> 54:37.540
Which is crap.

54:37.540 --> 54:38.540
Which is fun.

54:38.540 --> 54:41.980
No, I like Eleven's battle, and I think the problem that you had with Eleven was that

54:41.980 --> 54:46.780
you had to sit around and wait for a party, and then when you got one, the people were,

54:46.780 --> 54:47.780
you know, bossy.

54:47.780 --> 54:48.780
Stupid?

54:48.780 --> 54:49.780
Retarded?

54:49.780 --> 54:50.780
Here's the thing.

54:50.780 --> 54:51.780
Brain damaged?

54:51.780 --> 54:52.780
But in Final Fantasy XII, you're the boss.

54:52.780 --> 54:53.780
They're all your bitches.

54:53.780 --> 54:54.780
Ooh.

54:54.780 --> 54:55.780
Bitch of the White Mage.

54:55.780 --> 54:56.780
Yeah.

54:56.780 --> 54:58.780
What was that dude?

54:58.780 --> 55:00.780
Sounds a lot better.

55:00.780 --> 55:05.780
Check out the demo because Dragon Quest VIII is a great game.

55:05.780 --> 55:07.780
I'll have to download that.

55:07.780 --> 55:10.780
Thanks guys. Keep up the great work with the show guys.

55:10.780 --> 55:12.780

55:12.780 --> 55:14.780
Thanks for calling.

55:14.780 --> 55:18.780
We like a good ego inflation once in a while.

55:18.780 --> 55:20.780
Alright, thanks for the phone calls guys.

55:20.780 --> 55:22.780

55:56.080 --> 56:05.360
engineering entrepreneur and started Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Totsuko with Akio Morita and

56:05.360 --> 56:11.220

For us, you know, three people who like Perfect Dark Zero.

56:20.220 --> 56:22.220
I just couldn't get into that game, sorry.

56:22.220 --> 56:25.220
I know why people would like it, but I just couldn't get into it.

56:25.220 --> 56:29.220
They've actually put up the first round of downloadable content for Perfect Dark Zero.

56:29.220 --> 56:32.220
You do have to wait a little bit longer, though, for the premium maps.

56:32.220 --> 56:37.220
There's new bots available in dark ops multiplayer games,

56:37.220 --> 56:43.220
player games as well as in deathmatch that split into various new AIs.

56:43.220 --> 56:49.860
Microsoft and Rare have put in some bug fixes that basically keep people from floating through

56:49.860 --> 56:56.060
the air, keeping the capture flags, receiving positive points for team killing.

56:56.060 --> 56:58.340
That's a big one.

56:58.340 --> 57:01.980
They've just gone in and fixed a lot of the little bugs and glitches in the game as well

57:01.980 --> 57:06.540
