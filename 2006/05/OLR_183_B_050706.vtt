00:19.815 --> 00:34.460
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 183 for this May the 7th of 2006 for part B. Going to our podcast feed a little bit early this week to make way for the podcast we're going to be doing from the E3 Outpost Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.620
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited about that.

00:35.920 --> 00:47.784
[SPEAKER_02]: For more information, check out part A or check out our website, orangeloungeradio.com or E3onpsp.com, our brand new PSP site to bring the E3 experience to your PlayStation Portable.

00:49.039 --> 00:56.132
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you're a DS fan, you've got some really good news coming your way, and that would be the new DS that's coming out, right, DarkSakura?

00:57.154 --> 00:59.418
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the DS Lite, and I want one.

00:59.899 --> 01:00.440
[SPEAKER_02]: I want one, too.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.282
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very sexy.

01:02.369 --> 01:04.850
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we've got a release date for the U.S.

01:04.910 --> 01:05.390
[SPEAKER_04]: on this one.

01:05.830 --> 01:09.531
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be released on June 11th for the price of $129.99.

01:12.652 --> 01:14.432
[SPEAKER_04]: Only the white one is going to be out in the U.S.

01:14.492 --> 01:18.193
[SPEAKER_04]: to begin with, although they've got three other colors in Japan, too.

01:20.734 --> 01:24.815
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also going to be releasing on May 15th the new Super Mario Bros.

01:27.175 --> 01:29.576
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to wait and see.

01:30.276 --> 01:30.596
[SPEAKER_04]: You know,

01:31.684 --> 01:35.448
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's the DS Lite, but I want to wait for more colors.

01:36.249 --> 01:37.910
[SPEAKER_04]: I like having a selection.

01:38.270 --> 01:39.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know there's going to be more colors.

01:39.832 --> 01:41.954
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, there's nothing wrong with the DS I have now.

01:42.354 --> 01:43.195
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine works just fine.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.557
[SPEAKER_02]: You say that until you actually see one in action.

01:45.577 --> 01:46.779
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, holy crap.

01:47.299 --> 01:49.842
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think at Nintendo's booth they'll have everything on the DS Lite?

01:50.401 --> 01:50.941
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably.

01:51.161 --> 01:52.121
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that might be interesting.

01:52.381 --> 01:55.102
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be an interesting little, like, all their demo DSs or DS lights.

01:55.182 --> 02:01.343
[SPEAKER_11]: One of our, uh, one of my, uh, coworkers imported one, and I swear it's the best thing I've ever seen.

02:01.663 --> 02:08.364
[SPEAKER_12]: That all depends, though, because all their demos are gonna be on dev kits anyways, so... I guess that's true.

02:10.004 --> 02:10.344
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

02:10.544 --> 02:11.085
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

02:12.365 --> 02:19.206
[SPEAKER_12]: But it doesn't matter anyways, remember, because you can do the firmware hack to, um, get the DS light brightness on the, uh, normal DS.

02:19.646 --> 02:19.846
Mm-hmm.

02:20.287 --> 02:21.688
[SPEAKER_02]: SIGA announced Full Auto 2, exclusive for PS3

02:42.537 --> 02:44.558
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of sucks for me, but, you know, whatever.

02:44.578 --> 02:45.658
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm getting all systems anyways.

02:46.298 --> 02:49.920
[SPEAKER_12]: This time around, they're finally going to put some sort of deathmatch mode in there.

02:49.980 --> 02:51.580
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be kind of arena-themed.

02:52.180 --> 02:53.721
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, I guess, twisted metal.

02:55.862 --> 02:56.862
[SPEAKER_12]: And it looks pretty sweet.

02:57.102 --> 02:59.183
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen there's actually pictures online now.

02:59.723 --> 03:05.505
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got three pictures on Xbox Oxide or whatever, that site.

03:05.865 --> 03:10.987
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's sweet looking, so I can't wait to check that one out.

03:11.772 --> 03:19.257
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's interesting is a lot of the news sites where I saw that news on kind of took the opportunity to bash Full Auto 1 as being a bad game, but I kind of enjoyed it.

03:19.297 --> 03:19.738
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

03:19.758 --> 03:21.459
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's not the best thing ever.

03:21.479 --> 03:22.740
[SPEAKER_12]: It had flaws, but you know what?

03:23.160 --> 03:24.061
[SPEAKER_12]: The second one will be better.

03:25.562 --> 03:27.243
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, isn't that usually the case with games?

03:27.663 --> 03:28.224
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually.

03:28.544 --> 03:28.804
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually.

03:31.294 --> 03:58.762
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Xbox Live is, of course, they had a big patch this week, and assuming that they're gearing up for their big E3 showing, they're going to have an awful lot of stuff coming up for E3, including demos and trailers for Test Drive Unlimited, MotoGP 06, Crackdown, Dead or Alive Extreme 2, The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle Earth 2, Lost Planet, Sonic the Hedgehog, Splinter Cell Double Agent, and Viva PiÃ±ata.

03:59.302 --> 04:04.064
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they're saying a flood of HD trailers from games that have yet to be announced.

04:04.564 --> 04:05.924
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Halo 3?

04:06.925 --> 04:09.966
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, they're going to have HD trailers for movies as well.

04:10.506 --> 04:11.786
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too much of a surprise there.

04:12.126 --> 04:20.229
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wish the Xbox 360 front end was built a little more to handle a lot of stuff, because scrolling through a big list is going to be annoying, I think.

04:20.509 --> 04:21.409
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's just me.

04:22.130 --> 04:26.251
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless they do a page that's going to be all E3 stuff, but even still...

04:26.767 --> 04:30.951
[SPEAKER_02]: Now remember, that doesn't necessarily mean they're all playable demos, just some of them.

04:31.311 --> 04:32.552
[SPEAKER_02]: Demos, trailers, we don't know which.

04:32.572 --> 04:33.653
[SPEAKER_12]: Lost Planet is going to be a demo.

04:33.794 --> 04:34.254
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

04:35.515 --> 04:38.278
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're going to have, what was the other thing that they were going to have?

04:39.719 --> 04:41.701
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the Top Spin 2 demo just came out.

04:42.982 --> 04:48.247
[SPEAKER_12]: And World Cup Soccer was another one they were talking about releasing a demo for.

04:49.696 --> 04:55.978
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be very interesting to see what sort of effect the Xbox Live integration of E3 is going to have.

04:56.158 --> 04:57.399
[SPEAKER_02]: Uno is coming out.

04:57.639 --> 04:58.219
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I heard about that.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.120
[SPEAKER_02]: Uno is coming out next week as part of a celebration for E3.

05:01.380 --> 05:03.181
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet no Street Fighter 2.

05:04.061 --> 05:06.462
[SPEAKER_02]: Still not out.

05:07.843 --> 05:10.324
[SPEAKER_12]: Massive problems with that game, I hear.

05:10.824 --> 05:11.324
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

05:14.125 --> 05:14.765
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll fix them.

05:14.905 --> 05:15.626
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that game out.

05:15.946 --> 05:16.666
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop teasing us.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.548
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, something new coming out for the DS?

05:19.928 --> 05:24.531
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Disney actually has a new exclusive title for the DS called Spectrobes.

05:25.532 --> 05:38.480
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it's supposed to be infused with edgy, highly stylized look and feel of a Japanese anime or manga series with unique original characters, right?

05:39.101 --> 05:41.802
[SPEAKER_12]: And compelling storyline, breakthrough gameplay.

05:42.203 --> 05:43.864
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

05:44.064 --> 05:45.985
[SPEAKER_12]: It says the game allows players to...

05:47.668 --> 05:52.450
[SPEAKER_12]: Excavate, and Train Battle with nearly 500 unique characters.

05:53.451 --> 05:56.032
[SPEAKER_12]: So it sounds kind of like a Pokemon game.

05:56.052 --> 05:58.113
[SPEAKER_12]: They actually have a game coming out right now.

05:58.694 --> 06:04.977
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called some stupid-ass game where you dig up dinosaur bones.

06:06.357 --> 06:11.980
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, if Jurassic Park were to have sex with Pokemon, this is the game you would get.

06:12.260 --> 06:13.761
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just weird.

06:13.781 --> 06:14.522
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

06:14.702 --> 06:15.062
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

06:16.115 --> 06:16.656
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot.

06:17.136 --> 06:20.780
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought out the emulators this week and I played Jurassic Park on the Super Nintendo.

06:22.301 --> 06:25.004
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wanted to show somebody the scary first person mode.

06:25.865 --> 06:27.187
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is really bad, but anyway.

06:27.927 --> 06:28.668
[SPEAKER_12]: That game was fun.

06:29.649 --> 06:29.989
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

06:30.610 --> 06:34.534
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it's going to be coming out and probably at Buena Vista's booth this year.

06:35.215 --> 06:35.415
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

06:36.882 --> 06:43.524
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura likes to travel the world from her computer because she loves you UK listeners as well as everybody.

06:43.944 --> 06:44.764
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter where you're at.

06:44.784 --> 06:45.284
[SPEAKER_02]: She loves you all.

06:46.064 --> 06:48.405
[SPEAKER_02]: But UK has a release calendar of their own.

06:48.985 --> 06:54.426
[SPEAKER_02]: The UK has a release date calendar of their own and DarkSakura would like to share some upcoming UK release dates.

06:54.726 --> 06:57.146
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we have special things coming out.

06:58.307 --> 07:04.068
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 12th we have City Life for PC, Dreamfall The Longest Journey, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary for PC.

07:05.448 --> 07:13.912
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man World 3, Sin Episodes Emergence, Time Shift, Brain Age, coming out on the DS on the 19th.

07:15.232 --> 07:17.713
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple more things on the 19th, Fire Department 3.

07:18.634 --> 07:20.935
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that game was massively delayed.

07:21.355 --> 07:24.496
[SPEAKER_04]: Time Shift is apparently slated for PC and Xbox 360 on the 12th.

07:25.556 --> 07:28.117
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pac-Man World 3 on PSP on the 19th.

07:28.177 --> 07:31.939
[SPEAKER_12]: It was originally supposed to be on the 12th, but the problem was it got

07:32.383 --> 07:34.024
[SPEAKER_12]: I would actually like to hear from our UK listeners.

07:34.044 --> 07:36.105
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me know how the Rainbow Islands Revolution turned out.

07:36.125 --> 07:36.905
[SPEAKER_12]: It was released on the 5th.

07:36.925 --> 07:39.467
[SPEAKER_12]: So if anyone picked it up, let me know what you think about it.

07:39.487 --> 07:40.467
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to hear your review.

07:40.487 --> 07:41.588
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm curious about it too.

08:03.749 --> 08:04.009
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

08:04.049 --> 08:04.309
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

08:04.409 --> 08:04.749
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

08:04.989 --> 08:05.450
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot.

08:05.470 --> 08:08.271
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, I don't think a whole bunch is going to come out during E3.

08:08.391 --> 08:09.531
[SPEAKER_02]: No, obviously not.

08:09.571 --> 08:13.192
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought, Loki, humorous anyway, is there anything coming out for the US?

08:13.973 --> 08:16.574
[SPEAKER_12]: There's jack shit coming out for the US.

08:17.214 --> 08:22.095
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the only real game that's coming out is Over the Hedge, and that's coming out on most systems.

08:22.836 --> 08:30.318
[SPEAKER_12]: You do have the, was it the Guitar Hero SG controller coming out, which is, I guess, kind of interesting.

08:31.079 --> 08:31.139
[SPEAKER_12]: On...

08:33.880 --> 08:36.042
[SPEAKER_12]: Tringo on the Game Boy Advance

09:04.278 --> 09:05.980
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:28.868 --> 09:29.309
[SPEAKER_12]: Xbox 360, PS3, Xbox 360

09:44.082 --> 09:51.565
[SPEAKER_12]: Screenshots will be impossible to tell the 360 from the PS3 apart.

09:51.585 --> 09:57.187
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember how they used to do that in GamePro where they'd have screenshots of Super Nintendo and Genesis versions.

09:57.687 --> 09:59.548
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll hopefully start seeing that again.

09:59.908 --> 10:04.049
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that we're going to see differences.

10:06.130 --> 10:08.051
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the PS3 is going to end up being better.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.343
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well that's... We'll see this week.

10:11.543 --> 10:12.024
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully.

10:12.164 --> 10:12.544
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully.

10:12.624 --> 10:15.387
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all how you... I've seen a lot of stuff.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.570
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, look at God of War on the PlayStation 2.

10:18.110 --> 10:24.237
[SPEAKER_12]: You can really push out a lot of graphics and quality in some of these systems.

10:24.277 --> 10:26.179
[SPEAKER_12]: You just have to know how to program for them.

10:26.379 --> 10:28.281
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we've seen the best of Xbox 360 yet either.

10:28.521 --> 10:30.143
[SPEAKER_02]: Not by a long shot.

10:30.423 --> 10:30.764
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

10:32.254 --> 10:35.116
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not have seen the best of the PSP or the DS yet as well.

10:35.196 --> 10:49.945
[SPEAKER_02]: There are rumors abounding that Vonage, that broadband phone company, Vonage is apparently making software that is going to allow PSP and DS users to turn those handheld systems into VOIP phones.

10:50.625 --> 10:57.309
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you think about it, that means your handheld would basically be a phone that you could use anywhere that there's Wi-Fi, like an N-Gage.

10:57.529 --> 11:01.010
[SPEAKER_04]: First we had the taco, and now we have the quesadilla.

11:01.690 --> 11:02.931
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the DS, a clam?

11:02.951 --> 11:04.971
[SPEAKER_04]: I was saying quesadilla.

11:05.111 --> 11:07.092
[SPEAKER_04]: I was sticking with the Mexican food reference.

11:07.112 --> 11:07.592
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a clam.

11:07.912 --> 11:08.832
[SPEAKER_12]: I still think it's a taco.

11:08.852 --> 11:10.433
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you kind of like put it back together.

11:10.453 --> 11:11.973
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter anyways.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.533
[SPEAKER_12]: The N-Gage isn't finished.

11:13.894 --> 11:15.414
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the N-Gage will rule the world.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I'll be buying a Gizmondo tomorrow.

11:18.966 --> 11:25.412
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Engage should be the first booth that we do a video presentation from for the E3 on PSP site.

11:25.432 --> 11:26.774
[SPEAKER_04]: We should totally do like in Wayne's World.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.516
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, we're at the Engage booth.

11:29.596 --> 11:30.197
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know what?

11:30.397 --> 11:32.239
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making Bobby cover Engage.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.261
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll cover the Engage booth.

11:34.281 --> 11:37.944
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to find out what is so wonderful about this.

11:38.785 --> 11:38.905
[SPEAKER_12]: And

11:41.139 --> 11:43.340
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically, we're just going to ask them the questions.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.541
[SPEAKER_12]: Why should I buy an N-Gage?

11:46.101 --> 11:47.462
[SPEAKER_12]: Because cell phone games rock?

11:47.602 --> 11:49.522
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm sorry, that's not the correct answer.

11:49.602 --> 11:50.803
[SPEAKER_12]: Why should I buy an N-Gage?

11:50.823 --> 11:51.683
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you like tacos.

11:52.463 --> 11:54.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, Yuri Lover is so corny.

11:54.704 --> 11:56.445
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, why should we buy... Oh, sorry.

11:56.625 --> 11:57.825
[SPEAKER_04]: V over IPSP.

12:01.727 --> 12:02.567
[SPEAKER_12]: Gotta let that run.

12:03.888 --> 12:32.286
[SPEAKER_12]: doesn't matter anyways they're going to be doing that that was one of the attachments that they're going to be adding to the PSP so that's not really a surprise no but you know Vonage probably wants a piece of that because they're still I don't know if they're struggling but they're still trying to really get out there and be a major player so this could be huge for them we'll see you know what they need to do they need to be pushing you know Wi-Fi all over the United States and because you know I can tell you right now walking around I can't find that many hot spots Santa Clara though

12:32.568 --> 12:33.948
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got free Wi-Fi everywhere.

12:33.988 --> 12:34.729
[SPEAKER_12]: That's awesome.

12:35.109 --> 12:35.609
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

12:35.629 --> 12:36.849
[SPEAKER_12]: It's covered the entire city.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor is that's supposed to happen in one of our suburbs, Roseville.

12:40.651 --> 12:40.971
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

12:42.191 --> 12:42.471
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

12:44.452 --> 12:44.732
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.532
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another story.

12:46.793 --> 12:47.493
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

12:47.953 --> 12:50.174
[SPEAKER_12]: Another interesting game to be shown at E3.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.134
[SPEAKER_12]: Cooking Mama.

12:52.034 --> 12:55.195
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually going to be part of Majesco's lineup at E3.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.076
[SPEAKER_12]: And this game is basically...

12:58.188 --> 12:58.468
[SPEAKER_12]: Bacons

13:23.786 --> 13:25.507
[SPEAKER_12]: Look forward to eating tomorrow.

13:52.026 --> 13:54.367
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, since somebody brought up the end gauge earlier.

13:54.387 --> 13:55.688
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to mention, though, real quick.

13:55.788 --> 13:55.988
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

13:56.008 --> 13:56.368
[SPEAKER_12]: Real quick.

13:56.969 --> 13:58.369
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you notice it is Cooking Mama?

13:58.689 --> 14:00.330
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, women in the kitchen.

14:00.350 --> 14:01.071
[SPEAKER_12]: In the kitchen.

14:02.231 --> 14:02.831
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

14:04.652 --> 14:07.094
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain, you know, freaking Emeril, okay?

14:08.314 --> 14:09.555
[SPEAKER_11]: Women in disguise.

14:11.363 --> 14:11.703
[SPEAKER_11]: He's crazy.

14:11.723 --> 14:12.905
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the Galloping Gourmet?

14:13.205 --> 14:14.406
[SPEAKER_11]: Woman in disguise.

14:14.466 --> 14:14.947
[SPEAKER_04]: Iron Chef.

14:15.507 --> 14:16.468
[SPEAKER_11]: Women in disguise.

14:16.488 --> 14:17.009
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

14:17.029 --> 14:19.171
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a woman on Iron Chef, but she's more of a man.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.654
[SPEAKER_11]: She's proud to show that she's a woman in cooking.

14:22.714 --> 14:24.356
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get hate mail.

14:24.796 --> 14:29.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I like... This is me as estrogen ambassador, okay?

14:30.542 --> 14:31.463
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to cook.

14:32.243 --> 14:34.185
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I don't.

14:34.566 --> 14:35.847
[SPEAKER_04]: I make my husband make me dinner.

14:37.113 --> 14:38.153
[SPEAKER_11]: Woman in Disguise.

14:38.354 --> 14:39.454
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no.

14:40.014 --> 14:42.275
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:43.516 --> 14:44.216
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows his place.

14:45.056 --> 14:45.696
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

14:47.277 --> 14:47.877
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

14:48.358 --> 14:49.538
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about the end gauge.

14:50.018 --> 14:51.179
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this was hilarious.

14:51.219 --> 14:52.979
[SPEAKER_02]: Joystick ran an article this week.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.541
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, mobile market shows signs of stagnation.

14:56.561 --> 14:57.741
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was my reaction?

14:58.842 --> 14:59.322
[SPEAKER_02]: A duh!

15:01.701 --> 15:02.241
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?

15:02.602 --> 15:03.983
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I don't even have to read the article.

15:04.183 --> 15:06.244
[SPEAKER_02]: Because mobile games are not that great.

15:06.384 --> 15:06.904
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

15:07.625 --> 15:09.626
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not that fun.

15:10.087 --> 15:11.347
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really not that fun.

15:11.408 --> 15:14.790
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel bad because I know people that develop for mobile games and stuff.

15:14.810 --> 15:17.311
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know they're trying very hard at what they do and everything.

15:17.692 --> 15:22.555
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess they just are catered for a certain market that's not me.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.877
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as a hardcore gamer, I really don't like mobile phone games.

15:25.897 --> 15:31.381
[SPEAKER_12]: Mobile gaming is about as cool as talking on one of those cell phones from the 80s today.

15:33.544 --> 15:36.645
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, here's the actual chunk of the story here.

15:36.705 --> 15:43.087
[SPEAKER_02]: A research firm, M-Metrics, published data in March 2006 from a mobile gamer's perspective.

15:43.568 --> 15:53.831
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying that the number of mobile gamers is remaining constant month on month, with only a tiny fraction of mobile users, 0.5%, downloading their first game in March.

15:54.291 --> 15:57.913
[SPEAKER_02]: The percentage of phone users who use their handset for downloadable games is low.

15:57.973 --> 15:58.593
[SPEAKER_02]: The U.S., 2.7%.

16:02.068 --> 16:15.119
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, given the millions and millions of mobile phones in the market, that's still a lot of people, and many of them are repeat customers, but there's really not a lot of reasons to buy new titles, and they're not exactly cheap, and it kind of puts people off.

16:15.979 --> 16:20.843
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's just like spending $5 on a game that actually a Flash game would be better than.

16:20.963 --> 16:21.584
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's just

16:22.492 --> 16:24.473
[SPEAKER_12]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

16:51.209 --> 16:56.091
[SPEAKER_12]: People started to think that it might actually be at E3 because there was an advertisement on IGN, of course.

16:56.871 --> 17:01.413
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone accidentally let that slip through there in their editing department.

17:01.713 --> 17:03.054
[SPEAKER_12]: High hopes.

17:04.154 --> 17:05.114
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at E3, huh?

17:05.434 --> 17:06.095
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me sad.

17:06.895 --> 17:09.856
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me very angry, and you know what happens when people get angry.

17:10.376 --> 17:11.277
[SPEAKER_02]: They turn into the Hulk?

17:12.557 --> 17:14.638
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's time for the FUs of the Week.

17:15.629 --> 17:18.014
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where DarkSakura turns into the She-Hulk.

17:18.696 --> 17:22.163
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, I am not a green-skinned, tall attorney.

17:22.784 --> 17:23.325
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

17:35.669 --> 17:40.352
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the day goes towards this stupid kid in a Mustang.

17:41.173 --> 17:42.514
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I love the Mustang.

17:42.554 --> 17:43.875
[SPEAKER_04]: I love old Mustangs especially.

17:43.975 --> 17:44.875
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the very new ones.

17:45.396 --> 17:47.237
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy's was like a dirty convertible one.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.137
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like probably 16.

17:49.298 --> 17:49.819
[SPEAKER_04]: Really stupid.

17:49.879 --> 17:53.081
[SPEAKER_04]: Had like some blonde stupid looking girl with him.

17:54.045 --> 17:56.627
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will tell you where it is.

17:57.007 --> 17:58.548
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone in this area will know.

17:59.268 --> 18:02.090
[SPEAKER_04]: It was as I was going from downtown.

18:02.690 --> 18:07.934
[SPEAKER_04]: I had just passed where the Elkhorn entrance onto the freeway goes right before Antelope.

18:08.694 --> 18:10.775
[SPEAKER_04]: You have that long ass merging lane.

18:11.136 --> 18:12.777
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is a really long merging lane.

18:13.377 --> 18:15.398
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was well ahead of the guy.

18:15.899 --> 18:18.200
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he starts speeding up, trying to nose in front of me.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.521
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm already going 80, okay?

18:19.841 --> 18:21.742
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, 65 miles an hour.

18:25.564 --> 18:49.624
[SPEAKER_04]: and so finally he still keeps going and I'm blowing on my horn and finally I had to just drop back and honk at him so um he uh cut over to the other lane and I you know freaking told him off and then cut him off so uh that was my episode of the week to stupid children who don't know how to drive Loki um fuck you to the stupid DJ who like

18:50.319 --> 18:51.260
[SPEAKER_12]: Stay Away From Hot Tracks

19:20.720 --> 19:21.220
[SPEAKER_12]: Horrible.

19:21.601 --> 19:25.463
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, he has some weird relationship with his sister whose name is Ting.

19:26.264 --> 19:26.864
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuckoo!

19:26.984 --> 19:27.665
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy!

19:28.985 --> 19:30.166
[SPEAKER_02]: Send those cards and letters to Loki.

19:30.186 --> 19:33.228
[SPEAKER_02]: The views and opinions expressed by Loki do not necessarily reflect those of the staff.

19:33.949 --> 19:34.789
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come on, you agree.

19:34.849 --> 19:35.730
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a retard.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.752
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not enjoy myself as much as I could have.

19:40.052 --> 19:40.653
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it that way.

19:41.493 --> 19:44.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan kept cracking jokes about it.

19:44.515 --> 19:47.917
[SPEAKER_04]: He offered money to anyone who would go over and grab his inflatable guitar and beat him over the head with it.

19:49.218 --> 19:50.179
[SPEAKER_02]: But your wedding was still great.

19:50.816 --> 19:52.856
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about how we really enjoyed the ceremony.

19:52.876 --> 19:53.456
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very nice.

20:19.144 --> 20:19.464
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

20:20.244 --> 20:27.947
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought it was especially cool that you had the tradition pulled in that the family wanted, but were able to do everything themselves.

20:28.808 --> 20:29.888
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very impressive.

20:29.988 --> 20:31.329
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like seeing Dan in a yarmulke.

20:31.349 --> 20:33.169
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was hilarious.

20:33.770 --> 20:37.111
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, my FU of the week goes to Flight Delays.

20:39.132 --> 20:39.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Mikotov.

20:40.612 --> 20:40.912
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

20:41.272 --> 20:42.093
[SPEAKER_02]: Any FUs of the week?

20:42.553 --> 20:45.374
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to the whole state of Hawaii.

20:45.734 --> 20:46.394
[SPEAKER_11]: Hate you all.

20:47.095 --> 20:47.815
[SPEAKER_11]: Hope you burn.

20:48.482 --> 20:52.636
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe Japan will get lucky one of these days and actually hit you correctly with a bomb.

20:52.978 --> 20:53.399
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow!

20:54.673 --> 20:55.214
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

21:20.404 --> 21:25.106
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, please take us away with an actual relating to the news type story.

21:25.186 --> 21:25.886
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be wonderful.

21:27.667 --> 21:28.468
[SPEAKER_02]: We do news here?

21:29.288 --> 21:31.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a while we are known to do that.

21:31.809 --> 21:32.629
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we do that for?

21:35.971 --> 21:37.371
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we drop the Wii controllers on her now?

21:39.152 --> 21:42.294
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well I do have a little bit of news.

21:42.314 --> 21:49.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, Konami is doing the big pitch for the DDR for school.

21:50.836 --> 21:54.644
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, because they were so successful in West Virginia or wherever?

21:54.664 --> 21:55.366
[SPEAKER_11]: West Virginia.

21:55.526 --> 21:57.651
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, they're trying to sell all the other states now on this?

21:57.671 --> 22:00.416
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to make DDR part of public school curriculum.

22:02.557 --> 22:03.538
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't look at me like that.

22:04.538 --> 22:06.359
[SPEAKER_11]: I got an F in DDR.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.321
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

22:09.021 --> 22:14.545
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, this has been done at other schools with a very high success rate.

22:15.365 --> 22:21.109
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have actually gotten in better shape and lost weight through playing DDR.

22:21.449 --> 22:22.590
[SPEAKER_04]: I, at first...

22:23.450 --> 22:27.712
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because I moved out here, got happy, you know, and got really fat.

22:28.493 --> 22:31.195
[SPEAKER_04]: And then started playing DDR and dropped 20 pounds over a summer.

22:31.495 --> 22:33.696
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I can vouch for personal experience.

22:34.576 --> 22:37.538
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but I think it's a really good thing.

22:37.658 --> 22:39.379
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I do like the little comment from here.

22:39.819 --> 22:45.763
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about looking for all the YouTube and Google videos about their classmates playing DDR.

22:46.083 --> 22:46.603
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

22:46.683 --> 22:47.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

22:48.064 --> 22:48.645
[SPEAKER_04]: Comedy.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.446
[SPEAKER_12]: I still can't wait for somebody to come home.

22:50.666 --> 22:52.026
[SPEAKER_12]: I got an F in DDR.

22:53.530 --> 22:57.031
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you don't hear them pitching in the groove to schools.

22:57.351 --> 22:57.611
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

22:57.631 --> 22:59.812
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you mean they got an E in DDR?

23:00.712 --> 23:02.012
[SPEAKER_11]: With a boo.

23:02.032 --> 23:02.472
[SPEAKER_11]: Failed.

23:03.432 --> 23:05.473
[SPEAKER_04]: You should practice in a closet.

23:07.093 --> 23:09.774
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my PE teacher should be the nurse from Solo 2000.

23:10.174 --> 23:12.095
[SPEAKER_02]: She's so amazing.

23:12.135 --> 23:13.275
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stand it.

23:16.056 --> 23:16.956
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to marry her.

23:17.196 --> 23:17.496
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

23:18.316 --> 23:21.197
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out in a classroom near you if Konami gets their way.

23:21.553 --> 23:22.513
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I'm in college.

23:47.500 --> 23:54.863
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be chopped down to episodes each containing about 30-40 minutes of gameplay that ends with a cliffhanger and preview of things to come.

23:56.924 --> 23:57.204
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

23:57.965 --> 24:01.166
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I've never been so... eh, in my life.

24:01.746 --> 24:03.207
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds like Shenmue, except...

24:03.792 --> 24:04.653
[SPEAKER_12]: Somehow worse.

24:05.053 --> 24:06.374
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it sounds interesting.

24:06.414 --> 24:07.354
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the idea of an episode.

24:07.374 --> 24:11.377
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds okay, but how expensive is this going to be?

24:11.777 --> 24:13.979
[SPEAKER_12]: You said 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay?

24:13.999 --> 24:15.239
[SPEAKER_12]: 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay.

24:15.420 --> 24:16.020
[SPEAKER_12]: Each episode.

24:16.040 --> 24:19.942
[SPEAKER_12]: Each episode would probably be about $5 on Xbox Live or something like that.

24:19.983 --> 24:22.904
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about people who buy DVD shows.

24:23.305 --> 24:24.225
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the same type of thing.

24:24.245 --> 24:26.967
[SPEAKER_02]: You watch a couple episodes, you take a break, come back.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.408
[SPEAKER_02]: People watch 24 on DVD.

24:28.708 --> 24:30.549
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what save points were invented for.

24:32.511 --> 24:33.011
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

24:33.993 --> 24:35.734
[SPEAKER_02]: and neither does Eden Games apparently.

24:35.754 --> 24:37.855
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an interesting idea.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.056
[SPEAKER_02]: If done right, it might be neat.

24:39.216 --> 24:42.318
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's under $10 an episode thing, then that's okay.

24:42.578 --> 24:43.418
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if the game's good.

24:43.458 --> 24:44.819
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it depends on how good the game is.

24:45.059 --> 24:47.361
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to pay $10 for 30 minutes of gameplay.

24:47.381 --> 24:48.141
[SPEAKER_12]: This shit better be like $2.

24:50.062 --> 24:50.542
[SPEAKER_02]: Even less.

24:51.783 --> 24:54.865
[SPEAKER_02]: Like iTunes charges $1.99 for a 40 minute TV show.

24:56.466 --> 24:58.087
[SPEAKER_02]: I like $1.99 should be the price.

24:59.187 --> 24:59.668
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see though.

25:00.228 --> 25:02.209
[SPEAKER_12]: How about the game not suck first and let's just

25:03.197 --> 25:09.281

[SPEAKER_02]: Rayman Raving Rabbids will also be on the Wii.

[SPEAKER_02]: Should be interesting.

27:11.954 --> 27:16.055
[SPEAKER_02]: Rainbow Six Vegas for the PS2, PS3, and both Xboxes.

27:16.595 --> 27:19.096

27:32.922 --> 27:41.566
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Ubisoft is supposed to do some type of next-gen and PC game from the folks who did TimeSplitters, but not a lot of more details just yet.

27:41.586 --> 27:42.466
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, but TimeSplitters 4.

27:44.047 --> 27:44.447
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

27:44.467 --> 27:45.928
[SPEAKER_12]: TimeSplitters is fucking awesome.

[SPEAKER_12]: NASCAR 2007 on the PSP, Orcs and Elves on mobile games,

28:33.449 --> 29:02.841

29:03.462 --> 29:04.402
[SPEAKER_12]: Should be pretty cool.

29:07.863 --> 29:08.164
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

29:09.324 --> 29:11.225
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we could have a little bit of a roundtable here.

29:11.425 --> 29:16.546
[SPEAKER_02]: Top three things we are looking forward to at E3 besides the Wii and the PlayStation 3.

29:16.786 --> 29:17.927
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the easy answers.

29:18.767 --> 29:19.787
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody want to go first?

29:20.487 --> 29:21.048
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody?

29:21.128 --> 29:21.888
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Miklatov.

29:22.628 --> 29:25.049
[SPEAKER_11]: Luminous 2 for the PSP.

29:25.789 --> 29:26.389
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that your number one?

29:26.890 --> 29:27.190
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

29:27.630 --> 29:28.130
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, your number three?

29:28.150 --> 29:28.930
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's my number three.

29:28.950 --> 29:29.830
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give this three to one.

29:30.251 --> 29:31.231
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, can't we...

29:31.946 --> 29:34.127
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I have time to think about my two-in-one?

29:34.567 --> 29:35.007
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

29:36.347 --> 29:59.854
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually kind of excited about seeing, well, I was hoping to see Take-Two's lineup this year, because I would have been looking forward to seeing Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories, but assuming I probably won't see that, I guess the next best thing would probably be seeing a Wii version of WarioWare, because that looks like fun.

30:00.393 --> 30:02.574
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura Taking a nap under Squeenix's movie theater

30:15.237 --> 30:19.821
[SPEAKER_02]: My number three would be the DDRs.

30:20.782 --> 30:23.445
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many of them that I'm very curious to see what's going to happen there.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.087
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming we're right, but we are.

30:26.828 --> 30:31.994
[SPEAKER_11]: My number two would be Luminous for PS2.

30:35.557 --> 30:35.938
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

30:36.518 --> 30:37.840
[SPEAKER_12]: Weird Drinks for 7 for the PS3.

30:39.244 --> 30:39.724
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Konami,

31:05.401 --> 31:07.142
[SPEAKER_02]: because their list was not that.

31:07.242 --> 31:08.463
[SPEAKER_02]: Chrono Trigger 3!

31:08.503 --> 31:14.188
[SPEAKER_12]: 7 Remake, Crisis Core, and... You think the 7 Remakes?

31:14.208 --> 31:20.553
[SPEAKER_12]: 7 Remake, Crisis Core, the... Oh, what the fuck is that stupid one that's on cell phones right now?

31:21.374 --> 31:22.014
[SPEAKER_02]: Before Crisis.

31:22.515 --> 31:23.496
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Before Crisis.

31:23.696 --> 31:25.097
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be ported to the PSP.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.499
[SPEAKER_12]: You think Indurgis Service?

31:27.519 --> 31:29.500
[SPEAKER_12]: Indurgis Service is coming out next month.

31:29.961 --> 31:31.682
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, not next month, two months from now.

31:32.082 --> 31:33.624
[SPEAKER_12]: July, so... Of course.

31:33.824 --> 31:35.065
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already out in Japan.

31:36.499 --> 31:36.819
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

32:06.573 --> 32:09.615
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to seeing which Japanese gaming celebrity I'm going to run into this year.

32:09.875 --> 32:11.356
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping for Yuji Naka.

32:11.577 --> 32:21.684
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking forward to seeing Paris Hilton at her booth trying to promote some cell phone game and asking her stupid questions and getting it all on film.

32:22.064 --> 32:23.105
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you should get her autograph.

32:23.953 --> 32:24.313
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

32:25.954 --> 32:27.416
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatop stole my number one.

32:27.456 --> 32:29.577
[SPEAKER_02]: My number one was the Luminous games.

32:30.618 --> 32:31.779
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine, it's three on mine.

32:31.839 --> 32:32.779
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because you suck.

32:32.980 --> 32:36.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Squeenix, by the way, we want Chrono Trigger for the DS.

32:36.742 --> 32:38.604
[SPEAKER_11]: And we want freaking Einhander 2.

32:38.964 --> 32:41.766
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Einhander 2 would be the best thing ever.

32:41.786 --> 32:42.447
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Einhander.

32:42.487 --> 32:44.148
[SPEAKER_04]: We broke that game out not too long ago.

32:44.168 --> 32:45.949
[SPEAKER_12]: I played it like a month ago.

32:46.049 --> 32:52.394
[SPEAKER_12]: If they're going to make an Einhander game, and since they don't really want to do that much work for it, port it over to the PSP.

32:53.314 --> 32:54.915
[SPEAKER_11]: or a better system.

32:55.256 --> 32:56.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, comments in the chat room.

32:57.017 --> 32:57.117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

32:57.157 --> 32:58.398
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't want to ignore you guys.

32:58.418 --> 32:58.798
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

32:59.739 --> 33:03.041
[SPEAKER_02]: TetrisDSManiac64 says, Duke Nukem Forever.

33:03.581 --> 33:04.142
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

33:04.382 --> 33:05.663
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I hope to see that there.

33:05.983 --> 33:06.503
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.566
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, 23rdMagus says, fucking StarCraft Ghost.

33:09.886 --> 33:10.806
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, wasn't that cancelled?

33:10.866 --> 33:12.127
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not coming out.

33:12.167 --> 33:12.748
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to say.

33:13.188 --> 33:14.129
[SPEAKER_02]: On, uh, current gen at least.

33:14.729 --> 33:15.450
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, maybe later.

33:16.530 --> 33:21.134
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, GS191 says, Squeenix should just remake the whole damn FF series.

33:21.274 --> 33:21.714
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it time.

33:22.795 --> 33:22.855
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh,

33:24.189 --> 33:24.589
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy 3, Loki,

33:46.437 --> 33:48.318
[SPEAKER_02]: A website I used to visit an awful lot.

33:48.699 --> 33:50.040
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I want to visit it anymore.

33:50.100 --> 33:50.660
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would this be?

33:51.100 --> 33:51.481
[SPEAKER_12]: Me too.

33:52.101 --> 33:59.907
[SPEAKER_12]: Alakazam used to be a really good website that was actually pretty much a hub for anything online.

34:01.348 --> 34:03.249
[SPEAKER_12]: Meaning games, like Final Fantasy XI.

34:03.309 --> 34:05.871
[SPEAKER_12]: Online games, yeah, like MMOs and stuff.

34:07.232 --> 34:09.473
[SPEAKER_12]: The thing is, though, is they just got bought out.

34:09.714 --> 34:13.856
[SPEAKER_12]: And they got bought out by a website called ZAM.

34:14.257 --> 34:15.157
[SPEAKER_12]: The ZAM Network.

34:15.438 --> 34:15.938
[SPEAKER_12]: Z-A-M.

34:16.573 --> 34:45.956
[SPEAKER_12]: which happens to be also like um owned there's a bunch of different chains of websites but it all comes back to one website that really gets people's panties in a bunch and that would be IGE which is best known for kill selling gold selling you name it they sell it ooh yuck and they own that website now so um sucks if you're still visiting that cause yeah lots of uh

34:47.728 --> 34:48.449
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of problems there.

34:48.609 --> 34:50.432
[SPEAKER_02]: Mikotov, you surf Alakazam.

34:50.452 --> 34:51.453
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the reaction been like there?

34:52.295 --> 35:00.747
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's angry and most of the posts I saw said that everybody was canceling their premium accounts as soon as they run up for the month.

35:01.528 --> 35:04.072
[SPEAKER_11]: So not too many people are happy about this, I guess.

35:04.608 --> 35:06.909
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, Atlas was selling the premium accounts.

35:07.109 --> 35:10.190
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, oh, it funds the dirty gill sellers.

35:10.270 --> 35:10.930
[SPEAKER_11]: Time to quit.

35:12.171 --> 35:16.272
[SPEAKER_11]: I still like Alakazam because it has information, but I'm not going to pay them money.

35:17.832 --> 35:19.473
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't want to pay them money in the first place.

35:19.513 --> 35:20.453
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wouldn't pay them money either.

35:20.473 --> 35:21.634
[SPEAKER_11]: I can still use their search feature.

35:21.694 --> 35:22.474
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet is free!

35:22.894 --> 35:23.214
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.

35:24.174 --> 35:24.755
[SPEAKER_11]: Net zero, $9.95.

35:25.275 --> 35:26.275
[SPEAKER_11]: That's free.

35:26.315 --> 35:28.556
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you feel about gill selling, gold selling?

35:28.596 --> 35:29.176
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

35:30.857 --> 35:31.637
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about it.

35:34.454 --> 35:34.794
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah.

35:35.395 --> 35:39.719
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if somebody were screwing up Ragnarok's economy that same way, you'd care about it mighty quick, I bet.

35:40.420 --> 35:41.521
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't play on IRO.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.665
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so you're stealing your Ragnarok.

35:46.265 --> 35:47.367
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not stealing my Ragnarok.

35:47.387 --> 35:50.129
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody else is stealing it, and I'm just, you know... You're just borrowing it.

35:50.149 --> 35:50.750
[SPEAKER_04]: ...whoring them out.

35:50.770 --> 35:57.556
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, though, like on our new server in Final Fantasy, I haven't heard anybody talk about any gill sellers whatsoever, so it's good.

35:57.596 --> 35:58.157
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're all gone.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.782
[SPEAKER_11]: or they're not a problem on this server.

36:00.982 --> 36:01.322
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

36:01.983 --> 36:09.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down and find a good website that does deserve your attention and isn't going to sell out to gill sellers or gold sellers.

36:10.531 --> 36:12.834
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what website did you pick this week?

36:13.804 --> 36:17.226
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually one of the sites that I think is pretty cool is Silent Hill Heaven.

36:18.687 --> 36:21.829
[SPEAKER_04]: I go there all the time looking at pictures and stuff and it's pretty cool.

36:22.249 --> 36:33.356
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get pictures of weapons from the endings, screen captures, fan art, and they even have a translation on here that they were working on for the Silent Hill play novels.

36:35.584 --> 36:43.367
[SPEAKER_04]: For anyone who's probably heard me mention this before, the play novel was Japan only on the Game Boy, and it was running through two scenarios.

36:43.888 --> 36:49.530
[SPEAKER_04]: One where you play as Harry, and the other one where you play as Sybil.

36:50.558 --> 36:57.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, from what I understand, there was actually supposed to be a scenario with Sybil in the first game that never made it in.

36:57.747 --> 37:02.852
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is more what her story was like along different ending lines.

37:03.974 --> 37:06.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of it is there, only part of it is there, but it's pretty cool.

37:07.218 --> 37:08.079
[SPEAKER_04]: They're working on it.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.877
[SPEAKER_04]: They also, like I mentioned, have tons of pictures, tons of information.

37:13.318 --> 37:23.406
[SPEAKER_04]: They have stuff from the DVDs, The Lost Memories and Art of Silent Hill, Fanfic Gallery, I'm sorry, Fanfic Archive, Fan Art Gallery, all kinds of neat stuff.

37:24.447 --> 37:28.470
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to SilentHillHeaven.com and just click on their image, it actually takes you to their forums.

37:28.931 --> 37:37.858
[SPEAKER_04]: So go to SilentHillHeaven.com slash site, that's capitalized, slash main, also capitalized, slash main.php, which is lowercase.

37:38.416 --> 37:40.758
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's case sensitive or not, so that's why I'm saying so.

37:40.778 --> 37:41.979
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

37:42.379 --> 37:43.400
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's pretty neato.

37:43.580 --> 37:45.102
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out now or Pyramid Head will kill you.

37:46.943 --> 37:47.744
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky.

37:49.105 --> 37:50.626
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll do other things first.

37:50.646 --> 37:54.229
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to open up the Skype line very, very soon here.

37:54.249 --> 38:02.016
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to call in and say hello, give us your opinion on whatever, you head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us, and all the details are right there.

38:02.036 --> 38:03.597
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also pick up the phone and call us.

38:04.265 --> 38:09.210
[SPEAKER_02]: 916-226-9067 is the telephono number so check it out.

38:11.052 --> 38:18.399
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to check out real quickly the Hideo blog, that's Hideo Kojima's blog there, there is a little

38:19.019 --> 38:19.800
[SPEAKER_02]: MetaGearSolid4

38:49.741 --> 38:55.083
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall we go to the telephones, the Skype lines, and see who's calling us today?

38:56.463 --> 38:57.764
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

38:59.464 --> 39:01.565
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, guys?

39:01.705 --> 39:02.385
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, who's this?

39:02.465 --> 39:03.205
[SPEAKER_02]: It's DMN.

39:03.705 --> 39:04.906
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, DMN.

39:05.006 --> 39:06.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn down your outgoing a little bit.

39:06.386 --> 39:07.147
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hear ourselves.

39:07.747 --> 39:08.267
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

39:11.869 --> 39:12.230
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

39:12.390 --> 39:19.314
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a couple of bits of news out of the Nintendo camp that I think I can share without getting my head cut off.

39:19.675 --> 39:20.896
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I like this.

39:21.016 --> 39:23.317
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this controversial news.

39:23.637 --> 39:25.779
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope one of them is what I think it is.

39:26.359 --> 39:26.940
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.160
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you share with us?

39:28.961 --> 39:30.662
[SPEAKER_10]: I can share some price news.

39:31.563 --> 39:31.683
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

39:33.744 --> 39:40.949
[SPEAKER_10]: The $79.99 I've been hearing floating around quite some time, so likely I've been hearing about

39:41.658 --> 39:42.879
[SPEAKER_10]: Mid-August, that might happen.

39:44.921 --> 39:50.307
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, when the DS Lite is released, it is likely that the regular DS model will drop to $99.99.

39:54.271 --> 39:56.513
[SPEAKER_10]: But other than that, I really haven't heard any other news.

39:56.753 --> 39:58.134
[SPEAKER_10]: Where were you guys at the soccer account?

39:58.535 --> 40:05.622
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, can you confirm about Osutatakaya Landon being bought out as Elite Task Agent?

40:08.157 --> 40:09.098
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard nothing of that.

40:10.239 --> 40:12.021
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a rumor about that today, too.

40:12.181 --> 40:15.745
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's very cool, though, those rumors about the DS.

40:15.865 --> 40:22.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess not so much rumors at this point, but the DS coming down to 99, the old school one, and the GameCube going down to 79.99.

40:23.592 --> 40:24.113
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

40:25.234 --> 40:28.017
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I heard in there as well, where the hell were you at SakuraCon?

40:28.417 --> 40:35.402
[SPEAKER_02]: It just came up a little late for us, but we will definitely try to get up there next year because I miss Seattle.

40:35.442 --> 40:36.463
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do like it up there.

40:36.883 --> 40:39.145
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually planning on going to Vancouver at the end of June.

40:40.265 --> 40:42.407
[SPEAKER_04]: I've wanted to go to Sakura for a while.

40:42.447 --> 40:45.189
[SPEAKER_10]: I will arrange passes.

40:45.629 --> 40:46.329
[SPEAKER_10]: You will arrange what?

40:46.349 --> 40:48.531
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm repeating game manager this year.

40:49.411 --> 40:52.774
[SPEAKER_10]: I can arrange for some passes for you guys.

40:53.494 --> 40:53.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

40:53.855 --> 40:54.815
[SPEAKER_02]: We like passes.

40:55.055 --> 40:57.237
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they get us backstage so we can meet rock stars?

40:59.342 --> 41:00.283
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, we'll see.

41:00.563 --> 41:00.963
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

41:01.784 --> 41:02.084
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

41:03.305 --> 41:05.246
[SPEAKER_02]: DMN, thanks so much for calling in.

41:05.266 --> 41:07.067
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else you wanted to get out before we hang up on you?

41:08.808 --> 41:10.729
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no.

41:11.069 --> 41:12.530
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, then have a good one.

41:12.750 --> 41:13.330
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for calling.

41:15.172 --> 41:16.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we appreciate that.

41:16.092 --> 41:18.333
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of the insider knowledge there on Nintendo.

41:18.834 --> 41:19.194
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

41:19.934 --> 41:20.455
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

41:20.575 --> 41:24.097
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go and answer this one.

41:24.997 --> 41:25.858
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

41:27.352 --> 41:27.632
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

41:28.113 --> 41:29.634
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, something exploded, right?

41:29.654 --> 41:30.414
[SPEAKER_02]: It's picked up the phone.

41:30.434 --> 41:31.515
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like someone dropped a keyboard.

41:31.615 --> 41:33.276
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, someone set us up the bomb.

41:33.316 --> 41:33.716
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

41:34.777 --> 41:36.098
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Sephiroth1215.

41:36.138 --> 41:37.739
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

41:38.900 --> 41:48.646
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I was wondering, will we be doing actual good coverage for the, you know, the Imani series this year?

41:48.766 --> 41:50.947
[SPEAKER_02]: Our coverage will be mediocre on all levels.

41:52.388 --> 41:56.231
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, like, because usually all sites, all other sites, they...

41:56.917 --> 41:57.337
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

41:57.357 --> 41:57.457
[SPEAKER_01]: Also...

42:26.036 --> 42:32.659
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually made a short list of, um, things I noticed when I was playing Supernova not too long ago.

42:33.159 --> 42:33.519
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

42:35.460 --> 42:54.567
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I'm gonna try to go as fast as I can, but, um, um, I could say that I don't like the, um, there's a new mode select style because of the, um, uh, the all music is all the way down, you have to go all the way past to, um, the, uh, the, uh,

42:55.151 --> 42:55.571
[SPEAKER_11]: Nevermind.

42:55.591 --> 42:56.893
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

42:57.814 --> 43:00.937
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's a problem that we just took care of.

43:02.218 --> 43:02.358
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

43:02.378 --> 43:04.501
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I'm just trying to go too fast.

43:04.601 --> 43:05.101
[SPEAKER_01]: That's alright.

43:05.261 --> 43:10.947
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, hopefully we'll have news on Supernova Consumer Style at E3 next week.

43:10.987 --> 43:11.348
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

43:12.128 --> 43:15.672
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, otherwise, I could just say good things about it, really.

43:17.494 --> 43:18.515
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I look like, it

43:19.048 --> 43:25.573
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much done and I guess the memory card slots might be appearing because of pictures recently.

43:39.233 --> 43:41.054
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, I'm going to let you go, buddy.

43:41.354 --> 43:43.354
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, and enjoy your DDR.

43:43.534 --> 43:53.157
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you take the next call, Rob, I have a DMN wanting me to share with everybody that there's a strong possibility of the new Earthbound series coming to the U.S.

43:53.237 --> 43:54.217
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank God.

43:54.397 --> 43:55.477
[SPEAKER_11]: They've heard our prayers.

43:55.577 --> 43:57.338
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard the new one's pretty mediocre, though.

43:58.498 --> 43:59.398
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still Mother.

43:59.418 --> 44:00.438
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still Earthbound.

44:01.179 --> 44:02.799
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make love to it all night long.

44:03.139 --> 44:04.820
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely have this if it comes out.

44:05.200 --> 44:06.180
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Limes Radio.

44:06.200 --> 44:06.540
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

44:07.557 --> 44:09.439
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Xander from somewhere.

44:09.639 --> 44:10.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Xander from somewhere.

44:10.820 --> 44:13.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the new icon on your Skype.

44:13.302 --> 44:15.284
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the Rez game icon there.

44:15.324 --> 44:15.605
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

44:15.645 --> 44:15.965
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

44:18.307 --> 44:19.228
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a whole lot.

44:20.109 --> 44:24.453
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a theory on why they don't have any groove in the schools instead of DDR.

44:24.593 --> 44:25.334
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it sucks?

44:25.534 --> 44:26.275
[SPEAKER_02]: No, hold on.

44:26.355 --> 44:28.477
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, because the kids are too fat to play it.

44:31.613 --> 44:32.353
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, though.

44:33.874 --> 44:37.736
[SPEAKER_02]: With that statement, you're just reaffirming the fact that In the Groove is not a game for beginners.

44:39.417 --> 44:40.798
[SPEAKER_11]: Or a game for sane people.

44:41.618 --> 44:42.999
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a game for people who like good games.

44:43.019 --> 44:44.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice.

44:44.740 --> 44:46.180
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, be nice.

44:47.201 --> 44:48.942
[SPEAKER_02]: Xander, please finish your thought.

44:49.002 --> 44:50.743
[SPEAKER_02]: I will hold these rude ones at bay.

44:54.217 --> 44:56.117
[SPEAKER_02]: I will turn these, look, I'm in front of the board.

44:56.157 --> 44:57.217
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn the mics off.

44:57.377 --> 44:57.977
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch me do it.

44:58.058 --> 44:59.158
[SPEAKER_04]: I can throw stuff at you from here.

44:59.278 --> 44:59.758
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do it.

44:59.978 --> 45:00.298
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll throw.

45:00.598 --> 45:01.738
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my hand on the cord.

45:01.778 --> 45:02.659
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, my hand's on the cord.

45:02.679 --> 45:03.439
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.

45:03.479 --> 45:06.539
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Xander, what's on your mind?

45:06.639 --> 45:10.220
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just saying that everybody in West Virginia is a fat hillbilly.

45:11.801 --> 45:17.622
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if those folks in West Virginia can address those cards and letters to Xander, care of our forums, okay?

45:18.658 --> 45:23.802
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, for this summer, I'm doing this choir trip, and that's actually where we're going, is West Virginia.

45:24.923 --> 45:26.824
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that you really need to know that.

45:26.844 --> 45:27.745
[SPEAKER_02]: What choir is that?

45:28.845 --> 45:30.427
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a thing for a church.

45:31.067 --> 45:31.407
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

45:31.888 --> 45:35.791
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not very Christian of you to call them all fat hillbillies.

45:35.811 --> 45:42.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people in West Virginia be waiting for just all the church choirs that come through.

45:42.716 --> 45:45.738
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask for Xander, and when you find him, kick his ass.

45:46.613 --> 45:58.058
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how he said that the kids are all fat and they can handle DDR, but it's mostly because those kids are not elitist pricks and that's why they can handle ITG.

46:00.159 --> 46:01.140
[SPEAKER_11]: Xander, witty retort?

46:03.140 --> 46:03.961
[SPEAKER_09]: I like In the Groove.

46:04.321 --> 46:04.661
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you do.

46:04.681 --> 46:06.142
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing it a lot recently.

46:06.342 --> 46:06.882
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you do.

46:08.143 --> 46:09.443
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't listen to the haters, Xander.

46:10.744 --> 46:11.704
[SPEAKER_04]: It has neat music.

46:12.044 --> 46:13.705
[SPEAKER_04]: The steps are kind of crap.

46:13.825 --> 46:15.006
[SPEAKER_11]: Kidwhatever was a nice guy.

46:15.956 --> 46:18.258
[SPEAKER_11]: I like Life of a Butterfly, that's about it.

46:18.298 --> 46:19.659
[SPEAKER_04]: I like, which MC was that?

46:19.999 --> 46:21.321
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I don't care.

46:21.361 --> 46:22.381
[SPEAKER_04]: I like MC Friend a lot.

46:22.722 --> 46:24.443
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Xander, anything else?

46:25.924 --> 46:31.729
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question, like, do you know any video game news websites in Spanish?

46:32.770 --> 46:34.692
[SPEAKER_02]: Video game news websites in Spanish?

46:35.993 --> 46:37.434
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio run through Alta Vista?

46:37.494 --> 46:38.015
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know.

46:38.035 --> 46:38.995
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know of any off the top of my head.

46:39.015 --> 46:40.196
[SPEAKER_04]: I found one, I think.

46:41.397 --> 46:44.320
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I usually find them in, like, German and Russian.

46:46.207 --> 46:47.067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Spanish.

46:47.267 --> 46:49.428
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is not Spanish, so I'll have to hunt it down.

46:49.668 --> 46:51.149
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you say video game in Espanol?

46:51.429 --> 46:52.309
[SPEAKER_02]: Video game-o.

46:53.229 --> 46:54.810
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not video game-o.

46:55.310 --> 46:56.670
[SPEAKER_02]: El video game?

46:57.551 --> 46:58.771
[SPEAKER_09]: No, huecos de video.

46:59.271 --> 46:59.671
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

46:59.691 --> 47:00.391
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that in Google.

47:01.992 --> 47:04.093
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried, and it didn't really give me anything.

47:05.513 --> 47:06.513
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going on the hunt now.

47:06.553 --> 47:07.474
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a personal challenge.

47:07.514 --> 47:07.814
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

47:08.034 --> 47:10.614
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned to chat room, but we're going to let you go so we can take another call, all right?

47:11.375 --> 47:11.515
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

47:11.535 --> 47:11.735
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

47:11.955 --> 47:12.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

47:14.451 --> 47:16.493
[SPEAKER_11]: Why does he always try to start a fight?

47:17.654 --> 47:19.095
[SPEAKER_02]: It's every time you're here, too.

47:19.175 --> 47:20.917
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't bring up in the groove unless you're here.

47:21.637 --> 47:24.920
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll come back with, you know, correct answers and the truth.

47:25.460 --> 47:26.461
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the next call.

47:26.481 --> 47:27.842
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

47:30.505 --> 47:31.085
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not.

47:31.526 --> 47:33.888
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

47:35.989 --> 47:39.873
[SPEAKER_02]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

47:42.438 --> 47:43.138
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, no one's there.

47:43.198 --> 47:44.519
[SPEAKER_02]: The volume's too low, dude.

47:44.539 --> 47:45.320
[SPEAKER_02]: We gotta let you go.

47:45.420 --> 47:46.120
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to somebody else.

47:46.380 --> 47:47.541
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

47:48.062 --> 47:48.642
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Sky.

47:48.742 --> 47:49.662
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Raven Stolfen.

47:49.803 --> 47:50.663
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Raven Stolfen.

47:50.683 --> 47:51.243
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

47:52.824 --> 47:57.387
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what's on my mind is those press conferences that before E3.

47:57.607 --> 47:57.828
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

47:59.108 --> 47:59.789
[SPEAKER_08]: On our mind, too.

48:00.569 --> 48:02.510
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one is you most excited for?

48:02.791 --> 48:06.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo, because they're holding the biggest package in their pants still.

48:08.257 --> 48:09.558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it's the Wii.

48:10.599 --> 48:11.219
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it!

48:11.940 --> 48:15.683
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm interested in seeing PlayStation, or Sonys, and Nintendos.

48:16.083 --> 48:21.107
[SPEAKER_12]: Microsoft, I couldn't care, because they're, well, now it's probably Halo 3, which, oh my god, I didn't know that was coming out.

48:21.668 --> 48:23.069
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.

48:23.089 --> 48:29.314
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Xbox may, I'm looking forward to all of them, because I think Xbox may, I want to know if they're going to say anything about HD DVD.

48:29.374 --> 48:31.616
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I, I just want to know if they're going to even go there.

48:31.876 --> 48:32.556
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to laugh at them.

48:33.537 --> 48:34.198
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, stop.

48:34.258 --> 48:34.838
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fine.

48:34.858 --> 48:35.439
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong.

48:35.459 --> 48:35.579
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

48:36.713 --> 48:37.193
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the E3 on PSP.

48:37.213 --> 48:38.094
[SPEAKER_08]: That made me very giddy as hell.

48:38.114 --> 48:38.474
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're glad.

49:05.903 --> 49:09.869
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm glad there's a lot of diversity on Orange Lounge Radio.

49:09.929 --> 49:17.218
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a girl, there's a gay guy, and there is a straight married dude that just loves Windows to death.

49:19.505 --> 49:43.204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, we're an odd pairing of people, but, you know, we like games, and I like the fact that we're just... I think part of what makes our show so interesting, if I can have an ego here for a minute, is what I like about this program is that we don't make it any secret that we have lives outside of gaming, and sometimes we're a little tongue-in-cheek with our gaming, but we're real, you know, and that's just what we want to bring to you guys.

49:43.264 --> 49:44.685
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, a real show.

49:45.105 --> 49:45.425
[SPEAKER_02]: I think...

49:46.226 --> 49:57.035
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of what I really liked about the show I used to be on, Under Sedation Live, that I'm trying to bring over here to Orange Lounge Radio, was the fact that it just sounded like a bunch of people at Denny's sitting around talking shit.

49:57.415 --> 49:58.456
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we do here.

49:58.496 --> 50:05.342
[SPEAKER_02]: We just kind of sit around and talk and let you guys all eavesdrop in on it and participate in the big thing as well.

50:06.463 --> 50:10.146
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't do it so much in the beginning, but now we can let you guys join us at the big table.

50:10.446 --> 50:10.607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

50:11.267 --> 50:13.008
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, one more thing about the wedding.

50:14.428 --> 50:18.890
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to a Jewish wedding, and yeah, they do have the little chairs up in the air.

50:20.630 --> 50:25.592
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we didn't do it because her relatives weren't getting up and doing anything.

50:25.612 --> 50:27.412
[SPEAKER_12]: Another thing that got botched at your wedding.

50:27.812 --> 50:29.293
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, at least you didn't get hurt.

50:30.013 --> 50:30.994
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

50:31.094 --> 50:33.514
[SPEAKER_08]: Because my sister got hurt in that.

50:35.055 --> 50:35.335
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

50:37.428 --> 50:40.430
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe those weddings should come with disclaimers to be more careful.

50:40.670 --> 50:40.970
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

50:40.990 --> 50:41.771
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course weddings.

50:41.991 --> 50:45.572
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no problem with them, but, you know, I've been in one.

50:45.873 --> 50:46.233
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

50:46.753 --> 50:47.614
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we've got to let you go.

50:47.634 --> 50:48.414
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to talk games.

50:48.454 --> 50:49.334
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk weddings later.

50:49.875 --> 50:50.135
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

50:50.215 --> 50:50.815
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, later, dude.

50:50.975 --> 50:52.416
[SPEAKER_04]: I found Spanish video game sites.

50:52.616 --> 50:53.677
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

50:53.697 --> 50:55.718
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of them, and I used Google Mexico.

50:57.239 --> 50:58.299
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, good thought.

50:58.559 --> 50:59.940
[SPEAKER_04]: Google.com.mx.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.121
[SPEAKER_02]: What, Miklatov, what?

51:03.582 --> 51:05.263
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to censor me.

51:08.122 --> 51:08.942
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a free country.

51:10.203 --> 51:11.443
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's okay.

51:11.463 --> 51:14.164
[SPEAKER_11]: I just didn't know dirty Mexicans could use the internet.

51:15.705 --> 51:16.225
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

51:16.685 --> 51:17.025
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

51:17.925 --> 51:19.086
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bringing tequila to E3.

51:19.346 --> 51:19.706
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

51:20.846 --> 51:22.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

51:22.747 --> 51:29.369
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, uh... Sorry, but you're cutting out.

51:29.709 --> 51:33.551
[SPEAKER_02]: So all we heard was the hey, and then it went dead silent.

51:33.871 --> 51:34.311
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is this?

51:35.603 --> 51:36.483
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt.

51:36.583 --> 51:37.544
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, SSJ100 Matt.

51:37.564 --> 51:38.384
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

51:39.685 --> 51:41.726
[SPEAKER_07]: Mazel Tov on your wedding, Loki, by the way.

51:41.746 --> 51:42.726
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

51:42.746 --> 51:43.066
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

51:45.727 --> 52:01.814
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wanted to talk about when Sephiroth1215 called in, he was trying to explain... You know how in... Oh, you know, with Supernova, he was trying to explain... You know how in Konomics, you know how you had to select all songs in order to get all the songs?

52:03.495 --> 52:03.935
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

52:05.596 --> 52:07.656
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you kind of have to do that with Supernova.

52:08.877 --> 52:09.677
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of annoying.

52:09.857 --> 52:10.837
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really the end of the world?

52:11.697 --> 52:12.817
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's just kind of annoying.

52:12.877 --> 52:14.358
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really going to ruin the game for people?

52:15.418 --> 52:15.898
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

52:16.138 --> 52:17.318
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so what's the big fucking deal?

52:17.938 --> 52:18.278
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

52:18.979 --> 52:19.999
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, enough said.

52:20.399 --> 52:21.279
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is on your mind?

52:21.299 --> 52:22.139
[SPEAKER_07]: Problem solved.

52:22.179 --> 52:22.999
[SPEAKER_07]: Problem solved.

52:24.720 --> 52:30.741
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Uh... Uh... I don't know, that threw me off track.

52:31.001 --> 52:31.081
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

52:33.692 --> 52:34.873
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I got nothing else to say.

52:36.174 --> 52:36.635
[SPEAKER_07]: Gong.

52:37.516 --> 52:37.856
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

52:40.298 --> 52:42.821
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to do that to somebody all night long.

52:42.881 --> 52:43.261
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor guy.

52:43.741 --> 52:44.062
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

52:44.722 --> 52:48.446
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

52:50.768 --> 52:51.168
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

52:51.549 --> 52:52.329
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, who's this?

52:53.010 --> 52:54.271
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Hurricane Z-Man.

52:54.591 --> 52:55.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Hurricane what?

52:56.733 --> 52:57.134
[SPEAKER_06]: Z-Man.

52:57.434 --> 52:59.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Hurricane Z-Man, what's on your mind?

53:01.069 --> 53:05.112
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to know what you guys thought of Final Fantasy XII.

53:05.212 --> 53:10.855
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there isn't a whole lot out about it, but I was thoroughly disappointed with Final Fantasy XI.

53:11.856 --> 53:12.116
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

53:12.996 --> 53:13.857
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here's the thing.

53:15.157 --> 53:17.819
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI is a completely different game.

53:17.859 --> 53:20.200
[SPEAKER_02]: It took the Final Fantasy universe and turned it upside down.

53:20.260 --> 53:20.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

53:20.901 --> 53:28.165
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played the Final Fantasy XII demo, and I've played it twice now, essentially, because I played the E3 demo a couple years ago when they actually had it there.

53:28.305 --> 53:30.165
[SPEAKER_02]: That was stupid the first demo they had.

53:30.325 --> 53:33.646
[SPEAKER_02]: But the demo they put in with Dragon Quest VIII is great.

53:33.986 --> 53:39.648
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing that's great about it is that it fuses that Final Fantasy XI universe with the rest of it.

53:39.688 --> 53:46.529
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to say that to kind of put you off, but what I'm saying is that it kind of makes XI make sense.

53:46.929 --> 53:52.791
[SPEAKER_02]: Because honestly, in the scope of all the Final Fantasy games, I think the only one that XI has a lot in common with is II.

53:54.238 --> 53:58.941
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go and play Final Fantasy 2, it's actually very similar to 11 in some ways, without the whole real-time battle.

54:00.742 --> 54:01.242
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was 4.

54:02.703 --> 54:04.704
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.

54:04.724 --> 54:09.626
[SPEAKER_02]: 4 will forever be my favorite, with 6 a close runner-up, just because I'm a Super Nintendo brat.

54:09.987 --> 54:12.888
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think 12 is going to be really great.

54:14.569 --> 54:18.731
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard really good things from folks who've imported the Japanese version.

54:18.911 --> 54:22.073
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't bothered to look at it because I can't really understand Japanese anymore.

54:22.193 --> 54:26.254
[SPEAKER_02]: and I want my first experience with the game to be one that I understand fully.

54:27.174 --> 54:36.916
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't see many reasons why this will disappoint, but I think the only thing that's going to turn people off is the battle system, because it is a little more like XI's, but not... Which is crap.

54:37.456 --> 54:38.196
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is fun.

54:38.216 --> 54:47.397
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I like XI's battle system, and I think the problem that you had with XI was that you had to sit around and wait for a party, and then when you got one, the people were, you know, bossy.

54:47.417 --> 54:49.698
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid, retarded, brain damaged.

54:49.758 --> 54:51.198
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Final Fantasy XII, you're the boss.

54:51.929 --> 54:52.789
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all your bitches.

54:54.530 --> 54:55.610
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch of the White Mage.

54:55.990 --> 54:56.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

54:56.490 --> 54:56.730
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

54:57.371 --> 54:59.251
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that, dude?

54:59.291 --> 54:59.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds a lot better.

55:00.311 --> 55:01.072
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

55:01.112 --> 55:01.392
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

55:02.932 --> 55:05.233
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out the demo because Dragon Quest VIII is a great game.

55:06.353 --> 55:07.273
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to download that.

55:07.473 --> 55:07.713
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

55:08.394 --> 55:09.254
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, thanks, guys.

55:09.274 --> 55:10.954
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the great work with the show, guys.

55:11.054 --> 55:11.515
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem.

55:11.535 --> 55:12.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

55:12.035 --> 55:12.615
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, buddy.

55:13.175 --> 55:13.895
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for calling.

55:14.896 --> 55:16.216
[SPEAKER_02]: We like a good... We like a good...

55:17.734 --> 55:19.054
[SPEAKER_02]: Ego Inflation once in a while.

55:19.294 --> 55:20.855
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thanks for the phone calls, guys.

55:20.915 --> 55:22.915
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to those that got cut out tonight.

55:23.755 --> 55:25.216
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll take more later if we have time.

55:25.236 --> 55:28.237
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, we've got to get to the last minute stories.

55:29.137 --> 55:33.078
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody have a last minute story they want to share with our listeners?

55:35.598 --> 55:35.778
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

55:36.819 --> 55:37.599
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, I do, I do.

55:37.739 --> 55:39.259
[SPEAKER_04]: What, DarkSakura?

55:39.299 --> 55:40.279
[SPEAKER_04]: Yuri, lever link this to me.

55:41.340 --> 55:41.840
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony turned 60.

55:44.858 --> 56:14.175
[SPEAKER_04]: that was pretty cool hooray happy birthday basically they started May 7th 1946 by Ibuka Masaru who was a post-war engineering entrepreneur and started Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Totsuko with Akio Morita and the company basically became Sony happy happy birthday from all of us to you I can't sing and one more

[SPEAKER_02]: What?

56:15.828 --> 56:16.930
[SPEAKER_04]: New Perfect Dark content.

56:17.871 --> 56:17.971
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

56:18.191 --> 56:20.894
[SPEAKER_04]: For us three people who like Perfect Dark Zero.

56:20.974 --> 56:22.616
[SPEAKER_02]: I just couldn't get into that game, sorry.

56:23.037 --> 56:25.340
[SPEAKER_02]: I know why people would like it, but I just couldn't get into it.

56:26.392 --> 56:29.733
[SPEAKER_04]: They've actually put up the first round of downloadable content for Perfect Dark Zero.

56:29.853 --> 56:32.514
[SPEAKER_04]: You do have to wait a little bit longer, though, for the premium apps.

56:33.895 --> 56:41.318
[SPEAKER_04]: There's new bots available in Dark Ops multiplayer games as well as in Deathmatch that split into various new AIs.

56:43.278 --> 56:52.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft and Rare have put in some bug fixes that basically keep people from floating through the air, keeping the capture flags.

56:53.763 --> 56:55.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Receiving positive points for team killing.

56:55.904 --> 56:56.485
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big one.

56:58.226 --> 57:04.570
[SPEAKER_04]: They've just gone in and fixed a lot of the little bugs and glitches in the game as well as putting out the stuff.

57:06.211 --> 57:07.472
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

57:10.434 --> 57:11.054
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's it.

57:11.274 --> 57:12.916
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for tonight's program.

57:13.956 --> 57:14.417
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired.

57:14.457 --> 57:15.577
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready to go to E3.

57:15.697 --> 57:18.079
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready to pile in the car tomorrow and start driving to LA.

57:18.219 --> 57:19.280
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun times.

57:20.220 --> 57:23.863
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking forward to some sort of breakfast sandwich with egg and bacon.

57:24.904 --> 57:25.605
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're good.

57:25.805 --> 57:27.706
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going home and doing homework.

57:27.826 --> 57:29.147
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's wrap this up.

57:29.167 --> 57:30.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants to do my flash homework for me?

57:30.649 --> 57:31.389
[SPEAKER_02]: Not me, said the bee.

57:31.549 --> 57:32.390
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap this up.

57:32.610 --> 57:33.631
[SPEAKER_02]: Mikltov, final thought.

57:33.791 --> 57:34.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what?

57:34.272 --> 57:35.673
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I did have one more story.

57:35.833 --> 57:36.593
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn you.

57:36.694 --> 57:39.156
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, this is going to be extremely quick though.

57:40.056 --> 57:46.982
[SPEAKER_12]: If you are a fan of Bomani stuff, and this is Bomani related, Diverse Systems released a new album, Dear Mr. Tak.
