00:12.240 --> 00:15.480

00:15.480 --> 00:20.080
Now the conclusion of this weekís episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.520
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.520
Weíve had a pretty exciting episode so far.

00:24.520 --> 00:28.640
In case you missed the first half of the episode, go download it on the podcast stream and hear

00:28.640 --> 00:34.040
why October 18th we believe to be the Wii's release date, some pretty compelling evidence

00:34.040 --> 00:37.680
there, so check out part A. But meanwhile, let's get right into the news here in our

00:37.680 --> 00:39.520
part B segment.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.680
First off though, actually a programming note, I want to point out there will be no live

00:43.680 --> 00:49.280
program next week because we're actually taping our show for the first time in front of a

00:49.280 --> 00:51.580
live studio audience.

00:51.580 --> 00:56.360
And yeah, you could say the E3 Outpost was a live studio audience, but this is kind of

00:56.360 --> 00:57.360
a different element.

00:57.360 --> 01:00.560
We're actually going to be taping our show live at an anime convention.

01:00.560 --> 01:05.440
It's going to be at Faname, which is this huge anime expo in Northern California.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.480
And Loki, where is this happening at?

01:07.480 --> 01:08.480
San Jose.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.040
This is a huge anime expo.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.040
That was funny.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.040
Oh, not that.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.040
Not that.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.040
Not...

01:14.040 --> 01:15.040
You know what I mean.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.040
I know what you mean.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.280
Okay, it's something far superior to anime expo.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.280
Whatever, whatever.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.580
It is a convention that is happening that we're going to be at and doing our show live

01:22.580 --> 01:26.440
Saturday, 7 o'clock, panel room one.

01:26.440 --> 01:32.660
sure you bathe. Dark soccer will be there with Febreze. I will be there with Febreze

01:32.660 --> 01:38.640
and Deodorant. I will also be cosplaying. We're also doing a panel Sunday at 7 about

01:38.640 --> 01:42.260
podcasting but it's not the show being taped. We hope you come out to that anyway but that's

01:42.260 --> 01:46.000
not actually our show being taped. That's us talking about how to be podcasting superstars.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.080
We should record it anyways. Well, we might. I don't know. It can be a bonus thing for

01:51.080 --> 01:53.120
the Live Journal or the MySpacers, maybe.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.540
But, yeah, Saturday is the show, live.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.840
So the podcast feed will still have a show,

01:57.840 --> 01:59.680
but it's gonna be a really weird show.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.980
I'm warning you in advance.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.480
I have no idea what to expect

02:02.480 --> 02:03.760
when we throw a live audience into it,

02:03.760 --> 02:05.160
because we might get the, you know,

02:05.160 --> 02:06.840
it's just like when the people listen at home

02:06.840 --> 02:08.100
and then go, these guys suck.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.520
We're gonna get it, like, live.

02:09.520 --> 02:10.800
You suck!

02:10.800 --> 02:13.760
So it's gonna be very interesting.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.880
Just remember, even if you think we suck,

02:15.880 --> 02:18.700
we do this for free, and we don't get paid to do it,

02:18.700 --> 02:20.160
like some of those guys over at

02:20.160 --> 02:27.360
of the bigger websites you know so um just keep that in mind jerk all right we put as much effort

02:27.360 --> 02:36.160
into it as we get paid all right low-key getting into the news uh playstation 3 yes oh playstation

02:36.160 --> 02:45.520
3 what is wrong with you seriously can we start no but anyways um the big gripe with everyone

02:45.520 --> 02:50.880
in Playstation 3 is what games are going to be at launch and well, that's a good question

02:50.880 --> 02:53.360
because we don't really know.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.560
There's a lot of titles missing.

02:55.560 --> 03:05.880
For example, the CEO David Reeves of Sonic Fair Entertainment Europe mentioned that quite

03:05.880 --> 03:11.280
a few titles won't be making their launch date on November 17th.

03:11.280 --> 03:15.500
And here's basically the status kind of running down things of certain titles that they definitely

03:15.500 --> 03:21.860
showed at E3. First one, Sing Star. Certainly before Christmas, but it doesn't really say

03:21.860 --> 03:28.180
at launch. An Itoy game will be available after Christmas. Itoy is not playable at the

03:28.180 --> 03:35.180
moment, but it will come before March 2007. Oh, that's good. Sooner than ever. Heavenly

03:36.100 --> 03:42.900
Sword Formula One Motorstorm will not come out until after Christmas. Resistance Fall

03:42.900 --> 03:47.020
a Man will certainly be the launch title. I'm glad one of those is actually going to

03:47.020 --> 03:54.020
be available. Um, so, you know, which 15 launch titles are supposed to be there? Who knows.

03:55.300 --> 04:02.300
But um, well I know a couple of them but yeah. Oh do you? I'm not sharing that. Well, for

04:02.340 --> 04:07.680
example, one of them that actually most websites have been mentioning, Fear is going to be

04:07.680 --> 04:11.040
on the PlayStation 3 at launch. How do you know this?

04:11.040 --> 04:14.920
Because we have it in our system.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.920
It's gonna be launched day and date with the 360. Interesting.

04:18.920 --> 04:23.420
That's a pretty bold announcement there. Nobody else has mentioned that.

04:23.420 --> 04:26.880
Warhawk was another one I know that's gonna be launched.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.080
There's a bunch of other ones. Are you sure, Fear?

04:30.080 --> 04:35.040
Yeah. Wow. We have a listing for PlayStation 3. Wasn't Xbox 360 that supposed to be like their niche

04:35.040 --> 04:40.120
thing? I don't know. They announced it for the 360 and never said it was exclusive to the 360.

04:40.120 --> 04:43.360
But your systems contradict that? Yep.

04:43.360 --> 04:48.160
Alright. We have it for, we actually have it for the PlayStation 3 and the 360, so.

04:48.160 --> 04:52.640
Yeah. Alright. Sorry, no Wii version of fear out there.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.880
Alright.

04:55.880 --> 05:00.800
Moving on, also about the PlayStation 3, a lot of people kinda mad

05:00.800 --> 05:03.200
about the lack of a rumble feature.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.560
Now Sony is saying that they didnít want to do it because it interferes with the whole

05:06.560 --> 05:12.480
tilt thing but I think a lot of us are looking at that and going ìWhat about the lawsuit?î

05:12.480 --> 05:17.000
This is what is interesting, Immersion who is the company who is involved in this lawsuit

05:17.000 --> 05:21.840
says ìI donít believe itís a very difficult problem to solveî referring to the shocking

05:21.840 --> 05:25.380
getting in the way of the tilt sensory and Immersion is experts that would be happy to

05:25.380 --> 05:27.660
to solve that problem for them.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.380
But in exchange, Sony is going to have

05:30.380 --> 05:34.700
to drop its current appeal against the 2004 lawsuit.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.100
So that is a very interesting exchange.

05:37.100 --> 05:41.260
Like, sure, we'll get you rumble if you pay us a lot of money.

05:41.260 --> 05:41.780
It's OK.

05:41.780 --> 05:44.260
All they'll do is they'll add the rumble feature

05:44.260 --> 05:45.940
to controllers later on after they've

05:45.940 --> 05:50.700
disassembled the Wii controller to see how it works.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.980
What do you think?

05:51.980 --> 05:55.340
Is this something that Sony ought to be looking into?

05:55.340 --> 05:59.340
I think so. I think their system needs all the help it can get.

06:00.340 --> 06:01.340
Alright.

06:02.340 --> 06:04.340
I would like to see them do the, uh, rumble as well.

06:04.340 --> 06:09.340
Personally, if I had to choose, you know, rumble or tilt, I'd choose rumble, because the tilt function sucked.

06:09.340 --> 06:15.340
I haven't seen anything that really sells me on the tilt function. Sure, there was Warhawk, but not enough for me.

06:15.340 --> 06:20.340
So, show me why I need tilt, and maybe I'll say that.

06:20.340 --> 06:21.340
Yeah.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.340
Alright.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.340
I can get tilt already at home.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.340
Oh, with the pinball machine?

06:25.340 --> 06:26.340
With the pinball machine.

06:26.340 --> 06:28.340
Well, that's a little different.

06:28.340 --> 06:29.340
You know what?

06:29.340 --> 06:32.600
I prefer that kind of tilt to Sony's tilt, so...

06:32.600 --> 06:34.460
Maybe they just haven't put it in the right game yet.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.460
We'll see, though.

06:35.460 --> 06:36.460
We'll see.

06:36.460 --> 06:37.460
Uh, Loki!

06:37.460 --> 06:38.460
Developers!

06:38.460 --> 06:42.700
Getting frustrated, because they haven't received PS3 dev kits yet.

06:42.700 --> 06:48.580
In fact, some of the major ones, THQ and Sega, just haven't gotten dev kits.

06:48.580 --> 06:55.940
THQ boss Brian Farrell reportedly said that his company had killed the work on Sopranos

06:55.940 --> 06:59.080
for the PlayStation 3 because it was too risky at the moment since they don't have a dev

06:59.080 --> 07:00.720
kit.

07:00.720 --> 07:05.800
So that's kind of important if you want games to be included with your $600 system that's

07:05.800 --> 07:09.820
coming out in the fall.

07:09.820 --> 07:13.420
Which hopefully it's coming out in the fall because they said, oh yeah we're launching

07:13.420 --> 07:14.420
in the fall.

07:14.420 --> 07:17.340
Or we're launching November 17th or whatever.

07:17.340 --> 07:23.300
I remember when they said they were launching back in spring, so yeah, it's not looking

07:23.300 --> 07:24.300
good.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.300
Interesting.

07:25.300 --> 07:32.300
Loki, we're going to go ahead and go back to you for another story about the Final Fantasy

07:32.300 --> 07:35.260
VII remake that was rumored last E3.

07:35.260 --> 07:36.260
What's going on with this?

07:36.260 --> 07:41.500
Well, according to EGM, they're saying yes, it is.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.820
Actually in their latest edition of the magazine, which I think was actually on the show floor

07:44.820 --> 07:52.780
It says, last year Square Enix teased everyone with what it called the Final Fantasy 7 PS3

07:52.780 --> 07:53.780
tech demo.

07:53.780 --> 07:55.100
Well, what do you know?

07:55.100 --> 07:59.140
This test case was really a sneak peek at the next-gen revival of the PlayStation 1

07:59.140 --> 08:00.960
role-playing hit.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.700
Is it actually coming out?

08:02.700 --> 08:03.980
Eh, maybe.

08:03.980 --> 08:07.940
So you know, just because the magazine says so, who knows.

08:07.940 --> 08:09.380
Okay, interesting.

08:09.380 --> 08:10.380
I think a lot.

08:10.380 --> 08:13.460
Well, it would make sense with all the Final Fantasy 7 love that Square has been given

08:13.460 --> 08:14.460
lately.

08:14.460 --> 08:18.380
sense yeah so and you know there was a whole I heard a friend of a friend thing

08:18.380 --> 08:20.900
a while back that said it was happening but you know take that with a grain of

08:20.900 --> 08:23.460
salt but here's another interesting one this isn't from a friend but a well you

08:23.460 --> 08:28.380
know someone I would call this person a friend but a listener of our station

08:28.380 --> 08:32.740
tipped me off on something which I think is very interesting and this was

08:32.740 --> 08:38.860
overheard by people that would know what they're talking about from Nintendo and

08:38.860 --> 08:47.720
Basically, Nintendo is trying to secure the rights to remake Final Fantasy 7 for a portable

08:47.720 --> 08:51.080
console in the near future.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.080
Take it with a grain of salt, but this was overheard by a listener of ours from people

08:55.080 --> 08:59.200
that would know what they're talking about, that Final Fantasy 7 is coming to a portable

08:59.200 --> 09:03.060
console, and this is Nintendo, so obviously it's the DS or some other crazy thing they

09:03.060 --> 09:06.080
might have in the works, but I'm pretty sure it's the DS.

09:06.080 --> 09:10.440
So again, take it with a grain of salt, but when I think about it, it makes a lot of sense

09:10.440 --> 09:12.800
that Final Fantasy VII would come out on the DS, right?

09:12.800 --> 09:13.800
Yeah.

09:13.800 --> 09:18.880
Well, there's also the fact that basically since the DS is a glorified Nintendo 64, they

09:18.880 --> 09:25.200
had Final Fantasy VI characters as a demo for what would have been Final Fantasy VII

09:25.200 --> 09:31.140
back on the Nintendo 64 until they went to Sony instead.

09:31.140 --> 09:37.140
So, basically, they've even had work on this before, technically.

09:37.140 --> 09:41.140
That's a very interesting point. It wouldn't be too hard to, I guess, make it happen.

09:41.140 --> 09:44.140
People think, oh, CD to cartridge. I don't know.

09:44.140 --> 09:48.140
Not at all. I think that it would be in their best interest to remake it.

09:48.140 --> 09:54.140
Especially after seeing Final Fantasy III at E3. Final Fantasy III is in a very similar graphical style.

09:54.140 --> 09:57.140
In fact, a little better than Final Fantasy VII. I could totally see it happening.

09:57.140 --> 10:03.620
And let's not also forget that Squeenix is on a currently Final Fantasy, you know binge right now

10:05.500 --> 10:09.980
Saturating us with Final Fantasy 7 everything what an interesting retort from Nintendo though

10:09.980 --> 10:13.020
If that happened because Sony has been really selling, you know

10:13.020 --> 10:18.940
The PSP you can download the PlayStation 1 game and the game that everyone asks about can I play Final Fantasy 7 on it?

10:18.940 --> 10:20.740
They're not asking about Ridge Racer

10:20.740 --> 10:25.300
They're asking about Final Fantasy 7 will I be able to play Final Fantasy 7 on the PSP?

10:25.300 --> 10:30.700
and of course the answer is yes but what a great response from Nintendo to be

10:30.700 --> 10:36.140
able to play Final Fantasy 7 on the DS but again guys you know you have to take a

10:36.140 --> 10:38.860
little bit of grain of salt right now but just don't be surprised if it actually

10:38.860 --> 10:50.060
happens very very interesting alright moving on there is an HDMI cable coming

10:50.060 --> 10:56.280
the Xbox 360 and Lixang is supposedly offering that you can put your name on a

10:56.280 --> 11:01.120
list to be one of the first ones to get this cable when it does come out so

11:01.120 --> 11:04.920
Lixang has taken pre-orders to this HDMI cable so people are kind of jumping to

11:04.920 --> 11:08.360
conclusions there that means one is on in the way and it would make sense

11:08.360 --> 11:12.920
Microsoft likes to do that if their competition does something they'll do it

11:12.920 --> 11:15.800
as well they'll release an upgrade or something they've built that 360 to be

11:15.800 --> 11:19.440
pretty quickly upgradeable so I could totally see this happening I don't know

11:19.440 --> 11:22.800
why it didn't happen at launch but whatever it's coming and especially if

11:22.800 --> 11:27.120
there's an HD DVD player in the works and this whole discussion about 1080p is

11:27.120 --> 11:31.320
the true HD I think don't make a lot of sense for that HD DVD player to come out

11:31.320 --> 11:35.960
as well as an HDMI cable I think that would be a good way to answer Sony's

11:35.960 --> 11:38.960
blu-ray you know is the true HD or whatever

11:39.760 --> 11:43.000
yeah moving on

11:43.000 --> 11:46.140
Loki. Yes. What else on the 360?

11:46.140 --> 11:49.540
Um, other things on the 360, well

11:49.540 --> 11:52.800
Devil May Cry. Um, actually

11:52.800 --> 11:56.220
they're saying that Devil May Cry 4 might not be

11:56.220 --> 11:59.960
exclusive to the PS3, but may date

11:59.960 --> 12:03.120
be on the 360 and Revolution as well.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.480
You mean the Wii? Whatever, the Wii.

12:06.480 --> 12:10.560
Um, it's according to, um, the latest issue of

12:10.560 --> 12:18.780
They basically feature an interview with Hiroshi Kobayashi, the producer of the Devil May Cry

12:18.780 --> 12:19.960
series.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.960
So interesting.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.960
But that's not all.

12:23.960 --> 12:24.960
No, no.

12:24.960 --> 12:30.960
Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition may be coming to Xbox 360 as well.

12:30.960 --> 12:36.480
According to Planet Xbox 360, and they don't really give a source on it, but they say that

12:36.480 --> 12:45.160
It's coming to the 360 in the PAL territories, so they mention September as the launch date

12:45.160 --> 12:46.160
for that.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.360
That'd be interesting, but a rumor for now.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.660
Lots of Devil May Cry love on the 360.

12:51.660 --> 12:52.660
Good deal.

12:52.660 --> 12:56.140
I'm going over to the chat room over at www.orangehonesty.com, click on chat.

12:56.140 --> 12:58.840
There's a lot of feedback there to what we were saying earlier about the Final Fantasy

12:58.840 --> 12:59.840
VII remakes.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.060
DJ Pooh Eater says, how many times can I watch Eris die?

13:03.060 --> 13:05.640
Stop pulling my heart out, you bastard Squeenix.

13:05.640 --> 13:10.400
I can't watch it enough. I have my game saved where she dies

13:10.400 --> 13:14.960
so that I can watch her die over and over. Will you do that on the PSP version and the

13:14.960 --> 13:17.960
PS3 remake and the DS version? Hell yeah!

13:17.960 --> 13:21.200
Alright. I hate Aerith!

13:21.200 --> 13:24.680
You should set it up so that you have it all play at once on all the different...

13:24.680 --> 13:28.240
I hate, hate, hate, hate her. The question is how are they going to

13:28.240 --> 13:33.600
fit all that on a cartridge? Those DS cartridges are pretty big and

13:33.600 --> 13:35.360
I could see it happening.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.120
I think somebody made a joke.

13:38.120 --> 13:41.880
I think Bobby said something, BlackWolf in the chatroom said something about they could

13:41.880 --> 13:44.000
put Final Fantasy 7 on three carts.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.480
And the third cartridge is nothing but the ending.

13:48.480 --> 13:53.520
Rini was saying in response to me saying everybody's asking for Final Fantasy 7, he's saying I'm

13:53.520 --> 13:56.240
asking for Intelligent Cube.

13:56.240 --> 14:00.120
Good call, good call.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.460
Moving on with topics.

14:02.460 --> 14:05.480
There's a brand new add-on coming to Oblivion.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.960
This has really been an ever-expanding game.

14:08.960 --> 14:14.840
The latest one, according to a Bethesda developer, is basically Goonies.

14:14.840 --> 14:19.740
What happens in this mission is that you will take control of a cavernous lair that has

14:19.740 --> 14:25.380
a pirate ship in it, and then once you get the pirate ship, you get to go loot things.

14:25.380 --> 14:28.680
It's just like the Goonies, because remember they had the pirate ship in the cave?

14:28.680 --> 14:29.680
Get this.

14:29.680 --> 14:33.040
doesn't interest you but that's just supposedly working on an additional six

14:33.040 --> 14:37.240
to seven add-ons including an epic dungeon and they want to release this

14:37.240 --> 14:40.520
stuff every three to four weeks that's the smartest way to keep your game going

14:40.520 --> 14:44.880
honestly that's a great tactic oblivion a very impressive game one I need to

14:44.880 --> 14:49.360
play more of but I can't tear myself away from that other RPG I keep playing

14:49.360 --> 14:56.040
over and over I think oblivion be better if I had co-op over live yeah but then

14:56.040 --> 15:01.980
it's an MMO in a way in a way necessarily all right anyway it's been

15:01.980 --> 15:05.620
a little while since we've been able to take a look inside our old mail bag of a

15:05.620 --> 15:09.500
dark Sakura hasn't forgotten about you guys who email us every week at mailbag

15:09.500 --> 15:13.180
at orange lounge radio.com so we've got a little bit of a backlog tonight so we

15:13.180 --> 15:18.120
want to let dark Sakura get to it and check the mailbag so dark Sakura put on

15:18.120 --> 15:25.120
your hazmat suit and your rubber gloves and dig on into the mailbag.

15:27.440 --> 15:31.240
This week is actually asbestos. Yeah, I'm gonna die.

15:31.240 --> 15:35.760
What are we getting flames this week? No. No, I was just saying.

15:35.760 --> 15:42.760
Jeremy Todd emailed us and basically he wanted to state, and we've actually been talking

15:42.760 --> 15:52.040
talking about this back and forth about um saying that the Wii controller and the uh

15:52.040 --> 15:58.280
uh playstation 3 controller is well let me just start over let me just start over reading

15:58.280 --> 16:04.240
this that's right i'm tired okay i just want to address to many people that the ps3 isn't

16:04.240 --> 16:07.240
like the Wii controller since many of the people who watch the sony conference probably

16:07.240 --> 16:12.040
got this impression the Wii controller can sense 3d space but the ps3 controller cannot

16:12.040 --> 16:20.540
Now, we had discussed this, and basically, to go ahead and point this out, for everybody else who has this misconception, they are almost the same.

16:21.540 --> 16:38.040
The tilt is a gyroscope, the connection to the TV is infrared, not 3D space, it's infrared, it's just sensitivity the closer and further away you get it, and it connects to the Wii by Bluetooth.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.040
So, basically...

16:40.040 --> 16:46.240
I remember when Bobby was talking about this, though, accelerometers is a big part of the

16:46.240 --> 16:52.240
Wii thing, too, though, that not every game uses infrared, some use just the accelerometers

16:52.240 --> 16:56.080
and some use just the infrared, so it just kind of depends on the game you're playing.

16:56.080 --> 17:03.580
But it's really not all that, you know, fantastic, they just took actually very simple technology

17:03.580 --> 17:07.000
and used it in a complex way, how I see it.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Okay.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
So yeah, um

17:10.920 --> 17:15.040
Now this was um, our good friend Rob linked me to another

17:15.680 --> 17:18.480
editorial at a pointless waste of time and

17:18.920 --> 17:21.440
For anyone who wants to read it because I'm not going to go into the whole thing

17:21.440 --> 17:27.220
It's at pointless waste of time comm slash games slash crashed at HTML

17:27.320 --> 17:31.900
it's life after the video game crash post e3 2006 edition by

17:33.900 --> 17:36.260
Personing David Wong is very interesting article

17:36.260 --> 17:40.600
But the thing that I thought was great that he pointed out in this article is actually

17:40.600 --> 17:42.260
right up at the beginning.

17:42.260 --> 17:45.060
I'm going to read these two paragraphs on here.

17:45.060 --> 17:46.060
It says, Who am I?

17:46.060 --> 17:48.260
I am the creator of a certain video game console.

17:48.260 --> 17:51.460
I don't want to toot my own horn, but let's just say the profits of this machine were

17:51.460 --> 17:54.620
four billion dollars higher than the Microsoft Xbox.

17:54.620 --> 17:57.920
My console consisted of a plastic milk crate with a kitten placed inside.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.540
The controller was a wooden rod that could be used to poke the kitten.

18:00.540 --> 18:03.900
I sold zero of these consoles, which cost me zero to manufacture.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.380
Therefore my profits were zero.

18:05.380 --> 18:09.000
The Xbox however lost 4 billion dollars.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.860
I want to buy the poke the kitten console, that sounds like fun.

18:11.860 --> 18:14.620
I need to poke the rabbit console instead.

18:14.620 --> 18:20.760
And actually there is a link on this to an article at Joystiq about just how much they've

18:20.760 --> 18:24.460
kept losing over the Xbox.

18:24.460 --> 18:32.080
But it's pretty much going into a lot more detail about basically why the video game

18:32.080 --> 18:36.800
industry is going to crash especially with the release of the ps3 and Sony is

18:36.800 --> 18:43.000
basically planning to take a 400 $500 loss on every single ps3 they sell you

18:43.000 --> 18:48.720
know maybe in a few years I'll start making money on it but this the first

18:48.720 --> 18:52.120
thing that it brings up that I just think is the probably the most apt

18:52.120 --> 18:55.920
comparison here it's like why does the industry have to crush it all the movie

18:55.920 --> 19:00.880
industry is still around you know over a century later but it's been proven with

19:00.880 --> 19:07.100
Especially with the Atari 2600 that you can have a system for a few years, but after a while you'll stop playing it

19:07.460 --> 19:09.840
You know, they're saying that when they released

19:11.080 --> 19:16.460
ET you know in 1983 ET was supposed to be Atari's biggest market

19:16.880 --> 19:19.080
you know biggest game to hit the market and

19:20.640 --> 19:26.340
They you know, it's about six million of them stayed on shelves then again, the game was pretty wretched

19:26.340 --> 19:32.940
But even so, it was just that people weren't playing their 2600s by 1983, that it had just

19:32.940 --> 19:35.500
been nothing new was out.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.500
People got tired of it.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.100
It was an old toy.

19:39.100 --> 19:43.900
I think that that's a very, very good comparison right there, and it's why, you know, how many

19:43.900 --> 19:47.900
were all up all over it when they got their GameCube, you know?

19:47.900 --> 19:49.100
How many of you are still playing it?

19:49.100 --> 19:51.100
When was the last time you played your GameCube, Rob?

19:51.100 --> 19:52.100
A while ago.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.100
I'll be honest.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.100
It was a while ago.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.660
But that's because there hasn't been any games that have come out lately that have

19:55.660 --> 20:00.380
maybe go wow and I haven't had a good nerd party lately where people cuz like

20:00.380 --> 20:03.420
that was pretty much where my game was getting the most use people come over we

20:03.420 --> 20:07.960
play F-Zero we play Smash Bros. we play Mario Party it's it's the greatest party

20:07.960 --> 20:13.500
console ever. Okay what's the oldest system that you own right now? That still

20:13.500 --> 20:18.700
works? Probably my Super Nintendo. When was last time you touched it? Oh it's in

20:18.700 --> 20:23.260
a box it's it's because I don't need to I can emulate it but I emulated a Super

20:23.260 --> 20:28.060
Nintendo game last week so I but I want to pull your system out and play it so

20:28.060 --> 20:31.700
ages ago probably in college okay if you didn't have an emulator would you pull

20:31.700 --> 20:39.180
out your SNES and play it I'm gonna be honest probably I think but not like on

20:39.180 --> 20:42.300
a regular basis it would be one of those things was like dude remember Super

20:42.300 --> 20:45.380
Metroid fuck yeah let's play you know it would be because that's what emulators

20:45.380 --> 20:49.580
every day no no no play it for a little bit and then you just put it away yes

20:49.580 --> 20:53.860
You know, and, and Dan and I own all these systems, but honestly, the last time we touched

20:53.860 --> 20:57.700
our Herbografx was like, you know, a few months ago.

20:57.700 --> 21:02.940
We have, I haven't touched my own Super Nintendo that I moved out here with in a year.

21:02.940 --> 21:06.900
And except like when I moved it, when we moved into our house.

21:06.900 --> 21:11.620
So yeah, you keep it around and you know, the novel aspect is there, yeah, I'm gonna

21:11.620 --> 21:17.020
go play my Nintendo, but are you gonna have it hooked up as your primary system?

21:17.020 --> 21:18.020
Hell no.

21:18.020 --> 21:21.640
If it was the only thing you owned, would you still have found other things to do

21:21.640 --> 21:23.460
after three years had passed?

21:23.460 --> 21:29.140
It would really depend on my scenario, see, but on the other hand if I

21:29.140 --> 21:31.340
didn't have the money to afford

21:31.340 --> 21:35.640
a new console and I could go to a garage sale or the flea market and buy Super

21:35.640 --> 21:37.560
Nintendo games for like two bucks a pop,

21:37.560 --> 21:41.820
I'd get a lot more life out of it. But would you still

21:41.820 --> 21:45.140
play it more often if you could like go out and do stuff instead?

21:45.140 --> 21:47.780
It's hard to say, because I'm not in that situation.

21:47.780 --> 21:51.360
Well, that's just the point of view I'm trying to point out, you know.

21:51.360 --> 21:51.860
Understandable.

21:51.860 --> 22:00.420
I had, you know, my Super Nintendo, I had for years, and after a couple of years, even though, you know, I was still a big gamer, I still love to play my Super Nintendo,

22:00.980 --> 22:02.780
I put more attention toward other things.

22:03.160 --> 22:11.340
You know, that's just how I was with it, even though I loved to death, and I'd go through and have my, you know, massive three-hour games of Kirby's Avalanche, you know.

22:11.340 --> 22:14.540
I think that's a pretty good, you know,

22:14.540 --> 22:18.500
I thought that was a pretty neat point to bring up.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.860
23rd Magus in our chat room, by the way, would like to point out that

22:21.860 --> 22:25.220
your pet Shermie does not approve of the Poke the Kitten console.

22:25.220 --> 22:29.260
I don't approve of the Poke the Kitten console. I totally approve.

22:29.260 --> 22:34.020
The next point on this though, well see, it keeps bringing out though that, you know,

22:34.020 --> 22:38.340
that yeah, you get it with slightly better graphics, but really

22:38.340 --> 22:41.980
Aren't the games the same? I thought there was a funny comparison though of of

22:44.700 --> 22:49.460
Jet goblins attack in 1980 and the Legend of Zelda in 1987. I'll show you

22:51.660 --> 22:56.140
Hmm, okay. Yeah, you have orange box yellow box

22:56.140 --> 22:59.200
And of course we all know it's a little looks like but it's you know

22:59.200 --> 23:04.380
It's really going into a lot more of this article goes into how oh these systems are so great

23:04.380 --> 23:07.760
But now you know you're getting just more of the same with everything released

23:07.760 --> 23:10.460
There's no new innovation was actually why I think you know

23:10.460 --> 23:14.780
I don't know if you noticed how much bigger the crowds were at Nintendo

23:15.980 --> 23:21.620
Then they were for Microsoft and say and and Sony well a part of that

23:21.620 --> 23:26.620
I blame on Nintendo's design though you could walk right into Sony's and play their console on Microsoft

23:26.620 --> 23:29.700
I mean there's a whole variety and then you have the whole hype behind the Wii

23:29.700 --> 23:35.660
I don't know if I can relate it to this see how much line they had anticipated getting at Sony

23:36.460 --> 23:39.860
That's true. That's true. They got maybe a third of that

23:40.020 --> 23:44.540
Well, here's the other thing too that all their consoles are playable at other booths

23:45.140 --> 23:51.080
That's a good point too. You could you could walk into Sega and play full auto 2 and some the sonic game. So

23:51.620 --> 23:53.620
That's a good point. I

23:53.620 --> 24:08.620
I would recommend giving this article a read. It's a very well written editorial. It goes a lot more into detail about supporting proof. It gives actual numbers. It gives actual information. I thought that was very, very smart.

24:08.620 --> 24:20.620
So I would say definitely go take a look. Check it out dudes. And dudettes. But I did like the whole, you know, bringing up the comparison there.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.620
Um, we got an email from

24:22.700 --> 24:24.300
Jay Vez

24:24.300 --> 24:26.980
Said a great show. I've been listening to you for about two months

24:26.980 --> 24:32.500
You all always have good comments about the stuff going on in the gaming world. Just wanted to give you guys some positive feedback

24:32.780 --> 24:38.660
Thank you. Appreciate it. We got we got another one from L driver

24:39.740 --> 24:41.740
Cool. Yeah, um

24:42.180 --> 24:47.420
Just wanted to give you a shout and let you know how awesome your e3 coverage was yours was my favorite and it was cool

24:47.420 --> 24:52.260
to have you guys, All Games, Gamer Andy, and Bobby Blackwithall on the same, I'm sorry,

24:52.260 --> 24:57.860
all on each other's shows. You should try to do that more often. Agreed. It was fun.

24:57.860 --> 25:01.300
It was a brilliant idea from the All Games people to put us all under one roof. The only

25:01.300 --> 25:06.540
unfortunate thing is that, again, you had Gamer Andy, who's based in the Bay, us, who's

25:06.540 --> 25:12.200
based in Sacramento, Scott and Lawrence, who are based in LA, and Bobby, who's in Atlanta,

25:12.200 --> 25:16.260
so it's, you know, that doesn't happen very often where everybody's in the same city,

25:16.260 --> 25:18.280
except for something as massive as E3.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.560
Maybe Game Developers Conference next year,

25:20.560 --> 25:21.800
because I could see us going to that,

25:21.800 --> 25:24.340
and probably at least, I know Bobby flew out this year,

25:24.340 --> 25:27.020
so maybe something will happen again, but who knows?

25:27.020 --> 25:30.520
And you know, oh, the guy from Chatterbox as well

25:30.520 --> 25:32.860
was in Arizona, he was there for one of the shows too.

25:32.860 --> 25:34.840
So, you know, it's not very often

25:34.840 --> 25:35.800
everybody gets under one roof,

25:35.800 --> 25:37.040
but we thought it was a good time.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.880
And you know what I liked about it too,

25:38.880 --> 25:41.880
was that there was no sense of competition.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.920
You know, sure we had the joking chat,

25:43.920 --> 25:44.960
oh, how many people you got listed,

25:44.960 --> 25:48.140
of people you got listening and we kind of had that joke but there was you know

25:48.140 --> 25:52.260
it was just kind of like we all realize that our shows are different because of

25:52.260 --> 25:55.660
who hosts it and there's just different things that each show brings to the

25:55.660 --> 26:00.980
table and you know we can all coexist people will you know gravitate to the

26:00.980 --> 26:05.860
host that or hopefully multiple shows of the hosts that they you know seem to

26:05.860 --> 26:08.540
reflect their personality or the complete opposite some people might

26:08.540 --> 26:11.540
listen to us because what we say pisses them off I don't know I thought it was

26:11.540 --> 26:16.260
was great though that we could have such different points of view. It was very nice to have new

26:16.260 --> 26:17.780
people to bounce off of.

26:17.780 --> 26:23.560
I think one of the reasons I like the whole All Games thing is because, take Scott, well

26:23.560 --> 26:26.780
at least Scott for example, I think Lawrence plays a lot of the same games we do, but Scott

26:26.780 --> 26:30.860
plays a lot of sports games and that type of thing, so he came on our E3 special on

26:30.860 --> 26:34.180
Friday and was talking about Madden and sort of brought a perspective to it that I don't

26:34.180 --> 26:39.660
think we could provide. And I think it's healthy for our listeners to sort of hear how or remember

26:39.660 --> 26:42.800
that there's other types of gamers, you know what I mean?

26:42.800 --> 26:45.740
I think that was the best thing that came of that is that you really heard from different

26:45.740 --> 26:46.740
types of gamers.

26:46.740 --> 26:48.580
I was all, I play super high impact.

26:48.580 --> 26:49.580
Mm-hmm.

26:49.580 --> 26:50.580
That was it.

26:50.580 --> 26:51.580
I know.

26:51.580 --> 26:52.580
I know.

26:52.580 --> 26:53.580
I'm a Tecmo ball for life.

26:53.580 --> 26:54.820
The L driver has a question for us.

26:54.820 --> 26:55.820
Sure.

26:55.820 --> 27:01.020
My question is, who was the coolest industry person you met at the show or who were you

27:01.020 --> 27:02.660
most excited about meeting or seeing?

27:02.660 --> 27:08.520
I've heard people say nothing about, I'm sorry, say nothing about great things about Major

27:08.520 --> 27:13.960
Nelson and Trixie and I think it's telling Microsoft that people like working for them.

27:13.960 --> 27:17.520
I don't see that on the Sony side, just a thought.

27:17.520 --> 27:18.520
Do we meet anywhere?

27:18.520 --> 27:21.360
Well, I know I saw Will Wright and he was cold.

27:21.360 --> 27:25.040
I would say the, I'll let you share because I know which one you were excited, most excited

27:25.040 --> 27:26.040
to meet.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.040
I met two people.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.760
Oh, the one at the very last day, the last minute, that's the one I met too.

27:29.760 --> 27:34.440
My first one was meeting Koji Kondo on the first day and getting his autograph.

27:34.440 --> 27:35.440
Oh, that's right.

27:35.440 --> 27:41.960
was Rob took my photo with Igarashi Koji, who's the producer of the Castlevania games.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.760
That's the one I met too that I thought was really exciting, but honestly, I gotta be

27:44.760 --> 27:50.960
honest, nothing will beat Akira from two years ago, Kiryamoka. That was mine.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.840
Hey, you make Koji Kondo.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.840
Alright.

27:54.840 --> 27:59.160
Loki, did you meet any industry people?

27:59.160 --> 28:05.280
No, but I wish I had met, I think it was like Steve Ododec or whatever that was there. I

28:05.280 --> 28:09.800
I remember the guy that did Kung Pao, he was apparently walking around in E3.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.600
So I was like, it was cool to meet him because I got to punch him in the face and say, make

28:13.600 --> 28:19.720
god damn Kung Pao 2, because I need to see the movie now, get off your ass, stop wasting

28:19.720 --> 28:26.080
your time with Barnyard and those other crappy animated movies, I want Kung Pao 2.

28:26.080 --> 28:31.440
I got to be honest, I try not to be fanboy at E3 because it's supposed to be a professional

28:31.440 --> 28:35.220
so I don't I don't run up to people and go OMG I'm your biggest fan but you know

28:35.220 --> 28:39.840
in the case of you know the guy the Igarashi you know it's just kind of the

28:39.840 --> 28:43.140
way we just kind of talked to him was like hey you know we wanted to actually

28:43.140 --> 28:46.380
just tell them about our show and hope so we can get them on but you know and

28:46.380 --> 28:50.940
you know take a picture while we're at it for the website why not fun we're

28:50.940 --> 28:56.400
gonna cut out the part with me in it no stop um also I got an email we've been

28:56.400 --> 29:04.420
picked for a podzinger podcast of the week yay podzinger yeah so everyone

29:04.420 --> 29:08.880
should go to podzinger.com go check it out the other cool thing about podzinger

29:08.880 --> 29:11.940
and one part of what sets them apart from other podcast search engines is

29:11.940 --> 29:17.300
that they actually will break down what we say like it takes like it somehow

29:17.300 --> 29:22.420
converts our mp3 into text like you can't actually read it but you if you do

29:22.420 --> 29:26.520
search like you'll actually see podzinger try to read the sentence as we

29:26.520 --> 29:30.040
spoke it it's really weird technology but it's cool so you can actually search

29:30.040 --> 29:33.640
for words in podcasts so I think that's kind of neat so thank you podzinger

29:33.640 --> 29:38.740
appreciate it our last one comes from Nintendo maniac 64 mm-hmm who has a

29:38.740 --> 29:43.520
question for us mm-hmm so it was I was wondering if there was a way of taking

29:43.520 --> 29:48.400
an AGP or PCI port out of the PC and hooking it up to a laptop via internally

29:48.400 --> 29:54.280
are externally so that I could use a decent video card no idea Loki I have no

29:54.280 --> 30:01.400
idea what pay attention fired sorry I was reading an AGP or PCI port out of a

30:01.400 --> 30:06.960
PC and hook it up to a laptop for to use a better video card you're not gonna

30:06.960 --> 30:10.520
probably be able to do that because laptops a lot of times they have PCI

30:10.520 --> 30:15.280
Express well especially like the recent ones they have PCI Express cards and I'm

30:15.280 --> 30:18.120
I'm not sure if there are their own versions of them.

30:18.120 --> 30:26.880
Like my laptop right now has an ATI Mobility Radeon X600, so it's kind of a mobile version

30:26.880 --> 30:35.740
of the Radeon X600, so you can't really do that just because also laptops are meant to

30:35.740 --> 30:39.320
run on lower power than a PC.

30:39.320 --> 30:45.960
So the power that a lot of cards, you know, freakin' draw, you're not going to be able

30:45.960 --> 30:51.640
to put anything like that in your laptop and, I don't know, just, I don't know, if you really

30:51.640 --> 30:52.640
want to...

30:52.640 --> 30:53.640
My laptop is just fine.

30:53.640 --> 30:59.680
You shouldn't really need a really high, super duper duper high end card, you know, just

30:59.680 --> 31:01.160
buy a more expensive laptop I guess.

31:01.160 --> 31:07.440
I mean, you can actually, you know, get some pretty up to date graphics cards right now,

31:07.440 --> 31:09.440
Alienware does make a...

31:09.440 --> 31:11.440
Alienware does make a...

31:11.440 --> 31:13.440
Well yeah, buy a Mac if you want good graphics.

31:13.440 --> 31:14.440
Yeah, just get a Mac.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.440
Sorry, Loki. I know how you feel, but honestly...

31:16.440 --> 31:18.440
Did you see the stuff for the new MacBook?

31:18.440 --> 31:19.440
Isn't it hot?

31:19.440 --> 31:21.440
I gotta take it back to gaming. We gotta keep it going.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.440
MacBook Pro, man.

31:22.440 --> 31:25.440
Well, if we're taking it back to gaming, then obviously Mac is the wrong way to go there.

31:25.440 --> 31:26.440
Shut up!

31:26.440 --> 31:28.440
Oh, sorry, I dropped my mic.

31:28.440 --> 31:30.440
Oh, I've done to my computer, dammit.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.440
Um, you know, uh...

31:32.440 --> 31:34.440
I'll be playing World of Warcraft on my Mac.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.440
on my Mac.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.440
And I'll be playing Ragnarok online.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.440
Alright, look, shut up.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.440
Alright, if you want to email us,

31:42.440 --> 31:44.440
add to the mailbag for next week, yell at Loki for his

31:44.440 --> 31:46.440
Mac hate. Mailbag at

31:46.440 --> 31:48.440
orangelaunchradio.com is the address.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.440
Moving on, I gotta mention this, because

31:50.440 --> 31:52.440
we have a lot of folks who love

31:52.440 --> 31:54.440
the music games, and by the way, we have

31:54.440 --> 31:56.440
a video coming to the website tonight

31:56.440 --> 31:58.440
of some of the new DDR games, so some of you

31:58.440 --> 32:00.440
kids can see the interface, so check that out.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.440
But Res! Hugely popular

32:02.440 --> 32:08.440
game, Res Res Res, and in an interview with Eurogamer, the creator of Res, spoke

32:08.440 --> 32:15.160
about the possibilities of a sequel to Res. Basically he says that he is

32:15.160 --> 32:18.880
looking at the next generation possibilities and trying to do a Res

32:18.880 --> 32:22.840
kind of experience. If Sega were to approach him to make a Res sequel, he is

32:22.840 --> 32:27.600
currently seriously considering it. It's always there. I'm always thinking about

32:27.600 --> 32:30.400
it. So it's kind of interesting thing about which system would it be on? Would

32:30.400 --> 32:34.300
it be on like the Wii where you could move it around or would it be on like the

32:34.300 --> 32:38.500
360 where you could do like updates or would it be on the PlayStation 3 which

32:38.500 --> 32:43.140
is supposed to have the true high definition who knows who knows but I

32:43.140 --> 32:46.540
believe rez was originally a Dreamcast game and just brought over to the

32:46.540 --> 32:51.460
PlayStation 2 right that's right yeah that's exciting though I really hope

32:51.460 --> 32:54.460
that happens and while we're at it how about more space channel 5 please thank

32:54.460 --> 32:58.900
you Loki got some news on a pac-man pac-man

32:58.900 --> 33:04.780
I ran a world rally and I did play this game and it's actually a complete rip off of Mario

33:04.780 --> 33:05.780
Kart.

33:05.780 --> 33:12.540
So anyways, Namco mentioned that all versions of their upcoming game on all the different

33:12.540 --> 33:19.300
consoles will feature as an unlockable character the prince of all cosmos from the Katamari

33:19.300 --> 33:23.540
series and how you unlock this character you may ask?

33:23.540 --> 33:28.020
By winning the gold trophy and all the circuit cups with the easy difficulty setting which

33:28.020 --> 33:31.740
Which makes me believe there's more characters.

33:31.740 --> 33:34.420
Not a surprise at all though that the prince is hidden in there.

33:34.420 --> 33:38.180
I mean they've got to milk the Katamari franchise if there's not going to be any games.

33:38.180 --> 33:40.300
The heart difficulty you may ask?

33:40.300 --> 33:43.020
Heart difficulty you get to drive as the king's package.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.020
Shut up.

33:44.020 --> 33:46.820
I think on the heart difficulty you should drive a Katamari and roll over everybody.

33:46.820 --> 33:48.300
Now that would be fun.

33:48.300 --> 33:51.720
You know that racing level in We Heart Katamari was like the best thing ever.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.920
I love the racing level.

33:53.920 --> 33:57.420
That and the fire level.

33:57.420 --> 34:04.180
Sakura another sequel possibly in the works oh this makes my heart happy um

34:04.180 --> 34:11.380
there was a bit of conversation heard at the Sony party

34:11.380 --> 34:18.020
Yuji Naka apparently was basically on some I guess impromptu interview was

34:18.020 --> 34:23.020
admitting that there's a new night's game in development cool it's about

34:23.020 --> 34:30.000
freaking time just please don't let the control suck like Sonic's Sonic ps3 did

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
Sonic ps3 just hurt my heart I know you know it got my it got my worst game of

34:36.000 --> 34:42.360
e3 I know I'm not saying something did you because that Family Feud game was

34:42.360 --> 34:49.160
god-awful all right I don't play suck games I think this is interesting is

34:49.160 --> 34:55.160
that HAL is actually taking suggestions. They've actually put up a

34:55.160 --> 34:59.920
consumer survey on Nintendo of Japan's website and the poll is designed to let

34:59.920 --> 35:06.120
gamers help select what type of characters should be in the next Super

35:06.120 --> 35:09.340
Smash Brothers. Of course fanboys everywhere wet their pants when they saw

35:09.340 --> 35:12.360
that Pit and Snake were going to be in the next Super Smash Brothers. Is there a

35:12.360 --> 35:16.700
character that you think should be in the next Super Smash Brothers? Well I

35:16.700 --> 35:19.360
I hope you speak Japanese, but you can head on over to

35:19.360 --> 35:22.820
Nintendo... I'm sorry, it's actually in Smashbrothers.com, they have the survey

35:22.820 --> 35:23.340
there.

35:23.340 --> 35:28.140
But hopefully Nintendo of America will be releasing a similar poll over here.

35:28.140 --> 35:31.380
Any thoughts right off the top of your head, Nintendo characters or similar

35:31.380 --> 35:32.500
you'd like to see

35:32.500 --> 35:35.300
something that's actually feasible in Super Smash Brothers? I guess then again

35:35.300 --> 35:38.060
none of us ever thought Snake would be in it, and sure enough

35:38.060 --> 35:39.620
there he is.

35:39.620 --> 35:43.980
I still haven't... we need Eggplant Wizard.

35:43.980 --> 35:46.980
I think Eggplant Wizard would be pretty rockin' too.

35:46.980 --> 35:49.980
Um, gosh, I'm really kinda stretched for ideas.

35:49.980 --> 35:51.980
Mother brain playable.

35:51.980 --> 35:52.980
You can play as a metri-

35:52.980 --> 35:55.980
That's weird. Now, Kraid might- Kraid might be cool.

35:55.980 --> 35:56.980
Or like one of the baddies.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.980
You can play as one- as a Metroid.

35:58.980 --> 35:59.980
Hmm.

35:59.980 --> 36:02.980
I don't know, that's- it seems like they've done a lot of good ones.

36:02.980 --> 36:06.980
I guess, you know, I'm glad they're just going back to Kid Icarus, honestly.

36:06.980 --> 36:11.980
Um, but, I've heard- I've heard rumors, rumblings, that uh,

36:11.980 --> 36:17.060
Final Fantasy characters are supposed to make an appearance as well, but again, that's that's like a big old grain of salt

36:17.060 --> 36:20.320
I think that that sounds like more of a fanboy thing to me. I don't see

36:21.520 --> 36:27.600
Well after all, I mean they did have to remix TV world fighters with all the Konami

36:28.200 --> 36:33.140
characters in there including snake, so why not add some of those characters and

36:34.060 --> 36:36.060
Which case they would have had?

36:36.540 --> 36:38.220
Was it Simon Belmont?

36:38.220 --> 36:39.780
Mm-hmm, and I remember

36:39.780 --> 36:41.780
From like Hudson since now

36:42.140 --> 36:44.480
Konami seems to publish all the Hudson games

36:45.220 --> 36:47.060
Bomberman

36:47.060 --> 36:49.060
they even had a

36:49.100 --> 36:51.100
you go from

36:51.700 --> 36:53.700
Was it

36:53.700 --> 36:55.860
God, I can't remember the game now the crappy. Yeah

36:56.580 --> 37:01.060
That's all right. I got I got a good Barbie or whatever. Yeah, I got to go over

37:01.060 --> 37:03.380
I got to go to the chat room because they've seen some great stuff right now

37:03.380 --> 37:09.540
Jeremy Todd one wants to point out you can always google trade translate the website good point and they're sharing some great ideas

37:09.540 --> 37:17.260
Bobby Black Wolf says K.K. Slider could be a character, DMN says Little Mac, O2G says

37:17.260 --> 37:27.220
King Hippo, that's a good idea, Spirit Snare says Reggie, and Renee, I love this idea,

37:27.220 --> 37:33.020
a Tetris piece, that would be funny, and Spirit Snare, I mean why not, you have Mr. Game & Watch,

37:33.020 --> 37:40.520
also suggests the dog from Duck Hunt okay who hasn't wanted to kick

37:40.520 --> 37:46.840
that dog's ass okay I will but I but in the in the Smash Brothers can you

37:46.840 --> 37:49.720
imagine playing the dog yeah I want to kick that thing's ass here are some of

37:49.720 --> 37:57.000
the ones that they had from Dream Mix TV Twinbee yes they also had a moe

37:57.000 --> 38:05.340
head from Gradius, which I thought was pretty interesting. Solid Snake, of course, was there.

38:05.340 --> 38:11.880
They also had Simon Belmont. These are all Konami. Yeah, those were all Konami ones.

38:11.880 --> 38:19.440
So I think it's pretty cool. Alright. Well, hell, we're opening up to Konami. How about

38:19.440 --> 38:25.760
Goemon? Or maybe Pentaro. Alright. Moving on, DarkSakuro. What company's got a lot of

38:25.760 --> 38:29.200
love for the Wii. A lot of people have a lot of love for the Wii, but who else has love

38:29.200 --> 38:38.200
for the Wii? SNK! Who I have a lot of love for. Well, basically it was confirmed by SNK

38:38.200 --> 38:45.320
USA's president that they are going to try to get stuff out on the Wii. They were saying

38:45.320 --> 38:54.600
they have a game for the Wii already in progress. Basically they're saying they think Sony will

38:54.600 --> 38:58.800
do very well, they're saying Xbox 360 will do very well, and they're saying Xbox 360

38:58.800 --> 39:04.480
is doing well over here, but they're really, really, really looking, it seems to me like

39:04.480 --> 39:07.220
they're really looking toward the Wii as their...

39:07.220 --> 39:11.200
And if Loki's list from part A is to be believed, the Metal Slug Anthology is that game they're

39:11.200 --> 39:12.200
working on.

39:12.200 --> 39:18.500
SNK previously announced a Metal Slug Anthology Wii game will use the new controller.

39:18.500 --> 39:25.020
They're also working a sixth game in the Metal Slug series, won't necessarily show up on

39:25.020 --> 39:26.440
all of the consoles.

39:26.440 --> 39:32.140
They're saying it is a 2D game, so they're not bringing it to the PS3 or Xbox 360 as

39:32.140 --> 39:33.140
it is.

39:33.140 --> 39:36.620
And you can guarantee that it's not going to be any different than the other five.

39:36.620 --> 39:37.620
Hey!

39:37.620 --> 39:40.220
The other games had different stuff in them when they kept releasing them.

39:40.220 --> 39:46.000
There were new characters, there were new attacks, and you had mummies, and hey!

39:46.000 --> 39:50.160
You know, SNK knows when they have a winner.

39:50.160 --> 39:51.600
I'm not going to knock Metal Slug.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.240
It is fun and that's what's important.

39:54.240 --> 39:55.960
They have a working formula.

39:55.960 --> 40:00.600
They add just enough stuff to make it a little different for whoever is playing it.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.920
I really think that if you've got something that works, if you have something that fans

40:03.920 --> 40:06.000
like, don't fuck with it.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.680
Well said.

40:08.680 --> 40:15.160
Alright, moving on, if you're downloading a lot of crap from E3 as I'm sure you guys

40:15.160 --> 40:20.980
Beware, guys, because if you're not downloading your stuff from a trusted website, then you

40:20.980 --> 40:24.460
might actually get some spyware hidden in there.

40:24.460 --> 40:25.460
Guess what?

40:25.460 --> 40:30.800
Spyware, folks, and the people that do that, in fact, one in particular is called Spy Falcon.

40:30.800 --> 40:34.980
There's a report running on GamesAreFun.com where somebody actually got this bug in there

40:34.980 --> 40:40.360
downloading E3 coverage, so I guess the spyware people are smartening up here and putting

40:40.360 --> 40:43.800
this stuff into, I guess, E3 videos or whatever.

40:43.800 --> 40:49.400
So please, guys, make sure you download all your E3 coverage from E3 on PSP.com because

40:49.400 --> 40:51.320
it's the only site we can trust.

40:51.320 --> 40:53.980
Unfortunately everybody else puts crap in there.

40:53.980 --> 40:58.180
By the way, Macintosh folks, if you think you're safe just because you run on Mac, Spy

40:58.180 --> 41:03.960
Falcon knows how to get into your Mac too, so watch out!

41:03.960 --> 41:07.040
Spyware pisses me off, I don't know about the rest of you, does Spyware piss you off

41:07.040 --> 41:08.040
Dark Sakura?

41:08.040 --> 41:11.880
Does it piss you off enough to want to do the FUs of the week?

41:11.880 --> 41:18.880
I hope so, because that's what's queued up.

41:27.280 --> 41:29.840
F you to a person

41:29.840 --> 41:31.960
whose name I will not

41:31.960 --> 41:33.760
say

41:33.760 --> 41:37.300
who decided to puck me out the last day of U3

41:37.300 --> 41:38.880
and

41:38.880 --> 41:42.720
act like an absolute child and involve himself in something that didn't involve him.

41:42.720 --> 41:48.560
Yeah, when two people have a fight and they've resolved it, don't get emo over it. Stay the

41:48.560 --> 41:54.560
fuck out of it. Pardon me for saying so. Other people's drama does not have to be your drama.

41:54.560 --> 41:59.520
Only children do that, okay? So grow up and get over it and get your shoes out of my car.

41:59.520 --> 42:13.760
I'm done. Wow. Uh, Loki! Um, fuck you to whoever is behind ruining G4 because, you know, I

42:13.760 --> 42:18.640
guess I'm the last one on the face here to realize G4 is no longer a gaming network,

42:18.640 --> 42:22.960
and you know, after, you know, browsing their section to find, oh look, there's nine hours

42:22.960 --> 42:27.080
of non-gaming programming on there. Whatever, okay, so I'm a little behind the game, but

42:27.080 --> 42:32.960
but mainly fucking ruining X-Play, I don't know if they've gotten lazy or what but their

42:32.960 --> 42:37.700
review of Beatmania just pissed me off with the whole lack of knowledge in the game and

42:37.700 --> 42:43.180
just basically saying, well it's not this game so it gets a 2 or whatever so fuck them

42:43.180 --> 42:50.920
for being lazy now, to me the whole network should burn to hell, I don't know.

42:50.920 --> 42:56.580
My F.U. of the Week goes to Jelly Belly's because for one, they're really addicting

42:56.580 --> 43:00.440
and they're hella good and make me fat, but that's not why I'm giving them the F.U.

43:00.440 --> 43:04.560
I'm giving them the F.U. because I bought this thing at the Jelly Belly's store and

43:04.560 --> 43:08.600
it's the hot buttered popcorn and it's this case and buttered popcorn Jelly Belly's are

43:08.600 --> 43:09.600
my favorite.

43:09.600 --> 43:10.600
They're so good.

43:10.600 --> 43:14.240
I know a lot of people think they're gross, but you suck because buttered popcorn is the

43:14.240 --> 43:15.240
best.

43:15.240 --> 43:19.300
Actually, next to toasted marshmallow, buttered popcorn is the best.

43:19.300 --> 43:23.060
This is the thing, I bought this because it was on sale for $5 and I'm like, cool, that's

43:23.060 --> 43:26.940
a lot of buttered popcorn jelly beans and it was like filling up here with all these

43:26.940 --> 43:27.940
jelly beans.

43:27.940 --> 43:34.580
Well, I come home and I open it and the damn thing is filled almost to the brim with styrofoam.

43:34.580 --> 43:38.980
There was only a handful of buttered popcorn jelly beans to fill out the top of that thing.

43:38.980 --> 43:44.780
I realize we're not on TV, you can't see that, but like an inch of that was filled

43:44.780 --> 43:49.260
with jelly beans to give the illusion and I should have known when I picked the damn

43:49.260 --> 43:52.560
thing up that it didn't feel full but I guess I don't know though because the

43:52.560 --> 43:56.040
styrofoam is in there it feels weighted free false advertising right there all

43:56.040 --> 43:59.940
that pissed me off no wonder it was discounted it was five so for five bucks

43:59.940 --> 44:03.300
I got a handful of jelly beans in this useless fucking tin I will never do

44:03.300 --> 44:07.480
anything with look at it every day to remind me how much I hate it

44:07.480 --> 44:12.440
hooray no don't do that cuz Jelly Belly's making fat no Jelly Belly's don't

44:12.440 --> 44:15.600
make you fat it's eating the Jelly Belly's that make you fat which is your

44:15.600 --> 44:26.600
Oh gross DT! What? Bringing up freaking super bacon. Disgusting. They have bacon jelly

44:26.600 --> 44:29.640
bellies can you believe that? That's nasty although I almost bought wild

44:29.640 --> 44:33.040
blackberry jelly bellies at the Winchester Mystery House. That's nasty! But

44:33.040 --> 44:38.160
coconut's my favorite. Alright Loki who's also a jelly belly eater right? I don't

44:38.160 --> 44:41.440
like jelly bellies. Really? I don't really like jelly beans anymore. I used to eat

44:41.440 --> 44:44.560
them as a kid but you know I'm just not really a huge fan of jelly beans

44:44.560 --> 44:51.560
games anymore. Naughty people at E3. Naughty naughty people. Fucking, hey dude, seriously,

44:52.440 --> 44:59.440
NCSoft, they have to pay a $5,000 fine because they were too noisy. Little whiny pussy segos,

44:59.680 --> 45:05.200
they turned noisy! They're detracting from our crappy games! So anyways, they... Wait,

45:05.200 --> 45:10.840
didn't Loki name Sega the booth of the show? Correct me if I'm wrong. No, I did not. Okay.

45:10.840 --> 45:14.320
I think you did. No I did not. I'm gonna go back and play, I could almost

45:14.320 --> 45:17.280
swear you named Sega your booth of the show. Why?

45:17.280 --> 45:21.880
Because it had full auto 2 and stuff. I'm almost positive you named Sega the show.

45:21.880 --> 45:25.600
No, I said Capcom had good 360 games. Oh whatever, whatever.

45:25.600 --> 45:29.960
So like little whiny bitches, they went and complained to the E3 management who

45:29.960 --> 45:33.640
I don't even know how the hell you can determine that

45:33.640 --> 45:38.200
you know, a booth is too noisy. Apparently they registered decibels. It was two

45:38.200 --> 45:42.220
decibels above you know where it should be so they have to pay five thousand dollars

45:42.220 --> 45:47.780
for that so you know ncsoff said fuck it who cares we're gonna play our music as loud as

45:47.780 --> 45:56.100
we want and they did that so yeah rock on you guys yeah Sega gets my uh whiny pussy

45:56.100 --> 46:07.620
of e3 awards so way to go all right um Sony move changing gears completely here uh Sony

46:07.620 --> 46:13.720
This is interesting because if you think about the PSP, they have tried to prevent homebrew

46:13.720 --> 46:14.720
so many times.

46:14.720 --> 46:18.020
They keep patching the damn thing over and over and they won't give up, but yet they

46:18.020 --> 46:22.960
are embracing homebrew on the PlayStation 3.

46:22.960 --> 46:27.680
The system development manager Izumi Kwanishi says that the console is going to ship with

46:27.680 --> 46:30.700
Linux built in, so you don't have to bother to figure out how to install it.

46:30.700 --> 46:35.660
It's going to be already installed on there, and Sony is saying, hey homebrew folks, go

46:35.660 --> 46:39.940
ahead and develop for this. This would be awesome. By the way, Sony will not be providing

46:39.940 --> 46:46.940
technical support or access to SDK libraries, but Linux support is there. That's a very

46:46.940 --> 46:49.100
strange policy when you consider the PSP.

46:49.100 --> 46:53.660
I'm glad that they put a free operating system on their hard drives. How very thoughtful

46:53.660 --> 46:57.140
of them.

46:57.140 --> 47:05.140
You know what will be interesting about this? I just thought of this just now. Is this there

47:05.140 --> 47:11.540
In a roundabout way, could this just be a big F you to the virtual console because just run a Linux emulator

47:12.180 --> 47:14.180
There you got all the old-school games you want

47:14.740 --> 47:19.780
If somebody perfects their Linux and Linux emulator like NES emulator for the PlayStation

47:20.020 --> 47:24.380
Did you think maybe Sony had this forethought when they saw that people were making this on the PSP?

47:24.380 --> 47:26.780
No, because they had Linux on PlayStation 2 as well

47:26.780 --> 47:31.260
Can't you don't you think Sony kind of realizes this is what's gonna happen. People are gonna make emulators on this

47:32.060 --> 47:33.500
probably

47:33.500 --> 47:34.900
hmm

47:34.900 --> 47:39.900
They're little bitches. That's what it comes down to, I mean, fucking little whiny bitch.

47:39.900 --> 47:44.900
But here's the thing, Sony, people gotta buy your console before they can program emulators for it.

47:44.900 --> 47:46.900
It's a win-win situation for Sony.

47:47.900 --> 47:53.900
Yeah, they gotta buy them first. That's the problem, though. That is the major problem, is getting people to buy your console.

47:53.900 --> 47:55.900
People will buy it.

47:55.900 --> 48:03.900
Alright, uh, Loki. How about, uh, how about that Nintendo Wii? What kind of, does that have Linux on it?

48:03.900 --> 48:10.060
no it doesn't have Linux on it but um apparently the E3 ones were running off of

48:10.620 --> 48:16.300
quasi GameCube hardware basically they were housed in GameCubes and stuff which is not surprising I

48:16.300 --> 48:20.460
mean it's a fucking dev kit it's running off of of course it's gonna be you know it's sort of based

48:20.460 --> 48:25.260
on the GameCube anyways not really a big surprise I don't get why this is such a huge uproar in the

48:25.260 --> 48:31.260
community right now like OMG the Wii was running off of GameCubes well well first off it was a

48:31.260 --> 48:36.100
a souped up game, it was a custom built GameCube or whatever, it wasn't an actual GameCube,

48:36.100 --> 48:40.980
but I seem to recall last year if you looked inside the little Xbox 360 boxes, you'd see

48:40.980 --> 48:45.500
an Apple logo because they were running off G5s which was a very strange thing, and then

48:45.500 --> 48:49.460
Sony this year, they just had it right there in the glass cases, we ain't running off PS3s,

48:49.460 --> 48:53.380
these are just server things, you know, they didn't even try to hide what they were really

48:53.380 --> 48:54.380
running off of.

48:54.380 --> 48:59.820
But guys, it's a trade show, if the consoles were done, they'd be out tomorrow, of course

48:59.820 --> 49:01.960
you're gonna see something still in progress.

49:01.960 --> 49:03.540
This is not surprising at all.

49:03.540 --> 49:07.960
It's just running off of... I mean it's basically a modified GameCube dev kit

49:07.960 --> 49:08.900
because it's

49:08.900 --> 49:11.540
based on the same architecture so...

49:11.540 --> 49:15.480
BlackWolf liked to clarify the hardware was Wii, the box it was housed in was

49:15.480 --> 49:18.220
just a GameCube. Okay, makes sense.

49:18.220 --> 49:20.920
But why is this a problem? Why are people

49:20.920 --> 49:26.460
blogging about this? Who cares anyway? It's a giant fucking case. It could be like the size of, you know,

49:26.460 --> 49:29.940
a giraffe, it wouldn't matter. And of course it wasn't GameCube hardware, their games were

49:29.940 --> 49:32.740
actually widescreen

49:32.740 --> 49:36.380
GameCube never really, I mean there's a couple games on GameCube that'll be widescreen, but

49:36.380 --> 49:41.320
shit, hardly any. And of course now our chat room, www.orangeword.com, click on chat,

49:41.320 --> 49:43.960
they're just going off on the Linux thing and they're doing on all, they're

49:43.960 --> 49:45.940
talking about everything you can install Linux on

49:45.940 --> 49:48.920
DJ Pooh Eater says, Linux on a Jelly Belly

49:48.920 --> 49:55.340
bastard. Hey, they put Linux on a toaster, why not? And Roz says, Linux on a plane

49:55.340 --> 49:59.500
uh-huh uh-huh

49:59.500 --> 50:01.080
I'll make the joke first

50:01.080 --> 50:03.340
Linux on Ridge Racer!

50:03.340 --> 50:05.720
There's actually somebody already beat you to that in chat. Damn it!

50:05.720 --> 50:07.800
Linux in Africa!

50:07.800 --> 50:09.520
Africa. Africa.

50:09.520 --> 50:10.540
With a K.

50:10.540 --> 50:12.980
Africa with a K. Linux 2, Linux in Africa.

50:12.980 --> 50:14.740
What the hell was Africa?

50:14.740 --> 50:18.640
Yeah. It was the monstrous digging up dirt game.

50:18.640 --> 50:21.140
I'm hoping it's Pokemon Snap but in Africa.

50:21.140 --> 50:24.900
I hope it's like, you know, big game hunter, you know, poachers. You are

50:24.900 --> 50:27.700
messed up big game poacher

50:27.700 --> 50:29.020
rhino hunter

50:29.020 --> 50:33.100
uh... moving on now let's talk about x box three sixty rumors abound that the

50:33.100 --> 50:36.220
x box three sixty is going to get a final fantasy title as well

50:36.220 --> 50:40.180
uh... the three sixty supposedly going to get one of the fabulous nova chrysalis

50:40.180 --> 50:43.260
final fantasy thirteen is you know it's a it's a series here

50:43.260 --> 50:47.460
uh... is that there is the there's two of them on the playstation three and

50:47.460 --> 50:51.180
then one of them on the mobile phone

50:51.180 --> 50:54.140
well here's the here's the interesting thing supposedly

50:54.140 --> 50:58.060
they've actually even trademark a new name with Final Fantasy 13

50:58.060 --> 51:01.460
what so that there's there's there's a there's another

51:01.460 --> 51:05.300
sub game that might be out on the 360 I know isn't that crazy

51:05.300 --> 51:09.100
release 1.4

51:09.100 --> 51:12.340
what the hell I know I don't

51:12.340 --> 51:16.320
I don't it's weird I don't you know we don't know enough about the series yet

51:16.320 --> 51:19.420
to know if this is justifiable or not well I know the mobile game is not going

51:19.420 --> 51:21.900
to be justifiable under any circumstances gotta buy them all

51:21.900 --> 51:26.780
But I'm curious to see what is in the works of the other ones.

51:26.780 --> 51:30.580
Again, the 360 thing is just a rumor at this stage, you guys, and sounds like it might

51:30.580 --> 51:36.820
be a little bit of hopeful MS fanboy thinking, but at the same time, it's not impossible.

51:36.820 --> 51:37.820
Final Fantasy XI is on 360.

51:37.820 --> 51:41.820
I heard that I might be on the live arcade.

51:41.820 --> 51:42.820
That would be very interesting.

51:42.820 --> 51:45.780
You know, why don't you support the phone game to the live arcade or something?

51:45.780 --> 51:47.060
Make it better.

51:47.060 --> 51:48.060
That's a better idea.

51:48.060 --> 51:52.380
Why don't isn't I don't know why don't they just create ein hander 2 instead

51:53.380 --> 51:57.140
Well put it's Final Fantasy. It's time to change the name

51:57.140 --> 51:57.540
All right

51:57.540 --> 52:03.420
Our skype lines gonna be open very very soon here if you want to call in it's 9 1 6 2 2 6 90 67

52:03.420 --> 52:07.520
Please note that is not an 800 number. So there may be a toll toll charge incurred

52:08.060 --> 52:10.260
So use your cell phone that has nationwide calling

52:11.100 --> 52:14.620
Also, but make sure you have good reception because I hate it when we get bad cells

52:14.620 --> 52:20.900
But the better way to call on the show is to use the skype line and that is Skype username orange lounge radio

52:21.420 --> 52:25.440
We're gonna be open up right after this story Loki and be sure to also

52:26.260 --> 52:30.220
Call echo one to ask call echo one two three first if you're using Skype

52:31.720 --> 52:33.720
anyways, so

52:36.220 --> 52:38.220
Speaking of games coming out

52:38.220 --> 52:43.980
Capcom saying that they're going to have both Resident Evil 5 and Devil May Cry 4

52:43.980 --> 52:46.060
playable at the Tokyo Game Show this year.

52:46.060 --> 52:49.340
So that's excellent. We'll get to see that.

52:49.340 --> 52:50.820
Hey, that's

52:50.820 --> 52:53.620
just in time for the Playstation 3 launch

52:53.620 --> 52:55.140
in a few months afterwards.

52:55.140 --> 52:59.380
But I'm sure those aren't going to be the launch titles.

52:59.380 --> 53:00.380
But hey, more games!

53:00.380 --> 53:04.420
Can knock that. You know what, I was really impressed with their games.

53:04.420 --> 53:07.620
Lost Planet and Dead Rising is here.

53:07.620 --> 53:09.620
That Dead Rising game sounds hella fun, I'm sad I missed it.

53:09.620 --> 53:10.620
More power to it.

53:10.620 --> 53:12.620
I heard other podcasts talking about it and now I'm really interested.

53:12.620 --> 53:14.620
Dead Rising is really fun.

53:14.620 --> 53:16.620
Definitely gotta check it out.

53:16.620 --> 53:22.620
It lived up to my expectations of it, so I can't wait.

53:22.620 --> 53:29.620
Alright, our Skype line is open over at www.orangelaungeradio.com.

53:43.300 --> 53:45.300
Hi, you're on orange lounge radio

53:45.300 --> 53:48.780
Hi, this is Ravens dolphin. Hello Ravens dolphin. What's on your mind?

53:49.740 --> 53:50.920
well

53:50.920 --> 53:52.920
the all game

53:53.200 --> 53:58.040
The as you broke up there a little bit you say the all games thing. Yeah. Okay. What about it?

53:58.040 --> 54:01.040
I thought it was great, great coverage.

54:01.040 --> 54:06.040
We thought it was great too, thank you. What did you particularly like about it?

54:06.040 --> 54:09.040
Everything, but I just have one question for you.

54:09.040 --> 54:10.040
Me?

54:10.040 --> 54:15.040
Yeah, what you thought of Alon from Chatterbox Game Show?

54:15.040 --> 54:22.040
He was pretty nice, I mean it was weird because we met while Bobby's show was going on, so we didn't really have a chance to like,

54:22.040 --> 54:26.080
Like, hi, this is Alon, and hi, this is Rob, and you guys will be doing a show together.

54:26.080 --> 54:29.600
We just kind of got put on stage together, but he seemed like a nice guy, and he's pretty

54:29.600 --> 54:31.160
passionate about what he does.

54:31.160 --> 54:36.240
Yeah, but he came off of an asshole, but I listen to his show every day, but I didn't

54:36.240 --> 54:38.800
know how he came out like that.

54:38.800 --> 54:43.480
You know, sometimes people just have, I'm going to be bluntly honest, I've had very

54:43.480 --> 54:47.260
little time to listen to other podcasts, and his is one of them that's on my I want to

54:47.260 --> 54:51.520
listen to it but I haven't yet, but remember that sometimes people come off on the radio

54:51.520 --> 54:55.260
a lot different than they do in real life like if you ever watch that movie

54:55.260 --> 54:56.500
about Howard Stern

54:56.500 --> 55:00.140
you can tell he's a different man than he is on the radio so you know

55:00.140 --> 55:03.500
that might just be the radio persona thing but he was a nice guy in person

55:03.500 --> 55:07.020
I'm not gonna knock him, he was a nice guy. Oh yeah I do believe that

55:07.020 --> 55:10.260
I believe that it's just he just came off different

55:10.260 --> 55:13.700
on his show he's down to earth but it's

55:13.700 --> 55:17.500
it didn't sound too good he didn't like he was

55:17.500 --> 55:18.820
aggravated

55:18.820 --> 55:19.620
to death

55:19.620 --> 55:23.380
well i got a shift this topic i we don't want to knock other podcasts especially

55:23.380 --> 55:25.680

Ridge Racer.

56:16.140 --> 56:17.140
Please let us die.

56:17.140 --> 56:18.140
No, it says it in his bio.

56:18.140 --> 56:19.140
It says Ridge Racer.

56:19.140 --> 56:20.140
Couldn't resist.

56:20.140 --> 56:23.780
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

56:23.780 --> 56:26.620
As much as I cost, you get my own theme song.

56:26.620 --> 56:28.660
La la la la la la la la.

56:28.660 --> 56:30.500
There you go.

56:30.500 --> 56:33.980
We had somebody sing our FU theme, so you get your theme song sung.

56:33.980 --> 56:34.980
What's up?

56:34.980 --> 56:35.980
Not much.

56:35.980 --> 56:36.980
It's the one and only Ronma.

56:36.980 --> 56:37.980
How you guys doing?

56:37.980 --> 56:38.980
Uh, good Ronma.

56:38.980 --> 56:42.980
Why aren't you coming to Fauna Mae?

56:42.980 --> 56:46.980
2007. Alright, fair enough.

56:46.980 --> 56:50.980
What's on your mind? Seriously. What are you calling about tonight? Couple things. First I want to say congratulations

56:50.980 --> 56:54.980
for Loki for getting married. Ah, thank you.

56:54.980 --> 56:58.980
May the gods have mercy on your soul.

56:58.980 --> 57:02.980
She's a nice girl. She hates games, but she's a nice girl.

57:02.980 --> 57:06.980
Actually she's not a nice girl, but she's funny. That's what makes it worth it.

57:06.980 --> 57:08.980
Good enough, good enough.

57:08.980 --> 57:11.980
Alright, do you have anything game related you want to ask about?

57:11.980 --> 57:13.980
I have a couple of things.

57:13.980 --> 57:18.980
I was at Nintendo World for E3 2006 press conference and I have tons of pictures to that.

57:18.980 --> 57:20.980
Ooh, where are they going to be at?

57:20.980 --> 57:23.980
On my website that I'm posting right now.

57:23.980 --> 57:26.980
In chat room there, it looks like djramas.net.

57:26.980 --> 57:29.980
Follow the linky links once you get in there.

57:29.980 --> 57:31.980
Yes, and it was pretty awesome.

57:31.980 --> 57:35.980
After the whole presentation, they had like a party to celebrate the one year anniversary.

57:35.980 --> 57:38.380
Then they had like a nice VIP party at the end.

57:39.380 --> 57:39.880
Cool.

57:40.780 --> 57:45.880
And, um, I have more pictures of me at Nintendo World meeting Reggie Phil's aims.

57:46.180 --> 57:53.780
Actually, wait, before we get into you meeting Reggie, did the catering at the Nintendo party have those potato things with bacon and cheddar in them?

57:54.380 --> 58:01.280
No, all we had was like, quote-unquote, like, phony, like, alcoholic drinks, but they were just regular soda and crap like that.

58:01.280 --> 58:03.780
Okay, because E3 Outpost had the potato things.

58:03.780 --> 58:04.980
He was at the Nintendo party?

58:04.980 --> 58:05.480
Delicious.

58:05.480 --> 58:08.920
You know, no, he was at the at the store on the East Coast

58:08.920 --> 58:11.880
Oh like, you know how at e3 outpost we had like a viewing party

58:11.880 --> 58:15.840
That was like all the podcasters watching it. That was that was what they did, but at the store

58:16.200 --> 58:22.960
So they had like these mini tacos quesadillas and mini hamburgers and stuff. All right, tell us about Reggie. I

58:24.160 --> 58:27.640
Asked him why I asked him

58:28.600 --> 58:33.320
He's like we is everything we is all about us. We is awesome

58:33.320 --> 58:37.600
I think I wanted to smack him for saying that we is awesome

58:38.360 --> 58:40.360
Yes

58:40.520 --> 58:47.000
And it's you know what that that's a really odd response that sounds like a textbook response to me like in the you know

58:47.480 --> 58:51.940
FAQs for a PR person. Here's what to say when asked asked this

58:53.240 --> 58:57.720
Did it sound a little textbook to you when he said it very much so

58:58.960 --> 59:00.960
hmm, all right

59:00.960 --> 59:05.480
Anything else you want to share about your experiences there at the store? No, it was pretty much fun

59:05.480 --> 59:11.240
It was crowded and I could have heard people crapping their pants after seeing the whole presentation

59:11.240 --> 59:16.580
Especially for me for seeing Starbucks guys put all those Nintendo fanboys under under one roof

59:16.580 --> 59:19.600
And it must have just smelled awful by the time it was over. Oh

59:20.280 --> 59:25.440
Lord you have no idea. All right, you know, it was even us at the outpost were kind of going

59:25.440 --> 59:29.840
Oh, ah interesting when the Star Fox thing came up. We were like damn neat cool

59:29.840 --> 59:34.640
So alright Rama, we're gonna let you go so we get more calls in. Okay, take it love a good one, buddy

59:34.640 --> 59:38.840

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:56.880
You know, I guess so, because a lot of our chatters are from all around, and theyíre

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.160
all too cheap to travel or canít afford it or whatever, so you might beóI hope we have

more than one person that shows up at the panel though, or Iíll be sad.

I said youíve got to help us advertise and get the word out at the con, that weíre doing

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.640

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.640
that and uh dark chakra

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:36.920
what um what kind of chocolate do you like most

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:42.160
cuz I need to give you that I think you said what what chocolate is that what you

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:42.520
asked

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:47.740
what chocolate I you broke up there is that the was that the question what

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:48.400
chocolate

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.960
No, what kind of chocolate do you like best?

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.000
Because remember a couple episodes ago, you were saying they have to...

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Right, I said chocolate.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
There you go.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.520
I am a big fan of dark chocolate, especially anything that's 75% cocoa.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.520
What kind of brands?

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.520
Give them a hint.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.520
Drost.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.520
Lindt.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.520
Basically, the Belgian brand.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.520
Lindt?

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.520
You mean this one?

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.520
L-I-N-D-T.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.520
I can't blame you, man.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.520
L-I-N-D-T.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.520
All right.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.520
But Drost is one of my favorites.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.520
Those truffles are like crap

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:25.400
Dark chocolate will see I only eat dark chocolate because milk chocolate is kind of not good for you and white chocolate is made out

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:30.520
Of the leftover milk fat when they make regular chocolate. Why is it that every fucking week this show turns into the Food Network?

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:40.040
Without fail I must say that when it comes to chocolate I am a big fan of dark dark chocolate

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.580
So, thank you for appeasing my chocolate craving

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.580
No problem.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:46.580
You're my hero now.

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:47.580
Alright.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.580
Alright.

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:49.580
Yeah.

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:50.580
Spirit Snare, anything else on your mind?

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.580
Nope.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:52.580
Five more days.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:53.580
What?

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:54.580
Five more days.

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:55.580
That's right.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:00.720
And then you get to meet us in the flesh and be disappointed with our underwhelming presence

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.720
in person.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.200
Alright, have a good one, Spirit Snare.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.200
Okay.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.200
Take care.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.200
Thanks.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.200
Good night.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.200
Good night.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.200
We're getting a call over here.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.200
Who's this?

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.400
I remembered what I wanted to talk about.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.400
Alright.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.400
Welcome back.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.400
Welcome back.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.400
What is it?

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.480
Um, I was seeing if you guys were interested in something.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.480
Okay.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:28.880
Um, for a Nintendo I do get the Wii early, and I was wondering if the listeners and you

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.480
guys would be interested in me buying one out of my own pocket, donating it to OLR and

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.720
you guys giving it away on the long-range date.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.600
Um, fuck yes.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.600
Fuck yes.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.600
Okay.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.600
Woo!

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.280
What's that? What's the deal here? What do we have to give you something out of this or oh?

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:52.020
Do we well do we get to play it first because if we get it early we're gonna crack that shit open and play with

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.620
it

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:59.500
But I guess you guys can give away a quote-unquote slightly used week on we'll we'll autograph it or something that'll make it

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:06.000
Yeah, it'll be the special olr edition. We that's what we'll do. We'll get out an orange highlighter and color it orange screw that

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.880
Oh, I'll spray paint it there you go

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.240
yeah we'll spray paint the Wii and we'll give away the world's only orange Wii

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:16.600
it'd be great I it would work in regards to the launch date I don't think it's

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:23.180
gonna be October oh why is that um seeing as if it's an October launch date

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:28.320
we haven't seen any titles come into my department yet mm-hmm if it comes

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.760
out in October that gives us less than six months to test the console and we

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.360
would probably be a bit rushed by that so I would probably say shoot more for

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:44.040
November. Did you guys test those E3 demos? I personally did not. I got to screw with

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:49.680
some of them because the company has their own little mini E3 at Nintendo, but I did

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:55.680
not personally test any of the Wii demos. Well, I don't know. Maybe there will be a

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:00.640
lot of overtime coming. The evidence for October is still pretty good the way we are looking

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:06.600
at it, but we are not necessarily claiming that is the definitive date. We are just saying

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.060
Hey, here's some evidence that makes it look pretty strong. It's gonna be October, but you know you bring up a good time

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.680
Well, let it maybe you'll get it in next week

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:20.160
Hopefully all right. Well. We got to go. We're gonna take one more call. Okay, all right. Take care guys. Bye

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.480
All right one last call hi. You're on orange launch radio

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.720
Who's this?

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:34.240
And Tim X4 yes on the talk about little things all right make it quick. What's up wait wait hang on?

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.520
Let me turn down the volume stream.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.520
Hang on to one.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.520
Please do.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.520
All right.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.520
Okay, can you hear me?

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.520
Yes, we can.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.520
What's up?

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.520
Oh, crap.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.880
I turned down the volume on the entire thing.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.240
Oh, my God.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.240
Okay.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:49.240
Hi.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.240
You there?

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.240
Yeah.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.240
Technical difficulties.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.240
All right.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.240
No, it's listener difficulties.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.240
That's all right, buddy.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.240
What's on your mind?

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.240
Okay.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.040
First off, I'm disappointed about the whole video card thing.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:09.880
You need a big video card for doing certain things with N64 games on PCs, because in three

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:14.340
weeks I'll be going to New York for this arch that my sister is in, and we're not going

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:19.280
to take our van with TV and stuff that I normally play video games with, because where are you

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.880
going to park in New York?

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.880
Parking garages.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.720
Our van's not going to fit.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:30.400
So I was going to take my laptop and stuff and do games on there.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.800
Okay, well, you know, you'll just have to play something else, unfortunately.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.360
There's lots of computer games out there.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.360
Bring a 64.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:41.360
Yeah, well, or just take a DS, it's a 64 in a box.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.880
Well, I'm kind of doing it for multiplayer.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.880
Alright.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:52.840
And also, Loki, have you checked out Rush 2049 yet?

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.200
I've played it before, yeah.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.840
OK, cool.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.880
Because I mentioned a couple, like,

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.120
Yeah, I remember some phone call talking about this

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.440
a while back.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.080
All right, we've got to let you go.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.360
We're wrapping up.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.160
OK, that's fine.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.600
Because I forgot what I was going to say.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.320
That's all right.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.920
What is with people forgetting tonight?

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.320
All right, have a good one.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.980
What is with people forgetting tonight?

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.680
Something in the air.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.960
It's because all you people have your attention diverted

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.760
with the Desperate Housewives finale or something.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.960
I'm just kidding, I really hope you're not watching that.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.880
Moving on, Last Minute Stories.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.860
We have to give our listeners more credit than that.

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:32.700
Anyone, anyone?

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:35.240
Actually, I have friends that watch the show

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.640
and say it's great, it's just not my thing.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.960
I'm turning into Jamie, there's no show I've been watching.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.520
I haven't even watched The Soup for three weeks,

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.760
that's rare for me, because that's like my favorite show.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.800
I don't watch anything at all.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.360
That's been me lately.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.160
Anyway, DarkSakura, Last Minute Stories.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:55.440
Xbox Live hits 24 million downloads over 600 terabytes of data were transferred

01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:01.880
during e3 Wow the week of e3 which is 30 times more data than is found on all the

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:05.880
printed material in the US Library of Congress I contributed to that number

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:11.260
we all did well we had them downloading lost planet at the three outposts you

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:17.740
and then we played Uno but the single most popular item downloaded for Xbox

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:23.460
Live Marketplace was the trailer for Halo 3, but the rest of the download chart shows

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:28.100
that the playable demos were more popular than the videos in general.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:33.780
They had Lost Planet, Test Drive Unlimited, and MotoGP 06.

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.820
So that was a bit of Microsoft news.

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:37.820
Awesome.

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:39.540
Like a hot dog.

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:45.260
Black Wolf would like to point out Uno greater than Lost Planet.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:46.260
Amen.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:50.340
says we downloaded the halo 3 trailer at the outpost 2 I didn't see it there I

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:54.500
didn't see it till I got home Bobby you need to add Gunstar underscore hero to

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.820
your yes you know you just gave that away to all our listeners fine that's my

01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:03.620
husband I won't tell anybody what mine is all right cuz I don't have one all

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:09.560
right uh Loki any last-minute stories yeah you happen to buy a DS light here

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:15.540
next month or so you do know you can put homebrew stuff on there really really

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:19.660
Really simple.

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:24.500
Datel actually has their Max Media Launcher, which, guess what, works just like one of

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:28.260
those PassMe keys that they used to have, so you can put all this wonderful stuff on

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.260
there.

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:35.220
Including homebrew, including such things as ScummVMDS, which is for running Monkey

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:44.380
Island and Data Tentacles, SamiMax, etc., DS Linux, and of course an IRC program, among

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:51.260
other homebrew apps. And that Daedel thing, I believe, has carried most major retailers.

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:57.940
I think even they had it at Best Buy and GameStop and stuff, so check it out.

01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:02.060
Chat Room is pointing out I actually cut Dark Sakura off before she got her husband's full

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:08.220
screen name out. I don't think you got the second word of his screen name out, but that's

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:12.320
okay because if you're smart and you know what kind of games Jamie plays, you can figure

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:19.220
out what the screen name is it's not mine yeah gunstar come on I don't I said

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:25.500
it oh I thought you just talked over me okay if you're in a chat room you'll

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:29.140
know what it is if you really want to know what it is you can send me an email

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:35.140
to Jamie at orange on radio.com I got one of those a 360 blogs for my gamer

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:39.060
tag which is on the if you really want to know it it's on the olr forum I don't

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:44.060
I don't think Dan would come close to doing anything like that. He just plays lots of Uno these days.

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.060
Yeah, that's all you're gonna see is Dan playing Uno.

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:51.060
Alright, let's get to the very last story of the evening and Loki's gonna bring it to you. Loki.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:56.060
Yes, have you ever thought, you know, the Wii just not interactive enough?

01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:04.060
Well, you know what, maybe you should be at E3 next year because they're bringing you,

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:08.060
and this is not from Nintendo, mind you, the Nintendo amusement park.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:14.820
park. It's this live, they're calling it physical augmented reality. It's a real life obstacle

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:21.520
course which a player jumps through a bunch of different levels and stuff using a power

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:27.680
harness provided by them. And there's nothing digital, nothing projected, and nothing really

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.940
virtual. It's just kind of silly fun I guess. But if you are interested in it, check it

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:42.220
out at nintendoamusementpark.com, and it's just weird.

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:46.740
You know the first thought that went through my mind when I read Nintendo Amusement Park?

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:51.580
Nintendo Amusement Park, where the lines are four hours long.

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:55.840
But yeah, it's just very strange.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:02.460
They have a video on their website though showing the ridiculousness of it, and it's

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.460
interesting.

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:09.100
Alright, we're gonna wrap it up kids. That's it for tonight's show, which I think might be our longest to date

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.220
I think we're running on three hours just about here just shy of three hours

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:16.020
We gotta go around again. Oh, yes. Love you. Sorry. I forgot one more thing

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:19.580
All right, make it quick prey demo coming to Xbox Live on

01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:22.260
June 22nd. All right

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:25.480
Now I want to finish this. Can we finish? All right

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:29.780
