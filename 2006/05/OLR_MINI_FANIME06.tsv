229	910	Orange Lounge Radio
51514	56477	Alright, we are here live at Foname 2006, Orange Lounge Radio.
56497	61300	We're taping our podcast here in front of, you know, dozens and dozens of people.
63262	64462	Dozens and dozens of people.
64903	69646	You know what though, there's more people in here now than listened to the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio, so it's alright.
70126	72908	Technically there's dozens of people in the other room in front of us.
73208	75209	Yeah, listening to the rock concert, so it counts.
75650	78071	Anyway, my name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
78111	80773	Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
81013	81373	Yo.
82173	84054	And what are you dressed up as today, DarkSakura?
84354	87454	Temari from Naruto, only in the manga so far.
87615	89715	She's cosplaying today, boys and girls.
90155	94216	And isn't, though, the Naruto thing kind of played out when it comes to cosplay?
94476	96296	It isn't when you only have a week to make your costume.
96537	97677	Excuses, excuses.
98197	100637	Next year, you need to... Next year is going to be a lot.
100657	102498	This dude's got an interdict costume back there.
102518	104478	Tim is always the best.
104658	105739	Okay, how is that?
105779	107479	We have our Starblazers costumes.
107725	108245	That's awesome.
108905	110366	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
110766	110946	Hi.
111166	111366	All right.
111386	113747	So this is actually the second time we're recording the intro.
113767	114827	Thanks to Tech Master Loki.
115087	115407	Thank you.
115627	115907	All right.
116408	116568	Hey.
116588	117028	But that's okay.
117048	119108	Through the magic of radio, it'll all be brought together.
119529	123810	At least we figured that out about 10 minutes in and not all the way in.
124130	128071	Like an interview I did at E3 a couple years ago with Jason Enos.
128091	128591	You know what?
128671	129692	I still hate you for that.
129992	130252	I know.
130312	132472	Loki asked Jason Enos.
132592	135093	Jason Enos is the guy who produces the DDR games.
135313	137374	Asked him point blank what he thinks about In the Groove.
137725	139725	and the answer's lost forever thanks to yours truly.
141166	141486	Whoops!
142266	146547	All right, anyway, we like to start off the show talking about our gaming week and what we've been playing.
146627	149748	So, DarkSakura, what kind of stuff have you been playing this week on the game scene?
150408	156190	I played Metal Slug 5, big shock to everybody, on Friday.
156630	158890	Have they increased the graphics yet on Metal Slug?
159310	159510	No.
159530	159770	Okay.
159790	160111	That's all right.
160291	164712	But you can shoot more people and stab people and get heavy machine gun.
164812	165372	Cool death.
165592	166012	More often.
166833	171899	Apparently they have Metal Slug 6 in the e-gaming room, so I have to go check that out later.
172119	172419	Right on.
172940	178065	And I played Ragnarok online, I played World of Warcraft, I'm still level 7, go me.
180027	184411	And then I played some Kingdom Hearts, and I've played a little bit of everything.
184472	185813	And Dana's still playing Uno.
185833	185893	Uno.
186670	189291	I've been tempted to go back to World of Warcraft a little bit.
189471	189872	You should.
189932	190412	You should.
190472	191192	Be a noob with me.
191272	193614	I don't want to play two MMOs.
194094	195295	I'm playing two MMOs.
195315	200797	My link shell on Final Fantasy XI is going to hate me if I don't play more and get up to level 70 so I can do Dynamis with them.
201078	203579	But also, we got another pinball machine.
204299	204900	Ooh, what'd you get?
205120	208301	Johnny Mnemonic, which pisses me off because we were supposed to have a Doctor Who.
208882	212143	Now, please tell me the Johnny Mnemonic table is not as crappy as the movie was.
212243	213484	It's supposed to be a pretty good table.
213544	215045	I was too upset with it to look at it.
216345	216845	DarkNight2000 DarkNight2000
238678	239658	New Super Mario Bros.
239878	240338	That was fun.
241038	244899	And played a little bit of Ridge Racer 6, which is really cool.
245259	251920	And then, of course, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on the 360 because, yeah, it was fun shooting people.
252380	254141	Let me guess, easy achievement points, huh?
254801	255521	Actually, it is.
257201	259302	Loki's an achievement points whore.
259522	262102	But then, I think that's pretty much it.
262222	265023	A little bit bejeweled just because we have it now.
265723	266803	I don't know why I bought that game.
267543	268583	Nellie likes it more than I do.
269063	269243	What?
271824	272424	I bought it for you.
272984	273364	That's right.
273585	274205	Yeah, see?
276425	281146	For everyone hearing only half of this conversation, we've got Nellie looking a little bit upset.
282887	284407	Or a little bit WTF.
286248	287368	All right, so anyways, yeah, that's it.
287870	298475	All right, my gaming week's been interesting because I actually am playing a sports game, which if you know me, I don't really get into a lot of sports titles because, you know, I don't get mad.
298495	301796	And yeah, the last like sport game I really got into is probably Blades of Steel.
302116	306198	But I'll tell you what, there's a great sports game out for the 360 right now that I'm having a lot of fun with.
306338	307599	It's Rockstar Table Tennis.
307939	311741	Oh, that's funny because I thought you said sports and table tennis in the same sentence.
311801	312121	Shut up.
312521	316902	Who would have thought that Rockstar, who made these Grand Theft Auto games, would make such a fun little sports title?
317202	318902	I like it because it's really easy to pick up.
318962	320582	It's easy to kind of get into it.
320602	322183	It's got a really good training mode with it.
322483	325563	The only downside is that I would have liked... It's table tennis?
325823	326683	No, it's fun.
326763	328584	It didn't have any character creation.
328604	331604	I'm wondering how they have time to make games when they're busy being sued.
332504	333184	Who, Rockstar?
333765	335465	But they're not going to get sued over table tennis.
335485	335845	You can't.
335885	337165	There's no... Unless there's a hidden sex scene.
337185	337385	That's it.
337405	338765	I'm suing them over table tennis.
338885	340346	No, what if there's a hidden sex scene?
340566	342186	Because you know what girls can do with ping pong balls.
345011	348013	Anyway, but I don't think that's in there, so forget it.
348793	352734	But I've been having a lot of fun with it, and it's really easy to pick up, and the online mode plays pretty well.
352754	366240	I was actually playing against some guy on the East Coast this morning, and it was cool because I haven't really played a lot of games on Xbox where people have been nice to talk to, because if you play Halo 2, you get a lot of little kids on there going, I'm going to kick your ass.
367065	370187	You know, but on table tennis, I had some pleasant conversation.
370327	374028	Because if you say I'm going to kick your ass in table tennis, that sounds retarded.
374129	378110	Well, no, the guy asked me if I actually played real table tennis or if I was just playing the game.
378231	378771	Oh, my God.
378791	380232	He probably plays real table tennis.
380252	380492	He does.
380532	382733	Oh, my God, they made a game for me, finally.
382793	387215	He told me he plays real table tennis, and I'm like, this must bug the hell out of you that you can't control the characters.
387235	392418	All those people that play table tennis and own a 360, the demographic has finally been realized.
393578	395119	You know what's great about it, though, is it's cheap.
395709	398912	It's relatively cheap for a 360 title, and it's fun.
399032	399573	I liked it.
399993	401695	It's definitely something you guys should rent.
401875	409021	I mean, it's not going to be a game for everybody, but rent it, check it out, read the reviews, see if it's something that sounds like you'd be interested in, and I think you'd be surprised.
409141	409402	I was.
409762	416428	Or wait and buy Hitman, which also came out the week after, which is probably a far superior game.
416769	417369	All right, whatever.
417549	418150	And it's killing.
418350	419171	Let's get into some news.
419211	420252	We only have a little bit of time here.
420292	421493	We want to talk about the Wii.
421853	428776	Now, last week on the program, we made a bold prediction stating that October 18th would be the release date for the Wii.
428816	435259	And Loki, remind us real quick for the crowd here who may not have heard the show, why did we come to an October 18th speculated date?
435439	436259	Well, a couple things.
436379	442322	First off, we have a few dates actually from three or four different publishers right now.
443122	447424	and S&K, THQ, and God, I can't remember the last one.
447764	454886	Anyways, they've all agreed that the date is going to... Well, they have games coming out on October 11th and also October 18th.
455286	459267	And usually, you know, you have games come out before the release date and on the release date.
459307	460548	Now, when you say we have dates...
461138	462500	You're talking about your distributor?
462600	462841	Yes.
463101	463923	Okay.
464363	469832	The other thing is that October 18th happens to mark the anniversary of the original Nintendo Entertainment System.
470674	474280	What a nice way to celebrate the virtual console with the 8-bit downloads, right?
474815	482979	Of course, and so of course it makes perfect sense that they're going to release it on the anniversary because Nintendo likes doing things like that.
483199	493864	Now by itself that doesn't seem like compelling evidence, but when you consider that you've got three publishers who've all targeted the same date and put it in the distributor system, that's too much of a coincidence to ignore.
494460	518338	and you know I read another story on the internet this week that was from I think a British site that was talking about they're anticipating the release of the Wii to be November 20th over there because I guess Red Steel showed up and some computer over there is November 20th which is a confirmed launch title and typically there's a one month delay between US and Europe so you roll one month back from November 20th and you're just barely there within that same time frame so makes a lot of sense
518758	529825	Now granted, take this with a grain of salt, somebody called into the show last week who has ties with Nintendo who said, nope, October 18th can't be the date, we haven't seen enough of it here, but the coincidences keep piling up, don't they, Loki?
529925	535249	Yes, because Konami also gave us just this week information about Elebits and...
536312	537853	Yeah, funny enough, it's coming out on the 18th.
538573	539133	Of October.
539433	539653	Yeah.
540894	541434	Very interesting.
541454	543054	More and more coincidences.
543214	543754	Very interesting.
544075	544855	What about prices?
545175	546395	Do you guys get info on prices?
546635	554778	Yeah, we're actually THQ on their two games, both the SpongeBob Creature from the Krusty Krab and Avatar The Last Airbender.
554858	556078	Both those games are going to be priced at $49.99.
558029	563651	It seems to be keeping the same price points that you'd see now in current generation titles, but hopefully they'll go down a little bit.
564091	564291	Awesome.
564491	568232	Now, first party titles typically run a little cheaper than third parties though, right?
568373	568713	Usually.
568813	571073	So possibly we might have Mario Galaxy for $39?
572094	572434	Maybe.
572634	573634	Zelda Twilight Princess, $39?
573714	575115	I don't know.
575215	575535	I don't know.
576195	578116	If they can milk more money out of Zelda, I think they'll charge $49.
578956	579236	Don't you?
579496	580097	Definitely.
580477	580737	All right.
581621	582842	Takahashi Keita Katamari Damashii
598132	601354	That guy is kind of eccentric, isn't he?
601775	602455	A little.
602475	604877	He's like, I'm not going to do video games anymore.
604957	607279	I'm going to go design playground equipment for children.
607899	610581	Well, a quote of his is, I'm not really interested in the Wii.
610641	613823	I don't think a controller should have that much influence on the enjoyment of games.
614043	617125	I mean, he's basically going on saying he understands that, yeah, they're excited.
617726	622129	The controller will allow this to happen and this to happen, but they're putting too much emphasis on the controller.
622909	626672	He has also confirmed that he is no longer working on any Katamari Damacy games.
626752	629773	However, Namco is releasing more without him.
630354	633676	And if the PSP one is any indication, yeah.
634318	642539	Now, I could agree with that, though, that, you know, right now it looks like the Wii is all emphasizing on the motion.
642579	643440	But, you know, that's a selling point.
643720	649161	And you think about Nintendo, when they first showed the DS, they had a lot of touch-heavy things that were going into that.
649441	651501	And it seemed like Nintendo was going to whore the touchscreen.
651721	653161	And to an extent, the launch titles did.
653221	659823	But now it's settled down a little bit, and you look at a game like New Super Mario Bros., it's a perfect balance for the DS.
660063	662043	And so I think the Wii will go that route, too.
662452	664433	Well, he did make another semi-announcement, too.
664593	665073	Ooh, what's that?
665293	667373	About what he's doing next.
667493	671255	He says, all I can say is it'll be on a next-gen console, and it will be fun.
671575	672115	That's all I can say.
672135	673895	So he is doing games still.
673915	674275	He's doing games.
674295	675536	Didn't he say he wasn't going to do games?
676136	679417	He's going to do Playground Designer Tycoon.
679717	680637	Playground of Doom.
680917	681657	Sim Playground.
683138	683978	All right, well, we'll see.
684818	687959	Anyway, let's talk about the PlayStation 3 for a little bit.
688499	690440	Actually, no, this has to do with the Wii, too, doesn't it, Loki?
691289	692570	Yeah, about that.
692931	701658	Actually, there was a survey done for Fumitsu Magazine, which they were basically polling their readers to which next-gen system they were looking forward to.
702479	706603	And interesting enough, the Wii pretty much won out.
706943	712848	73% of the vote was towards the Wii, with PS3 coming in second at 22.6%, and the 360 only getting a measly 4.4%.
716988	721250	One of the things, though, that they were also questioning was the price of the system.
722070	732375	And it's quite funny that most of the readers of Fumitsu found that the PS3 was way too damn expensive, and even they wouldn't pay for that.
732555	734056	So, I don't know.
734316	735376	I find that kind of interesting.
736697	744140	I think it's interesting that the Xbox is trailing so much in Japan, and yet it seems to, after E3, the kind of general feeling I have is it seems to have...
744680	747063	All the inertia here in this country right now.
748084	754770	Well, the Wii did such a huge showing too, but it's definitely a different order here in the US.
754870	764520	Actually, after having spoken with a few of my friends in the UK, I've only talked to one person who has any excitement at all about the PS3.
764620	766902	Everything has been Wii, Wii, Wii, Wii all the way home.
769895	778397	Well, you know, I think part of that might be because Nintendo didn't make a whole lot of promises in the outset, but PlayStation 3, you know, last year at E3, Sony came out and said all these promises.
778417	782919	Hey, we're going to have two HDMI ports, we're going to do all this stuff, and here's some games that didn't even come back the next year.
783319	783559	Yeah.
783619	789161	You know, so I think Sony's press conference felt a lot more like, hmm, hmm, hmm, let down.
789481	794842	Whereas, you know, Nintendo's press conference was kind of like, hmm, hmm, hmm, you know, kind of a little more.
795042	795943	It was all Zelda.
796763	797143	Ooh.
798100	798461	That's right.
798681	800604	I mean, the audience just said Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
800624	802187	I mean, that's kind of stole the show there.
802347	805332	Actually, speaking of which, who saw VG Cats lately?
806434	807155	What did they do in that?
807516	811182	Okay, it had a snake sneaking up in the box behind Mario and going...
813450	814951	It was like blood, decapitation?
814971	816433	Oh yeah, it was blood and decapitation.
816453	817314	Then Kirby's like, uh.
817334	818475	Alright, we've got to keep them moving.
818495	819195	We've got 30 minutes.
819455	822959	Anyway, the PlayStation 3, now this could be very good for them.
823199	826121	If they see something popular, they ought to do something just like it, right?
826161	828463	It's going to have downloadable games just like Xbox Live.
828924	829885	That's what we're thinking right now.
830245	832846	There's actually a job posting that showed up on Craigslist.
833306	844790	That game company, that's the name of them, that game company, they're looking for a superstar engineer with a strong graphics background to develop an unannounced downloadable title for the PlayStation 3 launch in November.
845030	847971	So there it is right there on Craigslist that they're doing some type of
848371	851414	Downloadable title that's going to be available on the launch.
852015	868550	Now I guess some IGN who picked up this story actually contacted somebody that worked for the game company and found out that they are going to be having a service that has downloadable casual games just like Xbox Live Arcade and it's going to be available on the launch day of the PlayStation 3.
870651	881813	Also, the game is going to be just like their current free web game called Flow, that I guess has a lot of addictive qualities about it, although I've never played it, so I couldn't tell you.
883393	887754	So, not a really big surprise there that Sony's going to be doing something similar to the Xbox Live Arcade.
888134	897456	Nintendo's kind of doing it too, just in a different way with a virtual console, but they've also said before that they're going to allow folks to come up with their own stuff, not just classic 8-bit titles.
898581	903863	Although I would like to see some of those horrible Mario ROM hacks show up on the virtual console.
903883	904584	I think that would be fun.
905724	907545	Loki, what else about PlayStation 3?
908105	912607	Well, the first PS3s off the production line are actually going to be the ones for the UK.
913367	922591	That could be good or bad, actually, because, well, anyways, this was confirmed by the Sony Computer Entertainment president of Europe, and also he happens to be the CEO, David Reeves.
922971	927073	He confirmed that the first PS3s off the production line will be the PAL units, and
927677	931780	What's kind of interesting about that is usually the first units off the line are the ones that are the buggiest.
932280	933941	Sorry, guys.
934942	936142	Yeah, that's funny.
937863	941866	All right, shifting gears a little bit, moving away from the PlayStation 3 for a minute.
941886	942346	Thank God.
942766	949931	As I mentioned before, we kind of started here as a music-based station and then kind of grew into other video games.
950491	954574	There's been some news lately on Guitar Hero, possibly making a move to the arcade.
954914	964240	There was kind of a post that was floating around some of the big Bomani forums talking about that in the Trocadero, of all places, there is a prototype machine for playing Guitar Hero.
964540	970965	It's actually being manned by live people, and what they do is they just take your money and then you get to play it.
971445	978830	Now, I don't know if they were trying to make money off of PlayStation 2, but supposedly the people who were running the thing were saying...
979150	982934	that someone wants to see if the game has viability as an arcade machine.
983635	987559	So that could be interesting considering we have a lot of arcades here that already have guitar freaks.
987579	990101	Couldn't they just say, oh, the guitar freak's successful?
990622	993445	Well, since we copied them, why not just copy them in the arcade?
994025	994846	Oh, wait a minute, though.
994886	997709	In Japan there was also an Unjama Lami arcade game.
997749	999251	There was also Namco had a guitar game.
999911	1007813	I still disagree with you, because I think in certain arcades, I think there's a lot of room where Guitar Hero can deliver that Guitar Freaks can't, especially when it comes to the song list.
1007953	1020375	I think people kind of walk by a Guitar Freaks machine, and most people, meaning family with kids, don't recognize the stuff that's playing on a Guitar Freaks machine, but they walk by a Guitar Hero machine, they're going to go, hey, more than a feeling.
1024396	1025476	I think it's going to be successful.
1026010	1026990	If they want to do it, I don't know.
1027250	1037093	Well, anyways, the other thing that they were saying is that it's going to have about 40 to 50 songs in the final arcade release, and that the controller would obviously be more sturdier, a bit larger, and a bit more like Guitar Freaks.
1037153	1037954	Well, I would hope so.
1038854	1043255	And also that they were saying that there's going to be a tilt sensor in there so they'll know if you're left or right handed.
1044556	1045476	That's very cool.
1045496	1046596	See, that's something interesting.
1047177	1047897	They love us.
1048137	1049857	They do.
1049957	1054039	Dark Sakura, kind of moving on to Microsoft and Nintendo.
1054059	1055079	We talked a lot about Sony.
1055868	1070553	You know, Bill Gates was actually talking about the various motion-sensitive controllers like the Wii controller and the flippy gyroscope crap DualShock-looking thing on the PlayStation 3.
1071453	1079316	And he's actually saying that the average gamer, and I don't know if this is something that we should all be insulted by or not, because basically he's insinuating that the average gamer is just really lazy.
1079976	1082237	He said, who wants to move around a lot?
1082317	1084038	Who can sit absolutely still?
1084710	1092557	You know, who's going to have that kind of motor control to hold a controller out and be able to follow without just wanting to set it down.
1093317	1098922	So, in fact, the quote in here is like, it's tough because sometimes you want to move the controller and you don't want to fly into the ground.
1099242	1100503	You just want to put the controller down.
1100584	1102565	People aren't that good at totally standing still.
1102625	1105588	Even pilots actually sit in a chair when they do their flying.
1105708	1107289	There's a lot to be learned about these controllers.
1107369	1110492	Well, pilots don't, you know, freaking play games while they're flying, I hope.
1111192	1116455	Well, basically he's going back to the future of video games, is online gaming, is mobile content.
1117295	1118516	All the stuff his company's doing.
1118996	1121638	Listen, we want you to sit down and play the game.
1121718	1124459	Don't get up because that takes away from your game time.
1124899	1127741	We've now put in Halo, we have, you know, slash pizza.
1130689	1132350	Another interesting quote on here.
1132370	1134671	This actually makes me think back on the origami.
1137072	1144537	Over time you have to say you will carry in your pocket a media device and a phone and a gaming device and say a tablet device for reading.
1144917	1146858	It's natural for them to be combined into one device.
1147258	1148239	Dude, that thing is too big.
1148259	1149520	It'll never fit in a pocket.
1150861	1155063	It'll fit in maybe like one of those Bible carriers.
1155523	1156404	That's his point of view.
1157304	1158185	Some of us disagree.
1158846	1160607	Loki, what else has Microsoft got in store?
1160947	1167791	Well, they've got an Xbox Live update, and I'm going to do a brand new dashboard, including downloading in the background.
1167931	1173334	So you can actually do other things while you're downloading demos or whatever other junk they have on there.
1174395	1181098	Also, they're going to be adding, you can actually stream music and DVDs and stuff while you're downloading from the marketplace.
1182239	1187306	Another thing they were saying, too, is that they're going to actually have it where it will remember your play.
1187366	1194936	Say, for example, you're playing a DVD and you pop it out and go back to a game and then go back to your DVD later, it will actually know where it is.
1195177	1196578	So, yeah, that's great.
1196979	1198381	Sort of like my Mac does already.
1200962	1202963	Yeah, that's nice.
1203124	1203884	My laptop does that.
1203904	1204685	My laptop's PC.
1205045	1205565	All right, whatever.
1206386	1207827	Hey, I love the Mac.
1208807	1217293	I think these are things, you know, it would have been nice to see these a long time ago, but at the same time, you know, at least Microsoft recognizes that people want this stuff, so they're putting it in.
1217313	1218914	They're offering the downloadable upgrade.
1219394	1229321	You know, I think it's going to be pretty cool to just be able to download a lot of stuff and fill up my hard drive, although my hard drive's pretty much already full because Final Fantasy XI takes up, you know, like 25 million.
1231423	1232326	So much room on there.
1234471	1236496	Also, wasn't there something about fan content?
1236516	1237479	Are they going to be putting like
1238277	1243101	I don't know, like things that Microsoft likes that you're going to be able to download as well, like Red vs. Blue episodes and stuff?
1243121	1243681	They already do that.
1244021	1244202	Huh?
1244302	1245102	They already do that.
1245603	1246343	I didn't, oh, okay.
1246363	1248865	You can actually go to redvsblue.com and download it too.
1248885	1250586	Weren't they putting it in their own section?
1250766	1252308	Yes, but you can't watch it on your HDTV.
1252368	1254549	Well, they're going to better organize the content that's already on.
1254689	1255570	Good, because it's live.
1255590	1257151	That's why you use up your laptop to your TV.
1257191	1259173	They're also going to let your friends know when you're idle.
1259693	1261855	And so, you know, when you're not playing a game or anything.
1262275	1264797	Okay, so people aren't sending you messages, hello, hello, are you ignoring me?
1264817	1265958	They can speculate why you're idle.
1267273	1271375	All right, moving on to the Wii.
1271595	1277658	This was going around the internet this week that WiiKaraoke.com was registered on the internet by Nintendo.
1278799	1283361	And that kind of has all this rampant speculation going that, oh my gosh, the Wii's going to have a karaoke game.
1283421	1286123	It's going to be their answer to SingStar, Karaoke Revolution, all that stuff.
1286443	1291750	but also kind of interesting because that means that that controller not only has a speaker but has a microphone in it.
1291810	1292972	So that would be very interesting.
1293372	1294394	But they didn't stop there.
1294454	1296597	They registered a ton of other domain names.
1296637	1297618	I mean, the list is huge.
1297638	1299501	It's this big old list of domain names they registered.
1299881	1302825	WeCooking.com, WeSports.com.
1302885	1303486	WeFitness.
1303766	1323862	WeFamily, I'm sure, WeVC, but that makes sense, Virtual Console, not just WeConnect24.com, WeActive24, WeAnimation, maybe that's new Mario Paint, I don't know, WeAlive24.com, yep, there's WeFitness, WePuzzle, and here we go, WeBeauty.com, but here's my favorite, ShallWe.com.
1326506	1327267	I'm not making that up.
1327327	1327727	It's not a joke.
1327747	1328207	It's really there.
1328647	1331709	So those will all actually just forge you right on over to Nintendo's site.
1331869	1347077	Well, one of the ones that they have on there, there was speculation on this website, MegaGames, that they were saying that WiiChannel.com might actually be kind of like a content channel that you can pick up through the Wii, almost like their own TV station.
1347097	1349558	As long as Comcast doesn't try to ruin it, I'll be fine with that.
1350118	1350659	Wait, what is this?
1350819	1352320	WeBreeding.com?
1352340	1352920	What is this?
1353320	1354581	WeBreeding.
1354681	1355422	WeBreeding?
1356022	1356463	Exactly.
1357023	1357343	Okay.
1357803	1360205	I guess there might be some interesting features coming to the next Animal Crossing.
1360225	1363447	Well, you know, the Nintendo Wii controller is a very phallic device.
1363627	1364288	That's disgusting.
1364408	1364888	Okay.
1365549	1367230	Loki, back to Microsoft, please, quickly.
1367690	1369351	Anyways.
1370392	1371613	Gotta love when I lose my place.
1371653	1372654	That's so much fun.
1373074	1374014	Does the Wii controller vibrate?
1374635	1374975	Yes.
1375035	1375796	Yes, it does, actually.
1375956	1379198	The Wii controller does vibrate, and I don't know why that would be important.
1379386	1380747	Your wife just let out a cheer there.
1382729	1384611	Finally, I'll get a use out of the gaming systems.
1384831	1386833	So, res for Wii, huh?
1388194	1393439	One thing that you will not find with the 360 is that a price drop is not coming soon.
1393739	1398644	Basically, they've seen that the PS3 is going to be damn expensive, and you know what?
1398724	1399825	They don't have to change things.
1399885	1402547	You're going to be paying the same prices on stuff.
1403548	1405029	I don't believe that, but we'll see.
1405790	1407772	I think there'll be a price cut come the next holidays.
1408452	1412595	But I think Xbox was waiting to see what Sony was going to do when they announced the PlayStation 3.
1413176	1419881	And if PlayStation 3 had come out and said, hey, we're going to release our console for $399, then Xbox would have been backed in the corner and they would have had to cut it.
1420061	1423304	Because Sony came out and said, hey, you're going to have to sell your firstborn to get our system.
1423504	1425766	The original Xbox, though, will probably get price cut.
1426666	1427147	So that's good.
1427267	1431310	Well, the original Xboxes are on their way to a flea market near you.
1431530	1431750	I mean...
1435351	1437152	Yeah, they're about to be extinct pretty soon.
1437332	1438073	They're going to be running.
1439193	1440874	There's like no first party titles coming out.
1441835	1442075	Is there?
1442175	1442475	I don't know.
1443075	1443355	All right.
1443876	1449579	Anyway, so when things don't get cut in price and we have to pay more money, we get a little bit angsty.
1449619	1452600	So that takes us to one of our favorite segments called the FUs of the week.
1455182	1455522	All right.
1456601	1458162	That's two people that listen to this show in a room.
1458182	1459283	Insert one wing in here.
1461104	1461925	Now that got a response.
1461945	1462525	Everybody knows that one.
1462545	1464447	All right, DarkSakura, what's your FU of the week?
1464747	1470251	My FU of the week goes to cosplay, as in the preparation that goes into cosplay.
1472092	1472893	Okay, shut up.
1473553	1475455	Damn, I thought you were going to make some people mad for a minute.
1475535	1476695	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1477436	1481239	Okay, I'm going to go into the whole scope of things that piss me off about cosplay.
1481339	1482099	Number one.
1482119	1485041	Can't use props.
1485122	1485242	What?
1485262	1485702	Can't use props.
1487526	1488489	I have a good prop.
1489994	1493626	As I was saying, first of all, it goes into the whole
1494204	1500347	You know, when you have finals week and there's an anime convention the week after finals, when are you going to have time to finish your costume?
1500487	1502008	You're going to spend a whole week working on it.
1502048	1502808	Sleep is for the week.
1503008	1503268	Shut up.
1505209	1514634	And then imagine having to sew and you find good linen on sale, nice black linen, and three sewing machines break while doing it.
1515514	1520237	So you have to get someone to sew it about six hours before you're supposed to be at said convention.
1521130	1536612	and then having to deal with paint and having to deal with your cat walking all over your fan while you're painting it and your husband playing pinball while he's supposed to be holding down the other end for you and then let's get into the people who man fade that's all I have to say
1537725	1544509	There are some people who do not have the physical characteristics to carry off certain costumes.
1544989	1545750	You're picking a fight.
1546230	1546530	All right.
1546550	1547731	No, no, no, no.
1548051	1550172	I think that there's such a thing as tasteful.
1550252	1553854	If you are built like a freaking booth babe, by all means, show it off.
1554695	1559777	But if you're of an average build, in short, like me, you wear a kimono.
1560498	1560838	Thank you.
1561698	1562459	Loki, you're FUSB.
1563594	1571257	My FE of the week, very themed for Fanime, is to ugly chicks who dress up like hot anime chicks.
1571857	1579020	Listen, if you're a 7, do not try to dress up like a 10, because nobody wants to see that.
1579480	1580181	Nobody.
1580921	1582261	Not anybody.
1582562	1586123	So if you're not looking that hot, keep the clothes on.
1587489	1587749	Thank you.
1588009	1589370	Yeah, the same thing goes to guys, too.
1589390	1590050	Same goes to guys.
1590270	1596053	There's some really ugly guys out there dressing up like, you know, I don't know, studly anime characters.
1596893	1597554	Unacceptable.
1598774	1600535	I have no problem with cross-play.
1600615	1606038	Like, if you are a really, really pretty guy, you can pull... Like the Utena from AX three years ago.
1606538	1607098	I know AX.
1607899	1610460	Gentlemen, please don't wear anything that might give you a uniball.
1613842	1614582	Because, damn.
1614902	1616403	And also, please...
1617625	1625368	You know, everybody loves the mainstream characters out there, but my God, how many Vashes, how many Clouds, how many Sephiroths do you really need in the world?
1625428	1630430	How many people, who has counted at least five Naruto in one room today?
1631290	1632631	Everybody raises their hands.
1633911	1635272	You know, I'm going to go ahead and explain.
1635312	1638633	The whole reason I cosplayed Tamari is, again, I had a week.
1640014	1641234	This is her lazy cosplay.
1641254	1642615	This is cosplay in a week.
1642795	1643415	Ta-da!
1644005	1645287	This makes for great radio, by the way.
1646148	1648331	Anyway, moving on because we're getting pressed for time.
1648371	1651976	That and all of my other costumes are too big for me because I made them when I was 80 pounds heavier.
1652815	1663041	My FU of the week goes to my roommate, Extifer, because he left out the Silent Hill 2 on the Xbox, and it's all scratched up now, and if my Pyramid Head scene starts skipping, somebody's going to get an ass kicking.
1663081	1664162	You can borrow mine, Rob.
1664182	1665463	Because Pyramid Head is a rock star.
1665743	1668844	You can borrow mine, because I've had your Silent Hill 4 for like three years.
1669005	1669605	Alright, that works.
1669625	1670225	Before it was out.
1670606	1674768	Alright, moving on, we've got to get to some more news, because this, oh, this is so great.
1675008	1675348	It is.
1675728	1679851	Who doesn't have memories of seeing the movie The Wizard on the big screen?
1680251	1680731	Well, guess what?
1680751	1682272	You can relive those memories all over again.
1682292	1685132	The Wizard is coming to DVD August 29th.
1685972	1693314	And, of course, Fred Savage, It's So Bad, the Mario 3 previews and all that stuff.
1693374	1694735	Wasn't Christian Slater in that?
1694755	1698575	Yes, Christian Slater's holed up in a hotel room and he gets addicted to Nintendo.
1698595	1700756	He's supposed to be looking for Fred Savage and they never leave the hotel room.
1701811	1702232	DarkSakura
1731962	1733983	On the second, we have a whole bunch of stuff coming out.
1734043	1738186	We have Final Fantasy IV on Game Boy Advance, Nintendo of Europe.
1738626	1740467	We have Half-Life 2 on PC.
1740907	1744550	We have Pac-Man World 3 on PSP, Super Monkey Ball Adventure.
1745650	1746791	Did it take this long?
1746931	1747151	Okay.
1747551	1750493	Tourist Trophy, The Real Writing Simulator.
1751014	1751354	Yay.
1752134	1754476	And we also have Zoo Tycoon 2, African Adventure.
1758729	1759050	All right.
1759731	1760492	Loki, do you have U.S.
1760552	1760992	dates?
1761113	1762014	Yeah, pretty much.
1762454	1763937	This week, not a whole lot.
1764898	1770125	But definitely in the month of June, you've got Grand Theft Auto Liberty Histories on the PS2, finally.
1770766	1771968	And I don't know.
1771988	1773250	There's some mixed-in stuff there.
1774928	1778409	Not a whole lot of good games coming out in June.
1778689	1779869	July is your month, though.
1779949	1782230	July you've got Chromehounds, which is awesome.
1783050	1785210	Naruto Ultimate Ninja, if you're an anime fan.
1786291	1791232	And also, man, I really wish Dead Rising was coming out in that month, but that's August.
1792112	1796553	I love how DarkSakura always has her list very planned out, and then Loki's like, man, you know, there's...
1797133	1799235	A bunch of crap coming out this month, maybe a couple cool games.
1799255	1800717	There is, honestly.
1801898	1804180	Seriously, is anyone going to buy Cars the Game?
1805801	1807243	You, sir, are a loser!
1809525	1814490	But anyways, Cars the Game and One Street Ball is coming out this week.
1815070	1817873	But, if you have the PSP, Gradius Collection.
1818214	1819995	Hooray, games for the PSP!
1820215	1820976	That is newsworthy.
1822827	1824628	All right, we've got to jam through these last few stories here.
1824668	1827548	Loki, a new game by Sony of an old franchise.
1827588	1830449	Yes, coming to the UK, SingStar Anthems.
1830549	1834090	More crappy songs on another karaoke game.
1834150	1835071	Yay.
1835091	1836111	I like SingStar.
1836131	1837812	That's actually one of the few games I've ever seen.
1837852	1838692	Now, wait a minute.
1838852	1842593	Isn't this supposed to be like the gay and women-themed SingStar game?
1843735	1844235	Wow.
1844335	1848117	Because if you look at the list, it has like We Are Family and Scissor Sisters.
1848137	1852959	Okay, we've got Queen, Radio Gaga, Cher, if I could turn back time.
1853019	1853880	Yeah, it's a gay one.
1853900	1855581	Cher, I mean, come on.
1855641	1858822	The Steps, because The Steps are in every single music game in the UK.
1858962	1860003	Deeper Shade of Blue.
1861103	1862504	You spin me right around.
1863945	1864505	By Dead or Alive.
1865045	1866746	Gloria Gaynor, I Will Survive.
1867506	1869448	The Pussycat Dolls for some reason, don't ya?
1870709	1872270	Leanne Rimes can't fight the moonlight.
1872290	1873131	Charlotte Church.
1873591	1877335	By the way, the minute this game comes out, we will have Loki live on the show singing Don't Ya.
1877375	1877915	It'll be great.
1878356	1878536	Never.
1879588	1880428	It's vice applauding.
1880868	1881128	All right.
1883409	1884049	All right, anyway.
1885169	1885669	Moving on.
1885829	1887769	Also, somewhat gay theme.
1887809	1888710	This is interesting.
1889190	1900092	Out Magazine, they actually had this, I don't know, best of list that was lately in their magazine, and they just named Link the hottest video game character in Out Magazine.
1900492	1908573	When darkness enshrouds the land, this is a quote from the magazine, when darkness enshrouds the land, Nintendo's sexy farm boy turned wolf sets out to save the day in this upcoming game.
1909033	1914814	his weapons, a sword, a bow, arrows, and kick-ass grooming skills.
1917175	1917755	I don't know.
1917775	1920435	That's the gayest thing I've ever heard.
1921556	1927237	I am a gay gamer myself, and I don't get the big ear thing.
1928137	1931918	They must love big ears over at Out Magazine or something, because I don't find that very sexy.
1932018	1934478	You know what they say about a guy's ears?
1935358	1936479	He can hear really well.
1937799	1938219	Exactly.
1939867	1940547	Next, please.
1940628	1941508	Loki, next, please.
1942869	1944050	I think we talked about this before.
1944750	1946852	The Wii microphone, yeah, might have it.
1947012	1947312	Great.
1947692	1952035	You know, if it's not actually in the controller, they do have that stupid port in the bottom that they could add one on.
1952475	1954977	So, yeah, microphone coming out for the Wii, great.
1955933	1956193	That's it.
1956433	1957895	I thought there was another part to it.
1957915	1958936	What about voice over IP?
1959436	1963880	Oh yeah, voice over IP because they've already got that on the DS so why not on the Wii?
1963900	1968083	Because talking into a giant remote looking thing would be cool.
1968704	1973067	You know if they're trying to market this to mom and dad, that might be a feature that sells them on it.
1974248	1977191	Wow, I wish I could talk into a retarded looking microphone thing.
1977531	1978252	That'd be great.
1978812	1980333	That's the only thing missing from my life.
1980594	1983176	We like retarded microphone looking things, don't we?
1983732	1983992	DarkSakura
2006552	2019943	Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, thinks that Mercenaries 2 is an example of psychological warfare preparing everybody for a real invasion of Venezuela by the United States, apparently.
2021064	2022325	Yeah, we want their oil.
2023987	2025628	It's true, we do want their oil, but...
2026261	2034642	But basically they're taking steps to have certain video games now with that type of theme in mind banned in Venezuela.
2035463	2044264	One of their lawmakers, Gabriela Ramirez, added, sends a message to Americans, you have a danger next door here in Latin America and action must be taken.
2044324	2046404	It's a justification for imperialist aggression.
2046424	2047745	That sounds like they're going to invade us.
2048465	2050205	No, we don't have anything they want.
2050265	2051705	We just have beer.
2051785	2052185	People.
2052485	2054026	We have bad beer and hot dogs.
2054046	2055346	Blood spilling in the streets.
2057839	2058700	and they don't have that there.
2059320	2060721	They can get it in their own backyard.
2061762	2070247	But no, basically there's a law proposing that they're trying to prevent violent video games in Venezuela now.
2070327	2071168	It's all over the world.
2071588	2072809	The infection has spread.
2073530	2075091	Jacob, why does Loki hate Apple?
2103382	2104703	Loki, why do you hate Apple?
2105143	2106363	I mean, where do I begin?
2106644	2111046	Okay, listen, that computer, it may look pretty, but it does nothing.
2111506	2114147	It gets you on the internet, and that's about it.
2116968	2119129	The Mac OS is such a nice operating system.
2119810	2123331	It's nice if you want to browse the internet.
2123852	2124572	Video editing.
2124812	2125192	You know what?
2125212	2126893	A PC can do video editing just as well.
2127737	2128097	Not really.
2128157	2131478	Explain why things done in Photoshop on a Mac look better than they do on a PC.
2131518	2132839	Mac is good for print.
2133099	2133579	That is it.
2133739	2134820	Print media only.
2135900	2137701	No, online web media does not matter.
2138701	2139922	What about the lack of viruses?
2140382	2141462	What about the lack of games?
2142342	2142643	Oh!
2142983	2144083	Who games on a Mac?
2144483	2146324	Nobody, because a Mac can't game.
2147364	2148105	World of Warcraft?
2149045	2149585	Oh, wow.
2149605	2156428	This is just where you guys, the Mac lovers, look, I love Mac too, as you can see, but you're just not going to change his mind.
2156468	2157068	I'm sorry, guys.
2157526	2157846	All right.
2158146	2158667	Anybody else?
2159507	2159887	Anybody?
2160007	2160848	Ask us questions.
2160948	2161868	Ask Orange Lounge.
2161948	2162749	Video game questions.
2162809	2163149	E3 stuff.
2163169	2163989	We're sadistic.
2164149	2165430	I think I see a dude getting up and back.
2165450	2166771	I mean, we're masochistic.
2166791	2166951	Sorry.
2166971	2167511	Come on down.
2167551	2168512	You're the next contestant.
2168652	2169372	Welcome.
2170232	2170332	Woo!
2170352	2171013	How are you doing?
2171053	2171793	It's a big room.
2171813	2172273	You win air.
2173994	2174935	Your name, sir?
2175595	2175975	Michael.
2176396	2177796	And I see you're wearing a Squeenix shirt.
2177836	2178336	That's awesome.
2178356	2179297	What's your question for us, Michael?
2180090	2198534	How many times do you think by the end of the year that the Blu-ray technology will crash because of various problems reading different... Because the difference between reading a DVD semi-sequentially and maybe having to grab different things from all different parts of a game disc, I think is going to be a big problem for the PS3.
2199034	2200494	And I was wondering what you guys thought about that.
2200794	2202475	Let me ask you a question as an answer.
2202875	2204495	How many times does a person blink in a day?
2205598	2206798	That's how often it will crash.
2206818	2207138	A lot of them.
2207558	2209159	That's why I'm not getting a PS3.
2209179	2213119	I've been looking forward to it until I saw the price point and then saw what it was.
2213199	2213880	It's like, no.
2213900	2215700	Sony's press conference was depressing.
2216320	2221941	I think Sony kind of just made a grave mistake in not putting the Blu-ray movies out there on the show floor.
2222281	2228362	I think what they should have done is they should have on the show floor had, here's a Blu-ray movie playing next to a regular DVD.
2228662	2230143	This is why you need to upgrade the Blu-ray.
2230163	2230343	No, no, no.
2230363	2231363	We've tried that before.
2231383	2231863	Yes, they did.
2232045	2236887	Well, how many people in this room actually have an HDTV capable of that high resolution?
2237868	2239749	That's about a half of the room.
2239769	2240609	A third half.
2241049	2245391	Okay, but of course we're all... Yeah, you all are nerds, so of course you have an HDTV.
2245431	2246312	We all love our games.
2246592	2248633	We're in here because we're gamers and anime fans, right?
2248653	2249833	So we want to make them look pretty.
2250154	2252235	But... That's okay.
2254356	2255076	That's awesome.
2256280	2265124	But seriously, how many people though across the world in the areas that would, you know, they're going to market the PS3 and do you think are actually going to be able to take advantage of that level of technology?
2266485	2267645	Japan, yeah, exactly.
2267665	2270046	Could they be setting themselves up for the long run?
2270106	2273788	Maybe it's not so much about launch day, but it's about what's going on a couple years in advance?
2275074	2279856	That might be a mistake given the Xbox 360 has been out a year already.
2280436	2291301	I mean, I've already got a person who hates Microsoft gaming, but has already said that Microsoft may be making leaps and bounds towards somewhat evening the console wars between the two sides.
2291772	2292992	That's what it sounded like to me.
2293573	2300455	And even if Blu-ray doesn't take off, it's not like that's ever held Sony back with the fact that they've had a failed media format.
2300875	2304736	MiniDisc, the UMDs, Beta.
2304796	2306236	Hey, Beta was good.
2306636	2311638	I think Microsoft's learning from their lack of diversity on the first Xbox, at least if E3 is any showing.
2311678	2315219	I think they're really finally starting to learn what the rest of us really want.
2315799	2316379	So we'll see.
2316539	2319120	Because I'll tell you, games like 99 Nights and stuff were pretty hot.
2319460	2321241	Anyway, we got another question here.
2321261	2321842	What's your name, sir?
2322582	2322842	Willie.
2323383	2325124	Willie, and Willie's got a DDR Freak shirt on.
2325144	2325964	We got a lot of buddies over there.
2325984	2327105	That looks like one of the old school DDR Freak shirts.
2327145	2327986	Willie, what's on your mind?
2328286	2332169	Well, I did want to hear Loki rant, but he got that taken care of.
2332189	2335070	But I was wondering what you guys thought of the arcade here.
2335911	2336852	I haven't checked it out yet.
2336932	2339934	I actually got here about an hour before we had to get up here.
2340554	2342015	Is there anything left at Miggle?
2342035	2344817	Because it just looks like they moved Miggle over here, Milpitas Golf Land.
2346266	2348248	OnCampus Entertainment brought all this stuff over here.
2348388	2349910	So what games are in there right now?
2351131	2356657	DDR Extreme, Parapara, Initial D, and Wangan, and all that air hockey.
2356717	2359701	Okay, I'm going to get my cards out and freaking play some Long God Midnight.
2361482	2362764	I will challenge anybody in this room.
2363364	2363685	You know what?
2363745	2365426	They've got the right games for this crowd.
2365806	2366126	They do.
2366286	2367627	So, you know, they left.
2368368	2371670	They really have enough room left for some actual go-kart racing.
2371690	2373251	That's why I thought that the only thing was missing.
2373271	2374752	That room over there is kind of empty.
2375433	2378295	You could be doing Mario Kart Live around the arcade.
2378335	2379656	I mean, there's a lot of room over there.
2379696	2380076	That's all right.
2380096	2383398	We should get the people to cosplay the initial D cars again and run around the room.
2383599	2385240	This is the last question, guys, because we've got to wrap it up.
2385260	2386381	We don't want to be rude to the next folks.
2386461	2387181	Your name, sir?
2388062	2388442	Ricardo.
2388902	2389443	Hi, Ricardo.
2389463	2389863	What's your question?
2391257	2399162	Aside from the idea of the new Guitar Hero Arcade, what new music game do you guys think ought to come out that will get the crowd up and amped again?
2401524	2403405	I want Sax Mania.
2404566	2405426	Clarinet Freaks.
2405446	2408488	Yeah, we need more Parappa.
2408528	2409769	We need another Um Jammerlammy.
2411057	2413719	that utilizes the Guitar Hero controller.
2413739	2415461	Are you talking arcade or are you talking console?
2415721	2416121	He says arcade.
2416141	2416602	Oh, arcade.
2417162	2421385	That's a tough one because I would like to see something new.
2421726	2424328	Sega needs to hop up and make me a Universe Harrier.
2426169	2429311	They need to freaking bring Planet Harrier out on some system or the other.
2429832	2431193	We need Planet Harrier on the Wii.
2431893	2432414	That's what we need.
2433295	2436597	I would like to see something like frequency amplitude type stuff in the arcade.
2436637	2438399	I think that would be pretty hot because I like those games.
2438419	2438899	They're awesome.
2439542	2469169	and you know with Harmonix having that formula work so successfully now that they've just attached a guitar to it they ought to go back and revisit the idea of doing one of their you know trancy techno type games so that's my answer I want to see like a frequency amplitude type thing in the arcade you want Technic beat on arcade no Technic beat was kind of lame alright that's it one more story one more quick story here and then we're going to wrap it up Loki yes a perfect story to end on basically you know you know a company's got a really dumb idea when they come out with this
2469605	2472686	Co-masters, they're coming out with a game called The Turds.
2473186	2475967	That's right, you play crap.
2476968	2477508	Excellent.
2478348	2481009	What exactly are The Turds, you might ask?
2481349	2483090	Well, this is from the official website.
2483130	2486051	Is this the sequel to Boonga Boonga or whatever that thing was called?
2486311	2486771	I don't know.
2486931	2490073	Anyways, here's from their official website, hopefully going to answer the question.
2490913	2498836	On a winter's night in 2001, during a heavy drinking session at home amongst friends, I decided to stumble off to the toilet for what I was going to...
2499261	2503722	for what was going to be a good pan-splitting chunder.
2505783	2512704	For some reason, and don't ask why, I brought a small lump of brown plasticine with me from our studio.
2513085	2522547	Whilst performing my toilet bowl opera and singing my guts up for the toilet gods, Hugh and Frank, I managed to crush the plasticine into a pulp.
2523287	2531696	Once I delivered the goods and that wonderful feeling of calm sank in, I found myself looking at the plasticine.
2531776	2535620	I decided to take that pulp and create a turd with a face.
2536521	2539283	As I played with my new friend on the side...
2541006	2543368	This is why you don't drink that much.
2543388	2545929	Put that person in a jacket and put them in the back of the van.
2546369	2550572	Okay, I wonder who spiked this person's beer with, like, antifreeze.
2550772	2551352	It was that guy.
2551412	2557336	Okay, as I played with my new friend on the side of the toilet seat, I knew this was the start of something special.
2557356	2563800	Okay, I just want to say, Mac fans, what I'm going to do for you guys is we'll crop what he's saying right here, so we'll have little sound bites that you can download.
2564740	2566041	History was made that night.
2566101	2567462	The turd world was born.
2568189	2573533	It's just like... I don't know what the hell... So anyways, I saw the pictures of the website.
2573593	2575555	It's like these giant turds with guns.
2575735	2576876	So, you know what?
2578858	2579918	More power to you.
2580219	2582861	I mean, if you really want to play a game that's crap, there you go.
2582941	2583882	Somebody just yelled it out.
2583922	2584702	It's like worms.
2585263	2586424	Worms with turds.
2586904	2588005	It's the sequel, Ringworms.
2590687	2591648	And on that note...
2592879	2595643	What a good note to end this show on, a poop.
2596203	2598506	Anyway, very fitting, don't you think?
2599067	2600409	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
2600749	2601310	DarkSakura.
2601670	2602651	Reject false icons.
2602892	2604053	Don't get a PS3.
2605174	2606136	Ooh, harsh words.
2606196	2606496	Loki.
2607017	2610241	You're going to laugh, but the first part of the show didn't tape.
2614594	2617055	So I guess this won't be going up on the podcast stream or something.
2617075	2618155	No, the first part of the show.
2618175	2620036	We missed like about ten minutes or so.
2620276	2621156	We'll see what we can do with it.
2621176	2622416	We'll fake it.
2622436	2623357	We'll fake it like a woman.
2623497	2623897	That's it.
2628478	2628938	Nellie, here.
2628958	2629898	Hit your husband.
2631519	2631859	All right.
2632699	2635260	Thank you guys for coming out and watching the show.
2635888	2636548	We appreciate it.

2647574	2650696	We also have a panel tomorrow night about podcasting if you're interested.
2652077	2653538	How we became internet rock stars.
2654578	2657240	Hey, we are the celebrities of the internet.
2657720	2658300	Right.
2660021	2660701	Alright, that's it.
