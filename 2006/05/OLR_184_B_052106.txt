DarkSakura.com
I know what you mean.
Okay, it's something far superior to anime.
Whatever, whatever.
It is a convention that is happening that we're going to be at and doing our show live Saturday, 7 o'clock, panel room 1.
Make sure you bathe.
DarkSakura will be there with Febreze.
I will be there with Febreze and deodorant.
I will also be cosplaying.
We're also doing a panel Sunday at 7 about podcasting but it's not the show being taped.
We hope you come out to that anyway but that's not actually our show being taped.
That's us talking about how to be podcasting superstars.
We should record it anyways.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Just remember, even if you think we suck, we do this for free, and we don't get paid to do it like some of those guys over at some of the bigger websites, you know?
So, um, just keep that in mind.
Jerk.
Yes, we put as much effort into it as we get paid.
Alright, Loki, getting into the news.
PlayStation 3.
Yes, oh, PlayStation 3.
What is wrong with you?
Seriously.
Where can we start?
No, but anyways, um,
The big gripe with everyone in PlayStation 3 is, what games are going to be at launch?
And well, that's a good question, because we don't really know.
There's a lot of titles missing.
For example, the CEO David Reeves of Sonic Beer Entertainment Europe mentioned that quite a few titles won't be making their launch date on November 17th.
And here's basically the status, kind of running down things, of certain titles that they definitely showed at E3.
First one, SingStar.
Eh, certainly before Christmas.
But it doesn't really say, you know, at launch.
An iToy game will be available after Christmas.
iToy is not playable at the moment, but it will come before March 2007.
Oh, that's good.
Sooner than never.
Heavenly Sword Formula 1 Motorstorm will not come out until after Christmas.
Resistance, Fall of Man will certainly be a launch title.
Well, I'm glad one of those is actually going to be available.
So, you know, which 15 launch titles are supposed to be there?
Who knows?
But, well, I know a couple of them, but, you know.
Oh, do you?
I'm not sharing that.
Well, for example, one of them that actually most websites haven't been mentioning, Fear is going to be on the PlayStation 3 at launch.
How do you know this?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But your systems contradict that.
Yep.
Alright.
We have it for... We actually have it for the PlayStation 3 and the 360, so... Yeah.
Alright.
Sorry, no Wii version of fear out there.
All right.
Moving on, also about the PlayStation 3, a lot of people kind of mad about the lack of a rumble feature.
Now, Sony is saying that they didn't want to do it because it interferes with the whole tilt thing, but I think a lot of us are looking at that and going, mm-hmm, what about the lawsuit?
Well, this is what is interesting.
Immersion, who's the company who's involved in this lawsuit, says, I don't believe it's a very difficult problem to solve, referring to the shocking getting in the way of the tilt sensory.
And Immersion is experts that would be happy to solve that problem for them.
But in exchange, Sony is going to have to drop its current appeal against the 2004 lawsuit.
So that is a very interesting exchange.
Like, sure, we'll get you, Rumble, if you pay us a lot of money.
I think so.
I think their system needs all the help it can get.
All right.
I would like to see them do the rumble as well.
Personally, if I had to choose, you know, rumble or tilt, I'd choose a rumble, because the tilt function sucked.
I haven't seen anything that really sells me on the tilt function.
Sure, there was Warhawk, but not enough for me.
So, show me why I need tilt, and maybe I'll say that.
Yeah.
Alright.
I can get tilt already at home.
Oh, with the pinball machine?
With the pinball machine.
Well, that's a little different.
You know what?
I prefer that kind of tilt to Sony's tilt, so...
Maybe they just haven't put it in the right game yet.
We'll see, though.
We'll see.
Loki, developers.
Getting frustrated because they haven't received PS3 dev kits yet.
In fact, some of the major ones, THQ and Sega, just haven't gotten dev kits.
THQ boss Brian Farrell reportedly said that his company had killed the work on Sopranos for the PlayStation 3 because it was too risky at the moment since they don't have a dev kit.
So that's kind of important if you want games to be included with your $600 system that's coming out in the fall.
Which, hopefully it's coming out in the fall because they said, oh yeah, we're launching in the fall.
We're launching November 17th or whatever.
Yeah, I remember when they said they were launching back in spring.
So, yeah, it's not looking good.
Interesting.
Loki, we're going to go ahead and go back to you for another story about the Final Fantasy VII remake that was rumored last E3.
What's going on with this?
Well, according to EGM, they're saying yes, it is.
Actually, in their latest edition of the magazine, which I think was actually on the show floor at E3, it says, Last year, Square Enix teased everyone with what they called the Final Fantasy VII PS3 tech demo.
Well, what do you know?
This test case was really a sneak peek at the next gen revival of the PlayStation 1 role-playing hit.
Is it actually coming out?
Eh, maybe.
So, you know, just because the magazine says so, who knows.
Okay, interesting.
I think a lot, well, it would make sense with all the Final Fantasy VII love that Square's been giving lately.
Yeah, it makes total sense.
Yeah, so.
And, you know, there was a whole I heard a friend of a friend thing a while back that said it was happening, but, you know, take that with a grain of salt.
But here's another interesting one.
This isn't from a friend, but, well, you know, someone, I would call this person a friend, but a listener of our station tipped me off on something, which I think is very interesting.
And this was overheard by people that would know what they're talking about.
from Nintendo.
And basically, Nintendo is trying to secure the rights to remake Final Fantasy VII for a portable console in the near future.
So take it with a grain of salt, but this was overheard by a listener of ours from people that would know what they're talking about, that Final Fantasy VII is coming to a portable console, and this is Nintendo.
So obviously it's the DS or some other crazy thing they might have in the works, but I'm pretty sure it's the DS.
So again, take it with a grain of salt, but when I think about it, it makes a lot of sense that Final Fantasy VII would come out on the DS, right?
Well, there's also the fact that basically since the DS is a glorified Nintendo 64 console,
They had Final Fantasy 6 characters as a demo for what would have been Final Fantasy 7 back on the Nintendo 64 until they went to Sony instead.
So basically, they've even had work on this before, technically.
That's a very interesting point.
It wouldn't be too hard to, I guess, make it happen.
People think, oh, it was CD to cartridge.
I don't know.
Not at all.
I think that it would be in their best interest to remake it.
Especially after seeing Final Fantasy III at E3.
Final Fantasy III is in a very similar graphical style, in fact a little better than Final Fantasy VII.
I could totally see it happening.
And let's not also forget that Squeenix is on a currently Final Fantasy binge right now.
Saturating us with Final Fantasy 7 everything What an interesting retort from Nintendo though if that happened because Sony has been really selling you know the PSP you can download the PlayStation 1 game and the game that everyone asks about can I play Final Fantasy 7 on it they're not asking about Ridge Racer they're asking about Final Fantasy 7 will I be able to play Final Fantasy 7 on the PSP and of course the answer is yes but what a great response from Nintendo to be able to play Final Fantasy 7 on the DS but again guys
You know, you have to take it with a little bit of grain of salt right now, but just don't be surprised if it actually happens.
Be very, very interesting.
All right.
Moving on.
There is an HDMI cable coming to the Xbox 360, and Liksang is supposedly offering that you can put your name on a list to be one of the first ones to get this cable when it does come out.
So Liksang has taken pre-orders for this HDMI cable, so people are kind of jumping to conclusions there.
That means one is on the way.
And it would make sense.
Microsoft likes to do that.
If their competition does something, they'll do it as well.
They'll release an upgrade or something.
They've built that 360 to be pretty quickly upgradable, so I could totally see this happening.
I don't know why it didn't happen at launch, but whatever.
It's coming.
And especially if there's an HD DVD player in the works, and this whole discussion about 1080p is the true HD, I think that would make a lot of sense for that HD DVD player to come out, as well as an HDMI cable.
I think that would be...
A good way to answer Sony's Blu-ray is the true HD or whatever.
Moving on, Loki.
Yes.
What else on the 360?
Other things on the 360, well, Devil May Cry.
Actually, they're saying that Devil May Cry 4 might not be exclusive to the PS3, but may debut on the 360 and Revolution as well.
You mean the Wii?
Whatever, the Wii.
According to the latest issue of Famitsu, they basically feature an interview with Hiroshi Kobayashi, the producer of the Devil May Cry series.
So, interesting.
But that's not all.
No, no.
Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition may be coming to Xbox 360 as well.
According to Planet Xbox 360, and they don't really give a source on it, but they say that it's coming to the 360 in the PAL territories.
So they mention September as the launch date for that.
That'd be interesting.
But a rumor for now.
Lots of Devil May Cry love on the 360.
Good deal.
I'm going over to the chat room over at www.orangeentree.com.
Click on chat.
There's a lot of feedback there to what we were saying earlier about the Final Fantasy VII remakes.
DJ PooEater says, How many times can I watch Aeris die?
Stop pulling my heart out, you bastard squeenix.
I can't watch it enough.
I have my game saved where she dies so that I can watch her die over and over.
Will you do that on the PSP version and the PS3 remake and the DS version?
Hell yeah!
I hate Aerith!
You should set it up so that you have it all play at once on all the different... I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate her.
The question is, how are they going to fit all that on a cartridge?
Those DS cartridges are pretty big, and I could see it happening.
I think somebody made a joke, I think Bobby said something, Blackwolf in the chatroom said something about they could put Final Fantasy VII on three carts, and the third cartridge is nothing but the ending.
Rene was saying, in response to me saying everybody's asking for Final Fantasy VII, he's saying I'm asking for Intelligent Cube.
Good call, good call.
Alright, moving on with topics.
There's a brand new add-on coming to Oblivion.
This is really being an expanding, ever-expanding game.
The latest one, according to a Bethesda developer, saying basically it's Goonies.
Because what happens in this mission is that you will take control of a cavernous lair that has a pirate ship in it.
And then once you get the pirate ship, you get to go loot things.
So it's just like the Goonies, because remember they had the pirate ship in the cave?
So get this, even if that doesn't interest you, Bethesda is supposedly working on an additional six to seven add-ons, including an epic dungeon, and they want to release this stuff every three to four weeks.
That's the smartest way to keep your game going, honestly.
That's a great tactic.
Oblivion, a very impressive game, one I need to play more of, but I can't tear myself away from that other RPG I keep playing over and over.
I think Oblivion would be better if it had co-op over live.
Yeah, but then it's an MMO, in a way.
In a way.
Not necessarily.
Alright.
Anyway, it's been a little while since we've been able to take a look inside our old mailbag, but DarkSakura hasn't forgotten about you guys who email us every week at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
So we've got a little bit of a backlog tonight, so we want to let DarkSakura get to it and check the mailbag.
So, DarkSakura, put on your hazmat suit and your rubber gloves and dig on into the mailbag.
This week is actually asbestos.
Yeah, I'm gonna die.
What, are we getting flames this week?
No.
No, I was just saying.
Jeremy Todd emailed us, and basically he wanted to state, and we've actually been talking about this back and forth, about saying that the Wii controller and the PlayStation 3 controller...
Well, let me just start over.
Let me just start over reading this.
That's right.
I'm tired.
Okay.
I just want to address to many people that the PS3 isn't like the Wii controller, since many of the people who watch the Sony conference probably got this impression.
The Wii controller can sense 3D space, but the PS3 controller cannot.
Now, we discussed this.
And basically, to go ahead and point this out, for everybody else who has this misconception, they are almost the same.
The tilt is a gyroscope.
The connection to the TV is infrared.
Not 3D space, it's infrared.
It's just sensitivity the closer and further away you get it.
And it connects to the PS2, I'm sorry, to the Wii by Bluetooth.
So, basically...
I remember when Bobby was talking about this though accelerometers is a big part of the Wii thing too though that not every game uses infrared some use just the accelerometers and some use just the infrared so it just kind of depends on the game you're playing but it's really not all that you know fantastic they just took actually very simple technology and used it in a complex way how I see it okay so yeah um
Now this was, our good friend Rob linked me to another editorial at Pointless Waste of Time.
And for anyone who wants to read it, because I'm not going to go into the whole thing, it's at pointlesswasteoftime.com slash games slash crash.html.
It's life after the video game crash, post E3 2006 edition by...
and David Wong.
I'm going to read these two paragraphs on here.
It says, Who am I?
I am the creator of a certain video game console.
I don't want to toot my own horn, but let's just say the profits of this machine were $4 billion higher than the Microsoft Xbox.
My console consisted of a plastic milk crate with a kitten placed inside.
The controller was a wooden rod that could be used to poke the kitten.
I sold zero of these consoles, which cost me zero to manufacture.
Therefore, my profits were zero.
The Xbox, however, lost $4 billion."
I want to buy the Poke the Kitten console.
That sounds like fun.
I need the Poke the Rabbit console instead.
And actually, there is a link on this to an article at Joystick about just how much they've kept losing over the Xbox.
But it's pretty much going into a lot more detail about basically why the video game industry is going to crash, especially with the release of the PS3.
Sony is basically...
Planning to take a $400-$500 loss on every single PS3 they sell.
Maybe in a few years they'll start making money on it.
The first thing that it brings up that I just think is probably the most apt comparison here.
It's like, why does the industry have to crash it all?
The movie industry is still around over a century later.
But it's been proven, especially with the Atari 2600, that you can have a system for a few years, but after a while you'll stop playing it.
They're saying that when they released E.T.
In 1983, E.T.
was supposed to be Atari's biggest game to hit the market.
About 6 million of them stayed on shelves.
Then again, the game was pretty wretched.
But even so, it was just that people weren't playing their 2600s by 1983.
Nothing new was out.
People got tired of it.
It was an old toy.
I think that's a very, very good comparison right there.
And it's why, you know, how many were all up all over it when they got their GameCube, you know?
How many of you are still playing it?
When was the last time you played your GameCube, Rob?
A while ago, I'll be honest.
It was a while ago.
But that's because there hasn't been any games that have come out lately that have made me go, wow.
And I haven't had a good nerd party lately where people... Because, like, that was pretty much where my GameCube was getting the most use.
People come over, we play F-Zero, we play Smash Bros., we play Mario Party.
It's the greatest party console ever.
What's the oldest system that you own right now?
That still works?
Probably my Super Nintendo.
When was the last time you touched it?
Oh, it's in a box.
Because I don't need to.
I can emulate it.
But I emulated a Super Nintendo game last week.
But when did you pull your system out and play it?
Oh, ages ago.
Probably in college.
Okay, if you didn't have an emulator, would you pull out your SNES and play it?
I'm going to be honest, probably.
But not on a regular basis.
It would be one of those things where it's like, dude, remember Super Metroid?
Fuck yeah, let's play.
Because that's what emulators are kind of like.
But you wouldn't play it every day.
No.
You'd play it for a little bit and then you'd just put it away.
Yes.
And Dan and I own all these systems, but honestly, the last time we touched our TurboGrafx was a few months ago.
I haven't touched my own Super Nintendo that I moved out here with in a year.
Except when I moved it, when we moved into our house.
So, yeah, you keep it around, and the novel aspect is there.
Yeah, I'm going to go play my Nintendo, but are you going to have it hooked up as your primary system?
Hell no.
If it was the only thing you owned, would you still have found other things to do after three years had passed?
It would really depend on my scenario.
But on the other hand, if I didn't have the money to afford a new console and I could go to a garage sale or a flea market and buy Super Nintendo games for like two bucks a pop, I'd get a lot more life out of it.
But would you still play it more often if you could go out and do stuff instead?
It's hard to say, because I'm not in that situation.
Well, that's just the point of view I'm trying to point out, you know.
Understandable.
I had, you know, my Super Nintendo, I had for years, and after a couple years, even though, you know, I was still a big gamer, I still loved to play my Super Nintendo, I put more attention toward other things.
You know, that's just how I was with it, even though I loved to death, and I'd go through and have my, you know, massive three-hour games of Kirby's Avalanche, you know.
I think that's a pretty good, you know...
I thought that was a pretty neat point to bring up.
23rd Magus in our chatroom, by the way, would like to point out that your pet Shermie does not approve of the Poke the Kitten console.
I don't approve of the Poke the Kitten console.
I totally approve.
The next point on this, though... Well, see, it keeps bringing out, though, that, you know, that, yeah, you get it with slightly better graphics, but really aren't the games the same?
I thought that was a funny comparison, though, of...
Jet Goblins Attack in 1980, and The Legend of Zelda in 1987.
I'll show you.
You have orange box, yellow box, and of course we all know what Zelda looks like.
But it's really going into, a lot more of this article goes into how, oh, these systems are so great, but now you're getting just more of the same with everything released.
There's no new innovation, which is actually why I think
I don't know if you noticed how much bigger the crowds were at Nintendo than they were for Microsoft and Sony.
Well, a part of that I blame on Nintendo's design, though.
You could walk right into Sony's and play their console on Microsoft.
I mean, there's a whole variety.
And then you have the whole hype behind the Wii.
I don't know if I can relate it to this.
Did you see how much line they had anticipated getting at Sony?
That's true.
And they got maybe a third of that?
Well, here's the other thing, too, that all their consoles are playable at other booths.
That's a good point, too.
You could walk into Sega and play Full Auto 2 in the Sonic game.
So, that's a good point.
I would recommend giving this article a read.
It's a very well-written editorial.
It goes a lot more into detail about, you know, supporting proof.
You know, it gives actual numbers.
It gives actual information.
I thought that was very, very smart.
So I would say definitely go take a look.
Check it out, dudes.
Yeah.
And dudettes.
But I did like the whole, you know, bringing up the comparison there.
We got an email from Jay Vez.
We got another one from Ldriver.
Cool.
Yeah.
Just wanted to give you a shout and let you know how awesome your E3 coverage was.
Yours was my favorite, and it was cool to have you guys, all games, GamerAndy and BobbyBlackWolf, all on the same... I'm sorry, all on each other's shows.
You should try to do that more often.
Agreed.
It was fun.
I had a great it was a brilliant idea from the all games people to put us all under one roof the only unfortunate thing is is that again you had Gamer Andy who's based in the bay us who's based in Sacramento Scott and Lawrence who are based in LA and Bobby who's in Atlanta so it's you know that doesn't happen very often where everybody's in the same city except for something as massive as E3
Maybe Game Developers Conference next year because I could see us going to that and probably at least... I know Bobby flew out this year, so maybe something will happen again.
But who knows?
Oh, the guy from Chatterbox as well is in Arizona.
He was there for one of the shows too.
It's not very often everybody gets under one roof, but we thought it was a good time.
You know what I liked about it, too, was that there was no sense of competition.
Sure, we had the joking chat, oh, how many people you got listening, oh, how many people you got listening.
We kind of had that joke, but it was just kind of like we all realize that our shows are different because of who hosts it, and there's just different things that each show brings to the table, and we can all coexist.
People will gravitate to the host's
or hopefully multiple shows of the hosts that they seem to reflect their personality or the complete opposite.
Some people might listen to us because what we say pisses them off.
I don't know.
I thought it was great though that we could have such different points of view.
It was very nice to have new people to bounce off of.
I think one of the reasons I like the whole all games thing is because
I play Super High Impact.
That was it.
I know, I know.
I'm a Tecmo ball for life.
But L Driver has a question for us.
Sure.
My question is, who was the coolest industry person you met at the show?
Or who were you most excited about meeting or seeing?
I've heard people say nothing about, I'm sorry, say nothing about great things about Major Nelson and Trixie.
And I think it's telling Microsoft that people like working for them.
I don't see that on the Sony side, just a thought.
Rob took my photo with Igarashi Koji, who's the producer of the Castlevania games.
That's the one I met too that I thought was really exciting.
But honestly, I gotta be honest, nothing will beat Akira from two years ago.
Akira Yamaoka.
That was mine.
Hey, you met Koji Kondo.
Alright.
Loki, did you meet any industry people?
No, but I wish I had met I think it was like Steve Odedeck or whatever that was there.
I remember the guy did Kung Pao.
He apparently was walking around in E3.
So I was like,
I'm cool to meet him because I gotta punch him in the face and say, Make goddamn Kung Pao 2!
Because I need to see the movie now!
Get off your ass!
Stop wasting your time with Barnyard and those other crappy animated movies.
I want Kung Pao 2!
I gotta be honest, though, I try not to be fanboy at E3 because it's supposed to be, you know, a professional thing.
So I don't run up to people and go, OMG, I'm your biggest fan.
But, you know, in the case of, you know, the guy, Igarashi, you know, it's just kind of, the way we just kind of talked to him was like, hey, you know, we wanted to actually just tell him about our show in hopes that we could get him on.
But, you know, and, you know, take a picture while we're at it for the website.
Why not?
Fun.
Yeah, we're gonna cut out the part with me in it.
No, stop.
Um...
Also, I got an email.
We've been picked for Podzinger, our podcast of the week.
Yay, Podzinger.
Yeah, so everyone should go to Podzinger.com.
Go check it out.
The other cool thing about Podzinger and part of what sets them apart from other podcast search engines is that they actually will break down what we say.
It somehow converts our MP3 into text.
You can't actually read it, but if you do search, you'll actually see Podzinger try to read the sentence as we spoke it.
It's really weird technology, but it's cool.
So you can actually search for words in podcasts.
So I think that's kind of neat.
So thank you, Podsinger.
Appreciate it.
Our last one comes from Nintendomaniac64, who has a question for us.
So it was, I was wondering if there was a way of taking an AGP or PCI port out of a PC and hooking it up to a laptop via internally or externally so that I could use a decent video card.
No idea, Loki.
I have no idea.
What?
Pay attention!
Fired!
Sorry, I was reading something.
You should take an AGP or PCI port out of a PC and hook it up to a laptop to use a better video card.
You're not going to probably be able to do that.
Because laptops, a lot of times, they have PCI Express.
Well, especially the recent ones, they have PCI Express cards.
And I'm not sure if there are their own versions of them.
Like, my laptop right now has a ATI Mobility Radeon X600.
So it's kind of a
My laptop plays games just fine.
Alienware does make a...
Well, yeah, buy a Mac if you want good graphics.
Yeah, just get a Mac.
Sorry, Loki.
I know how you feel, but honestly.
Did you see the stuff for the new MacBook?
Isn't it hot?
I gotta take it back to gaming.
We gotta keep it going.
MacBook Pro.
Well, if you're taking it back to gaming, then obviously Mac is the wrong way to go there.
Shut up.
Oh, sorry.
I dropped my mic.
Oh, I've done to my computer.
Damn it.
You know, I'll be playing World of Warcraft on my Mac.
and I'll be playing Ragnarok online.
Alright, look, shut up.
If you want to email us, add to the mailbag for next week, yell at Loki for his Matt Cate mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is the address.
Moving on, I gotta mention this because we have a lot of folks who love the music games and by the way, we have a video coming to the website tonight of some of the new DDR games, so some of you kids can see the interface, so check that out.
But Rez, hugely popular game.
Rez, Rez, Rez.
In an interview with Eurogamer, the creator of Rez spoke about the possibilities of a sequel to Rez.
Basically, he says that he is looking at the next generation possibilities and trying to do a Rez kind of experience.
If Sega were to approach him to make a Rez sequel, he is currently seriously considering it.
It's always there.
I'm always thinking about it.
so it's kind of interesting to think about which system would it be on would it be on like the Wii where you could move it around or would it be on like the 360 where you could do like updates or would it be on the PlayStation 3 which is supposed to have the true high definition who knows who knows but I believe Rez was originally a Dreamcast game and just brought over to the PlayStation 2 right that's right yeah that's exciting though I really hope that happens and while we're at it how about more Space Channel 5 please thank you
Loki!
Got some news on Pac-Man.
Pac-Man World Rally.
And I did play this game, and it's actually a complete rip-off of Mario Kart.
So anyways, Namco mentioned that all versions of their upcoming game on all the different consoles will feature as an unlockable character the Prince of All Cosmos from the Katamari series.
And how you unlock this character, you may ask?
by winning the gold trophy in all the circuit cups with the easy difficulty setting, which makes me believe there's more characters.
Not a surprise at all, though, that the prince is hidden in there.
I mean, they've got to milk the Katamari franchise if there's not going to be any games.
The hard difficulty, you may ask?
Hard difficulty, you get to drive as the king's package.
Shut up.
I think on the hard difficulty, you should drive a Katamari and roll over everybody.
Now, that would be fun.
You know, that racing level in We Heart Katamari was like the best thing ever.
I love the racing level.
That and the fire level.
DarkSakura, another sequel possibly in the works?
Oh, this makes my heart happy.
There was a bit of conversation heard at the Sony party.
Yuji Naka apparently was basically on some, I guess, impromptu interview was admitting that there's a new Knights game in development.
Cool.
It's about freaking time.
Just please don't let the controls suck like Sonic PS3.
Dude, Sonic PS3 just hurt my heart.
I know.
You know, it got my worst game of E3.
I know, I know.
And that's saying something.
Because that Family Feud game was god-awful.
I wouldn't play that.
I don't play set games.
I think this is interesting is that HAL is actually taking suggestions.
They've actually put up a consumer survey on Nintendo of Japan's website and the poll is designed to let gamers help select what type of characters should be in the next Super Smash Brothers.
Of course, fanboys everywhere wet their pants when they saw that Pit and Snake were going to be in the next Super Smash Brothers.
Is there a character that you think
We need Eggplant Wizard.
Hmm.
I think Eggplant Wizard would be pretty rockin' too.
Gosh, I'm really kind of stretched for ideas.
Mother Brain playable.
That's weird.
Now, Kraid might be cool.
Or like one of the baddies.
You can play as a Metroid.
I don't know.
It seems like they've done a lot of good ones.
I guess, you know, I'm glad they're just going back to Kid Icarus, honestly.
But I've heard rumors, rumblings, that...
Final Fantasy characters are supposed to make an appearance as well.
But again, that's like a big old grain of salt.
I think that sounds like more of a fanboy thing to me.
But I don't know.
We'll see.
Well, after all, I mean, they did have DreamXTV World Fighters with all the Konami characters in there, including Snake.
So why not add some of those characters?
In which case, they would have had... Was it Simon Belmont?
And I remember...
from, like, Hudson, since now Konami seems to publish all the Hudson games, Bomberman.
They even had, oh, God, Yugo from, what was it?
God, I can't remember the game now.
The crappy...
I gotta go over the chat room because they've seen some great stuff right now.
Jeremy Todd 1 wants to point out you can always Google translate the website.
Good point.
And they're sharing some great ideas.
Bobby Blackwolf says K.K.
Slider could be a character.
DMN says Little Mac.
O2G says King Hippo.
That's a good idea.
Spirit Stare says Reggie.
and Reni.
I love this idea.
A Tetris piece.
That would be funny.
And Spirit Snare.
I mean, why not?
You have Mr. Game & Watch.
Spirit Snare also suggests the dog from Duck Hunt.
Okay.
Who hasn't wanted to kick that dog's ass?
We're getting a dog though in Duck Hunt, aren't we?
But in the Smash Brothers.
Can you imagine playing the dog?
I want to kick that thing's ass.
Here are some of the ones that they had from DreamXTV.
Twinbee.
Yes.
Yes.
They also had Amoy Head from Gradius, which I thought was pretty interesting.
Solid Snake, of course, was there.
They also had Simon Belmont.
These are all Konami.
Yeah, those were all Konami ones.
So I think it's pretty cool.
S&K, who I have a lot of love for.
Basically, it was confirmed by S&K USA's president that they are going to try to get stuff out on the Wii.
They have a game for the Wii already in progress.
Basically they're saying they think Sony will do very well.
They're saying Xbox 360 will do very well.
And they're saying Xbox 360 is doing well over here.
But it seems to me like they're really looking toward the Wii.
And if Loki's list from Part A is to be believed, then Metal Slug Anthology is that game they're working on.
SNK previously announced a Metal Slug Anthology Wii game will use the new controller.
They're also working a sixth game in the Metal Slug series.
It won't necessarily show up on all of the consoles.
They're saying it is a 2D game, so they're not bringing it to the PS3 or Xbox 360 as it is.
And you can guarantee that it's not going to be any different than the other five.
Hey!
The other games had different stuff in them when they kept releasing them.
There were new characters, there were new attacks, and you had mummies.
Hey!
You know, SNK knows when they have a winner.
I'm not going to knock Metal Slug.
It is fun, and that's what's important.
They have a working formula.
They add just enough stuff to make it a little different for whoever's playing it.
I really think that if you've got something that works, if you have something that fans like, don't fuck with it.
You know?
Well said.
All right.
Moving on.
If you're downloading a lot of crap from E3, as I'm sure you guys are, beware, guys, because if you're not downloading your stuff from a trusted website, then you might actually get some spyware hidden in there.
Guess what?
Spyware folks and the people that do that, in fact, one in particular is called Spy Falcon.
There's a report running on gamesarefun.com where somebody actually got this bug in there downloading E3 coverage.
So I guess the spyware people are smartening up here and putting this stuff into, I guess, E3 videos or whatever.
So please, guys, make sure you download all your E3 coverage from E3OnPSP.com because it's the only site we can trust.
Unfortunately, everybody else puts crap in there.
By the way, Macintosh folks, if you think you're safe just because you run on Mac, Spy Falcon knows how to get into your Mac too, so watch out.
Spyware pisses me off.
I don't know about the rest of you.
Does spyware piss you off, DarkSakura?
Does it piss you off enough to want to do the FUs of the week?
Sure.
I hope so, because that's what's queued up.
FU to a person whose name I will not say.
who decided to pug me out the last day of E3 and act like an absolute child and involve himself in something that didn't involve him.
Yeah, when two people have a fight and they've resolved it, don't get emo over it.
Stay the fuck out of it.
Pardon me for saying so.
Other people's drama does not have to be your drama.
Only children do that, okay?
So grow up and get over it and get your shoes out of my car.
I'm done.
Uh, Loki, um, fuck you to whoever is behind ruining G4, because, you know, I guess I'm the last one on the face of the earth to realize that G4 is no longer a gaming network, and, you know, after, you know, browsing their section to find, oh, look, there's nine hours of non-gaming programming on there.
Whatever, okay, so I'm a little behind the game, but mainly fucking ruining X-Play.
I don't know if they've gotten lazy or what, but their review of Beatmania just pissed me off with the whole lack of knowledge in the game and just basically saying, well, it's not this game, so it gets a 2 or whatever.
So, fuck them for being lazy now.
Made the whole network burn to hell.
I don't know.
Uh, my F.U.
of the week goes to Jelly Bellies.
Because, for one, they're really addicting, and, like, they're hella good and make me fat, but that's not why I'm giving them the F.U.
I'm giving them the F.U.
because I bought this thing at the Jelly Bellies store, and it's the Hot Buttered Popcorn, and it's this case, and Buttered Popcorn Jelly Bellies are my favorite.
They're so good.
And I know a lot of people think they're gross, but you suck, because Buttered Popcorn is the best.
Actually...
Next to Toasted Marshmallow.
Buttered popcorn is the best.
And this is the thing, I bought this because it was on sale for $5.
And I'm like, cool, that's a lot of buttered popcorn jelly beans.
And it was like filling up here with all these jelly beans.
Well, I come home and I open it.
And the damn thing is filled almost to the brim with styrofoam.
There was only a handful of buttered popcorn jelly beans to fill out the top of that thing.
I realize we're not on TV.
You can't see that.
But like an inch of that was filled with jelly beans to give the illusion.
And you know what?
I should have known when I picked the damn thing up.
That it didn't feel full, but I guess, I don't know, because the styrofoam's in there, it feels weighted.
That's pretty false advertising right there.
Oh, that pissed me off.
No wonder it was discounted.
It was five, so for five bucks I got a handful of jelly beans in this useless fucking tin I will never do anything with.
You know what?
But look at it every day to remind me how much I hate it.
We'll fill it with Jelly Bellies for you.
Hooray!
No, don't do that, because Jelly Bellies make me fat.
No, Jelly Bellies don't make you fat, it's eating the Jelly Bellies that makes you fat.
Which is your decision.
Alright.
Ew, gross, DT.
What?
Bringing up freaking super bacon.
Disgusting.
They have bacon jelly bellies.
Can you believe that?
That's nasty.
Although I almost bought wild blackberry jelly bellies at the Winchester Mystery House.
That's nasty.
But coconut's my favorite.
All right, Loki.
Who's also a Jelly Belly eater, right?
I don't like Jelly Bellies.
Really?
I don't really like Jelly Beans anymore.
I used to eat them as a kid, but, you know, I'm just not really a huge fan of Jelly Beans anymore.
Anyways, um... Naughty people at E3!
Naughty, naughty people!
Fucking... Hey, dude, seriously, um... NCSoft, they have the...
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
I think you did.
No, I did not.
I'm going to go back and play.
I could almost swear you named Sega your booth at the show.
Why?
Because it had Full Auto 2 and stuff.
I'm almost positive you named Sega your booth at the show.
I didn't really care.
No, I said Capcom had good 360 games.
Oh, whatever.
Whatever.
Anyway, so like little whiny bitches, they went and complained to the E3 management who, I don't even know how the hell you can determine that a, you know,
A booth is too noisy.
Apparently they registered the decibels.
It was two decibels above, you know, where it should be, so they had to pay $5,000 for that.
So, you know, NCSoft said, fuck it, who cares, we're going to play our music as loud as we want.
And they did that, so... Yes.
Rock on, you guys.
Yeah, Sega gets my whiny pussy of E3 awards, so... Way to go.
Alright, um...
Sony, changing gears completely here.
Sony, this is interesting because if you think about the PSP, they have tried to prevent homebrew so many times.
They keep patching the damn thing over and over and they won't give up.
But yet they are embracing homebrew on the PlayStation 3.
The system development manager, Izumi Kwanishi, says that the console is going to ship with Linux built-in, so you don't have to bother to figure out how to install it.
It's going to be already installed on there, and Sony is saying, hey, homebrew folks, go ahead and develop for this.
This would be awesome.
By the way, Sony will not be providing technical support or access to SDK libraries, but Linux support is there.
That's a very strange policy when you consider the PSP.
I'm glad that they put a free operating system on their hard drives.
How very thoughtful of them.
But you know what will be interesting about this?
I just thought of this just now.
In a roundabout way, could this just be a big F you to the virtual console?
Because just run a Linux emulator.
There you got all the old school games you want.
If somebody perfects their Linux emulator, like NES emulator, for the PlayStation, did you think maybe Sony had this forethought when they saw that people were making this on the PSP?
No, because they had Linux on PlayStation 2 as well.
Don't you think Sony kind of realizes this is what's going to happen?
People are going to make emulators on this?
Probably.
Hmm.
They're little bitches.
That's what it comes down to.
Fucking little wine bitch.
But here's the thing, Sony.
People gotta buy your console before they can program emulators for it.
It's a win-win situation for Sony.
Yeah, they gotta buy them first.
That's the problem, though.
That is the major problem, is getting people to buy your console.
People will buy it.
Alright, uh, Loki.
How about that Nintendo Wii?
Does that have Linux on it?
No, it doesn't have Linux on it.
But,
Um, apparently the E3 ones were running off of quasi-GameCube hardware.
Basically, they were housed in GameCubes and stuff, which is not surprising.
I mean, it's a fucking dev kit it's running off of.
Of course it's gonna be, you know, it's sort of based on the GameCube anyway.
It's not really a big surprise.
I don't get why this is such a huge uproar in the community right now.
Like, OMG, the Wii was running off of GameCubes.
Well...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
BlackWolf liked to clarify the hardware was Wii, the box it was housed in was just a GameCube.
Okay, makes sense.
But why is this a problem?
Why are people blogging about this?
Who cares anyways?
It's a giant fucking case.
It could be the size of a giraffe.
It wouldn't matter.
And of course it wasn't GameCube hardware.
Their games were actually widescreen.
GameCube never really... I mean, there's a couple games on GameCube that'll do widescreen, but shit, hardly any.
And of course, now our chatroom, www.orange.com, click on chat.
They're just going off on the Linux thing, and they're talking about everything you can install Linux on.
DJ PooEater says, Linux on a jelly belly.
Bastard.
Hey, they put Linux on a toaster.
Why not?
And Roz says, Linux on a plane.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I'll make the joke first.
Linux on Ridge Racer.
There's actually somebody already beat you to that.
Damn it!
Linux in Africa.
Africa.
Africa.
With a K. Africa with a K. Linux 2, Linux in Africa.
What the hell was Africa?
We don't know.
It was a monstrous digging up dirt game.
I'm hoping it's Pokemon Snap, but in Africa.
I hope it's like, you know, Big Game Hunter, you know, Poacher.
You are messed up.
Big Game Poacher.
Rhino Hunter.
Moving on, now let's talk about Xbox 360.
Rumors abound that the Xbox 360 is going to get a Final Fantasy title as well.
The 360 is supposedly going to get one of the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII, because you know it's a series here, is that there's two of them on the PlayStation 3, and then one of them on the mobile phone.
Well, here's the interesting thing.
Supposedly, they've actually even trademarked a new name with Final Fantasy XIII.
What?
So that there's another sub-game that might be out on the 360.
What?
I know.
Isn't that crazy?
God.
Release one.
Here's Squeenix.
What the hell?
I know.
I don't... Oh my god.
It's weird.
I don't... You know, we don't know enough about the series yet to know if this is justifiable or not.
Well, I know the mobile game is not going to be justifiable under any circumstances.
Gotta buy them all.
But...
But I'm curious to see what is in the works of the other ones.
Again, the 360 thing is just a rumor at this stage, you guys, and sounds like it might be a little bit of hopeful MSFanboy thinking, but at the same time, it's not impossible.
Final Fantasy XI's on 360.
I heard that it might be on the live arcade.
That would be very interesting.
Why don't you support the phone game to the live arcade or something?
Make it better.
That's a better idea.
Why don't they just create Ironhander 2 instead?
DarkSakura,
But make sure you have good reception, because I hate it when we get bad sales.
But the better way to call on the show is to use the Skype line, and that is Skype username OrangeLoungeRadio.
We're going to be opening up right after this story.
Loki.
And be sure to also call Echo123 first.
Yes, call Echo123 first if you're using Skype.
Anyways.
So.
Speaking of games coming out.
Capcom saying that they're going to have both Resident Evil 5 and Devil May Cry 4 playable at Tokyo Game Show this year.
So that's excellent.
We'll get to see that.
Hey, that's just in time for the PlayStation 3 launch in a few months afterwards.
But I'm sure those aren't going to be launch titles.
But hey, more games!
Can't knock that.
You know what?
I was really impressed with their games.
Lost Planet, and Dead Rising is here.
That Dead Rising game sounds hella fun.
I'm sad I missed it.
More power to it.
I heard other podcasts talking about it.
Dead Rising is really fun.
Definitely got to check it out.
It lived up to my expectations of it.
I can't wait.
All right, our Skype line is open over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
You can call us right now.
The username is OrangeloungeRadio, or you can pick up the phone and call 916-226-9067.
We do have voicemail on there, so you can call any time during the week and leave us a voicemail if you want.
But if you don't, I'm not going to force you.
Hi, you're on OrangeloungeRadio.
Hi, this is RavensDolphin.
Hello, RavensDolphin, what's on your mind?
Well, the all-game thing...
The All Games thing?
What did you think of Alon from Chatterbox Game Show?
Yeah, but he came off of an asshole, but I listen to his show every day.
But I didn't know how he came out like that.
You know, sometimes people just have... I'm going to be bluntly honest.
I've had very little time to listen to other podcasts, and his is one of them that's on my... I want to listen to it, but I haven't yet.
But remember that sometimes people come off on the radio a lot different than they do in real life.
Like, if you ever watched that movie about Howard Stern...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It didn't sound too good.
He seemed like he was aggravated to death.
Well, I got to shift this topic, guy.
We don't want to knock other podcasts, especially independent.
No, no, I'm not knocking them.
All right.
All right.
Well, what else is on your mind?
Let's see.
What else is on my mind?
The PSPs, WTF.
Oh, God, that game was great.
Yeah, there's a lot of MarioWare minigames coming out.
I cut the bunnies very much.
You know what's really sad, though?
It's not going to be named WTF.
Why?
You've got to put it in our system.
It's WFF now.
Watch.
Work for fun.
Aw, lame.
I know.
It's retarded.
Freaking Americans.
I wanted WTF so I can say I got what the fuck.
All right.
Anything else you want to share?
Yeah.
All right.
Well, do you... No, I'm just going to hang up.
All right.
Have a good one, buddy.
Bye.
Ridge Racer.
Please let us die.
No, it says it in his bio.
It says Ridge Racer.
Couldn't resist.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
As much as I cost, you get my own theme song.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
There you go.
We had somebody sing our FU theme, so you get your theme song sung.
What's up?
Not much, it's the one and only Ranma.
How are you guys doing?
Good, Ranma.
He's my cosplay buddy.
Why aren't you coming to Faname?
2007.
Alright, fair enough.
What's on your mind?
What are you calling about tonight?
A couple things.
First of all, I want to say congratulations for Loki for getting married.
Thank you.
May the gods have mercy on your soul.
She's a nice girl.
She hates games, but she's a nice girl.
Actually, she's not a nice girl, but she's funny.
That's what makes it worth it.
Good enough, good enough.
All right.
Do you have anything game-related you want to ask about?
I have a couple of things.
All right.
I was at Nintendo World for E3 2006 press conference, and I have tons of pictures to that.
Ooh, where are they going to be at?
On my website that I'm posting right now.
In the chat room there, it looks like DJRanmaS.net.
Follow the linky links once you get in there.
Yes, and it was pretty awesome.
After the whole presentation, they had like a party to celebrate the one year anniversary.
Then they had like a nice VIP party at the end.
Cool.
And I have more pictures of me at Nintendo World meeting Reggie Phil's aims.
Actually, wait, before we get into you meeting Reggie, did the catering at the Nintendo party have those potato things with bacon and cheddar in them?
No, all we had was like quote-unquote like phony like alcoholic drinks, but they were just regular soda and crap like that.
Okay, because E3 Outpost had the potato things.
He was at the Nintendo party?
Delicious.
No, he was at the store on the East Coast.
Like you know how at E3 Outpost we had like a viewing party that was like all the podcasters watching it?
That was what they did, but at the store.
They had like these mini tacos, quesadillas, and mini hamburgers and stuff.
Enough about food.
Tell us about Reggie.
I asked him why.
I asked him.
He's like, we is everything.
We is all about us.
We is awesome.
I think I wanted to smack him for saying that.
We is awesome.
Yes.
You know what?
That's a really odd response.
That sounds like a textbook response to me.
Like in the FAQs for a PR person, here's what to say when asked this question.
Did it sound a little textbook to you when he said it?
Very much so.
Hmm.
All right.
Anything else you want to share about your experiences there at the store?
No, it was pretty much fun.
It was crowded, and I could have heard people crapping their pants after seeing the whole presentation, especially for me for seeing Starbucks.
Oh, God.
Put all those Nintendo fanboys under one roof, and it must have just smelled awful by the time it was over.
Oh, Lord, you have no idea.
All right.
Even us at the Outpost were kind of going, ooh, ah, interesting.
And when the Star Fox thing came up, we were like, damn, neat, cool.
All right, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get more calls in, okay?
Take care.
Have a good one, buddy.
Tell Reggie we said hi next time.
That I will.
Love the hair.
All right.
All right.
Let's go to another call.
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is DMN.
Hello, DMN.
What's on your mind?
Well, first of all, exclusive announcement.
Okay.
They're going to remake Portal Runner on the DS.
Just kidding.
Oops.
Nerd.
I was calling... Crap, I completely lost my train of thought.
That's right.
We do that all the time in hosting the show.
Take a moment.
Collect your thoughts.
What?
I completely drew a blank.
I apologize.
Take a moment.
We take a moment to meditate.
Work on your brain there.
Collect your thoughts.
Okay.
Did you think of it yet?
All right.
Well, call us back when you think of it.
All right.
Sorry.
That's all right.
Bye.
Live radio, kids.
We tape live.
Let's go to this call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, Sky.
This is Spirit Snare.
Hi, Spirit Snare.
What's on your mind?
Nothing much.
First off, am I the only one in the chat who's going to stand in base?
You know, I guess so, because a lot of our chatters are from all around, and they're all too cheap to travel or can't afford it or whatever, so you might be the only... I hope we have more than one person that shows up at the panel, though, or I'll be sad.
So you've got to help us advertise.
Get word out at the con.
DarkSakura, what kind of chocolate do you like most?
Because I need to give you that at a
I think you said, what chocolate?
Is that what you asked?
What chocolate?
You broke up there.
Was that the question?
What chocolate?
No, what kind of chocolate do you like best?
Because remember a couple episodes ago you were saying they have to... Right, I said chocolate.
There you go.
I am a big fan of dark chocolate, especially anything that's 75% cocoa.
What kind of brands?
Give a hint.
Drost, Lindt.
Basically the Belgian brand.
L-I-N-D-T.
I can't blame you, man.
L-I-N-D-T.
But Josta is one of my favorites.
Those truffles are like crack.
I only eat dark chocolate because milk chocolate is kind of not good for you and white chocolate is made out of the leftover milk fat when they make regular chocolate.
Why is it that every fucking week this show turns into the Food Network?
Who knows?
Without fail.
I must say, though, that when it comes to chocolate, I am a big fan of dark, dark chocolate.
So, thank you for appeasing my chocolate craving.
No problem.
You're my hero now.
All right.
Yeah.
Spirit Snare, anything else on your mind?
Nope.
Five more days.
What?
Five more days.
That's right.
And then you get to meet us in the flesh and be disappointed with our underwhelming presence in person.
All right.
Have a good one, Spirit Snare.
Okay.
Take care.
Thanks.
Good night.
Good night.
We're getting a call over here.
Hi.
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hi.
I remembered what I wanted to talk about.
All right.
Welcome back.
Welcome back.
What is it?
I was seeing if you guys were interested in something.
Okay.
Work at Nintendo.
I do get the Wii early.
And I was wondering if the listeners and you guys would be interested in me buying one out of my own pocket, donating it to OLR, and you guys giving it away on the launch date.
Fuck yes.
Okay.
Yeah, I mean, what's the deal here?
Do we have to give you something out of this?
No.
Do we get to play it first?
Because if we get it early, we're going to crack that shit open and play with it.
I guess you guys can give away a quote-unquote slightly used Wii console.
We'll autograph it or something.
That'll make it special.
Yeah, it'll be the special OLR edition Wii.
That's what we'll do.
We'll get out an orange highlighter and color it orange.
Screw that.
I'll spray paint it.
There you go.
Yeah, we'll spray paint the Wii and we'll give away the world's only orange Wii.
It'll be great.
It would work.
Also, in regards to the launch date, I don't think it's going to be October.
Oh, why is that?
Seeing as it's an October launch date,
We haven't seen any titles come into my department yet.
If it comes out in October, that gives us less than six months to test the console.
And we would probably be a bit rushed by that.
So I would probably say shoot more for November.
Did you guys test those E3 demos?
I personally did not.
I got the screw with some of them because the company has their own little mini E3 at Nintendo.
But I did not personally test any of the Wii demos.
Hmm.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe there'll be a lot of overtime coming.
The evidence for October is still pretty good, the way we're looking at it.
But, I mean, we're not necessarily claiming that is the definitive date.
We're just saying, hey, here's some evidence that makes it look pretty strong.
It's going to be October.
But, you know, you bring up a good point.
Well, maybe you'll get it in next week.
Hopefully.
All right.
Well, we've got to go.
We're going to take one more call, okay?
All right.
Take care, guys.
Bye.
All right.
One last call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Uh, Nintendo MX64, I just wanted to talk about a little bit of things.
Alright, make it quick, what's up?
Wait, wait, hang on, let me turn down volume stream.
Hang on to what?
Please do, you guys.
Alright.
Can you hear me?
Yes, we can, what's up?
Oh crap, I turned down the volume on the entire thing.
Oh my god.
Okay.
Hi, you there?
Technical Difficulties
Yeah, because in three weeks I'll be going to New York for this art show that my sister's in, and we're not going to take our van with TV and stuff that I normally play video games with, because where are you going to park in New York?
Parking garages.
Good point.
Our van's not going to fit.
Good point.
So I was going to take my laptop and stuff and do games on there.
I've played it before, yeah.
Okay, cool.
Because I mentioned a couple.
Yeah, I remember some phone call talking about this a while back.
All right, we got to let you go.
We're wrapping up.
Okay, that's fine.
What is with people forgetting tonight?
All right, have a good one.
What is with people forgetting tonight?
Something in the air.
It's because all you people have your attention diverted with the Desperate Housewives finale or something.
I'm just kidding.
I really hope you're not watching that.
Moving on.
Last Minute Stories.
We have to give our listeners more credit than that.
Anyone?
Anyone?
Actually, I have friends that watch the show and say it's great.
It's just not my thing.
I'm turning into Jamie.
There's no show I've been watching.
I haven't even watched The Soup for three weeks.
That's rare for me because that's like my favorite show.
I don't watch anything at all.
That's been me lately.
Anyway, Dark Sakura, Last Minute Stories.
Xbox Live hits 24 million downloads.
Over 600 terabytes of data were transferred during E3.
Wow.
The week of E3.
Which is 30 times more data than is found in all the printed material in the U.S.
Library of Congress.
I contributed to that number.
As we all did.
Well, we had them downloading Lost Planet at the E3 Outpost, too.
And then we played Uno.
But the single most popular item downloaded for Xbox Live Marketplace was the trailer for Halo 3.
But the rest of the download chart shows that the playable demos were more popular than the videos in general.
They had Lost Planet, Test Drive Unlimited, and MotoGP06.
So that was a bit of Microsoft news.
Awesome.
Black Wolf would like to point out Uno greater than Lost Planet.
He also says we downloaded the Halo 3 trailer at the outpost too.
I didn't see it there.
I didn't see it until I got home.
You know you just gave that away to all our listeners?
That's fine.
That's my husband.
I won't tell anybody what mine is because I don't have one.
Alright.
Loki, any last minute stories?
Yeah, if you happen to buy a DS Lite here next month or so.
You do know you can put homebrew stuff on there really simple.
Daytail actually has their Max Media Launcher, which, guess what, works just like one of those PassMe keys that they used to have.
So you can put all this wonderful stuff on there, including homebrew.
including such things as SCUMM VMDS, which is for running Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc.
DS Linux, and of course, an IRC program, among other homebrew apps.
And that Daydell thing, I believe, has carried most major retailers.
I think even they had it at Best Buy and GameStop and stuff, so.
Check it out.
All right.
Chat room is pointing out I actually cut DarkSakura off before she got her husband's full screen name out.
What?
I don't think you got the second word of his screen name out, but that's okay because if you're smart and you know what kind of games Jamie plays, you can figure out what the screen name is.
It's not mine.
Yeah.
Gunstar, come on.
I said it.
You just talked over me.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
If you're in our chat room, you'll know what it is.
If you really want to know what it is, you can send me an email to Jamie at OrangeLandRadio.com I got one of those 360 blogs for my gamer tag.
If you really want to know it, it's on the OLR forums.
I don't think Dan would come close to doing anything like that.
He just plays lots of Uno these days.
That's all you're going to see is Dan playing Uno.
Alright, let's get to the very last story of the evening and Loki's going to bring it to you.
Loki.
Yes, have you ever thought, you know,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It's a real life obstacle course which a player jumps through a bunch of different levels and stuff using a power harness provided by them.
And there's nothing digital, nothing projected, and nothing really virtual.
It's just kind of silly fun, I guess.
But if you are interested in it, check it out at NintendoAmusementPark.com.
And it's just weird.
You know the first thought that went through my mind when I read Nintendo Amusement Park?
Nintendo Amusement Park, where the lines are four hours long.
But, yeah, it's just very strange.
They have a video on their website, though, showing the ridiculousness of it, and it's interesting.
All right.
We're going to wrap it up, kids.
That's it for tonight's show, which I think might be our longest to date.
I think we're running on three hours just about here, just shy of three hours.
We've got to go around again.
Yes, Loki?
Sorry, I forgot one more thing.
All right, make it quick.
Prey demo coming to Xbox Live on June 22nd.
All right.
Now I want to finish this.
Can we finish?
All right.
Thank you guys for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio tonight and supporting Internet Radio and Independent Radio.

Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
Remember, no live show next week because we'll be at Fanime, but stay tuned to the podcast stream because our live show from Fanime will hit the podcast stream on Monday-ish.
Loki, your final thought?
My final thought is I haven't been to Fanime in a while.
My final thought is I'm looking for a place to crash in San Jose on Saturday night.
Dark Sakura.
Reject false icons.
