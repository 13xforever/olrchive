14167	24900	Tonight, May 21st, 2006, in an OLR exclusive, new evidence may have given us the release date of the Wii, Xbox's firmware is hacked and Microsoft responds, and a warning on E3 downloads.
32625	36226	Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36286	41809	This is episode number 184 for this May 21st, 2006.
42369	44450	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
44850	49271	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49411	50132	Wee!
50252	50512	Wee!
50592	50952	How are you?
51412	51912	Tired.
52093	52553	Tired?
52713	53233	Long weekend?
54018	59560	I went to see a friend and I actually just got back off the road literally 10 minutes ago.
59740	62081	You drove right up into the OLR studio.
62581	63882	Literally, she crashed into the building.
63922	64402	Lots of damage.
64422	64802	No, I'm kidding.
65402	66363	I wouldn't do that to my baby.
67763	69064	I ran into Loki's car.
70704	74526	I thought it was very interesting how you told me you were staying awake on most of the road.
74586	75506	How were you staying awake?
76042	79564	You gave me one of these little seized chocolate lollipop things.
79924	84266	Seized lollipops are the best thing ever, except for the fact they got rid of peanut butter, so screw them.
84786	89708	But I was chewing on it, and like, because it's like, there's reason ones you can't bite through.
89989	90149	Right.
90249	95231	And then like, sucking on them, and then like, a part broke off, and it had a sharp edge, and it cut my tongue.
95891	96031	Ow.
96412	96752	So yeah.
96932	97392	Sorry to hear it.
97552	102755	And then, that lasted me from about, right before the 360 toll booth, not 360, the
104802	105322	680, totally.
105342	107283	At least you're in a gaming mode, we know.
109183	115785	Until without O. Davis, and then I was like... Is there a Highway 360 somewhere?
115805	116485	I imagine there's got to be.
116505	117085	I'm sure there is.
117105	119706	Probably somewhere on the East Coast where there's nothing but highways out there.
120626	122166	There are highways here, there are freeways.
122406	126047	Anyway, also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
126267	127487	Hello, I'm here.
128688	129988	Yeah, you're here.
130373	130693	I'm here.
130873	132714	Sporting your new Silent Hill t-shirt I like.
133034	134494	Well, it's not new, but yeah.
134514	135055	Where'd you get that?
135495	136375	I got this from work.
136975	138136	Oh, lucky you.
139116	150640	I went into Hot Topic this weekend, you know, tease me if you want for going in there, but, you know, they sell some cool stuff sometimes, and also they had the Silent Hill Pyramid Head t-shirt, which rocked, so I had to pick that up.
150720	151640	They finally got that in?
151760	154301	Yes, they had it at the... I tried to get it before E3.
154581	157162	Yeah, so did I, because I wanted to wear one to E3, but they have them now.
157962	159104	and I'll see you next time.
174482	174722	DarkSakura
191881	197984	Um, well, I actually played a lot of Kingdom Hearts this weekend from like 1 until 3 in the morning.
198704	201666	I'm trying to figure out why I couldn't get back to Agrabah on my game.
202226	203327	Because I sort of skipped it.
203407	206288	I went right from Pirates of the Caribbean to Halloween Town.
207108	209189	And now I can't get back into Agrabah and the Pride Lands.
209770	212891	But Dan somehow did that because he did that before he went to Halloween Town.
213391	216953	So we're trying to figure out if I need to start my game over or just, you know, whatever.
218127	219508	Hey, if anyone knows, please let me know.
219568	220529	Send me a PM in the chat room.
222090	226093	And then we went to the Winchester Mystery House and there was an arcade there.
226634	227895	I played Theater of Magic.
228915	230717	That's one of my favorite pinball tables ever.
230917	232258	That's one of my favorite pinball tables ever.
232298	236021	I would say Baby Pac-Man, Pinbot, Theater of Magic.
236141	238083	Although I do have a lot of love for Adam Stanley.
238103	242687	Baby Pac-Man, Black Knight 2000, Theater of Magic.
243167	243688	No love for Pinbot.
243708	244869	I played X-Men vs. Street Fighter.
245169	245349	All right.
245729	250975	and their controller was broken so I called the manager because I was going to get my money back.
250995	252597	I didn't really care about my 50 cents.
252998	257903	I was like, the controller's broken on X-Men vs. Street Fighter so you can go to the gift table and get your money back.
257964	259766	I was like, so are you going to fix it?
261347	262929	And he's like, eventually.
262949	264171	I was like, that's not good enough.
265057	266098	You should go have a look at it.
266778	270721	And he just wandered off looking pissed off and I was like, dick.
274043	275364	I worked for an arcade, okay?
275464	281048	I know that you can just take out the joystick, put in a new one, or you fix the contacts.
281268	281748	It's great.
282008	283389	I own arcade machines now.
284530	286131	Did it feel just like it was a broken contact?
286151	287192	Like the joystick felt fine?
287632	288833	The joystick felt fine.
289013	290654	It wasn't moving up or down.
291295	292275	That's probably just a contact.
292575	292756	Yeah.
293076	293256	Lame.
293866	298007	Yeah, so I was like, so don't play X-Men vs. Street Fighter at the Winchester Mystery House.
298928	299628	Right.
299648	301248	Other than that, Winchester Mystery House rocks.
301548	304950	Speaking of our chat room, because you brought them up, OrangeLawnTrader.com, click on chat.
304970	306630	We love being an interactive program.
307090	312692	And DMN is winner because he went onto Wikipedia and quickly found Texas State Highway 360.
313772	315673	So there is a Highway 360 in Texas.
316173	316553	Good job.
317093	318694	Of which we are not based in.
318734	319414	We're in California.
320294	322195	Loki, how was your gaming week?
323129	323830	It was good.
325211	331956	I purchased an actual game for the DS, New Super Mario Brothers, and it was pretty fun.
332877	343045	Just plays like, I don't know, kind of a cross between Super Mario World, a little bit of, I don't know, some of the objects you have to get.
343065	347128	It kind of reminds me of Yoshi's Island a little bit, and then Super Mario 3.
347168	350631	So it's kind of a combination of those, but it's fun.
350651	351852	It's just Mario, you know.
352495	356124	So I played that, and of course I had a craving for Ridge Racer all week.
356505	357848	Ridge Racer!
357988	360654	So I played Ridge Racer 6, and that was fun.
361075	361737	And then, um...
362602	365163	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
391152	391672	Cheesy!
392572	394173	I'm like, Dan?
394973	395413	What the hell?
395513	396933	I was like, you've got a pinball machine.
396953	398073	I was like, but, no.
398893	402474	But seriously, I was looking at the rankings on my friends list, and Dan, of course, is number one.
402514	405315	He's played well over a hundred matches on that game.
405335	407375	No, seriously, he does, like, freaking tournament play.
407755	408575	Oh my, that's sick.
408615	411536	He actually has done the win the game with the wild draw seven.
411776	412476	I also draw four.
413196	414776	I got that achievement by total luck.
415476	415916	Total luck.
416156	418937	He's gotten, like, all kinds of crap on that game.
419017	419357	I'm like...
420120	420841	It's Uno.
421021	423082	I have in my car right now.
423463	424664	I have a box of Uno cards.
425604	428927	We could play real Uno and have our friends over.
430068	430388	Dork.
430788	431769	My husband's a dork.
432270	433691	I love him to death, but my husband's a dork.
433711	434211	That's alright.
434351	435412	That's part of why you married him, right?
438332	443876	I bought Bejeweled 2 for Nellie to play, and she's been on that for a long time.
443956	445617	I actually got to play a little bit of it today.
445978	446538	It's okay.
447098	452522	I don't know if it's worth the 800 Microsoft points, which I think is about 10 bucks, so I'm not sure if
453151	457916	I don't think I've seen a game with harder achievements than Bejeweled.
457936	459558	They have puzzle mode on there and
475902	477582	I'm going to cheat my way through Puzzle Mode.
477602	478283	That's lame.
478343	480143	That's how you know you're an achievement points whore.
480183	485504	Because you're doing the lame game FAQs or whatever cheat through your bejeweled game.
486124	486424	Lame.
488405	489885	You're what's wrong with America.
490365	491045	I don't care.
492205	493226	It's more achievement points.
495846	496546	What else did I play?
496566	498927	I think that was pretty much... Well, Grand Theft Auto, of course.
498987	499507	It's been fun.
499527	501247	We need a new game now.
505029	505910	New Grand Theft Auto.
506570	507811	We're not going to a new game.
508091	509652	We're just waiting for the next Grand Theft Auto to come out.
511193	512354	Sooner than later, hopefully.
513274	517557	What about Saints Row or whatever that one was at E3 that's kind of like Grand Theft Auto?
519539	520939	You can't really play that multiplayer.
520960	522581	Oh, okay, gotcha.
522621	523401	Yeah, that's the only thing.
523441	524422	We need it on PSP.
525963	533548	I'd be all down for playing multiplayer Grand Theft Auto and I hope to God that they have multiplayer in the Liberty City stories on PlayStation 2.
534409	540311	I don't think they will, but if they do, that's going to be awesome because then I'll get to kick people's asses across the country.
542292	545334	But right now, it's just... It's fun.
546194	550115	We kind of mix it up a little bit, try to mix up the teams and make it really close.
551016	552937	But I don't know.
553297	555538	And then I played... Was it Astro Pop?
555918	556438	I don't like that.
556818	558199	I think anything PopCap sucks.
560780	562741	I've been buying these games just to try them and...
564048	564368	I don't know.
565228	566809	I should probably just download the demo.
567289	570470	I have a weird appreciation for Zuma on the 360.
570870	579153	I don't know what it is, but maybe it's something about the analog stick control or something, but that one bugs me the least out of those PopCap stuff.
579513	585135	But Jeweled Control's fine, it's just I don't like how okay, no more moves, and you're fucked.
585155	592338	Well, that's not my fault that there's no more moves, it's the fact that there's random blocks, and I didn't quite
593406	596227	And there's people cheating in the DS Tetris now.
596327	597267	What the hell is that?
597287	597827	I read about that.
597867	598467	It's not on the show.
598487	599508	How lame is that?
601168	602868	I think someone in our forum said it best.
602888	604389	I'm so sorry that I'm not crediting this person.
604469	605449	I'm too lazy to look at the forums.
605729	608270	But somebody said, put a game online and people will cheat on it.
608750	609430	End of story.
609970	611070	Somebody will find a way to cheat.
611971	612411	Sad.
612431	613111	How are they cheating?
613131	616552	Weren't they giving themselves nothing but the line of four?
616792	620293	Like how when you use the star item, you get nothing but the line blocks?
620373	621433	That's what this person did, right?
621473	621893	Pretty much.
623100	624241	Damn cheaters in online games.
624461	627905	Cheat all you want offline, I don't care, but cheating online, bad.
629686	630747	Alright, anything else?
631488	631928	That's it.
632589	639596	Going to the chat room, NintendoManiac64 is amazed, Loki got Nelly to play a video game, because we know your wife hates games.
639616	640396	That was tricky.
640817	641838	That's amazing, that's good.
642659	644040	You took the wife to see Silent Hill, right?
644460	644700	Yeah.
644721	645181	What'd you think?
645641	647163	She didn't sleep well.
647423	648304	But she likes Pyramid Head?
649051	650452	She didn't think he was that scary.
650472	652733	She thought the Ash babies were more freaky.
652753	654274	The Ash babies are hella freaky.
654354	657195	I hated the people.
657415	660997	I got dragged to the Da Vinci Code the night before.
661017	662138	I saw that.
662178	664359	We were going to go see three movies this weekend.
664379	667681	We were going to go see Over the Hedge also, but we just didn't make it to it.
668041	672063	We wanted to see Silent Hill before it left theaters, because right now it's only playing twice.
673004	674104	It's either 2.10 or 9.40.
675045	676345	So it's like, crap, you know?
676606	677306	Yeah.
678636	679257	I hate that.
679317	679857	I hate that.
679937	680377	So, I don't get it.
709617	711598	DMN says, hell, look at hot coffee.
711958	713800	No need to even have real sex anymore.
714860	716902	Which I significantly agree with.
717422	719123	I mean, disagree with.
719583	720124	What we need?
720684	721605	Apples to apples.
722645	723346	That'd be great.
723966	725987	Rumor is Texas Hold'em is on its way.
726448	726788	Eh, lame.
727508	729370	Let's see, what else was said here?
729510	731971	Oh, Boss Tone says, who wants reality when you can have video games?
732792	733452	I don't know, guys.
733492	734373	Go outside once in a while.
734433	735934	It's a big, big world out there.
736633	737394	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
754045	754926	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
769860	770561	Super Mario Bros. 4
799700	801381	I played a little bit of it, and it's quite a fun.
801401	804042	They have also the multiplayer minigames, too.
804282	812266	Well, the only thing that disappointed me was that the single-player minigames were, for the most part, all the Mario 64 games, which was a little bit of a, hmm, couldn't you have just done something new?
812326	814547	Well, I think they unlock more as you play through the game.
814687	820289	I think so, too, but, you know, I was a little, there was that initial disappointment of, hmm, haven't I seen all this before?
820349	823791	But, yeah, I'm not going to knock the game for that, because there's plenty else to do in it.
825333	827094	I do recommend New Super Mario Bros.
827154	830215	if you're a DS, if you have any fond memories of Super Mario Bros.
830235	832116	1, 3, World, whatever.
832516	833657	It's a great addition.
834097	836078	By the way, you mentioning your addiction?
836798	838099	I signed back up for World of Warcraft.
838719	838919	Addict?
839339	840460	No, not really.
840860	842541	I played it once since I signed back up.
842621	847223	Actually, and then if you want to continue on my game a week, of course, I've been playing quite a bit of Final Fantasy XI because I'm just, you know...
847950	849932	I'm addicted like that, yeah, hush.
850733	854116	And Uno would be the other thing I've also been playing, is fun.
854456	863704	I also downloaded the Lost Planet demo on Xbox 360, because, you know, I heard about all this stuff at E3, but since...
864665	865646	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
894445	894885	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
917068	920831	That was our Gaming Week, so let's start to get into the news.
920911	924054	And we're going to start it off with some bits on the Nintendo Wii.
924954	926435	First, let's set the stage a little bit.
926455	929378	We have kind of something really big we want to get into, but let's set the stage a little bit.
929418	933561	Loki, a big gaming news site, runs predictions for the Wii, yes?
933641	945771	Yeah, Kotaku, they had a little story about how EB Games is, I guess they have a placeholder for Madden on the Wii, and it says, I believe it was August 30th,
947737	953722	and, you know, they're saying, you know, raises the question, are they gonna, you know, release it in the summer?
953742	961929	Um, of course, you know, the track record of EB and stuff, they, I mean, I think they had PS3 stuff in there, like, a long time ago.
962730	964151	And so, I don't know.
964831	965772	But, um, you never know.
966833	968935	So right now it's just speculation, maybe summer.
968955	969155	Summer.
970086	970767	All right, interesting.
971688	982177	Also, if you head on over to wiiNintendo.net, they're tracking, I guess, all the games that have been announced and what type of stuff is coming out on the Wii.
982558	987943	And, of course, they list all the basics, the remote, the nunchuck, the classic controller if you turn the...
988283	992487	Remote on the side, the retro controller, the light gun that they showed in the case, which was kind of cool.
992847	996391	And then they get onto the games, and these are the games they're listing as launch games.
996791	1003037	Zelda, Twilight Princess, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, Wii Sports, Red Steel, Tony Hawk Downhill Jam.
1003437	1005838	Madden NFL 2K7, or sorry, 2007.
1006658	1008759	2K7 would be a different franchise altogether, sorry.
1008819	1011379	Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen, and Tower of Mirrors.
1011799	1018021	Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, Metal Slug Anthology, Trauma Center Second Opinion, which is a great title for the second Trauma Center.
1018621	1030224	Elebits, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Blitz the League, Rayman Raving Rabbits, SpongeBob SquarePants, Creature from the Krusty Krab, Disney Pixar's Cars is what they've got listed as the launch titles for the Wii.
1031245	1031605	So now,
1032683	1045252	As you may recall, on Orange Launch Radio, a couple months ago, we posted a little bit of a spoiler on our website, so you could say, and that had to do with Castlevania Portrait of Ruin and the trio of new DDR games, right?
1045272	1049555	And remind us, Loki, how did you find this information before any of the major gaming sites did?
1049695	1053738	Well, it's just stuff that the retailers let them know.
1053758	1060082	As soon as they get updated dates on stuff, they will let their retailers know, and since I work in
1062462	1072571	I'm able to see this information, whereas most people who work in the media industry, they don't work in retail or don't really have.
1073214	1073674	and so on.
1094506	1095227	DeathJuniorPSP DeathJuniorPSP
1106121	1107182	DeathJunior2 DeathJunior2
1128752	1129513	Avatar The Last Airbender
1148773	1158702	which of course is a Nickelodeon franchise, Chicken Little Ace in Action, sequel to the Chicken Little game that came out, Metal Slug Anthology, and SpongeBob Creature from the Crust Crab.
1158883	1166890	Now that's interesting because two of those games we knew about, the Metal Slug Anthology and the SpongeBob game of course, but the other two I hadn't really heard of before.
1166930	1172856	Now of course I don't really follow Nickelodeon games, I imagine most people do, or don't, but I don't even remember...
1173556	1174677	Reading about these anywhere.
1174837	1176379	So those kind of showed up out of the blue.
1176679	1180002	The other thing I also want to mention, though, is these are from three different companies.
1180103	1189131	So if this is going to be taken as speculation, it should be... It's not just one company throwing their games in.
1189171	1190192	It's three different companies.
1190212	1194116	You've got Buena Vista, THQ, and I don't remember the last one.
1194216	1196158	Oh, SNK.
1196238	1196979	That was interesting.
1197461	1198362	So what are the dates?
1198522	1203445	The dates for Chicken Little and Metal Slug, October 11th.
1203945	1207667	And for Avatar and SpongeBob, October 18th.
1207927	1208768	So there you have it.
1208868	1209829	The Wii launch.
1210888	1213789	We're speculating it's got to be in this time frame somewhere.
1213829	1215330	But that's interesting, there's the two different dates.
1215350	1217551	You have October 11th and October 18th.
1217571	1221573	But they also, a lot of times, like for example, the 360 launch stuff comes out before.
1221633	1223094	That's exactly what I was thinking.
1223734	1235980	So when I read it, because you posted this in our private forum, we were talking about tonight's show, and my first thought was, okay, it's kind of like the 360, where some games came out a week before, and it looks like October 18th would be the launch of the Wii.
1236640	1239982	And here's another thing about October 18th.
1240002	1241743	Is this the clincher?
1242004	1242224	Yes.
1242584	1248928	October 18th marks the anniversary of the original Nintendo Entertainment System launch in the United States.
1249348	1251009	That's a very interesting coincidence.
1251850	1252830	It is very interesting.
1253971	1255072	Alright, so what do you think?
1255152	1256372	October 18th is the day?
1257133	1259174	Maybe the 11th, but most likely the 18th.
1259554	1263517	I think the hardware is pretty close to done, and launching a month in advance...
1264472	1267473	against the PlayStation 3, I think it's probably going to happen.
1267613	1273876	Okay, so devil's advocate here, why believe these dates in October versus the Madden date that we talked about just a little bit ago?
1274176	1287141	Well, from, like, retail sites, EA, for example, usually their dates, I mean, it could be, you know, a really early date, and especially, a lot of times they'll put in dates for, like, PlayStation 3, um,
1289192	1289572	Madden 07 Madden 07
1316306	1320408	That day, well the 29th I think it was, on all systems.
1320729	1323990	On Xbox 360 and all the current gen stuff.
1324851	1328273	So that's probably why they have that date on there for the Wii.
1328313	1330874	They just added another entry because they knew it was coming out on the Wii.
1331595	1333876	Not necessarily meaning it's coming out on that day.
1334196	1342181	Because obviously Madden came out last year, a lot later on the Xbox 360 for the launch.
1343162	1345165	I'm pretty confident on these.
1345866	1346387	You know what?
1346627	1351836	That makes perfect sense about the Madden thing because of all the other consoles around that same... You sold me.
1351936	1353999	I think October 18th is the day.
1354944	1356325	Maybe October 11th.
1356865	1359326	The anniversary thing.
1359346	1360787	They like doing those anniversaries.
1360847	1363008	Especially with the virtual console and everything.
1363048	1364889	It just makes too much sense.
1366050	1368972	They'd get the jump on the PlayStation 3 just by a little bit.
1369552	1376496	And enough time for the hype to build up a little bit before the crazy shopping season starts the day after Thanksgiving.
1378997	1388344	So it gives a chance for the hardcore gamers to get their systems and sell out, and then the crazy parents getting it for their kids would jump in in November, and it would sell out.
1388364	1391386	It seems like a smart kind of launch strategy, this date.
1391506	1392207	I like this date.
1392287	1393107	It makes a lot of sense.
1393508	1395409	So, yeah, that's what we've got so far.
1396050	1402274	You know, it'd be cool if they launched the system worldwide on the same day, because if that were the case in Japan, it'd be getting it in July.
1402534	1405116	But, you know, I'm going with October.
1405136	1406017	All right.
1407472	1412215	Let's go into the chat room and see if there is any thoughts there on the October 18th date.
1413356	1413696	Let's see.
1413836	1415697	Blaze says, well, here's what I think.
1415797	1420360	October 18th would be the day to release all the NES launch games on the virtual console.
1421345	1426188	Yeah, that makes sense, you know, kind of the anniversary, but why not the actual console itself the same day?
1426468	1437274	I think most of us were banking on November as it was, and we kind of thought, hmm, Nintendo, disruption, wouldn't they want to get their system out there in kind of a unique time frame?
1438514	1440055	All the pieces fit together with this date for me.
1440535	1450641	And although, yeah, it's not solid, it's not an official confirmation, we are going off a little bit of shaky evidence, maybe, because the dates do shift around.
1450721	1451542	It just makes sense.
1452122	1461268	Well, and also the fact that we have three different companies agreeing on a date, pretty much, or at least a launch week window, because usually it's about two or three weeks.
1462969	1466070	I'm going to have to definitely say that it's looking that way.
1466291	1466891	And you know what?
1467489	1468171	Thanks for watching!
1475390	1481872	We'll find out pretty soon when the official date's going to be, but I wouldn't be too surprised if it's October 18th.
1481952	1482873	So here's my other question.
1482913	1484713	Why do you think Nintendo's sitting on this date now?
1484933	1493216	If they kind of know, and they've told their third-party publishers what day they're planning on launching their system, what are they waiting for to tell the rest of us?
1493296	1495917	What event do you think they're going to finally announce all this?
1496397	1502579	Well, I think they're waiting for maybe to see, because I guess the PlayStation 3, they could maybe try to get
1504237	1519406	Maybe, you know, if they announce that they're going to be launching, you know, in November or something, and then kind of false sense of security for Sony or something like that, and then, you know, that way, you know, two months in advance, they're all, get the jump on them.
1519666	1520527	That makes sense.
1520587	1522508	Ha, bitch, we're launching fucking 30 days.
1522528	1522928	Disruption.
1522948	1523568	Disruption.
1524209	1524749	So, I don't know.
1526010	1526350	All right.
1527171	1527591	I like that.
1528731	1530052	All right, we'll see what happens, guys.
1530392	1532954	October 18th, that's what we're betting on for right now, so.
1533837	1537326	More official news to follow as soon as we hear it.
1538854	1540615	Moving on to other news.
1540755	1542036	Now we've got the release date.
1542136	1542936	What about the price?
1543577	1547619	Well, rumor is flying around from Sweden, of all places.
1547679	1553763	The Daily News in Sweden is saying that the Wii console will be between 2,500 and 3,000 kronor.
1553823	1555444	So if you translate that into U.S.
1555524	1557385	dollars, that's 340 U.S.
1557445	1557705	dollars.
1557745	1559306	But keep in mind...
1566310	1569214	In Europe, they tend to get screwed on the prices of the consoles.
1569254	1569774	Sorry, guys.
1570215	1579045	But probably the Wii would then be in the $250 to $300 ballpark, which is a little higher than the $199 we're all assuming.
1579645	1579926	Thoughts?
1580206	1581007	I think it's $199.
1581608	1584771	All their other systems have launched for $199, as far as my memory serves me.
1584791	1585492	So...
1587000	1591361	And if they're going to do the anniversary of the NES launch, why not do the price?
1591782	1592242	Exactly.
1593142	1594302	I think a lot of us are sold on $199.
1594943	1597663	I think it's kind of the price that Nintendo's expected to meet.
1599704	1602245	I'm agreeing more with the $250 price point.
1603365	1603825	Why is that?
1604726	1615289	Just because it's still competitive without being, I would say, prohibitively... It's not going to...
1617169	1621192	They can still make their money on it and yet still have it be generally affordable for most people.
1642908	1645789	250 or rather 249 would be cutting it a little close.
1645909	1648209	And I think in that case, Nintendo would have definitely done the 199.
1649430	1657712	But now that PlayStation 3 has really highballed it, maybe they can release it for 249 and it's still the cheap system.
1658072	1658452	But I don't know.
1658472	1659272	There's something about that 199.
1659632	1667114	They might be waiting to see what Microsoft's going to do as far as dropping the price of their console.
1668294	1670976	That's true, too, because Microsoft may have come out of that conference.
1670996	1675158	They could have, hypothetically, come out of that conference and said, we're cutting the price of our core system.
1675638	1678020	And that maybe was something Nintendo wanted to be prepared for.
1678740	1686404	Here's another thought, though, especially in this whole dual levels, the core and the premium and then the PS3, little drive and big drive.
1686784	1689566	This has been done before with the original NES.
1690106	1692006	You had the regular NES system.
1692026	1693187	You actually had three levels, right?
1693207	1694247	You had the regular NES.
1694607	1696887	Then you had the, I don't know, was it the action pack?
1696907	1700088	The one that came with the light gun and the duck hunt in Mario Brothers.
1700408	1704249	And then there was the, I don't remember what it was called, the robot pack or some other type of pack.
1704709	1706149	It was the one with Gyromite.
1706489	1708330	Right, and it had Rob the Robot as well.
1708590	1708690	Yep.
1709010	1711710	And wasn't there one also with the power pad and duck hunt?
1711730	1712370	Yes, there was.
1712450	1713251	Years later, yes.
1713391	1713731	You're right.
1713811	1714731	The world class track meet.
1715311	1718031	So hypothetically, couldn't Wii possibly be launching $199, $249?
1719612	1728513	Maybe $199, I don't know, system controller, virtual console points only, and $249, all that plus Wii Sports.
1728593	1734434	I think they want to simplify it, and they're not going to try to do that, because their market is for new gamers.
1734594	1741535	They're not going to try to confuse them with two different price points and stuff, and trying to get you to buy the more expensive system.
1742116	1743056	I don't think they're going to do that.
1743356	1744556	I mean, they haven't done that with
1744887	1748390	Any of their consoles, you know, anything recent.
1748790	1752414	And just, you know, I wouldn't see them doing that.
1753835	1755116	Okay, comments from the chat room.
1755156	1757498	Lots of interesting thoughts on the price point here.
1757538	1758179	Funnydale says,
1768311	1771192	I don't know if Microsoft can afford to drop it that low right now.
1771612	1772593	Next year, maybe.
1773033	1774353	This year, I don't know.
1774393	1781256	It still seems... Microsoft still has the whole high-definition thing to sell the consoles with, right?
1781336	1783596	I don't think they need to drop their console price.
1783616	1787878	I don't think they... Because they know they're not competing with Nintendo as far as
1788376	1791118	Next Gen, Nintendo's in their own kind of game.
1791358	1792979	There was that whole endorsement.
1793079	1801345	Both companies, Microsoft and Sony, have practically said, sure, get a Nintendo, as long as you don't buy Microsoft, Sony, whatever the competitor is.
1801365	1802145	Sure, get a Wii.
1803786	1804387	I think it's funny.
1804927	1806108	Very interesting thought here.
1806948	1807689	I agree with that, too.
1809124	1810325	Spirit Snare has a thought.
1810405	1813086	Sky, the core console wasn't changed.
1813146	1814367	Those were merely bundles.
1815007	1821610	That's a good point, but, you know, and somebody else said, DMN said, you guys forget those were accessories.
1822131	1827433	True, but the Wii has an assortment of accessories as well to play with, right?
1827453	1829875	You have the classic controller, the light gun.
1831275	1832595	So why not some of these things?
1832655	1844699	But I think the point is that that's not really right to compare it to the way Xbox is doing their bundle and the way that Nintendo, because Nintendo's is actually different stuff on the system itself.
1845179	1845959	I can understand that.
1846319	1854062	All I'm trying to say is could Nintendo launch two different Wii, one at $199 and one at $249 with different stuff?
1855062	1855882	Yes, right?
1856362	1857903	No matter what, they could do different bundles.
1857983	1859183	I honestly think that the way
1859969	1870735	If they want to keep it at $199, what they need to do is to have a pack with this particular thing, a pack with this particular thing, a pack with this particular thing.
1870775	1873076	You pick the one that you want to get based on the types of games you like.
1873857	1874237	And then...
1875242	1882868	You can get special deal with this thing for another X amount of money to get all the other accessories coming to a total of $250.
1883169	1884630	And how Nintendo would this be?
1884730	1889093	Release like a blue pack and a red pack and a, I don't know, white pack or something?
1889113	1890535	Well, they have a white, black, and blue.
1892056	1898521	I don't know.
1900263	1906147	I mean, I don't think it's going to get that crazy because I don't think they're going to complicate it.
1906187	1910011	But that's a good thought, though, that, you know, there's all different types of ways Nintendo could do this.
1910791	1919999	Anyway, we could hypothesize until the cows come home, but we won't know anything for sure until Nintendo confirms, which hopefully will be soon.
1923312	1924892	Loki, what else is coming with the Wii?
1941049	1943811	It's going to be the only console out there with a web browser built into it.
1944111	1945592	I mean, since maybe the Dreamcast?
1945712	1952916	Just in the interest of disclosure here, I think there's a story coming up later on tonight about the PS3 interface has been shown and there was a web browser integrated in the PS3.
1952996	1953876	So just, you know, big deal.
1954316	1956738	And the Dreamcast web browser was not actually part of the system.
1956798	1957418	It was a disk.
1958119	1958339	True.
1959379	1960280	Okay, well, whatever.
1960320	1960560	I mean...
1962324	1964786	Oh, goody, the PlayStation 3 web browser.
1965026	1965606	No, you know what, though?
1966087	1966727	I applaud this.
1966887	1967728	Applause, applause, applause.
1967768	1976474	Having the Opera browser here because it shows... You know, I think... Well, I was already really sold on this, but it definitely shows Nintendo is embracing online.
1977034	1978095	Good job, Nintendo.
1978135	1978556	Thank you.
1978896	1979276	Not quite.
1979796	1980717	Oh, right.
1980797	1987802	They're not really embracing online because Metroid Prime 3, not online multiplayer.
1990264	1990964	There's a lot of their...
1992643	1996545	Sort of getting it, but not quite 100% yet.
1997165	2006409	I think Nintendo has an interesting enough thing going on with the whole controller aspect that Metroid doesn't need to be multiplayer yet.
2006469	2009131	Why do that when Metroid 4 can be online multiplayer?
2009611	2015013	Halo, the original, wasn't multiplayer, but then again, Xbox Live wasn't quite what it was at that point.
2015254	2016154	You could, though, land it.
2017614	2021978	We've done the four Xbox hookup LAN parties on Halo.
2022198	2032007	And it doesn't mean that they couldn't, yeah, and it doesn't mean that you couldn't maybe later on, you know, upgrade it or add a, you know, an update.
2032127	2036932	Yeah, the Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, you know, special edition with online multiplayer.
2037112	2040915	Or just, you know, was it Nintendo Connect 24 or whatever?
2047914	2051257	Ion671 says, so you can pay $500 to surf the web on the PS3.
2051378	2053520	Well, yeah, but here's the thing, though.
2053660	2060146	Xbox 360, this is one thing they're kind of lacking right now, which is surprising, seeing as Microsoft had the web TV thing a while back, right?
2060726	2063649	I'm kind of surprised that 360 doesn't have a web browser yet.
2064230	2065411	It's a little surprising.
2066634	2068137	I mean, it's not the end of the world.
2068618	2070461	I can surf the web on my computer, yeah.
2070802	2074589	And maybe this is what Microsoft realizes, is that why put a web browser in here?
2074629	2075130	Because, you know...
2075768	2077429	Most people surf the web on their computers.
2077489	2079631	But I think it's kind of a neat feature.
2079691	2083934	There's something kind of neat about having a website right there on the television.
2084114	2088757	And think about some of those games that have websites accessible from within the game.
2088797	2096902	Like I know this is a real weak example, but Phantasy Star on the GameCube, you kind of went on the Phantasy Star website and you could actually like read the forums and stuff from the GameCube.
2097403	2098884	So I don't know.
2098904	2103907	I know it's kind of a weak example, but you could supplement games with websites right on the TV, right?
2103927	2104047	Yeah.
2105376	2106096	That'd be cool too.
2106156	2109377	Text entry on those websites via the DS.
2110798	2111138	Maybe.
2111878	2114439	Didn't the Opera browser on the DS, isn't that supposed to have handwriting recognition?
2114899	2115899	I seem to remember seeing that.
2116359	2116639	I don't know.
2117320	2120421	But yeah, so it'd be pretty good.
2120861	2123162	SpiritsNair says, Sky, but web TV sucked.
2123842	2125542	Okay, true, but the technology's there.
2126002	2127203	Funnydale says, So what?
2127263	2130424	Microsoft can offer a web browser free on Xbox Live next week.
2130744	2132865	True, but they haven't yet.
2133225	2134265	They can, but they haven't.
2137272	2138835	Tiger Claw says, Very true, Sky.
2138875	2140479	Many websites have Flash games.
2140940	2142844	So why not play the Flash games on the TV?
2142884	2146412	Well, maybe Microsoft doesn't want that because then they wouldn't be able to sell Bejeweled.
2146492	2146813	I don't know.
2146933	2147234	I don't know.
2148072	2149193	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2172751	2180194	Okay, in Louisiana, the House unanimously passed, basically, HB 1381 on Tuesday.
2181414	2192959	It was a bill that applies the Miller obscenity test to video games, sort of like the whole games as porn tactic that's been going on.
2193239	2193379	Right.
2194261	2197063	I got some information from Game Politics on this one.
2197083	2198464	Actually, a few interesting quotes.
2198824	2201086	There's a lot of people who are just really pissed off over this.
2201206	2203548	I think it's just as stupid as I do, probably.
2204849	2207130	One of the editors for the Daily Comet...
2208766	2211607	stated, and I quote, Why does the government feel the need to parent children?
2211747	2212127	Amen!
2212187	2212608	Thank you!
2213028	2213268	Sorry.
2214328	2217830	Few will be persuaded that violent video games or movies have a negative effect on children.
2217930	2218810	It's only a game.
2218870	2219630	It's only a movie.
2219690	2221931	People are smart enough to distinguish the difference, some believe.
2222432	2226153	As for me, I believe I can give better guidance to my children than Baton Rouge or Washington.
2228054	2230715	But there's another funny one on here, though, that...
2232313	2232933	It made me laugh.
2232973	2236995	It was actually by the editor of the Home I Care Courier.
2237015	2243099	It says, I could watch football from now until the cows come home, but I wouldn't be able to throw like Brett, I guess it's Favre, F-A-V-R-E.
2243919	2245880	I don't watch football, so I don't really care.
2247501	2249582	And I could play Grand Theft Auto for the next 12 years.
2249622	2252583	I don't think I would be looking for policemen to murder or prostitutes to pimp.
2253124	2260307	That's because, and let me phrase this correctly so that even the Solons in Baton Rouge can comprehend the message, it's just a game.
2262375	2266680	I'm actually reading the text of the bill here, which you can access on GamePolitik's website.
2267221	2269223	I'm just kind of reading what they want to add into the law here.
2269284	2269644	Let's see.
2269984	2272407	Prohibited sales of video or computer games to minors.
2272668	2276993	A. An interactive video or computer game should not be sold, leased, or rented to a minor if a tree or
2278007	2280088	If the Trier of Facts determines all of the following.
2280428	2280088	1.
2280828	2289193	The average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the video or computer game taken as a whole appeals to the minor's morbid interest in violence.
2289753	2290053	Vague.
2290834	2290053	2.
2291154	2297117	The game depicts violence in a manner patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable for minors.
2297757	2298037	Vague.
2298057	2298037	3.
2298578	2303740	The game taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value for minors.
2303960	2305321	What the hell is that supposed to mean?
2307279	2313924	It's just another... It's basically... It's another just attempt of the government trying to control children.
2314024	2324733	I mean, basically trying to have control over how children are raised trying to do the parent's job for them so they grow up to be nice little, you know, mindless sheep for them to have them later in the future.
2324853	2326054	Who's going to determine that?
2326094	2331458	The game lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.
2332458	2334420	They've got established standards.
2334460	2336782	See, they're trying to apply something...
2338306	2339687	is not applicable for our game.
2341788	2348733	I mean, but you can't even really apply this to movies or even books.
2349374	2354737	I mean, who's to judge whether this is of literary or artistic value?
2355918	2356919	How can you judge art?
2357580	2358900	Art is not meant to be judged.
2359141	2360362	Art is meant to be interpreted.
2361482	2364224	Well, apparently that's their interpretation of it.
2364324	2364945	Well, it stinks.
2367079	2379367	Well, then again, you know, with the, there was, remember the whole outcry they were having with the tour of the statue David going around?
2379927	2380828	Because it's nude.
2381588	2382028	It's art!
2383229	2386111	That was actually a big deal when I was in Alabama.
2387092	2387693	I don't get that.
2387833	2388853	It's a penis.
2389314	2391515	Half of America's already seen one, at least.
2391876	2394538	And the other half probably did see one already.
2394558	2396399	Well, no, that's what I meant.
2396579	2400842	They've seen their own, or they've probably seen one, one way or another.
2400862	2401863	What's the big deal?
2404945	2406486	I sort of put that in the same category.
2406607	2411690	It's the whole closed-minded censure of things that...
2413459	2418380	Their version of inappropriateness, but I really, I really, really think that there is an ulterior motive to all this.
2419360	2433823	I think that, I honestly, as much as we're seeing this coming, especially, and Republicans don't, you know, get all upset with me or anything, coming out of the Republican camp and coming out of the Democrats too, because, you know, we've got Hillary spearheading all this bullcrap.
2434723	2438864	You know, we've got our two major...
2439730	2440390	and DarkSakura.com
2467796	2471239	Our chatroom is just lighting up, like line after line after line on this here right now.
2471259	2473100	I've never seen the chatroom scroll so fast.
2474000	2478343	BlackWolf makes the smart-ass comment, Africa has artistic value.
2479403	2483646	The PlayStation 3 title that made most of us go, what the F is this?
2484607	2485007	Let's see.
2486047	2487648	SpiritSnare says, artistic?
2487809	2489950	You need to play fucking Mario Paint, okay?
2491075	2492116	Okay, very interesting there.
2492456	2499340	Funnydale says, to all of the gamers who say that if we just ignore Jack Thompson, he will then go away, this proves this is not true.
2500500	2501341	Interesting thought.
2502181	2502762	Very interesting.
2502802	2504723	Yeah, he was also a chief witness at that.
2505750	2506491	Did you notice that?
2506631	2507231	No, I didn't.
2507831	2509392	Yeah, it's a comment here.
2510372	2511833	And I'm going to do another quote.
2511893	2513014	It's from the Shreveport Times.
2513614	2519897	It says, The fact that Jack Thompson was testifying in favor of the bill should immediately set off alarms.
2520297	2529722	Thompson evokes no one so strongly as Frederick Wortham, a psychologist whose 1950s book, Seduction of the Innocent, led to the congressional hearings on the dangers of comic books.
2529962	2530062	Hmm.
2531727	2543094	more comments in the chat room here GS191, I'm tired of game politics the politicians will never get video games I say let them pass their stupid laws it's going to be us that's going to gain control and take out the laws in the long run
2543502	2545663	Not if they are successful.
2546503	2547464	Here's my thought, guys.
2547724	2549844	If this makes you mad, don't write us a letter.
2549904	2551725	Well, I mean, we of course want your feedback.
2551745	2552565	Go ahead and write us a letter.
2552645	2557187	But you need to be writing your congressman a letter, especially if you're over the age of 18.
2558007	2559848	And here, I'm going to start your letter for you.
2560348	2564190	Dear Congressman, I am a registered voter.
2564990	2567791	Then go ahead and express yourself cleanly, please.
2568832	2571473	It's just for all the people who say, though, that we are...
2573648	2575010	We're going to be in power.
2576271	2579675	The younger generation is going to be the one to overthrow that.
2580917	2584681	Imagine what's going to happen if they're successful in censoring what that generation sees.
2584781	2585963	Isn't that what everyone said in the 60s?
2586003	2586303	Maybe.
2589367	2589607	Maybe.
2590359	2591520	I wasn't alive in the 60s.
2591760	2598264	I know, but I'm just saying, you know, you kind of look back on that whole, you know, hippie movement and everything, and I have a feeling they were saying the same thing.
2598284	2600585	There was a lot more to it than that necessarily, the hippie movement.
2600605	2605988	That was around a whole war and... Okay, so I'm making a very broad generalization.
2606008	2607169	And people were fucking like bunnies.
2607830	2608050	Sorry.
2609711	2610851	But I'm serious.
2611032	2613193	I honestly do think that that's their agenda.
2614318	2627083	from what it's looking like, this is just my own little conspiracy theory here I think that, you know, honestly I think that they're afraid of having an open-minded youth about having people there who's going to question
2627930	2629791	instead of just blindly follow their lead.
2630271	2632512	They lose power if you don't blindly follow.
2633392	2636914	Some folks in the chat room are saying that they're too young so they'll just write us a letter.
2637034	2638714	Okay, that's fine, but here's a better thought.
2640155	2643456	If you're too young, talk to somebody who is a registered voter.
2643576	2644977	You can still have an impact.
2645657	2646698	You can still have an impact.
2647878	2649379	I say talk to your parents about it.
2650019	2653580	I think it would be great to talk to your parents about your thoughts on that.
2653601	2654641	You can still write your congressman.
2655444	2655824	That's true.
2655885	2656766	You can still do it.
2656786	2660790	You can say, hey, I am X years old and by this election I will be registered to vote.
2660850	2661331	That's very true.
2661371	2663773	I imagine most of you guys that listen to this show... Block the vote.
2663813	2664314	Remember that?
2664915	2670721	Trying to get people who were just turning 18 who were kids to... Vote or P. Diddy will kill you?
2671522	2672223	You know what I mean, though.
2672263	2674465	It was the same thing.
2674686	2675747	You can still write in.
2676929	2678430	You can still get your voice out there.
2678570	2681853	All right, I'm going to end on this note because Roz, I think, just won the chat room here.
2681873	2687117	We've got to keep it moving, but Roz says, Dear Jack Thompson, you are a giant enemy crab.
2687377	2689579	I hit you in your weak spot for massive damage.
2689719	2690139	P.S.
2690540	2691660	Ridge Racer.
2693822	2694523	Roz, I love you.
2697365	2698586	Moving on to another story.
2698686	2699126	Loki.
2699967	2700387	Yes.
2700627	2701848	Hacking and cracking.
2702168	2702989	Oh, yeah.
2703109	2704190	On the XB360.
2704230	2704730	What happened?
2705171	2706432	Well, they...
2708748	2720730	They actually were able to, as I think a while back there was a video of them hacking the 360 to play backups of discs.
2721230	2724911	And now they were successful on some of the 360s.
2724931	2732212	Because the 360 comes with either one of two optical drives, either a Toshiba Samsung drive or a Hitachi drive.
2732892	2736933	And if you have the Toshiba Samsung drive, well guess what?
2737617	2744338	You can actually mod your firmware on the actual optical disk drive and be able to play backups.
2744458	2751319	And basically what it does is it kind of works the same way that they did with the Xbox One firmware and their disk drives.
2751939	2755680	It patches the response to the media check into the disk drive.
2755700	2759661	So basically when you pop in a game, it will check, okay, is this a burnt disk?
2759861	2763261	Is this a pressed disk from Microsoft?
2763622	2764522	Is this a CD?
2764722	2766362	What type of media am I reading?
2767132	2772697	and, you know, usually if you have a DVD plus R or something like that, it's not going to play it if it's a game.
2773117	2779202	So what this does is no matter what the hell you put into it, it replies back to the system saying, yep, we're good, play the game.
2779662	2787008	So, yeah, right now they're working on a way to be able to get to work on the Hitachi drives.
2787403	2788324	DarkSakura, what do you think?
2788364	2790124	Microsoft going to be happy about this?
2812557	2819300	Well, basically, they've issued an official statement to warn the 360 owners about messing with their system, pretty much.
2821021	2824563	Basically, they're saying the core security system has not been broken.
2824963	2837330	However, on some Xbox 360 consoles, the authentication protocol between the optical disk drive and the console may be attacked via complex software and hardware modification, which could allow people to play illegally copied and modified games.
2840531	2845053	Um, so, pretty much what they're talking about is, yeah, you do that, you void your warranty.
2846193	2847454	Isn't that the classic response?
2847474	2848935	Don't void your warranty!
2848995	2858198	Well, here's another thing, too, that they're working on right now, is they're actually having multiple BIOSes on the chip, on the actual DVD drive, so, basically, the flip of switch, I want to play it on live.
2858398	2869843	Flip the switch over, runs off the original thing, you can't play the, you know, the copy thing, but you can, um, you know, and they might not even be able to detect, you might be able to break that, so it can't detect what your firmware is on the, um,
2871118	2873441	GK128 Mess with your 360s, say goodbye to live, bitch!
2897185	2899966	and DMN says, Dear 360 owners, don't fuck with your firmware.
2900006	2900366	P.S.
2900467	2901347	Ridge Racer.
2901967	2904508	Oh, we're full of comedians tonight in Orange Launch Radio chat.
2905349	2907950	Is that going to become our new cake or death?
2908470	2908790	I don't know.
2909351	2916594	It's the new inside, or not really inside joke, but line of the week that's going to just get beat into the ground until you're all sick of it, if you're not already.
2918195	2918475	All right.
2919775	2920956	PlayStation 3 Pre-Orders at GameStop and EB Games
2940149	2950575	A rumor is I guess what they're trying to do is go or try to avoid what happened with Xbox 360 where they were taking pre-orders for a long time and it was too many pre-orders to fill essentially.
2950595	2957299	They didn't get enough systems and when they couldn't deliver people's systems until February or March, who got the flack for that?
2957399	2958040	Microsoft?
2958260	2958420	No.
2958840	2962641	GameStop and EB Games did because why aren't you getting enough consoles?
2962961	2965142	People maybe didn't really know where to place the blame.
2965562	2974085	So GameStop and EB are thinking this time, okay, if we only open it up for a certain window, then folks, we won't have such a huge list.
2974165	2975025	But I don't know.
2975505	2979987	If people find out the day the GameStop's going to start taking orders, people are going to be lined up that morning.
2980917	2991685	I think, you know, the Sony fanboys anyway, you know, say what you want about whether you're going to get or not get a PlayStation 3, but the rabid launch fans, there's enough of them where, you know, there'll be a line going out the door the day they start taking pre-orders.
2992125	2999831	So I think this will help that situation a little bit, but it's not going to, if Sony can't produce the systems, it's going to be the same thing all over again.
3000351	3003533	Also, their launch windows, like, their launch games suck.
3003894	3004654	You know, you never know.
3006515	3007696	Well, anyways, we'll get to that later.
3007716	3008177	All right.
3008337	3008617	All right.
3010205	3018589	Moving right along, DarkSakura likes to kind of look around at different websites, including those overseas, and UK reaction to the price?
3019349	3025372	Well, according, there's actually been an official price released for the UK in particular.
3026912	3035956	They're releasing it, basically they're releasing it for 425 pounds for the 60 gig model, but there's not any type of word if they're getting the 20 gigabyte model.
3037802	3039784	of course, what's the point since it has no HDMI?
3040905	3041745	No Wi-Fi.
3042766	3045909	Yeah, unless you don't plan on having an HDTV in the next few years.
3045929	3046309	I don't know.
3046489	3053355	No, this is funny, though, because in euros, it's 599 euros for the 60 gigabyte, which goes to 405 pounds.
3053915	3059680	So actually, they're not getting it for that good of a deal.
3059700	3065584	I mean, it's off a little bit, but still going to be a little bit more expensive than the general price in euros.
3067390	3069352	They're really trying to push the Blu-ray thing.
3069572	3078059	Their managing director for Sony UK, Ray McGuire, is basically going around saying, Oh, Blu-ray!
3078159	3080460	Blu-ray player is 600 to 700 pounds.
3080500	3081741	You're getting a big deal.
3082042	3083102	Blu-ray, Blu-ray, Blu-ray.
3083203	3086065	Yeah, where was the Blu-ray movie on the E3 show floor?
3086645	3087766	I'm wondering that myself.
3090008	3090949	On top of that, they're...
3094923	3100005	I think there's a lot of negative reaction to it just from the nature of his statement.
3102566	3107367	The point is that most people don't realize what they're actually getting with a PlayStation 3.
3107507	3114210	It's like, no, they're getting something that's not going to be what you're trying to make it out to be.
3115250	3118011	And really, it's still going to be more expensive there than it is here.
3119844	3122446	Very interesting comment in our chatroom from Funnydale.
3123066	3125208	Oh, quick griping about the price of the PlayStation 3.
3125588	3127830	People pay $500 for a fucking iPod.
3127870	3129892	They pay $500 for a damn video card.
3130212	3132313	They will pay $600 for a PlayStation 3.
3133854	3137897	I say, yeah, there are going to be people that will pay the $600 for a PlayStation 3.
3139238	3139579	I will.
3139839	3143522	These are the same retards that bought DVHS also.
3143622	3147405	Just because I have to have every system, I will pay $600 for the PlayStation 3.
3147445	3148866	I'm not going to be happy about it, but I will do it.
3149727	3160715	But the thing is, the iPod, if you want to make that comparison, didn't really achieve huge amounts of success until they released cheaper models that still got the job done.
3160795	3161255	You know what I mean?
3161535	3162556	I never bought an iPod.
3163317	3165398	Well, you did the free iPod thing, right?
3165418	3165999	I got a free iPod.
3166019	3168901	Well, I'm sure they'll do a free PS3 if you want to go that route.
3168921	3169841	They're already out there.
3171723	3173264	That's a controversial thing, but whatever.
3173484	3177186	If that's what makes it work for you, then go for it.
3177667	3177827	But...
3179222	3180643	I like Bobby's comment.
3182324	3184385	Oh, Bobby going for the jugular there.
3184445	3186826	Loki paid $600 for an Xbox 360, didn't he?
3187266	3189687	Actually, that was $700 for a 360.
3191268	3192648	So why all the PS3 hate?
3192708	3196910	Because you think you're going to be paying $300 more if you end up going eBay or what?
3197291	3198151	No, I just don't.
3198735	3201877	There's not really any games for me that I want to get right at launch.
3201897	3202837	Are you not going to get it at launch?
3203438	3203918	I might not.
3204038	3205779	I have to see what their launch games are going to be.
3206059	3209541	That's really going to determine it for me because it's all about the games.
3209601	3210061	You know what?
3210221	3211262	If they don't have that many...
3211926	3214588	Good games at launch or if it's not what I like, I'll wait.
3215088	3222672	Right now, I'm about an 80% yes on it because I know I can benefit from the Blu-ray being an HDTV owner and all that stuff.
3224493	3228836	And again, a large part of why I'm saying this is because I have to have all the consoles.
3228936	3229456	I want them all.
3229936	3232298	But I realize everybody's not like that.
3232318	3233539	I say that now and you know.
3233899	3237941	Yeah, all the hype will start a month before and you'll be like, I have to have one.
3237981	3238842	Paris Hilton has one.
3238862	3239522	Why can't I have one?
3240325	3240785	I'm just kidding.
3241485	3241765	All right.
3241785	3247307	I mean, it's just people are looking at like a game system.
3248067	3252609	You know, they're not seeing the long life that they might see in something else.
3252969	3253369	I don't know.
3253949	3255850	It's just still.
3256970	3260051	Here's a comment from Ota G, who I haven't read anything from tonight in our chat room.
3260091	3261391	OrangeLaunchReady.com, click on chat.
3261891	3263932	The price of the PlayStation 3 isn't the problem.
3263992	3266433	The fact that Sony hasn't justified it is.
3267553	3267693	Hmm.
3268837	3269498	Debate, Debate
3292529	3294491	Mother 3 is going to get an English translation in Europe.
3315393	3322596	So, hooray for Europe, but if you're in the United States, you're still not happy because E3 went by and still no Mother 3 announcement for the US.
3322616	3323176	Import the bitch.
3323516	3324817	There's no lockout guard.
3325097	3328358	Yeah, there's no region differences on these.
3328558	3329419	Just import it.
3329459	3331019	Well, you're going to have to pay the higher price.
3331039	3331239	Import!
3332160	3333040	Amazon UK!
3333981	3343304	Well, just to make it clear, the official Nintendo magazine in the UK is saying that it will come out in December in Europe and it's going to be released for the Game Boy Advance edition.
3344285	3345005	I'm sorry, Game Boy Advance.
3346417	3347718	So, you're right though.
3347898	3354921	If you want to pay the extra bucks there, or import it through UK, just pay the slightly higher shipping fees, at least you get your English translation.
3354961	3356062	So maybe it's not all bad news.
3356682	3358963	And I know a damn lot of people that will do it.
3359243	3369268	So I think Nintendo of America is kind of... I mean, I guess all the money goes to Nintendo in the end, but I think Nintendo of America at least, at least, if nothing else, print...
3370129	3373972	A low run and do what you did with the electro plankton.
3374012	3375573	Sell it on your website or something.
3375694	3377935	Just release it in stores and don't advertise for it.
3379236	3384981	I just can't believe something like this won't come out here, especially when an English translation is now done.
3385421	3387963	But freaking Dr. Sudoku out there on store shelves.
3389725	3390245	I don't get it.
3390425	3390946	Baffles me.
3392607	3393728	That's because people are crazy.
3394480	3395502	I'm surprised how much...
3407711	3411252	I remember seeing Sudoku in magazines and going, wow, I have to do math?
3411312	3411832	Fuck that.
3413092	3414233	They used to have a different name.
3414273	3416153	They weren't always called Sudoku here in America.
3416193	3420454	They used to print those in the penny press publications as crypto numbers or something like that.
3420694	3422475	They're all over the place now.
3423275	3425496	Now that I'm looking for them, I'm like, holy crap.
3425516	3435238	Here's the honest justification for Dr. Sudoku on the Game Boy Advance or whatever is because Nintendo wants to go after everyone, not just gamers, and
3436018	3437480	I've seen it in the workplace.
3437620	3449410	I've seen people that are not your typical types of gamers, you know, mothers and folks that you don't typically think of as gamers bring in their Sudoku magazines and they'll play Sudoku on break.
3450110	3453113	It is a really good exercise for the brain, the whole brain training thing.
3453593	3456916	So I can see why this is justified in Nintendo's eyes, but you know,
3458171	3459172	I'm just saying, come on.
3460533	3462455	Why give us this out there and not Mother 3?
3462515	3462935	I don't get it.
3463276	3465358	I still think Nintendo's going to announce it later.
3465758	3468220	I think there's going to be another Nintendo press conference.
3468240	3473125	I mean, there has to be because they're going to announce all the Wii stuff and I think they're going to drop some of these bombshells too.
3475047	3477789	So I'm still hopeful Mother 3's coming to the US.
3478450	3479651	But what do I know?
3481272	3481593	I don't know.
3481613	3482053	What do you know?
3482674	3482994	Not much.
3484312	3485373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3504301	3523566	We have Cossacks 2 Battle for Europe, Jill Dozer for the GBA, Hitman Blood Money for a whole bunch of stuff, Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis, Rush for Berlin on PC, Super Princess Peach on the DS, About Damn Time, it's the PMS game.
3524146	3527847	Yeah, if you want to control an overly emotional woman, have fun with Super Princess Peach.
3527967	3529327	Don't you know you can't ever do that?
3532128	3532968	Of course you can't.
3534207	3537508	Thanks to the wonder of technology of video games, now you can.
3538809	3539449	So you think.
3539769	3540389	Heart, love ya.
3541950	3543771	And since this is the only other one on here, I'll go ahead and say it.
3543831	3545951	On the 31st, Talk Man on PSP is coming out.
3546472	3546712	Alright.
3547435	3548455	Heroes of Might and Magic 5
3571437	3574820	I know a lot of people like my magic, so don't be knocking.
3601900	3605782	and then, of course, Rogue Trooper on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
3606042	3612024	And then my favorite for the week, Jaws Unleashed, where you get to play the shark and get to dismember divers.
3612044	3612564	Finally!
3612964	3614585	How long ago was that game supposed to come out?
3614825	3615585	A long time ago.
3615826	3617406	I don't care how cheesy this game is.
3617446	3620767	It's like Echo the Dolphin with rabies.
3620908	3621468	It's great.
3622760	3624081	It's like snakes on a plane.
3624221	3625181	What's the big deal with that movie?
3625201	3627702	Because it's snakes on a freaking plane.
3628042	3631383	So, you know, Jaws, the game, yeah, it might suck, but it's Jaws.
3631403	3633103	You get to be the shark.
3634784	3635944	You get to eat people.
3636104	3636845	That's cool.
3637905	3638785	You get to destroy boats.
3638885	3641106	It's Grand Theft Auto with fish.
3641166	3641806	Shark edition.
3643487	3644167	No, but anyways.
3644787	3645508	Shark is tasty.
3645588	3649689	And also SteamBot Chronicles is supposed to be coming out on PlayStation 2, which is eh.
3650560	3660348	I mean, after all, they've got a mech known as Bumpy Trots, which sounds like a real bad ass disease or something like that.
3660368	3661849	I don't know.
3661869	3666193	We've got to keep it moving because we've got a lot of stories and we're moving kind of slow tonight.
3666213	3666673	That's all right.
3666833	3668554	Lots of stuff to say since it's post E3 here.
3670768	3672068	Loki, was there any other release dates?
3672108	3672449	I'm sorry.
3672709	3673549	Nope.
3673669	3678730	Then Loki, tell us about a big name in the online community, Major Nelson.
3678770	3680691	He's got his own little podcast over there.
3680711	3681731	Oh, I'm sorry, blogcast.
3682411	3683932	They don't use the word podcast in Microsoft.
3683952	3684732	He's got a blogcast.
3685412	3686833	But what's he saying about the PlayStation 3?
3686893	3689473	He's saying that their online service is not going to be free.
3689834	3690754	And how does he know this?
3690874	3698336	Well, he's basically going off the slides that they had on during the press conference and when they were mentioning free things.
3699237	3728683	Matchmaking and online play were not mentioned I think he says so basically it's going to be an equivalent to Xbox Live's silver level of service right now so you know basically you get to talk to people you know and you do chat and stuff but you can't play games against them for free which you know I don't know I get into the whole thing where I get kind of frustrated with
3729654	3731274	Sony copying everybody anyways.
3731314	3740517	You know, if online play was free though, it would certainly help justify the price because they could say, hey, you're having to pay $50 extra on Xbox.
3741357	3744838	He is right when he says that stuff wasn't mentioned on the free service.
3744918	3752139	Free service stuff, video chat, latest info, friends list, ranking, account management, player profile, voice messaging, and text messaging.
3752679	3753800	I don't see gameplay on there.
3757177	3775808	Um, moving on, another interesting story on the PlayStation 3, some stealthy video at E3 was shot, and I guess one of those demo rooms for the media only, I guess we weren't cool enough to get invited, but Joystick was, or somebody that ratted to Joystick because they posted some videos on YouTube of the PlayStation 3 interface, and guess what?
3776209	3777910	It looks very similar to the PSP.
3778490	3779651	PS2 wasn't very interesting
3797711	3798291	I guess that's true.
3798391	3799572	Maybe simplicity is key.
3800072	3801772	I guess it makes a lot of sense when you think about it.
3802193	3806654	But what's interesting is that it really does kind of borrow from the PSP.
3806994	3822900	There's a user's menu where I guess you can sign on as different users, a web browser, which we brought up earlier, and apparently you're going to be able to do multi-windows or tabs or something like that in there as well, and also a friends list, and there'll be voice and video chatting and gaming if you wanted to do that as well.
3824619	3825060	Very interesting.
3825080	3828825	If you want to check that out, I'm sure you can find it on YouTube very quickly or it's in Joysticks Archives.
3828865	3829205	Check it out.
3831508	3832570	What do you guys think about the interface?
3833931	3836074	I think it's lazy like everything else that they do.
3836595	3836855	Really?
3837556	3837897	You know...
3839835	3845458	I was talking with my friends at work the other day and just basically ripping off... I'm a huge Sony fanboy.
3845498	3846458	I have a PlayStation.
3846678	3848039	You know, I had a PlayStation 2.
3848539	3849800	I have two PSPs.
3850300	3851921	I mean, so, you know, don't get me wrong.
3851961	3852961	I don't hate Sony.
3853081	3856002	I just, I don't like how they steal everybody's ideas, though.
3856182	3857643	It's like nothing is original for them.
3857663	3861505	And then they try to come out and, like, deny that they've ripped off these ideas.
3861545	3864326	I mean, look at the PlayStation 1, for example.
3864426	3868728	Okay, came out, doesn't have analog, doesn't have rumble features.
3869395	3870396	Nintendo 64 comes out.
3870856	3872398	Has analog, has rumble.
3872998	3873479	Oh, look!
3873719	3875480	Look, now we have the DualShock!
3875981	3876862	I mean, come on!
3877362	3877903	Retarded!
3877983	3880505	Okay, now they come out with their controller design.
3880805	3883407	Oh, by the way, look, now it has tilt features in it.
3883628	3884388	Oh, PlayStation 3.
3884769	3886430	Oh, now ours has tilt features in it.
3887011	3889733	And now it's copy Xbox Live, but not quite.
3890093	3892656	They can copy, but they can never get it quite right.
3892916	3894017	It's... I don't know.
3894978	3895258	Alright.
3896435	3900077	I'd be interested to see how things, you know, work out for them.
3900557	3903859	I'm kind of wary on their online service, because PlayStation 2's online sucked.
3904820	3905580	You know, to be honest.
3906721	3910643	At least it was online, unlike Mr. GameCube, who had one game.
3911983	3912224	Anyway.
3912244	3913124	First, you GameCube.
3913204	3913704	Paperweight.
3914004	3915225	Alright, moving on.
3915285	3915945	No, wait a minute, though.
3916006	3918067	PlayStation 3, paperweight.
3918127	3920448	Oh, okay, I thought you said GameCube, because I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute.
3920588	3920648	No.
3921460	3921860	DarkSakura.com
3945058	3948239	It's got a lot of attention in the past, but it hasn't gotten a lot of attention lately.
3948959	3952120	So I am talking about nothing other than Weebles Stuff.
3953221	3963304	W-E-E-B-L-S-Stuff.com Yes, it's the home of Badger, Badger, Badger, and Magical Trevor, and Kenya.
3965025	3970127	The most recent one is Crabs, which I find incredibly hilarious.
3970167	3970967	Do they have weak points?
3972839	3974700	Well, it's about a mouthful of crabs.
3974720	3980123	And there's lots of bleeding in it, which sort of makes me think of the whole YAY!
3980183	3982705	thing from Rejected.
3983786	3984926	Okay.
3985066	3990650	There also is the home of Weeble and Bob, which are like two eggs that go, and they're speaking.
3991430	3992891	And the last one was pretty funny.
3993391	3995152	So, go check them out.
3995953	3997934	And make sure that you look for the ninja one.
3998914	4001176	I don't know where it is, but the ninja one is somewhere on the site.
4004158	4004439	All right.
4005819	4006219	Do it now.
4006839	4007239	Right now.
4007319	4008120	Mouthful of Crabs.
4010641	4011961	Historically accurate, nonetheless.
4014402	4014982	Moving on.
4015782	4016783	Those jokes will never get over.
4016803	4017123	I'm sorry.
4018303	4019204	Let's talk some movies.
4019224	4022645	We've got a lot of movie and TV stuff, just a barrage of stuff.
4022685	4023485	Loki, start us off.
4023905	4026026	Okay, let's start off with a really bad idea.
4026326	4026886	Bad idea.
4027386	4031928	It's called... Jerry Rockhammer has just signed on to produce a movie called Game Boys.
4033723	4037144	No, it's not the true life story of the portable Nintendo system.
4037945	4057972	It's a sci-fi action movie that's basically, the story revolves around two 30-year-old video game junkies recruited by the Department of Homeland Security, which is a joke anyways, to lead a geeky army of gamers in a battle against creatures that have come to life from a video game they have mastered.
4058332	4059753	Sounds like an episode of X-Files to me.
4059773	4061574	I mean, because I think they cover that.
4065129	4071083	What I'm really surprised is that Homeland Security does not have a contingency plan for that type of scenario.
4071323	4072005	I mean, come on!
4075431	4078112	Going from a really bad idea to a really good idea.
4078872	4082233	Metal Gear Solid movie was confirmed at E3 in case you missed it.
4082513	4083974	Konami had a great parody.
4084014	4087795	They put out the show Maybe in response to the show Daily.
4088155	4099178	But something you don't want to miss in there, the show Maybe says, In a late-breaking surprise announcement, director Hideo Kojima revealed that his most famous creation, Metal Gear Solid, is getting the live-action treatment.
4099538	4103179	He already said hell no to Uebol, so don't worry about that.
4103459	4107521	But he did say, I've received many offers to adapt Metal Gear Solid.
4107781	4110722	It has taken a long time, but we have finally settled on an arrangement.
4111062	4114823	False facts aside, a movie project is underway.
4114923	4117904	I have finalized a Class A contract with a party in Hollywood.
4118284	4119765	But that's about all the details you get.
4119825	4123006	No directors, no stars, no dates.
4123885	4124845	Paul Sams, Blizzard
4153328	4153909	Dungeons & Dragons
4180854	4189317	Apparently, the group that they're working with is called Legendary, and they want to basically make this really big budget movie.
4191398	4193099	I've never heard of Legendary, ever.
4193419	4197041	You know, when I think of big blockbuster movies, I don't think, hmm, Legendary.
4197161	4197301	No.
4197861	4200202	So, who the hell is Legendary?
4200602	4201803	You know, I've never heard of them.
4202483	4204504	I don't really, I follow games, not movies.
4205824	4207445	You know, and I should really be following movies.
4207505	4209526	After all, I do work at a goddamn movie distributor.
4209606	4209946	Good job.
4210638	4213119	So, I don't know.
4213139	4214040	Hopefully it doesn't suck.
4215040	4220864	Oh, I guess it's going to be Warner is working with them.
4220904	4221984	Now, Warner I've heard of.
4222965	4223605	So there you have it.
4224546	4226787	Actually, I think I have heard of Legendary, come to think of it.
4226907	4230329	I think I've seen that little animation at the beginning.
4230389	4231449	I'm sure they've done good stuff.
4232310	4234311	When you think about movies, you think DreamWorks.
4234331	4236412	You don't think of the small company that put it out.
4236432	4236792	Just, you know...
4239082	4241883	But it's not like big movie studios haven't put out stinkers before.
4243283	4243863	Exactly.
4245663	4249824	This isn't quite a movie, but DarkSakura, an interesting idea nonetheless.
4250424	4259145	They're planning on doing an Animal Crossing, as it is in Japan, Dobutsu no Mori animated movie in Japan in December.
4260006	4260866	To be out in December.
4261286	4262146	Very cool.
4262726	4264006	I'm guessing it's not live action.
4264967	4265887	That's why I said animated.
4265987	4266407	Oh, I'm sorry.
4267267	4267767	Missed that part.
4269498	4275900	There's no real information about if it's actually going to have a plot, because really the game has no plot.
4276280	4277821	You paid off your house drama.
4277841	4284423	Well, I would hope a movie would have a plot, but is the plot going to be you run around the village and run errands and deliver mail?
4284563	4285303	There's got to be something.
4285363	4291425	I think it's going to be, oh, tragedy has hit your forest, and blah, blah, band together, save, blah, blah, blah.
4291625	4294246	The man is trying to bulldoze Animal Forest, you know?
4295306	4297887	Because Animal Forest, right, is the translation in Japan, right?
4298207	4298407	Right.
4299411	4307073	I think that the Japanese DS one was called Aedeo Doubutsu no Mori, I think it was.
4307093	4308374	I have to think.
4310174	4320457	But at any rate, the director for the movie will be Shimura Joji, who worked on Master Keaton and Shin Angyou Onshi.
4320897	4323998	Sorry, I'm all tongue-tied today because I'm all bleh.
4324078	4327459	But Nintendo's talked before, though, that they want to get in the animation business.
4329251	4348312	I think the Animal Crossing is going to be a really good way for them to bring that goal together because it was actually stated by the former president of Nintendo, Yamauchi Hiroshi, stating that they were trying to put funds together to create an animated film project.
4348352	4349914	So maybe that's this in particular.
4352247	4352868	That's great.
4353188	4356231	Spirit Snare in our chat room says, what did he say?
4357091	4359453	Animal Crossing live action would be a WTF.
4359513	4361055	It would be more like furry crossing.
4362156	4362976	Ew.
4363637	4364398	They do a claymation.
4364963	4369325	All right, and here you go, Loki, and this would explain where I've seen the legendary pictures before.
4369625	4376728	GK128 posted a little linky in our chat room to the profile on Internet Movie Database, and here you go.
4376948	4379910	They did Batman Begins and Superman Returns.
4380130	4381971	Okay, well... You want to take back what you said before?
4382131	4382931	That's a little bit better.
4382971	4383792	All right, there you go.
4384392	4387853	So if you were in the midst of writing an angry email to Loki, we got it cleared up.
4388454	4390195	Okay, legendary pictures, okay by us now.
4390395	4391675	Yeah, they get to make a thumbs up.
4391795	4392335	Loki's bad.
4392976	4393236	All right.
4394178	4396101	Like I said, see, you think Warner though.
4396181	4399665	Warner and DC, you don't think legendary when you hear of those films.
4399746	4400146	Alright.
4400907	4401168	Whatever.
4402229	4403631	Try to defend yourself best you can.
4404051	4404332	Alright.
4405723	4406463	Just giving you a hard time.
4407864	4408244	Loki.
4408344	4414085	Now, this isn't about a game turning into a TV show, but it's about games showing up on a TV show, yes?
4414345	4414645	Yes.
4415206	4417266	A show that I am not watching this year.
4417666	4418166	Me neither.
4419667	4420467	It makes it a little tough.
4420887	4434911	But apparently on The Apprentice last week, they did a kind of a competition to design the best Xbox 360 display in Walmart.
4435627	4437948	and from what I hear, both of them sucked really, really bad.
4438948	4448231	From what I read on the internet, one team didn't finish in time and they were missing something that held their tent up so it was like falling over and they won anyway because the other one was so freaking bad.
4448631	4454113	But the review team apparently recognized what they were trying to go for and liked it better.
4454973	4460955	One thing I want to point out though, some folks were saying, oh, this is why Jay Allard wasn't at E3 because he showed up in this week's Apprentice.
4461715	4463955	These Apprentice things are taped long in advance.
4464216	4464976	About a month ago.
4465356	4466616	Actually longer than that.
4466696	4468697	This season of The Apprentice was taped in November.
4469037	4472518	So these boosts that they were designing were for the launch, most likely.
4472958	4476399	So it has nothing to do with why he was or wasn't at E3.
4476419	4478219	I just want to point that out because some folks are forgetting that.
4479980	4482720	Like Survivor, all that crap is taped long in advance.
4482740	4484281	Yay.
4485263	4494510	So, well, apparently, you know, whatever the case may be, the winner, I guess, their displays were displayed in 1,500 Walmart stores.
4494970	4500374	So, I haven't seen a 360 display in, you know, Walmarts.
4500994	4502555	So, I don't know.
4503276	4504036	Were they that bad?
4504116	4504777	Apparently so.
4506809	4511130	Alright, one more story for this part of the show, and then we're going to go to a little break.
4511670	4514511	And this has to do with the Booth Boys of E3.
4514551	4523314	Now you hear a lot about Booth Babes, but with Booth Babes essentially getting, you know, forcing to tone down a little bit this year, and now we have news on Booth Boys.
4523934	4527555	And this comes from a blog called Wonderland is the name of the blog.
4528215	4534277	The author here wrote down their list of the top boys of E3, and in the list here they have
4534937	4537859	Peter in the Namco booth, who has a little pack head there.
4539180	4542622	Brian from Brothers in Arms there, ready for action, a little military guy there.
4543502	4544503	Let's see who else is in here.
4544703	4546684	Another, just a couple of Webzen folks there.
4547204	4549846	The Poker Dealer over there.
4550907	4553008	Martin Lung, the video game pianist.
4553928	4554909	I actually got a video of him.
4555269	4556750	Yeah, he was a very talented guy.
4556770	4557690	I got to meet him.
4557710	4559592	He actually blindfolded himself with someone's t-shirt.
4561877	4569527	Fatality, who had his own booth this year, and taking the show though, the number one booth guy according to this blog, Adam West.
4572028	4580455	Now, what I thought was interesting is that there was another website who ran a story on booth guys, and they distinctly showed a picture of the guy at Nokia's booth.
4580775	4587901	Because I guess amongst all those girls in the white t-shirts and stuff, there was actually a guy who was a pretty good-looking guy that was there at the booth.
4587942	4588942	I remember we saw him.
4589603	4590664	I don't remember seeing him.
4591004	4591965	Or someone mentioned him.
4592245	4594727	I think Miklatov mentioned him.
4594967	4596128	Probably, probably.
4597153	4599174	Leave it to him to point out something like that, definitely.
4599514	4602036	But no, I totally missed it.
4602756	4609840	My thought was when I first saw it, maybe he was there to... He just worked for the company and just happened to be pretty good looking.
4610160	4612221	But maybe he was in there amongst all the women.
4612241	4612521	I don't know.
4612561	4620265	I didn't spend time in Engage's booth except to walk through it to get around the masses of people watching the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer at Konami.
4620465	4620905	Exactly.
4621286	4625588	Plus they have that mist coming down, so if you're hot, you're just like, ah, mist.
4625948	4632311	You know they have those Namco hats at the Namco store?
4632391	4633131	The Pac-Man hats.
4633592	4634472	I want one for my birthday.
4634492	4634932	You can buy them.
4635012	4635873	I want one for my birthday.
4635953	4636453	They're $30.
4637414	4638234	I want one for my birthday.
4638314	4638674	We'll see.
4638934	4639214	Alright.
4639835	4640655	I want a giant puka.
4641075	4643596	Alright, that's going to do it for this half of the show.
4643717	4654982	We'll be back in a little bit with Part B, which will include news about Final Fantasy VII Remake, more PlayStation 3 news, and much, much more right after this.
