00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,080
Now the conclusion of this weekís episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,520
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,520
Weíve had a pretty exciting episode so far.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,640
In case you missed the first half of the episode, go download it on the podcast stream and hear

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,040
why October 18th we believe to be the Wii's release date, some pretty compelling evidence

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,680
there, so check out part A. But meanwhile, let's get right into the news here in our

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,520
part B segment.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
First off though, actually a programming note, I want to point out there will be no live

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,280
program next week because we're actually taping our show for the first time in front of a

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,580
live studio audience.

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,360
And yeah, you could say the E3 Outpost was a live studio audience, but this is kind of

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
a different element.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,560
We're actually going to be taping our show live at an anime convention.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,440
It's going to be at Faname, which is this huge anime expo in Northern California.

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,480
And Loki, where is this happening at?

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
San Jose.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,040
This is a huge anime expo.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
That was funny.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
Oh, not that.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
Not that.

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,040
Not...

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
You know what I mean.

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
I know what you mean.

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,280
Okay, it's something far superior to anime expo.

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Whatever, whatever.

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,580
It is a convention that is happening that we're going to be at and doing our show live

31
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,440
Saturday, 7 o'clock, panel room one.

32
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,660
sure you bathe. Dark soccer will be there with Febreze. I will be there with Febreze

33
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:38,640
and Deodorant. I will also be cosplaying. We're also doing a panel Sunday at 7 about

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,260
podcasting but it's not the show being taped. We hope you come out to that anyway but that's

35
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,000
not actually our show being taped. That's us talking about how to be podcasting superstars.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,080
We should record it anyways. Well, we might. I don't know. It can be a bonus thing for

37
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,120
the Live Journal or the MySpacers, maybe.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,540
But, yeah, Saturday is the show, live.

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,840
So the podcast feed will still have a show,

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,680
but it's gonna be a really weird show.

41
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,980
I'm warning you in advance.

42
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,480
I have no idea what to expect

43
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,760
when we throw a live audience into it,

44
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,160
because we might get the, you know,

45
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,840
it's just like when the people listen at home

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,100
and then go, these guys suck.

47
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,520
We're gonna get it, like, live.

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,800
You suck!

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,760
So it's gonna be very interesting.

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,880
Just remember, even if you think we suck,

51
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,700
we do this for free, and we don't get paid to do it,

52
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,160
like some of those guys over at

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,360
of the bigger websites you know so um just keep that in mind jerk all right we put as much effort

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:36,160
into it as we get paid all right low-key getting into the news uh playstation 3 yes oh playstation

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:45,520
3 what is wrong with you seriously can we start no but anyways um the big gripe with everyone

56
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,880
in Playstation 3 is what games are going to be at launch and well, that's a good question

57
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,360
because we don't really know.

58
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,560
There's a lot of titles missing.

59
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:05,880
For example, the CEO David Reeves of Sonic Fair Entertainment Europe mentioned that quite

60
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,280
a few titles won't be making their launch date on November 17th.

61
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,500
And here's basically the status kind of running down things of certain titles that they definitely

62
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,860
showed at E3. First one, Sing Star. Certainly before Christmas, but it doesn't really say

63
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:28,180
at launch. An Itoy game will be available after Christmas. Itoy is not playable at the

64
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:35,180
moment, but it will come before March 2007. Oh, that's good. Sooner than ever. Heavenly

65
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,900
Sword Formula One Motorstorm will not come out until after Christmas. Resistance Fall

66
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,020
a Man will certainly be the launch title. I'm glad one of those is actually going to

67
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:54,020
be available. Um, so, you know, which 15 launch titles are supposed to be there? Who knows.

68
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:02,300
But um, well I know a couple of them but yeah. Oh do you? I'm not sharing that. Well, for

69
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,680
example, one of them that actually most websites have been mentioning, Fear is going to be

70
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
on the PlayStation 3 at launch. How do you know this?

71
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,920
Because we have it in our system.

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,920
It's gonna be launched day and date with the 360. Interesting.

73
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,420
That's a pretty bold announcement there. Nobody else has mentioned that.

74
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,880
Warhawk was another one I know that's gonna be launched.

75
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,080
There's a bunch of other ones. Are you sure, Fear?

76
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,040
Yeah. Wow. We have a listing for PlayStation 3. Wasn't Xbox 360 that supposed to be like their niche

77
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,120
thing? I don't know. They announced it for the 360 and never said it was exclusive to the 360.

78
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,360
But your systems contradict that? Yep.

79
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,160
Alright. We have it for, we actually have it for the PlayStation 3 and the 360, so.

80
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,640
Yeah. Alright. Sorry, no Wii version of fear out there.

81
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,880
Alright.

82
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,800
Moving on, also about the PlayStation 3, a lot of people kinda mad

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,200
about the lack of a rumble feature.

84
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,560
Now Sony is saying that they didnít want to do it because it interferes with the whole

85
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,480
tilt thing but I think a lot of us are looking at that and going ìWhat about the lawsuit?î

86
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,000
This is what is interesting, Immersion who is the company who is involved in this lawsuit

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,840
says ìI donít believe itís a very difficult problem to solveî referring to the shocking

88
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,380
getting in the way of the tilt sensory and Immersion is experts that would be happy to

89
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,660
to solve that problem for them.

90
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,380
But in exchange, Sony is going to have

91
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,700
to drop its current appeal against the 2004 lawsuit.

92
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,100
So that is a very interesting exchange.

93
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,260
Like, sure, we'll get you rumble if you pay us a lot of money.

94
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,780
It's OK.

95
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,260
All they'll do is they'll add the rumble feature

96
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,940
to controllers later on after they've

97
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,700
disassembled the Wii controller to see how it works.

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,980
What do you think?

99
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,340
Is this something that Sony ought to be looking into?

100
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,340
I think so. I think their system needs all the help it can get.

101
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,340
Alright.

102
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,340
I would like to see them do the, uh, rumble as well.

103
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,340
Personally, if I had to choose, you know, rumble or tilt, I'd choose rumble, because the tilt function sucked.

104
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,340
I haven't seen anything that really sells me on the tilt function. Sure, there was Warhawk, but not enough for me.

105
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,340
So, show me why I need tilt, and maybe I'll say that.

106
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
Yeah.

107
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,340
Alright.

108
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,340
I can get tilt already at home.

109
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,340
Oh, with the pinball machine?

110
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,340
With the pinball machine.

111
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,340
Well, that's a little different.

112
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,340
You know what?

113
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,600
I prefer that kind of tilt to Sony's tilt, so...

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,460
Maybe they just haven't put it in the right game yet.

115
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,460
We'll see, though.

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,460
We'll see.

117
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,460
Uh, Loki!

118
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,460
Developers!

119
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,700
Getting frustrated, because they haven't received PS3 dev kits yet.

120
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:48,580
In fact, some of the major ones, THQ and Sega, just haven't gotten dev kits.

121
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:55,940
THQ boss Brian Farrell reportedly said that his company had killed the work on Sopranos

122
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,080
for the PlayStation 3 because it was too risky at the moment since they don't have a dev

123
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,720
kit.

124
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,800
So that's kind of important if you want games to be included with your $600 system that's

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,820
coming out in the fall.

126
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,420
Which hopefully it's coming out in the fall because they said, oh yeah we're launching

127
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
in the fall.

128
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,340
Or we're launching November 17th or whatever.

129
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:23,300
I remember when they said they were launching back in spring, so yeah, it's not looking

130
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
good.

131
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Interesting.

132
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:32,300
Loki, we're going to go ahead and go back to you for another story about the Final Fantasy

133
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,260
VII remake that was rumored last E3.

134
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,260
What's going on with this?

135
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,500
Well, according to EGM, they're saying yes, it is.

136
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,820
Actually in their latest edition of the magazine, which I think was actually on the show floor

137
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:52,780
It says, last year Square Enix teased everyone with what it called the Final Fantasy 7 PS3

138
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,780
tech demo.

139
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,100
Well, what do you know?

140
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,140
This test case was really a sneak peek at the next-gen revival of the PlayStation 1

141
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,960
role-playing hit.

142
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,700
Is it actually coming out?

143
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,980
Eh, maybe.

144
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,940
So you know, just because the magazine says so, who knows.

145
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,380
Okay, interesting.

146
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,380
I think a lot.

147
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,460
Well, it would make sense with all the Final Fantasy 7 love that Square has been given

148
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,460
lately.

149
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,380
sense yeah so and you know there was a whole I heard a friend of a friend thing

150
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,900
a while back that said it was happening but you know take that with a grain of

151
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,460
salt but here's another interesting one this isn't from a friend but a well you

152
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,380
know someone I would call this person a friend but a listener of our station

153
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,740
tipped me off on something which I think is very interesting and this was

154
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,860
overheard by people that would know what they're talking about from Nintendo and

155
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:47,720
Basically, Nintendo is trying to secure the rights to remake Final Fantasy 7 for a portable

156
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,080
console in the near future.

157
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Take it with a grain of salt, but this was overheard by a listener of ours from people

158
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,200
that would know what they're talking about, that Final Fantasy 7 is coming to a portable

159
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,060
console, and this is Nintendo, so obviously it's the DS or some other crazy thing they

160
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,080
might have in the works, but I'm pretty sure it's the DS.

161
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,440
So again, take it with a grain of salt, but when I think about it, it makes a lot of sense

162
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,800
that Final Fantasy VII would come out on the DS, right?

163
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Yeah.

164
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,880
Well, there's also the fact that basically since the DS is a glorified Nintendo 64, they

165
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,200
had Final Fantasy VI characters as a demo for what would have been Final Fantasy VII

166
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,140
back on the Nintendo 64 until they went to Sony instead.

167
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,140
So, basically, they've even had work on this before, technically.

168
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,140
That's a very interesting point. It wouldn't be too hard to, I guess, make it happen.

169
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,140
People think, oh, CD to cartridge. I don't know.

170
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Not at all. I think that it would be in their best interest to remake it.

171
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,140
Especially after seeing Final Fantasy III at E3. Final Fantasy III is in a very similar graphical style.

172
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,140
In fact, a little better than Final Fantasy VII. I could totally see it happening.

173
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,620
And let's not also forget that Squeenix is on a currently Final Fantasy, you know binge right now

174
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,980
Saturating us with Final Fantasy 7 everything what an interesting retort from Nintendo though

175
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,020
If that happened because Sony has been really selling, you know

176
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,940
The PSP you can download the PlayStation 1 game and the game that everyone asks about can I play Final Fantasy 7 on it?

177
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,740
They're not asking about Ridge Racer

178
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,300
They're asking about Final Fantasy 7 will I be able to play Final Fantasy 7 on the PSP?

179
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,700
and of course the answer is yes but what a great response from Nintendo to be

180
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,140
able to play Final Fantasy 7 on the DS but again guys you know you have to take a

181
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,860
little bit of grain of salt right now but just don't be surprised if it actually

182
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:50,060
happens very very interesting alright moving on there is an HDMI cable coming

183
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:56,280
the Xbox 360 and Lixang is supposedly offering that you can put your name on a

184
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,120
list to be one of the first ones to get this cable when it does come out so

185
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,920
Lixang has taken pre-orders to this HDMI cable so people are kind of jumping to

186
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,360
conclusions there that means one is on in the way and it would make sense

187
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,920
Microsoft likes to do that if their competition does something they'll do it

188
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,800
as well they'll release an upgrade or something they've built that 360 to be

189
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,440
pretty quickly upgradeable so I could totally see this happening I don't know

190
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,800
why it didn't happen at launch but whatever it's coming and especially if

191
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,120
there's an HD DVD player in the works and this whole discussion about 1080p is

192
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,320
the true HD I think don't make a lot of sense for that HD DVD player to come out

193
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,960
as well as an HDMI cable I think that would be a good way to answer Sony's

194
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,960
blu-ray you know is the true HD or whatever

195
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,000
yeah moving on

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,140
Loki. Yes. What else on the 360?

197
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,540
Um, other things on the 360, well

198
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,800
Devil May Cry. Um, actually

199
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,220
they're saying that Devil May Cry 4 might not be

200
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,960
exclusive to the PS3, but may date

201
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,120
be on the 360 and Revolution as well.

202
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,480
You mean the Wii? Whatever, the Wii.

203
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,560
Um, it's according to, um, the latest issue of

204
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:18,780
They basically feature an interview with Hiroshi Kobayashi, the producer of the Devil May Cry

205
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,960
series.

206
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,960
So interesting.

207
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
But that's not all.

208
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
No, no.

209
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition may be coming to Xbox 360 as well.

210
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,480
According to Planet Xbox 360, and they don't really give a source on it, but they say that

211
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:45,160
It's coming to the 360 in the PAL territories, so they mention September as the launch date

212
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
for that.

213
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,360
That'd be interesting, but a rumor for now.

214
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,660
Lots of Devil May Cry love on the 360.

215
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
Good deal.

216
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,140
I'm going over to the chat room over at www.orangehonesty.com, click on chat.

217
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,840
There's a lot of feedback there to what we were saying earlier about the Final Fantasy

218
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
VII remakes.

219
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,060
DJ Pooh Eater says, how many times can I watch Eris die?

220
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,640
Stop pulling my heart out, you bastard Squeenix.

221
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,400
I can't watch it enough. I have my game saved where she dies

222
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,960
so that I can watch her die over and over. Will you do that on the PSP version and the

223
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,960
PS3 remake and the DS version? Hell yeah!

224
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,200
Alright. I hate Aerith!

225
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,680
You should set it up so that you have it all play at once on all the different...

226
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,240
I hate, hate, hate, hate her. The question is how are they going to

227
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,600
fit all that on a cartridge? Those DS cartridges are pretty big and

228
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,360
I could see it happening.

229
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,120
I think somebody made a joke.

230
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,880
I think Bobby said something, BlackWolf in the chatroom said something about they could

231
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,000
put Final Fantasy 7 on three carts.

232
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,480
And the third cartridge is nothing but the ending.

233
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,520
Rini was saying in response to me saying everybody's asking for Final Fantasy 7, he's saying I'm

234
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,240
asking for Intelligent Cube.

235
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,120
Good call, good call.

236
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,460
Moving on with topics.

237
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,480
There's a brand new add-on coming to Oblivion.

238
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,960
This has really been an ever-expanding game.

239
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,840
The latest one, according to a Bethesda developer, is basically Goonies.

240
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,740
What happens in this mission is that you will take control of a cavernous lair that has

241
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,380
a pirate ship in it, and then once you get the pirate ship, you get to go loot things.

242
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,680
It's just like the Goonies, because remember they had the pirate ship in the cave?

243
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Get this.

244
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,040
doesn't interest you but that's just supposedly working on an additional six

245
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,240
to seven add-ons including an epic dungeon and they want to release this

246
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,520
stuff every three to four weeks that's the smartest way to keep your game going

247
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,880
honestly that's a great tactic oblivion a very impressive game one I need to

248
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,360
play more of but I can't tear myself away from that other RPG I keep playing

249
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,040
over and over I think oblivion be better if I had co-op over live yeah but then

250
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,980
it's an MMO in a way in a way necessarily all right anyway it's been

251
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,620
a little while since we've been able to take a look inside our old mail bag of a

252
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,500
dark Sakura hasn't forgotten about you guys who email us every week at mailbag

253
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,180
at orange lounge radio.com so we've got a little bit of a backlog tonight so we

254
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,120
want to let dark Sakura get to it and check the mailbag so dark Sakura put on

255
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:25,120
your hazmat suit and your rubber gloves and dig on into the mailbag.

256
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,240
This week is actually asbestos. Yeah, I'm gonna die.

257
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,760
What are we getting flames this week? No. No, I was just saying.

258
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Jeremy Todd emailed us and basically he wanted to state, and we've actually been talking

259
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:52,040
talking about this back and forth about um saying that the Wii controller and the uh

260
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,280
uh playstation 3 controller is well let me just start over let me just start over reading

261
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:04,240
this that's right i'm tired okay i just want to address to many people that the ps3 isn't

262
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,240
like the Wii controller since many of the people who watch the sony conference probably

263
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,040
got this impression the Wii controller can sense 3d space but the ps3 controller cannot

264
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:20,540
Now, we had discussed this, and basically, to go ahead and point this out, for everybody else who has this misconception, they are almost the same.

265
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:38,040
The tilt is a gyroscope, the connection to the TV is infrared, not 3D space, it's infrared, it's just sensitivity the closer and further away you get it, and it connects to the Wii by Bluetooth.

266
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
So, basically...

267
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,240
I remember when Bobby was talking about this, though, accelerometers is a big part of the

268
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Wii thing, too, though, that not every game uses infrared, some use just the accelerometers

269
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,080
and some use just the infrared, so it just kind of depends on the game you're playing.

270
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:03,580
But it's really not all that, you know, fantastic, they just took actually very simple technology

271
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,000
and used it in a complex way, how I see it.

272
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay.

273
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So yeah, um

274
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,040
Now this was um, our good friend Rob linked me to another

275
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,480
editorial at a pointless waste of time and

276
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,440
For anyone who wants to read it because I'm not going to go into the whole thing

277
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,220
It's at pointless waste of time comm slash games slash crashed at HTML

278
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,900
it's life after the video game crash post e3 2006 edition by

279
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,260
Personing David Wong is very interesting article

280
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,600
But the thing that I thought was great that he pointed out in this article is actually

281
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,260
right up at the beginning.

282
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,060
I'm going to read these two paragraphs on here.

283
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,060
It says, Who am I?

284
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,260
I am the creator of a certain video game console.

285
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,460
I don't want to toot my own horn, but let's just say the profits of this machine were

286
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,620
four billion dollars higher than the Microsoft Xbox.

287
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,920
My console consisted of a plastic milk crate with a kitten placed inside.

288
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,540
The controller was a wooden rod that could be used to poke the kitten.

289
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,900
I sold zero of these consoles, which cost me zero to manufacture.

290
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,380
Therefore my profits were zero.

291
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,000
The Xbox however lost 4 billion dollars.

292
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,860
I want to buy the poke the kitten console, that sounds like fun.

293
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,620
I need to poke the rabbit console instead.

294
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:20,760
And actually there is a link on this to an article at Joystiq about just how much they've

295
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,460
kept losing over the Xbox.

296
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:32,080
But it's pretty much going into a lot more detail about basically why the video game

297
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,800
industry is going to crash especially with the release of the ps3 and Sony is

298
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:43,000
basically planning to take a 400 $500 loss on every single ps3 they sell you

299
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,720
know maybe in a few years I'll start making money on it but this the first

300
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,120
thing that it brings up that I just think is the probably the most apt

301
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,920
comparison here it's like why does the industry have to crush it all the movie

302
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,880
industry is still around you know over a century later but it's been proven with

303
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,100
Especially with the Atari 2600 that you can have a system for a few years, but after a while you'll stop playing it

304
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,840
You know, they're saying that when they released

305
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,460
ET you know in 1983 ET was supposed to be Atari's biggest market

306
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,080
you know biggest game to hit the market and

307
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,340
They you know, it's about six million of them stayed on shelves then again, the game was pretty wretched

308
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:32,940
But even so, it was just that people weren't playing their 2600s by 1983, that it had just

309
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,500
been nothing new was out.

310
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
People got tired of it.

311
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,100
It was an old toy.

312
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,900
I think that that's a very, very good comparison right there, and it's why, you know, how many

313
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,900
were all up all over it when they got their GameCube, you know?

314
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,100
How many of you are still playing it?

315
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
When was the last time you played your GameCube, Rob?

316
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,100
A while ago.

317
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,100
I'll be honest.

318
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
It was a while ago.

319
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,660
But that's because there hasn't been any games that have come out lately that have

320
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,380
maybe go wow and I haven't had a good nerd party lately where people cuz like

321
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,420
that was pretty much where my game was getting the most use people come over we

322
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,960
play F-Zero we play Smash Bros. we play Mario Party it's it's the greatest party

323
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,500
console ever. Okay what's the oldest system that you own right now? That still

324
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,700
works? Probably my Super Nintendo. When was last time you touched it? Oh it's in

325
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,260
a box it's it's because I don't need to I can emulate it but I emulated a Super

326
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:28,060
Nintendo game last week so I but I want to pull your system out and play it so

327
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,700
ages ago probably in college okay if you didn't have an emulator would you pull

328
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:39,180
out your SNES and play it I'm gonna be honest probably I think but not like on

329
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,300
a regular basis it would be one of those things was like dude remember Super

330
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,380
Metroid fuck yeah let's play you know it would be because that's what emulators

331
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,580
every day no no no play it for a little bit and then you just put it away yes

332
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,860
You know, and, and Dan and I own all these systems, but honestly, the last time we touched

333
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,700
our Herbografx was like, you know, a few months ago.

334
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,940
We have, I haven't touched my own Super Nintendo that I moved out here with in a year.

335
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,900
And except like when I moved it, when we moved into our house.

336
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,620
So yeah, you keep it around and you know, the novel aspect is there, yeah, I'm gonna

337
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:17,020
go play my Nintendo, but are you gonna have it hooked up as your primary system?

338
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,020
Hell no.

339
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,640
If it was the only thing you owned, would you still have found other things to do

340
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,460
after three years had passed?

341
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,140
It would really depend on my scenario, see, but on the other hand if I

342
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,340
didn't have the money to afford

343
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,640
a new console and I could go to a garage sale or the flea market and buy Super

344
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,560
Nintendo games for like two bucks a pop,

345
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,820
I'd get a lot more life out of it. But would you still

346
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,140
play it more often if you could like go out and do stuff instead?

347
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,780
It's hard to say, because I'm not in that situation.

348
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,360
Well, that's just the point of view I'm trying to point out, you know.

349
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,860
Understandable.

350
00:21:51,860 --> 00:22:00,420
I had, you know, my Super Nintendo, I had for years, and after a couple of years, even though, you know, I was still a big gamer, I still love to play my Super Nintendo,

351
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,780
I put more attention toward other things.

352
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:11,340
You know, that's just how I was with it, even though I loved to death, and I'd go through and have my, you know, massive three-hour games of Kirby's Avalanche, you know.

353
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,540
I think that's a pretty good, you know,

354
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,500
I thought that was a pretty neat point to bring up.

355
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,860
23rd Magus in our chat room, by the way, would like to point out that

356
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,220
your pet Shermie does not approve of the Poke the Kitten console.

357
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,260
I don't approve of the Poke the Kitten console. I totally approve.

358
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:34,020
The next point on this though, well see, it keeps bringing out though that, you know,

359
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,340
that yeah, you get it with slightly better graphics, but really

360
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,980
Aren't the games the same? I thought there was a funny comparison though of of

361
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,460
Jet goblins attack in 1980 and the Legend of Zelda in 1987. I'll show you

362
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,140
Hmm, okay. Yeah, you have orange box yellow box

363
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,200
And of course we all know it's a little looks like but it's you know

364
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,380
It's really going into a lot more of this article goes into how oh these systems are so great

365
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,760
But now you know you're getting just more of the same with everything released

366
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,460
There's no new innovation was actually why I think you know

367
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,780
I don't know if you noticed how much bigger the crowds were at Nintendo

368
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:21,620
Then they were for Microsoft and say and and Sony well a part of that

369
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,620
I blame on Nintendo's design though you could walk right into Sony's and play their console on Microsoft

370
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,700
I mean there's a whole variety and then you have the whole hype behind the Wii

371
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,660
I don't know if I can relate it to this see how much line they had anticipated getting at Sony

372
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,860
That's true. That's true. They got maybe a third of that

373
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,540
Well, here's the other thing too that all their consoles are playable at other booths

374
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:51,080
That's a good point too. You could you could walk into Sega and play full auto 2 and some the sonic game. So

375
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,620
That's a good point. I

376
00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:08,620
I would recommend giving this article a read. It's a very well written editorial. It goes a lot more into detail about supporting proof. It gives actual numbers. It gives actual information. I thought that was very, very smart.

377
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:20,620
So I would say definitely go take a look. Check it out dudes. And dudettes. But I did like the whole, you know, bringing up the comparison there.

378
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,620
Um, we got an email from

379
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,300
Jay Vez

380
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,980
Said a great show. I've been listening to you for about two months

381
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,500
You all always have good comments about the stuff going on in the gaming world. Just wanted to give you guys some positive feedback

382
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:38,660
Thank you. Appreciate it. We got we got another one from L driver

383
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
Cool. Yeah, um

384
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,420
Just wanted to give you a shout and let you know how awesome your e3 coverage was yours was my favorite and it was cool

385
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,260
to have you guys, All Games, Gamer Andy, and Bobby Blackwithall on the same, I'm sorry,

386
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:57,860
all on each other's shows. You should try to do that more often. Agreed. It was fun.

387
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,300
It was a brilliant idea from the All Games people to put us all under one roof. The only

388
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:06,540
unfortunate thing is that, again, you had Gamer Andy, who's based in the Bay, us, who's

389
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:12,200
based in Sacramento, Scott and Lawrence, who are based in LA, and Bobby, who's in Atlanta,

390
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,260
so it's, you know, that doesn't happen very often where everybody's in the same city,

391
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,280
except for something as massive as E3.

392
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,560
Maybe Game Developers Conference next year,

393
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,800
because I could see us going to that,

394
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,340
and probably at least, I know Bobby flew out this year,

395
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,020
so maybe something will happen again, but who knows?

396
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,520
And you know, oh, the guy from Chatterbox as well

397
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,860
was in Arizona, he was there for one of the shows too.

398
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,840
So, you know, it's not very often

399
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,800
everybody gets under one roof,

400
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,040
but we thought it was a good time.

401
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,880
And you know what I liked about it too,

402
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,880
was that there was no sense of competition.

403
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,920
You know, sure we had the joking chat,

404
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,960
oh, how many people you got listed,

405
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,140
of people you got listening and we kind of had that joke but there was you know

406
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,260
it was just kind of like we all realize that our shows are different because of

407
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,660
who hosts it and there's just different things that each show brings to the

408
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,980
table and you know we can all coexist people will you know gravitate to the

409
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,860
host that or hopefully multiple shows of the hosts that they you know seem to

410
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,540
reflect their personality or the complete opposite some people might

411
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,540
listen to us because what we say pisses them off I don't know I thought it was

412
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,260
was great though that we could have such different points of view. It was very nice to have new

413
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,780
people to bounce off of.

414
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:23,560
I think one of the reasons I like the whole All Games thing is because, take Scott, well

415
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,780
at least Scott for example, I think Lawrence plays a lot of the same games we do, but Scott

416
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,860
plays a lot of sports games and that type of thing, so he came on our E3 special on

417
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,180
Friday and was talking about Madden and sort of brought a perspective to it that I don't

418
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:39,660
think we could provide. And I think it's healthy for our listeners to sort of hear how or remember

419
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,800
that there's other types of gamers, you know what I mean?

420
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,740
I think that was the best thing that came of that is that you really heard from different

421
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
types of gamers.

422
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,580
I was all, I play super high impact.

423
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Mm-hmm.

424
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
That was it.

425
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
I know.

426
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,580
I know.

427
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
I'm a Tecmo ball for life.

428
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,820
The L driver has a question for us.

429
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
Sure.

430
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:01,020
My question is, who was the coolest industry person you met at the show or who were you

431
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,660
most excited about meeting or seeing?

432
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,520
I've heard people say nothing about, I'm sorry, say nothing about great things about Major

433
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,960
Nelson and Trixie and I think it's telling Microsoft that people like working for them.

434
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,520
I don't see that on the Sony side, just a thought.

435
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Do we meet anywhere?

436
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,360
Well, I know I saw Will Wright and he was cold.

437
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,040
I would say the, I'll let you share because I know which one you were excited, most excited

438
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
to meet.

439
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
I met two people.

440
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,760
Oh, the one at the very last day, the last minute, that's the one I met too.

441
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,440
My first one was meeting Koji Kondo on the first day and getting his autograph.

442
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
Oh, that's right.

443
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,960
was Rob took my photo with Igarashi Koji, who's the producer of the Castlevania games.

444
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,760
That's the one I met too that I thought was really exciting, but honestly, I gotta be

445
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,960
honest, nothing will beat Akira from two years ago, Kiryamoka. That was mine.

446
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,840
Hey, you make Koji Kondo.

447
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Alright.

448
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,160
Loki, did you meet any industry people?

449
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:05,280
No, but I wish I had met, I think it was like Steve Ododec or whatever that was there. I

450
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,800
I remember the guy that did Kung Pao, he was apparently walking around in E3.

451
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,600
So I was like, it was cool to meet him because I got to punch him in the face and say, make

452
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,720
god damn Kung Pao 2, because I need to see the movie now, get off your ass, stop wasting

453
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:26,080
your time with Barnyard and those other crappy animated movies, I want Kung Pao 2.

454
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,440
I got to be honest, I try not to be fanboy at E3 because it's supposed to be a professional

455
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,220
so I don't I don't run up to people and go OMG I'm your biggest fan but you know

456
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,840
in the case of you know the guy the Igarashi you know it's just kind of the

457
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,140
way we just kind of talked to him was like hey you know we wanted to actually

458
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,380
just tell them about our show and hope so we can get them on but you know and

459
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,940
you know take a picture while we're at it for the website why not fun we're

460
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,400
gonna cut out the part with me in it no stop um also I got an email we've been

461
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:04,420
picked for a podzinger podcast of the week yay podzinger yeah so everyone

462
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,880
should go to podzinger.com go check it out the other cool thing about podzinger

463
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,940
and one part of what sets them apart from other podcast search engines is

464
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:17,300
that they actually will break down what we say like it takes like it somehow

465
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,420
converts our mp3 into text like you can't actually read it but you if you do

466
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,520
search like you'll actually see podzinger try to read the sentence as we

467
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,040
spoke it it's really weird technology but it's cool so you can actually search

468
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,640
for words in podcasts so I think that's kind of neat so thank you podzinger

469
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,740
appreciate it our last one comes from Nintendo maniac 64 mm-hmm who has a

470
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,520
question for us mm-hmm so it was I was wondering if there was a way of taking

471
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,400
an AGP or PCI port out of the PC and hooking it up to a laptop via internally

472
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,280
are externally so that I could use a decent video card no idea Loki I have no

473
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:01,400
idea what pay attention fired sorry I was reading an AGP or PCI port out of a

474
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,960
PC and hook it up to a laptop for to use a better video card you're not gonna

475
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,520
probably be able to do that because laptops a lot of times they have PCI

476
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,280
Express well especially like the recent ones they have PCI Express cards and I'm

477
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,120
I'm not sure if there are their own versions of them.

478
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:26,880
Like my laptop right now has an ATI Mobility Radeon X600, so it's kind of a mobile version

479
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:35,740
of the Radeon X600, so you can't really do that just because also laptops are meant to

480
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,320
run on lower power than a PC.

481
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,960
So the power that a lot of cards, you know, freakin' draw, you're not going to be able

482
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,640
to put anything like that in your laptop and, I don't know, just, I don't know, if you really

483
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
want to...

484
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
My laptop is just fine.

485
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,680
You shouldn't really need a really high, super duper duper high end card, you know, just

486
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,160
buy a more expensive laptop I guess.

487
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:07,440
I mean, you can actually, you know, get some pretty up to date graphics cards right now,

488
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
Alienware does make a...

489
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
Alienware does make a...

490
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Well yeah, buy a Mac if you want good graphics.

491
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
Yeah, just get a Mac.

492
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Sorry, Loki. I know how you feel, but honestly...

493
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,440
Did you see the stuff for the new MacBook?

494
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
Isn't it hot?

495
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
I gotta take it back to gaming. We gotta keep it going.

496
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
MacBook Pro, man.

497
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,440
Well, if we're taking it back to gaming, then obviously Mac is the wrong way to go there.

498
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Shut up!

499
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,440
Oh, sorry, I dropped my mic.

500
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Oh, I've done to my computer, dammit.

501
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,440
Um, you know, uh...

502
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,440
I'll be playing World of Warcraft on my Mac.

503
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,440
on my Mac.

504
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,440
And I'll be playing Ragnarok online.

505
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,440
Alright, look, shut up.

506
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Alright, if you want to email us,

507
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
add to the mailbag for next week, yell at Loki for his

508
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,440
Mac hate. Mailbag at

509
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,440
orangelaunchradio.com is the address.

510
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,440
Moving on, I gotta mention this, because

511
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,440
we have a lot of folks who love

512
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,440
the music games, and by the way, we have

513
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,440
a video coming to the website tonight

514
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,440
of some of the new DDR games, so some of you

515
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,440
kids can see the interface, so check that out.

516
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,440
But Res! Hugely popular

517
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:08,440
game, Res Res Res, and in an interview with Eurogamer, the creator of Res, spoke

518
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:15,160
about the possibilities of a sequel to Res. Basically he says that he is

519
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,880
looking at the next generation possibilities and trying to do a Res

520
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,840
kind of experience. If Sega were to approach him to make a Res sequel, he is

521
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,600
currently seriously considering it. It's always there. I'm always thinking about

522
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,400
it. So it's kind of interesting thing about which system would it be on? Would

523
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,300
it be on like the Wii where you could move it around or would it be on like the

524
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,500
360 where you could do like updates or would it be on the PlayStation 3 which

525
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,140
is supposed to have the true high definition who knows who knows but I

526
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,540
believe rez was originally a Dreamcast game and just brought over to the

527
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,460
PlayStation 2 right that's right yeah that's exciting though I really hope

528
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,460
that happens and while we're at it how about more space channel 5 please thank

529
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,900
you Loki got some news on a pac-man pac-man

530
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:04,780
I ran a world rally and I did play this game and it's actually a complete rip off of Mario

531
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
Kart.

532
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:12,540
So anyways, Namco mentioned that all versions of their upcoming game on all the different

533
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:19,300
consoles will feature as an unlockable character the prince of all cosmos from the Katamari

534
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,540
series and how you unlock this character you may ask?

535
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:28,020
By winning the gold trophy and all the circuit cups with the easy difficulty setting which

536
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,740
Which makes me believe there's more characters.

537
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,420
Not a surprise at all though that the prince is hidden in there.

538
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,180
I mean they've got to milk the Katamari franchise if there's not going to be any games.

539
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,300
The heart difficulty you may ask?

540
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,020
Heart difficulty you get to drive as the king's package.

541
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
Shut up.

542
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,820
I think on the heart difficulty you should drive a Katamari and roll over everybody.

543
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,300
Now that would be fun.

544
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,720
You know that racing level in We Heart Katamari was like the best thing ever.

545
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,920
I love the racing level.

546
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,420
That and the fire level.

547
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:04,180
Sakura another sequel possibly in the works oh this makes my heart happy um

548
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:11,380
there was a bit of conversation heard at the Sony party

549
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:18,020
Yuji Naka apparently was basically on some I guess impromptu interview was

550
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:23,020
admitting that there's a new night's game in development cool it's about

551
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:30,000
freaking time just please don't let the control suck like Sonic's Sonic ps3 did

552
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Sonic ps3 just hurt my heart I know you know it got my it got my worst game of

553
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,360
e3 I know I'm not saying something did you because that Family Feud game was

554
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:49,160
god-awful all right I don't play suck games I think this is interesting is

555
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:55,160
that HAL is actually taking suggestions. They've actually put up a

556
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,920
consumer survey on Nintendo of Japan's website and the poll is designed to let

557
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,120
gamers help select what type of characters should be in the next Super

558
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,340
Smash Brothers. Of course fanboys everywhere wet their pants when they saw

559
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,360
that Pit and Snake were going to be in the next Super Smash Brothers. Is there a

560
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,700
character that you think should be in the next Super Smash Brothers? Well I

561
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,360
I hope you speak Japanese, but you can head on over to

562
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,820
Nintendo... I'm sorry, it's actually in Smashbrothers.com, they have the survey

563
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,340
there.

564
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:28,140
But hopefully Nintendo of America will be releasing a similar poll over here.

565
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,380
Any thoughts right off the top of your head, Nintendo characters or similar

566
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,500
you'd like to see

567
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,300
something that's actually feasible in Super Smash Brothers? I guess then again

568
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,060
none of us ever thought Snake would be in it, and sure enough

569
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,620
there he is.

570
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,980
I still haven't... we need Eggplant Wizard.

571
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,980
I think Eggplant Wizard would be pretty rockin' too.

572
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,980
Um, gosh, I'm really kinda stretched for ideas.

573
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
Mother brain playable.

574
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,980
You can play as a metri-

575
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,980
That's weird. Now, Kraid might- Kraid might be cool.

576
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Or like one of the baddies.

577
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
You can play as one- as a Metroid.

578
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,980
Hmm.

579
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,980
I don't know, that's- it seems like they've done a lot of good ones.

580
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,980
I guess, you know, I'm glad they're just going back to Kid Icarus, honestly.

581
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Um, but, I've heard- I've heard rumors, rumblings, that uh,

582
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,060
Final Fantasy characters are supposed to make an appearance as well, but again, that's that's like a big old grain of salt

583
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,320
I think that that sounds like more of a fanboy thing to me. I don't see

584
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,600
Well after all, I mean they did have to remix TV world fighters with all the Konami

585
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,140
characters in there including snake, so why not add some of those characters and

586
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,060
Which case they would have had?

587
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,220
Was it Simon Belmont?

588
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,780
Mm-hmm, and I remember

589
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,780
From like Hudson since now

590
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,480
Konami seems to publish all the Hudson games

591
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,060
Bomberman

592
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,060
they even had a

593
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,100
you go from

594
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,700
Was it

595
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,860
God, I can't remember the game now the crappy. Yeah

596
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,060
That's all right. I got I got a good Barbie or whatever. Yeah, I got to go over

597
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,380
I got to go to the chat room because they've seen some great stuff right now

598
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:09,540
Jeremy Todd one wants to point out you can always google trade translate the website good point and they're sharing some great ideas

599
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:17,260
Bobby Black Wolf says K.K. Slider could be a character, DMN says Little Mac, O2G says

600
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:27,220
King Hippo, that's a good idea, Spirit Snare says Reggie, and Renee, I love this idea,

601
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,020
a Tetris piece, that would be funny, and Spirit Snare, I mean why not, you have Mr. Game & Watch,

602
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:40,520
also suggests the dog from Duck Hunt okay who hasn't wanted to kick

603
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:46,840
that dog's ass okay I will but I but in the in the Smash Brothers can you

604
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,720
imagine playing the dog yeah I want to kick that thing's ass here are some of

605
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:57,000
the ones that they had from Dream Mix TV Twinbee yes they also had a moe

606
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:05,340
head from Gradius, which I thought was pretty interesting. Solid Snake, of course, was there.

607
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:11,880
They also had Simon Belmont. These are all Konami. Yeah, those were all Konami ones.

608
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:19,440
So I think it's pretty cool. Alright. Well, hell, we're opening up to Konami. How about

609
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,760
Goemon? Or maybe Pentaro. Alright. Moving on, DarkSakuro. What company's got a lot of

610
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,200
love for the Wii. A lot of people have a lot of love for the Wii, but who else has love

611
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:38,200
for the Wii? SNK! Who I have a lot of love for. Well, basically it was confirmed by SNK

612
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:45,320
USA's president that they are going to try to get stuff out on the Wii. They were saying

613
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:54,600
they have a game for the Wii already in progress. Basically they're saying they think Sony will

614
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,800
do very well, they're saying Xbox 360 will do very well, and they're saying Xbox 360

615
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,480
is doing well over here, but they're really, really, really looking, it seems to me like

616
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,220
they're really looking toward the Wii as their...

617
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,200
And if Loki's list from part A is to be believed, the Metal Slug Anthology is that game they're

618
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
working on.

619
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:18,500
SNK previously announced a Metal Slug Anthology Wii game will use the new controller.

620
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:25,020
They're also working a sixth game in the Metal Slug series, won't necessarily show up on

621
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,440
all of the consoles.

622
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:32,140
They're saying it is a 2D game, so they're not bringing it to the PS3 or Xbox 360 as

623
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,140
it is.

624
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,620
And you can guarantee that it's not going to be any different than the other five.

625
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,620
Hey!

626
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,220
The other games had different stuff in them when they kept releasing them.

627
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:46,000
There were new characters, there were new attacks, and you had mummies, and hey!

628
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,160
You know, SNK knows when they have a winner.

629
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,600
I'm not going to knock Metal Slug.

630
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,240
It is fun and that's what's important.

631
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,960
They have a working formula.

632
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,600
They add just enough stuff to make it a little different for whoever is playing it.

633
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,920
I really think that if you've got something that works, if you have something that fans

634
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,000
like, don't fuck with it.

635
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,680
Well said.

636
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:15,160
Alright, moving on, if you're downloading a lot of crap from E3 as I'm sure you guys

637
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,980
Beware, guys, because if you're not downloading your stuff from a trusted website, then you

638
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,460
might actually get some spyware hidden in there.

639
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,460
Guess what?

640
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:30,800
Spyware, folks, and the people that do that, in fact, one in particular is called Spy Falcon.

641
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,980
There's a report running on GamesAreFun.com where somebody actually got this bug in there

642
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:40,360
downloading E3 coverage, so I guess the spyware people are smartening up here and putting

643
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,800
this stuff into, I guess, E3 videos or whatever.

644
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,400
So please, guys, make sure you download all your E3 coverage from E3 on PSP.com because

645
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,320
it's the only site we can trust.

646
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,980
Unfortunately everybody else puts crap in there.

647
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,180
By the way, Macintosh folks, if you think you're safe just because you run on Mac, Spy

648
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:03,960
Falcon knows how to get into your Mac too, so watch out!

649
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,040
Spyware pisses me off, I don't know about the rest of you, does Spyware piss you off

650
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
Dark Sakura?

651
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,880
Does it piss you off enough to want to do the FUs of the week?

652
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:18,880
I hope so, because that's what's queued up.

653
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,840
F you to a person

654
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,960
whose name I will not

655
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,760
say

656
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,300
who decided to puck me out the last day of U3

657
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,880
and

658
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,720
act like an absolute child and involve himself in something that didn't involve him.

659
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,560
Yeah, when two people have a fight and they've resolved it, don't get emo over it. Stay the

660
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,560
fuck out of it. Pardon me for saying so. Other people's drama does not have to be your drama.

661
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,520
Only children do that, okay? So grow up and get over it and get your shoes out of my car.

662
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:13,760
I'm done. Wow. Uh, Loki! Um, fuck you to whoever is behind ruining G4 because, you know, I

663
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,640
guess I'm the last one on the face here to realize G4 is no longer a gaming network,

664
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,960
and you know, after, you know, browsing their section to find, oh look, there's nine hours

665
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,080
of non-gaming programming on there. Whatever, okay, so I'm a little behind the game, but

666
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:32,960
but mainly fucking ruining X-Play, I don't know if they've gotten lazy or what but their

667
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,700
review of Beatmania just pissed me off with the whole lack of knowledge in the game and

668
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:43,180
just basically saying, well it's not this game so it gets a 2 or whatever so fuck them

669
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:50,920
for being lazy now, to me the whole network should burn to hell, I don't know.

670
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,580
My F.U. of the Week goes to Jelly Belly's because for one, they're really addicting

671
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:00,440
and they're hella good and make me fat, but that's not why I'm giving them the F.U.

672
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,560
I'm giving them the F.U. because I bought this thing at the Jelly Belly's store and

673
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,600
it's the hot buttered popcorn and it's this case and buttered popcorn Jelly Belly's are

674
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
my favorite.

675
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,600
They're so good.

676
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,240
I know a lot of people think they're gross, but you suck because buttered popcorn is the

677
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
best.

678
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,300
Actually, next to toasted marshmallow, buttered popcorn is the best.

679
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,060
This is the thing, I bought this because it was on sale for $5 and I'm like, cool, that's

680
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,940
a lot of buttered popcorn jelly beans and it was like filling up here with all these

681
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,940
jelly beans.

682
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:34,580
Well, I come home and I open it and the damn thing is filled almost to the brim with styrofoam.

683
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,980
There was only a handful of buttered popcorn jelly beans to fill out the top of that thing.

684
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,780
I realize we're not on TV, you can't see that, but like an inch of that was filled

685
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:49,260
with jelly beans to give the illusion and I should have known when I picked the damn

686
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,560
thing up that it didn't feel full but I guess I don't know though because the

687
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,040
styrofoam is in there it feels weighted free false advertising right there all

688
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,940
that pissed me off no wonder it was discounted it was five so for five bucks

689
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,300
I got a handful of jelly beans in this useless fucking tin I will never do

690
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,480
anything with look at it every day to remind me how much I hate it

691
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,440
hooray no don't do that cuz Jelly Belly's making fat no Jelly Belly's don't

692
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,600
make you fat it's eating the Jelly Belly's that make you fat which is your

693
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Oh gross DT! What? Bringing up freaking super bacon. Disgusting. They have bacon jelly

694
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,640
bellies can you believe that? That's nasty although I almost bought wild

695
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,040
blackberry jelly bellies at the Winchester Mystery House. That's nasty! But

696
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,160
coconut's my favorite. Alright Loki who's also a jelly belly eater right? I don't

697
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,440
like jelly bellies. Really? I don't really like jelly beans anymore. I used to eat

698
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,560
them as a kid but you know I'm just not really a huge fan of jelly beans

699
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:51,560
games anymore. Naughty people at E3. Naughty naughty people. Fucking, hey dude, seriously,

700
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:59,440
NCSoft, they have to pay a $5,000 fine because they were too noisy. Little whiny pussy segos,

701
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,200
they turned noisy! They're detracting from our crappy games! So anyways, they... Wait,

702
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,840
didn't Loki name Sega the booth of the show? Correct me if I'm wrong. No, I did not. Okay.

703
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,320
I think you did. No I did not. I'm gonna go back and play, I could almost

704
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,280
swear you named Sega your booth of the show. Why?

705
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,880
Because it had full auto 2 and stuff. I'm almost positive you named Sega the show.

706
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,600
No, I said Capcom had good 360 games. Oh whatever, whatever.

707
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,960
So like little whiny bitches, they went and complained to the E3 management who

708
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,640
I don't even know how the hell you can determine that

709
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,200
you know, a booth is too noisy. Apparently they registered decibels. It was two

710
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,220
decibels above you know where it should be so they have to pay five thousand dollars

711
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:47,780
for that so you know ncsoff said fuck it who cares we're gonna play our music as loud as

712
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:56,100
we want and they did that so yeah rock on you guys yeah Sega gets my uh whiny pussy

713
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:07,620
of e3 awards so way to go all right um Sony move changing gears completely here uh Sony

714
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:13,720
This is interesting because if you think about the PSP, they have tried to prevent homebrew

715
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,720
so many times.

716
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,020
They keep patching the damn thing over and over and they won't give up, but yet they

717
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,960
are embracing homebrew on the PlayStation 3.

718
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,680
The system development manager Izumi Kwanishi says that the console is going to ship with

719
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,700
Linux built in, so you don't have to bother to figure out how to install it.

720
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:35,660
It's going to be already installed on there, and Sony is saying, hey homebrew folks, go

721
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:39,940
ahead and develop for this. This would be awesome. By the way, Sony will not be providing

722
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:46,940
technical support or access to SDK libraries, but Linux support is there. That's a very

723
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,100
strange policy when you consider the PSP.

724
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,660
I'm glad that they put a free operating system on their hard drives. How very thoughtful

725
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:57,140
of them.

726
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:05,140
You know what will be interesting about this? I just thought of this just now. Is this there

727
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:11,540
In a roundabout way, could this just be a big F you to the virtual console because just run a Linux emulator

728
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,180
There you got all the old-school games you want

729
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:19,780
If somebody perfects their Linux and Linux emulator like NES emulator for the PlayStation

730
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:24,380
Did you think maybe Sony had this forethought when they saw that people were making this on the PSP?

731
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,780
No, because they had Linux on PlayStation 2 as well

732
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,260
Can't you don't you think Sony kind of realizes this is what's gonna happen. People are gonna make emulators on this

733
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,500
probably

734
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,900
hmm

735
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:39,900
They're little bitches. That's what it comes down to, I mean, fucking little whiny bitch.

736
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,900
But here's the thing, Sony, people gotta buy your console before they can program emulators for it.

737
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,900
It's a win-win situation for Sony.

738
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:53,900
Yeah, they gotta buy them first. That's the problem, though. That is the major problem, is getting people to buy your console.

739
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,900
People will buy it.

740
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:03,900
Alright, uh, Loki. How about, uh, how about that Nintendo Wii? What kind of, does that have Linux on it?

741
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:10,060
no it doesn't have Linux on it but um apparently the E3 ones were running off of

742
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:16,300
quasi GameCube hardware basically they were housed in GameCubes and stuff which is not surprising I

743
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,460
mean it's a fucking dev kit it's running off of of course it's gonna be you know it's sort of based

744
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:25,260
on the GameCube anyways not really a big surprise I don't get why this is such a huge uproar in the

745
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:31,260
community right now like OMG the Wii was running off of GameCubes well well first off it was a

746
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,100
a souped up game, it was a custom built GameCube or whatever, it wasn't an actual GameCube,

747
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,980
but I seem to recall last year if you looked inside the little Xbox 360 boxes, you'd see

748
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,500
an Apple logo because they were running off G5s which was a very strange thing, and then

749
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,460
Sony this year, they just had it right there in the glass cases, we ain't running off PS3s,

750
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:53,380
these are just server things, you know, they didn't even try to hide what they were really

751
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,380
running off of.

752
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:59,820
But guys, it's a trade show, if the consoles were done, they'd be out tomorrow, of course

753
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,960
you're gonna see something still in progress.

754
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,540
This is not surprising at all.

755
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:07,960
It's just running off of... I mean it's basically a modified GameCube dev kit

756
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,900
because it's

757
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,540
based on the same architecture so...

758
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:15,480
BlackWolf liked to clarify the hardware was Wii, the box it was housed in was

759
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,220
just a GameCube. Okay, makes sense.

760
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,920
But why is this a problem? Why are people

761
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:26,460
blogging about this? Who cares anyway? It's a giant fucking case. It could be like the size of, you know,

762
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,940
a giraffe, it wouldn't matter. And of course it wasn't GameCube hardware, their games were

763
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,740
actually widescreen

764
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,380
GameCube never really, I mean there's a couple games on GameCube that'll be widescreen, but

765
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:41,320
shit, hardly any. And of course now our chat room, www.orangeword.com, click on chat,

766
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,960
they're just going off on the Linux thing and they're doing on all, they're

767
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,940
talking about everything you can install Linux on

768
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,920
DJ Pooh Eater says, Linux on a Jelly Belly

769
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:55,340
bastard. Hey, they put Linux on a toaster, why not? And Roz says, Linux on a plane

770
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:59,500
uh-huh uh-huh

771
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,080
I'll make the joke first

772
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,340
Linux on Ridge Racer!

773
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,720
There's actually somebody already beat you to that in chat. Damn it!

774
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,800
Linux in Africa!

775
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,520
Africa. Africa.

776
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,540
With a K.

777
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,980
Africa with a K. Linux 2, Linux in Africa.

778
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,740
What the hell was Africa?

779
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,640
Yeah. It was the monstrous digging up dirt game.

780
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,140
I'm hoping it's Pokemon Snap but in Africa.

781
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,900
I hope it's like, you know, big game hunter, you know, poachers. You are

782
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,700
messed up big game poacher

783
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,020
rhino hunter

784
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:33,100
uh... moving on now let's talk about x box three sixty rumors abound that the

785
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,220
x box three sixty is going to get a final fantasy title as well

786
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:40,180
uh... the three sixty supposedly going to get one of the fabulous nova chrysalis

787
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:43,260
final fantasy thirteen is you know it's a it's a series here

788
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,460
uh... is that there is the there's two of them on the playstation three and

789
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:51,180
then one of them on the mobile phone

790
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,140
well here's the here's the interesting thing supposedly

791
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:58,060
they've actually even trademark a new name with Final Fantasy 13

792
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:01,460
what so that there's there's there's a there's another

793
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:05,300
sub game that might be out on the 360 I know isn't that crazy

794
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,100
release 1.4

795
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,340
what the hell I know I don't

796
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:16,320
I don't it's weird I don't you know we don't know enough about the series yet

797
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,420
to know if this is justifiable or not well I know the mobile game is not going

798
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,900
to be justifiable under any circumstances gotta buy them all

799
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,780
But I'm curious to see what is in the works of the other ones.

800
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,580
Again, the 360 thing is just a rumor at this stage, you guys, and sounds like it might

801
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:36,820
be a little bit of hopeful MS fanboy thinking, but at the same time, it's not impossible.

802
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,820
Final Fantasy XI is on 360.

803
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,820
I heard that I might be on the live arcade.

804
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:42,820
That would be very interesting.

805
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,780
You know, why don't you support the phone game to the live arcade or something?

806
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,060
Make it better.

807
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,060
That's a better idea.

808
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:52,380
Why don't isn't I don't know why don't they just create ein hander 2 instead

809
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,140
Well put it's Final Fantasy. It's time to change the name

810
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:57,540
All right

811
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:03,420
Our skype lines gonna be open very very soon here if you want to call in it's 9 1 6 2 2 6 90 67

812
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,520
Please note that is not an 800 number. So there may be a toll toll charge incurred

813
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,260
So use your cell phone that has nationwide calling

814
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,620
Also, but make sure you have good reception because I hate it when we get bad cells

815
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:20,900
But the better way to call on the show is to use the skype line and that is Skype username orange lounge radio

816
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,440
We're gonna be open up right after this story Loki and be sure to also

817
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:30,220
Call echo one to ask call echo one two three first if you're using Skype

818
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,720
anyways, so

819
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,220
Speaking of games coming out

820
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:43,980
Capcom saying that they're going to have both Resident Evil 5 and Devil May Cry 4

821
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,060
playable at the Tokyo Game Show this year.

822
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,340
So that's excellent. We'll get to see that.

823
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,820
Hey, that's

824
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,620
just in time for the Playstation 3 launch

825
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,140
in a few months afterwards.

826
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:59,380
But I'm sure those aren't going to be the launch titles.

827
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,380
But hey, more games!

828
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,420
Can knock that. You know what, I was really impressed with their games.

829
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,620
Lost Planet and Dead Rising is here.

830
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,620
That Dead Rising game sounds hella fun, I'm sad I missed it.

831
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,620
More power to it.

832
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,620
I heard other podcasts talking about it and now I'm really interested.

833
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,620
Dead Rising is really fun.

834
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,620
Definitely gotta check it out.

835
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:22,620
It lived up to my expectations of it, so I can't wait.

836
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:29,620
Alright, our Skype line is open over at www.orangelaungeradio.com.

00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,300
Hi, you're on orange lounge radio

842
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,780
Hi, this is Ravens dolphin. Hello Ravens dolphin. What's on your mind?

843
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,920
well

844
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,920
the all game

845
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,040
The as you broke up there a little bit you say the all games thing. Yeah. Okay. What about it?

846
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,040
I thought it was great, great coverage.

847
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,040
We thought it was great too, thank you. What did you particularly like about it?

848
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,040
Everything, but I just have one question for you.

849
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,040
Me?

850
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:15,040
Yeah, what you thought of Alon from Chatterbox Game Show?

851
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:22,040
He was pretty nice, I mean it was weird because we met while Bobby's show was going on, so we didn't really have a chance to like,

852
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,080
Like, hi, this is Alon, and hi, this is Rob, and you guys will be doing a show together.

853
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,600
We just kind of got put on stage together, but he seemed like a nice guy, and he's pretty

854
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,160
passionate about what he does.

855
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:36,240
Yeah, but he came off of an asshole, but I listen to his show every day, but I didn't

856
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,800
know how he came out like that.

857
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,480
You know, sometimes people just have, I'm going to be bluntly honest, I've had very

858
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,260
little time to listen to other podcasts, and his is one of them that's on my I want to

859
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:51,520
listen to it but I haven't yet, but remember that sometimes people come off on the radio

860
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,260
a lot different than they do in real life like if you ever watch that movie

861
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,500
about Howard Stern

862
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,140
you can tell he's a different man than he is on the radio so you know

863
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,500
that might just be the radio persona thing but he was a nice guy in person

864
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,020
I'm not gonna knock him, he was a nice guy. Oh yeah I do believe that

865
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,260
I believe that it's just he just came off different

866
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,700
on his show he's down to earth but it's

867
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,500
it didn't sound too good he didn't like he was

868
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,820
aggravated

869
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,620
to death

870
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,380
well i got a shift this topic i we don't want to knock other podcasts especially

871
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,680

Ridge Racer.

889
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,140
Please let us die.

890
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,140
No, it says it in his bio.

891
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,140
It says Ridge Racer.

892
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,140
Couldn't resist.

893
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,780
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

894
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,620
As much as I cost, you get my own theme song.

895
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,660
La la la la la la la la.

896
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,500
There you go.

897
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,980
We had somebody sing our FU theme, so you get your theme song sung.

898
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:34,980
What's up?

899
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:35,980
Not much.

900
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,980
It's the one and only Ronma.

901
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:37,980
How you guys doing?

902
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:38,980
Uh, good Ronma.

903
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,980
Why aren't you coming to Fauna Mae?

904
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,980
2007. Alright, fair enough.

905
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,980
What's on your mind? Seriously. What are you calling about tonight? Couple things. First I want to say congratulations

906
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,980
for Loki for getting married. Ah, thank you.

907
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:58,980
May the gods have mercy on your soul.

908
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,980
She's a nice girl. She hates games, but she's a nice girl.

909
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,980
Actually she's not a nice girl, but she's funny. That's what makes it worth it.

910
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,980
Good enough, good enough.

911
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,980
Alright, do you have anything game related you want to ask about?

912
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,980
I have a couple of things.

913
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:18,980
I was at Nintendo World for E3 2006 press conference and I have tons of pictures to that.

914
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,980
Ooh, where are they going to be at?

915
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,980
On my website that I'm posting right now.

916
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,980
In chat room there, it looks like djramas.net.

917
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,980
Follow the linky links once you get in there.

918
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,980
Yes, and it was pretty awesome.

919
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,980
After the whole presentation, they had like a party to celebrate the one year anniversary.

920
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,380
Then they had like a nice VIP party at the end.

921
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:39,880
Cool.

922
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:45,880
And, um, I have more pictures of me at Nintendo World meeting Reggie Phil's aims.

923
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:53,780
Actually, wait, before we get into you meeting Reggie, did the catering at the Nintendo party have those potato things with bacon and cheddar in them?

924
00:57:54,380 --> 00:58:01,280
No, all we had was like, quote-unquote, like, phony, like, alcoholic drinks, but they were just regular soda and crap like that.

925
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,780
Okay, because E3 Outpost had the potato things.

926
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,980
He was at the Nintendo party?

927
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:05,480
Delicious.

928
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,920
You know, no, he was at the at the store on the East Coast

929
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,880
Oh like, you know how at e3 outpost we had like a viewing party

930
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,840
That was like all the podcasters watching it. That was that was what they did, but at the store

931
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:22,960
So they had like these mini tacos quesadillas and mini hamburgers and stuff. All right, tell us about Reggie. I

932
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,640
Asked him why I asked him

933
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:33,320
He's like we is everything we is all about us. We is awesome

934
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,600
I think I wanted to smack him for saying that we is awesome

935
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,360
Yes

936
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:47,000
And it's you know what that that's a really odd response that sounds like a textbook response to me like in the you know

937
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:51,940
FAQs for a PR person. Here's what to say when asked asked this

938
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:57,720
Did it sound a little textbook to you when he said it very much so

939
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,960
hmm, all right

940
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,480
Anything else you want to share about your experiences there at the store? No, it was pretty much fun

941
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:11,240
It was crowded and I could have heard people crapping their pants after seeing the whole presentation

942
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:16,580
Especially for me for seeing Starbucks guys put all those Nintendo fanboys under under one roof

943
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,600
And it must have just smelled awful by the time it was over. Oh

944
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,440
Lord you have no idea. All right, you know, it was even us at the outpost were kind of going

945
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,840
Oh, ah interesting when the Star Fox thing came up. We were like damn neat cool

946
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:34,640
So alright Rama, we're gonna let you go so we get more calls in. Okay, take it love a good one, buddy

947
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,840
Tell Reggie we said hi next time that I will love the hair. All right. All right

948
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:46,680
Let's go to another call. Hello. You're on Orange Lounge radio. Who's this? This is DMN. Hello DMN. What's on your mind?

949
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,540
Well, first of all exclusive announcement, okay

950
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:56,520

960
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,880
You know, I guess so, because a lot of our chatters are from all around, and theyíre

961
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,160
all too cheap to travel or canít afford it or whatever, so you might beóI hope we have

962
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,440
more than one person that shows up at the panel though, or Iíll be sad.

963
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,600
So youíve got to help us advertise, get word out at the con.

964
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:14,360
Well, I donít get that, because my cell phoneís beingó

965
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,360
Thatís all right.

966
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,040
I said youíve got to help us advertise and get the word out at the con, that weíre doing

967
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,640
the panel, so itís more than just you that shows up.

968
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,720

969
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,440

971
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:36,920

972
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:42,160
cuz I need to give you that I think you said what what chocolate is that what you

973
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:42,520
asked

974
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:47,740
what chocolate I you broke up there is that the was that the question what

975
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,400
chocolate

976
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,960
No, what kind of chocolate do you like best?

977
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,000
Because remember a couple episodes ago, you were saying they have to...

978
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Right, I said chocolate.

979
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
There you go.

980
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,520
I am a big fan of dark chocolate, especially anything that's 75% cocoa.

981
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,520
What kind of brands?

982
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,520
Give them a hint.

983
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,520
Drost.

984
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,520
Lindt.

985
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,520
Basically, the Belgian brand.

986
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,520
Lindt?

987
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,520
You mean this one?

988
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,520
L-I-N-D-T.

989
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,520
I can't blame you, man.

990
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,520
L-I-N-D-T.

991
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,520
All right.

992
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,520
But Drost is one of my favorites.

993
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,520
Those truffles are like crap

994
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:25,400
Dark chocolate will see I only eat dark chocolate because milk chocolate is kind of not good for you and white chocolate is made out

995
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:30,520
Of the leftover milk fat when they make regular chocolate. Why is it that every fucking week this show turns into the Food Network?

996
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,040
Without fail I must say that when it comes to chocolate I am a big fan of dark dark chocolate

997
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,580
So, thank you for appeasing my chocolate craving

998
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,580
No problem.

999
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,580
You're my hero now.

1000
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,580
Alright.

1001
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,580
Alright.

1002
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:49,580
Yeah.

1003
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:50,580
Spirit Snare, anything else on your mind?

1004
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:51,580
Nope.

1005
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:52,580
Five more days.

1006
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:53,580
What?

1007
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,580
Five more days.

1008
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,580
That's right.

1009
01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:00,720
And then you get to meet us in the flesh and be disappointed with our underwhelming presence

1010
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,720
in person.

1011
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,200
Alright, have a good one, Spirit Snare.

1012
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,200
Okay.

1013
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,200
Take care.

1014
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,200
Thanks.

1015
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,200
Good night.

1016
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,200
Good night.

1017
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,200
We're getting a call over here.

1018
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1019
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Who's this?

1020
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,400
I remembered what I wanted to talk about.

1021
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,400
Alright.

1022
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,400
Welcome back.

1023
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,400
Welcome back.

1024
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,400
What is it?

1025
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,480
Um, I was seeing if you guys were interested in something.

1026
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,480
Okay.

1027
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:28,880
Um, for a Nintendo I do get the Wii early, and I was wondering if the listeners and you

1028
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,480
guys would be interested in me buying one out of my own pocket, donating it to OLR and

1029
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,720
you guys giving it away on the long-range date.

1030
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,600
Um, fuck yes.

1031
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,600
Fuck yes.

1032
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,600
Okay.

1033
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,600
Woo!

1034
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,280
What's that? What's the deal here? What do we have to give you something out of this or oh?

1035
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:52,020
Do we well do we get to play it first because if we get it early we're gonna crack that shit open and play with

1036
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,620
it

1037
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:59,500
But I guess you guys can give away a quote-unquote slightly used week on we'll we'll autograph it or something that'll make it

1038
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah, it'll be the special olr edition. We that's what we'll do. We'll get out an orange highlighter and color it orange screw that

1039
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,880
Oh, I'll spray paint it there you go

1040
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,240
yeah we'll spray paint the Wii and we'll give away the world's only orange Wii

1041
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:16,600
it'd be great I it would work in regards to the launch date I don't think it's

1042
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:23,180
gonna be October oh why is that um seeing as if it's an October launch date

1043
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:28,320
we haven't seen any titles come into my department yet mm-hmm if it comes

1044
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,760
out in October that gives us less than six months to test the console and we

1045
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:37,360
would probably be a bit rushed by that so I would probably say shoot more for

1046
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:44,040
November. Did you guys test those E3 demos? I personally did not. I got to screw with

1047
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:49,680
some of them because the company has their own little mini E3 at Nintendo, but I did

1048
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:55,680
not personally test any of the Wii demos. Well, I don't know. Maybe there will be a

1049
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:00,640
lot of overtime coming. The evidence for October is still pretty good the way we are looking

1050
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:06,600
at it, but we are not necessarily claiming that is the definitive date. We are just saying

1051
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:11,060
Hey, here's some evidence that makes it look pretty strong. It's gonna be October, but you know you bring up a good time

1052
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,680
Well, let it maybe you'll get it in next week

1053
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,160
Hopefully all right. Well. We got to go. We're gonna take one more call. Okay, all right. Take care guys. Bye

1054
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,480
All right one last call hi. You're on orange launch radio

1055
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,720
Who's this?

1056
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:34,240
And Tim X4 yes on the talk about little things all right make it quick. What's up wait wait hang on?

1057
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,520
Let me turn down the volume stream.

1058
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,520
Hang on to one.

1059
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,520
Please do.

1060
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,520
All right.

1061
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,520
Okay, can you hear me?

1062
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,520
Yes, we can.

1063
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,520
What's up?

1064
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,520
Oh, crap.

1065
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,880
I turned down the volume on the entire thing.

1066
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,240
Oh, my God.

1067
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,240
Okay.

1068
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,240
Hi.

1069
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,240
You there?

1070
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,240
Yeah.

1071
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,240
Technical difficulties.

1072
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,240
All right.

1073
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,240
No, it's listener difficulties.

1074
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,240
That's all right, buddy.

1075
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,240
What's on your mind?

1076
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,240
Okay.

1077
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,040
First off, I'm disappointed about the whole video card thing.

1078
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:09,880
You need a big video card for doing certain things with N64 games on PCs, because in three

1079
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:14,340
weeks I'll be going to New York for this arch that my sister is in, and we're not going

1080
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:19,280
to take our van with TV and stuff that I normally play video games with, because where are you

1081
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,880
going to park in New York?

1082
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,880
Parking garages.

1083
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,720
Our van's not going to fit.

1084
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:30,400
So I was going to take my laptop and stuff and do games on there.

1085
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,800
Okay, well, you know, you'll just have to play something else, unfortunately.

1086
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,360
There's lots of computer games out there.

1087
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,360
Bring a 64.

1088
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:41,360
Yeah, well, or just take a DS, it's a 64 in a box.

1089
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,880
Well, I'm kind of doing it for multiplayer.

1090
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,880
Alright.

1091
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:52,840
And also, Loki, have you checked out Rush 2049 yet?

1092
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,200
I've played it before, yeah.

1093
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,840
OK, cool.

1094
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,880
Because I mentioned a couple, like,

1095
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,120
Yeah, I remember some phone call talking about this

1096
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,440
a while back.

1097
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,080
All right, we've got to let you go.

1098
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,360
We're wrapping up.

1099
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,160
OK, that's fine.

1100
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,600
Because I forgot what I was going to say.

1101
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,320
That's all right.

1102
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,920
What is with people forgetting tonight?

1103
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,320
All right, have a good one.

1104
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,980
What is with people forgetting tonight?

1105
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,680
Something in the air.

1106
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,960
It's because all you people have your attention diverted

1107
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,760
with the Desperate Housewives finale or something.

1108
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,960
I'm just kidding, I really hope you're not watching that.

1109
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,880
Moving on, Last Minute Stories.

1110
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,860
We have to give our listeners more credit than that.

1111
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,700
Anyone, anyone?

1112
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,240
Actually, I have friends that watch the show

1113
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,640
and say it's great, it's just not my thing.

1114
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,960
I'm turning into Jamie, there's no show I've been watching.

1115
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,520
I haven't even watched The Soup for three weeks,

1116
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,760
that's rare for me, because that's like my favorite show.

1117
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,800
I don't watch anything at all.

1118
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,360
That's been me lately.

1119
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,160
Anyway, DarkSakura, Last Minute Stories.

1120
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:55,440
Xbox Live hits 24 million downloads over 600 terabytes of data were transferred

1121
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:01,880
during e3 Wow the week of e3 which is 30 times more data than is found on all the

1122
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:05,880
printed material in the US Library of Congress I contributed to that number

1123
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:11,260
we all did well we had them downloading lost planet at the three outposts you

1124
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:17,740
and then we played Uno but the single most popular item downloaded for Xbox

1125
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:23,460
Live Marketplace was the trailer for Halo 3, but the rest of the download chart shows

1126
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:28,100
that the playable demos were more popular than the videos in general.

1127
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:33,780
They had Lost Planet, Test Drive Unlimited, and MotoGP 06.

1128
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:36,820
So that was a bit of Microsoft news.

1129
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:37,820
Awesome.

1130
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,540
Like a hot dog.

1131
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:45,260
Black Wolf would like to point out Uno greater than Lost Planet.

1132
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,260
Amen.

1133
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:50,340
says we downloaded the halo 3 trailer at the outpost 2 I didn't see it there I

1134
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:54,500
didn't see it till I got home Bobby you need to add Gunstar underscore hero to

1135
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:58,820
your yes you know you just gave that away to all our listeners fine that's my

1136
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:03,620
husband I won't tell anybody what mine is all right cuz I don't have one all

1137
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:09,560
right uh Loki any last-minute stories yeah you happen to buy a DS light here

1138
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:15,540
next month or so you do know you can put homebrew stuff on there really really

1139
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:19,660
Really simple.

1140
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:24,500
Datel actually has their Max Media Launcher, which, guess what, works just like one of

1141
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:28,260
those PassMe keys that they used to have, so you can put all this wonderful stuff on

1142
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,260
there.

1143
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:35,220
Including homebrew, including such things as ScummVMDS, which is for running Monkey

1144
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:44,380
Island and Data Tentacles, SamiMax, etc., DS Linux, and of course an IRC program, among

1145
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:51,260
other homebrew apps. And that Daedel thing, I believe, has carried most major retailers.

1146
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:57,940
I think even they had it at Best Buy and GameStop and stuff, so check it out.

1147
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:02,060
Chat Room is pointing out I actually cut Dark Sakura off before she got her husband's full

1148
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:08,220
screen name out. I don't think you got the second word of his screen name out, but that's

1149
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:12,320
okay because if you're smart and you know what kind of games Jamie plays, you can figure

1150
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:19,220
out what the screen name is it's not mine yeah gunstar come on I don't I said

1151
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:25,500
it oh I thought you just talked over me okay if you're in a chat room you'll

1152
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,140
know what it is if you really want to know what it is you can send me an email

1153
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:35,140
to Jamie at orange on radio.com I got one of those a 360 blogs for my gamer

1154
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:39,060
tag which is on the if you really want to know it it's on the olr forum I don't

1155
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:44,060
I don't think Dan would come close to doing anything like that. He just plays lots of Uno these days.

1156
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:46,060
Yeah, that's all you're gonna see is Dan playing Uno.

1157
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:51,060
Alright, let's get to the very last story of the evening and Loki's gonna bring it to you. Loki.

1158
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:56,060
Yes, have you ever thought, you know, the Wii just not interactive enough?

1159
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:04,060
Well, you know what, maybe you should be at E3 next year because they're bringing you,

1160
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:08,060
and this is not from Nintendo, mind you, the Nintendo amusement park.

1161
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:14,820
park. It's this live, they're calling it physical augmented reality. It's a real life obstacle

1162
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:21,520
course which a player jumps through a bunch of different levels and stuff using a power

1163
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,680
harness provided by them. And there's nothing digital, nothing projected, and nothing really

1164
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:33,940
virtual. It's just kind of silly fun I guess. But if you are interested in it, check it

1165
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:42,220
out at nintendoamusementpark.com, and it's just weird.

1166
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:46,740
You know the first thought that went through my mind when I read Nintendo Amusement Park?

1167
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:51,580
Nintendo Amusement Park, where the lines are four hours long.

1168
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:55,840
But yeah, it's just very strange.

1169
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:02,460
They have a video on their website though showing the ridiculousness of it, and it's

1170
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,460
interesting.

1171
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:09,100
Alright, we're gonna wrap it up kids. That's it for tonight's show, which I think might be our longest to date

1172
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,220
I think we're running on three hours just about here just shy of three hours

1173
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:16,020
We gotta go around again. Oh, yes. Love you. Sorry. I forgot one more thing

1174
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:19,580
All right, make it quick prey demo coming to Xbox Live on

1175
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,260
June 22nd. All right

1176
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:25,480
Now I want to finish this. Can we finish? All right

1177
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,780
