2
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:45,734
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

4
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you mean.

5
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:17,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's something far superior to anime.

6
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever, whatever.

7
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:26,020
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a convention that is happening that we're going to be at and doing our show live Saturday, 7 o'clock, panel room 1.

8
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you bathe.

9
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,990
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura will be there with Febreze.

10
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be there with Febreze and deodorant.

11
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:35,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I will also be cosplaying.

12
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:40,836
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also doing a panel Sunday at 7 about podcasting but it's not the show being taped.

13
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:43,218
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope you come out to that anyway but that's not actually our show being taped.

14
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,980
[SPEAKER_08]: That's us talking about how to be podcasting superstars.

15
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,461
[SPEAKER_08]: We should record it anyways.

16
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,272
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

17
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:21,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Just remember, even if you think we suck, we do this for free, and we don't get paid to do it like some of those guys over at some of the bigger websites, you know?

18
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:23,958
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, just keep that in mind.

19
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:25,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Jerk.

20
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we put as much effort into it as we get paid.

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Loki, getting into the news.

22
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:32,742
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation 3.

23
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, oh, PlayStation 3.

24
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:38,405
[SPEAKER_09]: What is wrong with you?

25
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:39,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

26
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:40,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can we start?

27
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:43,208
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but anyways, um,

28
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:48,556
[SPEAKER_09]: The big gripe with everyone in PlayStation 3 is, what games are going to be at launch?

29
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:53,000
[SPEAKER_09]: And well, that's a good question, because we don't really know.

30
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,441
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of titles missing.

31
00:02:55,502 --> 00:03:09,816
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, the CEO David Reeves of Sonic Beer Entertainment Europe mentioned that quite a few titles won't be making their launch date on November 17th.

32
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:16,230
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's basically the status, kind of running down things, of certain titles that they definitely showed at E3.

33
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,770
[SPEAKER_09]: First one, SingStar.

34
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:19,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Eh, certainly before Christmas.

35
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:22,333
[SPEAKER_09]: But it doesn't really say, you know, at launch.

36
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:26,375
[SPEAKER_09]: An iToy game will be available after Christmas.

37
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:31,337
[SPEAKER_09]: iToy is not playable at the moment, but it will come before March 2007.

38
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's good.

39
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:34,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Sooner than never.

40
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:40,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Heavenly Sword Formula 1 Motorstorm will not come out until after Christmas.

41
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:44,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Resistance, Fall of Man will certainly be a launch title.

42
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:47,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm glad one of those is actually going to be available.

43
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:53,885
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, which 15 launch titles are supposed to be there?

44
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:54,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

45
00:03:55,146 --> 00:03:58,489
[SPEAKER_09]: But, well, I know a couple of them, but, you know.

46
00:03:59,109 --> 00:03:59,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, do you?

47
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sharing that.

48
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:09,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, for example, one of them that actually most websites haven't been mentioning, Fear is going to be on the PlayStation 3 at launch.

49
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:10,838
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you know this?

50
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:14,460
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:42,550
[SPEAKER_09]: But your systems contradict that.

52
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:43,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

53
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:43,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

54
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:49,378
[SPEAKER_09]: We have it for... We actually have it for the PlayStation 3 and the 360, so... Yeah.

55
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:50,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

56
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, no Wii version of fear out there.

57
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:55,750
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

58
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, also about the PlayStation 3, a lot of people kind of mad about the lack of a rumble feature.

59
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:11,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Sony is saying that they didn't want to do it because it interferes with the whole tilt thing, but I think a lot of us are looking at that and going, mm-hmm, what about the lawsuit?

60
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:13,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is what is interesting.

61
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:23,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Immersion, who's the company who's involved in this lawsuit, says, I don't believe it's a very difficult problem to solve, referring to the shocking getting in the way of the tilt sensory.

62
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:26,883
[SPEAKER_08]: And Immersion is experts that would be happy to solve that problem for them.

63
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:34,145
[SPEAKER_08]: But in exchange, Sony is going to have to drop its current appeal against the 2004 lawsuit.

64
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:37,045
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is a very interesting exchange.

65
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:39,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, sure, we'll get you, Rumble, if you pay us a lot of money.

66
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:41,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.

67
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I think their system needs all the help it can get.

68
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,070
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

69
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see them do the rumble as well.

70
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Personally, if I had to choose, you know, rumble or tilt, I'd choose a rumble, because the tilt function sucked.

71
00:06:09,814 --> 00:06:12,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen anything that really sells me on the tilt function.

72
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:15,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, there was Warhawk, but not enough for me.

73
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:20,200
[SPEAKER_08]: So, show me why I need tilt, and maybe I'll say that.

74
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:20,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

75
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:22,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

76
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get tilt already at home.

77
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, with the pinball machine?

78
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:25,803
[SPEAKER_03]: With the pinball machine.

79
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:27,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's a little different.

80
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:28,745
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

81
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer that kind of tilt to Sony's tilt, so...

82
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:34,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they just haven't put it in the right game yet.

83
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:34,818
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see, though.

84
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:35,138
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

85
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, developers.

86
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting frustrated because they haven't received PS3 dev kits yet.

87
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:47,767
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, some of the major ones, THQ and Sega, just haven't gotten dev kits.

88
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:59,536
[SPEAKER_09]: THQ boss Brian Farrell reportedly said that his company had killed the work on Sopranos for the PlayStation 3 because it was too risky at the moment since they don't have a dev kit.

89
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:07,317
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of important if you want games to be included with your $600 system that's coming out in the fall.

90
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:13,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, hopefully it's coming out in the fall because they said, oh yeah, we're launching in the fall.

91
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We're launching November 17th or whatever.

92
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:19,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I remember when they said they were launching back in spring.

93
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,361
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, it's not looking good.

94
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:26,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

95
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:35,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, we're going to go ahead and go back to you for another story about the Final Fantasy VII remake that was rumored last E3.

96
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:35,937
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on with this?

97
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:40,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, according to EGM, they're saying yes, it is.

98
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:53,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, in their latest edition of the magazine, which I think was actually on the show floor at E3, it says, Last year, Square Enix teased everyone with what they called the Final Fantasy VII PS3 tech demo.

99
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what do you know?

100
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:59,789
[SPEAKER_09]: This test case was really a sneak peek at the next gen revival of the PlayStation 1 role-playing hit.

101
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:01,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it actually coming out?

102
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Eh, maybe.

103
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,252
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, just because the magazine says so, who knows.

104
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:08,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, interesting.

105
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot, well, it would make sense with all the Final Fantasy VII love that Square's been giving lately.

106
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it makes total sense.

107
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:15,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so.

108
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:21,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, there was a whole I heard a friend of a friend thing a while back that said it was happening, but, you know, take that with a grain of salt.

109
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,027
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's another interesting one.

110
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:31,433
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't from a friend, but, well, you know, someone, I would call this person a friend, but a listener of our station tipped me off on something, which I think is very interesting.

111
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:36,336
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was overheard by people that would know what they're talking about.

112
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:38,157
[SPEAKER_08]: from Nintendo.

113
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:49,146
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, Nintendo is trying to secure the rights to remake Final Fantasy VII for a portable console in the near future.

114
00:08:50,393 --> 00:09:00,259
[SPEAKER_08]: So take it with a grain of salt, but this was overheard by a listener of ours from people that would know what they're talking about, that Final Fantasy VII is coming to a portable console, and this is Nintendo.

115
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:05,502
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously it's the DS or some other crazy thing they might have in the works, but I'm pretty sure it's the DS.

116
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:12,667
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, take it with a grain of salt, but when I think about it, it makes a lot of sense that Final Fantasy VII would come out on the DS, right?

117
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:17,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's also the fact that basically since the DS is a glorified Nintendo 64 console,

118
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:30,240
[SPEAKER_03]: They had Final Fantasy 6 characters as a demo for what would have been Final Fantasy 7 back on the Nintendo 64 until they went to Sony instead.

119
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,885
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, they've even had work on this before, technically.

120
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:39,164
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very interesting point.

121
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:40,905
[SPEAKER_08]: It wouldn't be too hard to, I guess, make it happen.

122
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:43,167
[SPEAKER_08]: People think, oh, it was CD to cartridge.

123
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:44,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

124
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:44,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

125
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:47,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it would be in their best interest to remake it.

126
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:50,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially after seeing Final Fantasy III at E3.

127
00:09:50,614 --> 00:09:55,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy III is in a very similar graphical style, in fact a little better than Final Fantasy VII.

128
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:56,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I could totally see it happening.

129
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,685
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's not also forget that Squeenix is on a currently Final Fantasy binge right now.

130
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:34,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Saturating us with Final Fantasy 7 everything What an interesting retort from Nintendo though if that happened because Sony has been really selling you know the PSP you can download the PlayStation 1 game and the game that everyone asks about can I play Final Fantasy 7 on it they're not asking about Ridge Racer they're asking about Final Fantasy 7 will I be able to play Final Fantasy 7 on the PSP and of course the answer is yes but what a great response from Nintendo to be able to play Final Fantasy 7 on the DS but again guys

131
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:39,281
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you have to take it with a little bit of grain of salt right now, but just don't be surprised if it actually happens.

132
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:40,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Be very, very interesting.

133
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:43,549
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

134
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:45,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

135
00:10:47,947 --> 00:11:00,774
[SPEAKER_08]: There is an HDMI cable coming to the Xbox 360, and Liksang is supposedly offering that you can put your name on a list to be one of the first ones to get this cable when it does come out.

136
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:05,516
[SPEAKER_08]: So Liksang has taken pre-orders for this HDMI cable, so people are kind of jumping to conclusions there.

137
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:06,837
[SPEAKER_08]: That means one is on the way.

138
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:08,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And it would make sense.

139
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:10,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft likes to do that.

140
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:13,341
[SPEAKER_08]: If their competition does something, they'll do it as well.

141
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,642
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll release an upgrade or something.

142
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:18,765
[SPEAKER_08]: They've built that 360 to be pretty quickly upgradable, so I could totally see this happening.

143
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:20,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why it didn't happen at launch, but whatever.

144
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:21,887
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming.

145
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:32,675
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially if there's an HD DVD player in the works, and this whole discussion about 1080p is the true HD, I think that would make a lot of sense for that HD DVD player to come out, as well as an HDMI cable.

146
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:33,656
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would be...

147
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:42,038
[SPEAKER_08]: A good way to answer Sony's Blu-ray is the true HD or whatever.

148
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:43,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, Loki.

149
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

150
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,320
[SPEAKER_08]: What else on the 360?

151
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:50,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Other things on the 360, well, Devil May Cry.

152
00:11:51,884 --> 00:12:02,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, they're saying that Devil May Cry 4 might not be exclusive to the PS3, but may debut on the 360 and Revolution as well.

153
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:03,669
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean the Wii?

154
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever, the Wii.

155
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:19,045
[SPEAKER_09]: According to the latest issue of Famitsu, they basically feature an interview with Hiroshi Kobayashi, the producer of the Devil May Cry series.

156
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So, interesting.

157
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,529
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not all.

158
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:24,851
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

159
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:30,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition may be coming to Xbox 360 as well.

160
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:40,332
[SPEAKER_09]: According to Planet Xbox 360, and they don't really give a source on it, but they say that it's coming to the 360 in the PAL territories.

161
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:45,655
[SPEAKER_09]: So they mention September as the launch date for that.

162
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:47,056
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be interesting.

163
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:48,737
[SPEAKER_08]: But a rumor for now.

164
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:50,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of Devil May Cry love on the 360.

165
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:51,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Good deal.

166
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:55,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going over to the chat room over at www.orangeentree.com.

167
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:56,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Click on chat.

168
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,466
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of feedback there to what we were saying earlier about the Final Fantasy VII remakes.

169
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,829
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ PooEater says, How many times can I watch Aeris die?

170
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:05,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop pulling my heart out, you bastard squeenix.

171
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:07,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't watch it enough.

172
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:12,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my game saved where she dies so that I can watch her die over and over.

173
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:16,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you do that on the PSP version and the PS3 remake and the DS version?

174
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:17,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah!

175
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:21,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate Aerith!

176
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:26,766
[SPEAKER_08]: You should set it up so that you have it all play at once on all the different... I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate her.

177
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,929
[SPEAKER_09]: The question is, how are they going to fit all that on a cartridge?

178
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Those DS cartridges are pretty big, and I could see it happening.

179
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:45,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I think somebody made a joke, I think Bobby said something, Blackwolf in the chatroom said something about they could put Final Fantasy VII on three carts, and the third cartridge is nothing but the ending.

180
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:54,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Rene was saying, in response to me saying everybody's asking for Final Fantasy VII, he's saying I'm asking for Intelligent Cube.

181
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:57,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Good call, good call.

182
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:01,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on with topics.

183
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:05,368
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a brand new add-on coming to Oblivion.

184
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:08,389
[SPEAKER_08]: This is really being an expanding, ever-expanding game.

185
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:13,551
[SPEAKER_08]: The latest one, according to a Bethesda developer, saying basically it's Goonies.

186
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:20,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Because what happens in this mission is that you will take control of a cavernous lair that has a pirate ship in it.

187
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:24,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once you get the pirate ship, you get to go loot things.

188
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:27,764
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just like the Goonies, because remember they had the pirate ship in the cave?

189
00:14:28,204 --> 00:14:38,590
[SPEAKER_08]: So get this, even if that doesn't interest you, Bethesda is supposedly working on an additional six to seven add-ons, including an epic dungeon, and they want to release this stuff every three to four weeks.

190
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,171
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the smartest way to keep your game going, honestly.

191
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:42,292
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great tactic.

192
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:50,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Oblivion, a very impressive game, one I need to play more of, but I can't tear myself away from that other RPG I keep playing over and over.

193
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:54,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Oblivion would be better if it had co-op over live.

194
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but then it's an MMO, in a way.

195
00:14:58,288 --> 00:14:58,548
[SPEAKER_08]: In a way.

196
00:14:58,608 --> 00:14:59,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily.

197
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:00,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

198
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:11,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, it's been a little while since we've been able to take a look inside our old mailbag, but DarkSakura hasn't forgotten about you guys who email us every week at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

199
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:16,378
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've got a little bit of a backlog tonight, so we want to let DarkSakura get to it and check the mailbag.

200
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:21,001
[SPEAKER_08]: So, DarkSakura, put on your hazmat suit and your rubber gloves and dig on into the mailbag.

201
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,384
[SPEAKER_03]: This week is actually asbestos.

202
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:31,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm gonna die.

203
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:32,945
[SPEAKER_08]: What, are we getting flames this week?

204
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:33,565
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

205
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:35,586
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just saying.

206
00:15:35,786 --> 00:15:53,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy Todd emailed us, and basically he wanted to state, and we've actually been talking about this back and forth, about saying that the Wii controller and the PlayStation 3 controller...

207
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me just start over.

208
00:15:57,246 --> 00:15:58,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just start over reading this.

209
00:15:58,547 --> 00:15:58,907
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

210
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:00,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired.

211
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:01,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

212
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:08,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to address to many people that the PS3 isn't like the Wii controller, since many of the people who watch the Sony conference probably got this impression.

213
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,711
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii controller can sense 3D space, but the PS3 controller cannot.

214
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we discussed this.

215
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:22,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, to go ahead and point this out, for everybody else who has this misconception, they are almost the same.

216
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:23,654
[SPEAKER_03]: The tilt is a gyroscope.

217
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,274
[SPEAKER_03]: The connection to the TV is infrared.

218
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:29,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Not 3D space, it's infrared.

219
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:33,656
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just sensitivity the closer and further away you get it.

220
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:38,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And it connects to the PS2, I'm sorry, to the Wii by Bluetooth.

221
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically...

222
00:16:43,429 --> 00:17:09,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when Bobby was talking about this though accelerometers is a big part of the Wii thing too though that not every game uses infrared some use just the accelerometers and some use just the infrared so it just kind of depends on the game you're playing but it's really not all that you know fantastic they just took actually very simple technology and used it in a complex way how I see it okay so yeah um

223
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:18,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this was, our good friend Rob linked me to another editorial at Pointless Waste of Time.

224
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:27,284
[SPEAKER_03]: And for anyone who wants to read it, because I'm not going to go into the whole thing, it's at pointlesswasteoftime.com slash games slash crash.html.

225
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:30,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It's life after the video game crash, post E3 2006 edition by...

226
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,000
[SPEAKER_03]: and David Wong.

227
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:44,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read these two paragraphs on here.

228
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:46,208
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, Who am I?

229
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:48,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the creator of a certain video game console.

230
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:54,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to toot my own horn, but let's just say the profits of this machine were $4 billion higher than the Microsoft Xbox.

231
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,571
[SPEAKER_03]: My console consisted of a plastic milk crate with a kitten placed inside.

232
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:00,212
[SPEAKER_03]: The controller was a wooden rod that could be used to poke the kitten.

233
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:03,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I sold zero of these consoles, which cost me zero to manufacture.

234
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, my profits were zero.

235
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:07,434
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox, however, lost $4 billion."

236
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:10,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to buy the Poke the Kitten console.

237
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:11,597
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like fun.

238
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I need the Poke the Rabbit console instead.

239
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:22,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, there is a link on this to an article at Joystick about just how much they've kept losing over the Xbox.

240
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:35,430
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's pretty much going into a lot more detail about basically why the video game industry is going to crash, especially with the release of the PS3.

241
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony is basically...

242
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:41,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Planning to take a $400-$500 loss on every single PS3 they sell.

243
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:45,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in a few years they'll start making money on it.

244
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:53,200
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing that it brings up that I just think is probably the most apt comparison here.

245
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:55,602
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, why does the industry have to crash it all?

246
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:58,883
[SPEAKER_03]: The movie industry is still around over a century later.

247
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:07,028
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been proven, especially with the Atari 2600, that you can have a system for a few years, but after a while you'll stop playing it.

248
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:11,693
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that when they released E.T.

249
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:13,993
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1983, E.T.

250
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:18,934
[SPEAKER_03]: was supposed to be Atari's biggest game to hit the market.

251
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:24,475
[SPEAKER_03]: About 6 million of them stayed on shelves.

252
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:26,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, the game was pretty wretched.

253
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:30,056
[SPEAKER_03]: But even so, it was just that people weren't playing their 2600s by 1983.

254
00:19:30,176 --> 00:19:31,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing new was out.

255
00:19:31,276 --> 00:19:32,516
[SPEAKER_03]: People got tired of it.

256
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:33,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an old toy.

257
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a very, very good comparison right there.

258
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:47,229
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's why, you know, how many were all up all over it when they got their GameCube, you know?

259
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:49,130
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you are still playing it?

260
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,631
[SPEAKER_03]: When was the last time you played your GameCube, Rob?

261
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:52,252
[SPEAKER_08]: A while ago, I'll be honest.

262
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:52,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a while ago.

263
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:56,294
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's because there hasn't been any games that have come out lately that have made me go, wow.

264
00:19:56,615 --> 00:20:02,558
[SPEAKER_08]: And I haven't had a good nerd party lately where people... Because, like, that was pretty much where my GameCube was getting the most use.

265
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:06,481
[SPEAKER_08]: People come over, we play F-Zero, we play Smash Bros., we play Mario Party.

266
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,682
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the greatest party console ever.

267
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:11,395
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the oldest system that you own right now?

268
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:13,937
[SPEAKER_08]: That still works?

269
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:16,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably my Super Nintendo.

270
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,941
[SPEAKER_03]: When was the last time you touched it?

271
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:19,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's in a box.

272
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:21,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't need to.

273
00:20:21,144 --> 00:20:22,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I can emulate it.

274
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:25,387
[SPEAKER_08]: But I emulated a Super Nintendo game last week.

275
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:27,429
[SPEAKER_03]: But when did you pull your system out and play it?

276
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, ages ago.

277
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably in college.

278
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:33,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, if you didn't have an emulator, would you pull out your SNES and play it?

279
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:37,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be honest, probably.

280
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:40,030
[SPEAKER_08]: But not on a regular basis.

281
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,771
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be one of those things where it's like, dude, remember Super Metroid?

282
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:43,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yeah, let's play.

283
00:20:43,631 --> 00:20:45,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's what emulators are kind of like.

284
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:46,432
[SPEAKER_03]: But you wouldn't play it every day.

285
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:46,972
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

286
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:49,313
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd play it for a little bit and then you'd just put it away.

287
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:49,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

288
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:56,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan and I own all these systems, but honestly, the last time we touched our TurboGrafx was a few months ago.

289
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:01,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't touched my own Super Nintendo that I moved out here with in a year.

290
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Except when I moved it, when we moved into our house.

291
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:10,995
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, you keep it around, and the novel aspect is there.

292
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:17,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to go play my Nintendo, but are you going to have it hooked up as your primary system?

293
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:17,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell no.

294
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:23,299
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was the only thing you owned, would you still have found other things to do after three years had passed?

295
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:28,276
[SPEAKER_08]: It would really depend on my scenario.

296
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:39,664
[SPEAKER_08]: But on the other hand, if I didn't have the money to afford a new console and I could go to a garage sale or a flea market and buy Super Nintendo games for like two bucks a pop, I'd get a lot more life out of it.

297
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:45,028
[SPEAKER_03]: But would you still play it more often if you could go out and do stuff instead?

298
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,766
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to say, because I'm not in that situation.

299
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's just the point of view I'm trying to point out, you know.

300
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:51,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Understandable.

301
00:21:51,927 --> 00:22:02,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I had, you know, my Super Nintendo, I had for years, and after a couple years, even though, you know, I was still a big gamer, I still loved to play my Super Nintendo, I put more attention toward other things.

302
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:11,235
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's just how I was with it, even though I loved to death, and I'd go through and have my, you know, massive three-hour games of Kirby's Avalanche, you know.

303
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:14,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a pretty good, you know...

304
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:18,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was a pretty neat point to bring up.

305
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,123
[SPEAKER_08]: 23rd Magus in our chatroom, by the way, would like to point out that your pet Shermie does not approve of the Poke the Kitten console.

306
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:27,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't approve of the Poke the Kitten console.

307
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:29,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally approve.

308
00:22:29,326 --> 00:22:39,572
[SPEAKER_03]: The next point on this, though... Well, see, it keeps bringing out, though, that, you know, that, yeah, you get it with slightly better graphics, but really aren't the games the same?

309
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:41,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was a funny comparison, though, of...

310
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:48,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet Goblins Attack in 1980, and The Legend of Zelda in 1987.

311
00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:53,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you.

312
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,557
[SPEAKER_03]: You have orange box, yellow box, and of course we all know what Zelda looks like.

313
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:07,840
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really going into, a lot more of this article goes into how, oh, these systems are so great, but now you're getting just more of the same with everything released.

314
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,461
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no new innovation, which is actually why I think

315
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:19,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you noticed how much bigger the crowds were at Nintendo than they were for Microsoft and Sony.

316
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, a part of that I blame on Nintendo's design, though.

317
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:26,611
[SPEAKER_08]: You could walk right into Sony's and play their console on Microsoft.

318
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:28,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's a whole variety.

319
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:29,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have the whole hype behind the Wii.

320
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:32,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I can relate it to this.

321
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:35,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see how much line they had anticipated getting at Sony?

322
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,300
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

323
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:40,102
[SPEAKER_03]: And they got maybe a third of that?

324
00:23:40,423 --> 00:23:44,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the other thing, too, that all their consoles are playable at other booths.

325
00:23:45,527 --> 00:23:46,467
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good point, too.

326
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:50,610
[SPEAKER_08]: You could walk into Sega and play Full Auto 2 in the Sonic game.

327
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:52,712
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's a good point.

328
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:57,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I would recommend giving this article a read.

329
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,965
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very well-written editorial.

330
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:03,506
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes a lot more into detail about, you know, supporting proof.

331
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:05,246
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it gives actual numbers.

332
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:06,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives actual information.

333
00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:08,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was very, very smart.

334
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:12,127
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say definitely go take a look.

335
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:13,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out, dudes.

336
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:13,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

337
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:14,907
[SPEAKER_08]: And dudettes.

338
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:20,328
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did like the whole, you know, bringing up the comparison there.

339
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:23,549
[SPEAKER_03]: We got an email from Jay Vez.

340
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:25,597
[SPEAKER_03]: We got another one from Ldriver.

341
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:25,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

342
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:40,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

343
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:45,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to give you a shout and let you know how awesome your E3 coverage was.

344
00:24:45,602 --> 00:24:53,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Yours was my favorite, and it was cool to have you guys, all games, GamerAndy and BobbyBlackWolf, all on the same... I'm sorry, all on each other's shows.

345
00:24:54,187 --> 00:24:55,407
[SPEAKER_03]: You should try to do that more often.

346
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:56,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.

347
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:56,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

348
00:24:57,368 --> 00:25:17,492
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a great it was a brilliant idea from the all games people to put us all under one roof the only unfortunate thing is is that again you had Gamer Andy who's based in the bay us who's based in Sacramento Scott and Lawrence who are based in LA and Bobby who's in Atlanta so it's you know that doesn't happen very often where everybody's in the same city except for something as massive as E3

349
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:25,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Game Developers Conference next year because I could see us going to that and probably at least... I know Bobby flew out this year, so maybe something will happen again.

350
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:26,903
[SPEAKER_08]: But who knows?

351
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:31,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the guy from Chatterbox as well is in Arizona.

352
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:32,367
[SPEAKER_08]: He was there for one of the shows too.

353
00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:36,750
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not very often everybody gets under one roof, but we thought it was a good time.

354
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:41,794
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I liked about it, too, was that there was no sense of competition.

355
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:45,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, we had the joking chat, oh, how many people you got listening, oh, how many people you got listening.

356
00:25:45,998 --> 00:25:57,867
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of had that joke, but it was just kind of like we all realize that our shows are different because of who hosts it, and there's just different things that each show brings to the table, and we can all coexist.

357
00:25:58,207 --> 00:26:01,390
[SPEAKER_08]: People will gravitate to the host's

358
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:08,112
[SPEAKER_08]: or hopefully multiple shows of the hosts that they seem to reflect their personality or the complete opposite.

359
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:10,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people might listen to us because what we say pisses them off.

360
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:10,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

361
00:26:11,095 --> 00:26:14,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was great though that we could have such different points of view.

362
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,601
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very nice to have new people to bounce off of.

363
00:26:17,882 --> 00:26:20,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I think one of the reasons I like the whole all games thing is because

364
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:22,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I play Super High Impact.

365
00:26:49,285 --> 00:26:50,085
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.

366
00:26:50,186 --> 00:26:50,746
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know.

367
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:52,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a Tecmo ball for life.

368
00:26:52,947 --> 00:26:54,467
[SPEAKER_03]: But L Driver has a question for us.

369
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:54,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

370
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:59,789
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, who was the coolest industry person you met at the show?

371
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Or who were you most excited about meeting or seeing?

372
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:09,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard people say nothing about, I'm sorry, say nothing about great things about Major Nelson and Trixie.

373
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:13,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's telling Microsoft that people like working for them.

374
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:16,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see that on the Sony side, just a thought.

375
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:21,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob took my photo with Igarashi Koji, who's the producer of the Castlevania games.

376
00:27:41,803 --> 00:27:43,764
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one I met too that I thought was really exciting.

377
00:27:43,804 --> 00:27:48,368
[SPEAKER_08]: But honestly, I gotta be honest, nothing will beat Akira from two years ago.

378
00:27:48,388 --> 00:27:49,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Akira Yamaoka.

379
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:50,009
[SPEAKER_08]: That was mine.

380
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:52,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you met Koji Kondo.

381
00:27:55,033 --> 00:27:55,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

382
00:27:57,755 --> 00:27:59,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, did you meet any industry people?

383
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:04,900
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but I wish I had met I think it was like Steve Odedeck or whatever that was there.

384
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember the guy did Kung Pao.

385
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:09,483
[SPEAKER_09]: He apparently was walking around in E3.

386
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:10,324
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was like,

387
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:15,146
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm cool to meet him because I gotta punch him in the face and say, Make goddamn Kung Pao 2!

388
00:28:15,547 --> 00:28:17,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I need to see the movie now!

389
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:18,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Get off your ass!

390
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:23,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop wasting your time with Barnyard and those other crappy animated movies.

391
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:24,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Kung Pao 2!

392
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:31,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta be honest, though, I try not to be fanboy at E3 because it's supposed to be, you know, a professional thing.

393
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:34,627
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't run up to people and go, OMG, I'm your biggest fan.

394
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:45,195
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, in the case of, you know, the guy, Igarashi, you know, it's just kind of, the way we just kind of talked to him was like, hey, you know, we wanted to actually just tell him about our show in hopes that we could get him on.

395
00:28:45,715 --> 00:28:48,217
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, and, you know, take a picture while we're at it for the website.

396
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:48,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

397
00:28:48,898 --> 00:28:49,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun.

398
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're gonna cut out the part with me in it.

399
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,840
[SPEAKER_08]: No, stop.

400
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:53,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

401
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I got an email.

402
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:00,738
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been picked for Podzinger, our podcast of the week.

403
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, Podzinger.

404
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so everyone should go to Podzinger.com.

405
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:07,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check it out.

406
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:15,162
[SPEAKER_08]: The other cool thing about Podzinger and part of what sets them apart from other podcast search engines is that they actually will break down what we say.

407
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:20,603
[SPEAKER_08]: It somehow converts our MP3 into text.

408
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:27,085
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't actually read it, but if you do search, you'll actually see Podzinger try to read the sentence as we spoke it.

409
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:28,805
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really weird technology, but it's cool.

410
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,827
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can actually search for words in podcasts.

411
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:32,868
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's kind of neat.

412
00:29:32,888 --> 00:29:33,689
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, Podsinger.

413
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:34,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

414
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:39,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Our last one comes from Nintendomaniac64, who has a question for us.

415
00:29:40,774 --> 00:29:51,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was, I was wondering if there was a way of taking an AGP or PCI port out of a PC and hooking it up to a laptop via internally or externally so that I could use a decent video card.

416
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:53,584
[SPEAKER_08]: No idea, Loki.

417
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:54,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea.

418
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:54,905
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

419
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:57,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Pay attention!

420
00:29:57,816 --> 00:29:57,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Fired!

421
00:29:57,956 --> 00:29:58,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was reading something.

422
00:29:59,017 --> 00:30:05,441
[SPEAKER_03]: You should take an AGP or PCI port out of a PC and hook it up to a laptop to use a better video card.

423
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:08,043
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to probably be able to do that.

424
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:11,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Because laptops, a lot of times, they have PCI Express.

425
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:13,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, especially the recent ones, they have PCI Express cards.

426
00:30:14,427 --> 00:30:17,589
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not sure if there are their own versions of them.

427
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:23,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, my laptop right now has a ATI Mobility Radeon X600.

428
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:24,413
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of a

429
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,120
[SPEAKER_09]: My laptop plays games just fine.

430
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:54,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Alienware does make a...

431
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:13,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, buy a Mac if you want good graphics.

432
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:14,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just get a Mac.

433
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Loki.

434
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:16,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I know how you feel, but honestly.

435
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:18,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the stuff for the new MacBook?

436
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:19,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it hot?

437
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,187
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta take it back to gaming.

438
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:21,968
[SPEAKER_09]: We gotta keep it going.

439
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:23,028
[SPEAKER_03]: MacBook Pro.

440
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you're taking it back to gaming, then obviously Mac is the wrong way to go there.

441
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:26,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

442
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

443
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:28,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I dropped my mic.

444
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:30,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've done to my computer.

445
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:30,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

446
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,951
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'll be playing World of Warcraft on my Mac.

447
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,294
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll be playing Ragnarok online.

448
00:31:38,414 --> 00:31:40,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, look, shut up.

449
00:31:40,956 --> 00:31:47,480
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to email us, add to the mailbag for next week, yell at Loki for his Matt Cate mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com is the address.

450
00:31:48,421 --> 00:32:00,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, I gotta mention this because we have a lot of folks who love the music games and by the way, we have a video coming to the website tonight of some of the new DDR games, so some of you kids can see the interface, so check that out.

451
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:02,930
[SPEAKER_08]: But Rez, hugely popular game.

452
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Rez, Rez, Rez.

453
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:11,836
[SPEAKER_08]: In an interview with Eurogamer, the creator of Rez spoke about the possibilities of a sequel to Rez.

454
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:20,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, he says that he is looking at the next generation possibilities and trying to do a Rez kind of experience.

455
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:25,264
[SPEAKER_08]: If Sega were to approach him to make a Rez sequel, he is currently seriously considering it.

456
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,405
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always there.

457
00:32:26,505 --> 00:32:27,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always thinking about it.

458
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:54,573
[SPEAKER_08]: so it's kind of interesting to think about which system would it be on would it be on like the Wii where you could move it around or would it be on like the 360 where you could do like updates or would it be on the PlayStation 3 which is supposed to have the true high definition who knows who knows but I believe Rez was originally a Dreamcast game and just brought over to the PlayStation 2 right that's right yeah that's exciting though I really hope that happens and while we're at it how about more Space Channel 5 please thank you

459
00:32:55,888 --> 00:32:56,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki!

460
00:32:56,588 --> 00:32:58,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Got some news on Pac-Man.

461
00:32:58,669 --> 00:32:59,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Pac-Man World Rally.

462
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:05,090
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did play this game, and it's actually a complete rip-off of Mario Kart.

463
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:19,813
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways, Namco mentioned that all versions of their upcoming game on all the different consoles will feature as an unlockable character the Prince of All Cosmos from the Katamari series.

464
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:23,094
[SPEAKER_09]: And how you unlock this character, you may ask?

465
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:30,340
[SPEAKER_09]: by winning the gold trophy in all the circuit cups with the easy difficulty setting, which makes me believe there's more characters.

466
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a surprise at all, though, that the prince is hidden in there.

467
00:33:34,421 --> 00:33:37,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they've got to milk the Katamari franchise if there's not going to be any games.

468
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,702
[SPEAKER_08]: The hard difficulty, you may ask?

469
00:33:40,122 --> 00:33:42,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Hard difficulty, you get to drive as the king's package.

470
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:44,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

471
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:46,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I think on the hard difficulty, you should drive a Katamari and roll over everybody.

472
00:33:47,263 --> 00:33:47,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that would be fun.

473
00:33:48,223 --> 00:33:51,504
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that racing level in We Heart Katamari was like the best thing ever.

474
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:52,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the racing level.

475
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:54,636
[SPEAKER_08]: That and the fire level.

476
00:33:57,258 --> 00:34:01,402
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, another sequel possibly in the works?

477
00:34:01,982 --> 00:34:03,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this makes my heart happy.

478
00:34:05,065 --> 00:34:10,570
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a bit of conversation heard at the Sony party.

479
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:20,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Yuji Naka apparently was basically on some, I guess, impromptu interview was admitting that there's a new Knights game in development.

480
00:34:21,823 --> 00:34:22,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

481
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about freaking time.

482
00:34:25,124 --> 00:34:28,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Just please don't let the controls suck like Sonic PS3.

483
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:32,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Sonic PS3 just hurt my heart.

484
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:33,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

485
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:36,347
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it got my worst game of E3.

486
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:37,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know.

487
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:40,388
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's saying something.

488
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:43,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that Family Feud game was god-awful.

489
00:34:43,588 --> 00:34:44,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't play that.

490
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play set games.

491
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:53,994
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is interesting is that HAL is actually taking suggestions.

492
00:34:54,354 --> 00:35:06,860
[SPEAKER_08]: They've actually put up a consumer survey on Nintendo of Japan's website and the poll is designed to let gamers help select what type of characters should be in the next Super Smash Brothers.

493
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, fanboys everywhere wet their pants when they saw that Pit and Snake were going to be in the next Super Smash Brothers.

494
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:13,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a character that you think

495
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:15,385
[SPEAKER_08]: We need Eggplant Wizard.

496
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:15,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

497
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Eggplant Wizard would be pretty rockin' too.

498
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Gosh, I'm really kind of stretched for ideas.

499
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:50,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Mother Brain playable.

500
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,331
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.

501
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:55,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Kraid might be cool.

502
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:56,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Or like one of the baddies.

503
00:35:56,973 --> 00:35:58,234
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play as a Metroid.

504
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:01,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

505
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:03,217
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like they've done a lot of good ones.

506
00:36:03,277 --> 00:36:06,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, you know, I'm glad they're just going back to Kid Icarus, honestly.

507
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,642
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've heard rumors, rumblings, that...

508
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:14,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy characters are supposed to make an appearance as well.

509
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:17,129
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, that's like a big old grain of salt.

510
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:19,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that sounds like more of a fanboy thing to me.

511
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,030
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

512
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,370
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

513
00:36:21,911 --> 00:36:30,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, after all, I mean, they did have DreamXTV World Fighters with all the Konami characters in there, including Snake.

514
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:32,937
[SPEAKER_09]: So why not add some of those characters?

515
00:36:33,097 --> 00:36:38,080
[SPEAKER_09]: In which case, they would have had... Was it Simon Belmont?

516
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,201
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember...

517
00:36:40,137 --> 00:36:45,819
[SPEAKER_09]: from, like, Hudson, since now Konami seems to publish all the Hudson games, Bomberman.

518
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,442
[SPEAKER_09]: They even had, oh, God, Yugo from, what was it?

519
00:36:54,082 --> 00:36:55,143
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I can't remember the game now.

520
00:36:55,243 --> 00:36:55,723
[SPEAKER_09]: The crappy...

521
00:36:57,554 --> 00:37:03,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta go over the chat room because they've seen some great stuff right now.

522
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:07,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeremy Todd 1 wants to point out you can always Google translate the website.

523
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:07,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

524
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,601
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're sharing some great ideas.

525
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:10,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Blackwolf says K.K.

526
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:12,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Slider could be a character.

527
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:14,823
[SPEAKER_08]: DMN says Little Mac.

528
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:18,005
[SPEAKER_08]: O2G says King Hippo.

529
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:19,606
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good idea.

530
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:21,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Spirit Stare says Reggie.

531
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,090
[SPEAKER_08]: and Reni.

532
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this idea.

533
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:28,131
[SPEAKER_08]: A Tetris piece.

534
00:37:29,732 --> 00:37:30,332
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be funny.

535
00:37:30,392 --> 00:37:31,033
[SPEAKER_08]: And Spirit Snare.

536
00:37:31,073 --> 00:37:31,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, why not?

537
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:32,493
[SPEAKER_08]: You have Mr. Game & Watch.

538
00:37:32,774 --> 00:37:34,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Spirit Snare also suggests the dog from Duck Hunt.

539
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:39,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

540
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:41,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Who hasn't wanted to kick that dog's ass?

541
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:43,759
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting a dog though in Duck Hunt, aren't we?

542
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,640
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the Smash Brothers.

543
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you imagine playing the dog?

544
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:48,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to kick that thing's ass.

545
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Here are some of the ones that they had from DreamXTV.

546
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:53,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Twinbee.

547
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:53,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

548
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

549
00:37:55,815 --> 00:38:02,558
[SPEAKER_09]: They also had Amoy Head from Gradius, which I thought was pretty interesting.

550
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:04,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Solid Snake, of course, was there.

551
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:07,981
[SPEAKER_09]: They also had Simon Belmont.

552
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:09,641
[SPEAKER_09]: These are all Konami.

553
00:38:09,761 --> 00:38:11,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, those were all Konami ones.

554
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:13,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's pretty cool.

555
00:38:15,197 --> 00:38:16,658
[SPEAKER_09]: S&K, who I have a lot of love for.

556
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:22,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it was confirmed by S&K USA's president that they are going to try to get stuff out on the Wii.

557
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:48,699
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a game for the Wii already in progress.

558
00:38:52,922 --> 00:38:55,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically they're saying they think Sony will do very well.

559
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:57,285
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying Xbox 360 will do very well.

560
00:38:57,785 --> 00:38:59,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying Xbox 360 is doing well over here.

561
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:06,791
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seems to me like they're really looking toward the Wii.

562
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:11,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And if Loki's list from Part A is to be believed, then Metal Slug Anthology is that game they're working on.

563
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:17,978
[SPEAKER_03]: SNK previously announced a Metal Slug Anthology Wii game will use the new controller.

564
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:22,562
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also working a sixth game in the Metal Slug series.

565
00:39:23,102 --> 00:39:26,345
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't necessarily show up on all of the consoles.

566
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:32,630
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying it is a 2D game, so they're not bringing it to the PS3 or Xbox 360 as it is.

567
00:39:32,811 --> 00:39:36,113
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can guarantee that it's not going to be any different than the other five.

568
00:39:36,394 --> 00:39:36,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

569
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:40,050
[SPEAKER_03]: The other games had different stuff in them when they kept releasing them.

570
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:44,573
[SPEAKER_03]: There were new characters, there were new attacks, and you had mummies.

571
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:45,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

572
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:50,077
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, SNK knows when they have a winner.

573
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:51,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to knock Metal Slug.

574
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,439
[SPEAKER_08]: It is fun, and that's what's important.

575
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:55,521
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a working formula.

576
00:39:55,941 --> 00:40:00,364
[SPEAKER_03]: They add just enough stuff to make it a little different for whoever's playing it.

577
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:04,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think that if you've got something that works, if you have something that fans like, don't fuck with it.

578
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:05,548
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

579
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:07,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Well said.

580
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:09,092
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

581
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:11,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

582
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:24,236
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're downloading a lot of crap from E3, as I'm sure you guys are, beware, guys, because if you're not downloading your stuff from a trusted website, then you might actually get some spyware hidden in there.

583
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:24,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?

584
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:29,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Spyware folks and the people that do that, in fact, one in particular is called Spy Falcon.

585
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:36,538
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a report running on gamesarefun.com where somebody actually got this bug in there downloading E3 coverage.

586
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:43,120
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess the spyware people are smartening up here and putting this stuff into, I guess, E3 videos or whatever.

587
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:50,563
[SPEAKER_08]: So please, guys, make sure you download all your E3 coverage from E3OnPSP.com because it's the only site we can trust.

588
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, everybody else puts crap in there.

589
00:40:53,944 --> 00:41:00,887
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, Macintosh folks, if you think you're safe just because you run on Mac, Spy Falcon knows how to get into your Mac too, so watch out.

590
00:41:03,871 --> 00:41:05,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Spyware pisses me off.

591
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:06,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about the rest of you.

592
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:07,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Does spyware piss you off, DarkSakura?

593
00:41:08,914 --> 00:41:11,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it piss you off enough to want to do the FUs of the week?

594
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:11,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

595
00:41:11,996 --> 00:41:13,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so, because that's what's queued up.

596
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:32,368
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to a person whose name I will not say.

597
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:42,324
[SPEAKER_03]: who decided to pug me out the last day of E3 and act like an absolute child and involve himself in something that didn't involve him.

598
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:48,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, when two people have a fight and they've resolved it, don't get emo over it.

599
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:49,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay the fuck out of it.

600
00:41:49,826 --> 00:41:50,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me for saying so.

601
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:54,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people's drama does not have to be your drama.

602
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Only children do that, okay?

603
00:41:56,407 --> 00:41:59,587
[SPEAKER_03]: So grow up and get over it and get your shoes out of my car.

604
00:42:01,048 --> 00:42:01,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

605
00:42:03,195 --> 00:42:24,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Loki, um, fuck you to whoever is behind ruining G4, because, you know, I guess I'm the last one on the face of the earth to realize that G4 is no longer a gaming network, and, you know, after, you know, browsing their section to find, oh, look, there's nine hours of non-gaming programming on there.

606
00:42:25,314 --> 00:42:29,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever, okay, so I'm a little behind the game, but mainly fucking ruining X-Play.

607
00:42:30,974 --> 00:42:41,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they've gotten lazy or what, but their review of Beatmania just pissed me off with the whole lack of knowledge in the game and just basically saying, well, it's not this game, so it gets a 2 or whatever.

608
00:42:41,406 --> 00:42:44,390
[SPEAKER_09]: So, fuck them for being lazy now.

609
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:47,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Made the whole network burn to hell.

610
00:42:47,213 --> 00:42:47,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

611
00:42:50,585 --> 00:42:51,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, my F.U.

612
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:53,868
[SPEAKER_08]: of the week goes to Jelly Bellies.

613
00:42:54,568 --> 00:43:00,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, for one, they're really addicting, and, like, they're hella good and make me fat, but that's not why I'm giving them the F.U.

614
00:43:00,493 --> 00:43:01,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm giving them the F.U.

615
00:43:01,353 --> 00:43:09,419
[SPEAKER_08]: because I bought this thing at the Jelly Bellies store, and it's the Hot Buttered Popcorn, and it's this case, and Buttered Popcorn Jelly Bellies are my favorite.

616
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,480
[SPEAKER_08]: They're so good.

617
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know a lot of people think they're gross, but you suck, because Buttered Popcorn is the best.

618
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:15,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually...

619
00:43:15,842 --> 00:43:17,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Next to Toasted Marshmallow.

620
00:43:17,823 --> 00:43:18,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Buttered popcorn is the best.

621
00:43:19,204 --> 00:43:22,245
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the thing, I bought this because it was on sale for $5.

622
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:24,686
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, cool, that's a lot of buttered popcorn jelly beans.

623
00:43:25,007 --> 00:43:27,528
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like filling up here with all these jelly beans.

624
00:43:27,908 --> 00:43:29,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I come home and I open it.

625
00:43:30,365 --> 00:43:34,048
[SPEAKER_08]: And the damn thing is filled almost to the brim with styrofoam.

626
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:39,012
[SPEAKER_08]: There was only a handful of buttered popcorn jelly beans to fill out the top of that thing.

627
00:43:39,052 --> 00:43:40,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize we're not on TV.

628
00:43:40,293 --> 00:43:41,053
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't see that.

629
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:46,698
[SPEAKER_08]: But like an inch of that was filled with jelly beans to give the illusion.

630
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:47,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

631
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:49,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have known when I picked the damn thing up.

632
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:54,461
[SPEAKER_08]: That it didn't feel full, but I guess, I don't know, because the styrofoam's in there, it feels weighted.

633
00:43:54,481 --> 00:43:55,902
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty false advertising right there.

634
00:43:55,962 --> 00:43:56,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that pissed me off.

635
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:58,142
[SPEAKER_08]: No wonder it was discounted.

636
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:03,784
[SPEAKER_08]: It was five, so for five bucks I got a handful of jelly beans in this useless fucking tin I will never do anything with.

637
00:44:03,864 --> 00:44:04,224
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

638
00:44:04,244 --> 00:44:06,225
[SPEAKER_08]: But look at it every day to remind me how much I hate it.

639
00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:07,705
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll fill it with Jelly Bellies for you.

640
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:08,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray!

641
00:44:09,086 --> 00:44:10,806
[SPEAKER_08]: No, don't do that, because Jelly Bellies make me fat.

642
00:44:11,586 --> 00:44:14,727
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Jelly Bellies don't make you fat, it's eating the Jelly Bellies that makes you fat.

643
00:44:14,967 --> 00:44:16,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is your decision.

644
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:16,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

645
00:44:21,068 --> 00:44:22,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew, gross, DT.

646
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:23,150
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

647
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Bringing up freaking super bacon.

648
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:25,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Disgusting.

649
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:27,033
[SPEAKER_08]: They have bacon jelly bellies.

650
00:44:27,073 --> 00:44:27,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you believe that?

651
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:28,474
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nasty.

652
00:44:28,534 --> 00:44:31,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I almost bought wild blackberry jelly bellies at the Winchester Mystery House.

653
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:32,577
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nasty.

654
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:34,238
[SPEAKER_03]: But coconut's my favorite.

655
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:35,098
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki.

656
00:44:36,055 --> 00:44:37,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's also a Jelly Belly eater, right?

657
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:38,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like Jelly Bellies.

658
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:39,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

659
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really like Jelly Beans anymore.

660
00:44:41,042 --> 00:44:45,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to eat them as a kid, but, you know, I'm just not really a huge fan of Jelly Beans anymore.

661
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:47,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, um... Naughty people at E3!

662
00:44:48,392 --> 00:44:49,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Naughty, naughty people!

663
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:53,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking... Hey, dude, seriously, um... NCSoft, they have the...

664
00:44:53,863 --> 00:44:54,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching.

665
00:44:54,784 --> 00:44:55,464
[SPEAKER_09]: See you next time.

666
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:11,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you did.

667
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:12,536
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I did not.

668
00:45:12,556 --> 00:45:13,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go back and play.

669
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:16,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I could almost swear you named Sega your booth at the show.

670
00:45:16,938 --> 00:45:17,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

671
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:19,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it had Full Auto 2 and stuff.

672
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm almost positive you named Sega your booth at the show.

673
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:22,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't really care.

674
00:45:22,842 --> 00:45:23,963
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I said Capcom had good 360 games.

675
00:45:24,023 --> 00:45:24,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, whatever.

676
00:45:24,503 --> 00:45:24,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

677
00:45:24,743 --> 00:45:34,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, so like little whiny bitches, they went and complained to the E3 management who, I don't even know how the hell you can determine that a, you know,

678
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:36,010
[SPEAKER_09]: A booth is too noisy.

679
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:37,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently they registered the decibels.

680
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:42,773
[SPEAKER_09]: It was two decibels above, you know, where it should be, so they had to pay $5,000 for that.

681
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:48,215
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, NCSoft said, fuck it, who cares, we're going to play our music as loud as we want.

682
00:45:49,576 --> 00:45:52,798
[SPEAKER_09]: And they did that, so... Yes.

683
00:45:52,898 --> 00:45:54,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock on, you guys.

684
00:45:54,058 --> 00:45:59,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Sega gets my whiny pussy of E3 awards, so... Way to go.

685
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:01,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, um...

686
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony, changing gears completely here.

687
00:46:07,314 --> 00:46:14,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony, this is interesting because if you think about the PSP, they have tried to prevent homebrew so many times.

688
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,007
[SPEAKER_08]: They keep patching the damn thing over and over and they won't give up.

689
00:46:17,368 --> 00:46:21,253
[SPEAKER_08]: But yet they are embracing homebrew on the PlayStation 3.

690
00:46:22,935 --> 00:46:30,620
[SPEAKER_08]: The system development manager, Izumi Kwanishi, says that the console is going to ship with Linux built-in, so you don't have to bother to figure out how to install it.

691
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:37,525
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be already installed on there, and Sony is saying, hey, homebrew folks, go ahead and develop for this.

692
00:46:37,585 --> 00:46:38,245
[SPEAKER_08]: This would be awesome.

693
00:46:38,585 --> 00:46:45,070
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, Sony will not be providing technical support or access to SDK libraries, but Linux support is there.

694
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,182
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very strange policy when you consider the PSP.

695
00:46:49,202 --> 00:46:52,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that they put a free operating system on their hard drives.

696
00:46:52,584 --> 00:46:54,205
[SPEAKER_08]: How very thoughtful of them.

697
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:59,268
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what will be interesting about this?

698
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:02,750
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought of this just now.

699
00:47:04,751 --> 00:47:09,434
[SPEAKER_08]: In a roundabout way, could this just be a big F you to the virtual console?

700
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:11,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Because just run a Linux emulator.

701
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,277
[SPEAKER_08]: There you got all the old school games you want.

702
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:24,434
[SPEAKER_08]: If somebody perfects their Linux emulator, like NES emulator, for the PlayStation, did you think maybe Sony had this forethought when they saw that people were making this on the PSP?

703
00:47:24,774 --> 00:47:27,195
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because they had Linux on PlayStation 2 as well.

704
00:47:27,355 --> 00:47:29,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you think Sony kind of realizes this is what's going to happen?

705
00:47:29,936 --> 00:47:31,296
[SPEAKER_08]: People are going to make emulators on this?

706
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:32,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

707
00:47:33,697 --> 00:47:33,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

708
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:36,218
[SPEAKER_09]: They're little bitches.

709
00:47:36,558 --> 00:47:37,679
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it comes down to.

710
00:47:38,871 --> 00:47:39,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking little wine bitch.

711
00:47:40,072 --> 00:47:41,392
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing, Sony.

712
00:47:41,432 --> 00:47:44,934
[SPEAKER_09]: People gotta buy your console before they can program emulators for it.

713
00:47:45,134 --> 00:47:46,575
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a win-win situation for Sony.

714
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:49,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they gotta buy them first.

715
00:47:49,737 --> 00:47:50,457
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the problem, though.

716
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:54,339
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the major problem, is getting people to buy your console.

717
00:47:54,379 --> 00:47:55,219
[SPEAKER_08]: People will buy it.

718
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, uh, Loki.

719
00:47:59,742 --> 00:48:02,083
[SPEAKER_08]: How about that Nintendo Wii?

720
00:48:02,223 --> 00:48:03,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that have Linux on it?

721
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:05,364
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it doesn't have Linux on it.

722
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:06,325
[SPEAKER_09]: But,

723
00:48:07,388 --> 00:48:12,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, apparently the E3 ones were running off of quasi-GameCube hardware.

724
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:16,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, they were housed in GameCubes and stuff, which is not surprising.

725
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's a fucking dev kit it's running off of.

726
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:21,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course it's gonna be, you know, it's sort of based on the GameCube anyway.

727
00:48:21,511 --> 00:48:22,912
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not really a big surprise.

728
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:26,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get why this is such a huge uproar in the community right now.

729
00:48:26,192 --> 00:48:28,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, OMG, the Wii was running off of GameCubes.

730
00:48:28,653 --> 00:48:28,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

731
00:48:30,276 --> 00:48:31,317
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

732
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:47,551
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

733
00:49:11,653 --> 00:49:16,298
[SPEAKER_08]: BlackWolf liked to clarify the hardware was Wii, the box it was housed in was just a GameCube.

734
00:49:16,478 --> 00:49:17,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, makes sense.

735
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,001
[SPEAKER_08]: But why is this a problem?

736
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are people blogging about this?

737
00:49:21,843 --> 00:49:22,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares anyways?

738
00:49:22,684 --> 00:49:23,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a giant fucking case.

739
00:49:24,025 --> 00:49:27,048
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be the size of a giraffe.

740
00:49:27,148 --> 00:49:27,709
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't matter.

741
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:29,510
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course it wasn't GameCube hardware.

742
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Their games were actually widescreen.

743
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:37,491
[SPEAKER_08]: GameCube never really... I mean, there's a couple games on GameCube that'll do widescreen, but shit, hardly any.

744
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:41,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, now our chatroom, www.orange.com, click on chat.

745
00:49:41,332 --> 00:49:45,654
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just going off on the Linux thing, and they're talking about everything you can install Linux on.

746
00:49:46,614 --> 00:49:48,474
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ PooEater says, Linux on a jelly belly.

747
00:49:48,954 --> 00:49:49,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Bastard.

748
00:49:50,015 --> 00:49:52,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, they put Linux on a toaster.

749
00:49:52,095 --> 00:49:52,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

750
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:54,116
[SPEAKER_08]: And Roz says, Linux on a plane.

751
00:49:55,436 --> 00:49:55,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

752
00:49:55,916 --> 00:49:56,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-huh.

753
00:49:56,316 --> 00:49:56,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

754
00:49:56,757 --> 00:49:57,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

755
00:49:59,631 --> 00:50:00,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make the joke first.

756
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:03,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Linux on Ridge Racer.

757
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,694
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually somebody already beat you to that.

758
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:05,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it!

759
00:50:05,835 --> 00:50:06,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Linux in Africa.

760
00:50:07,956 --> 00:50:08,457
Africa.

761
00:50:08,697 --> 00:50:09,097
Africa.

762
00:50:09,557 --> 00:50:12,559
[SPEAKER_03]: With a K. Africa with a K. Linux 2, Linux in Africa.

763
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,461
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell was Africa?

764
00:50:15,361 --> 00:50:16,082
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.

765
00:50:16,102 --> 00:50:17,703
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a monstrous digging up dirt game.

766
00:50:18,763 --> 00:50:20,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping it's Pokemon Snap, but in Africa.

767
00:50:21,225 --> 00:50:24,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it's like, you know, Big Game Hunter, you know, Poacher.

768
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:25,568
[SPEAKER_09]: You are messed up.

769
00:50:26,168 --> 00:50:26,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Big Game Poacher.

770
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:28,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Rhino Hunter.

771
00:50:29,881 --> 00:50:32,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, now let's talk about Xbox 360.

772
00:50:32,264 --> 00:50:36,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumors abound that the Xbox 360 is going to get a Final Fantasy title as well.

773
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:49,541
[SPEAKER_08]: The 360 is supposedly going to get one of the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII, because you know it's a series here, is that there's two of them on the PlayStation 3, and then one of them on the mobile phone.

774
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's the interesting thing.

775
00:50:52,941 --> 00:50:57,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Supposedly, they've actually even trademarked a new name with Final Fantasy XIII.

776
00:50:58,185 --> 00:50:58,466
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

777
00:50:59,146 --> 00:51:02,929
[SPEAKER_08]: So that there's another sub-game that might be out on the 360.

778
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:03,529
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

779
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:04,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

780
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that crazy?

781
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:06,372
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

782
00:51:07,352 --> 00:51:07,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Release one.

783
00:51:07,953 --> 00:51:08,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's Squeenix.

784
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:10,893
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell?

785
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:11,714
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

786
00:51:12,055 --> 00:51:13,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... Oh my god.

787
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:13,958
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird.

788
00:51:14,018 --> 00:51:18,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... You know, we don't know enough about the series yet to know if this is justifiable or not.

789
00:51:18,085 --> 00:51:21,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I know the mobile game is not going to be justifiable under any circumstances.

790
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:21,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta buy them all.

791
00:51:22,052 --> 00:51:22,212
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

792
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:26,703
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm curious to see what is in the works of the other ones.

793
00:51:26,943 --> 00:51:36,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, the 360 thing is just a rumor at this stage, you guys, and sounds like it might be a little bit of hopeful MSFanboy thinking, but at the same time, it's not impossible.

794
00:51:36,646 --> 00:51:37,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XI's on 360.

795
00:51:37,906 --> 00:51:40,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard that it might be on the live arcade.

796
00:51:41,628 --> 00:51:42,848
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be very interesting.

797
00:51:42,948 --> 00:51:45,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you support the phone game to the live arcade or something?

798
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:46,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Make it better.

799
00:51:46,909 --> 00:51:47,789
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a better idea.

800
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:52,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't they just create Ironhander 2 instead?

801
00:51:53,775 --> 00:51:54,336
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura,

802
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,715
[SPEAKER_08]: But make sure you have good reception, because I hate it when we get bad sales.

803
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:21,100
[SPEAKER_08]: But the better way to call on the show is to use the Skype line, and that is Skype username OrangeLoungeRadio.

804
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:23,903
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be opening up right after this story.

805
00:52:23,963 --> 00:52:24,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

806
00:52:24,483 --> 00:52:27,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And be sure to also call Echo123 first.

807
00:52:27,866 --> 00:52:30,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, call Echo123 first if you're using Skype.

808
00:52:31,969 --> 00:52:32,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

809
00:52:33,371 --> 00:52:33,611
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

810
00:52:36,513 --> 00:52:37,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of games coming out.

811
00:52:38,972 --> 00:52:45,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom saying that they're going to have both Resident Evil 5 and Devil May Cry 4 playable at Tokyo Game Show this year.

812
00:52:46,138 --> 00:52:47,159
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's excellent.

813
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:48,140
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get to see that.

814
00:52:49,621 --> 00:52:54,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, that's just in time for the PlayStation 3 launch in a few months afterwards.

815
00:52:55,186 --> 00:52:56,988
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm sure those aren't going to be launch titles.

816
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,111
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, more games!

817
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:01,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't knock that.

818
00:53:01,472 --> 00:53:01,812
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

819
00:53:01,832 --> 00:53:03,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I was really impressed with their games.

820
00:53:04,771 --> 00:53:07,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Lost Planet, and Dead Rising is here.

821
00:53:07,633 --> 00:53:09,074
[SPEAKER_08]: That Dead Rising game sounds hella fun.

822
00:53:09,114 --> 00:53:09,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sad I missed it.

823
00:53:09,675 --> 00:53:10,435
[SPEAKER_08]: More power to it.

824
00:53:10,495 --> 00:53:12,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard other podcasts talking about it.

825
00:53:12,136 --> 00:53:14,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Rising is really fun.

826
00:53:15,739 --> 00:53:17,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely got to check it out.

827
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,742
[SPEAKER_09]: It lived up to my expectations of it.

828
00:53:21,423 --> 00:53:21,803
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait.

829
00:53:23,564 --> 00:53:29,087
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, our Skype line is open over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

830
00:53:29,868 --> 00:53:31,168
[SPEAKER_08]: You can call us right now.

831
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:35,831
[SPEAKER_08]: The username is OrangeloungeRadio, or you can pick up the phone and call 916-226-9067.

832
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:40,054
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have voicemail on there, so you can call any time during the week and leave us a voicemail if you want.

833
00:53:41,414 --> 00:53:42,695
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you don't, I'm not going to force you.

834
00:53:43,736 --> 00:53:44,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on OrangeloungeRadio.

835
00:53:45,697 --> 00:53:47,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is RavensDolphin.

836
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:48,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, RavensDolphin, what's on your mind?

837
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:52,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the all-game thing...

838
00:53:53,635 --> 00:53:54,376
[SPEAKER_08]: The All Games thing?

839
00:54:10,222 --> 00:54:14,385
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think of Alon from Chatterbox Game Show?

840
00:54:31,693 --> 00:54:35,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but he came off of an asshole, but I listen to his show every day.

841
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:37,856
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't know how he came out like that.

842
00:54:38,756 --> 00:54:42,398
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, sometimes people just have... I'm going to be bluntly honest.

843
00:54:42,758 --> 00:54:48,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had very little time to listen to other podcasts, and his is one of them that's on my... I want to listen to it, but I haven't yet.

844
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:53,583
[SPEAKER_08]: But remember that sometimes people come off on the radio a lot different than they do in real life.

845
00:54:53,963 --> 00:54:56,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if you ever watched that movie about Howard Stern...

846
00:54:56,724 --> 00:54:57,245
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

847
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:16,140
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't sound too good.

848
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,282
[SPEAKER_05]: He seemed like he was aggravated to death.

849
00:55:19,642 --> 00:55:21,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I got to shift this topic, guy.

850
00:55:21,703 --> 00:55:23,764
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to knock other podcasts, especially independent.

851
00:55:23,784 --> 00:55:24,905
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I'm not knocking them.

852
00:55:25,065 --> 00:55:25,365
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

853
00:55:25,705 --> 00:55:25,925
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

854
00:55:25,965 --> 00:55:26,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what else is on your mind?

855
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:29,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

856
00:55:29,707 --> 00:55:30,608
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is on my mind?

857
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:32,149
[SPEAKER_05]: The PSPs, WTF.

858
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:34,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, that game was great.

859
00:55:35,785 --> 00:55:39,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a lot of MarioWare minigames coming out.

860
00:55:39,486 --> 00:55:41,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I cut the bunnies very much.

861
00:55:41,086 --> 00:55:42,146
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's really sad, though?

862
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:43,706
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to be named WTF.

863
00:55:43,926 --> 00:55:44,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

864
00:55:44,546 --> 00:55:45,647
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to put it in our system.

865
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:47,027
[SPEAKER_09]: It's WFF now.

866
00:55:47,067 --> 00:55:47,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Watch.

867
00:55:47,747 --> 00:55:48,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Work for fun.

868
00:55:49,327 --> 00:55:49,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Aw, lame.

869
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:50,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

870

[SPEAKER_09]: It's retarded.

871
00:55:51,588 --> 00:55:52,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Freaking Americans.

872
00:55:53,668 --> 00:55:57,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted WTF so I can say I got what the fuck.

873
00:55:59,269 --> 00:55:59,669
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

874
00:56:01,689 --> 00:56:02,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to share?

875
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:04,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

876
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:05,110
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

877
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:10,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, do you... No, I'm just going to hang up.

878
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:11,246
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

879
00:56:11,966 --> 00:56:12,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, buddy.

880
00:56:13,147 --> 00:56:13,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer.

00:56:16,048 --> 00:56:16,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Please let us die.

[SPEAKER_08]: No, it says it in his bio.

884
00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:18,949
[SPEAKER_08]: It says Ridge Racer.

885
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:21,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Couldn't resist.

886
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

887
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:25,772
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as I cost, you get my own theme song.

888
00:56:26,913 --> 00:56:28,473
[SPEAKER_01]: La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

889
00:56:28,573 --> 00:56:29,034
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

[SPEAKER_08]: Not much, it's the one and only Ranma.

00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:37,842
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you guys doing?

894
00:56:37,902 --> 00:56:38,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, Ranma.

895
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:39,463
[SPEAKER_03]: He's my cosplay buddy.

896
00:56:41,824 --> 00:56:45,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Why aren't you coming to Faname?

897
00:56:45,427 --> 00:56:45,407
2007.

898
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:46,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, fair enough.

899
00:56:47,008 --> 00:56:47,808
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

900
00:56:48,148 --> 00:56:49,029
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you calling about tonight?

901
00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:50,069
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple things.

902
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:52,431
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, I want to say congratulations for Loki for getting married.

903
00:56:53,712 --> 00:56:54,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

904
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:56,794
[SPEAKER_07]: May the gods have mercy on your soul.

905
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:00,356
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a nice girl.

906
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,797
[SPEAKER_08]: She hates games, but she's a nice girl.

907
00:57:03,177 --> 00:57:04,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, she's not a nice girl, but she's funny.

908
00:57:05,118 --> 00:57:06,880
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what makes it worth it.

909
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Good enough, good enough.

910
00:57:09,061 --> 00:57:09,342
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

911
00:57:09,602 --> 00:57:11,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have anything game-related you want to ask about?

912
00:57:11,443 --> 00:57:13,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a couple of things.

913
00:57:13,284 --> 00:57:13,565
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

914
00:57:14,045 --> 00:57:18,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I was at Nintendo World for E3 2006 press conference, and I have tons of pictures to that.

915
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:20,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, where are they going to be at?

916
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,912
[SPEAKER_07]: On my website that I'm posting right now.

917
00:57:24,293 --> 00:57:26,814
[SPEAKER_08]: In the chat room there, it looks like DJRanmaS.net.

918
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:28,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Follow the linky links once you get in there.

919
00:57:29,952 --> 00:57:31,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and it was pretty awesome.

920
00:57:31,593 --> 00:57:35,735
[SPEAKER_07]: After the whole presentation, they had like a party to celebrate the one year anniversary.

921
00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:38,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they had like a nice VIP party at the end.

922
00:57:39,478 --> 00:57:39,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

923
00:57:41,019 --> 00:57:45,721
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have more pictures of me at Nintendo World meeting Reggie Phil's aims.

924
00:57:46,402 --> 00:57:53,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, wait, before we get into you meeting Reggie, did the catering at the Nintendo party have those potato things with bacon and cheddar in them?

925
00:57:54,497 --> 00:58:01,722
[SPEAKER_07]: No, all we had was like quote-unquote like phony like alcoholic drinks, but they were just regular soda and crap like that.

926
00:58:01,782 --> 00:58:03,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, because E3 Outpost had the potato things.

927
00:58:03,863 --> 00:58:04,964
[SPEAKER_08]: He was at the Nintendo party?

928
00:58:05,004 --> 00:58:05,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Delicious.

929
00:58:06,224 --> 00:58:09,006
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he was at the store on the East Coast.

930
00:58:09,647 --> 00:58:13,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you know how at E3 Outpost we had like a viewing party that was like all the podcasters watching it?

931
00:58:13,849 --> 00:58:15,851
[SPEAKER_08]: That was what they did, but at the store.

932
00:58:17,351 --> 00:58:20,914
[SPEAKER_07]: They had like these mini tacos, quesadillas, and mini hamburgers and stuff.

933
00:58:20,994 --> 00:58:22,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Enough about food.

934
00:58:22,154 --> 00:58:22,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about Reggie.

935
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:26,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked him why.

936
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:27,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked him.

937
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,811
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, we is everything.

938
00:58:30,951 --> 00:58:32,112
[SPEAKER_07]: We is all about us.

939
00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:33,352
[SPEAKER_07]: We is awesome.

940
00:58:33,892 --> 00:58:35,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I wanted to smack him for saying that.

941
00:58:36,553 --> 00:58:37,673
[SPEAKER_08]: We is awesome.

942
00:58:38,674 --> 00:58:38,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

943
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:42,355
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

944
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:43,815
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a really odd response.

945
00:58:43,855 --> 00:58:45,876
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like a textbook response to me.

946
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:52,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Like in the FAQs for a PR person, here's what to say when asked this question.

947
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:55,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Did it sound a little textbook to you when he said it?

948
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:57,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Very much so.

949
00:58:59,151 --> 00:58:59,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

950
00:58:59,832 --> 00:59:00,152
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

951
00:59:01,353 --> 00:59:03,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to share about your experiences there at the store?

952
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:05,617
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was pretty much fun.

953
00:59:05,737 --> 00:59:13,144
[SPEAKER_07]: It was crowded, and I could have heard people crapping their pants after seeing the whole presentation, especially for me for seeing Starbucks.

954
00:59:13,164 --> 00:59:13,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

955
00:59:13,745 --> 00:59:19,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Put all those Nintendo fanboys under one roof, and it must have just smelled awful by the time it was over.

956
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:21,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Lord, you have no idea.

957
00:59:22,251 --> 00:59:23,232
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

958
00:59:23,752 --> 00:59:26,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Even us at the Outpost were kind of going, ooh, ah, interesting.

959
00:59:26,634 --> 00:59:30,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And when the Star Fox thing came up, we were like, damn, neat, cool.

960
00:59:30,957 --> 00:59:33,078
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get more calls in, okay?

961
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:34,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

962
00:59:34,059 --> 00:59:34,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one, buddy.

963
00:59:34,759 --> 00:59:36,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell Reggie we said hi next time.

964
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:37,421
[SPEAKER_08]: That I will.

965
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:38,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Love the hair.

966
00:59:38,322 --> 00:59:38,562
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

967
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:38,902
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

968
00:59:40,589 --> 00:59:41,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to another call.

969
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

970
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:43,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

971
00:59:44,051 --> 00:59:45,032
[SPEAKER_08]: This is DMN.

972
00:59:45,112 --> 00:59:46,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, DMN.

973
00:59:46,152 --> 00:59:46,713
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

974
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:49,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, first of all, exclusive announcement.

975
00:59:50,335 --> 00:59:50,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

976
00:59:51,515 --> 00:59:54,117
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to remake Portal Runner on the DS.

977
00:59:54,537 --> 00:59:55,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

978
00:59:55,498 --> 00:59:55,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.

979
00:59:56,378 --> 00:59:56,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Nerd.

980
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:06,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I was calling... Crap, I completely lost my train of thought.

981
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:07,746
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

982
01:00:07,766 --> 01:00:10,287
[SPEAKER_08]: We do that all the time in hosting the show.

983
01:00:14,008 --> 01:00:14,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Take a moment.

984
01:00:14,628 --> 01:00:15,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Collect your thoughts.

985
01:00:15,469 --> 01:00:15,689
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

986
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:17,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely drew a blank.

987
01:00:18,109 --> 01:00:18,650
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

988
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:19,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Take a moment.

989
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:20,770
[SPEAKER_08]: We take a moment to meditate.

990
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:21,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Work on your brain there.

991
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:22,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Collect your thoughts.

992
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:26,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

993
01:00:26,732 --> 01:00:27,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you think of it yet?

994
01:00:27,973 --> 01:00:28,293
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

995
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, call us back when you think of it.

996
01:00:30,273 --> 01:00:30,653
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

997
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:31,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

998
01:00:31,234 --> 01:00:31,874
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all right.

999
01:00:31,934 --> 01:00:32,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1000
01:00:34,252 --> 01:00:35,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Live radio, kids.

1001
01:00:35,194 --> 01:00:35,775
[SPEAKER_08]: We tape live.

1002
01:00:35,995 --> 01:00:36,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to this call.

1003
01:00:36,737 --> 01:00:37,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1004
01:00:37,879 --> 01:00:38,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1005
01:00:39,382 --> 01:00:40,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Sky.

1006
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,925
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Spirit Snare.

1007
01:00:41,085 --> 01:00:41,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Spirit Snare.

1008
01:00:41,927 --> 01:00:42,448
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1009
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:45,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing much.

1010
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:51,672
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, am I the only one in the chat who's going to stand in base?

1011
01:00:52,052 --> 01:01:04,197
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I guess so, because a lot of our chatters are from all around, and they're all too cheap to travel or can't afford it or whatever, so you might be the only... I hope we have more than one person that shows up at the panel, though, or I'll be sad.

1012
01:01:06,398 --> 01:01:08,138
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've got to help us advertise.

1013
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:09,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Get word out at the con.

1014
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:13,703
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what kind of chocolate do you like most?

1015
01:01:13,723 --> 01:01:15,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I need to give you that at a

1016
01:01:40,413 --> 01:01:41,794
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you said, what chocolate?

1017
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:42,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you asked?

1018
01:01:42,614 --> 01:01:43,335
[SPEAKER_03]: What chocolate?

1019
01:01:45,876 --> 01:01:46,576
[SPEAKER_08]: You broke up there.

1020
01:01:46,976 --> 01:01:47,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that the question?

1021
01:01:47,657 --> 01:01:48,277
[SPEAKER_08]: What chocolate?

1022
01:01:49,578 --> 01:01:51,959
[SPEAKER_08]: No, what kind of chocolate do you like best?

1023
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:55,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember a couple episodes ago you were saying they have to... Right, I said chocolate.

1024
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:57,102
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1025
01:01:57,202 --> 01:02:02,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a big fan of dark chocolate, especially anything that's 75% cocoa.

1026
01:02:03,445 --> 01:02:04,205
[SPEAKER_08]: What kind of brands?

1027
01:02:04,305 --> 01:02:04,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Give a hint.

1028
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:07,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Drost, Lindt.

1029
01:02:08,717 --> 01:02:10,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically the Belgian brand.

1030
01:02:10,678 --> 01:02:11,659
[SPEAKER_03]: L-I-N-D-T.

1031
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:12,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't blame you, man.

1032
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,721
[SPEAKER_03]: L-I-N-D-T.

1033
01:02:15,221 --> 01:02:16,822
[SPEAKER_03]: But Josta is one of my favorites.

1034
01:02:16,882 --> 01:02:20,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Those truffles are like crack.

1035
01:02:20,464 --> 01:02:27,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I only eat dark chocolate because milk chocolate is kind of not good for you and white chocolate is made out of the leftover milk fat when they make regular chocolate.

1036
01:02:27,669 --> 01:02:30,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is it that every fucking week this show turns into the Food Network?

1037
01:02:33,581 --> 01:02:34,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1038
01:02:34,682 --> 01:02:35,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Without fail.

1039
01:02:35,803 --> 01:02:40,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I must say, though, that when it comes to chocolate, I am a big fan of dark, dark chocolate.

1040
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:44,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thank you for appeasing my chocolate craving.

1041
01:02:45,672 --> 01:02:46,292
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.

1042
01:02:46,773 --> 01:02:47,613
[SPEAKER_03]: You're my hero now.

1043
01:02:47,854 --> 01:02:48,154
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1044
01:02:48,394 --> 01:02:48,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1045
01:02:49,135 --> 01:02:50,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Spirit Snare, anything else on your mind?

1046
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:51,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

1047
01:02:51,937 --> 01:02:52,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Five more days.

1048
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:53,679
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1049
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:55,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Five more days.

1050
01:02:55,528 --> 01:02:56,088
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1051
01:02:56,128 --> 01:03:01,232
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you get to meet us in the flesh and be disappointed with our underwhelming presence in person.

1052
01:03:01,633 --> 01:03:01,813
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1053
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:03,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one, Spirit Snare.

1054
01:03:03,254 --> 01:03:03,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1055
01:03:03,915 --> 01:03:04,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

1056
01:03:04,295 --> 01:03:04,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

1057
01:03:04,575 --> 01:03:04,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.

1058
01:03:05,336 --> 01:03:05,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.

1059
01:03:07,738 --> 01:03:08,759
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting a call over here.

1060
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:10,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

1061
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:11,821
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1062
01:03:12,162 --> 01:03:12,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1063
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

1064
01:03:13,263 --> 01:03:15,104
[SPEAKER_10]: I remembered what I wanted to talk about.

1065
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:15,424
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1066
01:03:15,464 --> 01:03:16,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back.

1067
01:03:16,265 --> 01:03:16,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back.

1068
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:17,246
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?

1069
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:21,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I was seeing if you guys were interested in something.

1070
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:21,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1071
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:23,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Work at Nintendo.

1072
01:03:23,417 --> 01:03:24,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I do get the Wii early.

1073
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:36,804
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was wondering if the listeners and you guys would be interested in me buying one out of my own pocket, donating it to OLR, and you guys giving it away on the launch date.

1074
01:03:37,664 --> 01:03:38,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yes.

1075
01:03:39,825 --> 01:03:39,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1076
01:03:40,766 --> 01:03:43,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, what's the deal here?

1077
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:44,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have to give you something out of this?

1078
01:03:44,968 --> 01:03:45,088
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1079
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:48,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we get to play it first?

1080
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:52,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if we get it early, we're going to crack that shit open and play with it.

1081
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:57,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess you guys can give away a quote-unquote slightly used Wii console.

1082
01:03:57,841 --> 01:03:59,081
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll autograph it or something.

1083
01:03:59,101 --> 01:03:59,682
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll make it special.

1084
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:01,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'll be the special OLR edition Wii.

1085
01:04:02,663 --> 01:04:03,143
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we'll do.

1086
01:04:03,183 --> 01:04:05,284
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get out an orange highlighter and color it orange.

1087
01:04:05,605 --> 01:04:06,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw that.

1088
01:04:06,405 --> 01:04:07,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll spray paint it.

1089
01:04:07,085 --> 01:04:07,946
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1090
01:04:07,966 --> 01:04:11,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll spray paint the Wii and we'll give away the world's only orange Wii.

1091
01:04:11,387 --> 01:04:11,888
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be great.

1092
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:13,068
[SPEAKER_10]: It would work.

1093
01:04:13,088 --> 01:04:17,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, in regards to the launch date, I don't think it's going to be October.

1094
01:04:18,471 --> 01:04:19,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, why is that?

1095
01:04:20,712 --> 01:04:23,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing as it's an October launch date,

1096
01:04:23,914 --> 01:04:27,096
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't seen any titles come into my department yet.

1097
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:31,500
[SPEAKER_10]: If it comes out in October, that gives us less than six months to test the console.

1098
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,482
[SPEAKER_10]: And we would probably be a bit rushed by that.

1099
01:04:34,762 --> 01:04:37,804
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would probably say shoot more for November.

1100
01:04:38,044 --> 01:04:39,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you guys test those E3 demos?

1101
01:04:41,227 --> 01:04:42,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally did not.

1102
01:04:43,148 --> 01:04:48,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the screw with some of them because the company has their own little mini E3 at Nintendo.

1103
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:52,735
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did not personally test any of the Wii demos.

1104
01:04:53,086 --> 01:04:53,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1105
01:04:54,006 --> 01:04:55,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

1106
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:56,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe there'll be a lot of overtime coming.

1107
01:04:57,108 --> 01:05:00,889
[SPEAKER_08]: The evidence for October is still pretty good, the way we're looking at it.

1108
01:05:00,989 --> 01:05:06,031
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, we're not necessarily claiming that is the definitive date.

1109
01:05:06,051 --> 01:05:08,893
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just saying, hey, here's some evidence that makes it look pretty strong.

1110
01:05:09,193 --> 01:05:10,013
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be October.

1111
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,153
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, you bring up a good point.

1112
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:14,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe you'll get it in next week.

1113
01:05:15,835 --> 01:05:16,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully.

1114
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:16,776
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1115
01:05:17,076 --> 01:05:17,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we've got to go.

1116
01:05:17,656 --> 01:05:18,757
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take one more call, okay?

1117
01:05:18,777 --> 01:05:19,397
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1118
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:19,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, guys.

1119
01:05:20,057 --> 01:05:20,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1120
01:05:21,198 --> 01:05:21,398
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1121
01:05:21,478 --> 01:05:21,998
[SPEAKER_08]: One last call.

1122
01:05:22,659 --> 01:05:23,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1123
01:05:25,141 --> 01:05:25,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1124
01:05:26,842 --> 01:05:30,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Nintendo MX64, I just wanted to talk about a little bit of things.

1125
01:05:31,186 --> 01:05:32,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, make it quick, what's up?

1126
01:05:33,428 --> 01:05:36,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, hang on, let me turn down volume stream.

1127
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on to what?

1128
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:37,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do, you guys.

1129
01:05:38,032 --> 01:05:38,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1130
01:05:39,693 --> 01:05:40,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

1131
01:05:40,614 --> 01:05:41,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we can, what's up?

1132
01:05:43,336 --> 01:05:45,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh crap, I turned down the volume on the entire thing.

1133
01:05:45,598 --> 01:05:46,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1134
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:47,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1135
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:48,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you there?

1136
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:50,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Technical Difficulties

1137
01:06:07,253 --> 01:06:20,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because in three weeks I'll be going to New York for this art show that my sister's in, and we're not going to take our van with TV and stuff that I normally play video games with, because where are you going to park in New York?

1138
01:06:21,657 --> 01:06:22,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Parking garages.

1139
01:06:22,597 --> 01:06:22,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

1140
01:06:22,857 --> 01:06:23,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Our van's not going to fit.

1141
01:06:23,918 --> 01:06:24,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point.

1142
01:06:25,658 --> 01:06:28,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was going to take my laptop and stuff and do games on there.

1143
01:06:31,198 --> 01:06:32,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played it before, yeah.

1144
01:06:56,286 --> 01:06:57,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.

1145
01:06:58,787 --> 01:07:01,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I mentioned a couple.

1146
01:07:01,968 --> 01:07:04,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I remember some phone call talking about this a while back.

1147
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:07,970
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we got to let you go.

1148
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:08,690
[SPEAKER_08]: We're wrapping up.

1149
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:11,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's fine.

1150
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:13,512
[SPEAKER_08]: What is with people forgetting tonight?

1151
01:07:13,532 --> 01:07:14,772
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, have a good one.

1152
01:07:15,352 --> 01:07:16,713
[SPEAKER_08]: What is with people forgetting tonight?

1153
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:17,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Something in the air.

1154
01:07:18,914 --> 01:07:22,795
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because all you people have your attention diverted with the Desperate Housewives finale or something.

1155
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:25,187
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

1156
01:07:25,227 --> 01:07:26,248
[SPEAKER_08]: I really hope you're not watching that.

1157
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:27,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

1158
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Last Minute Stories.

1159
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:31,692
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to give our listeners more credit than that.

1160
01:07:31,832 --> 01:07:32,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone?

1161
01:07:32,252 --> 01:07:32,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone?

1162
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:35,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I have friends that watch the show and say it's great.

1163
01:07:35,995 --> 01:07:36,735
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not my thing.

1164
01:07:37,195 --> 01:07:38,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm turning into Jamie.

1165
01:07:38,296 --> 01:07:39,637
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no show I've been watching.

1166
01:07:39,897 --> 01:07:41,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't even watched The Soup for three weeks.

1167
01:07:41,498 --> 01:07:43,440
[SPEAKER_08]: That's rare for me because that's like my favorite show.

1168
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't watch anything at all.

1169
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:45,921
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been me lately.

1170
01:07:46,302 --> 01:07:47,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, Dark Sakura, Last Minute Stories.

1171
01:07:48,183 --> 01:07:51,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Live hits 24 million downloads.

1172
01:07:52,626 --> 01:07:56,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Over 600 terabytes of data were transferred during E3.

1173
01:07:56,668 --> 01:07:56,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1174
01:07:57,149 --> 01:07:57,909
[SPEAKER_03]: The week of E3.

1175
01:07:58,569 --> 01:08:03,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is 30 times more data than is found in all the printed material in the U.S.

1176
01:08:03,052 --> 01:08:04,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Library of Congress.

1177
01:08:04,773 --> 01:08:05,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I contributed to that number.

1178
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:07,374
[SPEAKER_03]: As we all did.

1179
01:08:07,414 --> 01:08:11,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we had them downloading Lost Planet at the E3 Outpost, too.

1180
01:08:12,017 --> 01:08:12,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we played Uno.

1181
01:08:14,018 --> 01:08:20,202
[SPEAKER_03]: But the single most popular item downloaded for Xbox Live Marketplace was the trailer for Halo 3.

1182
01:08:21,294 --> 01:08:27,059
[SPEAKER_03]: But the rest of the download chart shows that the playable demos were more popular than the videos in general.

1183
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:32,183
[SPEAKER_03]: They had Lost Planet, Test Drive Unlimited, and MotoGP06.

1184
01:08:33,724 --> 01:08:35,966
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a bit of Microsoft news.

1185
01:08:37,086 --> 01:08:37,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1186
01:08:40,294 --> 01:08:44,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Black Wolf would like to point out Uno greater than Lost Planet.

1187
01:08:46,036 --> 01:08:49,177
[SPEAKER_08]: He also says we downloaded the Halo 3 trailer at the outpost too.

1188
01:08:49,477 --> 01:08:50,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see it there.

1189
01:08:50,538 --> 01:08:54,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see it until I got home.

1190
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,940
[SPEAKER_08]: You know you just gave that away to all our listeners?

1191
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,401
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1192
01:08:58,421 --> 01:08:59,281
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my husband.

1193
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:01,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't tell anybody what mine is because I don't have one.

1194
01:09:03,602 --> 01:09:03,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1195
01:09:05,748 --> 01:09:07,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, any last minute stories?

1196
01:09:07,348 --> 01:09:11,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if you happen to buy a DS Lite here next month or so.

1197
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:15,911
[SPEAKER_09]: You do know you can put homebrew stuff on there really simple.

1198
01:09:19,652 --> 01:09:26,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Daytail actually has their Max Media Launcher, which, guess what, works just like one of those PassMe keys that they used to have.

1199
01:09:26,514 --> 01:09:29,635
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can put all this wonderful stuff on there, including homebrew.

1200
01:09:30,396 --> 01:09:37,800
[SPEAKER_09]: including such things as SCUMM VMDS, which is for running Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc.

1201
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:45,645
[SPEAKER_09]: DS Linux, and of course, an IRC program, among other homebrew apps.

1202
01:09:46,826 --> 01:09:51,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And that Daydell thing, I believe, has carried most major retailers.

1203
01:09:51,328 --> 01:09:54,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I think even they had it at Best Buy and GameStop and stuff, so.

1204
01:09:55,836 --> 01:09:56,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Check it out.

1205
01:09:56,916 --> 01:09:57,657
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1206
01:09:57,717 --> 01:10:03,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat room is pointing out I actually cut DarkSakura off before she got her husband's full screen name out.

1207
01:10:03,698 --> 01:10:05,119
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1208
01:10:06,059 --> 01:10:13,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you got the second word of his screen name out, but that's okay because if you're smart and you know what kind of games Jamie plays, you can figure out what the screen name is.

1209
01:10:13,701 --> 01:10:14,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not mine.

1210
01:10:14,741 --> 01:10:14,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1211
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:17,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Gunstar, come on.

1212
01:10:18,002 --> 01:10:19,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it.

1213
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:21,283
[SPEAKER_03]: You just talked over me.

1214
01:10:21,543 --> 01:10:21,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

1215
01:10:22,964 --> 01:10:23,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1216
01:10:24,446 --> 01:10:26,127
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in our chat room, you'll know what it is.

1217
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:35,550
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to know what it is, you can send me an email to Jamie at OrangeLandRadio.com I got one of those 360 blogs for my gamer tag.

1218
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:38,832
[SPEAKER_08]: If you really want to know it, it's on the OLR forums.

1219
01:10:38,852 --> 01:10:42,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Dan would come close to doing anything like that.

1220
01:10:42,553 --> 01:10:43,873
[SPEAKER_03]: He just plays lots of Uno these days.

1221
01:10:44,334 --> 01:10:45,774
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all you're going to see is Dan playing Uno.

1222
01:10:46,234 --> 01:10:50,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's get to the very last story of the evening and Loki's going to bring it to you.

1223
01:10:50,316 --> 01:10:50,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1224
01:10:51,276 --> 01:10:53,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, have you ever thought, you know,

1225
01:10:53,812 --> 01:10:55,754
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1226
01:11:12,816 --> 01:11:23,779
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a real life obstacle course which a player jumps through a bunch of different levels and stuff using a power harness provided by them.

1227
01:11:24,339 --> 01:11:28,200
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's nothing digital, nothing projected, and nothing really virtual.

1228
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,480
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of silly fun, I guess.

1229
01:11:31,481 --> 01:11:36,602
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you are interested in it, check it out at NintendoAmusementPark.com.

1230
01:11:37,202 --> 01:11:40,243
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just weird.

1231
01:11:42,161 --> 01:11:45,644
[SPEAKER_08]: You know the first thought that went through my mind when I read Nintendo Amusement Park?

1232
01:11:46,345 --> 01:11:49,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo Amusement Park, where the lines are four hours long.

1233
01:11:51,469 --> 01:11:54,832
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, it's just very strange.

1234
01:11:55,792 --> 01:12:03,038
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a video on their website, though, showing the ridiculousness of it, and it's interesting.

1235
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:03,959
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1236
01:12:04,804 --> 01:12:05,805
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to wrap it up, kids.

1237
01:12:06,185 --> 01:12:09,187
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for tonight's show, which I think might be our longest to date.

1238
01:12:09,307 --> 01:12:12,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're running on three hours just about here, just shy of three hours.

1239
01:12:13,149 --> 01:12:14,310
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to go around again.

1240
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:14,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Loki?

1241
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:16,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I forgot one more thing.

1242
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,272
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, make it quick.

1243
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:20,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Prey demo coming to Xbox Live on June 22nd.

1244
01:12:20,974 --> 01:12:21,374
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1245
01:12:23,215 --> 01:12:24,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I want to finish this.

1246
01:12:24,316 --> 01:12:24,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we finish?

1247
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:25,537
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1248
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:32,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys for tuning in to Orange Launch Radio tonight and supporting Internet Radio and Independent Radio.

1249
01:12:32,075 --> 01:12:32,895

[SPEAKER_08]: We love our fans.

1251

[SPEAKER_08]: We do this for you guys.

1252
01:12:35,256 --> 01:12:37,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1253
01:12:37,537 --> 01:12:45,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, no live show next week because we'll be at Fanime, but stay tuned to the podcast stream because our live show from Fanime will hit the podcast stream on Monday-ish.

1254
01:12:46,019 --> 01:12:46,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought?

1255
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:51,601
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I haven't been to Fanime in a while.

1256
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:59,588
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I'm looking for a place to crash in San Jose on Saturday night.

1257
01:13:00,029 --> 01:13:00,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Sakura.

1258
01:13:00,911 --> 01:13:01,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject false icons.

1259
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:03,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's it guys.

1260

01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:10,792
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next week with our live show from Fanime.

1263
01:13:10,832 --> 01:13:12,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't wait to meet some of you guys in person.

1264
01:13:12,773 --> 01:13:19,116
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll see you back here the week after for Orange Lounge Radio Live episode number 185.

1265
01:13:20,937 --> 01:13:22,317
[SPEAKER_08]: And thanks so much for listening.
