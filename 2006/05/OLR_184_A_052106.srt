00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,120
Today, May 21, 2006, in an OLR exclusive, new evidence may have given us the release

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,960
date of the Wii, Xbox's firmware is hacked and Microsoft responds, and a warning on E3

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
downloads.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:36,380
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,400
This is episode number 184 for this May 21, 2006.

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,040
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,480
Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,480
Wee!

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
Wee!

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
How are you?

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
Tired.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Tired?

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
Long weekend?

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,920
And I actually just got back off the road literally ten minutes ago. You drove right up into the OLR studio

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,240
Hey, Louis, you crashed into the building lots of damn it. No, I'm kidding. I wouldn't do that to my baby

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,240
No, I thought I ran into Loki's car. I

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,380
Thought it was very interesting how you told me you were staying awake on most of the road

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,600
How are you staying awake?

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,880
You gave me the one of these little C's chocolate lollipop things C's lollipops are the best thing ever

20
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,220
Except for the fact that got rid of peanut butter so screw them

21
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,220
I was chewing on it and like

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,780
Like like this reason once you can't like bite through right and then like suck it on them and then like a part broke off

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,380
And it was it had a sharp edge and it cut my tongue ow

24
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:43,060
So yeah right here, and then that lasted me from about right before the 360 toll booth not 360

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,240
680 at least you're in a gaming gaming mode we know

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,060
Until without a Oh

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,140
Davis and then I was like is there a highway 360 somewhere I mentioned

28
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,340
there's got to be sure there is somewhere on the East Coast where there's

29
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,780
nothing but highways out there they're there highways here they're freeways

30
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,860
anyway also say hello to the one and only tech master Loki hello I'm here

31
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,300
yeah yeah you're here I'm here supporting your new Silent Hill t-shirt

32
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,580
I like well it's not new but yeah where'd you get that I got us from work

33
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,300
Oh, lucky you. I went into Hot Topic this weekend, you know,

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,860
tease me if you want for going in there, but, you know,

35
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,540
they sell some cool stuff sometimes, and also they had the Silent Hill Pyramid

36
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,660
Head t-shirt, which rocked, so I had to pick that up.

37
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,460
They finally got that in? Yes, they had it at the... I tried to go before E3.

38
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,460
Yeah, so did I, because I wanted to wear one to E3, but they have them now.

39
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,300
So, they also have the Silent... There's another shirt that says Silent Hill on the

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,780
side,

41
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,580
and it's got the bunny thing on the back, so I didn't get that one,

42
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,320
because Pyramid Head rocks. Bunny's creepy. I finally saw what the Silent Hill 3

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,420
memory file icon looks like, and it's just that bunny running.

44
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,700
Alright, anyway, let's talk about games. I'd like to start it off with a

45
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,780
little bit of how was your gaming week?

46
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,460
I know we've kind of cooled down from E3 a little bit and probably tried to get

47
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,880
our personal lives going again because there was

48
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,560
definitely a lot of craziness at E3, but was there any time for games? Anybody check out

49
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,800
some games? Dark Sakura?

50
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,380
Well, actually we played a lot of Kingdom Hearts this weekend.

51
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,820
from like 1 until 3 in the morning, trying to figure out why

52
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,940
I couldn't get back to Agrabah on my game, because I sort of skipped it, I went right from

53
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,420
Pirates of the Caribbean to

54
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,340
Halloweentown, and now I can't get back into Agrabah and the Pride Lands

55
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,000
but Dan somehow did that because he did that before he went to Halloweentown

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,340
so we're trying to figure out if I need to like start my game over or just

57
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,620
you know whatever, so hey if anyone knows please let me know, send me a PM in the chat room

58
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,220
And then we went to the Winchester Mystery House and there was an arcade there.

59
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,780
I played Theater of Magic. That's one of my favorite pinball tables ever.

60
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,940
That's one of my favorite pinball tables ever. I would say Baby Pac-Man,

61
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,060
Pin-Bot, Theater of Magic. Although I do have a lot of love for Adam's family.

62
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,780
Baby Pac-Man, Black Knight 2000, Theater of Magic.

63
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,940
But I played X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

64
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,620
And their controller was broken, so I called the manager.

65
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,580
I know because I was gonna get my later. I didn't really care about my 50 cents

66
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,740
I was like, um, the controller's broken on x-men versus she fires

67
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,700
Oh, well, you can go to the gift table and get your money back. I was like, so are you going to fix it?

68
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,860
And he's like, uh eventually I was like that's not good enough

69
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,620
You should go have a look at it and he just did wandered off looking pissed off and I was like dick

70
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,020
All right, I worked for an arcade

71
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,600
Okay, I know that you can just take out the joystick put in a new one or you fix the contacts. It's great

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,460
I own arcade machines now. That's why it was it

73
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,660
Did it feel just like it was a broken contact like the joystick felt fine the joystick felt fine

74
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,160
It wasn't moving up or down. That's probably just a contact. Yeah flame

75
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,900
Yeah, so I was like, so don't play a x-men versus Street Fighter at the Winchester Mystery House

76
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,860
Other than that which is from mystery house rocks speaking of our chat room because you brought them up orange laundry

77
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,780
click on chat we love being an interactive program and DMN is winner

78
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,900
because he went on the Wikipedia and quickly found Texas State Highway 360 so

79
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,980
there is a highway 360 in Texas good job of which we are not based in we're in

80
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:27,660
California Loki how was your gaming week it was good I purchased an actual game

81
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,500
for the DS new Super Mario Brothers and it was pretty fun just plays like

82
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:41,260
I don't know kind of a cross between Super Mario World a little bit of I don't know some of the like

83
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,180
objects have to get it kind of reminds me of

84
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,260
Yoshi's Island a little bit and then Super Mario 3 this is kind of a combination of those, but it's fun. Just Mario

85
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:57,500
Yeah, so I played that and of course I had a craving for Ridge Racer all week Ridge Racer

86
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,340
So I played Ridge Racer 6 and that was fun and then I played Uno and that was retarded

87
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,580
and I don't know why I bought that game.

88
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,580
You don't like Uno?

89
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,580
No.

90
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,580
Uno is also- wait!

91
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,420
Dark Sakura, I've noticed and maybe you haven't because you were gone this weekend but your

92
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,740
husband has been on Uno like non-stop.

93
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:21,220
It's Dan and freaking Will playing Uno like all the time and I'm like I go in the room

94
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,460
I mean okay I have no problem with him playing Uno because it's not reeee, reeee, reeee.

95
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,900
Uno is a nice, although that music in Uno, thank god for Xbox 360 custom soundtracks

96
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,900
because the music in Uno, cheesy!

97
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm like, Dan? What the hell? I was like, you've got a pinball machine!

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I was like, but Uno...

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,500
But seriously, I was looking at the rankings on my friends list, and Dan of course is number one.

100
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,500
He's played well over a hundred matches on that game.

101
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
No seriously, he does like freaking tournament play.

102
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh my, that's sick!

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,600
He actually has done the win the game with the wild draw seven as a draw four.

104
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,040
I got that achievement by total luck. Total luck.

105
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,520
He's gotten, like, all kinds of crap on that game, and I'm like,

106
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,280
it's Uno! I have him in my car right now!

107
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,480
I have a box of Uno cards! We could play

108
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,520
real Uno! And have our friends over!

109
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,280
Dork? My husband's a dork! I love him to death that my husband's a dork!

110
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,480
That's alright. It's part of why you married him, right? Yeah. Then I bought Birds of a Feather.

111
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,480
I bought Bejeweled 2 for Nellie the play, and she's been on that for

112
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,500
a long time. I actually got to play a little bit of it today. It's okay. I don't know if

113
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,440
it's worth the 800 Microsoft points, which I think is about 10 bucks. So I'm not sure

114
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,940
if, actually I'm pretty sure that it's not worth 10 bucks. Bejeweled? No, it's another

115
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,620
one of those games that you can play on the computer anytime for free, and there's no

116
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:50,960
real multiplayer element. It's a very pretty game on the HD, and the achievements are impossible.

117
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,440
I don't think I've seen a game with harder achievements than Bejeweled.

118
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,760
They have puzzle mode on there, and I'm gonna cheat my way through puzzle mode.

119
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
That's lame.

120
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,280
That's how you know you're an achievement points whore, because you're doing the lame

121
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,520
game FAQs or whatever cheat through your Bejeweled game.

122
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,040
Lame.

123
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
I made it through those.

124
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
You're what's wrong with America.

125
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,520
I don't care.

126
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,560
It's more achievement points.

127
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Alright.

128
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,520
And then, um, what else did they play?

129
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,760
I think that was pretty much, well, Grand Theft Auto, of course, we didn't play more

130
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:26,640
and just, I don't know, it's been fun. I just, we need a new game now. New Grand Theft Auto.

131
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,440
We're not going to a new game, we're just waiting for the next Grand Theft Auto to come

132
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,960
out, so. Alright. Sooner than later, hopefully. What about Saints Row or whatever that one

133
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,080
was at E3 that's kinda like Grand Theft Auto? I guess, well, I mean, you can't really play

134
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,460
that multiplayer, like, at least with Break. Oh, okay, gotcha. Yeah, that's the only thing.

135
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,480
We need it on PSP, so, you know, I'd be all down for, you know, playing multiplayer Grand

136
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,600
thought and I hope to God that they have multiplayer in the Liberty City stories on Playstation

137
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,280
2. I don't think they will, but if they do that's going to be awesome because then I'll

138
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:05,040
get to kick people's asses across the country. But right now it's just, I don't know, it's

139
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,120
fun. We kind of mix it up a little bit, try to mix up the teams and make it really close.

140
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,320
But I don't know. And then I played, was it Astro Pop? I don't like that. I think anything

141
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,480
PopCap sucks.

142
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,000
I've been buying these games just to try them and, you know, I don't know.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,160
I should probably just download the demo.

144
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,280
I have a weird appreciation for Zuma on the 360.

145
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,280
I don't know what it is, but maybe it's something about the analog stick control or something,

146
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,580
but that one bugs me the least out of those PopCap stuff.

147
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,760
But dual control's fine, it's just I don't like how, okay, no more moves, you know, and

148
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
you're fucked.

149
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,880
not my fault that there's no more moves. It's the fact that there's, you know, random blocks

150
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,460
and I didn't quite, you know, get that. And there's people cheating in the DS Tetris now.

151
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,120
What the hell is that? I read about that. It's not on the show. How lame is that? I

152
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,440
think someone in our forum said it best. I'm so sorry that I'm not crediting this person.

153
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm too lazy to look at the forums. But somebody said, put a game online and people will cheat

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,080
on it. End of story. Somebody won't find a way to cheat. Sad. How are they cheating?

155
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,280
Weren't they giving themselves nothing but the line of four like how when you use the star item you get nothing

156
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,800
But the line blocks that's what this person did right pretty much

157
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Damn cheaters and all I get cheat all you want offline. I don't care but cheating online bad

158
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,240
All right, yeah anything else that's it going to the chat room

159
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,400
Nintendo maniac 64 is amazed Loki got Nelly to play a video game because we know your wife hate names

160
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
That was tricky.

161
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
That's amazing, that's good.

162
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
You took the wife to see Silent Hill, right?

163
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Yeah. What'd you think?

164
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
She didn't sleep well.

165
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
But she likes Pyramid Head?

166
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
She didn't think he was that scary.

167
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
She thought the Ash babies were more freaky.

168
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Ash babies are hella freaky.

169
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
I hated the people.

170
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Well, I got dragged to the Vinci Code the night before.

171
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I saw that.

172
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
We were gonna go see like three movies this weekend.

173
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
We were gonna go see Over the Hedge also.

174
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Just didn't make it to it.

175
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,480
to it. We wanted to see Silent Hill before it left theaters because right now it's only

176
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:19,480
playing twice. It's either 210 or 940. So it's like crap, you know? It was okay, it's

177
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,360
just there was a bunch of teenagers there, teenage girls, and they were fucking retarded.

178
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,720
And there was some guy behind us that was like craving attention that just wouldn't

179
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,400
fucking shut up. And he was an adult, you know?

180
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,540
I hate that.

181
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,080
So I don't get it.

182
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,100
Blaze in our chatroom says Pyramid Head is the star of Silent Hill. Agreed. Pyramid Head

183
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,340
is a total rock star. Also, folks are going back and talking about the whole UNO on cards

184
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:50,340
versus UNO on Xbox Live. Jeremy Todd 1 says, Virtual UNO, greater than real UNO. DMN says,

185
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:56,420
hell, look at hot coffee. No need to even have real sex anymore, which I significantly

186
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:04,780
agree with. What we need, apples to apples. That'd be great. Yeah, rumor is that Texas

187
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,300
Hold'em is on its way.

188
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Eh, lame.

189
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Uh, let's see.

190
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
What else was said here?

191
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
Up here.

192
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,580
Oh, Bosstone says, who wants reality when you can have video games?

193
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,580
I don't know, guys.

194
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,820
Go outside once in a while.

195
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,940
It's a big, big world out there.

196
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,980
We are all for playing games, but balancing that with the real world.

197
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,260
Anyway, my gaming week.

198
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,880
Not a lot of new stuff except for, of course, the new Super Mario Brothers, which I should

199
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,800
petition to have renamed New Super Mario Brothers 3, because that's what it felt a little more

200
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,720
like to me but you know all kidding aside it's it's it's really a great game

201
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,920
I don't think it's gonna be like best DS game ever for me but it's good it's a

202
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,560
solid game and especially folks that have fond memories of the Super Mario

203
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,360
Brothers series it plays just like a new entry like if they had made Super Mario

204
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,520
Brothers 4 at some point you know this would be what it is so it's it's a good

205
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,880
game and it's fun and I like multiplayer is a hell of a lot of fun if you play

206
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,880
the multiplayer, where you are competing against somebody else to get stars in one level, that

207
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
is a lot of fun.

208
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,120
The Mario vs Luigi or whatever.

209
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,960
I was listening to Extrofer and his sister play that the other night while I was playing

210
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,480
Final Fantasy XI, and man, they were just screaming at each other, like they were really

211
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,600
getting into it.

212
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,420
I played a little bit of it, and it's quite fun.

213
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,000
They have also the multiplayer mini-games too.

214
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,280
Well, the only thing that disappointed me was that the single-player mini-games were,

215
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,760
For the most part, all the Mario 64 games, which was a little bit of a, hmm, couldn't

216
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
you have just...

217
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,580
Well, I think that you unlocked more as you played through the game.

218
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,520
I think so too, but, you know, I was a little, there was that initial disappointment of,

219
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,440
hmm, haven't I seen all this before?

220
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,420
But yeah, I'm not going to knock the game for that because there's plenty else to do

221
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
in it.

222
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,160
So, I do recommend New Super Mario Brothers if you're a DS, if you have any fond memories

223
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,120
of Super Mario Brothers 1, 3, World, whatever, it's a great addition.

224
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,720
By the way, you mentioning your addiction?

225
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
I signed back up for World of Warcraft.

226
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
No, not really.

227
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
I played it once since I signed back up.

228
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Actually, and then if you want to continue on my game a week, of course I've been playing quite a bit of Final Fantasy XI, because I'm just, you know, addicted like that.

229
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Uno would be the other thing I've also been playing. It's fun.

230
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,720
I also downloaded the Lost Planet demo on Xbox 360.

231
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,600
Because, you know, I heard about all this stuff at E3, but since there was a lot of

232
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,960
people wanting to play this stuff at E3 Outpost, I never really got my hands on it myself.

233
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
So I had to kind of wait.

234
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,280
Well, I got my hands on Uno, but I didn't get my hands on Lost Planet.

235
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,360
So I kind of had to wait until I got home, and I don't know, I guess it's just not really

236
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
my kind of game.

237
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,440
I mean, it's pretty looking, and I can see where fans of that type of genre would be

238
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,720
really into it, but for me, it wasn't the most...

239
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,680
Like, I heard a lot of comments like, best game of show, or one of the best games of

240
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,580
the show and it's great and I was just kind of like I feel like I've kind of played

241
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
this before.

242
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,400
I don't know what was so dang special about it for me but again that's not my primary

243
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,700
genre of games and not the type of game I'm used to so I suppose if I was like really

244
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,460
really into those types of mid-venture shooters I'd probably get a lot more of a thrill out

245
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
of it.

246
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,620
It's certainly a good looking game so it's nice to see that type of stuff on next gen.

247
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,060
Alright anyway, that was our gaming week, so let's start to get into the news, and we're

248
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,140
going to start off with some bits on the Nintendo Wii.

249
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,500
First let's set the stage a little bit.

250
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,220
We have kind of something really big we want to get into, but let's set the stage a little

251
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,220
bit.

252
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,700
Loki, a big gaming news site, runs predictions for the Wii, yes?

253
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:40,420
Yeah, Kotaku, they had a little story about how EB Games is, I guess they have a placeholder

254
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:48,940
for Madden on the Wii, and it says, I believe it was August 30th, and you know, they're

255
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:55,380
saying, you know, raises the question, are they going to release in the summer? Of course,

256
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,500
you know, the track record of EB and stuff, I mean, I think they had PS3 stuff in there

257
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:07,420
like a long time ago. And so, I don't know. But you never know. So right now it's just

258
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,900
speculation, maybe summer.

259
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,540
All right, interesting.

260
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,500
Also, if you head on over to wenintendo.net,

261
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,940
they're tracking, I guess, all the games that

262
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,980
have been announced and what type of stuff

263
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,460
is coming out on the Wii.

264
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,420
And of course, they list all the basics, the remote,

265
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,300
the nunchuck, the classic controller

266
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,140
if you turn the remote on the side,

267
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,860
the retro controller, the light gun

268
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,780
that they showed in the case, which was kind of cool.

269
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,140
And then they get on to the games.

270
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,740
And these are the games they're listing as launch games.

271
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,260
Zelda, Twilight Princess, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, Wii Sports, Red Steel, Tony Hawk

272
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:50,860
Downhill Jam, Madden NFL 2007 Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen, Tower

273
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,580
of Mirrors, Super Monkey Ball, Banana Blitz, Metal Slug Anthology, Trauma Center Second

274
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:03,360
Opinion, Elibits, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Blitz the League, Rayman Raving Rabbits, Sponge

275
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,760
Bob Squarepants Creature from the Krusty Krab, Disney, Pixar's Cars is what they've

276
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,320
got listed as the launch titles for the Wii.

277
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:17,500
So now, as you may recall on Orange Launch Radio, a couple months ago we posted a little

278
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,320
bit of a spoiler on our website, so you could say, and that had to do with Castlevania Portrait

279
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,160
of Ruin and the trio of new DDR games, right?

280
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,040
And remind us, Loki, how did you find this information before any of the major gaming

281
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
sites did?

282
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,080
It's just stuff that the retailers let them know.

283
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,600
As soon as they get updated dates on stuff,

284
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,800
they will let their retailers know.

285
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,480
And since I work in, not really retail,

286
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,680
but I work in distribution,

287
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,800
I'm able to see this information.

288
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,040
Whereas most people who work in the media industry,

289
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,400
they don't work in retail or don't really have

290
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,060
someone that's right there looking

291
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,920
for this kind of stuff like I do.

292
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,920
interesting now but that but to be to but to be fair in the interest of you

293
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,120
know

294
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,600
disclosing everything you didn't get everything a hundred percent correct

295
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
right now

296
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,680
there's stuff changes all the time right me likes and was it silent hill original

297
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,280
sin

298
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,640
right change to origins which is even a working title now so it could change

299
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,240
again

300
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,060
and then if I recall right the death or death junior PSP had a subtitle whereas

301
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,720
in your list it didn't write is just that

302
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,480
yeah cuz they change names on stuff all the time okay you know

303
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,560
Cause it's, you know, Death Junior 2 maybe

304
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,600
they want something a little bit more. And as we all know release dates get shifted

305
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,520
all the time. Yeah. All the time. Look at a game like Dead or Alive 4.

306
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,800
I mean that game just got was constantly getting inched out a little further a

307
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,040
little further each time right?

308
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,120
Yeah. Okay well now I ask you has anything interesting showed up in your

309
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,960
database this week?

310
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,440
Of course. You know it's after E3. Lots of stuff is going to show up in the database and

311
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,200
well we do have, you know, the PS3 stuff which is kinda interesting.

312
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,720
The thing I was most interested in was the Wii games, and we have four of them.

313
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,100
And what's even more interesting is the dates on those four games than when they're supposed

314
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,180
to be coming out.

315
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:10,340
So the four games that I have, Avatar the Last Airbender, which of course is a Nickelodeon

316
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,920
franchise, Chicken Little Ace in Action, sequel to Chicken Little Game that came out, Metal

317
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,900
Slug Anthology, and SpongeBob Creature from the Crusted Crab.

318
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,380
Now that's interesting because two of those games we knew about, the Metal Slug Anthology

319
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,820
and the Spongebob game of course, but the other two I hadn't really heard of before,

320
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,060
and of course I don't really follow Nickelodeon games, I imagine most people do, or don't,

321
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,900
but I don't even remember reading about these anywhere.

322
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,700
So those kind of showed up out of the blue.

323
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,140
The other thing I also want to mention though is these are from three different companies,

324
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,940
so you know, if this is going to be taken as speculation, it should be, you know, it's

325
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,480
It's not just one company throwing their games at us.

326
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Three different companies have all put their games in.

327
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,520
You've got Buena Vista, THQ, and I don't remember the last one, oh, SNK, so that was interesting.

328
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,560
So what are the dates?

329
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:06,200
The dates, Chicken Little and Metal Slug, October 11th, and for Avatar and Spongebob,

330
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,000
October 18th.

331
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So there you have it.

332
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,080
The Wii launch, we're speculating, has got to be in this time frame somewhere, but that's

333
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,360
interesting that there's the two different dates.

334
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,600
have October 11th and October 18th.

335
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,840
But they also, a lot of times, like for example the 360 launch stuff comes out before.

336
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,460
That's exactly what I was thinking is that, so when I read it, because you posted this

337
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,960
in our private forum, we were talking about, you know, tonight's show, and my first thought

338
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,160
was, okay, it's kind of like the 360 where some games came out a week before and it looks

339
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,320
like October 18th would be the launch of the Wii.

340
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,700
And here's another thing about October 18th.

341
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,700
October 18th.

342
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Is this the clincher?

343
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,940
October 18th marks the anniversary of the original Nintendo Entertainment System launch

344
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,500
in the United States.

345
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,860
That's a very interesting coincidence.

346
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,100
It is very interesting.

347
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Huh.

348
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Alright, so what do you think?

349
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,380
October 18th is the day?

350
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,380
I think they're going to be...

351
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,380
Maybe the 11th, but most likely the 18th.

352
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:05,180
I think the hardware is pretty close to done, and launching a month in advance against the

353
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,700
PlayStation 3, I think it's probably going to happen.

354
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,340
Okay, so Devil's Advocate here.

355
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,540
I believe these dates in October versus the Madden date that we talked about just a little

356
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,540
bit ago.

357
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:21,020
Well, from like retail sites, EA for example, usually their dates, I mean, it could be,

358
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,400
you know, a really early date, and especially a lot of times they'll put in dates for like

359
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,860
Playstation 3, which is supposed to be in the spring, I think, they'll put stuff on

360
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,300
there so they can take pre-orders.

361
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,100
So it might not have a firm date, might have been a rumor, whatever.

362
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,820
That would make sense because Madden is really one of those games that's going to...

363
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,820
And here's the other thing too...

364
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,860
There's a whole audience that will come over to the Wii just for Madden.

365
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,220
And here's the other thing about that April, not April, August 30th date, that's the date

366
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,680
when the other Madden games are coming out.

367
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:58,100
That's not necessarily, because Madden 07 is coming out that day, well the 29th I think

368
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,740
it was, on all systems.

369
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,900
On Xbox 360 and all the current gen stuff.

370
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,100
So that's probably why they have that date on there for the Wii, they just added another

371
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,660
entry because they knew it was coming out on the Wii.

372
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,280
Not necessarily meaning that it's coming out on that day.

373
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,920
But that's just, you know, because obviously you know Madden came out last year, a lot

374
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,980
later on the Xbox 360 for the launch.

375
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,880
But I'm pretty confident on these.

376
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,360
You know what, that makes perfect sense about the Madden thing because of all the other

377
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,340
consoles around that same...

378
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,340
You sold me.

379
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:38,140
I think October 18th is the day, maybe October 11th.

380
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:44,080
The anniversary thing, especially with the virtual console and everything, it just makes

381
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
too much sense.

382
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,860
They get the jump on the PlayStation 3 just by a little bit and enough time for the hype

383
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,740
to build up a little bit before the crazy gaming season or I should say shopping season

384
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,600
starts the day after Thanksgiving, so it gives a chance for the hardcore gamers to get their

385
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,000
systems and sell out, and then the crazy parents getting it for their kids would jump in in

386
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,360
November, and it would sell out.

387
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,420
It seems like a smart kind of launch strategy, this date.

388
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
I like this date.

389
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,560
It makes a lot of sense.

390
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,100
So yeah, that's what we've got so far.

391
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,160
You know, it'd be cool if they launched the system worldwide on the same day, because

392
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,680
if that were the case in Japan, we'd be getting it in July, but, you know, I'm going with

393
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
October.

394
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:31,420
Alright, let's go into the chat room and see if there is any thoughts there on the October

395
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
18th date.

396
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,780
Let's see, Blaze says, well here's what I think, October 18th would be the day to release

397
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,580
all the NES launch games on the Virtual Console.

398
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,740
Yeah, that makes sense, you know, kind of the anniversary, but why not the actual console

399
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,740
itself the same day?

400
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:52,900
I think most of us were banking on November as it was, and we kind of thought, hmm, Nintendo,

401
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,580
disruption, wouldn't they want to get their system out there in kind of a unique timeframe?

402
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,620
All the pieces fit together with this date for me.

403
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,500
And although, yeah, it's not solid, it's not an official confirmation, we are going

404
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,980
off a little bit of shaky evidence, maybe, because the dates do shift around, it just

405
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,980
makes sense.

406
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,460
Well, and also the fact that we have three different companies agreeing on a date, pretty

407
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:22,820
much, or at least a launch week window, because usually it's about two or three weeks.

408
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,740
I'm going to have to definitely say that it's looking that way, and you know what?

409
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,980
Next week when we get more information on games coming out and stuff, and we have more

410
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,100
titles in our system, it's just going to be even more information.

411
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:39,300
I think we'll find out pretty soon when the official date's going to be, but I wouldn't

412
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,980
be too surprised if it's October 18th.

413
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,980
So here's my other question.

414
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,820
Why do you think Nintendo's sitting on this date now?

415
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,060
If they kind of know, and they've told their third-party publishers what day they're planning

416
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,980
on launching their system, what are they waiting for to tell the rest of us? What event do

417
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,300
you think they're going to finally announce all this?

418
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,100
Well, I think they're waiting for maybe to see, because I guess the PlayStation 3, they

419
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:07,980
could maybe try to get, maybe, you know, if they announce that they're going to be launching,

420
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:14,500
you know, in November or something, and then kind of a false sense of security for Sony

421
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,300
or something like that, and then, you know, that way, you know, two months in advance

422
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,800
I'll get the jump on them. Yeah, I make sense. Ha bitch. We're launching

423
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,980
Disruption. Yeah, so I don't know. Oh

424
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
All right. I like that

425
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,660
All right. We'll see what happens guys October 18th. That's what we're betting on for right now. So

426
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,300
More official news to follow as soon as we hear it

427
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,740
Moving on to other news now. We've got the release date. What about the price?

428
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,680
Well, rumor is flying around from Sweden of all places.

429
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:56,940
The Daily News in Sweden is saying that the WE console will be between 2500 and 3000 kronor.

430
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:06,320
So if you translate that into US dollars, that's 340 US dollars, but keep in mind in

431
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,800
Europe they tend to get screwed on the prices of the console, sorry guys, but probably the

432
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,600
the Wii would then be in the $250-$300 dollar ballpark, which is a little higher than the

433
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,440
$199 we're all assuming.

434
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Thoughts?

435
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,000
I think it's in the $199, all their other systems have launched for $199 as far as my

436
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,880
memory serves me.

437
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
So why not?

438
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,760
And if they're going to do the anniversary of the NES launch, why not do the price?

439
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Exactly.

440
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,400
You know, I think a lot of us are sold on the $199, I think it's kind of the price that

441
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,560
Nintendo's expected to meet.

442
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,560
I'm agreeing more with the 250 price point.

443
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Well, why is that?

444
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Just because, I mean, it's still competitive without being, you know, I would say prohibitively,

445
00:26:53,560 --> 00:27:01,560
you know, it's not going to, they can still make their money on it, and yet still have it be generally affordable for most people.

446
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:06,760
My thought was the reason why Nintendo didn't announce their price at E3 was

447
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,120
because they were waiting to see what Sony did

448
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,860
because Xbox 360 is out there for 300 bucks, their low-end console, right?

449
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,120
And maybe they were waiting to see if Sony was gonna put it out for 300 as well,

450
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,920
have some type of low-end for 300 as well. And if that had happened,

451
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,880
250 or rather 249 would be cutting it a little close and I think in that case

452
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,120
Nintendo would have definitely done the 199.

453
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,880
but now that PlayStation 3 has really highballed it,

454
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,840
maybe they can release it for $249 and it's still the cheap system.

455
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,480
But I don't know, there's something about that $199 I still like.

456
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,600
They might be waiting to see what Microsoft's going to do as far as

457
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,320
dropping the price of their console to $290. That's true too, because

458
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,280
Microsoft may have come out of that conference, they could have, hypothetically,

459
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,280
come out of that conference and said we're cutting the price of our core system.

460
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,840
And that would maybe was something Nintendo wanted to be prepared for. Here's

461
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,820
Here's another thought though, you know, especially in this whole dual levels, you know, the core

462
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,920
and the premium and then the PS3 little drive and big drive.

463
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,160
This has been done before with the original NES.

464
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,680
You had the regular NES, you actually had three levels, right, you had the regular NES,

465
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,760
then you had the, I don't know, was it the action pack, the one that came with the light

466
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,000
gun and the duck hunt in Mario Brothers, and then there was the, I don't remember what

467
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,400
it was called, the robot pack or some other type of pack.

468
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,200
The one with the gyromite.

469
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,520
Right, and it had Rob the Robot as well.

470
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,800
Wasn't there one also with the Power Pad in Duck Hunt?

471
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,840
Years later, yes, you're right, the world-class track meet.

472
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,960
So hypothetically, couldn't we possibly be launching 199, 249, maybe 199,

473
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,480
I don't know,

474
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,720
system controller, virtual console points only,

475
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,320
and 249, all that plus Wii Sports?

476
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,600
I think they want to simplify it and they're not going to try to do that because

477
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,320
their market is for new gamers. They're not going to try to confuse them with

478
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,960
two different price points and stuff and trying to get you to buy the more expensive system.

479
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,640
I don't think they're going to do that.

480
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:11,280
They haven't done that with any of their consoles, anything recent.

481
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,320
I wouldn't see them doing that.

482
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Comments from the chat room.

483
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,560
Lots of interesting thoughts on the price point here.

484
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,500
Funny Dale says, one way or the other, the Wii will launch at $199.99.

485
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,660
If they launch at $249, Microsoft will immediately drop the price of the 360 core system down

486
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,220
to $229.

487
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,860
I don't know if Microsoft can afford to drop it that low right now.

488
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,860
Next year?

489
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,860
Maybe.

490
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,860
This year?

491
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,860
I don't know.

492
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:41,300
Microsoft still has the whole high definition thing to sell the consoles with, right?

493
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,660
I don't think they need to drop their console price.

494
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,060
They know they're not competing with Nintendo as far as next gen.

495
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,740
on their own kind of game. There was that whole endorsement. Both companies,

496
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,940
Microsoft and Sony, have practically said,

497
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,580
sure, get a Nintendo as long as you don't buy

498
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,700
Microsoft, Sony, whatever the competitor is. Sure, get a Wii.

499
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,620
I think it's funny. Very interesting thought here. I agree with that too.

500
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,740
Spiritsnare has a thought. Sky, the core console wasn't changed. Those were merely

501
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,940
bundles.

502
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,860
That's a good point, but, you know, and somebody else said, DMN said, you guys

503
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:26,580
forget those were accessories, true, but the Wii has an assortment of accessories as well

504
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,580
to play with, right?

505
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,580
You have the classic controller, the light gun, so why not some of these things?

506
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:39,860
But I think the point is that that's not really right to compare it to the way Xbox is doing

507
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,620
their bundle and the way that Nintendo, because Nintendo is actually different stuff on the

508
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,100
system itself.

509
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,440
I can understand that. All I'm trying to say is could

510
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,220
Nintendo launch two different Wii, one at $1.99 and one at $2.49 with different stuff?

511
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:59,380
Yes, right? I honestly think that the way

512
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,420
if they want to keep it at $1.99 what they need to do is have

513
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,460
is to have a pack with

514
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,060
this particular thing, a pack with this particular thing, a pack with this

515
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,180
particular thing. You pick the one that you want to get based on the types of games you like

516
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,980
and then you can get special deal with this thing

517
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,340
for another X amount of money to get all the other accessories

518
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,340
coming to a total of 250. And how Nintendo would this be? Release like a

519
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,340
blue pack and a red pack and a

520
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,780
I don't know, white pack or something? Well they have a white, black, and blue.

521
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,780
I don't, yeah, with the different colors of Wii's, you know, I'm just pulling these colors

522
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,820
on my butt because they could release Wii's in whatever color they want

523
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,260
but you know, then with the red pack you get like a red Wii

524
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,500
and maybe this game I don't know I mean I don't think it's gonna get that crazy

525
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,620
because I don't think they're gonna complicate but that that's a good

526
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,300
thought though

527
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,140
that you know there's all different types of ways Nintendo could do this anyway

528
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:56,700
we could hypothesize until the cows come home but we won't know anything for sure

529
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,140
until Nintendo confirms which hopefully will be soon

530
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:05,020
anyway moving on Loki what else is coming in with the Wii

531
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,620
you're gonna get a web browser actually the opera web browser

532
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,220
better, you know, you might remember that they released that originally for

533
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,900
the Nintendo DS, now it's coming to the Wii, it's going to be one of the things that it

534
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,300
launches with, which

535
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,300
I think, you know, unless Sony does something, it's going to be the only console out

536
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,860
there with a web browser built into it.

537
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,500
I mean, since maybe the Dreamcast? Just in the interest of disclosure here, I think

538
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,020
there's a story coming up later on tonight about the PS3

539
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,980
interface has been shown and there was a web browser integrated in the PS3, so just, you know,

540
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,980
And the Dreamcast web browser was not actually part of the system, it was a

541
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,580
disk.

542
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,660
true okay well whatever I mean

543
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,900
oh goody the the PlayStation 3 web browser

544
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,100
no you know what though I applaud this applause applause applause having the

545
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,460
upper

546
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,660
upper browser here because it shows you know I think well I was already really

547
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,580
sold on this but it definitely shows Nintendo is embracing online

548
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,020
good job Nintendo thank you not quite okay oh

549
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,940
alright they're not really embracing online because

550
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,460
Metroid Prime 3 not online multi

551
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,120
player. There's a lot of their...

552
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,460
sort of getting it, but not quite 100% yet.

553
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,060
I think they just... I think Nintendo has a

554
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,940
interesting enough thing going on with the whole, you know, controller aspect

555
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,260
that

556
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,220
the Metroid doesn't need to be multiplayer yet. Why do that when

557
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,260
Metroid 4 can be online multiplayer?

558
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,260
Halo, the original, wasn't multiplayer, but then again,

559
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,220
okay, Xbox Live wasn't quite what it was at that point. You could, though, land it.

560
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:42,300
We've done the four Xbox hook-up LAN parties on Halo.

561
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,060
And it doesn't mean that they couldn't, yeah, and it doesn't mean that you couldn't

562
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:52,220
maybe later on, you know, upgrade it or add a, you know, an update that had more...

563
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,100
Yeah, the Metroid Prime 3 corruption, you know, special edition with online multiplayer.

564
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,520
Or just, you know, that, what was it, the Nintendo Connect 24 or whatever, where they

565
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,660
can update, you know, do an update on the game.

566
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,620
Ion671 says, so you can pay $500 to surf the web on the PS3?

567
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:16,420
Well, yeah, but here's the thing though, Xbox 360, this is one thing they're kind of lacking

568
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,260
right now, which is surprising, seeing as Microsoft had the Web TV thing a while back,

569
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
right?

570
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,300
I'm kind of surprised that 360 doesn't have a web browser yet.

571
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,500
It's a little surprising.

572
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,540
I mean, it's not the end of the world.

573
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,100
I can surf the web on my computer, yeah, and maybe this is what Microsoft realizes, is

574
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,620
that why put a web browser in here because you know most people surf the

575
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,220
web on their computers but I think it's kind of a neat feature there's something

576
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,780
kind of neat about having a website right there on the television and think

577
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,740
about some of those games that have websites accessible from within the game

578
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,820
like I know this is a real weak example but fantasy star on the GameCube you

579
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,600
kind of went on the fantasy star website and you can actually like read the

580
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,700
forums and stuff from the GameCube so I don't know I know it's kind of a weak

581
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,380
example but you could supplement games with websites right on the TV right yeah

582
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:12,060
and that'd be cool to text entry on those websites via the DS maybe didn't

583
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,460
the Opera browser on the DS and that's supposed to have handwriting recognition

584
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,420
I remember seeing that yeah I don't know but yeah so it'd be pretty good

585
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,500
spirits Nara says sky but web TV sucked okay true but the technology is there

586
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,900
funnydale says so what microsoft can offer a web browser free on xbox live

587
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,540
next week

588
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,340
true but they haven't yet they can but they haven't

589
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:40,700
tigerclaws says very true sky many websites have flash games

590
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,140
so why not play the flash games on the TV well maybe Microsoft doesn't want

591
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,340
that because then they wouldn't

592
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,260
be able to sell bejeweled I don't know I don't know lots of theories here guys

593
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,340
will open up the skype line later guys so you guys can give your thoughts but

594
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,940
for now

595
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,220
We want to get into some other things, and this next story, this is something I think

596
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,880
a lot of people overlooked from the madness of E3, but while E3 is going on and all the

597
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,180
gamers' attention is over there, things might be going on in the real world that affect

598
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,180
us, right, DarkSakura?

599
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:14,700
Yeah, there was a unanimous, a unanimous, blah, blah, blah, okay, in Louisiana the house

600
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:21,400
unanimously passed, basically it was HB1381 on Tuesday.

601
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:29,200
It was a bill that applies the Miller obscenity test to video games, sort of like the whole

602
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,080
games as porn, you know, tactic that's been going on.

603
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,480
I got some information from Game Politics on this one, actually a few interesting quotes.

604
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,180
There's a lot of people who are just really pissed off over this, I think it's just as

605
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,880
stupid as I do, probably.

606
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,600
One of the editors for the Daily Comet stated, and I quote, why does the government feel

607
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
the need to parent children.

608
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Amen!

609
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Thank you!

610
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Sorry.

611
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,000
Few will be persuaded that violent video games or movies have a negative effect on children.

612
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's only a game.

613
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's only a movie.

614
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,440
People are smart enough to distinguish the difference, some believe.

615
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:08,080
As for me, I believe I can give better guidance to my children than Baton Rouge or Washington.

616
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,840
But there's another funny one on here, though, that, uh, it made me laugh.

617
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:18,120
It was actually by the editor of the, uh, home I care, uh, courier, says, I could watch

618
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,260
I watch football from now until the cows come home, but I wouldn't be able to throw Brett

619
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,760
I guess his favorite, F-A-V-R-E.

620
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,520
I don't watch football, so I don't really care.

621
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,560
And I could play Grand Theft Auto for the next 12 years, I don't think I would be looking

622
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,240
for policemen to murder or prostitutes to pimp.

623
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,360
That's because, and let me phrase this correctly so that even the Solons in Baton Rouge can

624
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,280
comprehend the message, it's just a game.

625
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,280
I'm actually reading the text of the bill here, which you can access on Game Politics

626
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
website.

627
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,560
just kind of reading what they want to add into the law here. Let's see.

628
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,840
Prohibited sales of video or computer games to minors. A. An interactive video

629
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,200
or computer game should not be sold, leased, or rented to a minor if the

630
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,200
trier of facts determines all the followings. 1. The average person applying

631
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,760
contemporary community standards would find that the video or computer game

632
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,200
taken as a whole appeals to the minor's morbid interest in violence. Vague. 2. The

633
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,260
game depicts violence in a manner patently offensive to prevailing

634
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,080
standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable for minors.

635
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:23,080
The game, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.

636
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

637
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,080
It's just another...

638
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,080
It's basically...

639
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,080
It's another just attempt of the government trying to control children.

640
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:39,080
I mean, basically trying to have control over how children are raised trying to do the parent's job for them

641
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,080
so they grow up to be nice little, you know, mindless sheep for them to have them later in the future.

642
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,480
later in the future. Who's going to determine that? The game lacks serious

643
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,600
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors?

644
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,120
They've got established standards. See, they're trying

645
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,840
to apply something that is not applicable for a game.

646
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,640
I mean, but you can even really apply this to

647
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,960
movies or even books.

648
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,760
I mean, who's to judge whether this is of literary or artistic

649
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,620
artistic value. How can you judge art? Art is not meant to be judged. Art is meant to

650
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:26,620
be interpreted. Well, apparently that's their interpretation of it. Well, it stinks. Yeah.

651
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:35,140
Well, then again, you know, with the, there was, remember the whole outcry they were having

652
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:43,340
with the tour of the statue of David going around? Because it's nude. It's art! You know,

653
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,840
That was actually a big deal when I was in Alabama.

654
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,320
I don't get that.

655
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,440
It's a penis.

656
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,400
Half of America has already seen one at least, and the other half probably did see one already.

657
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Have one.

658
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,680
No, that's what I meant.

659
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,960
They've seen their own or they've probably seen one one way or another.

660
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,760
What's the big deal?

661
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,680
I sort of put that in the same category.

662
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:14,080
the whole you know close-minded censure of things that you know their version of

663
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,360
inappropriateness but I really I really really think that there is an ulterior

664
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,520
motive to all this I think that I honestly with as much as we're seeing

665
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,840
this coming especially in Republicans don't you know get all upset with me or

666
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,920
anything coming out of the Republican camp and coming out of the Democrats too

667
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,800
because you know we've got Hillary's spearhead and all this bullcrap you know

668
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:43,960
We've got our two major political camps pushing the same type of agenda, especially

669
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,720
since we're coming up to election year in 2008, and doesn't usually start about two

670
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
years right beforehand.

671
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,360
Just expect things to get worse, kids.

672
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:57,920
We're getting the immigration deal now, we're getting the video game deal really bad now.

673
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,200
I honestly think there's more behind this than just protecting our youth, who I think

674
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,600
that it's a definite, uh, political agenda.

675
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,840
Right. Our chat room is just lighting up, like line after line after line on this here

676
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,160
right now. I've never seen the chat room scroll so fast.

677
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,080
Um, BlackWolf makes the smartass comment,

678
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,000
Africa has artistic value. The PlayStation 3 title that made

679
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,160
most of us go, what the f is this? Uh, let's see.

680
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,480
SpiritSnare says, Artistic, you need to play fucking Mario Paint.

681
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,360
Okay, very interesting there.

682
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,820
Funnydale says to all of the gamers who say that if we just ignore Jack Thompson, he will

683
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,040
then go away.

684
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,920
This proves this is not true.

685
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
Interesting thought.

686
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
Very interesting.

687
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,840
Yeah, he was also a chief witness of that.

688
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
Did you notice that?

689
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
No, I didn't.

690
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,600
Yeah, it's a comment here and I'm going to do another quote, it's from the Shreveport

691
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,600
Times.

692
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,200
It says, the fact that Jack Thompson was testifying in favor of the bill should immediately set

693
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:06,300
off alarms, Thompson evokes no one so strongly as Fredric Wordham, a psychologist whose 1950s

694
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,340
book Seduction of the Innocent led to the congressional hearings on the dangers of comic

695
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,340
books.

696
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:15,780
More comments from the chat room here, GS191, I'm tired of game politics, the politicians

697
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,520
will never get video games, I say let them pass their stupid laws, it's going to be us

698
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,060
that's going to gain control and take out the laws in the long run.

699
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,220
Not if they are successful.

700
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:30,020
You know what, here's my thought guys, if this makes you mad, don't write us a letter,

701
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,340
well I mean of course we want your feedback, go ahead and write us a letter, but you need

702
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,660
to be writing your congressman a letter, especially if you're over the age of 18, and here, I'm

703
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,380
I'm going to start your letter for you.

704
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:45,100
Dear Congressman, I am a registered voter.

705
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,900
Then go ahead and express yourself cleanly, please.

706
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:54,220
It's just for all the people who say, though, that, you know, we are, you know, we're going

707
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,220
to be in power.

708
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:59,660
Well, you know what I'm saying, that the younger generation is going to be the one to overthrow

709
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,660
that.

710
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,420
The thing is, is that imagine what's going to happen if they're successful in censoring

711
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,780
what that generation sees.

712
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,580
Isn't that what everyone said in the 60s?

713
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,580
Maybe.

714
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,580
I wasn't alive in the 60s.

715
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:16,200
I know, but I'm just saying, you kind of look back on that whole hippie movement and everything

716
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,700
and I have a feeling they were saying the same thing.

717
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,700
There was a lot more to it than that necessarily, the hippie movement.

718
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,700
That was around a whole war and...

719
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,460
Okay, so I'm making a very broad visualization, however...

720
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,460
And people are fucking like bunnies.

721
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,460
Sorry.

722
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,420
But, serious, I honestly do think that that's their agenda.

723
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:39,500
From what it's looking like, this is just my own little conspiracy theory here, I think

724
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:45,300
that, you know, honestly, I think that they're afraid of having an open-minded youth, about

725
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,300
having people there who's going to question, instead of just blindly follow their lead.

726
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,480
They lose power if you don't blindly follow.

727
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Some folks in the chat room are saying that they're too young, so they'll just write us

728
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
a letter.

729
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,180
Okay, that's fine, but here's a better thought.

730
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,620
If you're too young, talk to somebody who is a registered voter.

731
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,700
You can still have an impact.

732
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,500
You can still have an impact.

733
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,920
I say talk to your parents about it.

734
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,500
I think it would be great to talk to your parents about what your thoughts on that.

735
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,580
You can still write your congressman.

736
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,580
That's true.

737
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,580
You can still do it.

738
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,980
You can say, hey, I am X years old and by this election I will be registered to vote.

739
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:21,980
That's very true.

740
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,340
I imagine most of you guys that listen to this show.

741
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,340
Lock the vote.

742
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,340
Remember that?

743
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,340
Huh?

744
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,340
Trying to get people who were just turning 18, who were kids to...

745
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,860
Vote or P. Diddy will kill you?

746
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,180
Well, you know what I mean, though.

747
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,860
was the same thing you know you can still write in you can still get your

748
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,140
voice out there all right I'm gonna end on this note because Roz I think just

749
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:45,180
won the chat room here we got to keep it moving but Roz says dear Jack Thompson

750
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:50,020
you are a giant enemy crab I hit you in your weak spot for massive damage PS

751
00:44:50,020 --> 00:45:01,700
Ridge Racer Roz I love you moving on to another story Loki yes hackin and crackin

752
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,340
On the XB360, what happened?

753
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:10,260
Well they have accomplished what they needed to do.

754
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:17,700
They actually were able to, as I think a while back there was a video of them hacking the

755
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:25,140
360 to play backups of disks and now they were successful on some of the 360s.

756
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,300
Because the 360 comes with either one of two optical drives, either a Toshiba, Samsung

757
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:37,680
drive or Hitachi drive. And if you have the Toshiba Samsung drive, well guess what? You

758
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:44,320
can actually mod your firmware on the actual optical disk drive and be able to play backups.

759
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,560
And basically what it does is it kind of works the same way that they did with the Xbox One

760
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:55,600
firmware and their disk drives. It patches the response to the media check into the disk

761
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,720
drive. So basically when you pop in a game, it will check, okay is this a burnt disk,

762
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,640
Is this a Prestus from Microsoft?

763
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,860
Is this a CD?

764
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,280
What type of media am I reading?

765
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,360
And usually if you have a DVD Plus R or something like that, it's not going to play it if it's

766
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,360
a game.

767
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,560
So what this does is no matter what the hell you put into it, it replies back to the system

768
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,720
saying, yep, we're good, play the game.

769
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:27,720
So yeah, right now they're working on a way to be able to get to work on the Hitachi drives.

770
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,300
However, there's groups like Team Executor, they're releasing a device that you can actually

771
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:38,140
hook this up to your PC, which is what you'd have to do to flash the firmware on it.

772
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:43,340
And soon enough, you know, they're going to be able to bust this thing wide open like

773
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,660
the original Xbox.

774
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:49,300
So that's not a good thing, I'm sure, for Microsoft.

775
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,820
Dark Soccer, what do you think?

776
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,300
Microsoft going to be happy about this?

777
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:58,220
Well, basically they've issued an official statement to warn the 360 owners about messing

778
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,300
with their system, pretty much.

779
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,540
Basically they're saying the core security system has not been broken, however, on some

780
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:10,180
Xbox 360 consoles, the authentication protocol between the optical disk drive and the console

781
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:17,940
may be attacked via complex software and hardware modification, which could allow people to

782
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,340
play illegally copied and modified games.

783
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:26,180
So, pretty much what they're talking about is, yeah, you do that, you void your warranty.

784
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,980
Isn't that the classic response deal?

785
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,980
Don't void your warranty!

786
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,900
Well, here's another thing too that they're working on right now, is they're actually

787
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,900
having multiple BIOSes on the actual DVD drive.

788
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,540
So basically, the flip of the switch, I want to play it on live.

789
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,920
Flip the switch over, it runs off the original thing, you can't play the copy thing, but

790
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,860
you can, you know, and it might not even be able to detect, you might be able to break

791
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:52,980
that so it can't detect what your firmware is on the actual drive. So, I don't know.

792
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:57,140
I think that they're going to be smart enough to do it. I mean, after all, hell, we have

793
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,620
Xboxes out there that are running games off the hard drive and have Linux on them. So,

794
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,420
I mean, it's not like it's impossible.

795
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:07,340
That would be interesting if it could happen because GK128 has a very interesting condensed

796
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:11,580
version of the Microsoft disclaimer there. He says, mess with your 360, say goodbye to

797
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:20,620
alive bitch and DMN says dear 360 owners don't fuck with your firmware PS Ridge

798
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:25,380
racer oh we're full of comedians tonight in orange knowledge radio chat that's

799
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,660
gonna become our new cake or death I don't know it's it's the new insight or

800
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,980
not really inside joke but you know line of the week that's gonna just get beat

801
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:39,940
into the ground until you're all sick of it if you're not already all right let's

802
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:44,460
Let's see, let's go ahead and move on here to another story, and that would be me talking

803
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,540
about the PlayStation 3, which we haven't talked a whole lot about tonight, but we want

804
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:52,060
to talk about all the next-gen systems.

805
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,620
PlayStation 3 pre-orders at GameStop and EB Games.

806
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:00,540
It ain't happening until early October for the PlayStation 3.

807
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:05,020
Rumor is, I guess, what they're trying to do is go, or try to avoid what happened with

808
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:09,660
Xbox 360, where they were taking pre-orders for a long time, and it was too many pre-orders

809
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,700
to fill, essentially, they didn't get enough systems, and when they couldn't deliver

810
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,700
people's systems until February or March, who got the flack for that?

811
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,700
Microsoft?

812
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,700
No.

813
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,240
GameStop and EB Games did, because why aren't you getting enough consoles?

814
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,960
People maybe didn't really know where to place the blame, so GameStop and EB are thinking

815
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,160
this time, okay, if we only open it up for a certain window, then folks, we won't have

816
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,540
such a huge list, but I don't know.

817
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,900
If people find out the day that GameStop's going to start taking orders, people are going

818
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,620
be lined up that morning

819
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,980
i think you know the sony fanboys anyway you know say what you want about whether

820
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,020
you're gonna get or not get a playstation three but

821
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,180
there are rabid launch fans there's enough of them where you know they'll be

822
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,380
a line going out the door

823
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,020
the day they start taking pre-orders so i think this will help that situation a

824
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,140
little bit

825
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,340
it's not gonna if sony can't produce the systems is gonna be the same thing all

826
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,220
over again

827
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:06,180
also third launch windows like the launch game suck you know you never know

828
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:10,420
Well, anyways, we'll get to that later.

829
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:15,700
Moving right along, Dark Sakura likes to kind of look around at different websites, including

830
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,620
those overseas, and UK reaction to the price?

831
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:29,620
Well, there's actually been an official price released for the UK in particular.

832
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:33,940
Basically they're releasing it for £425 for the 60 gig model, but there's not any type

833
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,820
of word if they're getting the 20 gigabyte model.

834
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,820
Of course, what's the point, since it has no HDMI, no Wi-Fi.

835
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:46,700
Yeah, unless you don't plan on having an HDTV in the next few years, I don't know.

836
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:51,940
This is funny, though, because in Euros, it's 599 Euros for the 60 gigabyte, which goes

837
00:50:51,940 --> 00:51:00,060
to 405 pounds, so actually, they're not getting it for that good of a deal.

838
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:05,480
It's off a little bit, but still going to be a little bit more expensive than the general price in euros

839
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,020
and

840
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:11,100
They're really trying to push the blu-ray thing the they're a mark

841
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:17,060
Managing director for Sony UK Ray McGuire is basically going around saying Oh blu-ray

842
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:22,940
You know blu-ray player is 600 to 700 pounds. You know you're getting a big deal blu-ray blu-ray blu-ray

843
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:28,220
Yeah, where was the blu-ray movie on the e3 show floor? I'm wondering that myself and

844
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,300
and you know on top of that you know

845
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,700
there he's

846
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,500
I think there's a lot of negative reaction to it just from the

847
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,540
the nature of his statement because he

848
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,100
to quote he says the point is that most people don't realize

849
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,300
what they're actually getting with the PlayStation 3 like

850
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,260
no they're getting something that's not going to be what you're trying to make

851
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:52,980
it out to be

852
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:57,780
so and really it's still it's still gonna be more expensive there than it is

853
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,180
here

854
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,580
Very interesting comment in our chat room from FunnyDale.

855
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:07,020
Oh, quick griping about the price of the PlayStation 3. People pay $500 for a

856
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,980
fuckin' iPod. They pay $500 for a damn video card.

857
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:14,700
They will pay 600 bucks for a PlayStation 3. I say yeah,

858
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,420
there are gonna be people that will pay the 600 bucks for a PlayStation 3.

859
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,940
I will. These are the same retards that bought DVHS also.

860
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,940
No, just because I have to have every system, I will pay 600 bucks for the

861
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,880
PlayStation 3 I'm not gonna be happy about but I will do it but the thing is

862
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,580
the iPod if you know you want to make that comparison didn't really achieve

863
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:40,120
huge amounts of success until they released cheaper models that still got

864
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,040
the job done you know what I mean? I never bought an iPod. Well you did the

865
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,240
free iPod thing right? I got a free iPod. Well I'm sure they'll do a free PS3 if you want to go

866
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,920
that route. They're already out there. That's a controversial thing but

867
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,920
whatever do it if that's what makes you makes it work for you then go for it but

868
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,960
I like Bobby's comment oh Bobby Bobby going for the jugular there Loki paid

869
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:12,680
$600 for an Xbox 360 didn't he? actually that was $700 for a 360 so why all the PS3 hate?

870
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,720
because you think you're gonna be paying $300 more if you end up going eBay or

871
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,960
what? no I just I don't there's not really any games for me that I want to

872
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,800
get right at launch. Are you not gonna get it at launch? I might not. I have to see what their

873
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,880
launch games are gonna be

874
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,620
and that's really gonna determine it for me because it's all about the games and you

875
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,480
know what if they don't have that many

876
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,680
good games at launch or if it's not what I like I'll wait.

877
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,640
Right now I'm about an eighty percent yes on it because I I know I can

878
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,920
benefit from the blu-ray being an HDTV owner and all that stuff but

879
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,540
I'm and again a large part of why I'm saying this is because

880
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:51,480
I have to have all the consoles I want them all but I realize

881
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,700
everybody's not like that now and you know yeah the day that all the hype will start a

882
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,820
month before and you'll be like

883
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:00,860
Paris Hilton has one why can't I have one? I'm just kidding

884
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:06,300
alright I mean it's just people are looking at like

885
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,060
a game system you know they're not seeing the

886
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:13,460
the long life that they might see in something else I don't know

887
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:19,020
it's just still. Here's a comment from Ota G who I haven't read anything from

888
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,460
tonight in our chat room. Orangelandtrady.com, click on chat.

889
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,140
The price of the PlayStation 3 isn't the problem. The fact that Sony hasn't

890
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,660
justified it is.

891
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:32,820
Debate, debate going on in our chat room. Exactly, you know, I have my next-gen system. That's why I went and

892
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,820
spent that money

893
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,940
is because it was like one of the first next-gen systems out there,

894
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,340
you know, and I learned my lesson. I learned that,

895
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:44,020
you know maybe the launch game is not so good and so

896
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:48,220
I will wait to see what games are out there and then I can buy it later

897
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:51,420
and that's it.

898
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,420
Let's change gears here let's go back and talk about

899
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,980
some of the current stuff that's out there now this is something somebody

900
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,740
called in about a couple weeks ago

901
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,740
when we were live Mother 3 which you know

902
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:06,020
Earthbound has a rabbit ass following behind it

903
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:10,180
and for good reason Earthbound is a great game we'll get this Mother 3 is

904
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:15,440
going to get an English translation, it is going to come out in Europe.

905
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,360
So hooray for Europe, but if you're in the United States, you're still not happy because

906
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,960
E3 went by and still no Mother 3 announcement for the U.S.

907
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,960
Import the bitch.

908
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,960
There's no lock-out guard.

909
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,720
Yeah, there's no region differences on these.

910
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,720
Just import it.

911
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,720
Well, you're going to have to pay the higher price.

912
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,720
Import!

913
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,720
Amazon U.K.

914
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,960
Well, just to make it clear, the official Nintendo magazine in the U.K. is saying that

915
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,080
It will come out in December in Europe, and it's going to be released for the Game Boy

916
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,440
Advance edition, I'm sorry, Game Boy Advance.

917
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,920
So you're right, though.

918
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,380
If you want to pay the extra bucks there or import it through UK, just pay the slightly

919
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,980
higher shipping fees, at least you get your English translation.

920
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:59,260
So maybe it's not all bad news, and I know a damn lot of people that will do it.

921
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:03,760
So I think Nintendo of America is kind of, I mean, I guess all the money goes to Nintendo

922
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,980
in the end, but I think Nintendo of America at least, at least if nothing else, print

923
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:15,860
a low run and do what you did with the electroplankton, sell it on your website, or something.

924
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:19,180
Just release it in stores and don't advertise for it.

925
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:23,620
I just can't believe something like this won't come out here, especially when an English

926
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:28,180
translation is now done, but frickin' Dr. Sudoku out there on store shelves.

927
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,420
I don't get it.

928
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,700
It baffles me.

929
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:37,340
Cuz people are crazy. I'm surprised how much I won the KB games the other day

930
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,260
just for the hell of it and I

931
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:46,340
Couldn't believe how many Sudoku games are out there. Is it really that much of a popular thing right now? Cuz I

932
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,260
Mean, I remember seeing Sudoku magazines and going wow. I have to do math. Fuck that, you know

933
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,140
So I they used to have a different name. They weren't always called Sudoku here in America

934
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,940
They used to print those in the penny press publications like crypto numbers or something like that

935
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,980
it wasn't even... They're all over the place now.

936
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,320
You know, now that I'm looking for them, I'm like, holy crap. Here's the honest

937
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,340
justification for Dr. Sudoku

938
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:13,180
on the Game Boy Advance or whatever is because Nintendo wants to go after

939
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:18,380
everyone, not just gamers, and I've seen it in the workplace. I've seen

940
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,300
people that are not your typical types of gamers, you know, mothers

941
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,900
and, you know, folks that you don't typically think of as gamers

942
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,460
bring in their Sudoku magazines and they'll play Sudoku on break.

943
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,340
it's it's it is a really good exercise for the brain is that you know the whole

944
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,180
brain training thing

945
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:37,100
so I can see why this is justified in Nintendo's eyes but you know

946
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,280
I'm just saying come on why give us

947
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,420
why give us this out there and not mother three I don't get it I still I

948
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,480
still think Nintendo's going to announce it later

949
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,500
I think there's going to be another Nintendo press conference I mean there

950
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,620
has to be because they're gonna

951
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,840
announce all the Wii stuff and I think they're gonna drop some these bombshells

952
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,260
too

953
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:57,860
so I I still I I'm still hopeful mother threes coming to the US

954
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,860
But, what do I know?

955
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:02,860
I don't know, what do you know?

956
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,860
Not much. I'm just some dude on the internet.

957
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,860
Hey, I have some info.

958
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,860
Alright, what do you know DarkSakura?

959
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,860
I have release dates.

960
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,860
Alright, you like to travel the globe?

961
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,860
And so what's, uh, Europe?

962
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,860
Yes.

963
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:16,860
Alright, what's coming out in Europe?

964
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,860
Well, these are the release dates for the 26th.

965
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,860
That would be Friday.

966
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,860
We have Chibi-Robo for the GameCube.

967
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,860
We have Cossacks 2 Battle for Europe.

968
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:31,340
Europe, Jill Dozer for the GBA, Hitman Blood Money for a whole bunch of stuff, Rockman

969
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:37,620
oh, Rockman, I've got Rockman on the brain, Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis, yay,

970
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:42,900
Rush for Berlin on PC, we have Super Princess Peach on the DS, bout damn time, it's the

971
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,900
PMS game.

972
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,660
Yeah, if you want to control an overly emotional woman, have fun with Super Princess Peach.

973
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:52,100
Don't you know you can't ever do that?

974
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,180
Of course you can't.

975
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:57,660
Well thanks to the wonder of technology of video games, now you can.

976
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,420
So you think. Heart, love ya.

977
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,660
And since this is the only other one on here, I'll go ahead and say it. On the 31st talk,

978
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,020
Man on PSP is coming out.

979
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:09,380
Alright. How about the US, Loki? Sounds like kind of a,

980
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,860
I have to be honest, kind of a slow week in Europe. I mean, a couple of the big

981
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,660
names they're getting we've had here in the US for a little while, so okay.

982
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:19,180
But what's US getting? One of the games I've been

983
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:25,740
highly anticipating because this is it's incredibly fun but anyways um so what we're getting is

984
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:33,260
a lot of crap actually but uh on the pc heroes of might and magic 5 great um a lot of people

985
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:37,980
like my magic on the psp on the psp is quite a bit of stuff um field commander which is

986
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:41,980
kind of like a you know turn-based strategy game remind me of a you know command and conquer

987
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:47,580
a little bit um lemmings on the psp monster hunter freedom which is actually going to

988
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:54,180
pretty good game on the PSP. Um, on the 360 Rockstar's Table Tennis. And on the current

989
00:59:54,180 --> 01:00:01,180
gen stuff, we've got, I believe, Fuel was coming out on the Xbox. And then of course

990
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:09,720
Rogue Trooper on Playstation 2 and Xbox. And then my favorite for the week, Jaws Unleashed.

991
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:13,620
Where you get to play the shark and get to dismember divers. Finally! How long ago was

992
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:17,340
that game supposed to come out? A long time ago. I don't care how cheesy this game is

993
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:22,840
This is like Echo the Dolphin with rabies.

994
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,360
It's like snakes on a plane.

995
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,360
What's the big deal with that movie?

996
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,080
Because it's snakes on a freakin' plane.

997
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:34,820
So you know Jaws the game, yeah it might suck, but it's Jaws, you get to be the shark.

998
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,340
You get to eat people.

999
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,340
That's cool.

1000
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,960
You get to destroy boats.

1001
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,320
It's Grand Theft Auto with fish.

1002
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,520
Shark addiction.

1003
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,940
No but anyways.

1004
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:45,940
Shark is tasty.

1005
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:50,460
Steambot Chronicles is supposed to be coming out on PlayStation 2, which is eh.

1006
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:57,500
I mean, after all, they've got a mechs known as Bumpy Trots, which sounds like a real bad

1007
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:01,900
ass disease or something like that, I don't know.

1008
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,660
We gotta keep it moving, because we've got a lot of stories and we're moving kind of

1009
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,660
slow tonight.

1010
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,660
That's alright.

1011
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,780
Lots of stuff to say since post-E3 here.

1012
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:12,180
Loki, was there any other release dates?

1013
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,180
I'm sorry.

1014
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,180
Nope.

1015
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,180
Okay.

1016
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:20,460
Um, a big name in the online community, Major Nelson, he's got his own little podcast over

1017
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,460
there or I'm sorry, blogcast.

1018
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,980
They don't use the word podcast, I'm not yourself.

1019
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:24,980
He's got a blogcast.

1020
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:27,060
Uh, but what's he saying about the PlayStation 3?

1021
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,900
He's saying that their online service is not going to be free.

1022
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:30,900
And how does he know this?

1023
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,220
Well, he's basically going off the slides that they had on, um, during the press conference

1024
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:42,860
and when they were mentioning free things, um, matchmaking and online play were not mentioned.

1025
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:50,660
I think he says, so basically it's going to be an equivalent to Xbox Live's silver level

1026
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,620
of service right now, so.

1027
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:58,140
You know, basically you get to talk to people, you know, and you do chat and stuff, but you

1028
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,660
can't play games against them for free.

1029
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,660
Interesting.

1030
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,340
Which, you know, I don't know.

1031
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:10,980
I get into the whole thing where I get kind of frustrated with Sony copying everybody

1032
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:11,980
anyways.

1033
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,820
play was free though it would certainly help justify the price because they

1034
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,540
could say hey you're having to pay fifty dollars extra on xbox

1035
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:21,240
xbox so in the heat we get it

1036
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,120
he is right

1037
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:25,020
when he says that you know that that stuff was mentioned free service free

1038
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:29,360
service stuff video chat latest info friends list ranking account management

1039
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,320
player profile voice messaging text messaging

1040
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:37,380
uh... i don't see game play on there

1041
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,900
uh... moving on another interesting story on the playstation three some

1042
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:45,980
Some stealthy video at E3 was shot in, I guess, one of those demo rooms for the media only.

1043
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,380
I guess we weren't cool enough to get invited, but Joystiq was, or somebody that ratted to

1044
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:55,340
Joystiq because they posted some videos on YouTube of the PlayStation 3 interface, and

1045
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,340
guess what?

1046
01:02:56,340 --> 01:03:01,660
It looks very similar to the PSP, which, when I first saw it, I was like, wow, that's kind

1047
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,420
of surprising that it looks like that, and then at the same time, I'm like, actually,

1048
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,420
it's really not.

1049
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:10,740
It should look like the PSP, kind of that branding element, but I'm like, on the TV,

1050
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:14,700
going to look kind of boring. I don't know. I was expecting something a little more flashy,

1051
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,700
but maybe I'm wrong.

1052
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,460
I guess that's true. Maybe simplicity is key. I guess it makes a lot of sense when you think

1053
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:27,220
about it, but what's interesting is that it really does kind of borrow from the PSP. There's

1054
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:31,260
a user's menu where I guess you can sign on as different users, a web browser, which we

1055
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:36,020
brought up earlier, and apparently you're going to be able to do multi-Windows or tabs

1056
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:39,660
or something like that in there as well, and also a friends list, and there will be voice

1057
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:43,060
and video chatting and gaming if you wanted to do that as well

1058
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:46,660
so you're very interested. If you want to check that out I'm sure you can find it on

1059
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,300
YouTube very quickly or it's in Joysticks archives. Check it out.

1060
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,740
What do you guys think about the interface?

1061
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:56,220
I think it's lazy like everything else that they do.

1062
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,620
Really? You know, I

1063
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:03,620
I was talking with my friends at work the other day and just basically ripping on

1064
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:06,660
I'm a huge Sony fanboy. I have a PlayStation

1065
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:11,940
You know, I had a PlayStation 2, I have two PSPs, I mean, so, you know, don't get me wrong,

1066
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,020
I don't hate Sony.

1067
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,280
I just, I don't like how they steal everybody's ideas, though.

1068
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,980
It's like nothing is original for them, and then they try to come out and, like, deny

1069
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,420
that they've ripped off these ideas.

1070
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:25,260
I mean, look at, look at the PlayStation 1, for example, okay?

1071
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:31,220
Came out, doesn't have analog, doesn't have rumble features, Nintendo 64 comes out, has

1072
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:35,940
analog, has rumble, oh, look, look, now we have the DualShock!

1073
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,940
I mean, come on!

1074
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:37,940
It's retarded!

1075
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,540
Okay, now they come out with their controller design.

1076
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:43,580
Oh, by the way, uh, look, it now has tilt features in it.

1077
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,580
Oh, a Playstation 3.

1078
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,100
Oh, now ours has tilt features in it!

1079
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,140
And now let's copy Xbox Live, but not quite.

1080
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,980
They can copy, but they can never get it quite right.

1081
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,980
It's...

1082
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,980
I don't know.

1083
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:55,980
Alright.

1084
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:00,380
I'd be interested to see how things, you know, work out for them.

1085
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:04,180
I'm kind of wary on their online service because Playstation 2's online sucked.

1086
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:07,780
yeah I'll be honest at least it was online

1087
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:10,780
unlike mister GameCube who had one game

1088
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:13,820
and where she GameCube paperweight

1089
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:17,500
I'm moving I know I even when we wait a minute though I I there's issue 3

1090
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,540
paperweight hope okay they say GameCube is a way man way man

1091
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:25,460
no I so many nights at 4 a.m. Mario Party prove otherwise so anyway

1092
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:30,060
alright okay fair enough that we agree alright let's change topics completely

1093
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:33,140
because dark soccer hasn't gotten to give you a website at the weekend a

1094
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:36,820
little while so she's got to do some catching up here and so here it is Dark

1095
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:43,580
Sakura's website of the week for your surfing pleasure so I've decided this

1096
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:47,500
site has got a lot of attention in the past that hasn't gotten a lot of

1097
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:52,340
attention lately so I am talking about another thing other but weebles stuff

1098
01:05:52,340 --> 01:06:01,460
w-e-e-b-l-s-stuff.com yes it's the home of badger badger badger and magical

1099
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:10,380
Trevor and Kenya. The most recent one is Crabs, which I find incredibly hilarious. Do they

1100
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:15,740
have weak points? Well, it's about a mouthful of crabs, and there's lots of bleeding in

1101
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:25,940
it, which sort of makes me think of the whole YAY thing from Rejected. There's also the

1102
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:32,260
home of Weeble and Bob, which are like two eggs, and they're speaking. And the last one

1103
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:38,860
was pretty funny. So go check them out. And make sure that you look for the ninja one.

1104
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:43,860
I don't know where it is, but the ninja one is somewhere on the site. So, yeah.

1105
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:50,780
Alright. Do it now. Right now. Mouthful of crabs!

1106
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:54,660
historically accurate nonetheless.

1107
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:58,480
Moving on, those jokes will never get old, I'm sorry.

1108
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,480
Let's talk some movies.

1109
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,920
We've got a lot of movie and TV stuff, just a barrage of stuff.

1110
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,920
Loki, start us off.

1111
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,480
Okay, let's start off with a really bad idea.

1112
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,600
Bad idea, it's called, Jerry Brockhamer has just signed on to produce a movie called Game

1113
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,600
Boys.

1114
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:18,080
No, it's not the true life story of the portable Nintendo system.

1115
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:25,880
It's a sci-fi action movie that's basically, the story revolves around two 30-year-old

1116
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:31,080
video game junkies recruited by the Department of Homeland Security, which is a joke anyways,

1117
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:36,160
to lead a geeky army of gamers in a battle against creatures that have come to life from

1118
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,000
a video game they have mastered.

1119
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:45,220
Sounds like an episode of X-Files to me, because I think they cover that.

1120
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:49,780
What I'm really surprised is that Homeland Security does not have a contingency plan

1121
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:51,660
for that type of scenario.

1122
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,220
Come on!

1123
01:07:53,220 --> 01:08:00,280
Alright, going from a really bad idea to a really good idea, Metal Gear Solid movie was

1124
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,620
confirmed at E3 in case you missed it.

1125
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:08,300
Konami had a great parody, they put out the show Maybe in response to the show daily,

1126
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,420
but something you don't want to miss in there, the show Maybe says, in a late-breaking

1127
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:16,900
surprise announcement, director Hideo Kojima revealed that his most famous creation, Metal

1128
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,580
Gear Solid, is getting the live-action treatment.

1129
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:23,540
He already said, hell no, to Uebo, so don't worry about that.

1130
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:27,380
But he did say, I've received many offers to adapt to Metal Gear Solid.

1131
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:31,100
It has taken a long time, but we have finally settled on an arrangement.

1132
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,860
False facts aside, a movie project is underway.

1133
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:38,340
I have finalized a Class A contract with a party in Hollywood.

1134
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,860
But that's about all the details yet.

1135
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:44,020
No directors, no stars, no dates.

1136
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:49,340
But you know, with Metal Gear Solid 4 coming out in 2007, most likely, maybe, you know,

1137
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,340
something, something?

1138
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:51,340
Nah, maybe not.

1139
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,120
I guess the movie would have had to have already started to hit that kind of release date,

1140
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,260
but maybe next Christmas, we'll see.

1141
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,260
But it is coming.

1142
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,380
Yeah, interesting.

1143
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,260
Loki.

1144
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:09,100
Yes, that's not the only movie that's coming.

1145
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:16,100
Paul Sams, the executive at Blizzard, has mentioned that a Warcraft movie is coming

1146
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:25,100
and I don't know if I should be excited about this. No, I'm not, because I haven't really played that much Warcraft.

1147
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:31,100
Well, the most popular MMO in this country and movie makes sense to me.

1148
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,100
If they screw it up though, there's going to be tons of pissed off people.

1149
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:40,860
A lot of people play Dungeons and Dragons too, and look what they did to that movie.

1150
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:45,700
Apparently the group that they're working with is called Legendary, and they want to

1151
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:51,340
basically make this really big budget movie.

1152
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,540
I've never heard of Legendary, ever.

1153
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,900
When I think of big blockbuster movies, I don't think, hmm, Legendary, no.

1154
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,020
So who the hell is Legendary?

1155
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,020
I've never heard of them.

1156
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:07,660
follow games not movies you know and I should really be following movies after

1157
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:13,500
all I do work at a goddamn movie distributor good job so hopefully it

1158
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:20,540
doesn't suck oh I guess it's gonna be Warner is working with them well now

1159
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:25,360
they're now Warner I've heard of so there you have it yeah I think I have

1160
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,740
heard a legendary come to think of it I think I've seen that little animation at

1161
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:32,260
the beginning I don't know what I'm sure they've done good stuff I just you know

1162
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:35,520
when you think about movies you think DreamWorks you don't think of the small

1163
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,200
company that put it out you know so just you know but it's not like big movie

1164
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:46,300
studios haven't put out stinkers before so exactly all right this isn't quite a

1165
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:51,520
movie but Dark Sakura an interesting idea nonetheless they're planning on

1166
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:58,160
doing a Animal Crossing or as it is in Japan double tsunami animated movie in

1167
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:02,320
in Japan in December, to be out in December. Very cool, is it going to be...

1168
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,920
I'm guessing it's not live-action. Well, that's why I said animated.

1169
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,040
Oh, I'm sorry. Missed that part.

1170
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:13,880
There's no real information about if it's actually going to have a plot

1171
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:17,320
because really the game has no plot. You paid off your house, drama!

1172
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,040
Well, I would hope a movie would have a plot, but is the plot going to be

1173
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,480
you run around the village and, you know, run errands and deliver mail?

1174
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,240
there's gotta be something. I think it's gonna be, oh, tragedy has hit your

1175
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:31,500
forest, blah blah, band together, save blah blah blah.

1176
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,240
The man is trying to bulldoze Animal Forest, you know?

1177
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:38,800
Because Animal Forest, right, is the translation in Japan, right? Right.

1178
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:44,200
I think that the Japanese DS one was called

1179
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:48,120
Aiedeo Doubutsu no Mori, I think it was, I have to

1180
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:51,880
think. But at any rate, the director

1181
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:58,040
The director for the movie will be Shimura Joji, who worked on Master Keaton and Shin

1182
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,040
Angio Onishi.

1183
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:04,200
Sorry, I'm all tongue tied today, because I'm all bleh.

1184
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:09,000
But Nintendo's talked before, though, that they want to get in the animation business,

1185
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,720
and I think the Animal Crossing is going to be a really good way for them to bring that

1186
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:19,920
goal together, because it was actually stated by the former president of Nintendo, Yamauchi

1187
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:27,840
Hiroshi, stating that they were trying to put funds together to create an animated film

1188
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,840
project.

1189
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:32,400
So maybe that's this in particular.

1190
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,400
That's great.

1191
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:38,380
Spiritsnare in our chat room says, what do you say, Animal Crossing live action would

1192
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,380
be a WTF.

1193
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,440
It would be more like furry crossing.

1194
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,440
Ew.

1195
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,480
They do a claymation.

1196
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,360
All right, and here you go, Loki, and this would explain why I've seen the legendary

1197
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,680
pictures before.

1198
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:54,800
GK128 posted a little linky in our chatroom to the profile on Internet Movie Database

1199
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,680
and here you go, they did Batman Begins and Superman Returns.

1200
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,000
You want to take back what you said before?

1201
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
That's a little bit better.

1202
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,440
Alright, there you go.

1203
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,360
So if you were in the midst of writing an angry email to Loki, we got it cleared up.

1204
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,280
Okay, Legendary Pictures, okay by us now.

1205
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,280
Sorry.

1206
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,280
Yeah, they get the big thumbs up.

1207
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,280
Loki's bad.

1208
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,280
Alright.

1209
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,320
Like I said, see, you think Warner though.

1210
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:22,280
Warner and DC, you don't think legendary when you hear of those films, so whatever, just

1211
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,960
try to defend yourself best you can.

1212
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:27,680
Alright, I'm just giving you a hard time.

1213
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:32,960
Loki, now this isn't about a game turning into a TV show, but it's about games showing

1214
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,600
up on a TV show, yes?

1215
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,600
Yes.

1216
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,680
A show that I am not watching this year.

1217
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,120
Me neither, so it makes it a little tough.

1218
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:52,900
But apparently on The Apprentice last week, they did a competition to design the best

1219
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:59,040
Xbox 360 display in Wal-Mart and from what I hear, both of them sucked really bad.

1220
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,280
From what I read on the internet, one team didn't finish in time and they were missing

1221
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:07,000
something that held their tent up so it was falling over and they won anyway because the

1222
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,720
other one was so freaking bad.

1223
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:13,740
But the review team apparently recognized what they were trying to go for and liked

1224
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,020
it better.

1225
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:18,220
One thing I want to point out though, some folks were saying, oh, this is why Jay Allard

1226
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:21,880
wasn't at E3 because he showed up in this week's Apprentice.

1227
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:26,780
These Apprentice things are taped long in advance, actually longer than that.

1228
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:30,940
This season of the Apprentice was taped in November, so these boosts that they were designing

1229
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,020
were for the launch, most likely.

1230
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:37,180
So it has nothing to do with why he was or wasn't at E3, I just want to point that out

1231
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:42,340
because some folks are forgetting that. Like Survivor and all that crap is taped long in

1232
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:51,820
advance. Yay! Apparently, whatever the case may be, the winner I guess their displays

1233
01:14:51,820 --> 01:15:01,060
were displayed in 1500 Walmart stores. So, I haven't seen a 360 display in Walmarts,

1234
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:03,340
So I don't know.

1235
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,340
Were they that bad?

1236
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:06,340
Apparently so.

1237
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:10,660
Alright, one more story for this part of the show and then we're going to go to a little

1238
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:14,620
break and this has to do with the Booth Boys of E3.

1239
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:18,980
Now you hear a lot about Booth Babes, but with Booth Babes essentially getting, you

1240
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:24,060
know, forcing them to tone down a little bit this year, now we have news on Booth Boys

1241
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:28,260
and this comes from a blog called Wonderland, is the name of the blog.

1242
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:34,020
The author here wrote down their list of the top boys of E3, and in the list here they

1243
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:40,740
have Peter in the Namco booth, who has a little pack head there, Brian from Brothers in Arms

1244
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:44,700
there, ready for action, a little military guy there, let's see who else is in here,

1245
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:52,220
just a couple of Webzen folks there, the poker dealer over there, Martin Lung, the video

1246
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,220
game pianist.

1247
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,180
I actually got some video of him.

1248
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,940
Yeah, he was a very talented guy.

1249
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:57,940
I got to meet him.

1250
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:01,940
He actually blindfolded himself with someone's t-shirt.

1251
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:07,660
Fatality who had his own booth this year and taking the show though, the number one booth

1252
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:12,100
guy according to this blog, Adam West.

1253
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,840
Now what I thought was interesting is that there was another website who ran a story

1254
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:20,980
on booth guys and they distinctly showed a picture of the guy at Nokia's booth because

1255
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:25,800
I guess amongst all those girls in the white t-shirts and stuff, there was actually a guy

1256
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,480
who was a pretty good-looking guy that was there at the booth and they were saying we

1257
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,480
saw him.

1258
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,120
I don't remember seeing him or someone mentioned him.

1259
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:38,480
I think Miklotov mentioned him probably probably leave it to him to point out something like

1260
