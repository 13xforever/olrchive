00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:24,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, May 21st, 2006, in an OLR exclusive, new evidence may have given us the release date of the Wii, Xbox's firmware is hacked and Microsoft responds, and a warning on E3 downloads.

2
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:36,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:41,809
[SPEAKER_02]: This is episode number 184 for this May 21st, 2006.

4
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,450
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

5
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:50,132
[SPEAKER_00]: Wee!

7
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:50,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Wee!

8
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:50,952
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

9
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:51,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Tired.

10
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:52,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Tired?

11
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:53,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Long weekend?

12
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:59,560
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to see a friend and I actually just got back off the road literally 10 minutes ago.

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,081
[SPEAKER_02]: You drove right up into the OLR studio.

14
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:03,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, she crashed into the building.

15
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:04,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of damage.

16
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:04,802
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

17
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:06,363
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do that to my baby.

18
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:09,064
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into Loki's car.

19
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:14,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was very interesting how you told me you were staying awake on most of the road.

20
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:15,506
[SPEAKER_02]: How were you staying awake?

21
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:19,564
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me one of these little seized chocolate lollipop things.

22
00:01:19,924 --> 00:01:24,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Seized lollipops are the best thing ever, except for the fact they got rid of peanut butter, so screw them.

23
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:29,708
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was chewing on it, and like, because it's like, there's reason ones you can't bite through.

24
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:30,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

25
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:35,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, sucking on them, and then like, a part broke off, and it had a sharp edge, and it cut my tongue.

26
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:36,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Ow.

27
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:36,752
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.

28
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:37,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to hear it.

29
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:42,755
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, that lasted me from about, right before the 360 toll booth, not 360, the

30
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:45,322
[SPEAKER_00]: 680, totally.

31
00:01:45,342 --> 00:01:47,283
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you're in a gaming mode, we know.

32
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:55,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Until without O. Davis, and then I was like... Is there a Highway 360 somewhere?

33
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:56,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine there's got to be.

34
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:57,085
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there is.

35
00:01:57,105 --> 00:01:59,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably somewhere on the East Coast where there's nothing but highways out there.

36
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:02,166
[SPEAKER_00]: There are highways here, there are freeways.

37
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:06,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

38
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:07,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, I'm here.

39
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:09,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're here.

40
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:10,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here.

41
00:02:10,873 --> 00:02:12,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Sporting your new Silent Hill t-shirt I like.

42
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:14,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not new, but yeah.

43
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:15,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Where'd you get that?

44
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:16,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this from work.

45
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:18,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, lucky you.

46
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:30,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I went into Hot Topic this weekend, you know, tease me if you want for going in there, but, you know, they sell some cool stuff sometimes, and also they had the Silent Hill Pyramid Head t-shirt, which rocked, so I had to pick that up.

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,640
[SPEAKER_00]: They finally got that in?

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they had it at the... I tried to get it before E3.

49
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:37,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so did I, because I wanted to wear one to E3, but they have them now.

50
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,104
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll see you next time.

51
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:54,722
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

52
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:17,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, I actually played a lot of Kingdom Hearts this weekend from like 1 until 3 in the morning.

53
00:03:18,704 --> 00:03:21,666
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to figure out why I couldn't get back to Agrabah on my game.

54
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:23,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I sort of skipped it.

55
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:26,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I went right from Pirates of the Caribbean to Halloween Town.

56
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:29,189
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I can't get back into Agrabah and the Pride Lands.

57
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,891
[SPEAKER_00]: But Dan somehow did that because he did that before he went to Halloween Town.

58
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:36,953
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to figure out if I need to start my game over or just, you know, whatever.

59
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, if anyone knows, please let me know.

60
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:40,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a PM in the chat room.

61
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went to the Winchester Mystery House and there was an arcade there.

62
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:47,895
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Theater of Magic.

63
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:50,717
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my favorite pinball tables ever.

64
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,258
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my favorite pinball tables ever.

65
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:56,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Baby Pac-Man, Pinbot, Theater of Magic.

66
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I do have a lot of love for Adam Stanley.

67
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:02,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby Pac-Man, Black Knight 2000, Theater of Magic.

68
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:03,688
[SPEAKER_00]: No love for Pinbot.

69
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I played X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

70
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:05,349
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

71
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:10,975
[SPEAKER_00]: and their controller was broken so I called the manager because I was going to get my money back.

72
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:12,597
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really care about my 50 cents.

73
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:17,903
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, the controller's broken on X-Men vs. Street Fighter so you can go to the gift table and get your money back.

74
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:19,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, so are you going to fix it?

75
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:22,929
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, eventually.

76
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:24,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's not good enough.

77
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,098
[SPEAKER_00]: You should go have a look at it.

78
00:04:26,778 --> 00:04:30,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just wandered off looking pissed off and I was like, dick.

79
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,364
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for an arcade, okay?

80
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:41,048
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you can just take out the joystick, put in a new one, or you fix the contacts.

81
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:41,748
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.

82
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:43,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I own arcade machines now.

83
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it feel just like it was a broken contact?

84
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:47,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the joystick felt fine?

85
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:48,833
[SPEAKER_02]: The joystick felt fine.

86
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:50,654
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't moving up or down.

87
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:52,275
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably just a contact.

88
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:52,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

89
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:53,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Lame.

90
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:58,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I was like, so don't play X-Men vs. Street Fighter at the Winchester Mystery House.

91
00:04:58,928 --> 00:04:59,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

92
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, Winchester Mystery House rocks.

93
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:04,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of our chat room, because you brought them up, OrangeLawnTrader.com, click on chat.

94
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,630
[SPEAKER_02]: We love being an interactive program.

95
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And DMN is winner because he went onto Wikipedia and quickly found Texas State Highway 360.

96
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a Highway 360 in Texas.

97
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:16,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

98
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:18,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Of which we are not based in.

99
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:19,414
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in California.

100
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:22,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

101
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:23,830
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.

102
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:31,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I purchased an actual game for the DS, New Super Mario Brothers, and it was pretty fun.

103
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:43,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Just plays like, I don't know, kind of a cross between Super Mario World, a little bit of, I don't know, some of the objects you have to get.

104
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:47,128
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of reminds me of Yoshi's Island a little bit, and then Super Mario 3.

105
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:50,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a combination of those, but it's fun.

106
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,852
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just Mario, you know.

107
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:56,124
[SPEAKER_01]: So I played that, and of course I had a craving for Ridge Racer all week.

108
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:57,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Ridge Racer!

109
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:00,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So I played Ridge Racer 6, and that was fun.

110
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:01,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um...

111
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:05,163
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

112
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:31,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheesy!

113
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:34,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Dan?

114
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:35,413
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?

115
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:36,933
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you've got a pinball machine.

116
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:38,073
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, but, no.

117
00:06:38,893 --> 00:06:42,474
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, I was looking at the rankings on my friends list, and Dan, of course, is number one.

118
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:45,315
[SPEAKER_02]: He's played well over a hundred matches on that game.

119
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:47,375
[SPEAKER_00]: No, seriously, he does, like, freaking tournament play.

120
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:48,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my, that's sick.

121
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:51,536
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually has done the win the game with the wild draw seven.

122
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:52,476
[SPEAKER_00]: I also draw four.

123
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:54,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that achievement by total luck.

124
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:55,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Total luck.

125
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:58,937
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gotten, like, all kinds of crap on that game.

126
00:06:59,017 --> 00:06:59,357
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like...

127
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,841
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Uno.

128
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,082
[SPEAKER_00]: I have in my car right now.

129
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:04,664
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a box of Uno cards.

130
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:08,927
[SPEAKER_00]: We could play real Uno and have our friends over.

131
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:10,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Dork.

132
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:11,769
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband's a dork.

133
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I love him to death, but my husband's a dork.

134
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:14,211
[SPEAKER_01]: That's alright.

135
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,412
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of why you married him, right?

136
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:23,876
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought Bejeweled 2 for Nellie to play, and she's been on that for a long time.

137
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:25,617
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got to play a little bit of it today.

138
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:26,538
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.

139
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:32,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's worth the 800 Microsoft points, which I think is about 10 bucks, so I'm not sure if

140
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:37,916
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've seen a game with harder achievements than Bejeweled.

141
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:39,558
[SPEAKER_02]: They have puzzle mode on there and

142
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:57,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cheat my way through Puzzle Mode.

143
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,283
[SPEAKER_02]: That's lame.

144
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:00,143
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you know you're an achievement points whore.

145
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:05,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're doing the lame game FAQs or whatever cheat through your bejeweled game.

146
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:06,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Lame.

147
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,885
[SPEAKER_01]: You're what's wrong with America.

148
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

149
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:13,226
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more achievement points.

150
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:16,546
[SPEAKER_01]: What else did I play?

151
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:18,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was pretty much... Well, Grand Theft Auto, of course.

152
00:08:18,987 --> 00:08:19,507
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fun.

153
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:21,247
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a new game now.

154
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,910
[SPEAKER_01]: New Grand Theft Auto.

155
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,811
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to a new game.

156
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,652
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just waiting for the next Grand Theft Auto to come out.

157
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:32,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Sooner than later, hopefully.

158
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:37,557
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Saints Row or whatever that one was at E3 that's kind of like Grand Theft Auto?

159
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,939
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really play that multiplayer.

160
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, gotcha.

161
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:43,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the only thing.

162
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:44,422
[SPEAKER_01]: We need it on PSP.

163
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:53,548
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be all down for playing multiplayer Grand Theft Auto and I hope to God that they have multiplayer in the Liberty City stories on PlayStation 2.

164
00:08:54,409 --> 00:09:00,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they will, but if they do, that's going to be awesome because then I'll get to kick people's asses across the country.

165
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,334
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, it's just... It's fun.

166
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:10,115
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of mix it up a little bit, try to mix up the teams and make it really close.

167
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:12,937
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.

168
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:15,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I played... Was it Astro Pop?

169
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:16,438
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like that.

170
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:18,199
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anything PopCap sucks.

171
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been buying these games just to try them and...

172
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:24,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

173
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:26,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I should probably just download the demo.

174
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:30,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a weird appreciation for Zuma on the 360.

175
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:39,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is, but maybe it's something about the analog stick control or something, but that one bugs me the least out of those PopCap stuff.

176
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:45,135
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jeweled Control's fine, it's just I don't like how okay, no more moves, and you're fucked.

177
00:09:45,155 --> 00:09:52,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not my fault that there's no more moves, it's the fact that there's random blocks, and I didn't quite

178
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:56,227
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people cheating in the DS Tetris now.

179
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:57,267
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is that?

180
00:09:57,287 --> 00:09:57,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I read about that.

181
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:58,467
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not on the show.

182
00:09:58,487 --> 00:09:59,508
[SPEAKER_01]: How lame is that?

183
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I think someone in our forum said it best.

184
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:04,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry that I'm not crediting this person.

185
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:05,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too lazy to look at the forums.

186
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:08,270
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody said, put a game online and people will cheat on it.

187
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,430
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.

188
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody will find a way to cheat.

189
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:12,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

190
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:13,111
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they cheating?

191
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:16,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't they giving themselves nothing but the line of four?

192
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:20,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how when you use the star item, you get nothing but the line blocks?

193
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:21,433
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this person did, right?

194
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:21,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.

195
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn cheaters in online games.

196
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:27,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheat all you want offline, I don't care, but cheating online, bad.

197
00:10:29,686 --> 00:10:30,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anything else?

198
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:31,928
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

199
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:39,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the chat room, NintendoManiac64 is amazed, Loki got Nelly to play a video game, because we know your wife hates games.

200
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:40,396
[SPEAKER_02]: That was tricky.

201
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:41,838
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing, that's good.

202
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:44,040
[SPEAKER_02]: You took the wife to see Silent Hill, right?

203
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:44,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

204
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:45,181
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you think?

205
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:47,163
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't sleep well.

206
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But she likes Pyramid Head?

207
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,452
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't think he was that scary.

208
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:52,733
[SPEAKER_01]: She thought the Ash babies were more freaky.

209
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,274
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ash babies are hella freaky.

210
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I hated the people.

211
00:10:57,415 --> 00:11:00,997
[SPEAKER_01]: I got dragged to the Da Vinci Code the night before.

212
00:11:01,017 --> 00:11:02,138
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that.

213
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:04,359
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to go see three movies this weekend.

214
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:07,681
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to go see Over the Hedge also, but we just didn't make it to it.

215
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:12,063
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to see Silent Hill before it left theaters, because right now it's only playing twice.

216
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:14,104
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either 2.10 or 9.40.

217
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:16,345
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, crap, you know?

218
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:17,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

219
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that.

220
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:19,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that.

221
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:20,377
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't get it.

222
00:11:49,617 --> 00:11:51,598
[SPEAKER_02]: DMN says, hell, look at hot coffee.

223
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,800
[SPEAKER_02]: No need to even have real sex anymore.

224
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I significantly agree with.

225
00:11:57,422 --> 00:11:59,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, disagree with.

226
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,124
[SPEAKER_02]: What we need?

227
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:01,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Apples to apples.

228
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:03,346
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.

229
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor is Texas Hold'em is on its way.

230
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:06,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, lame.

231
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:09,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what else was said here?

232
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Boss Tone says, who wants reality when you can have video games?

233
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:13,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, guys.

234
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:14,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Go outside once in a while.

235
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,934
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big, big world out there.

236
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:17,394
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

237
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:34,926
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

238
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario Bros. 4

239
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little bit of it, and it's quite a fun.

240
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,042
[SPEAKER_01]: They have also the multiplayer minigames, too.

241
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:32,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the only thing that disappointed me was that the single-player minigames were, for the most part, all the Mario 64 games, which was a little bit of a, hmm, couldn't you have just done something new?

242
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:34,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think they unlock more as you play through the game.

243
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:40,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, too, but, you know, I was a little, there was that initial disappointment of, hmm, haven't I seen all this before?

244
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:43,791
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I'm not going to knock the game for that, because there's plenty else to do in it.

245
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I do recommend New Super Mario Bros.

246
00:13:47,154 --> 00:13:50,215
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're a DS, if you have any fond memories of Super Mario Bros.

247
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:52,116
[SPEAKER_02]: 1, 3, World, whatever.

248
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:53,657
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great addition.

249
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:56,078
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, you mentioning your addiction?

250
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:58,099
[SPEAKER_00]: I signed back up for World of Warcraft.

251
00:13:58,719 --> 00:13:58,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Addict?

252
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,460
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not really.

253
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,541
[SPEAKER_00]: I played it once since I signed back up.

254
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:07,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, and then if you want to continue on my game a week, of course, I've been playing quite a bit of Final Fantasy XI because I'm just, you know...

255
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm addicted like that, yeah, hush.

256
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:14,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And Uno would be the other thing I've also been playing, is fun.

257
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:23,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I also downloaded the Lost Planet demo on Xbox 360, because, you know, I heard about all this stuff at E3, but since...

258
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:25,646
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

259
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:54,885
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

260
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:20,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our Gaming Week, so let's start to get into the news.

261
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:24,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to start it off with some bits on the Nintendo Wii.

262
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:26,435
[SPEAKER_02]: First, let's set the stage a little bit.

263
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:29,378
[SPEAKER_02]: We have kind of something really big we want to get into, but let's set the stage a little bit.

264
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:33,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, a big gaming news site, runs predictions for the Wii, yes?

265
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:45,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Kotaku, they had a little story about how EB Games is, I guess they have a placeholder for Madden on the Wii, and it says, I believe it was August 30th,

266
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:53,722
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, they're saying, you know, raises the question, are they gonna, you know, release it in the summer?

267
00:15:53,742 --> 00:16:01,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, of course, you know, the track record of EB and stuff, they, I mean, I think they had PS3 stuff in there, like, a long time ago.

268
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,151
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I don't know.

269
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:05,772
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, you never know.

270
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,935
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now it's just speculation, maybe summer.

271
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:09,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer.

272
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:10,767
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, interesting.

273
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:22,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you head on over to wiiNintendo.net, they're tracking, I guess, all the games that have been announced and what type of stuff is coming out on the Wii.

274
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:27,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, they list all the basics, the remote, the nunchuck, the classic controller if you turn the...

275
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:32,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Remote on the side, the retro controller, the light gun that they showed in the case, which was kind of cool.

276
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:36,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they get onto the games, and these are the games they're listing as launch games.

277
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:43,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Zelda, Twilight Princess, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, Wii Sports, Red Steel, Tony Hawk Downhill Jam.

278
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Madden NFL 2K7, or sorry, 2007.

279
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:48,759
[SPEAKER_02]: 2K7 would be a different franchise altogether, sorry.

280
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:51,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen, and Tower of Mirrors.

281
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:58,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, Metal Slug Anthology, Trauma Center Second Opinion, which is a great title for the second Trauma Center.

282
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:10,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Elebits, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Blitz the League, Rayman Raving Rabbits, SpongeBob SquarePants, Creature from the Krusty Krab, Disney Pixar's Cars is what they've got listed as the launch titles for the Wii.

283
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:11,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So now,

284
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:25,252
[SPEAKER_02]: As you may recall, on Orange Launch Radio, a couple months ago, we posted a little bit of a spoiler on our website, so you could say, and that had to do with Castlevania Portrait of Ruin and the trio of new DDR games, right?

285
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:29,555
[SPEAKER_02]: And remind us, Loki, how did you find this information before any of the major gaming sites did?

286
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:33,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just stuff that the retailers let them know.

287
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:40,082
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they get updated dates on stuff, they will let their retailers know, and since I work in

288
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:52,571
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to see this information, whereas most people who work in the media industry, they don't work in retail or don't really have.

289
00:17:53,214 --> 00:17:53,674
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

290
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:15,227
[SPEAKER_01]: DeathJuniorPSP DeathJuniorPSP

291
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:27,182
[SPEAKER_01]: DeathJunior2 DeathJunior2

292
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Avatar The Last Airbender

293
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:18,702
[SPEAKER_01]: which of course is a Nickelodeon franchise, Chicken Little Ace in Action, sequel to the Chicken Little game that came out, Metal Slug Anthology, and SpongeBob Creature from the Crust Crab.

294
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:26,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's interesting because two of those games we knew about, the Metal Slug Anthology and the SpongeBob game of course, but the other two I hadn't really heard of before.

295
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:32,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Now of course I don't really follow Nickelodeon games, I imagine most people do, or don't, but I don't even remember...

296
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:34,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Reading about these anywhere.

297
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:36,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So those kind of showed up out of the blue.

298
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,002
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I also want to mention, though, is these are from three different companies.

299
00:19:40,103 --> 00:19:49,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this is going to be taken as speculation, it should be... It's not just one company throwing their games in.

300
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,192
[SPEAKER_01]: It's three different companies.

301
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:54,116
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Buena Vista, THQ, and I don't remember the last one.

302
00:19:54,216 --> 00:19:56,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, SNK.

303
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:56,979
[SPEAKER_01]: That was interesting.

304
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the dates?

305
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:03,445
[SPEAKER_01]: The dates for Chicken Little and Metal Slug, October 11th.

306
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:07,667
[SPEAKER_01]: And for Avatar and SpongeBob, October 18th.

307
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:08,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.

308
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:09,829
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii launch.

309
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:13,789
[SPEAKER_02]: We're speculating it's got to be in this time frame somewhere.

310
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,330
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's interesting, there's the two different dates.

311
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,551
[SPEAKER_02]: You have October 11th and October 18th.

312
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:21,573
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also, a lot of times, like for example, the 360 launch stuff comes out before.

313
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:23,094
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I was thinking.

314
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:35,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I read it, because you posted this in our private forum, we were talking about tonight's show, and my first thought was, okay, it's kind of like the 360, where some games came out a week before, and it looks like October 18th would be the launch of the Wii.

315
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,982
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's another thing about October 18th.

316
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:41,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the clincher?

317
00:20:42,004 --> 00:20:42,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

318
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:48,928
[SPEAKER_01]: October 18th marks the anniversary of the original Nintendo Entertainment System launch in the United States.

319
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,009
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very interesting coincidence.

320
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,830
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very interesting.

321
00:20:53,971 --> 00:20:55,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so what do you think?

322
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:56,372
[SPEAKER_02]: October 18th is the day?

323
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:59,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the 11th, but most likely the 18th.

324
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:03,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the hardware is pretty close to done, and launching a month in advance...

325
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,473
[SPEAKER_01]: against the PlayStation 3, I think it's probably going to happen.

326
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:13,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so devil's advocate here, why believe these dates in October versus the Madden date that we talked about just a little bit ago?

327
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:27,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, from, like, retail sites, EA, for example, usually their dates, I mean, it could be, you know, a really early date, and especially, a lot of times they'll put in dates for, like, PlayStation 3, um,

328
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:29,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Madden 07 Madden 07

329
00:21:56,306 --> 00:22:00,408
[SPEAKER_01]: That day, well the 29th I think it was, on all systems.

330
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:03,990
[SPEAKER_01]: On Xbox 360 and all the current gen stuff.

331
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:08,273
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably why they have that date on there for the Wii.

332
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:10,874
[SPEAKER_01]: They just added another entry because they knew it was coming out on the Wii.

333
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:13,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily meaning it's coming out on that day.

334
00:22:14,196 --> 00:22:22,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously Madden came out last year, a lot later on the Xbox 360 for the launch.

335
00:22:23,162 --> 00:22:25,165
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty confident on these.

336
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:26,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

337
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:31,836
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes perfect sense about the Madden thing because of all the other consoles around that same... You sold me.

338
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I think October 18th is the day.

339
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:36,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe October 11th.

340
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:39,326
[SPEAKER_02]: The anniversary thing.

341
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:40,787
[SPEAKER_02]: They like doing those anniversaries.

342
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:43,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with the virtual console and everything.

343
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:44,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes too much sense.

344
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,972
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd get the jump on the PlayStation 3 just by a little bit.

345
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:56,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And enough time for the hype to build up a little bit before the crazy shopping season starts the day after Thanksgiving.

346
00:22:58,997 --> 00:23:08,344
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gives a chance for the hardcore gamers to get their systems and sell out, and then the crazy parents getting it for their kids would jump in in November, and it would sell out.

347
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:11,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a smart kind of launch strategy, this date.

348
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:12,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this date.

349
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:13,107
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a lot of sense.

350
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:15,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's what we've got so far.

351
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:22,274
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'd be cool if they launched the system worldwide on the same day, because if that were the case in Japan, it'd be getting it in July.

352
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,116
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'm going with October.

353
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:26,017
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

354
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:32,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go into the chat room and see if there is any thoughts there on the October 18th date.

355
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:33,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

356
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:35,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Blaze says, well, here's what I think.

357
00:23:35,797 --> 00:23:40,360
[SPEAKER_02]: October 18th would be the day to release all the NES launch games on the virtual console.

358
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:46,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense, you know, kind of the anniversary, but why not the actual console itself the same day?

359
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:57,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of us were banking on November as it was, and we kind of thought, hmm, Nintendo, disruption, wouldn't they want to get their system out there in kind of a unique time frame?

360
00:23:58,514 --> 00:24:00,055
[SPEAKER_02]: All the pieces fit together with this date for me.

361
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:10,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And although, yeah, it's not solid, it's not an official confirmation, we are going off a little bit of shaky evidence, maybe, because the dates do shift around.

362
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:11,542
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes sense.

363
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:21,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and also the fact that we have three different companies agreeing on a date, pretty much, or at least a launch week window, because usually it's about two or three weeks.

364
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:26,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to definitely say that it's looking that way.

365
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:26,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

366
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:28,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

367
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:41,872
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll find out pretty soon when the official date's going to be, but I wouldn't be too surprised if it's October 18th.

368
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:42,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's my other question.

369
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:44,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think Nintendo's sitting on this date now?

370
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:53,216
[SPEAKER_02]: If they kind of know, and they've told their third-party publishers what day they're planning on launching their system, what are they waiting for to tell the rest of us?

371
00:24:53,296 --> 00:24:55,917
[SPEAKER_02]: What event do you think they're going to finally announce all this?

372
00:24:56,397 --> 00:25:02,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think they're waiting for maybe to see, because I guess the PlayStation 3, they could maybe try to get

373
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:19,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, you know, if they announce that they're going to be launching, you know, in November or something, and then kind of false sense of security for Sony or something like that, and then, you know, that way, you know, two months in advance, they're all, get the jump on them.

374
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:20,527
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.

375
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:22,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha, bitch, we're launching fucking 30 days.

376
00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:22,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Disruption.

377
00:25:22,948 --> 00:25:23,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Disruption.

378
00:25:24,209 --> 00:25:24,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

379
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:26,350
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

380
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:27,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

381
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:30,052
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we'll see what happens, guys.

382
00:25:30,392 --> 00:25:32,954
[SPEAKER_02]: October 18th, that's what we're betting on for right now, so.

383
00:25:33,837 --> 00:25:37,326
[SPEAKER_02]: More official news to follow as soon as we hear it.

384
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:40,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to other news.

385
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've got the release date.

386
00:25:42,136 --> 00:25:42,936
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the price?

387
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:47,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, rumor is flying around from Sweden, of all places.

388
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,763
[SPEAKER_02]: The Daily News in Sweden is saying that the Wii console will be between 2,500 and 3,000 kronor.

389
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:55,444
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you translate that into U.S.

390
00:25:55,524 --> 00:25:57,385
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars, that's 340 U.S.

391
00:25:57,445 --> 00:25:57,705
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars.

392
00:25:57,745 --> 00:25:59,306
[SPEAKER_02]: But keep in mind...

393
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,214
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe, they tend to get screwed on the prices of the consoles.

394
00:26:09,254 --> 00:26:09,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.

395
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:19,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But probably the Wii would then be in the $250 to $300 ballpark, which is a little higher than the $199 we're all assuming.

396
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:19,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts?

397
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:21,007
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's $199.

398
00:26:21,608 --> 00:26:24,771
[SPEAKER_01]: All their other systems have launched for $199, as far as my memory serves me.

399
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

400
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're going to do the anniversary of the NES launch, why not do the price?

401
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:32,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

402
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:34,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of us are sold on $199.

403
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:37,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of the price that Nintendo's expected to meet.

404
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:42,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm agreeing more with the $250 price point.

405
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:43,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?

406
00:26:44,726 --> 00:26:55,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's still competitive without being, I would say, prohibitively... It's not going to...

407
00:26:57,169 --> 00:27:01,192
[SPEAKER_00]: They can still make their money on it and yet still have it be generally affordable for most people.

408
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:25,789
[SPEAKER_02]: 250 or rather 249 would be cutting it a little close.

409
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:28,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in that case, Nintendo would have definitely done the 199.

410
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:37,712
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that PlayStation 3 has really highballed it, maybe they can release it for 249 and it's still the cheap system.

411
00:27:38,072 --> 00:27:38,452
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

412
00:27:38,472 --> 00:27:39,272
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about that 199.

413
00:27:39,632 --> 00:27:47,114
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be waiting to see what Microsoft's going to do as far as dropping the price of their console.

414
00:27:48,294 --> 00:27:50,976
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, too, because Microsoft may have come out of that conference.

415
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:55,158
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have, hypothetically, come out of that conference and said, we're cutting the price of our core system.

416
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:58,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And that maybe was something Nintendo wanted to be prepared for.

417
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:06,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another thought, though, especially in this whole dual levels, the core and the premium and then the PS3, little drive and big drive.

418
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,566
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been done before with the original NES.

419
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,006
[SPEAKER_02]: You had the regular NES system.

420
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:13,187
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually had three levels, right?

421
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:14,247
[SPEAKER_02]: You had the regular NES.

422
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you had the, I don't know, was it the action pack?

423
00:28:16,907 --> 00:28:20,088
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that came with the light gun and the duck hunt in Mario Brothers.

424
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:24,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was the, I don't remember what it was called, the robot pack or some other type of pack.

425
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,149
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the one with Gyromite.

426
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:28,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and it had Rob the Robot as well.

427
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:28,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

428
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And wasn't there one also with the power pad and duck hunt?

429
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there was.

430
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Years later, yes.

431
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:33,731
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

432
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:34,731
[SPEAKER_02]: The world class track meet.

433
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:38,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So hypothetically, couldn't Wii possibly be launching $199, $249?

434
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:48,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe $199, I don't know, system controller, virtual console points only, and $249, all that plus Wii Sports.

435
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:54,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they want to simplify it, and they're not going to try to do that, because their market is for new gamers.

436
00:28:54,594 --> 00:29:01,535
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to try to confuse them with two different price points and stuff, and trying to get you to buy the more expensive system.

437
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they're going to do that.

438
00:29:03,356 --> 00:29:04,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they haven't done that with

439
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:08,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of their consoles, you know, anything recent.

440
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, you know, I wouldn't see them doing that.

441
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, comments from the chat room.

442
00:29:15,156 --> 00:29:17,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of interesting thoughts on the price point here.

443
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:18,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Funnydale says,

444
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:31,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Microsoft can afford to drop it that low right now.

445
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:32,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Next year, maybe.

446
00:29:33,033 --> 00:29:34,353
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, I don't know.

447
00:29:34,393 --> 00:29:41,256
[SPEAKER_02]: It still seems... Microsoft still has the whole high-definition thing to sell the consoles with, right?

448
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:43,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they need to drop their console price.

449
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:47,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they... Because they know they're not competing with Nintendo as far as

450
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:51,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Next Gen, Nintendo's in their own kind of game.

451
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:52,979
[SPEAKER_02]: There was that whole endorsement.

452
00:29:53,079 --> 00:30:01,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Both companies, Microsoft and Sony, have practically said, sure, get a Nintendo, as long as you don't buy Microsoft, Sony, whatever the competitor is.

453
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:02,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, get a Wii.

454
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:04,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's funny.

455
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting thought here.

456
00:30:06,948 --> 00:30:07,689
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that, too.

457
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:10,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Spirit Snare has a thought.

458
00:30:10,405 --> 00:30:13,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Sky, the core console wasn't changed.

459
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were merely bundles.

460
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:21,610
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point, but, you know, and somebody else said, DMN said, you guys forget those were accessories.

461
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:27,433
[SPEAKER_02]: True, but the Wii has an assortment of accessories as well to play with, right?

462
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:29,875
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the classic controller, the light gun.

463
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:32,595
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not some of these things?

464
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:44,699
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the point is that that's not really right to compare it to the way Xbox is doing their bundle and the way that Nintendo, because Nintendo's is actually different stuff on the system itself.

465
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:45,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand that.

466
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:54,062
[SPEAKER_02]: All I'm trying to say is could Nintendo launch two different Wii, one at $199 and one at $249 with different stuff?

467
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:55,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, right?

468
00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:57,903
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what, they could do different bundles.

469
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly think that the way

470
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:10,735
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to keep it at $199, what they need to do is to have a pack with this particular thing, a pack with this particular thing, a pack with this particular thing.

471
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:13,076
[SPEAKER_00]: You pick the one that you want to get based on the types of games you like.

472
00:31:13,857 --> 00:31:14,237
[SPEAKER_00]: And then...

473
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:22,868
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get special deal with this thing for another X amount of money to get all the other accessories coming to a total of $250.

474
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:24,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And how Nintendo would this be?

475
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:29,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Release like a blue pack and a red pack and a, I don't know, white pack or something?

476
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:30,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have a white, black, and blue.

477
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:38,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

478
00:31:40,263 --> 00:31:46,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think it's going to get that crazy because I don't think they're going to complicate it.

479
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:50,011
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a good thought, though, that, you know, there's all different types of ways Nintendo could do this.

480
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:59,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we could hypothesize until the cows come home, but we won't know anything for sure until Nintendo confirms, which hopefully will be soon.

481
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:04,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what else is coming with the Wii?

482
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:23,811
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the only console out there with a web browser built into it.

483
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:25,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, since maybe the Dreamcast?

484
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:32,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in the interest of disclosure here, I think there's a story coming up later on tonight about the PS3 interface has been shown and there was a web browser integrated in the PS3.

485
00:32:32,996 --> 00:32:33,876
[SPEAKER_02]: So just, you know, big deal.

486
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:36,738
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Dreamcast web browser was not actually part of the system.

487
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:37,418
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a disk.

488
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:38,339
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

489
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:40,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, whatever.

490
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,560
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean...

491
00:32:42,324 --> 00:32:44,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, goody, the PlayStation 3 web browser.

492
00:32:45,026 --> 00:32:45,606
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know what, though?

493
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:46,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I applaud this.

494
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:47,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Applause, applause, applause.

495
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:56,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Having the Opera browser here because it shows... You know, I think... Well, I was already really sold on this, but it definitely shows Nintendo is embracing online.

496
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:58,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Nintendo.

497
00:32:58,135 --> 00:32:58,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

498
00:32:58,896 --> 00:32:59,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite.

499
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:00,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right.

500
00:33:00,797 --> 00:33:07,802
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not really embracing online because Metroid Prime 3, not online multiplayer.

501
00:33:10,264 --> 00:33:10,964
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of their...

502
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:16,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of getting it, but not quite 100% yet.

503
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:26,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Nintendo has an interesting enough thing going on with the whole controller aspect that Metroid doesn't need to be multiplayer yet.

504
00:33:26,469 --> 00:33:29,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do that when Metroid 4 can be online multiplayer?

505
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:35,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo, the original, wasn't multiplayer, but then again, Xbox Live wasn't quite what it was at that point.

506
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:36,154
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, though, land it.

507
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:41,978
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done the four Xbox hookup LAN parties on Halo.

508
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:52,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't mean that they couldn't, yeah, and it doesn't mean that you couldn't maybe later on, you know, upgrade it or add a, you know, an update.

509
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:56,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, you know, special edition with online multiplayer.

510
00:33:57,112 --> 00:34:00,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just, you know, was it Nintendo Connect 24 or whatever?

511
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:11,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Ion671 says, so you can pay $500 to surf the web on the PS3.

512
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:13,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but here's the thing, though.

513
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:20,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360, this is one thing they're kind of lacking right now, which is surprising, seeing as Microsoft had the web TV thing a while back, right?

514
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of surprised that 360 doesn't have a web browser yet.

515
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,411
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little surprising.

516
00:34:26,634 --> 00:34:28,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not the end of the world.

517
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:30,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I can surf the web on my computer, yeah.

518
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:34,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe this is what Microsoft realizes, is that why put a web browser in here?

519
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:35,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know...

520
00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:37,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people surf the web on their computers.

521
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:39,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's kind of a neat feature.

522
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:43,934
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something kind of neat about having a website right there on the television.

523
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:48,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And think about some of those games that have websites accessible from within the game.

524
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:56,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know this is a real weak example, but Phantasy Star on the GameCube, you kind of went on the Phantasy Star website and you could actually like read the forums and stuff from the GameCube.

525
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:58,884
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.

526
00:34:58,904 --> 00:35:03,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's kind of a weak example, but you could supplement games with websites right on the TV, right?

527
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:04,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

528
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:06,096
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be cool too.

529
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:09,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Text entry on those websites via the DS.

530
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:11,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

531
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:14,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't the Opera browser on the DS, isn't that supposed to have handwriting recognition?

532
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:15,899
[SPEAKER_01]: I seem to remember seeing that.

533
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:16,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

534
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,421
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so it'd be pretty good.

535
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:23,162
[SPEAKER_02]: SpiritsNair says, Sky, but web TV sucked.

536
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:25,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, true, but the technology's there.

537
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:27,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Funnydale says, So what?

538
00:35:27,263 --> 00:35:30,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft can offer a web browser free on Xbox Live next week.

539
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:32,865
[SPEAKER_02]: True, but they haven't yet.

540
00:35:33,225 --> 00:35:34,265
[SPEAKER_02]: They can, but they haven't.

541
00:35:37,272 --> 00:35:38,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw says, Very true, Sky.

542
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Many websites have Flash games.

543
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not play the Flash games on the TV?

544
00:35:42,884 --> 00:35:46,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe Microsoft doesn't want that because then they wouldn't be able to sell Bejeweled.

545
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:46,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

546
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:47,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

547
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:49,193
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

548
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:20,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in Louisiana, the House unanimously passed, basically, HB 1381 on Tuesday.

549
00:36:21,414 --> 00:36:32,959
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bill that applies the Miller obscenity test to video games, sort of like the whole games as porn tactic that's been going on.

550
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:33,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

551
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:37,063
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some information from Game Politics on this one.

552
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, a few interesting quotes.

553
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,086
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people who are just really pissed off over this.

554
00:36:41,206 --> 00:36:43,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just as stupid as I do, probably.

555
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:47,130
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the editors for the Daily Comet...

556
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:51,607
[SPEAKER_00]: stated, and I quote, Why does the government feel the need to parent children?

557
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:52,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen!

558
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:52,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you!

559
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:53,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

560
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:57,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Few will be persuaded that violent video games or movies have a negative effect on children.

561
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,810
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a game.

562
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,630
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a movie.

563
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,931
[SPEAKER_00]: People are smart enough to distinguish the difference, some believe.

564
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:06,153
[SPEAKER_00]: As for me, I believe I can give better guidance to my children than Baton Rouge or Washington.

565
00:37:08,054 --> 00:37:10,715
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's another funny one on here, though, that...

566
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:12,933
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me laugh.

567
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:16,995
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually by the editor of the Home I Care Courier.

568
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:23,099
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I could watch football from now until the cows come home, but I wouldn't be able to throw like Brett, I guess it's Favre, F-A-V-R-E.

569
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:25,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't watch football, so I don't really care.

570
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:29,582
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could play Grand Theft Auto for the next 12 years.

571
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I would be looking for policemen to murder or prostitutes to pimp.

572
00:37:33,124 --> 00:37:40,307
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because, and let me phrase this correctly so that even the Solons in Baton Rouge can comprehend the message, it's just a game.

573
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:46,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually reading the text of the bill here, which you can access on GamePolitik's website.

574
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:49,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kind of reading what they want to add into the law here.

575
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:49,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

576
00:37:49,984 --> 00:37:52,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Prohibited sales of video or computer games to minors.

577
00:37:52,668 --> 00:37:56,993
[SPEAKER_02]: A. An interactive video or computer game should not be sold, leased, or rented to a minor if a tree or

578
00:37:58,007 --> 00:38:00,088
[SPEAKER_02]: If the Trier of Facts determines all of the following.

579
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:00,088
1.

580
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:09,193
[SPEAKER_02]: The average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the video or computer game taken as a whole appeals to the minor's morbid interest in violence.

581
00:38:09,753 --> 00:38:10,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Vague.

582
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:10,053
2.

583
00:38:11,154 --> 00:38:17,117
[SPEAKER_02]: The game depicts violence in a manner patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable for minors.

584
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:18,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Vague.

585
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:18,037
3.

586
00:38:18,578 --> 00:38:23,740
[SPEAKER_02]: The game taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value for minors.

587
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,321
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is that supposed to mean?

588
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:33,924
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another... It's basically... It's another just attempt of the government trying to control children.

589
00:38:34,024 --> 00:38:44,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, basically trying to have control over how children are raised trying to do the parent's job for them so they grow up to be nice little, you know, mindless sheep for them to have them later in the future.

590
00:38:44,853 --> 00:38:46,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's going to determine that?

591
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:51,458
[SPEAKER_02]: The game lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.

592
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:54,420
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got established standards.

593
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,782
[SPEAKER_00]: See, they're trying to apply something...

594
00:38:58,306 --> 00:38:59,687
[SPEAKER_00]: is not applicable for our game.

595
00:39:01,788 --> 00:39:08,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but you can't even really apply this to movies or even books.

596
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:14,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who's to judge whether this is of literary or artistic value?

597
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:16,919
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you judge art?

598
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Art is not meant to be judged.

599
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:20,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Art is meant to be interpreted.

600
00:39:21,482 --> 00:39:24,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, apparently that's their interpretation of it.

601
00:39:24,324 --> 00:39:24,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it stinks.

602
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:39,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then again, you know, with the, there was, remember the whole outcry they were having with the tour of the statue David going around?

603
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:40,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's nude.

604
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,028
[SPEAKER_00]: It's art!

605
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:46,111
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually a big deal when I was in Alabama.

606
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:47,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get that.

607
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:48,853
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a penis.

608
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:51,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of America's already seen one, at least.

609
00:39:51,876 --> 00:39:54,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other half probably did see one already.

610
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, that's what I meant.

611
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:00,842
[SPEAKER_02]: They've seen their own, or they've probably seen one, one way or another.

612
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:01,863
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the big deal?

613
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,486
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of put that in the same category.

614
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:11,690
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the whole closed-minded censure of things that...

615
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:18,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Their version of inappropriateness, but I really, I really, really think that there is an ulterior motive to all this.

616
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:33,823
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, I honestly, as much as we're seeing this coming, especially, and Republicans don't, you know, get all upset with me or anything, coming out of the Republican camp and coming out of the Democrats too, because, you know, we've got Hillary spearheading all this bullcrap.

617
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:38,864
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got our two major...

618
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,390
[SPEAKER_00]: and DarkSakura.com

619
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:11,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Our chatroom is just lighting up, like line after line after line on this here right now.

620
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:13,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen the chatroom scroll so fast.

621
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,343
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf makes the smart-ass comment, Africa has artistic value.

622
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:23,646
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation 3 title that made most of us go, what the F is this?

623
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

624
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:27,648
[SPEAKER_02]: SpiritSnare says, artistic?

625
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:29,950
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to play fucking Mario Paint, okay?

626
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:32,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, very interesting there.

627
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:39,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Funnydale says, to all of the gamers who say that if we just ignore Jack Thompson, he will then go away, this proves this is not true.

628
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting thought.

629
00:41:42,181 --> 00:41:42,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

630
00:41:42,802 --> 00:41:44,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he was also a chief witness at that.

631
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice that?

632
00:41:46,631 --> 00:41:47,231
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.

633
00:41:47,831 --> 00:41:49,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a comment here.

634
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:51,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to do another quote.

635
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:53,014
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from the Shreveport Times.

636
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:59,897
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, The fact that Jack Thompson was testifying in favor of the bill should immediately set off alarms.

637
00:42:00,297 --> 00:42:09,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Thompson evokes no one so strongly as Frederick Wortham, a psychologist whose 1950s book, Seduction of the Innocent, led to the congressional hearings on the dangers of comic books.

638
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:10,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

639
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:23,094
[SPEAKER_02]: more comments in the chat room here GS191, I'm tired of game politics the politicians will never get video games I say let them pass their stupid laws it's going to be us that's going to gain control and take out the laws in the long run

640
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:25,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Not if they are successful.

641
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:27,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my thought, guys.

642
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:29,844
[SPEAKER_02]: If this makes you mad, don't write us a letter.

643
00:42:29,904 --> 00:42:31,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, we of course want your feedback.

644
00:42:31,745 --> 00:42:32,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and write us a letter.

645
00:42:32,645 --> 00:42:37,187
[SPEAKER_02]: But you need to be writing your congressman a letter, especially if you're over the age of 18.

646
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:39,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And here, I'm going to start your letter for you.

647
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:44,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Congressman, I am a registered voter.

648
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Then go ahead and express yourself cleanly, please.

649
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,473
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just for all the people who say, though, that we are...

650
00:42:53,648 --> 00:42:55,010
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be in power.

651
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:59,675
[SPEAKER_00]: The younger generation is going to be the one to overthrow that.

652
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:04,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine what's going to happen if they're successful in censoring what that generation sees.

653
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:05,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that what everyone said in the 60s?

654
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:06,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

655
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:09,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

656
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:11,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't alive in the 60s.

657
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but I'm just saying, you know, you kind of look back on that whole, you know, hippie movement and everything, and I have a feeling they were saying the same thing.

658
00:43:18,284 --> 00:43:20,585
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot more to it than that necessarily, the hippie movement.

659
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:25,988
[SPEAKER_00]: That was around a whole war and... Okay, so I'm making a very broad generalization.

660
00:43:26,008 --> 00:43:27,169
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were fucking like bunnies.

661
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:28,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

662
00:43:29,711 --> 00:43:30,851
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm serious.

663
00:43:31,032 --> 00:43:33,193
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly do think that that's their agenda.

664
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:47,083
[SPEAKER_00]: from what it's looking like, this is just my own little conspiracy theory here I think that, you know, honestly I think that they're afraid of having an open-minded youth about having people there who's going to question

665
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,791
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of just blindly follow their lead.

666
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:52,512
[SPEAKER_00]: They lose power if you don't blindly follow.

667
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:56,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks in the chat room are saying that they're too young so they'll just write us a letter.

668
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's fine, but here's a better thought.

669
00:44:00,155 --> 00:44:03,456
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're too young, talk to somebody who is a registered voter.

670
00:44:03,576 --> 00:44:04,977
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still have an impact.

671
00:44:05,657 --> 00:44:06,698
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still have an impact.

672
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I say talk to your parents about it.

673
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:13,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be great to talk to your parents about your thoughts on that.

674
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:14,641
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still write your congressman.

675
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:15,824
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

676
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:16,766
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still do it.

677
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:20,790
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, hey, I am X years old and by this election I will be registered to vote.

678
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:21,331
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very true.

679
00:44:21,371 --> 00:44:23,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine most of you guys that listen to this show... Block the vote.

680
00:44:23,813 --> 00:44:24,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that?

681
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:30,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to get people who were just turning 18 who were kids to... Vote or P. Diddy will kill you?

682
00:44:31,522 --> 00:44:32,223
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean, though.

683
00:44:32,263 --> 00:44:34,465
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same thing.

684
00:44:34,686 --> 00:44:35,747
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still write in.

685
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:38,430
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still get your voice out there.

686
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:41,853
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm going to end on this note because Roz, I think, just won the chat room here.

687
00:44:41,873 --> 00:44:47,117
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to keep it moving, but Roz says, Dear Jack Thompson, you are a giant enemy crab.

688
00:44:47,377 --> 00:44:49,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit you in your weak spot for massive damage.

689
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:50,139
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

690
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridge Racer.

691
00:44:53,822 --> 00:44:54,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Roz, I love you.

692
00:44:57,365 --> 00:44:58,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to another story.

693
00:44:58,686 --> 00:44:59,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

694
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:00,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

695
00:45:00,627 --> 00:45:01,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Hacking and cracking.

696
00:45:02,168 --> 00:45:02,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

697
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:04,190
[SPEAKER_02]: On the XB360.

698
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:04,730
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

699
00:45:05,171 --> 00:45:06,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they...

700
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:20,730
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually were able to, as I think a while back there was a video of them hacking the 360 to play backups of discs.

701
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they were successful on some of the 360s.

702
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:32,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the 360 comes with either one of two optical drives, either a Toshiba Samsung drive or a Hitachi drive.

703
00:45:32,892 --> 00:45:36,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have the Toshiba Samsung drive, well guess what?

704
00:45:37,617 --> 00:45:44,338
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually mod your firmware on the actual optical disk drive and be able to play backups.

705
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:51,319
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically what it does is it kind of works the same way that they did with the Xbox One firmware and their disk drives.

706
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:55,680
[SPEAKER_01]: It patches the response to the media check into the disk drive.

707
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,661
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically when you pop in a game, it will check, okay, is this a burnt disk?

708
00:45:59,861 --> 00:46:03,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a pressed disk from Microsoft?

709
00:46:03,622 --> 00:46:04,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a CD?

710
00:46:04,722 --> 00:46:06,362
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of media am I reading?

711
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:12,697
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, usually if you have a DVD plus R or something like that, it's not going to play it if it's a game.

712
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:19,202
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this does is no matter what the hell you put into it, it replies back to the system saying, yep, we're good, play the game.

713
00:46:19,662 --> 00:46:27,008
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, right now they're working on a way to be able to get to work on the Hitachi drives.

714
00:46:27,403 --> 00:46:28,324
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what do you think?

715
00:46:28,364 --> 00:46:30,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft going to be happy about this?

716
00:46:52,557 --> 00:46:59,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically, they've issued an official statement to warn the 360 owners about messing with their system, pretty much.

717
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:04,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they're saying the core security system has not been broken.

718
00:47:04,963 --> 00:47:17,330
[SPEAKER_00]: However, on some Xbox 360 consoles, the authentication protocol between the optical disk drive and the console may be attacked via complex software and hardware modification, which could allow people to play illegally copied and modified games.

719
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:25,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, pretty much what they're talking about is, yeah, you do that, you void your warranty.

720
00:47:26,193 --> 00:47:27,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that the classic response?

721
00:47:27,474 --> 00:47:28,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't void your warranty!

722
00:47:28,995 --> 00:47:38,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's another thing, too, that they're working on right now, is they're actually having multiple BIOSes on the chip, on the actual DVD drive, so, basically, the flip of switch, I want to play it on live.

723
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:49,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Flip the switch over, runs off the original thing, you can't play the, you know, the copy thing, but you can, um, you know, and they might not even be able to detect, you might be able to break that, so it can't detect what your firmware is on the, um,

724
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,441
[SPEAKER_01]: GK128 Mess with your 360s, say goodbye to live, bitch!

725
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,966
[SPEAKER_02]: and DMN says, Dear 360 owners, don't fuck with your firmware.

726
00:48:20,006 --> 00:48:20,366
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

727
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:21,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridge Racer.

728
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:24,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're full of comedians tonight in Orange Launch Radio chat.

729
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:27,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to become our new cake or death?

730
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:28,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

731
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:36,594
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the new inside, or not really inside joke, but line of the week that's going to just get beat into the ground until you're all sick of it, if you're not already.

732
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:38,475
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

733
00:48:39,775 --> 00:48:40,956
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 Pre-Orders at GameStop and EB Games

734
00:49:00,149 --> 00:49:10,575
[SPEAKER_02]: A rumor is I guess what they're trying to do is go or try to avoid what happened with Xbox 360 where they were taking pre-orders for a long time and it was too many pre-orders to fill essentially.

735
00:49:10,595 --> 00:49:17,299
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't get enough systems and when they couldn't deliver people's systems until February or March, who got the flack for that?

736
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:18,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft?

737
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:18,420
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

738
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,641
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop and EB Games did because why aren't you getting enough consoles?

739
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,142
[SPEAKER_02]: People maybe didn't really know where to place the blame.

740
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:34,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So GameStop and EB are thinking this time, okay, if we only open it up for a certain window, then folks, we won't have such a huge list.

741
00:49:34,165 --> 00:49:35,025
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

742
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:39,987
[SPEAKER_02]: If people find out the day the GameStop's going to start taking orders, people are going to be lined up that morning.

743
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:51,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, the Sony fanboys anyway, you know, say what you want about whether you're going to get or not get a PlayStation 3, but the rabid launch fans, there's enough of them where, you know, there'll be a line going out the door the day they start taking pre-orders.

744
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:59,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this will help that situation a little bit, but it's not going to, if Sony can't produce the systems, it's going to be the same thing all over again.

745
00:50:00,351 --> 00:50:03,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, their launch windows, like, their launch games suck.

746
00:50:03,894 --> 00:50:04,654
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you never know.

747
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:07,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anyways, we'll get to that later.

748
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:08,177
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

749
00:50:08,337 --> 00:50:08,617
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

750
00:50:10,205 --> 00:50:18,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving right along, DarkSakura likes to kind of look around at different websites, including those overseas, and UK reaction to the price?

751
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:25,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, according, there's actually been an official price released for the UK in particular.

752
00:50:26,912 --> 00:50:35,956
[SPEAKER_00]: They're releasing it, basically they're releasing it for 425 pounds for the 60 gig model, but there's not any type of word if they're getting the 20 gigabyte model.

753
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:39,784
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, what's the point since it has no HDMI?

754
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:41,745
[SPEAKER_00]: No Wi-Fi.

755
00:50:42,766 --> 00:50:45,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, unless you don't plan on having an HDTV in the next few years.

756
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:46,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

757
00:50:46,489 --> 00:50:53,355
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is funny, though, because in euros, it's 599 euros for the 60 gigabyte, which goes to 405 pounds.

758
00:50:53,915 --> 00:50:59,680
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, they're not getting it for that good of a deal.

759
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:05,584
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's off a little bit, but still going to be a little bit more expensive than the general price in euros.

760
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:09,352
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really trying to push the Blu-ray thing.

761
00:51:09,572 --> 00:51:18,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Their managing director for Sony UK, Ray McGuire, is basically going around saying, Oh, Blu-ray!

762
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:20,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Blu-ray player is 600 to 700 pounds.

763
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,741
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a big deal.

764
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:23,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Blu-ray, Blu-ray, Blu-ray.

765
00:51:23,203 --> 00:51:26,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, where was the Blu-ray movie on the E3 show floor?

766
00:51:26,645 --> 00:51:27,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering that myself.

767
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:30,949
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, they're...

768
00:51:34,923 --> 00:51:40,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of negative reaction to it just from the nature of his statement.

769
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:47,367
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that most people don't realize what they're actually getting with a PlayStation 3.

770
00:51:47,507 --> 00:51:54,210
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, they're getting something that's not going to be what you're trying to make it out to be.

771
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,011
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, it's still going to be more expensive there than it is here.

772
00:51:59,844 --> 00:52:02,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting comment in our chatroom from Funnydale.

773
00:52:03,066 --> 00:52:05,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, quick griping about the price of the PlayStation 3.

774
00:52:05,588 --> 00:52:07,830
[SPEAKER_02]: People pay $500 for a fucking iPod.

775
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,892
[SPEAKER_02]: They pay $500 for a damn video card.

776
00:52:10,212 --> 00:52:12,313
[SPEAKER_02]: They will pay $600 for a PlayStation 3.

777
00:52:13,854 --> 00:52:17,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, yeah, there are going to be people that will pay the $600 for a PlayStation 3.

778
00:52:19,238 --> 00:52:19,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

779
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,522
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the same retards that bought DVHS also.

780
00:52:23,622 --> 00:52:27,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I have to have every system, I will pay $600 for the PlayStation 3.

781
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:28,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be happy about it, but I will do it.

782
00:52:29,727 --> 00:52:40,715
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, the iPod, if you want to make that comparison, didn't really achieve huge amounts of success until they released cheaper models that still got the job done.

783
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:41,255
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

784
00:52:41,535 --> 00:52:42,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I never bought an iPod.

785
00:52:43,317 --> 00:52:45,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you did the free iPod thing, right?

786
00:52:45,418 --> 00:52:45,999
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a free iPod.

787
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:48,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure they'll do a free PS3 if you want to go that route.

788
00:52:48,921 --> 00:52:49,841
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already out there.

789
00:52:51,723 --> 00:52:53,264
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a controversial thing, but whatever.

790
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:57,186
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what makes it work for you, then go for it.

791
00:52:57,667 --> 00:52:57,827
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

792
00:52:59,222 --> 00:53:00,643
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Bobby's comment.

793
00:53:02,324 --> 00:53:04,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Bobby going for the jugular there.

794
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:06,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki paid $600 for an Xbox 360, didn't he?

795
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:09,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that was $700 for a 360.

796
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:12,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So why all the PS3 hate?

797
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:16,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you think you're going to be paying $300 more if you end up going eBay or what?

798
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,151
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just don't.

799
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:21,877
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really any games for me that I want to get right at launch.

800
00:53:21,897 --> 00:53:22,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you not going to get it at launch?

801
00:53:23,438 --> 00:53:23,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not.

802
00:53:24,038 --> 00:53:25,779
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to see what their launch games are going to be.

803
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:29,541
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really going to determine it for me because it's all about the games.

804
00:53:29,601 --> 00:53:30,061
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

805
00:53:30,221 --> 00:53:31,262
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't have that many...

806
00:53:31,926 --> 00:53:34,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Good games at launch or if it's not what I like, I'll wait.

807
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:42,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I'm about an 80% yes on it because I know I can benefit from the Blu-ray being an HDTV owner and all that stuff.

808
00:53:44,493 --> 00:53:48,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, a large part of why I'm saying this is because I have to have all the consoles.

809
00:53:48,936 --> 00:53:49,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them all.

810
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:52,298
[SPEAKER_02]: But I realize everybody's not like that.

811
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:53,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I say that now and you know.

812
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:57,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all the hype will start a month before and you'll be like, I have to have one.

813
00:53:57,981 --> 00:53:58,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Paris Hilton has one.

814
00:53:58,862 --> 00:53:59,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't I have one?

815
00:54:00,325 --> 00:54:00,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

816
00:54:01,485 --> 00:54:01,765
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

817
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:07,307
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just people are looking at like a game system.

818
00:54:08,067 --> 00:54:12,609
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're not seeing the long life that they might see in something else.

819
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:13,369
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

820
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:15,850
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just still.

821
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:20,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a comment from Ota G, who I haven't read anything from tonight in our chat room.

822
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:21,391
[SPEAKER_02]: OrangeLaunchReady.com, click on chat.

823
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,932
[SPEAKER_02]: The price of the PlayStation 3 isn't the problem.

824
00:54:23,992 --> 00:54:26,433
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that Sony hasn't justified it is.

825
00:54:27,553 --> 00:54:27,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

826
00:54:28,837 --> 00:54:29,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Debate, Debate

827
00:54:52,529 --> 00:54:54,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother 3 is going to get an English translation in Europe.

828
00:55:15,393 --> 00:55:22,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hooray for Europe, but if you're in the United States, you're still not happy because E3 went by and still no Mother 3 announcement for the US.

829
00:55:22,616 --> 00:55:23,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Import the bitch.

830
00:55:23,516 --> 00:55:24,817
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no lockout guard.

831
00:55:25,097 --> 00:55:28,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's no region differences on these.

832
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:29,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Just import it.

833
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're going to have to pay the higher price.

834
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:31,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Import!

835
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon UK!

836
00:55:33,981 --> 00:55:43,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just to make it clear, the official Nintendo magazine in the UK is saying that it will come out in December in Europe and it's going to be released for the Game Boy Advance edition.

837
00:55:44,285 --> 00:55:45,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Game Boy Advance.

838
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:47,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you're right though.

839
00:55:47,898 --> 00:55:54,921
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to pay the extra bucks there, or import it through UK, just pay the slightly higher shipping fees, at least you get your English translation.

840
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:56,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it's not all bad news.

841
00:55:56,682 --> 00:55:58,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a damn lot of people that will do it.

842
00:55:59,243 --> 00:56:09,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think Nintendo of America is kind of... I mean, I guess all the money goes to Nintendo in the end, but I think Nintendo of America at least, at least, if nothing else, print...

843
00:56:10,129 --> 00:56:13,972
[SPEAKER_02]: A low run and do what you did with the electro plankton.

844
00:56:14,012 --> 00:56:15,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Sell it on your website or something.

845
00:56:15,694 --> 00:56:17,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Just release it in stores and don't advertise for it.

846
00:56:19,236 --> 00:56:24,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't believe something like this won't come out here, especially when an English translation is now done.

847
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:27,963
[SPEAKER_02]: But freaking Dr. Sudoku out there on store shelves.

848
00:56:29,725 --> 00:56:30,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get it.

849
00:56:30,425 --> 00:56:30,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Baffles me.

850
00:56:32,607 --> 00:56:33,728
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because people are crazy.

851
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised how much...

852
00:56:47,711 --> 00:56:51,252
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember seeing Sudoku in magazines and going, wow, I have to do math?

853
00:56:51,312 --> 00:56:51,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.

854
00:56:53,092 --> 00:56:54,233
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to have a different name.

855
00:56:54,273 --> 00:56:56,153
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't always called Sudoku here in America.

856
00:56:56,193 --> 00:57:00,454
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to print those in the penny press publications as crypto numbers or something like that.

857
00:57:00,694 --> 00:57:02,475
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all over the place now.

858
00:57:03,275 --> 00:57:05,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I'm looking for them, I'm like, holy crap.

859
00:57:05,516 --> 00:57:15,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the honest justification for Dr. Sudoku on the Game Boy Advance or whatever is because Nintendo wants to go after everyone, not just gamers, and

860
00:57:16,018 --> 00:57:17,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it in the workplace.

861
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:29,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people that are not your typical types of gamers, you know, mothers and folks that you don't typically think of as gamers bring in their Sudoku magazines and they'll play Sudoku on break.

862
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,113
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a really good exercise for the brain, the whole brain training thing.

863
00:57:33,593 --> 00:57:36,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can see why this is justified in Nintendo's eyes, but you know,

864
00:57:38,171 --> 00:57:39,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, come on.

865
00:57:40,533 --> 00:57:42,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Why give us this out there and not Mother 3?

866
00:57:42,515 --> 00:57:42,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

867
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:45,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think Nintendo's going to announce it later.

868
00:57:45,758 --> 00:57:48,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's going to be another Nintendo press conference.

869
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:53,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there has to be because they're going to announce all the Wii stuff and I think they're going to drop some of these bombshells too.

870
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:57,789
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm still hopeful Mother 3's coming to the US.

871
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:59,651
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do I know?

872
00:58:01,272 --> 00:58:01,593
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

873
00:58:01,613 --> 00:58:02,053
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know?

874
00:58:02,674 --> 00:58:02,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

875
00:58:04,312 --> 00:58:05,373
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

876
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:43,566
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Cossacks 2 Battle for Europe, Jill Dozer for the GBA, Hitman Blood Money for a whole bunch of stuff, Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis, Rush for Berlin on PC, Super Princess Peach on the DS, About Damn Time, it's the PMS game.

877
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:47,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you want to control an overly emotional woman, have fun with Super Princess Peach.

878
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:49,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you know you can't ever do that?

879
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:52,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you can't.

880
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:57,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to the wonder of technology of video games, now you can.

881
00:58:58,809 --> 00:58:59,449
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think.

882
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:00,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart, love ya.

883
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,771
[SPEAKER_00]: And since this is the only other one on here, I'll go ahead and say it.

884
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,951
[SPEAKER_00]: On the 31st, Talk Man on PSP is coming out.

885
00:59:06,472 --> 00:59:06,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

886
00:59:07,435 --> 00:59:08,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Heroes of Might and Magic 5

887
00:59:31,437 --> 00:59:34,820
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people like my magic, so don't be knocking.

888
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,782
[SPEAKER_01]: and then, of course, Rogue Trooper on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

889
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:12,024
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my favorite for the week, Jaws Unleashed, where you get to play the shark and get to dismember divers.

890
01:00:12,044 --> 01:00:12,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally!

891
01:00:12,964 --> 01:00:14,585
[SPEAKER_01]: How long ago was that game supposed to come out?

892
01:00:14,825 --> 01:00:15,585
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time ago.

893
01:00:15,826 --> 01:00:17,406
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care how cheesy this game is.

894
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:20,767
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Echo the Dolphin with rabies.

895
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:21,468
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

896
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,081
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like snakes on a plane.

897
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:25,181
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the big deal with that movie?

898
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:27,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's snakes on a freaking plane.

899
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:31,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, Jaws, the game, yeah, it might suck, but it's Jaws.

900
01:00:31,403 --> 01:00:33,103
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to be the shark.

901
01:00:34,784 --> 01:00:35,944
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to eat people.

902
01:00:36,104 --> 01:00:36,845
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

903
01:00:37,905 --> 01:00:38,785
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to destroy boats.

904
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,106
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Grand Theft Auto with fish.

905
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:41,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Shark edition.

906
01:00:43,487 --> 01:00:44,167
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but anyways.

907
01:00:44,787 --> 01:00:45,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Shark is tasty.

908
01:00:45,588 --> 01:00:49,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And also SteamBot Chronicles is supposed to be coming out on PlayStation 2, which is eh.

909
01:00:50,560 --> 01:01:00,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, after all, they've got a mech known as Bumpy Trots, which sounds like a real bad ass disease or something like that.

910
01:01:00,368 --> 01:01:01,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

911
01:01:01,869 --> 01:01:06,193
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to keep it moving because we've got a lot of stories and we're moving kind of slow tonight.

912
01:01:06,213 --> 01:01:06,673
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

913
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:08,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of stuff to say since it's post E3 here.

914
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:12,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, was there any other release dates?

915
01:01:12,108 --> 01:01:12,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

916
01:01:12,709 --> 01:01:13,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

917
01:01:13,669 --> 01:01:18,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Loki, tell us about a big name in the online community, Major Nelson.

918
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:20,691
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his own little podcast over there.

919
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:21,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, blogcast.

920
01:01:22,411 --> 01:01:23,932
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't use the word podcast in Microsoft.

921
01:01:23,952 --> 01:01:24,732
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a blogcast.

922
01:01:25,412 --> 01:01:26,833
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's he saying about the PlayStation 3?

923
01:01:26,893 --> 01:01:29,473
[SPEAKER_01]: He's saying that their online service is not going to be free.

924
01:01:29,834 --> 01:01:30,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And how does he know this?

925
01:01:30,874 --> 01:01:38,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's basically going off the slides that they had on during the press conference and when they were mentioning free things.

926
01:01:39,237 --> 01:02:08,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Matchmaking and online play were not mentioned I think he says so basically it's going to be an equivalent to Xbox Live's silver level of service right now so you know basically you get to talk to people you know and you do chat and stuff but you can't play games against them for free which you know I don't know I get into the whole thing where I get kind of frustrated with

927
01:02:09,654 --> 01:02:11,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony copying everybody anyways.

928
01:02:11,314 --> 01:02:20,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if online play was free though, it would certainly help justify the price because they could say, hey, you're having to pay $50 extra on Xbox.

929
01:02:21,357 --> 01:02:24,838
[SPEAKER_01]: He is right when he says that stuff wasn't mentioned on the free service.

930
01:02:24,918 --> 01:02:32,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Free service stuff, video chat, latest info, friends list, ranking, account management, player profile, voice messaging, and text messaging.

931
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:33,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see gameplay on there.

932
01:02:37,177 --> 01:02:55,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, moving on, another interesting story on the PlayStation 3, some stealthy video at E3 was shot, and I guess one of those demo rooms for the media only, I guess we weren't cool enough to get invited, but Joystick was, or somebody that ratted to Joystick because they posted some videos on YouTube of the PlayStation 3 interface, and guess what?

933
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:57,910
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very similar to the PSP.

934
01:02:58,490 --> 01:02:59,651
[SPEAKER_02]: PS2 wasn't very interesting

935
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:18,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

936
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:19,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe simplicity is key.

937
01:03:20,072 --> 01:03:21,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it makes a lot of sense when you think about it.

938
01:03:22,193 --> 01:03:26,654
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's interesting is that it really does kind of borrow from the PSP.

939
01:03:26,994 --> 01:03:42,900
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a user's menu where I guess you can sign on as different users, a web browser, which we brought up earlier, and apparently you're going to be able to do multi-windows or tabs or something like that in there as well, and also a friends list, and there'll be voice and video chatting and gaming if you wanted to do that as well.

940
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:45,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

941
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,825
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to check that out, I'm sure you can find it on YouTube very quickly or it's in Joysticks Archives.

942
01:03:48,865 --> 01:03:49,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.

943
01:03:51,508 --> 01:03:52,570
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think about the interface?

944
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:56,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's lazy like everything else that they do.

945
01:03:56,595 --> 01:03:56,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

946
01:03:57,556 --> 01:03:57,897
[SPEAKER_01]: You know...

947
01:03:59,835 --> 01:04:05,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking with my friends at work the other day and just basically ripping off... I'm a huge Sony fanboy.

948
01:04:05,498 --> 01:04:06,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a PlayStation.

949
01:04:06,678 --> 01:04:08,039
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had a PlayStation 2.

950
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:09,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two PSPs.

951
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:11,921
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so, you know, don't get me wrong.

952
01:04:11,961 --> 01:04:12,961
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't hate Sony.

953
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:16,002
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I don't like how they steal everybody's ideas, though.

954
01:04:16,182 --> 01:04:17,643
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like nothing is original for them.

955
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:21,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they try to come out and, like, deny that they've ripped off these ideas.

956
01:04:21,545 --> 01:04:24,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look at the PlayStation 1, for example.

957
01:04:24,426 --> 01:04:28,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, came out, doesn't have analog, doesn't have rumble features.

958
01:04:29,395 --> 01:04:30,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo 64 comes out.

959
01:04:30,856 --> 01:04:32,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Has analog, has rumble.

960
01:04:32,998 --> 01:04:33,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look!

961
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:35,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, now we have the DualShock!

962
01:04:35,981 --> 01:04:36,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on!

963
01:04:37,362 --> 01:04:37,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Retarded!

964
01:04:37,983 --> 01:04:40,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now they come out with their controller design.

965
01:04:40,805 --> 01:04:43,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, by the way, look, now it has tilt features in it.

966
01:04:43,628 --> 01:04:44,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, PlayStation 3.

967
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:46,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, now ours has tilt features in it.

968
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:49,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's copy Xbox Live, but not quite.

969
01:04:50,093 --> 01:04:52,656
[SPEAKER_01]: They can copy, but they can never get it quite right.

970
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:54,017
[SPEAKER_01]: It's... I don't know.

971
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:55,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

972
01:04:56,435 --> 01:05:00,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be interested to see how things, you know, work out for them.

973
01:05:00,557 --> 01:05:03,859
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of wary on their online service, because PlayStation 2's online sucked.

974
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:05,580
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to be honest.

975
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:10,643
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it was online, unlike Mr. GameCube, who had one game.

976
01:05:11,983 --> 01:05:12,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

977
01:05:12,244 --> 01:05:13,124
[SPEAKER_02]: First, you GameCube.

978
01:05:13,204 --> 01:05:13,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Paperweight.

979
01:05:14,004 --> 01:05:15,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on.

980
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:15,945
[SPEAKER_02]: No, wait a minute, though.

981
01:05:16,006 --> 01:05:18,067
[SPEAKER_00]: PlayStation 3, paperweight.

982
01:05:18,127 --> 01:05:20,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, I thought you said GameCube, because I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute.

983
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:20,648
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

984
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:21,860
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

985
01:05:45,058 --> 01:05:48,239
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of attention in the past, but it hasn't gotten a lot of attention lately.

986
01:05:48,959 --> 01:05:52,120
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am talking about nothing other than Weebles Stuff.

987
01:05:53,221 --> 01:06:03,304
[SPEAKER_00]: W-E-E-B-L-S-Stuff.com Yes, it's the home of Badger, Badger, Badger, and Magical Trevor, and Kenya.

988
01:06:05,025 --> 01:06:10,127
[SPEAKER_00]: The most recent one is Crabs, which I find incredibly hilarious.

989
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:10,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have weak points?

990
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:14,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's about a mouthful of crabs.

991
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:20,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of bleeding in it, which sort of makes me think of the whole YAY!

992
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:22,705
[SPEAKER_00]: thing from Rejected.

993
01:06:23,786 --> 01:06:24,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

994
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:30,650
[SPEAKER_00]: There also is the home of Weeble and Bob, which are like two eggs that go, and they're speaking.

995
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:32,891
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one was pretty funny.

996
01:06:33,391 --> 01:06:35,152
[SPEAKER_00]: So, go check them out.

997
01:06:35,953 --> 01:06:37,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure that you look for the ninja one.

998
01:06:38,914 --> 01:06:41,176
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where it is, but the ninja one is somewhere on the site.

999
01:06:44,158 --> 01:06:44,439
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1000
01:06:45,819 --> 01:06:46,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it now.

1001
01:06:46,839 --> 01:06:47,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.

1002
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:48,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Mouthful of Crabs.

1003
01:06:50,641 --> 01:06:51,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Historically accurate, nonetheless.

1004
01:06:54,402 --> 01:06:54,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

1005
01:06:55,782 --> 01:06:56,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Those jokes will never get over.

1006
01:06:56,803 --> 01:06:57,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1007
01:06:58,303 --> 01:06:59,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk some movies.

1008
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:02,645
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a lot of movie and TV stuff, just a barrage of stuff.

1009
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, start us off.

1010
01:07:03,905 --> 01:07:06,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's start off with a really bad idea.

1011
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:06,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad idea.

1012
01:07:07,386 --> 01:07:11,928
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called... Jerry Rockhammer has just signed on to produce a movie called Game Boys.

1013
01:07:13,723 --> 01:07:17,144
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not the true life story of the portable Nintendo system.

1014
01:07:17,945 --> 01:07:37,972
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sci-fi action movie that's basically, the story revolves around two 30-year-old video game junkies recruited by the Department of Homeland Security, which is a joke anyways, to lead a geeky army of gamers in a battle against creatures that have come to life from a video game they have mastered.

1015
01:07:38,332 --> 01:07:39,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like an episode of X-Files to me.

1016
01:07:39,773 --> 01:07:41,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because I think they cover that.

1017
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:51,083
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm really surprised is that Homeland Security does not have a contingency plan for that type of scenario.

1018
01:07:51,323 --> 01:07:52,005
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on!

1019
01:07:55,431 --> 01:07:58,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Going from a really bad idea to a really good idea.

1020
01:07:58,872 --> 01:08:02,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Gear Solid movie was confirmed at E3 in case you missed it.

1021
01:08:02,513 --> 01:08:03,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami had a great parody.

1022
01:08:04,014 --> 01:08:07,795
[SPEAKER_02]: They put out the show Maybe in response to the show Daily.

1023
01:08:08,155 --> 01:08:19,178
[SPEAKER_02]: But something you don't want to miss in there, the show Maybe says, In a late-breaking surprise announcement, director Hideo Kojima revealed that his most famous creation, Metal Gear Solid, is getting the live-action treatment.

1024
01:08:19,538 --> 01:08:23,179
[SPEAKER_02]: He already said hell no to Uebol, so don't worry about that.

1025
01:08:23,459 --> 01:08:27,521
[SPEAKER_02]: But he did say, I've received many offers to adapt Metal Gear Solid.

1026
01:08:27,781 --> 01:08:30,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It has taken a long time, but we have finally settled on an arrangement.

1027
01:08:31,062 --> 01:08:34,823
[SPEAKER_02]: False facts aside, a movie project is underway.

1028
01:08:34,923 --> 01:08:37,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I have finalized a Class A contract with a party in Hollywood.

1029
01:08:38,284 --> 01:08:39,765
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's about all the details you get.

1030
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:43,006
[SPEAKER_02]: No directors, no stars, no dates.

1031
01:08:43,885 --> 01:08:44,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Sams, Blizzard

1032
01:09:13,328 --> 01:09:13,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Dungeons & Dragons

1033
01:09:40,854 --> 01:09:49,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, the group that they're working with is called Legendary, and they want to basically make this really big budget movie.

1034
01:09:51,398 --> 01:09:53,099
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard of Legendary, ever.

1035
01:09:53,419 --> 01:09:57,041
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I think of big blockbuster movies, I don't think, hmm, Legendary.

1036
01:09:57,161 --> 01:09:57,301
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1037
01:09:57,861 --> 01:10:00,202
[SPEAKER_01]: So, who the hell is Legendary?

1038
01:10:00,602 --> 01:10:01,803
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've never heard of them.

1039
01:10:02,483 --> 01:10:04,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really, I follow games, not movies.

1040
01:10:05,824 --> 01:10:07,445
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I should really be following movies.

1041
01:10:07,505 --> 01:10:09,526
[SPEAKER_01]: After all, I do work at a goddamn movie distributor.

1042
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:09,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.

1043
01:10:10,638 --> 01:10:13,119
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

1044
01:10:13,139 --> 01:10:14,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it doesn't suck.

1045
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:20,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I guess it's going to be Warner is working with them.

1046
01:10:20,904 --> 01:10:21,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Warner I've heard of.

1047
01:10:22,965 --> 01:10:23,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.

1048
01:10:24,546 --> 01:10:26,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think I have heard of Legendary, come to think of it.

1049
01:10:26,907 --> 01:10:30,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've seen that little animation at the beginning.

1050
01:10:30,389 --> 01:10:31,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they've done good stuff.

1051
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:34,311
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about movies, you think DreamWorks.

1052
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:36,412
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't think of the small company that put it out.

1053
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:36,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know...

1054
01:10:39,082 --> 01:10:41,883
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not like big movie studios haven't put out stinkers before.

1055
01:10:43,283 --> 01:10:43,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1056
01:10:45,663 --> 01:10:49,824
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't quite a movie, but DarkSakura, an interesting idea nonetheless.

1057
01:10:50,424 --> 01:10:59,145
[SPEAKER_00]: They're planning on doing an Animal Crossing, as it is in Japan, Dobutsu no Mori animated movie in Japan in December.

1058
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:00,866
[SPEAKER_00]: To be out in December.

1059
01:11:01,286 --> 01:11:02,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1060
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:04,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing it's not live action.

1061
01:11:04,967 --> 01:11:05,887
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said animated.

1062
01:11:05,987 --> 01:11:06,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1063
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:07,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Missed that part.

1064
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:15,900
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real information about if it's actually going to have a plot, because really the game has no plot.

1065
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,821
[SPEAKER_00]: You paid off your house drama.

1066
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:24,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would hope a movie would have a plot, but is the plot going to be you run around the village and run errands and deliver mail?

1067
01:11:24,563 --> 01:11:25,303
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be something.

1068
01:11:25,363 --> 01:11:31,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be, oh, tragedy has hit your forest, and blah, blah, band together, save, blah, blah, blah.

1069
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:34,246
[SPEAKER_02]: The man is trying to bulldoze Animal Forest, you know?

1070
01:11:35,306 --> 01:11:37,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Animal Forest, right, is the translation in Japan, right?

1071
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:38,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1072
01:11:39,411 --> 01:11:47,073
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the Japanese DS one was called Aedeo Doubutsu no Mori, I think it was.

1073
01:11:47,093 --> 01:11:48,374
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to think.

1074
01:11:50,174 --> 01:12:00,457
[SPEAKER_00]: But at any rate, the director for the movie will be Shimura Joji, who worked on Master Keaton and Shin Angyou Onshi.

1075
01:12:00,897 --> 01:12:03,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm all tongue-tied today because I'm all bleh.

1076
01:12:04,078 --> 01:12:07,459
[SPEAKER_00]: But Nintendo's talked before, though, that they want to get in the animation business.

1077
01:12:09,251 --> 01:12:28,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Animal Crossing is going to be a really good way for them to bring that goal together because it was actually stated by the former president of Nintendo, Yamauchi Hiroshi, stating that they were trying to put funds together to create an animated film project.

1078
01:12:28,352 --> 01:12:29,914
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's this in particular.

1079
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:32,868
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

1080
01:12:33,188 --> 01:12:36,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Spirit Snare in our chat room says, what did he say?

1081
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:39,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing live action would be a WTF.

1082
01:12:39,513 --> 01:12:41,055
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be more like furry crossing.

1083
01:12:42,156 --> 01:12:42,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

1084
01:12:43,637 --> 01:12:44,398
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a claymation.

1085
01:12:44,963 --> 01:12:49,325
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and here you go, Loki, and this would explain where I've seen the legendary pictures before.

1086
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:56,728
[SPEAKER_02]: GK128 posted a little linky in our chat room to the profile on Internet Movie Database, and here you go.

1087
01:12:56,948 --> 01:12:59,910
[SPEAKER_02]: They did Batman Begins and Superman Returns.

1088
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:01,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well... You want to take back what you said before?

1089
01:13:02,131 --> 01:13:02,931
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little bit better.

1090
01:13:02,971 --> 01:13:03,792
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, there you go.

1091
01:13:04,392 --> 01:13:07,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were in the midst of writing an angry email to Loki, we got it cleared up.

1092
01:13:08,454 --> 01:13:10,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, legendary pictures, okay by us now.

1093
01:13:10,395 --> 01:13:11,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they get to make a thumbs up.

1094
01:13:11,795 --> 01:13:12,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki's bad.

1095
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:13,236
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1096
01:13:14,178 --> 01:13:16,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, see, you think Warner though.

1097
01:13:16,181 --> 01:13:19,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Warner and DC, you don't think legendary when you hear of those films.

1098
01:13:19,746 --> 01:13:20,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1099
01:13:20,907 --> 01:13:21,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1100
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:23,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to defend yourself best you can.

1101
01:13:24,051 --> 01:13:24,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1102
01:13:25,723 --> 01:13:26,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Just giving you a hard time.

1103
01:13:27,864 --> 01:13:28,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1104
01:13:28,344 --> 01:13:34,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this isn't about a game turning into a TV show, but it's about games showing up on a TV show, yes?

1105
01:13:34,345 --> 01:13:34,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1106
01:13:35,206 --> 01:13:37,266
[SPEAKER_02]: A show that I am not watching this year.

1107
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:38,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Me neither.

1108
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:40,467
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it a little tough.

1109
01:13:40,887 --> 01:13:54,911
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently on The Apprentice last week, they did a kind of a competition to design the best Xbox 360 display in Walmart.

1110
01:13:55,627 --> 01:13:57,948
[SPEAKER_01]: and from what I hear, both of them sucked really, really bad.

1111
01:13:58,948 --> 01:14:08,231
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I read on the internet, one team didn't finish in time and they were missing something that held their tent up so it was like falling over and they won anyway because the other one was so freaking bad.

1112
01:14:08,631 --> 01:14:14,113
[SPEAKER_02]: But the review team apparently recognized what they were trying to go for and liked it better.

1113
01:14:14,973 --> 01:14:20,955
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I want to point out though, some folks were saying, oh, this is why Jay Allard wasn't at E3 because he showed up in this week's Apprentice.

1114
01:14:21,715 --> 01:14:23,955
[SPEAKER_02]: These Apprentice things are taped long in advance.

1115
01:14:24,216 --> 01:14:24,976
[SPEAKER_02]: About a month ago.

1116
01:14:25,356 --> 01:14:26,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually longer than that.

1117
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:28,697
[SPEAKER_02]: This season of The Apprentice was taped in November.

1118
01:14:29,037 --> 01:14:32,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So these boosts that they were designing were for the launch, most likely.

1119
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:36,399
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has nothing to do with why he was or wasn't at E3.

1120
01:14:36,419 --> 01:14:38,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to point that out because some folks are forgetting that.

1121
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:42,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Survivor, all that crap is taped long in advance.

1122
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1123
01:14:45,263 --> 01:14:54,510
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, apparently, you know, whatever the case may be, the winner, I guess, their displays were displayed in 1,500 Walmart stores.

1124
01:14:54,970 --> 01:15:00,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I haven't seen a 360 display in, you know, Walmarts.

1125
01:15:00,994 --> 01:15:02,555
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

1126
01:15:03,276 --> 01:15:04,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they that bad?

1127
01:15:04,116 --> 01:15:04,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently so.

1128
01:15:06,809 --> 01:15:11,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, one more story for this part of the show, and then we're going to go to a little break.

1129
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:14,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has to do with the Booth Boys of E3.

1130
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:23,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you hear a lot about Booth Babes, but with Booth Babes essentially getting, you know, forcing to tone down a little bit this year, and now we have news on Booth Boys.

1131
01:15:23,934 --> 01:15:27,555
[SPEAKER_02]: And this comes from a blog called Wonderland is the name of the blog.

1132
01:15:28,215 --> 01:15:34,277
[SPEAKER_02]: The author here wrote down their list of the top boys of E3, and in the list here they have

1133
01:15:34,937 --> 01:15:37,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter in the Namco booth, who has a little pack head there.

1134
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:42,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian from Brothers in Arms there, ready for action, a little military guy there.

1135
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:44,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see who else is in here.

1136
01:15:44,703 --> 01:15:46,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Another, just a couple of Webzen folks there.

1137
01:15:47,204 --> 01:15:49,846
[SPEAKER_02]: The Poker Dealer over there.

1138
01:15:50,907 --> 01:15:53,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Martin Lung, the video game pianist.

1139
01:15:53,928 --> 01:15:54,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got a video of him.

1140
01:15:55,269 --> 01:15:56,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he was a very talented guy.

1141
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:57,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to meet him.

1142
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:59,592
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually blindfolded himself with someone's t-shirt.

1143
01:16:01,877 --> 01:16:09,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Fatality, who had his own booth this year, and taking the show though, the number one booth guy according to this blog, Adam West.

1144
01:16:12,028 --> 01:16:20,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what I thought was interesting is that there was another website who ran a story on booth guys, and they distinctly showed a picture of the guy at Nokia's booth.

1145
01:16:20,775 --> 01:16:27,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I guess amongst all those girls in the white t-shirts and stuff, there was actually a guy who was a pretty good-looking guy that was there at the booth.

1146
01:16:27,942 --> 01:16:28,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember we saw him.

1147
01:16:29,603 --> 01:16:30,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember seeing him.

1148
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:31,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Or someone mentioned him.

1149
01:16:32,245 --> 01:16:34,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Miklatov mentioned him.

1150
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:36,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably, probably.

1151
01:16:37,153 --> 01:16:39,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave it to him to point out something like that, definitely.

1152
01:16:39,514 --> 01:16:42,036
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I totally missed it.

1153
01:16:42,756 --> 01:16:49,840
[SPEAKER_02]: My thought was when I first saw it, maybe he was there to... He just worked for the company and just happened to be pretty good looking.

1154
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,221
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe he was in there amongst all the women.

01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:52,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1156
01:16:52,561 --> 01:17:00,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't spend time in Engage's booth except to walk through it to get around the masses of people watching the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer at Konami.

1157
01:17:00,465 --> 01:17:00,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:17:01,286 --> 01:17:05,588

1159
01:17:05,948 --> 01:17:12,311
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they have those Namco hats at the Namco store?

1160
01:17:12,391 --> 01:17:13,131
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pac-Man hats.

1161
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:14,472

1169
01:17:21,075 --> 01:17:23,596
