00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,360
Hello everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio. It is May 7th, 2006. This is

4
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,200
episode number 183

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,240
of our live radio program and podcast dedicated to games

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,080
that don't suck but sometimes we gotta talk about games that do suck

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,960
just because we want to taunt them and laugh at them and take them outside and

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,600
beat them

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,360
my name is Rob Roberts for you not might know me as Sky joining me as always are

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,580
my

11
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,720
awesome co-hosts and that corner the happiest bunny on the farm

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,880
Dark Sakura Jamie Summers what what what what what what what what

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,680
what how are you? Well you said bunny and I was thinking of the Cadbury bunny

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,800
that's what I thought too. Do you know how fattening those things are? They're so good

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,640
they're so good they're so bad for you

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,720
I try to tell myself that things that are very tasty like that are really you know

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,600
they taste like poo

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,820
Because you knew chocolate is the color of poo

19
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,720
So I tried to keep that in my head whenever I look at chocolate like I want to eat some but green tea frappuccino

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,800
Doesn't look like anything. It just looks like yummy

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,460
So I had one add to one of them though had fat-free milk in it because I got it at Whole Foods

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,360
You know

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,780
I do and was like I bet if I went through the last 20 episodes of orange lounge radio 10 of them would start off with

24
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,780
You talking about food or coffee?

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,360
Because I did not bring a latte in with me today I

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,000
I am hyped up on freakin' sugar like you would not believe

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,680
and very pissed off at people. Really? Can we say the angst for a little bit?

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,720
I was gonna not talk about that right now.

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,280
I was not gonna talk about that. We got a whole segment for the angst. We'll get to that.

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,080
Sure. But I did get presents. Say hello as well to

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,480
Loki. Hello. Our tech master. How you doing?

39
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,960
of how is your gaming week?

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,400
What kind of stuff have you been playing?

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Dark Sakura, start us off.

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:40,000
Dark Sakura I've been doing more Kingdom Hearts fan art lately.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,620
We also picked up, um, what did we get?

44
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,360
We got some game or the other that Dan was playing, oh yeah, we got a pinball machine.

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
What?

46
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,120
We bought a Judge Dredd pinball machine.

47
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
Oh, why didn't you buy a good machine?

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,920
That is a good machine, oh my god, it's really awesome.

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,800
And then we're getting this other one called I think Frenzy or something.

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,920
It's supposed to be a really expensive pin table, um, we're getting one that's kind of

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,320
in crap repair for like, you know, a few hundred, but we're gonna fix it up and resell it for

52
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
like 5,000.

53
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,020
Call me when you get pin-bought.

54
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,580
I want a freakin' pinbot, but no, the machine I really want, really, really...

55
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,580
Bride of Pinbot.

56
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,540
Bride of Pinbot was awesome, but I want Black Knight 2000.

57
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,120
That was a good table.

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Very good table.

59
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
What's with the sudden pinball?

60
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,340
Dan has always been all over the pinballs.

61
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,340
Actually, before I got into DDR, when I would go to the arcade, I was mostly a pinball addict.

62
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,140
I remember you stuck on Theater of Magic for a long time.

63
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,900
I loved Theater of Magic.

64
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,660
Theater of Magic, Addams Family, Elvira, and I can't remember the name of it, the holographic

65
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,660
one with the space aliens.

66
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:45,740
When I first moved out here, we used to go eat at this Godfather's Pizza because I worked

67
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,380
at GNC and it was right there, so we'd drop off my deposit and go get dinner at Godfather's

68
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,380
and they had a last action hero pinball machine in there and we played the hell out of it.

69
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,340
In fact, the reason we stopped eating at that Godfather's Pizza was because they got rid

70
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,660
of the damn pinball table.

71
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,340
They also had Snow Brothers there too.

72
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,840
That's a great arcade game.

73
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,920
It's like Bubble Bobble, but it's not.

74
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
You know what I mean?

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
It's different.

76
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
It's just got snow.

77
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
I love that.

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
I played that on the Ultra-Cade.

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, the rest of my gaming week had to actually do with me downloading gaming stuff.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,480
I played a crap load of Ragnarok.

81
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:26,960
I am now level 64, uh, 40, 48, 64, hey, Addict, Mr. Addict, Final Fantasy.

82
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Ask me how much Final Fantasy I played this week.

83
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
How much did you play?

84
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Zip.

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Thank you.

86
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
You're just in detox.

87
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
Zip.

88
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,380
You're gonna get back on the habit, like you did before.

89
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,380
After E3, you bet.

90
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,380
That's right where I'm going, right after E3 is over.

91
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,380
Yeah, but I can bring Ragnarok with me.

92
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:48,380
Anyway, I downloaded all of the UFO endings and dog endings for the Silent Hill games.

93
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,380
Just because I wanted to torture myself.

94
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,380
Is that YouTube?

95
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,380
On YouTube.

96
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,380
YouTube is like the greatest thing to hit the internet in the past ten years.

97
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,380
It's crack.

98
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,380
It's like freaking heroin.

99
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,380
It's beautiful.

100
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,380
But I watched the alien endings and honestly the one in Silent Hill 3 was the funniest.

101
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,180
because it's all the,

102
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,100
let's sing the Silent Hill song.

103
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,980
Singing the whole thing, it was great.

104
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,020
And I liked the dog ending.

105
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,420
That was the one thing that disappointed me

106
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,820
about the Silent Hill movie,

107
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,420
is I wanted after the credits there

108
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,260
to be a dog ending or a UFO ending.

109
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,180
I think the DVD is going to have a UFO ending.

110
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,020
Sweet.

111
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,860
It better not be the craptastic same ones

112
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,780
like they had in the games,

113
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,400
because the only good one was like the Heather one.

114
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,320
You know on the internet movie database,

115
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,320
They said that the original cut of the Silent Hill movie was three and a half hours long.

116
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,360
Now take everything you read on Internet Movie Database with a grain of salt, but still be

117
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,640
kind of neat if the DVD is action packed.

118
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,480
I think a lot of people now are filming extra stuff, even though they know it's not going

119
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,640
to be in their things they think are neat, because it's going to be on the DVD.

120
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,120
They're going to have like an uber director's edition, unrated, hoopla, we're going to save

121
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,260
the world type DVD release like all the 20 million Lord of the Rings DVDs that

122
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,360
there are out and all the and you know you know Kevin Smith does it he does it

123
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,160
on purpose I think that's hilarious so I think that the DVD of Silent Hill is

124
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,360
gonna be like like the diggity just if you want to hear hilarity and then we'll

125
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,840
get back into games I think it's mall rats it's either mall rats are chasing

126
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,720
Amy one of those when you start listening to the director's commentary

127
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,860
they go fuck DVD because they were originally recording it for the laser

128
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,540
your disc edition. I don't remember if it was Mallrats or Chasing Amy, one of the two.

129
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,420
Arsef has a comment for you. Okay, what? Not just a grain, the whole damn shaker.

130
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,340
Hee hee.

131
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,420
Is that it?

132
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,980
I actually though, that same night, I went and I had like

133
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,580
a dream that I was stuck in Silent Hill with a dog. It was the craziest, weirdest,

134
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,580
most freaking out,

135
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,500
it was an actual nightmare, I'm not kidding, but I had a dog there the whole time, that same stupid

136
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,580
little dog wearing headphones.

137
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,180
You are so weird, it's true. I think it was because I also was eating spaghetti

138
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,940
Sure blame your problems on spaghetti

139
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,700
Well, okay you ever notice that if you eat something before you go to bed and you've like watch something

140
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,700
You almost always end up having a weird dream

141
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,600
Or does it just happen to me? Uh, I don't remember my dreams like ever

142
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,700
Once once every three months. I'll remember a dream. That's about it. It's like the whole past couple weeks

143
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,240
I've been just having a like uber vivid dreams, and I dreamt about Silent Hill with a dog with headphones freaky

144
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,820
It was very freaky. Oh, we gotta get back into games. I'm talking about games. I know

145
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:44,220
We gotta keep it moving. I'm sorry anything else any other games um I have um Kingdom Hearts chain of memories now

146
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,540
I heard that's missable um it's not open yet. I'm taking it to e3 all right. Have fun

147
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
Loki how was your gaming week?

148
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,120
almost non-existent, but uh... Oh yeah, it's true!

149
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,840
And Loki got married, in case you weren't listening last week, so

150
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,980
congratulations, Loki, on your marriage.

151
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,380
I played Mutant Storm Reloaded on Xbox Live's arcade,

152
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:12,700
and that was pretty fun, and I played more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories,

153
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,460
because I can, and

154
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,780
the new firmware update did help some of the problems,

155
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,860
But they're still there

156
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,500
It's just when you start playing more of the multiplayer stuff and actually starting to play the other

157
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,620
Modes there and they're like team playing stuff you start noticing how rushed

158
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,420
The multiplayer was in the game and how it really sucks, and it's really unfinished

159
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,460
But still fun. I love it

160
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,300
Then I've been playing a little bit loco roco

161
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,340
Which is also that demo that you can download for the PSP firmware 2.7

162
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,420
I mentioned that last week and it's actually kind of cool. It's a different game. I

163
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,940
Don't know it kind of seems in the same

164
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,300
Like pot as you know

165
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,780
Katamari just you know kind of a little quirky game reminds me like if Katamari and Yoshi's Island had a baby

166
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,780
This would be you know

167
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,140
Its result a big a big cute

168
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,900
cutesy

169
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,280
something's wrong with it baby something like that yeah

170
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,920
so it it's different I'll give them that

171
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,040
that's that's pretty much it I think

172
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,460
alright I'm my gaming week actually I didn't play anything new

173
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,480
because my work trip that really cut into my week they wanted 10 bucks a

174
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,840
night for internet access in my hotel I was like

175
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,340
if you that's what I don't like about swanky hotels I like that my work puts me

176
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,920
up in swanky hotels when I

177
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,800
you know go travel but then they want more money for internet access and my

178
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,580
works not going to pay for so I didn't get to really play any games like I couldn't

179
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,160
you know play World of Warcraft or even though I cancelled my account anyway but if I got

180
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,900
bored enough I would have reactivated it or any flash games or anything so I did have

181
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,700
my DS so I've been doing my brain training mostly every day I've unlocked I think I've

182
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,660
got my 17th stamp as of today so I've unlocked the triangle math was the last thing I got

183
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,380
the hard mode no wait there was I think there was another game after that I only have one

184
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,220
more game left unlocked so brain training is going good also Tetris DS

185
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:15,900
Xtaphir, my roommate, has been borrowing my Tetris DS and he actually unlocked

186
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,060
level 20 he beat the whole game and so playing Tetris on level 20 is insane

187
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,660
because the blocks don't even fall they just drop like imagine just having the

188
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,620
blocks drop every time that's what it does on level 20 but level 20 is inspired

189
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,260
by classic NES Tetris which is pretty cool because you know how like Tetris

190
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,300
is all inspired by different NES games of the past. Well, level 20 is NES Tetris, so

191
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,460
I thought that was pretty rad. It has a remix of the theme. Played a six-player multiplayer

192
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:50,880
Tetris DS last night. Craziness. Absolute craziness. But fun. Good times. Otherwise,

193
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,940
there hasn't been a lot new. I'm sorry to say, no Final Fantasy XI this week. I've just

194
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,580
been on a little vacation because, you know, just prepping for E3 and all that stuff and

195
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,280
work trip got in the way as well so haven't had a lot of gaming time but I've been reading

196
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,760
a lot of gaming news sites trying to keep up on what's going on for E3 and of course

197
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,120
we have a whole lot of news to get into tonight but first we have a very special announcement

198
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,260
I'll let Loki plug this.

199
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,640
This is something we've been teasing for a few weeks but it is now official we're announcing

200
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
it tonight.

201
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Loki tell us about it.

202
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Yes, of course, we've been working on new site for weeks now.

203
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,280
New site is going to be, I think it is the only PSP site out there that's covering

204
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:41,280
E3, or PSP formatted site covering E3, but it's E3 on PSP.com, very similar to O-L-R

205
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,640
on PS, or O-L-R, ah.

206
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
O-L-R PSP?

207
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,680
Yes, O-L-R PSP.com, except you're going to have a lot more content on here.

208
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,640
There's definitely, basically the whole purpose of it is we're trying to put E3 in the palm

209
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
of your hands.

210
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,600
I mean literally we're going to do video walkthroughs of like booths and stuff.

211
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,320
You'll feel like you're on the show floor watching, you know, all the stuff we're walking

212
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
around.

213
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,800
And so we get a lot of exclusive content.

214
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,200
I'm going to the Nintendo party on Tuesdays.

215
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,360
So hopefully you get some stuff like, you know, you'll actually get to see what the

216
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,720
Nintendo party looks like.

217
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,360
I mean, because a lot of people don't get to go to the E3, let alone go to parties and

218
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
stuff like that.

219
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,820
So, definitely lots of content on there, we've got some stuff on there already, just to give

220
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,540
you an idea of what we're going to have and it's going to be amazing.

221
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,540
Lots and lots of stuff.

222
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,700
We're going to work our butts off on this site this whole week for you guys, it's E3

223
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,580
on PSP.com and it's actually not just going to be us, we're going to get some outside

224
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,040
help on this as well, of course you've probably noticed we've been working an awful lot with

225
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,720
our buddies at AllGames.com lately and it's my understanding they're going to be helping

226
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,080
with this venture as well.

227
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,300
I don't know to what extent just yet.

228
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,540
I think Bobby said he'd do some on-camera stuff for us, so I'm going to hold him to

229
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,540
that.

230
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,380
So you're going to have videos with myself, Loki, if we can give Dark Sakura enough sugar,

231
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
maybe we'll get her in one of the videos.

232
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,180
Maybe if I can find a Dr. Doom mask.

233
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,260
I'm sure we'll have Bobby and then hopefully maybe Scott and Lawrence as well, so all on

234
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,500
the E3 on PSP site, giving you walk-throughs of Boost, just talking about games.

235
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,140
And of course, our big thing is interactiveness.

236
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:22,320
So if you guys want to send us an email and say, hey guys, check this out, I want to see

237
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
this.

238
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,920
We did this last year at E3.

239
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,240
We pulled the shows from our archives, but if you talk to some of our listeners who have

240
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,920
been around a while, you can probably find copies of these shows.

241
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,280
We actually opened it up during these shows, like on Wednesday, we said, okay, send us

242
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,800
your questions, we'll find out the answers on Thursday.

243
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,800
We actually took all the questions and went out on the floor and figured out the answers

244
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,760
to them and brought them to you on Thursday's show.

245
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,580
We wanted to do the same thing with the site as well.

246
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,700
The other great thing about the site is that if you're an E3 attendee, we're going to put

247
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,840
maps of the show floor on there.

248
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,320
That's the one thing that's still missing, right?

249
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
But it's going to be...

250
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
No, it's up there.

251
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Oh, did you get it done?

252
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Yeah, it's up there.

253
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Hooray!

254
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,980
But it's not just going to be maps, just like everything.

255
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,360
It's good to have, if you have access to even some of the Wi-Fi there, you can actually

256
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,600
see, you know, okay, I'm waiting in this giant line, what exactly are they showing at the

257
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,760
Sony booth or, you know, just so you know how to budget your time and I definitely think,

258
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,080
I wish, you know, a lot of times like, for example, waiting in line, you know, to see

259
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,860
Twilight Princess, you know, what exactly do they have back there, I mean, you know,

260
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
see if you have three hours.

261
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:32,780
Alright, so just check that out, it's E3 on PSP.com, of course it is formatted for the

262
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:39,700
PSP, you can look at it in Firefox, Internet Explorer, but it's not going to be, it's not

263
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,900
going to look right, but if you're okay with that, go ahead, there's going to be a lot

264
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
of great videos you can look at.

265
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,580
And they're asking if Flash is on there yet, no, I didn't support Flash on this because

266
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,900
not everyone is upgrading their firmware to 2.7, and I didn't want to force people to

267
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,500
do that, and didn't want to exclude people from certain things, so no Flash on there,

268
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,460
but it'll still be pretty quick, and I don't know, the Flash on the PSP is not that great

269
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,660
I just want to play with it, see what I can do with it.

270
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,580
Yeah, we'll table the Flash thing for a later OLR PSP upgrade. That'll be cool.

271
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,460
Well, yeah, later on when we're done with the PSP site,

272
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,620
E3 and PSP, you'll see some

273
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,060
definite improvements. I have ideas.

274
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,220
So, lots and lots and lots of content

275
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,300
and it should be good. Alright, let's go into some

276
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:34,180
other news while you're all checking out E3 on PSP.com, we'll talk about Nintendo.

277
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,040
This is a little bit of a follow-up to last week's mini episode, and by the way, if you

278
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,060
haven't figured it out, there's a little joke at the end of last week's episode.

279
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,880
If you turned off the show before Dark Soccer and I came back and talked about the Wii,

280
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,380
you missed the last 10 minutes of the show.

281
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,380
And we laugh at you.

282
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,460
Yeah, we played a little gag.

283
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,300
I think most people probably figured it out because they probably saw the MP3 wasn't finished

284
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,740
yet, but just in case you missed it, yes, Dark Soccer and I did talk about the Wii last

285
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,480
week when Loki wasn't here.

286
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,460
One of the things we talked about was the conspiracy theories going on on the internet

287
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,220
that, oh, the Wii's not trademarked, so it can't be true.

288
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:16,440
It's all a viral gag campaign, they're pulling your leg, Nintendo's gonna come out and announce

289
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:24,020
the real name, well, guess what, this week the Wii trademark did show up on the website,

290
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:30,140
And it's there if you want to check the database for yourself, have fun, WII, Nintendo has

291
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,540
trademarked it.

292
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,640
It's actually right up there on their site as a tab.

293
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,300
Now I'm sure that you guys will have crazy conspiracy theories that say, well it's still

294
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,580
fake or whatever, no it's going to be the name of the console, just deal with it.

295
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,760
I think most people are kind of backing off on the name now and waiting to see what the

296
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,700
games are like, which is what we were saying all along last week.

297
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,140
I think the name does exactly what any type of name should do.

298
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,600
Like I said last week, the whole purpose of things you should do when advertising anything

299
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,140
is to have something simple, something that people are going to remember, and something

300
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,380
that people are going to talk about.

301
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,400
I think that they've accomplished that pretty well.

302
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
It'll be fine.

303
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
I mean, we'll see.

304
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,380
The real test will be in a few days when we start seeing the games at E3.

305
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,460
And Loki has a news article on some of the games we're going to be seeing on the Wii.

306
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,060
I don't know if we'll see this at E3, but later on.

307
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,060
Maybe.

308
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,400
Spider-Man 3, they're going to have a special version for it, which is not surprising.

309
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,740
Most of the games I think that are going to be ported to it are going to be having unique

310
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,860
versions of it.

311
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,180
But got to report it, Spider-Man 3, unique version for the Wii, so that'll be pretty

312
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,180
interesting.

313
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,240
Actually, I think that ties in with something we talked about a while ago, where they're

314
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,420
saying that they're going to have some web slinging you can do with the controller or

315
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
something.

316
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Probably the same thing.

317
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,820
all this control stuff sound too good to be true I mean it's just I I can't help

318
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,100
it at this stage I get flashbacks to the power glove yeah you know and I kind of

319
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,340
go you know the power glove was a neat concept but it wasn't really that

320
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,180
grabbing granted technology's progressed what 15 years since then but you know I

321
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,060
can't help but wonder is this is it gonna be accurate is it really gonna be

322
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:18,100
as you know in the game as everyone says it is but better than my toy I can't yeah

323
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,580
I know and the eye toy is still kind of gimmicky to me too. So I I I

324
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:30,400
Don't know the skeptical side of me is coming in but I I'm holding off until e3. I will wait and

325
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,780
Figure it out at e3 because maybe they can pull it off

326
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:39,660
I mean again technologies come 15 years since all that you force and all that stuff. So yeah, hopefully it's better

327
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,140
The other game you're gonna see at e3 would be Midway's

328
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,620
Blitz the league

329
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,980
of course

330
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,340
Whatever they're gonna be calling it this time, but actually it looks pretty cool

331
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,420
Especially if they're gonna be doing similar stuff to what Madden it's gonna be doing should be a pretty

332
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,300
Pretty good game. So looking forward to that

333
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,780
and then

334
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:06,220
God knows what other stuff they're gonna have, you know coming out but um, let's leak will be pretty cool. I

335
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:14,540
Think that the whole like throwing the football with the that just oh I could just I can just see remotes going through TVs

336
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:21,220
You know they have VAs doing their, they're having a passing and kicking demo as well

337
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,540
as a one game demo for Madden 2007.

338
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,500
So we'll see how it's going to work.

339
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,900
I'm just waiting for like a game where like Super Smash Bros. or something like that where

340
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,740
you start beating someone with a remote.

341
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,180
That would be fun.

342
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:43,340
Going over to our chat room for some comments www.orangeloungeradio.com click on chat.

343
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,220
a lot of our folks are talking about Para Para Paradise with the

344
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,780
uh... you know it's like DDR but with your hands. You'd have to have two controllers.

345
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,740
Yeah, you'd have to have two controllers. But a lot of the games, they're making support two controllers.

346
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,620
That's the whole thing. And it's not really DDR with your hands, but that's honestly the best way

347
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,540
I can describe it. It actually goes through this whole like... It's like line dancing and

348
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,620
cheerleading meets DDR. Yeah, that's a... I just can't wait. If you ever wanted to be a

349
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,080
Hooters girl, this is uh... the training game for you. I can't wait for some of these games to get really

350
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,580
creative with their control schemes and like come out with like

351
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,040
straps to strap controllers to your legs and arms and

352
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:24,500
god crazy shit. Activator. And then Bandit says the wizard 2 we unite

353
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,980
because remember the Power Glove was in the first wizard and now it can be the Wii

354
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,500
it's so bad. Yeah I don't know

355
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,040
I know the Power Glove suck that's all I remember. Alright.

356
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,260
It's so bad. Dark Sakura. What? A series that you talk about a lot is coming to the

357
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,980
Wii right?

358
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,180
In fact, you're probably the only person I know that still plays these games.

359
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,220
Hey, Dan does too, and a lot of our friends.

360
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,980
That's why you two live happily ever after.

361
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,140
It's because we're old school, like that, yo.

362
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,620
Anyway, Metal Slug is coming out on the Wii.

363
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,220
I told you I was going to call it Wii from now on.

364
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,420
Let's take bets on how long before that gets annoying, and if you had right now, you just

365
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
won.

366
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
You know what?

367
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,420
Shut up.

368
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:14,380
But no, Metal Slug Anthology is going to be out on the Wii, and it will be the 20 millionth

369
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,260
release of Metal Slug, whatever.

370
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,740
I love Metal Slug, and this is saying it's going to be the complete Metal Slug Arcade

371
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:27,820
Edition with a bunch of bonus stuff, and that you use the Wii controller in a quote new

372
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:34,860
and unique way, but it was actually announced by Ben Herman, who is the president of SNK.

373
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,840
give any details. Also, that's supposed to, I think, go hand in hand with the release

374
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,140
of SNK vs Capcom Kart Fighters.

375
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,940
You'll use the Wii controller to, you know, throw up your money that's going to be thrown

376
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,300
into the fire because you're throwing away your money to buy this stupid game.

377
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:58,820
Like, if you're put in Mummy Mode, do you, like, wave your Wii and puke or something?

378
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:04,020
Will you be able to use your Wii to actually make the graphics look next-gen?

379
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,160
You know what, if SNK really wanted to make us happy, they would freakin' put out another

380
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,300
Metal Slug, on the Neo Geo!

381
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,740
For those of us that have our Neo Geos collecting dust.

382
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,260
Just stop making Metal Slug games.

383
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Hey, there's not three of us, there's at least five.

384
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,860
You can do an SNK classic collection or something like that and be done with it.

385
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,220
Stop re-releasing Metal Slug, no one buys them.

386
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,220
Hey, I do!

387
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,220
Haha.

388
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,140
Yeah, but did you buy every single re-release of it?

389
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,860
Yes.

390
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,200
and we have them on our maim.

391
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,700
Well, you know, what if, like, say that we have, like, the PlayStation hooked up one day?

392
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,180
Well, we have to have a system to play Metal Slug on.

393
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,540
Or what if the Neo Geo CD's hooked up? Well, we have to play Metal Slug on that.

394
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,540
It just depends on what's hooked up. We want to leave our options open.

395
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,720
So we have Metal Slug. Just repeat after me.

396
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,380
I am a consumer whore. And how? I'm glad somebody's supporting SNK, because they sure as hell

397
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,200
haven't made any new games recently. I love SNK. I love SNK almost as much as I

398
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,420
love Sega. Alright. Ooh, King of Fighters 94 again. That'd

399
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,160
be fun. You know what, I do have to say the King

400
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,160
of Fighters games though on Saturn are torturous because the load screens take a minute and

401
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,840
a half each. Alright. How about some big news? Big news

402
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,320
this week, not about the Wii. Wii!

403
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,920
Okay, what I'm going to do is after E3, I'm going to get a ceiling contraption installed

404
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,320
so that every time Dark Sakura goes weeee, a Wii controller will fall from the ceiling

405
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,000
and bonk her on the head.

406
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I like that idea.

407
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But hey, you know what?

408
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That gives me ammo.

409
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You know what I want to do?

410
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,600
I want to convert one of the ferrets into a rev mode.

411
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
That would be hilarious.

412
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
That's a great idea.

413
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
But where's the ferret?

414
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
I don't know, we burned it.

415
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Hey!

416
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,240
Moving on, getting into a story here.

417
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,160
This was huge news this week, Oblivion.

418
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,100
Was this the sequel to Hot Coffee, this whole debacle going on in Oblivion?

419
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,780
You guys have probably read about this, but if you've been living in a cave or you just

420
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:08,060
avoid Oblivion news for whatever reason, the ESRB changed the rating of the PC version

421
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:16,240
of Oblivion from T to M. The Xbox 360 version got re-rated later, or

422
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
it was clarified.

423
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,880
It was stupid why they did that.

424
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,620
If you let me finish, here's what happened.

425
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,500
Apparently, there were a texture for boobies on the disk.

426
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,620
However, the boobies were never meant to be accessed.

427
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,640
You were not allowed to have a topless character in Oblivion.

428
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,940
There is no up, up, down, down, left, right.

429
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,620
There is no code to get the boobies.

430
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,740
You have to do a third-party outside hack to put the boobies on.

431
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,460
Because of this third-party hack, it has been exposed that the boobs were on the disk the

432
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:55,380
whole time and therefore this game is not safe for children and it's slapped with an

433
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,380
M rating.

434
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,680
Here's my problem with this whole thing, that's just like saying if I took let's say Care

435
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:09,340
Bears the movie and I spliced in porn in there and put that ISO on the internet, would they

436
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,500
have to re-rate that movie X because I spliced in porn?

437
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,300
No because the porn wasn't on the disc to begin with, that I believe is the whole thing.

438
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:23,700
What about, then, in the case of The Rescuers, with the sliced-in nudie photo, which was

439
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,540
done at the animation studio and has been on every subsequent release, except for the

440
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:33,640
modern ones after these uptight anal-rotative, right-wing people decided to watch every frame

441
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,780
and pick out stuff in it?

442
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,060
Or The Lion King, where the stars spell out sex?

443
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,660
Or in Aladdin, where if you listen real carefully, it goes, take your clothes off.

444
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,060
Actually, that was deemed to be fake, and I found that out at Snopes.com, your website

445
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,060
of the week.

446
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
I love Snopes.

447
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,420
still I mean it looks like those stars do say sex I mean if you look at it

448
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,940
You know Ronald McDonald's hair, it says hot, yummy, good. Serious.

449
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,580
No that's a very good, you know what though, that's a very good point the

450
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,340
Rescuers wasn't made an R movie because you know I had that one frame of

451
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,060
boobies in it

452
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,760
but yet the games are you know damned

453
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,300
for this. Well the thing is this is how I see it

454
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,480
you know with the subsequent releases

455
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,780
of for example the Rescuers they've gone and removed those frames of animation

456
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,300
or replace them so that you don't have that in the newer versions.

457
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,100
However, can't they do that on later releases of games?

458
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,300
Just go through, delete code, and release it.

459
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,780
Here's my question. Why the hell did someone actually spend time to create

460
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,020
textures for boobies

461
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,580
on these characters anyway? Because probably there was a plan to have them in

462
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,540
the game at some point, but they decided, nope, not a good idea.

463
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,020
Bloody Roar 3 had,

464
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,100
if you use a cheat, a cheat whatever,

465
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,940
you can pull up pictures that the game programmers did in

466
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,640
of the characters in compromising positions, like

467
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,980
naked and doing stuff. Yeah, they really tried to sell that game despite the fact that this sucked.

468
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,820
You know, people are saying that this is nothing like hot coffee, but I say this is

469
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,140
exactly like hot coffee. You know why? Because that sex game

470
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,600
was never meant to be found either. It was on the disk, but

471
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,040
I'd say it's the exact same thing that's happening between the two games.

472
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,520
At some point, Oblivion, the creators, probably planned for there to be a topless character.

473
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Why not?

474
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,480
If the game is violent, why not throw in a little nudity as well?

475
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,280
However, at some point during the beta, or even the alpha testing, they decided, you

476
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
know what?

477
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Bad idea.

478
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,060
Let's just take the pointer out to the textures.

479
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,600
It's easier to take the pointer out than to redo everything on the disk.

480
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,720
I've always said that's the exact same thing that happened on Hot Coffee.

481
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,220
The way they do clothing nowadays, it's just an actual, like, object on top of an object.

482
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,880
So the textures are always there, it's just they're covered up by a clothing object.

483
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,240
So you just remove that clothing object, and there you go.

484
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
I'm so irritated.

485
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,760
They didn't get pissed off about it with The Sims.

486
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,920
There seems to be just this huge, I don't know, standard much?

487
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,660
Well, it's because they hate Take-Two, you know, because Ben Aharsa's, you know, distributed

488
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,180
by Take-Two and 2K, so, you know, let's go beat them up some more.

489
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,140
Alright, let's get into the rest of the follow-up here.

490
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,280
And you know what, because of all this crap, this is why we get really bad games, like

491
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,300
Take-Two presents, or Rockstar presents, Table Tennis.

492
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,660
I blame all of those sexually repressed anal-retentive people.

493
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,940
Alright, let's get into the follow-ups. Low-key.

494
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,940
Bethesda Respawns.

495
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,980
Yeah, so Respawn basically insists that a full and accurate, comprehensive report of

496
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:41,620
Oblivion's content was submitted to the ESRB before the game's release that included

497
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:47,120
a 60 page document that detailed the all explicit language acts and scenes in the game. It says

498
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,660
they did not list the nudity because there is no nudity in Oblivion without a third party

499
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:57,760
modification." And so basically they're just kind of, you know, this is ridiculous.

500
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,060
Essentially the same thing that Rockstar said, is that this was not supposed to be in the

501
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,060
Yeah.

502
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,060
Alright.

503
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,060
So, then what happened?

504
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:10,500
So, of course, politicians got to use this as their ammunition for their own bills.

505
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,820
Remember when I commented on sexually repressing lieutenant people?

506
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,380
Yes, exactly.

507
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:21,020
So, you know, of course this news comes out and so what do they do, you know, freaking

508
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:27,900
California Assemblyman Leland Yee issued a press release calling on Take-Two and the

509
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:37,100
the ESRB to stop deceiving parents and he said, and I quote, the ESRB again has failed

510
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,620
our parents and it's clearly shown that they cannot police themselves. Plain and simple,

511
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,980
the current rating system is drastically flawed and here is yet another reason why we need

512
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:54,460
legislation to assist parents and protect children. Wow, somebody didn't do their research

513
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,300
at all before coming out and sound like a complete jackass

514
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:04,100
so excellent by the way he was also one of the

515
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:09,140
politicians to pick up on the hot coffee scandal comments from chat room

516
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,620
let's see black wolf says

517
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,020
no it was actually the way they did their 3d models

518
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,820
the bra object was on top of the nudie object and you could not remove the bra

519
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,260
object without a mod

520
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,020
So I guess the boobs were just there to make it more realistic still I

521
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Okay, so whatever it was for a more complex reason still the boobies were not meant to be seen by themselves

522
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:38,420
Okay, so like what if you have a movie and you have someone walk around in their undies? Well, they could have that edited off

523
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,780
That's true digital editing. Oh, we could go back

524
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:47,460
You know that scene with Tom deleted scenes pull off the you know stuff that scene with Tom Cruise from risky business

525
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,620
We could just digitally edit in a schlong, and is that going to get the movie re-rated

526
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,620
in NC-17?

527
00:30:53,620 --> 00:31:00,860
What was that movie where if you freeze frame it at just the right point, you can see his

528
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,860
schlong?

529
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,280
That happens in movies all the time where you might see a titty or you might see a schlong

530
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,860
if you pause it at just the right moment.

531
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,060
There are several movies that are like that.

532
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:17,060
Austin Powers, there's a scene where, what's her name, Elizabeth Hurley, where he moves

533
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,880
like the piece of fruit at just the wrong time and you can see the red tape over her.

534
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,740
That actually was pointed out to me, by the way.

535
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,020
R. Seth in the chat room says, Leland Yee is a respectable man, I suppose.

536
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,180
He just needs to learn what the hell he's talking about before he blasts video games,

537
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,180
it seems.

538
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:38,100
I agree 100% with that statement applied to about 99% of politicians out there right now.

539
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,340
Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter.

540
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,420
They all need to do their research on this subject.

541
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:46,340
Exactly. I don't mind them coming after if like an actual company out there, like say

542
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:55,400
for example, we were to find out tomorrow that EA with Sims 2 purposefully left in nudity

543
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:01,240
and say there's child sex in the game or something like that, then yes, then they need

544
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,340
to come after them and say, okay, you need to re-rate this and you probably need to remove

545
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,740
this content. Whereas, if this wasn't meant to be in the game and someone added it in

546
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,500
with a third-party patch or hack, thatís a little different.

547
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,980
They need to do their research.

548
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,940
The gaming community is getting a little ticked off too, and specifically we have John Romero.

549
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,260
You know him as one of the co-founders of ID Software.

550
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:34,860
He went off on his blog about this whole re-rating fiasco, and he was saying, ìModders are not

551
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,020
screwing up the industry.

552
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:41,340
They are supposed to be helping.

553
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,580
He fears that developers are going to have to basically make their games tougher to hack

554
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,740
to avoid these rerating incidents in the future.

555
00:32:48,740 --> 00:33:05,940
They have been doing this crap for years though.

556
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:12,220
There was a Game Boy hack ROM for the Legend of Zelda game that was on that, where Link

557
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,780
looked like a little troll and was carrying around a giant penis.

558
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,260
What was one of the first games that everybody and their mom was hacking?

559
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
Doom?

560
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,180
There were even games that were released that were like that.

561
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:33,800
You know what pisses me off most about this, and maybe I'm getting a little political here

562
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,720
but I donít care, what is the big deal about a couple of boobs?

563
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,280
I mean seriously, Oblivion is a really violent game, actually thereís a lot, I donít even

564
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,600
have to pick on Oblivion, thereís a lot of very, very violent video games out there,

565
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,040
yet it takes a set of boobs to get your game rated M.

566
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
I have a theory.

567
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,120
I donít get this at all, I mean this is just my rant on society.

568
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,540
You know I may not be a father yet but someday I hope to and I know that one of the way I

569
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:10,640
I plan to raise my kid is that if I am screening the movies that my child, him or her is going

570
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,280
to see, I would much rather my child see something with sex or the F word in it.

571
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,120
Not that I am going to encourage it, but when I am screening movies, sex and F word is like

572
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,780
a little lower on the scale than violence.

573
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,940
I think violence is more of a reason to not let your kid see a movie.

574
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,940
I don't want my kid to see that.

575
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,180
Seriously, would you rather have your kids having sex or would you rather them killing

576
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,180
people?

577
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,180
Or how about learning about safe sex?

578
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:36,340
Well, keep in mind also, you know, from the average child perspective,

579
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:41,000
the thing that you cannot do becomes all the more attractive, you know?

580
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,840
And I think that they either, you know, with this type of environment,

581
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,840
with that much repression of what they see, they're either going to grow

582
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,940
up to be really fucked up in the head is what I think.

583
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,860
You know, not knowing the right way to do things, not knowing the reality, because there was,

584
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:04,020
As an example, one of my friends, her best friend growing up, was not allowed to watch

585
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,700
the news, was not allowed to watch violent movies, was not allowed to watch anything

586
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,400
that wasn't G-rated.

587
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,740
When she graduated high school, she had no idea how the world worked.

588
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,540
She didn't learn anything but from her friends because she grew up in such a sheltered environment.

589
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,580
She wasn't allowed to go out or anything.

590
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:37,040
My example on this is that she thought that oral sex was just talking about it.

591
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,940
I'm afraid that if things like this are allowed to happen, we're going to see more

592
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:46,420
kids growing up without having any type of concept of what the world is like or how to

593
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,700
interact or anything like that.

594
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,140
You ever notice this about violent movies, that in violent movies, a lot of times the

595
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,960
person causing the violence is the hero, like you look at The Terminator, an incredibly

596
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,980
violent movie, but you cheer on Arnold and you're like, yeah, kick some ass, blow those

597
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
guys up.

598
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,260
Yet in a movie that's about sex, like you take a movie like Unfaithful or something,

599
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:10,040
there are sad endings to those movies and you learn about the consequence of unsafe

600
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,340
sex and screwing around on monogamous relationships and things.

601
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:19,660
I'm not trying to say all movies make sex look bad, but usually, I've noticed in the

602
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,840
movies I've seen, irresponsible sex in movies leads to bad news, whereas gratuitous violence

603
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,600
in movies leads to good news.

604
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,300
What the hell type of message is that?

605
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:36,960
I'm really thinking that we've got this sort of vicious cycle going on because the more

606
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,260
the government steps in, and this has actually been something that's happened since the

607
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,620
the late 80s that we've seen the government stepping in, I'll bring this up as a point

608
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:51,860
and it also is more you know jackass involved in it, but the whole cop killer thing, remember

609
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,860
that?

610
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,460
Remember, he was also responsible for the whole Two Life crew business?

611
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,460
Remember that?

612
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,020
Well, keep in mind that since we've had this cycle of going through of having the government

613
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,820
step in and try to say, hey, we can't do that, this is bad, we've seen an increase in this

614
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,380
type of game or this type of movie.

615
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,160
We have seen people want more and more the more that other people say you can't have

616
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
it.

617
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:21,560
Again, it is like Sakarina said, the forbidden fruit syndrome, that is fully what it is.

618
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,400
This is something that stays with you.

619
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,080
The more you can't have something, the more you want it, the demand keeps growing.

620
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,400
This didn't make the show roll for tonight, but it just makes me think as well that I

621
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,480
heard about there was some sex game that got banned from E3 and I'm sorry, I don't have

622
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,040
the story in front of me, but E3 said that some game couldn't be exhibited on the floor

623
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,840
because it's mostly about sex and it just kind of made me go three fields no

624
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,740
it's not it wasn't that it was it was uh the lady that's very well known for her

625
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,800
sex in the games I'm sure somebody in chat rooms gonna yell it out momentarily

626
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,000
here but they were banned from the e3 floor and I'm thinking why why no one

627
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,160
under 18 allowed anyway exactly and if they don't freakin need to get him

628
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,400
kicked out I mean that's why I don't get about the whole booth babe naughty

629
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,320
America thank you naughty America see I knew they'd yell it out but I just think

630
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:22,080
We are a repressed society, there are way too many people in power who are not getting

631
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:27,520
the nookie or something, or if they're getting it, it's all dry and stale, I don't know.

632
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,440
We do have a worldwide audience though, so some folks are probably listening to us bitching

633
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
going, you know...

634
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
We should start our own country.

635
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,240
Maybe we just need more political parties in this country.

636
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:49,960
We have too many people who are not willing to move away from this bipartisan bullshit

637
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,720
that we've got.

638
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
This is how I feel about it.

639
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,480
I feel very strongly about this.

640
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,760
There are too many people who when they vote for a certain politician, let's say for the

641
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,320
presidential election, they vote straight ticket because they haven't taken the time

642
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,400
to research.

643
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,700
They do not realize that they are the ones who have fucked this up for themselves.

644
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,540
It is their fault.

645
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,780
The primary voters in this country, it is your fault.

646
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,780
Educate yourself.

647
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
I'm serious.

648
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,540
You can send those cards and letters to Mailbag at orangelumsreader.com.

649
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,920
I have made no secret of this.

650
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:27,060
I think that it's because the people of this country keep putting these types of people

651
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:34,700
in power that we see, I think that the majority of people enjoy being repressed and uninformed.

652
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:39,420
I think they like being ignorant because usually when you find out something, a friend of mine

653
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,700
has a quote that says, the truth will set you free but first it will piss you off.

654
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,380
Interesting comment from the chat room, Blaze says, Japan is much more open about sex and

655
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,060
their rape rate is like less than 1% of all people.

656
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,140
I don't know where that quote is from but it's an interesting comment.

657
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:59,060
They actually have a thing going on with a lot of wives while their husbands are on business

658
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,300
trips and this is actually a business arrangement.

659
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:06,900
They will basically sell their services.

660
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,200
It's very common for a man to have a mistress and have his wife because his mistress will

661
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,340
be the one to engage him socially, whereas the wife will be the one to take care of the

662
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,260
house and raise the kids and be the goddess of her domain.

663
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,980
How does this tie into boobies and oblivion again?

664
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,180
I think we got off subject.

665
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:31,480
of the whole thing that it is these close-minded, ignorant people who are going through and

666
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,740
wanting this type of thing taken out from mainstream availability.

667
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,540
I think we need more of it, honestly.

668
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:43,500
Maybe if more people are seeing the boobies, they won't go out raping people.

669
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Politics chat here on OLR.

670
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
No, it's okay.

671
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,420
It's necessary once in a while.

672
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,740
We have a large audience that's over 18 as well as under 18.

673
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:58,240
I didn't mean to go off, it's something that I feel very strongly about, I really

674
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,800
feel very strongly about it.

675
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,960
Let's get back into the discussion on violent games, Dark Sakura.

676
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,920
I like violence!

677
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,360
I don't like this game very much because first-person shooters make me nauseous, literally.

678
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,480
We have a lot of people who are into these types of games.

679
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,120
The next Call of Duty game is not going to be out on the PC.

680
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,920
Activision is basically stating, and I quote,

681
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,160
it's not a PC product, it's a console product,

682
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,260
and it's all next gen.

683
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,480
Doesn't mean that there's not going to be any more on the PC.

684
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,760
I mean, we did see other versions released

685
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,360
on PS2, Xbox, GameCube, Xbox 360.

686
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,960
But they are going to stick it so far strictly

687
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,040
to the next gen consoles.

688
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,880
There was also a question going about

689
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,960
if Infinity Ward's doing this year's console title

690
00:41:50,960 --> 00:42:00,720
themselves for Call of Duty and that has actually been seen to be left unanswered

691
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,200
so far. They also released the big red one last year.

692
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:12,320
All right. But no Call of Duty on your PC. Well there's a lot of PC gamers out

693
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,940
there who are very sad at that but I guess you know it looks like developers

694
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,040
a lot of them are focusing their attention on console games and you know

695
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,980
PC games just kind of a different market. There's a different type of game that's

696
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,020
successful there.

697
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,100
There's actually a really good first-person shooter making it out

698
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,720
onto the Xbox 360.

699
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,940
I heard about that.

700
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,160
I actually found that out from my husband today.

701
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,820
He's pretty excited about that. There's actually going to be a good first-person shooter.

702
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:46,960
Loki, we had a rumor last week. I know you weren't here. We had a rumor last week

703
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,860
about this, but we got confirmation. What is it?

704
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:54,560
Well, it's sort of confirmation. Basically, according to an EB Games employee, Nintendo

705
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:03,160
has sent posters including a blank GameCube branded new low price sticker. So basically

706
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,440
they're getting the P.O.P. now at these stores for a price change for the GameCube, which

707
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:14,960
I'm sure they're going to announce at their conference on Tuesday. So, the guess on the

708
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,680
the price right now is that they're going to drop at the $79.99 for the GameCube. So

709
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,400
we'll have to wait until a few more days here before we find out when that's going to happen.

710
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,080
I'm guessing, though, it's got to be at the press conference.

711
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,280
Which is Tuesday, right?

712
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:37,360
That is correct. I don't know. With all the wee excitement, I guess GameCube will just

713
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,120
be kind of a budget thing. It's like, let's get the kids one for their room. It's basically

714
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,120
what it's going to turn into.

715
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,120
That's what the 64 is.

716
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,260
You know, they still have Nintendo 64 at McDonald's, some of them.

717
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,260
They still advertise them.

718
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,600
Like when I was in LA, I drove by McDonald's and actually still was advertising the Nintendo

719
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,240
64 on one of their things.

720
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,540
I thought that was very interesting.

721
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,420
That is hilarious.

722
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,780
Which might explain why you don't see Los Angeles on this list.

723
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,780
I don't know.

724
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,220
It's the top video game cities in America.

725
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:10,640
It was a survey commissioned by Sperling for Best Places and Microsoft.

726
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,900
It rated Seattle, Washington as the top video game city in America.

727
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:33,980
However, the survey what they were doing is they were taken into account the number of

728
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:38,260
video game systems owned per household, the number of game purchased, the number of game

729
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:43,220
Reynolds and the frequency of online gameplay, whether it be Xbox Live or Windows games as

730
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,820
well as other factors.

731
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:50,620
The other top 10, number 10, Philadelphia, number 9, San Diego, number 8, Boston, number

732
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:56,940
7, St. Louis, number 6, Washington, D.C., number 5, Phoenix, Mesa, number 4, Detroit,

733
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:02,980
number 3, Hotlanta, number 2, Minneapolis, St. Paul, and number 1, of course, Seattle.

734
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,660
Our close by neighbor San Francisco is number 14, but here in Sacramento, we don't make

735
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,460
the cut, but neither does Los Angeles, which I find very interesting.

736
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,260
Los Angeles does not make the cut as well.

737
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,500
I wonder if it would have tilted it in Sacramento's favor if they had actually interviewed me

738
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,500
and Dan.

739
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,620
That would have been hilarious.

740
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,620
Who knows?

741
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,620
Who knows?

742
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:29,180
But see, for every you and Dan, there's 100,000 people that don't own any systems, so you

743
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,420
just have to remember.

744
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,700
Interesting comment from the chat room there, Funny Dale says, Seattle is number one only

745
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,540
because everyone has to stay inside because it always rains.

746
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,700
True. Interesting point.

747
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,460
It does have the highest precipitation rate in the country.

748
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,340
Does it have a pretty high suicide rate too?

749
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,380
I don't know. Anyway.

750
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,660
Sorry to make it morbid.

751
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,940
Loki's gonna tell us about a nice, fun, happy game to take our minds off of that.

752
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,340
Yes.

753
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:01,540
Hot Pixel is a new game by Atari for the PSP.

754
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,580
It's going to be just like WarioWare, it's going to feature hundreds of tiny 5 second

755
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,580
games.

756
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:11,540
We actually have pictures of this on our E3, on the PSP website by the way.

757
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,540
And it looks pretty cool.

758
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,040
It's just lots of weird stuff.

759
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:20,380
It's all going to have kind of an urban spin on it, so it's going to have a lot of digital

760
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,660
street culture stuff.

761
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:23,660
That was one of them.

762
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:27,980
There's actually another game I remember reading that was under, I can't remember what it was

763
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:38,460
released in Japan as, but it's coming out over here at WTF, called Work Time Fun, and

764
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,820
it's going to be another mini-game type of thing also for the PSP, and that one should

765
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,980
be pretty interesting too.

766
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,380
But I'm looking forward to checking this out.

767
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,820
They're going to have this actually at E3 I believe, and it's due out this fall.

768
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,820
I like this.

769
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:56,580
In our chat room, DJ Jenai says, since this is on the PSP, will they make a game called

770
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,700
Dead Pixel, get it, because PSPs have the dead pixels?

771
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,780
Nice, winner.

772
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,420
Comedy in Orange Lounge Chat, orangeloungeradio.com, click on the chat.

773
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,940
I wonder if that should go in the toilet paper joke book.

774
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,460
Alright, we're also going to find some comedy in our mailbag right now, at least I don't

775
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,340
know if there's any funny stuff in there, but we'll soon find out.

776
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,760
Every week you guys send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and Dark

777
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,520
Sakura picks out her favorites and brings them to us here on Orange Lounge Radio Live

778
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,120
each and every week. So it's actually been a little while since we've dived into the mailbag, so

779
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,360
we're going to go in there right now, Dark Sakura, put on your rubber gloves,

780
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,640
dig in there, and pull something out.

781
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,120
Ew! Mailbag at orangeontrader.com.

782
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,160
We actually got a really cool email from Zohar, who is one of our Serbian

783
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:45,880
listeners,

784
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,400
thanks to a little bit of silliness that we had last week regarding

785
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,200
actionscript.org. Yeah, the one where we talk about the different

786
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,680
They had a Serbian translation available, which I was like, why?

787
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,200
Yeah, I think we made an off-handed comment that like, you know, if you need that.

788
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,000
No, it was cool, but it struck me as very strange because it's the only technical side

789
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,120
I've seen with Serbian translation on it.

790
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:14,440
I mean, it was cool, but I was like, that's so random, you know, that was how I thought.

791
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,000
So hope we didn't offend any of our Serbian listeners.

792
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,240
We were just kind of surprised.

793
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,440
Usually, you know, Spanish, not so surprising when you're here, Russian, Japanese, you know,

794
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:40,820
I am a Serbian listener, I just wanted to say that you guys probably have a lot of listeners

795
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,360
in many different races from many different countries.

796
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,360
I am not sure how many Serbian listeners you have, but I just wanted to say that I am one

797
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,360
of them.

798
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,640
I hope that one day everybody in the world will be listening to OLR.

799
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,640
I'm glad they're not upset over the comment, because we didn't mean it offensively.

800
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,640
No, we certainly didn't mean it that way.

801
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,640
It was just random.

802
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:07,640
This is actually a response to an email complaining about the wee.

803
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,640
It's like what children call urine.

804
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,640
Here we go again.

805
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,640
I'm going to give this author the benefit of the doubt that the email was written

806
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,640
one or two days after the announcement when those jokes weren't old yet.

807
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,640
old yet.

808
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,220
It was sent by Bear Who Drive Car.

809
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,220
I do like that.

810
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,220
I do love that name.

811
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:29,260
The last part of this was, so I posed this question to you, gurus of gaming, and it said

812
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,260
Dark Sklokey.

813
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,260
Dark Sklokey?

814
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,260
Okay, whatever.

815
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:38,400
What are the best and worst console games, console names in video game history?

816
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,280
My vote Dreamcast best.

817
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,520
And I had actually replied saying my favorite, my personal favorite system name is probably

818
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,360
Dreamcast as well, although I like PC Engine Duo, it just sounds cool, rolls off the tongue,

819
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:53,840
Worst ever, Fairchild Channel F, which is also a horrible system, and the Pico, which

820
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,120
makes me think of salsa.

821
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,960
And then I got a response back that says, �Also, I have not heard one female call

822
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,480
into your show nor one female guest come on the show since you started taking calls and

823
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,480
doing interviews.

824
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,360
Being the only vocal female representation in the OLR, at least in podcast form, presents.

825
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,340
Do you feel an increased sense of responsibility, Dark Sakura, in being the honorary estrogen

826
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,040
ambassador?� I love that.

827
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,760
The estrogen ambassador.

828
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,400
Perhaps the awareness of this problem will motivate you to include a segment to promote

829
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,040
female awareness on your fine program.

830
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,560
I know you guys have discussed the problems and stereotypes that male gamers have for

831
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,560
female gamers.

832
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,120
I say the power is yours.

833
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,840
I've actually been sort of working on something like that, just schools kicking my ass.

834
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,240
We've had Roz called in just a couple of weeks ago, didn't we?

835
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,240
We've had Roz.

836
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:45,120
We've had Mistress Tia, who is not necessarily a gamer, but she definitely has estrogen.

837
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:49,420
Most of the girls were on the program before we switched over to this new format where

838
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:53,620
our live show is being podcasted and when we were doing the podcast for the first year,

839
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,840
we never had special guests.

840
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:02,080
So we had, what, we had DDR Angel, we had Iguana Girl, Mistress Tia, so it's just been

841
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,080
a while.

842
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,080
So I have to kidnap a few more of my females.

843
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,080
We've had Julie.

844
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,780
Yeah, but get Iguana Girl on the show because I know she's a gamer too, but I know she's

845
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,780
been busy.

846
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,780
She didn't come on the show because it was my birthday thing the other week.

847
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:21,780
I'll have to bring my good friend Disney Punk 10 up here.

848
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,780
She's into Kingdom Hearts and a lot of the same games that I do.

849
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,780
Best console name and worst console name? I have answers, I think.

850
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:36,780
I know you might find this a little silly, but I actually really like the name Jaguar for a system.

851
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,780
I thought it was kind of cool, even though the system itself kind of stuck.

852
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,580
stuck. It does have the best version of Tempest.

853
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,620
Worst console name, Philips CDI.

854
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,980
That doesn't tell me anything.

855
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,100
It plays CDs. Anything you want to add to that?

856
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,180
Well, no, because the Fairchild Channel F, it's like

857
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:59,900
why am I gonna play a channel something? And it was also just a really piece of shit

858
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,740
system. Also, another one I thought had a really good name, though, was The Odyssey II.

859
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,220
Because it's like, ooh, it's a gaming journey

860
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,820
in 1978 when I was two years old.

861
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:16,660
Do the math kids. So... More mail.

862
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,700
More mail. I like mail. I mean

863
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,780
I like me. Yeah.

864
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:27,100
I got an email from Rob who sends

865
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,300
a link found on a dig which I am going to

866
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:36,140
open at this time because I sort of didn't. It was the unluckiest

867
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:40,540
uh... xbox 360 owner oh god I heard about this guy

868
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,660
who apparently uh...

869
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:48,880
has kept getting a broken system uh... the guy's name is Chris Zarek

870
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,260
uh...

871
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,200
he uh...

872
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:51,940
purchased

873
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,460
he's actually on his fourth xbox 360

874
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:58,660
because of quality issues with uh... earlier machines

875
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:01,220
uh...

876
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,980
there's a actually it's uh...

877
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:09,540
something very interesting that was a nice summary that was posted by Rob in this email.

878
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:15,480
It's like, number one, five percent customer failure, dissatisfaction rate, one bad system

879
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,020
one in twenty, two bad systems one in four hundred, three systems one in eight thousand.

880
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:25,540
To get three in a row that had faulty issues with it?

881
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,260
God, and I was pissed when I got the one.

882
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,100
Yeah, you either have to be really lucky or a really big liar.

883
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,700
He had the blinking red lights.

884
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,760
Go buy a lottery ticket, dude. I'm calling bullshit on this story. I think he's a fucking

885
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,040
liar. Really? No, they're sitting with him with the last Xbox and the games? I think

886
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,760
he took all the worst possible case scenarios and just made up a damn story about it. From

887
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,640
what I'm seeing on here, I think every one of them had the blinking red light issue where

888
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:58,780
it wouldn't turn on. Yeah, that's the only issue. Well, that's the most common issue.

889
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,400
I've actually known someone who's turned in too for the same thing. Wow. I would have

890
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,600
so pissed if I got a second one well you know we should probably talk to Dan and

891
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,840
ask him how often he gets returns or how many people have had to return them

892
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,720
several times in a row I don't need to get Dan back on the show I tried to get

893
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:19,060
him on today but I actually fully believe it with the number of faulty

894
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:30,320
issues I was hearing with that I 100% believe it also there was an article he

895
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:36,440
he also sent me from Slashdot about what your next generation system preference

896
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,360
says about you. What if I won it all? Does that just make me greedy?

897
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,520
Yeah, it makes you very greedy. I guess I'm really greedy.

898
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,360
But there was a study done with the IGN people that says 36% claim loyalty to

899
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,280
the PlayStation 3,

900
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,520
28% to the Xbox 360, 22% are interested in the Wii.

901
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,920
Undecided gamers are a minority. Only 4%

902
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,160
have not decided. Now there's also lifestyle

903
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,280
decisions that are associated with that.

904
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,600
I'm just going to go off this chart here

905
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,200
that the people who

906
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,400
were undecided PS3 and 360

907
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,960
for their favorite handheld is the PSP.

908
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:24,120
For people who are buying the Wii, it's the DS. No shock there because

909
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,580
because in order to have put down the Wii when we have not really seen the

910
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,080
system

911
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,280
at all in any way, you would have to be a Nintendo fanboy.

912
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,200
Also what band do you enjoy most listening to?

913
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,640
This is the part I like. The Undecided group and the Wii group both are

914
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,920
Gorillaz fans. PS3 owners listen to M&M and Xbox 360 owners listen to Nirvana.

915
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,280
What's your favorite TV drama? I guess that means I ain't getting a PS3

916
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,080
because I'm not a big M&M fan, but the other two are fine, but the M&M

917
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,080
I'm not a big fan of him.

918
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,080
This is just statistical data.

919
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,000
What's your favorite TV drama?

920
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:05,640
Undecided and Xbox 360 all lost, PS3 owners like 24, and we potential owners are looking

921
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,640
for Smallville.

922
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,480
Hey, Smallville is actually decent.

923
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,200
Some episodes are kind of crap, but Lex is cute.

924
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,360
So also, do you own-

925
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,360
Yeah, I know.

926
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,360
I'm just shaking my head over here.

927
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,360
Hey, I'm trying to read.

928
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,640
Just that whole WB thing.

929
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,120
One of the questions is, do you own a TiVo or a digital video recorder?

930
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:31,040
19% were in the undecided group, 29% were in the PS3 group, 32% were in the Xbox 360

931
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,880
group, and the Wii group was 24.

932
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,520
There's two more sections.

933
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,240
Have you been to the movies in the last 30 days?

934
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:43,280
The greatest group of these were the PS3 and Xbox 360 players at 64 and 61%, respectively.

935
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,240
And the last is, do you own an iPod?

936
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,720
And the majority of those were the Xbox 360 group.

937
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,360
actually a tie between Undecided and PS3.

938
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,200
Although it's interesting, I call BS on the survey because it leaves no room for the people

939
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,760
who are still on the fence.

940
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:11,480
Considering how little we know about PlayStation 3 and Wii, you're basically asking whose fan

941
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,480
boy are you?

942
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,480
Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo?

943
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,640
That's what you're asking because the only one of those systems you can really say you

944
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:22,040
know something about the 360. But keep in mind the vast majority of people are

945
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:29,980
still relatively uninformed. I do like actually how the survey was said it

946
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:34,160
actually gives a pretty interesting perspective I think but I mean you are

947
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,120
right with the Xbox 360 being the one of course we know the most about because

948
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:42,720
it's already out still I think that is actually a pretty a pretty interesting

949
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:48,600
comparison I'm going over to our chat room for a comment Tigerclaw wants to

950
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,560
know speaking of Smallville have you guys seen the new Superman Returns

951
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:55,480
trailer yes and I'm hoping that this guy doesn't die or break his neck or follow

952
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:02,760
the curse billions that's all hey I hope he doesn't follow the curse I'm waiting

953
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,920
to see if the Superman curse is gonna get this guy it didn't hit Dean Cain

954
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,480
though did you notice I did I did except for his career yeah anyway she's doing

955
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,400
cell phone commercials I think that's true she didn't go the way of Margo

956
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:23,280
kidder because that bitch was crazy anyway okay um a email from Mark says

957
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,440
hey lol I love the show quick question I was in the store the other day and saw a

958
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,400
network adapter for the Nintendo GameCube what the hell is this for not

959
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,760
much not a lot not even a good paperweight because it doesn't weigh

960
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,200
much if you want to play PSO on your GameCube wait or not yeah PSO I want to

961
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,480
PSU, but that's the new game. If you want to play PSO on your GameCube, that's the reason

962
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:51,460
to have one. Otherwise, this will do nothing for you because Nintendo did not support internet

963
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,920
gaming very well with the GameCube, and that's what I say killed them in the competition.

964
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,880
I think that's very funny, given that they had the Satellaview back in the day in Japan.

965
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,000
However, using PSO, you could browse the internet, right? I think.

966
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I think so.

967
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Do I remember right?

968
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I don't think they had an actual browsing disk though for the GameCube.

969
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Well, a lot of the other systems, they actually release browser disks.

970
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
You know, honestly though, PSO on the GameCube is worthless.

971
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
The Xbox version is superior, mostly because of the voice chat.

972
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
There are other items in the GameCube one.

973
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah, but you know, I just...

974
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Which are all on Blueburst.

975
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I'm not a big fan of the Nintendo version.

976
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
There's other things I like about the GameCube, don't get me wrong, but PSO is not one of them.

977
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
We also have one more email.

978
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Okay.

979
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,820
from uh...

980
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,580
i guess it's doralee

981
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,820
is how it would be pronounced

982
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:43,680
um... first off love the show next a couple of shows back you guys talked about a

983
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,280
silent hill fan film

984
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,080
any idea where i can get that any help would be great

985
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,880
i know this is a busy week so just drop me a line later if you can thanks

986
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,040
uh... yeah you can find it on youtube

987
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,160
uh... you can find everything on youtube

988
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,520
uh... well you can actually download the dvdi so from

989
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,600
i don't even remember the site now

990
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:07,600
If you search for Silent Hill No Escape, you should be able to find it.

991
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,600
It was pretty decently done.

992
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,600
I mean, it was very neat.

993
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,600
But if you don't want to bother with download, it's just on YouTube.

994
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,600
It's broken up into, like, seven parts.

995
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,600
Yeah.

996
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,600
And watch the dog ending.

997
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,600
All right.

998
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,600
If you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangeontraded.com.

999
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,600
Do it!

1000
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,600
Bucky!

1001
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,600
Bongo demands it.

1002
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
Nintendo!

1003
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,600
Big conference this week.

1004
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,720
People are eagerly anticipating what they're going to say.

1005
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:41,280
Exactly, and if you can't make the conference, I guess, you can actually, well you can watch

1006
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,440
it at the official World Store.

1007
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:50,240
They're actually going to be streaming it starting at 1230 Eastern to visitors who come

1008
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,240
in.

1009
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,840
Space is limited of course, so first come first serve.

1010
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:59,640
Also, of course, you can view it streaming on practically every other gaming site out

1011
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:06,640
there, including if you're in the area, you can watch at the E3 Outpost. So check it out.

1012
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:12,660
Alright. Yeah, because I believe Scott over at All Games is doing something with GameTrailers.com

1013
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:15,880
with the Nintendo Press Conference. Yeah, they're streaming a GameTrailers stuff. Which

1014
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,320
is interesting because that means that like, you know, tons of people are streaming this

1015
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:25,240
Nintendo Conference, so it's gonna, you know, it goes to show how immediate, you know, people

1016
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,480
want their news now with this Wii stuff, so this is interesting.

1017
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,760
I will be watching.

1018
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,880
If they have it on a big screen at Outpost, which I'm told they're going to, I will be

1019
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,120
there with my butt parked in the front row couch ready to see this conference, so I'm

1020
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,120
very excited.

1021
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,800
Since we're not good enough to get one of the magic tickets.

1022
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,920
I've got nothing else to do.

1023
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:50,360
I want to grab McD's, grab some really fatty, something with bacon and eggs, and sit down

1024
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,760
and watch HDTV in a press conference.

1025
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,080
Now I want to spend my week. So come down to e3 outpost and be lazy and fat with us. It'll be fun

1026
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:04,860
Make sure that you have a craving for that McDonald's burger. You know, what Oh bacon

1027
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,960
You're really making me grossed out now. All right

1028
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:12,700
Speaking of lazy and fat. We have a special guest joining us. Say a little meekly top. No, I'm kidding

1029
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:19,200
I'm kidding. You're a jerk. He's he's neither lazy nor fat hair is gone. Yeah, it looks like a monkey

1030
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,200
You do look like a monkey.

1031
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,200
Thank you.

1032
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,200
Miklotov got all his hair cut off today.

1033
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,200
Can we call you Son Goku now?

1034
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,200
What? No, that sounds stupid.

1035
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,200
Because that was the Monkey King.

1036
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,200
I don't want to be a king of monkeys.

1037
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,200
You don't look that much like a monkey.

1038
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,200
I like your hair short though.

1039
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,200
So a monkey doesn't want to be a duck and you don't want to be a monkey.

1040
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,200
I didn't like your hair long because it made you look like a wet dog.

1041
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,200
Yes it did.

1042
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,200
I thought that it was cute long.

1043
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
I'm not a fan of long hair.

1044
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,200
It was floppy in a cute way.

1045
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,200
What's that word?

1046
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,200
Manageable.

1047
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,200
Yeah, that thing. I can't say it.

1048
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,200
I can't say it.

1049
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,200
That's what detanglers are for.

1050
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,120
Real quickly before we get back on the news, because we're running really long this segment,

1051
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:58,400
we didn't start the show until very late tonight, how's your gaming week going?

1052
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:04,720
It's going fine.

1053
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,080
Any games of note that you've been playing that you want to share?

1054
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:17,400
I've been playing Final Fantasy XI a lot, and then I've been getting ready for E3.

1055
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:22,440
Now for those that may not know, we've been on the show for a while now, and we get new

1056
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,440
listeners every week.

1057
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,440
What's my shirt say?

1058
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,640
Yes, he's wearing his Konami shirt today.

1059
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:30,840
So Miklotov actually works for Konami, but due to NDA's, he can't share with us a whole

1060
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,040
lot of information, but E3?

1061
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,680
Yeah, there sure is E3.

1062
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,680
We gonna have a good time at Konami's booth?

1063
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,560
Maybe, depends on what you like.

1064
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,960
Yeah, he ain't budging.

1065
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,960
He ain't budging.

1066
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,960
I'm going to have a good time at Nintendo's booth.

1067
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,960
Why? Why Nintendo? Because I want to play the Wii. So you're not working at Konami's booth?

1068
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,960
Nope, but I'm going to have all the official Konami attire so I'll look like I'm working.

1069
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,960
So if you ask me a question, I'm just going to lie and make something up.

1070
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,960
Do your boss listen to this show? I don't care. We are having Metal Gear Solid 6

1071
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,960
for the iMac.

1072
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,960
We already told you it's going to be at Konami's booth anyway.

1073
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,160
No, remember we had that story a few weeks ago?

1074
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,960
Yeah, but who says it's true?

1075
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,300
The latest issue Nintendo Power confirmed the...

1076
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,300
I got mine.

1077
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,760
I don't remember even subscribing or ordering it, but they sent me one.

1078
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,240
Nintendo Power confirmed the Port of the Ruin theme, but, Loki, you can throw this in now.

1079
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,240
The Silent Hill thing may have actually been incorrect.

1080
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:34,440
I got the name wrong, or they changed the name on me.

1081
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,680
Konami trying to keep me on my toes.

1082
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:41,520
Actually, joystick, they're there now in LA, so what do they do?

1083
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,440
they go and go snap pictures of stuff that's going on and Konami's putting up their booth

1084
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:49,280
and they have Silent Hill Origins with the O in Origins being a zero.

1085
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,000
Wasn't that the first game with Alessa and all them?

1086
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,400
I don't know, but Silent Hill Origins, definitely going to be there in some form.

1087
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,440
Oh, I know what it was.

1088
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,160
So not Original Sin.

1089
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,240
Not Original Sin, but they probably just, I mean if you think about Original Sin sounds

1090
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,120
stupid so Origins kind of rolls off the tongue better I guess.

1091
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,480
I think Original Sin was a better name.

1092
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,420
I can't wait for all the mail that says we were lying

1093
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,400
except we did get the portrait of ruin thing

1094
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,860
absolutely nailed that

1095
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:23,440
original sin and origins oh those are so different

1096
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,820
fucking morons final still come out at the same time though

1097
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,440
either way it's on the psp

1098
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,200
I know what the big news is

1099
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,820
silent hill for the game com

1100
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,120
what's a game com

1101
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:41,880
A really piece of shit LCD system that I actually happen to have one of those too.

1102
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:47,000
We got to move on or we're going to be here through E3 because we'll be taping so long.

1103
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,240
There is a brand new PlayStation 3 controller that's going to be unveiled next week.

1104
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:55,540
So those of you guys that love the Boomerang PlayStation 3 controller, tear.

1105
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,400
I wanted to do like Batman cosplay with that.

1106
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,400
Not going to happen.

1107
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:03,480
Well, it says the rumors abound that it's going to be unveiled at Sony's press conference

1108
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,320
which is Monday night if I remember or Monday afternoon yeah what's gonna

1109
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:12,400
happen for while we're on the road so well we'll probably just get into town

1110
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,800
right about time they're gonna have those available for download though so

1111
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:21,520
watch it later yeah so no idea what it's gonna look like but they're saying that

1112
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:27,120
probably gonna go back to a more dual shock style look I disagree I think they

1113
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,840
are gonna change something radically about it but I think it look like a

1114
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:34,180
giant schlong yeah I think that boomerang thing was a little weird so

1115
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:40,200
it's it's not gonna look like you know Batman accessories all right it'll look

1116
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:46,680

1127
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,920
on ps2 Sega's a booth I'm definitely spending more time at this year than I

1128
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,100
did last year they've got a

1129
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:40,120
pretty solid lineup it sounds like I hope they have the chairs oh

1130
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,760
outside their theater or whatever no no no the chairs that were in the theater

1131
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:49,040
comfy they had these big theater seats with like cup holders and crap

1132
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,840
and they were like as big as the chair that's in the studio.

1133
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,700
There's this theme with you at E3 and that is me and you always seem to pass

1134
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:00,280
out in very strange areas at E3. Because I remember there's a picture of us

1135
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:04,640
and I think we were sitting in the corner of some random booth in

1136
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,880
Kensho Hall.

1137
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,920
I didn't go to Sega's room.

1138
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,560
It was one of the separate rooms. It was freaking

1139
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,280
a claims room. Yeah, we passed out there too. And drinking coke,

1140
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:19,800
the free code that was there and I found

1141
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:24,320
all about food and nap and I met other people we decided to take it to camp out

1142
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,560
on the little staircase

1143
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,960
outside of a Squeenix's little thing

1144
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,480
we were just sitting back there talking and apparently I crap who was I forgot

1145
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,440
it was another

1146
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,600
a radio personages are

1147
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:41,400
are had a home page who knew somebody I knew so we were talking about them

1148
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:45,640
it was pretty hilarious though it was like I took ended up also taking a nap

1149
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:51,640
Um, some are way back in, uh, behind the, uh, SOCOM 3 area.

1150
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,160
How you nap at E3 is beyond me.

1151
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,160
Alright, we gotta keep going.

1152
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,160
This is tiring.

1153
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,160
Low-key.

1154
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,160
I'm a busy girl.

1155
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:02,320
Uh, this is, this is gonna get a little bit outside the realm of gaming, I believe, but

1156
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:06,680
there was big DVD news this week, and therefore there's gonna be a corresponding game that's

1157
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,680
going on with it.

1158
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:11,880
Well, we knew that Lego Star Wars 2 was coming out, and Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy,

1159
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:16,080
trilogy, and of course now with the sense of re-releasing the original trilogy DVDs

1160
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,360
on September 12th, the game is going to come out at the same time. Very similar to what

1161
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:25,200
they did with Star Wars Battlefront II when it came out with episode 3. So, not too surprising

1162
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:30,560
there, but what is surprising is that it is going to be on the Xbox 360 as well, to get

1163
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:37,000
some high-res, high-definition Legos. Cool, and achievements. I can get high-definition

1164
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,360
Legos right now though. I can go play with Legos. I can go to Toys R Us and buy me some

1165
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:46,660
Legos. I love Legos. They're awesome. Actually, the Lego Star Wars games are games I keep

1166
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:50,160
meaning to check out that I never do, so maybe I'll get it this time. I have a business proposal

1167
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:56,160
for us all right now. Oh, dear. In a few months we should do a podcast from Legoland. No.

1168
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:02,100
Legoland sucks, dude. We don't got the travel budget. Legoland is a lame ass theme park.

1169
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,100
You find us some advertisers, we'll be fine.

1170
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:11,020
Hey, pay for us to go to Legoland and we'll say that your product doesn't suck.

1171
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:14,620
We go Knott's Berry Farm too, we'll just have a crappy theme park.

1172
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,620
Let's just go to Disneyland.

1173
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:20,340
Loki's got a barrage of television and movie game news.

1174
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,940
Yeah, goodie.

1175
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:27,360
It's not surprising, everyone's jumping on the bandwagon here.

1176
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:32,080
First one we've got coming out, THQ announced The Sopranos is heading to PlayStation 2 and

1177
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:37,720
Xbox 360 and scheduled to be released this holiday season and of course you get to play

1178
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:42,280
all these Sopranos cast and yeah it's basically Godfather all over again.

1179
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:46,280
So look for that, should be fun.

1180
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:53,080
Then of course we've got, let's see here Reservoir Dogs was going to be coming out and this one

1181
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:59,440
actually is being released by some really tiny company and as far as I've read none

1182
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:07,040
One of the cast, I don't know, Quentin Tarantino's not pretending that this isn't actually going

1183
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:15,240
on, that the game's not being made, and just, I don't know.

1184
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:19,280
It's interesting, they're going to try to go through some of the movie's plot and show

1185
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,200
you things that you might not have seen in the actual movie, and yeah.

1186
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,200
So it'll be good.

1187
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,660
And, of course, the one I'm kind of excited about, Scarface, is going to be coming out

1188
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:37,780
this September, and actually this one looks really sweet. They've got a huge voice cast,

1189
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:42,180
everybody except for Al Pacino. Al Pacino, he actually picked out his voice actor for

1190
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:47,600
this, so you've got tons of talent in here, tons of people that are going to be in it,

1191
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:52,200
and just looks really awesome, and of course, going to be very similar to Vice City, which...

1192
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,000
Will that be coming out on the Wii?

1193
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,680
I don't think so.

1194
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,360
Say hello to my little Wii.

1195
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,400
Well, they're not going to say that.

1196
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,120
So that'll be cool.

1197
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,160
All right.

1198
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,160
That's it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio.

1199
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,720
We're going to take ourselves a quick little break here,

1200
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,460
and we'll be back with more just before E3.

1201
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,880
Before we go to break, I just want

1202
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,340
to remind you guys real quick, this

1203
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,440
is what our E3 schedule is going to be like.

1204
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,100
If you guys are on the podcast stream,

1205
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,120

1211
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,320

1212
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:53,440
allgames.com's feed 630 ish is the time that all depends on LA how basically how

1213
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,160
fast we can get our butts back from the show and upstairs to start taping that's

1214
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,440
really what everything relies on so we're giving ourselves 30 minutes we

1215
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:05,920
hope that's enough time but we'll see so all right we're gonna go to a break now

1216
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,240
when we come back we're gonna talk about the DS lite we're gonna talk about full
