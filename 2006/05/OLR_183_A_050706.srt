00:00:14,717 --> 00:00:22,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, May 7th, 2006, Boobies in Oblivion brings on the Wrath of the M rating, news on the new DS, and E3 Madness!

2
00:00:32,964 --> 00:00:36,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:37,086
[SPEAKER_05]: It is May 7th, 2006.

4
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:45,990
[SPEAKER_05]: This is episode number 183 of our live radio program and podcast dedicated to games that don't suck.

5
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:52,453
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes we've got to talk about games that do suck just because we want to taunt them and laugh at them and take them outside and beat them.

6
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:55,254
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

7
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:57,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

8
00:00:57,715 --> 00:01:01,417
[SPEAKER_05]: In that corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:01:01,717 --> 00:01:01,857
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,640
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

11
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Bunny?

12
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you said bunny and I was thinking of the Cadbury Bunny.

13
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:09,623
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I thought too.

14
00:01:09,643 --> 00:01:10,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how fattening those things are?

15
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:11,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're so good though.

16
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:13,486
[SPEAKER_05]: They're so good but they're so bad for you.

17
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:17,449
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to tell myself that things that are very tasty like that are really, you know, they taste like poo.

18
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:19,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, chocolate is the color of poo.

19
00:01:20,918 --> 00:01:24,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to keep that in my head whenever I look at chocolate, like I want to eat some.

20
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,042
[SPEAKER_00]: But green tea frappuccino doesn't look like anything.

21
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:27,942
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks like yummy.

22
00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:28,823
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had one.

23
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:29,603
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two.

24
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:34,166
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them, though, had fat-free milk in it because I got it at Whole Foods.

25
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:39,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet if I went through the last 20 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, 10 of them would start off with you talking about food.

26
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:43,732
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

27
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:08,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

28
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:09,920
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

29
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,260
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a busy, busy show tonight, a lot of news.

30
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:19,343
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to join in the fun, if you're listening live to us right now on OrangeLoungeRadio.com, head on over to our chat room, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:22,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that easy to join the chat room.

33
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,322
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:48,034
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

35
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,256
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought a Judge Dredd pinball machine.

36
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:51,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, why didn't you buy a good machine?

37
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:52,697
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good machine.

38
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:54,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, it's really awesome.

39
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:57,820
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're getting this other one called, I think, Frenzy or something.

40
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,382
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be a really expensive pin table.

41
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:06,245
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting one that's kind of in crap repair for like, you know, a few hundred, but we're going to fix it up and resell it for like $5,000.

42
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:07,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Call me when you get Pinbot.

43
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:09,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a freaking Pinbot.

44
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:12,509
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, the machine I really want, really, really... Bride of Pinbot.

45
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:15,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Bride of Pinbot was awesome, but I want Black Knight 2000.

46
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:17,202
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan and I, when I first moved out here, we used to go eat at this Godfather's Pizza because I worked at GNC and it was right there.

48
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:49,875
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd drop off my deposit and go get dinner at Godfather's.

49
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:52,897
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a Last Action Hero pinball machine in there.

50
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:55,218
[SPEAKER_00]: And we played the hell out of it.

51
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:01,502
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the reason we stopped eating at that Godfather's Pizza was because they got rid of the damn pinball table.

52
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:03,383
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had Snow Brothers there, too.

53
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,826
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great game, arcade game.

54
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:08,409
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Bubble Bobble, but it's not.

55
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,330
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?

56
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:09,831
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.

57
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:10,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.

58
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:12,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I play that on the Ultra Kade.

59
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:16,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the rest of my gaming week had to actually do with me downloading gaming stuff.

60
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,441
[SPEAKER_00]: I played a crap load of Ragnarok.

61
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:20,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I am now level 64, 48.

62
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:29,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Addict, Final Fantasy Ask me how much Final Fantasy I played this week How much did you play?

63
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:39,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Zip, thank you You're just in detox Zip You're going to get back on the habit like you did before After E3, you bet It's right where I'm going, right after E3 is over Yeah, but I can bring Ragnarok with me

64
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,381
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

65
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:09,866
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's all the, let's sing the Silent Hill song!

66
00:05:09,886 --> 00:05:11,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Heather!

67
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:13,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's sing the whole thing, it was great.

68
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:15,250
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the dog ending.

69
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:22,075
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the one thing that disappointed me about the Silent Hill movie is I wanted after the credits there to be a dog ending or a UFO ending.

70
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,177
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the DVD is going to have a UFO ending.

71
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:24,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet!

72
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:30,522
[SPEAKER_00]: It better not be the craptastic same ones like they had in the games because the only good one was like the Heather one.

73
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:36,881
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, on the Internet Movie Database, they said that the original cut of the Silent Hill movie was three and a half hours long.

74
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:39,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, deleted scenes!

75
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:45,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Take everything you read on Internet Movie Database with a grain of salt, but, you know, still be kind of neat if the DVD is... I'd rather take it with a spoon of sugar.

76
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:46,889
[SPEAKER_05]: ...action-packed.

77
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:57,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think a lot of people now are filming extra stuff, even though they know it's not going to be in their things they think are neat, because it's going to be on the DVD.

78
00:05:57,578 --> 00:06:00,240
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have, like, an Uber Director's Edition unrated...

79
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:05,316
[SPEAKER_00]: and Hoopla We're Gonna Save the World type DVD release.

80
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:09,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the 20 million Lord of the Rings DVDs that are out.

81
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:11,983
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know Kevin Smith does it.

82
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:12,883
[SPEAKER_00]: He does it on purpose.

83
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:14,685
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's hilarious.

84
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:19,550
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the DVD of Silent Hill is going to be like the diggity...

85
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:22,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Just if you want to hear hilarity, and then we'll get back into games.

86
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:24,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's Mallrats.

87
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,150
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either Mallrats or Chasing Amy.

88
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,513
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those, when you start listening to the director's commentary, they go, fuck DVD, because they were originally recording it for the LaserDisc edition.

89
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:34,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember if it was Mallrats or Chasing Amy.

90
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:34,454
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the two.

91
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Our stuff has a comment for you.

92
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:36,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what?

93
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:38,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just to grain the whole damn shaker.

94
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:42,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Hee hee.

95
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:45,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

96
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, though, that same night, I had a dream that I was stuck in Silent Hill with a dog.

97
00:06:52,304 --> 00:06:55,546
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the craziest, weirdest, most freaking out... It was an actual nightmare.

98
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:56,407
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not kidding.

99
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:57,888
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a dog there the whole time.

100
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:59,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Same stupid little dog wearing headphones.

101
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,830
[SPEAKER_05]: You are so weird.

102
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:03,131
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.

103
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:05,473
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was because I also was eating spaghetti.

104
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:09,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, blame your problems on spaghetti.

105
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:15,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay, you ever notice that if you eat something before you go to bed and you've, like, watched something, you almost always end up having a weird dream?

106
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:17,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does it just happen to me?

107
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember my dreams, like, ever.

108
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:24,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Once every three months, I'll remember a dream.

109
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:26,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories It's not open yet.

110
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:27,589
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking it to E3.

111
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:49,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

112
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

113
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost non-existent.

114
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:56,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's true.

115
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:59,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki got married, in case you weren't listening last week.

116
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So congratulations, Loki, on your marriage.

117
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:06,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Mutant Storm Reloaded on Xbox Live's arcade.

118
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:07,486
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty fun.

119
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:13,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories, because I can.

120
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:14,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And

121
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:21,912
[SPEAKER_03]: The new firmware update did help some of the problems, but they're still there.

122
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:36,686
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, when you start playing more of the multiplayer stuff and actually starting to play the other modes that are in there, like team playing stuff, you start noticing how rushed the multiplayer was in the game, and how it really sucks and is really unfinished.

123
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:37,727
[SPEAKER_03]: But,

124
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:38,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Still fun.

125
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:39,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

126
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:47,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I've been playing a little bit of LocoRoco, which is also the demo that you can download for the PSP firmware 2.7.

127
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:49,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned that last week.

128
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:51,077
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually kind of cool.

129
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:51,998
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different game.

130
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:53,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

131
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:58,523
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of seems in the same pot as Katamari.

132
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:00,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of a little quirky game.

133
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:03,987
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of if Katamari and Yoshi's Island had a baby.

134
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:04,707
[SPEAKER_03]: This would be...

135
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:11,536
[SPEAKER_03]: A big, cute, cutesy blob.

136
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:12,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Something's wrong with it, baby.

137
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:14,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that, yeah.

138
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:16,819
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's different, I'll give them that.

139
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:20,902
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it, I think.

140
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:22,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

141
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:28,538
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week, actually, I didn't play anything new because of my work trip that really cut into my week.

142
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:31,299
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted $10 a night for internet access in my hotel.

143
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:32,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, F you.

144
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,260
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I don't like about swanky hotels.

145
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:40,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that my work puts me up in swanky hotels when I go travel, but then they want more money for internet access that my work's not going to pay for.

146
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:43,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't get to really play any games.

147
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:46,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't play World of Warcraft, even though I canceled my account anyway.

148
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:48,444
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I got bored enough, I would have reactivated it.

149
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:50,527
[SPEAKER_05]: or any Flash games or anything.

150
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:52,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did have my DS.

151
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing my brain training mostly every day.

152
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:59,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I've unlocked, I think I've got my 17th stamp as of today.

153
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:03,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've unlocked the triangle math was the last thing I got, the hard mode.

154
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:05,247
[SPEAKER_05]: No, wait, I think there was another game after that.

155
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I only have one more game left to unlock.

156
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Brain Training is going good.

157
00:10:09,131 --> 00:10:10,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Also Tetris DS.

158
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:16,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Extifer, my roommate, has been borrowing my Tetris DS and he actually unlocked level 20.

159
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:23,101
[SPEAKER_05]: He beat the whole game and so playing Tetris on level 20 is insane because the blocks don't even fall.

160
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:24,442
[SPEAKER_05]: They just drop.

161
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine just having the blocks drop every time.

162
00:10:26,964 --> 00:10:27,745
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it does on level 20.

163
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:34,730
[SPEAKER_05]: But level 20 is inspired by classic NES Tetris which is pretty cool because you know how Tetris DS is all inspired by different

164
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,330
[SPEAKER_05]: N.E.S.

165
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,031
[SPEAKER_05]: games of the past.

166
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:37,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, level 20 is N.E.S.

167
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Tetris, so I thought that was pretty rad, and it has a remix of the theme.

168
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:44,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Played six-player multiplayer Tetris DS last night.

169
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:46,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Craziness.

170
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:47,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolute craziness.

171
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:47,795
[SPEAKER_05]: But fun.

172
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:48,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

173
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:51,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

174
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:07,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up on what's going on for E3.

175
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:11,355
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, we have a whole lot of news to get into tonight.

176
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:14,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, we have a very special announcement.

177
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:15,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let Loki plug this.

178
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:19,997
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something we've been teasing for a few weeks, but it is now official.

179
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,158
[SPEAKER_05]: We're announcing it tonight.

180
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:22,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, tell us about it.

181
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:25,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course, we're working on a new site for weeks now.

182
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,440
[SPEAKER_03]: New site is going to be, I think it is the only...

183
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:33,380
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP formatted site covering E3.

184
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:37,772
[SPEAKER_03]: E3 on PSP.com

185
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:06,050
[SPEAKER_03]: and so we'll get a lot of exclusive content.

186
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:17,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to the Nintendo Party on Tuesday, so hopefully you'll actually get to see what the Nintendo Party looks like, because a lot of people don't get to go to the E3, let alone go to parties and stuff like that.

187
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:20,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely lots of content on there.

188
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:24,820
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some stuff on there already, just to give you an idea of what they're...

189
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:25,810
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

190
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:48,948
[SPEAKER_05]: To what extent just yet?

191
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:52,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Bobby said he'd do some on-camera stuff for us, so I'm going to hold him to that.

192
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:56,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, you're going to have videos with myself, Loki.

193
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:59,644
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can give DarkSakura enough sugar, maybe we'll get her in one of the videos.

194
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:01,827
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe if I can find a Dr. Doom mask.

195
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:19,350
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm sure we'll have Bobby and then hopefully maybe Scott and Lawrence as well so all on the E3 on PSP site giving you walkthroughs of Boost just talking about games and of course you know our big thing is interactiveness so if you guys want to send us an email and say hey guys

196
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Check this out.

197
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:23,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see this.

198
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:25,625
[SPEAKER_05]: We did this last year at E3.

199
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:31,591
[SPEAKER_05]: We pulled the shows from our archives, but if you talk to some of our listeners who've been around a while, you can probably find copies of these shows.

200
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:33,773
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually opened it up during these shows.

201
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Like on Wednesday, we said, okay, send us your questions.

202
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:37,697
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out the answers on Thursday.

203
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:42,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And we actually took all the questions and went out on the floor and figured out the answers to them and brought them to you on Thursday's show.

204
00:13:42,802 --> 00:13:44,743
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to do the same thing with the site as well.

205
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:51,471
[SPEAKER_05]: The other great thing about the site is that if you're an E3 attendee, we're going to put maps of the show floor on there.

206
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:53,473
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, that's the one thing that's still missing, right?

207
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, it's up there.

208
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:55,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, did you get it done?

209
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:56,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's up there.

210
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:59,498
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not just going to be maps, just like everything.

211
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:09,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's good to have, if you have access to even some of the Wi-Fi there, you can actually see, you know, okay, I'm waiting on this giant line.

212
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:11,908
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly are they showing at the Sony booth or, you know,

213
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:13,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

214
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:40,487
[SPEAKER_05]: You can look at it in Firefox, Internet Explorer, but it's not going to look right.

215
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,187
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're okay with that, go ahead.

216
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,527
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a lot of great videos you can look at.

217
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:45,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're asking if Flash is on there yet.

218
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:49,529
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't support Flash on this because not everyone is upgrading their firmware to 2.7.

219
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:54,430
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't want to force people to do that and didn't want to exclude people from certain things.

220
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no Flash on there, but it'll still be pretty quick and...

221
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:02,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, the Flash on the PSP is not that great right now.

222
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,613
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to play with it, see what I can do with it.

223
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:08,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll table the Flash thing for a later OLR PSP upgrade.

224
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:09,454
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be cool.

225
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:17,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, later on when we're done with the PSP site, E3 and PSP, you'll see some definite improvements.

226
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:19,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I have ideas.

227
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:25,516
[SPEAKER_03]: But lots and lots and lots of content, and it should be good.

228
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:29,057
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go into some other news.

229
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:34,134
[SPEAKER_05]: While you're all checking out E3 on PSP.com, we'll talk about Nintendo.

230
00:15:34,154 --> 00:15:42,998
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a little bit of a follow-up to last week's mini-episode, and by the way, if you haven't figured it out, there's a little joke at the end of last week's episode.

231
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:50,220
[SPEAKER_05]: If you turned off the show before DarkSakura and I came back and talked about the Wii, you missed the last ten minutes of the show.

232
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,940
[SPEAKER_00]: And we laugh at you.

233
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we played a little gag.

234
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:58,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most people probably figured it out because they probably saw the MP3 wasn't finished yet, but just in case you missed it,

235
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:01,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, DarkSakura and I did talk about the Wii last week when Loki wasn't here.

236
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:09,788
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things we talked about was the conspiracy theories going on on the internet that, oh, the Wii's not trademarked, so it can't be true.

237
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:12,990
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all a viral gag campaign.

238
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,011
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pulling your leg.

239
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:17,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo's going to come out and announce the real name.

240
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:18,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

241
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:22,775
[SPEAKER_05]: This week, the Wii trademark did show up on the website.

242
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:24,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's there.

243
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:27,077
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to check the database for yourself, have fun.

244
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:27,837
[SPEAKER_05]: W-I-I

245
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:30,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has trademarked it.

246
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:34,405
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually right up there on their site as a tab.

247
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:41,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm sure that you guys will have crazy conspiracy theories that say, well it's still fake or whatever.

248
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,590
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's going to be the name of the console, just deal with it.

249
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:52,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most people are kind of backing off on the name now and waiting to see what the games are like, which is what we were saying all along last week.

250
00:16:53,034 --> 00:17:07,408
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the name does exactly what any type of name should do like I said last week the whole purpose you know things you should do when advertising anything is to have something simple something that people are going to remember and something that people are going to talk about and I think that they've accomplished that pretty well

251
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:09,930
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fine.

252
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:10,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we'll see.

253
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:15,772
[SPEAKER_05]: The real test will be in a few days when we start seeing the games at E3.

254
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:20,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki has a news article on some of the games we're going to be seeing on the Wii.

255
00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:22,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we'll see this at E3, but later on.

256
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:23,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

257
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:28,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Spider-Man 3, they're going to have a special version for it, which is not surprising.

258
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:33,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, most of the games I think that are going to be ported to it are going to be having unique versions of it.

259
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:35,959
[SPEAKER_03]: But got to report it, Spider-Man 3.

260
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Unique version for the Wii.

261
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:39,710
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that'd be pretty interesting.

262
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:48,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think that ties in with something we talked about a while ago, where they're saying that they're going to have some web slinging you can do with the controller or something.

263
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:49,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the same thing.

264
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:52,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just me, or does all this control stuff sound too good to be true?

265
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:59,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can't help it at this stage, I get flashbacks to the Power Glove, and I kind of go...

266
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:04,575
[SPEAKER_05]: The Power Glove was a neat concept, but it wasn't really that great.

267
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:07,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, technology has progressed, what, 15 years since then?

268
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:11,838
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can't help but wonder, is it going to be accurate?

269
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:15,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it really going to be as in the game as everyone says it is?

270
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Better than the eye toy.

271
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

272
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,821
[SPEAKER_05]: And the eye toy is still kind of gimmicky to me, too.

273
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:21,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So I...

274
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:24,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Midway's Blitz The League

275
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, whatever they're going to be calling it this time.

276
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:54,252
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, it looks pretty cool, especially if they're going to be doing similar stuff to what Madden's going to be doing.

277
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:58,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be a pretty good game, so looking forward to that.

278
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:03,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, God knows what other stuff they're going to have coming out.

279
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:05,995
[SPEAKER_03]: But Blitz League will be pretty cool.

280
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:14,629
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole, like, throwing the football with the... That just... Oh, I can just see remotes going through TVs.

281
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:25,412
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they have VAs doing their... They're having a passing and kicking demo, as well as a one-game demo for Madden 2007.

282
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:27,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see how it's going to work.

283
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:30,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting for, like, a game where...

284
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:32,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Super Smash Bros.

285
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:34,537
[SPEAKER_03]: or something like that where you start beating someone with a remote.

286
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:36,219
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun.

287
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Going over to our chat room for some comments.

288
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:41,624
[SPEAKER_05]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.

289
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:43,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Paraparaparadise

290
00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:11,641
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so bad.

291
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:40,908
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, a series that you talk about a lot is coming to the Wii, right?

292
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:41,669
Wii!

293
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:45,051
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, you're probably the only person I know that still plays these games.

294
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Dan does too, and a lot of our friends.

295
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,834
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you two live happily ever after.

296
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:52,416
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because we're old school, like that, yo.

297
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:55,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Metal Slug is coming out on the Wii!

298
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,021
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I was going to call it Wii from now on.

299
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take bets on how long before that gets annoying.

300
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:04,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you had right now, you just won.

301
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:05,437
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

302
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:06,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut up.

303
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:11,202
[SPEAKER_00]: The Metal Slug Anthology is going to be out on the Wii.

304
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:16,307
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be the 20 millionth release of Metal Slug whatever.

305
00:21:17,071 --> 00:21:18,272
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love Metal Slug.

306
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:22,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is saying it's going to be the complete Metal Slug Arcade Edition with a bunch of bonus stuff.

307
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:23,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

308
00:21:23,774 --> 00:21:29,157
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you use the Wii controller in a, quote, new and unique way.

309
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:34,339
[SPEAKER_00]: But he didn't, you know, it was actually announced by Ben Herman, who's the president of SNK.

310
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't give any details.

311
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:42,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that's supposed to, I think, go hand in hand with the release of SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters.

312
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:45,745
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll use the Wii controller too, you know.

313
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:52,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw up your money that's going to be thrown into the fire because you're throwing away your money to buy this stupid game.

314
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:58,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're put in mummy mode, do you like wave your Wii and puke or something?

315
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:02,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you be able to use your Wii to actually make the graphics look next gen?

316
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:04,401
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

317
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:10,186
[SPEAKER_00]: If SNK really wanted to make us happy, they would freaking put out another Metal Slug on the Neo Geo.

318
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,132
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us who have our Neo Geo's collecting dice.

319
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:13,933
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not make me happy.

320
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:14,754
[SPEAKER_03]: All three of you.

321
00:22:14,774 --> 00:22:16,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop making Metal Slug games.

322
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:17,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, there's not three of us.

323
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:18,176
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at least five.

324
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:22,519
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do an S&K Classic Collection or something like that and be done with it.

325
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop re-releasing Metal Slug.

326
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:25,021
[SPEAKER_03]: No one buys them.

327
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I do.

328
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:29,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but did you buy every single re-release of it?

329
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:30,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes.

330
00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:33,828
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have them on our meme.

331
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:38,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, what if, like, say that we have, like, the PlayStation hooked up one day?

332
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,411
[SPEAKER_00]: I love SNK I love SNK almost as much as I love Sega

333
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:08,803
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

334
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:39,714
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that idea.

335
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:40,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you know what?

336
00:23:40,757 --> 00:23:41,579
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me ammo.

337
00:23:42,318 --> 00:23:45,600
[SPEAKER_03]: No, what I want to do, I want to convert one of the ferrets into a rev mode.

338
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:46,541
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be hilarious.

339
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:47,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Great idea.

340
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:47,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the ferret?

341
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:48,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

342
00:23:48,242 --> 00:23:48,643
[SPEAKER_05]: We burned it.

343
00:23:49,003 --> 00:23:49,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

344
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:50,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

345
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:51,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting into a story here.

346
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:53,546
[SPEAKER_05]: This was huge news this week.

347
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:54,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Oblivion.

348
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:57,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this the sequel to Hot Coffee?

349
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:59,050
[SPEAKER_05]: This whole debacle going on on Oblivion.

350
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:09,098
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have probably read about this, but if you've been living in a cave or you just avoid Oblivion news for whatever reason, the ESRB changed the rating of the PC version of Oblivion from T...

351
00:24:09,818 --> 00:24:13,182
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

352
00:24:27,785 --> 00:24:31,228
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the boobies were never meant to be accessed.

353
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:34,290
[SPEAKER_05]: You were not allowed to have a topless character in Oblivion.

354
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:36,752
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no up, up, down, down, left, right.

355
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:39,074
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no code to get the boobies.

356
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:43,818
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to do a third-party outside hack to put the boobies on.

357
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:46,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of this third-party hack...

358
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:55,911
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been exposed that the boobs were on the disc the whole time, and therefore this game is not safe for children, and it's slapped with an M rating.

359
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:57,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my problem with this whole thing.

360
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:12,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, I mean, that's just like saying, if I took, let's say, Care Bearers the movie, and I spliced in porn in there, and put that ISO on the internet, would they have to re-rate that movie X because I spliced in porn?

361
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:14,976
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because the porn wasn't on the disc to begin with.

362
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:16,617
[SPEAKER_05]: That, I believe, is the whole thing.

363
00:25:17,205 --> 00:25:21,347
[SPEAKER_00]: What about then in the case of The Rescuers with the sliced in nudie photo?

364
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:23,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

365
00:25:23,408 --> 00:25:34,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was done at the animation studio and has been on every subsequent release except for the modern ones after these, you know, uptight anal retentive right-wing people decided to watch every frame and pick out stuff in it.

366
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:37,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Or The Lion King where the stars spell out sex.

367
00:25:37,796 --> 00:25:37,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

368
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:41,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Or in Aladdin where if you listen real carefully it goes, take your clothes off.

369
00:25:41,437 --> 00:25:45,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that was deemed to be fake and I found that out at Snopes.com, your website of the week.

370
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:45,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Snopes.

371
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,120
[SPEAKER_05]: However...

372
00:25:47,077 --> 00:25:49,500
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still, I mean, it looks like those stars do say sex.

373
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you look at it real carefully.

374
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:53,944
[SPEAKER_00]: You know Ronald McDonald's hair, it says hot, yummy, good.

375
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:54,785
[SPEAKER_00]: It's serious.

376
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:57,528
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's a very good, you know what though, that's a very good point.

377
00:25:57,568 --> 00:26:01,972
[SPEAKER_05]: The Rescuers wasn't made an R movie because, you know, it had that one frame of boobies in it.

378
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:06,176
[SPEAKER_05]: But yet the games are, you know, damned for this.

379
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:09,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing is, this is how I see it, you know.

380
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:11,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloody Roar 3

381
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:51,125
[SPEAKER_00]: had, if you use a cheat, a cheat whatever, you can pull up pictures that the game programmers did in of the characters in compromising positions.

382
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:54,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, naked and doing stuff.

383
00:26:54,127 --> 00:26:56,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they really tried to sell that game despite the fact that it sucked.

384
00:26:57,108 --> 00:27:03,133
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people are saying that this is nothing like hot coffee, but I say this is exactly like hot coffee.

385
00:27:03,153 --> 00:27:03,633
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why?

386
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:06,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that sex game was never meant to be found either.

387
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:12,581
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on the disc, but I say it's the exact same thing that's happening between the two games.

388
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:18,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Oblivion, the creators probably planned for there to be a topless character.

389
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:18,945
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, why not?

390
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:22,067
[SPEAKER_05]: If the game's violent, why not throw in a little nudity as well?

391
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:27,291
[SPEAKER_05]: However, at some point during the beta or even the alpha testing, they decided, you know what?

392
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:27,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad idea.

393
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:30,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just take the pointer out to the textures.

394
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:34,256
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easier to take the pointer out than to redo everything on the disc.

395
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always said that's the exact same thing that happened with Hot Coffee.

396
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:43,049
[SPEAKER_03]: The way they do clothing nowadays, it's just an actual object on top of an object.

397
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:48,515
[SPEAKER_03]: So the textures are always there, it's just they're covered up by a clothing object.

398
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:52,019
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just remove that clothing object, and there you go.

399
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so irritated.

400
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:55,363
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get pissed off about it with The Sims.

401
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:58,066
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

402
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Take Two Presents, or Rockstar Presents Table Tennis.

403
00:28:22,342 --> 00:28:25,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I blame all of those sexually repressed anal retentive people.

404
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:27,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get into the follow-ups.

405
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, Bethesda Responds.

406
00:28:29,265 --> 00:28:46,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they respond, basically insist that a full and accurate comprehensive report of Oblivion's content was submitted to the ESRB before the game's release that included a 60-page document that detailed all explicit language, accents, scenes in the game.

407
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,940
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

408
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:18,383
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, of course this news comes out.

409
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what do they do?

410
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:30,814
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, freaking California Assemblyman Leland Yee issued a press release calling on Take-Two and the ESRB to stop deceiving parents.

411
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:41,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, and I quote, The ESRB again has failed our parents and it's clearly shown that they cannot police themselves.

412
00:29:41,772 --> 00:29:51,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Plain and simple, the current rating system is drastically flawed and here is yet another reason why we need legislation to assist parents and protect children.

413
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, somebody didn't do their research at all before coming out and sounding like a complete jackass.

414
00:29:58,784 --> 00:30:00,225
[SPEAKER_03]: So, excellent.

415
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:06,769
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, he was also one of the politicians to pick up on the hot coffee scandal.

416
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments from chat room.

417
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:10,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

418
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:15,824
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf says, no, it was actually the way they did their 3D models.

419
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:21,145
[SPEAKER_05]: The bra object was on top of the nudie object and you could not remove the bra object without a mod.

420
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:24,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess the boobs were just there to make it more realistic.

421
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:29,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, okay, so whatever, it was for a more complex reason.

422
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:32,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, the boobies were not meant to be seen by themselves.

423
00:30:32,508 --> 00:30:35,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so like what if you have a movie and you have someone walk around in their undies?

424
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:38,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they could have that edited off.

425
00:30:39,363 --> 00:30:40,023
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

426
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:41,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Digital editing.

427
00:30:41,284 --> 00:30:42,866
[SPEAKER_05]: We could go back, you know, that scene with Tom Cruise.

428
00:30:42,886 --> 00:30:45,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Deleted scenes, pull off the, you know, stuff.

429
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:47,509
[SPEAKER_05]: That scene with Tom Cruise from Risky Business.

430
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:50,551
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we could just edit, digitally edit in a schlong, floppy floppy.

431
00:30:51,092 --> 00:30:52,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that going to get the movie re-rated NC-17?

432
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:55,315
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes a lot of fangirls, I think.

433
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:56,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what was that movie?

434
00:30:57,296 --> 00:31:19,962
[SPEAKER_05]: where if you freeze frame it at just the right point you can see his schlong and that happens in movies all the time where like you know you might see a titty or you might see a schlong if you pause it at just the right moment there's several movies that are like that exactly or you know like in Austin Powers there's a scene where with what's her name Elizabeth Hurley where he moves like the piece of fruit at just the wrong time and you can see the red tape over her

435
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:23,130
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually was pointed out to me, by the way.

436
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:26,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Arsef in the chatroom says, Leland Yee is a respectable man, I suppose.

437
00:31:26,994 --> 00:31:30,557
[SPEAKER_05]: He just needs to learn what the hell he's talking about before he blasts video games, it seems.

438
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:37,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree 100% with that statement applied to about 99% of politicians out there right now.

439
00:31:37,704 --> 00:31:39,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter.

440
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:41,247
[SPEAKER_05]: They all need to do their research on this subject.

441
00:31:41,547 --> 00:31:41,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

442
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:44,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind them coming after if an actual...

443
00:31:45,171 --> 00:32:06,104
[SPEAKER_03]: company out there, like, say, for example, we were to find out tomorrow that EA, you know, with Sims 2, purposefully left in, you know, nudity and, say, there's child sex in the game or something like that, you know, then, yes, then they need to come after them and say, okay, you need to re-rate this and you probably need to remove this content.

444
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:14,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, you know, if this wasn't meant to be in the game and someone added it in with a third-party, you know, patch or hack,

445
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,458
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a little different.

446
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,792
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to do their research.

447
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:22,333
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, the gaming community is getting a little ticked off, too.

448
00:32:22,894 --> 00:32:24,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Specifically, we have John Romero.

449
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:27,557
[SPEAKER_05]: You know him as one of the co-founders of ID Software.

450
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:36,063
[SPEAKER_05]: He went off on his blog about this whole re-rating fiasco, and he was saying modders are not screwing up the industry.

451
00:32:36,103 --> 00:32:37,404
[SPEAKER_05]: They're supposed to be helping.

452
00:32:39,245 --> 00:32:47,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically just saying that he fears that developers are going to have to basically make their games tougher to hack to avoid these re-rating incidents in the future.

453
00:32:48,658 --> 00:32:51,360
[SPEAKER_05]: So, he's kind of... Oh, I'm sorry.

454
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I say modders or not?

455
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:55,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Modders are now screwing up the industry that they're supposed to be helping.

456
00:32:55,764 --> 00:32:57,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought when I read that, it sounded a little different when I first read that.

457
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:00,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, modders are now screwing up the industry they're supposed to be helping.

458
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:04,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know... They've been doing this crap for years, though.

459
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:04,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

460
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:14,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, there's actually... There was a Game Boy hack rom for the Legend of Zelda game that was on that where Link looked like a little troll and was carrying around a giant...

461
00:33:15,174 --> 00:33:15,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Penis.

462
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:16,637
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's interesting?

463
00:33:16,677 --> 00:33:19,823
[SPEAKER_05]: What was one of the first games that everybody and their mom was hacking?

464
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:20,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Doom?

465
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:21,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

466
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:25,273
[SPEAKER_00]: There were even games that were released, though, that were like that.

467
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:27,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they weren't usually sanctioned, but hey.

468
00:33:30,097 --> 00:33:32,239
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what pisses me off most about this?

469
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:34,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I'm getting a little political here, but I don't care.

470
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:38,325
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the big deal about a couple of boobs?

471
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:39,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

472
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:43,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Oblivion is a really violent game.

473
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there's a lot.

474
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:45,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even have to pick on Oblivion.

475
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:48,195
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of very, very violent video games out there.

476
00:33:48,756 --> 00:33:51,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet it takes a set of boobs to get your game rated M?

477
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:52,760
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a theory.

478
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get this at all.

479
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:56,726
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just my rant on society.

480
00:33:57,487 --> 00:34:00,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I may not be a father yet, but someday I hope to.

481
00:34:00,511 --> 00:34:05,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that one of the ways I plan to raise my kid is that I would...

482
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,260
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

483
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:40,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind also, you know, from the average child perspective, the thing that you cannot do becomes all the more attractive, you know?

484
00:34:42,384 --> 00:35:11,222
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that they either you know with this type of environment with that much repression of what they see they're either going to grow up to be really fucked up in the head is what I think you know not knowing the right way to do things not knowing the reality because there was as an example one of my friends her best friend growing up was not allowed to watch the news was not allowed to watch violent movies was not allowed to watch anything that wasn't G-rated when she graduated high school she had no idea how the world worked

485
00:35:12,697 --> 00:35:17,139
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't learn anything from her friends because she grew up in such a sheltered environment.

486
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:19,540
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't allowed to go out or anything.

487
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,082
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's interesting, too, and I promise we'll get back on games in a minute here, but you notice in movies... Okay, go ahead.

488
00:35:25,442 --> 00:35:31,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just my example on this is that she thought that oral sex was just talking about it.

489
00:35:33,453 --> 00:35:34,093
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm serious.

490
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:36,454
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's an example.

491
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:36,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it.

492
00:35:36,874 --> 00:35:48,739
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm afraid that if things like this are allowed to happen, we're going to see more kids growing up without having any type of concept of what the world is like or how to interact or anything like that.

493
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:54,021
[SPEAKER_05]: You ever notice this about violent movies, that in violent movies, a lot of times the person causing the violence is the hero?

494
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:58,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you look at The Terminator, an incredibly violent movie, but you cheer on Arnold.

495
00:35:58,182 --> 00:36:00,403
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, yeah, kick some ass, blow those guys up.

496
00:36:00,663 --> 00:36:01,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

497
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:23,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really thinking that we've got this sort of vicious cycle going on.

498
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, okay, think about it.

499
00:36:25,408 --> 00:36:25,789
[SPEAKER_05]: The more...

500
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,302
[SPEAKER_00]: The government steps in.

501
00:36:39,223 --> 00:36:43,827
[SPEAKER_00]: This has actually been something that's happened, I'd say, since the late 80s, that we've seen the government stepping in.

502
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:51,916
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring this up as a point, and it also is more jackass involved in it, but the whole cop killer thing, remember that?

503
00:36:52,536 --> 00:36:55,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, he was also the one responsible for the whole Two Life crew business.

504
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that?

505
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:04,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind that since we've had this cycle of going through, of having the government step in and try to say, hey, you know, you can't do that.

506
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:05,327
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bad.

507
00:37:05,387 --> 00:37:09,111
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen an increase in this type of game or this type of movie.

508
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:13,354
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen people want more and more the more that other people say you can't have it.

509
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:19,760
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and again, it is like Sakurina said, the forbidden fruit syndrome.

510
00:37:20,347 --> 00:37:21,287
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fully what it is.

511
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:22,768
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that stays with you.

512
00:37:23,388 --> 00:37:25,669
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you can't have something, the more you want it.

513
00:37:25,729 --> 00:37:27,070
[SPEAKER_00]: The demand keeps growing.

514
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:34,713
[SPEAKER_05]: This didn't make the show roll for tonight, but it just makes me think as well that I heard about there was some sex game that got banned from E3.

515
00:37:34,913 --> 00:37:40,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I don't have the story in front of me, but E3 said that some game couldn't be exhibited on the floor because it's mostly about sex.

516
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:40,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Three Fields?

517
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:43,772
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't that.

518
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:48,556
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the lady that's very well known for her sex in the games.

519
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:54,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure somebody in chat room is going to yell it out momentarily here, but they were banned from the E3 floor, and I'm thinking... Why?

520
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:55,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

521
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:57,143
[SPEAKER_00]: No one under 18 is allowed anyway.

522
00:37:57,163 --> 00:37:57,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

523
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they are, we freaking need to get them kicked out.

524
00:38:00,826 --> 00:38:03,248
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I don't get about the whole booth baby thing either.

525
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:03,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Naughty America.

526
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:05,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Naughty America.

527
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,471
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I knew they'd yell it out.

528
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:06,891
[SPEAKER_00]: But...

529
00:38:07,901 --> 00:38:16,726
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that it's very sad, you know, and we're really one of the few countries that are really focused on such, you know, repression.

530
00:38:16,766 --> 00:38:17,686
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really is.

531
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:19,907
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a repressed society.

532
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:23,329
[SPEAKER_00]: There are way too many people in power who are not getting the nookie or something.

533
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they're getting it, it's all dry and stale.

534
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,631
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

535
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,952
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a worldwide audience, though.

536
00:38:29,012 --> 00:38:31,953
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, some folks are probably listening to us bitching going, you know.

537
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:32,974
[SPEAKER_00]: We should start our own country.

538
00:38:34,764 --> 00:38:36,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we just need more political parties in this country.

539
00:38:36,805 --> 00:38:39,645
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've got plenty of political parties.

540
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:44,306
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole issue, and I'm not meaning to get into a political rant, but you all know how I feel on this.

541
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:50,588
[SPEAKER_00]: We have too many people who are not willing to move away from this bipartisan bullshit that we've got.

542
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:51,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon me.

543
00:38:52,648 --> 00:38:53,649
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I feel about it.

544
00:38:53,669 --> 00:38:54,989
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel very strongly about this.

545
00:38:57,089 --> 00:39:03,811
[SPEAKER_00]: There are too many people who, when they vote for a certain politician, say for the presidential election, they vote straight ticket.

546
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:05,953
[SPEAKER_00]: because they haven't taken the time to research.

547
00:39:06,354 --> 00:39:09,256
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not realize that they are the ones who have fucked this up for themselves.

548
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:10,497
[SPEAKER_00]: It is their fault.

549
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:14,141
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary voters in this country, it is your fault.

550
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:15,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Educate yourself.

551
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:16,603
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious.

552
00:39:17,162 --> 00:39:19,483
[SPEAKER_05]: You can send those cards and letters to mailbag at orangehoundsradio.com.

553
00:39:19,663 --> 00:39:20,784
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made no secret of this.

554
00:39:21,064 --> 00:39:34,431
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's because the people of this country keep putting these type of people in power that we see... I think that the majority of people enjoy being repressed and uninformed.

555
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:43,236
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they like being ignorant because usually when you find out something... A friend of mine has a quote that says, the truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off.

556
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting comment from the chat room.

557
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Blaze says, Japan is much more open about sex and their rape rate is like less than 1% of all people.

558
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:54,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where that quote is from, but it's an interesting comment.

559
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:59,264
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually have a thing going on with a lot of wives while their husbands are out on business trips.

560
00:39:59,304 --> 00:40:00,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually a business arrangement.

561
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:03,565
[SPEAKER_00]: They will basically sell their services.

562
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:05,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

563
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:17,030
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common for a man to have a mistress and have his wife because his mistress will be the one to engage him socially, whereas the wife will be the one to take care of the house and raise the kids and be the goddess of her domain.

564
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:20,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And how does this tie into a boobies and oblivion again?

565
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we got off subject.

566
00:40:22,873 --> 00:40:30,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the whole thing that it is these closed-minded, ignorant people who are...

567
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:35,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through and wanting this type of thing taken out from mainstream availability.

568
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:37,213
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need more of it, honestly.

569
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:41,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if more people are seeing the boobies, they won't go out raping people.

570
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:43,267
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

571
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:06,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I like violence!

572
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:10,426
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like this game very much because first person shooters make me nauseous.

573
00:41:10,906 --> 00:41:11,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally.

574
00:41:11,766 --> 00:41:14,627
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lot of people who are into these types of games.

575
00:41:15,427 --> 00:41:20,068
[SPEAKER_00]: The next Call of Duty game is not going to be out on the PC.

576
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:27,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Activision is basically stating and I quote, it's not a PC product it's a console product and it's all next gen.

577
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:31,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean that there's not going to be any more on the PC.

578
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,430
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we did see

579
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:55,554
[SPEAKER_00]: um other versions released on a PS2, Xbox, GameCube, Xbox 360 um but they are going to stick it so far strictly to the next-gen consoles um there was also a question going about if um Infinity Ward's doing this year's a console title themselves um for Call of Duty um and uh

580
00:41:58,084 --> 00:42:01,407
[SPEAKER_00]: That has actually been seen to be left unanswered so far.

581
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:04,711
[SPEAKER_00]: They also released the big red one last year.

582
00:42:07,894 --> 00:42:09,376
[SPEAKER_00]: But no Call of Duty on your PC.

583
00:42:10,837 --> 00:42:13,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a lot of PC gamers out there who are very sad at that, but

584
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, you know, it looks like developers, a lot of them are focusing their attention on console games.

585
00:42:19,772 --> 00:42:21,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, PC games, just kind of a different market.

586
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:23,734
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a different type of game that's successful there.

587
00:42:24,114 --> 00:42:31,617
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually, though, a really good first-person shooter making it out onto the Xbox 360.

588
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:32,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Fear.

589
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:34,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I heard about that.

590
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:37,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually found that out from my husband today.

591
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,481
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's pretty excited about that.

592
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:41,722
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually going to be a good first-person shooter.

593
00:42:42,242 --> 00:42:42,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

594
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:48,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we had a rumor last week about this, but we got confirmation.

595
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:48,781
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?

596
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:51,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's sort of confirmation.

597
00:42:51,742 --> 00:43:02,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, according to an EB Games employee, Nintendo has sent posters including a blank GameCube-branded new low-price sticker.

598
00:43:02,607 --> 00:43:04,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, they're getting the POP now.

599
00:43:05,075 --> 00:43:06,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is Tuesday, right?

600
00:43:06,056 --> 00:43:07,037
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

601
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:34,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

602
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:38,449
[SPEAKER_05]: With all the Wii excitement, I guess GameCube will just be kind of a budget thing.

603
00:43:38,469 --> 00:43:40,192
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, let's get the kids one for their room.

604
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:41,313
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the 64 is.

605
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,216
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they still have Nintendo 64 at McDonald's, some of them.

606
00:43:47,236 --> 00:43:54,258
[SPEAKER_05]: They still advertise them on little... Like when I was in LA, I drove by a McDonald's that actually still was advertising the Nintendo 64 on one of their things.

607
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was very interesting.

608
00:43:55,418 --> 00:43:56,498
[SPEAKER_00]: That is hilarious.

609
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:00,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Which might explain why you don't see Los Angeles on this list.

610
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

611
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,741
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the top video game cities in America.

612
00:44:05,221 --> 00:44:10,142
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a survey commissioned by Sperling for Best Places and Microsoft.

613
00:44:10,622 --> 00:44:12,643
[SPEAKER_05]: It rated Seattle, Washington...

614
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:15,465
[SPEAKER_05]: as the top video game city in America

615
00:44:29,662 --> 00:44:34,166
[SPEAKER_05]: The other top ten, number ten, Philadelphia, number nine, San Diego, number eight, Boston, number seven, St.

616
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:34,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Louis.

617
00:44:52,003 --> 00:44:53,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 6, Washington, D.C.

618
00:44:53,884 --> 00:45:00,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 5, Phoenix, Mesa Number 4, Detroit Number 3, Hotlanta Number 2, Minneapolis, St.

619
00:45:00,226 --> 00:45:20,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul And number 1, of course, Seattle Our close-by neighbor, San Francisco, is number 14 But here in Sacramento, we don't make the cut That's because they didn't interview me and Dan Neither does Los Angeles, which I find very interesting Los Angeles does not make the cut as well I wonder if it would have tilted it in Sacramento's favor If they had actually interviewed me and Dan That would have been hilarious

620
00:45:22,605 --> 00:45:23,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows, who knows.

621
00:45:23,726 --> 00:45:29,950
[SPEAKER_05]: But see, for every you and Dan, there's 100,000 people that don't own any systems, so you just have to remember.

622
00:45:32,172 --> 00:45:33,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting comment from the chatroom there.

623
00:45:33,553 --> 00:45:38,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Funnydale says, Seattle is number one only because everyone has to stay inside because it always rains.

624
00:45:39,617 --> 00:45:39,838
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

625
00:45:40,378 --> 00:45:40,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting point.

626
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,041
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have the highest precipitation rate in the country.

627
00:45:44,481 --> 00:45:46,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It does have a pretty high suicide rate, too.

628
00:45:47,423 --> 00:45:47,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

629
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:48,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

630
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:50,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to make it morbid.

631
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:55,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's going to tell us about a nice, fun, happy game to take our minds off of that.

632
00:45:56,134 --> 00:45:56,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

633
00:45:57,594 --> 00:46:01,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot Pixel is a new game by Atari for the PSP.

634
00:46:01,576 --> 00:46:02,996
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be just like WarioWare.

635
00:46:03,016 --> 00:46:06,018
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to feature hundreds of tiny five-second games.

636
00:46:06,478 --> 00:46:10,079
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have pictures of this on our E3 on the PSP website, by the way.

637
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks pretty cool.

638
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,001
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just lots of weird stuff.

639
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:18,143
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all going to have kind of an urban spin on it.

640
00:46:18,283 --> 00:46:19,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to have a lot of

641
00:46:20,149 --> 00:46:21,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital Street Culture

642
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:41,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be another minigame type of thing, also for the PSP.

643
00:46:42,483 --> 00:46:43,804
[SPEAKER_03]: That one should be pretty interesting too.

644
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:45,245
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm looking forward to checking this out.

645
00:46:45,265 --> 00:46:49,488
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have this actually at E3, I believe, and it's due out this fall.

646
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:50,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I like this.

647
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:57,375
[SPEAKER_05]: In our chatroom, DJ Janai says, will they make it, since this is on the PSP, will they make a game called Dead Pixel?

648
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:58,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

649
00:46:59,397 --> 00:47:00,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Because PSP has had the Dead Pixels?

650
00:47:01,879 --> 00:47:02,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

651
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:02,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Winner.

652
00:47:03,479 --> 00:47:05,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Comedy in Orange Lounge chat.

653
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:06,322
[SPEAKER_05]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

654
00:47:06,342 --> 00:47:08,244
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if that should go in the toilet paper joke book.

655
00:47:09,724 --> 00:47:13,065
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're also going to find some comedy in our mailbag right now.

656
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:15,706
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I don't know if there's any funny stuff in there, but we'll soon find out.

657
00:47:16,246 --> 00:47:26,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura picks out her favorites and brings them to us here on Orange Lounge Radio Live each and every week.

658
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:31,272
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's actually been a little while since we've dived into the mailbag, so we're going to go in there right now.

659
00:47:32,152 --> 00:47:34,213
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, put on your rubber gloves.

660
00:47:35,093 --> 00:47:35,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Dig in there.

661
00:47:35,674 --> 00:47:36,614
[SPEAKER_00]: I need asbestos this time.

662
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:37,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Pull something out.

663
00:47:38,715 --> 00:47:38,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Ew!

664
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:45,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Mailbag at OrangeOnlineRadio.com We actually got a really cool email from Zohar, who is one of our Serbian listeners.

665
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:55,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to a little bit of silliness that we had last week regarding ActionScript.org Yeah, weren't we talking about the different translations over there?

666
00:47:55,263 --> 00:47:57,445
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a Serbian translation available, which I was like...

667
00:47:58,683 --> 00:47:58,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

668
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:03,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we made an offhanded comment that like, you know, if you need that.

669
00:48:03,386 --> 00:48:08,889
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was cool, but it struck me as very strange because it's the only technical site I've seen with Serbian translation on it.

670
00:48:09,129 --> 00:48:11,930
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was cool, but I was like, that's so random.

671
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,591
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was how I thought.

672
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:16,913
[SPEAKER_05]: So hope we didn't offend any of our Serbian listeners.

673
00:48:16,953 --> 00:48:18,194
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just kind of surprised.

674
00:48:18,274 --> 00:48:20,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually, you know, Spanish, not so surprising when you're here.

675
00:48:21,555 --> 00:48:24,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Russian, Japanese, you know, Serbian?

676
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:25,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so common.

677
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:31,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most of the time, if there's going to be a site like that, it's either going to already be strictly for that region.

678
00:48:32,766 --> 00:48:38,110
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to read this email, speaking of actionscript.org being in Serbian, I wanted to mention that I am a Serbian listener.

679
00:48:38,551 --> 00:48:42,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say that you guys probably have a lot of listeners in many different races from many different countries.

680
00:48:43,455 --> 00:48:46,697
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how many Serbian listeners you have, but I just wanted to say that I am one of them.

681
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:49,359
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that one day everybody in the world will be listening to OLR.

682
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, that's cute.

683
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,361
[SPEAKER_05]: That was very sweet.

684
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:51,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad...

685
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,729
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not upset over the comment because we didn't mean it offensively.

686
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:57,490
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we certainly didn't mean it that way.

687
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:59,812
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just random.

688
00:49:00,632 --> 00:49:02,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an email.

689
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:07,337
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a response to an email complaining about the Wii.

690
00:49:07,837 --> 00:49:09,298
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what children call urine.

691
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:11,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go again.

692
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:19,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give this author the benefit of the doubt that the email was written like one or two days after the announcement when those jokes weren't old yet.

693
00:49:19,285 --> 00:49:20,426
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sent by BearWhoDriveCar.

694
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,101
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

695
00:49:35,925 --> 00:49:37,987
[SPEAKER_00]: console names in video game history.

696
00:49:38,388 --> 00:49:39,589
[SPEAKER_00]: My vote, Dreamcast best.

697
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:46,936
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had actually replied saying my personal favorite system name is probably Dreamcast as well, although I like PC Engine Duo.

698
00:49:46,996 --> 00:49:47,536
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sounds cool.

699
00:49:47,556 --> 00:49:48,577
[SPEAKER_00]: It rolls off the tongue, you know.

700
00:49:49,078 --> 00:49:52,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst ever, Fairchild Channel F, which is also a horrible system.

701
00:49:53,182 --> 00:49:54,703
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Pico, which makes me think of Salsa.

702
00:49:54,964 --> 00:49:55,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

703
00:49:57,042 --> 00:50:10,599
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I got a response back it says also I have not heard one female call into your show nor one female guest come on the show since you started taking calls and doing interviews being the only vocal female representation that OLR at least in podcast form presents

704
00:50:11,332 --> 00:50:15,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel an increased sense of responsibility, DarkSakura, in being the honorary estrogen ambassador?

705
00:50:16,034 --> 00:50:16,614
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.

706
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:18,455
[SPEAKER_05]: The estrogen ambassador?

707
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:24,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the awareness of this problem will motivate you to include a segment to promote female awareness on your fine program.

708
00:50:24,437 --> 00:50:28,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys have discussed the problems and stereotypes that male gamers have toward female gamers.

709
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:29,879
[SPEAKER_00]: I say the power is yours.

710
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've actually been sort of working on something like that.

711
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Just school's kicking my ass.

712
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:34,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

713
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:36,923
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had Roz called in just a couple weeks ago, didn't we?

714
00:50:37,163 --> 00:50:37,704
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had Roz.

715
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:39,205
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had Mistress Tia.

716
00:50:39,445 --> 00:50:40,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Mistress Tia.

717
00:50:40,105 --> 00:50:41,606
[SPEAKER_00]: She's not necessarily a gamer.

718
00:50:41,707 --> 00:50:42,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

719
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:44,288
[SPEAKER_00]: But she definitely has estrogen.

720
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:51,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the girls were on the program before we switched over to this new format where our live show is being podcast.

721
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:54,816
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we were doing the podcast for the first year, we never had special guests.

722
00:50:55,817 --> 00:50:57,638
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had DDR Angel.

723
00:50:57,758 --> 00:51:00,801
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Iguana Girl, Mistress Tia.

724
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:02,442
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just been a while.

725
00:51:03,282 --> 00:51:06,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to kidnap a few more of my female... We've had Julie.

726
00:51:07,385 --> 00:51:07,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

727
00:51:08,006 --> 00:51:09,387
[SPEAKER_05]: But get Iguana Girl on the show.

728
00:51:09,807 --> 00:51:11,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know she's a gamer too.

729
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:12,048
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know she's been busy.

730
00:51:12,168 --> 00:51:16,772
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also... Well, she didn't come on the show because it was my birthday thing the other week.

731
00:51:17,152 --> 00:51:21,255
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll have to bring my good friend Disney Punk 10 up here.

732
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:21,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

733
00:51:21,935 --> 00:51:25,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she's into Kingdom Hearts and a lot of the same games that I do.

734
00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:28,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Best console name and worst console name?

735
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I have answers, I think.

736
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:36,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Best console name, you know, I know you might find this a little silly, but I actually really like the name Jaguar for a system.

737
00:51:36,825 --> 00:51:37,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was kind of cool.

738
00:51:37,786 --> 00:51:38,427
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of cool.

739
00:51:38,547 --> 00:51:40,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though the system itself kind of stuck.

740
00:51:40,628 --> 00:51:42,429
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have the best version of Tempest.

741
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst console name, Philips CDI.

742
00:51:45,251 --> 00:51:46,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that doesn't tell me anything.

743
00:51:46,532 --> 00:51:47,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's not very imaginative.

744
00:51:47,473 --> 00:51:48,353
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't tell me anything.

745
00:51:48,574 --> 00:51:49,694
[SPEAKER_00]: It plays CDs.

746
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:52,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you want to add to that?

747
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:54,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, because the Fairchild Channel left.

748
00:51:54,807 --> 00:51:57,889
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, why am I going to play a channel something?

749
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:01,972
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also just a really piece of shit system.

750
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another one I thought had a really good name, though, was The Odyssey 2.

751
00:52:05,835 --> 00:52:08,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like, ooh, it's a gaming journey.

752
00:52:09,137 --> 00:52:11,699
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1978, when I was two years old.

753
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:12,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the math, kids.

754
00:52:16,202 --> 00:52:16,582
[SPEAKER_05]: More mail.

755
00:52:16,863 --> 00:52:17,223
[SPEAKER_00]: More mail.

756
00:52:18,043 --> 00:52:18,524
[SPEAKER_00]: I like mail.

757
00:52:19,244 --> 00:52:20,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like mail.

758
00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:33,988
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an email from Rob, who sends a link found on Dig, which I am going to open at this time because I sort of didn't.

759
00:52:34,509 --> 00:52:37,951
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the unluckiest Xbox 360 owner.

760
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:39,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God, I heard about this guy.

761
00:52:40,629 --> 00:52:45,432
[SPEAKER_00]: who apparently has kept getting a broken system.

762
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,094
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's name is Chris Zarek.

763
00:52:50,396 --> 00:52:58,001
[SPEAKER_00]: He purchased... He's actually on his fourth Xbox 360 because of quality issues with earlier machines.

764
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:05,527
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a... Actually, it's something very interesting that was...

765
00:53:07,004 --> 00:53:09,125
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice summary that was posted by Rob in this email.

766
00:53:09,445 --> 00:53:14,328
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, number one, 5% customer failure, dissatisfaction rate.

767
00:53:14,908 --> 00:53:16,089
[SPEAKER_00]: One bad system, one in 20.

768
00:53:16,169 --> 00:53:17,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Two bad systems, one in 400.

769
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:19,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Three systems, one in 8,000.

770
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:24,953
[SPEAKER_00]: To get three in a row that had faulty issues with it?

771
00:53:26,326 --> 00:53:28,107
[SPEAKER_03]: God, and I was pissed when I got the one.

772
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you either have to be, you know, really lucky or a really big liar.

773
00:53:32,288 --> 00:53:33,609
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the blinking red lights.

774
00:53:33,649 --> 00:53:34,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Go buy a lottery ticket, dude.

775
00:53:34,969 --> 00:53:36,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm calling bullshit on this story.

776
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's a fucking liar.

777
00:53:38,411 --> 00:53:38,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

778
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:42,672
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're sitting with him with the last Xbox and the games.

779
00:53:42,772 --> 00:53:47,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he took all the worst possible case scenarios and just made up a damn story about it.

780
00:53:47,534 --> 00:53:52,896
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I'm seeing on here, I think every one of them had the blinking red light issue where it wouldn't turn on.

781
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:53,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

782
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:53,981
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

783
00:54:24,788 --> 00:54:37,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there was an article that he also sent me from Slashdot about what your next generation system preference says about you.

784
00:54:39,316 --> 00:54:40,216
[SPEAKER_05]: What if I want it all?

785
00:54:40,256 --> 00:54:41,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that just make me greedy?

786
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it makes you very greedy.

787
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,060
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm really greedy.

788
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:54,422
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study done with the IGN people that says 36% claim loyalty to the PlayStation 3, 28% to the Xbox 360, 22% are interested in the Wii.

789
00:54:55,122 --> 00:54:56,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Undecided gamers are a minority.

790
00:54:56,763 --> 00:54:58,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 4% have not decided.

791
00:54:59,483 --> 00:55:03,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also lifestyle decisions that are associated with that.

792
00:55:07,845 --> 00:55:09,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to go off this chart here.

793
00:55:10,726 --> 00:55:19,829
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who were undecided PS3 and 360, for their favorite handheld is the PSP.

794
00:55:20,509 --> 00:55:22,309
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who are buying the Wii, it's the DS.

795
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:32,212
[SPEAKER_05]: No shock there, because in order to have put down the Wii when we have not really seen the system at all in any way, you would have to be a Nintendo fanboy.

796
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:35,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what band do you enjoy most listening to?

797
00:55:35,093 --> 00:55:35,993
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part I like.

798
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:39,314
[SPEAKER_00]: The Undecided Group and the Wii Group both are Gorillaz fans.

799
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:44,832
[SPEAKER_00]: PS3 owners listen to Eminem and Xbox 360 owners listen to Nirvana.

800
00:55:47,354 --> 00:55:48,655
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite TV drama?

801
00:55:48,675 --> 00:55:52,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that means I ain't getting a PS3 because I'm not a big Eminem fan.

802
00:55:52,218 --> 00:55:53,098
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other two are fine.

803
00:55:53,118 --> 00:55:54,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But Eminem, I'm not a big fan of him.

804
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,600
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just statistical data.

805
00:55:56,221 --> 00:55:57,361
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite TV drama?

806
00:55:58,002 --> 00:56:00,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Undecided and Xbox 360 are like lost.

807
00:56:01,244 --> 00:56:02,485
[SPEAKER_00]: PS3 owners like 24.

808
00:56:03,246 --> 00:56:06,689
[SPEAKER_00]: And we potential owners are looking for Smallville.

809
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:10,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Smallville is actually decent.

810
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:14,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Some episodes are kind of crap, but Lex is cute.

811
00:56:15,633 --> 00:56:17,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I'm just shaking my head over here.

812
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm trying to read.

813
00:56:19,015 --> 00:56:20,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that whole WB thing.

814
00:56:21,977 --> 00:56:24,978
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions is, do you own a TiVo or digital video recorder?

815
00:56:24,998 --> 00:56:29,300
[SPEAKER_00]: 19% were in the Undecided group, 29% were in the PS3 group, 32% were in the Xbox 360 group, and the Wii group was 24.

816
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,161
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two more sections.

817
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:37,132
[SPEAKER_00]: have you been to the movies in the last 30 days?

818
00:56:37,212 --> 00:56:44,697
[SPEAKER_00]: the greatest group of these were the PS3 and Xbox 360 players at 64 and 61% respectively and the last is do you own an iPod?

819
00:56:45,178 --> 00:57:01,530
[SPEAKER_05]: and the majority of those were the Xbox 360 group minimum actually a tie between Undecided and PS3 I still think although it's interesting I call BS on this survey because it leaves no room for the people who are still on the fence and considering how little we know there was an Undecided group

820
00:57:02,615 --> 00:57:12,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Considering how little we know about PlayStation 3 and Wii, you're basically asking, whose fanboy are you?

821
00:57:12,279 --> 00:57:13,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo.

822
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,580
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you're asking.

823
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the only one of those systems you can really say you know something about is the 360.

824
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:23,724
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, the vast majority of people are still relatively uninformed.

825
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:27,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like...

826
00:57:28,786 --> 00:57:30,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going over to our chat room for a comment.

827
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:34,928
[SPEAKER_00]: TigerClaw wants to know, speaking of Smallville, have you guys seen the new Superman Returns trailer?

828
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:37,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I'm hoping that this guy doesn't die or break his neck or fall to the curse.

829
00:57:37,168 --> 00:57:37,388
[SPEAKER_00]: BILLIONS!

830
00:57:59,329 --> 00:57:59,589
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

831
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, LLR, love the show.

832
00:58:24,456 --> 00:58:25,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick question.

833
00:58:25,658 --> 00:58:29,605
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the store the other day and saw a network adapter for the Nintendo GameCube.

834
00:58:29,665 --> 00:58:30,727
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is this for?

835
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:32,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much.

836
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:33,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot.

837
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:36,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even a good paperweight because it doesn't weigh much.

838
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:42,536
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to play PSO on your GameCube, or not, yeah, PSO, I wanted to say PSU, but that's the new game.

839
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:46,059
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to play PSO on your GameCube, that's the reason to have one.

840
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:55,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, this will do nothing for you because Nintendo did not support internet gaming very well with the GameCube, and that's what I say killed them in the competition.

841
00:58:55,465 --> 00:59:00,708
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's very funny given that they had the Satellaview back in the day in Japan.

842
00:59:00,728 --> 00:59:00,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

843
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:03,489
[SPEAKER_05]: However, using PSO, you could browse the internet, right?

844
00:59:03,689 --> 00:59:04,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

845
00:59:04,449 --> 00:59:05,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I remember right?

846
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:11,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they had an actual browsing disk, though, for the GameCube.

847
00:59:11,952 --> 00:59:14,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of the other systems, they actually release browser disks.

848
00:59:14,193 --> 00:59:17,835
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, honestly, though, PSO on the GameCube is worthless.

849
00:59:17,995 --> 00:59:21,276
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox version is superior, mostly because of the voice chat.

850
00:59:22,136 --> 00:59:23,637
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other items in the GameCube one.

851
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Which are all on Blue Burst.

852
00:59:26,658 --> 00:59:29,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a big fan of the Nintendo version.

853
00:59:29,325 --> 00:59:32,633
[SPEAKER_05]: There's other things I like about the GameCube, don't get me wrong, but PSO's not one of them.

854
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:34,197
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have one more email.

855
00:59:34,497 --> 00:59:34,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

856
00:59:35,097 --> 00:59:39,458
[SPEAKER_00]: From, I guess it's Durley, is how it would be pronounced.

857
00:59:40,638 --> 00:59:41,679
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, love the show.

858
00:59:41,759 --> 00:59:44,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, a couple of shows back, you guys talked about a Silent Hill fan film.

859
00:59:45,439 --> 00:59:46,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Any idea where I can get that?

860
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:47,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Any help would be great.

861
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:51,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is a busy week, so just drop me a line later if you can.

862
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

863
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can find it on YouTube.

864
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:55,741
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find everything on YouTube.

865
00:59:56,461 --> 01:00:00,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can actually download the DVD-I, so from, I don't even remember the site now.

866
01:00:01,661 --> 01:00:05,624
[SPEAKER_03]: If you search for, was it Silent Hill No Escape?

867
01:00:06,004 --> 01:00:07,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you should be able to find it.

868
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:09,747
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty decently done.

869
01:00:09,927 --> 01:00:10,928
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was very neat.

870
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,450
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't want to bother with download, it's just on YouTube.

871
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,331
[SPEAKER_00]: It's broken up into like seven parts.

872
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:16,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

873
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:19,054
[SPEAKER_00]: And watch the dog ending.

874
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:20,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

875
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:24,538
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangetonetrader.com Do it!

876
01:00:26,567 --> 01:00:30,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, Nintendo, big conference this week.

877
01:00:31,029 --> 01:00:33,210
[SPEAKER_03]: People are eagerly anticipating what they're going to say.

878
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:43,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and if you can't make the conference, like us, you can watch it at the official World Store.

879
01:00:44,356 --> 01:00:46,197
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually going to be streaming it.

880
01:00:46,838 --> 01:00:50,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting at 12.30 Eastern to visitors who come in.

881
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Space is limited, of course, so first come, first serve.

882
01:00:54,562 --> 01:01:04,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, of course, you can view it streaming on practically every other gaming site out there, including if you're in the area, you can watch at the E3 Outpost.

883
01:01:05,887 --> 01:01:06,447
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out.

884
01:01:07,253 --> 01:01:07,493
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

885
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:13,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I believe Scott over at All Games is doing something with GameTrailers.com with the Nintendo press conference.

886
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:15,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're streaming a game trailer.

887
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is interesting because that means that, like, you know, tons of people are streaming this Nintendo conference.

888
01:01:20,284 --> 01:01:23,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to, you know, it goes to show how immediate...

889
01:01:24,387 --> 01:01:28,210
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people want their news now with this Wii stuff, so this is interesting.

890
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:28,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

891
01:01:29,591 --> 01:01:30,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be watching.

892
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:40,740
[SPEAKER_05]: If they have it on a big screen at Outpost, which I'm told they're going to, I will be there with my butt parked in the front row couch ready to see this conference, so I'm very excited.

893
01:01:40,981 --> 01:01:42,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we're not good enough to get one of the magic tickets.

894
01:01:42,982 --> 01:01:43,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I got nothing else to do.

895
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:53,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to grab McD's, grab some really fatty, something with bacon and eggs, and sit down and watch HDTV in a press conference.

896
01:01:53,491 --> 01:01:53,751
[SPEAKER_03]: That's

[SPEAKER_05]: How I want to spend my week So come down to E3 Outpost and be lazy and fat with us It'll be fun

898
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:03,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a craving for this McDonald's burger.

899
01:02:03,494 --> 01:02:04,234
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

900
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:04,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I want bacon!

[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, speaking of lazy and fat, we have a special guest joining us.

01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:12,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to Miklatov.

904
01:02:12,218 --> 01:02:12,939
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:13,299
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

906
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:14,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

907
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:14,960
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a jerk.

908
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,021
[SPEAKER_05]: He's neither lazy nor fat.

909
01:02:17,141 --> 01:02:18,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hair is gone.

910
01:02:18,342 --> 01:02:19,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks like a monkey.

911
01:02:19,782 --> 01:02:21,243
[SPEAKER_05]: You do look like a monkey.

912
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:21,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

913
01:02:21,884 --> 01:02:24,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Miklatov got all his hair cut off today.

914
01:02:24,565 --> 01:02:25,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we call you Son Goku now?

915
01:02:26,206 --> 01:02:26,506
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

916
01:02:26,606 --> 01:02:27,146
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that sounds stupid.

917
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:28,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was the Monkey King.

918
01:02:28,707 --> 01:02:30,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be a king of monkeys.

919
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:32,451
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't look that much like a monkey.

920
01:02:32,511 --> 01:02:33,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I like your hair short though.

921
01:02:33,452 --> 01:02:35,674
[SPEAKER_00]: So Loki doesn't want to be a duck and you don't want to be a monkey.

922
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like your hair long because it made you look like a wet dog.

923
01:02:38,778 --> 01:02:40,199
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that it was cute long.

924
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a fan of long hair.

925
01:02:43,242 --> 01:02:43,943
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it too.

926
01:02:43,983 --> 01:02:45,805
[SPEAKER_04]: It was floppy in a cute way.

927
01:02:46,185 --> 01:02:46,726
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that word?

928
01:02:46,746 --> 01:02:47,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Magical.

929
01:02:47,487 --> 01:02:48,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that thing.

930
01:02:48,127 --> 01:02:48,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say it.

931
01:02:49,093 --> 01:02:50,034
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Detangler's for.

932
01:02:50,194 --> 01:02:54,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quickly, before we get back in the news, because we're running really long in this segment, we didn't start the show until very late tonight.

933
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:56,181
[SPEAKER_05]: How's your gaming week going?

934
01:02:58,283 --> 01:03:01,186
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going fine.

935
01:03:02,087 --> 01:03:02,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

936
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:06,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Any games of note that you've been playing that you want to share?

937
01:03:07,472 --> 01:03:09,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Final Fantasy XI a lot.

938
01:03:10,155 --> 01:03:12,016
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I've been... Added.

939
01:03:12,056 --> 01:03:13,756
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, because I didn't play at all.

940
01:03:15,017 --> 01:03:16,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And getting ready for E3.

941
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:21,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, for those that may not know, we've been on the show... How could you not know by now?

942
01:03:21,879 --> 01:03:23,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we get new listeners every week, thank God.

943
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:23,780
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my shirt say?

944
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he's wearing his Konami shirt today.

945
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:28,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mikotov actually works for Konami, but due to NDAs... They've branded you.

946
01:03:28,922 --> 01:03:33,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Due to NDAs, he can't share with us a whole lot of information, but... E3?

947
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:36,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there sure is E3.

948
01:03:37,145 --> 01:03:38,926
[SPEAKER_05]: We gonna have a good time at Konami's booth?

949
01:03:39,637 --> 01:03:41,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, depends on what you like.

950
01:03:42,439 --> 01:03:43,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he ain't budging.

951
01:03:43,979 --> 01:03:44,580
[SPEAKER_04]: He ain't budging.

952
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:47,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm going to have a good time at Nintendo's booth.

953
01:03:49,002 --> 01:03:49,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

954
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:49,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Why Nintendo?

955
01:03:49,983 --> 01:03:51,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I want to play the Wii.

956
01:03:51,384 --> 01:03:52,884
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not working at Konami's booth?

957
01:03:53,004 --> 01:03:56,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, but I'm going to have all the official Konami attire so I'll look like I'm working.

958
01:03:56,747 --> 01:03:59,908
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you ask me a question, I'm just going to lie and make something up.

959
01:03:59,948 --> 01:04:00,509
[SPEAKER_04]: You're bad.

960
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:02,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Does your boss listen to this show?

961
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:02,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope not.

962
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:03,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

963
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,413
[SPEAKER_00]: We are having Metal Gear Solid 6 for the... For the Game Boy Advance.

964
01:04:10,237 --> 01:04:12,618
[SPEAKER_05]: We already told you what's going to be at Konami's booth anyway.

965
01:04:12,638 --> 01:04:13,798
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

966
01:04:14,118 --> 01:04:15,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, we had that story a few weeks ago?

967
01:04:15,998 --> 01:04:17,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but who says it's true?

968
01:04:18,979 --> 01:04:21,959
[SPEAKER_05]: The latest issue, Nintendo Power confirmed the... I got mine.

969
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:25,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember even subscribing or ordering it, but they sent me one.

970
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:29,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo Power confirmed the Portrait of Rune thing, but, Loki, you can throw this in now.

971
01:04:29,261 --> 01:04:31,281
[SPEAKER_05]: The Silent Hill thing may have actually been incorrect.

972
01:04:32,121 --> 01:04:34,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the name wrong, or they changed the name on me.

973
01:04:34,402 --> 01:04:35,702
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Konami trying to keep on...

974
01:04:36,052 --> 01:04:38,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep Me On My Toes, Joystick, Silent Hill Origins

975
01:05:01,207 --> 01:05:03,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin

976
01:05:27,249 --> 01:05:31,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what the big news is.

977
01:05:32,312 --> 01:05:33,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Silent Hill for the GameCom.

978
01:05:34,813 --> 01:05:35,794
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a GameCom?

979
01:05:36,294 --> 01:05:38,875
[SPEAKER_00]: A really piece of shit LCD system.

980
01:05:39,396 --> 01:05:41,297
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually happen to have one of those too.

981
01:05:41,797 --> 01:05:42,697
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta move on.

982
01:05:42,977 --> 01:05:45,719
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna be here through E3 because we'll be taping so long.

983
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:51,142
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a brand new PlayStation 3 controller that's gonna be unveiled next week.

984
01:05:51,182 --> 01:05:55,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So those of you guys that love the boomerang PlayStation 3 controller, tear up.

985
01:05:55,644 --> 01:05:57,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to do, like, Batman cosplay with that.

986
01:05:57,347 --> 01:05:57,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Not gonna happen.

987
01:05:58,268 --> 01:06:06,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it says, the rumors abound that it's gonna be unveiled at Sony's press conference, which is Monday night, if I remember, or Monday afternoon.

988
01:06:06,779 --> 01:06:07,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Monday 4.

989
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:09,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're on the road, so...

990
01:06:10,306 --> 01:06:13,548
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably just get into town right about the time that's going on.

991
01:06:13,788 --> 01:06:16,669
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have those available for download, though, so we'll watch it later.

992
01:06:16,829 --> 01:06:24,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so no idea what it's going to look like, but they're saying that probably going to go back to a more DualShock-style look.

993
01:06:25,794 --> 01:06:26,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree.

994
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:28,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they are going to change something radically about it.

995
01:06:29,076 --> 01:06:30,897
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to look like a giant schlong.

996
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:33,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that boomerang thing was a little weird.

997
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:38,421
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to look like Batman accessories.

998
01:06:39,021 --> 01:06:39,221
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

999
01:06:39,972 --> 01:06:40,673
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1000
01:06:57,077 --> 01:07:01,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega has posted their E3 lineup, except for the, of course, unannounced stuff.

1001
01:07:01,779 --> 01:07:22,209
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have Chromehounds on Xbox 360, working title The Clubs on PS3, Xbox 360, Full Auto 2, Battle Lines, Medieval 2, Total War, Phantasy Star Universe on just about everything under the sun, Sega Rally, Sonic Rivals, Sonic the Hedgehog on PS3 and Xbox 360, Super Monkey Ball Adventure, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz on the Wii,

1003
01:07:28,248 --> 01:07:32,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Whirlpool Championship 2007, and Yakuza on PS2.

1004
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:35,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega's a booth I'm definitely spending more time at this year than I did last year.

1005
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:37,591
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a pretty solid lineup, it sounds like.

1006
01:07:37,611 --> 01:07:38,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they have the chairs.

1007
01:07:39,891 --> 01:07:41,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, outside their theater or whatever?

1008
01:07:41,352 --> 01:07:43,653
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no, the chairs that were in the theater.

1009
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:45,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Comfy.

1010
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:50,735
[SPEAKER_00]: They had these big theater seats with, like, cup holders and crap, and they were, like, as big as...

1011
01:07:51,397 --> 01:07:52,778
[SPEAKER_00]: The chair that's in the studio.

1012
01:07:52,878 --> 01:07:58,760
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this theme with you at E3, and that is me and you always seem to pass out in very strange areas at E3.

1013
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:05,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I remember there was a picture of us, and I think we were sitting in the corner of some random booth in Kenshi Hall.

1014
01:08:05,182 --> 01:08:05,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega's room.

1015
01:08:06,322 --> 01:08:07,963
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go to Sega's room.

1016
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:10,544
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in one of the separate rooms.

1017
01:08:10,624 --> 01:08:13,565
[SPEAKER_00]: It was freaking Acclaim's room.

1018
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:14,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we passed out there, too.

1019
01:08:15,265 --> 01:08:17,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And drinking Coke, the free Coke that was there.

1020
01:08:18,701 --> 01:08:21,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And I found... It's all about food and napkin.

1021
01:08:21,243 --> 01:08:22,504
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met other people.

1022
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:28,570
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to camp out on the little staircase outside of Squeenix's little thing.

1023
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:32,233
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just sitting back there talking and apparently... Crap, who was it?

1024
01:08:32,253 --> 01:08:32,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot.

1025
01:08:32,593 --> 01:08:38,778
[SPEAKER_00]: It was another radio personage or had a homepage who knew somebody I knew.

1026
01:08:39,459 --> 01:08:40,340
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were talking about them.

1027
01:08:41,842 --> 01:08:51,072
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty hilarious, but I ended up also taking a nap somewhere way back behind the SOCOM 3 area.

1028
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:53,015
[SPEAKER_05]: How you nap at E3 is beyond me.

1029
01:08:53,035 --> 01:08:54,216
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we've got to keep going.

1030
01:08:54,236 --> 01:08:54,857
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tiring.

1031
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:56,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1032
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:56,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Busy girl.

1033
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:07,411
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to get a little bit outside the realm of gaming, I believe, but there was big DVD news this week, and therefore there's going to be a corresponding game thing going on with it.

1034
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:16,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we knew that LEGO Star Wars 2 was coming out, and LEGO Star Wars 2, the original trilogy, and of course now that since they're re-releasing the original trilogy DVDs on September 12th,

1035
01:09:17,062 --> 01:09:18,103
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1036
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:43,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Legos.

1037
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,240
[SPEAKER_05]: They're awesome.

1038
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:49,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, the Lego Star Wars games are games I keep meaning to check out that I never do, so maybe I'll get it this time.

1039
01:09:49,362 --> 01:09:51,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a business proposal for us all right now.

1040
01:09:51,163 --> 01:09:51,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, dear.

1041
01:09:52,223 --> 01:09:55,304
[SPEAKER_00]: In a few months, we should do a podcast from Legoland.

1042
01:09:56,944 --> 01:09:57,184
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1043
01:09:57,204 --> 01:09:58,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Legoland sucks, dude.

1044
01:09:58,205 --> 01:09:59,765
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't got the travel budget.

1045
01:09:59,925 --> 01:10:02,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Legoland is a lame-ass theme park.

1046
01:10:02,066 --> 01:10:04,987
[SPEAKER_05]: You find us some advertisers, we'll be fine.

1047
01:10:05,663 --> 01:10:10,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, pay for us to go to Legoland, and we'll say that your product doesn't suck.

1048
01:10:10,967 --> 01:10:12,288
[SPEAKER_05]: We go to Knott's Berry Farm, too.

1049
01:10:12,328 --> 01:10:13,870
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just have a crappy theme park.

1050
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:15,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just go to Disneyland.

1051
01:10:16,732 --> 01:10:19,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's got a barrage of television and movie game news.

1052
01:10:20,195 --> 01:10:21,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, goody.

1053
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:26,711
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not surprising, everyone's jumping on the bandwagon here.

1054
01:10:27,151 --> 01:10:42,055
[SPEAKER_03]: First one we've got coming out, THQ announced The Sopranos is heading to PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 and scheduled to be released this holiday season and of course you get to play all the Sopranos cast and yeah, it's basically Godfather all over again.

1055
01:10:42,235 --> 01:10:44,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So look for that, should be fun.

1056
01:10:46,216 --> 01:10:47,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Then of course we've got

1057
01:10:48,936 --> 01:10:49,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

1058
01:10:49,616 --> 01:10:51,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Reservoir Dogs was going to be coming out.

1059
01:10:52,338 --> 01:10:56,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one actually is being released by some really tiny company.

1060
01:10:56,580 --> 01:11:03,823
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I've read, none of the cast are... I don't know.

1061
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:13,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Quentin Tarantino pretends that this isn't actually going on, that the game's not being made, and just... I don't know.

1062
01:11:13,989 --> 01:11:14,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It...

1063
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:15,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

1064
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:22,844
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to try to go through some of the movie's plot and show you things that you might not have seen in the actual movie.

1065
01:11:23,665 --> 01:11:24,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it'll be good.

1066
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:28,707
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the one I'm kind of excited about, Scarface.

1067
01:11:29,047 --> 01:11:30,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming out this September.

1068
01:11:30,988 --> 01:11:34,070
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, this one looks really sweet.

1069
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:37,812
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a huge voice cast.

1070
01:11:37,852 --> 01:11:39,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody except for Al Pacino.

1071
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:42,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But Al Pacino, he actually picked out his voice actor for this.

1072
01:11:42,434 --> 01:11:43,295
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got...

1073
01:11:43,991 --> 01:11:44,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1074
01:12:05,216 --> 01:12:07,837
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio.

1075
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:31,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday you get this show, 183 Part A. Tuesday, not Wednesday, Tuesday you're going to get 183 Part B, so you get it a little early this week.

1076
01:12:31,849 --> 01:12:37,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, sometime in the evening, you're going to get our live shows that we're doing at the E3 Outpost.

1077
01:12:37,774 --> 01:12:42,096
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to hear us tape these shows live, we're actually going to be doing them at allgames.com.

1078
01:12:42,136 --> 01:12:47,799
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be on our own stream just due to technical restrictions, but it will be on allgames.com's feed.

1079
01:12:48,279 --> 01:12:50,500
[SPEAKER_05]: 6.30ish is the time.

1080
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:56,983
[SPEAKER_05]: That all depends on basically how fast we can get our butts back from the show and upstairs to start taping.

1081
01:12:57,023 --> 01:12:58,584
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really what everything relies on.

1082
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,065
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're giving ourselves 30 minutes.

1083
01:13:00,385 --> 01:13:01,705
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope that's enough time, but we'll see.

1084
01:13:03,703 --> 01:13:06,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're going to go to a break now.

1085
01:13:06,506 --> 01:13:20,399
[SPEAKER_05]: When we come back, we're going to talk about the DS Lite, we're going to talk about Full Auto 2, and Disney doing the DS all week come back with Part B. Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1086
