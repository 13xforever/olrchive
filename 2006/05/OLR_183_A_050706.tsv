14717	22754	Tonight, May 7th, 2006, Boobies in Oblivion brings on the Wrath of the M rating, news on the new DS, and E3 Madness!
32964	36225	Hello everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
36265	37086	It is May 7th, 2006.
37326	45990	This is episode number 183 of our live radio program and podcast dedicated to games that don't suck.
46030	52453	But sometimes we've got to talk about games that do suck just because we want to taunt them and laugh at them and take them outside and beat them.
52893	55254	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
55314	57595	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
57715	61417	In that corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
61717	61857	What?
65080	65640	How are you?
65660	66341	Happy Bunny?
66361	68563	Oh, you said bunny and I was thinking of the Cadbury Bunny.
68903	69623	That's what I thought too.
69643	70944	Do you know how fattening those things are?
70964	71825	Oh, they're so good though.
71845	73486	They're so good but they're so bad for you.
73686	77449	I try to tell myself that things that are very tasty like that are really, you know, they taste like poo.
77989	79851	Because, you know, chocolate is the color of poo.
80918	84240	I tried to keep that in my head whenever I look at chocolate, like I want to eat some.
84740	87042	But green tea frappuccino doesn't look like anything.
87102	87942	It just looks like yummy.
88202	88823	So I had one.
89063	89603	I had two.
90224	94166	One of them, though, had fat-free milk in it because I got it at Whole Foods.
94366	99709	I bet if I went through the last 20 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, 10 of them would start off with you talking about food.
102571	103732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
128519	128759	Good.
129519	129920	All right.
130260	132260	We've got a busy, busy show tonight, a lot of news.
132340	139343	If you want to join in the fun, if you're listening live to us right now on OrangeLoungeRadio.com, head on over to our chat room, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
139383	140023	Click on chat.
140183	142264	It's just that easy to join the chat room.
142981	144322	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
167774	168034	What?
168434	170256	We bought a Judge Dredd pinball machine.
170476	171676	Oh, why didn't you buy a good machine?
171736	172697	That is a good machine.
172777	174278	Oh my god, it's really awesome.
174858	177820	And then we're getting this other one called, I think, Frenzy or something.
178140	180382	It's supposed to be a really expensive pin table.
181162	186245	We're getting one that's kind of in crap repair for like, you know, a few hundred, but we're going to fix it up and resell it for like $5,000.
186365	187486	Call me when you get Pinbot.
188386	189347	I want a freaking Pinbot.
189367	192509	But no, the machine I really want, really, really... Bride of Pinbot.
193309	195591	Bride of Pinbot was awesome, but I want Black Knight 2000.
196482	197202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
221550	226913	Dan and I, when I first moved out here, we used to go eat at this Godfather's Pizza because I worked at GNC and it was right there.
227474	229875	So we'd drop off my deposit and go get dinner at Godfather's.
230515	232897	And they had a Last Action Hero pinball machine in there.
233397	235218	And we played the hell out of it.
235318	241502	In fact, the reason we stopped eating at that Godfather's Pizza was because they got rid of the damn pinball table.
241962	243383	They also had Snow Brothers there, too.
244144	245826	That's a great game, arcade game.
246727	248409	It's like Bubble Bobble, but it's not.
248750	249330	You know what I mean?
249410	249831	It's different.
250191	250572	I love that.
250612	252494	I play that on the Ultra Kade.
253355	256719	Well, the rest of my gaming week had to actually do with me downloading gaming stuff.
257079	258441	I played a crap load of Ragnarok.
258621	260003	I am now level 64, 48.
265772	269257	Mr. Addict, Final Fantasy Ask me how much Final Fantasy I played this week How much did you play?
269277	279451	Zip, thank you You're just in detox Zip You're going to get back on the habit like you did before After E3, you bet It's right where I'm going, right after E3 is over Yeah, but I can bring Ragnarok with me
280458	283381	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
305342	309866	because it's all the, let's sing the Silent Hill song!
309886	311467	Heather!
311487	313348	Let's sing the whole thing, it was great.
314349	315250	And I like the dog ending.
316010	322075	That was the one thing that disappointed me about the Silent Hill movie is I wanted after the credits there to be a dog ending or a UFO ending.
322255	324177	I think the DVD is going to have a UFO ending.
324237	324557	Sweet!
324617	330522	It better not be the craptastic same ones like they had in the games because the only good one was like the Heather one.
331397	336881	You know, on the Internet Movie Database, they said that the original cut of the Silent Hill movie was three and a half hours long.
337402	339243	Ooh, deleted scenes!
339323	345308	Take everything you read on Internet Movie Database with a grain of salt, but, you know, still be kind of neat if the DVD is... I'd rather take it with a spoon of sugar.
346349	346889	...action-packed.
347470	357137	Well, I think a lot of people now are filming extra stuff, even though they know it's not going to be in their things they think are neat, because it's going to be on the DVD.
357578	360240	They're going to have, like, an Uber Director's Edition unrated...
361152	365316	and Hoopla We're Gonna Save the World type DVD release.
365817	369240	Like all the 20 million Lord of the Rings DVDs that are out.
370201	371983	And you know Kevin Smith does it.
372083	372883	He does it on purpose.
373804	374685	I think that's hilarious.
375286	379550	So I think that the DVD of Silent Hill is going to be like the diggity...
379926	382948	Just if you want to hear hilarity, and then we'll get back into games.
383628	384609	I think it's Mallrats.
384649	386150	It's either Mallrats or Chasing Amy.
386250	392513	One of those, when you start listening to the director's commentary, they go, fuck DVD, because they were originally recording it for the LaserDisc edition.
392553	394014	I don't remember if it was Mallrats or Chasing Amy.
394054	394454	One of the two.
394694	395715	Our stuff has a comment for you.
395975	396355	Okay, what?
396515	398256	Not just to grain the whole damn shaker.
401858	402199	Hee hee.
404419	405180	Is that it?
405700	410883	Actually, though, that same night, I had a dream that I was stuck in Silent Hill with a dog.
412304	415546	It was the craziest, weirdest, most freaking out... It was an actual nightmare.
415786	416407	I'm not kidding.
416687	417888	But I had a dog there the whole time.
418068	419469	Same stupid little dog wearing headphones.
420970	421830	You are so weird.
422531	423131	It's true.
423331	425473	I think it was because I also was eating spaghetti.
427174	429015	Sure, blame your problems on spaghetti.
429727	435595	Well, okay, you ever notice that if you eat something before you go to bed and you've, like, watched something, you almost always end up having a weird dream?
436957	437819	Or does it just happen to me?
439180	441944	I don't remember my dreams, like, ever.
442425	444448	Once every three months, I'll remember a dream.
444847	446709	Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories It's not open yet.
446729	447589	I'm taking it to E3.
469379	469739	Have fun.
470500	471500	Loki, how was your gaming week?
472941	473981	Almost non-existent.
475381	476042	Oh yeah, it's true.
476482	479763	Loki got married, in case you weren't listening last week.
479783	481824	So congratulations, Loki, on your marriage.
482764	486306	I played Mutant Storm Reloaded on Xbox Live's arcade.
486846	487486	That was pretty fun.
488146	493668	And I played more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories, because I can.
494649	494809	And
497248	501912	The new firmware update did help some of the problems, but they're still there.
502293	516686	It's just, when you start playing more of the multiplayer stuff and actually starting to play the other modes that are in there, like team playing stuff, you start noticing how rushed the multiplayer was in the game, and how it really sucks and is really unfinished.
517587	517727	But,
518308	518728	Still fun.
519129	519469	I love it.
521550	527695	Then I've been playing a little bit of LocoRoco, which is also the demo that you can download for the PSP firmware 2.7.
528115	529476	I mentioned that last week.
530237	531077	It's actually kind of cool.
531277	531998	It's a different game.
532018	533559	I don't know.
533579	538523	It kind of seems in the same pot as Katamari.
539123	540864	Just kind of a little quirky game.
540884	543987	It reminds me of if Katamari and Yoshi's Island had a baby.
544227	544707	This would be...
547694	551536	A big, cute, cutesy blob.
551576	552837	Something's wrong with it, baby.
553277	554218	Something like that, yeah.
554378	556819	So it's different, I'll give them that.
559081	560902	That's pretty much it, I think.
561983	562263	Alright.
564357	568538	My gaming week, actually, I didn't play anything new because of my work trip that really cut into my week.
568558	571299	They wanted $10 a night for internet access in my hotel.
571339	572340	I was like, F you.
572680	574260	That's what I don't like about swanky hotels.
574300	580762	I like that my work puts me up in swanky hotels when I go travel, but then they want more money for internet access that my work's not going to pay for.
580862	583022	So I didn't get to really play any games.
583143	586764	I couldn't play World of Warcraft, even though I canceled my account anyway.
586804	588444	But if I got bored enough, I would have reactivated it.
589165	590527	or any Flash games or anything.
590587	592670	So I did have my DS.
592970	595674	I've been doing my brain training mostly every day.
595754	599499	I've unlocked, I think I've got my 17th stamp as of today.
599579	603385	So I've unlocked the triangle math was the last thing I got, the hard mode.
603465	605247	No, wait, I think there was another game after that.
605928	607609	I only have one more game left to unlock.
608030	608970	Brain Training is going good.
609131	610231	Also Tetris DS.
610892	616196	Extifer, my roommate, has been borrowing my Tetris DS and he actually unlocked level 20.
616616	623101	He beat the whole game and so playing Tetris on level 20 is insane because the blocks don't even fall.
623181	624442	They just drop.
624482	626944	Imagine just having the blocks drop every time.
626964	627745	That's what it does on level 20.
628265	634730	But level 20 is inspired by classic NES Tetris which is pretty cool because you know how Tetris DS is all inspired by different
635050	635330	N.E.S.
635350	636031	games of the past.
636231	637551	Well, level 20 is N.E.S.
637571	640092	Tetris, so I thought that was pretty rad, and it has a remix of the theme.
640833	644714	Played six-player multiplayer Tetris DS last night.
645234	646015	Craziness.
646255	647175	Absolute craziness.
647455	647795	But fun.
648396	648736	Good times.
650487	651227	Thanks for watching!
666014	667654	Keep up on what's going on for E3.
667995	671355	And of course, we have a whole lot of news to get into tonight.
671395	674136	But first, we have a very special announcement.
674196	675856	I'll let Loki plug this.
676197	679997	This is something we've been teasing for a few weeks, but it is now official.
680217	681158	We're announcing it tonight.
681298	682098	Loki, tell us about it.
682258	685879	Yes, of course, we're working on a new site for weeks now.
686679	690440	New site is going to be, I think it is the only...
690933	693380	PSP formatted site covering E3.
697492	697772	E3 on PSP.com
724109	726050	and so we'll get a lot of exclusive content.
726891	737896	I'm going to the Nintendo Party on Tuesday, so hopefully you'll actually get to see what the Nintendo Party looks like, because a lot of people don't get to go to the E3, let alone go to parties and stuff like that.
737976	740718	So definitely lots of content on there.
740918	744820	We've got some stuff on there already, just to give you an idea of what they're...
745330	745810	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
767746	768948	To what extent just yet?
769148	772593	I think Bobby said he'd do some on-camera stuff for us, so I'm going to hold him to that.
772954	776419	So, you know, you're going to have videos with myself, Loki.
776599	779644	If we can give DarkSakura enough sugar, maybe we'll get her in one of the videos.
779664	781827	And maybe if I can find a Dr. Doom mask.
782928	799350	and I'm sure we'll have Bobby and then hopefully maybe Scott and Lawrence as well so all on the E3 on PSP site giving you walkthroughs of Boost just talking about games and of course you know our big thing is interactiveness so if you guys want to send us an email and say hey guys
800580	801321	Check this out.
801721	803022	I want to see this.
803062	805625	We did this last year at E3.
805905	811591	We pulled the shows from our archives, but if you talk to some of our listeners who've been around a while, you can probably find copies of these shows.
811891	813773	We actually opened it up during these shows.
814033	815915	Like on Wednesday, we said, okay, send us your questions.
816175	817697	We'll find out the answers on Thursday.
817717	822781	And we actually took all the questions and went out on the floor and figured out the answers to them and brought them to you on Thursday's show.
822802	824743	We wanted to do the same thing with the site as well.
825566	831471	The other great thing about the site is that if you're an E3 attendee, we're going to put maps of the show floor on there.
831491	833473	In fact, that's the one thing that's still missing, right?
833533	834373	Nope, it's up there.
834453	835074	Oh, did you get it done?
835194	836335	Yeah, it's up there.
836715	839498	But it's not just going to be maps, just like everything.
839518	849046	I mean, it's good to have, if you have access to even some of the Wi-Fi there, you can actually see, you know, okay, I'm waiting on this giant line.
849066	851908	What exactly are they showing at the Sony booth or, you know,
852694	853255	Thanks for watching!
873925	880487	You can look at it in Firefox, Internet Explorer, but it's not going to look right.
880547	882187	But if you're okay with that, go ahead.
882207	883527	There's going to be a lot of great videos you can look at.
883547	885008	And they're asking if Flash is on there yet.
885208	889529	No, I didn't support Flash on this because not everyone is upgrading their firmware to 2.7.
890349	894430	And I didn't want to force people to do that and didn't want to exclude people from certain things.
894550	899371	So, no Flash on there, but it'll still be pretty quick and...
900592	902732	I don't know, the Flash on the PSP is not that great right now.
902752	904613	I just want to play with it, see what I can do with it.
904733	908853	Yeah, we'll table the Flash thing for a later OLR PSP upgrade.
908873	909454	That'll be cool.
909934	917615	Well, yeah, later on when we're done with the PSP site, E3 and PSP, you'll see some definite improvements.
917695	919855	I have ideas.
921096	925516	But lots and lots and lots of content, and it should be good.
926396	929057	All right, let's go into some other news.
930273	934134	While you're all checking out E3 on PSP.com, we'll talk about Nintendo.
934154	942998	This is a little bit of a follow-up to last week's mini-episode, and by the way, if you haven't figured it out, there's a little joke at the end of last week's episode.
943058	950220	If you turned off the show before DarkSakura and I came back and talked about the Wii, you missed the last ten minutes of the show.
950320	950940	And we laugh at you.
951120	952301	Yeah, we played a little gag.
952621	958063	I think most people probably figured it out because they probably saw the MP3 wasn't finished yet, but just in case you missed it,
958483	961865	Yes, DarkSakura and I did talk about the Wii last week when Loki wasn't here.
962445	969788	One of the things we talked about was the conspiracy theories going on on the internet that, oh, the Wii's not trademarked, so it can't be true.
970129	972990	It's all a viral gag campaign.
973610	975011	They're pulling your leg.
975071	977272	Nintendo's going to come out and announce the real name.
977812	978873	Well, guess what?
979493	982775	This week, the Wii trademark did show up on the website.
983935	984755	And it's there.
984795	987077	If you want to check the database for yourself, have fun.
987317	987837	W-I-I
989542	990903	Nintendo has trademarked it.
991883	994405	It's actually right up there on their site as a tab.
994625	1001248	Now I'm sure that you guys will have crazy conspiracy theories that say, well it's still fake or whatever.
1002169	1004590	No, it's going to be the name of the console, just deal with it.
1004670	1012314	I think most people are kind of backing off on the name now and waiting to see what the games are like, which is what we were saying all along last week.
1013034	1027408	I think the name does exactly what any type of name should do like I said last week the whole purpose you know things you should do when advertising anything is to have something simple something that people are going to remember and something that people are going to talk about and I think that they've accomplished that pretty well
1029370	1029930	It'll be fine.
1030191	1030831	I mean, we'll see.
1031251	1035772	The real test will be in a few days when we start seeing the games at E3.
1036293	1040454	And Loki has a news article on some of the games we're going to be seeing on the Wii.
1040494	1042675	I don't know if we'll see this at E3, but later on.
1042815	1043135	Maybe.
1043775	1048957	Spider-Man 3, they're going to have a special version for it, which is not surprising.
1048977	1053578	I mean, most of the games I think that are going to be ported to it are going to be having unique versions of it.
1054718	1055959	But got to report it, Spider-Man 3.
1056767	1057728	Unique version for the Wii.
1058229	1059710	So, that'd be pretty interesting.
1061532	1068379	Actually, I think that ties in with something we talked about a while ago, where they're saying that they're going to have some web slinging you can do with the controller or something.
1068399	1069601	Probably the same thing.
1069641	1072744	Is it just me, or does all this control stuff sound too good to be true?
1072864	1079311	I mean, I can't help it at this stage, I get flashbacks to the Power Glove, and I kind of go...
1080453	1084575	The Power Glove was a neat concept, but it wasn't really that great.
1084595	1087436	I mean, granted, technology has progressed, what, 15 years since then?
1087876	1091838	But I can't help but wonder, is it going to be accurate?
1092018	1095919	Is it really going to be as in the game as everyone says it is?
1095999	1097300	Better than the eye toy.
1097980	1098440	Yeah, I know.
1098520	1100821	And the eye toy is still kind of gimmicky to me, too.
1101261	1101642	So I...
1103783	1104583	Midway's Blitz The League
1125789	1128650	Of course, whatever they're going to be calling it this time.
1129030	1134252	But actually, it looks pretty cool, especially if they're going to be doing similar stuff to what Madden's going to be doing.
1134992	1138573	Should be a pretty good game, so looking forward to that.
1139353	1143514	And then, God knows what other stuff they're going to have coming out.
1144054	1145995	But Blitz League will be pretty cool.
1148507	1154629	The whole, like, throwing the football with the... That just... Oh, I can just see remotes going through TVs.
1154789	1165412	You know, they have VAs doing their... They're having a passing and kicking demo, as well as a one-game demo for Madden 2007.
1166493	1167793	So we'll see how it's going to work.
1168633	1170494	I'm just waiting for, like, a game where...
1171314	1172295	Like Super Smash Bros.
1172315	1174537	or something like that where you start beating someone with a remote.
1174918	1176219	That would be fun.
1177060	1178601	Going over to our chat room for some comments.
1178821	1181624	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.
1183376	1183736	Paraparaparadise
1211141	1211641	It's so bad.
1236445	1240908	DarkSakura, a series that you talk about a lot is coming to the Wii, right?
1241288	1241669	Wii!
1242289	1245051	In fact, you're probably the only person I know that still plays these games.
1245211	1247713	Hey, Dan does too, and a lot of our friends.
1248013	1249834	That's why you two live happily ever after.
1249934	1252416	It's because we're old school, like that, yo.
1253517	1255979	Anyway, Metal Slug is coming out on the Wii!
1257180	1259021	I told you I was going to call it Wii from now on.
1260092	1262154	Let's take bets on how long before that gets annoying.
1262334	1264456	And if you had right now, you just won.
1264976	1265437	You know what?
1265797	1266097	Shut up.
1268539	1271202	The Metal Slug Anthology is going to be out on the Wii.
1272743	1276307	And it will be the 20 millionth release of Metal Slug whatever.
1277071	1278272	You know, I love Metal Slug.
1278292	1282814	And this is saying it's going to be the complete Metal Slug Arcade Edition with a bunch of bonus stuff.
1283134	1283654	Right.
1283774	1289157	And that you use the Wii controller in a, quote, new and unique way.
1289577	1294339	But he didn't, you know, it was actually announced by Ben Herman, who's the president of SNK.
1294720	1295640	Didn't give any details.
1297561	1302904	Also, that's supposed to, I think, go hand in hand with the release of SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters.
1303184	1305745	You'll use the Wii controller too, you know.
1306226	1312311	Throw up your money that's going to be thrown into the fire because you're throwing away your money to buy this stupid game.
1312371	1318636	Like if you're put in mummy mode, do you like wave your Wii and puke or something?
1318916	1322259	Will you be able to use your Wii to actually make the graphics look next gen?
1323981	1324401	You know what?
1324461	1330186	If SNK really wanted to make us happy, they would freaking put out another Metal Slug on the Neo Geo.
1331291	1333132	For those of us who have our Neo Geo's collecting dice.
1333172	1333933	That would not make me happy.
1334033	1334754	All three of you.
1334774	1336255	Stop making Metal Slug games.
1336295	1337376	Hey, there's not three of us.
1337396	1338176	There's at least five.
1338236	1342519	You can do an S&K Classic Collection or something like that and be done with it.
1342620	1344021	Stop re-releasing Metal Slug.
1344181	1345021	No one buys them.
1345262	1346402	Hey, I do.
1347823	1349845	Yeah, but did you buy every single re-release of it?
1349865	1350445	Um, yes.
1352807	1353828	And we have them on our meme.
1355309	1358872	Well, you know, what if, like, say that we have, like, the PlayStation hooked up one day?
1359810	1361411	I love SNK I love SNK almost as much as I love Sega
1388103	1388803	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1419052	1419714	I like that idea.
1419814	1420516	Hey, you know what?
1420757	1421579	That gives me ammo.
1422318	1425600	No, what I want to do, I want to convert one of the ferrets into a rev mode.
1425801	1426541	That would be hilarious.
1426561	1427041	Great idea.
1427242	1427802	Where's the ferret?
1427942	1428222	I don't know.
1428242	1428643	We burned it.
1429003	1429383	Hey!
1429663	1430204	Moving on.
1430564	1431665	Getting into a story here.
1432105	1433546	This was huge news this week.
1433726	1434527	Oblivion.
1435127	1437049	Is this the sequel to Hot Coffee?
1437089	1439050	This whole debacle going on on Oblivion.
1439070	1449098	You guys have probably read about this, but if you've been living in a cave or you just avoid Oblivion news for whatever reason, the ESRB changed the rating of the PC version of Oblivion from T...
1449818	1453182	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1467785	1471228	However, the boobies were never meant to be accessed.
1471588	1474290	You were not allowed to have a topless character in Oblivion.
1474551	1476752	There is no up, up, down, down, left, right.
1476852	1479074	There is no code to get the boobies.
1479575	1483818	You have to do a third-party outside hack to put the boobies on.
1484218	1486140	Because of this third-party hack...
1487208	1495911	It has been exposed that the boobs were on the disc the whole time, and therefore this game is not safe for children, and it's slapped with an M rating.
1496331	1497731	Here's my problem with this whole thing.
1498291	1512336	Why, I mean, that's just like saying, if I took, let's say, Care Bearers the movie, and I spliced in porn in there, and put that ISO on the internet, would they have to re-rate that movie X because I spliced in porn?
1512476	1514976	No, because the porn wasn't on the disc to begin with.
1515076	1516617	That, I believe, is the whole thing.
1517205	1521347	What about then in the case of The Rescuers with the sliced in nudie photo?
1522808	1523308	Good point.
1523408	1534534	Which was done at the animation studio and has been on every subsequent release except for the modern ones after these, you know, uptight anal retentive right-wing people decided to watch every frame and pick out stuff in it.
1534754	1537215	Or The Lion King where the stars spell out sex.
1537796	1537976	Yeah.
1538056	1541297	Or in Aladdin where if you listen real carefully it goes, take your clothes off.
1541437	1545179	Actually, that was deemed to be fake and I found that out at Snopes.com, your website of the week.
1545199	1545640	I love Snopes.
1545700	1546120	However...
1547077	1549500	It's still, I mean, it looks like those stars do say sex.
1549640	1550661	I mean, if you look at it real carefully.
1550681	1553944	You know Ronald McDonald's hair, it says hot, yummy, good.
1554284	1554785	It's serious.
1555606	1557528	No, that's a very good, you know what though, that's a very good point.
1557568	1561972	The Rescuers wasn't made an R movie because, you know, it had that one frame of boobies in it.
1562292	1566176	But yet the games are, you know, damned for this.
1566777	1569740	Well, the thing is, this is how I see it, you know.
1570785	1571285	Bloody Roar 3
1601580	1611125	had, if you use a cheat, a cheat whatever, you can pull up pictures that the game programmers did in of the characters in compromising positions.
1612406	1614047	Like, naked and doing stuff.
1614127	1616868	Yeah, they really tried to sell that game despite the fact that it sucked.
1617108	1623133	You know, people are saying that this is nothing like hot coffee, but I say this is exactly like hot coffee.
1623153	1623633	You know why?
1623714	1626896	Because that sex game was never meant to be found either.
1626956	1632581	It was on the disc, but I say it's the exact same thing that's happening between the two games.
1634242	1638145	Oblivion, the creators probably planned for there to be a topless character.
1638205	1638945	You know, why not?
1639005	1642067	If the game's violent, why not throw in a little nudity as well?
1642368	1647291	However, at some point during the beta or even the alpha testing, they decided, you know what?
1647351	1647871	Bad idea.
1648252	1650633	Let's just take the pointer out to the textures.
1650974	1654256	It's easier to take the pointer out than to redo everything on the disc.
1655721	1657923	I've always said that's the exact same thing that happened with Hot Coffee.
1657943	1663049	The way they do clothing nowadays, it's just an actual object on top of an object.
1663169	1668515	So the textures are always there, it's just they're covered up by a clothing object.
1668835	1672019	So you just remove that clothing object, and there you go.
1672480	1673681	I'm so irritated.
1673701	1675363	They didn't get pissed off about it with The Sims.
1676525	1678066	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1698380	1700961	Take Two Presents, or Rockstar Presents Table Tennis.
1702342	1705543	I blame all of those sexually repressed anal retentive people.
1705743	1707064	Alright, let's get into the follow-ups.
1707164	1708985	Loki, Bethesda Responds.
1709265	1726433	Yes, they respond, basically insist that a full and accurate comprehensive report of Oblivion's content was submitted to the ESRB before the game's release that included a 60-page document that detailed all explicit language, accents, scenes in the game.
1726980	1727940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1756601	1758383	You know, of course this news comes out.
1758723	1759704	And so what do they do?
1759844	1770814	You know, freaking California Assemblyman Leland Yee issued a press release calling on Take-Two and the ESRB to stop deceiving parents.
1771574	1781063	And he said, and I quote, The ESRB again has failed our parents and it's clearly shown that they cannot police themselves.
1781772	1791639	Plain and simple, the current rating system is drastically flawed and here is yet another reason why we need legislation to assist parents and protect children.
1791919	1798083	Wow, somebody didn't do their research at all before coming out and sounding like a complete jackass.
1798784	1800225	So, excellent.
1802607	1806769	By the way, he was also one of the politicians to pick up on the hot coffee scandal.
1807550	1809051	Comments from chat room.
1809711	1810072	Let's see.
1811363	1815824	BlackWolf says, no, it was actually the way they did their 3D models.
1816104	1821145	The bra object was on top of the nudie object and you could not remove the bra object without a mod.
1821665	1824066	So I guess the boobs were just there to make it more realistic.
1824506	1829527	Still, okay, so whatever, it was for a more complex reason.
1829607	1832088	Still, the boobies were not meant to be seen by themselves.
1832508	1835948	Okay, so like what if you have a movie and you have someone walk around in their undies?
1836509	1838609	Well, they could have that edited off.
1839363	1840023	That's true.
1840204	1841224	Digital editing.
1841284	1842866	We could go back, you know, that scene with Tom Cruise.
1842886	1845307	Deleted scenes, pull off the, you know, stuff.
1845367	1847509	That scene with Tom Cruise from Risky Business.
1847569	1850551	You know, we could just edit, digitally edit in a schlong, floppy floppy.
1851092	1852873	And is that going to get the movie re-rated NC-17?
1853153	1855315	That makes a lot of fangirls, I think.
1855735	1856756	Okay, what was that movie?
1857296	1879962	where if you freeze frame it at just the right point you can see his schlong and that happens in movies all the time where like you know you might see a titty or you might see a schlong if you pause it at just the right moment there's several movies that are like that exactly or you know like in Austin Powers there's a scene where with what's her name Elizabeth Hurley where he moves like the piece of fruit at just the wrong time and you can see the red tape over her
1881809	1883130	That actually was pointed out to me, by the way.
1883431	1886954	Arsef in the chatroom says, Leland Yee is a respectable man, I suppose.
1886994	1890557	He just needs to learn what the hell he's talking about before he blasts video games, it seems.
1891298	1897603	I agree 100% with that statement applied to about 99% of politicians out there right now.
1897704	1899045	Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter.
1899325	1901247	They all need to do their research on this subject.
1901547	1901947	Exactly.
1902027	1904530	I don't mind them coming after if an actual...
1905171	1926104	company out there, like, say, for example, we were to find out tomorrow that EA, you know, with Sims 2, purposefully left in, you know, nudity and, say, there's child sex in the game or something like that, you know, then, yes, then they need to come after them and say, okay, you need to re-rate this and you probably need to remove this content.
1926524	1934109	Whereas, you know, if this wasn't meant to be in the game and someone added it in with a third-party, you know, patch or hack,
1934690	1935458	That's a little different.
1935479	1936792	They need to do their research.
1938891	1942333	All right, well, the gaming community is getting a little ticked off, too.
1942894	1944855	Specifically, we have John Romero.
1944895	1947557	You know him as one of the co-founders of ID Software.
1948237	1956063	He went off on his blog about this whole re-rating fiasco, and he was saying modders are not screwing up the industry.
1956103	1957404	They're supposed to be helping.
1959245	1967891	And basically just saying that he fears that developers are going to have to basically make their games tougher to hack to avoid these re-rating incidents in the future.
1968658	1971360	So, he's kind of... Oh, I'm sorry.
1971380	1972541	Did I say modders or not?
1972601	1975403	Modders are now screwing up the industry that they're supposed to be helping.
1975764	1977605	I thought when I read that, it sounded a little different when I first read that.
1977845	1980007	Yeah, modders are now screwing up the industry they're supposed to be helping.
1980387	1984030	So, you know... They've been doing this crap for years, though.
1984210	1984430	Yeah.
1984490	1994578	Like, there's actually... There was a Game Boy hack rom for the Legend of Zelda game that was on that where Link looked like a little troll and was carrying around a giant...
1995174	1995495	Penis.
1996036	1996637	You know what's interesting?
1996677	1999823	What was one of the first games that everybody and their mom was hacking?
2000244	2000584	Doom?
2001246	2001646	Yeah.
2002849	2005273	There were even games that were released, though, that were like that.
2005714	2007678	Of course, they weren't usually sanctioned, but hey.
2010097	2012239	You know what pisses me off most about this?
2012299	2014521	And maybe I'm getting a little political here, but I don't care.
2015162	2018325	What is the big deal about a couple of boobs?
2018966	2019847	I mean, seriously.
2020407	2023030	Oblivion is a really violent game.
2023090	2023851	Actually, there's a lot.
2023871	2025052	I don't even have to pick on Oblivion.
2025072	2028195	There's a lot of very, very violent video games out there.
2028756	2031799	Yet it takes a set of boobs to get your game rated M?
2032139	2032760	I have a theory.
2033000	2034643	I don't get this at all.
2034683	2036726	This is just my rant on society.
2037487	2040451	I may not be a father yet, but someday I hope to.
2040511	2045078	And I know that one of the ways I plan to raise my kid is that I would...
2045879	2047260	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2071403	2080942	Well, keep in mind also, you know, from the average child perspective, the thing that you cannot do becomes all the more attractive, you know?
2082384	2111222	and I think that they either you know with this type of environment with that much repression of what they see they're either going to grow up to be really fucked up in the head is what I think you know not knowing the right way to do things not knowing the reality because there was as an example one of my friends her best friend growing up was not allowed to watch the news was not allowed to watch violent movies was not allowed to watch anything that wasn't G-rated when she graduated high school she had no idea how the world worked
2112697	2117139	She didn't learn anything from her friends because she grew up in such a sheltered environment.
2117499	2119540	She wasn't allowed to go out or anything.
2120160	2125082	You know what's interesting, too, and I promise we'll get back on games in a minute here, but you notice in movies... Okay, go ahead.
2125442	2131504	Well, just my example on this is that she thought that oral sex was just talking about it.
2133453	2134093	No, I'm serious.
2135374	2136454	But that's an example.
2136514	2136814	I believe it.
2136874	2148739	But I'm afraid that if things like this are allowed to happen, we're going to see more kids growing up without having any type of concept of what the world is like or how to interact or anything like that.
2148819	2154021	You ever notice this about violent movies, that in violent movies, a lot of times the person causing the violence is the hero?
2154101	2158162	Like you look at The Terminator, an incredibly violent movie, but you cheer on Arnold.
2158182	2160403	You're like, yeah, kick some ass, blow those guys up.
2160663	2161464	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2181385	2183587	I'm really thinking that we've got this sort of vicious cycle going on.
2183967	2185368	Because, okay, think about it.
2185408	2185789	The more...
2196940	2198302	The government steps in.
2199223	2203827	This has actually been something that's happened, I'd say, since the late 80s, that we've seen the government stepping in.
2204568	2211916	I'll bring this up as a point, and it also is more jackass involved in it, but the whole cop killer thing, remember that?
2212536	2215699	Remember, he was also the one responsible for the whole Two Life crew business.
2216220	2216740	Remember that?
2217341	2224847	Well, keep in mind that since we've had this cycle of going through, of having the government step in and try to say, hey, you know, you can't do that.
2224867	2225327	This is bad.
2225387	2229111	We've seen an increase in this type of game or this type of movie.
2229351	2233354	We have seen people want more and more the more that other people say you can't have it.
2234475	2239760	So, and again, it is like Sakurina said, the forbidden fruit syndrome.
2240347	2241287	That is fully what it is.
2241508	2242768	This is something that stays with you.
2243388	2245669	The more you can't have something, the more you want it.
2245729	2247070	The demand keeps growing.
2248010	2254713	This didn't make the show roll for tonight, but it just makes me think as well that I heard about there was some sex game that got banned from E3.
2254913	2260475	I'm sorry, I don't have the story in front of me, but E3 said that some game couldn't be exhibited on the floor because it's mostly about sex.
2260495	2260996	Was it Three Fields?
2262771	2263772	No, it wasn't that.
2263812	2268556	It was the lady that's very well known for her sex in the games.
2268736	2274541	I'm sure somebody in chat room is going to yell it out momentarily here, but they were banned from the E3 floor, and I'm thinking... Why?
2274841	2275161	Why?
2275842	2277143	No one under 18 is allowed anyway.
2277163	2277723	Exactly.
2278644	2280806	And if they are, we freaking need to get them kicked out.
2280826	2283248	That's what I don't get about the whole booth baby thing either.
2283288	2283969	Naughty America.
2284549	2285510	Thank you, Naughty America.
2285590	2286471	See, I knew they'd yell it out.
2286731	2286891	But...
2287901	2296726	I just think that it's very sad, you know, and we're really one of the few countries that are really focused on such, you know, repression.
2296766	2297686	I mean, it really is.
2298446	2299907	We are a repressed society.
2299947	2303329	There are way too many people in power who are not getting the nookie or something.
2304069	2306050	Or if they're getting it, it's all dry and stale.
2306230	2306631	I don't know.
2307471	2308952	We do have a worldwide audience, though.
2309012	2311953	So, you know, some folks are probably listening to us bitching going, you know.
2312093	2312974	We should start our own country.
2314764	2316724	Maybe we just need more political parties in this country.
2316805	2319645	I know we've got plenty of political parties.
2320065	2324306	The whole issue, and I'm not meaning to get into a political rant, but you all know how I feel on this.
2324906	2330588	We have too many people who are not willing to move away from this bipartisan bullshit that we've got.
2330868	2331208	Pardon me.
2332648	2333649	This is how I feel about it.
2333669	2334989	I feel very strongly about this.
2337089	2343811	There are too many people who, when they vote for a certain politician, say for the presidential election, they vote straight ticket.
2344332	2345953	because they haven't taken the time to research.
2346354	2349256	They do not realize that they are the ones who have fucked this up for themselves.
2349677	2350497	It is their fault.
2351518	2354141	The primary voters in this country, it is your fault.
2354921	2355662	Educate yourself.
2356042	2356603	I'm serious.
2357162	2359483	You can send those cards and letters to mailbag at orangehoundsradio.com.
2359663	2360784	I have made no secret of this.
2361064	2374431	I think that it's because the people of this country keep putting these type of people in power that we see... I think that the majority of people enjoy being repressed and uninformed.
2374871	2383236	I think they like being ignorant because usually when you find out something... A friend of mine has a quote that says, the truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off.
2384440	2385560	Interesting comment from the chat room.
2385640	2390662	Blaze says, Japan is much more open about sex and their rape rate is like less than 1% of all people.
2392142	2394863	I don't know where that quote is from, but it's an interesting comment.
2395443	2399264	They actually have a thing going on with a lot of wives while their husbands are out on business trips.
2399304	2400805	And this is actually a business arrangement.
2401245	2403565	They will basically sell their services.
2405206	2405346	Wow.
2406784	2417030	It's very common for a man to have a mistress and have his wife because his mistress will be the one to engage him socially, whereas the wife will be the one to take care of the house and raise the kids and be the goddess of her domain.
2418691	2420972	And how does this tie into a boobies and oblivion again?
2420992	2421973	I think we got off subject.
2422873	2430118	Because of the whole thing that it is these closed-minded, ignorant people who are...
2430846	2435411	Going through and wanting this type of thing taken out from mainstream availability.
2435792	2437213	I think we need more of it, honestly.
2437934	2441418	Maybe if more people are seeing the boobies, they won't go out raping people.
2442887	2443267	DarkSakura
2465105	2466025	I like violence!
2467106	2470426	I don't like this game very much because first person shooters make me nauseous.
2470906	2471266	Literally.
2471766	2474627	But we have a lot of people who are into these types of games.
2475427	2480068	The next Call of Duty game is not going to be out on the PC.
2481028	2487849	Activision is basically stating and I quote, it's not a PC product it's a console product and it's all next gen.
2488349	2491370	Doesn't mean that there's not going to be any more on the PC.
2491510	2492430	I mean we did see
2493250	2515554	um other versions released on a PS2, Xbox, GameCube, Xbox 360 um but they are going to stick it so far strictly to the next-gen consoles um there was also a question going about if um Infinity Ward's doing this year's a console title themselves um for Call of Duty um and uh
2518084	2521407	That has actually been seen to be left unanswered so far.
2523089	2524711	They also released the big red one last year.
2527894	2529376	But no Call of Duty on your PC.
2530837	2533700	Well, there's a lot of PC gamers out there who are very sad at that, but
2534750	2539672	I guess, you know, it looks like developers, a lot of them are focusing their attention on console games.
2539772	2541893	And, you know, PC games, just kind of a different market.
2541933	2543734	There's a different type of game that's successful there.
2544114	2551617	There's actually, though, a really good first-person shooter making it out onto the Xbox 360.
2552318	2552558	Fear.
2553458	2554118	Oh, I heard about that.
2554298	2557320	Yeah, I actually found that out from my husband today.
2557840	2559481	So he's pretty excited about that.
2560141	2561722	So it's actually going to be a good first-person shooter.
2562242	2562382	Mm-hmm.
2563438	2568361	Loki, we had a rumor last week about this, but we got confirmation.
2568401	2568781	What is it?
2569121	2571022	Well, it's sort of confirmation.
2571742	2582307	Basically, according to an EB Games employee, Nintendo has sent posters including a blank GameCube-branded new low-price sticker.
2582607	2584328	So basically, they're getting the POP now.
2585075	2586036	Which is Tuesday, right?
2586056	2587037	That is correct.
2613963	2614323	I don't know.
2614363	2618449	With all the Wii excitement, I guess GameCube will just be kind of a budget thing.
2618469	2620192	It's like, let's get the kids one for their room.
2620432	2621313	That's what the 64 is.
2624255	2627216	You know, they still have Nintendo 64 at McDonald's, some of them.
2627236	2634258	They still advertise them on little... Like when I was in LA, I drove by a McDonald's that actually still was advertising the Nintendo 64 on one of their things.
2634298	2635238	I thought that was very interesting.
2635418	2636498	That is hilarious.
2637319	2640660	Which might explain why you don't see Los Angeles on this list.
2640860	2641200	I don't know.
2641260	2644741	It's the top video game cities in America.
2645221	2650142	It was a survey commissioned by Sperling for Best Places and Microsoft.
2650622	2652643	It rated Seattle, Washington...
2653363	2655465	as the top video game city in America
2669662	2674166	The other top ten, number ten, Philadelphia, number nine, San Diego, number eight, Boston, number seven, St.
2674206	2674306	Louis.
2692003	2693784	Number 6, Washington, D.C.
2693884	2700166	Number 5, Phoenix, Mesa Number 4, Detroit Number 3, Hotlanta Number 2, Minneapolis, St.
2700226	2720895	Paul And number 1, of course, Seattle Our close-by neighbor, San Francisco, is number 14 But here in Sacramento, we don't make the cut That's because they didn't interview me and Dan Neither does Los Angeles, which I find very interesting Los Angeles does not make the cut as well I wonder if it would have tilted it in Sacramento's favor If they had actually interviewed me and Dan That would have been hilarious
2722605	2723426	Who knows, who knows.
2723726	2729950	But see, for every you and Dan, there's 100,000 people that don't own any systems, so you just have to remember.
2732172	2733493	Interesting comment from the chatroom there.
2733553	2738457	Funnydale says, Seattle is number one only because everyone has to stay inside because it always rains.
2739617	2739838	True.
2740378	2740978	Interesting point.
2741759	2744041	It does have the highest precipitation rate in the country.
2744481	2746082	It does have a pretty high suicide rate, too.
2747423	2747703	I don't know.
2747844	2748064	Anyway.
2749491	2750271	Sorry to make it morbid.
2751212	2755854	Loki's going to tell us about a nice, fun, happy game to take our minds off of that.
2756134	2756954	Yes.
2757594	2761136	Hot Pixel is a new game by Atari for the PSP.
2761576	2762996	It's going to be just like WarioWare.
2763016	2766018	It's going to feature hundreds of tiny five-second games.
2766478	2770079	We actually have pictures of this on our E3 on the PSP website, by the way.
2770840	2772240	And it looks pretty cool.
2772580	2774001	It's just lots of weird stuff.
2774041	2778143	It's all going to have kind of an urban spin on it.
2778283	2779243	So it's going to have a lot of
2780149	2781190	Digital Street Culture
2798359	2801402	It's going to be another minigame type of thing, also for the PSP.
2802483	2803804	That one should be pretty interesting too.
2803864	2805245	But I'm looking forward to checking this out.
2805265	2809488	They're going to have this actually at E3, I believe, and it's due out this fall.
2809849	2810229	I like this.
2810810	2817375	In our chatroom, DJ Janai says, will they make it, since this is on the PSP, will they make a game called Dead Pixel?
2818316	2818616	Get it?
2819397	2820918	Because PSP has had the Dead Pixels?
2821879	2822159	Nice.
2822339	2822579	Winner.
2823479	2825221	Comedy in Orange Lounge chat.
2825601	2826322	OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2826342	2828244	I wonder if that should go in the toilet paper joke book.
2829724	2833065	All right, we're also going to find some comedy in our mailbag right now.
2833105	2835706	At least I don't know if there's any funny stuff in there, but we'll soon find out.
2836246	2846290	Every week you guys send in your emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura picks out her favorites and brings them to us here on Orange Lounge Radio Live each and every week.
2846650	2851272	So it's actually been a little while since we've dived into the mailbag, so we're going to go in there right now.
2852152	2854213	DarkSakura, put on your rubber gloves.
2855093	2855654	Dig in there.
2855674	2856614	I need asbestos this time.
2856814	2857574	Pull something out.
2858715	2858775	Ew!
2859710	2865675	Mailbag at OrangeOnlineRadio.com We actually got a really cool email from Zohar, who is one of our Serbian listeners.
2866776	2875243	Thanks to a little bit of silliness that we had last week regarding ActionScript.org Yeah, weren't we talking about the different translations over there?
2875263	2877445	They had a Serbian translation available, which I was like...
2878683	2878863	Why?
2879523	2883165	Yeah, I think we made an offhanded comment that like, you know, if you need that.
2883386	2888889	No, it was cool, but it struck me as very strange because it's the only technical site I've seen with Serbian translation on it.
2889129	2891930	I mean, it was cool, but I was like, that's so random.
2892070	2893591	You know, that was how I thought.
2894432	2896913	So hope we didn't offend any of our Serbian listeners.
2896953	2898194	We were just kind of surprised.
2898274	2900835	Usually, you know, Spanish, not so surprising when you're here.
2901555	2904137	Russian, Japanese, you know, Serbian?
2905060	2905641	Not so common.
2906041	2911845	Well, most of the time, if there's going to be a site like that, it's either going to already be strictly for that region.
2912766	2918110	So, to read this email, speaking of actionscript.org being in Serbian, I wanted to mention that I am a Serbian listener.
2918551	2922994	I just wanted to say that you guys probably have a lot of listeners in many different races from many different countries.
2923455	2926697	I'm not sure how many Serbian listeners you have, but I just wanted to say that I am one of them.
2927058	2929359	I hope that one day everybody in the world will be listening to OLR.
2929940	2930520	Aw, that's cute.
2930540	2931361	That was very sweet.
2931421	2931921	I'm glad...
2932847	2935729	They're not upset over the comment because we didn't mean it offensively.
2935809	2937490	No, we certainly didn't mean it that way.
2937590	2939812	It was just random.
2940632	2942233	I had an email.
2942253	2947337	This is actually a response to an email complaining about the Wii.
2947837	2949298	It's like what children call urine.
2951079	2951860	Here we go again.
2952601	2959125	I'm going to give this author the benefit of the doubt that the email was written like one or two days after the announcement when those jokes weren't old yet.
2959285	2960426	It was sent by BearWhoDriveCar.
2961480	2962101	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2975925	2977987	console names in video game history.
2978388	2979589	My vote, Dreamcast best.
2980229	2986936	And I had actually replied saying my personal favorite system name is probably Dreamcast as well, although I like PC Engine Duo.
2986996	2987536	It just sounds cool.
2987556	2988577	It rolls off the tongue, you know.
2989078	2992261	Worst ever, Fairchild Channel F, which is also a horrible system.
2993182	2994703	And the Pico, which makes me think of Salsa.
2994964	2995144	Mm-hmm.
2997042	3010599	and then I got a response back it says also I have not heard one female call into your show nor one female guest come on the show since you started taking calls and doing interviews being the only vocal female representation that OLR at least in podcast form presents
3011332	3015894	Do you feel an increased sense of responsibility, DarkSakura, in being the honorary estrogen ambassador?
3016034	3016614	I love that.
3016994	3018455	The estrogen ambassador?
3018755	3024097	Perhaps the awareness of this problem will motivate you to include a segment to promote female awareness on your fine program.
3024437	3028239	I know you guys have discussed the problems and stereotypes that male gamers have toward female gamers.
3028559	3029879	I say the power is yours.
3030440	3032680	Well, I've actually been sort of working on something like that.
3032700	3034041	Just school's kicking my ass.
3034341	3034521	Right.
3034761	3036923	We've had Roz called in just a couple weeks ago, didn't we?
3037163	3037704	We've had Roz.
3037744	3039205	We've had Mistress Tia.
3039445	3040085	Mistress Tia.
3040105	3041606	She's not necessarily a gamer.
3041707	3042267	Here's the thing.
3042607	3044288	But she definitely has estrogen.
3044829	3051294	Most of the girls were on the program before we switched over to this new format where our live show is being podcast.
3051614	3054816	And when we were doing the podcast for the first year, we never had special guests.
3055817	3057638	So we had DDR Angel.
3057758	3060801	We had Iguana Girl, Mistress Tia.
3060941	3062442	So it's just been a while.
3063282	3066605	I'll have to kidnap a few more of my female... We've had Julie.
3067385	3067565	Yeah.
3068006	3069387	But get Iguana Girl on the show.
3069807	3071168	Because I know she's a gamer too.
3071368	3072048	But I know she's been busy.
3072168	3076772	And there's also... Well, she didn't come on the show because it was my birthday thing the other week.
3077152	3081255	But I'll have to bring my good friend Disney Punk 10 up here.
3081515	3081675	Yeah.
3081935	3085918	Because she's into Kingdom Hearts and a lot of the same games that I do.
3086859	3088540	Best console name and worst console name?
3088780	3089881	I have answers, I think.
3090681	3096785	Best console name, you know, I know you might find this a little silly, but I actually really like the name Jaguar for a system.
3096825	3097766	I thought it was kind of cool.
3097786	3098427	It was kind of cool.
3098547	3100508	Even though the system itself kind of stuck.
3100628	3102429	It does have the best version of Tempest.
3103110	3104991	Worst console name, Philips CDI.
3105251	3106512	I mean, that doesn't tell me anything.
3106532	3107453	Yeah, that's not very imaginative.
3107473	3108353	That doesn't tell me anything.
3108574	3109694	It plays CDs.
3111195	3112016	Anything you want to add to that?
3112625	3114787	Well, no, because the Fairchild Channel left.
3114807	3117889	It's like, why am I going to play a channel something?
3118349	3121972	And it was also just a really piece of shit system.
3122052	3124574	Also, another one I thought had a really good name, though, was The Odyssey 2.
3125835	3128036	Because it's like, ooh, it's a gaming journey.
3129137	3131699	In 1978, when I was two years old.
3132059	3132720	Do the math, kids.
3136202	3136582	More mail.
3136863	3137223	More mail.
3138043	3138524	I like mail.
3139244	3140125	I mean, I like mail.
3143062	3153988	I got an email from Rob, who sends a link found on Dig, which I am going to open at this time because I sort of didn't.
3154509	3157951	It was the unluckiest Xbox 360 owner.
3158231	3159572	Oh God, I heard about this guy.
3160629	3165432	who apparently has kept getting a broken system.
3165913	3168094	The guy's name is Chris Zarek.
3170396	3178001	He purchased... He's actually on his fourth Xbox 360 because of quality issues with earlier machines.
3181324	3185527	There's a... Actually, it's something very interesting that was...
3187004	3189125	A nice summary that was posted by Rob in this email.
3189445	3194328	It's like, number one, 5% customer failure, dissatisfaction rate.
3194908	3196089	One bad system, one in 20.
3196169	3197949	Two bad systems, one in 400.
3198350	3199490	Three systems, one in 8,000.
3200071	3204953	To get three in a row that had faulty issues with it?
3206326	3208107	God, and I was pissed when I got the one.
3208447	3212168	Yeah, you either have to be, you know, really lucky or a really big liar.
3212288	3213609	He had the blinking red lights.
3213649	3214929	Go buy a lottery ticket, dude.
3214969	3216750	I'm calling bullshit on this story.
3216790	3218270	I think he's a fucking liar.
3218411	3218851	Really?
3218991	3222672	No, they're sitting with him with the last Xbox and the games.
3222772	3227514	I think he took all the worst possible case scenarios and just made up a damn story about it.
3227534	3232896	From what I'm seeing on here, I think every one of them had the blinking red light issue where it wouldn't turn on.
3233096	3233256	Mm-hmm.
3233621	3233981	and DarkSakura.
3264788	3277095	Also, there was an article that he also sent me from Slashdot about what your next generation system preference says about you.
3279316	3280216	What if I want it all?
3280256	3281217	Does that just make me greedy?
3281980	3282900	Yeah, it makes you very greedy.
3283160	3284060	I guess I'm really greedy.
3285041	3294422	There was a study done with the IGN people that says 36% claim loyalty to the PlayStation 3, 28% to the Xbox 360, 22% are interested in the Wii.
3295122	3296703	Undecided gamers are a minority.
3296763	3298943	Only 4% have not decided.
3299483	3303924	Now there's also lifestyle decisions that are associated with that.
3307845	3309425	I'm just going to go off this chart here.
3310726	3319829	The people who were undecided PS3 and 360, for their favorite handheld is the PSP.
3320509	3322309	For people who are buying the Wii, it's the DS.
3323109	3332212	No shock there, because in order to have put down the Wii when we have not really seen the system at all in any way, you would have to be a Nintendo fanboy.
3333092	3335073	Also, what band do you enjoy most listening to?
3335093	3335993	This is the part I like.
3336613	3339314	The Undecided Group and the Wii Group both are Gorillaz fans.
3341409	3344832	PS3 owners listen to Eminem and Xbox 360 owners listen to Nirvana.
3347354	3348655	What's your favorite TV drama?
3348675	3352177	I guess that means I ain't getting a PS3 because I'm not a big Eminem fan.
3352218	3353098	But the other two are fine.
3353118	3354539	But Eminem, I'm not a big fan of him.
3354559	3355600	This is just statistical data.
3356221	3357361	What's your favorite TV drama?
3358002	3360744	Undecided and Xbox 360 are like lost.
3361244	3362485	PS3 owners like 24.
3363246	3366689	And we potential owners are looking for Smallville.
3368890	3370872	Hey, Smallville is actually decent.
3371371	3374393	Some episodes are kind of crap, but Lex is cute.
3375633	3377934	I know, I'm just shaking my head over here.
3378175	3378955	Hey, I'm trying to read.
3379015	3380956	Just that whole WB thing.
3381977	3384978	One of the questions is, do you own a TiVo or digital video recorder?
3384998	3389300	19% were in the Undecided group, 29% were in the PS3 group, 32% were in the Xbox 360 group, and the Wii group was 24.
3389400	3390161	There's two more sections.
3395471	3397132	have you been to the movies in the last 30 days?
3397212	3404697	the greatest group of these were the PS3 and Xbox 360 players at 64 and 61% respectively and the last is do you own an iPod?
3405178	3421530	and the majority of those were the Xbox 360 group minimum actually a tie between Undecided and PS3 I still think although it's interesting I call BS on this survey because it leaves no room for the people who are still on the fence and considering how little we know there was an Undecided group
3422615	3432139	Considering how little we know about PlayStation 3 and Wii, you're basically asking, whose fanboy are you?
3432279	3433780	Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo.
3433800	3434580	That's what you're asking.
3434600	3437682	Because the only one of those systems you can really say you know something about is the 360.
3439522	3443724	But keep in mind, the vast majority of people are still relatively uninformed.
3444925	3447606	I do like...
3448786	3450286	I'm going over to our chat room for a comment.
3450346	3454928	TigerClaw wants to know, speaking of Smallville, have you guys seen the new Superman Returns trailer?
3454948	3457148	Yes, and I'm hoping that this guy doesn't die or break his neck or fall to the curse.
3457168	3457388	BILLIONS!
3479329	3479589	That's all.
3503334	3504416	Hey, LLR, love the show.
3504456	3505077	Quick question.
3505658	3509605	I was in the store the other day and saw a network adapter for the Nintendo GameCube.
3509665	3510727	What the hell is this for?
3512330	3512850	Not much.
3513131	3513611	Not a lot.
3514291	3516032	Not even a good paperweight because it doesn't weigh much.
3516613	3522536	If you want to play PSO on your GameCube, or not, yeah, PSO, I wanted to say PSU, but that's the new game.
3522957	3526059	If you want to play PSO on your GameCube, that's the reason to have one.
3526159	3535445	Otherwise, this will do nothing for you because Nintendo did not support internet gaming very well with the GameCube, and that's what I say killed them in the competition.
3535465	3540708	I think that's very funny given that they had the Satellaview back in the day in Japan.
3540728	3540808	Yeah.
3540908	3543489	However, using PSO, you could browse the internet, right?
3543689	3544429	I think so.
3544449	3545030	Did I remember right?
3545410	3551912	I don't think they had an actual browsing disk, though, for the GameCube.
3551952	3554153	Well, a lot of the other systems, they actually release browser disks.
3554193	3557835	You know, honestly, though, PSO on the GameCube is worthless.
3557995	3561276	The Xbox version is superior, mostly because of the voice chat.
3562136	3563637	There are other items in the GameCube one.
3564994	3566397	Which are all on Blue Burst.
3566658	3569305	I'm not a big fan of the Nintendo version.
3569325	3572633	There's other things I like about the GameCube, don't get me wrong, but PSO's not one of them.
3573337	3574197	We also have one more email.
3574497	3574777	Okay.
3575097	3579458	From, I guess it's Durley, is how it would be pronounced.
3580638	3581679	First off, love the show.
3581759	3584979	Next, a couple of shows back, you guys talked about a Silent Hill fan film.
3585439	3586659	Any idea where I can get that?
3586739	3587660	Any help would be great.
3588140	3591020	I know this is a busy week, so just drop me a line later if you can.
3591140	3591400	Thanks.
3592260	3593641	Yeah, you can find it on YouTube.
3594541	3595741	You can find everything on YouTube.
3596461	3600722	Well, you can actually download the DVD-I, so from, I don't even remember the site now.
3601661	3605624	If you search for, was it Silent Hill No Escape?
3606004	3607285	Yeah, you should be able to find it.
3607605	3609747	It was pretty decently done.
3609927	3610928	I mean, it was very neat.
3611108	3613450	But if you don't want to bother with download, it's just on YouTube.
3613890	3615331	It's broken up into like seven parts.
3616712	3616892	Yeah.
3618133	3619054	And watch the dog ending.
3620315	3620615	Alright.
3621416	3624538	If you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangetonetrader.com Do it!
3626567	3630409	Loki, Nintendo, big conference this week.
3631029	3633210	People are eagerly anticipating what they're going to say.
3633791	3643796	Exactly, and if you can't make the conference, like us, you can watch it at the official World Store.
3644356	3646197	They're actually going to be streaming it.
3646838	3650480	Starting at 12.30 Eastern to visitors who come in.
3651280	3653421	Space is limited, of course, so first come, first serve.
3654562	3664826	Also, of course, you can view it streaming on practically every other gaming site out there, including if you're in the area, you can watch at the E3 Outpost.
3665887	3666447	So check it out.
3667253	3667493	All right.
3667914	3673859	Yeah, because I believe Scott over at All Games is doing something with GameTrailers.com with the Nintendo press conference.
3674159	3675680	Yeah, they're streaming a game trailer.
3675800	3680264	Which is interesting because that means that, like, you know, tons of people are streaming this Nintendo conference.
3680284	3683987	So it's going to, you know, it goes to show how immediate...
3684387	3688210	You know, people want their news now with this Wii stuff, so this is interesting.
3688370	3688871	Very interesting.
3689591	3690392	I will be watching.
3691733	3700740	If they have it on a big screen at Outpost, which I'm told they're going to, I will be there with my butt parked in the front row couch ready to see this conference, so I'm very excited.
3700981	3702962	Since we're not good enough to get one of the magic tickets.
3702982	3703903	I got nothing else to do.
3703983	3713431	I want to grab McD's, grab some really fatty, something with bacon and eggs, and sit down and watch HDTV in a press conference.
3713491	3713751	That's
3714376	3719136	How I want to spend my week So come down to E3 Outpost and be lazy and fat with us It'll be fun
3720312	3723294	I have a craving for this McDonald's burger.
3723494	3724234	You know what?
3724254	3724955	I want bacon!
3725815	3727536	You're really making me grossed out now.
3727716	3731318	Alright, speaking of lazy and fat, we have a special guest joining us.
3731358	3732178	Say hello to Miklatov.
3732218	3732939	No, I'm kidding.
3732979	3733299	What?
3733619	3734200	I'm kidding.
3734220	3734960	You're a jerk.
3735640	3737021	He's neither lazy nor fat.
3737141	3738162	Your hair is gone.
3738342	3739442	Yeah, it looks like a monkey.
3739782	3741243	You do look like a monkey.
3741283	3741663	Thank you.
3741884	3744505	Miklatov got all his hair cut off today.
3744565	3745846	Can we call you Son Goku now?
3746206	3746506	What?
3746606	3747146	No, that sounds stupid.
3747166	3748247	Because that was the Monkey King.
3748707	3750189	I don't want to be a king of monkeys.
3751130	3752451	You don't look that much like a monkey.
3752511	3753412	I like your hair short though.
3753452	3755674	So Loki doesn't want to be a duck and you don't want to be a monkey.
3755775	3758217	I didn't like your hair long because it made you look like a wet dog.
3758778	3760199	I thought that it was cute long.
3760860	3762421	I'm not a fan of long hair.
3763242	3763943	I liked it too.
3763983	3765805	It was floppy in a cute way.
3766185	3766726	What's that word?
3766746	3767386	Magical.
3767487	3768087	Yeah, that thing.
3768127	3768668	I can't say it.
3769093	3770034	That's what Detangler's for.
3770194	3774719	Real quickly, before we get back in the news, because we're running really long in this segment, we didn't start the show until very late tonight.
3775380	3776181	How's your gaming week going?
3778283	3781186	It's going fine.
3782087	3782407	Okay.
3784690	3786892	Any games of note that you've been playing that you want to share?
3787472	3789535	I've been playing Final Fantasy XI a lot.
3790155	3792016	and then I've been... Added.
3792056	3793756	There you go, because I didn't play at all.
3795017	3796698	And getting ready for E3.
3797378	3801439	Now, for those that may not know, we've been on the show... How could you not know by now?
3801879	3803280	Well, we get new listeners every week, thank God.
3803320	3803780	What's my shirt say?
3803980	3805561	Yes, he's wearing his Konami shirt today.
3805601	3808622	So Mikotov actually works for Konami, but due to NDAs... They've branded you.
3808922	3813484	Due to NDAs, he can't share with us a whole lot of information, but... E3?
3813544	3816885	Yeah, there sure is E3.
3817145	3818926	We gonna have a good time at Konami's booth?
3819637	3821238	Maybe, depends on what you like.
3822439	3823239	Yeah, he ain't budging.
3823979	3824580	He ain't budging.
3824660	3827481	I know, I'm going to have a good time at Nintendo's booth.
3829002	3829182	Why?
3829242	3829923	Why Nintendo?
3829983	3831344	Because I want to play the Wii.
3831384	3832884	So you're not working at Konami's booth?
3833004	3836366	Nope, but I'm going to have all the official Konami attire so I'll look like I'm working.
3836747	3839908	So if you ask me a question, I'm just going to lie and make something up.
3839948	3840509	You're bad.
3840549	3842150	Does your boss listen to this show?
3842170	3842590	I hope not.
3842610	3843350	I don't care.
3843610	3848413	We are having Metal Gear Solid 6 for the... For the Game Boy Advance.
3850237	3852618	We already told you what's going to be at Konami's booth anyway.
3852638	3853798	What?
3854118	3855978	Remember, we had that story a few weeks ago?
3855998	3857999	Yeah, but who says it's true?
3858979	3861959	The latest issue, Nintendo Power confirmed the... I got mine.
3862119	3865800	I don't remember even subscribing or ordering it, but they sent me one.
3865820	3869221	Nintendo Power confirmed the Portrait of Rune thing, but, Loki, you can throw this in now.
3869261	3871281	The Silent Hill thing may have actually been incorrect.
3872121	3874182	I got the name wrong, or they changed the name on me.
3874402	3875702	This is Konami trying to keep on...
3876052	3878293	Keep Me On My Toes, Joystick, Silent Hill Origins
3901207	3903968	Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin Original Sin
3927249	3931451	I know what the big news is.
3932312	3933512	Silent Hill for the GameCom.
3934813	3935794	What's a GameCom?
3936294	3938875	A really piece of shit LCD system.
3939396	3941297	I actually happen to have one of those too.
3941797	3942697	We gotta move on.
3942977	3945719	We're gonna be here through E3 because we'll be taping so long.
3946860	3951142	There is a brand new PlayStation 3 controller that's gonna be unveiled next week.
3951182	3955184	So those of you guys that love the boomerang PlayStation 3 controller, tear up.
3955644	3957327	I wanted to do, like, Batman cosplay with that.
3957347	3957927	Not gonna happen.
3958268	3966438	Well, it says, the rumors abound that it's gonna be unveiled at Sony's press conference, which is Monday night, if I remember, or Monday afternoon.
3966779	3967620	Yeah, Monday 4.
3968041	3969162	Well, we're on the road, so...
3970306	3973548	We'll probably just get into town right about the time that's going on.
3973788	3976669	They're going to have those available for download, though, so we'll watch it later.
3976829	3984994	Yeah, so no idea what it's going to look like, but they're saying that probably going to go back to a more DualShock-style look.
3985794	3986554	I disagree.
3986615	3988996	I think they are going to change something radically about it.
3989076	3990897	It's going to look like a giant schlong.
3991697	3993678	Yeah, I think that boomerang thing was a little weird.
3995519	3998421	It's not going to look like Batman accessories.
3999021	3999221	All right.
3999972	4000673	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4017077	4021759	Sega has posted their E3 lineup, except for the, of course, unannounced stuff.
4021779	4042209	But we have Chromehounds on Xbox 360, working title The Clubs on PS3, Xbox 360, Full Auto 2, Battle Lines, Medieval 2, Total War, Phantasy Star Universe on just about everything under the sun, Sega Rally, Sonic Rivals, Sonic the Hedgehog on PS3 and Xbox 360, Super Monkey Ball Adventure, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz on the Wii,
4043126	4047808	Virtual Tennis 3, oh yay, for all you tennis fans out there, all three of you.
4048248	4052029	Whirlpool Championship 2007, and Yakuza on PS2.
4052389	4055610	Sega's a booth I'm definitely spending more time at this year than I did last year.
4055630	4057591	They've got a pretty solid lineup, it sounds like.
4057611	4058691	I hope they have the chairs.
4059891	4061332	Oh, outside their theater or whatever?
4061352	4063653	No, no, no, no, no, the chairs that were in the theater.
4064493	4065333	Comfy.
4065813	4070735	They had these big theater seats with, like, cup holders and crap, and they were, like, as big as...
4071397	4072778	The chair that's in the studio.
4072878	4078760	There's this theme with you at E3, and that is me and you always seem to pass out in very strange areas at E3.
4078800	4085162	Because I remember there was a picture of us, and I think we were sitting in the corner of some random booth in Kenshi Hall.
4085182	4085722	Sega's room.
4086322	4087963	I didn't go to Sega's room.
4087983	4090544	We were in one of the separate rooms.
4090624	4093565	It was freaking Acclaim's room.
4093625	4094725	Yeah, we passed out there, too.
4095265	4097186	And drinking Coke, the free Coke that was there.
4098701	4101143	And I found... It's all about food and napkin.
4101243	4102504	And I met other people.
4102725	4108570	We decided to camp out on the little staircase outside of Squeenix's little thing.
4109070	4112233	We were just sitting back there talking and apparently... Crap, who was it?
4112253	4112553	I forgot.
4112593	4118778	It was another radio personage or had a homepage who knew somebody I knew.
4119459	4120340	So we were talking about them.
4121842	4131072	It was pretty hilarious, but I ended up also taking a nap somewhere way back behind the SOCOM 3 area.
4131593	4133015	How you nap at E3 is beyond me.
4133035	4134216	All right, we've got to keep going.
4134236	4134857	It was tiring.
4135798	4136338	Loki.
4136398	4136919	Busy girl.
4138280	4147411	This is going to get a little bit outside the realm of gaming, I believe, but there was big DVD news this week, and therefore there's going to be a corresponding game thing going on with it.
4147611	4156561	Well, we knew that LEGO Star Wars 2 was coming out, and LEGO Star Wars 2, the original trilogy, and of course now that since they're re-releasing the original trilogy DVDs on September 12th,
4157062	4158103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4183140	4183740	I love Legos.
4183780	4184240	They're awesome.
4184560	4189302	Actually, the Lego Star Wars games are games I keep meaning to check out that I never do, so maybe I'll get it this time.
4189362	4191023	I have a business proposal for us all right now.
4191163	4191463	Oh, dear.
4192223	4195304	In a few months, we should do a podcast from Legoland.
4196944	4197184	No.
4197204	4198185	Legoland sucks, dude.
4198205	4199765	We don't got the travel budget.
4199925	4202046	Legoland is a lame-ass theme park.
4202066	4204987	You find us some advertisers, we'll be fine.
4205663	4210247	Hey, pay for us to go to Legoland, and we'll say that your product doesn't suck.
4210967	4212288	We go to Knott's Berry Farm, too.
4212328	4213870	We'll just have a crappy theme park.
4214530	4215491	Let's just go to Disneyland.
4216732	4219734	Loki's got a barrage of television and movie game news.
4220195	4221095	Yeah, goody.
4222910	4226711	It's not surprising, everyone's jumping on the bandwagon here.
4227151	4242055	First one we've got coming out, THQ announced The Sopranos is heading to PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 and scheduled to be released this holiday season and of course you get to play all the Sopranos cast and yeah, it's basically Godfather all over again.
4242235	4244416	So look for that, should be fun.
4246216	4247977	Then of course we've got
4248936	4249476	Let's see here.
4249616	4251777	Reservoir Dogs was going to be coming out.
4252338	4256560	And this one actually is being released by some really tiny company.
4256580	4263823	As far as I've read, none of the cast are... I don't know.
4264344	4273208	Quentin Tarantino pretends that this isn't actually going on, that the game's not being made, and just... I don't know.
4273989	4274029	It...
4275140	4275660	It's interesting.
4275680	4282844	They're going to try to go through some of the movie's plot and show you things that you might not have seen in the actual movie.
4283665	4284985	Yeah, so it'll be good.
4285365	4288707	And of course, the one I'm kind of excited about, Scarface.
4289047	4290328	It's going to be coming out this September.
4290988	4294070	And actually, this one looks really sweet.
4294630	4297812	They've got a huge voice cast.
4297852	4299113	Everybody except for Al Pacino.
4299133	4302394	But Al Pacino, he actually picked out his voice actor for this.
4302434	4303295	So you've got...
4303991	4304772	Thanks for watching!
4325216	4327837	That's it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio.
4342922	4351409	Monday you get this show, 183 Part A. Tuesday, not Wednesday, Tuesday you're going to get 183 Part B, so you get it a little early this week.
4351849	4357474	Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, sometime in the evening, you're going to get our live shows that we're doing at the E3 Outpost.
4357774	4362096	If you want to hear us tape these shows live, we're actually going to be doing them at allgames.com.
4362136	4367799	It's not going to be on our own stream just due to technical restrictions, but it will be on allgames.com's feed.
4368279	4370500	6.30ish is the time.
4370880	4376983	That all depends on basically how fast we can get our butts back from the show and upstairs to start taping.
4377023	4378584	That's really what everything relies on.
4378624	4380065	So we're giving ourselves 30 minutes.
4380385	4381705	We hope that's enough time, but we'll see.
4383703	4386105	Alright, we're going to go to a break now.
4386506	4400399	When we come back, we're going to talk about the DS Lite, we're going to talk about Full Auto 2, and Disney doing the DS all week come back with Part B. Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
