5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,900
And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 183 for this May the 7th of 2006 for part B.

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,900
Going to our podcast feed a little bit early this week to make way for the

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,240
podcast we're going to be doing

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,740
from the E3 Outpost Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Very excited about that.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,780
For more information, check out part A or check out our website orangelaunchrader.com

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,660
or E3 on PSP.com, our brand new

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,900
PSP site to bring the E3 experience to your PlayStation Portable.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,380
However, if you're a DS fan, you've got some really good news coming your way

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,620
and that would be the

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,320
new DS that's coming out right Dark Sakura? I like the DS Lite and I want one.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,780
I want one too it looks very sexy. But yeah we've got a release date for the US

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:11,400
on this one. It's going to be released on June 11th for the price of $129.99.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,440
Only the white one is going to be out in the US to begin with although

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,840
they've got three other colors in Japan. They're also going to be releasing on

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:31,840
May 15th and use Super Mario Brothers so I'm gonna wait and see you know yeah

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,320
it's the DS lite but I want to wait for more colors you know I like having a

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,580
selection yeah you know there's gonna be more colors and honestly there's nothing

22
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,200
wrong with the DS I have now fine you say that until you actually see one in

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,760
action you're like holy crap I do you think in Nintendo's booth they'll have

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,720
everything on the DS lite probably oh that might be interesting I'll be an

25
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,160
interesting little like all their demo DS's or DS Lite's? One of my co-workers imported

26
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,280
one and I swear it's the best thing I've ever seen. That all depends though because all

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,720
their demos are going to be on dev kits anyways so... I guess that's true. We'll see. I don't

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,600
think so. But it doesn't matter anyways remember because you can do the firmware hack to get

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,200
the DS Lite brightness on the normal DS.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,780
True, we did mention that last week's show, but a lot of that was over my

31
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,760
head. I'm not gonna

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,040
hack my DS, because I'll break the damn thing. I don't know enough about it.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,320
Haxal? No, not that kind of hacking.

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,080
Loki! A surprising sequel announcement this week.

35
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,240
Yes, Sega announced actually full auto 2, and it's going to be exclusive for the

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,480
PS3.

37
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,720
kind of sucks for me but you know whatever I'm getting all systems anyways

38
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,820
this time around they're finally going to put some sort of deathmatch mode in there

39
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,680
it's going to be kind of arena themed

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,840
I think I guess twisted metal

41
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,280
and it looks pretty sweet I've seen there's actually pictures online now

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,360
they've got three pictures on Xbox

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,560
Oxide or whatever that site

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,600
and it's sweet looking so I can't wait to

45
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,440
you know, check that one out. You know what's interesting is a lot of the news

46
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,960
sites where I saw that news on kind of took the opportunity to bash full auto

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,080
one as being a bad game but I kind of enjoyed it, it was fun.

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,440
I mean it's not the best thing ever. It had flaws but you know what, the second one will be better.

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,400
Well isn't that usually the case with games? Usually.

50
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Not always, usually.

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,920
All right, uh, Xbox Live is of course they had a big patch this week and

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,200
assuming that they're gearing up for their big E3 showing

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,600
They're going to have an awful lot of stuff coming up for E3, including demos and trailers

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:51,480
for Test Drive Unlimited, MotoGP 06, Crackdown, Dead or Alive Xtreme 2, The Lord of the Rings

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,700
The Battle for Middle Earth 2, Lost Planet, Sonic the Hedgehog, Splinter Cell Double Agent,

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,480
and Viva Pinata.

57
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,600
Also they're saying a flood of HD trailers from games that have yet to be announced.

58
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,000
Maybe Halo 3?

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,600
And also they're going to have HD trailers for movies as well.

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,960
Not too much of a surprise there.

61
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,100
I kind of wish the Xbox 360 front end was built a little more to handle a lot of stuff

62
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,720
because scrolling through a big list is going to be annoying, I think, but that's just me.

63
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,820
Unless they do like a page that's going to be all E3 stuff, but even still.

64
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,280
Now remember, that doesn't necessarily mean they're all playable demos, just some of them.

65
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Demos, trailers, we don't know which.

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,980
Lost Planet is going to be a demo.

67
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,640
That's cool.

68
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,920
And they're going to have, what was the other thing that they were going to have, I think

69
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,160
the Top Spin 2 demo just came out.

70
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,600
And World Cup Soccer was another one they were talking about releasing a demo for.

71
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,040
I think it's going to be very interesting to see what sort of effect the Xbox Live integration

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
of E3 is going to have.

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,440
UNO is coming out.

74
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,480
Oh I heard about that, UNO is coming out next week as part of a celebration for E3.

75
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:07,840
But yet no Street Fighter II, still not out.

76
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,520
Massive problems with that game, I hear.

77
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,160
Interesting.

78
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Well fix em!

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Get that game out!

80
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,400
Stop teasing us.

81
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,800
Loki, something new coming out for the DS?

82
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,640
Yes, Disney actually has a new exclusive title for the DS called Spectrobes.

83
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:33,160
And you know, it's supposed to be infused with edgy, highly stylized look and feel of

84
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:40,040
a Japanese anime or manga series with a unique original character sprite and a compelling

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,400
storyline and breakthrough gameplay.

86
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Right.

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:51,720
And it says, the game allows players to excavate and train in battle with nearly 500 unique

88
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,480
characters.

89
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,080
So it sounds kind of like, almost like a Pokemon game.

90
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,280
They actually have a game coming out right now that's called, oh god, some stupid ass

91
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,520
game where you dig up dinosaur bones and you re- basically like if Jurassic Park were to

92
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,280
have sex with Pokemon, this is the game you would get.

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,920
It's just weird.

94
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,880
Uh, okay.

95
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,160
I forgot, I brought out the emulators this week and I played Jurassic Park on the Super

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,920
Nintendo because I wanted to show somebody the scary first-person mode

97
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:31,240
which is really bad but anyway that game was fun I don't know so yeah it's gonna

98
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,040
be coming out and probably at Buena Vista's booth this year all right

99
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,000
Dark Sakura likes to travel the world from her computer because she loves you

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,720
UK listeners as well as everybody you know it doesn't matter where you're at

101
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,500
she loves you all but UK has a release calendar of their own the UK has a

102
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,100
a release date calendar of their own and Dark Soccer would like to share some upcoming UK

103
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
release dates.

104
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,300
Yes, we have special things coming out.

105
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,540
On the 12th we have City Life for PC, Dreamfall The Longest Journey, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary

106
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:13,300
for PC, Pac-Man World 3, Sin Episodes Emergence, Time Shift Brain Age coming out on the DS

107
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
on the 19th.

108
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,580
A couple more things on the 19th, Fire Department 3.

109
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,300
I thought that game was like massively delayed.

110
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,380
Time Shift is apparently slated for PC and Xbox 360 on the 12th.

111
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,460
And Pac-Man World 3 on PSP on the 19th.

112
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,320
It was originally supposed to be on the 12th, but the problem was is it got

113
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,980
put under a different, it's actually

114
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,700
VinVidi Universal releasing it, or I'm sorry, VinVidi

115
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,100
that's releasing it now instead of Atari.

116
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,540
Perhaps the calendars weren't updated, who knows, we'll see. I would actually like to hear

117
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,480
from our UK listeners let me know how the rainbow islands revolution turned

118
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,920
out it was released on the fifth so um is that's not that was Friday so if

119
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,220
anyone picked it up let me know what you think about it I'd love to hear your

120
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:05,320
review because I haven't I'm curious about it too that's it okay not a lot

121
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,760
sorry I think I don't think a whole bunch is gonna come out during e3 no no

122
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,720
obviously not but I thought Loki humor us anyway is there anything coming out

123
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,120
Coming out for the U.S. There's just jack shit coming out for the U.S. No, the only

124
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,880
real game that's coming out is Over the Hedge and that's coming out on most systems. You

125
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:31,080
do have the, was it the Guitar Hero SG controller coming out which is I guess kind of interesting.

126
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:39,360
On, what was it, I believe Gallop Racer was coming out, oh wait that might have been last

127
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,480
week. There really isn't anything this week. This week was pretty much a throwaway week.

128
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Well yeah, not too surprising. NBA Ballers Rebound was coming out. Was it Dark Soccer's

129
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,280
Night Warriors Alpha? The UMD release of it is coming out, which by the way our company

130
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:06,720
has exclusive rights to. And Tringo on the Game Boy Advance is coming out, so yeah. Save

131
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,520
I gave all your mining for next week, that's what I say.

132
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Alright.

133
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,760
Loki, as games are coming out for the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360, developers have some surprising

134
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,400
news and rumors with these systems.

135
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:25,000
Well, I'm not too surprised by it, but the developers of Chronicles of Riddick, Butcher's

136
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,440
Bay a while back, they're working on a game right now called The Darkness, for both the

137
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,480
360 and PS3, and what they've basically commented on is that they said the PS3 will have a content

138
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:42,840
size and CPU advantage, the Xbox 360 has a slight GPU advantage, but basically they expect

139
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:51,120
that the screenshots will be impossible to tell the 360 from the PS3 apart. So, it's

140
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,960
gonna be like, I remember how they used to do that in GamePro where they'd have screenshots

141
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,740
of the Super Nintendo and Genesis versions, so we'll hopefully start seeing that again.

142
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,220
I think that, personally I think though, that we're going to see differences.

143
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,180
I think the PS3 is going to end up being better.

144
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,500
Oh, well that's, we'll see this week,

145
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,540
hopefully, hopefully. It's all how you, I've seen a lot of stuff, I mean look at God of War

146
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,020
on the PlayStation 2, you can really, you know, push out a lot of

147
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:26,220
graphics and quality in some of these systems, you just have to know how to program for them, so.

148
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,900
I don't think we've seen the best of Xbox 360 yet either.

149
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
Long shot, so we'll see

150
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,000
You may not have seen the best of the PSP or the DS yet as well

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,680
There are rumors abounding that Vonage, you know that broadband phone company

152
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,080
Vonage is apparently making software that is going to allow

153
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,680
PSP and DS users to turn those handheld systems into VOIP phones

154
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
Now if you think about it

155
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,680
That means your handheld would basically be a phone that you could use anywhere that there's Wi-Fi like an engage first

156
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,320
We had the taco and now we have the quesadilla and what is the DS a clam? I think quesadilla

157
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,680
I like I was sticking with the Mexican food reference. It's a clam. I still think it's a taco

158
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
I mean you kind of like put it back together

159
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,160
Doesn't matter. Anyways, the engage isn't finished. All the engage will rule the world

160
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:22,360
Say yeah, and I'll be fine. No, I think I think engage should be the first booth that we do a video

161
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,060
presentation from for the E3 on PSP site. We should totally do like in Wayne's World.

162
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,260
Hi, we're at the N-Gage booth. No, you know what? We're making Bobby cover

163
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,940
N-Gage. I'll cover the N-Gage booth. I want to find

164
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,260
out what is so wonderful about this. And, you know, it's basically we're just going

165
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,460
to ask them the questions. Why should I buy an N-Gage? Because cell phone games rock?

166
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,820
No, I'm sorry, that's not the correct answer. Why should I buy an N-Gage?

167
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,460
cuz you like tacos oh my god you're a lover is so corny

168
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,940
now why should we but oh sorry be over IPS p

169
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,100
go her

170
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,060
where we're doesn't matter anyways they're gonna be doing it that was one

171
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,580
the attachments that they're gonna be adding to the PSP

172
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,780
so that's not really a surprise no but you know Vonage

173
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,940
probably wants a piece of that cuz they're still I don't know if they're

174
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,420
struggling but they're still trying to

175
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,020
really get out there and be a major player so yeah this could be huge for

176
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,000
most it all

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,860
you know what they need to do? They need to be pushing Wi-Fi all over the

178
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,340
United States then because

179
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,740
you know I can tell you right now walking around I can't find that many

180
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,220
hot spots. Santa Clara though, they got free Wi-Fi everywhere that's

181
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,340
awesome. That's pretty cool. It's covered the entire city. Rumor is that's supposed to

182
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,260
happen in

183
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,580
one of our suburbs, Roseville. We'll see.

184
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,780
Alright, let's go to another story, Loki.

185
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,300
Another interesting game to be shown at E3. Cooking Mama.

186
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,280
It's actually going to be part of Majesco's lineup at E3.

187
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,780
And this game is basically based on the kind of the minigame niche

188
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,860
out there and you're basically cooking entrees and stuff using the DS.

189
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,100
And I think that's kinda cool. Probably see something like that on the Wii.

190
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,660
There's a ticket game like that. Where you flip the egg.

191
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,540
You know, and I honestly I don't like reading all these stories about food

192
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:25,240
because I'm so hungry right now mmm bacon looking forward to eating tomorrow

193
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,860
I had an organic mushroom and leek strudel today I like mushrooms they're

194
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,980
really tasty mmm let's play what did you eat today I we went to Red Robin and I

195
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,060
had a bacon or no I didn't have a I had a Western Western barbecue burger it was

196
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:47,940
very good. You kind of were. I ate the barbecue burgers, but I had leftover... You can't make

197
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,280
one of those in Cooking Mama. Alright, anyway. Cooking Mama. Moving on, since somebody brought

198
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,020
up the end gauge earlier... I was going to mention though, real quick. What? Real quick.

199
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:02,280
Do you notice, it is Cooking Mama, because, you know, women in the kitchen... In the kitchen.

200
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,280
You know what? Explain, you know, freakin' Emeril, okay?

201
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Woman in disguise. He's crazy.

202
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,280
What about the galloping gourmet? Woman in disguise. Iron Chef.

203
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Women in disguise. No, no, no, no, no. They have a woman in Iron Chef, but she's more of a man.

204
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,280
She's vowed to show that she's a woman in cooking.

205
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:30,280
We're gonna get hate, man. I, I, okay, I like, this is, this is me as estrogen ambassador, okay?

206
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,720
Like to cook however, I don't I make my husband make me dinner

207
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,200
Woman in disguise. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

208
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,600
He knows his place. All right anyway

209
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,860
Moving on we were talking about the engage. I thought this was hilarious. Joystick ran an article this week

210
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,880
It says mobile market shows signs of stagnation and what was my reaction a

211
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,360
You know why?

212
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,320
Here, I don't even have to read the article because mobile games are not that great.

213
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,800
I'm sorry, they're just not that fun.

214
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,360
They're really not that fun and I feel bad because I know people that develop

215
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,560
for like mobile games and stuff and I know they're trying very hard at what

216
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,400
they do and everything

217
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,680
but I guess they just are catered for a certain market that's not me.

218
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,640
Mobile gaming? Because as a hardcore gamer I really don't like mobile games.

219
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,760
Mobile gaming is about as cool as talking on one of the cell phones from

220
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,860
the eighties

221
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,460
today.

222
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,800
Well anyway, here's the actual chunk of the story here. A research firm

223
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,400
Mmetrix published data in March 2006 from a mobile gamer's perspective.

224
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,240
They're saying that the number of mobile gamers is remaining constant month on

225
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,740
month

226
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,820
with only a tiny fraction of mobile users.

227
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,260
0.5 percent downloading their first game in March.

228
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,980
The percentage of phone users who use their handset for downloadable games is low.

229
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,980
The US 2.7%.

230
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,740
Now given the millions and millions of mobile phones in the market, that's still a lot of

231
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,460
people and many of them are repeat customers, but there's really not a lot of reasons to

232
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,500
buy new titles and they're not exactly cheap and it kind of puts people off.

233
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,980
Well, it's just like spending five dollars on a game that actually a flash game would

234
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
be better than.

235
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,740
mean it's just imagine trying to go out there and sell like games made from

236
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:33,180
basic for like $10 a pop and so maybe the mobile game community will prove us

237
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,980
wrong with a real bang up title we all have to own but I'm not holding my

238
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:46,580
breath sorry yeah all right moving on Loki what's not gonna be at e3

239
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,380
Diablo 3, not at E3.

240
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,040
People started to think that it might actually be at E3 because there is an

241
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,740
advertisement on IGN, of course.

242
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:02,380
Someone accidentally let that slip through there in their editing department.

243
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,040
High hopes.

244
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,900
Not at E3, huh? That makes me sad.

245
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,380
That makes me very angry, and you know what happens when people get angry?

246
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,440
They turn into the Hulk?

247
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,580
No, it's time for the FUs of the week.

248
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,600
that's where dark sakura turns into the she-hulk

249
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,740
no no no i am not a green skin tall attorney

250
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:29,740
thank you

251
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,480
my f u of the day

252
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,720
goes towards this stupid kid

253
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,120
and a mustang

254
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,340
now i love the mustang i love old mustangs especially i like the very new ones

255
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,640
This guy's was like a dirty convertible one. He was like probably 16 really stupid had like some blonde

256
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,860
stupid looking girl with him and

257
00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:00,480
I am I will tell you where it is if anyone in this area will know it was as I was going

258
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,560
From downtown. I had just passed the

259
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,860
Where the Elkhorn entrance onto the freeway goes right before antelope

260
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,700
You have that long ass merging lane. I mean, this is a really long merging lane

261
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,780
so I was well ahead of the guy and then he starts beating up trying to nose in

262
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:25,900
front of me and I'm already going 80 okay I mean 65 miles an hour 80 and so

263
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,820
finally he still keeps going and I'm blowing on my horn and finally I had to

264
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:36,460
just drop back and honk at him so he cut over to the other lane and I you know

265
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,580
freaking told him off and then cut him off so uh that was my a few of the

266
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,500
to stupid children who don't know how to drive.

267
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Loki.

268
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,900
Um, fuck you to the stupid DJ who, like, screwed everything up from playing wrong music to

269
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,500
playing music we didn't want him to play, to playing, you know, doing the electric slide

270
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:04,420
which we said we didn't want him to do, to tuning his inflatable electric guitar while

271
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:11,460
he was playing the wrong music, to getting my name wrong, to just being a complete dumbass

272
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:17,340
and jackass. If you ever are looking for a DJ and you happen to be in the Sacramento

273
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:23,820
area, stay away from hot tracks. Horrible. By the way, he has some weird relationship

274
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,700
with his sister whose name is Tink. Cuckoo! Crazy! Yeah. I send those cards and letters

275
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,700
to Loki. Do views and opinions expressed by Loki do not necessarily reflect those of the

276
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,460
staff? Oh come on, you agree, he was a retard. Uh, I did not enjoy myself as much as I could

277
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:45,380
have. Let's put it that way. Dan kept cracking jokes about it. He offered money to anyone

278
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,260
who would go over and grab his inflatable guitar and beat him over the head with it.

279
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,440
But your wedding was still great. Yes it was. We were even talking about this on the way

280
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,920
home. I'm sorry we had to leave early because you know about Dan's knee. No. Dan got run

281
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,060
over when he was younger and basically had his knee put back on so it hurts him all the

282
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:08,580
time and it was hurting him really bad so we had to go home. I thought I told you. Anyway.

283
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,580
Now all our millions of listeners know now too.

284
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:20,260
We were talking about how we really enjoyed the ceremony, it was very nice.

285
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,400
We thought it was especially cool that you had the tradition pulled in that the family

286
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,740
wanted but were able to do everything themselves.

287
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,420
I just like seeing Dan and Iamaka.

288
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,400
That was hilarious.

289
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:42,480
My FU of the Week goes to FlightDelays, Miklotov, any FUs of the Week?

290
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:49,600
FU to the whole state of Hawaii, hate you all, hope you burn, maybe Japan will get lucky

291
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,400
one of these days and actually hit you correctly with a bomb.

292
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Wow!

293
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,200
He addressed those cards and letters to Miklotov, just asked for him by name in the forums.

294
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,120
You don't have an orange card on your sheet mail do you?

295
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Oh no, do I?

296
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,120
We'll give out your email address for all those Hawaiians that we haven't listened to this show, which I'm sure this is new.

297
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Send it to the mailbag and I'll forward it all.

298
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Yeah, just send it to mailbag and uh...

299
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Hopefully by the time they hear this, the bomb is hitting their house.

300
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,120
Or the volcano's erupting. Those dirty, dirty, baby-eating savages.

301
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Dr. Sakura, please take us away with an actual relating-to-the-news-type story. That would be wonderful.

302
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
We do news here?

303
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Once in a while we are known to do that.

304
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,120
What do we do that for?

305
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Can we drop the Wii controllers on her now?

306
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Okay, well I do have a little bit of news.

307
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Basically, Konami is doing the big pitch

308
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,120
for the DDR for school.

309
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,120
So like, because they were so successful in West, what was it, West Virginia or wherever?

310
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,120
So what, they're trying to sell all the other states now on this?

311
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:11,920
public school curriculum. Don't look at me like that. I got an F in DDR. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Keep in mind they've done this has been done at other

312
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,880
schools with a very high success rate. A lot of people have actually gotten in

313
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,640
better shape and lost weight through playing DDR. I at first you know

314
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,920
because I moved out here got happy you know got really fat and then started

315
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,120
playing DDR and dropped 20 pounds over a summer so I can vouch for personal

316
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,160
experience you know but um I think it's a really good thing although I do like

317
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,720
the little comment from here talking about looking for all the YouTube and

318
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:49,040
Google videos about their classmates playing DDR Oh God Wow comedy I still

319
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,680
can't wait for you to come home I got an F in DDR yeah you don't hear them

320
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,800
pitching in the groove to the schools yeah what you mean they got an E in DDR

321
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:07,700
why aren't we failed you should practice in a closet I think my PE

322
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,920
teacher should be the nurse from solo 2000 oh she's so amazing I can't stand

323
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:20,180
it I want to marry her all right so check that out in a classroom near you

324
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,260
if Konami gets their way I'm glad I'm in college hmm why would Konami want that

325
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,900
to be in every classroom. Oh yeah, money. Yeah. Loki! Something else that we hope is

326
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,800
gonna make money, or somebody's hoping makes money. Alone in the Dark, but not the movie.

327
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,000
Not the movie. They're talking about possibly, was it Eden Games? They've decided to adopt

328
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,240
an episodic format for its next gen sequel to Alone in the Dark. And it's gonna be chopped

329
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,620
down. The episodes each contain about 30-40 minutes of gameplay that ends with a cliffhanger

330
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,300
and preview of things to come. Wow.

331
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,460
Yeah, I've never been so, eh, in my life.

332
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,980
Sounds like Shenmue except somehow worse.

333
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,580
I think it sounds interesting. I like the idea of an episodic- It sounds okay but how

334
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,340
expensive is this

335
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,300
gonna be? I mean- You said 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay? 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay

336
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,700
each episode. Each episode would probably be about five bucks on Xbox Live or something like that.

337
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,780
about think about people who buy like DVD shows you know and that's the same

338
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,540
type of thing you watch a couple episodes you take a break come back

339
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:32,460
people watch 24 on DVD that's what save points were invented for you know I

340
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,180
don't get it and neither does even good I think it's an interesting idea if done

341
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,680
right it might be neat it's under $10 an episode thing then that's okay but well

342
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,580
if the game's good I mean it depends on good the game is I don't pay $10 for 30

343
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,980
minutes of gameplay this shit better be like two bucks even less nine is like I

344
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,660
to iTunes charges about 99 for a 40-minute TV show how about I like a

345
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,540
buck 99 should be the price we'll see though how about the game not suck first

346
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,140
and let's just figure out you know all right we're gonna run down some lineups

347
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,860
that are gonna be at e3 some things that were announced this week Loki THQ yes

348
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,660
THQ we mentioned them a little bit earlier they're gonna be having Saints

349
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,660
It's Rho, which is going to be pretty sweet, and I hear that may be a demo coming to Xbox

350
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,660
Live.

00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:26,340

352
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,780
Smackdown vs. Raw 07, and I know that's going to be there, because actually I think some

353
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,940
of the wrestlers are going to be there as well promoting it.

354
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,280

361
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,920
Destroy All Humans 2, which looks sweet, and that's actually going to be on current gen

362
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:28,440
PlayStation 2 and Xbox, SpongeBob SquarePants Creature from the Krusty Krab, which is going

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:35,720
to be on PlayStation 2, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PC, DS, and the Wii, Monster House,

364
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,900

368
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:03,080
Alright, Ubisoft's got an interesting E3 lineup this year, Splinter Cell Double Agent will

369
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,280

370
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,320

374
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:37,640
Xbox 360. Also, Ubisoft is supposed to do some type of next-gen and PC game from the

375
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,320
folks who did TimeSplitters, but not a lot of more details.

376
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,240
Oh, but TimeSplitters 4.

377
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,320
We'll see.

378
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,000
TimeSplitters is fucking awesome.

379
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,360
We'll see. And of course, a big, big name every year,

380
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
Logie.

381
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,480
EA. They're going to be showing off Army of Two for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360, Battlefield

382
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,560
2142 for the PC, Command & Conquer 3, Tiberian Wars on the PC, Crysis on the PC, which is

385
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:23,560
Cube, Playstation 2, Playstation 3, PSP, the Wii, the Xbox, and the Xbox 360, I think that

386
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:31,560
about covers everything except for PC on there, NASCAR 2007 on the PSP, Orcs and Elves on

387
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,480
mobile games, Spore for the PC and I think that's actually on the portable systems too

388
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,420
but I'm not sure if they're going to show them, Superman Returns which got delayed to

389
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:45,240
September that coincided with the DVD release, that's going to be on almost every single

390
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,880
system, only next gen system though is going to be the 360 and no GameCube for that, and

391
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,520
other sports titles are going to be, you know, patched over to the mobile games as well.

392
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,280
I know the Wii Madden is supposed to be pretty neat. They're going to have kicking drills

393
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,280
and passing drills and stuff like that, so it should be pretty cool.

394
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:11,280
All right. I thought we could have a little bit of a roundtable here. Top three things

395
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:17,360
we are looking forward to at E3 besides the Wii and the PlayStation 3. Those are the easy

396
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:25,800
answers. Anybody want to go first? Anybody? Alright, Mikl Tov. Lumines2 for the PSP. Is

397
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:32,040
that your number one? No. Okay, you're number three? Excuse me, 321. Yeah, well, can't we,

398
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:38,720
can I have time to think about my two-in-one? Loki. I'm actually kind of excited about seeing,

399
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,600
well, I was hoping to see Take-Two's lineup this year because I would have been looking

400
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:51,400
forward to seeing Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories, but assuming I probably won't see

401
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:59,300
that, I guess the next best thing would probably be seeing a Wii version of WarioWare, because

402
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,300
that looks like fun.

403
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,760
Which, as I understand, someone in chat just told me that it has been confirmed by Time

404
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Magazine.

405
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Yeah, Time Magazine story.

406
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,920
That and some type of tennis game should be interesting.

407
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,180
Doc Sakura.

408
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,180
taking a nap under Squeenix's movie theater?

409
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,180
I'm serious!

410
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,900
My number three would be the DDRs.

411
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,820
There's so many of them that I'm very curious to see what's going to happen there.

412
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,940
Assuming we're right, but we are.

413
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,340
Miggletop, number two.

414
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:33,180
My number two would be Luminous for PS2.

415
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:39,540
Loki, Ridge Racer 7 for the PS3.

416
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
Very interested to see that.

417
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,180
Good pick. Dark Sakura. Konami. Just everything.

418
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,180
Yeah I'm just gonna you know I'm probably gonna find somewhere I can

419
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,980
sleep over there too.

420
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,020
Okay. Like in one of those little things at the door

421
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,580
I just call in and take a nap. Sounds good. My number two would be

422
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,180
Final Fantasy 13. I'm still kinda hoping that some hints are dropped with that.

423
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,300
I'm gonna see that. Squeenix.

424
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,380
I want it. You know Squeenix gotta have some type of surprise.

425
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,340
Cuz their list was not that. They had seven remakes. Chrono Trigger 3.

426
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,940
before crisis core and uh... you think the seven remakes seven remake uh...

427
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,220
crisis core

428
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,740
the uh...

429
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,140
what the fuck is that stupid one that's on cell phones right now uh... before crisis

430
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,740
before crisis

431
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,660
it's going to be ported to the psp

432
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,940
uh... indurgiservice

433
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,580
indurgiservice is coming out next month or not next month uh... two months from now

434
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,280
july so

435
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,460
course it's already out in japan

436
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,940
number ones

437
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,380
Something at Konami that I can't say, I'm sorry, but I will be there a lot for it.

438
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,500
Alright, Logi.

439
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,820
There's so much there, but uh...

440
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,900
You know, I'm very interested to see...

441
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,220
Just a lot of stuff from the PS3, actually. The game I've been looking forward to,

442
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,500
Motorstorm.

443
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,780
I'm looking forward to playing that game, because that looks fucking sweet, but uh...

444
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,660
Yeah, that's just too much.

445
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,420
I'm looking forward to seeing which Japanese gaming celebrity I'm going to run into this

446
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
year.

447
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,540
I'm hoping for Yuji Naka.

448
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm looking forward to seeing Paris Hilton at her booth trying to promote some cell phone

449
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,700
game and asking her stupid questions and getting it all on film.

450
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,060
Rob, you should get her autograph.

451
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,060
We'll see.

452
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,500
Miek LaTos stole my number one.

453
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,940
My number one was the Luminous Games when they were coming out.

454
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,940
Mine is three on mine.

455
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,940
Well, because you suck.

456
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
Well, that's better stuff.

457
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,940
Dear Squeamix.

458
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,500
We want chrono trigger for the DS and we want like an ein hander, too

459
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,580
Yes, ein hander too would be the best thing ever

460
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,460
That game out not too long ago

461
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,660
They're gonna make an ein hander game and you know since they don't really want to do that much work for

462
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,520
Ported over to the PSP or a better system

463
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,740
Comments in the chat room because I don't want to ignore you guys. I'm sorry

464
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,940
Tetris DS maniac 64 says Duke Nukem forever. Oh, yeah

465
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,060
I hope to see that there.

466
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:11,140
Let's see, 23rd Magus says fucking Starcraft Ghost, although wasn't that cancelled?

467
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,140
That's not coming out.

468
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,140
Sorry to say.

469
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,100
On current gen at least.

470
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,100
Maybe later.

471
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,260
GS191 says Squeenix should just remake the whole damn FF series.

472
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
Give it time.

473
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,420
Well you have Final Fantasy 3 going to be shown there I think.

474
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,940
That's true.

475
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:34,940
Final Fantasy, uh, what was it, uh, five and six? I think? Yeah.

476
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Moving on. More stuff. Loki. A website I used to visit an awful lot. I don't know if I want

477
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,100
to visit it anymore. Why would this be? Me too. Alakazam. It used to be a really good

478
00:33:54,100 --> 00:34:01,100
website that was actually pretty much a hub for anything online.

479
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:07,420
Meaning games, like Final Fantasy XI. Online games, yeah, like MMOs and stuff. The thing

480
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:14,260
is though, is they just got bought out. And they got bought out by a website called ZAM.

481
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:21,260
The ZAM Network, Z-A-M, which happens to be also owned... there's a bunch of different

482
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,260
There's a bunch of different chains of websites

483
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,260
But it all comes back to one website that really gets people's pains in a bunch and that would be I GE

484
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,400
Which is best known for kill selling gold selling you name it they sell it. Ooh

485
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,420
Yuck and they own that website now, so

486
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,500
sucks if you're still visiting that because

487
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,660
yeah, lots of

488
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,660
Lots of problems there.

489
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Miklotov, you surf Alakazam. What's the reaction been like there?

490
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Um, everybody's angry and most of the posts I saw said that everybody was canceling their premium accounts

491
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,660
as soon as they run up for the month.

492
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,660
So not too many people are happy about this, I guess.

493
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,660
Yeah, that's right. Alaz was selling the premium accounts.

494
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,660
Yep. And I was like, oh, it funds the Dirty Gil sellers. Time to quit.

495
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,820
I still like Alakazam because it has information but

496
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,500
I'm not gonna pay them money. I didn't want to pay them money in the first place.

497
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,620
Yeah, I wouldn't pay them money either. I can still use their search feature. Internet is free!

498
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,180
It is. Zero. $9.95. That's free. How do you feel about

499
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,740
Gil selling gold? I don't care. I don't care about it.

500
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,860
Yeah.

501
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,860
You know if somebody were screwing up Ragnarok's economy that same way you'd care about it

502
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,780
mighty quick I bet.

503
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,780
I don't play on I.R.O.

504
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,780
Oh, so you're stealing your Ragnarok.

505
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,780
I'm not stealing my Ragnarok. Somebody else is stealing it.

506
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
You're just borrowing it.

507
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
Pouring them out.

508
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,780
You know though, like on our new server in Final Fantasy,

509
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,780
I haven't heard anybody talk about any Gil sellers whatsoever.

510
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,780
Good, maybe they're all gone.

511
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,780
Or they're not a problem on this server.

512
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,780
We'll see.

513
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,780
Alright, Dark Soccer likes to surf the internet up and down

514
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,780
and find a good website that does deserve your attention.

515
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,280
going to sell out to gill sellers or gold sellers. Dark Sakura, what website did you

516
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,680
pick this week? This is actually one of the sites that I think is pretty cool is Silent

517
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,320
Hill Heaven. I go there all the time looking at pictures and stuff and it's pretty cool.

518
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,040
You can get pictures of weapons from the endings, screen captures, fan art, and they even have

519
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:36,040
a translation on here that they were working on for the Silent Hill Play Novel. For anyone

520
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,720
who's probably heard me mention this before, the play novel was Japan only on

521
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,040
the Game Boy and it was running through two scenarios. One where you play as

522
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,720
Harry and the other one where you play as Sybil, which from what I understand

523
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,720
there was actually supposed to be a scenario with Sybil in the first game

524
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:02,120
that never made it in. So this is more what her story was like along different

525
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,840
ending lines not all of it is there only part of it is there but it's pretty cool

526
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:12,080
they're working on it they also like I mentioned have tons of pictures tons of

527
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,280
information they have stuff from the DVDs the lost memories and art of Silent

528
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,880
Hill fanfic gallery I'm sorry fanfic archive fan art gallery all kinds of

547
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,900
don't think anyone was writing that down with a pen very fast.

548
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,420
Shall we go to the telephones, the Skyplines, and see who's calling us today?

549
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,860
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

550
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,620
How's it going guys?

551
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:06,540
Hi, who's this? It's DMN. Hi DMN, turn down your outgoing a little bit, we can

552
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,260
hear ourselves.

553
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,740
What's on your mind?

554
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,900
Not much, I have a couple of bits of

555
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,660
news out of the Nintendo camp that I think I can share without getting my

556
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,540
head cut off

557
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,340
ooh I like this I like this controversial news

558
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,940
I hope one of them is what I think it is well let's see what can you share with

559
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,420
us

560
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,820
I can share some price news

561
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:36,740
I've been the $79.99 I've been hearing floating around

562
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,060
quite some time so likely I've been hearing about

563
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,540
mid-august that might happen

564
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:50,060
Also, when the DS Lite is released, it is likely that the regular DS model will drop

565
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,460
to $99.99.

566
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,860
But other than that, I really haven't heard any other news.

567
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,460
Where were you guys at Sakura Con?

568
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:08,100
Actually, can you confirm about Osutata Kai and Don being bought out as elite task agent?

569
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,980
I've heard nothing of that.

570
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,180
I heard a rumor about that today, too.

571
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:17,020
Okay, so that's very cool though, those rumors about the DS, well I guess not so much rumors

572
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,860
at this point, but the DS coming down to 99, the old school one, and the GameCube going

573
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,740
down to 79.99.

574
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,860
Very cool.

575
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,460
I think I heard in there as well, where the hell were you at SakuraCon?

576
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,620
It just came up a little late for us, but we will definitely try to get up there next

577
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,780
year because I miss Seattle, I really do like it up there.

578
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,180
I'm actually planning on going to Vancouver at the end of June.

579
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,180
I've really wanted to get a soccer cup for a while.

580
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,180
I will arrange a few passes.

581
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,180
You will arrange what?

582
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,180
I'm repeating game manager this year.

583
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,180
I can arrange for some passes for you guys.

584
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,180
Sweet! We like passes.

585
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,180
Do they get us backstage so we can meet rock stars?

586
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,180
Um, we'll see.

587
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,180
Sweet! Awesome.

588
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,180
DMN, thanks so much for calling in.

589
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,180
Is there anything else you want to get out before we hang up on you?

590
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,680
Um, no. Alright, then have a good one!

591
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,520
Thanks for calling. Well we appreciate that. A little bit of the

592
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:23,640
insider knowledge there on Nintendo. Awesome. Let's see, let's go and answer

593
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,720
this one. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Sorry.

594
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,560
Okay, something exploded right as someone picked up the phone. It sounded like someone dropped a keyboard.

595
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,080
Wow! Someone set us up the bomb. Who's this? Hi, this is Sephiroth1215.

596
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,480
Hi Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

597
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,040
First off, I was wondering,

598
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,280
will we be doing actual good coverage

599
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,740
for the

600
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,920
Imani series this year?

601
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,160
Our coverage will be mediocre on all levels.

602
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm just saying,

603
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,840
because usually all sites, all other sites, they

604
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,200
barely say anything about it, they don't really pay attention to games like DDR, so...

605
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,400
You should actually look at our gallery and look at the twenty

606
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,860
Thousand photos I took at Konami's booth last year. We will not ignore Bahmani. Don't worry

607
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,460
We plan on doing a very extensive coverage of Bahmani, of course, because we know we know our fan base

608
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,900
We started as a Bahmani show and we know that a lot of you guys stuck with us through the changes

609
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,560
So, of course we will I'm absolutely bringing you all the Bahmani news

610
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,340
all right

611
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,220
also, I

612
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,220
Actually made a short list of

613
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,900
of things I noticed when I was playing Supernova

614
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,820
not too long ago. What's that? Alright.

615
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:40,020
I'm gonna try to go as fast as I can, but

616
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,580
I could say that I don't like the... there's a new

617
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,380
Milit-Select style because of the...

618
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,020
all the music is all the way down and you have to go all the way past to

619
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,780
the... nevermind.

620
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:03,820
okay well that's a problem that we just took care of well I'm just I'm trying to

621
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,860
go too fast that's all right well you know hopefully we'll have news on

622
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:14,460
supernova consumer style at e3 next week yeah I mean otherwise I could just say

623
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:20,460
good things about it really from what I look like it it's pretty much done and I

624
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,740
I guess the memory card slots might be appearing because of pictures recently.

625
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:30,180
Absolutely. They said at Economy Gamers Day that it would connect up with the home

626
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:32,500
versions. I think a lot of people forgot that though, but it will.

627
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,740
There will be memory cards or some type of connectivity through the home versions

628
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:41,180
somehow. Alright, well, I'm gonna let you go, buddy.

629
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,740
Have a good one and enjoy your DDR. Before you take the next call, Rob,

630
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,380
I have a DMN wanting me to share with everybody

631
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:55,300
Yes, there's a strong possibility of the new earthbound series coming to the US. Thank God. They've heard our prayers

632
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,300
I heard the new one's pretty mediocre though

633
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,760
I'm going want to make a love to it all night long. I will definitely have this if it comes out

634
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,760
Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

635
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:13,140
This is a nerd from somewhere. Hi Xander from somewhere. Love the new icon on your Skype

636
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,920
He's got the rez game icon there. Love it. What's up?

637
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,520
Not a whole lot. I have a theory on why

638
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,560
they don't have In the Groove in the schools instead of DDR.

639
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,640
Because it sucks. No, hold on. Because the kids are too fat

640
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:34,640
to play it. Wait a minute though, with that statement you're

641
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,920
just reaffirming the fact that In the Groove is not a game for beginners.

642
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,000
Or a game for sane people.

643
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,160
Or a game for people who like good games. Be nice. Exactly.

644
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,180
be nice Xander please finish your thought I will I will hold these rude

645
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:50,900
ones at bay

646
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,060
I'm not rude I'm honest

647
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,300
I will turn these, look I'm in front of the board I'll turn the mics off

648
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,460
watch me do it I can throw stuff at you from here I will do it I'll throw

649
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,260
I got my hand on the cord, look my hand on the cord

650
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,860
alright Xander what's on your mind?

651
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,300
I was just saying that everybody in West Virginia is a fat hillbilly

652
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:15,120
well if those folks in West Virginia can address those cards and let

653
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,680
letters to Zander, care of our forums, okay?

654
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,520
By the way, for this summer, I'm doing this choir trip, and that's actually where we're

655
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,520
going.

656
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,520
It's West Virginia.

657
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,800
Not that you really need to know that.

658
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,920
What choir is that?

659
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,080
It's a thing for a church, so...

660
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,080
All right.

661
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,080
Well...

662
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,880
That's not very Christian of you to call them all fat hillbillies.

663
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:42,480
Then people in West Virginia be waiting for just all the church choirs that come through,

664
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,480
We asked for Xander, and when you find him, you know, kick his ass.

665
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,640
I like how he said that the kids are all fat and they can handle DDR, but it's mostly because

666
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,560
those kids are not elitist pricks, and that's why they can handle ITG.

667
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:03,040
Xander, would he retort?

668
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,120
I like In the Groove.

669
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,120
I know you do.

670
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,200
I've been playing it a lot recently.

671
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,080
I know you do.

672
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,720
Don't listen to the haters, Xander.

673
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,080
It has neat music.

674
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:18,200
steps are kinda crap. Kid Whatever was a nice guy. I like Life of a Butterfly, that's about

675
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:23,120
it. I like, which MC was that? I don't know, I don't care. I like MC Frontalot. Alright,

676
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:31,000
Xander, anything else? Um, I have a question, like, do you know any video game news websites

677
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,480
in Spanish? Video game news websites in Spanish? Uh, Orange Laundry run through Alta Vista?

678
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,480
No, I don't know. I don't know of any off the top of my head.

679
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,480
I've found one, I think.

680
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,480
Well, I usually find them in, like, German and Russian.

681
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,480
Which is not Spanish.

682
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,480
Which is not Spanish, so I'll have to hunt it down.

683
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,480
How do you say video game in Espanol?

684
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,480
Video game-o.

685
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,480
It is not video game-o!

686
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,480
El video game?

687
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,480
No, juegos de video.

688
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,480
There you go! Put that in Google!

689
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,480
I tried, and it didn't really give me anything.

690
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,040
I'm going on the hunt now. This is a personal job. All right, just stay tuned to chat room

691
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,040
We're gonna let you go so we can take another call. All right

692
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,160
Okay later

693
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,280
Why does he always try to start a fight

694
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,960
It's every time you're here too. He doesn't bring up in the groove unless you're here

695
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:27,760
I'll come back with you know, correct answers and the truth. Let's go to the next call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge radio

696
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:34,040
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

697
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:40,720
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

698
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,880
Okay, no one's there, the volume's too low dude, we gotta let you go, go to somebody

699
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,880
else.

700
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,880
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

701
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,880
Hi Sky, it's Ravenstaufen.

702
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,440
Hi Ravenstaufen, what's on your mind?

703
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,520
Well, what's on my mind is those press conferences that be before E3.

704
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,700
yep on our mind too. Which one is you most excited for?

705
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,560
Nintendo because they're holding the biggest package in their pants still

706
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,720
yeah because it's the Wii

707
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,000
you got it! I'm interested in seeing

708
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,760
playstation or Sony's and Nintendo's Microsoft I couldn't care because they're

709
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,240
well now it's probably Halo 3 which oh my god I didn't know that was coming out

710
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,480
I you know I you know I think Xbox may I'm looking forward to all of them because I

711
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,540
think Xbox may

712
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,080
I want to know if they're gonna say anything about HD DVD that's all I just

713
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,000
want to know if they're gonna

714
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,640
even go there. I want to laugh at them. Oh stop they're fine there's nothing wrong.

715
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,780
Okay Ravenstahl which one are you looking forward to?

716
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:43,120
I'm looking forward to the Sony one and then the Nintendo one and I don't

717
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,780
give a rat's ass about Microsoft.

718
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,960
Well there you have it we don't we don't fucking bleep on this show it's

719
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,720
internet radio.

720
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,560
Censor me all the time. That's that's because you're

721
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:01,460
I like the E3 on PSP.

722
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,960
That made me very giddy as hell.

723
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,260
And I'm glad there's a lot of diversity on Orange Lounge Radio. There's a

724
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,460
girl, there's a gay guy, and there

725
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,340
is a straight married dude that just loves Windows to death.

726
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,560
Yeah, you know, we're an odd

727
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,440
pairing of people but you know just we like games and I like the fact that

728
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,120
we're just

729
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,640
we I think part of what makes our show so

730
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,040
interesting if I can like have an ego here for a minute is what I like about

731
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,080
this program is that

732
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,560
we don't make it any secret that we have lives outside gaming and sometimes we're

733
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,240
a little tongue-in-cheek with our gaming

734
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,280
but we're real you know and that's just what we want to bring to you guys is

735
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,800
just you know a real show

736
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,740
I think I'm part of what I really liked about the show I used to be on

737
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,940
under sedation live that I'm trying to kind of bring over here to orange launch radio

738
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,460
was the fact that it just sounded like a bunch of people at Denny's sitting around talking

739
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:01,020
shit and that's what we do here we just kind of sit around and talk and let you guys all

740
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:06,860
eavesdrop in on it and participate in the big thing as well thanks to you know we couldn't

741
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,340
do it so much in the beginning but now we can let you guys join us at the big table

742
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:16,380
so oh one more thing yes about the wedding uh-huh I went to a Jewish wedding and yeah

743
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:21,940
they do have the little chairs up in the air so that's yeah we didn't do because

744
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:26,660
her relatives weren't getting up doing anything and another thing that got

745
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:32,060
botched to your wedding hey at least you didn't get hurt true true because my my

746
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:38,820
sister got hurt in that well be a maybe those weddings should come with

747
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,740
disclaimers to be more careful I don't know who's weddings I have no problem

748
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:47,380
with them but you know I used I've been in one all right all right we gotta let

749
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,340
you go we gotta talk games we'll talk weddings later all right all right

750
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:54,380
later dude I found Spanish video game sites what is it I'm a bunch of them and

751
00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:02,900
I used a Google Mexico ah good time google.com dot MX what miklotov what

752
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:12,220
you're just gonna censor me it's a free country no it's okay it is a dirty

753
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:19,940
Mexicans could use the Internet. You know what? What? I'm bringing Zekayla to E3. Wow.

754
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:30,300
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, uh, this is SSJ100 Matt. Sorry, but you're cutting out, so all we heard

755
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:37,660
was the, hey, and then it went dead silent. Who is this? SSJ100 Matt. Hi, SSJ100 Matt,

756
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,660
Matt, what's on your mind?

757
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,660
Mazel tov on your wedding, Loki, by the way.

758
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,660
Thank you.

759
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,660
All right.

760
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,940
No, I wanted to talk about when Sephiroth, 1215, called in,

761
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:54,020
he was trying to explain with supernova,

762
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,900
he was trying to explain how in economics,

763
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,860
you know how you had to select all songs in order

764
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,340
to get all the songs?

765
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,180
Uh-huh.

766
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:08,800
Well, you kinda have to do that with Supernova.

767
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,580
It's kind of annoying. Is it really the end of the world?

768
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,340
No, it's just kind of annoying. Is it really going to ruin the game for people?

769
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,920
Not really. Alright, so what's the big fucking deal? I don't know.

770
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,420
Alright, enough said. What else is on your mind? Problem solved. Problem solved!

771
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,100
Umm...

772
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,540
Uhh...

773
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:33,580
I don't know if that threw me off track.

774
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:36,060
Well, I guess I got nothing else to say.

775
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,460
Gong.

776
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,180
All right.

777
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,840
I just wanted to do that to somebody all night long.

778
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,660
Poor guy.

779
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,180
All right.

780
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,740
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

781
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,460
Hi.

782
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,100
Hi, who's this?

783
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,500
This is Hurricane Z-Man.

784
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,620
Hi, Hurricane what?

785
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,340
Z-Man.

786
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,980
Hi, Hurricane Z-Man, what's on your mind?

787
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,180
I just wanted to know what you guys thought of Final Fantasy XII.

788
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:10,360
I know there isn't a whole lot out about it, but I was sorely disappointed with Final Fantasy

789
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,360
XI.

790
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,360
What?

791
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,360
Alright, here's the thing.

792
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,880
Final Fantasy XI is a completely different game.

793
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,400
It took the Final Fantasy universe and turned it upside down.

794
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,400
Here's the thing.

795
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,180
I've played the Final Fantasy XII demo, and I've played it twice now, essentially, because

796
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,240
I played the E3 demo a couple years ago when they actually had it there.

797
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,400
That was stupid, the first demo they had.

798
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,400
But the demo they put in with Dragon Quest VIII is great, and the thing that's great

799
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,960
about it is that it fuses that Final Fantasy XI universe with the rest of it, and I don't

800
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,900
want to say that to kind of put you off, but what I'm saying is that it kind of makes 11

801
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,080
make sense.

802
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,520
Because honestly, in the scope of all the Final Fantasy games, I think the only one

803
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,280
that XI has a lot in common with is II.

804
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,800
If you go and play Final Fantasy II, it's actually very similar to XI in some ways,

805
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,660
without the whole real-time battle, hmm?

806
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,760
I thought it was four.

807
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,420
Well, yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong,

808
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,620
four will forever be my favorite,

809
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,160
with six a close runner-up,

810
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,980
just because I'm a Super Nintendo brat,

811
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,860
but I think 12 is gonna be really great.

812
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:17,000
I've heard really good things from folks

813
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,860
who've imported the Japanese version.

814
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,220
I haven't bothered to look at it,

815
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,100
because I can't really understand Japanese,

816
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,460
and I want my first experience with the game

817
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,180
to be one that I understand fully,

818
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,780
But I don't see many reasons why this will disappoint, but I think the only thing that's

819
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:34,740
going to turn people off is the battle system, because it is a little more like Eleven's,

820
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,740
but not...

821
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,540
Which is crap.

822
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,540
Which is fun.

823
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,980
No, I like Eleven's battle, and I think the problem that you had with Eleven was that

824
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,780
you had to sit around and wait for a party, and then when you got one, the people were,

825
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,780
you know, bossy.

826
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,780
Stupid?

827
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,780
Retarded?

828
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,780
Here's the thing.

829
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,780
Brain damaged?

830
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,780
But in Final Fantasy XII, you're the boss.

831
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,780
They're all your bitches.

832
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,780
Ooh.

833
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,780
Bitch of the White Mage.

834
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,780
Yeah.

835
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,780
What was that dude?

836
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,780
Sounds a lot better.

837
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,780
Check out the demo because Dragon Quest VIII is a great game.

838
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,780
I'll have to download that.

839
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,780
Thanks guys. Keep up the great work with the show guys.

840
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,780
Not a problem. Appreciate it. Have a good one buddy.

841
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,780
Thanks for calling.

842
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,780
We like a good ego inflation once in a while.

843
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,780
Alright, thanks for the phone calls guys.

844
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,780
Sorry to those that got cut out tonight.

845
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,780
Maybe we'll take more later if we have time.

846
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,520
have time but for now we've got to get to the last minute stories anybody have

847
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:38,040
a last-minute story they want to share with our listeners no I do what dark

848
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:45,360
circle I'm Yuri lover linked this to me so they turn 60 that was pretty cool

849
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:56,080
Hooray! Happy birthday! They started May 7th 1946 by Ibuka Masaru who was a post-war

850
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:05,360
engineering entrepreneur and started Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Totsuko with Akio Morita and

851
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:11,220
the company basically became Sony. Happy happy birthday from all of us to you!

852
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,220
And one more.

853
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,220
What?

854
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,220
New Perfect Dark content.

855
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,220
Oh.

856
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,220
For us, you know, three people who like Perfect Dark Zero.

857
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,220
I just couldn't get into that game, sorry.

858
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:25,220
I know why people would like it, but I just couldn't get into it.

859
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,220
They've actually put up the first round of downloadable content for Perfect Dark Zero.

860
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,220
You do have to wait a little bit longer, though, for the premium maps.

861
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:37,220
There's new bots available in dark ops multiplayer games,

862
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:43,220
player games as well as in deathmatch that split into various new AIs.

863
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:49,860
Microsoft and Rare have put in some bug fixes that basically keep people from floating through

864
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:56,060
the air, keeping the capture flags, receiving positive points for team killing.

865
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,340
That's a big one.

866
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,980
They've just gone in and fixed a lot of the little bugs and glitches in the game as well

867
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,540
