[SPEAKER_02]: And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 183 for this May the 7th of 2006 for part B. Going to our podcast feed a little bit early this week to make way for the podcast we're going to be doing from the E3 Outpost Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

3
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited about that.

5
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,132
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you're a DS fan, you've got some really good news coming your way, and that would be the new DS that's coming out, right, DarkSakura?

6
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:59,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the DS Lite, and I want one.

7
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I want one, too.

8
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,282
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very sexy.

9
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:04,850
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we've got a release date for the U.S.

10
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,390
[SPEAKER_04]: on this one.

11
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,531
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be released on June 11th for the price of $129.99.

12
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:14,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Only the white one is going to be out in the U.S.

13
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:18,193
[SPEAKER_04]: to begin with, although they've got three other colors in Japan, too.

14
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:24,815
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also going to be releasing on May 15th the new Super Mario Bros.

15
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:29,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to wait and see.

16
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:30,596
[SPEAKER_04]: You know,

17
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:35,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's the DS Lite, but I want to wait for more colors.

18
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:37,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I like having a selection.

19
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know there's going to be more colors.

20
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:41,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, there's nothing wrong with the DS I have now.

21
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:43,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine works just fine.

22
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,557
[SPEAKER_02]: You say that until you actually see one in action.

23
00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:46,779
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, holy crap.

24
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think at Nintendo's booth they'll have everything on the DS Lite?

25
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:50,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably.

26
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:52,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that might be interesting.

27
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:55,102
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be an interesting little, like, all their demo DSs or DS lights.

28
00:01:55,182 --> 00:02:01,343
[SPEAKER_11]: One of our, uh, one of my, uh, coworkers imported one, and I swear it's the best thing I've ever seen.

29
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:08,364
[SPEAKER_12]: That all depends, though, because all their demos are gonna be on dev kits anyways, so... I guess that's true.

30
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:10,344
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

31
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:11,085
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

32
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:19,206
[SPEAKER_12]: But it doesn't matter anyways, remember, because you can do the firmware hack to, um, get the DS light brightness on the, uh, normal DS.

33
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:19,846
Mm-hmm.

34
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:21,688
[SPEAKER_02]: SIGA announced Full Auto 2, exclusive for PS3

35
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of sucks for me, but, you know, whatever.

36
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:45,658
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm getting all systems anyways.

37
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:49,920
[SPEAKER_12]: This time around, they're finally going to put some sort of deathmatch mode in there.

38
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,580
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be kind of arena-themed.

39
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,721
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, I guess, twisted metal.

40
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:56,862
[SPEAKER_12]: And it looks pretty sweet.

41
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:59,183
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen there's actually pictures online now.

42
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:05,505
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got three pictures on Xbox Oxide or whatever, that site.

43
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:10,987
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's sweet looking, so I can't wait to check that one out.

44
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:19,257
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's interesting is a lot of the news sites where I saw that news on kind of took the opportunity to bash Full Auto 1 as being a bad game, but I kind of enjoyed it.

45
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:19,738
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

46
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,459
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's not the best thing ever.

47
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,740
[SPEAKER_12]: It had flaws, but you know what?

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,061
[SPEAKER_12]: The second one will be better.

49
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:27,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, isn't that usually the case with games?

50
00:03:27,663 --> 00:03:28,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually.

51
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:28,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually.

52
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:58,762
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Xbox Live is, of course, they had a big patch this week, and assuming that they're gearing up for their big E3 showing, they're going to have an awful lot of stuff coming up for E3, including demos and trailers for Test Drive Unlimited, MotoGP 06, Crackdown, Dead or Alive Extreme 2, The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle Earth 2, Lost Planet, Sonic the Hedgehog, Splinter Cell Double Agent, and Viva PiÃ±ata.

53
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:04,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they're saying a flood of HD trailers from games that have yet to be announced.

54
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:05,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Halo 3?

55
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:09,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, they're going to have HD trailers for movies as well.

56
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:11,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too much of a surprise there.

57
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:20,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wish the Xbox 360 front end was built a little more to handle a lot of stuff, because scrolling through a big list is going to be annoying, I think.

58
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:21,409
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's just me.

59
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless they do a page that's going to be all E3 stuff, but even still...

60
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Now remember, that doesn't necessarily mean they're all playable demos, just some of them.

61
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:32,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Demos, trailers, we don't know which.

62
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Lost Planet is going to be a demo.

63
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:34,254
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

64
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:38,278
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're going to have, what was the other thing that they were going to have?

65
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:41,701
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the Top Spin 2 demo just came out.

66
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:48,247
[SPEAKER_12]: And World Cup Soccer was another one they were talking about releasing a demo for.

67
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:55,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be very interesting to see what sort of effect the Xbox Live integration of E3 is going to have.

68
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:57,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Uno is coming out.

69
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I heard about that.

70
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Uno is coming out next week as part of a celebration for E3.

71
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,181
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet no Street Fighter 2.

72
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:06,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Still not out.

73
00:05:07,843 --> 00:05:10,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Massive problems with that game, I hear.

74
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:11,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

75
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:14,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll fix them.

76
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:15,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that game out.

77
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:16,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop teasing us.

78
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, something new coming out for the DS?

79
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:24,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Disney actually has a new exclusive title for the DS called Spectrobes.

80
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:38,480
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it's supposed to be infused with edgy, highly stylized look and feel of a Japanese anime or manga series with unique original characters, right?

81
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:41,802
[SPEAKER_12]: And compelling storyline, breakthrough gameplay.

82
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:43,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

83
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:45,985
[SPEAKER_12]: It says the game allows players to...

84
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:52,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Excavate, and Train Battle with nearly 500 unique characters.

85
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,032
[SPEAKER_12]: So it sounds kind of like a Pokemon game.

86
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:58,113
[SPEAKER_12]: They actually have a game coming out right now.

87
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:04,977
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called some stupid-ass game where you dig up dinosaur bones.

88
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:11,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, if Jurassic Park were to have sex with Pokemon, this is the game you would get.

89
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,761
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just weird.

90
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:14,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

91
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:15,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

92
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:16,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot.

93
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:20,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought out the emulators this week and I played Jurassic Park on the Super Nintendo.

94
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:25,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wanted to show somebody the scary first person mode.

95
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:27,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is really bad, but anyway.

96
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:28,668
[SPEAKER_12]: That game was fun.

97
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:29,989
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

98
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,534
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it's going to be coming out and probably at Buena Vista's booth this year.

99
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:35,415
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

100
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:43,524
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura likes to travel the world from her computer because she loves you UK listeners as well as everybody.

101
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:44,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter where you're at.

102
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:45,284
[SPEAKER_02]: She loves you all.

103
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:48,405
[SPEAKER_02]: But UK has a release calendar of their own.

104
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:54,426
[SPEAKER_02]: The UK has a release date calendar of their own and DarkSakura would like to share some upcoming UK release dates.

105
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:57,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we have special things coming out.

106
00:06:58,307 --> 00:07:04,068
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 12th we have City Life for PC, Dreamfall The Longest Journey, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary for PC.

107
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:13,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man World 3, Sin Episodes Emergence, Time Shift, Brain Age, coming out on the DS on the 19th.

108
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:17,713
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple more things on the 19th, Fire Department 3.

109
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:20,935
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that game was massively delayed.

110
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:24,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Time Shift is apparently slated for PC and Xbox 360 on the 12th.

111
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:28,117
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pac-Man World 3 on PSP on the 19th.

112
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:31,939
[SPEAKER_12]: It was originally supposed to be on the 12th, but the problem was it got

113
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:34,024
[SPEAKER_12]: I would actually like to hear from our UK listeners.

114
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:36,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me know how the Rainbow Islands Revolution turned out.

115
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:36,905
[SPEAKER_12]: It was released on the 5th.

116
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:39,467
[SPEAKER_12]: So if anyone picked it up, let me know what you think about it.

117
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:40,467
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to hear your review.

118
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:41,588
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm curious about it too.

119
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

120
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:04,309
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

121
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:04,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

122
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:05,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot.

123
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, I don't think a whole bunch is going to come out during E3.

124
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:09,531
[SPEAKER_02]: No, obviously not.

125
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:13,192
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought, Loki, humorous anyway, is there anything coming out for the US?

126
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:16,574
[SPEAKER_12]: There's jack shit coming out for the US.

127
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:22,095
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the only real game that's coming out is Over the Hedge, and that's coming out on most systems.

128
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:30,318
[SPEAKER_12]: You do have the, was it the Guitar Hero SG controller coming out, which is, I guess, kind of interesting.

129
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:31,139
[SPEAKER_12]: On...

130
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Tringo on the Game Boy Advance

131
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,980
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

132
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:29,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Xbox 360, PS3, Xbox 360

133
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:51,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Screenshots will be impossible to tell the 360 from the PS3 apart.

134
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:57,187
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember how they used to do that in GamePro where they'd have screenshots of Super Nintendo and Genesis versions.

135
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,548
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll hopefully start seeing that again.

136
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:04,049
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that we're going to see differences.

137
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,051
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the PS3 is going to end up being better.

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well that's... We'll see this week.

139
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:12,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully.

140
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:12,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully.

141
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:15,387
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all how you... I've seen a lot of stuff.

142
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,570
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, look at God of War on the PlayStation 2.

143
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:24,237
[SPEAKER_12]: You can really push out a lot of graphics and quality in some of these systems.

144
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:26,179
[SPEAKER_12]: You just have to know how to program for them.

145
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:28,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we've seen the best of Xbox 360 yet either.

146
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:30,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Not by a long shot.

147
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:30,764
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

148
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:35,116
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not have seen the best of the PSP or the DS yet as well.

149
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:49,945
[SPEAKER_02]: There are rumors abounding that Vonage, that broadband phone company, Vonage is apparently making software that is going to allow PSP and DS users to turn those handheld systems into VOIP phones.

150
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:57,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you think about it, that means your handheld would basically be a phone that you could use anywhere that there's Wi-Fi, like an N-Gage.

151
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:01,010
[SPEAKER_04]: First we had the taco, and now we have the quesadilla.

152
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,931
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the DS, a clam?

153
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:04,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I was saying quesadilla.

154
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:07,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I was sticking with the Mexican food reference.

155
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:07,592
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a clam.

156
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:08,832
[SPEAKER_12]: I still think it's a taco.

157
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:10,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you kind of like put it back together.

158
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:11,973
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter anyways.

159
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,533
[SPEAKER_12]: The N-Gage isn't finished.

160
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the N-Gage will rule the world.

161
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I'll be buying a Gizmondo tomorrow.

162
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:25,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Engage should be the first booth that we do a video presentation from for the E3 on PSP site.

163
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:26,774
[SPEAKER_04]: We should totally do like in Wayne's World.

164
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, we're at the Engage booth.

165
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:30,197
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know what?

166
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:32,239
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making Bobby cover Engage.

167
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,261
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll cover the Engage booth.

168
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:37,944
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to find out what is so wonderful about this.

169
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:38,905
[SPEAKER_12]: And

170
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,340
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically, we're just going to ask them the questions.

171
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Why should I buy an N-Gage?

172
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:47,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Because cell phone games rock?

173
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:49,522
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm sorry, that's not the correct answer.

174
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:50,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Why should I buy an N-Gage?

175
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:51,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you like tacos.

176
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, Yuri Lover is so corny.

177
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:56,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, why should we buy... Oh, sorry.

178
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,825
[SPEAKER_04]: V over IPSP.

179
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:02,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Gotta let that run.

180
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:32,286
[SPEAKER_12]: doesn't matter anyways they're going to be doing that that was one of the attachments that they're going to be adding to the PSP so that's not really a surprise no but you know Vonage probably wants a piece of that because they're still I don't know if they're struggling but they're still trying to really get out there and be a major player so this could be huge for them we'll see you know what they need to do they need to be pushing you know Wi-Fi all over the United States and because you know I can tell you right now walking around I can't find that many hot spots Santa Clara though

181
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,948
[SPEAKER_12]: They've got free Wi-Fi everywhere.

182
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:34,729
[SPEAKER_12]: That's awesome.

183
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:35,609
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

184
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,849
[SPEAKER_12]: It's covered the entire city.

185
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor is that's supposed to happen in one of our suburbs, Roseville.

186
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:40,971
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

187
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:42,471
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

188
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:44,732
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

189
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to another story.

190
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:47,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

191
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:50,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Another interesting game to be shown at E3.

192
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Cooking Mama.

193
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:55,195
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually going to be part of Majesco's lineup at E3.

194
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,076
[SPEAKER_12]: And this game is basically...

195
00:12:58,188 --> 00:12:58,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Bacons

196
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Look forward to eating tomorrow.

197
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:54,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, since somebody brought up the end gauge earlier.

198
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:55,688
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to mention, though, real quick.

199
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:55,988
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

200
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:56,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Real quick.

201
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you notice it is Cooking Mama?

202
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, women in the kitchen.

203
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,071
[SPEAKER_12]: In the kitchen.

204
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:02,831
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

205
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:07,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain, you know, freaking Emeril, okay?

206
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Women in disguise.

207
00:14:11,363 --> 00:14:11,703
[SPEAKER_11]: He's crazy.

208
00:14:11,723 --> 00:14:12,905
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the Galloping Gourmet?

209
00:14:13,205 --> 00:14:14,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Woman in disguise.

210
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:14,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Iron Chef.

211
00:14:15,507 --> 00:14:16,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Women in disguise.

212
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,009
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

213
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,171
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a woman on Iron Chef, but she's more of a man.

214
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,654
[SPEAKER_11]: She's proud to show that she's a woman in cooking.

215
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:24,356
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get hate mail.

216
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:29,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I like... This is me as estrogen ambassador, okay?

217
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:31,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to cook.

218
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:34,185
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I don't.

219
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:35,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I make my husband make me dinner.

220
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:38,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Woman in Disguise.

221
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:39,454
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no.

222
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,275
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

223
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,216
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows his place.

224
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:45,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

225
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:47,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

226
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:49,538
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about the end gauge.

227
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:51,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this was hilarious.

228
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:52,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Joystick ran an article this week.

229
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,541
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, mobile market shows signs of stagnation.

230
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:57,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was my reaction?

231
00:14:58,842 --> 00:14:59,322
[SPEAKER_02]: A duh!

232
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,241
[SPEAKER_02]: You know why?

233
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I don't even have to read the article.

234
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:06,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Because mobile games are not that great.

235
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:06,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

236
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,626
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not that fun.

237
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:11,347
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really not that fun.

238
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:14,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel bad because I know people that develop for mobile games and stuff.

239
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know they're trying very hard at what they do and everything.

240
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:22,555
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess they just are catered for a certain market that's not me.

241
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as a hardcore gamer, I really don't like mobile phone games.

242
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:31,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Mobile gaming is about as cool as talking on one of those cell phones from the 80s today.

243
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:36,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, here's the actual chunk of the story here.

244
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:43,087
[SPEAKER_02]: A research firm, M-Metrics, published data in March 2006 from a mobile gamer's perspective.

245
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:53,831
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying that the number of mobile gamers is remaining constant month on month, with only a tiny fraction of mobile users, 0.5%, downloading their first game in March.

246
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,913
[SPEAKER_02]: The percentage of phone users who use their handset for downloadable games is low.

247
00:15:57,973 --> 00:15:58,593
[SPEAKER_02]: The U.S., 2.7%.

248
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:15,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, given the millions and millions of mobile phones in the market, that's still a lot of people, and many of them are repeat customers, but there's really not a lot of reasons to buy new titles, and they're not exactly cheap, and it kind of puts people off.

249
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:20,843
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's just like spending $5 on a game that actually a Flash game would be better than.

250
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:21,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's just

251
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:24,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

252
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:56,091
[SPEAKER_12]: People started to think that it might actually be at E3 because there was an advertisement on IGN, of course.

253
00:16:56,871 --> 00:17:01,413
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone accidentally let that slip through there in their editing department.

254
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:03,054
[SPEAKER_12]: High hopes.

255
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:05,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at E3, huh?

256
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:06,095
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me sad.

257
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:09,856
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me very angry, and you know what happens when people get angry.

258
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:11,277
[SPEAKER_02]: They turn into the Hulk?

259
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:14,638
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's time for the FUs of the Week.

260
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:18,014
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where DarkSakura turns into the She-Hulk.

261
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:22,163
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, I am not a green-skinned, tall attorney.

262
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:23,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

263
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:40,352
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the day goes towards this stupid kid in a Mustang.

264
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:42,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I love the Mustang.

265
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:43,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I love old Mustangs especially.

266
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:44,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the very new ones.

267
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:47,237
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy's was like a dirty convertible one.

268
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,137
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like probably 16.

269
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:49,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Really stupid.

270
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:53,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Had like some blonde stupid looking girl with him.

271
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:56,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will tell you where it is.

272
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:58,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone in this area will know.

273
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:02,090
[SPEAKER_04]: It was as I was going from downtown.

274
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I had just passed where the Elkhorn entrance onto the freeway goes right before Antelope.

275
00:18:08,694 --> 00:18:10,775
[SPEAKER_04]: You have that long ass merging lane.

276
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:12,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is a really long merging lane.

277
00:18:13,377 --> 00:18:15,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was well ahead of the guy.

278
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,200
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he starts speeding up, trying to nose in front of me.

279
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm already going 80, okay?

280
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:21,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, 65 miles an hour.

281
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:49,624
[SPEAKER_04]: and so finally he still keeps going and I'm blowing on my horn and finally I had to just drop back and honk at him so um he uh cut over to the other lane and I you know freaking told him off and then cut him off so uh that was my episode of the week to stupid children who don't know how to drive Loki um fuck you to the stupid DJ who like

282
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Stay Away From Hot Tracks

283
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Horrible.

284
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:25,463
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, he has some weird relationship with his sister whose name is Ting.

285
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:26,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuckoo!

286
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:27,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy!

287
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:30,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Send those cards and letters to Loki.

288
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:33,228
[SPEAKER_02]: The views and opinions expressed by Loki do not necessarily reflect those of the staff.

289
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:34,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come on, you agree.

290
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:35,730
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a retard.

291
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,752
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not enjoy myself as much as I could have.

292
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:40,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it that way.

293
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:44,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan kept cracking jokes about it.

294
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:47,917
[SPEAKER_04]: He offered money to anyone who would go over and grab his inflatable guitar and beat him over the head with it.

295
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:50,179
[SPEAKER_02]: But your wedding was still great.

296
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,856
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about how we really enjoyed the ceremony.

297
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:53,456
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very nice.

298
00:20:19,144 --> 00:20:19,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

299
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:27,947
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought it was especially cool that you had the tradition pulled in that the family wanted, but were able to do everything themselves.

300
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:29,888
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very impressive.

301
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:31,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like seeing Dan in a yarmulke.

302
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:33,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was hilarious.

303
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, my FU of the week goes to Flight Delays.

304
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:39,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Mikotov.

305
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:40,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

306
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:42,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Any FUs of the week?

307
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:45,374
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to the whole state of Hawaii.

308
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:46,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Hate you all.

309
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:47,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Hope you burn.

310
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:52,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe Japan will get lucky one of these days and actually hit you correctly with a bomb.

311
00:20:52,978 --> 00:20:53,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow!

312
00:20:54,673 --> 00:20:55,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

313
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:25,106
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, please take us away with an actual relating to the news type story.

314
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:25,886
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be wonderful.

315
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:28,468
[SPEAKER_02]: We do news here?

316
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a while we are known to do that.

317
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:32,629
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we do that for?

318
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:37,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we drop the Wii controllers on her now?

319
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:42,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well I do have a little bit of news.

320
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:49,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, Konami is doing the big pitch for the DDR for school.

321
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:54,644
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, because they were so successful in West Virginia or wherever?

322
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:55,366
[SPEAKER_11]: West Virginia.

323
00:21:55,526 --> 00:21:57,651
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, they're trying to sell all the other states now on this?

324
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:00,416
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to make DDR part of public school curriculum.

325
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:03,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't look at me like that.

326
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:06,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I got an F in DDR.

327
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

328
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:14,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, this has been done at other schools with a very high success rate.

329
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:21,109
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have actually gotten in better shape and lost weight through playing DDR.

330
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:22,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I, at first...

331
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,712
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because I moved out here, got happy, you know, and got really fat.

332
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:31,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And then started playing DDR and dropped 20 pounds over a summer.

333
00:22:31,495 --> 00:22:33,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I can vouch for personal experience.

334
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:37,538
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but I think it's a really good thing.

335
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I do like the little comment from here.

336
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:45,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about looking for all the YouTube and Google videos about their classmates playing DDR.

337
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:46,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

338
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:47,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

339
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Comedy.

340
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,446
[SPEAKER_12]: I still can't wait for somebody to come home.

341
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,026
[SPEAKER_12]: I got an F in DDR.

342
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you don't hear them pitching in the groove to schools.

343
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:57,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

344
00:22:57,631 --> 00:22:59,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you mean they got an E in DDR?

345
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,012
[SPEAKER_11]: With a boo.

346
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:02,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Failed.

347
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:05,473
[SPEAKER_04]: You should practice in a closet.

348
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:09,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my PE teacher should be the nurse from Solo 2000.

349
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:12,095
[SPEAKER_02]: She's so amazing.

350
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:13,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stand it.

351
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:16,956
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to marry her.

352
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:17,496
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

353
00:23:18,316 --> 00:23:21,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out in a classroom near you if Konami gets their way.

354
00:23:21,553 --> 00:23:22,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I'm in college.

355
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:54,863
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be chopped down to episodes each containing about 30-40 minutes of gameplay that ends with a cliffhanger and preview of things to come.

356
00:23:56,924 --> 00:23:57,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

357
00:23:57,965 --> 00:24:01,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I've never been so... eh, in my life.

358
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds like Shenmue, except...

359
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:04,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Somehow worse.

360
00:24:05,053 --> 00:24:06,374
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it sounds interesting.

361
00:24:06,414 --> 00:24:07,354
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the idea of an episode.

362
00:24:07,374 --> 00:24:11,377
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds okay, but how expensive is this going to be?

363
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:13,979
[SPEAKER_12]: You said 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay?

364
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,239
[SPEAKER_12]: 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay.

365
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Each episode.

366
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Each episode would probably be about $5 on Xbox Live or something like that.

367
00:24:19,983 --> 00:24:22,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about people who buy DVD shows.

368
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:24,225
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the same type of thing.

369
00:24:24,245 --> 00:24:26,967
[SPEAKER_02]: You watch a couple episodes, you take a break, come back.

370
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,408
[SPEAKER_02]: People watch 24 on DVD.

371
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,549
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what save points were invented for.

372
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:33,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

373
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:35,734
[SPEAKER_02]: and neither does Eden Games apparently.

374
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:37,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an interesting idea.

375
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,056
[SPEAKER_02]: If done right, it might be neat.

376
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:42,318
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's under $10 an episode thing, then that's okay.

377
00:24:42,578 --> 00:24:43,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if the game's good.

378
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it depends on how good the game is.

379
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,361
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to pay $10 for 30 minutes of gameplay.

380
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:48,141
[SPEAKER_12]: This shit better be like $2.

381
00:24:50,062 --> 00:24:50,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Even less.

382
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Like iTunes charges $1.99 for a 40 minute TV show.

383
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:58,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I like $1.99 should be the price.

384
00:24:59,187 --> 00:24:59,668
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see though.

385
00:25:00,228 --> 00:25:02,209
[SPEAKER_12]: How about the game not suck first and let's just

386
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:09,281
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to run down some lineups that are going to be at E3, some things that were announced this week.

387
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:10,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, THQ.

388
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:12,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, THQ, we mentioned them a little bit earlier.

389
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:19,008
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to be having Saints Row, which is going to be pretty sweet, and I hear there may be a demo coming to Xbox Live.

390
00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:22,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Frontline's Fuel Awards is coming out of the 360 podcast.

391
00:25:23,473 --> 00:25:44,452
[SPEAKER_12]: PS3 and for PC Smackdown vs. Raw 07 and I know that's going to be there because actually I think some of the wrestlers are going to be there as well promoting it PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360 and PSP notice no Xbox The Sopranos of course we mentioned that on the 360 and PlayStation 2 also no Xbox and

395
00:26:24,186 --> 00:26:33,411
[SPEAKER_12]: SpongeBob SquarePants Creature from the Krusty Krab, which is going to be on PlayStation 2, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PC, DS, and the Wii.

[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Ubisoft's got an interesting E3 lineup this year.

399
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Splinter Cell Double Agent will be on just about every system that's out there.

[SPEAKER_02]: Red Steel, of course, on the Wii.

[SPEAKER_02]: Rayman Raving Rabbids will also be on the Wii.

402
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:11,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Should be interesting.

[SPEAKER_02]: Rainbow Six Vegas for the PS2, PS3, and both Xboxes.

404

408
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:41,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Ubisoft is supposed to do some type of next-gen and PC game from the folks who did TimeSplitters, but not a lot of more details just yet.

409
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:42,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, but TimeSplitters 4.

410
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:44,447
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

411
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:45,928
[SPEAKER_12]: TimeSplitters is fucking awesome.

412
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:46,508

418
00:29:03,462 --> 00:29:04,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Should be pretty cool.

419
00:29:07,863 --> 00:29:08,164
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

420
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:11,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we could have a little bit of a roundtable here.

421
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:16,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Top three things we are looking forward to at E3 besides the Wii and the PlayStation 3.

422
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:17,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the easy answers.

423
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:19,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody want to go first?

424
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:21,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody?

425
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:21,888
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Miklatov.

426
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:25,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Luminous 2 for the PSP.

427
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:26,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that your number one?

428
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,190
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

429
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, your number three?

430
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:28,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's my number three.

431
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give this three to one.

432
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:31,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, can't we...

433
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:34,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I have time to think about my two-in-one?

434
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:35,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

435
00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:59,854
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually kind of excited about seeing, well, I was hoping to see Take-Two's lineup this year, because I would have been looking forward to seeing Grand Theft Auto Vice City stories, but assuming I probably won't see that, I guess the next best thing would probably be seeing a Wii version of WarioWare, because that looks like fun.

436
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:02,574
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura Taking a nap under Squeenix's movie theater

437
00:30:15,237 --> 00:30:19,821
[SPEAKER_02]: My number three would be the DDRs.

438
00:30:20,782 --> 00:30:23,445
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many of them that I'm very curious to see what's going to happen there.

439
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming we're right, but we are.

440
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:31,994
[SPEAKER_11]: My number two would be Luminous for PS2.

441
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:35,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

442
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:37,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Weird Drinks for 7 for the PS3.

443
00:30:39,244 --> 00:30:39,724
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Konami,

444
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:07,142
[SPEAKER_02]: because their list was not that.

445
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Chrono Trigger 3!

446
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:14,188
[SPEAKER_12]: 7 Remake, Crisis Core, and... You think the 7 Remakes?

447
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:20,553
[SPEAKER_12]: 7 Remake, Crisis Core, the... Oh, what the fuck is that stupid one that's on cell phones right now?

448
00:31:21,374 --> 00:31:22,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Before Crisis.

449
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:23,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Before Crisis.

450
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:25,097
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be ported to the PSP.

451
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,499
[SPEAKER_12]: You think Indurgis Service?

452
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Indurgis Service is coming out next month.

453
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:31,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, not next month, two months from now.

454
00:31:32,082 --> 00:31:33,624
[SPEAKER_12]: July, so... Of course.

455
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:35,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already out in Japan.

456
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:36,819
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

457
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:09,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to seeing which Japanese gaming celebrity I'm going to run into this year.

458
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping for Yuji Naka.

459
00:32:11,577 --> 00:32:21,684
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking forward to seeing Paris Hilton at her booth trying to promote some cell phone game and asking her stupid questions and getting it all on film.

460
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:23,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you should get her autograph.

461
00:32:23,953 --> 00:32:24,313
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

462
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:27,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatop stole my number one.

463
00:32:27,456 --> 00:32:29,577
[SPEAKER_02]: My number one was the Luminous games.

464
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:31,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine, it's three on mine.

465
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:32,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because you suck.

466
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Squeenix, by the way, we want Chrono Trigger for the DS.

467
00:32:36,742 --> 00:32:38,604
[SPEAKER_11]: And we want freaking Einhander 2.

468
00:32:38,964 --> 00:32:41,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Einhander 2 would be the best thing ever.

469
00:32:41,786 --> 00:32:42,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Einhander.

470
00:32:42,487 --> 00:32:44,148
[SPEAKER_04]: We broke that game out not too long ago.

471
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:45,949
[SPEAKER_12]: I played it like a month ago.

472
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:52,394
[SPEAKER_12]: If they're going to make an Einhander game, and since they don't really want to do that much work for it, port it over to the PSP.

473
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:54,915
[SPEAKER_11]: or a better system.

474
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:56,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, comments in the chat room.

475
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:57,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

476
00:32:57,157 --> 00:32:58,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't want to ignore you guys.

477
00:32:58,418 --> 00:32:58,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

478
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:03,041
[SPEAKER_02]: TetrisDSManiac64 says, Duke Nukem Forever.

479
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:04,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

480
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I hope to see that there.

481
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:06,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

482
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, 23rdMagus says, fucking StarCraft Ghost.

483
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:10,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, wasn't that cancelled?

484
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:12,127
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not coming out.

485
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:12,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to say.

486
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:14,129
[SPEAKER_02]: On, uh, current gen at least.

487
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:15,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, maybe later.

488
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:21,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, GS191 says, Squeenix should just remake the whole damn FF series.

489
00:33:21,274 --> 00:33:21,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it time.

490
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:22,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh,

491
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:24,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy 3, Loki,

492
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:48,318
[SPEAKER_02]: A website I used to visit an awful lot.

493
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:50,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I want to visit it anymore.

494
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would this be?

495
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Me too.

496
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:59,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Alakazam used to be a really good website that was actually pretty much a hub for anything online.

497
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:03,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Meaning games, like Final Fantasy XI.

498
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Online games, yeah, like MMOs and stuff.

499
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,473
[SPEAKER_12]: The thing is, though, is they just got bought out.

500
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,856
[SPEAKER_12]: And they got bought out by a website called ZAM.

501
00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:15,157
[SPEAKER_12]: The ZAM Network.

502
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:15,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Z-A-M.

503
00:34:16,573 --> 00:34:45,956
[SPEAKER_12]: which happens to be also like um owned there's a bunch of different chains of websites but it all comes back to one website that really gets people's panties in a bunch and that would be IGE which is best known for kill selling gold selling you name it they sell it ooh yuck and they own that website now so um sucks if you're still visiting that cause yeah lots of uh

504
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:48,449
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of problems there.

505
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:50,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Mikotov, you surf Alakazam.

506
00:34:50,452 --> 00:34:51,453
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the reaction been like there?

507
00:34:52,295 --> 00:35:00,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's angry and most of the posts I saw said that everybody was canceling their premium accounts as soon as they run up for the month.

508
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:04,072
[SPEAKER_11]: So not too many people are happy about this, I guess.

509
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:06,909
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, Atlas was selling the premium accounts.

510
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:10,190
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, oh, it funds the dirty gill sellers.

511
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:10,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Time to quit.

512
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:16,272
[SPEAKER_11]: I still like Alakazam because it has information, but I'm not going to pay them money.

513
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:19,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't want to pay them money in the first place.

514
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:20,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wouldn't pay them money either.

515
00:35:20,473 --> 00:35:21,634
[SPEAKER_11]: I can still use their search feature.

516
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:22,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet is free!

517
00:35:22,894 --> 00:35:23,214
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.

518
00:35:24,174 --> 00:35:24,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Net zero, $9.95.

519
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:26,275
[SPEAKER_11]: That's free.

520
00:35:26,315 --> 00:35:28,556
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you feel about gill selling, gold selling?

521
00:35:28,596 --> 00:35:29,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

522
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:31,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about it.

523
00:35:34,454 --> 00:35:34,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah.

524
00:35:35,395 --> 00:35:39,719
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if somebody were screwing up Ragnarok's economy that same way, you'd care about it mighty quick, I bet.

525
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't play on IRO.

526
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so you're stealing your Ragnarok.

527
00:35:46,265 --> 00:35:47,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not stealing my Ragnarok.

528
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:50,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody else is stealing it, and I'm just, you know... You're just borrowing it.

529
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:50,750
[SPEAKER_04]: ...whoring them out.

530
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:57,556
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, though, like on our new server in Final Fantasy, I haven't heard anybody talk about any gill sellers whatsoever, so it's good.

531
00:35:57,596 --> 00:35:58,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're all gone.

532
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,782
[SPEAKER_11]: or they're not a problem on this server.

533
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:01,322
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

534
00:36:01,983 --> 00:36:09,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down and find a good website that does deserve your attention and isn't going to sell out to gill sellers or gold sellers.

535
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:12,834
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what website did you pick this week?

536
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:17,226
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually one of the sites that I think is pretty cool is Silent Hill Heaven.

537
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:21,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I go there all the time looking at pictures and stuff and it's pretty cool.

538
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:33,356
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get pictures of weapons from the endings, screen captures, fan art, and they even have a translation on here that they were working on for the Silent Hill play novels.

539
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:43,367
[SPEAKER_04]: For anyone who's probably heard me mention this before, the play novel was Japan only on the Game Boy, and it was running through two scenarios.

540
00:36:43,888 --> 00:36:49,530
[SPEAKER_04]: One where you play as Harry, and the other one where you play as Sybil.

541
00:36:50,558 --> 00:36:57,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, from what I understand, there was actually supposed to be a scenario with Sybil in the first game that never made it in.

542
00:36:57,747 --> 00:37:02,852
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is more what her story was like along different ending lines.

543
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of it is there, only part of it is there, but it's pretty cool.

544
00:37:07,218 --> 00:37:08,079
[SPEAKER_04]: They're working on it.

545
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:12,877
[SPEAKER_04]: They also, like I mentioned, have tons of pictures, tons of information.

546
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:23,406
[SPEAKER_04]: They have stuff from the DVDs, The Lost Memories and Art of Silent Hill, Fanfic Gallery, I'm sorry, Fanfic Archive, Fan Art Gallery, all kinds of neat stuff.

547
00:37:24,447 --> 00:37:28,470
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to SilentHillHeaven.com and just click on their image, it actually takes you to their forums.

548
00:37:28,931 --> 00:37:37,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So go to SilentHillHeaven.com slash site, that's capitalized, slash main, also capitalized, slash main.php, which is lowercase.

549
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:40,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's case sensitive or not, so that's why I'm saying so.

550
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:41,979
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

551
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:43,400
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's pretty neato.

552
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out now or Pyramid Head will kill you.

553
00:37:46,943 --> 00:37:47,744
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky.

554
00:37:49,105 --> 00:37:50,626
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll do other things first.

555
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:54,229
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to open up the Skype line very, very soon here.

556
00:37:54,249 --> 00:38:02,016
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to call in and say hello, give us your opinion on whatever, you head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us, and all the details are right there.

557
00:38:02,036 --> 00:38:03,597
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also pick up the phone and call us.

558
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:09,210
[SPEAKER_02]: 916-226-9067 is the telephono number so check it out.

559
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:18,399
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to check out real quickly the Hideo blog, that's Hideo Kojima's blog there, there is a little

560
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:19,800
[SPEAKER_02]: MetaGearSolid4

561
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:55,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall we go to the telephones, the Skype lines, and see who's calling us today?

562
00:38:56,463 --> 00:38:57,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

563
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:01,565
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, guys?

564
00:39:01,705 --> 00:39:02,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, who's this?

565
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,205
[SPEAKER_02]: It's DMN.

566
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:04,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, DMN.

567
00:39:05,006 --> 00:39:06,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn down your outgoing a little bit.

568
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,147
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hear ourselves.

569
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:08,267
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

570
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:12,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

571
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:19,314
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a couple of bits of news out of the Nintendo camp that I think I can share without getting my head cut off.

572
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:20,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I like this.

573
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:23,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this controversial news.

574
00:39:23,637 --> 00:39:25,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope one of them is what I think it is.

575
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:26,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.

576
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,160
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you share with us?

577
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:30,662
[SPEAKER_10]: I can share some price news.

578
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:31,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

579
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:40,949
[SPEAKER_10]: The $79.99 I've been hearing floating around quite some time, so likely I've been hearing about

580
00:39:41,658 --> 00:39:42,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Mid-August, that might happen.

581
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:50,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, when the DS Lite is released, it is likely that the regular DS model will drop to $99.99.

582
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:56,513
[SPEAKER_10]: But other than that, I really haven't heard any other news.

583
00:39:56,753 --> 00:39:58,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Where were you guys at the soccer account?

584
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:05,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, can you confirm about Osutatakaya Landon being bought out as Elite Task Agent?

585
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:09,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard nothing of that.

586
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:12,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a rumor about that today, too.

587
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:15,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's very cool, though, those rumors about the DS.

588
00:40:15,865 --> 00:40:22,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess not so much rumors at this point, but the DS coming down to 99, the old school one, and the GameCube going down to 79.99.

589
00:40:23,592 --> 00:40:24,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

590
00:40:25,234 --> 00:40:28,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I heard in there as well, where the hell were you at SakuraCon?

591
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:35,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It just came up a little late for us, but we will definitely try to get up there next year because I miss Seattle.

592
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:36,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do like it up there.

593
00:40:36,883 --> 00:40:39,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually planning on going to Vancouver at the end of June.

594
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:42,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I've wanted to go to Sakura for a while.

595
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:45,189
[SPEAKER_10]: I will arrange passes.

596
00:40:45,629 --> 00:40:46,329
[SPEAKER_10]: You will arrange what?

597
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:48,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm repeating game manager this year.

598
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:52,774
[SPEAKER_10]: I can arrange for some passes for you guys.

599
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:53,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

600
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:54,815
[SPEAKER_02]: We like passes.

601
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:57,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they get us backstage so we can meet rock stars?

602
00:40:59,342 --> 00:41:00,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, we'll see.

603
00:41:00,563 --> 00:41:00,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

604
00:41:01,784 --> 00:41:02,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

605
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:05,246
[SPEAKER_02]: DMN, thanks so much for calling in.

606
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:07,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else you wanted to get out before we hang up on you?

607
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:10,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no.

608
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, then have a good one.

609
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for calling.

610
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we appreciate that.

611
00:41:16,092 --> 00:41:18,333
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of the insider knowledge there on Nintendo.

612
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:19,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

613
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:20,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

614
00:41:20,575 --> 00:41:24,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go and answer this one.

615
00:41:24,997 --> 00:41:25,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

616
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:27,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

617
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:29,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, something exploded, right?

618
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,414
[SPEAKER_02]: It's picked up the phone.

619
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:31,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like someone dropped a keyboard.

620
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, someone set us up the bomb.

621
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:33,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

622
00:41:34,777 --> 00:41:36,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Sephiroth1215.

623
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:37,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Sephiroth1215, what's on your mind?

624
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:48,646
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I was wondering, will we be doing actual good coverage for the, you know, the Imani series this year?

625
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:50,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Our coverage will be mediocre on all levels.

626
00:41:52,388 --> 00:41:56,231
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, like, because usually all sites, all other sites, they...

627
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:57,337
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

628
00:41:57,357 --> 00:41:57,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Also...

629
00:42:26,036 --> 00:42:32,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually made a short list of, um, things I noticed when I was playing Supernova not too long ago.

630
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:33,519
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

631
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:54,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I'm gonna try to go as fast as I can, but, um, um, I could say that I don't like the, um, there's a new mode select style because of the, um, uh, the all music is all the way down, you have to go all the way past to, um, the, uh, the, uh,

632
00:42:55,151 --> 00:42:55,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Nevermind.

633
00:42:55,591 --> 00:42:56,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

634
00:42:57,814 --> 00:43:00,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's a problem that we just took care of.

635
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:02,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

636
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:04,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I'm just trying to go too fast.

637
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:05,101
[SPEAKER_01]: That's alright.

638
00:43:05,261 --> 00:43:10,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, hopefully we'll have news on Supernova Consumer Style at E3 next week.

639
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:11,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

640
00:43:12,128 --> 00:43:15,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, otherwise, I could just say good things about it, really.

641
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:18,515
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I look like, it

642
00:43:19,048 --> 00:43:25,573
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much done and I guess the memory card slots might be appearing because of pictures recently.

643
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:41,054
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, I'm going to let you go, buddy.

644
00:43:41,354 --> 00:43:43,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, and enjoy your DDR.

645
00:43:43,534 --> 00:43:53,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you take the next call, Rob, I have a DMN wanting me to share with everybody that there's a strong possibility of the new Earthbound series coming to the U.S.

646
00:43:53,237 --> 00:43:54,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank God.

647
00:43:54,397 --> 00:43:55,477
[SPEAKER_11]: They've heard our prayers.

648
00:43:55,577 --> 00:43:57,338
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard the new one's pretty mediocre, though.

649
00:43:58,498 --> 00:43:59,398
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still Mother.

650
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:00,438
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still Earthbound.

651
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:02,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make love to it all night long.

652
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:04,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely have this if it comes out.

653
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Limes Radio.

654
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

655
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:09,439
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Xander from somewhere.

656
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:10,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Xander from somewhere.

657
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the new icon on your Skype.

658
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:15,284
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the Rez game icon there.

659
00:44:15,324 --> 00:44:15,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

660
00:44:15,645 --> 00:44:15,965
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

661
00:44:18,307 --> 00:44:19,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a whole lot.

662
00:44:20,109 --> 00:44:24,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a theory on why they don't have any groove in the schools instead of DDR.

663
00:44:24,593 --> 00:44:25,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it sucks?

664
00:44:25,534 --> 00:44:26,275
[SPEAKER_02]: No, hold on.

665
00:44:26,355 --> 00:44:28,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, because the kids are too fat to play it.

666
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:32,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, though.

667
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:37,736
[SPEAKER_02]: With that statement, you're just reaffirming the fact that In the Groove is not a game for beginners.

668
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:40,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Or a game for sane people.

669
00:44:41,618 --> 00:44:42,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a game for people who like good games.

670
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice.

671
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, be nice.

672
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:48,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Xander, please finish your thought.

673
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:50,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I will hold these rude ones at bay.

674
00:44:54,217 --> 00:44:56,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I will turn these, look, I'm in front of the board.

675
00:44:56,157 --> 00:44:57,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn the mics off.

676
00:44:57,377 --> 00:44:57,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch me do it.

677
00:44:58,058 --> 00:44:59,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I can throw stuff at you from here.

678
00:44:59,278 --> 00:44:59,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do it.

679
00:44:59,978 --> 00:45:00,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll throw.

680
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:01,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my hand on the cord.

681
00:45:01,778 --> 00:45:02,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, my hand's on the cord.

682
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:03,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop it.

683
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:06,539
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Xander, what's on your mind?

684
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:10,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just saying that everybody in West Virginia is a fat hillbilly.

685
00:45:11,801 --> 00:45:17,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if those folks in West Virginia can address those cards and letters to Xander, care of our forums, okay?

686
00:45:18,658 --> 00:45:23,802
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, for this summer, I'm doing this choir trip, and that's actually where we're going, is West Virginia.

687
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:26,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that you really need to know that.

688
00:45:26,844 --> 00:45:27,745
[SPEAKER_02]: What choir is that?

689
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:30,427
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a thing for a church.

690
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:31,407
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

691
00:45:31,888 --> 00:45:35,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not very Christian of you to call them all fat hillbillies.

692
00:45:35,811 --> 00:45:42,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people in West Virginia be waiting for just all the church choirs that come through.

693
00:45:42,716 --> 00:45:45,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask for Xander, and when you find him, kick his ass.

694
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:58,058
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how he said that the kids are all fat and they can handle DDR, but it's mostly because those kids are not elitist pricks and that's why they can handle ITG.

695
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:01,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Xander, witty retort?

696
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:03,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I like In the Groove.

697
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:04,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you do.

698
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:06,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing it a lot recently.

699
00:46:06,342 --> 00:46:06,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you do.

700
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:09,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't listen to the haters, Xander.

701
00:46:10,744 --> 00:46:11,704
[SPEAKER_04]: It has neat music.

702
00:46:12,044 --> 00:46:13,705
[SPEAKER_04]: The steps are kind of crap.

703
00:46:13,825 --> 00:46:15,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Kidwhatever was a nice guy.

704
00:46:15,956 --> 00:46:18,258
[SPEAKER_11]: I like Life of a Butterfly, that's about it.

705
00:46:18,298 --> 00:46:19,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I like, which MC was that?

706
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:21,321
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I don't care.

707
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I like MC Friend a lot.

708
00:46:22,722 --> 00:46:24,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Xander, anything else?

709
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:31,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question, like, do you know any video game news websites in Spanish?

710
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Video game news websites in Spanish?

711
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio run through Alta Vista?

712
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:38,015
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know.

713
00:46:38,035 --> 00:46:38,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know of any off the top of my head.

714
00:46:39,015 --> 00:46:40,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I found one, I think.

715
00:46:41,397 --> 00:46:44,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I usually find them in, like, German and Russian.

716
00:46:46,207 --> 00:46:47,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Spanish.

717
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:49,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is not Spanish, so I'll have to hunt it down.

718
00:46:49,668 --> 00:46:51,149
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you say video game in Espanol?

719
00:46:51,429 --> 00:46:52,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Video game-o.

720
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:54,810
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not video game-o.

721
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,670
[SPEAKER_02]: El video game?

722
00:46:57,551 --> 00:46:58,771
[SPEAKER_09]: No, huecos de video.

723
00:46:59,271 --> 00:46:59,671
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

724
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that in Google.

725
00:47:01,992 --> 00:47:04,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried, and it didn't really give me anything.

726
00:47:05,513 --> 00:47:06,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going on the hunt now.

727
00:47:06,553 --> 00:47:07,474
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a personal challenge.

728
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:07,814
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

729
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned to chat room, but we're going to let you go so we can take another call, all right?

730
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:11,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

731
00:47:11,535 --> 00:47:11,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Later.

732
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:12,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

733
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:16,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Why does he always try to start a fight?

734
00:47:17,654 --> 00:47:19,095
[SPEAKER_02]: It's every time you're here, too.

735
00:47:19,175 --> 00:47:20,917
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't bring up in the groove unless you're here.

736
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:24,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll come back with, you know, correct answers and the truth.

737
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the next call.

738
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:27,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

739
00:47:30,505 --> 00:47:31,085
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not.

740
00:47:31,526 --> 00:47:33,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

741
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:39,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

742
00:47:42,438 --> 00:47:43,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, no one's there.

743
00:47:43,198 --> 00:47:44,519
[SPEAKER_02]: The volume's too low, dude.

744
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:45,320
[SPEAKER_02]: We gotta let you go.

745
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to somebody else.

746
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

747
00:47:48,062 --> 00:47:48,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Sky.

748
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:49,662
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Raven Stolfen.

749
00:47:49,803 --> 00:47:50,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Raven Stolfen.

750
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:51,243
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

751
00:47:52,824 --> 00:47:57,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what's on my mind is those press conferences that before E3.

752
00:47:57,607 --> 00:47:57,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

753
00:47:59,108 --> 00:47:59,789
[SPEAKER_08]: On our mind, too.

754
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:02,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one is you most excited for?

755
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:06,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo, because they're holding the biggest package in their pants still.

756
00:48:08,257 --> 00:48:09,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it's the Wii.

757
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:11,219
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it!

758
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,683
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm interested in seeing PlayStation, or Sonys, and Nintendos.

759
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:21,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Microsoft, I couldn't care, because they're, well, now it's probably Halo 3, which, oh my god, I didn't know that was coming out.

760
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:23,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.

761
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:29,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Xbox may, I'm looking forward to all of them, because I think Xbox may, I want to know if they're going to say anything about HD DVD.

762
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:31,616
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I, I just want to know if they're going to even go there.

763
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:32,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to laugh at them.

764
00:48:33,537 --> 00:48:34,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, stop.

765
00:48:34,258 --> 00:48:34,838
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fine.

766
00:48:34,858 --> 00:48:35,439
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong.

767
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:35,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

768
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:37,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the E3 on PSP.

769
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:38,094
[SPEAKER_08]: That made me very giddy as hell.

770
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:38,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're glad.

771
00:49:05,903 --> 00:49:09,869
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm glad there's a lot of diversity on Orange Lounge Radio.

772
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:17,218
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a girl, there's a gay guy, and there is a straight married dude that just loves Windows to death.

773
00:49:19,505 --> 00:49:43,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, we're an odd pairing of people, but, you know, we like games, and I like the fact that we're just... I think part of what makes our show so interesting, if I can have an ego here for a minute, is what I like about this program is that we don't make it any secret that we have lives outside of gaming, and sometimes we're a little tongue-in-cheek with our gaming, but we're real, you know, and that's just what we want to bring to you guys.

774
00:49:43,264 --> 00:49:44,685
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, a real show.

775
00:49:45,105 --> 00:49:45,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I think...

776
00:49:46,226 --> 00:49:57,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of what I really liked about the show I used to be on, Under Sedation Live, that I'm trying to bring over here to Orange Lounge Radio, was the fact that it just sounded like a bunch of people at Denny's sitting around talking shit.

777
00:49:57,415 --> 00:49:58,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we do here.

778
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:05,342
[SPEAKER_02]: We just kind of sit around and talk and let you guys all eavesdrop in on it and participate in the big thing as well.

779
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:10,146
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't do it so much in the beginning, but now we can let you guys join us at the big table.

780
00:50:10,446 --> 00:50:10,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

781
00:50:11,267 --> 00:50:13,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, one more thing about the wedding.

782
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:18,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to a Jewish wedding, and yeah, they do have the little chairs up in the air.

783
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:25,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we didn't do it because her relatives weren't getting up and doing anything.

784
00:50:25,612 --> 00:50:27,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Another thing that got botched at your wedding.

785
00:50:27,812 --> 00:50:29,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, at least you didn't get hurt.

786
00:50:30,013 --> 00:50:30,994
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

787
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:33,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Because my sister got hurt in that.

788
00:50:35,055 --> 00:50:35,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

789
00:50:37,428 --> 00:50:40,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe those weddings should come with disclaimers to be more careful.

790
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:40,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

791
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:41,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course weddings.

792
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:45,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no problem with them, but, you know, I've been in one.

793
00:50:45,873 --> 00:50:46,233
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

794
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:47,614
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we've got to let you go.

795
00:50:47,634 --> 00:50:48,414
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to talk games.

796
00:50:48,454 --> 00:50:49,334
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk weddings later.

797
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:50,135
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

798
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:50,815
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, later, dude.

799
00:50:50,975 --> 00:50:52,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I found Spanish video game sites.

800
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:53,677
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

801
00:50:53,697 --> 00:50:55,718
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of them, and I used Google Mexico.

802
00:50:57,239 --> 00:50:58,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, good thought.

803
00:50:58,559 --> 00:50:59,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Google.com.mx.

804
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,121
[SPEAKER_02]: What, Miklatov, what?

805
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:05,263
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to censor me.

806
00:51:08,122 --> 00:51:08,942
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a free country.

807
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:11,443
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's okay.

808
00:51:11,463 --> 00:51:14,164
[SPEAKER_11]: I just didn't know dirty Mexicans could use the internet.

809
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:16,225
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

810
00:51:16,685 --> 00:51:17,025
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

811
00:51:17,925 --> 00:51:19,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bringing tequila to E3.

812
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:19,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

813
00:51:20,846 --> 00:51:22,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

814
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:29,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, uh... Sorry, but you're cutting out.

815
00:51:29,709 --> 00:51:33,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So all we heard was the hey, and then it went dead silent.

816
00:51:33,871 --> 00:51:34,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is this?

817
00:51:35,603 --> 00:51:36,483
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt.

818
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:37,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, SSJ100 Matt.

819
00:51:37,564 --> 00:51:38,384
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

820
00:51:39,685 --> 00:51:41,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Mazel Tov on your wedding, Loki, by the way.

821
00:51:41,746 --> 00:51:42,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

822
00:51:42,746 --> 00:51:43,066
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

823
00:51:45,727 --> 00:52:01,814
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wanted to talk about when Sephiroth1215 called in, he was trying to explain... You know how in... Oh, you know, with Supernova, he was trying to explain... You know how in Konomics, you know how you had to select all songs in order to get all the songs?

824
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:03,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

825
00:52:05,596 --> 00:52:07,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you kind of have to do that with Supernova.

826
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:09,677
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of annoying.

827
00:52:09,857 --> 00:52:10,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really the end of the world?

828
00:52:11,697 --> 00:52:12,817
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's just kind of annoying.

829
00:52:12,877 --> 00:52:14,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really going to ruin the game for people?

830
00:52:15,418 --> 00:52:15,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

831
00:52:16,138 --> 00:52:17,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so what's the big fucking deal?

832
00:52:17,938 --> 00:52:18,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

833
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:19,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, enough said.

834
00:52:20,399 --> 00:52:21,279
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is on your mind?

835
00:52:21,299 --> 00:52:22,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Problem solved.

836
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:22,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Problem solved.

837
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Um... Uh... Uh... I don't know, that threw me off track.

838
00:52:31,001 --> 00:52:31,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

839
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I got nothing else to say.

840
00:52:36,174 --> 00:52:36,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Gong.

841
00:52:37,516 --> 00:52:37,856
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

842
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:42,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to do that to somebody all night long.

843
00:52:42,881 --> 00:52:43,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor guy.

844
00:52:43,741 --> 00:52:44,062
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

845
00:52:44,722 --> 00:52:48,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

846
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:51,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

847
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:52,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, who's this?

848
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,271
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Hurricane Z-Man.

849
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:55,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Hurricane what?

850
00:52:56,733 --> 00:52:57,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Z-Man.

851
00:52:57,434 --> 00:52:59,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Hurricane Z-Man, what's on your mind?

852
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:05,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to know what you guys thought of Final Fantasy XII.

853
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:10,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there isn't a whole lot out about it, but I was thoroughly disappointed with Final Fantasy XI.

854
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:12,116
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

855
00:53:12,996 --> 00:53:13,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here's the thing.

856
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:17,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI is a completely different game.

857
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:20,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It took the Final Fantasy universe and turned it upside down.

858
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:20,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.

859
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:28,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played the Final Fantasy XII demo, and I've played it twice now, essentially, because I played the E3 demo a couple years ago when they actually had it there.

860
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,165
[SPEAKER_02]: That was stupid the first demo they had.

861
00:53:30,325 --> 00:53:33,646
[SPEAKER_02]: But the demo they put in with Dragon Quest VIII is great.

862
00:53:33,986 --> 00:53:39,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing that's great about it is that it fuses that Final Fantasy XI universe with the rest of it.

863
00:53:39,688 --> 00:53:46,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to say that to kind of put you off, but what I'm saying is that it kind of makes XI make sense.

864
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:52,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Because honestly, in the scope of all the Final Fantasy games, I think the only one that XI has a lot in common with is II.

865
00:53:54,238 --> 00:53:58,941
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go and play Final Fantasy 2, it's actually very similar to 11 in some ways, without the whole real-time battle.

866
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:01,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was 4.

867
00:54:02,703 --> 00:54:04,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong.

868
00:54:04,724 --> 00:54:09,626
[SPEAKER_02]: 4 will forever be my favorite, with 6 a close runner-up, just because I'm a Super Nintendo brat.

869
00:54:09,987 --> 00:54:12,888
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think 12 is going to be really great.

870
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:18,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard really good things from folks who've imported the Japanese version.

871
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:22,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't bothered to look at it because I can't really understand Japanese anymore.

872
00:54:22,193 --> 00:54:26,254
[SPEAKER_02]: and I want my first experience with the game to be one that I understand fully.

873
00:54:27,174 --> 00:54:36,916
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't see many reasons why this will disappoint, but I think the only thing that's going to turn people off is the battle system, because it is a little more like XI's, but not... Which is crap.

874
00:54:37,456 --> 00:54:38,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is fun.

875
00:54:38,216 --> 00:54:47,397
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I like XI's battle system, and I think the problem that you had with XI was that you had to sit around and wait for a party, and then when you got one, the people were, you know, bossy.

876
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid, retarded, brain damaged.

877
00:54:49,758 --> 00:54:51,198
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Final Fantasy XII, you're the boss.

878
00:54:51,929 --> 00:54:52,789
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all your bitches.

879
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:55,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch of the White Mage.

880
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

881
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:56,730
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

882
00:54:57,371 --> 00:54:59,251
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that, dude?

883
00:54:59,291 --> 00:54:59,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds a lot better.

884
00:55:00,311 --> 00:55:01,072
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's it.

923
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:12,916
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for tonight's program.

924
00:57:13,956 --> 00:57:14,417

00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:46,982
[SPEAKER_12]: If you are a fan of Bomani stuff, and this is Bomani related, Diverse Systems released a new album, Dear Mr. Tak.

00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:48,423
[SPEAKER_12]: All Tak remixes.

951
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:43,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell everyone you know about E3 on PSP.com because we're so excited about it and we wish we could have launched it about a week earlier but somebody had to go and get married so we're trying to get the word out there quick so spread the word.

952
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:47,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Spread the word like a bad disease.

953
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:49,502

00:58:49,642 --> 00:58:49,822
