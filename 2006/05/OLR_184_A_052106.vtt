Today, May 21, 2006, in an OLR exclusive, new evidence may have given us the release

00:19.120 --> 00:24.960
date of the Wii, Xbox's firmware is hacked and Microsoft responds, and a warning on E3

00:24.960 --> 00:25.960
downloads.

00:25.960 --> 00:36.380
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.380 --> 00:42.400
This is episode number 184 for this May 21, 2006.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.040
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

00:45.040 --> 00:49.480
Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.480
Wee!

00:50.480 --> 00:51.480
Wee!

00:51.480 --> 00:52.480
How are you?

00:52.480 --> 00:53.480
Tired.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.480
Tired?

00:54.480 --> 00:55.480
Long weekend?

00:55.480 --> 01:01.920
And I actually just got back off the road literally ten minutes ago. You drove right up into the OLR studio

01:01.920 --> 01:06.240
Hey, Louis, you crashed into the building lots of damn it. No, I'm kidding. I wouldn't do that to my baby

01:07.120 --> 01:09.240
No, I thought I ran into Loki's car. I

01:10.400 --> 01:14.380
Thought it was very interesting how you told me you were staying awake on most of the road

01:14.380 --> 01:15.600
How are you staying awake?

01:15.600 --> 01:21.880
You gave me the one of these little C's chocolate lollipop things C's lollipops are the best thing ever

01:21.940 --> 01:24.220
Except for the fact that got rid of peanut butter so screw them

01:24.220 --> 01:26.220
I was chewing on it and like

01:27.100 --> 01:32.780
Like like this reason once you can't like bite through right and then like suck it on them and then like a part broke off

01:32.780 --> 01:35.380
And it was it had a sharp edge and it cut my tongue ow

01:36.020 --> 01:43.060
So yeah right here, and then that lasted me from about right before the 360 toll booth not 360

01:44.460 --> 01:47.240
680 at least you're in a gaming gaming mode we know

01:49.060 --> 01:51.060
Until without a Oh

01:51.060 --> 01:56.140
Davis and then I was like is there a highway 360 somewhere I mentioned

01:56.140 --> 01:58.340
there's got to be sure there is somewhere on the East Coast where there's

01:58.340 --> 02:01.780
nothing but highways out there they're there highways here they're freeways

02:01.780 --> 02:07.860
anyway also say hello to the one and only tech master Loki hello I'm here

02:07.860 --> 02:12.300
yeah yeah you're here I'm here supporting your new Silent Hill t-shirt

02:12.300 --> 02:16.580
I like well it's not new but yeah where'd you get that I got us from work

02:16.580 --> 02:21.300
Oh, lucky you. I went into Hot Topic this weekend, you know,

02:21.300 --> 02:24.860
tease me if you want for going in there, but, you know,

02:24.860 --> 02:28.540
they sell some cool stuff sometimes, and also they had the Silent Hill Pyramid

02:28.540 --> 02:30.660
Head t-shirt, which rocked, so I had to pick that up.

02:30.660 --> 02:34.460
They finally got that in? Yes, they had it at the... I tried to go before E3.

02:34.460 --> 02:37.460
Yeah, so did I, because I wanted to wear one to E3, but they have them now.

02:37.460 --> 02:41.300
So, they also have the Silent... There's another shirt that says Silent Hill on the

02:41.300 --> 02:41.780
side,

02:41.780 --> 02:45.580
and it's got the bunny thing on the back, so I didn't get that one,

02:45.580 --> 02:49.320
because Pyramid Head rocks. Bunny's creepy. I finally saw what the Silent Hill 3

02:49.320 --> 02:52.420
memory file icon looks like, and it's just that bunny running.

02:52.420 --> 02:57.700
Alright, anyway, let's talk about games. I'd like to start it off with a

02:57.700 --> 02:59.780
little bit of how was your gaming week?

02:59.780 --> 03:03.460
I know we've kind of cooled down from E3 a little bit and probably tried to get

03:03.460 --> 03:05.880
our personal lives going again because there was

03:05.880 --> 03:09.560
definitely a lot of craziness at E3, but was there any time for games? Anybody check out

03:09.560 --> 03:10.800
some games? Dark Sakura?

03:10.800 --> 03:15.380
Well, actually we played a lot of Kingdom Hearts this weekend.

03:15.380 --> 03:19.820
from like 1 until 3 in the morning, trying to figure out why

03:19.820 --> 03:23.940
I couldn't get back to Agrabah on my game, because I sort of skipped it, I went right from

03:23.940 --> 03:25.420
Pirates of the Caribbean to

03:25.420 --> 03:29.340
Halloweentown, and now I can't get back into Agrabah and the Pride Lands

03:29.340 --> 03:33.000
but Dan somehow did that because he did that before he went to Halloweentown

03:33.000 --> 03:36.340
so we're trying to figure out if I need to like start my game over or just

03:36.340 --> 03:40.620
you know whatever, so hey if anyone knows please let me know, send me a PM in the chat room

03:40.620 --> 03:46.220
And then we went to the Winchester Mystery House and there was an arcade there.

03:46.220 --> 03:50.780
I played Theater of Magic. That's one of my favorite pinball tables ever.

03:50.780 --> 03:53.940
That's one of my favorite pinball tables ever. I would say Baby Pac-Man,

03:53.940 --> 03:58.060
Pin-Bot, Theater of Magic. Although I do have a lot of love for Adam's family.

03:58.060 --> 04:01.780
Baby Pac-Man, Black Knight 2000, Theater of Magic.

04:01.780 --> 04:04.940
But I played X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

04:04.940 --> 04:08.620
And their controller was broken, so I called the manager.

04:08.620 --> 04:12.580
I know because I was gonna get my later. I didn't really care about my 50 cents

04:12.580 --> 04:15.740
I was like, um, the controller's broken on x-men versus she fires

04:15.740 --> 04:19.700
Oh, well, you can go to the gift table and get your money back. I was like, so are you going to fix it?

04:20.820 --> 04:23.860
And he's like, uh eventually I was like that's not good enough

04:24.620 --> 04:30.620
You should go have a look at it and he just did wandered off looking pissed off and I was like dick

04:32.260 --> 04:35.020
All right, I worked for an arcade

04:35.020 --> 04:41.600
Okay, I know that you can just take out the joystick put in a new one or you fix the contacts. It's great

04:41.600 --> 04:44.460
I own arcade machines now. That's why it was it

04:44.460 --> 04:48.660
Did it feel just like it was a broken contact like the joystick felt fine the joystick felt fine

04:48.660 --> 04:53.160
It wasn't moving up or down. That's probably just a contact. Yeah flame

04:53.460 --> 04:57.900
Yeah, so I was like, so don't play a x-men versus Street Fighter at the Winchester Mystery House

04:59.140 --> 05:03.860
Other than that which is from mystery house rocks speaking of our chat room because you brought them up orange laundry

05:03.860 --> 05:08.780
click on chat we love being an interactive program and DMN is winner

05:08.780 --> 05:13.900
because he went on the Wikipedia and quickly found Texas State Highway 360 so

05:13.900 --> 05:18.980
there is a highway 360 in Texas good job of which we are not based in we're in

05:18.980 --> 05:27.660
California Loki how was your gaming week it was good I purchased an actual game

05:27.660 --> 05:33.500
for the DS new Super Mario Brothers and it was pretty fun just plays like

05:33.500 --> 05:41.260
I don't know kind of a cross between Super Mario World a little bit of I don't know some of the like

05:42.180 --> 05:44.180
objects have to get it kind of reminds me of

05:44.940 --> 05:51.260
Yoshi's Island a little bit and then Super Mario 3 this is kind of a combination of those, but it's fun. Just Mario

05:51.260 --> 05:57.500
Yeah, so I played that and of course I had a craving for Ridge Racer all week Ridge Racer

05:57.500 --> 06:04.340
So I played Ridge Racer 6 and that was fun and then I played Uno and that was retarded

06:04.340 --> 06:05.580
and I don't know why I bought that game.

06:05.580 --> 06:06.580
You don't like Uno?

06:06.580 --> 06:07.580
No.

06:07.580 --> 06:08.580
Uno is also- wait!

06:08.580 --> 06:12.420
Dark Sakura, I've noticed and maybe you haven't because you were gone this weekend but your

06:12.420 --> 06:14.740
husband has been on Uno like non-stop.

06:14.740 --> 06:21.220
It's Dan and freaking Will playing Uno like all the time and I'm like I go in the room

06:21.220 --> 06:25.460
I mean okay I have no problem with him playing Uno because it's not reeee, reeee, reeee.

06:25.460 --> 06:29.900
Uno is a nice, although that music in Uno, thank god for Xbox 360 custom soundtracks

06:29.900 --> 06:31.900
because the music in Uno, cheesy!

06:31.900 --> 06:37.000
I'm like, Dan? What the hell? I was like, you've got a pinball machine!

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I was like, but Uno...

06:39.000 --> 06:42.500
But seriously, I was looking at the rankings on my friends list, and Dan of course is number one.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.500
He's played well over a hundred matches on that game.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.500
No seriously, he does like freaking tournament play.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.000
Oh my, that's sick!

06:49.000 --> 06:52.600
He actually has done the win the game with the wild draw seven as a draw four.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.040
I got that achievement by total luck. Total luck.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.520
He's gotten, like, all kinds of crap on that game, and I'm like,

06:59.520 --> 07:03.280
it's Uno! I have him in my car right now!

07:03.280 --> 07:06.480
I have a box of Uno cards! We could play

07:06.480 --> 07:10.520
real Uno! And have our friends over!

07:10.520 --> 07:14.280
Dork? My husband's a dork! I love him to death that my husband's a dork!

07:14.280 --> 07:18.480
That's alright. It's part of why you married him, right? Yeah. Then I bought Birds of a Feather.

07:18.480 --> 07:22.480
I bought Bejeweled 2 for Nellie the play, and she's been on that for

07:22.480 --> 07:27.500
a long time. I actually got to play a little bit of it today. It's okay. I don't know if

07:27.500 --> 07:32.440
it's worth the 800 Microsoft points, which I think is about 10 bucks. So I'm not sure

07:32.440 --> 07:38.940
if, actually I'm pretty sure that it's not worth 10 bucks. Bejeweled? No, it's another

07:38.940 --> 07:43.620
one of those games that you can play on the computer anytime for free, and there's no

07:43.620 --> 07:50.960
real multiplayer element. It's a very pretty game on the HD, and the achievements are impossible.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.440
I don't think I've seen a game with harder achievements than Bejeweled.

07:53.440 --> 07:57.760
They have puzzle mode on there, and I'm gonna cheat my way through puzzle mode.

07:57.760 --> 07:58.760
That's lame.

07:58.760 --> 08:02.280
That's how you know you're an achievement points whore, because you're doing the lame

08:02.280 --> 08:06.520
game FAQs or whatever cheat through your Bejeweled game.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.040
Lame.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.040
I made it through those.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.040
You're what's wrong with America.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.520
I don't care.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.560
It's more achievement points.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.560
Alright.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.520
And then, um, what else did they play?

08:16.520 --> 08:19.760
I think that was pretty much, well, Grand Theft Auto, of course, we didn't play more

08:19.760 --> 08:26.640
and just, I don't know, it's been fun. I just, we need a new game now. New Grand Theft Auto.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.440
We're not going to a new game, we're just waiting for the next Grand Theft Auto to come

08:29.440 --> 08:34.960
out, so. Alright. Sooner than later, hopefully. What about Saints Row or whatever that one

08:34.960 --> 08:40.080
was at E3 that's kinda like Grand Theft Auto? I guess, well, I mean, you can't really play

08:40.080 --> 08:43.460
that multiplayer, like, at least with Break. Oh, okay, gotcha. Yeah, that's the only thing.

08:43.460 --> 08:48.480
We need it on PSP, so, you know, I'd be all down for, you know, playing multiplayer Grand

08:48.480 --> 08:53.600
thought and I hope to God that they have multiplayer in the Liberty City stories on Playstation

08:53.600 --> 08:58.280
2. I don't think they will, but if they do that's going to be awesome because then I'll

08:58.280 --> 09:05.040
get to kick people's asses across the country. But right now it's just, I don't know, it's

09:05.040 --> 09:11.120
fun. We kind of mix it up a little bit, try to mix up the teams and make it really close.

09:11.120 --> 09:17.320
But I don't know. And then I played, was it Astro Pop? I don't like that. I think anything

09:17.320 --> 09:20.480
PopCap sucks.

09:20.480 --> 09:25.000
I've been buying these games just to try them and, you know, I don't know.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.160
I should probably just download the demo.

09:27.160 --> 09:31.280
I have a weird appreciation for Zuma on the 360.

09:31.280 --> 09:35.280
I don't know what it is, but maybe it's something about the analog stick control or something,

09:35.280 --> 09:39.580
but that one bugs me the least out of those PopCap stuff.

09:39.580 --> 09:44.760
But dual control's fine, it's just I don't like how, okay, no more moves, you know, and

09:44.760 --> 09:45.760
you're fucked.

09:45.760 --> 09:50.880
not my fault that there's no more moves. It's the fact that there's, you know, random blocks

09:50.880 --> 09:56.460
and I didn't quite, you know, get that. And there's people cheating in the DS Tetris now.

09:56.460 --> 10:01.120
What the hell is that? I read about that. It's not on the show. How lame is that? I

10:01.120 --> 10:04.440
think someone in our forum said it best. I'm so sorry that I'm not crediting this person.

10:04.440 --> 10:08.000
I'm too lazy to look at the forums. But somebody said, put a game online and people will cheat

10:08.000 --> 10:13.080
on it. End of story. Somebody won't find a way to cheat. Sad. How are they cheating?

10:13.080 --> 10:19.280
Weren't they giving themselves nothing but the line of four like how when you use the star item you get nothing

10:19.280 --> 10:21.800
But the line blocks that's what this person did right pretty much

10:22.720 --> 10:27.720
Damn cheaters and all I get cheat all you want offline. I don't care but cheating online bad

10:29.200 --> 10:33.240
All right, yeah anything else that's it going to the chat room

10:33.840 --> 10:38.400
Nintendo maniac 64 is amazed Loki got Nelly to play a video game because we know your wife hate names

10:38.400 --> 10:40.400
That was tricky.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
That's amazing, that's good.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.400
You took the wife to see Silent Hill, right?

10:44.400 --> 10:45.400
Yeah. What'd you think?

10:45.400 --> 10:47.400
She didn't sleep well.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.400
But she likes Pyramid Head?

10:48.400 --> 10:50.400
She didn't think he was that scary.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
She thought the Ash babies were more freaky.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.400
Ash babies are hella freaky.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.400
I hated the people.

10:56.400 --> 11:01.400
Well, I got dragged to the Vinci Code the night before.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.400
I saw that.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.400
We were gonna go see like three movies this weekend.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.400
We were gonna go see Over the Hedge also.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.400
Just didn't make it to it.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.480
to it. We wanted to see Silent Hill before it left theaters because right now it's only

11:11.480 --> 11:19.480
playing twice. It's either 210 or 940. So it's like crap, you know? It was okay, it's

11:19.480 --> 11:24.360
just there was a bunch of teenagers there, teenage girls, and they were fucking retarded.

11:24.360 --> 11:27.720
And there was some guy behind us that was like craving attention that just wouldn't

11:27.720 --> 11:30.400
fucking shut up. And he was an adult, you know?

11:30.400 --> 11:31.540
I hate that.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.080
So I don't get it.

11:33.080 --> 11:37.100
Blaze in our chatroom says Pyramid Head is the star of Silent Hill. Agreed. Pyramid Head

11:37.100 --> 11:43.340
is a total rock star. Also, folks are going back and talking about the whole UNO on cards

11:43.340 --> 11:50.340
versus UNO on Xbox Live. Jeremy Todd 1 says, Virtual UNO, greater than real UNO. DMN says,

11:50.340 --> 11:56.420
hell, look at hot coffee. No need to even have real sex anymore, which I significantly

11:56.420 --> 12:04.780
agree with. What we need, apples to apples. That'd be great. Yeah, rumor is that Texas

12:04.780 --> 12:06.300
Hold'em is on its way.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.300
Eh, lame.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.300
Uh, let's see.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.300
What else was said here?

12:09.300 --> 12:10.300
Up here.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.580
Oh, Bosstone says, who wants reality when you can have video games?

12:12.580 --> 12:13.580
I don't know, guys.

12:13.580 --> 12:14.820
Go outside once in a while.

12:14.820 --> 12:16.940
It's a big, big world out there.

12:16.940 --> 12:20.980
We are all for playing games, but balancing that with the real world.

12:20.980 --> 12:23.260
Anyway, my gaming week.

12:23.260 --> 12:26.880
Not a lot of new stuff except for, of course, the new Super Mario Brothers, which I should

12:26.880 --> 12:31.800
petition to have renamed New Super Mario Brothers 3, because that's what it felt a little more

12:31.800 --> 12:36.720
like to me but you know all kidding aside it's it's it's really a great game

12:36.720 --> 12:41.920
I don't think it's gonna be like best DS game ever for me but it's good it's a

12:41.920 --> 12:45.560
solid game and especially folks that have fond memories of the Super Mario

12:45.560 --> 12:50.360
Brothers series it plays just like a new entry like if they had made Super Mario

12:50.360 --> 12:55.520
Brothers 4 at some point you know this would be what it is so it's it's a good

12:55.520 --> 12:59.880
game and it's fun and I like multiplayer is a hell of a lot of fun if you play

12:59.880 --> 13:05.880
the multiplayer, where you are competing against somebody else to get stars in one level, that

13:05.880 --> 13:06.880
is a lot of fun.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.120
The Mario vs Luigi or whatever.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.960
I was listening to Extrofer and his sister play that the other night while I was playing

13:12.960 --> 13:18.480
Final Fantasy XI, and man, they were just screaming at each other, like they were really

13:18.480 --> 13:19.600
getting into it.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.420
I played a little bit of it, and it's quite fun.

13:21.420 --> 13:24.000
They have also the multiplayer mini-games too.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.280
Well, the only thing that disappointed me was that the single-player mini-games were,

13:27.280 --> 13:31.760
For the most part, all the Mario 64 games, which was a little bit of a, hmm, couldn't

13:31.760 --> 13:32.760
you have just...

13:32.760 --> 13:34.580
Well, I think that you unlocked more as you played through the game.

13:34.580 --> 13:38.520
I think so too, but, you know, I was a little, there was that initial disappointment of,

13:38.520 --> 13:40.440
hmm, haven't I seen all this before?

13:40.440 --> 13:43.420
But yeah, I'm not going to knock the game for that because there's plenty else to do

13:43.420 --> 13:44.420
in it.

13:44.420 --> 13:49.160
So, I do recommend New Super Mario Brothers if you're a DS, if you have any fond memories

13:49.160 --> 13:54.120
of Super Mario Brothers 1, 3, World, whatever, it's a great addition.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.720
By the way, you mentioning your addiction?

13:56.720 --> 13:58.720
I signed back up for World of Warcraft.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.720
No, not really.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.720
I played it once since I signed back up.

14:02.720 --> 14:09.720
Actually, and then if you want to continue on my game a week, of course I've been playing quite a bit of Final Fantasy XI, because I'm just, you know, addicted like that.

14:09.720 --> 14:14.720
Uno would be the other thing I've also been playing. It's fun.

14:14.720 --> 14:20.720
I also downloaded the Lost Planet demo on Xbox 360.

14:20.720 --> 14:25.600
Because, you know, I heard about all this stuff at E3, but since there was a lot of

14:25.600 --> 14:29.960
people wanting to play this stuff at E3 Outpost, I never really got my hands on it myself.

14:29.960 --> 14:30.960
So I had to kind of wait.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.280
Well, I got my hands on Uno, but I didn't get my hands on Lost Planet.

14:33.280 --> 14:37.360
So I kind of had to wait until I got home, and I don't know, I guess it's just not really

14:37.360 --> 14:38.360
my kind of game.

14:38.360 --> 14:42.440
I mean, it's pretty looking, and I can see where fans of that type of genre would be

14:42.440 --> 14:45.720
really into it, but for me, it wasn't the most...

14:45.720 --> 14:49.680
Like, I heard a lot of comments like, best game of show, or one of the best games of

14:49.680 --> 14:53.580
the show and it's great and I was just kind of like I feel like I've kind of played

14:53.580 --> 14:54.580
this before.

14:54.580 --> 15:00.400
I don't know what was so dang special about it for me but again that's not my primary

15:00.400 --> 15:05.700
genre of games and not the type of game I'm used to so I suppose if I was like really

15:05.700 --> 15:10.460
really into those types of mid-venture shooters I'd probably get a lot more of a thrill out

15:10.460 --> 15:11.460
of it.

15:11.460 --> 15:15.620
It's certainly a good looking game so it's nice to see that type of stuff on next gen.

15:15.620 --> 15:21.060
Alright anyway, that was our gaming week, so let's start to get into the news, and we're

15:21.060 --> 15:25.140
going to start off with some bits on the Nintendo Wii.

15:25.140 --> 15:26.500
First let's set the stage a little bit.

15:26.500 --> 15:29.220
We have kind of something really big we want to get into, but let's set the stage a little

15:29.220 --> 15:30.220
bit.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.700
Loki, a big gaming news site, runs predictions for the Wii, yes?

15:33.700 --> 15:40.420
Yeah, Kotaku, they had a little story about how EB Games is, I guess they have a placeholder

15:40.420 --> 15:48.940
for Madden on the Wii, and it says, I believe it was August 30th, and you know, they're

15:48.940 --> 15:55.380
saying, you know, raises the question, are they going to release in the summer? Of course,

15:55.380 --> 16:00.500
you know, the track record of EB and stuff, I mean, I think they had PS3 stuff in there

16:00.500 --> 16:07.420
like a long time ago. And so, I don't know. But you never know. So right now it's just

16:07.420 --> 16:09.900
speculation, maybe summer.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.540
All right, interesting.

16:11.540 --> 16:15.500
Also, if you head on over to wenintendo.net,

16:15.500 --> 16:18.940
they're tracking, I guess, all the games that

16:18.940 --> 16:20.980
have been announced and what type of stuff

16:20.980 --> 16:22.460
is coming out on the Wii.

16:22.460 --> 16:25.420
And of course, they list all the basics, the remote,

16:25.420 --> 16:27.300
the nunchuck, the classic controller

16:27.300 --> 16:29.140
if you turn the remote on the side,

16:29.140 --> 16:30.860
the retro controller, the light gun

16:30.860 --> 16:32.780
that they showed in the case, which was kind of cool.

16:32.780 --> 16:34.140
And then they get on to the games.

16:34.140 --> 16:36.740
And these are the games they're listing as launch games.

16:36.740 --> 16:42.260
Zelda, Twilight Princess, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, Wii Sports, Red Steel, Tony Hawk

16:42.260 --> 16:50.860
Downhill Jam, Madden NFL 2007 Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen, Tower

16:50.860 --> 16:55.580
of Mirrors, Super Monkey Ball, Banana Blitz, Metal Slug Anthology, Trauma Center Second

16:55.580 --> 17:03.360
Opinion, Elibits, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Blitz the League, Rayman Raving Rabbits, Sponge

17:03.360 --> 17:07.760
Bob Squarepants Creature from the Krusty Krab, Disney, Pixar's Cars is what they've

17:07.760 --> 17:11.320
got listed as the launch titles for the Wii.

17:11.320 --> 17:17.500
So now, as you may recall on Orange Launch Radio, a couple months ago we posted a little

17:17.500 --> 17:22.320
bit of a spoiler on our website, so you could say, and that had to do with Castlevania Portrait

17:22.320 --> 17:25.160
of Ruin and the trio of new DDR games, right?

17:25.160 --> 17:29.040
And remind us, Loki, how did you find this information before any of the major gaming

17:29.040 --> 17:30.040
sites did?

17:30.040 --> 17:34.080
It's just stuff that the retailers let them know.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.600
As soon as they get updated dates on stuff,

17:36.600 --> 17:38.800
they will let their retailers know.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.480
And since I work in, not really retail,

17:41.480 --> 17:42.680
but I work in distribution,

17:42.680 --> 17:45.800
I'm able to see this information.

17:45.800 --> 17:50.040
Whereas most people who work in the media industry,

17:50.040 --> 17:53.400
they don't work in retail or don't really have

17:53.400 --> 17:55.060
someone that's right there looking

17:55.060 --> 17:56.920
for this kind of stuff like I do.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.920
interesting now but that but to be to but to be fair in the interest of you

18:00.920 --> 18:01.120
know

18:01.120 --> 18:04.600
disclosing everything you didn't get everything a hundred percent correct

18:04.600 --> 18:05.600
right now

18:05.600 --> 18:09.680
there's stuff changes all the time right me likes and was it silent hill original

18:09.680 --> 18:10.280
sin

18:10.280 --> 18:13.640
right change to origins which is even a working title now so it could change

18:13.640 --> 18:14.240
again

18:14.240 --> 18:19.060
and then if I recall right the death or death junior PSP had a subtitle whereas

18:19.060 --> 18:20.720
in your list it didn't write is just that

18:20.720 --> 18:24.480
yeah cuz they change names on stuff all the time okay you know

18:24.480 --> 18:27.560
Cause it's, you know, Death Junior 2 maybe

18:27.560 --> 18:31.600
they want something a little bit more. And as we all know release dates get shifted

18:31.600 --> 18:35.520
all the time. Yeah. All the time. Look at a game like Dead or Alive 4.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.800
I mean that game just got was constantly getting inched out a little further a

18:38.800 --> 18:40.040
little further each time right?

18:40.040 --> 18:43.120
Yeah. Okay well now I ask you has anything interesting showed up in your

18:43.120 --> 18:43.960
database this week?

18:43.960 --> 18:48.440
Of course. You know it's after E3. Lots of stuff is going to show up in the database and

18:48.440 --> 18:52.200
well we do have, you know, the PS3 stuff which is kinda interesting.

18:52.200 --> 18:58.720
The thing I was most interested in was the Wii games, and we have four of them.

18:58.720 --> 19:03.100
And what's even more interesting is the dates on those four games than when they're supposed

19:03.100 --> 19:05.180
to be coming out.

19:05.180 --> 19:10.340
So the four games that I have, Avatar the Last Airbender, which of course is a Nickelodeon

19:10.340 --> 19:14.920
franchise, Chicken Little Ace in Action, sequel to Chicken Little Game that came out, Metal

19:14.920 --> 19:18.900
Slug Anthology, and SpongeBob Creature from the Crusted Crab.

19:18.900 --> 19:22.380
Now that's interesting because two of those games we knew about, the Metal Slug Anthology

19:22.380 --> 19:26.820
and the Spongebob game of course, but the other two I hadn't really heard of before,

19:26.820 --> 19:31.060
and of course I don't really follow Nickelodeon games, I imagine most people do, or don't,

19:31.060 --> 19:34.900
but I don't even remember reading about these anywhere.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.700
So those kind of showed up out of the blue.

19:36.700 --> 19:40.140
The other thing I also want to mention though is these are from three different companies,

19:40.140 --> 19:46.940
so you know, if this is going to be taken as speculation, it should be, you know, it's

19:46.940 --> 19:49.480
It's not just one company throwing their games at us.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.480
Three different companies have all put their games in.

19:50.480 --> 19:57.520
You've got Buena Vista, THQ, and I don't remember the last one, oh, SNK, so that was interesting.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.560
So what are the dates?

19:58.560 --> 20:06.200
The dates, Chicken Little and Metal Slug, October 11th, and for Avatar and Spongebob,

20:06.200 --> 20:08.000
October 18th.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
So there you have it.

20:09.000 --> 20:14.080
The Wii launch, we're speculating, has got to be in this time frame somewhere, but that's

20:14.080 --> 20:15.360
interesting that there's the two different dates.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.600
have October 11th and October 18th.

20:17.600 --> 20:21.840
But they also, a lot of times, like for example the 360 launch stuff comes out before.

20:21.840 --> 20:25.460
That's exactly what I was thinking is that, so when I read it, because you posted this

20:25.460 --> 20:28.960
in our private forum, we were talking about, you know, tonight's show, and my first thought

20:28.960 --> 20:33.160
was, okay, it's kind of like the 360 where some games came out a week before and it looks

20:33.160 --> 20:37.320
like October 18th would be the launch of the Wii.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.700
And here's another thing about October 18th.

20:40.700 --> 20:41.700
October 18th.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.700
Is this the clincher?

20:42.700 --> 20:47.940
October 18th marks the anniversary of the original Nintendo Entertainment System launch

20:47.940 --> 20:49.500
in the United States.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.860
That's a very interesting coincidence.

20:51.860 --> 20:53.100
It is very interesting.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.100
Huh.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.100
Alright, so what do you think?

20:55.100 --> 20:56.380
October 18th is the day?

20:56.380 --> 20:57.380
I think they're going to be...

20:57.380 --> 20:59.380
Maybe the 11th, but most likely the 18th.

20:59.380 --> 21:05.180
I think the hardware is pretty close to done, and launching a month in advance against the

21:05.180 --> 21:07.700
PlayStation 3, I think it's probably going to happen.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.340
Okay, so Devil's Advocate here.

21:09.340 --> 21:13.540
I believe these dates in October versus the Madden date that we talked about just a little

21:13.540 --> 21:14.540
bit ago.

21:14.540 --> 21:21.020
Well, from like retail sites, EA for example, usually their dates, I mean, it could be,

21:21.020 --> 21:26.400
you know, a really early date, and especially a lot of times they'll put in dates for like

21:26.400 --> 21:31.860
Playstation 3, which is supposed to be in the spring, I think, they'll put stuff on

21:31.860 --> 21:33.300
there so they can take pre-orders.

21:33.300 --> 21:37.100
So it might not have a firm date, might have been a rumor, whatever.

21:37.100 --> 21:41.820
That would make sense because Madden is really one of those games that's going to...

21:41.820 --> 21:42.820
And here's the other thing too...

21:42.820 --> 21:44.860
There's a whole audience that will come over to the Wii just for Madden.

21:44.860 --> 21:49.220
And here's the other thing about that April, not April, August 30th date, that's the date

21:49.220 --> 21:51.680
when the other Madden games are coming out.

21:51.680 --> 21:58.100
That's not necessarily, because Madden 07 is coming out that day, well the 29th I think

21:58.100 --> 22:00.740
it was, on all systems.

22:00.740 --> 22:04.900
On Xbox 360 and all the current gen stuff.

22:04.900 --> 22:09.100
So that's probably why they have that date on there for the Wii, they just added another

22:09.100 --> 22:11.660
entry because they knew it was coming out on the Wii.

22:11.660 --> 22:14.280
Not necessarily meaning that it's coming out on that day.

22:14.280 --> 22:18.920
But that's just, you know, because obviously you know Madden came out last year, a lot

22:18.920 --> 22:22.980
later on the Xbox 360 for the launch.

22:22.980 --> 22:25.880
But I'm pretty confident on these.

22:25.880 --> 22:29.360
You know what, that makes perfect sense about the Madden thing because of all the other

22:29.360 --> 22:31.340
consoles around that same...

22:31.340 --> 22:32.340
You sold me.

22:32.340 --> 22:38.140
I think October 18th is the day, maybe October 11th.

22:38.140 --> 22:44.080
The anniversary thing, especially with the virtual console and everything, it just makes

22:44.080 --> 22:46.080
too much sense.

22:46.080 --> 22:50.860
They get the jump on the PlayStation 3 just by a little bit and enough time for the hype

22:50.860 --> 22:56.740
to build up a little bit before the crazy gaming season or I should say shopping season

22:56.740 --> 23:01.600
starts the day after Thanksgiving, so it gives a chance for the hardcore gamers to get their

23:01.600 --> 23:07.000
systems and sell out, and then the crazy parents getting it for their kids would jump in in

23:07.000 --> 23:08.360
November, and it would sell out.

23:08.360 --> 23:11.420
It seems like a smart kind of launch strategy, this date.

23:11.420 --> 23:12.420
I like this date.

23:12.420 --> 23:13.560
It makes a lot of sense.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.100
So yeah, that's what we've got so far.

23:16.100 --> 23:20.160
You know, it'd be cool if they launched the system worldwide on the same day, because

23:20.160 --> 23:24.680
if that were the case in Japan, we'd be getting it in July, but, you know, I'm going with

23:24.680 --> 23:25.680
October.

23:25.680 --> 23:31.420
Alright, let's go into the chat room and see if there is any thoughts there on the October

23:31.420 --> 23:32.420
18th date.

23:32.420 --> 23:37.780
Let's see, Blaze says, well here's what I think, October 18th would be the day to release

23:37.780 --> 23:40.580
all the NES launch games on the Virtual Console.

23:40.580 --> 23:45.740
Yeah, that makes sense, you know, kind of the anniversary, but why not the actual console

23:45.740 --> 23:46.740
itself the same day?

23:46.740 --> 23:52.900
I think most of us were banking on November as it was, and we kind of thought, hmm, Nintendo,

23:52.900 --> 23:58.580
disruption, wouldn't they want to get their system out there in kind of a unique timeframe?

23:58.580 --> 24:00.620
All the pieces fit together with this date for me.

24:00.620 --> 24:04.500
And although, yeah, it's not solid, it's not an official confirmation, we are going

24:04.500 --> 24:10.980
off a little bit of shaky evidence, maybe, because the dates do shift around, it just

24:10.980 --> 24:11.980
makes sense.

24:11.980 --> 24:16.460
Well, and also the fact that we have three different companies agreeing on a date, pretty

24:16.460 --> 24:22.820
much, or at least a launch week window, because usually it's about two or three weeks.

24:22.820 --> 24:27.740
I'm going to have to definitely say that it's looking that way, and you know what?

24:27.740 --> 24:30.980
Next week when we get more information on games coming out and stuff, and we have more

24:30.980 --> 24:34.100
titles in our system, it's just going to be even more information.

24:34.100 --> 24:39.300
I think we'll find out pretty soon when the official date's going to be, but I wouldn't

24:39.300 --> 24:41.980
be too surprised if it's October 18th.

24:41.980 --> 24:42.980
So here's my other question.

24:42.980 --> 24:46.820
Why do you think Nintendo's sitting on this date now?

24:46.820 --> 24:50.060
If they kind of know, and they've told their third-party publishers what day they're planning

24:50.060 --> 24:53.980
on launching their system, what are they waiting for to tell the rest of us? What event do

24:53.980 --> 24:56.300
you think they're going to finally announce all this?

24:56.300 --> 25:01.100
Well, I think they're waiting for maybe to see, because I guess the PlayStation 3, they

25:01.100 --> 25:07.980
could maybe try to get, maybe, you know, if they announce that they're going to be launching,

25:07.980 --> 25:14.500
you know, in November or something, and then kind of a false sense of security for Sony

25:14.500 --> 25:18.300
or something like that, and then, you know, that way, you know, two months in advance

25:18.300 --> 25:21.800
I'll get the jump on them. Yeah, I make sense. Ha bitch. We're launching

25:22.980 --> 25:24.980
Disruption. Yeah, so I don't know. Oh

25:25.540 --> 25:27.540
All right. I like that

25:28.260 --> 25:32.660
All right. We'll see what happens guys October 18th. That's what we're betting on for right now. So

25:33.460 --> 25:37.300
More official news to follow as soon as we hear it

25:38.580 --> 25:42.740
Moving on to other news now. We've got the release date. What about the price?

25:42.740 --> 25:47.680
Well, rumor is flying around from Sweden of all places.

25:47.680 --> 25:56.940
The Daily News in Sweden is saying that the WE console will be between 2500 and 3000 kronor.

25:56.940 --> 26:06.320
So if you translate that into US dollars, that's 340 US dollars, but keep in mind in

26:06.320 --> 26:11.800
Europe they tend to get screwed on the prices of the console, sorry guys, but probably the

26:11.800 --> 26:17.600
the Wii would then be in the $250-$300 dollar ballpark, which is a little higher than the

26:17.600 --> 26:19.440
$199 we're all assuming.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.440
Thoughts?

26:20.440 --> 26:24.000
I think it's in the $199, all their other systems have launched for $199 as far as my

26:24.000 --> 26:25.880
memory serves me.

26:25.880 --> 26:26.880
So why not?

26:26.880 --> 26:31.760
And if they're going to do the anniversary of the NES launch, why not do the price?

26:31.760 --> 26:32.760
Exactly.

26:32.760 --> 26:36.400
You know, I think a lot of us are sold on the $199, I think it's kind of the price that

26:36.400 --> 26:38.560
Nintendo's expected to meet.

26:38.560 --> 26:42.560
I'm agreeing more with the 250 price point.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.560
Well, why is that?

26:44.560 --> 26:53.560
Just because, I mean, it's still competitive without being, you know, I would say prohibitively,

26:53.560 --> 27:01.560
you know, it's not going to, they can still make their money on it, and yet still have it be generally affordable for most people.

27:01.560 --> 27:06.760
My thought was the reason why Nintendo didn't announce their price at E3 was

27:06.760 --> 27:09.120
because they were waiting to see what Sony did

27:09.120 --> 27:13.860
because Xbox 360 is out there for 300 bucks, their low-end console, right?

27:13.860 --> 27:18.120
And maybe they were waiting to see if Sony was gonna put it out for 300 as well,

27:18.120 --> 27:21.920
have some type of low-end for 300 as well. And if that had happened,

27:21.920 --> 27:26.880
250 or rather 249 would be cutting it a little close and I think in that case

27:26.880 --> 27:29.120
Nintendo would have definitely done the 199.

27:29.120 --> 27:32.880
but now that PlayStation 3 has really highballed it,

27:32.880 --> 27:37.840
maybe they can release it for $249 and it's still the cheap system.

27:37.840 --> 27:41.480
But I don't know, there's something about that $199 I still like.

27:41.480 --> 27:45.600
They might be waiting to see what Microsoft's going to do as far as

27:45.600 --> 27:49.320
dropping the price of their console to $290. That's true too, because

27:49.320 --> 27:52.280
Microsoft may have come out of that conference, they could have, hypothetically,

27:52.280 --> 27:55.280
come out of that conference and said we're cutting the price of our core system.

27:55.280 --> 27:58.840
And that would maybe was something Nintendo wanted to be prepared for. Here's

27:58.840 --> 28:03.820
Here's another thought though, you know, especially in this whole dual levels, you know, the core

28:03.820 --> 28:06.920
and the premium and then the PS3 little drive and big drive.

28:06.920 --> 28:10.160
This has been done before with the original NES.

28:10.160 --> 28:14.680
You had the regular NES, you actually had three levels, right, you had the regular NES,

28:14.680 --> 28:17.760
then you had the, I don't know, was it the action pack, the one that came with the light

28:17.760 --> 28:22.000
gun and the duck hunt in Mario Brothers, and then there was the, I don't remember what

28:22.000 --> 28:24.400
it was called, the robot pack or some other type of pack.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.200
The one with the gyromite.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.520
Right, and it had Rob the Robot as well.

28:28.520 --> 28:31.800
Wasn't there one also with the Power Pad in Duck Hunt?

28:31.800 --> 28:34.840
Years later, yes, you're right, the world-class track meet.

28:34.840 --> 28:40.960
So hypothetically, couldn't we possibly be launching 199, 249, maybe 199,

28:40.960 --> 28:41.480
I don't know,

28:41.480 --> 28:44.720
system controller, virtual console points only,

28:44.720 --> 28:49.320
and 249, all that plus Wii Sports?

28:49.320 --> 28:52.600
I think they want to simplify it and they're not going to try to do that because

28:52.600 --> 28:56.320
their market is for new gamers. They're not going to try to confuse them with

28:56.320 --> 29:01.960
two different price points and stuff and trying to get you to buy the more expensive system.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.640
I don't think they're going to do that.

29:03.640 --> 29:11.280
They haven't done that with any of their consoles, anything recent.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.320
I wouldn't see them doing that.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.320
Comments from the chat room.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.560
Lots of interesting thoughts on the price point here.

29:17.560 --> 29:21.500
Funny Dale says, one way or the other, the Wii will launch at $199.99.

29:21.500 --> 29:26.660
If they launch at $249, Microsoft will immediately drop the price of the 360 core system down

29:26.660 --> 29:28.220
to $229.

29:28.220 --> 29:31.860
I don't know if Microsoft can afford to drop it that low right now.

29:31.860 --> 29:32.860
Next year?

29:32.860 --> 29:33.860
Maybe.

29:33.860 --> 29:34.860
This year?

29:34.860 --> 29:35.860
I don't know.

29:35.860 --> 29:41.300
Microsoft still has the whole high definition thing to sell the consoles with, right?

29:41.300 --> 29:45.660
I don't think they need to drop their console price.

29:45.660 --> 29:50.060
They know they're not competing with Nintendo as far as next gen.

29:50.060 --> 29:53.740
on their own kind of game. There was that whole endorsement. Both companies,

29:53.740 --> 29:55.940
Microsoft and Sony, have practically said,

29:55.940 --> 29:59.580
sure, get a Nintendo as long as you don't buy

29:59.580 --> 30:03.700
Microsoft, Sony, whatever the competitor is. Sure, get a Wii.

30:03.700 --> 30:08.620
I think it's funny. Very interesting thought here. I agree with that too.

30:08.620 --> 30:13.740
Spiritsnare has a thought. Sky, the core console wasn't changed. Those were merely

30:13.740 --> 30:14.940
bundles.

30:14.940 --> 30:19.860
That's a good point, but, you know, and somebody else said, DMN said, you guys

30:19.860 --> 30:26.580
forget those were accessories, true, but the Wii has an assortment of accessories as well

30:26.580 --> 30:27.580
to play with, right?

30:27.580 --> 30:32.580
You have the classic controller, the light gun, so why not some of these things?

30:32.580 --> 30:39.860
But I think the point is that that's not really right to compare it to the way Xbox is doing

30:39.860 --> 30:43.620
their bundle and the way that Nintendo, because Nintendo is actually different stuff on the

30:43.620 --> 30:45.100
system itself.

30:45.100 --> 30:48.440
I can understand that. All I'm trying to say is could

30:48.440 --> 30:54.220
Nintendo launch two different Wii, one at $1.99 and one at $2.49 with different stuff?

30:54.220 --> 30:59.380
Yes, right? I honestly think that the way

30:59.380 --> 31:03.420
if they want to keep it at $1.99 what they need to do is have

31:03.420 --> 31:06.460
is to have a pack with

31:06.460 --> 31:10.060
this particular thing, a pack with this particular thing, a pack with this

31:10.060 --> 31:13.180
particular thing. You pick the one that you want to get based on the types of games you like

31:13.180 --> 31:17.980
and then you can get special deal with this thing

31:17.980 --> 31:21.340
for another X amount of money to get all the other accessories

31:21.340 --> 31:25.340
coming to a total of 250. And how Nintendo would this be? Release like a

31:25.340 --> 31:27.340
blue pack and a red pack and a

31:27.340 --> 31:30.780
I don't know, white pack or something? Well they have a white, black, and blue.

31:30.780 --> 31:34.780
I don't, yeah, with the different colors of Wii's, you know, I'm just pulling these colors

31:34.780 --> 31:37.820
on my butt because they could release Wii's in whatever color they want

31:37.820 --> 31:41.260
but you know, then with the red pack you get like a red Wii

31:41.260 --> 31:44.500
and maybe this game I don't know I mean I don't think it's gonna get that crazy

31:44.500 --> 31:46.620
because I don't think they're gonna complicate but that that's a good

31:46.620 --> 31:47.300
thought though

31:47.300 --> 31:51.140
that you know there's all different types of ways Nintendo could do this anyway

31:51.140 --> 31:56.700
we could hypothesize until the cows come home but we won't know anything for sure

31:56.700 --> 32:00.140
until Nintendo confirms which hopefully will be soon

32:00.140 --> 32:05.020
anyway moving on Loki what else is coming in with the Wii

32:05.020 --> 32:09.620
you're gonna get a web browser actually the opera web browser

32:09.620 --> 32:13.220
better, you know, you might remember that they released that originally for

32:13.220 --> 32:16.900
the Nintendo DS, now it's coming to the Wii, it's going to be one of the things that it

32:16.900 --> 32:18.300
launches with, which

32:18.300 --> 32:22.300
I think, you know, unless Sony does something, it's going to be the only console out

32:22.300 --> 32:23.860
there with a web browser built into it.

32:23.860 --> 32:27.500
I mean, since maybe the Dreamcast? Just in the interest of disclosure here, I think

32:27.500 --> 32:30.020
there's a story coming up later on tonight about the PS3

32:30.020 --> 32:33.980
interface has been shown and there was a web browser integrated in the PS3, so just, you know,

32:33.980 --> 32:36.980
And the Dreamcast web browser was not actually part of the system, it was a

32:36.980 --> 32:37.580
disk.

32:37.580 --> 32:40.660
true okay well whatever I mean

32:40.660 --> 32:44.900
oh goody the the PlayStation 3 web browser

32:44.900 --> 32:48.100
no you know what though I applaud this applause applause applause having the

32:48.100 --> 32:48.460
upper

32:48.460 --> 32:52.660
upper browser here because it shows you know I think well I was already really

32:52.660 --> 32:56.580
sold on this but it definitely shows Nintendo is embracing online

32:56.580 --> 33:00.020
good job Nintendo thank you not quite okay oh

33:00.020 --> 33:02.940
alright they're not really embracing online because

33:02.940 --> 33:07.460
Metroid Prime 3 not online multi

33:07.460 --> 33:11.120
player. There's a lot of their...

33:11.120 --> 33:15.460
sort of getting it, but not quite 100% yet.

33:15.460 --> 33:19.060
I think they just... I think Nintendo has a

33:19.060 --> 33:22.940
interesting enough thing going on with the whole, you know, controller aspect

33:22.940 --> 33:23.260
that

33:23.260 --> 33:27.220
the Metroid doesn't need to be multiplayer yet. Why do that when

33:27.220 --> 33:29.260
Metroid 4 can be online multiplayer?

33:29.260 --> 33:32.260
Halo, the original, wasn't multiplayer, but then again,

33:32.260 --> 33:36.220
okay, Xbox Live wasn't quite what it was at that point. You could, though, land it.

33:36.220 --> 33:42.300
We've done the four Xbox hook-up LAN parties on Halo.

33:42.300 --> 33:47.060
And it doesn't mean that they couldn't, yeah, and it doesn't mean that you couldn't

33:47.060 --> 33:52.220
maybe later on, you know, upgrade it or add a, you know, an update that had more...

33:52.220 --> 33:57.100
Yeah, the Metroid Prime 3 corruption, you know, special edition with online multiplayer.

33:57.100 --> 34:02.520
Or just, you know, that, what was it, the Nintendo Connect 24 or whatever, where they

34:02.520 --> 34:05.660
can update, you know, do an update on the game.

34:05.660 --> 34:11.620
Ion671 says, so you can pay $500 to surf the web on the PS3?

34:11.620 --> 34:16.420
Well, yeah, but here's the thing though, Xbox 360, this is one thing they're kind of lacking

34:16.420 --> 34:20.260
right now, which is surprising, seeing as Microsoft had the Web TV thing a while back,

34:20.260 --> 34:21.260
right?

34:21.260 --> 34:24.300
I'm kind of surprised that 360 doesn't have a web browser yet.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.500
It's a little surprising.

34:25.500 --> 34:28.540
I mean, it's not the end of the world.

34:28.540 --> 34:33.100
I can surf the web on my computer, yeah, and maybe this is what Microsoft realizes, is

34:33.100 --> 34:36.620
that why put a web browser in here because you know most people surf the

34:36.620 --> 34:40.220
web on their computers but I think it's kind of a neat feature there's something

34:40.220 --> 34:44.780
kind of neat about having a website right there on the television and think

34:44.780 --> 34:48.740
about some of those games that have websites accessible from within the game

34:48.740 --> 34:52.820
like I know this is a real weak example but fantasy star on the GameCube you

34:52.820 --> 34:55.600
kind of went on the fantasy star website and you can actually like read the

34:55.600 --> 34:59.700
forums and stuff from the GameCube so I don't know I know it's kind of a weak

34:59.700 --> 35:04.380
example but you could supplement games with websites right on the TV right yeah

35:04.380 --> 35:12.060
and that'd be cool to text entry on those websites via the DS maybe didn't

35:12.060 --> 35:14.460
the Opera browser on the DS and that's supposed to have handwriting recognition

35:14.460 --> 35:20.420
I remember seeing that yeah I don't know but yeah so it'd be pretty good

35:20.420 --> 35:25.500
spirits Nara says sky but web TV sucked okay true but the technology is there

35:25.500 --> 35:29.900
funnydale says so what microsoft can offer a web browser free on xbox live

35:29.900 --> 35:30.540
next week

35:30.540 --> 35:34.340
true but they haven't yet they can but they haven't

35:34.340 --> 35:40.700
tigerclaws says very true sky many websites have flash games

35:40.700 --> 35:44.140
so why not play the flash games on the TV well maybe Microsoft doesn't want

35:44.140 --> 35:45.340
that because then they wouldn't

35:45.340 --> 35:49.260
be able to sell bejeweled I don't know I don't know lots of theories here guys

35:49.260 --> 35:52.340
will open up the skype line later guys so you guys can give your thoughts but

35:52.340 --> 35:52.940
for now

35:52.940 --> 35:57.220
We want to get into some other things, and this next story, this is something I think

35:57.220 --> 36:01.880
a lot of people overlooked from the madness of E3, but while E3 is going on and all the

36:01.880 --> 36:06.180
gamers' attention is over there, things might be going on in the real world that affect

36:06.180 --> 36:07.180
us, right, DarkSakura?

36:07.180 --> 36:14.700
Yeah, there was a unanimous, a unanimous, blah, blah, blah, okay, in Louisiana the house

36:14.700 --> 36:21.400
unanimously passed, basically it was HB1381 on Tuesday.

36:21.400 --> 36:29.200
It was a bill that applies the Miller obscenity test to video games, sort of like the whole

36:29.200 --> 36:33.080
games as porn, you know, tactic that's been going on.

36:33.080 --> 36:38.480
I got some information from Game Politics on this one, actually a few interesting quotes.

36:38.480 --> 36:42.180
There's a lot of people who are just really pissed off over this, I think it's just as

36:42.180 --> 36:44.880
stupid as I do, probably.

36:44.880 --> 36:50.600
One of the editors for the Daily Comet stated, and I quote, why does the government feel

36:50.600 --> 36:51.600
the need to parent children.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.600
Amen!

36:52.600 --> 36:53.600
Thank you!

36:53.600 --> 36:54.600
Sorry.

36:54.600 --> 36:58.000
Few will be persuaded that violent video games or movies have a negative effect on children.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
It's only a game.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
It's only a movie.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.440
People are smart enough to distinguish the difference, some believe.

37:02.440 --> 37:08.080
As for me, I believe I can give better guidance to my children than Baton Rouge or Washington.

37:08.080 --> 37:12.840
But there's another funny one on here, though, that, uh, it made me laugh.

37:12.840 --> 37:18.120
It was actually by the editor of the, uh, home I care, uh, courier, says, I could watch

37:18.120 --> 37:21.260
I watch football from now until the cows come home, but I wouldn't be able to throw Brett

37:21.260 --> 37:23.760
I guess his favorite, F-A-V-R-E.

37:23.760 --> 37:27.520
I don't watch football, so I don't really care.

37:27.520 --> 37:30.560
And I could play Grand Theft Auto for the next 12 years, I don't think I would be looking

37:30.560 --> 37:33.240
for policemen to murder or prostitutes to pimp.

37:33.240 --> 37:38.360
That's because, and let me phrase this correctly so that even the Solons in Baton Rouge can

37:38.360 --> 37:42.280
comprehend the message, it's just a game.

37:42.280 --> 37:46.280
I'm actually reading the text of the bill here, which you can access on Game Politics

37:46.280 --> 37:47.280
website.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.560
just kind of reading what they want to add into the law here. Let's see.

37:49.560 --> 37:53.840
Prohibited sales of video or computer games to minors. A. An interactive video

37:53.840 --> 37:58.200
or computer game should not be sold, leased, or rented to a minor if the

37:58.200 --> 38:02.200
trier of facts determines all the followings. 1. The average person applying

38:02.200 --> 38:05.760
contemporary community standards would find that the video or computer game

38:05.760 --> 38:11.200
taken as a whole appeals to the minor's morbid interest in violence. Vague. 2. The

38:11.200 --> 38:14.260
game depicts violence in a manner patently offensive to prevailing

38:14.260 --> 38:17.080
standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable for minors.

38:17.080 --> 38:23.080
The game, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.

38:23.080 --> 38:25.080
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

38:25.080 --> 38:28.080
It's just another...

38:28.080 --> 38:30.080
It's basically...

38:30.080 --> 38:33.080
It's another just attempt of the government trying to control children.

38:33.080 --> 38:39.080
I mean, basically trying to have control over how children are raised trying to do the parent's job for them

38:39.080 --> 38:44.080
so they grow up to be nice little, you know, mindless sheep for them to have them later in the future.

38:44.080 --> 38:47.480
later in the future. Who's going to determine that? The game lacks serious

38:47.480 --> 38:51.600
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors?

38:51.600 --> 38:55.120
They've got established standards. See, they're trying

38:55.120 --> 38:59.840
to apply something that is not applicable for a game.

38:59.840 --> 39:04.640
I mean, but you can even really apply this to

39:04.640 --> 39:08.960
movies or even books.

39:08.960 --> 39:13.760
I mean, who's to judge whether this is of literary or artistic

39:13.760 --> 39:19.620
artistic value. How can you judge art? Art is not meant to be judged. Art is meant to

39:19.620 --> 39:26.620
be interpreted. Well, apparently that's their interpretation of it. Well, it stinks. Yeah.

39:26.620 --> 39:35.140
Well, then again, you know, with the, there was, remember the whole outcry they were having

39:35.140 --> 39:43.340
with the tour of the statue of David going around? Because it's nude. It's art! You know,

39:43.340 --> 39:46.840
That was actually a big deal when I was in Alabama.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.320
I don't get that.

39:48.320 --> 39:49.440
It's a penis.

39:49.440 --> 39:54.400
Half of America has already seen one at least, and the other half probably did see one already.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.400
Have one.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.680
No, that's what I meant.

39:56.680 --> 40:00.960
They've seen their own or they've probably seen one one way or another.

40:00.960 --> 40:04.760
What's the big deal?

40:04.760 --> 40:06.680
I sort of put that in the same category.

40:06.680 --> 40:14.080
the whole you know close-minded censure of things that you know their version of

40:14.080 --> 40:17.360
inappropriateness but I really I really really think that there is an ulterior

40:17.360 --> 40:22.520
motive to all this I think that I honestly with as much as we're seeing

40:22.520 --> 40:26.840
this coming especially in Republicans don't you know get all upset with me or

40:26.840 --> 40:30.920
anything coming out of the Republican camp and coming out of the Democrats too

40:30.920 --> 40:35.800
because you know we've got Hillary's spearhead and all this bullcrap you know

40:35.800 --> 40:43.960
We've got our two major political camps pushing the same type of agenda, especially

40:43.960 --> 40:49.720
since we're coming up to election year in 2008, and doesn't usually start about two

40:49.720 --> 40:50.720
years right beforehand.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.360
Just expect things to get worse, kids.

40:52.360 --> 40:57.920
We're getting the immigration deal now, we're getting the video game deal really bad now.

40:57.920 --> 41:04.200
I honestly think there's more behind this than just protecting our youth, who I think

41:04.200 --> 41:06.600
that it's a definite, uh, political agenda.

41:06.600 --> 41:10.840
Right. Our chat room is just lighting up, like line after line after line on this here

41:10.840 --> 41:13.160
right now. I've never seen the chat room scroll so fast.

41:13.160 --> 41:16.080
Um, BlackWolf makes the smartass comment,

41:16.080 --> 41:21.000
Africa has artistic value. The PlayStation 3 title that made

41:21.000 --> 41:25.160
most of us go, what the f is this? Uh, let's see.

41:25.160 --> 41:29.480
SpiritSnare says, Artistic, you need to play fucking Mario Paint.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.360
Okay, very interesting there.

41:32.360 --> 41:36.820
Funnydale says to all of the gamers who say that if we just ignore Jack Thompson, he will

41:36.820 --> 41:38.040
then go away.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.920
This proves this is not true.

41:40.920 --> 41:41.920
Interesting thought.

41:41.920 --> 41:42.920
Very interesting.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.840
Yeah, he was also a chief witness of that.

41:45.840 --> 41:46.840
Did you notice that?

41:46.840 --> 41:47.840
No, I didn't.

41:47.840 --> 41:52.600
Yeah, it's a comment here and I'm going to do another quote, it's from the Shreveport

41:52.600 --> 41:53.600
Times.

41:53.600 --> 41:59.200
It says, the fact that Jack Thompson was testifying in favor of the bill should immediately set

41:59.200 --> 42:06.300
off alarms, Thompson evokes no one so strongly as Fredric Wordham, a psychologist whose 1950s

42:06.300 --> 42:09.340
book Seduction of the Innocent led to the congressional hearings on the dangers of comic

42:09.340 --> 42:10.340
books.

42:10.340 --> 42:15.780
More comments from the chat room here, GS191, I'm tired of game politics, the politicians

42:15.780 --> 42:20.520
will never get video games, I say let them pass their stupid laws, it's going to be us

42:20.520 --> 42:24.060
that's going to gain control and take out the laws in the long run.

42:24.060 --> 42:26.220
Not if they are successful.

42:26.220 --> 42:30.020
You know what, here's my thought guys, if this makes you mad, don't write us a letter,

42:30.020 --> 42:33.340
well I mean of course we want your feedback, go ahead and write us a letter, but you need

42:33.340 --> 42:38.660
to be writing your congressman a letter, especially if you're over the age of 18, and here, I'm

42:38.660 --> 42:40.380
I'm going to start your letter for you.

42:40.380 --> 42:45.100
Dear Congressman, I am a registered voter.

42:45.100 --> 42:48.900
Then go ahead and express yourself cleanly, please.

42:48.900 --> 42:54.220
It's just for all the people who say, though, that, you know, we are, you know, we're going

42:54.220 --> 42:55.220
to be in power.

42:55.220 --> 42:59.660
Well, you know what I'm saying, that the younger generation is going to be the one to overthrow

42:59.660 --> 43:00.660
that.

43:00.660 --> 43:03.420
The thing is, is that imagine what's going to happen if they're successful in censoring

43:03.420 --> 43:04.780
what that generation sees.

43:04.780 --> 43:09.580
Isn't that what everyone said in the 60s?

43:09.580 --> 43:10.580
Maybe.

43:10.580 --> 43:12.580
I wasn't alive in the 60s.

43:12.580 --> 43:16.200
I know, but I'm just saying, you kind of look back on that whole hippie movement and everything

43:16.200 --> 43:17.700
and I have a feeling they were saying the same thing.

43:17.700 --> 43:20.700
There was a lot more to it than that necessarily, the hippie movement.

43:20.700 --> 43:23.700
That was around a whole war and...

43:23.700 --> 43:26.460
Okay, so I'm making a very broad visualization, however...

43:26.460 --> 43:28.460
And people are fucking like bunnies.

43:28.460 --> 43:29.460
Sorry.

43:29.460 --> 43:34.420
But, serious, I honestly do think that that's their agenda.

43:34.420 --> 43:39.500
From what it's looking like, this is just my own little conspiracy theory here, I think

43:39.500 --> 43:45.300
that, you know, honestly, I think that they're afraid of having an open-minded youth, about

43:45.300 --> 43:50.300
having people there who's going to question, instead of just blindly follow their lead.

43:50.300 --> 43:53.480
They lose power if you don't blindly follow.

43:53.480 --> 43:56.480
Some folks in the chat room are saying that they're too young, so they'll just write us

43:56.480 --> 43:57.480
a letter.

43:57.480 --> 44:00.180
Okay, that's fine, but here's a better thought.

44:00.180 --> 44:03.620
If you're too young, talk to somebody who is a registered voter.

44:03.620 --> 44:05.700
You can still have an impact.

44:05.700 --> 44:07.500
You can still have an impact.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.920
I say talk to your parents about it.

44:09.920 --> 44:13.500
I think it would be great to talk to your parents about what your thoughts on that.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.580
You can still write your congressman.

44:15.580 --> 44:16.580
That's true.

44:16.580 --> 44:17.580
You can still do it.

44:17.580 --> 44:20.980
You can say, hey, I am X years old and by this election I will be registered to vote.

44:20.980 --> 44:21.980
That's very true.

44:21.980 --> 44:23.340
I imagine most of you guys that listen to this show.

44:23.340 --> 44:24.340
Lock the vote.

44:24.340 --> 44:25.340
Remember that?

44:25.340 --> 44:26.340
Huh?

44:26.340 --> 44:29.340
Trying to get people who were just turning 18, who were kids to...

44:29.340 --> 44:30.860
Vote or P. Diddy will kill you?

44:30.860 --> 44:33.180
Well, you know what I mean, though.

44:33.180 --> 44:37.860
was the same thing you know you can still write in you can still get your

44:37.860 --> 44:41.140
voice out there all right I'm gonna end on this note because Roz I think just

44:41.140 --> 44:45.180
won the chat room here we got to keep it moving but Roz says dear Jack Thompson

44:45.180 --> 44:50.020
you are a giant enemy crab I hit you in your weak spot for massive damage PS

44:50.020 --> 45:01.700
Ridge Racer Roz I love you moving on to another story Loki yes hackin and crackin

45:01.700 --> 45:05.340
On the XB360, what happened?

45:05.340 --> 45:10.260
Well they have accomplished what they needed to do.

45:10.260 --> 45:17.700
They actually were able to, as I think a while back there was a video of them hacking the

45:17.700 --> 45:25.140
360 to play backups of disks and now they were successful on some of the 360s.

45:25.140 --> 45:30.300
Because the 360 comes with either one of two optical drives, either a Toshiba, Samsung

45:30.300 --> 45:37.680
drive or Hitachi drive. And if you have the Toshiba Samsung drive, well guess what? You

45:37.680 --> 45:44.320
can actually mod your firmware on the actual optical disk drive and be able to play backups.

45:44.320 --> 45:49.560
And basically what it does is it kind of works the same way that they did with the Xbox One

45:49.560 --> 45:55.600
firmware and their disk drives. It patches the response to the media check into the disk

45:55.600 --> 45:59.720
drive. So basically when you pop in a game, it will check, okay is this a burnt disk,

45:59.720 --> 46:03.640
Is this a Prestus from Microsoft?

46:03.640 --> 46:04.860
Is this a CD?

46:04.860 --> 46:07.280
What type of media am I reading?

46:07.280 --> 46:12.360
And usually if you have a DVD Plus R or something like that, it's not going to play it if it's

46:12.360 --> 46:13.360
a game.

46:13.360 --> 46:17.560
So what this does is no matter what the hell you put into it, it replies back to the system

46:17.560 --> 46:19.720
saying, yep, we're good, play the game.

46:19.720 --> 46:27.720
So yeah, right now they're working on a way to be able to get to work on the Hitachi drives.

46:27.720 --> 46:32.300
However, there's groups like Team Executor, they're releasing a device that you can actually

46:32.300 --> 46:38.140
hook this up to your PC, which is what you'd have to do to flash the firmware on it.

46:38.140 --> 46:43.340
And soon enough, you know, they're going to be able to bust this thing wide open like

46:43.340 --> 46:45.660
the original Xbox.

46:45.660 --> 46:49.300
So that's not a good thing, I'm sure, for Microsoft.

46:49.300 --> 46:50.820
Dark Soccer, what do you think?

46:50.820 --> 46:52.300
Microsoft going to be happy about this?

46:52.300 --> 46:58.220
Well, basically they've issued an official statement to warn the 360 owners about messing

46:58.220 --> 47:01.300
with their system, pretty much.

47:01.300 --> 47:05.540
Basically they're saying the core security system has not been broken, however, on some

47:05.540 --> 47:10.180
Xbox 360 consoles, the authentication protocol between the optical disk drive and the console

47:10.180 --> 47:17.940
may be attacked via complex software and hardware modification, which could allow people to

47:17.940 --> 47:20.340
play illegally copied and modified games.

47:20.340 --> 47:26.180
So, pretty much what they're talking about is, yeah, you do that, you void your warranty.

47:26.180 --> 47:27.980
Isn't that the classic response deal?

47:27.980 --> 47:28.980
Don't void your warranty!

47:28.980 --> 47:31.900
Well, here's another thing too that they're working on right now, is they're actually

47:31.900 --> 47:35.900
having multiple BIOSes on the actual DVD drive.

47:35.900 --> 47:38.540
So basically, the flip of the switch, I want to play it on live.

47:38.540 --> 47:42.920
Flip the switch over, it runs off the original thing, you can't play the copy thing, but

47:42.920 --> 47:46.860
you can, you know, and it might not even be able to detect, you might be able to break

47:46.860 --> 47:52.980
that so it can't detect what your firmware is on the actual drive. So, I don't know.

47:52.980 --> 47:57.140
I think that they're going to be smart enough to do it. I mean, after all, hell, we have

47:57.140 --> 48:00.620
Xboxes out there that are running games off the hard drive and have Linux on them. So,

48:00.620 --> 48:03.420
I mean, it's not like it's impossible.

48:03.420 --> 48:07.340
That would be interesting if it could happen because GK128 has a very interesting condensed

48:07.340 --> 48:11.580
version of the Microsoft disclaimer there. He says, mess with your 360, say goodbye to

48:11.580 --> 48:20.620
alive bitch and DMN says dear 360 owners don't fuck with your firmware PS Ridge

48:20.620 --> 48:25.380
racer oh we're full of comedians tonight in orange knowledge radio chat that's

48:25.380 --> 48:30.660
gonna become our new cake or death I don't know it's it's the new insight or

48:30.660 --> 48:33.980
not really inside joke but you know line of the week that's gonna just get beat

48:33.980 --> 48:39.940
into the ground until you're all sick of it if you're not already all right let's

48:39.940 --> 48:44.460
Let's see, let's go ahead and move on here to another story, and that would be me talking

48:44.460 --> 48:47.540
about the PlayStation 3, which we haven't talked a whole lot about tonight, but we want

48:47.540 --> 48:52.060
to talk about all the next-gen systems.

48:52.060 --> 48:55.620
PlayStation 3 pre-orders at GameStop and EB Games.

48:55.620 --> 49:00.540
It ain't happening until early October for the PlayStation 3.

49:00.540 --> 49:05.020
Rumor is, I guess, what they're trying to do is go, or try to avoid what happened with

49:05.020 --> 49:09.660
Xbox 360, where they were taking pre-orders for a long time, and it was too many pre-orders

49:09.660 --> 49:13.700
to fill, essentially, they didn't get enough systems, and when they couldn't deliver

49:13.700 --> 49:17.700
people's systems until February or March, who got the flack for that?

49:17.700 --> 49:18.700
Microsoft?

49:18.700 --> 49:19.700
No.

49:19.700 --> 49:23.240
GameStop and EB Games did, because why aren't you getting enough consoles?

49:23.240 --> 49:27.960
People maybe didn't really know where to place the blame, so GameStop and EB are thinking

49:27.960 --> 49:33.160
this time, okay, if we only open it up for a certain window, then folks, we won't have

49:33.160 --> 49:35.540
such a huge list, but I don't know.

49:35.540 --> 49:38.900
If people find out the day that GameStop's going to start taking orders, people are going

49:38.900 --> 49:40.620
be lined up that morning

49:40.620 --> 49:43.980
i think you know the sony fanboys anyway you know say what you want about whether

49:43.980 --> 49:46.020
you're gonna get or not get a playstation three but

49:46.020 --> 49:49.180
there are rabid launch fans there's enough of them where you know they'll be

49:49.180 --> 49:50.380
a line going out the door

49:50.380 --> 49:54.020
the day they start taking pre-orders so i think this will help that situation a

49:54.020 --> 49:56.140
little bit

49:56.140 --> 49:59.340
it's not gonna if sony can't produce the systems is gonna be the same thing all

49:59.340 --> 50:00.220
over again

50:00.220 --> 50:06.180
also third launch windows like the launch game suck you know you never know

50:06.180 --> 50:10.420
Well, anyways, we'll get to that later.

50:10.420 --> 50:15.700
Moving right along, Dark Sakura likes to kind of look around at different websites, including

50:15.700 --> 50:19.620
those overseas, and UK reaction to the price?

50:19.620 --> 50:29.620
Well, there's actually been an official price released for the UK in particular.

50:29.620 --> 50:33.940
Basically they're releasing it for £425 for the 60 gig model, but there's not any type

50:33.940 --> 50:37.820
of word if they're getting the 20 gigabyte model.

50:37.820 --> 50:41.820
Of course, what's the point, since it has no HDMI, no Wi-Fi.

50:41.820 --> 50:46.700
Yeah, unless you don't plan on having an HDTV in the next few years, I don't know.

50:46.700 --> 50:51.940
This is funny, though, because in Euros, it's 599 Euros for the 60 gigabyte, which goes

50:51.940 --> 51:00.060
to 405 pounds, so actually, they're not getting it for that good of a deal.

51:00.060 --> 51:05.480
It's off a little bit, but still going to be a little bit more expensive than the general price in euros

51:06.060 --> 51:07.020
and

51:07.020 --> 51:11.100
They're really trying to push the blu-ray thing the they're a mark

51:11.500 --> 51:17.060
Managing director for Sony UK Ray McGuire is basically going around saying Oh blu-ray

51:17.300 --> 51:22.940
You know blu-ray player is 600 to 700 pounds. You know you're getting a big deal blu-ray blu-ray blu-ray

51:22.940 --> 51:28.220
Yeah, where was the blu-ray movie on the e3 show floor? I'm wondering that myself and

51:28.220 --> 51:31.300
and you know on top of that you know

51:31.300 --> 51:34.700
there he's

51:34.700 --> 51:38.500
I think there's a lot of negative reaction to it just from the

51:38.500 --> 51:41.540
the nature of his statement because he

51:41.540 --> 51:45.100
to quote he says the point is that most people don't realize

51:45.100 --> 51:48.300
what they're actually getting with the PlayStation 3 like

51:48.300 --> 51:52.260
no they're getting something that's not going to be what you're trying to make

51:52.260 --> 51:52.980
it out to be

51:52.980 --> 51:57.780
so and really it's still it's still gonna be more expensive there than it is

51:57.780 --> 51:58.180
here

51:58.180 --> 52:02.580
Very interesting comment in our chat room from FunnyDale.

52:02.580 --> 52:07.020
Oh, quick griping about the price of the PlayStation 3. People pay $500 for a

52:07.020 --> 52:09.980
fuckin' iPod. They pay $500 for a damn video card.

52:09.980 --> 52:14.700
They will pay 600 bucks for a PlayStation 3. I say yeah,

52:14.700 --> 52:18.420
there are gonna be people that will pay the 600 bucks for a PlayStation 3.

52:18.420 --> 52:22.940
I will. These are the same retards that bought DVHS also.

52:22.940 --> 52:26.940
No, just because I have to have every system, I will pay 600 bucks for the

52:26.940 --> 52:30.880
PlayStation 3 I'm not gonna be happy about but I will do it but the thing is

52:30.880 --> 52:35.580
the iPod if you know you want to make that comparison didn't really achieve

52:35.580 --> 52:40.120
huge amounts of success until they released cheaper models that still got

52:40.120 --> 52:44.040
the job done you know what I mean? I never bought an iPod. Well you did the

52:44.040 --> 52:48.240
free iPod thing right? I got a free iPod. Well I'm sure they'll do a free PS3 if you want to go

52:48.240 --> 52:52.920
that route. They're already out there. That's a controversial thing but

52:52.920 --> 52:57.920
whatever do it if that's what makes you makes it work for you then go for it but

52:57.920 --> 53:04.960
I like Bobby's comment oh Bobby Bobby going for the jugular there Loki paid

53:04.960 --> 53:12.680
$600 for an Xbox 360 didn't he? actually that was $700 for a 360 so why all the PS3 hate?

53:12.680 --> 53:16.720
because you think you're gonna be paying $300 more if you end up going eBay or

53:16.720 --> 53:20.960
what? no I just I don't there's not really any games for me that I want to

53:20.960 --> 53:24.800
get right at launch. Are you not gonna get it at launch? I might not. I have to see what their

53:24.800 --> 53:25.880
launch games are gonna be

53:25.880 --> 53:29.620
and that's really gonna determine it for me because it's all about the games and you

53:29.620 --> 53:31.480
know what if they don't have that many

53:31.480 --> 53:34.680
good games at launch or if it's not what I like I'll wait.

53:34.680 --> 53:39.640
Right now I'm about an eighty percent yes on it because I I know I can

53:39.640 --> 53:42.920
benefit from the blu-ray being an HDTV owner and all that stuff but

53:42.920 --> 53:47.540
I'm and again a large part of why I'm saying this is because

53:47.540 --> 53:51.480
I have to have all the consoles I want them all but I realize

53:51.480 --> 53:55.700
everybody's not like that now and you know yeah the day that all the hype will start a

53:55.700 --> 53:56.820
month before and you'll be like

53:56.820 --> 54:00.860
Paris Hilton has one why can't I have one? I'm just kidding

54:00.860 --> 54:06.300
alright I mean it's just people are looking at like

54:06.300 --> 54:10.060
a game system you know they're not seeing the

54:10.060 --> 54:13.460
the long life that they might see in something else I don't know

54:13.460 --> 54:19.020
it's just still. Here's a comment from Ota G who I haven't read anything from

54:19.020 --> 54:21.460
tonight in our chat room. Orangelandtrady.com, click on chat.

54:21.460 --> 54:25.140
The price of the PlayStation 3 isn't the problem. The fact that Sony hasn't

54:25.140 --> 54:26.660
justified it is.

54:26.660 --> 54:32.820
Debate, debate going on in our chat room. Exactly, you know, I have my next-gen system. That's why I went and

54:32.820 --> 54:33.820
spent that money

54:33.820 --> 54:36.940
is because it was like one of the first next-gen systems out there,

54:36.940 --> 54:40.340
you know, and I learned my lesson. I learned that,

54:40.340 --> 54:44.020
you know maybe the launch game is not so good and so

54:44.020 --> 54:48.220
I will wait to see what games are out there and then I can buy it later

54:48.220 --> 54:51.420
and that's it.

54:51.420 --> 54:55.420
Let's change gears here let's go back and talk about

54:55.420 --> 54:57.980
some of the current stuff that's out there now this is something somebody

54:57.980 --> 54:59.740
called in about a couple weeks ago

54:59.740 --> 55:02.740
when we were live Mother 3 which you know

55:02.740 --> 55:06.020
Earthbound has a rabbit ass following behind it

55:06.020 --> 55:10.180
and for good reason Earthbound is a great game we'll get this Mother 3 is

55:10.180 --> 55:15.440
going to get an English translation, it is going to come out in Europe.

55:15.440 --> 55:19.360
So hooray for Europe, but if you're in the United States, you're still not happy because

55:19.360 --> 55:22.960
E3 went by and still no Mother 3 announcement for the U.S.

55:22.960 --> 55:23.960
Import the bitch.

55:23.960 --> 55:24.960
There's no lock-out guard.

55:24.960 --> 55:28.720
Yeah, there's no region differences on these.

55:28.720 --> 55:29.720
Just import it.

55:29.720 --> 55:31.720
Well, you're going to have to pay the higher price.

55:31.720 --> 55:32.720
Import!

55:32.720 --> 55:33.720
Amazon U.K.

55:33.720 --> 55:37.960
Well, just to make it clear, the official Nintendo magazine in the U.K. is saying that

55:37.960 --> 55:42.080
It will come out in December in Europe, and it's going to be released for the Game Boy

55:42.080 --> 55:46.440
Advance edition, I'm sorry, Game Boy Advance.

55:46.440 --> 55:47.920
So you're right, though.

55:47.920 --> 55:52.380
If you want to pay the extra bucks there or import it through UK, just pay the slightly

55:52.380 --> 55:54.980
higher shipping fees, at least you get your English translation.

55:54.980 --> 55:59.260
So maybe it's not all bad news, and I know a damn lot of people that will do it.

55:59.260 --> 56:03.760
So I think Nintendo of America is kind of, I mean, I guess all the money goes to Nintendo

56:03.760 --> 56:09.980
in the end, but I think Nintendo of America at least, at least if nothing else, print

56:09.980 --> 56:15.860
a low run and do what you did with the electroplankton, sell it on your website, or something.

56:15.860 --> 56:19.180
Just release it in stores and don't advertise for it.

56:19.180 --> 56:23.620
I just can't believe something like this won't come out here, especially when an English

56:23.620 --> 56:28.180
translation is now done, but frickin' Dr. Sudoku out there on store shelves.

56:28.180 --> 56:30.420
I don't get it.

56:30.420 --> 56:32.700
It baffles me.

56:32.700 --> 56:37.340
Cuz people are crazy. I'm surprised how much I won the KB games the other day

56:37.940 --> 56:40.260
just for the hell of it and I

56:40.860 --> 56:46.340
Couldn't believe how many Sudoku games are out there. Is it really that much of a popular thing right now? Cuz I

56:47.440 --> 56:52.260
Mean, I remember seeing Sudoku magazines and going wow. I have to do math. Fuck that, you know

56:52.260 --> 56:56.140
So I they used to have a different name. They weren't always called Sudoku here in America

56:56.140 --> 56:59.940
They used to print those in the penny press publications like crypto numbers or something like that

56:59.940 --> 57:02.980
it wasn't even... They're all over the place now.

57:02.980 --> 57:06.320
You know, now that I'm looking for them, I'm like, holy crap. Here's the honest

57:06.320 --> 57:08.340
justification for Dr. Sudoku

57:08.340 --> 57:13.180
on the Game Boy Advance or whatever is because Nintendo wants to go after

57:13.180 --> 57:18.380
everyone, not just gamers, and I've seen it in the workplace. I've seen

57:18.380 --> 57:22.300
people that are not your typical types of gamers, you know, mothers

57:22.300 --> 57:25.900
and, you know, folks that you don't typically think of as gamers

57:25.900 --> 57:29.460
bring in their Sudoku magazines and they'll play Sudoku on break.

57:29.460 --> 57:32.340
it's it's it is a really good exercise for the brain is that you know the whole

57:32.340 --> 57:33.180
brain training thing

57:33.180 --> 57:37.100
so I can see why this is justified in Nintendo's eyes but you know

57:37.100 --> 57:40.280
I'm just saying come on why give us

57:40.280 --> 57:43.420
why give us this out there and not mother three I don't get it I still I

57:43.420 --> 57:45.480
still think Nintendo's going to announce it later

57:45.480 --> 57:48.500
I think there's going to be another Nintendo press conference I mean there

57:48.500 --> 57:49.620
has to be because they're gonna

57:49.620 --> 57:52.840
announce all the Wii stuff and I think they're gonna drop some these bombshells

57:52.840 --> 57:53.260
too

57:53.260 --> 57:57.860
so I I still I I'm still hopeful mother threes coming to the US

57:57.860 --> 58:00.860
But, what do I know?

58:00.860 --> 58:02.860
I don't know, what do you know?

58:02.860 --> 58:05.860
Not much. I'm just some dude on the internet.

58:05.860 --> 58:07.860
Hey, I have some info.

58:07.860 --> 58:09.860
Alright, what do you know DarkSakura?

58:09.860 --> 58:10.860
I have release dates.

58:10.860 --> 58:12.860
Alright, you like to travel the globe?

58:12.860 --> 58:14.860
And so what's, uh, Europe?

58:14.860 --> 58:15.860
Yes.

58:15.860 --> 58:16.860
Alright, what's coming out in Europe?

58:16.860 --> 58:19.860
Well, these are the release dates for the 26th.

58:19.860 --> 58:21.860
That would be Friday.

58:21.860 --> 58:23.860
We have Chibi-Robo for the GameCube.

58:23.860 --> 58:25.860
We have Cossacks 2 Battle for Europe.

58:25.860 --> 58:31.340
Europe, Jill Dozer for the GBA, Hitman Blood Money for a whole bunch of stuff, Rockman

58:31.340 --> 58:37.620
oh, Rockman, I've got Rockman on the brain, Rockstar Games presents Table Tennis, yay,

58:37.620 --> 58:42.900
Rush for Berlin on PC, we have Super Princess Peach on the DS, bout damn time, it's the

58:42.900 --> 58:43.900
PMS game.

58:43.900 --> 58:47.660
Yeah, if you want to control an overly emotional woman, have fun with Super Princess Peach.

58:47.660 --> 58:52.100
Don't you know you can't ever do that?

58:52.100 --> 58:53.180
Of course you can't.

58:53.180 --> 58:57.660
Well thanks to the wonder of technology of video games, now you can.

58:57.660 --> 59:01.420
So you think. Heart, love ya.

59:01.420 --> 59:04.660
And since this is the only other one on here, I'll go ahead and say it. On the 31st talk,

59:04.660 --> 59:06.020
Man on PSP is coming out.

59:06.020 --> 59:09.380
Alright. How about the US, Loki? Sounds like kind of a,

59:09.380 --> 59:12.860
I have to be honest, kind of a slow week in Europe. I mean, a couple of the big

59:12.860 --> 59:15.660
names they're getting we've had here in the US for a little while, so okay.

59:15.660 --> 59:19.180
But what's US getting? One of the games I've been

59:19.180 --> 59:25.740
highly anticipating because this is it's incredibly fun but anyways um so what we're getting is

59:25.740 --> 59:33.260
a lot of crap actually but uh on the pc heroes of might and magic 5 great um a lot of people

59:33.260 --> 59:37.980
like my magic on the psp on the psp is quite a bit of stuff um field commander which is

59:37.980 --> 59:41.980
kind of like a you know turn-based strategy game remind me of a you know command and conquer

59:41.980 --> 59:47.580
a little bit um lemmings on the psp monster hunter freedom which is actually going to

59:47.580 --> 59:54.180
pretty good game on the PSP. Um, on the 360 Rockstar's Table Tennis. And on the current

59:54.180 --> 01:00:01.180
gen stuff, we've got, I believe, Fuel was coming out on the Xbox. And then of course

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:09.720
Rogue Trooper on Playstation 2 and Xbox. And then my favorite for the week, Jaws Unleashed.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.620
Where you get to play the shark and get to dismember divers. Finally! How long ago was

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.340
that game supposed to come out? A long time ago. I don't care how cheesy this game is

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:22.840
This is like Echo the Dolphin with rabies.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.360
It's like snakes on a plane.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.360
What's the big deal with that movie?

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.080
Because it's snakes on a freakin' plane.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:34.820
So you know Jaws the game, yeah it might suck, but it's Jaws, you get to be the shark.

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.340
You get to eat people.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.340
That's cool.

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.960
You get to destroy boats.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.320
It's Grand Theft Auto with fish.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.520
Shark addiction.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.940
No but anyways.

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.940
Shark is tasty.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:50.460
Steambot Chronicles is supposed to be coming out on PlayStation 2, which is eh.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:57.500
I mean, after all, they've got a mechs known as Bumpy Trots, which sounds like a real bad

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:01.900
ass disease or something like that, I don't know.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:05.660
We gotta keep it moving, because we've got a lot of stories and we're moving kind of

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:06.660
slow tonight.

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.660
That's alright.

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.780
Lots of stuff to say since post-E3 here.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.180
Loki, was there any other release dates?

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:13.180
I'm sorry.

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.180
Nope.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.180
Okay.

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:20.460
Um, a big name in the online community, Major Nelson, he's got his own little podcast over

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.460
there or I'm sorry, blogcast.

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.980
They don't use the word podcast, I'm not yourself.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:24.980
He's got a blogcast.

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.060
Uh, but what's he saying about the PlayStation 3?

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.900
He's saying that their online service is not going to be free.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:30.900
And how does he know this?

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:36.220
Well, he's basically going off the slides that they had on, um, during the press conference

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:42.860
and when they were mentioning free things, um, matchmaking and online play were not mentioned.

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:50.660
I think he says, so basically it's going to be an equivalent to Xbox Live's silver level

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.620
of service right now, so.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:58.140
You know, basically you get to talk to people, you know, and you do chat and stuff, but you

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:00.660
can't play games against them for free.

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:01.660
Interesting.

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.340
Which, you know, I don't know.

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:10.980
I get into the whole thing where I get kind of frustrated with Sony copying everybody

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:11.980
anyways.

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:15.820
play was free though it would certainly help justify the price because they

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.540
could say hey you're having to pay fifty dollars extra on xbox

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:21.240
xbox so in the heat we get it

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.120
he is right

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:25.020
when he says that you know that that stuff was mentioned free service free

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:29.360
service stuff video chat latest info friends list ranking account management

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.320
player profile voice messaging text messaging

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:37.380
uh... i don't see game play on there

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.900
uh... moving on another interesting story on the playstation three some

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:45.980
Some stealthy video at E3 was shot in, I guess, one of those demo rooms for the media only.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.380
I guess we weren't cool enough to get invited, but Joystiq was, or somebody that ratted to

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:55.340
Joystiq because they posted some videos on YouTube of the PlayStation 3 interface, and

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.340
guess what?

01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:01.660
It looks very similar to the PSP, which, when I first saw it, I was like, wow, that's kind

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:04.420
of surprising that it looks like that, and then at the same time, I'm like, actually,

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.420
it's really not.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:10.740
It should look like the PSP, kind of that branding element, but I'm like, on the TV,

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.700
going to look kind of boring. I don't know. I was expecting something a little more flashy,

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.700
but maybe I'm wrong.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:21.460
I guess that's true. Maybe simplicity is key. I guess it makes a lot of sense when you think

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:27.220
about it, but what's interesting is that it really does kind of borrow from the PSP. There's

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:31.260
a user's menu where I guess you can sign on as different users, a web browser, which we

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:36.020
brought up earlier, and apparently you're going to be able to do multi-Windows or tabs

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:39.660
or something like that in there as well, and also a friends list, and there will be voice

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:43.060
and video chatting and gaming if you wanted to do that as well

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:46.660
so you're very interested. If you want to check that out I'm sure you can find it on

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.300
YouTube very quickly or it's in Joysticks archives. Check it out.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:52.740
What do you guys think about the interface?

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:56.220
I think it's lazy like everything else that they do.

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:59.620
Really? You know, I

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:03.620
I was talking with my friends at work the other day and just basically ripping on

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:06.660
I'm a huge Sony fanboy. I have a PlayStation

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.940
You know, I had a PlayStation 2, I have two PSPs, I mean, so, you know, don't get me wrong,

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.020
I don't hate Sony.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.280
I just, I don't like how they steal everybody's ideas, though.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.980
It's like nothing is original for them, and then they try to come out and, like, deny

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:21.420
that they've ripped off these ideas.

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:25.260
I mean, look at, look at the PlayStation 1, for example, okay?

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:31.220
Came out, doesn't have analog, doesn't have rumble features, Nintendo 64 comes out, has

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:35.940
analog, has rumble, oh, look, look, now we have the DualShock!

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.940
I mean, come on!

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.940
It's retarded!

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:40.540
Okay, now they come out with their controller design.

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:43.580
Oh, by the way, uh, look, it now has tilt features in it.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:44.580
Oh, a Playstation 3.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.100
Oh, now ours has tilt features in it!

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.140
And now let's copy Xbox Live, but not quite.

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.980
They can copy, but they can never get it quite right.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.980
It's...

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:54.980
I don't know.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:55.980
Alright.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:00.380
I'd be interested to see how things, you know, work out for them.

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:04.180
I'm kind of wary on their online service because Playstation 2's online sucked.

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.780
yeah I'll be honest at least it was online

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.780
unlike mister GameCube who had one game

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.820
and where she GameCube paperweight

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:17.500
I'm moving I know I even when we wait a minute though I I there's issue 3

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.540
paperweight hope okay they say GameCube is a way man way man

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:25.460
no I so many nights at 4 a.m. Mario Party prove otherwise so anyway

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:30.060
alright okay fair enough that we agree alright let's change topics completely

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:33.140
because dark soccer hasn't gotten to give you a website at the weekend a

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.820
little while so she's got to do some catching up here and so here it is Dark

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:43.580
Sakura's website of the week for your surfing pleasure so I've decided this

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:47.500
site has got a lot of attention in the past that hasn't gotten a lot of

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:52.340
attention lately so I am talking about another thing other but weebles stuff

01:05:52.340 --> 01:06:01.460
w-e-e-b-l-s-stuff.com yes it's the home of badger badger badger and magical

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:10.380
Trevor and Kenya. The most recent one is Crabs, which I find incredibly hilarious. Do they

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:15.740
have weak points? Well, it's about a mouthful of crabs, and there's lots of bleeding in

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:25.940
it, which sort of makes me think of the whole YAY thing from Rejected. There's also the

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:32.260
home of Weeble and Bob, which are like two eggs, and they're speaking. And the last one

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:38.860
was pretty funny. So go check them out. And make sure that you look for the ninja one.

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:43.860
I don't know where it is, but the ninja one is somewhere on the site. So, yeah.

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:50.780
Alright. Do it now. Right now. Mouthful of crabs!

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:54.660
historically accurate nonetheless.

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:58.480
Moving on, those jokes will never get old, I'm sorry.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.480
Let's talk some movies.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.920
We've got a lot of movie and TV stuff, just a barrage of stuff.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.920
Loki, start us off.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.480
Okay, let's start off with a really bad idea.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.600
Bad idea, it's called, Jerry Brockhamer has just signed on to produce a movie called Game

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.600
Boys.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:18.080
No, it's not the true life story of the portable Nintendo system.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:25.880
It's a sci-fi action movie that's basically, the story revolves around two 30-year-old

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:31.080
video game junkies recruited by the Department of Homeland Security, which is a joke anyways,

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:36.160
to lead a geeky army of gamers in a battle against creatures that have come to life from

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.000
a video game they have mastered.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:45.220
Sounds like an episode of X-Files to me, because I think they cover that.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:49.780
What I'm really surprised is that Homeland Security does not have a contingency plan

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.660
for that type of scenario.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.220
Come on!

01:07:53.220 --> 01:08:00.280
Alright, going from a really bad idea to a really good idea, Metal Gear Solid movie was

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.620
confirmed at E3 in case you missed it.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:08.300
Konami had a great parody, they put out the show Maybe in response to the show daily,

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:12.420
but something you don't want to miss in there, the show Maybe says, in a late-breaking

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:16.900
surprise announcement, director Hideo Kojima revealed that his most famous creation, Metal

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:19.580
Gear Solid, is getting the live-action treatment.

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:23.540
He already said, hell no, to Uebo, so don't worry about that.

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:27.380
But he did say, I've received many offers to adapt to Metal Gear Solid.

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:31.100
It has taken a long time, but we have finally settled on an arrangement.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:34.860
False facts aside, a movie project is underway.

01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:38.340
I have finalized a Class A contract with a party in Hollywood.

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:39.860
But that's about all the details yet.

01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:44.020
No directors, no stars, no dates.

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:49.340
But you know, with Metal Gear Solid 4 coming out in 2007, most likely, maybe, you know,

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.340
something, something?

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.340
Nah, maybe not.

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.120
I guess the movie would have had to have already started to hit that kind of release date,

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:57.260
but maybe next Christmas, we'll see.

01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:59.260
But it is coming.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.380
Yeah, interesting.

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:04.260
Loki.

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:09.100
Yes, that's not the only movie that's coming.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:16.100
Paul Sams, the executive at Blizzard, has mentioned that a Warcraft movie is coming

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:25.100
and I don't know if I should be excited about this. No, I'm not, because I haven't really played that much Warcraft.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:31.100
Well, the most popular MMO in this country and movie makes sense to me.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:35.100
If they screw it up though, there's going to be tons of pissed off people.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:40.860
A lot of people play Dungeons and Dragons too, and look what they did to that movie.

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:45.700
Apparently the group that they're working with is called Legendary, and they want to

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:51.340
basically make this really big budget movie.

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:53.540
I've never heard of Legendary, ever.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.900
When I think of big blockbuster movies, I don't think, hmm, Legendary, no.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:01.020
So who the hell is Legendary?

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.020
I've never heard of them.

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:07.660
follow games not movies you know and I should really be following movies after

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:13.500
all I do work at a goddamn movie distributor good job so hopefully it

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:20.540
doesn't suck oh I guess it's gonna be Warner is working with them well now

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:25.360
they're now Warner I've heard of so there you have it yeah I think I have

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.740
heard a legendary come to think of it I think I've seen that little animation at

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:32.260
the beginning I don't know what I'm sure they've done good stuff I just you know

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:35.520
when you think about movies you think DreamWorks you don't think of the small

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:40.200
company that put it out you know so just you know but it's not like big movie

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:46.300
studios haven't put out stinkers before so exactly all right this isn't quite a

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:51.520
movie but Dark Sakura an interesting idea nonetheless they're planning on

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:58.160
doing a Animal Crossing or as it is in Japan double tsunami animated movie in

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.320
in Japan in December, to be out in December. Very cool, is it going to be...

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.920
I'm guessing it's not live-action. Well, that's why I said animated.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.040
Oh, I'm sorry. Missed that part.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.880
There's no real information about if it's actually going to have a plot

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:17.320
because really the game has no plot. You paid off your house, drama!

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:21.040
Well, I would hope a movie would have a plot, but is the plot going to be

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.480
you run around the village and, you know, run errands and deliver mail?

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.240
there's gotta be something. I think it's gonna be, oh, tragedy has hit your

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.500
forest, blah blah, band together, save blah blah blah.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:35.240
The man is trying to bulldoze Animal Forest, you know?

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.800
Because Animal Forest, right, is the translation in Japan, right? Right.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:44.200
I think that the Japanese DS one was called

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.120
Aiedeo Doubutsu no Mori, I think it was, I have to

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.880
think. But at any rate, the director

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:58.040
The director for the movie will be Shimura Joji, who worked on Master Keaton and Shin

01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.040
Angio Onishi.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:04.200
Sorry, I'm all tongue tied today, because I'm all bleh.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:09.000
But Nintendo's talked before, though, that they want to get in the animation business,

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.720
and I think the Animal Crossing is going to be a really good way for them to bring that

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:19.920
goal together, because it was actually stated by the former president of Nintendo, Yamauchi

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:27.840
Hiroshi, stating that they were trying to put funds together to create an animated film

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.840
project.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.400
So maybe that's this in particular.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.400
That's great.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:38.380
Spiritsnare in our chat room says, what do you say, Animal Crossing live action would

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:39.380
be a WTF.

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:41.440
It would be more like furry crossing.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.440
Ew.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.480
They do a claymation.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:48.360
All right, and here you go, Loki, and this would explain why I've seen the legendary

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.680
pictures before.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.800
GK128 posted a little linky in our chatroom to the profile on Internet Movie Database

01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:00.680
and here you go, they did Batman Begins and Superman Returns.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.000
You want to take back what you said before?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
That's a little bit better.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.440
Alright, there you go.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.360
So if you were in the midst of writing an angry email to Loki, we got it cleared up.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.280
Okay, Legendary Pictures, okay by us now.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.280
Sorry.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.280
Yeah, they get the big thumbs up.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.280
Loki's bad.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.280
Alright.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.320
Like I said, see, you think Warner though.

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:22.280
Warner and DC, you don't think legendary when you hear of those films, so whatever, just

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.960
try to defend yourself best you can.

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:27.680
Alright, I'm just giving you a hard time.

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:32.960
Loki, now this isn't about a game turning into a TV show, but it's about games showing

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.600
up on a TV show, yes?

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.600
Yes.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.680
A show that I am not watching this year.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.120
Me neither, so it makes it a little tough.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:52.900
But apparently on The Apprentice last week, they did a competition to design the best

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:59.040
Xbox 360 display in Wal-Mart and from what I hear, both of them sucked really bad.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.280
From what I read on the internet, one team didn't finish in time and they were missing

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.000
something that held their tent up so it was falling over and they won anyway because the

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.720
other one was so freaking bad.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.740
But the review team apparently recognized what they were trying to go for and liked

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.020
it better.

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.220
One thing I want to point out though, some folks were saying, oh, this is why Jay Allard

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.880
wasn't at E3 because he showed up in this week's Apprentice.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:26.780
These Apprentice things are taped long in advance, actually longer than that.

01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:30.940
This season of the Apprentice was taped in November, so these boosts that they were designing

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:33.020
were for the launch, most likely.

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:37.180
So it has nothing to do with why he was or wasn't at E3, I just want to point that out

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:42.340
because some folks are forgetting that. Like Survivor and all that crap is taped long in

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:51.820
advance. Yay! Apparently, whatever the case may be, the winner I guess their displays

01:14:51.820 --> 01:15:01.060
were displayed in 1500 Walmart stores. So, I haven't seen a 360 display in Walmarts,

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.340
So I don't know.

01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.340
Were they that bad?

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.340
Apparently so.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:10.660
Alright, one more story for this part of the show and then we're going to go to a little

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:14.620
break and this has to do with the Booth Boys of E3.

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:18.980
Now you hear a lot about Booth Babes, but with Booth Babes essentially getting, you

01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:24.060
know, forcing them to tone down a little bit this year, now we have news on Booth Boys

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:28.260
and this comes from a blog called Wonderland, is the name of the blog.

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:34.020
The author here wrote down their list of the top boys of E3, and in the list here they

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:40.740
have Peter in the Namco booth, who has a little pack head there, Brian from Brothers in Arms

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:44.700
there, ready for action, a little military guy there, let's see who else is in here,

01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:52.220
just a couple of Webzen folks there, the poker dealer over there, Martin Lung, the video

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.220
game pianist.

01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:55.180
I actually got some video of him.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:56.940
Yeah, he was a very talented guy.

01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:57.940
I got to meet him.

01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:01.940
He actually blindfolded himself with someone's t-shirt.

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:07.660
Fatality who had his own booth this year and taking the show though, the number one booth

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:12.100
guy according to this blog, Adam West.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.840
Now what I thought was interesting is that there was another website who ran a story

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:20.980
on booth guys and they distinctly showed a picture of the guy at Nokia's booth because

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:25.800
I guess amongst all those girls in the white t-shirts and stuff, there was actually a guy

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.480
who was a pretty good-looking guy that was there at the booth and they were saying we

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.480
saw him.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.120
I don't remember seeing him or someone mentioned him.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:38.480
I think Miklotov mentioned him probably probably leave it to him to point out something like

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:43.440
that definitely but no I totally missed it but yeah I don't know it I my thought was

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:48.520
when I first saw it maybe he was there to he was just worked for the company and just

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.400
happened to be pretty good-looking but maybe he was in there amongst all the women I don't

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.920
I didn't really I didn't okay

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.980
I didn't spend time in engages booth except to walk through it to get around the masses of people

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:02.720
Watching the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer at Konami exactly plus they have that like mist coming down

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.720
so if you're hot and you're just like

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:09.440
Mist you know they have those Namco hats at the Namco store

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:16.420
The the cat the Pac-man hats I want one for my birthday buy them. I want one for my birthday $30

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:21.240
I want one for my birthday. We'll see all right. I want a giant puka all right

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:25.000
that's gonna do it for this half of the show we'll be back in a little bit with

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.720
