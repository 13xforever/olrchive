04:35.500 --> 04:38.500
You won that Evergreen song, I think, didn't you?

04:38.500 --> 04:39.000
He did.

04:39.000 --> 04:39.500
I did?

04:39.500 --> 04:41.000
I think he did.

04:41.000 --> 04:41.500
I did?

04:41.500 --> 04:42.000
Yes, you did.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.500
Yes!

04:43.500 --> 04:46.500
DarkSocker and I both confirmed it, so you won last time.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.000
Oh, I had another song, too.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
I didn't even remember.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Well, too bad for you.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Too bad.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
So we'll get into K2i shortly, but first, real quickly, how was your two weeks?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
How was your day?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
DarkSocker, how was the Alabama trip?

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
My family loves my husband, which makes me very relieved.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.840
We went, the first night there, we went to Waffle House, which Dan wasn't thrilled about,

05:06.840 --> 05:09.840
but I was like, hash browns!

05:09.840 --> 05:10.840
So I had Waffle House.

05:10.840 --> 05:15.200
And then the next day, we went to Cracker Barrel, which Dan liked, and I had fried okra

05:15.200 --> 05:19.560
and fried catfish and fried everything else.

05:19.560 --> 05:31.320
And we went to see my ex-roommates, my mama-san and my papa-san, who took care of me during

05:31.320 --> 05:37.140
really difficult time and we went to the Atlanta Bread Company for dinner that

05:37.140 --> 05:40.320
night and but we weren't before closing so they weren't all that great and then

05:40.320 --> 05:45.180
steak and shake where their food is awful that chili on the spaghetti yes

05:45.180 --> 05:49.940
you can get full on marinara sauce and chili on the spaghetti it's horrible

05:49.940 --> 05:55.020
their fries are awful but their milkshakes are the best ever they do

05:55.020 --> 05:59.880
this thing called like the side-by-side which I had a banana and dark chocolate

05:59.880 --> 06:04.920
milkshake and mixed them and it was fabulous. I did not eat my blue bell ice cream but I

06:04.920 --> 06:10.640
did have boiled peanuts. We also ate at a place called Cooper T's and it's a very weird

06:10.640 --> 06:17.640
thing sharing beer with my brother. He's going to be 22 this month. Happy birthday Matt.

06:20.600 --> 06:27.520
My brother, I also found out my brother Phillip is on a naval boat. He's a marine. Somewhere

06:27.520 --> 06:35.600
in Asia somewhere. He's supposed to be going, I think, to Hokkaido, then down to Okinawa,

06:35.600 --> 06:41.200
then around the China coast, and then back home. Doing something or the other, I don't

06:41.200 --> 06:48.000
know. I just told him to bring me back stuff. And we also went to the Mobile Museum of Art,

06:48.000 --> 06:53.920
which is very nice. There was a lot of local art there too, as well as some very nice classics.

06:53.920 --> 06:59.780
There was even a couple of Renoir there, really nice stuff.

06:59.780 --> 07:06.680
We also went to Dothan on Monday, I was actually born in Dothan.

07:06.680 --> 07:11.460
We went to go see my dad and my granny and they conveniently forgot that I am on a low

07:11.460 --> 07:16.680
carb eating plan and vegetarian so they had steak and pecan pie.

07:16.680 --> 07:20.800
I ate some steak to make my daddy happy, it was pretty good, made me very ill and pecan

07:20.800 --> 07:27.780
pie which is very yummy and it was very interesting meeting my dad's new fiance

07:27.780 --> 07:33.780
one of several she was nice though I like her maybe they'd be happy we went

07:33.780 --> 07:39.180
back I have a little peanuts we went and ate at Ruby Tuesday's the next day we go

07:39.180 --> 07:44.340
to the to Winston Winston's oyster house I fried oysters and I'm happy my uncle's

07:44.340 --> 07:49.820
there gives us Mardi Gras stuff and then we flew home that day very very

07:49.820 --> 07:55.100
horrible plane ride I was in the up in the air for six hours running into a

07:55.100 --> 08:01.000
headwind with massive turbulence it was to suck but I did watch most of Hellboy

08:01.000 --> 08:06.140
sweet and movie is pretty cool and of course Dan played lots of Phoenix Wright

08:06.140 --> 08:13.100
and I played lots of Animal Crossing I went on a trip I went to Virginia did

08:13.100 --> 08:17.660
you have a nice fall um shut up here's a list of things I did for the first time

08:17.660 --> 08:19.180
that might make you a little bit proud.

08:19.180 --> 08:22.500
Uh, I ate- remember, we're from the West Coast, we don't have some of this stuff, so it's

08:22.500 --> 08:23.500
all new to us.

08:23.500 --> 08:27.440
Uh, I ate at a Sonic, I've never eaten at a Sonic before, pretty good, they have a wide

08:27.440 --> 08:28.440
selection of stuff.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.440
There's one in Yuba City.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.380
Yeah, but I still have never eaten there, and that's 40 minutes away for those playing

08:32.380 --> 08:33.380
along now.

08:33.380 --> 08:37.460
There's, uh, one that's going in by, uh, Arco.

08:37.460 --> 08:39.980
It's not- it's not bad, so, you know, check it out.

08:39.980 --> 08:40.980
It's across from the Hooters.

08:40.980 --> 08:44.540
Okay, here's the other thing, I ate at a Chick-fil-A for the first time.

08:44.540 --> 08:46.460
There's one in Roseville.

08:46.460 --> 08:47.460
Is there now?

08:47.460 --> 08:51.300
They were putting one in here. It's been there since August so much for this like East Coast thing

08:51.300 --> 08:55.380
What else they do for the first time? Um, oh, I ate at a Hardee's for like the first time in years

08:56.180 --> 09:01.980
Aka Carl's Jr. Yeah, let me let me tell no no no Carl's Jr. Nasty. No, Carl's Jr. Is way better than Hardee's

09:01.980 --> 09:06.340
No, I'm saying it's Carl's Jr. But nasty. Yeah, you guys on the East Coast you have it

09:06.340 --> 09:12.680
Sorry, Carl's Jr. Is way better. Did you go to crystal three words Western bacon? No, they didn't have that there or at least I didn't find it

09:13.780 --> 09:16.580
Let's see. What else I do in Virginia. I went to an aquarium there

09:16.580 --> 09:20.580
Let me just put it this way, the coolest thing at the aquarium was the bird cage.

09:20.580 --> 09:22.580
You go figure that one out.

09:22.580 --> 09:25.580
And I went to the beach. That was the first time I'd really been to the East Coast beach.

09:25.580 --> 09:29.580
No, I did it the second time because I forgot. I went to Fire Island years ago.

09:29.580 --> 09:32.580
No, just a couple years ago I went to Fire Island very randomly.

09:32.580 --> 09:34.580
Get your mind out of the gutter. We just walked around the beach.

09:34.580 --> 09:36.580
If you know what that is.

09:36.580 --> 09:39.580
And if you know what that is, hats off to you.

09:39.580 --> 09:44.580
And I guess, let's see, what else did I do in Virginia?

09:44.580 --> 09:46.580
Not a lot. I camped out in the hotel most of the time.

09:46.580 --> 09:50.580
I ate and ate a lot of food. I gained about five pounds on my trip, so I'm not proud of that.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.580
But I'll be working it off pretty soon.

09:54.580 --> 09:56.580
That's pretty much it. That's all I really want to share.

09:56.580 --> 10:04.580
It was cold. You know what? For the first time in my life in Chesapeake, I saw snow falling from the sky for the first time.

10:04.580 --> 10:09.580
I've never seen that ever in my life until I went to this place.

10:09.580 --> 10:12.580
But it only snowed the one day, and apparently they never get snow.

10:12.580 --> 10:16.120
they get snow like as often as we do here. But I saw it smoke and I had to scrape snow

10:16.120 --> 10:18.860
off my car the first day and I was like, this is going to set the mood for my trip right

10:18.860 --> 10:19.860
here.

10:19.860 --> 10:22.080
Loki, how was your past couple of weeks?

10:22.080 --> 10:30.120
We found a DJ for our wedding. He's crazy. I quit Final Fantasy XI and that was pretty

10:30.120 --> 10:31.120
tough.

10:31.120 --> 10:35.120
What happened to the shell? Are you able to pass that off to somebody else or?

10:35.120 --> 10:40.720
No. So they better be careful who they add because they can't delete anybody and they

10:40.720 --> 10:47.280
can't create new. They'll just create another show, I don't care, whatever. And then I played

10:47.280 --> 10:54.760
a lot of Full Auto. I didn't play any Animal Crossing and I'm tired of that game already.

10:54.760 --> 11:01.320
And I don't know, it's been pretty much just a lot of getting last minute wedding stuff

11:01.320 --> 11:08.640
done, starting to send out the invitations, and I was figuring out the last bit of stuff,

11:08.640 --> 11:17.320
got the cake-flavors picked out. And I'm supposed to be getting a bachelor party sometime in

11:17.320 --> 11:25.400
early April. And yeah. So, mainly I'm just work stuff, you know, trying to catch up,

11:25.400 --> 11:33.080
trying to win my VIP pass to E3. I don't know if I am, seeing as I'm 30 accounts behind

11:33.080 --> 11:38.760
someone else because, well, I just haven't had good luck with my territory.

11:38.760 --> 11:39.760
It's rigged.

11:39.760 --> 11:45.280
Yes, it is rigged. I am pretty certain that it is rigged, but I'm going to beg them for

11:45.280 --> 11:52.300
a VIP account, or a VIP pass anyways because I deserve it. Whereas the other guy doesn't

11:52.300 --> 11:58.120
know what the hell he would do with it. So, I should be able to get one. I mean, fuck.

11:58.120 --> 12:01.080
I mean, some of my managers are getting them and they don't play games. They don't even

12:01.080 --> 12:05.620
know anything about games so hopefully I'll be able to swing that otherwise we

12:05.620 --> 12:11.160
gotta get a media pass look on that I know I know and then yeah that's that's

12:11.160 --> 12:16.440
it all right we're spike anything real quick you want to share about how your

12:16.440 --> 12:24.120
week's been going devil may cry 3 special edition needs to be harder but

12:24.120 --> 12:29.380
isn't it hot though oh yeah no it's all that's hot that game is hot but yeah I

12:29.380 --> 12:31.380
I thought it had a harder difficulty in that.

12:31.380 --> 12:38.380
It's the same as the old hard difficulty, just renamed Super Hard, and then there's a new Super Easy mode.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.380
Well, why don't you play through it with the other character?

12:40.380 --> 12:48.380
They need to name them and do them according to the Doom model. Hurt me plenty, nightmare, you know, and make them equally hard.

12:48.380 --> 12:54.700
Know what I was so sad is when they announced that whole rockstar table tennis thing did the whole

12:55.220 --> 13:00.940
Tease of it was no. We've got news of a game. That's coming to the 360 that you would never expect

13:01.820 --> 13:08.620
The here and I was like Duke Nukem forever Duke Nukem forever come on. It's gonna be Duke Nukem forever no

13:10.380 --> 13:11.980
All right

13:11.980 --> 13:17.260
Anything else no really my whole life is video games. It's it's sad. That's all no. That's awesome. You're hardcore

13:17.260 --> 13:22.260
That's why you're the guest tonight, because we know you're hardcore, we feel, we see it in your soul.

13:22.260 --> 13:25.260
Alright, um, that's right, rock.

13:25.260 --> 13:30.260
Anyway, let's get to the cage match, because we gotta start wrapping things up here.

13:30.260 --> 13:35.260
Now, Loki, we determined that you actually won, but you put a new song in the directory and took out the old one,

13:35.260 --> 13:37.260
so I think we're just going to do Clean Slate tonight.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.260
Okay, I forgot I deleted it, yeah.

13:39.260 --> 13:44.260
Let's just do Clean Slate tonight, because, you know, honestly, with us being gone for two weeks,

13:44.260 --> 13:48.180
for two weeks i think pretty much it would have been on for a month anyway so

13:48.180 --> 13:52.020

Here's a hint distorted reality with super crush

14:21.180 --> 14:25.440
Oh, yeah, this is a song that I found on Amazon because the original fun

14:25.440 --> 14:29.520
I was looking for I couldn't find a website that could pirate it from so this is

14:30.400 --> 14:35.580
Yeah, I don't even know what the sounds like so it's another random song that picked up in the middle of nowhere

14:35.580 --> 14:40.960
Goody goody gumdrop. Hey what it worked last time, so will the magic work again of randomness?

14:40.960 --> 14:45.960

15:10.960 --> 15:30.960
Supergrass, Supergrass, Supergrass

15:30.960 --> 15:44.920
I'll erase all you hold dear Facing you I feel the sky behind me

15:44.920 --> 15:50.600
You're in this bed of fear I'll erase all you hold dear

15:50.600 --> 15:56.920
Facing you I feel the sky behind me You said goodbye

15:56.920 --> 16:03.240
You will rest across this space As you face your disgrace

16:03.240 --> 16:28.240
To the ground, to the ground, to the ground

16:28.240 --> 16:31.240
I will lay my life worth two

16:31.240 --> 16:34.240
Throw out all the thoughts of you

16:34.240 --> 16:37.240
Where to be for days but still

16:37.240 --> 16:40.240
Fighting nothing can fulfill

16:40.240 --> 16:43.240
Facing you I feel the sky

16:43.240 --> 16:47.240
Behind me you said goodbye

16:47.240 --> 16:50.240
You will wrestle for this fate

16:50.240 --> 16:54.240
As you say, you're just right

17:02.240 --> 17:07.240
You can't call

17:07.240 --> 17:11.240
To the crash

17:11.240 --> 17:37.760
When you've been done for truth you'll find Nothing but your empty mind

17:37.760 --> 17:44.260
I know it's time for you to stay With the way I felt great

18:07.760 --> 18:14.760
I'll erase all you hold dear, saving you I feel the sky, behind me you said goodbye

18:14.760 --> 18:18.760
Underneath the rinses, tear and fear

18:18.760 --> 18:21.760
I'll erase all you hold dear

18:21.760 --> 18:24.760
Facing you, I'll fill the sky

18:24.760 --> 18:28.760
Behind me, you said goodbye

18:28.760 --> 18:31.760
To the rest of our mistakes

18:31.760 --> 18:35.760
And if you say you're this great

19:05.760 --> 19:12.160
Yo, that was song number one tonight. Distorted Reality was super crush. Let's see what the

19:12.160 --> 19:17.640
folks in the studio thought of it. But remember, it's not up to us. It's up to you. Dark Sockra.

19:17.640 --> 19:23.760
It was cool. It was cool, just a little repetitive, but it gets a 7.5.

19:23.760 --> 19:30.760
Uh, generic goth club song for me. 6. Loki. Gets an 8. Cause, yeah, I don't know why.

19:30.760 --> 19:35.960
I don't know why I first ever heard it. So yeah. All right, let's move on to song number two tonight

19:35.960 --> 19:41.560
Which comes to us from dark soccer. What'd you pick for us tonight? Um, I put it was the afterbirth

19:42.920 --> 19:45.520
However, you know glass last time

19:45.520 --> 19:50.140
However, so many people said that it should have been my cage match song that I put it in the cage match today

19:50.320 --> 19:53.160
So it's compressor and the empty front a lot

19:54.080 --> 19:56.080
What's the name of this song? It's rappers

19:56.080 --> 20:03.080
Rappers We Crush by Compressor featuring MC Frontalot. Enjoy.

20:26.080 --> 20:30.480
Like I ain't hung over with the paper Discover that the Germans are the next Grover

20:30.480 --> 20:35.080
Cookie, Kermy, Piggy, and all the rest The rate a single domestically controlled

20:35.080 --> 20:38.780
Muffet, let, let, is it a plot? Some kind of conspiracy, my coffee's cold

20:38.780 --> 20:43.180
There's a bitter taste to my cinnamon roll I venture forth into the bright American day

20:43.180 --> 20:48.380
My neighbor Mr. Hess says V gates and waves I hurry away, get my Chrysler over dismay

20:48.380 --> 20:51.580
Somebody's replaced all on my backstreet moorings with crabs or tape

20:51.580 --> 20:53.580
Alright, I'm freaked out, I hope it's a joke

20:53.580 --> 20:56.880
I hear the ominous industrial beat of a two-stroke engine

20:56.880 --> 20:57.380
What?

20:57.380 --> 20:58.880
It bends on my letter, it's a bug on my right

20:58.880 --> 20:59.380
What?

20:59.380 --> 21:01.380
A state of six trombones encroaching behind

21:01.380 --> 21:04.080
At the wheel of the lead trivia visit your fear

21:04.080 --> 21:06.880
Red and yellow eyes, black gloves tripping the steer

21:06.880 --> 21:09.180
And then it dawns upon me, what chance have I got?

21:09.180 --> 21:12.380
It's compressor and he's chosen for crushing and see criminalize

21:12.380 --> 21:16.280
We crush, fingers to dust

21:16.280 --> 21:21.380
Compressor, digest, barcodes, it's without much

21:21.380 --> 21:23.880
You try too much with rhymes

21:23.880 --> 21:26.880
Stolen from the Jackson Prize

21:26.880 --> 21:28.880
Erase your dreams at night

21:28.880 --> 21:31.380
You cower farm called mastermind

21:31.380 --> 21:32.880
But I don't want to be crushed

21:32.880 --> 21:33.880
They're eating deer

21:33.880 --> 21:34.880
Left for toad

21:34.880 --> 21:35.880
Synthesize the mite

21:35.880 --> 21:37.380
Tearing the rhymes right out of my throat

21:37.380 --> 21:38.880
Leave my call at the light and run

21:38.880 --> 21:39.880
I make for the park

21:39.880 --> 21:41.380
Perceived by steel-toed deck

21:41.380 --> 21:43.380
Boots throwing socks as they march

21:43.380 --> 21:45.380
And I can hear the gnashing of the yellow teeth

21:45.380 --> 21:47.880
You cannot hide, rapper geek

21:47.880 --> 21:48.880
I'm dodging German shepherds

21:48.880 --> 21:50.380
Playing Frisbee with the hippies

21:50.380 --> 21:54.380
Making hairpin turns like horror movie heroines I'm slipping back on my feet

21:54.380 --> 21:57.380
His breath on my neck, it smells of baked infants and fried cheese

21:57.380 --> 22:00.380
Fun! You're sure to suffer crushing if you sit still

22:00.380 --> 22:03.380
Pop the chain link to the abandoned beaner schnitzel

22:03.380 --> 22:06.380
What did I do to deserve this? What was my crime?

22:06.380 --> 22:08.380
Was it because I sampled the totem hosing that one time?

22:08.380 --> 22:10.380
And I'm reviewing my life powered under a grease trap

22:10.380 --> 22:13.380
The boot slap's stepping ever closer with it

22:13.380 --> 22:15.380
Click clack, now he's here, now he's crouching down

22:15.380 --> 22:18.380
Jaws peek open and start pouring out

22:18.380 --> 22:33.980
And just as my flesh is about to get devoured, I wake up screaming, wrapped in the sour sweat, stained sheets, takes a minute to get that, stumble to the table, read the paper, clear my head up, still hurts, what'd I drink all back old soccer for? Business section, A.M., TV, bar, gym, Henson Court!

22:33.980 --> 22:38.180
Bappas crush, bingas through dust

22:38.180 --> 22:43.180
Compress that tight as fo' gold fans spin down to mush

22:43.180 --> 22:46.180
You try to fudge with crimes

22:46.180 --> 22:48.780
Stolen from the Jackson 5

22:48.780 --> 22:51.180
Erase your tings at night

22:51.180 --> 22:54.180
CALIFORN COMPRESSOR MIGHT!

22:54.180 --> 23:23.180
Song number two tonight, Compressor featuring MC Frontalot with rappers we crush, what do

23:23.180 --> 23:27.180
What do you think about that song? Is it great, or do you just want to crush it with your fists?

23:27.180 --> 23:28.180
Dark Sakura.

23:28.180 --> 23:29.180
Nein.

23:29.180 --> 23:30.180
Any reason?

23:30.180 --> 23:33.180
I was actually saying no in German.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.180
Oh, gotcha.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.180
The number 9, too.

23:36.180 --> 23:37.180
Okay.

23:37.180 --> 23:41.180
I would have to say, you know, I think I liked it better the last time I heard it, but it's got clever lyrics.

23:41.180 --> 23:45.180
That's what I like about it, because they rap about Muppets, and that's pretty hardcore.

23:45.180 --> 23:47.180
So I'm going to give it...

23:47.180 --> 23:50.180
Well, I definitely want to give it a higher than the last one, but not by much, so 7.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.180
Logie.

23:51.180 --> 23:56.180
That's gonna get us sick. I don't care for MC Frontalot at all.

23:56.180 --> 24:01.180
Alright, let's get into song number 3 tonight. Song number 3 is my pick, and I love this band.

24:01.180 --> 24:05.180
They were in UltraMix 3, and they have a remix album coming out soon.

24:05.180 --> 24:10.180
and this song is called Going Under. It's a kinetic mix. Enjoy.

24:35.180 --> 24:40.180
And I think I'm getting ground

24:42.180 --> 24:47.180
This whole thing pulls me so far alone

24:49.180 --> 24:53.180
I realize that I am bound

24:56.180 --> 25:00.180
Take control of my reason

25:00.180 --> 25:07.180
I am going under, under Please tell, tell me just what's right

25:07.180 --> 25:14.180
No, I'll be safe May inside me open the eyes

25:14.180 --> 25:20.180
Please tell, tell me that's my friend

25:20.180 --> 25:23.180
So what do you say?

25:23.180 --> 25:28.180
May inside me open the light

25:28.180 --> 25:33.180
So what, have I not been fed?

26:33.180 --> 26:45.180
And I'm really trying to reveal My composure and my pride

26:45.180 --> 26:58.180
The internet just seems gaping wounds Can we call the anguish inside?

26:58.180 --> 27:13.180
Say wish and sigh, say wish and sigh, say wish and sigh

27:13.180 --> 27:15.180
So how do we play?

27:16.180 --> 27:20.180
Can't help the open door, right?

27:21.180 --> 27:22.180
That's right

27:23.180 --> 27:25.180
Can't help the open door

27:27.180 --> 27:28.180
I'm awake

27:29.180 --> 27:33.180
I am going under, under

27:34.180 --> 27:35.180
Sweet time

27:36.180 --> 27:38.180
Got me scared for a round

27:38.180 --> 27:42.180
So, so, so we play

27:42.180 --> 27:56.180
Song number three tonight, the Azzoic going under Kinetic Mix.

27:56.180 --> 28:00.180
Let's see what the kids thought of that one, Dark Sakura.

28:00.180 --> 28:04.180
Um, better than the usual picks.

28:04.180 --> 28:07.180
Aw, how sweet.

28:07.180 --> 28:11.680
I mean, seriously, I mean, it's kind of less generic, so it gets an 8.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.680
Alright, uh, moving on.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.680
Logie, what do you think of the Azoic going under?

28:15.680 --> 28:17.680
It's kind of average, 7.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.680
Alright, uh, I like that mix.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.680
But I think I like the original one slightly better, so it gets an 8 from me.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.680
Alright, place vote now.

28:25.680 --> 28:28.680
Here it is with three songs you can pick from tonight.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.680
Distorted Reality with Super Crush.

28:31.680 --> 28:41.240
And song number two you can vote for tonight, Compressor featuring MC Frontalot, Rappers

28:41.240 --> 28:49.780
We Crush.

28:49.780 --> 28:59.680
And song number three you can vote for tonight, The Ozoic with Going Under, the kinetic mix.

28:59.680 --> 29:06.440
Place a vote now, send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, you don't

29:06.440 --> 29:11.080
have much time so, frickin' hurry up, frickin' hurry with it.

29:11.080 --> 29:16.920
Okay, now that we're in the afterbirth, now I suppose we can talk about the Oscars a little

29:16.920 --> 29:17.920
bit.

29:17.920 --> 29:23.320
Miek Latov, I see you lurking back there, wanna come on the show for a little bit?

29:23.320 --> 29:24.320
You just want your iPod?

29:24.320 --> 29:25.720
I see how you are.

29:25.720 --> 29:31.840
well come yeah I'll make you work for it come here where's the microphone there

29:31.840 --> 29:35.720
it is on the ground there now are you mad about the Oscars because I heard

29:35.720 --> 29:39.400
that crash one and not Brokeback Mountain I can't be mad about the

29:39.400 --> 29:44.080
Oscars because they were obviously just the joke Oscar since that pimp song won

29:44.080 --> 29:49.080
best song did it really yeah so have you seen hustle and flow though it is

29:49.080 --> 29:53.200
actually supposed to be pretty good granted I don't watch this type of

29:53.200 --> 29:58.880
movies but it is supposed to be you know more than just an urban movie yeah but

29:58.880 --> 30:03.480
the song is like it's hard being a pimp or something I thought the Oscars were a

30:03.480 --> 30:07.520
little class have you been a pimp don't you know how hard to give him the Oscars

30:07.520 --> 30:11.320
are Hollywood sucking its own dick like I know that people tell you you can't

30:11.320 --> 30:13.880
suck your own dick but if you're in Hollywood you can because it's essentially

30:13.880 --> 30:17.660
what the Oscars are and I think you know and I realize that the Oscars must be

30:17.660 --> 30:21.080
like the gay Super Bowl but I fell out of love with the Oscars years ago

30:21.080 --> 30:27.960
because you just start to realize it's all just one giant publicity stunt. Do you know why Crash

30:27.960 --> 30:32.760
won best movie? Because they sent out over a hundred thousand screeners to people and you know

30:32.760 --> 30:37.560
ran ads and stuff and please don't get me wrong Crash was a really good movie and Brokeback Mountain

30:37.560 --> 30:41.720
was a really good movie but you know what there were thousands you know there I'm sure there were

30:41.720 --> 30:46.040
lots of maybe not thousands but there were lots of good movies this year and who's to say Saw 2

30:46.040 --> 30:53.040
should have won. Saw 2 totally should have won. Who won the Razzies? Was it crazy?

30:54.500 --> 31:00.560
We didn't look to see who won a Razzie. Yeah he did. I think he won it for BloodRayne.

31:00.560 --> 31:06.080
I'm sure he did. Go look it up. I really didn't care about the Oscars this year because I

31:06.080 --> 31:11.860
figured Brokeback would probably lose even though it deserved to win out of what was

31:11.860 --> 31:19.660
there. And so it's like, whatever, the pimps one, the racists one. It's fine.

31:19.660 --> 31:25.600
How was Jon Stewart his host? Rather uncomfortable. He looked like he really

31:25.600 --> 31:29.860
didn't belong, but Stephen Colbert, that's his name, right?

31:29.860 --> 31:36.580
I heard he made an appearance or something. He did some sort of like PSA for, just a joke

31:36.580 --> 31:42.940
PSA like you know a commercial saying how this audio engineer doesn't deserve

31:42.940 --> 31:46.480
to win but this audio engineer does like you know like a political commercial is

31:46.480 --> 31:52.460
it's pretty funny but most of the time I actually didn't watch the Oscars I flip

31:52.460 --> 31:57.300
to it to see a couple of the awards that I mostly watch. Weren't you guys watching like a

31:57.300 --> 32:01.140
Law & Order marathon? I am if I was in the living room right now I'd still be watching

32:01.140 --> 32:06.140
Um, unfortunately for you guys, I don't think we've all won.

32:06.140 --> 32:07.140
Oh, he didn't win?

32:07.140 --> 32:08.140
Hallelujah.

32:08.140 --> 32:10.140
The winner for worst, we want him to win a rather.

32:10.140 --> 32:13.140
The winner for worst picture is Dirty Love.

32:13.140 --> 32:16.140
Worst actor goes to Rob Schneider.

32:16.140 --> 32:17.140
Ha ha.

32:17.140 --> 32:20.140
Worst actress would be Jenny McCarthy, also in Dirty Love.

32:20.140 --> 32:21.140
She's awesome though.

32:21.140 --> 32:26.140
Worst supporting actor, Hayden Christensen in Star Wars Episode III.

32:26.140 --> 32:32.020
worst supporting actress Paris Hilton in House of Wax and they spell wax wrong

32:32.020 --> 32:37.020
that's funny and then worst on-screen couple Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman in

32:37.020 --> 32:44.420
Bewitched worst sequel or remake Son of the Mask and worst website the Razzie

32:44.420 --> 32:48.940
Awards imagine that look at that crap website it looks like it was made in

32:48.940 --> 32:57.040
Angelfire. Here, plug, I know you can't talk about anything that goes on at Konami because

32:57.040 --> 33:01.320
of NDAs and stuff, but plug your favorite board game, which has nothing to do with your

33:01.320 --> 33:05.680
game. Oh! Apples to Apples is the best board game. It has actually taken over break time

33:05.680 --> 33:10.900
at work. Mario Kart is no longer the reigning champion. We play Apples to Apples because

33:10.900 --> 33:14.360
it's really, really fun. That was quite fun. Really quickly, what do you do in Apples to

33:14.360 --> 33:21.300
Um, you judge people, that's pretty much what you do, okay, no, like, there's this judge

33:21.300 --> 33:26.220
and he puts down an adjective card, and then everybody else looks at the cards in their

33:26.220 --> 33:30.640
hands and they're all nouns, and then they place what they think the judge thinks would

33:30.640 --> 33:35.920
be the best match, and then the judge picks up all the cards, looks at them, and then

33:35.920 --> 33:38.360
he awards a point to what he thinks is the best.

33:38.360 --> 33:42.920
But the main part of the game is saying why you don't think certain cards should win,

33:42.920 --> 33:47.160
if you're you yeah who likes to judge everybody pretty much that's why it's

33:47.160 --> 33:52.280
fun all right let's announce the winner tonight's cage match so we can wrap this

33:52.280 --> 33:56.540
show up here you guys ready this is a very very close cage match tonight might

33:56.540 --> 34:02.280
I say one of the closer ones in years because one vote separated the winner

34:02.280 --> 34:06.840
from the runner-up and then one vote separated the one runner-up from third

34:06.840 --> 34:11.600
place so all three songs were very neck and neck but in the end there can be

34:11.600 --> 34:13.400
only one

34:13.400 --> 34:20.400
and tonight's winner is...

34:20.960 --> 34:22.280
I won stinkin' vote

34:22.280 --> 34:26.880
over compressor two stinkin' votes. Just like the Oscars, the one that's most

34:26.880 --> 34:29.800
fresh in the minds of the voters

34:29.800 --> 34:33.160
is the one that won. I bought all those votes but I actually placed an add in

34:33.160 --> 34:34.280
variety this week

34:34.280 --> 34:38.080
for your consideration the Azoic going under kinetic

34:38.080 --> 34:39.360
best supporting

34:39.360 --> 34:42.460
on uh... internet radio station

34:42.460 --> 34:46.700
lovely

34:46.700 --> 34:49.200
the time wrap up now i'm getting tired and worn out

35:08.140 --> 35:09.920
uh...

35:09.920 --> 35:12.460
what we're talking about the meantime what else is going on

35:12.460 --> 35:13.440
i don't know

35:13.440 --> 35:14.520
taxes

35:14.520 --> 35:15.880
and get money

35:15.880 --> 35:17.000
i'd that's how i'd

35:17.000 --> 35:21.720
managed to buy the money twelve hundred from federal and two hundred from state

35:21.720 --> 35:22.920
nice

35:22.920 --> 35:26.000
actually started having them will hold a lot of money

35:26.000 --> 35:26.920
i played

35:26.920 --> 35:28.720
i turned on the cabinet

35:28.720 --> 35:32.040
this weekend and then turned it back up because

35:32.040 --> 35:33.880
i got yelled at for

35:33.880 --> 35:38.120
turning on the cabinet while people were in the house and distracting

35:38.120 --> 35:42.520
the guests and not socializing with people. I know, I know.

35:42.520 --> 35:47.680
Did I just send Dan out to the garage to play the MAME? We have ours built out of a stand-up

35:47.680 --> 35:50.680
play position. I feel so uncool, I'm the only OLR host with no

35:50.680 --> 35:54.760
MAME cabinet. When I was, I was looking in that, you know, because on the airplane,

35:54.760 --> 35:56.480
because I had a long flight this weekend,

35:56.480 --> 36:00.800
I was looking at the Sky Mall thing, because you know they have the catalog. They have MAME cabinets on the Sky Mall?

36:00.800 --> 36:04.800
Yes, not MAME, but you know, arcade classics, that whole thing.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.800
It was something like $3,600 I think they wanted for it.

36:07.800 --> 36:08.800
Good lord.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.800
And basically take Midway arcade classics 1 and 2, and that's what you get in the pack.

36:12.800 --> 36:18.800
So, you're basically paying $3,600 for a big hunk of plastic and a TV.

36:18.800 --> 36:19.800
That's stupid.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.800
Have you seen the little ones at Target, though? Little baby ones?

36:21.800 --> 36:22.800
No.

36:22.800 --> 36:27.800
They're interesting. I mean, they're still a little pricey for me. I don't think I'd have one, but you know.

36:27.800 --> 36:32.800
I want to make more of my interfaces, but I just don't have room to store them.

36:32.800 --> 36:35.800
I need to get into a new apartment or a new condo or whatever,

36:35.800 --> 36:39.800
so that we have our own bedroom dedicated to the cabinet,

36:39.800 --> 36:45.800
so I can dump them in the closet because, unfortunately, each interface is like six feet wide,

36:45.800 --> 36:49.800
or no, four feet wide. It's just too big.

36:49.800 --> 36:54.800
You know what I want, and, you know, because we had Bobby on the show tonight from All Games,

36:54.800 --> 37:05.800
And he was talking about on another show about how he went to media play, because you know all the media play stores went under, and he frickin' got one of those PlayStation 2 kiosks that you have in the store.

37:05.800 --> 37:06.800
Oh, really?

37:06.800 --> 37:07.800
Yeah, he got one of those in his house.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.800
We have an Xbox One.

37:09.800 --> 37:10.800
Really? God, that's...

37:10.800 --> 37:13.800
Those are about two grand. They're pretty expensive.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.800
Oh my God, really?

37:14.800 --> 37:16.800
Yeah, because I've actually...

37:16.800 --> 37:18.800
I can tell you that's probably not what he paid for it.

37:18.800 --> 37:24.140
I have a thing for Microsoft because they were pimping out there the kiosk before the

37:24.140 --> 37:29.660
360 was coming out and they were like five grand for those. They have really detailed

37:29.660 --> 37:30.660
ones.

37:30.660 --> 37:33.980
Bob, he's going to link a picture right now so you guys can see it in his house. I think

37:33.980 --> 37:35.980
he said he was playing Guitar Hero on it or something. I don't remember.

37:35.980 --> 37:40.920
Oh, well, that's another thing. I've got to set up Guitar Freaks online eventually and

37:40.920 --> 37:46.660
now that they've got actual DDR games running under MAME, that should be pretty cool. What

37:46.660 --> 37:52.100
else was there something else I was gonna try that was pretty cool um he oh

37:52.100 --> 37:56.060
he's he went ahead and told us how much he paid he paid 500 for it yeah that's

37:56.060 --> 37:59.340
pretty good wow that's hardcore though I don't know if I could have spent that

37:59.340 --> 38:03.020
kind of money but you go boy that's awesome here it is here's a picture

38:03.020 --> 38:06.620
hold on loan it up right there there it is oh it is guitar hero right on that's

38:06.620 --> 38:09.620
pretty cool he's got the little i-toys set up there on the top a little cutout

38:09.620 --> 38:18.120
up there. That's awesome. Just sitting in the apartment, chilling. You know you're into

38:18.120 --> 38:25.900
games when... Someday my cabinet will be done. Someday. I've got all the parts, I just need

38:25.900 --> 38:32.340
the time and the space to put it in. Someday it will be mine. Seriously, it's been like

38:32.340 --> 38:36.980
what, in production for two years now? Yeah. Well the big island preview in that apartment.

38:36.980 --> 38:39.880
a brief uh... vacation though of course

38:39.880 --> 38:42.420
let's get a chair refuse are you ready for this

38:58.820 --> 39:00.580
i thought it was much better than i thought it would be

39:00.580 --> 39:02.660
rome and i didn't feel like this

39:02.660 --> 39:05.660

Where's my music?

39:51.320 --> 39:52.320
Thank you.

39:52.320 --> 39:58.060
Legend of Zaku says, F you to giving an already intoxicated girl at a party in my apartment

39:58.060 --> 40:03.380
a shot of Rumple Minz since that one got her passed out, as well as feeling guilty about

40:03.380 --> 40:06.580
giving her the shot.

40:06.580 --> 40:08.780
You college kids and your drunkenness.

40:08.780 --> 40:13.620
Uh, Rama says, F you to Bamaniiso.ws for banning me.

40:13.620 --> 40:16.500
I tried to do my share and keep Torrance up and I got capped for it.

40:16.500 --> 40:20.420
I already got capped twice for sharing Torrance for you guys, but y'all ain't paying my cable

40:20.420 --> 40:22.260
bill, so fuck you, you fucking prick.

40:22.260 --> 40:25.940
Oh, and FYI, your Torrance will always be leaked out to other sites, so suck it.

40:25.940 --> 40:27.740
Hey, you wanna get back at him?

40:27.740 --> 40:29.740
Report him!

40:30.460 --> 40:31.740
Turn him in!

40:31.740 --> 40:33.740
SSJ100, ruin it for everybody.

40:33.740 --> 40:35.740
SSJ100 Matt says,

40:35.740 --> 40:37.740
F you to my anti-Semitic neighbor,

40:37.740 --> 40:39.740
who password locked out my network

40:39.740 --> 40:40.740
and changed it to,

40:40.740 --> 40:42.740
secure your network you dumbass Jew,

40:42.740 --> 40:44.740
and changed my router name to dumbfaggotJew.

40:44.740 --> 40:47.740
It took me a long time to fix everything he messed up

40:47.740 --> 40:49.740
and get my internet working correctly,

40:49.740 --> 40:51.740
all because he hates me and my family for being Jewish.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.740
That's like real...

40:53.740 --> 40:54.740
Can you believe that that exists?

40:54.740 --> 40:55.740
That's not funny!

40:55.740 --> 40:57.740
Can you believe that that exists in the world?

40:59.740 --> 41:00.240
Dick!

41:00.240 --> 41:01.740
I'm going on to rename my router.

41:03.740 --> 41:04.240
Just kidding.

41:04.740 --> 41:05.240
Roz.

41:05.240 --> 41:06.240
Goddamn you, Loki.

41:06.740 --> 41:07.240
Roz says,

41:07.240 --> 41:10.740
F you to co-moderators and annoying people in the roleplaying forum I go to.

41:11.240 --> 41:15.240
One co-mod never shows up and the other one never has a clue of what's going on ever,

41:15.240 --> 41:17.740
yet tries to get me to enforce really stupid rules.

41:17.740 --> 41:21.740
Roleplayers who solely want to go around fighting people for absolutely no reason,

41:21.740 --> 41:23.240
annoy the crap out of me too.

41:23.240 --> 41:29.240
Not everyone is heavily armed or wearing armor so that they'll put up a fight, morons.

41:31.240 --> 41:35.240
If there's any chicks there, I wanna do them!

41:36.240 --> 41:38.240
That's the other kind of roleplay.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.240
And Tomo-kun, last but not least.

41:41.240 --> 41:42.240
Got any Mountain Dew?

41:42.240 --> 41:44.240
That is fuck me for not paying attention.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.240
Fuck Verizon, fuck the creepy guys at the arcade.

41:46.240 --> 41:50.240
Picking up my 15 year old friend.

41:50.240 --> 41:57.240
old friend

41:57.620 --> 42:01.420
that's it for another edition of orange lounge radio to afterbirth

42:01.420 --> 42:02.480
we gotta go

42:02.480 --> 42:03.540
we gotta

42:03.540 --> 42:06.920
take little promo things for our our our big debut

42:06.920 --> 42:08.460
set things on fire

42:08.460 --> 42:13.260
no we're gonna set things on fire i was saying on the podcast last week about

42:13.260 --> 42:14.940
or maybe not even on the podcast

42:14.940 --> 42:17.100
askaninja.com

42:17.100 --> 42:20.100
You know, if we ever become a TV show, that would be a great thing.

42:20.100 --> 42:23.100
They're bigger than we are already. They've been featured on iTunes, like, four weeks in a row.

42:23.100 --> 42:24.100
They were featured on the news!

42:24.100 --> 42:31.100
We were featured on iTunes once, and in a dark, black corner somewhere, and we were lucky to really even get that.

42:31.100 --> 42:41.100
But, you know, it's funny, they featured a video game podcast, I think, like, probably four times since iTunes has gone up.

42:41.100 --> 42:46.100
The only time we were ever mentioned on iTunes was under Interesting Indies, which is kind of cool.

42:46.100 --> 42:51.100
But you know what? The video game podcast, we've never been featured. Bobby's never been featured.

42:51.100 --> 42:56.100
I don't know if All Games Interactive was. Maybe once. But you know who most of them are that get featured?

42:56.100 --> 43:09.100
G4 replays, the X-Play podcast, probably Attack of the Show podcast and all that stuff that, you know, you can turn on your TV and watch, which defeats the purpose of podcasting.

43:09.100 --> 43:12.360
know you couldn't turn on your heavy on and watch it because they would be playing Star

43:12.360 --> 43:19.780
Trek Next Generation, The Man Show, Fast Lane, and oh, Bonsai. Oh, because that game failed

43:19.780 --> 43:24.780
or that show failed on two different networks and then, what is it, G4 is the place where

43:24.780 --> 43:30.040
shows finally go to die, you know, it's like, let's breathe life into it once more and hope

43:30.040 --> 43:34.260
that, you know, it does well. Because it didn't do well in the last two demographics that

43:34.260 --> 43:40.180
tried pushing it on. Don't you miss G4 back when it only kind of sucked? Like, it had

43:40.180 --> 43:45.220
like maybe three shows that were watchable and now it has nothing except for hot Kevin

43:45.220 --> 43:49.900
Pereira action. Had I known that it was going to go down this, you know, slippery slope

43:49.900 --> 43:54.580
here, I would have, you know, maybe not judged G4TV.com so harshly. I was just so much nicer

43:54.580 --> 43:58.940
to G4 in the beginning. I would have said every show on there is awesome. I love it.

43:58.940 --> 44:03.400
I'm a big fan of everybody. Or like electric playground or filter. I know. Like, I love

44:03.400 --> 44:06.400
I love Diane Miyazawa, she's my hero.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.400
Like, you know...

44:08.400 --> 44:10.400
You know, even though I'm gay, she's still pretty hot.

44:10.400 --> 44:12.400
I mean, I gotta admit.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.400
She is! Have you seen her in Mario cosplay?

44:14.400 --> 44:16.400
Is she the one that counts down things?

44:16.400 --> 44:18.400
Yeah, she counts down things on her little show, but...

44:18.400 --> 44:20.400
I don't remember which show.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.400
I think, I want to say she's on the...

44:22.400 --> 44:24.400
She's on Trainspaces, Kids or something like that.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.400
What's she on the Amy Graham show? Three Wishes?

44:26.400 --> 44:29.400
I don't know, but she's on Trainspaces, like, Kids or something.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.400
Counting down wishes?

44:31.400 --> 44:38.400
Alright, anyway, small corrections here.

44:38.400 --> 44:46.400
Black Wolf says, or Bobby of course says that All Games Interactive actually was featured on iTunes once but it was under new and notable.

44:46.400 --> 44:52.400
So that's what makes this little partnership we have going on interesting is that neither one of us are good enough to be featured as a video game podcast.

44:52.400 --> 44:55.400
And I use good enough with loose quotes there.

44:55.400 --> 44:59.400
Put Morgan Webb on your album art and shit, you'll be featured every week.

44:59.400 --> 45:02.040
She's really awesome though, but has a small head.

45:02.040 --> 45:03.040
She is.

45:03.040 --> 45:09.400
That's the one thing I got out of E3 that year, because her head is really tiny.

45:09.400 --> 45:10.400
The show's over.

45:10.400 --> 45:16.640
I got his autograph, like, at the Nintendo Powerfest in, like, 19, whatever.

45:16.640 --> 45:24.180
I still want to know what dumpster our sampler CD ended up in, Loki.

45:24.180 --> 45:25.180
I don't know.

45:25.180 --> 45:29.580
Probably, like, some intern, you know, angered them,

45:29.580 --> 45:33.340
fucking threw it into his head like a ninja star, I don't know.

45:33.340 --> 45:38.060
All right, I want to know what kind of dumpster that the katamari ball ended up in,

45:38.060 --> 45:40.880
because seriously, you know, that thing...

45:40.880 --> 45:46.660
We put our sampler on there. Didn't we put one of the ferrets on it too? Yeah, we did.

45:46.660 --> 45:47.260
All right.

45:47.260 --> 45:51.180
Uh, let's see, buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

45:51.180 --> 45:56.380
Oh, don't forget, G4 was also the channel that brought us video game vixens.

45:56.380 --> 45:59.680
Oh, I missed it.

45:59.680 --> 46:03.820
Hey, at least I had something to do with video games.

46:03.820 --> 46:06.820
Alright, we're done with G4 bashing, honestly.

46:06.820 --> 46:09.460
That's so, you know, yesterday.

46:09.460 --> 46:10.220
Anyway,

46:10.220 --> 46:11.460
let's get this

46:11.460 --> 46:14.700
show done with. Here's your fortune cookie message. Oh, final, final, final, final

46:14.700 --> 46:16.420
thoughts. Mikl Tov.

46:16.420 --> 46:20.660
The new Power Rangers sucks, except for the Green Ranger.

46:20.660 --> 46:21.920
don't look at me like that

46:21.920 --> 46:26.800
spike final final final super duper last thought

46:26.800 --> 46:29.600
if you have anything

46:29.600 --> 46:33.760
tommy talarico's just way too short

46:33.760 --> 46:34.680
uh...

46:34.680 --> 46:35.260
loki

46:35.260 --> 46:39.000
what the hell was that really crappy show that was on that station with that

46:39.000 --> 46:41.040
featured like the MMO skits

46:41.040 --> 46:45.040
and that guy named dave who talked to a computer that didn't really exist

46:45.040 --> 46:46.480
wasn't that uh...

46:46.480 --> 46:46.980
Um...

46:46.980 --> 46:50.320
Portal! God damn portal suck! Never mind, I take it all back!

46:50.320 --> 46:51.140
Portal fucking suck!

46:51.140 --> 46:52.280
No, you know what? You know what?

46:52.280 --> 46:55.280
