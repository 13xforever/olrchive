391	854	Yummy!
6065	15033	We're back here with the Afterbirth, and you know, I think this might be one of the longest shows on the records for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
15053	17916	We're almost already to 9 o'clock, so kind of interesting.
18856	21439	Alright, so we've got a lot of stuff we want to cover here in the Afterbirth.
21479	27324	Let's go ahead and start off with a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, really quickly go around and see what's going on in our personal lives.
27404	29826	Remember, the Afterbirth, this is the portion that is...
30146	30746	DarkSakura.com
48035	49196	And then went to the grocery store.
50396	55379	Other than that, I sprained my wrist last Friday, which I might have mentioned on the show.
56179	59120	Because my cat was being a retard.
59981	65283	And I was leaning over to pet her and balancing myself on the chair as I was getting up.
65884	68165	And she bumped into my leg, knocked me just enough off balance.
68245	69906	And my wrist is a little sore now.
70026	71166	It's actually better.
71446	73307	But I couldn't play anything all week except Ragnarok.
73627	74508	It really got on my nerves.
75568	77670	However, you know, I did play a lot of Ragnarok.
78231	83635	I also, I have homework that I've been putting off all week that I didn't do today.
85416	85897	Good job.
85937	87358	Yeah, I'm really responsible.
88439	89660	So it's going to be turned in late.
91021	92902	And really that's about it.
93103	94163	I've just had a very busy week.
94784	95044	Alright.
95765	96685	Extifer, how was your week?
96725	97106	How was your day?
99015	100436	The week was fine.
102756	107598	I was sick a couple days out of the week, but it's already passed and everything.
108838	116560	I went back to Final Fantasy XI after you guys all went back, and I decided, okay, well, I'll try a different character.
117141	119981	So I'm not a white mage anymore, and I'm not a black mage anymore.
120021	120582	I'm a thief.
121362	122682	So yay, thieves.
123322	123602	Thieves.
123802	124423	Because you know what?
124683	124703	I...
125803	129285	Play a rogue in World of Warcraft and it's pretty much the same thing.
130066	133668	Anyways, and then today I had a good time with my boyfriend.
133788	136190	Actually, I had a really good time with my boyfriend this whole weekend.
137111	138632	And... Yay.
139732	139993	Shut up.
140633	144515	And we went to the video games live on Friday, which was cool.
145516	146477	So, yay, boyfriend.
148698	149379	Loki, how was your week?
149399	151520	How was your day?
151960	153561	My week is okay.
153581	153621	Um...
155714	156674	What did I do this week?
156834	157194	Shit.
158195	161276	Um... Well, no, I don't think I did anything too important.
161676	162636	I did play more Oblivion.
163416	163857	That was fun.
164457	169418	And, um, tomorrow I'm supposed to be going to get a marriage license.
171059	172739	And so I'm actually taking the day off.
173459	174740	And that's only going to take about half an hour.
174760	181042	But I have to drive up to Plasterville and that's like, what, like an hour... No, not an hour away, but like 30 minutes away.
182342	183643	And no one likes going to Plasterville.
183663	184423	It's like, you know...
187790	188070	Hickville
197881	200744	Just, oh, and of course we went down to San Jose and that was fun.
201305	202186	And that was really cool.
202766	212457	And the quasi, now I gotta mention though, when we were at Genji, there's, it is basically your Benihana's type of restaurant.
212537	213177	It's a teppanyaki.
213338	214899	Yeah, where they, you know, cook in front of you.
215260	219945	But they did, Benihana's does this thing where they make like a volcano out of the onions.
220485	226948	Now, Genji took it one step further, that put them on top, as far as the onion section goes, with me.
227509	234352	And that would be that they took the onion, and they made a little volcano, and they poured the water in there, and then it caused the same, ooh, volcano!
234632	241615	Well, then he took, you know, alcohol, poured the alcohol in there, and lit it on fire, and that was freaking sweet.
241916	244357	They do that at another place in town, called Katana.
245397	245938	Well, I don't care.
245958	248779	This is just cool.
250664	256224	Other than that, no, I didn't do too much else.
257014	257975	All right.
258095	260837	My week and my day was okay.
260917	263279	I was still really sick this week with my sinus infection.
263299	267081	It just kind of kept me down for a little while, and I didn't really get to go to the gym at all, which kind of pissed me off.
267121	268122	But I'm better now.
268182	269223	Yesterday was my first day.
269243	272485	It was zero meds, zero anything, so I feel much better now.
272545	273186	Thank you very much.
274447	282973	And otherwise, I've been doing a lot of gaming because, you know, just everything on the 360 and the DS and Final Fantasy and all that stuff, good times.
283373	283513	And...
285254	291781	I guess, Tuesday we already pretty much talked about, that was a great night Put down my DS, Extifer, what are you doing?
293662	294023	No!
295024	295584	What are you playing?
296405	296745	Extifer?
297646	305534	I think Tetris Alright Dork, alright, anyway Great radio
307045	307906	Xtifer's Movie Review
330026	330446	V for Vendetta
347398	352383	And I also want to get the t-shirt that has the snakes and then plus plane equals snakes on a plane.
352403	356206	Okay, when I mentioned snakes on a plane to you, you were like, what is that?
356226	356907	That's stupid.
357668	359049	Well, I still think it's stupid.
359109	360390	I think everybody thinks it's stupid.
360410	360791	That's the point.
360931	362272	It's snakes on a plane.
362452	364054	Yeah, and I want to see it now.
365574	369275	But the movie itself, it was really well done.
369355	378818	It really has a lot of important issues in it that I think kind of pertain to today's current events and everything.
378878	380359	And I think everybody should see it.
380439	383159	I think it's better than The Matrix.
383299	384920	It's from the people who brought out The Matrix.
384980	386840	And I wasn't a big fan of The Matrix.
387481	389701	But I really liked this movie a lot.
389801	391462	I think it's one of the best movies I've seen this year.
392282	393004	So two thumbs up?
393906	395549	Yeah, two big dicks up.
395890	397112	Alright, thank you.
400359	401221	Two snakes up!
403305	403586	Alright.
404938	408582	Let's see, I mentioned there on the Skype line earlier.
408662	410784	Well, first off, we're going to open it back up very soon here.
410824	416651	But on the Skype line earlier, we told one of our callers that we would actually take a look at this live on air.
417252	418634	So I'm going to try and pull this up here.
418714	420436	Let's see if I can locate the file.
420936	421277	It says...
422738	423859	MTV.
423979	424619	Okay, here we go.
424919	426600	So this is that MTV interview.
426640	428821	We haven't done Orange Lounge Radio at the movies in a long time.
429161	432963	So we have this MTV interview with Sketch, who's a DDR player.
433263	438906	Keep in mind, usually when we do Orange Lounge Radio at the movies, we have a chance to watch this clip in advance and kind of prep what we want to say.
439346	440387	But tonight, not the case.
440427	442048	So we're just going to watch this and see how it goes.
442108	442528	So here it is.
442688	443548	Now wait, hold on a minute.
443608	446770	Isn't DDR something that's designed to be played at home?
446790	447310	Kids, I'm gonna warn ya!
447330	447571	I'm stupid.
463123	467667	Okay, well, I'm guessing that he's saying that because this guy is going to do some insane tricks here.
467928	471671	Guys, I apologize for the volume on this video, but the video volume is insanely low.
471711	475054	I have it jacked up as high as it'll go, so you'll just have to deal here for a little bit.
475695	476355	Anyway, let's move on.
476395	478838	Let's see what is so freaking insane about this.
493251	495893	Anyway, moving on.
523103	525705	For most of us, Dance Dance Revolution is something you do for fun.
525885	532069	But for Anthony Carrella here, the New York City DDR champion, quite possibly the best in the world, this is really serious business.
532789	533190	Seriously.
533450	539154	I bet about... No offense to this guy, I don't know him, but I bet there's about 50 people on the internet waiting to dispute this claim.
539934	542476	And you know that there's people jealous that this guy got TV time.
542836	543457	Well, you know what?
543577	549025	It's not like, you know, MTV doing actual research on something.
551149	552330	I'm not going to doubt this guy's good.
552350	556437	I'm just going to say there are going to be 50 people lined up wanting to dispute that claim.
556537	557178	That's all I'm saying.
561744	563527	I just started playing about four years ago.
565190	568416	I found solace in the game because I had a breakup with my girlfriend.
568757	570500	And it's addicting, man.
570520	571321	I can't stop playing.
571341	572463	I just love playing it.
573086	573966	Okay, I'm sorry, that's lame.
575327	576147	Not his reasoning.
576687	579288	They made him play DDR while he's being interviewed.
579368	581329	That is the ultimate in cheeseball.
581389	581769	I'm sorry.
581789	582589	That's really stupid.
582909	587231	Whoever attributed MTV with doing anything really intelligent, other than remote control.
587351	592052	Sometimes me and my friends would wake up at 9 o'clock, go down to Coney Island, play all day.
592512	594373	Go home at 8 o'clock, wake up, do it again.
594413	595333	We would do it for about a week.
595533	601055	It usually runs me, not even a lot, about 20 to 40 bucks every time I go to the arcade.
602625	606248	Which, by the way, you'll notice this guy is one of the skinniest people I've ever seen in my life.
606308	607949	And that's why, right there.
609430	610752	Look at that, he is skinny.
611232	611872	Very, very skinny.
613894	619719	From about 2003 to 2004, I was undefeated in all New York City fair options tournaments.
621660	623041	Yeah, that's because you're on the East Coast.
623962	624723	Oh, burn.
626209	626810	I'm just teasing.
627090	628713	Here comes all the hate mail from the East Coast.
628733	630256	This guy, you asshole.
630476	631097	I'm teasing.
631257	631758	It's a joke.
631918	632759	I'm just starting shit.
634284	640909	I take pride in saying that I'm one of the few people, if not the only person in the world, that could stealth every hard 10-footer in the game backwards.
641089	643350	Meaning I could do it without looking or I could turn the arrows on.
643510	644351	Well, let me put it this way.
644391	647533	If you can stealth it going forward, you can stealth it backwards.
647653	649875	Sorry, I restarted the video.
650455	651556	No, sorry.
651996	653717	And it's addicting, man.
653737	654538	I can't stop playing.
655639	657680	Sorry, you gotta hear some of it over again because I fucked up.
657700	658861	Sometimes me and my friends would...
659281	679939	Wake up at 9 o'clock, go down to Coney Island Fuck that dude, I used to wake up or not wake up I used to go after midnight, go down to CCL and play until 3 in the morning That is pretty hardcore Okay, here comes the stealth line again From about 2003 to 2004, I was undefeated in all New York City fair options tournaments
682423	689047	I take pride in saying that I'm one of the few people, if not the only person in the world, that could stealth every hard 10-footer in the game, backwards.
689247	691489	Meaning I could do it without looking, or I could turn the arrows on.
694170	696372	That just takes some insane memorization.
696432	701035	I mean, you really do have to play the game a lot to know those songs, you know, like the back of your hand.
701355	703556	It's active repetition.
703576	707719	Didn't you say you played so much Love on DDR2 that you could do the same thing?
707819	707959	Yeah.
707979	710341	I used to be able to do that, Diamond Rage.
711942	712563	Dynamite Rave
728089	732310	I'm sorry, I don't know this whole thing, what it's all about, because I've been playing Tetris.
732610	741713	But I just heard him say that and everything, and I'm like, it takes somebody so arrogant and so full of themselves to say that I'm the only person in the world who can do this.
742333	743553	Because I'm pretty sure he's not.
744214	747114	To this guy's credit, though, MTV's probably coaxing this out of him.
747314	747855	You know what I mean?
748015	752756	I know what these interview people can be sometimes, and he's probably... I don't know.
752816	755897	I don't know this guy, so I'm not going to assume anything.
759375	761496	If I work out, I'm not working out to get fit.
761516	764118	I'm working out to see if I could get a better score on a song.
764298	765279	I'm not listening to music.
765319	768161	I'm thinking of ways that I could get better and do things better.
768181	771103	All right, dude.
771203	774845	So you have a huge tournament coming up, the huge championship, right?
775226	777367	You can't train 24 hours a day in an arcade.
777387	777887	So what do you do?
777927	778748	How are you prepping at home?
782964	784424	I got the pad at home.
784525	785625	I'm playing on the pad.
785645	787946	I also have these step charts that I'm looking at.
788086	792867	They're step charts of the hardest songs in the games, cheat sheets if you want to call them.
793027	797949	I'm looking at those patterns and I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to use on people, what I'm not going to use on people.
797969	799349	I'm trying to get my confidence up.
800049	801930	It's not only a physical thing, it's a mental thing.
802070	803250	You think you're going to win this tournament?
803731	804091	I'm winning.
804411	807892	It's not even a question of whether I think I'm going to win or not, I'm winning.
809707	811349	Let me explain to you who these people are.
811589	814372	This is New York's finest, DDPD.
814552	816514	What I'm focused on most is tech, expert.
816675	817576	You ready, Sketch?
818477	818757	I'm ready.
818777	818997	Let's go.
819017	819778	Let's do it.
819818	821400	It's going to be very competitive.
821780	823722	A lot of the best players from the country are in it.
824283	825344	This is the $2,000.
825584	827587	Here we go.
830174	832396	I have the speed mile record for New York City.
832456	837742	I was the first person to get the highest score in the hardest only course in the game, Legend Row, which is a marathon course.
837922	839524	I've cleared over a thousand beats per minute.
839924	841065	I would rank myself up there.
841085	842026	I would rank myself the best.
842146	846210	Me, me, me, me, I, I, I, I. A thousand beats a minute?
846671	847632	Uh, what?
848891	850212	I think he's talking about the arrow scroll speed.
850812	852474	I know, but... Yeah, I know, I know.
853594	856216	Not to sound cocky, but I work hard for it.
856597	861480	Not to sound cocky or anything, but... Did I mention how awesome I am?
865483	866384	We had it taken off.
867304	867805	Hold on, hold on.
868465	869926	Extifer, hold on.
870046	870927	Let's reaffirm something here.
871968	874970	How much about this whole DDR and the culture and everything do you know about?
875919	877340	I don't know that much actually.
898587	900648	My adrenaline is through the roof right now.
900849	902129	Best feeling I've ever had in my life.
902490	908233	Me and my friends are probably going to go and celebrate and this is going to hang in my house and that's how it's going to be.
909474	911975	Yes, you're going to hang the trophy in your house.
912136	914417	It looks like the same type of trophy they give you for Little League.
915333	915653	All right.
918215	920596	Here's some comments from our chat room right now.
920656	921037	Let's see.
921997	925720	Jaded2006 says, LOL, I can do max 300 stealth.
926360	926860	Let's see.
927301	929942	Popanda21, I'm the only person in the world that's perfect.
933044	933545	Let's see.
934645	935466	Sextastical.
935566	935986	Let's see.
936546	937047	Where's the one?
937127	941730	Somebody said something about... Oh, Illusion says, I could clean out my vagina with this guy.
944888	949711	Zaku says, oh, Zaku says, fuck you, man, try doing a ten-footer with six options, Extifer.
951071	952072	Ooh, burn.
952772	953592	He just threw down.
955473	956794	I don't fucking care.
956814	961056	Oh, wait, did I cause controversy?
961156	961816	It's okay.
961837	964218	Why don't you masturbate or something?
964238	964418	It's okay.
964438	970661	If they had, like, someone else in the tournament and he came in, like, third or second or something like that and how this interview would end.
971897	975440	You know, I still don't think he's as cool as the guy who did DDR on crutches.
976421	976821	Alright.
977081	977782	The guy with one leg.
979783	981224	Alright, you asked, we did.
981304	986788	We went ahead and talked about the video on the show.
986849	990591	I don't know if that's... For the record, I still think it's cheating.
992173	994614	I don't know if that's the response you wanted, buddy, but sorry.
994634	995675	We call him as we see him.
995895	998477	I might add, his soft pad that he had at home is...
999557	1003039	Red Octane, you know, Wannabe Pad.
1003719	1004379	They look like crap.
1004679	1005580	Skypline's open.
1006000	1006901	Anybody want to call?
1009682	1011803	Let's just see who gets on there first.
1018566	1022668	I'm trying to wait for our British guy to call back because I promised we could get him on.
1023969	1026490	I'm kind of secretly hoping Zach will call back too.
1027540	1034924	Hey Rob, I'm so awesome, I can pass every song, and I'm perfect.
1034944	1036545	Shut up, we got a call back.
1036585	1038406	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
1039307	1039927	Simmel again.
1040067	1041108	Hi Simmel, how you doing?
1041128	1042108	Oh, no video this time.
1042148	1042509	That's alright.
1042849	1043669	How you doing, Simmel?
1044770	1046071	Yeah, that should sort it out now.
1046531	1047532	Alright, what's on your mind, buddy?
1048812	1050273	Just about the DDR Dancer.
1050493	1050773	Uh-huh.
1052615	1053055	What about him?
1054836	1056857	Basically, just one thing.
1061205	1067466	When he's actually dancing and everything, why doesn't he just spend the $40 a day or whatever he's doing to buy a machine for home?
1068966	1069687	I don't know.
1069707	1070387	That's a good question.
1071687	1075488	Well, you know, it's one of those impulse buy things.
1075808	1076368	It's harder.
1076968	1083989	We could probably say the same thing about we pay $30 a month to do this radio show and at that rate we could have bought our own server by now.
1084049	1084570	You know what I mean?
1084790	1085630	I can't really talk.
1085650	1085950	I did.
1086630	1087691	You built your own machine.
1088332	1095980	There's a difference between going out and spending $3,000 on a machine and spending... How much did you spend on yours?
1096000	1095980	$3,000.
1096060	1099103	That was the exact same conclusion I came to.
1099123	1103407	I was like, you know, I'm tired of playing an arcade where all the machines are broken, so I'm going to build my own.
1103627	1104308	And I did.
1104775	1111724	He doesn't get the recognition that he would get if he's playing it in front of people, so I think it's an arrogance thing, actually.
1112124	1113226	It's an ego thing.
1114087	1116109	He wants people around him to feed his ego.
1116129	1120815	I mean, that's obvious that the way he was talking himself up, that he needed ego fodder.
1120835	1121376	You know what?
1121416	1123298	I'm taking this with a grain of salt, because I think...
1124059	1127221	I think the MTV guys might have embellished it a little bit.
1127241	1129762	Those words came out of his mouth.
1130022	1136445	That is true, but I know the power of editing and I think there could be something interesting going on here.
1136525	1138707	Anyway, what else is on your mind, Simmel?
1140107	1141228	That's pretty much about it, really.
1141508	1144430	Okay, well thank you so much for calling back and I'm sorry I didn't work out on the show earlier.
1145590	1146090	That's okay.
1146170	1147091	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
1147791	1148252	Thanks a lot.
1148392	1149012	Alright, bye-bye.
1149252	1150373	Bye.
1150393	1151393	And get some sleep soon.
1152654	1152994	Alright.
1154145	1154986	Oh, did I hang up on him?
1157069	1157469	Oh, whoop.
1158090	1159011	I hung up on somebody else.
1159071	1159371	Sorry.
1159872	1160392	Alright, there we go.
1161133	1162074	Let's go to this call.
1162635	1163736	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
1164608	1165569	Yeah, it's me.
1166590	1169013	Yeah, I guess it was a bad idea after all.
1169754	1170655	I mean, it's alright.
1170715	1173878	I mean, I can understand the criticism, but that's okay.
1173898	1177142	I mean, you pretty much called it as you see it.
1177462	1181266	Okay, play devil's advocate for me, Zaku, because have you met this guy being on the East Coast?
1181346	1182507	Yes, I've met this guy.
1182567	1185090	I've hung out with this guy on several occasions.
1185150	1186412	Was this a fair assessment of him?
1187325	1195869	Um, he's pretty much, I mean, if you get to know him, he doesn't sound very, he doesn't sound as arrogant as, you know, he doesn't sound, you know, he doesn't sound arrogant at all.
1195989	1198070	You really know how awesome I am.
1198110	1199051	He's very humble.
1199171	1205674	It's just that, you know, when he gets the opportunity for these types of things, he tries to market himself.
1206354	1210236	But, you know, as I said, once you get to know him, he's pretty much very humble.
1210296	1216639	He just hates, you know, he doesn't care about what other people says because he doesn't feed into that negativity.
1216759	1219101	But he knows how to strut his stuff on the catwalk, right?
1219301	1223303	Yeah, because pretty much he put foot to ass to his skills.
1223443	1224023	Put it that way.
1224383	1226464	He didn't just magically get them.
1226484	1228065	It was a long way up there.
1228586	1229446	I can respect that.
1229646	1232928	Four to five years of hard work trying to get up to that level.
1233648	1235349	And you don't do that by showing off.
1235409	1236749	You earn people's respect.
1237450	1239671	You know, this guy doesn't win all the time.
1239751	1244052	I mean, you know, when he loses, he learns from his mistakes to get better.
1244713	1249915	And, you know, honestly, people like him are a prime example of what a DDR player should be.
1252156	1253916	I totally disagree with that.
1254617	1257698	Well, the best DDR player in the world can be complete jackasses.
1257898	1259059	That's what we're looking for.
1259099	1259159	No.
1261880	1264783	I didn't mean being an asshole or anything.
1264823	1269387	I just meant as someone who wouldn't blatantly show off.
1269407	1270528	Someone who's very humble.
1271829	1274351	I'm sure his dancing backwards and everything.
1274832	1277714	If he were truly that humble, he wouldn't be such a braggart.
1278995	1281858	And if you meet him in real life, he can prove that to you.
1282679	1288184	But the thing is that he's making himself sound like he wins all the time, and you yourself said that he did not.
1288224	1289525	It depends.
1289925	1291026	He's one of the best.
1292207	1295010	But he himself was saying he was the best.
1296107	1298447	Believe me, there are other people that are up to his level.
1298968	1300348	And I'm from New York, I would know.
1301648	1307589	To Zachary, to be fair though, he did say in that video that he was bragging about being the best.
1308310	1317271	But I'm trying to give this guy a break because I understand that kind of energy that having an MTV person in your house can kind of give you.
1317291	1319312	You don't get that sort of thing.
1319432	1321112	You're going to make yourself sound like the shit.
1321212	1321992	I understand that.
1322032	1323653	What happened to the Asian people?
1323693	1324793	Weren't they the best at it?
1325413	1328057	I honestly would like to see that guy versus Tigger.
1344145	1349830	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1361059	1365023	and if willing, you probably will get the chance to interview him.
1365504	1366124	Can't wait.
1366705	1367366	Can't wait.
1368166	1368947	Can't wait to meet him.
1369188	1370489	Alright, Zaku, have a good one.
1371190	1371810	Alright, later.
1372271	1374413	We wanted to give you a fair counterpoint here on the program.
1374884	1381890	All right, I know some of you guys are trying to get in, but we're way past the three hours of our lives that we set aside for this program.
1381910	1383030	So we're going to try and get back into it.
1383070	1384131	We want to do the cage match.
1384692	1389756	Maybe we'll open up Skype a little later because I saw some people calling in that weren't trying to call during the live show.
1389796	1391837	So I want to see if I can maybe get a couple of them.
1392037	1393399	Yeah, I got to make a song.
1394318	1395699	Yeah, when are you going to make your stinking song?
1395899	1397080	I was working on it.
1397540	1400922	I have a really bad thing with writer's block right now.
1402263	1403504	I've been trying to get past it.
1403744	1407047	I've been taking breaks from stuff and going back to it.
1408047	1409108	It's just not working.
1410389	1413151	So my thing is now is I'm going to make a song.
1413271	1414552	I don't care how crappy it is.
1415132	1423938	I'll submit it because I've got to do something so I can at least listen to the other songs so I can play them on show.
1426121	1429403	Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match
1445441	1447141	Three songs go into the cage match.
1447602	1449742	One from each co-host here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1449762	1458184	You guys vote for your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-7 Lamontian video game music program.
1458344	1460885	And let's start off with a clip of last week's winner.
1460945	1463186	It was my pick, because I'm special.
1463266	1463966	Okay, not really.
1464406	1465586	But you guys did vote for it.
1465666	1470348	It's Deep Dish with a song named after the town where Orange Lounge Radio broadcasts from.
1470728	1471688	West Coast, yo.
1471728	1473589	It's Deep Dish with Sacramento.
1473689	1474829	Song number one tonight's cage match.
1529050	1531173	My losing hand Don't understand
1551664	1554406	All right, that was song number one in our cage match, Deep Dish with Sacramento.
1554446	1558029	Let's get into song number two, which comes to us courtesy of Loki.
1558089	1559150	Loki, what'd you pick for us tonight?
1559631	1563214	I picked the song by, God, I don't remember who it's... Oh, by Quarter.
1563354	1570920	He's the guy that did some stuff on diverse systems, and I want to say he might even be working on stuff now.
1571240	1575924	There's a lot of those diverse system artists that crossed over to DJ Maxx and...
1577285	1577786	Ota Jam.
1578166	1581911	So he might be on one of the... on DJ Max, but I can't remember.
1582212	1591624	Anyways, this song's called Grand Parade, and I completely picked it out of random, so... Alright, we'll see if random picks are successful for Loki.
1591664	1592745	Here's song number two tonight.
1593066	1594928	Quarter with Grand Parade.
1594988	1595229	Enjoy.
1705743	1707306	Thank you for watching!
1969318	1975702	I give the fact that it finally ended a 10.
1975742	1976922	Other than that, I give it a 3.
1976962	1981325	It was very repetitive, very boring, very... Is it ever over yet?
1981365	1981565	Loki,
2000148	2000528	I give it a 5.
2000848	2003270	I actually stopped listening to it after a while.
2005271	2010333	I also give that song a 5 because that song reminds me of something from 2DX 5th style.
2010633	2015236	Like a very generic 2DX song spread out across about 25 minutes.
2016736	2017817	Xtofer, you want to rate that song?
2020058	2022379	I don't remember it.
2024500	2025041	So I give it a 0.
2027281	2031804	All right, kids, DarkSakura has a chance to redeem, I guess, a little bit here.
2031864	2033625	Wow, we all panned that one.
2033665	2035387	DarkSakura, what do you think of song three?
2035527	2036007	What's coming up?
2036207	2039149	This is a group, I believe they're from the Bay Area, called Babyland.
2040310	2045914	They are sort of a synth-industrial pop punk.
2046735	2047755	They do some of everything.
2047795	2051478	Like, their drum kit is like metal tubs and pipes.
2052178	2053219	They're really amazing.
2053239	2055461	The song is called Jerry, I think is how it's pronounced.
2055521	2055661	Yep.
2057202	2060484	And actually there's a video for this that's up on their website too, but they're just fantastic.
2060504	2062966	I'm going to see them in Berkeley on the 15th next month.
2063206	2064067	So it's an indie band.
2064347	2064588	Indie.
2064828	2066989	Oh yeah, I go indie as often as I can.
2067129	2069091	Alright, here it is, song number three, Babyland.
2069271	2069992	Jerry, enjoy.
2210624	2211809	Don't tell me I'm
2334005	2343550	All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
2343590	2344851	Babyland with Jerry.
2344891	2346552	Let's go around and see what the folks thought of that.
2346612	2347273	DarkSakura.
2347833	2349334	Ten, and I'm going to see them next month.
2349354	2349974	That rocks.
2351055	2351395	Loki.
2352016	2353557	Eh, I don't know.
2353717	2354037	Seven.
2354777	2354917	Okay.
2354957	2355097	Extifer.
2355398	2355778	Extifer.
2359124	2360025	I haven't been paying attention.
2360706	2362028	No, no, no, it was good.
2362088	2362609	I liked it.
2363090	2364111	It was better than the last one.
2364131	2364512	Seven.
2367842	2369603	Oh, I like the music.
2369663	2375268	It kind of sounds like the Postal Service, but like, I don't know, like a little more hardcore, which is pretty cool.
2376188	2378450	The vocalist was a little screamy for me, though.
2378830	2380151	I don't like the screamy guys.
2380171	2382033	I don't know.
2382093	2382633	Not my thing.
2383634	2384335	But I like the music.
2384355	2385315	I thought musically it was good.
2385415	2387797	So I give the music a nine.
2387857	2389959	I give the singing a little less.
2390019	2392681	So I think I'll give it a seven and a half overall.
2393775	2397336	Alright, so let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.
2397456	2401457	Here we go, starting off with song number one, Deep Dish with Sacramento.
2403198	2409239	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Quarter with Grand Parade.
2420680	2421841	Imagine that for about five minutes.
2421881	2424583	Song number three is Babyland with Jerry.
2424763	2425344	Sorry, Loki.
2433731	2434552	All right, guys.
2434792	2436974	Place vote now.
2437074	2444280	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and we shall reveal the winner a little later in the program.
2445848	2447169	Well, damn, we're running really late tonight.
2447189	2448569	We've been on air for three and a half hours now.
2448589	2449089	Can you believe that?
2449490	2449870	I know.
2449910	2452051	It's like the old days when we did the podcast after.
2452151	2453932	I know, but we just had a lot to say tonight.
2454092	2454872	Pretty crazy, I guess.
2454912	2456713	We're some chatty, chatty people.
2456773	2457073	That's right.
2457113	2458454	Loki, what the hell are you doing online over there?
2458474	2459874	I see you doing something game-related.
2459914	2461555	I can't see what she's doing, but I can see what you're doing.
2462075	2465956	I'm just looking up the achievements for Ridge Racer 6.
2466516	2467176	They're hard.
2467377	2468537	I can't remember where they are.
2468557	2475899	You know most games give you one really easy achievement, like power on the game and kill one monster and you get five points.
2476699	2477919	Ridge Racer don't give you any of that.
2478159	2480020	You have to like 360 and you get five points.
2480400	2485526	I can't even... I thought I did a 360, but I guess that's just my car spinning around a lot because I hit a wall.
2485926	2488149	I finally broke the barrier in Ridge Racer.
2488189	2490111	I was able to beat the first race, finally.
2490592	2493915	And then, like, after beating the first race, I was able to clear, like, ten races.
2494256	2494916	Like, really easy.
2495297	2496338	So, I don't know.
2496378	2498841	I finally got over my Ridge Racer handicap, I guess.
2499537	2502478	What is that about Splinter Cell or Ghost Recon?
2502498	2503798	It says it only has 925 achievement points.
2503818	2504198	I thought it had 1,000.
2504238	2505318	No, every game has 1,000 except that one for some reason.
2505338	2505698	That has 925.
2505758	2506279	I don't know why.
2506319	2507479	You got robbed to 75 points somewhere.
2507519	2507679	Stupid.
2507699	2509459	So I have 1,340 out of 14,625 based on what I own.
2525325	2527666	And you have a perfect 1000 in full auto now, huh?
2527686	2529566	Yeah, I have the full autos finished.
2530127	2531667	50 out of 50 for that.
2531727	2532167	Good job.
2532327	2540910	But, like, there's games I bought, you know, now, at the time at launch, you know, I thought, oh, those are going to be really cool games, you know, like Perfect Dark Zero.
2542651	2545152	And I haven't played, I've played that twice.
2546252	2547673	I couldn't get into Perfect Dark Zero.
2547753	2549853	I understand where people are, like, totally loving this game.
2550034	2550494	I couldn't do it.
2550514	2551094	I liked the club...
2552466	2554827	I liked the club level in that game.
2554927	2557528	That really was the most fun level to me.
2557948	2559789	But I can't play it because I get motion sick.
2561650	2563251	I play mostly the arcade games.
2563291	2565812	Most of my achievements are little 200-pointer games.
2566432	2568193	Well, I have a lot of the arcade games.
2568933	2570274	Here's the ones I've got to play through.
2570814	2572875	I'm planning on selling some of this stuff back.
2573275	2578077	Full auto, I'm debating whether I want to sell it back because I do like the game, but I'm kind of done with it.
2578297	2579018	There really isn't...
2580038	2587443	Multiplayer-wise, it's only two-player and there's not really any good deathmatch type stuff for it.
2588023	2591805	So, I'm thinking I'm probably just going to sell that one back.
2593927	2600011	But the other games I want to blaster real quick, The Outfit, I need to go through that real quick because it's a cool game, but...
2601738	2603899	I don't know, I just haven't really played it online.
2605840	2614185	Call of Duty 2, I'm kind of getting tired of that game, so I need to finish the whole game on, I guess, Veteran, which should be freaking hard.
2614765	2618607	And Ghost Recon, eh, I just need to play that more.
2618727	2620308	It'll be, I think, a lot more fun.
2621329	2626491	I don't know, Need for Speed Most Wanted, that game looked kind of lame, so I just have to go through that.
2627032	2631034	And then I need the Barrier Cameo, because I started achieving points on that, and I sold mine back.
2631874	2632475	Yeah, you can borrow that.
2632695	2635237	I want to play Burnout, so we'll make a little trade or something.
2635257	2636418	Maybe Amp 3 or something.
2636438	2638861	Well, I'm on rank.
2639021	2640582	Wait, do you have Amp 3 with you?
2640883	2642144	I had Amp 3.
2642364	2642705	Damn you.
2642925	2643145	Why?
2643525	2645287	I need to play more games.
2645307	2648050	I sold it back, but I'm going to probably buy it again.
2648230	2648550	Okay.
2648730	2653775	Because it actually, for those who might not know that out there, it dropped in price to $39.99.
2654236	2654936	Oh, that's cool.
2654996	2656438	So if you can find it,
2657691	2658832	Thanks for watching!
2674878	2675759	Yeah, sure.
2676439	2677400	It's a cool game.
2677440	2678440	Something you're not playing a lot of.
2678460	2678980	It's a cool game.
2679021	2682022	I just haven't really gotten into it yet.
2682202	2682483	Okay.
2683083	2683443	That'd be cool.
2683803	2684084	Sweet.
2684524	2686065	Because I want to get some more achievement points, too.
2686085	2688866	I feel like achievement point whoring it up a little bit.
2688906	2690307	I swear to God, that shit is crack.
2690788	2691008	Is it?
2691108	2693029	It gets me to buy games I wouldn't normally buy.
2693069	2695891	See, that's Microsoft's got you by the balls.
2696491	2696751	Alright.
2698552	2701834	To be honest, I do buy games just for this show to talk about them.
2702194	2702654	You know what?
2702755	2704175	I find that to be my weakness too.
2704215	2705156	In fact, I was just commenting.
2705476	2711639	We were in Fry's the other day and I was just commenting to somebody that like, oh my god, I started buying a lot more games when we started doing this program.
2712160	2712780	It's bad.
2713821	2715522	Just to give me more to talk about on the program.
2715822	2717903	We need to get gaming companies to send them to us for free.
2717963	2720124	I think that should be our mission at E3 this year.
2720324	2721325	I'm selling them at work.
2721505	2723346	We're supposed to be getting them sent to us, but...
2724066	2727507	I'm sorry if I offended anybody tonight.
2727547	2732529	I just thought I would be a little bit gentleman-like and say that.
2734469	2735009	Extend my apologies.
2749136	2750817	Babyland Tower to the indie band
2777938	2780719	Alright, with the screaming guy.
2782039	2787701	Okay, a lot of their other stuff is a lot more industrial sounding, you know, so his screaming does fit.
2787741	2791222	But that one, I actually thought that you would like that one for the synth poppy.
2791522	2792263	I do, I like the music.
2792283	2792903	I love the music.
2792923	2794403	The guy's voice is a little wacky.
2794443	2797284	They have a MySpace up that's got more of their stuff on there.
2797524	2798005	I'll check it out.
2798025	2798565	Speaking of MySpace...
2799485	2801406	Speaking of Myspace, we're on Myspace.
2801707	2802167	Yes, we are.
2802187	2802787	We love Myspace.
2803127	2803448	Get this.
2803768	2804989	Echo Image has a Myspace.
2805129	2807490	The singer from Echo Image freaking commented on my Myspace.
2807550	2810032	That made me such a screaming little girl earlier this week.
2810472	2811793	I mean, seriously, that's so cool.
2812093	2812614	So check that.
2812694	2813755	Echo Image is on Myspace.
2814455	2815476	Zoic is on Myspace as well.
2815496	2817097	I'm trying to think of other DDR bands I saw on there.
2817597	2817877	I don't know.
2817897	2819058	But Orange Lounge Radio is on there too.
2819598	2819919	It's what?
2820079	2822120	Myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, I think.
2822400	2823841	And there's clips of our show.
2823881	2826483	And I'll probably put the Chocobo clip up from tonight because that was pretty funny.
2826503	2829225	We'll link the Myspace in our LiveJournal community.
2830085	2832407	I think we posted there before, but we need more people to join.
2832547	2833508	We only have 50 friends.
2833548	2834929	I know there's more than that listening to the show.
2835249	2837871	We're being total MySpace whores now, but we will not spam.
2838652	2839512	We might leave comments.
2839552	2843815	I have to say that 50 in the first couple of weeks of being up is not bad at all.
2844115	2846137	We might leave comments that says thank you.
2846397	2850640	We have to come up with some funny MySpace pictures, so maybe we'll work on that this week and leave you guys some comments.
2850900	2855543	But we will not send random messages to people saying, hey, you're a fan of such and such.
2855583	2856704	You should listen to Orange Lingerie.
2856764	2857445	No, I hate that shit.
2857845	2858746	I always report that stuff.
2859006	2860288	I always flag it for spam abuse.
2861449	2864331	We might comment on your MySpaces, though.
2864371	2866514	If you don't like us commenting on your MySpace, you can delete it.
2866534	2867174	We won't be offended.
2867495	2868115	But we're going to comment.
2868796	2870958	I think that's it.
2871038	2876063	I know we have chatroom FUs to do, too, but honestly, I kind of want to just wrap it up.
2879099	2880980	Yeah, I need to go.
2881020	2881841	Yeah, one more thing.
2882081	2885643	Sorry, chat room, but we know you're angsty too, but we'll just have to get that in another time.
2886124	2888545	So just yell them out real quick in the chat room.
2889766	2893228	Do an FU post on our LiveJournal community.
2893309	2893729	There you go.
2894269	2896250	All right, that's going to do it for now, though.
2896331	2897131	Oh, I need to check.
2897651	2901754	During the cage match, I actually ran out and took a picture of my Xbox with the Mario background.
2901774	2904796	I'm going to try and upload that to the forums if the picture finally posted here.
2904836	2907258	So look for that on our forums a little later.
2909119	2909680	I'm sleepy That's light!
2922974	2924395	I'm gonna go home and play Ragnar Crack online.
2924415	2926056	No, because I've eaten plenty of food today.
2926116	2928178	I had a piece of cheesecake for freakin' breakfast.
2928198	2929999	No, it was six-carp cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory.
2930039	2930660	That stuff is crack.
2947472	2947912	DarkSakura
2975686	2978128	My final thought is streaming media.
2978408	2989278	Loki, how am I going to fit in playing games, making music, have to work on a webpage, have to work on the other webpage, and life?
2991439	2992400	Well, thank you for that downer.
2992480	2994242	Extifer, your final thought.
2996075	2996495	Who is this superhero?
2996515	2996675	Sarge?
2996715	2996775	No.
2996835	2998436	Rosemary, the telephone operator?
2998456	2998496	No.
2998516	2999277	Henry, mild-mannered janitor?
2999317	2999597	Could be!

3070332	3074497	Have a great week and that's it.

3079302	3080644	Alright, have a good one.
