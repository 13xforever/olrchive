14184	25289	Tonight, March 26th, 2006, we cover the highlights of the Game Developers Conference, World of Warcraft teaches us a lesson on business, and Congress gets 20,000 messages from video gamers.
32492	38614	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
38674	39314	It is March 26, 2006.
40014	47936	This is episode number 178 and thanks so much for tuning in live or downloading us, whatever the case may be.
48456	49376	My name is Rob Roberts.
49396	50396	You might know me as Sky.
50456	54037	Joining me as always, say hello to the lovely DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
55398	56618	Oh, I think the mic is off, dear.
57509	58129	TechMasterLoki
84864	85585	GameDevelopersConference.com
111872	117674	It's like we got to be in the same city and we were near people that were going to Game Developers Conference, although we didn't actually get to go ourselves.
118494	125076	So we didn't get to go to no blogger's breakfast, so we had to make our own, you know, cool kids... Podcaster's dinner.
125096	127497	Yeah, cool kids dinner or something like that.
127537	127857	I don't know.
128377	129677	That place was pretty tasty.
130177	131878	It was a good place, wherever that was that we went.
131898	133979	The little, like, it's not Benihana.
133999	134759	Semi-Hana.
134919	135739	Yeah, Semi-Hana.
136439	137160	It was Genji.
137300	138040	It was a good place.
138160	138380	Yeah.
138820	140681	DarkSakura, what kind of games have you been into?
164088	165609	Well, I haven't been able to do a lot of gaming.
166190	174074	I sprained my wrist last Friday, so I've been kind of not able to use the D-pad very well until a couple days ago.
174194	180417	We picked up Tetris DS, and I haven't actually got to play it yet because I can't get it away from Dan.
181578	183179	Which must mean it's pretty good.
183479	186301	I haven't played any Animal Crossing at all this week.
186561	187121	Congratulations.
187141	190223	I've been playing lots of Ragnarok Online because I can use my mouse.
191207	198591	I am now level 52-38, Thief, and then I have like an Archer, and I have a Merchant that I've started too.
199432	204855	And Dan also picked up the initial D game for PSP, which comes with a lanyard, it was pretty cool.
205555	208697	I heard lots of Eurobeat pouring out of the living room as I left the house today.
209597	214800	So that's what the game, oh and he's been playing a lot of Burnout, which I'm like, whatever.
214820	217822	That game does not interest me in the least.
219003	219283	Why not?
219929	220689	It looks stupid.
221030	223931	It's about, what, the sixth racing game to come out for Xbox 360?
224031	226933	I get tired of there being nothing but racing games in my house.
227934	234758	You know, it may be fun for people, but it looks like more of the same crap he's been playing for, like, the past three months, and I'm sick of it.
235058	248706	That's because they're most of the racing, well, actually, it's what, EA, Need for Speed Most Wanted, and Burnout look exactly the same, or pretty close at least, because, you know, they're both ports of the Xbox version, with
249161	254905	Project Gotham, Full Auto, Ridge Racer, Need for Speed I bought me my Katamari
278934	279975	And that's pretty fun.
280315	282716	It looks really pretty on the PSP, that's for sure.
283297	284437	It doesn't control too well.
286358	293943	I don't really like how they do the directional pad and the four buttons instead of two analogs, but what are you going to do with the PSP?
294903	301607	But it is very pretty, and if you do play it for a while, you do eventually get used to the controls, although they do make your hand hurt a bit.
303136	330787	then of course I played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories as usual and also I've been playing on the 360 finally got all my achievements unlocked in full auto today and also I played a little bit of Oblivion and that game is just huge and it's very pretty but just really huge like today I was like you know I see a mountain over there
331328	332648	I'm going to go walk that direction.
332968	335109	And sure enough, you can pretty much climb to the top of that mountain.
335769	342971	And meanwhile, I was sneaking around through the dark and I see deer, so I throw fireballs and kill the deer because I can.
343692	352334	And other fun things like I pickpocketed a key from this one guy in town and went to his house, stole all this stuff and dumped it on the street because I can.
353963	355304	I'm a jackass in the game.
378220	379861	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
409430	417615	It's cool, I'm not going to knock the game for having that, but I was a little bit taken aback, because I'm like, okay, I'm just starting this game, and already I feel really overwhelmed.
417955	420897	And of course, Loki was showing it to me, and he's telling me everything to do.
420977	422318	Okay, press this button, press this button.
422558	424659	Okay, press this, then this, then this, and this, and this.
424679	427081	I'm like, oh my gosh, this is overwhelming.
427341	431504	But then I thought about when I played Final Fantasy XI for the first time, I kind of felt the same way.
431544	433365	So I know it's just one of those games you have to get used to.
433485	435546	It's not that hard once you get through it, no.
435973	444615	So anyways, of course, you know, there was a little leak out there about how there's a glitch with one character where you can kill him and, you know, get infinite gold.
445135	448776	Well, I went and tried to kill this guy, and goddammit, he keeps raining away.
449016	450317	I can't kill him fast enough.
450717	453297	Even if I sneak up on him, I just, I can't do it.
454077	464060	Which is surprising, because you'd think if you hit somebody with a double-edged, you know, a two-handed sword really hard in the back when they weren't expecting it, you'd think, yeah, they're probably going to be on the ground, you know.
464540	469362	But damn, I can whack away at this guy and he freaking puts up a fight and then runs away like a coward.
469402	470682	It's like, holy shit.
470702	472763	I mean, if I was getting hit with a sword, they would be down.
473663	473963	Whatever.
474183	476944	Anyways, but yeah, tons of stuff to do in this game.
477344	479205	I don't even know.
480125	480846	It's a long game.
481046	482026	Very, very long.
483707	486748	I played the, what was it, Blazing Angels demo.
486968	487508	That was fun.
488068	490969	I especially loved taking off and then turning back around and
491539	493781	Shooting the people that were on the ground in my headquarters.
493841	494342	That was fun.
495403	496223	Didn't like it too much.
496283	499186	Kept crashing in the buildings, though, because I suck at Flight Sims.
500427	502949	And... God, what else did I play?
504771	507193	Some more... What was it?
509015	509696	Geometry Wars.
510837	511437	That's kind of cool.
513019	513359	Very cool.
513919	522647	You know, if Oblivion had came out when it was first originally supposed to be out, like not quite as a launch title, but what, like end of December was the original time frame for the game, right?
523348	534439	I think I would have had a chance to play it, but now it's kind of like, okay, in my imaginary game queue in my head of the games I want to play and in the order I want to play them, unfortunately Oblivion's kind of like...
535165	535785	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
552150	563035	Well, yeah, I mean, to make the game better, I mean, fine, but, you know, it's just too bad that it didn't happen when it was originally supposed to, because I probably would have wanted to play it more, but honestly, there's only so many hours in a day, so...
575785	577506	Imagine running for, like, hours and hours.
577986	578707	No, not fun.
578807	582269	But you can do, like, quick travel and stuff, which is pretty cool.
583129	588892	I did get stuck behind a rock one time in a cave because, hey, I'm going to go back there.
588972	594155	And the problem is, if you don't land on the ground, it won't let you jump again.
594495	595596	So I got stuck.
595636	601039	I wasn't quite, you know, I was kind of clipped on the rock, and I couldn't quite touch the ground, so it wouldn't let me jump.
601119	603600	So I could not move, which was bad.
604161	605382	Thank you for watching!
632394	633516	It probably would let you.
633577	634378	It's very thorough.
635361	637205	Okay, any other games you've been playing this week?
638228	638448	No.
638469	639030	All right.
639960	640701	My Gaming Week.
640721	649530	I spend a little time customizing my Xbox 360 because you can link it up to your PC to play music off your PC and look at pictures from your PC.
649830	662943	So I finally played with this feature a little bit this week because for some wacky reason I thought that you could also stream movies from your PC, but I guess you have to have Media Center to do that, which I don't, but I went to the hassle to set it up anyway only to be disappointed.
663383	669565	But it's still kind of neat that you can use music from your computers, custom soundtracks to games and stuff, and use the pictures.
669825	677647	Well, one other thing that you can do with the pictures is that you can actually change the theme on your Xbox 360 to be one of the pictures from that.
678028	679108	So you can set your own...
679808	681389	background, essentially by doing that.
681749	690931	So I thought to be ironic, what I did is I went onto Nintendo's website and I downloaded a background for Mario Kart DS and I put that background in the share folder.
691252	696693	And so now when I bring up my Xbox 360, it's got this big Nintendo Mario Kart DS background.
696733	700654	So I'll have to take a picture of it and put it on the forums just to be cute.
700734	701515	I don't know why I did it.
701575	702755	I thought it would be funny.
704869	706831	I guess there's only some things only I find amusing.
706871	707151	I don't know.
707191	708392	Maybe some of you out there find that amusing.
709233	709593	Let's see.
709954	715238	So as far as actual games I was playing, speaking of Xbox, I downloaded Astro Pop in the Xbox Live Arcade.
716619	727508	I'm a little bit over the love affair with PopCap-style games, and Astro Pop was a game I really liked an awful lot back when it was called Magical Drop.
728088	728289	Yeah.
729202	736425	I played Astro Pop a little bit on the PC, but when I played on the Xbox 360, the thrill was kind of gone after a couple rounds.
737165	738886	It wasn't really a long-lasting game for me.
738926	744328	I don't like the fact they're charging $10 for these games when gems like Geometry Wars are only $5.
744508	754032	I don't think I can really recommend Astro Pop unless you're really, really into the puzzle games, in which case you've probably already downloaded this and you know this game's for you.
755436	758077	Speaking of puzzlers, here's a game now that's worth every penny.
758137	760737	Tetris DS just came out for the Nintendo DS this week.
761137	761957	It is awesome.
762797	771639	I think the thing with Tetris is that we know there's been a crapload of Tetris games since Tetris on the Game Boy.
771719	776600	For instance, I know there was a really big one on the PlayStation, but none of the Tetris games have been very memorable.
777220	781201	And nothing's really matched that bar that Game Boy Tetris set.
781481	783981	We'll leave it to Nintendo to come back and do it again and
784281	793625	and make their game memorable, which they've done, I think, by inserting all these cute 8-bit retro things and, you know, with the music and all that, all these new modes.
793645	795365	There's just huge amounts of new modes.
795906	798667	The catch mode and the touch mode and the puzzle mode.
798967	800567	Just all this stuff to keep you busy.
801168	802628	And then, of course, you can take it online.
802908	807750	And I think the great thing about being able to play it online is that, you know, it's a real quick game that you can play online.
808510	812632	I kind of wish that you could play online in an unranked setting
813032	815614	The only way you could do that is by playing people on your friends list.
815954	819277	And then on the reverse side, you can't play ranked matches against your friends.
819677	823360	So either you play against strangers in a ranked match or friends in an unranked match.
823380	824301	There's really no in between.
825361	827003	But that's probably only my minor gripe.
828504	830125	Otherwise, this game is magnificent.
830185	832847	And if you're a puzzle fan, you must have this game.
832887	834028	It's a must-own game.
834688	835249	If you're not...
836224	836764	Puzzle Fan
865194	866675	Other games I've been playing this week.
866916	873441	I also picked up Metroid Prime Hunters, which is the 3D Metroid game which had the demo that was packed in with the DS initially.
873722	876344	Well, the game's gotten a little bit of a facelift since the demo.
876364	878086	I mean, obviously it's been over a year now.
878686	880087	And I've been playing the game.
880127	882089	It's got a very interesting control scheme.
882109	884171	You can pick from different control styles.
884211	888375	You don't have to use the stylus, but using the stylus kind of makes the most sense.
888875	916123	but what I kind of find is that you really have to find the right position for yourself to play this game or you can really hurt your arm like it really can make your arm sore to play this game I kind of found and I did not like the fact I seem to recall in the demo that the map was always on the bottom screen like you kind of got a 2D representation that's gone like you can pause the game to get a 3D map a la Descent type thing but it sucks I don't like the map at all I don't know what happened and that
916949	922296	That really wrecked it for me in some ways because the 3D games are kind of weird enough for me.
922556	926181	I'm a very map-oriented person, so I was a little unhappy with that.
926221	928644	It wasn't very clear also how to save your game.
929024	933330	A lot of the how to get into the game and stuff wasn't very clear to me.
934090	937693	If you like the Metroid games on GameCube, I don't see why you wouldn't like this.
938373	941255	I haven't tried the online mode yet, but I'm sure it's a lot of fun.
942436	945998	But honestly, I don't think it's really worth all the hype.
946098	951421	I don't think Metroid Prime Hunters is quite the game it really could have been for me.
951601	952002	I don't know.
952542	956104	Maybe I'm just being a little harsh because there were just a couple things that really bugged me about it.
956144	961828	But I really, I can only recommend this title to you if you like the other action style games.
962216	962997	Thank you for watching.
963017	964600	See you next time.
978100	979301	That's it for our gaming weeks.
979841	980862	Let's move on to some news.
981282	988927	And, of course, the big, big news this week was Game Developers Conference, which happened over this past week, which we almost went to.
989227	992009	We were standing kind of next door to it, but we didn't really go.
992049	993870	We had to read about it on the Internet, just like you guys.
993890	995751	But here's a quick summary of what happened.
995792	998974	So, Loki, you're going to go down kind of company by company here, and we'll talk about it a little bit.
999394	999594	Yeah.
999654	1000014	All right.
1000214	1001095	What's Tony talking about?
1001624	1008089	Okay, well, Sony, of course, their big thing was talking about the PlayStation 3 and the PSP and all that fun stuff.
1008909	1021618	And, you know, really, they were just kind of talking about, you know, what they're going to do as far... Well, one of the games they announced was God of War 2, which they showed the demo for it, and it looked awesome, of course.
1021638	1027542	You know, God of War just was one of the best games before the PlayStation 2, so it makes sense that they're going to make the second one.
1028466	1042713	Then, of course, they talked a little bit about the PSP and what changes are going to come to it, including both the GPS, which is coming out later this year, and also the iToy, which is going to be coming out later this year for it as well.
1043914	1050017	New web browser, of course, with improved RSS channel and Macromedia Flash, which is going to be great.
1050477	1052138	That's actually coming in the next update.
1053158	1056640	And then with the video camera, they're actually going to have a Wi-Fi connection
1057259	1059740	VideoPhone option for it as well.
1059840	1065321	So, I don't know, not quite side-talking, but pretty close.
1067381	1068222	Interesting nonetheless.
1069042	1074763	Another thing they announced, though, was that LocoRoco is coming to the PSP.
1074783	1081745	And that's kind of like another game almost similar to the Katamari, since it's a very awkward, strange Japanese game that they're bringing over here.
1081765	1081805	So,
1082748	1088172	What makes this thing as Katamari is leaving and quitting while they're ahead, so to speak.
1088592	1092435	Got to try and find something to fill that gap in the quirky game category.
1092735	1093216	Exactly.
1094237	1096819	The other thing is, of course, they were showing tech demos for the PS3.
1097659	1101902	And, of course, they had the classic ducks in there and made a big joke about that.
1102603	1104244	But it looked pretty cool.
1104904	1110028	Some of the other demos I was actually pretty interested in, they had one showing a vehicle physics demo.
1111454	1127122	and basically showed this really cool looking car get basically destroyed by a bunch of bullets and all done incredibly accurate to, you know, just physics-wise, you know, paint chipping and it's just amazing.
1127702	1138387	Anyways, another game they showed, of course, Warhawk, which is one of the ones, kind of, I think that was actually an old PlayStation game, if I remember correctly, kind of an aerial combat game, almost like Twisted Metal, but for air.
1138988	1140029	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1160290	1165834	And of course they also announced that they're going to have full PlayStation 2 support for the PS3.
1166135	1171859	And all the games are going to be upscaled to the 1080p or whatever.
1173137	1173457	I don't know.
1173998	1175499	You know more about tech than I do.
1175719	1183183	Why is it, and maybe some of our listeners too, why is it that it seems like Microsoft is having such a problem with backwards compatibility?
1183243	1185364	I mean, only some things can be played.
1185444	1187745	Whereas PlayStation can do it easily.
1188245	1190066	Oh, isn't it the graphics thing?
1190226	1198091	Yes, because it has to emulate the other graphics chip, whereas this is the same graphics chip or same family of graphics chips.
1198111	1200392	That's why they can run it perfectly.
1201331	1205334	That's a bummer because I think that's a pretty big selling point for Sony.
1205374	1206255	That's too bad for Microsoft.
1215745	1216586	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1238922	1241383	and, of course, just, you know, micropayments and stuff.
1241803	1244245	Basically, if it's on Xbox Live, you're going to probably see it on there.
1244265	1253089	Yeah, the advantages to launching your console a year after one of your biggest competitors is that you can basically copy everything that they did, and that sounds like what they're doing with their setup.
1253529	1267916	The other thing that they were doing with it a little bit differently, one, they're not going to be a central server for the games, but all the other companies are going to be running their external servers, but this one you'll log into and it'll be kind of like an...
1268769	1269450	Thanks for watching!
1291953	1292694	Purchasing games?
1293054	1293534	Possibility?
1322256	1323157	and so on.
1345029	1345609	Thanks for watching!
1362831	1372314	I don't know, and I honestly don't remember a lot about the launches of PlayStation 2 and PlayStation because I was more following that stuff casually because we weren't doing this back then.
1372834	1382396	But, you know, I noticed that when consoles first come out, the games are never as graphically powerful as they can be towards the end of the console's run.
1382697	1386198	So to say the games look better than Xbox 360, well, for now, right?
1386258	1391279	I mean, couldn't Xbox 360 come out with a more graphically enhanced game later in its life?
1391755	1395277	Yeah, but I don't know if it has the processing power, I think.
1396038	1397539	We'll see.
1398259	1407126	Finally, the last thing they kind of touched on, which is interesting, is SingStar, which, for those who might not know, it's actually a karaoke game that's really popular in the UK.
1408206	1409167	They're bringing it over here.
1409227	1415171	It's going to be on NextGen, which I don't know how you can really improve a singing game that much, but it should be interesting.
1415711	1418353	I'm kind of surprised with Karaoke Revolution's success.
1418413	1419374	It's kind of odd that
1419830	1420470	God of War 2 PlayStation 2
1445325	1450415	Okay, well, it sounds like Sony's got a lot on their plate there, so very cool.
1450455	1451277	What about Nintendo?
1452539	1456527	Nintendo definitely... We were all hoping they would be talking about the revolution, and...
1457219	1457860	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1476345	1476525	and so on.
1506305	1506925	Zelda The Phantom Hourglass
1535709	1551475	and of course we'd be using the touchscreen for a bunch of different puzzles as well as kind of like, I don't know if you remember the old Batman Returns movie or whatever, but where Batman actually programmed into his bat-ring where it would fly.
1551535	1553336	Well, it's kind of a similar thing with the boomerang.
1553376	1556938	You draw a path for the boomerang and it will fly with that.
1557658	1560079	Just really cool, kind of combining the look of
1562347	1566195	Zelda, Wind Waker, and some of the Minish Cap stuff.
1570041	1572082	You know, I don't think I should really be surprised.
1572602	1574363	I noticed a lot of people were really surprised.
1574383	1576224	Like, OMG, a Zelda game on the DS.
1576324	1579265	But at the same time, it kind of seems pretty logical, doesn't it?
1580386	1586508	Like, my reaction to that when I read the news was like, Oh yeah, it is about time for a Zelda game on the DS.
1586548	1587709	We haven't really had one yet.
1588149	1589670	Like, that was kind of my reaction to the news.
1589690	1592411	I was like, oh yeah, I wonder when they are going to be doing that.
1592471	1595032	So it was kind of cool to see, though, and see...
1596159	1599382	That they're going to go with the Wind Waker style look for the DS game.
1599502	1600663	Kind of should be interesting.
1600883	1602324	I do not think that is cool at all.
1602784	1603025	Really?
1603065	1604526	Just because you don't like the Wind Waker look?
1604886	1611491	I didn't like... I thought that it was... I never did like that type of art style.
1611872	1614093	I thought that it looked very poorly done.
1614914	1618497	I didn't think... It was like trying to be stylistic, but it looked really...
1619443	1621104	Just like a five-year-old drew it.
1621504	1625846	For me, it's the kind of look that should have been on the DS and only on the DS.
1626166	1629507	It kind of should have been the portable look and not the GameCube one.
1629547	1631088	I think it shouldn't have been a look at all.
1632088	1633989	Well, I have to agree to disagree on that one.
1635570	1636550	Anything else interesting?
1636730	1645574	Yeah, some of the other things, they were talking about creating a video game version of Apple's iTunes, but for video games, kind of like a service for that.
1646345	1647166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1668764	1675566	I think only kind of further proves this theory that you're going to have to pay for this because I don't see them signing these agreements to make it all free.
1675986	1677886	So I think you are going to see something very similar.
1677906	1687188	The iTunes store where you pay like a dollar to play the game, maybe a dollar fifty to maybe even up to five dollars for some of the titles when we start getting into later generations.
1687828	1688168	Who knows?
1688228	1689209	Of course, that's all estimates.
1689309	1689809	I mean, who knows?
1691846	1693587	Maybe you get a couple of them for free.
1693828	1695569	I mean, just to kind of show how it works.
1695949	1699652	Like, you know, iTunes does a free song once in a while, so maybe they would do something like that.
1699712	1703455	But, you know, I think for most of it, you're going to have to pay for the good stuff.
1703916	1705797	But, you know, to some people, it's going to be worth it.
1706057	1708319	It's a way of legalizing the ROM thing.
1708339	1715264	Like, I'm sure the industry's been wanting forever to kind of squelch the ROM scene that goes on underground on the Internet.
1715284	1718047	So maybe this is their way to do it and kind of...
1719971	1725814	I don't know, sort of show that there is a legal outlet for this, and if they wanted to maybe take legal action against ROM stuff, I don't know.
1726194	1727054	I'm theorizing here.
1730215	1730535	I don't know.
1732336	1742760	The other thing I was interested in is, of course, everyone's thinking, okay, they're going to drop the bomb on some big The Revolution being VR type thing.
1743000	1744241	That's been the rumor.
1744281	1745061	Everyone's thinking that.
1746042	1746942	Of course, that didn't happen.
1747742	1750062	Well, that's because they're waiting for E3.
1750182	1758504	And he said, I've got, you know, this is going to be, there's still another major announcement.
1758684	1762605	You're still convinced on the stereoscopic 3D thing, aren't you?
1763305	1764265	I'm still convinced.
1766426	1767226	I know it's out there.
1767446	1771567	And there was actually a thing on, was it Holo Projection?
1771607	1773547	There was another device that they were showing.
1775165	1776165	I don't remember where I read that on.
1776846	1780407	Not necessarily for Nintendo, but for something else.
1780727	1782648	I know technology is out there.
1783188	1784249	I know it's going to happen.
1784449	1787910	You knew they weren't going to say anything at GDC.
1787950	1788650	Here's the thing.
1788751	1791912	The whole theme of it is disrupting gaming.
1792052	1794133	Disruptive gaming is what it is called.
1794193	1799715	It's basically a technique where you make a big splash in the water.
1799735	1801116	That's basically the way it works.
1801696	1801816	And
1802737	1808088	What's gonna happen at E3, you're gonna get a lot of information that you haven't heard yet, and it's just gonna be like,
1808726	1822417	Wow, it's kind of like, you know, just finishing off somebody, you know, real quick, you know, the one-two punch and then... Well, the companies are doing that so that they can't steal from each other, essentially, so that Nintendo, when they announce this at E3, it'll be too late for Sony to copy it in time for their launch.
1822738	1826561	And same thing with whatever bomb Sony ends up dropping, same thing for Nintendo and Microsoft.
1826821	1832826	That puts Microsoft in kind of a funky position, not, I mean, but they could have secrets too that they're going to unveil at E3, you know, so...
1833446	1836408	But at E3, you've got the world media there.
1836468	1843053	I mean, GDC, while it's important, doesn't quite have that same attention factor that E3 does.
1843194	1844274	You know what I mean?
1844915	1847977	I mean, media people from around the world go to E3.
1848157	1849078	Everybody is watching.
1849398	1851920	GDC, the hardcore gamers are watching.
1853521	1856744	So, I'm still confident because we haven't heard no yet.
1857865	1858065	So...
1859540	1862162	I'm confident that, you know, there's got to be more to it.
1862282	1864603	Because we haven't seen really any of the demos yet.
1866104	1866424	I don't know.
1866444	1868185	I think it's going to happen.
1868205	1869506	We'll say six weeks until you find out.
1869606	1869986	Six weeks.
1870346	1874289	And basically, of course, the big theme, which everybody, you know, you've got to love.
1875749	1881113	Iwata's theme is basically, video games are meant to be just one thing.
1881613	1881893	Fun.
1882473	1883134	Fun for everybody.
1884374	1885375	Well, let's hope he means it.
1885822	1890263	But, you know, based on Nintendo's track record, they're pretty good about keeping it with the funds.
1891064	1892084	Moving on, Microsoft.
1892144	1897366	Now, Microsoft's in the position where they already have a system out there, so what kind of stuff were they pushing at GDC?
1897946	1903087	They were talking, of course, about, you know, Xbox Live Arcade and, like, kind of the stuff that's coming out for that.
1903527	1914571	And just basically, you know, concentrating on Xbox Live, they released basically a framework for anybody to be able to kind of build a back-end to...
1918435	1944894	The other thing that they were talking about Some of the downloads coming out for some of the Microsoft first party games Like Project Gotham, you're going to see more cars, more tracks Cameo, you're going to see co-op play over live As well as more outfits Actually they were already talking about Perfect Dark Which is going to have more multiplayer maps in Oblivion
1945370	1974724	which I thought was interesting and the first pack is going to be a horse armor pack ok interesting yeah and also of course talking about the games coming out you know Street Fighter 2 was it Hoop World I think is one of the big ones coming out and there is going to be one of the first games using the Unreal 3 engines actually going to be hitting Xbox Live which I thought was interesting very cool oh and the webcam of course oh right
1975362	1979846	One of the things, of course, we've kind of talked about the webcam a little bit before.
1981467	1984910	Basically, you know, something that looks kind of like a webcam or eye toy.
1985851	1991675	What's interesting, though, is it's going to have gesture recognition.
1992236	1998381	So I guess the camera is going to... So like if I stick up my middle finger at the game, it'll know, and it'll go, that's not nice.
1998781	2003185	Well, I'm not sure exactly what that is, but... Gesture recognition.
2003485	2004365	But I guess, you know...
2005874	2008375	If you're frowning or something, I don't know.
2008715	2012817	Maybe if that way... If I moon the camera while my Xbox go, Oh, God!
2013337	2020460	Maybe if they eventually port over World of Warcraft to the 360, you'll see if you look suicidal so they can call the authorities.
2020500	2021560	Wait a minute, though.
2021701	2024962	They said not going to happen on World of Warcraft on Xbox 360.
2025002	2025902	Yeah, and here's why.
2025942	2029324	But see, Blizzard said it's not going to happen based on the framework that they have right now.
2029404	2032045	It doesn't make it easy for them to do it.
2032305	2034906	But now that they've done this and kind of changed, you know,
2035822	2038983	The way live works, it could happen.
2039783	2040463	Or it might happen.
2041003	2043724	I really don't care, but yeah.
2043984	2045544	Comment from the chatroom, Rainy, again.
2046144	2047524	Sky, what if you're aroused?
2048545	2050665	Would it sense that and then call somebody to come over?
2051165	2052025	No, I'm just teasing.
2054146	2054806	Special help.
2057426	2059727	I like the emo sensor comment.
2061714	2089917	what I do like about it though is it will be able to take high def still pictures which is pretty cool so 1280 by 980 1.3 megapixels would we be able to take a webcam like that put it in here and like broadcast over Xbox Live in a way yes now that might be kind of trippy I'll check that out it says smooth near DV quality video up to VGA 640 by 480 at 30 frames per second so in a sense we could probably do that
2091001	2091782	Which would be interesting.
2093483	2095184	Then digital zoom cropping.
2096005	2098967	It's also going to have a 9-foot USB cable, which is awesome.
2099607	2102909	Because I hate having to strap more USB cables to it.
2103390	2104390	Alright, sounds very cool.
2105031	2107252	Lots of good stuff there coming out of Game Developers Conference.
2107313	2109134	Lots more in six weeks at E3.
2109434	2114758	Like I said, I think I said this last week on the show, GDC is kind of like that tease.
2114998	2115819	Here's a little taste.
2116159	2117079	Here's a little bit of crack.
2117540	2119541	We'll give you some more when you come back in six weeks for E3.
2119561	2119601	So,
2121357	2123519	Alright, let's move on and get into some other news.
2123539	2128643	There was lots of other news that happened at GDC and kind of around GDC, so let's get into some of that.
2129243	2133006	Last week I was talking about Final Fantasy XI and there's a lot of expansions coming to that.
2133267	2138491	Oh yeah, I didn't even mention during my gaming week, I'm at level 12 on my new character on Final Fantasy XI.
2139071	2139312	Addict.
2139352	2139672	Thank you.
2140307	2140828	I was waiting for that.
2140948	2141989	Alright, let's see.
2142069	2146675	Square Enix revealed a little bit of its new Chocobo circuit feature.
2147856	2154324	And basically the way that you raise your bird in the game will determine its size and its shape and ultimately the stats.
2154705	2158229	So I think that's awesome because I want to have a fat Chocobo because fat Chocobo is the best.
2158369	2158910	Yes, it was.
2159600	2161581	Smells like chocobo, remember?
2162061	2163321	All right, so I want a fat chocobo.
2164121	2173444	By introducing your chocobo to somebody else's bird, if they're compatible and of the opposite sex, you might be able to breed more chocobos.
2173744	2175225	No gay chocobo love in here.
2175345	2185868	Well, I mean, you know, I think the fallback for that is that, you know, you can't make babies in a homosexual relationship, not without test tubes and things that don't exist in the Final Fantasy world.
2186308	2187609	And donors, yeah.
2187709	2187989	Let's see.
2189939	2191980	There's still things that are not answered yet.
2192380	2193860	Where are you going to keep the chocobo?
2194441	2195801	Will it be in the mog house maybe?
2196781	2198482	How often can you do the breeding?
2198562	2200022	Can you sell the chocobos?
2200342	2201363	Can you trade them?
2201643	2205004	Are you going to be able to ride your own chocobo around the world?
2205704	2206324	Can you eat them?
2206464	2208045	Can you spank them when they're naughty?
2209458	2211279	My chocobo was an old tea bunny.
2211460	2213361	Can you cook them and eat them?
2213421	2213741	How rude.
2213761	2214622	That would be awesome.
2214782	2216783	We didn't have Kentucky Fried Chocobo.
2218304	2219926	Can the chocobos attack the bunnies?
2220326	2228411	Once and for all, let's get rid of all those damn bunnies, like the uber bunnies in Buribumu or whatever that land is where the level 70 bunnies are.
2228431	2231093	Do you have to take your chocobo for a walk and do you have to clean up after it?
2231694	2232374	Is there a law?
2232474	2237178	Is chocobo poo used as a flame agent when you're making stuff?
2237518	2237578	No.
2239423	2243005	The Chocobo Circuit is not going to go live until later this year.
2243065	2244946	It's going to be a patch that rolls out in the fall.
2245326	2250808	However, you'll have a good four months or so to breed because the expansion will do that.
2251649	2254150	The Circuit, that's just the racing, of course, right?
2254230	2258112	Right, that's the racing, a la Final Fantasy VII, which people have been begging for years.
2258352	2261393	That's going to breathe a lot of life back into Final Fantasy XI, I think.
2262226	2267389	I noticed the game is emptier now than it was six months ago.
2267509	2268770	You know what?
2269530	2271992	I still like the Peko Peko versus the Chocobo.
2272432	2273453	Pimp my Chocobo?
2274073	2276094	Because the Peko Peko looks like a giant turkey.
2276875	2278696	We've got to bling out this Chocobo.
2278756	2282398	We're going to put an all bass sound system up its ass.
2283639	2285500	You Final Fantasy people and your Chocobos.
2286020	2286320	All right.
2287101	2287281	Look.
2288374	2292498	All we need is if they do a third expansion, then we need Pimp My Moogle, Pimp My Mog House.
2292538	2293659	I mean, you can kind of do the Mog House.
2293679	2294761	You can already Pimp Your Mog House.
2294781	2295661	Yeah, but it sucks.
2295822	2296943	I mean, there's not a lot you do with it.
2296983	2298885	I had a plant in my Mog House in a bed.
2299826	2303209	There's not really a lot you do with the Mog House, but everybody's Moogle looks the same.
2303349	2304991	I want a fat Chocobo and I want a fat Moogle.
2306317	2307497	I want my Moogle to dance.
2307558	2308338	I want Mogdance.
2308478	2308898	Exactly.
2308918	2309698	And we need a dancer.
2309738	2310859	We need that to be a character.
2311379	2313300	We have dancers in Ragnarok.
2313420	2314400	Oh, shush.
2314640	2322063	Somebody in game the other day was trying to sell me up and down that Geomancer is this unannounced fourth character that's going to be in the expansion.
2322103	2324964	I'm kind of like, dude, I think they would have announced it by now.
2325064	2325485	I don't know.
2325945	2326925	Take that with a grain of salt.
2328346	2328666	Let's see.
2329346	2330447	Comments from the chat room.
2333003	2338087	Fireboma says it would actually be more like a Valis fried chocobo, not Kentucky fried chocobo, just so you know.
2339247	2344431	That came from VGCats, Kentucky Faraga chocobo.
2345492	2349615	Rainy says, can the fucking chocobo fly a la Final Fantasy IX?
2349675	2352337	Even in the older Final Fantasies, if you had a black chocobo, it could fly.
2353358	2353999	Thoughts there?
2354539	2357301	Chocobo's like an ostrich, it can't fly.
2357561	2360904	Well, Spiritsnare says, if a chocobo ate a chicken, would that be considered cannibalism?
2363223	2363623	I don't know.
2364604	2370386	Anyway, let's go to the next story, which is also Final Fantasy XI related.
2370446	2370966	Correct, Loki?
2371347	2372267	That's correct.
2372867	2381931	If you've been playing the Final Fantasy XI beta on the 360, well, you've got about until April 2nd before you've got to pony up the cash.
2381951	2388134	Because Final Fantasy XI is actually coming out on the 17th, which is pretty cool.
2388594	2389915	Both the expansion and...
2391625	2392446	The 360 version.
2392466	2394628	So if you own the PlayStation 2 one, you can get the expansion.
2395109	2397031	I think the PC expansion comes out around the same time.
2398853	2403618	However, though, if you have been playing in the beta for the 360, you can transfer your character over.
2403798	2405460	So all that hard work is for naught.
2406328	2435267	I don't know if I want to get Final Fantasy XI on the 360 anymore because I just I got a little bit of a bonus at work so I went and I bought some more RAM for the PC and so now I have two gigs of RAM in this PC and Final Fantasy XI I don't have frame rate issues anymore so it's kind of nice and plus editing this show will go so much faster now which makes me happy so we'll see there's still something to be said though about being able to plop my fat ass on the couch and playing with the controller and everything in my lap laying back
2437229	2454015	The only thing you really do, if you are going to go out and buy the 360 version of Final Fantasy XI, please pick up a mouse and keyboard.
2454775	2455955	Yes, I agree.
2457496	2459216	It's impossible to party without it.
2459376	2463198	I mean, I shouldn't say it's not impossible, but everybody will hate you.
2464835	2465596	Thank you for watching!
2482924	2484906	and you can only chat via, you know, your friends.
2484946	2490890	Oh, via the in-game chat, or the, I'm sorry, in, like, the Xbox 360 global chat thing, right?
2491090	2491311	Yeah.
2491451	2491671	Okay.
2491691	2493312	But still, though, I mean, that's pretty cool.
2493452	2494233	I mean... I guess.
2494453	2494853	That's true.
2494933	2499657	If I had friends in Link Shell that also had 360, I suppose that might be cool for a little bit.
2499917	2502079	Because Final Fantasy XI is usually a social thing anyway.
2502119	2506182	I'll go, that's how I kind of figure, I have some friends online that I pretty much only see there.
2506202	2512067	I don't talk to them on AOL Instant Messenger, so... Anyway, let's move over to another MMO.
2512952	2513333	DarkSakura
2527262	2536928	is a blogger, a big gamer in Japan, and he also thinks that World of Warcraft offers lots of business lessons for how to make companies work better.
2537849	2554379	Basically, his idea with this, the point was that employers do better, they need to make sure that they keep their employees happy by being respectful to them and encouraging them to work together to find their common goals without the leaders just pointing out the rules.
2558521	2566944	by giving their people unpleasant tasks and raids and pointing out, you know, you do this, we've got something for you, just do it how you need to do it.
2569426	2574648	That's interesting because those endgame guilds and stuff can really be like a job sometimes.
2574728	2584512	Not that I've been addicted to the game enough to actually get into one, but I've heard about that, you know, there's like expectations that sound like harsher expectations at my job.
2584532	2593556	Like, you know, in these endgame guilds you must show up on certain nights a week and you have to perform these functions and you will be doing this in the raid or you're kicked out of the guild.
2593596	2594396	You're fired.
2594916	2605271	What he's saying is that with the nature of the game, because it forces people to work together to reach your goals, that it parallels how you need in your business to work together to reach your goals.
2612415	2615936	Touches so many other people's job that if we don't work together, it won't get done.
2616516	2618217	So there's a lot of parallels with that.
2618277	2621178	And, you know, this guy is really successful.
2621658	2624799	He's considered to be a very good leader in business.
2625519	2627720	You know, there's got to be something to it.
2628300	2628700	I think that.
2629355	2630156	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2655524	2657465	For example, I learned a lot.
2657886	2660948	You actually learned a little bit about business and marketing in Ragnarok.
2661368	2661608	Yeah.
2661928	2663509	Because this was my thing.
2664210	2666431	I played a merchant for a long time in Ragnarok Online.
2666891	2675036	I would take my warps to Komodo, go buy my Iron Arrows at my discount, go back and sell them for three times the price.
2675197	2680380	But I also had to, when I figured in that price, I would figure in how much does it cost for me to warp there,
2681315	2682357	How much is it going to be?
2682477	2684260	What is my profit margin going to be?
2684460	2685702	Yeah, you learn a lot.
2685742	2689588	In Final Fantasy XI, it was the same thing with auction house versus NPCs.
2689608	2691571	You learn a lot about supply and demand.
2691891	2694114	And one money-making trick, I'll go ahead and spill it.
2694154	2694555	I don't care.
2694875	2696498	I don't think anybody's going to copy me, but we'll see.
2696998	2699839	One money-making trick I've been using right now is that I notice is very similar.
2700159	2705500	If you go to a certain NPC, you can buy a certain piece of armor for about 1,000 gil.
2705760	2707581	It sells to the auction house for 8,000 gil.
2707881	2708801	So you can kind of buy it there.
2709081	2711262	And some people go, oh, that's wrong, that's wrong.
2711322	2712642	But at the same time, well, okay.
2712662	2713443	That's the real world.
2713463	2714443	They could go.
2714783	2716583	Yeah, in a way, that's the real world.
2716663	2718624	That's how business works.
2718864	2722465	When you buy a game, an imported Japanese game...
2723331	2726012	You're paying extra because they brought it in for you.
2726032	2726893	It's fascinating to me.
2726913	2727613	Here's how it works.
2727693	2730015	Okay, for example, soda, a fountain drink.
2730315	2730555	Okay.
2730795	2733276	When you buy a fountain drink, do you know how much the syrup you use costs?
2733316	2733957	Like three cents.
2734077	2734517	Three cents.
2734537	2735717	Do you know how much you're paying for your soda?
2735918	2736558	About two dollars.
2736758	2737498	At the movie theater?
2737759	2738099	A lot.
2738179	2738619	A lot.
2738799	2739639	That's how they make all their money.
2739680	2740420	Or even at a restaurant.
2740560	2741821	But it's the same thing.
2742221	2746923	I was actually selling the arrows for as much as a person would normally buy them in-game.
2747524	2750045	You know, if they took the time to go to Komodo to buy it.
2750740	2756722	but instead I bring it to them, charge them the same price, they think they're getting the better end of the deal when in fact I'm making double profit.
2758382	2760503	Because merchants have discounts.
2760883	2766064	See, if MMOs had been around when I was learning economy in high school, I would have done so much better.
2766344	2767844	You know what we did in my economics class?
2768285	2769085	We played the stock market.
2769645	2771445	I don't even remember my economics class.
2771865	2772686	I remember sleeping.
2772786	2774546	We invested in Intel and a morgue.
2775046	2775606	I cheated.
2776887	2777427	I would...
2778254	2790835	I was friends with this girl, we were both kind of outcasts, we were nerdy kids I was friends with this girl in economics class, we just kind of talked the whole way through I picked a funeral home, because people are dying to get in
2792344	2793085	Boo!
2793405	2793985	Boo!
2794025	2795366	No, no, no, that was my logic.
2795986	2797207	And my classmates agreed with me.
2797908	2799889	And that was actually one of our faster moving stocks.
2800069	2809294	I bought a stock that, or we played the stock exchange thing too, and I spent all my money on a stock that was 1.64th of a cent, and it doubled in price.
2810294	2812075	And so I made twice my money.
2812756	2813236	Good job.
2814620	2820702	Alright, moving on from economics lessons, let's learn about legal lessons, also can be learned in World of Warcraft.
2822843	2829685	Basically what's going on is that Blizzard asked this guy on eBay to stop selling this unofficial guide.
2831186	2835047	The guy that was selling the guide was a 24-year-old Brian Kopp of Bronson, Florida.
2835087	2839689	He was selling the Ultimate World of Warcraft Leveling and Gold Guide on eBay.
2840249	2843574	and it was basically his own guy that he put together.
2843834	2848660	Well, it was unauthorized, so Blizzard basically sent the smackdown.
2848700	2855989	They filed a complaint and it alleges... They're basically saying to this kid, don't do this.
2856429	2858171	Well, he's not taking this...
2858974	2859354	and DarkSakura.com.
2887325	2889226	and this guy's really standing up for himself.
2889666	2890266	What do you think, though?
2890286	2890646	Good for him.
2891706	2899948	But do you think, I mean, while it's human nature we want to cheer the underdog on, is it right for him to be selling these unauthorized guides on eBay?
2900208	2909071	I don't think that it was right for him to necessarily use the screenshots because the only time that you can really use, and I recently looked this up due to me winning an argument on DDR Freak.
2911295	2926469	Fair use, you have to... Just to go ahead and give a slight overview to it, you have to either edit the picture to some extent, or you can use copyrighted material like reproduction for news for education.
2927390	2931774	But this, I wouldn't necessarily qualify as under education.
2931874	2934276	It more qualifies under entertainment.
2936098	2936659	If he were...
2937723	2967036	Doing, like say he was writing an editorial on World of Warcraft Then yeah, he'd be able to use quotes from the game He'd be able to use screenshots Because that falls under fair use So I think that's probably where the judge is going to have to make the determination Is what does this qualify as I think he would be able to continue with his work But he couldn't use the screenshots Especially that in particular Because basically it just sounds like he's written an overblown FAQ Essentially And so, you know, if Blizzard was going to have a problem with that They would have been shutting down all the FAQs up on GameFAQs
2967512	2971894	Right, no, I think their problem is, well, GameFAQs doesn't, well, I mean, I guess that's wrong.
2971914	2980177	GameFAQs does make money off their advertising and stuff, but it's a little bit of a, you know, they walk a fine line, too, because they're really not making money off the games.
2980197	2982718	The information they present is owned by the people who presented it.
2982778	2983178	Right, right.
2983219	2984039	They just host it.
2984259	2984419	Yeah.
2985599	2992062	Therefore, they're not claiming ownership to the material within, they're not claiming, they did not produce any of the information.
2992182	2995464	It was individual people that produced the information, so they're perfectly fine.
2996304	2996484	Hmm.
2998444	2999124	Very interesting.
2999444	3001205	Another life lesson to be learned here.
3001265	3002705	So I guess we'll see what happens.
3002986	3006267	At least, you know, whoever's right or wrong, we don't know really.
3006347	3015590	But, you know, I think it's good that this guy is sticking up for himself and, you know, what he believes in and is going to fight this and doesn't, you know, just take it like I think a lot of people would.
3015690	3016490	So good for him.
3017958	3019160	And best of luck to him.
3019180	3019900	We'll see what happens.
3019980	3022062	We'll follow this story and let you know what happens.
3022923	3025785	Moving on, let's go over to Loki.
3026646	3031090	Very interesting punishment in another MMO that I had never heard about until this week, right?
3031110	3031310	Yes.
3032031	3035394	You know, I always thought, what's my MMO missing?
3035774	3037336	And that would be Crucifixion.
3038136	3039718	Definitely Crucifixion.
3040376	3042216	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
3065305	3066586	That's historically accurate though.
3068287	3069268	Did you see the pictures?
3069488	3071369	There were actually pictures on the internet of this.
3071810	3082357	They actually showed the guy and all these people in game standing around the cross and there's this sad little man on there just kind of hanging there and everybody's just kind of talking about it.
3082917	3089819	I think that there's of course a definite potential there for people to get their panties all in a bunch and go, oh, that's sacrilegious.
3090159	3092940	Well, but you're playing a historically... It's historically accurate!
3093080	3105104	You're going to play an MMO that's historically accurate and that kind of, if I'm not mistaken, this game kind of, it's big marketing niche is that, you know, be in the historically accurate Roman times, right?
3105184	3108805	We're going to be historically accurate, but we're going to leave out how they kill people.
3109437	3110618	No, I don't think they're going to do it.
3110799	3111379	Obviously, they're not.
3112521	3115584	I think that we're going to get the, oh, you have to get out of the game, blah, blah, blah.
3115724	3118267	No, people would be stupid to get their panties in a bunch over this.
3118347	3119909	But people are stupid.
3120210	3127858	If you want to play an online game that's cute and play something on the DS that's very colorful and friendly, don't play...
3128863	3130544	Emulation of Ancient Rome.
3130644	3131585	I mean, come on.
3131665	3137028	What I mean is there are these people there who are just that stupid who are going to say something about it.
3137048	3138929	There we go.
3138969	3139489	There's a shot.
3139710	3140130	There we go.
3140150	3141331	That is so neat.
3143272	3144873	It's just kind of... Well, no.
3144993	3148255	I think it's... I love studying history.
3149082	3149502	Death, the MMO
3178240	3181101	That would be so... You want Faces of Death, the MMO, or something that's disgusting.
3181201	3182442	No, no, no, no, no.
3183022	3187443	I want, like... I have my MMO.
3187864	3188904	Comments from the chatroom.
3188964	3191765	Legend of Zaku says, The passion of the MMORPG.
3192685	3194666	A little play on something else.
3194706	3195747	I love the screenshots here.
3195827	3198928	This one's like, Vondum says, No throwing dung.
3198988	3199828	It's too expensive.
3199968	3200768	Use apples.
3200889	3201729	They are cheaper.
3203990	3204550	All right.
3205030	3206811	Let's go to another story.
3207031	3207151	And...
3208086	3208987	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3231323	3237568	Hey guys, the podcast has been keeping my sanity from Wednesday to Friday as I made my way to and from jury duty.
3260074	3261735	Anywho... Poor bastard, I'm sorry.
3262035	3264436	The purpose of this email is to clarify the Tetris issue.
3264736	3269517	From what I remember, Bulletproof Software owned the rights to Tetris after Nintendo released it for the NES.
3269937	3277000	The Tengen Virtus, which is the best version in my humble opinion, was illegally obtained through and through lawsuits Nintendo won.
3277040	3279301	The Tengen version was deemed illegal and to this day is...
3280621	3304771	blah blah is considered a pretty penny if you can get your hands on it which I got mine like for $12 you know what I disagree on Tengen Tetris being this like I think it's a little bit overrated just because it is such a collector's item I don't think it's as great as people say it is Tengen Tetris had co-op mode it did but you know I just it's still I'm reading this letter alright I'm fine sorry and I'm interjecting my opinion that's what I do here
3306090	3314140	After that, the rights went to another company called Blue Planet Software and they were responsible for PC ports and licensing for a while and then it became the Tetris company.
3314680	3318805	And from what I know now, Nintendo licenses Tetris and any variants from them now.
3319326	3320667	I hope that clears things up somewhat.
3321428	3323010	That absolutely clears things up.
3323190	3324792	And he also agrees with Loki about Datel.
3325413	3326274	That their products are shit.
3328100	3328621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3346613	3349094	We have another email from Roger.
3350115	3352176	So just wanted to drop a note for a periodic listener.
3352196	3357078	I'm very glad you guys switched to the 64 KBPS stream format.
3357618	3358859	It's so much easier on the ears now.
3358979	3363601	I also like that you've added a bit more variety to the mix and really hope you don't stray too far from your Bimani roots.
3364301	3367163	On the other hand, I got such a kick out of hearing Pac-Man Fever the other day.
3368203	3370144	I still have the LP of that laying around somewhere.
3370686	3376329	Yes, we have little bits of randomness in our live 24-hour station that plays the music when we're not doing anything live.
3376609	3381612	And I must say that it's been buffed up now with even more video game music.
3381652	3384234	But of course, we will not stray from the Bomani roots.
3384314	3392178	In fact, we have Beatmania 2DX 13th style, also really the real name is Beatmania 2DX Distorted.
3392639	3393419	We have MP3s from that.
3393439	3395220	We're going to be putting some of those in rotation this week.
3395420	3395961	So some new stuff.
3396101	3397482	There's a new rendition of Bloody Tears.
3397602	3398142	That's pretty cool.
3400011	3401212	It's really different.
3401692	3403532	Don't expect it to sound like what you know, but anyway.
3404152	3405973	I got another email from Sycoon.
3407653	3410974	It's pretty long, so just to go over.
3411594	3413175	TetrisDS, conclusion, sexy.
3414295	3415195	You covered all of them.
3415395	3415635	Agreed.
3416675	3425197	My only complaint, though extremely minor, is that in online Wi-Fi play, the blocks the players get will be different, so you might get stuck with a crappy setup.
3425698	3427118	Another person will breeze through their blocks.
3429016	3434578	I did notice that too, is that the block order is not consistent, which I think is a bit of a disadvantage.
3434638	3437298	But it's also not the end of the world.
3438299	3441559	And you know what I hate about online multiplayer and Tetris is that goddamn banana.
3442440	3443360	Oh, that's the most frustrating.
3443520	3444540	It's like Shuffle and Tetris.
3444560	3445641	Oh, it's the most frustrating item.
3446581	3448561	Another one about DDR Supernova.
3449482	3450082	About Chaos.
3450762	3453363	Counted no less than 43 stops on that song.
3453383	3454923	Okay.
3455393	3456055	You know what?
3456196	3458102	It's one song out of, like, what, 200?
3458483	3460590	So I'm not going to bitch too much, but don't expect me to play this song.
3460610	3461714	Once you learn it, it's going to be easy.
3463220	3470027	The problem with that song is it's going to get whored out because everybody's going to learn it to show off to the parents and kids at the arcade.
3470047	3471949	I promise you right now I will not learn how to play it.
3472089	3472349	All right.
3472650	3472950	Thank you.
3472970	3473831	At least someone won't.
3474452	3475072	I won't either.
3475092	3476133	I will boycott that song.
3476854	3477355	I'm with you.
3477675	3478516	Let's boycott chaos.
3478536	3479256	Boycott chaos.
3479277	3479677	We're on.
3479977	3480998	And I'll make an edit to it.
3482400	3484882	We'll play Toxic over and over.
3485062	3485503	No, just kidding.
3487869	3490692	Also a question for us about the controller.
3492253	3494395	Wondering if the controllers are basically going to be switchable.
3494995	3495676	Oh, for Beat Media?
3495756	3498598	Yes, they will.
3498919	3502682	The only difference is the rounded edge on the turntable side, but it's still flippable, just like the old one.
3504163	3505765	We also have an email from David.
3506505	3507866	He says, Hey guys, I think the shows are great.
3507907	3510048	I love the new format, and I listen to you every week.
3510188	3512891	I think it would be great, though, if you could talk about some LucasArts games.
3513544	3516425	Also, are you sure that Sony is actually redesigning the PSP?
3516545	3520066	I read an article on Slashdot that said the camera would only be an accessory.
3520486	3524468	Would the games that come out after the new PSP come out still work on the old PSP?
3524508	3525908	The camera is an accessory.
3525968	3528069	It's plugged into the USB port in the top.
3528869	3533190	However, they are still looking at redesigning the PSP to be released later in the fall.
3534031	3537152	So... How Nintendo does it, why can't Sony, right?
3537232	3537592	It's both.
3537632	3538372	So, I mean...
3539409	3539989	I guess that's good.
3562577	3563219	I don't pay for that.
3572836	3573176	I don't know.
3573196	3577440	Well, my friend was a tester for that game.
3578060	3580482	That's how I got on the Skywalker Ranch.
3580562	3583645	Isn't this guy talking about, I'm thinking like Loom and stuff.
3583885	3585006	Dude, I love Loom.
3585046	3585987	Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
3586027	3587008	Loom was my favorite.
3587148	3590310	To be honest, there aren't that many LucasArts games coming out now.
3591411	3595174	Star Wars Empire at War just came out, and that one looks really cool.
3595434	3598537	I'm not really into too much of the RTS stuff on the PC anymore.
3600029	3602291	I like Battlefront 2, I thought that was pretty cool.
3604473	3608056	The problem is they only release one game a year, basically.
3608076	3611258	See, when this guy said LucasArts game, my mind instantly went to the old school stuff.
3611278	3613800	I wasn't even thinking Knights of the Old Republic, okay?
3613820	3617503	I'm thinking Indiana Jones, I'm thinking Maniac Mansion.
3617804	3625070	No, I'm thinking of the new things, just because my friend, when she worked for LucasArts, all I kept hearing her call it was Scrotor.
3626898	3635306	and actually we did get to go to the Skywalker Ranch while she was testing and I was in meatloaf-licking distance of George Lucas.
3635346	3635867	It was pretty cool.
3635887	3637168	We walked through the cafeteria.
3637408	3641872	PKAkira88 says Super Star Wars, which I would agree is one of my favorite Star Wars games of all time.
3642152	3642413	Rock.
3642713	3644875	I love the debug mode where you can just like breeze through the game.
3645015	3646236	All right, there's your LucasArts content.
3646256	3646917	Just think about that.
3646937	3648819	The LucasArts, what is it?
3648859	3650480	The Star Wars on the Revolution.
3650640	3651181	That would be sweet.
3651541	3651781	It will.
3652262	3652502	Okay.
3653523	3656424	Twist wrote in about female characters in games.
3656584	3660225	We got quite a response to that little bit last week, didn't we?
3660725	3660965	Yeah.
3661865	3663065	It was a pretty long one.
3663125	3668027	He's one of the SoCal players and played in Vegas, too.
3668127	3668347	Okay.
3668747	3669267	So go ahead.
3669287	3670627	I want to read through this one little part.
3670707	3675328	On the subject of men who use female characters, I only use and look for the female character in almost any game.
3675408	3675928	It's a habit.
3676008	3682290	I use Julia in Tekken, Shang-Hua or Sung-Min in Soul Calibur 3, Pink Yoshi in Melee.
3688942	3693969	And Diablo 2 plays a sorceress.
3695811	3698815	And Street Fighter 3rd Strike Chun-Li is a top character that kicks ass.
3699276	3701759	She is a character I use myself while playing any Street Fighter game.
3702240	3702721	I believe...
3703573	3705813	She is a top character in most Street Fighter games.
3706013	3709754	Nina in Tekken 5 is a top character as well, so Fatiha in Soul Calibur 3.
3710234	3711855	Even Peach is a top character in Melee.
3712335	3717096	So people who talk down on female characters are ignorant gamers or sexist, which is why I like to play people like that.
3717516	3718476	Knock some sense into them.
3718636	3719976	I am completely straight male, by the way.
3719996	3724557	This is exactly why I'm going to play Rumble vs. XX.
3724997	3728078	For the awesome, strong, female main character.
3728118	3728718	Yeah, right.
3728738	3729318	Yeah, gotcha.
3729598	3730438	One more little thing about...
3730819	3731659	Oh yeah, go ahead.
3732259	3734840	There's also many girls who play in these big tournaments that I go to.
3734920	3737920	This one female gamer in the Tekken community is top three in her state.
3738400	3739340	And the show is great, by the way.
3739380	3739741	I love it.
3739801	3741501	I would love to take on DarkSakura in Tekken.
3741681	3742121	Any of them.
3742941	3743781	Julia or Michelle Holloway.
3743821	3745021	Thing is, I play Julia.
3746022	3749142	And I also play Jin and Hwoarang, so it's on.
3749822	3751283	As soon as we get Tekken online.
3751503	3756883	I agree with this letter, except for the fact that Ivy will whoop Sofitia's butt any day.
3757424	3757804	Thank you.
3757824	3758344	Ivy is...
3760185	3760986	Badass, I love her.
3761086	3769612	It's still crazy though, just because as far as the Soul Calibur series, if anyone can play Valdo, oh my god, it's over.
3770693	3776157	I have, no, it's the freaking hardest character to learn and like easily the most hardcore, so.
3777317	3783822	You know, you explore your horizons a little bit, play some of the male characters, you may be surprised, but you know, at the same time.
3785343	3789086	I've also got another one on the same line from Macman.
3791158	3792519	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3820955	3824076	I picked Jin at first because I was a big Kazuya fan.
3824836	3826216	And now I'm just like, ooh, it's Jin.
3826576	3826996	He's so cool.
3827136	3829717	It really depends on the game I'm playing, honestly.
3829837	3835598	I don't necessarily gravitate towards the female characters, but I agree that Soul Calibur, Ivy's where it's at.
3835798	3838239	But Tekken, I don't know.
3838399	3842239	I was a bit more of a Huarong fan than I was Julia, so who knows.
3843580	3845380	Huarong looked like a guy I dated in high school.
3846280	3846760	Seriously.
3847360	3847621	Anyway.
3847801	3848441	Okay, anyway.
3849181	3849261	Um...
3850177	3856968	Also our friend Rob with two B's emailed us with something about Stay Alive.
3859913	3861075	So I'll go ahead and read his letter.
3861983	3862924	It's filmed very well.
3863024	3863805	Dialogue is okay.
3863845	3864725	The plot is pretty good.
3864845	3868008	Unfortunately, I was the only one in the theater who didn't think it was scary.
3868689	3869850	So I was in the minority.
3870030	3872272	But if you ever played a survival horror, this was tame.
3872352	3875775	And in fact, I think it's PG-13 because all violence was off camera.
3876295	3884262	On the negative, Frank Venus is still playing a Malcolm-like character when actor was sort of non-existent and another was just awful.
3884502	3890007	The sound editors know nothing about current computer games because the Internet Cafe had an Atari 2600 Donkey Kong sound in the background.
3890747	3893830	It's always that or Atari 2600 Pac-Man sounds in the background.
3894070	3895371	When will they ever get it right?
3895931	3897312	Could that be a licensing thing, though?
3897332	3899053	Humor me here for a minute.
3899073	3902456	Could that be maybe that they can't use sounds from current games because then they have to get permission?
3903777	3904097	I don't know.
3904577	3905078	Just a thought.
3905158	3905598	Random thought.
3905998	3907339	Let me put it this way, though.
3907519	3910301	You could seriously do just the sound effects of an arcade.
3910682	3911402	Remember Terminator 2?
3911442	3915665	That would be at least more current than... To go ahead and finish this...
3919158	3923382	The writer obviously does video games at least, however, it was a very big ad for Alienware.
3923482	3924724	It was worth a matinee at least.
3926866	3928848	Maybe I'll put it in the Netflix queue.
3929148	3931630	That's about the most that movie's going to get from me.
3931650	3933793	Alright, is that it for the mailbag?
3933813	3934393	That's it.
3934453	3937096	Let's close up the old mailbag and move on to more stories.
3937576	3941220	If you are a PlayStation 1 devotee, well...
3941966	3942847	It's over for you.
3943908	3944388	Not really.
3944929	3950473	What I'm trying to say is that the PlayStation consoles, the PS1s, are no longer going to be made.
3950654	3954417	Sony has stopped all production of the original PlayStation console.
3954741	3958442	Because, of course, now they need to start focusing their efforts on putting out the PlayStation 3.
3958482	3962183	They haven't made games for the PlayStation 1 in, like, years.
3962803	3964524	I think there was actually a release.
3964984	3965844	No, that was Dreamcast.
3965864	3968345	Yeah, but those are, like, little indie things.
3968405	3969525	No major release in a long time.
3969545	3972286	I thought they stopped production of the PlayStation 1 when, like, the PlayStation 2 came out.
3972306	3972886	You know what, though?
3972946	3976667	For folks that can't afford PS2s, PS1's a nice alternative, right?
3976687	3979608	You don't even want to see the stack of them sitting in our game room.
3979628	3980568	Yeah, so, you know...
3982101	3982562	DarkSakura.com
4005456	4008359	Oh yeah, there's a speculated name coming out.
4009080	4017328	Basically, a blog called Engadget got a hold of a photograph from a slide at a Nintendo presentation.
4018009	4025536	It was a blue cube looking thing formed out of the posing D-pads that was hovering over a name that said Nintendo Go.
4027459	4031286	Later on they got a photo that looked like a brochure that had the same name on it.
4031947	4035653	But Iwata hasn't said anything to support that.
4036335	4038699	They said they were supposed to announce the real name and never did.
4039604	4044428	N64 was supposed to be a codename for the Nintendo 64 but it came out as the Nintendo 64.
4044468	4045989	So they've done things like this before.
4046009	4047570	Their codenames have made it as official names.
4065802	4066182	Namo Web Editor 5
4088047	4090748	Exactly the same logo as the Nintendo Go.
4113416	4117737	I think they're on their fifth handheld system, too, whenever the next one comes out.
4117837	4130119	I think the most creative explanation I read somewhere on the internet on some feedback thread was that Nintendo Go sounds like a good gaming online thing, because if you think GO, gaming online, maybe that's the name of their online system.
4130259	4131720	That could be a definite possibility.
4131740	4133340	That's all speculation at this time, though.
4133460	4134080	Exactly.
4134380	4137701	I just still have this mental image, though, from...
4138692	4142313	The first few episodes of Red Dwarf were... No, not Red Dwarf.
4142353	4142893	I'm asking Red Dwarf.
4142913	4147354	From Star Trek, where everyone was addicted to the little game thing.
4149055	4154496	We're going to keep seeing more and more systems come out and they're going to be wired into our brains and we'll all be addicts.
4154837	4156997	There's also an episode of Sequest.
4158418	4159078	I don't know.
4159438	4159698	Anyway.
4161415	4162456	Let's see, moving on.
4162776	4164216	Completely different type of game here.
4164276	4165777	StarCraft Ghost.
4166497	4172079	StarCraft Ghost has been indefinitely postponed, and that's going to be a big disappointment there to StarCraft fans.
4172799	4181783	They have announced earlier this week that they are going to be focusing the company's console development efforts on the next generation of console platforms.
4182803	4183924	And so this means that...
4184904	4185785	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4206451	4210933	It's going to go next-gen if it's going to happen at all, which you could look at that either way as good news or bad news.
4210953	4217635	They're probably just thinking, well, hey, by the time this thing comes out, the next-gen systems are going to be launching anyways.
4218595	4219056	Might as well.
4219076	4223297	All right, let's move over to Jamie, who has a story for us on some wheeling and dealing with Sega.
4223937	4233981	Yeah, Sega is working with Obsidian to make a role-play game for the PC, the PlayStation 3, and the Xbox 360, but it doesn't have a name or a release date yet.
4234545	4237347	but we are probably going to see stuff on this at E3.
4239528	4245951	Really Sega's been doing a lot more partnerships with a bunch of different companies like Bizarre Creations, Silicon Knights, Monolith.
4246111	4247872	They've just acquired Creative Assembly.
4248413	4250754	It's a UK company.
4250954	4257918	The only thing that's really worked out, well with Creative Assembly they had the Total War series.
4257958	4259559	They had Condemned with Monolith.
4261580	4261820	But
4263948	4277655	As far as the game that's coming out, though, they say they're really excited to be working together, both companies.
4278195	4284198	There's a quote on here from Fergus Equart, I guess, CEO of Obsidian Entertainment.
4285470	4293420	They're excited to be working with a great publisher like Sega as they are willing and excited to launch new and visionary IP on next generation consoles.
4294856	4298979	I think it's very interesting all these little partnerships Sega's doing here and there.
4298999	4300480	They team up with these guys for this game.
4300800	4301601	It's kind of interesting.
4303282	4303942	That's all I can really say.
4303962	4306244	Until we see the game, all we can know is, interesting.
4306524	4310186	Well, you know I'll be ghosting around Sega's area at E3.
4310246	4310647	Of course.
4310667	4311647	Yeah, I missed them last year.
4311807	4314549	They had those big comfy chairs.
4314950	4319332	Because Universe was supposed to be out by now, Phantasy Star Universe, but now they've pushed it back.
4319352	4320073	Into the real world.
4320613	4322715	We'll see it again at E3 this year, right?
4322735	4324356	Maybe they will have fixed our complaints.
4324776	4325156	Possibly.
4325417	4325697	We'll see.
4326157	4327158	All right, let's move on.
4327759	4331242	Also in some wheeling and dealing, of course, Peter Moore is known as the big talker.
4331282	4332823	What's he talking about this week, Loki?
4333384	4334645	Next-gen sequels.
4335005	4336687	You've got to love.
4337327	4339289	To me, these are kind of like, duh.
4340090	4341231	Duh, this is going to come out.
4342072	4346055	For example, they're talking about a sequel to the Forza franchise.
4346536	4346956	Duh.
4346976	4347757	I mean, of course.
4347837	4350079	It's just like Gran Turismo on Xbox.
4352000	4353881	And then some of the other ones, they mentioned Fable.
4354201	4354981	I mean, come on.
4356721	4357041	Really?
4357382	4357782	Fable?
4357942	4358802	Getting a sequel?
4358822	4361283	I mean, gee, I didn't know the game did well or anything.
4361683	4368225	And then finally, Crimson Skies was going to be another one that was going to be getting a sequel, which is great because we need some more aerial combat games.
4370045	4372506	What about the one that just had the demo this week on Xbox?
4373626	4374887	Well, more than that.
4375307	4376487	We need more than one.
4376507	4377747	No, we don't.
4378047	4378728	Yes, we do.
4378828	4379508	That's just my opinion.
4379548	4379988	No, we don't.
4381530	4382231	Whatever, okay.
4382891	4388636	Anyways, one game that is not going to be getting a sequel is going to be Mecha Assault, because apparently Mecha Assault didn't sell very well.
4389576	4391238	That's okay, though, because Chromehounds is coming out.
4391318	4392138	That's all I need to hear.
4393339	4394400	Chromehounds and Armored Core.
4394660	4395081	All right.
4395661	4399024	Well, good job on our duh story of the week for most of that stuff.
4400115	4401516	Thank you for watching!

4435731	4436031	Psychonauts
4459174	4461916	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4486167	4489349	It's actually part of an art installation right now at a museum.
4489789	4500195	But designer Marcel Neandorfer has actually created urinals with interactive games built in and activated and controlled by streaming media.
4501676	4507320	And basically, I don't know.
4508260	4510842	To me, it's kind of stupid because streaming.
4513539	4518663	I mean, really, how long can you be playing a game when you're taking a piss?
4518703	4519444	I mean, seriously.
4519684	4520845	What if I'm pee-shy?
4521065	4522987	I mean, that puts me at a handicap.
4523968	4527191	Is it multiplayer?
4527231	4532335	Do they have a trough version of this game for those urinals that are just a big trough?
4532355	4533015	I mean, what's next?
4533116	4533836	Poo on the target?
4533956	4535257	Oh, that's disgusting.
4536118	4539601	DarkSakura, are you going to learn how to pee standing up just to play this game?
4539621	4540442	Fuck no!
4543001	4543664	Disgusting.
4544669	4545835	That's so stupid!
4547453	4549254	Only in an art show do we see something like that.
4549274	4565863	If you want to go sick and more demented game, whatever, you could get some sort of technology like that that measures the size of the crap that you take, and it puts you on a leaderboard, kind of a ranking system, so that you can see how far you fare against other crappers out there.
4566243	4567964	We already had the game Golden Tee.
4568064	4573026	This show has officially gone down the toilet, so I think it's time for us to take a little break here.
4573687	4574227	We'll be back...
4575027	4577628	After this little break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
