00:27.000 --> 00:38.560
it feels so good to be back you don't even know welcome back to orange lounge

00:38.560 --> 00:44.760
radio episode number 175 for this March the 5th of 2006 our first show back

00:44.760 --> 00:49.800
after a little bit of a vacation there dark soccer and I had plans that took us

00:49.800 --> 00:54.520
out of town real life gets in the way of independent podcasting sometimes so we

00:54.520 --> 00:58.180
took a little time off Loki lovely job filling in there in the past couple

00:58.180 --> 01:02.740
weeks with little just just short shows just it's a little bit of crack just to

01:02.740 --> 01:07.120
hold you over though so we appreciate that of course and just so you guys know

01:07.120 --> 01:11.400
that wasn't the original plan the original plan is that dark Sakura myself

01:11.400 --> 01:16.460
and Loki we're all gonna do one show but dark Sakura was having like mic issues

01:16.460 --> 01:21.340
or something and I was broke and couldn't buy anyone cuz we're power

01:21.340 --> 01:28.280
Cuz we don't get a paycheck. I made do with my headset mic on a pump. There you go. There you go, and I myself

01:29.440 --> 01:35.200
Lots happened in the past two weeks a lot's happened for one Loki. I bought an iBook

01:36.200 --> 01:38.040
Okay, I

01:38.040 --> 01:43.320
Was just waiting for some witty retort. I bought an iBook and the plan was to do a podcast for my brand new iBook

01:43.320 --> 01:48.280
I was gonna do that and that didn't work out too. Well, did it you know? No, no, it's not the iBooks fault

01:48.280 --> 01:53.880
I love I love my iBook. I really do. I'm sorry Loki the whole Mac thing

01:53.880 --> 02:00.200
I'm totally on Jamie's side now. I love the iBook. It's great. I mean, I'm when it comes to computers

02:00.200 --> 02:06.640
I'm I still consider myself bi I I love PC and there's you know, some some sometimes you feel like a nut

02:06.640 --> 02:10.160
Sometimes you don't okay. I some things I want a PC some days

02:10.160 --> 02:13.420
I want a Mac, but I really have appreciated what both have to offer there. So

02:13.420 --> 02:18.220
So I got an iBook and I wasn't able to do the podcasting on it and that was

02:18.220 --> 02:22.860
mostly because you know you go out when you go travel for a long time you go out

02:22.860 --> 02:28.220
with a certain plan and you don't always necessarily get everything done that you

02:28.220 --> 02:31.340
originally intended to do like I just got too busy in other words I just got

02:31.340 --> 02:34.220
too busy to take the time to set it all up. Didn't you try using like the mic that's

02:34.220 --> 02:36.900
actually part of it? There's actually a mic that's built in but it wasn't it wasn't

02:36.900 --> 02:39.860
good enough. Exactly. It sounded like I was talking out of a Dixie cup. I mean it would

02:39.860 --> 02:43.540
work for skype or something but it would not work for trying to do a

02:43.540 --> 02:47.900
professional sounding show as as we try to fake once in a while oh by the way

02:47.900 --> 02:53.180
by the way hello you are listening to orange lounge radio I'm Rob Roberts also

02:53.180 --> 02:56.660
known as sky or coughing host here who just had some water going down the wrong

02:56.660 --> 02:57.820
pipe you know how that goes

02:57.820 --> 03:02.060
joining me as always say hello to the lovely dark Sakura Jamie summers I am

03:02.060 --> 03:05.280
caffeine free for the third day in the row

03:05.280 --> 03:08.340
congratulations shoot me

03:08.340 --> 03:11.720
speaking of getting off the crack or whatever that's

03:11.720 --> 03:16.020
I'm freaking going through withdrawal like such a crack addict are you are you getting bad

03:16.020 --> 03:20.040
headaches cuz when I did the caffeine thing and believe me I went back

03:20.040 --> 03:23.560
um... I got really bad headaches okay thursday

03:23.560 --> 03:25.280
my friend Julie

03:25.280 --> 03:29.840
brought chocolate covered espresso beans to work in at eight fifteen

03:29.840 --> 03:32.800
and then we went to do um... gaming that night

03:32.800 --> 03:36.880
Tabletop gaming, you know where you roll dice and not you know, use your controller. Yeah

03:37.520 --> 03:44.740
And nobody else showed up in a roll a d20. Hey, no, actually we used d6. Oh, sorry. No. No, we used e10s

03:44.740 --> 03:46.740
It's Buffy. All right nerd

03:47.460 --> 03:50.660
Anyway, I uh, I ate like 10 more

03:52.840 --> 04:00.020
Okay, and I was bouncing yeah, I know caffeine thing going and so Friday I was like, you know what I'm no caffeine

04:00.020 --> 04:06.420
I've been drinking kombucha tea sounds dirty it's it's made out of it's a

04:06.420 --> 04:11.060
fermented tea made with mushrooms and sweet tea uh-huh and it tastes like

04:11.060 --> 04:16.100
apple cider vinegar all right but it's been keeping me healthy and keeping the

04:16.100 --> 04:21.860
withdrawal symptoms down and I've I've I had decaf coffee so for all those

04:21.860 --> 04:24.780
people who have emailed concerned about your health these are the actions you're

04:24.780 --> 04:29.300
taking to combat that I am so proud of myself I had a sinus infection last week

04:29.300 --> 04:34.580
uh-huh and I did not okay shut up sorry I'm not laughing at you I'm just okay

04:34.580 --> 04:39.260
I'm laughing for a rude reason but I mean it's just it's crazy I I did not go

04:39.260 --> 04:43.100
to the doctor I did not let them put me on any drugs I drink hot tea all week

04:43.100 --> 04:48.780
mm-hmm and as a result I am feeling fabulous tonight good because I am fully

04:48.780 --> 04:52.980
from here on unless I break something not going to the doctor ever again for

04:52.980 --> 04:56.660
an illness unless I have cancer or a brain tumor let's hope that doesn't

04:56.660 --> 05:00.200
happen. Alright, we gotta keep it moving. We do have video games to talk about. In case

05:00.200 --> 05:04.660
you haven't listened to Orange Lounge Radio before, we don't usually bitch so much about

05:04.660 --> 05:07.400
our personal lives, but we've been gone for two weeks, so we have a lot to catch up on.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.780
So we will get to games very shortly. Say hello, of course, to Loki. No Orange Lounge

05:11.780 --> 05:17.020
will be complete without Loki. I do feel sick today. Do you? Well, here's the reason why

05:17.020 --> 05:24.140
I feel sick. Basically, I went to the movies today and I saw Ultraviolet, but then I ate

05:24.140 --> 05:29.820
a whole bag of popcorn. And then afterwards I went to Applebee's and I had fish and chips

05:29.820 --> 05:33.680
with their honey pepper sauce. And then I was slamming down Pepsi's all day long and

05:33.680 --> 05:38.540
playing Xbox Live. And to the point where I was playing Xbox Live and either with the

05:38.540 --> 05:43.900
adrenaline of playing full auto and Pepsi's, you know, the caffeine, I was literally shaking

05:43.900 --> 05:49.140
like I had the chills. And now my stomach feels like I'm, you know, I'm sick. But it's

05:49.140 --> 05:52.380
probably just because of all that popcorn and I haven't eaten anything since lunch.

05:52.380 --> 05:53.620
so uh...

05:53.620 --> 05:56.780
but other than that i've been playing a lot of xbox live i swear to god sometimes

05:56.780 --> 06:00.120
you and jamie are like yin and yang i mean she'll have this healthy story to

06:00.120 --> 06:00.900
talk about in the mail

06:00.900 --> 06:04.580
i went to applebee's and dined on chicken strips or whatever it was you had

06:04.580 --> 06:10.220
it's just because i ate a bag of popcorn and and you know a bunch of

06:10.220 --> 06:12.340
honey pepper sauce and that stuff

06:12.340 --> 06:13.980
doesn't agree with my stuff

06:13.980 --> 06:17.340
chakra chupacabra tea or whatever jamie has

06:17.340 --> 06:19.140
chupacabra tea

06:19.140 --> 06:20.820
whatever it is you have

06:20.820 --> 06:26.460
loki has you know and of course my neck is all stiff and has been hurting for like two

06:26.460 --> 06:33.860
days but other than that you know it's all good but lots of games and fun stuff and I

06:33.860 --> 06:40.600
did podcasts earlier in the week and we restarted our grand theft auto stats so lots and lots

06:40.600 --> 06:45.520
of fun stuff but yeah ultraviolet for those who are wondering if the movie's good or not

06:45.520 --> 06:49.820
it's okay but it has really bad cg in it and halfway through the movie you're like what

06:49.820 --> 06:55.740
the hell are they trying to do that's about it so yeah all right well we also

06:55.740 --> 06:58.460
have a special guest tonight once in a while we like to invite other people in

06:58.460 --> 07:02.380
the house we've been ignoring him for the past 10 minutes very sorry to spike

07:02.380 --> 07:06.280
say hello to spike I don't mind being ignored but thank you for having me

07:06.280 --> 07:09.460
tonight not a problem it's good to have you here don't be afraid to just put

07:09.460 --> 07:12.000
that mic right there right next to your mouth because otherwise there's their

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
cheap mics their RadioShack mics they don't pick up otherwise so cheap is the

07:16.000 --> 07:20.680
best. There you go. So how are you doing? Doing fantastic. I've been playing Trauma

07:20.680 --> 07:24.480
Center all week. Really? And it's addicted me the way that I thought only

07:24.480 --> 07:29.160
World of Warcraft could. And, well, usually that we kick off the show with

07:29.160 --> 07:33.800
how is your gaming week, so Spike, since you're kicking us off, let's do it. Trauma

07:33.800 --> 07:37.080
Center, is it really as hard as everybody says it is? I haven't really played it. I

07:37.080 --> 07:40.220
have to be honest. I haven't really played it, but I've heard it's insanely hard. I tried

07:40.220 --> 07:43.960
playing it on the subway and almost killed myself, but when I sat down to it,

07:43.960 --> 07:50.880
it, sucked me in like a crazy, massively multiplayer online game. Very addictive, very innovative,

07:50.880 --> 07:54.760
I certainly would like to see another version of it.

07:54.760 --> 07:58.480
I just want to point out, for those asking in the chat room, this is not the same Spike

07:58.480 --> 08:05.200
on DDR Freak, some folks are wondering, this is my buddy Spike, do you really have any

08:05.200 --> 08:09.220
credentials to be on this program? I guess not, but that's okay, you're a gamer, that's

08:09.220 --> 08:13.400
all you need, right Spike? He's laughing.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.400
I hate you.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.400
No, that's alright.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.400
Everybody does.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.400
Alright.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.400
Well, no, we love having you here.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.400
It's different, different Spike.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.040
I know it's exciting news, actually, about Trauma Center.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.400
That's one of the games that's being brought over to the revolution.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.400
Confirmed.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.760
How do you know this, Mr. Man?

08:26.760 --> 08:28.120
Because there's a news story about it.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.120
Oh, okay.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.440
I'm assuming we'll get into that later.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.440
Possibly.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.860
Anything else besides Trauma Center in your week, Spike?

08:34.860 --> 08:41.600
Not DDR Freak Spike, but R-Spike, O-L-R-Spike?

08:41.600 --> 08:45.400
a lot of World of Warcraft, it's pretty pathetic

08:45.400 --> 08:48.940
What kind of character are you in World of Warcraft?

08:48.940 --> 08:52.880
What kind of character are you in World of Warcraft? I just started a Tauren War-

08:52.880 --> 08:58.380
Hunter, and it's quite exciting because it's my first Horde character

08:58.380 --> 09:01.600
and it's quite difficult compared to an Alliance character

09:01.600 --> 09:04.920
You know what, I thought I would hate the Horde when I first started playing

09:04.920 --> 09:06.360
Horde, but I actually kind of enjoy

09:06.360 --> 09:10.200
Horde side, I think a little more than Alliance side. Alliance side is a little

09:10.200 --> 09:13.200
I don't know. It's too much like every other MMO I've played in that sense.

09:13.200 --> 09:19.200
I immediately made an undead. I made my elf, and then I made an undead.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.200
Because I had to have the zombie thing going on.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.200
Like Thriller?

09:23.200 --> 09:26.200
No, no, no. Like Romero Zombie.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.200
Anyway, thank you very much, Spike.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.200
Feel free to give your input on anything throughout the show and all that fun stuff.

09:32.200 --> 09:38.200
And if you have anything to plug, any upcoming projects, anything you're doing, just feel free. Get it out there.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.200
I hear you're a very good DJ. You do DJ stuff, right?

09:41.200 --> 09:42.200
Yes, I do.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.200
Not like podcasting type of DJ stuff, but like spinning?

09:45.200 --> 09:52.200
Like I go to clubs, you know. Right now, the iPod thing is a big deal, but I still say vinyl is the way to go.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.200
There you go. You're just a purist. Nothing wrong with that.

09:55.200 --> 09:59.200
Alright, let's go over to Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week?

09:59.200 --> 10:05.200
Well, my series of gaming weeks, I did play a lot of Animal Crossing and some Popolo Cross.

10:05.200 --> 10:10.120
um although I had to start over because I was on no I actually I didn't I was

10:10.120 --> 10:15.360
going to start over on your PSP and then I realized that it was gonna be on your

10:15.360 --> 10:20.400
memory card I'd too lazy to move it so I just watched tell boy and kill Bill on

10:20.400 --> 10:23.760
the plane going to Alabama that's right somebody somebody borrowed my PSP while

10:23.760 --> 10:29.560
I was gone but that's okay she had that's good I put it in a case and I

10:29.560 --> 10:33.520
cleaned the screen cuz look let me put it this way the last time I played that

10:33.520 --> 10:37.360
was when Luminous was still a new game okay let's just put it that way that PSP

10:37.360 --> 10:42.440
oh no and I checked out OLR PSP on it that's it otherwise that PSP is not

10:42.440 --> 10:47.000
really doing it for me sorry sorry PSP fans I'm just not feeling the love with

10:47.000 --> 10:51.140
the offerings that are out yet but yet Power Stone is coming to the PS that is

10:51.140 --> 10:55.040
true so awesome I love Power Stone there's a lot of sexy shit coming out for the

10:55.040 --> 10:59.520
PSP so I'm glad Jamie cleaned it so that I'm ready it's ready to go for me when I

10:59.520 --> 11:03.160
get it back and can play the you know I want to play that Mega Man stuff and the

11:03.160 --> 11:10.040
um uh Katamari Damacy PSP it's gonna be a good year for PSP so PSP fans you can just stop writing

11:10.040 --> 11:16.440
those angry emails right now it'll be fine I'll get along I'll rediscover my love for PSP just wait

11:16.440 --> 11:23.000
well we've also Dan's been playing uh Phoenix right like all the damn time so I've gotten to

11:23.000 --> 11:28.840
see like the fourth trial the whole thing because he kept making me watch it and it was pretty cool

11:28.840 --> 11:33.400
but I sort of don't need to play now because I know how it goes between him

11:33.400 --> 11:37.420
and Ross you know spoiling it for me I'm eventually gonna play it but you know I

11:37.420 --> 11:44.020
sort of like I can just watch everybody else play it and I think Dan finally

11:44.020 --> 11:52.680
beat Need for Speed underground so that was pretty cool and he's been just

11:52.680 --> 11:56.600
watching a lot of Simpsons so we haven't had a lot of console stuff going on in

11:56.600 --> 12:01.040
the house, although didn't you say you saw him with this astronomically high score for

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
Smash TV?

12:02.040 --> 12:05.940
Yes, and I'm glad, if I can go ahead, I'll get into my gaming week.

12:05.940 --> 12:10.620
I'm sure a lot of folks, when we last left the Orange Lounge Radio crew before the big

12:10.620 --> 12:14.160
vacation, I had my Xbox 360 that went bad.

12:14.160 --> 12:17.520
I had to send it in for a replacement and I've gotten emails asking, did you get the

12:17.520 --> 12:18.520
replacement?

12:18.520 --> 12:23.760
Yes, the replacement came about, not that long after I said, I think it took about two

12:23.760 --> 12:25.520
business days and I had it back.

12:25.520 --> 12:30.200
So it came back pretty quick, but of course I wasn't here to enjoy it, it's just Xtifer,

12:30.200 --> 12:31.820
my roommate, told me it was here.

12:31.820 --> 12:38.880
So when I got back from the trip, I played Xbox 360, that's a lot of what I've been doing

12:38.880 --> 12:43.200
this weekend, and I saw your husband's high score on Smash TV, because that's one of the

12:43.200 --> 12:44.680
games I checked out, Smash TV.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.280
I've been playing hell a lot of the stuff on the Xbox Live Arcade, Crystal Quest, because

12:48.280 --> 12:51.740
I remember that game on the Mac from years ago.

12:51.740 --> 12:53.920
Pretty cool reinterpretation.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.640
Somebody said on our forums that the achievement points were really easy in that game, and

12:57.640 --> 12:58.640
I have to agree.

12:58.640 --> 12:59.640
Really easy.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.200
You want like 50 easy achievement points?

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
There you go.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.840
I wasn't able to get good achievement points on that.

13:03.840 --> 13:07.200
All you have to do, don't use the smart bomb and get all the way to level 30.

13:07.200 --> 13:11.440
That's like 30 points right there for getting that far.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.720
So there's that, and then what else did I play on there?

13:13.720 --> 13:17.240
A little bit of Geometry Wars still, although I haven't gotten much better at that.

13:17.240 --> 13:21.460
And I bought Full Auto, just because of all the good things I heard about it.

13:21.460 --> 13:24.620
from critics, because a lot of critics have bashed it, but from word of mouth, a lot of

13:24.620 --> 13:27.620
people have been saying good things about full auto. So I picked it up, I have to say

13:27.620 --> 13:34.220
I'm enjoying it. I haven't gotten to play a whole lot, but I like it so far. It's racing

13:34.220 --> 13:36.220
with guns, which is never a bad thing.

13:36.220 --> 13:40.500
Wait until you get to the end of the game. Probably if you listened to last week's podcast,

13:40.500 --> 13:44.760
you would have heard me yelling and screaming about the game and saying, God dammit, I fucking

13:44.760 --> 13:50.320
hate this end part of the game. The rewind feature is awesome. I love that. Like, if

13:50.320 --> 13:55.060
I screw up I can just rewind time it's awesome more games need to have Mario

13:55.060 --> 13:57.900
Kart needs that especially online because I screw up too much when I play

13:57.900 --> 14:01.600
online or when people disconnect I'll just rewind so that they didn't just

14:01.600 --> 14:05.740
actually disconnect speaking of DS I also picked up this is a game I was so

14:05.740 --> 14:11.680
looking forward to very excited about Super Princess Peach on the DS I don't

14:11.680 --> 14:15.380
know I'm I don't know if I'm really thrilled with this game it just wasn't

14:15.380 --> 14:19.300
what I expected and maybe that's my own damn fault I didn't really read up on

14:19.300 --> 14:21.920
this game I just assumed oh it will be like Mario Brothers but it'll be

14:21.920 --> 14:24.560
Princess Peach because I heard that like Nintendo is like trying to get back to

14:24.560 --> 14:28.640
their roots especially with like the new Mario DS games coming out I assume that

14:28.640 --> 14:33.760
Princess Peach would be like you know it would be like oh it's like Mario 2 but

14:33.760 --> 14:38.740
on the DS and with Pete whoa was I wrong because this is good this is kind of

14:38.740 --> 14:42.400
funny because the whole concept behind the game is that Princess Peach is

14:42.400 --> 14:47.440
totally emotionally unstable like most women I know just just just kidding you

14:47.440 --> 14:49.480
We need to be quiet, Mr. Ron.

14:49.480 --> 14:53.800
I'm kidding, but seriously, the whole concept of the game is that Princess Peach is emotionally

14:53.800 --> 14:59.080
unstable and you can set things on fire with her anger, you can make the grass grow with

14:59.080 --> 15:05.280
her tears, you can make her life regenerate with her calmness or acid trip, I don't know

15:05.280 --> 15:07.240
what mood that's supposed to be.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.240
But it's very strange.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.300
The power of Prozac.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.100
The way this game controls is very strange.

15:11.100 --> 15:14.040
So if you're thinking you're just getting Mario Bros. with Princess Peach, you're not.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.040
You're not.

15:15.040 --> 15:19.980
It's a little weird like it really put me off when I first started, but now that I'm getting a little more into it

15:19.980 --> 15:23.180
Okay, I think I could play a little further in this game

15:23.180 --> 15:26.640
I don't know if I'm gonna I don't know if it's gonna keep my attention to completion though, which is too bad

15:27.240 --> 15:34.180
Peach doesn't feel like the same character that she is in the other Mario games and in like Mario Party

15:34.180 --> 15:39.320
And I realized maybe part of this is to you know obviously make peach the hero for once

15:39.320 --> 15:44.240
but if you've ever played Mario Party against me you'll know that peach is

15:44.240 --> 15:48.560
always the hero of Mario Party because I always play peach and I always win so

15:48.560 --> 15:56.200
I seem to have a memory of beating you before sir. Peach is always a hero in some other cases so

15:56.200 --> 16:02.160
whatever anyway so super princess peach it's okay I check it out if the genre

16:02.160 --> 16:07.240
interests you but I don't know as a peach fan the something about it's a

16:07.240 --> 16:11.680
little off-putting I can't put my finger on it I'm sorry to say so that was my

16:11.680 --> 16:18.000
gaming week Loki how about you I played full auto I finished the game 100% I'm

16:18.000 --> 16:23.880
just giving the last few achievements online I've gotten up on to rank 3 now

16:23.880 --> 16:29.860
online because for some reason it's not counting all the ranked races I'm doing

16:29.860 --> 16:34.400
I raced about six different races today and only counted two of them which

16:34.400 --> 16:39.360
Which ironically enough were the best ones I did, so that worked out in my favor.

16:39.360 --> 16:43.860
But still though, I spent all that time to play people and they freaking drop like mad.

16:43.860 --> 16:47.480
It's crazy, it's like Mario Kart but worse.

16:47.480 --> 16:51.320
Still really fun though, and you get to play in some of the races.

16:51.320 --> 16:56.480
I found my strategy though was the same during the multiplayer games as in my single player

16:56.480 --> 17:00.860
games where I drop a lot of bombs behind me and just get ahead of the pack and I just

17:00.860 --> 17:03.180
take people out as I'm driving.

17:03.180 --> 17:04.180
And it worked really well.

17:04.180 --> 17:07.180
in the first place that way.

17:07.180 --> 17:10.220
But the game is really fun.

17:10.220 --> 17:15.620
Really frustrating in the gang war section of the game, but I finally got gold on those

17:15.620 --> 17:20.800
and once I was done with that I was like, finally, really rewarding.

17:20.800 --> 17:24.980
Other than that, I've been trying to get into some more of the Xbox Live Arcade games, played

17:24.980 --> 17:32.360
a little bit more, Hexic HD, trying to actually become good at that game, but I can't.

17:32.360 --> 17:39.540
trade gauntlet and suck at gauntlet still and then I'm looking forward to burnout which is coming out this week and

17:39.800 --> 17:43.300
Also goes to recon advanced warfighter. So two more the start off

17:43.300 --> 17:48.120
I'm glad I finished full auto because you know, I have to start burnout, you know, I'm a burnout whore

17:48.120 --> 17:52.840
So isn't burnout out this week. It comes out in the seventh. I think or not the seventh

17:54.400 --> 17:58.720
7th or 8th, I can't remember. Okay, that's this week. It is this week. Yeah, very exciting

17:58.720 --> 18:05.640
So all right, I'm speaking of gauntlet since you brought up gauntlet in there. I'm gonna go to our chat room now. Finally. Sorry chat room

18:05.640 --> 18:07.640
I'm not ignoring you guys. I know you're there

18:08.000 --> 18:13.200
www.orangelawntrader.com click on chat. I'm not don't don't you lies spreading lies?

18:14.360 --> 18:16.360
emotionally unstable woman

18:19.720 --> 18:22.160
Who touched the fire heart who touched it

18:25.720 --> 18:27.720
All right moving on

18:27.720 --> 18:33.160
Let's see Oh check question from chair room hit stun says does gauntlet have online play. Yes

18:33.160 --> 18:37.060
Yes, and that is pretty much what makes pretty much much

18:37.320 --> 18:43.660
It is what mucho makes these games worthwhile on Xbox Live. Otherwise, I would say

18:44.180 --> 18:47.840
Frickin go get Midway arcade classics. It's got every single game

18:47.840 --> 18:54.100
They're offering on live and if but but the online play is what makes these worth the five bucks a pop

18:54.720 --> 18:56.720
It's sometimes hard to find an opponent

18:56.720 --> 19:02.960
but it's fun you know and that's the only way that gauntlet remains fun after

19:02.960 --> 19:06.640
the first few levels for me honestly is to have four people playing it so

19:06.640 --> 19:10.180
definitely you know if you're you want to get it back in the gauntlet check it

19:10.180 --> 19:16.320
out on xbox live because you can do the co-op thing so pretty exciting if you

19:16.320 --> 19:22.760
guys want to participate www.orangelawnsradio.com click on chat and of course

19:22.760 --> 19:28.160
You guys are always free to disagree with us DMN says I disagree with your opinion on peach sky

19:28.300 --> 19:31.100
Well, that's you know, and you know what my opinion might change

19:31.100 --> 19:36.540
I've changed my opinion on games when I go back and play them for a longer time as I'm sure some of you guys have

19:36.540 --> 19:40.220
Done as well as that sometimes like it you could the CD a movie you watch it

19:40.220 --> 19:43.980
Listen to it the first time and you think this sucks and go back later and it's actually really good

19:43.980 --> 19:47.860
Same thing happen was games all the time. So, you know, I reserve the right to change my opinion

19:47.860 --> 19:53.700
Nothing is ever cemented, but I don't know. I don't I can't see my opinion changing on this, but we'll see. We'll see

19:54.580 --> 20:01.620
huh, I have to say something about katsu khan which is where I went part of my trip where I was at I did a

20:01.620 --> 20:06.180
Panel there on Bamani games. I was placed Sunday at 11 a.m

20:06.180 --> 20:11.620
I had a I could count on my hands how many people showed up to my panel and that made me kind of sad

20:12.040 --> 20:15.140
Which is more listeners than we had the first week of this show

20:15.140 --> 20:18.900
So that's okay, but and they were all fans of the podcast which was kind of cool

20:18.900 --> 20:21.180
You know like meet some of our listeners pretty awesome. Yeah

20:22.060 --> 20:27.700
But the problem was is that they put my panel right before the checkout time at the hotel

20:27.940 --> 20:32.860
So everybody was trying to frantically check out of their rooms and figure out whether we're gonna put their luggage for the rest of the day

20:32.980 --> 20:37.420
So nobody really came to my panel which made me a sad panda. Oh, well, maybe next night

20:37.420 --> 20:40.820
We are thinking about going to other cons and stuff. So if you have suggestions

20:40.820 --> 20:45.340
Um, we can't go to everything, but if you, you know, especially California based stuff,

20:45.340 --> 20:48.140
we can certainly try and make an attempt at going to, and I know we've got ideas of our

20:48.140 --> 20:49.940
own, so we'll see what happens.

20:49.940 --> 20:53.980
Um, big thanks to those of you guys who did stop by and say hi at Katsucon.

20:53.980 --> 20:59.360
Also a big, huge thank you to the listener who, um, hooked me up with a Wonderswan color.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.360
That was so awesome.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.360
Did I tell you about that?

21:01.360 --> 21:02.360
I got a Wonderswan color.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.360
That's really cool.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.360
And I love Final Fantasy IV.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.140
So, that's so badass.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.140
I love the Wonderswan color.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.140
And you already know I love Final Fantasy IV.

21:08.140 --> 21:09.140
I don't gotta tell you again.

21:09.140 --> 21:10.140
So.

21:10.140 --> 21:16.740
Alright anyway moving on let's get into this week's news starting off with Loki Loki

21:17.320 --> 21:21.780
You got this you've got the hookup or something this week. Don't you look you what's up?

21:22.560 --> 21:28.260
Destination PlayStation. This is a retail only event that means no press but being that I work in retail

21:28.860 --> 21:30.100
We did get the hookup

21:30.100 --> 21:34.420
I actually got the PowerPoint presentations of a few different companies that we're gonna be there

21:34.420 --> 21:38.360
I'm showing off their games and we got a bunch of different titles as I mentioned last week

21:38.360 --> 21:46.500
Um, we did have some stuff, uh, regarding the, uh, Activision, and now I have, um, the

21:46.500 --> 21:51.860
Vivendi Universal titles that are going to be coming out this year, and a lot of this

21:51.860 --> 21:55.820
stuff hasn't been announced yet, so it's going to be kind of cool, including, um, some of

21:55.820 --> 21:58.740
the Revolution games that are going to be coming out at launch.

21:58.740 --> 22:02.100
Um, but let me just run down the list here of some of the really cool stuff.

22:02.100 --> 22:05.540
Just so you guys know, I, he's actually, and I know this is radio, so you can't, he's actually

22:05.540 --> 22:10.200
looking at a PowerPoint that I'm sure is not supposed to be looked at by us right now,

22:10.200 --> 22:11.260
but it shows.

22:11.260 --> 22:13.480
It's a freaking calendar that just shows.

22:13.480 --> 22:16.740
It looks very official, boys and girls.

22:16.740 --> 22:17.740
This is great.

22:17.740 --> 22:18.740
This is so cool.

22:18.740 --> 22:22.220
Anyways, this is the exact PowerPoint that they're showing at Destination PlayStation,

22:22.220 --> 22:23.220
which is awesome.

22:23.220 --> 22:29.640
But starting off here, we're upcoming this second quarter, we've got Over the Hedge and

22:29.640 --> 22:35.280
X-Men 3, which is no surprise, two games based on upcoming movies.

22:35.280 --> 22:41.160
July or the July through September third quarter we've got the movies x-pack

22:41.160 --> 22:44.460
which is coming out for the PC and expansion to the movies no way I notice

22:44.460 --> 22:47.760
something here okay take x3 for example I see it's bolded and then I see the

22:47.760 --> 22:53.840
legend at the bottom says bold xbox 360 ps3 and or Nintendo I guess an army

22:53.840 --> 22:58.680
center revolution so when it's bolded in April May June is that like hinting is

22:58.680 --> 23:02.440
that just gonna be it means that there's probably an xbox 360 version for x-men

23:02.440 --> 23:05.200
I see because I get look at that goat does that mean we're gonna have like a

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
No, no, I didn't think so

23:08.200 --> 23:10.520
July or quarter three we've got um

23:10.520 --> 23:16.120
Like I said the movies x-pack for PC quake enemy territory for the PC as well as a couple budget tiles

23:16.120 --> 23:20.280
they have Kabbalah's Alaskan adventures for both consoles and PC and

23:20.880 --> 23:24.400
Let's see here. Also for quarter four, of course is gonna be the biggest stuff

23:24.400 --> 23:27.020
You've got I see lots of bolded stuff here. So that's the bold stuff

23:27.020 --> 23:31.480
So this must mean the other consoles are they're expecting them to be well, here's where we're going here

23:31.480 --> 23:36.600
we've got actual launch stuff. This is the new Tony Hawk game, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam,

23:36.600 --> 23:41.400
which is going to be one of the launch titles for the Revolution and for the PS3. We've

23:41.400 --> 23:46.120
got also Marvel Legends, which is going to be kind of a follow-up to the X-Men Legends

23:46.120 --> 23:51.480
series. That's also going to be a launch title for the Revolution and for the PS3.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.320
But when you say launch, couldn't that mean that maybe it doesn't come out like the same week?

23:57.320 --> 24:00.200
it might come out around... It might not come out, it's not gonna come out, well like the

24:00.200 --> 24:05.000
Revolution's slated for around November, so it probably will be a launch title for that.

24:05.000 --> 24:11.220
The PS3, God knows, you know, when that's coming out, so hopefully. Call of Duty 3 is

24:11.220 --> 24:16.680
gonna be another title that's coming out on the Playstation 3, and for the 360, which

24:16.680 --> 24:21.000
is gonna be pretty cool. Call of Duty, also, they're gonna be getting a new version for

24:21.000 --> 24:27.720
the PSP, as well as Gun is coming to the PSP. Chirp Chirp. Hey, Call of Duty is awesome,

24:27.720 --> 24:29.760
okay? No, no, Call of Duty is fine, you just said

24:29.760 --> 24:33.640
Gun and I just, you know. Oh yeah, Gun, yeah. Well, this is the best

24:33.640 --> 24:36.360
one, this one I had to laugh at. I'm going to bargain beneath you.

24:36.360 --> 24:41.340
Okay, these are the bargain titles here. The History Channel presents the Civil War first

24:41.340 --> 24:47.240
person shooter, I might add. So, I don't know exactly how that would work,

24:47.240 --> 24:53.480
I know it takes a long ass time to reload first person. Are you for this shit's fake that out of me

24:53.480 --> 24:58.120
They know that it's better than we have to let me tell you switch. It was supposed to come out last year

24:58.120 --> 25:00.660
I have the sell sheets for this. It looks like the

25:01.280 --> 25:04.520
Biggest piece of crap I've ever seen but it's a budget title

25:05.240 --> 25:09.040
It's it's weird. It's really bad Harley Davison. They're also doing another

25:09.640 --> 25:11.840
Bike game. I mean, come on they had you know

25:12.520 --> 25:14.660
American choppers the game so of course is

25:14.660 --> 25:20.740
this one really got me laughing pimp my ride the game kill me which you know I

25:20.740 --> 25:25.220
thought le rush was pimp my ride the game but whatever that's coming out in

25:25.220 --> 25:29.380
consoles and kabbalahs african safari you know sadly enough people buy those

25:29.380 --> 25:35.800
kabbalahs games a lot but yeah and some other games I should mention for the DS

25:35.800 --> 25:41.420
spider-man kids I don't know what the hell that is and yeah it just a lot of

25:41.420 --> 25:47.340
really bad games. Okay, so that's everything for, I don't know, Civil War First First Shooter.

25:47.340 --> 25:52.140
You kind of have my interest now. I mean, it kind of sounds like one of those you gotta

25:52.140 --> 25:56.180
see it to believe it type things. I can't be the only one who's interested in a very

25:56.180 --> 26:05.660
showgirls kind of way. Now for Vividi Universal we've got 50 Cent. 50 Cent's coming out on

26:05.660 --> 26:10.860
the PSP in fourth quarter. You know, because a year later and the game's still gonna suck.

26:10.860 --> 26:16.140
Crash Festival, a Crash Bandicoot game for the DS, will be coming out also, 4th quarter.

26:16.140 --> 26:18.420
I wondered what ever happened to Crash Bandicoot.

26:18.420 --> 26:21.620
They still make games for that stuff.

26:21.620 --> 26:25.700
You know the last one I ever played with Crash Bandicoot was the little party game they had

26:25.700 --> 26:26.980
on the Playstation.

26:26.980 --> 26:28.060
Like their answer to Mario Party.

26:28.060 --> 26:29.060
Crash Bash?

26:29.060 --> 26:30.060
Yeah, Crash Bash.

26:30.060 --> 26:31.060
What a crap.

26:31.060 --> 26:32.060
What a crap that game was.

26:32.060 --> 26:33.060
I'm sorry.

26:33.060 --> 26:35.180
That was like the worst knockoff game I'd ever seen in my life.

26:35.180 --> 26:40.200
I got a game coming out called Aragon, which is going to be based on a movie that's coming

26:40.200 --> 26:46.960
out around the same time, quarter four, also on the 360 and all the console systems.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.720
Actually it's pretty sweet, they've got John Malkovich's in it, it looks like he plays

26:50.720 --> 26:55.240
like a troll or something, I don't know, that's kind of neat.

26:55.240 --> 27:00.400
But it's definitely going to be a lot better than In the Name of the King, an Ui Bo crap

27:00.400 --> 27:03.360
fest.

27:03.360 --> 27:08.000
Let's see, of course a bunch of other movie tie-ins here, Miami Vice, of course with the

27:08.000 --> 27:12.060
movie that's coming out you know also a console game moving on Scarface coming

27:12.060 --> 27:15.220
out in September that one actually looks pretty sweet because it's kind of you

27:15.220 --> 27:20.660
know my it's like Vice City but actually you know without ripping off Scarface

27:20.660 --> 27:26.660
because it is Scarface so it's ripping off a ripoff of itself something like

27:26.660 --> 27:31.740
that that's kind of neat okay flat out to one of my you know kind of favorite

27:31.740 --> 27:35.660
games that came out a while ago where you get to eject the driver through the

27:35.660 --> 27:42.040
Windshield that's coming out now in June so look for that and finally a new Spyro

27:42.040 --> 27:47.160
game coming out around November here Spyro the or Legend of Spyro a new

27:47.160 --> 27:51.000
beginning and that's coming out in all the systems in October actually. See I

27:51.000 --> 27:55.220
always thought Crash and Spyro like ran away together to the land of

27:55.220 --> 28:01.640
oversaturation and made like a million babies or something. Yeah I don't know

28:01.640 --> 28:08.260
And then then there's another crappy game here called mock which is for the PSP and it looks like crap some

28:08.260 --> 28:12.860
Air pollution like airplane if you like airplane combat game boom-boom shoot them up top gun

28:12.860 --> 28:17.860
But uh, oh and I forgot I had EA's lineup to just real quick though

28:17.860 --> 28:19.860
There's only a couple that are worth mentioning

28:20.140 --> 28:28.080
There anytime soon Superman Returns coming out in June June 26 currently and Laura be based on the Superman 64 engine

28:28.080 --> 28:34.100
No, it will not be. Actually, you know what? I have seen the video for this. They released

28:34.100 --> 28:36.840
a trailer for it and it actually looks really good. It's going to have 80 square miles of

28:36.840 --> 28:42.720
metropolis that you get to fly around in with all the buildings and everything. Really cool

28:42.720 --> 28:48.240
and they've got Metallo in there, giant robot you get to fight and stuff. I don't know.

28:48.240 --> 28:53.020
And then Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth 2 for Xbox 360, 10 of the league right

28:53.020 --> 28:55.200
now for June 13th.

28:55.200 --> 28:59.700
speaking of the land of oversaturation

28:59.700 --> 29:01.200
now now

29:01.200 --> 29:04.640
sorry i've been gone for a couple weeks i'm a little feisty tonight

29:04.640 --> 29:08.320
that that's all we got so far i'm still waiting to get back from uh...

29:08.320 --> 29:11.360
cuz a lot of people right now destination playstation you know was

29:11.360 --> 29:14.780
taking place this week and a lot of people are still busy

29:14.780 --> 29:16.720
i'll get some more info later on

29:16.720 --> 29:20.480
you know dark tetsuya has an interesting point about the uh... civil war uh...

29:20.480 --> 29:21.800
first-person shooter

29:21.800 --> 29:25.680
if that is historically accurate then you will be spending more time reloading

29:25.680 --> 29:27.480
than firing exactly like that

29:27.480 --> 29:30.440
they'd like to do you remember like seeing this industry class like with

29:30.440 --> 29:32.680
the power back in the gun to take forever

29:32.680 --> 29:35.300
and all that stuff

29:35.300 --> 29:39.340
make for some mean online play

29:39.340 --> 29:42.360
you think about that you have a fifteen minute match you can only fire fifteen

29:42.360 --> 29:44.440
shots

29:44.440 --> 29:47.320
to make those count

29:47.320 --> 29:50.780
moving on uh... line i'd notice i was gone

29:50.780 --> 29:54.100
people got really freaked out about this Microsoft origami

29:54.100 --> 29:58.300
like you know up here it is Microsoft sent entering the handheld market

29:58.300 --> 30:03.180
here it is the origami is their answer to the PSP and the DS right

30:03.180 --> 30:07.260
here here's my thing okay what about the origami the origami is a stupid name

30:07.260 --> 30:08.220
you know I'm sorry

30:08.220 --> 30:11.340
because it makes me want to fold it and you don't do that you don't fold

30:11.340 --> 30:14.620
a Microsoft equipment here's the thing about the origami though it reminds me

30:14.620 --> 30:15.260
of like

30:15.260 --> 30:18.460
how cell phones are you know cell phones now

30:18.460 --> 30:23.180
teeny tiny just like you know the gameboy micro teeny tiny you know the psp not so tiny but still

30:23.180 --> 30:31.260
pretty tiny origami is like cell phones from the 80s where it's like you know some ginormous device

30:31.820 --> 30:36.540
which i'd expect they should have called it the microsoft brick because that's what it looks like

30:36.540 --> 30:42.220
it looks like a brick in the sense that i can possibly you know haul that with me you know i

30:42.220 --> 30:47.300
I can't stick it in a pocket unless I'm like five billion pounds and have pants the size

30:47.300 --> 30:49.900
of a parachute or something.

30:49.900 --> 30:52.820
The Microsoft Doorstop, now with Halo.

30:52.820 --> 30:56.020
By the way, it doesn't play Halo.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.020
Here it is kids, here it is.

30:58.020 --> 31:05.340
Now the word's coming out that it is not actually their answer to the PSP or DS, so sit down,

31:05.340 --> 31:11.460
because what this is is actually it is their first in a line of paperback sized computers.

31:11.460 --> 31:13.660
So what the hell was the Halo thing?

31:13.660 --> 31:17.940
It was running Halo on Windows XP, is what they say, because it's like a portable computer.

31:17.940 --> 31:18.940
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:18.940 --> 31:19.940
Paperback size.

31:19.940 --> 31:24.820
Okay, I know what the size of a paperback book is, okay, if this thing is like the paperback

31:24.820 --> 31:30.340
size of like a phone book, I mean, apparently the paperback in question is War and Peace,

31:30.340 --> 31:31.900
apparently.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.380
I don't know.

31:33.380 --> 31:36.260
I guess, but see- The Bible.

31:36.260 --> 31:41.500
with like with with with the Book of Mormon as the AC adapter or something I

31:41.500 --> 31:46.380
mean you know it's the size of the unabridged dictionary all right anyway

31:46.380 --> 31:53.180
all kidding aside okay so Microsoft's gonna have this tiny and I use that term

31:53.180 --> 31:58.020
very loosely tiny computer coming out soon called the origami but you know you

31:58.020 --> 32:04.160
know I people are saying it's not a handheld but could correct me if I'm

32:04.160 --> 32:09.600
wrong if the damn thing hooks up to all of Microsoft's other stuff, couldn't you theoretically

32:09.600 --> 32:16.280
get some perks as an origami owner such as maybe Xbox 360 demos, movies on your origami?

32:16.280 --> 32:18.520
Couldn't that still be something that's an option?

32:18.520 --> 32:21.240
Oh, of course you earned the reticle of all your friends.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.240
This made me laugh.

32:22.240 --> 32:25.880
Okay, Game Informer is trying to guess what you could use the origami for and one of the

32:25.880 --> 32:28.680
things they said is a secondary screen for your 360.

32:28.680 --> 32:33.160
I'm like yeah, I'm gonna go out there and spend $500 on a crappy little screen

32:33.680 --> 32:37.420
For that could possibly be used in the game is like a status screen or something like a DS

32:38.080 --> 32:42.720
No, I'll tell you what the origami can be used for oh shit. I got a crooked nail

32:45.920 --> 32:47.920
You killed the penguin

32:50.240 --> 32:54.000
People out in the living room we're probably going what the hell are they doing on this show tonight alright anyway

32:54.000 --> 32:59.780
What aren't we doing you know what if someone could be bludgeoned to death with an iPod man that that origami is

33:00.160 --> 33:02.160
Give me some deadly stuff there

33:04.440 --> 33:07.200
Well you know since you pissed off enough Mac users

33:07.200 --> 33:11.360
We've got a you know we'll get the hate mail for Microsoft fans this week. It's just you know turnabouts fairplay

33:12.440 --> 33:17.360
Right you know that's the thing as seriously as like the size of like one of those old speaking all right

33:17.760 --> 33:19.720
Let's move on moving on

33:19.720 --> 33:21.720
dark Sakura

33:21.720 --> 33:25.980
Something that you might be able to play on the Microsoft origami world of war crack

33:26.820 --> 33:32.420
There's that there is that it actually are up to six million woohoo

33:34.020 --> 33:40.700
But yeah as a result they're working on a Spanish version of World of Warcraft in

33:41.380 --> 33:46.340
Addition to what's the other three languages they have out of in Europe right now. Yeah, so

33:47.220 --> 33:49.220
We get the Spanish version

33:49.220 --> 33:59.460
L computer es en fuego. Lucha libre on Telemundo. You know, when I play World of Warcraft on

33:59.460 --> 34:05.940
my iBook, it does feel like, you know, it's en fuego. You know what, that's actually all

34:05.940 --> 34:12.580
of the Spanish I know is el telefono es en fuego. And lucha libre on Telemundo. I just,

34:12.580 --> 34:16.420
donde esta el bano. Because it's all about Mexican wrestling. Donde esta el bano, that's

34:16.420 --> 34:17.420
That's all you need to know.

34:17.420 --> 34:18.420
If you're gonna go to Mexico.

34:18.420 --> 34:19.420
Where's the potty?

34:19.420 --> 34:20.420
Yeah.

34:20.420 --> 34:21.420
Oh.

34:21.420 --> 34:22.420
You got it!

34:22.420 --> 34:23.420
See?

34:23.420 --> 34:24.420
You know what?

34:24.420 --> 34:25.420
You know more Spanish.

34:25.420 --> 34:26.420
You're lying.

34:26.420 --> 34:27.420
Okay, I know Latin, and I took French.

34:27.420 --> 34:28.420
Just unstable tonight.

34:28.420 --> 34:29.420
Totally unstable.

34:29.420 --> 34:30.420
Shut up!

34:30.420 --> 34:31.420
Okay, you know what?

34:31.420 --> 34:32.420
Kisses.

34:32.420 --> 34:33.420
All right.

34:33.420 --> 34:34.420
Yeah, right.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.420
You know what?

34:35.420 --> 34:36.420
I'm sorry, I'm feisty tonight.

34:36.420 --> 34:37.420
Maybe I'm the emotionally unstable one.

34:37.420 --> 34:38.420
It's fine.

34:38.420 --> 34:39.420
Loki, you also have a wow story.

34:39.420 --> 34:43.380
Yes, this is how you can become a part of the beta for the World of Warcraft Burning

34:43.380 --> 34:44.380
Crusade.

34:44.380 --> 34:46.380
And no, that's not an STD.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.220
They have three different things that are going to be going on.

34:48.220 --> 34:53.900
The first is a race to level 50 contest, and that's basically just like it sounds.

34:53.900 --> 34:59.280
You take a new character and see how quickly you can get to level 50, and hopefully the

34:59.280 --> 35:06.020
top 1,000 will secure the right to be able to be part of the beta.

35:06.020 --> 35:12.100
The second competition is called the Battle for Warsong Gulch, and it's basically a level

35:12.100 --> 35:22.600
19 capped battle and yeah the top 500 players for that are going to be able to be part of

35:22.600 --> 35:30.220
the beta for that and finally the most level 25 characters contest and just like it sounds

35:30.220 --> 35:35.580
the top 1000 people who can get the most characters that are level 25 and above get to also be

35:35.580 --> 35:37.300
part of the beta.

35:37.300 --> 35:41.660
So in other words if you don't have a job and you have a lot of time to spare here's

35:41.660 --> 35:46.460
something you can work towards to make your internet penis take your leave I

35:46.460 --> 35:50.180
mean look at that though it's perfectly you know you have people that can level

35:50.180 --> 35:53.700
their characters quickly now we can test a lot of stuff for this you know beta

35:53.700 --> 35:59.140
and it makes sense you don't want people that can actually play the game they're

35:59.140 --> 36:05.060
encouraging people to not have a life anyway whatever I just found a reason to

36:05.060 --> 36:10.140
take my vacation time I'm happy nerd all right moving on I also have a wow story

36:10.140 --> 36:13.560
those you got you know how the rumors are going around that the World of

36:13.560 --> 36:20.580
Warcraft is going to come out on the Xbox 360 not not so even though Squeenix

36:20.580 --> 36:26.780
is bringing over Final Fantasy 11 to the 360 MCV the Interactive Entertainment

36:26.780 --> 36:33.700
Weekly is and saying that the Blizzard chief operating officer Paul Sam said we

36:33.700 --> 36:39.820
do not have any plans to take Wow to Xbox 360 Wow is a is built as a PC

36:39.820 --> 36:45.140
gaming experience, porting PC games to console often compromises games and we

36:45.140 --> 36:50.660
would never allow the WoW gameplay experience to suffer so and doesn't

36:50.660 --> 36:56.340
sound like it's gonna happen. To counter that, according to the VOIP blog World of Warcraft is

36:56.340 --> 37:01.580
indeed going to debut on the 360 this is of course coming about a day after they

37:01.580 --> 37:05.180
announced that it wasn't and apparently the whole thing is they're going to

37:05.180 --> 37:09.380
announce some sort of secret partnership at E3 and of course that sounds like a

37:09.380 --> 37:16.000
bunch of fan-based speculation to me with all due respect to that blog in

37:16.000 --> 37:21.180
question hmm blog chief operating officer of blizzard it's hard to say

37:21.180 --> 37:24.280
which one's more believable but you know it's not like these guys I'm gonna go

37:24.280 --> 37:27.620
with blog it's not like these guys haven't lied before to the blog's credit

37:27.620 --> 37:32.100
they could totally make a 180 on this statement and we would just look like

37:32.100 --> 37:41.100
asses again moving on new story Loki we were talking about gauntlet on Xbox Live

37:41.100 --> 37:45.180
Arcade the funny done yet right of course not there's gonna be some more

37:45.180 --> 37:49.180
Midway games coming to the Xbox Live Arcade one of my favorites paper boy

37:49.180 --> 37:54.820
paper boy is coming of course and root beer tapper that's gonna be really good

37:54.820 --> 37:58.700
I own it that game it's on but we're tapping is not really to player it's not

37:58.700 --> 38:02.580
two-player co-op, so I don't think they're going to have to get creative with that one

38:02.580 --> 38:03.900
to make that a worthwhile purchase.

38:03.900 --> 38:08.100
Same thing with Paperboy, they weren't really, you know, the enticing thing about the Midway

38:08.100 --> 38:13.100
games is that they're co-op and stuff, but those games aren't really multiplayer at once.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.760
Defender is also coming.

38:15.760 --> 38:21.860
Some other stuff that will be heading our way is going to be Cyberball, some sort of

38:21.860 --> 38:25.140
robot football game that was kind of crap.

38:25.140 --> 38:31.100
And then finally of course the best one, Mortal Kombat 3, or Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is going

38:31.100 --> 38:35.500
to be coming to combat, of course, Street Fighter 2.

38:35.500 --> 38:40.420
Why Mortal Kombat 3, which I would say is the worst one in the entire series, sorry,

38:40.420 --> 38:42.540
I even prefer Mortal Kombat 4 over Mortal Kombat 3.

38:42.540 --> 38:44.420
Mortal Kombat 2 is the top of the series.

38:44.420 --> 38:47.660
I know, Mortal Kombat 2 is the top, I don't think there's any dispute in that, but I even

38:47.660 --> 38:51.820
prefer, and I know like people totally disagree, I prefer Mortal Kombat 4 to 3, I did not like

38:51.820 --> 38:52.820
3 at all.

38:52.820 --> 38:53.820
It just...

38:53.820 --> 38:57.020
the beta versions of Mortal Kombat 2

38:57.020 --> 39:00.940
Mortal Kombat 2 is awesome. Why three? Why are they coming out with three? Why not two?

39:00.940 --> 39:02.060
People want two

39:02.060 --> 39:05.380
I don't know. Be glad you're getting

39:05.380 --> 39:09.180
any Mortal Kombat. No, I will not. I'm not spending five dollars on Mortal Kombat 3

39:09.180 --> 39:11.780
especially especially when I already have

39:11.780 --> 39:15.980
arcade legends. Who says it's going to be five dollars? Watch when Street Fighter 2 comes out

39:15.980 --> 39:19.140
I bet you it'll probably be like ten bucks. F that

39:19.140 --> 39:22.860
pretty soon you'll be paying like for forty dollar games online

39:22.860 --> 39:27.300
moving on

39:27.300 --> 39:30.540
Dark Sakura has a story

39:30.540 --> 39:35.100
about parents and video games and all that fun stuff

39:35.100 --> 39:40.180
what's up? parents and video games well

39:40.180 --> 39:43.340
video games worst

39:43.340 --> 39:46.620
enemy is lazy parents

39:46.620 --> 39:50.460
how many times have I said this? I know I'm kinda like

39:50.460 --> 39:53.980
even when I was like looking over this week's story I was kinda like this is news

39:53.980 --> 39:56.500
but you know it's it's nice to see that the media is kind of you know

39:56.500 --> 39:57.520
acknowledging that

39:57.520 --> 40:00.980
it's not always you know doom and gloom

40:00.980 --> 40:04.220
the gamers fault and the the you know it

40:04.220 --> 40:07.420
everybody is equally to blame sometimes

40:07.420 --> 40:10.660
I don't know well there's

40:10.660 --> 40:16.140
this legislation going into actually

40:16.140 --> 40:19.860
and this is actually something else I was a reading on a number of sites

40:19.860 --> 40:25.280
there's actually new legislation to have the game ratings redone which is

40:25.280 --> 40:29.640
actually pretty stupid a lot of people are protesting it well I think it's okay

40:29.640 --> 40:33.180
if they want to do it like I like we've suggested on this program before and I

40:33.180 --> 40:38.700
think is the way they do it in the UK in UK oh oh yeah in the UK it's fine

40:38.700 --> 40:42.700
doesn't it mirror the movies it does but there's a change that one of the Labour

40:42.700 --> 40:47.660
Party folks is trying is lobbying to to change it why would you change it when I

40:47.660 --> 40:50.060
I think that's the way that makes the most sense is to mirror the movies

40:50.060 --> 40:53.700
because people understand movie ratings they don't understand for whatever

40:53.700 --> 40:57.940
reason they don't understand game ratings but they understand pg-13 okay

40:57.940 --> 41:02.700
are might have titties don't take the kids well well now they're having this

41:02.700 --> 41:09.220
mum's army business over there as mama's and mother I what with what little I

41:09.220 --> 41:16.700
know of British culture I do know that one but they're saying that the games

41:16.700 --> 41:20.540
responsible for all kinds of social problems like drug and alcohol abuse, gang

41:20.540 --> 41:33.580
membership, and gangster rap. Dude, I'm gonna play some Katamari Dimashio. But

41:33.580 --> 41:41.340
seriously, there was, you know, there's actually an interesting comment on here

41:41.340 --> 41:45.820
that's a political movement launched by the same people who show a story of a

41:45.820 --> 41:52.820
a woman crippled by 40 to 60 orgasms a day. How can that be credible? That's like...

41:54.140 --> 41:58.140
It's kind of awesome. That's like reading the sun or something,

41:58.140 --> 42:02.940
you know, or like the enquirer. Alright, well...

42:02.940 --> 42:07.960
But they're saying that video games, which to quote glorify, pimping drug dealing and

42:07.960 --> 42:12.980
street murders, but they don't make a logical connection to trying to control what their

42:12.980 --> 42:16.460
children are playing basically they're blaming the games not blaming themselves

42:16.460 --> 42:22.420
for taking responsibility for what their children are doing excuse me we've been

42:22.420 --> 42:25.980
doing this show for four years and didn't I see that from like well not

42:25.980 --> 42:30.660
quite day one but sort of around you know the first year I started my whole

42:30.660 --> 42:34.300
campaign against parents doing their freaking job that's what makes this news

42:34.300 --> 42:40.060
is that finally you know there's you know anyway it's ridiculous it really is

42:40.060 --> 42:43.340
ridiculous and honestly I feel like writing them and going um why don't you

42:43.340 --> 42:48.540
just try parenting your children moving on we do now on the flip side we have a

42:48.540 --> 42:53.140
we have a good piece about parenting and stuff later so please you know if you're

42:53.140 --> 42:55.740
gonna send hate mail right now wait because we have another story coming up

42:55.740 --> 42:59.460
I've fully gone on and said for those for those of you parents who are taking

42:59.460 --> 43:04.360
an active partner you know I it's a partnership it you know they have

43:04.360 --> 43:07.860
responsibility to put the information out there and market it correctly but

43:07.860 --> 43:11.100
the parents have the responsibility to take that information and use it wisely.

43:11.100 --> 43:18.060
There you go. Something that may not be so wise I caught this like it's a little

43:18.060 --> 43:22.820
it's a little little piece on Kotaku this week little piece and that's about

43:22.820 --> 43:25.860
all the engage deserves in fact I thought the engage was dead and gone but

43:25.860 --> 43:31.900
no civilization just recently came out on the engage like this week and I seem

43:31.900 --> 43:37.460
to remember playing this at E3 last year I got so frustrated civilization is

43:37.460 --> 43:40.960
probably my favorite computer game of all time and granted I think this one's

43:40.960 --> 43:45.920
based off of Civ 2, the Civ 2 engine, I got frustrated after like two minutes I

43:45.920 --> 43:51.200
couldn't I could not stand I was like what happened to my game what why why

43:51.200 --> 43:55.360
god why I was like crying in the middle of the Engage booth I had to be removed

43:55.360 --> 44:00.140
but anyway if you're a Civ fan and you happen to own an Engage or you need a

44:00.140 --> 44:04.720
reason to you know keep your Engage or need something on you I guess here it is

44:04.720 --> 44:11.280
civilization finally out enjoy and then you know kick your engage because it's

44:11.280 --> 44:20.080
you know not that great moving on Loki yes interesting story actually coming

44:20.080 --> 44:26.800
out about the Sims and basically EA and Depeche Mode have collaborated on a

44:26.800 --> 44:31.720
signature song for Sims 2 open for business and it's actually funny because

44:31.720 --> 44:42.280
Because this song playing, or I guess the first ever Simlish language song, Suffer Well,

44:42.280 --> 44:47.280
a popular track by Depeche Mode, will be in the game.

44:47.280 --> 44:53.160
And I don't know how you can listen to Depeche Mode in that weird language.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.160
That's just weird.

44:54.160 --> 44:55.160
That's unusual.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.280
I don't know.

44:57.280 --> 44:58.480
That's a weird pairing to me.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.120
Depeche Mode in The Sims.

45:00.120 --> 45:01.120
I don't know.

45:01.120 --> 45:06.220
worked for the Black Eyed Peas but okay Depeche Mode Black Eyed Peas not quite the same

45:06.220 --> 45:10.320
type of band it might have worked better if they picked a good Depeche Mode song

45:10.320 --> 45:14.360
yeah I know but there haven't been any good Depeche Mode songs in the past 10

45:14.360 --> 45:22.480
years now my question is the last album was really freaking good okay now my

45:22.480 --> 45:37.600
My question is, is this song for like, since this is basically the storefront Sims expansion,

45:37.600 --> 45:42.540
is this for like the Hot Topic type of story that's going to be in the game where you get

45:42.540 --> 45:46.320
to, I don't know, I've got nothing.

45:46.320 --> 45:51.000
I find it interesting because I remember the Black Eyed Peas did a Simlish song for the

45:51.000 --> 45:55.220
the Herbs Games, and I don't recall that having any great success. I'm curious why they would

45:55.220 --> 45:56.220
try this sort of thing again."

45:56.220 --> 46:00.220
Because Depeche Mode is like,

46:00.220 --> 46:04.220
Oh, last album sucks so bad! Please someone listen to it!

46:04.220 --> 46:08.220
Alright,

46:08.220 --> 46:12.220
let's let Jamie have a witty retort here at this time with

46:12.220 --> 46:16.220
her website of the week! Yay, we love Jamie's website of the week!

46:16.220 --> 46:20.220
My website of the week? Hey, I was trying to make

46:20.220 --> 46:24.220
a comment before you started that. It's just especially significant.

46:24.220 --> 46:36.380
today's website of the week is the website for warp 11 because they rock

46:36.380 --> 46:43.620
if you go to warp 11.com and it's the numbers 11 not like spelled out this is

46:43.620 --> 46:49.540
basically a Star Trek themed band I went to see this last night at the blue lamp

46:49.540 --> 46:54.060
and downtown Sacramento and they're just so awesome because their songs are all

46:54.060 --> 47:02.060
about sex and Star Trek except for the wait a minute those are two things that

47:02.060 --> 47:07.900
I never would have imagined ever went together and drugs Wow

47:07.900 --> 47:14.060
there's actually I think a song that's just about various drugs in Star Trek

47:14.060 --> 47:19.460
And, of course, they did the best, my favorite of their songs, they did Montalban.

47:19.460 --> 47:23.700
Have you ever seen that old Saturday Night Live sketch with William Shatner going to

47:23.700 --> 47:28.300
the Star Trek convention and he goes, Hey, you, in the back, have you ever gotten laid?

47:28.300 --> 47:29.300
Remember that?

47:29.300 --> 47:30.300
Hilarious.

47:30.300 --> 47:31.300
Sorry.

47:31.300 --> 47:32.300
Sorry.

47:32.300 --> 47:33.700
I didn't mean to intrude on the website.

47:33.700 --> 47:35.820
Check bands get laid with each other.

47:35.820 --> 47:39.900
But this band is also really, I don't know.

47:39.900 --> 47:41.900
I'm a closet Trekkie.

47:41.900 --> 47:44.620
Well, here we go.

47:44.620 --> 47:45.620
I will make you feel better.

47:45.620 --> 47:46.620
Okay?

47:46.620 --> 47:47.620
I'm going to, because I've been pretty harsh tonight.

47:47.620 --> 47:51.220
I'm going to give you the greatest blackmail ammo of all time.

47:51.220 --> 47:52.560
Are you ready?

47:52.560 --> 47:56.660
In high school, senior year, I was vice president of the Star Trek club.

47:56.660 --> 47:57.660
Checky!

47:57.660 --> 47:58.660
There you go.

47:58.660 --> 47:59.660
Do you feel better?

47:59.660 --> 48:00.660
I feel somewhat better.

48:00.660 --> 48:01.660
Alright.

48:01.660 --> 48:06.940
But um, but no, just like freaking go look at the, on the link for music.

48:06.940 --> 48:08.580
It has the lyrics to Montalban up there.

48:08.580 --> 48:10.580
It's like the best lyrics ever.

48:10.580 --> 48:18.140
there's also mp3 samples on the site which you know we should we'll play

48:18.140 --> 48:22.940
eventually I actually on my show I play a lot of warp 11 anyway because I love

48:22.940 --> 48:28.140
warp 11 and I think that off of their most recent album which is called a

48:28.140 --> 48:34.160
boldly go down on me welcome to our cube is probably my favorite song that one

48:34.160 --> 48:39.540
and captain caught me on the holodeck red alert is also a really good album

48:39.540 --> 48:46.560
just because of seven of mine it's it's such a such a really really cool band I

48:46.560 --> 48:49.860
will say this and to kind of bring it back to gaming a little bit also in

48:49.860 --> 48:53.100
Trekkies too all right the movie right to bring it back to gaming a little bit

48:53.100 --> 48:57.860
I do think that Star Trek MMO is a pretty good idea I think that'll I think

48:57.860 --> 49:01.740
that'll be great so we'll see one more one more details come out I think it'll

49:01.740 --> 49:04.760
be pretty cool one other thing I'd like though to point out about the site

49:04.760 --> 49:08.280
people everyone should go to the photos look at the Halloween photos with them

49:08.280 --> 49:15.900
dressed as Star Wars characters all right dark soccer's website of the week

49:15.900 --> 49:20.780
enjoy moving on this is this this article has kind of been floating around

49:20.780 --> 49:23.220
the internet for a couple weeks keep in mind we haven't done a show in a couple

49:23.220 --> 49:26.500
weeks so we have to catch up on a couple things that we missed but this was run

49:26.500 --> 49:31.660
on MSNBC newsweek this is interesting there's a game coming out it's called

49:31.660 --> 49:39.100
Left Behind Eternal Forces. Left Behind is this book series of I guess they're

49:39.100 --> 49:42.540
Christian oriented books about what the rapture and the people to get left

49:42.540 --> 49:47.260
behind right. So basically what happens is that it's supposed to be taking place

49:47.260 --> 49:51.480
in Manhattan but the level of violence is supposed to be reminiscent of Grand

49:51.480 --> 49:55.360
Theft Auto according to this story. It's about New Yorkers who are left behind

49:55.360 --> 50:04.960
behind after the rapture, they scour the streets for converts, train people to be a workforce

50:04.960 --> 50:11.120
to feed, shelter, and join the resistance against the growing forces of the antichrist,

50:11.120 --> 50:13.540
is what this game is all about.

50:13.540 --> 50:15.560
Which meets with a resounding, okay?

50:15.560 --> 50:18.720
Yeah, but it sounds like I had that thought up.

50:18.720 --> 50:21.080
I don't know, it's just kind of like, oh really?

50:21.080 --> 50:25.120
It sounds like GTA meets Shin Megami Tensei, I'm almost interested.

50:25.120 --> 50:30.520
Here's the part about getting the hooker in the car and then killing her, I mean, where's

50:30.520 --> 50:31.520
that?

50:31.520 --> 50:35.680
If this game does not have a sex mini-game that was removed from the game but still left

50:35.680 --> 50:39.640
in the programming, I will not buy it.

50:39.640 --> 50:43.160
Instead of hot coffee, it's hot manna.

50:43.160 --> 50:46.560
Hopefully this game will be less boring than the movie.

50:46.560 --> 50:52.360
And yes, I have watched the movie, and god, I want those two hours back.

50:52.360 --> 50:57.360
Speaking of stories that are a little bit old, but we want to bring them to your attention

50:57.360 --> 50:58.360
anyway.

50:58.360 --> 50:59.360
Loki?

50:59.360 --> 51:05.840
Anyways, there is a little bit of news going around, I wouldn't really call this news.

51:05.840 --> 51:10.740
The EA Sports Games for PSP, in order to play online, you have to do one of two things.

51:10.740 --> 51:19.940
You have to either sign over your privacy to EA and I believe ESPN to have them send

51:19.940 --> 51:28.040
you spam or pay them $2 and so yeah this has been going on basically brought to

51:28.040 --> 51:32.600
attention again with the release of fight night round three but this is

51:32.600 --> 51:38.960
something that's going on since you know so what's to stop me from going to get a

51:38.960 --> 51:43.160
free gmail account because I know thousands of people with thousands of

51:43.160 --> 51:47.320
invites to gmail even though it's still in beta what's to stop me from getting a

51:47.320 --> 51:52.540
free gmail account and having it be my spam dump ground and signing up with

51:52.540 --> 51:58.820
this address listen it's all about the principle here sure it'd be really easy

51:58.820 --> 52:03.380
to do that and sure and probably lots of people have done that ensure even the

52:03.380 --> 52:06.300
people that have put the legitimate information haven't gotten anything sent

52:06.300 --> 52:11.380
to them but yeah it's about the principle it's a principle the thing

52:11.380 --> 52:14.860
it's like you know two dollars or my email address it's like sell your soul

52:14.860 --> 52:19.060
to the marketing, sell your soul to the band is essentially what they're saying or buy

52:19.060 --> 52:20.060
it back for two dollars.

52:20.060 --> 52:24.060
Well the whole thing it comes down to is this isn't something that's like on the box you

52:24.060 --> 52:29.520
know and it's kind of to hide that in there saying oh yeah by the way if you want to play

52:29.520 --> 52:37.860
online you got to pay us two bucks you know that's kind of not good, shady, shady.

52:37.860 --> 52:42.940
You know what it's just like releasing, re-releasing games onto the 360 without really doing much

52:42.940 --> 52:47.860
other than enhancing the textures a little bit. Yeah, we see you, you know, with Burnout

52:47.860 --> 52:54.860
and, you know, for that, EA's gonna get left behind. Battlefield 2, Gun, all those, half

52:57.580 --> 53:04.580
the 360 games out there. But really, the bigger question is, why are you buying these sports

53:05.260 --> 53:08.760
games anyways? No one plays sports games out there. Because there's a huge, don't you know

53:08.760 --> 53:11.740
like some of the most successful titles over here are sports games? We don't talk about

53:11.740 --> 53:14.700
them so much. There were huge audiences. Well like some of the other titles they mentioned

53:14.700 --> 53:21.100
were like NHL, you know, 2006. I'm like, who plays hockey games? I mean really. Hey,

53:21.100 --> 53:27.020
Blades of Steel was like one of my favorite NES titles ever, so shut your mouth. Well

53:27.020 --> 53:31.580
my favorite thing was how the hell did they have a hockey game anyways when there wasn't

53:31.580 --> 53:38.800
a season in 2005. I still like Super Baseball 3000 for the Neo Geo. One of the best things

53:38.800 --> 53:47.760
about the Genesis was NHL okay pwned oh I'm sorry pull the Canadian card on me

53:47.760 --> 53:53.920
why don't you dark Sakura please take us to a more reasonable time did I mention

53:53.920 --> 53:57.680
we're just a little off tonight we're just kind of something's off I'm always

53:57.680 --> 54:03.160
on I'm so all right then get us back on track with a scary with a reasonable

54:03.160 --> 54:07.880
article here oh this is something we brought up earlier yes well um this is

54:07.880 --> 54:15.500
about parenting and about video games as in gamer parents which I'm going to be

54:15.500 --> 54:19.760
one day you know in fact I actually wrote a nice little rant not too long

54:19.760 --> 54:24.680
ago about you know gamer parents playing with their their children but there's a

54:24.680 --> 54:30.260
lovely little bit of writing out about you know gamer parents and about how you

54:30.260 --> 54:35.140
know through them actually taking an active role in you know the games that

54:35.140 --> 54:40.140
their children play, you know, they're taking responsibility, they're bringing on a new

54:40.140 --> 54:45.260
generation of gamers who have that same healthy attitude, I think.

54:45.260 --> 54:53.820
And you know, instead of, you know, leaving it just as a babysitting tool, it's to balance,

54:53.820 --> 54:59.980
you know, that's a big theme in this is that parents are using this as a tool to help teach

54:59.980 --> 55:04.580
their children and not as a babysitting device.

55:04.580 --> 55:09.620
Some of my fondest memories from being a child, understand that my mother is definitely not

55:09.620 --> 55:13.860
a gamer, and she doesn't even really know how to turn a computer on, like if she needed

55:13.860 --> 55:18.340
something done on the computer, my dad or myself got asked to do it.

55:18.340 --> 55:24.340
Some of the best memories I have of childhood was when she would figure out how to play

55:24.340 --> 55:28.020
the trivia games on the Commodore 64 and we'd play them together.

55:28.020 --> 55:33.020
You know, it's like board game night, but in a different kind of way.

55:33.020 --> 55:36.260
remember that like very vividly when she would like take the effort to try and

55:36.260 --> 55:40.420
like why is Rob so into the computers what I've got the I just remember that

55:40.420 --> 55:44.220
and that you know that's great you know I think it's this generation will

55:44.220 --> 55:48.500
remember that too back when I had my Nintendo my mom and I used to take turns

55:48.500 --> 55:53.260
playing Super Mario Brothers that was also how I developed my blindfold level

55:53.260 --> 55:59.220
eight one skill Wow that's hot I can't do it anymore I mean it's been way too

55:59.220 --> 56:03.660
too long since I've done it but level 8 1 there's like a definite pattern to the

56:03.660 --> 56:06.800
whole stage and it is possible to do it blindfolded there's a pattern really to

56:06.800 --> 56:10.500
the whole game right well not if you have not for the hammer brother levels

56:10.500 --> 56:13.620
because they're all random oh that's true their patterns are random but you

56:13.620 --> 56:17.640
can do level 8 1 blindfolded you can do the first level blindfolded too huh but

56:17.640 --> 56:20.960
yeah but anyway that's how I you know I've learned that by playing with my mom

56:20.960 --> 56:29.200
very cool all right um let's see moving on Loki yes what's going on over at

56:29.200 --> 56:31.440
Konami, our buddies at Konami.

56:31.440 --> 56:35.960
You know, I had to laugh when I read this news about Konami getting in trouble with

56:35.960 --> 56:41.080
the crime life advertisement. First off, the advertisement isn't really that bad anyways,

56:41.080 --> 56:47.720
it's just people overreacting again. But, anyways, the whole, you know, whole thing

56:47.720 --> 56:55.320
about this was that it showed gangsters and, you know, they had guns and stuff, and it's

56:55.320 --> 57:00.540
basically trying to promote violence on the streets or something like that.

57:00.540 --> 57:09.880
So the ASA, the Advertising Standards Authority, they upheld the complaint against it and wanted

57:09.880 --> 57:11.440
them to pull it.

57:11.440 --> 57:16.480
And so, I don't know, I think it's over just, it's really stupid, because when you look

57:16.480 --> 57:20.520
at it, most of the advertisements that we see nowadays are just nothing.

57:20.520 --> 57:24.920
And I don't think that they really take violence and nudity and stuff like that seriously over

57:24.920 --> 57:29.480
were in the UK, at least not as much as we, I mean, we're just like completely conservative

57:29.480 --> 57:32.120
about everything, you know, whereas they're more liberal about it.

57:32.120 --> 57:34.240
I was gonna say rabid, but, you know.

57:34.240 --> 57:36.360
Shouldn't Konami just write off Crime Life at this point?

57:36.360 --> 57:37.360
I mean, really?

57:37.360 --> 57:39.440
Is this a title they need to be backing?

57:39.440 --> 57:40.440
No.

57:40.440 --> 57:43.960
Is one of those, like, let's pay the rent this month type titles?

57:43.960 --> 57:48.840
Let me put it this way, the game initially was gonna come out at about $49.99, they dropped

57:48.840 --> 57:51.600
it to $20, and then-

57:51.600 --> 57:52.600
That tells you a lot right there.

57:52.600 --> 58:01.480
on it just sucked so it was a nice try but you know just just like Nintendo

58:01.480 --> 58:06.640
wrote off the virtual boy I mean a travesty you just got to take your

58:06.640 --> 58:12.480
mistakes and say you know what we messed up all right well we've been in a bit of

58:12.480 --> 58:17.040
a feisty mood tonight you know one reason for that is we're really excited

58:17.040 --> 58:21.520
about something as well that's going on here at Orange Lounge radio and to help

58:21.520 --> 58:24.480
us talk about what's going on here at Orange Launch Radio tonight.

58:24.480 --> 58:27.400
We decided to invite on a very special guest.

58:27.400 --> 58:31.560
We always talk about support, independent podcasting, support podcasters.

58:31.560 --> 58:37.680
We're here to back up what other folks do out there in the independent podcast revolution.

58:37.680 --> 58:41.520
We would not exist without the support of other folks out there.

58:41.520 --> 58:44.600
And one of the folks that's always been very supportive of our show and we just love him

58:44.600 --> 58:49.680
to death is the one and only Bobby Blackwolf from the Bobby Blackwolf show over at AllGames.com

58:49.680 --> 58:51.240
and he's actually on the line with us right now.

58:51.240 --> 58:52.480
Bobby, you there?

58:52.480 --> 58:54.120
Yeah, I am, how are you?

58:54.120 --> 58:55.240
Good, how are you, Bobby?

58:55.240 --> 58:56.080
How was your show tonight?

58:56.080 --> 58:57.140
Good one?

58:57.140 --> 58:58.360
Yeah, it went pretty good.

58:58.360 --> 59:00.400
It's interesting because Bobby and I,

59:00.400 --> 59:03.100
we tape like almost the exact same time,

59:03.100 --> 59:04.560
but it's just because we've done it that way

59:04.560 --> 59:07.380
for a long time, so it just kinda works out that way,

59:07.380 --> 59:08.220
funny sometimes.

59:08.220 --> 59:10.160
But you can download his show as a podcast,

59:10.160 --> 59:11.320
just like you can download ours.

59:11.320 --> 59:13.400
So it allows you to stay in touch with both of them,

59:13.400 --> 59:14.600
so it's awesome. Yep.

59:14.600 --> 59:17.600
All right, so Bobby, tell us first off a little bit

59:17.600 --> 59:19.000
about allgames.com.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.040
What is this website that you're a part of?

59:21.040 --> 59:24.640
Okay, well, it's a sequel to Left Behind.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.640
No, I'm just kidding.

59:26.640 --> 59:31.360
Somebody else is feeling a little feisty tonight.

59:31.360 --> 59:32.360
Sorry.

59:32.360 --> 59:33.360
Yeah.

59:33.360 --> 59:36.000
Allgames.com was started by Scott Rubin about 10 years ago.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.560
A lot of people here may recognize the name Scott Rubin from G4TV.com.

59:40.560 --> 59:43.100
He was the original male host.

59:43.100 --> 59:48.840
Before then, he ran the All Games Network, which started off doing radio, a weekly radio

59:48.840 --> 59:52.920
show in Real Audio back in 1996.

59:52.920 --> 59:58.120
Then he joined up with Pseudo Online Interactive to do kind of an IPTV network, is what it

59:58.120 --> 01:00:04.300
would be called today, using Real Video, and he oversaw 15 hours worth of gaming content

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.300
a week.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.360
A daily live show and all that stuff.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:11.560
That's hardcore because Real Audio and Real Video, like streaming and stuff, that stuff

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.880
was a pain in the ass.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.040
I mean, that's what our college radio station used to use.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.040
That stuff was a pain.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.880
So I know that takes a lot of dedication.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.440
Apple made it easy for people to podcast in comparison.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:30.600
Unfortunately, the dot-com bust came out, and All Games Network died pretty much in

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.180
the dot-com bust.

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.280
And then Comcast brought him over to help start G4.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.760
So he moved out to Los Angeles, started G4, thought that they were going to be taking

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:46.000
all these risks with gaming television programming, and unfortunately they just didn't understand.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.680
And in about 2004, he said, okay, their vision is gone.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.720
They're going in a completely different direction.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.720
I want out.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.560
And so he got out, relaunched AllGames.com.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.920
Now he has a production company.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:03.760
He's developing television, radio, and internet content, all devoted to gaming.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.680
And AllGames Radio is one of those parts.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.680
Awesome.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.840
Now, what's your involvement with all of this then?

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.840
Okay.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.900
Well, I've been a fan of Scott Rubin's work.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.920
I've been listening to his stuff and watching his stuff since 97.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.100
and I went over, worked with G4,

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.740
I was actually a moderator on their forums,

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:23.300
back when G4 actually was good,

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.580
which they're not anymore.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.580
Ancient history.

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:31.760
And so, when he relaunched allgames.com,

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.580
I really kind of was in the right place, right time,

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:34.540
I'd been around long enough,

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:37.220
and he basically let me help him with his site,

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:40.380
with his forums, and then he had a live 365 station,

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.380
I'm like, hey, let me do a show.

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:47.740
And I did a show in 2004, and we had the MP3 archives of the show, which is what it was

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:48.740
called.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.820
The podcasting was very new.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.620
And now we actually have All Games Radio as a 24-7 music station.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.300
I pretty much run it.

01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:03.100
And we play game music, or we play talk programming, either his show, which is every weeknight,

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:08.940
live from the Arena Interactive Lounge in Santa Monica, or my show on Sunday nights.

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:12.500
arena interactive lounge sounds pretty awesome because it sounds like a place

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.900
where you can just kind of go and like just kind of like kick back have a beer

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.860
play some games here Scott over there doing a show sounds pretty awesome wait

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.780
I guess you can't really have a beer this is California huh okay have a have

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:29.540
a root beer and no no no no no no no here's what you do huh it's BYOB ah if

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:33.060
you bring your own you can have it there okay and they'll store it for you there

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:37.420
you go maybe maybe during e3 me and me and Jamie and Lynn Loki will all come

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.100
with some Guinness and gamer gave it up right.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.980
It'd be quite expensive on my part.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.740
All right, well anyway, so you have a show over on All Games.

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:47.740
What's your show all about?

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.660
What's the Bobby Black Wolf show about?

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:53.680
It's a one-person show pretty much.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:59.600
We talk about news, a lot of chatter, we have a toll-free number that you can call in with

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.840
Skype and basically just running down the news and I do some interviews.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.020
We had Tommy Tallarico on the show last week for about an hour and a half.

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.440
We even asked a question from you.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.640
I actually listened to the show.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.320
This was weird for me because we didn't have Orange Lounge Radio last week.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.080
I was kind of like, what am I going to do tonight?

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.240
I can't really listen to my own show because there is no show.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.400
I'll go listen to Bobby's show.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.520
I never get a chance to listen to Bobby's show live.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.640
I want to see how it is live versus Tate.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:31.280
He had Tommy Tallarico on and I thought that was kind of crazy because we've been known

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.980
to give Tommy a little bit of a hard time here on this program just just a

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.480
little bit so it was kind of funny so I you know I had to ask a question and you

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.920
know Loki where do you think I went of all the Tommy Tallarico things what do

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.200
you think I had to ask about remember what else he's involved in he was

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:52.760
involved in a lot of things actually right but the music stuff right video

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.920
games live of course so if I had to ask him any question about video games live

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.640
What do you think I brought up?

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.320
I don't even know.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.000
It was Pong.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.600
I had to ask, why Pong?

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.120
Why Pong?

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.520
And of course he said, basically his 10 minute answer,

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.880
whatever it was, basically boiled down to, dude,

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.960
it's eight seconds of Pong.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.600
Basically.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.440
And I understand.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.640
I'm just giving him a hard time, and obviously he does a lot.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.640
He obviously loves games and this industry a whole lot.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.200
He really does.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.880
To my defense, most of my angst at Tommy

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.760
was just mainly misdirected angst that should have been going towards G4.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.640
I was like, God damn it, that show sucked.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.480
It's not his fault.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.480
It's the writers.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.280
Do you know what I learned about that show?

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.680
I don't know if I should say that.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.600
Let's get back on topic here.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600
Please.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:45.200
So you have your program and you get some pretty cool interviews once in a while, yeah?

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.200
Yep.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.200
Pretty much.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.200
All right.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.200
Give us the details real quick.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.920
How can we tune into your show if we want to hear?

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:57.200
It's AllGamesRadio.com that launches the web player, or you can get us on iTunes to search

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.560
for Black Wolf.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.960
BobbyBlackWolfShow.com is the URL for my show, and that has all the links and everything.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.040
Why, Bobby, do we have you on the show tonight?

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:13.840
Is there some type of ulterior motive that we have you on the program tonight?

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.560
Go for it, Bobby.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.560
Essentially what we've done...

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:21.560
talking with Rob and, you know, to

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:25.580
Dark Soccer and Loki over there. And we have extended an official invitation to

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:29.600
re-air this program you're listening on our stream on Monday nights.

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.620
Essentially what will happen is

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:37.640
it's going to air on Monday nights at 10 pm Eastern, 7 pm Pacific,

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:41.660
with Scott Rubins All Games Interactive is going to run right up to it and then people

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.680
will get to listen to both part A and part B of this show

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.240
didn't get to listen on Sunday nights.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.000
Very cool, and we're very excited to be

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.400
a part of this growing network.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.760
It's gonna be awesome.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.840
It's very, very cool.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.520
Thank you so much for thinking of us.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.200
We really appreciate that, once again,

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.440
because I think you broke up right,

01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.940
just a little bit when you were saying the times there.

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.960
It's gonna be at 10 o'clock Eastern time,

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.420
7 p.m. Pacific time on Monday night.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.300
It's the same week show, so like,

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.940
you'll hear tonight's show tomorrow.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.320
And yes, I believe, Bobby, this is all starting tomorrow.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.200
Yes?

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.040
Yes, it is.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:14.860
There it is.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:19.220
want to hear Part B before we push on the podcast stream, because sometimes we're

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.700
lazy and we slack off here at OLR, but all games, they're on it, they've got our Part

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:24.580
B, they're going to play it Monday nights.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.580
So you can hear that in advance.

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:32.980
More than anything, we're just kind of excited to be a part of this and kind of work together.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.740
Independent productions and podcasts and things shouldn't work against each other, they

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:36.740
should work together.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:39.980
So we're very happy to be on board, Bobby, and thank you so much for thinking of us.

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:46.060
I want to add in one thing just in case people are thinking this right because I did I was at G for

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:52.680
Volunteering when tech TV occurred. We're not changing anything about olr. We don't want to take over your station

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:55.340
We don't want to change any content or anything

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:58.660
We're just re-airing the same show trying to expand it to a new audience

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:05.080
That's what I love is that and honestly what makes me so like honored is because they they're coming and saying we like what you

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.140
Do as is and I'm like wow

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.140
Wow!

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:09.140
Somebody likes us.

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.140
No, it's great.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:11.140
That gives me the warm fuzzies.

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.140
I know.

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:13.140
It's nice.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.140
So thank you for giving us the warm fuzzies.

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:15.780
We love it.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:19.300
Any other exciting programming coming as well to All Games?

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:24.340
One of the things that we're doing, we're going to be all at GDC in San Jose and we

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:29.560
are actually going to be broadcasting on All Games Radio on the Thursday night of GDC,

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.500
the Game Audio Network Guild Awards, which is going to be a two-hour award show with

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:39.260
live music, live performances, and giving awards for Music of the Year, Audio of the

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:40.260
Year, and all that.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:44.500
We're going to be backstage there, doing some interviews then, and then Friday night, for

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:50.700
my show, I'm going to be backstage at Video Games Live, asking why Pong, and we'll be

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.780
airing those on my show that weekend.

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.800
That's going to be so awesome.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.420
I can't believe we're a part of this in a roundabout way.

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.820
We're a part of the same station, so that's awesome.

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:01.980
I'm going to be listening to that.

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.020
That's going to be awesome.

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:07.340
What else is in store in the future of allgames.com?

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:11.120
Not necessarily just programming, but what's in store for the website, the whole vision

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.120
of all games?

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:15.100
Well, we're going to be adding some other podcasts.

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.540
We've approached other independent podcasters.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.060
You all are just the first.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:25.940
We're going to be putting a lot more podcasts on just so people can find new podcasts.

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:29.460
Scott Rubin does a lot of television production.

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:33.900
We've got a short film done by a man named Michael Hyland called As Real As Your Life.

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.800
It was premiered at the TED conference during David Perry's.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.220
It's going to be screened at GDC, I believe.

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:41.420
It's about video game addiction.

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:47.060
We're going to take that to film festivals, and there's some television programs, too,

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.140
that we're pitching that we can't talk more about yet.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.140
Awesome.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:53.620
And I have to give you the pitch for OLR TV later.

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:54.620
Just remind me.

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:55.620
Okay.

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:56.620
All right.

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.940
Anyway, no, seriously, though, thank you so much, Bobby.

01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:02.900
And please pass along our thanks to Scott as well, we're really excited to be on board

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:09.280
and just kind of get our show out there and be a part of this growing network, it's awesome.

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.580
And if anybody listening live, I'm in your chat room and if they want to ask questions

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:17.040
and call them fears or something, they can feel free to see me in there.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.020
On this end, guys, nothing's changing.

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:22.220
Well, there are other changes coming to OLR, but it has nothing to do with this, it's all

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.180
us that we're changing.

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:28.300
And I guess I'll just go ahead and say it, we're going to be making our station, we're

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.100
We're gonna be putting a little more oomph in our station

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.820
because we ran a poll on Orange Lounge Radio

01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.820
and we found you guys want a higher bit rate.

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:36.540
You want crystal clear Bamani and video game music

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.300
that plays on the stream and the shows.

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.340
So we're gonna be up in the bit rate

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:40.620
of Orange Lounge Radio later this month.

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.560
So it'll be pretty cool.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.420
And I'm gonna start wearing pants.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:46.500
Thank you for that because we got cited

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.120
by the California health code.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.020
But anyway, Bobby, thank you so much

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.100
for being on the program tonight

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.220
and best of luck with your show.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.540
And I look forward to working with you guys

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.340
as I'm sure DarkSakura, Loki, and maybe someday

01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:00.780
Spike can work with you too, come on your show.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.180
Thank you guys for accepting.

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.340
All right, not a problem.

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:04.640
You take care, Bobby.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.140
You too.

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:06.780
All right, bye-bye.

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.700
Bobby Black Wolf, that website again,

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:12.060
www.allgames.com slash podcast.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.700
If you want to hear Bobby's show, allgames.com,

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:16.340
Orange Lounge Radio starts on Monday.

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:17.800
And some of you guys might actually

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.020
be hearing this show on allgames.com

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:22.140
for the first time tomorrow.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:24.100
But it was actually yesterday when we taped.

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:24.740
Forget it.

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.740
All right, Loki, take us out of this hour

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:31.020
with, or hour and a half that we're turning into with a little story here about DDR and

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.700
email and what the heck?

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:39.460
Yes, yet another stupid idea brought to you by Microsoft.

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:45.000
This one's actually called StepMail and that's right, it uses a DDR pad to check your email

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.920
and it's actually part of this new interface called StepUI and basically their whole spin

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:58.580
on this is, you know what, you're not exercising enough while you're browsing on your PC and

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:03.300
this is a better way to do that. Honestly, folks, how long does it take to check email?

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:08.540
Like two minutes? Do we really need to be walking around on a giant pad that really

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:15.960
is obtrusive and just, no. I think this is the dumbest idea ever. It's like, that's almost

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:21.740
as dumb as saying, okay, I'm going to control my car with this dance pad as well. Are we

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:26.840
Are we sure that something's just not being horribly, horribly misinterpreted or misreported

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.140
here?

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.640
This is straight on Microsoft's website, okay?

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:35.080
I just want you to know that this isn't like some sort of thing that they're making up.

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:40.520
This shows a picture of some woman stepping on a dance pad, which by the way looks like

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:46.240
a red octane pad, and yes, and it shows the interface right here.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:50.140
Up, down, close, open, folders, delete.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:54.100
I like how you have to jump to do different things.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:56.140
It looks so dumb.

01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.980
It's completely retarded.

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:02.600
And then they've got a photo viewing thing which looks like someone

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.860
crapped it out in about two seconds. You know what would be sweet is if like the

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:09.740
announcer from DDR Extreme would like read your email. You've got mail!

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:12.020
You've got mail! It's your new record!

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:17.720
Whatever that guy says, you know? You know what? Come get Viagra at our store for free!

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.960
What they need to do is have a program that hooks up to your email and a little

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.480
pedal that you put on the ground so that you're sitting down

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.360
and you're doing like a recumbent bike.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.280
And the moment you stop pedaling,

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.040
your email closes. Don't they have these net bikes at the gym? They do, at the gym.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.200
They should have something like that at home. Anyways, the study shows, you know, using this program the average

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.640
heart rate is increased almost twenty percent while using step mail

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.560
and thirteen percent for step photo.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:47.400
Really though, why would you be looking at photos and what I mean, can you imagine I

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.680
Want to look through my picture album. Let me set up this giant dance pad and then someone walks around

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.520
What the hell are you doing you complete retard? I'm checking my photos and email

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.520
Yes, and you're lame here it is. Here it is. Here it is

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.040
Imagine this you're gonna have a party. You're gonna have an adult party and so you could get

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:14.040
X-rated pictures to look at on this thing and play naked twister on the DDR

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.080
mat. What do you think? I think that's retarded. I think that's the only reason this thing's

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.440
gonna get used ever. This thing will never get used. It will be some stupid study that

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:28.040
Microsoft wastes their money on. Then later on next year, come tax time, they'll be like,

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.880
you know what? We lost money on this. Tax write-off! That's right. That's all this is

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.640
it attacks right off.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:37.720
What applications do you think this will have on the origami?

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:45.280
Well, I can tell you this much that the dance pad is almost the size of the origami.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.080
And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a break here.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.080
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio in a little bit.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:56.440
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.440
a week.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.680
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
