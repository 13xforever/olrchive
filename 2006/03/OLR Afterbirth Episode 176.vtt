WEBVTT

00:06.994 --> 00:12.556
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, we're back here for the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth, the part of the show that's too hot to podcast.

00:13.336 --> 00:16.978
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Bugged is going to show us his boobies right now.

00:17.398 --> 00:17.778
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo!

00:17.798 --> 00:20.119
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray for boobies.

00:20.959 --> 00:21.499
[SPEAKER_07]: That's next week.

00:21.739 --> 00:28.382
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so here we are, just kind of chilling, sitting back here, kind of decompressing a little bit from tonight's show.

00:28.422 --> 00:30.603
[SPEAKER_10]: You know the first half of tonight's show was an hour and a half?

00:31.994 --> 00:32.375
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy.

00:33.115 --> 00:35.056
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, I think, our longest segment we've ever done.

00:35.156 --> 00:37.338
[SPEAKER_10]: We just can't shut up, like, ever.

00:37.478 --> 00:38.578
[SPEAKER_07]: You have three halves of a show.

00:39.779 --> 00:40.760
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, seriously.

00:43.001 --> 00:43.661
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I like this.

00:43.701 --> 00:44.062
[SPEAKER_10]: You like this?

00:44.122 --> 00:48.064
[SPEAKER_10]: Right at the end of the show, here comes Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com into the chat room.

00:48.384 --> 00:53.647
[SPEAKER_10]: He just came in there and he said, let's see, I said, what's up?

00:53.968 --> 00:55.108
[SPEAKER_10]: And he says, you're cancelled.

00:55.308 --> 00:55.829
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, what?

00:56.109 --> 00:57.410
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, oh no, just messing with you guys.

00:58.186 --> 00:59.227
[SPEAKER_03]: What a jerk.

00:59.247 --> 00:59.687
[SPEAKER_10]: You jerk.

01:01.108 --> 01:03.670
[SPEAKER_03]: My whole problem with Captain N, like I said... Uh-oh.

01:03.690 --> 01:04.430
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait.

01:04.450 --> 01:04.750
[SPEAKER_10]: This is random.

01:04.770 --> 01:05.371
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's this coming from?

01:05.391 --> 01:06.852
[SPEAKER_03]: This is because of the Captain N thing.

01:06.972 --> 01:07.292
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

01:07.432 --> 01:08.333
[SPEAKER_03]: He was actually replying to me.

01:08.553 --> 01:08.853
[SPEAKER_10]: Gotcha.

01:10.746 --> 01:15.689
[SPEAKER_03]: My whole problem with the Captain N thing is because I loved following the stories ever since I was little.

01:16.549 --> 01:25.194
[SPEAKER_03]: And to see characters that I had loved in the games being just trashed so horribly for the sake of marketing just completely pissed me off.

01:25.574 --> 01:30.656
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I did watch the show religiously, because the Zelda episodes were redeeming.

01:30.676 --> 01:32.517
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the Tetris thing was pretty freaking funny.

01:33.958 --> 01:36.019
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love Mother Brain and the Eggplant Wizard.

01:36.259 --> 01:37.960
[SPEAKER_07]: Dennis Hopper as Koopa.

01:38.362 --> 01:39.644
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was that.

01:40.264 --> 01:40.845
[SPEAKER_03]: There was that.

01:42.046 --> 01:55.963
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were just so many things I could not get over in that, even as a little kid, that to this day I have this long-standing, I wouldn't say a hatred, but a frustration with the whole Captain N franchise.

01:59.807 --> 02:00.548
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's funny?

02:01.648 --> 02:03.110
[SPEAKER_10]: The fact that I never watched Captain N?

02:03.490 --> 02:22.165
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not Captain N. I was reading there was another news story that came out this week regarding G4 and how they're doing Star Trek 2.0 on their station, basically putting on the old episodes of Star Trek and having a bunch of different counters and stuff like how many times, you know, Spock... Pop-up Star Trek?

02:22.845 --> 02:23.466
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly!

02:23.546 --> 02:28.390
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like how many times, you know, Spock says, you know, logical or illogical and

02:29.102 --> 02:29.803
[SPEAKER_09]: Internet is for Porn

02:57.042 --> 02:58.063
[SPEAKER_10]: The internet is not for porn.

02:58.343 --> 02:59.043
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what, kids?

02:59.083 --> 03:00.023
[SPEAKER_10]: Skype line's open.

03:00.063 --> 03:02.465
[SPEAKER_10]: We thought we'd take some calls here after the podcast.

03:02.825 --> 03:03.925
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what's on your minds.

03:03.965 --> 03:05.206
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the Skype line.

03:05.666 --> 03:07.607
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio after birth.

03:07.867 --> 03:08.247
[SPEAKER_10]: Lucky you.

03:09.248 --> 03:09.448
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

03:09.848 --> 03:10.348
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, who's this?

03:11.349 --> 03:12.329
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Xander from Florida.

03:12.510 --> 03:13.450
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Xander from Florida.

03:13.470 --> 03:13.950
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

03:15.691 --> 03:16.211
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

03:17.732 --> 03:18.452
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of stuff.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.374
[SPEAKER_10]: Xander, you sound sad tonight.

03:23.535 --> 03:24.275
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you need a hug?

03:24.295 --> 03:25.216
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you a sad puppy?

03:26.337 --> 03:26.677
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of.

03:27.077 --> 03:34.421
[SPEAKER_08]: But I went to a concert Saturday or whatever, and I got really, really, really bad whiplash.

03:35.881 --> 03:36.922
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, crap, that sucks.

03:36.942 --> 03:37.762
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the concert?

03:37.782 --> 03:40.744
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a Christian concert.

03:41.284 --> 03:42.424
[SPEAKER_08]: I went with my youth group.

03:42.845 --> 03:43.805
[SPEAKER_08]: Christian death metal?

03:44.265 --> 03:46.406
[SPEAKER_03]: There is Christian death metal.

03:47.427 --> 03:48.387
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard it before.

03:51.068 --> 03:52.129
[SPEAKER_07]: Time to Google that shit up.

03:55.876 --> 04:01.000
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, if you guys are having problems with Live365, we've got issues right now.

04:01.120 --> 04:09.287
[SPEAKER_10]: It's this whole stupid Live365 upgrade with the DMCA stuff, where if we're not sending live track data to them, they pull the plug on us.

04:09.447 --> 04:10.368
[SPEAKER_10]: God, that pisses me off.

04:10.408 --> 04:13.030
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear, I'm so angry with this.

04:13.411 --> 04:20.337
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been with Live365 for four years now, and it seems like... We're making our lives more frustrating.

04:20.437 --> 04:24.220
[SPEAKER_10]: VX, we're going to have a chat soon about this, because I'm getting a little tired of this poopy.

04:25.111 --> 04:26.572
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anywhere else you guys could go?

04:27.552 --> 04:31.034
[SPEAKER_10]: We're thinking about doing something independently, but we just don't know if we have the resources.

04:31.294 --> 04:32.474
[SPEAKER_07]: The bandwidth is not cheap.

04:33.055 --> 04:39.177
[SPEAKER_10]: We were hoping somebody big would put an offer to buy us out for a million dollars, but seeing as that won't happen, I guess we'll just have to fight for ourselves.

04:42.279 --> 04:44.640
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you could put up PayPal or something.

04:46.381 --> 04:49.342
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to fix the OLR thing right now, so we'll see what happens here.

04:53.975 --> 04:55.116
[SPEAKER_08]: So anything else on your mind, Xander?

04:57.138 --> 04:59.159
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to talk about Guitar Room Man a little bit.

04:59.360 --> 04:59.860
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what's up?

05:00.501 --> 05:04.164
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I got it for my birthday, and have any of you beat it?

05:05.164 --> 05:05.865
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I never have.

05:06.425 --> 05:09.048
[SPEAKER_03]: We almost got a beat at my house, but it wasn't me that did it.

05:10.949 --> 05:19.957
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm stuck on San Bunchio on Masters, and I swear this has to be the hardest game I've played in my life.

05:20.717 --> 05:21.558
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just nasty.

05:25.471 --> 05:27.492
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean a good game for once, Miklatov?

05:27.892 --> 05:28.132
Sorry.

05:30.434 --> 05:33.375
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you yelling back at our chatroom there, www.orangellandradio.com?

05:33.435 --> 05:34.015
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I gotcha.

05:34.436 --> 05:34.696
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

05:35.796 --> 05:37.617
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we're gonna go ahead and let you go, Xander.

05:37.637 --> 05:38.938
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna try and get one more call, alright?

05:39.738 --> 05:40.019
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

05:40.139 --> 05:40.539
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

05:43.340 --> 05:44.481
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to another call here.

05:45.802 --> 05:46.442
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to this one.

05:47.262 --> 05:48.083
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Land Radio.

05:49.113 --> 05:49.975
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up, boss?

05:50.115 --> 05:52.300
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you already know who I am.

05:52.500 --> 05:52.941
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Saku.

05:54.904 --> 05:56.024
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what's up, boss?

05:56.344 --> 05:56.704
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

05:56.965 --> 05:59.125
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to finish up tonight's show, so you got to keep it short.

05:59.145 --> 05:59.665
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

06:00.285 --> 06:04.206
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, I'm just, you know, yesterday I went to an anime convention.

06:04.246 --> 06:07.987
[SPEAKER_06]: I was lucky to play, you know, 2DX and Poppin' on their respective ASCs.

06:09.127 --> 06:15.609
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's normal, but I mean, the transition between both of them is kind of strange.

06:15.669 --> 06:23.491
[SPEAKER_06]: I know for a fact that when I was playing 2DX, it was just like my scores decreased as a result because I'm used to the KLC.

06:24.850 --> 06:30.603
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there's anything you can help me, you know, any advice you can give me if I try... What was the controller they were using?

06:31.528 --> 06:32.288
[SPEAKER_06]: I was there for an hour.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.269
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on the 2DX setup for several hours.

06:57.230 --> 07:01.373
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, at least three to four hours, because it was very small.

07:01.393 --> 07:03.914
[SPEAKER_06]: No one was really there at the 2DX setup.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.015
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly don't know what to tell you, bud.

07:06.055 --> 07:07.756
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just kind of one of those things you just have to get used to.

07:07.776 --> 07:14.941
[SPEAKER_10]: There's really no way I can tell you to... My thing is, is that maybe you get used to one playing style on the home controller, but here's the thing.

07:14.981 --> 07:21.425
[SPEAKER_10]: The big trick to being able to scratch in 2DX is that, and this takes a while to get the hang of, is the pinky scratching.

07:21.765 --> 07:25.307
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to be able to move that turntable with your pinky, and I know it sounds a little crazy.

07:25.327 --> 07:26.728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I tend to do that as well.

07:27.028 --> 07:28.952
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you really gotta master that.

07:28.972 --> 07:30.656
[SPEAKER_06]: Digital Life this year in New York City.

07:31.617 --> 07:32.960
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the annual thing.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.009
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you tried valiantly to try to make plans last year.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.191
[SPEAKER_06]: When is Digital Life this year?

07:39.122 --> 07:40.263
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be in October.

07:41.444 --> 07:47.368
[SPEAKER_06]: They already pre-announced the event when I came there.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.310
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as I left the convention center, there was a sign that said, see you next year.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.252
[SPEAKER_06]: It said the date in mid-October.

07:53.672 --> 07:54.152
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

07:54.172 --> 07:59.496
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't got confirmation about the big DDR Nationals tournament being held up.

07:59.876 --> 08:04.800
[SPEAKER_06]: But most likely they will hold it up, assuming now that Supernova is getting more...

08:05.760 --> 08:08.864
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you're going to make plans for it.

08:08.884 --> 08:10.726
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to know if you are.

08:18.069 --> 08:18.929
[SPEAKER_06]: What, for digital life?

08:19.750 --> 08:22.591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you're planning to go out there, do something live or something.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.215
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a budget thing for us.

08:29.495 --> 08:33.577
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if we had the money to do it, we would, but we don't make money off of doing this.

08:33.617 --> 08:37.059
[SPEAKER_10]: We do this show because we love it, and I think people sometimes forget that sometimes.

08:37.459 --> 08:37.619
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

08:38.700 --> 08:39.221
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:50.715 --> 08:54.398
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, if we have the money, I'm sure we'll try it, but it'll be an individual thing.

08:54.518 --> 08:57.501
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we'll have to decide as individuals if we can accommodate it into our schedule.

08:57.921 --> 08:59.042
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to try and come.

08:59.082 --> 09:01.124
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a good friend in New York City that would let me stay there.

09:01.925 --> 09:02.926
[SPEAKER_10]: So, maybe.

09:03.626 --> 09:07.189
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say, probably, I would do it.

09:07.670 --> 09:11.553
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would say, probably, I'm more likely to do it than DarkSakura or Loki.

09:11.593 --> 09:11.994
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

09:12.054 --> 09:13.375
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you guys thinking about this, or...

09:14.586 --> 09:21.531
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the available time off, especially since there are other things to be discussed.

09:38.903 --> 09:39.905
[SPEAKER_10]: Not going to happen for me.

09:40.346 --> 09:45.333
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally forgot that I have plans to go to Canada to celebrate the 4th of July.

09:45.434 --> 09:46.095
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to be funny.

09:46.415 --> 09:48.338
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I can't say which one yet.

09:48.398 --> 09:50.101
[SPEAKER_03]: I am making arrangements for another convention.

09:50.522 --> 09:50.782
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet!

09:53.271 --> 09:56.093
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, Zaku, thanks for the call, and take care, okay?

09:56.693 --> 09:57.713
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, later, man.

09:58.274 --> 10:04.437
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to the calls we didn't get to, but we've got to wrap up tonight's show because we want to, you know, go back to our regular lives.

10:04.857 --> 10:07.179
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to get into tonight's cage match.

10:07.679 --> 10:09.120
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, you guys have lives outside of this?

10:09.380 --> 10:10.681
[SPEAKER_10]: Believe it or not, once in a while.

10:11.261 --> 10:12.141
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my problem.

10:12.181 --> 10:13.102
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep forgetting that part.

10:14.603 --> 10:14.843
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

10:16.043 --> 10:16.404
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see here.

10:16.424 --> 10:17.804
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to find the theme music here.

10:17.864 --> 10:19.806
[SPEAKER_10]: My directories are all screwed up now.

10:23.209 --> 10:25.910
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, remind our listeners how the cage match works while I set this up.

10:26.491 --> 10:49.401
[SPEAKER_09]: The cage match works basically we have three songs that are put in by each one of the hosts then we play each song in its entirety except for the one that won and the winning song of the cage match is put in the rotation and will come up to be challenged by two more songs next week and the actual listeners in our chat room get to vote on them.

10:49.881 --> 10:50.922
[SPEAKER_09]: to see which one goes on.

10:51.643 --> 10:52.083
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet!

10:53.164 --> 10:54.145
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see.

10:54.165 --> 10:56.827
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to find the song here from last week.

10:58.249 --> 11:00.451
[SPEAKER_10]: I was exhausted tonight.

11:00.471 --> 11:01.191
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, guys.

11:02.532 --> 11:04.194
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize to our live listeners.

11:04.294 --> 11:06.876
[SPEAKER_10]: They've had to put up with a lot of crap tonight, so I apologize.

11:07.377 --> 11:08.778
[SPEAKER_10]: Blame it all on caffeine.

11:09.339 --> 11:10.139
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we sure are.

11:12.081 --> 11:12.662
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see.

11:12.702 --> 11:14.623
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's my new stuff here?

11:14.643 --> 11:14.904
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

11:18.434 --> 11:18.734
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is.

11:18.774 --> 11:19.797
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there's last week's winner.

11:19.838 --> 11:20.620
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, now we can do this.

11:21.482 --> 11:23.367
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, cue the theme music, please.

11:25.233 --> 11:25.514
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

11:27.068 --> 11:33.233
[SPEAKER_10]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we had The Azoic, who's a band that you might know from DDR Ultramix 3.

11:33.673 --> 11:40.298
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a song that's been remixed for a new album they have coming out, and it's called Going Under, and it's the kinetic mix.

11:40.919 --> 11:48.885
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what won last week's Cage Match, so here it is, a clip of song number one tonight, The Azoic, with Going Under, the kinetic mix.

11:48.905 --> 11:49.085
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy.

11:49.105 --> 11:49.346
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy.

13:55.717 --> 13:57.678
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

13:57.698 --> 13:59.759
[SPEAKER_10]: The Azoic with Going Under, the kinetic mix.

14:00.199 --> 14:03.161
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see if they can win two weeks in a row, but it's gotta beat these songs.

14:03.221 --> 14:04.562
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what's song number two tonight?

14:05.002 --> 14:08.384
[SPEAKER_09]: This song is one of my favorite songs from Burnout Revenge.

14:08.864 --> 14:12.085
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually by Junkie XL, and it's a song called Today.

14:12.105 --> 14:14.347
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of reminds me a little bit of Depeche Mode in a way.

14:14.947 --> 14:16.007
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's an awesome song.

14:16.047 --> 14:20.870
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite bar none of all the tracks are on the Burnout series.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.092
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that would be...

14:26.618 --> 14:31.502
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually looked for the album because this is the title from the album.

14:33.103 --> 14:33.423
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

14:33.443 --> 14:36.705
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's song number two tonight, Junkie XL with Today from Burnout.

14:38.026 --> 14:42.529
Burnout.

16:15.605 --> 16:16.197
And it's

17:05.523 --> 17:06.637
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that holds

17:35.931 --> 17:36.261
DJ Ranma

19:10.303 --> 19:36.999
[SPEAKER_02]: And it feels like today So just hold on tight and let it slip away And it feels like today So just hold on tight and let it slip away

19:39.260 --> 19:39.848
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like

21:16.055 --> 21:17.316
[SPEAKER_10]: Song number two.

21:17.356 --> 21:19.599
[SPEAKER_10]: That was Junkie XL with Today.

21:19.699 --> 21:22.742
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what the studio folks thought of that.

21:22.762 --> 21:25.284
[SPEAKER_10]: But remember, it is up to you guys, but you have to be in our chat room to vote.

21:25.344 --> 21:25.945
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

21:26.466 --> 21:27.467
[SPEAKER_03]: That one was pretty neato.

21:28.367 --> 21:29.729
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets an eight.

21:30.309 --> 21:30.610
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

21:31.150 --> 21:31.410
[SPEAKER_09]: Ten.

21:31.531 --> 21:31.891
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

21:32.011 --> 21:33.653
[SPEAKER_09]: I play all my races to that song.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.263
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Roz to blame for this one

21:54.272 --> 21:55.493
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Tally Hall song.

21:55.933 --> 21:57.053
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called True Love.

21:57.694 --> 21:58.474
[SPEAKER_10]: True Love?

21:58.634 --> 21:59.295
[SPEAKER_03]: True Love.

21:59.635 --> 22:00.835
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that like the Princess Bride?

22:00.955 --> 22:01.175
[SPEAKER_10]: Marriage.

22:01.215 --> 22:01.656
[SPEAKER_10]: Marriage.

22:01.736 --> 22:02.676
[SPEAKER_10]: True Love.

22:03.236 --> 22:05.077
[SPEAKER_03]: Marriage.

22:05.578 --> 22:07.298
[SPEAKER_10]: True Blade.

22:07.318 --> 22:07.398
[SPEAKER_02]: Scum.

22:08.439 --> 22:09.459
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, here we go.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.701
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go to Tally Hall with True Love.

22:12.961 --> 22:13.982
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is, song number three tonight.

22:26.599 --> 22:52.460
[SPEAKER_11]: I have this little thing It's probably just a fling Two girls I like a lot I think they're really hot But I'm not sure if they know How my love began to grow It took a lot of time But right now it's only

22:57.890 --> 23:27.363
[SPEAKER_11]: I drew a mural of the things I'd like to love And where my heart resides is with two girls with great eyes If they just gave me a chance, I'd show them what they want and teach them what they got I'd steal each and every one of their fancies I'd take the key to my heart and open it and let the love shine through Mary Kate and Ashley, I hope you understand

23:38.783 --> 23:53.089
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw you on TV You dressed up like a bee Reminds me of the time How it's gone and it's gone and it's gone

24:09.265 --> 24:22.588
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you understand that I love you a lot And I wanna be your man And I think that it'd be totally cool If I'm around your apartments And you're going to your school Hello?

24:22.608 --> 24:22.808
Hello?

24:22.868 --> 24:23.448
Hello?

24:23.488 --> 24:25.729
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm calling from Tally Hall Hello?

24:25.789 --> 24:25.949
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

24:26.109 --> 24:31.290
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm calling from Tally Hall and I... Mary Kate and Ashley I hope you understand that I love you

24:51.914 --> 25:02.100
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that life without you and you would be sad, and I know it'd be bad.

25:15.191 --> 25:16.051
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

25:55.103 --> 25:58.126
[SPEAKER_10]: Song number three tonight, Tally Hall with Twilove.

25:58.726 --> 26:00.948
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you love that song or did you hate it?

26:01.309 --> 26:01.909
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

26:01.989 --> 26:03.431
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets a ten for being ridiculous.

26:04.432 --> 26:04.732
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

26:05.092 --> 26:05.933
[SPEAKER_09]: It is ridiculous.

26:05.993 --> 26:08.916
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone knows it's pre-anorexic Lindsay Lohan.

26:08.956 --> 26:09.797
[SPEAKER_09]: That's worth loving.

26:11.398 --> 26:12.159
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you score?

26:12.179 --> 26:12.479
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh?

26:12.940 --> 26:13.780
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you score?

26:14.741 --> 26:15.082
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven.

26:15.302 --> 26:15.642
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

26:16.483 --> 26:18.345
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give it eight.

26:18.385 --> 26:19.686
[SPEAKER_07]: It had a good beat and you can answer to it.

26:20.046 --> 26:20.326
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

26:21.326 --> 26:25.247
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will give it the combined weight of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, which is eight.

26:25.547 --> 26:26.027
[SPEAKER_10]: Eight pounds.

26:26.187 --> 26:27.107
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how much they weigh.

26:27.728 --> 26:28.068
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

26:29.068 --> 26:31.148
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely a genre night.

26:31.428 --> 26:35.769
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I think all the songs are actually really good tonight, I think, in their respective genres.

26:36.109 --> 26:37.790
[SPEAKER_10]: So it all comes down to what you like best.

26:37.850 --> 26:38.870
[SPEAKER_10]: It's your choice, chat room.

26:38.890 --> 26:41.750
[SPEAKER_10]: Here it is, a recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.

26:42.190 --> 26:44.711

27:02.335 --> 27:13.283
[SPEAKER_10]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Tally Hall with True Love.

[SPEAKER_10]: All right, place vote now.

27:17.845 --> 27:18.546
[SPEAKER_00]: Send a private message.

27:44.391 --> 27:45.913
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, we got dead air there for a minute.

27:45.973 --> 27:46.774
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very sorry there.

27:48.035 --> 27:48.996
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's recap there.

27:49.036 --> 27:50.537
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully some folks are still connected there.

27:50.577 --> 27:52.239
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a little soundboard problem on my end.

27:52.259 --> 27:52.700
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, guys.

27:53.661 --> 27:54.522
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go back.

27:54.722 --> 27:55.723
[SPEAKER_10]: Place vote now.

27:56.343 --> 27:57.204
[SPEAKER_10]: And here we go.

27:57.725 --> 27:58.325
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your week?

27:58.345 --> 27:58.946
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your day?

27:59.066 --> 28:00.187
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki starting us off tonight.

28:00.508 --> 28:01.048
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, I...

28:02.009 --> 28:04.310
[SPEAKER_09]: We're starting to finalize more stuff for the wedding.

28:04.670 --> 28:14.733
[SPEAKER_09]: We set aside some time to, or we're going to go pick up our marriage license and we're also, we just sent out the rest of the invitations.

28:15.334 --> 28:30.379
[SPEAKER_09]: We have someone now making favors and just kind of some of that stuff and I've been playing video games most of the week and just work stuff, you know, trying to, you know, finish March and get April started and

28:31.360 --> 28:32.321
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, fun stuff.

28:32.601 --> 28:38.786
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we did a marathon session of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories after work last week.

28:39.307 --> 28:42.690
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to play one of the modes that they have on there.

28:43.270 --> 28:44.911
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Tanks for Memories.

28:45.072 --> 28:46.253
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's actually pretty fun.

28:46.673 --> 28:48.615
[SPEAKER_09]: You start off and you pick up the tank.

28:49.535 --> 28:51.857
[SPEAKER_09]: And then once you're in the tank, everybody else is trying to blow up the tank.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.299
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're trying to stay in the tank for...

28:55.481 --> 28:56.283
[SPEAKER_09]: A set amount of time.

28:56.364 --> 28:58.429
[SPEAKER_09]: And so your timer's counting down while you're in the tank.

28:58.509 --> 29:01.357
[SPEAKER_09]: If your tank explodes, the person that destroyed the tank...

29:02.278 --> 29:13.061
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping that the next Grand Theft Auto that comes out does support more players because six players is fun but I mean I would like maybe 10 or 12 at the most I think would be really good

29:32.831 --> 29:34.693
[SPEAKER_09]: Get some good team matches going on there.

29:37.215 --> 29:38.717
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than that, really not too much else.

29:39.918 --> 29:44.082
[SPEAKER_09]: I had garlic on Friday and I still smell like garlic today.

29:45.062 --> 29:49.767
[SPEAKER_09]: After numerous showers and brushing my teeth, that smell does not go away.

29:50.167 --> 29:52.009
[SPEAKER_03]: You smell like garlic, I smell like a mocha.

29:53.770 --> 29:56.733
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still tasting curry from Thursday night and I only have one forkful.

29:59.512 --> 29:59.812
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it?

30:00.333 --> 30:00.773
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

30:01.874 --> 30:02.554
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

30:02.895 --> 30:03.395
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait, never mind.

30:03.695 --> 30:04.256
[SPEAKER_10]: She's busy over there.

30:04.316 --> 30:06.537
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that and our apartments trapping cats now.

30:06.777 --> 30:07.118
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun.

30:07.818 --> 30:08.479
[SPEAKER_07]: Bugged, how was your week?

30:08.499 --> 30:08.839
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

30:10.472 --> 30:11.853
[SPEAKER_07]: My week was rather uneventful.

30:11.973 --> 30:24.344
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, I had a whirlwind tour through the Bay Area to drop stuff off and pick stuff up for the roommate and I as we are both rather unemployed and still needing to pay bills, so we're selling off stuff.

30:24.844 --> 30:27.186
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody needs computers, I got some.

30:29.749 --> 30:30.429
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm out of hard drives.

30:31.970 --> 30:32.991
[SPEAKER_07]: I already sold all those off.

30:34.993 --> 30:35.213
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

30:39.079 --> 30:39.259
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

30:39.880 --> 30:44.643
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, my roommate is waiting on a replacement screen for his ThinkPad.

30:45.324 --> 30:55.332
[SPEAKER_07]: Whirlwind Tour, playing video games, raiding trash heaps, finding Macs of all things, and reconstituting them into machines to be sold.

30:58.496 --> 30:59.256
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exciting.

30:59.496 --> 31:00.316
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and playing Diablo 2.

31:00.396 --> 31:01.717
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, fun times.

31:03.177 --> 31:05.097
[SPEAKER_10]: My week and my day was pretty good.

31:05.137 --> 31:08.558
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to Roseville Golf Land on Friday?

31:08.678 --> 31:09.238
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Saturday.

31:09.418 --> 31:09.838
[SPEAKER_07]: Last night.

31:09.898 --> 31:10.398
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, last night.

31:10.418 --> 31:11.799
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm drunk.

31:11.819 --> 31:12.839
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not.

31:13.399 --> 31:14.739
[SPEAKER_10]: For the first time in forever.

31:15.679 --> 31:17.340
[SPEAKER_10]: It was interesting.

31:18.820 --> 31:24.621
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually had a lot of fun playing Initial D and stuff and just kind of being there with a couple people.

31:25.121 --> 31:27.383
[SPEAKER_10]: But DDR was still kind of assy.

31:27.683 --> 31:29.724
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I find that I like this.

31:29.824 --> 31:30.925
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not the game itself.

31:30.945 --> 31:31.666
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing wrong with the game.

31:31.706 --> 31:34.227
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the machine and the upkeep of it at Roseville is crappy.

31:34.267 --> 31:34.768
[SPEAKER_10]: What upkeep?

31:34.848 --> 31:37.990
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hate the people that go to Roseville Golf Line.

31:38.310 --> 31:43.133
[SPEAKER_10]: Roseville Golf Line would be wonderful if the nuclear holocaust hit it and only me and my friends survived.

31:43.593 --> 31:45.094
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be great if it took out Granite Bay.

31:46.355 --> 31:46.996
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, yes.

31:47.236 --> 31:49.958
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I had an okay time.

31:51.098 --> 31:52.379
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really all I feel like sharing.

31:52.399 --> 31:52.659
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario Kart?

31:54.244 --> 31:55.105
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario Kart's okay.

31:55.525 --> 31:56.627
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I didn't play it last year.

31:56.647 --> 31:57.688
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they have any other games?

31:57.848 --> 31:58.148
[SPEAKER_09]: New games?

31:58.508 --> 31:59.209
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard, what was it?

31:59.249 --> 32:02.773
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to play, uh, Wangan, Wangan Midnight Maximum 2.

32:02.813 --> 32:03.293
[SPEAKER_10]: What was it?

32:03.654 --> 32:05.075
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking all the thugs were on that game.

32:05.095 --> 32:07.317
[SPEAKER_09]: What about, um, one of the Roseville theaters?

32:07.337 --> 32:08.318
[SPEAKER_09]: This was at Time Crisis 4.

32:09.602 --> 32:10.203
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't checked it out.

32:10.283 --> 32:12.485
[SPEAKER_09]: Or not Time Crisis 4, House of the Dead 4.

32:12.686 --> 32:13.406
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I haven't checked it out.

32:13.527 --> 32:14.147
[SPEAKER_07]: That's UCD.

32:14.167 --> 32:17.952
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and Spike was here last week, and I believe told us that that was at Century.

32:18.372 --> 32:20.755
[SPEAKER_10]: It's wherever Nightwatch is playing in Roselle, because that's what they went and saw.

32:21.616 --> 32:22.917
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's where he would have seen it.

32:25.020 --> 32:26.361
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this is funny, because...

32:28.645 --> 32:36.913
[SPEAKER_10]: Out there in the living room right now, everything is labeled in Russian because Extifer is learning Russian and Loki's fiance is teaching it to him.

32:37.433 --> 32:40.816
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they've taken index cards and labeled everything in the living room in Russian.

32:41.156 --> 32:43.979
[SPEAKER_10]: And it actually has to stay up for a couple weeks.

32:44.499 --> 32:45.500
[SPEAKER_10]: So that should be interesting.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.202
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be learning this real quick.

32:47.222 --> 32:48.062
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to read it.

32:48.122 --> 32:50.084
[SPEAKER_10]: Your front room looks like a Russian kindergarten.

32:50.164 --> 32:50.545
[SPEAKER_10]: It does.

32:50.605 --> 32:51.946
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like a Russian kindergarten right now.

32:51.986 --> 32:52.767
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of scary.

32:53.347 --> 32:54.248
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to buy some beets.

32:55.703 --> 32:57.705
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, how was your week?

32:57.745 --> 32:58.526
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your day?

32:58.566 --> 33:00.448
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Confusion Friday night was badass, by the way.

33:00.488 --> 33:00.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was.

33:00.908 --> 33:01.949
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a good time.

33:01.969 --> 33:03.210
[SPEAKER_07]: Picture hoarded up.

33:03.230 --> 33:03.631
[SPEAKER_10]: It was great.

33:03.671 --> 33:04.411
[SPEAKER_10]: Mistress Tia, love her.

33:19.201 --> 33:28.164
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, I ripped off some of my pictures too, I was, Confusion was probably the most, was the highlight of my week, because the rest of my week was shit.

33:28.564 --> 33:29.024
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

33:29.384 --> 33:33.786
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, just a quick FYI, Jason wanted me to let you know that the pictures are up, so I'm going to grab them and I'll send them to you later.

33:33.806 --> 33:40.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, because I need the, there's a pic that Extover took of me with the camera, of doing the too much metal for one hand.

33:40.288 --> 33:42.469
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll get them from Jason, and I'm pretty sure I know where he put them.

33:42.489 --> 33:43.309
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be in my space photo.

33:43.769 --> 33:45.070
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Pat, I should check.

33:45.371 --> 33:50.375
[SPEAKER_03]: He usually puts all my stuff in a... He has a web server on his computer, so... I have a picture of me on MySpace playing a bass, which is what I was doing last night.

33:50.435 --> 33:50.796
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool!

33:51.076 --> 34:00.564
[SPEAKER_03]: I went over to Miss Tia's house, or apartment, to, uh... Now, I am a vegetarian now, except for fish.

34:00.604 --> 34:01.205
[SPEAKER_03]: I will eat fish.

34:02.046 --> 34:02.506
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um...

34:03.888 --> 34:10.576
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to every so often because me and Tia and her roommate Jovan are like the Sacramento Southern Collection.

34:11.557 --> 34:16.903
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had fried chicken and biscuits and red beans and rice and mashed potatoes and gravy.

34:16.963 --> 34:17.464
[SPEAKER_03]: Homemade.

34:17.985 --> 34:18.525
[SPEAKER_03]: No Popeyes.

34:19.346 --> 34:20.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is close enough!

34:20.307 --> 34:21.047
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very close.

34:21.107 --> 34:22.188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very southern.

34:22.748 --> 34:41.901
[SPEAKER_03]: So we all were getting our fried chicken on, and of course, because I haven't eaten a lot of meat in a while, et, eaten, et, whatever, meat, in a long time, the chicken made me very sick, but I was all happy, and we were watching the best little whorehouse in Texas and really not getting into it, so I started playing this bass that was in their living room, and I actually picked out a few lines, so I think I've got some talent for it.

34:42.441 --> 34:48.746
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm supposed to be getting one of these for my birthday, hint, hint, hint, which is next month, which still depresses me.

34:50.187 --> 34:57.494
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but the rest of my week, I blew off school because I was just all, you know, whatever.

34:58.214 --> 35:01.017
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I decided that because, um...

35:03.166 --> 35:08.149
[SPEAKER_03]: For background, for people, I don't have a lot of free time, as in, I have no free time.

35:09.110 --> 35:14.154
[SPEAKER_03]: So I dropped a class so that I would not completely lose my sanity and my health.

35:14.914 --> 35:19.938
[SPEAKER_03]: I dropped Color Theory, also because going in that classroom makes me have headaches from acrylic paint fumes.

35:20.218 --> 35:20.638
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun, huh?

35:21.519 --> 35:25.641
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to be taking it next spring and working part-time, blah blah blah.

35:26.622 --> 35:28.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you have to make those sacrifices for your health.

35:29.345 --> 35:36.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, it's going to keep me in school for another, I'd say at least another semester.

35:37.733 --> 35:43.959
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then that's really what my week has been, is me trying to decide whether or not I was going to drop that class.

35:44.299 --> 35:44.839
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I did.

35:46.281 --> 35:47.742
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an academic failure.

35:47.762 --> 35:49.764
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a W on my transcript now.

35:49.904 --> 35:50.525
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a big deal.

35:53.417 --> 35:58.603
[SPEAKER_03]: The bass I'm looking at, by the way, is a OLP, either that or... I don't know.

35:58.983 --> 36:02.106
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody posted a picture to my MySpace of a Bats Maru guitar.

36:02.226 --> 36:03.107
[SPEAKER_10]: That's so hardcore.

36:03.187 --> 36:07.692
[SPEAKER_03]: I know about the Bats Maru bass, and the ratings on it are not the best.

36:08.132 --> 36:10.134
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of them that I'm looking at... But it's a Bats Maru bass.

36:10.154 --> 36:10.775
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't we see that?

36:10.855 --> 36:11.276
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Hello Kitty.

36:11.296 --> 36:13.698
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't buy it because it looks good.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.261
[SPEAKER_03]: You buy it because it sounds good.

36:16.701 --> 36:17.401
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

36:17.461 --> 36:18.502
[SPEAKER_03]: You and I have different priorities.

36:18.522 --> 36:21.202
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always paint it or finish it or put stickers on it or something.

36:21.222 --> 36:24.083
[SPEAKER_10]: You and I have painfully different priorities.

36:27.104 --> 36:29.085
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, are we ready to get to the chatroom FUs?

36:29.365 --> 36:30.605
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you all wrapped up?

36:31.465 --> 36:33.766
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, I'm not a vegetarian for ethical reasons.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.447
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't eat meat because it makes me sick.

36:38.167 --> 36:40.368
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to the chatroom FUs.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.489
[SPEAKER_10]: Send them over a private message.

36:48.246 --> 36:57.988
[SPEAKER_10]: MrBlackWolf would like to say F you to my Guitar Hero controller who decided last week that the green button was going to no longer work even though it looks just fine when I take it apart.

36:58.528 --> 36:58.828
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

37:02.149 --> 37:09.071
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jaded2006 would like to say F you to my DDR pad sensor taking a crap last night in the middle of a game.

37:09.971 --> 37:11.151
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be nasty to step in.

37:13.796 --> 37:19.021
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Knight would like to say F you to my job for being so freaking hot today.

37:19.462 --> 37:22.545
[SPEAKER_10]: And F you to me for not getting out more often and enjoy life.

37:24.227 --> 37:27.390
[SPEAKER_10]: Mikkel Tov would like to say F you to the new season of Power Rangers.

37:27.451 --> 37:30.173
[SPEAKER_10]: If it wasn't for the hot Green Ranger, the show would be worthless.

37:32.223 --> 37:42.048
[SPEAKER_10]: Phoenix would like to say F you to all the haters who downvote my YTMNDs and the people in chat who wanted to kick me because I shamelessly plugged my new YTMND.

37:43.248 --> 37:46.230
[SPEAKER_10]: Which he'll post the link in chatroom if you want to see that.

37:46.730 --> 37:47.590
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to try and read it.

37:47.710 --> 37:48.611
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too many abbreviations.

37:51.592 --> 37:55.414
[SPEAKER_10]: Ryoma would like to say F you to security guards not letting me in the LJ's mosh.

37:55.994 --> 37:57.595
[SPEAKER_10]: LJ mofo, she it.

37:59.264 --> 38:03.130
[SPEAKER_10]: Sephiroth 1215 would like to say F you to Beatmania being a whopping $65.

38:04.612 --> 38:06.535
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, why did we report it would be less?

38:07.958 --> 38:08.318
[SPEAKER_10]: What now?

38:08.759 --> 38:09.320
[SPEAKER_10]: Beatmania?

38:09.580 --> 38:10.221
[SPEAKER_10]: We said it was going to be $40.

38:10.782 --> 38:11.243
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened?

38:11.824 --> 38:12.405
[SPEAKER_10]: The price changed.

38:12.465 --> 38:13.426
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't you read the forums?

38:13.947 --> 38:14.288
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess.

38:16.454 --> 38:17.535
[SPEAKER_10]: Not our fault.

38:17.835 --> 38:19.096
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiger Claw, I know, it happens.

38:19.196 --> 38:22.178
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazon was running the same thing for a while, so, you know, it wasn't just us.

38:22.218 --> 38:24.559
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they changed their mind on what they wanted to price it.

38:24.699 --> 38:25.740
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, poopy on you guys.

38:26.180 --> 38:29.242
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Tiger Claw would like to say F you to all the Captain N haters.

38:30.543 --> 38:37.248
[SPEAKER_10]: NintendoManiac64 would like to say F you to Slackware for not liking the non-normal video... I'm sorry, it's linking.

38:38.068 --> 38:41.851
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to Slackware for not linking the non-normal video card on the computer I was installing on.

38:42.291 --> 38:43.412
[SPEAKER_10]: And F you to Sony...

38:46.249 --> 38:55.315
[SPEAKER_10]: And Legend of Zaku would like to say F you to not being able to drink a bottle of Ramune really fast to qualify for a Ramune drinking contest in a small-time anime expo yesterday.

38:55.635 --> 38:57.056
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd have to make you belch.

38:57.316 --> 39:03.119
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly, Ryoma would like to say F you to the stupid Judas Priest sticker not coming off my base.

39:04.280 --> 39:05.541
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we have one more late one.

39:06.261 --> 39:09.303
[SPEAKER_10]: RavensDolphin would like to say F you for $60 games.

39:09.924 --> 39:10.544
[SPEAKER_10]: Amen to that.

39:11.144 --> 39:12.125
[SPEAKER_10]: Freaking Xbox 360.

39:12.165 --> 39:14.947
[SPEAKER_07]: Removing Judas Priest stickers from your base does not make you any less gay.

39:16.121 --> 39:16.701
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop it.

39:16.721 --> 39:27.387
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, now I'll have you know that Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires and Rockstar's Table Tennis are both coming out at $40 for the Xbox 360.

39:27.808 --> 39:28.388
Whoopee!

39:29.168 --> 39:30.189
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, both games are grand stock.

39:32.601 --> 39:33.962
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I think that's about it.

39:34.002 --> 39:34.923
[SPEAKER_10]: We're way over tonight.

39:34.963 --> 39:36.564
[SPEAKER_10]: We're supposed to be done with this shit at 9 o'clock.

39:36.604 --> 39:36.884
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 9.30 now.

39:36.964 --> 39:37.805
[SPEAKER_10]: I have homework to do.

39:37.825 --> 39:39.306
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because our first half ran so long.

39:40.407 --> 39:41.467
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we like to talk.

39:41.807 --> 39:43.329
[SPEAKER_10]: Final last super-duper thoughts.

39:43.349 --> 39:44.009
[SPEAKER_10]: Caffeine.

39:44.049 --> 39:44.429
[SPEAKER_10]: Bugged.

39:44.850 --> 39:45.210
[SPEAKER_10]: Caffeine?

39:45.370 --> 39:45.770
[SPEAKER_10]: Caffeine.

39:45.950 --> 39:46.251
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

39:47.351 --> 39:48.272
[SPEAKER_10]: Online play.

39:48.392 --> 39:48.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Cage match winner?

39:50.774 --> 39:54.276
[SPEAKER_10]: Cage match winner is... Caffeine.

39:54.396 --> 39:55.577
[SPEAKER_10]: Caffeine won everything!

39:55.917 --> 39:56.598
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, duh.

39:56.638 --> 39:57.378
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I had to look.

39:57.418 --> 39:58.839
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a landslide tonight, kids.

39:59.980 --> 40:00.981
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you even have to ask...

40:02.233 --> 40:11.609
[SPEAKER_10]: Chunky XL For their song about caffeine Tally Hall did get quite a bit of love but not enough unfortunately in the Ezoic They got true love!

40:11.709 --> 40:13.472
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody forgot about the Ezoic apparently

40:15.056 --> 40:17.637
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to admit, though, the Junkie XL song's pretty good.

40:17.657 --> 40:20.058
[SPEAKER_09]: Compared to most Loki picks, it's pretty good.

40:20.418 --> 40:31.203
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the Junkie XL one, I didn't have any Cage Munch picks, and we were asked to submit some more songs for rotation, so I've got some full-auto ones coming, too.

40:31.223 --> 40:35.564
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure about anything else from Burnout, because it's all like butt rock to me.

40:35.905 --> 40:38.186
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't need to overdo it on the butt rock.

40:40.091 --> 40:43.033
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a special moment right now.

40:43.153 --> 40:43.793
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd like to take...

41:09.332 --> 41:14.715
[SPEAKER_04]: This time to tell all the kids at home, send your parents out of the room, this is a kid's song.

41:16.656 --> 41:20.098
[SPEAKER_05]: Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up.

41:20.118 --> 41:23.679
[SPEAKER_05]: Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.681
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, if you know the words, sing along!

41:26.921 --> 41:30.403
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna have to mow the lawn, do the dishes, make your bed.

41:30.603 --> 41:33.384
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna have to go to school until you're 17.

41:34.085 --> 41:36.966
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna seem about three times as long as that.

41:37.206 --> 41:38.247
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have to go

41:41.371 --> 41:43.495
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, cheer up kids, it gets a lot worse.

41:47.500 --> 42:12.088
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna have to deal with stress, deal with stress, deal with stress You're gonna be a giant mess when you get back from the war Santa Claus does not exist and there's no Easter Bunny You'll find out when you grow up that Big Bird isn't funny Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now

42:14.474 --> 42:22.697
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke and Clack on your back, face the fact You're gonna end up hooked on smack and then you're gonna die And then you're gonna die

42:41.912 --> 42:44.165
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think I smell a lawsuit in that one.

42:44.205 --> 42:44.728
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?
