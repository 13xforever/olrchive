00:00.000 --> 00:10.240
Hi, we're back here for the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth, the part of the show that's

00:10.240 --> 00:17.280
too hot to podcast, because Bugd is going to show us his boobies right now.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.280
Whew!

00:18.280 --> 00:21.080
Hooray for boobies.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
That's next week.

00:22.080 --> 00:27.240
Alright, so here we are, just kind of chilling, sitting back here, kind of decompressing a

00:27.240 --> 00:28.440
little bit from tonight's show.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.600
You know, the first half of tonight's show is an hour and a half?

00:31.400 --> 00:31.900
Craziness.

00:31.900 --> 00:32.400
Crazy.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.100
That's, I think, our longest segment we've ever done.

00:35.100 --> 00:35.600
Wait, you have three ha-

00:35.600 --> 00:37.440
We just can't shut up, like, ever.

00:37.440 --> 00:38.660
You have three halves of a show.

00:39.700 --> 00:40.820
Yeah, seriously.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.100
Um...

00:42.840 --> 00:44.040
Oh, I like this, you like this.

00:44.040 --> 00:48.120
Right at the end of the show, here comes, uh, Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com into the chat room.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.080
He just came in there and he said, uh, let's see, da-da-da-da-da.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.160
Uh...

00:52.760 --> 00:53.780
I said, what's up?

00:53.780 --> 00:55.200
And he says, you're cancelled.

00:55.200 --> 00:55.980
I'm like, what?

00:55.980 --> 00:57.480
He said, oh no, just messing with you guys.

00:57.480 --> 01:00.880
What a jerk! You jerk!

01:00.880 --> 01:04.000
My whole problem with Captain N, like I said...

01:04.000 --> 01:07.320
Wait, wait, this is random. Where's this coming from? This is because of the Captain N thing.

01:07.320 --> 01:10.600
He was actually replying to me. Gotcha.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.880
My whole problem with the Captain N thing is because I loved following the

01:13.880 --> 01:14.560
stories

01:14.560 --> 01:19.480
ever since I was little and to see characters that I had loved in the games

01:19.480 --> 01:22.000
being just trashed so horribly

01:22.000 --> 01:25.280
for the sake of marketing just completely pissed me off.

01:25.280 --> 01:30.680
Even though I did watch the show religiously cuz like the Zelda episodes were redeeming

01:30.680 --> 01:32.680
I thought the Tetris thing was pretty freaking funny

01:32.840 --> 01:40.080
But and that and I love mother brain and the eggplant wizard Dennis Hopper as Koopa. Yeah, there was that yeah

01:40.080 --> 01:41.680
There was that

01:41.680 --> 01:43.480
but

01:43.480 --> 01:50.240
There were just so many things I could not get over in that even as a little kid that to this day. I have this

01:50.240 --> 01:55.200
long-standing, I wouldn't say a hatred but a frustration with the whole Captain

01:55.200 --> 02:05.680
N franchise. You know what's funny? The fact that I never watched Captain N. No, not Captain N. I was reading

02:05.680 --> 02:10.840
there was another news story that came out this week regarding G4 and how

02:10.840 --> 02:16.540
they're doing Star Trek 2.0 on their station basically putting on the old

02:16.540 --> 02:20.040
episodes of Star Trek and having a bunch of different counters and stuff like

02:20.040 --> 02:24.560
how many times you know spot Star Trek exactly it's like how many times you

02:24.560 --> 02:32.000
know Spock says you know logical or illogical and like crap like that have

02:32.000 --> 02:37.520
they stopped playing video game programming on that station because or

02:37.520 --> 02:40.960
new video game programming maybe other than attack the show because they have

02:40.960 --> 02:44.200
like a lot of filler and I don't understand why they got rid of these old

02:44.200 --> 02:46.200
shows

02:46.200 --> 02:50.560
i kinda don't care i'd i just don't care anymore

02:50.560 --> 02:52.640

hi you're on orange launch radio

05:49.040 --> 05:52.840
hey what's up boss obviously you already know who i am

05:52.840 --> 05:54.800
hello zacku

05:54.800 --> 05:59.040
yeah what's up boss not much we want to finish up tonight's show so you got to keep it short

05:59.040 --> 06:04.320
what's on your mind basically i'm just you know i yesterday i went to an anime convention i was

06:04.320 --> 06:10.640
lucky to play you know 2dx and popping on the respective ascs um i don't know is if it's normal

06:10.640 --> 06:16.720
but it's i mean the transition between both of them it's kind of strange and i know for a fact

06:16.720 --> 06:22.960
and when i was playing 2dx it was just like my scores decreased as a result because i'm used to

06:22.960 --> 06:27.400
to the KLC I don't know if there's anything you can help me you know any

06:27.400 --> 06:31.880
advice you give me if I try what was the controller they were using I'm you

06:31.880 --> 06:36.680
currently I'm using a KLC and what were they using then this do bought in an

06:36.680 --> 06:40.760
ASC yesterday for 2dx and poppin oh you know what it's it's the turntable

06:40.760 --> 06:45.120
differences is gonna write you up yeah um you know there's really not a lot

06:45.120 --> 06:48.800
it's just one of those practice but it's you're not gonna get enough time to get

06:48.800 --> 06:51.720
adjusted at a convention you're not gonna have the time to get adjusted to

06:51.720 --> 06:57.320
Well actually I was there for hours, I mean I was on the 2DX setup for like several hours.

06:57.320 --> 07:02.200
So you know, at least three to four hours because it was very small, no one was really

07:02.200 --> 07:04.040
there in the 2DX setup.

07:04.040 --> 07:07.080
I honestly don't know what to tell you bud, it's just kind of one of those things you

07:07.080 --> 07:11.600
just have to get used to, there's really no way I can tell you to, my thing is that maybe

07:11.600 --> 07:15.460
you get used to one playing style on the home controller, but here's the thing, the big

07:15.460 --> 07:20.360
trick to being able to scratch in 2DX is that, and this takes a while to get the hang of,

07:20.360 --> 07:24.360
the pinky scratching. You have to be able to move that turntable with your pinky, and

07:24.360 --> 07:25.360
I know it sounds a little crazy.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.360
Yeah, I tend to do that as well.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.360
Well, you really gotta master that.

07:29.360 --> 07:35.360
Digital life this year in New York City. You know, the annual thing. I know you tried valiantly

07:35.360 --> 07:37.360
to try to make plans last year.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.360
When is digital life this year?

07:39.360 --> 07:43.360
It should be in October. You know, they already announced, you know, they already pre-announced

07:43.360 --> 07:45.360
it, you know, the event.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
Yeah, I'll try to come.

07:46.360 --> 07:51.300
So, you know, you know as soon as they left the convention center as a sign that said see you next year

07:51.300 --> 07:56.960
Yeah, I said the dates in mid-october. I'm not sure you know, I haven't got confirmation about the you know

07:56.960 --> 08:01.900
The the big GDR Nationals tournament being held up, but most likely they will hold it up assuming

08:01.900 --> 08:08.720
You know now that supernovas, you know getting you know more getting likely to get you know, they're being really good

08:09.540 --> 08:11.780
So, I don't know if you're gonna make plans for it

08:11.780 --> 08:16.120
I just want to know if you know if if you are gonna make plans or something like that

08:17.700 --> 08:22.500
What for digital life yeah, if you're planning to go out there do something live or something

08:24.860 --> 08:29.100
Like what it's like about it's a budget thing for us

08:29.100 --> 08:33.520
I mean if we had the money to do it we would but we're still you know we don't make money off of doing this

08:33.520 --> 08:37.460
We do this show because I love it, and I think people sometimes forget that sometimes right

08:37.460 --> 08:42.140
especially some of the reviews I read on the internet people obviously don't get

08:42.140 --> 08:45.560
that we do this for free but whatever you know we look past that because you

08:45.560 --> 08:51.760
know we're not gonna let people's bad-mouthing get us down but you know if

08:51.760 --> 08:54.740
we have the money I'm sure we'll try but it'll be an individual thing I mean

08:54.740 --> 08:57.680
we'll have to decide as individuals if we can accommodate into our schedule I

08:57.680 --> 09:00.640
would love to try and come I have a good friend in New York City that would let

09:00.640 --> 09:08.880
stay there. So maybe. I would say probably I would do it. And I would say probably I'm

09:08.880 --> 09:13.000
more likely to do it than Dark Sakura or Loki. I don't know. Are you guys thinking about

09:13.000 --> 09:20.240
this or? I don't have the available time off. Especially since there are other things that's

09:20.240 --> 09:24.440
true to be discussed. Oh, that reminds me. I do have to I do have to bring up the Seattle

09:24.440 --> 09:27.800
convention that we were talking about last week. I'm not going to be able to make it.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.520
just too soon for us, I'm sorry to say.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.120
I do have a friend going to Sakura Con.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.800
Uh, just putting it out there, you know.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.140
No, no, obviously, yeah, we'll definitely consider it, you know, but just, it's a money

09:36.140 --> 09:37.140
thing for us.

09:37.140 --> 09:43.080
Um, Anime Expo, not gonna happen for me, um, I totally forgot that I have plans to go to

09:43.080 --> 09:45.280
Canada to celebrate the 4th of July.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.280
Making arrangements-

09:46.280 --> 09:47.280
Just to be funny.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.400
Actually, just to, I can't say which one yet, I am making arrangements for another convention.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.400
Sweet!

09:51.400 --> 09:52.400
Alright.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.400
Alright.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.600
Alright, well, Zaku, thanks for the call, and take care, okay?

09:56.600 --> 09:58.120
Alright. Later, man.

09:58.120 --> 10:01.240
Sorry to the calls we didn't get to, but we gotta wrap up tonight's show,

10:01.240 --> 10:04.760
because we want to, you know, go back to our regular lives.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.560
So, we're gonna get into tonight's cage match.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.240
Wait, wait. You guys have lives outside of this?

10:09.240 --> 10:11.160
Believe it or not, once in a while.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.080
That's my problem. I keep forgetting that part.

10:14.520 --> 10:17.800
Alright. Let's see here. I gotta find the theme music here.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.800
My directories are all screwed up now.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.360
Loki, remind our listeners how the cage match works while I set this up.

10:26.360 --> 10:30.600
The cage match works. Basically we have three songs that are put in by each one of the hosts.

10:31.800 --> 10:36.600
Then we play each song in its entirety except for the one that won.

10:36.600 --> 10:43.400
And the winning song of the cage match is put in the rotation and will come up, you know,

10:43.400 --> 10:48.760
to be challenged by two more songs next week. And the actual listeners in our chat room get

10:48.760 --> 10:52.040
the vote on them to see which one goes on. Sweet!

10:52.040 --> 10:57.040
Alright, uh, let's see, I'm trying to find the song here from last week.

10:57.040 --> 11:01.040
I was exhausted tonight, I'm sorry guys.

11:01.040 --> 11:07.040
I apologize to our live listeners, they've had to put up with a lot of crap tonight, so I apologize.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.040
Lame it all on caffeine!

11:09.040 --> 11:11.040

13:20.140 --> 13:26.140
And we call the anguish in sight

13:26.140 --> 13:30.140
Anguish in sight

13:30.140 --> 13:33.140
Anguish in sight

13:33.140 --> 13:36.140
Anguish in sight

13:36.140 --> 13:39.140
Anguish in sight

13:39.140 --> 13:41.140
They say

13:41.140 --> 13:46.140
Can't I be your window light?

13:46.140 --> 13:59.140
Alright, that was song number one in tonight's CAGEMATCH, the Azoic with Going Under, the

13:59.140 --> 14:00.140
Kinetic Mix.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.220
We'll see if it can win two weeks in a row, but it's gotta beat these songs.

14:03.220 --> 14:04.620
Loki, what's song number two tonight?

14:04.620 --> 14:08.940
Ah, this song is one of my favorite songs from Burnout Revenge.

14:08.940 --> 14:13.040
It's actually by Junky XL, and it's a song called Today, and it kinda reminds me a little

14:13.040 --> 14:16.060
bit of Depeche Mode and Away, but it's an awesome song.

14:16.060 --> 14:25.180
favorite bar none of all the tracks are on the burnout series so that would be

14:25.180 --> 14:29.740
pretty awesome I actually look for the album because the album this is the

14:29.740 --> 14:34.240
title from the album so all right sounds good here's song number two tonight

14:34.240 --> 14:38.640
junkie XL with today from burnout

15:34.240 --> 15:59.240
Got the bluest eyes that I have seen Lost out in the skies caught in a dream

15:59.240 --> 16:02.240
What you whispered to me

16:02.240 --> 16:06.240
And breathing to my veins

16:06.240 --> 16:09.240
I believe in magic

16:09.240 --> 16:15.240
To wash away this pain

16:15.240 --> 16:22.240
And it feels like today

16:22.240 --> 16:29.240
Took your soul down tight and let it slip away

16:29.240 --> 16:36.240
And it feels like today

16:36.240 --> 16:43.240
Took your sword untied and let it slip away

16:43.240 --> 17:07.240
Give me all the weight that holds you down

17:07.240 --> 17:15.240
Don't let it stop, I'm burning for the sand

17:15.240 --> 17:21.240
And the world keeps moving

17:21.240 --> 17:25.240
It's all I've ever known

17:25.240 --> 17:29.240
And I know inside that

17:29.240 --> 17:34.240
I'll never be alone

17:34.240 --> 17:42.240
And it feels like today

17:42.240 --> 17:49.240
So just hold on tight and let it slip away

17:49.240 --> 17:57.240
And it feels like today

17:57.240 --> 18:03.740
So just hold on tight and let it slip away

18:27.240 --> 18:29.240
Oh

18:57.240 --> 19:24.600
And it feels like today So just hold on tight and let it slip away

19:24.600 --> 19:31.720
And it feels like today

19:31.720 --> 19:39.080
So just hold on tight and let it slip away

19:39.080 --> 19:46.280
And it feels like today

19:46.280 --> 19:53.640
So just hold on tight and let it slip away

19:53.640 --> 20:00.640
And it feels like today

20:00.640 --> 20:07.440
So just hold on tight and let it slip away

20:30.640 --> 20:32.640
Oh

21:00.640 --> 21:22.240
song number two that was junkie XL with today let's see what the studio folks

21:22.240 --> 21:24.920
thought of that but remember it is up to you guys you have to be in our chat room

21:24.920 --> 21:31.480
to vote. Dark Sakura. That one was pretty neato. Um, it gets, uh, an eight. Loki. Ten.

21:31.480 --> 21:37.440
I love it. I play all my races to that song. Bud. Ten, because, uh, I also play many of

21:37.440 --> 21:42.900
my burnout races to that song. Uh, this is very rare for me to do, but the only thing

21:42.900 --> 21:46.480
wrong with that song is that it's a little bit long, but it's perfect for this station.

21:46.480 --> 21:51.760
Ten. Alright, let's go to, uh, song number three tonight. Dark Sakura, what'd you pick?

21:51.760 --> 21:57.340
I have Roz to blame for this one. It's a Tally Hall song. It's called Twooove.

21:57.340 --> 21:58.340
Twooove?

21:58.340 --> 21:59.340
Twooove.

21:59.340 --> 22:01.140
Is that like the Princess Bride?

22:01.140 --> 22:02.140
Marriage.

22:02.140 --> 22:03.140
Twoo!

22:03.140 --> 22:04.140
Marriage!

22:04.140 --> 22:05.140
Twooove!

22:05.140 --> 22:06.140
Marriage!

22:06.140 --> 22:07.140
Twooove!

22:07.140 --> 22:08.140
Tuck. Scum.

22:08.140 --> 22:13.540
Alright, here we go. We're gonna go to Tally Hall with Twooove. Here it is, song number

22:13.540 --> 22:14.540
three tonight.

22:14.540 --> 22:32.540
I have this little thing, it's probably just a fling

22:32.540 --> 22:39.540
Two girls I like a lot, I think they're really hot

22:39.540 --> 22:46.540
But I'm not sure if they know How my love began to grow

22:46.540 --> 22:55.540
It took a lot of time But right now it's solely mine

22:55.540 --> 22:57.540
To the day!

22:57.540 --> 23:04.540
I drew a mural of The things I'd like to love

23:04.540 --> 23:07.540
And where my heart resides

23:07.540 --> 23:11.540
Is with two girls with grey eyes

23:11.540 --> 23:13.540
If it just gave me a chance

23:13.540 --> 23:16.540
I'd show them what they want and teach them what they got

23:16.540 --> 23:19.540
I'd single each and every one of their fancies

23:19.540 --> 23:22.540
I'd take the key to my heart and open it

23:22.540 --> 23:24.540
And let their love shine through

23:24.540 --> 23:27.540
Mary came and I see, I hope you understand

23:27.540 --> 23:30.540
That I love you a lot and I want to be your man

23:30.540 --> 23:38.040
And I think, that it'd be totally cool if I grabbed your apartment and enrolled in a school

23:38.040 --> 23:39.540
MARY KATE!

23:39.540 --> 23:46.540
I saw you on TV, you dressed up like a bee

23:46.540 --> 23:53.540
Reminds me of the time, how it's gone, and it's gone, and it's gone

23:53.540 --> 23:58.540
The sun is every day that passes without you

23:58.540 --> 24:03.540
And I really wanna, really wanna, really wanna hold you both tight

24:03.540 --> 24:06.540
And tight for your mind because I see

24:06.540 --> 24:09.540
Mary came and asked me, I hope you understand

24:09.540 --> 24:12.540
That I love you a lot and I wanna be your man

24:12.540 --> 24:16.540
And I think that it'd be totally cool

24:16.540 --> 24:20.540
If I'm around your apartment, sending gold in your school

24:23.540 --> 24:24.540
Hello?

24:24.540 --> 24:25.540
Hello?

24:25.540 --> 24:26.540
Hello?

24:26.540 --> 24:27.540
Hey, I'm calling from Talley Hall

24:27.540 --> 24:29.540

24:29.540 --> 24:30.540
Hello?

24:30.540 --> 24:31.540
Hello?

24:31.540 --> 24:33.540
Hey, I'm calling from Talley Hall and I just-

24:34.540 --> 24:37.540
Mary-Kate and Ashley, I hope you understand

24:37.540 --> 24:42.540
That I love you a lot and I wanna be your man and I think

24:42.540 --> 24:48.540
That it'd be totally cool if I came around your apartment and enrolled in your school

24:51.540 --> 24:59.540
I know that life without you and you would be sad

24:59.540 --> 25:02.540
And I know it'd be bad

25:02.540 --> 25:09.540
Merrick and Ashley, I hope you understand that your loveliness blossomed and I want to hold your hands

25:09.540 --> 25:16.960
and I think that it'd be totally cool if I hung around your apartment and has gone into school

25:16.960 --> 25:23.800
Mary Kate and Ashley I hope you understand that I love you a lot, and I wanna be a man

25:23.800 --> 25:30.980
And I think that it'd be totally cool if I hung around your apartment and has gone into school

25:30.980 --> 25:37.580
Mary Kate and Ashley I hope you understand that I love you a lot, and I wanna be a man

25:37.580 --> 25:41.040
And I'm thinking, wouldn't you say that it'd be totally cool

25:41.040 --> 25:45.040
If I were a round-jawing, fronting, sending, going to school

25:45.040 --> 25:48.460
Larry Keaton, actually, I hope you understand that

25:48.460 --> 25:51.960
I love you a lot, and I want you to be with me

25:54.960 --> 25:58.460
Song number three tonight, Tally Hall with Twi'wuv

25:58.460 --> 26:01.200
Did you wuv that song, or did you hate it?

26:01.200 --> 26:01.860
Dark Sakura

26:01.860 --> 26:03.520
It gets a ten for being ridiculous

26:04.300 --> 26:04.800
Loki

26:04.800 --> 26:09.800
It is ridiculous. Everyone knows it's pre-Anorexic Lindsay Lohan that's worth loving.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.800
Can you score?

26:12.800 --> 26:13.800
Huh? Oh.

26:13.800 --> 26:14.800
Can you score?

26:14.800 --> 26:15.800
Seven.

26:15.800 --> 26:16.800
All right.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.800
I'll give it eight. It had a good beat and you can dance to it.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.800
All right.

26:20.800 --> 26:24.800
And I will give it the combined weight of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, which is eight.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.800
Eight pounds. That's how much they weigh.

26:26.800 --> 26:30.800
All right. It's definitely a genre night.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.920
We've got real actually I think it's a like all the songs are actually really good tonight

26:33.920 --> 26:39.000
I think in their respective genres, so it all comes down to what you like best. It's your choice chat room here

26:39.000 --> 26:44.640

27:47.640 --> 27:52.600
Let's recap there. Hopefully some folks are still connected. They're just a little soundboard problem on my end. Sorry guys

27:53.280 --> 28:00.920
Let's go back place vote now. And here we go. How was your week? How was your day? Loki starting us off tonight. Anyways, I

28:01.640 --> 28:04.760
We're starting to finalize more stuff for the wedding. We

28:05.280 --> 28:10.900
Set aside some time to or we're going to go pick up our marriage license

28:10.900 --> 28:15.860
and we're also we just sent out the rest of the invitations we have someone now

28:15.860 --> 28:21.060
making favors and just kind of some of that stuff and I've been playing video

28:21.060 --> 28:27.700
games most of the week and just work stuff you know trying to you know finish

28:27.700 --> 28:35.020
March and get April started you know fun stuff and then we did a marathon session

28:35.020 --> 28:39.580
of grant that thought of Liberty City stories after work last week we got to

28:39.580 --> 28:44.280
play one of the brand new or one of the modes that they have on there. It's tanks

28:44.280 --> 28:48.280
for memories and that's actually pretty fun. You start off and you pick up the

28:48.280 --> 28:51.640
tank and then once you're in the tank everybody else is trying to blow up the

28:51.640 --> 28:56.680
tank. You're trying to stay in the tank for a set amount of time and so your

28:56.680 --> 28:59.760
timer is counting down while you're in the tank. If your tank explodes the

28:59.760 --> 29:04.780
person that destroyed the tank gets the tank now and they respawn in another

29:04.780 --> 29:13.060
spot so it's pretty fun the tape doesn't move hardly at all and it's pretty cool

29:13.060 --> 29:17.980
it's definitely a change from the normal deathmatch games we play so that's

29:17.980 --> 29:21.860
pretty cool I'm hoping that they the next Grand Theft Auto that comes out

29:21.860 --> 29:27.500
does support more players because six players is fun but I mean I would like

29:27.500 --> 29:33.540
maybe ten or twelve at the most I think would be really good get some good team

29:33.540 --> 29:40.100
matches going on there other than that really not too much else just I had

29:40.100 --> 29:46.420
garlic on Friday and I still smell like garlic today after like numerous showers

29:46.420 --> 29:51.060
and brushing my teeth I that smell does not go away you smell like garlic I

29:51.060 --> 29:55.840
smell like a mocha I'm still tasting curry from Thursday night I only have

29:55.840 --> 29:59.200
one for full

29:59.200 --> 30:00.320
uh... that it

30:00.320 --> 30:01.840
that's it uh...

30:01.840 --> 30:02.840
dark sakura

30:02.840 --> 30:06.200
going around she is used as you know that in their apartments trapping cats

30:06.200 --> 30:07.720
now fun

30:07.720 --> 30:09.400
but how should we go today

30:09.400 --> 30:12.800
my week with my week was rather uneventful the let's see how to

30:12.800 --> 30:14.420
whirlwind tour through

30:14.420 --> 30:17.200
through the barrier to drop stuff off and pick stuff up

30:17.200 --> 30:19.120
for the roommate and i

30:19.120 --> 30:20.380
as we are

30:20.380 --> 30:24.900
both rather unemployed and still needing to pay bills or selling off stuff is if

30:24.900 --> 30:29.580
If anybody needs computers, I got some.

30:29.580 --> 30:31.940
I'm out of hard drives.

30:31.940 --> 30:34.940
I already sold all those off.

30:34.940 --> 30:35.940
But.

30:35.940 --> 30:36.940
No.

30:36.940 --> 30:45.380
In fact, my roommate is waiting on a replacement screen for his ThinkPad, so.

30:45.380 --> 30:53.620
Whirlwind Tour, playing video games, raiding trash heaps, finding Macs of all things, and

30:53.620 --> 30:58.460
reconstituting him into machines to be sold.

30:58.460 --> 31:01.340
Yes, exciting. Oh, and playing Diablo II.

31:01.340 --> 31:02.260
Fun times.

31:02.260 --> 31:08.020
My week and my day was pretty good. I went to Roseville Golf Land on

31:08.020 --> 31:12.060
Friday... no, Saturday. Last night. Yeah, last night. I'm drunk.

31:12.060 --> 31:15.060
No, I'm not. For the first time in forever.

31:15.060 --> 31:16.400
It was

31:16.400 --> 31:17.880
interesting.

31:17.880 --> 31:22.060
I actually had a lot of fun playing, like, Initial D and stuff and

31:22.060 --> 31:25.020
uh... just kinda you know being there with uh... couple people

31:25.020 --> 31:26.060
but uh...

31:26.060 --> 31:30.060
ddr was still can ask the but i a you know i find that i i like this and it's

31:30.060 --> 31:32.520
not the game itself there's nothing wrong game is just a machine in the

31:32.520 --> 31:36.540
upkeep of it at roseville's is growing up he and i hate the key i hate the

31:36.540 --> 31:38.260
people that go to roseville gobbling

31:38.260 --> 31:41.500
roseville golf will be wonderful with the nuclear holocaust hit it

31:41.500 --> 31:43.420
and only me and my friends survived

31:43.420 --> 31:45.580
now would be great if it took a grant of pay

31:45.580 --> 31:50.660
uh... honestly yes so uh... you know uh... i had an okay time

31:50.660 --> 31:53.180
That's that's really all I feel like sharing this Mario Kart

31:53.960 --> 31:59.120
Mario Kart's okay. I mean I I didn't play it. They have any other games new games. I heard the wolves

31:59.120 --> 32:02.740
I wanted to play a wagon a wagon midnight maximum

32:02.740 --> 32:07.240
What was it that fucking all the thugs were on that yet about the road one of the Roseville theaters

32:07.240 --> 32:12.740
This was that time crisis for I haven't checked it out or not time crisis for house. How's that? Yeah, no

32:12.740 --> 32:16.420
I haven't checked it out. That's a UCD that one spike was here last week

32:16.420 --> 32:18.180
And I believe told us that was at century

32:18.180 --> 32:23.380
Wherever Nightwatch is playing in Roseau because that's what they went and saw so that's what he where he would have seen it hmm

32:23.540 --> 32:26.580
So oh, this is funny because um

32:28.100 --> 32:34.100
Out there in the living room right now everything is labeled in Russian because extra fur is learning Russian and

32:35.040 --> 32:37.040
Loki's fiance is teaching it to him and

32:37.340 --> 32:43.540
So they've taken index cards and labeled everything in the living room in Russian and like it actually has to stay up for like a couple

32:43.540 --> 32:46.560
weeks so that should be interesting you're going to be learning you're

32:46.560 --> 32:49.480
very like I don't know how to read it your front room looks like a rushing

32:49.480 --> 32:52.300
kindergarten it does it was a Russian kindergarten right now it's kind of

32:52.300 --> 32:57.720
scary but you need to buy some beats some fresh beats I'll listen to some

32:57.720 --> 33:02.800
tattoo that's what I'll do fresh beats in your house if I lose vodka if I

33:02.800 --> 33:06.360
listen I listen to a lot of tattoo I'm either gonna learn Russian or become a

33:06.360 --> 33:11.440
lesbian one of the two I mean a fake lesbian dark Sakura how was your week

33:11.440 --> 33:17.560
Oh Confusion Friday night was badass by the way. Yes it was. We had a good time picture hoarded up. It was great. Mistress Tia

33:17.920 --> 33:21.680
Love her. I actually I ripped off some of my pictures too. I was

33:22.600 --> 33:28.060
Confusion was probably the most was the highlight of my week because the rest of my week was shit

33:28.060 --> 33:32.560
Oh, I'm sorry, by the way, just a quick FYI Jason wanted me to let you know that the pictures are up

33:32.560 --> 33:35.920
So I'm gonna grab them and I'll send them to you later. Cool cuz I need the one. There's a pic that

33:35.920 --> 33:40.160
extra partook of me with the camera of doing the too much metal for one hand

33:40.160 --> 33:43.920
I'll get him from Jason and I'm pretty sure I don't need my space photo okay

33:43.920 --> 33:47.960
that I should check he usually puts all my stuff in a he has a website on my

33:47.960 --> 33:52.360
space playing a bass which is what I was doing last night cool I went over to miss

33:52.360 --> 34:00.640
Tia's house apartment to uh now I am I am a vegetarian now except for fish I

34:00.640 --> 34:06.320
will eat fish but um I we have to every so often because me and Tia and her

34:06.320 --> 34:12.320
roommate Jovan are like the Sacramento Southern collection so we had fried

34:12.320 --> 34:16.640
chicken and biscuits and red beans and rice and mashed potatoes and gravy

34:16.640 --> 34:22.840
homemade no Popeyes which is close enough very close very very southern so

34:22.840 --> 34:26.120
we all were getting our fried chicken on and of course because I haven't eaten a

34:26.120 --> 34:30.420
lot of meat and a lot at eating at whatever meat and a long time the

34:30.420 --> 34:33.920
chicken made me very sick but I was all happy and we were watching the the best

34:33.920 --> 34:36.800
little whorehouse in Texas and really not getting into it so I started playing

34:36.800 --> 34:40.560
this base that was in their living room and I actually picked out a few lines so

34:40.560 --> 34:43.640
I think I've got some talent for it but I'm supposed to be getting one of these

34:43.640 --> 34:51.680
for my birthday hint hint hint which is next month which still depresses me the

34:51.680 --> 34:58.320
So the rest of my week, I blew off school because I was just all, you know, whatever.

34:58.320 --> 35:06.920
And then I decided that because for background, for people, I don't have a lot of free time.

35:06.920 --> 35:09.200
As in, I have no free time.

35:09.200 --> 35:14.920
So I dropped a class so that I would not completely lose my sanity and my health.

35:14.920 --> 35:18.800
I dropped color theory also because going in that classroom makes me have headaches

35:18.800 --> 35:20.320
from acrylic paint fumes.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.600
Fun, huh?

35:21.600 --> 35:26.920
So I'm going to be taking it next spring and working part time, blah blah blah.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.400
Sometimes you have to make those sacrifices for your health.

35:29.400 --> 35:37.820
Unfortunately it's going to keep me in school for another, I'd say at least another semester.

35:37.820 --> 35:43.000
So and then that's really what my week has been is me trying to decide whether or not

35:43.000 --> 35:44.420
I was going to drop that class.

35:44.420 --> 35:46.160
And so I did.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.800
I'm an academic failure.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.000
I have a W on my transcript now.

35:50.000 --> 35:58.520
a big deal based on looking at by the way is a LP the veteran I don't know

35:58.520 --> 36:03.280
somebody posted a picture to my myspace of a Batsmaru guitar it's so hard I know

36:03.280 --> 36:08.720
about the Batsmaru bass and the ratings on it are not the best a couple of them

36:08.720 --> 36:15.200
that I'm looking at. But it's a Batsmaru bass. Didn't we see that? You don't buy it cuz it looks good you buy it cuz it

36:15.200 --> 36:20.960
sounds good whatever you can always paint it or finish it or put stickers on it or

36:20.960 --> 36:24.000
something you and i have painfully uh painfully different priorities

36:26.880 --> 36:30.080
all right uh we're ready to get to the chat room if use are you are you all

36:30.080 --> 36:34.160
wrapped up for the record i'm not a vegetarian for ethical reason i'm

36:34.160 --> 36:38.080
i don't eat meat because it makes me sick

36:38.080 --> 36:41.740

36:52.520 --> 36:55.620

37:06.320 --> 37:10.080

37:27.920 --> 37:31.200

Show is worthless.

37:32.240 --> 37:37.820
Phoenix would like to say F you to all the haters who downvote my YTMNDs and the people

37:37.820 --> 37:44.900
in chat who wanted to kick me because I shamelessly plugged my new YTMND, which he'll post the

37:44.900 --> 37:46.700
link in chat room if you want to see that.

37:46.700 --> 37:51.680
I'm not going to try and read it, it's too many abbreviations.

37:51.680 --> 37:56.000
Ryoma would like to say F you to security guards not letting me in the LJ's mosh.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.320

37:59.320 --> 38:04.640

38:04.640 --> 38:08.080
Loki why did we report it would be less?

38:08.080 --> 38:09.080
What now?

38:09.080 --> 38:10.080
Beatmania?

38:10.080 --> 38:11.080
We said it was going to be $40.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.080
What happened?

38:12.080 --> 38:13.080
The price changed.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.080
Didn't you read the forms?

38:14.080 --> 38:16.640
I guess.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.880
Not our fault.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.080
Tigerclaw I know it happens.

38:19.080 --> 38:22.440
Amazon was running the same thing for a while so you know it wasn't just us.

38:22.440 --> 38:24.800
I mean they changed their mind on what they want the price at.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.200
Well poopy on you guys.

38:26.200 --> 38:30.540
All right, Tigerclaw would like to say F you to all the captain and haters.

38:30.540 --> 38:34.420

38:34.420 --> 38:35.300

38:37.780 --> 38:41.060
F you to Slackware for not linking the non-normal video card on the computer I was

38:41.060 --> 38:42.160

39:09.860 --> 39:11.140
Amen to that.

39:11.140 --> 39:15.940
Frickin' Xbox 360. Removing Judas Priest stickers from your base does not make you any less gay.

39:15.940 --> 39:17.000
Stop it.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.260

Did you even have to ask...

40:01.860 --> 40:03.860
Junkie XL.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.860
For their song about Kapeen.

40:06.860 --> 40:09.860
Tally Hall did get quite a bit of love, but not enough, unfortunately, in the Azoic.

40:09.860 --> 40:11.860
They got true love!

40:11.860 --> 40:13.860
Everybody forgot about the Azoic, apparently.

40:13.860 --> 40:14.860
Aww.

40:14.860 --> 40:16.860
I have to admit, though, the Junkie XL song's pretty good.

40:16.860 --> 40:17.860
Well, we're gonna have that.

40:17.860 --> 40:19.860
Compared to most Loki picks, it's pretty good.

41:36.560 --> 41:40.560
You might have to go to war, shoot a gun, kill a nun.

41:40.560 --> 41:43.560
You might have to go to war when you get out of school.

41:43.560 --> 41:46.560
Ain't sure up kids, it gets a lot worse.

41:46.560 --> 41:50.560
You're gonna have to deal with stress, deal with stress, deal with stress.

41:50.560 --> 41:54.560
You're gonna be a giant mess when you get back from the war.

41:54.560 --> 41:57.560
Santa Claus does not exist and there's no Easter Bunny.

41:57.560 --> 42:01.560
You'll find out when you grow up that brick where it isn't funny.

42:01.560 --> 42:03.560
Funny! Funny!

42:03.560 --> 42:08.520
