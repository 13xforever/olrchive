1
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:17,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight, March 5th, 2006, a unique look at Destination PlayStation.

2
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:21,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Japan votes on its top 100 games of all time, and we give our opinion on the results.

3
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:27,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com joins us to talk about what's new on their website this week.

4
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:34,978
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels so good to be back.

5
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:36,399
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even know.

6
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:43,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 175 for this March the 5th of 2006.

7
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:46,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Our first show back after a little bit of a vacation there.

8
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,532
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura and I had plans that took us out of town.

9
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:55,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Real life gets in the way of independent podcasting sometimes so we took a little time off.

10
00:00:55,857 --> 00:01:05,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, lovely job filling in there the past couple weeks with little, just short shows, just, it's a little bit of crack, just to hold you over, though, so we appreciate that.

11
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:06,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

12
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And just so you guys know, that wasn't the original plan.

13
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:17,138
[SPEAKER_05]: The original plan is that DarkSakura, myself, and Loki were all gonna do one show, but DarkSakura was having, like, mic issues or something at her house.

14
00:01:17,158 --> 00:01:19,140
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was broke, and couldn't buy anyone.

15
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:22,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I made do with my headset mic on pump.

16
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:39,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just waiting for some witty retort.

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought an iBook and the plan was to do a podcast for my brand new iBook.

18
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:44,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to do that.

19
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:46,485
[SPEAKER_05]: That didn't work out too well, did it?

20
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:47,286
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

21
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:48,346
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the iBook's fault.

22
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:50,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I love my iBook.

23
00:01:50,888 --> 00:01:51,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

24
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:52,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Loki.

25
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,950
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole Mac thing.

26
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally on Jamie's side now.

27
00:01:55,912 --> 00:01:57,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the iBook.

28
00:01:57,293 --> 00:01:57,733
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

29
00:01:57,793 --> 00:01:58,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm...

30
00:01:59,054 --> 00:02:02,297
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes to computers, I still consider myself bi.

31
00:02:03,097 --> 00:02:03,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I love PC.

32
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.

33
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Some days I want a PC, some days I want a Mac.

34
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:13,205
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really have appreciated what both have to offer there.

35
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:15,467
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got an iBook.

36
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:17,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wasn't able to do the podcasting on it.

37
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:22,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was mostly because you go out when you go travel for a long time.

38
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:26,316
[SPEAKER_05]: You go out with a certain plan and you don't always necessarily...

39
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Get everything done that you originally intended to do.

40
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:30,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I just got too busy.

41
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:32,739
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, I just got too busy to take the time to set it all up.

42
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you try using, like, the mic that's actually part of it?

43
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:37,221
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually a mic that's built in, but it wasn't good enough.

44
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:37,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

45
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:39,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounded like I was talking out of a Dixie cup.

46
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:46,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it would work for Skype or something, but it would not work for trying to do a professional sounding show as we try to fake once in a while.

47
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:48,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, by the way, hello.

48
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,490
[SPEAKER_05]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

49
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:56,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Rob Roberts, also known as Sky, your coughing host here, who just had some water go down the wrong pipe.

50
00:02:56,932 --> 00:02:57,472
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how that goes.

51
00:02:57,813 --> 00:03:01,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Joining me, as always, say hello to the lovely DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

52
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:05,095
[SPEAKER_00]: I am caffeine-free for the third day in a row.

53
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:06,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.

54
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:07,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot me!

55
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:14,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of getting off the crack or whatever... I'm freaking going through withdrawal like such a crack addict.

56
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:16,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you getting bad headaches?

57
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:21,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I did the caffeine thing, and believe me, I went back, I got really bad headaches.

58
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:27,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Thursday, my friend Julie brought chocolate-covered espresso beans to work and I ate 15.

59
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,393
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went to do gaming that night.

60
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:36,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Tabletop gaming, you know, where you roll dice and not, you know, use your controller.

61
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:37,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

62
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,321
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody else showed up and I ate... You roll a D20.

63
00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:42,444
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate... No, actually we used D6s.

64
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:43,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.

65
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:44,806
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, we used D10s.

66
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:45,267
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Buffy.

67
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:46,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, nerd.

68
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:50,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I ate like 10 more.

69
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:53,582
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, okay.

70
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:54,963
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was bouncing.

71
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:56,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, how's that no caffeine thing going?

72
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:59,247
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Friday I was like, you know what?

73
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:00,128
[SPEAKER_00]: No caffeine.

74
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:01,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been drinking kombucha tea.

75
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:04,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds dirty.

76
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:09,055
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made out of, it's a fermented tea made with mushrooms and sweet tea.

77
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:12,078
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tastes like apple cider vinegar.

78
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,279
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

79
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,757
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been keeping me healthy and keeping the withdrawal symptoms down.

80
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:21,179
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had decaf coffee.

81
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:26,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So for all those people who have emailed concerned about your health, these are the actions you're taking to combat that.

82
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:27,803
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so proud of myself.

83
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:29,383
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a sinus infection last week.

84
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:32,005
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did not... Okay, shut up.

85
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm not laughing at you.

86
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:33,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just...

87
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:38,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm laughing for a real rude reason, but I mean, it's just, it's crazy.

88
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:39,872
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not go to the doctor.

89
00:04:39,892 --> 00:04:41,974
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not let them put me on any drugs.

90
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:43,175
[SPEAKER_00]: I drank hot tea all week.

91
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:46,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, I am feeling fabulous tonight.

92
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:46,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

93
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:55,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I am fully from here on, unless I break something, not going to the doctor ever again for an illness, unless I have cancer or a brain tumor.

94
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hope that doesn't happen.

95
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,339
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have video games to talk about.

96
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:07,505
[SPEAKER_05]: In case you haven't listened to Orange Lounge Radio before, we don't usually bitch so much about a personalized, but we've been gone for two weeks, so we have a lot to catch up on.

97
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:09,126
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to games very shortly.

98
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello, of course, to Loki.

99
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,609
[SPEAKER_05]: No Orange Lounge would be complete without Loki.

100
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:14,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I do feel sick today.

101
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:14,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

102
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:18,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the reason why I feel sick.

103
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:25,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I went to the movies today and I saw Ultraviolet, but then I ate a whole bag of popcorn.

104
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:31,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And then afterwards I went to Applebee's and I had fish and chips with their honey pepper sauce.

105
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:34,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was slamming down Pepsis all day long and playing Xbox Live.

106
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:45,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And to the point where I was playing Xbox Live and either with the adrenaline of playing Full Auto and Pepsi's, you know, the caffeine, I was literally shaking like I had the chills.

107
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:48,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And now my stomach feels like I'm, you know, I'm sick.

108
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:52,235
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's probably just because of all that popcorn and I haven't eaten anything since lunch.

109
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:53,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh...

110
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:55,657
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, though, I've been playing a lot of Xbox Live.

111
00:05:55,757 --> 00:05:58,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to God, sometimes you and Jamie are like yin and yang.

112
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:05,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, she'll have this healthy story to talk about, and you'll be like, I went to Applebee's and dined on chicken strips, or whatever it was you had.

113
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:07,684
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just because I ate a bag of popcorn.

114
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:12,086
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, a bunch of honey pepper sauce and that stuff.

115
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:12,927
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't agree with me.

116
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:18,930
[SPEAKER_05]: See, for every hoop chakra chupacabra tea or whatever, Jamie has... Chupacabra tea!

117
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever it is you have.

118
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:27,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki has, you know... And of course my neck is all stiff and has been hurting for like two days, but...

119
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:30,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, you know, it's all good.

120
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:33,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of games and fun stuff.

121
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:38,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did podcasts earlier in the week, and we restarted our Grand Theft Auto stats.

122
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:41,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So, lots and lots of fun stuff.

123
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:47,780
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Ultraviolet, for those who are wondering if the movie's good or not, it's okay, but it has really bad CG in it.

124
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:51,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And halfway through the movie, you're like, what the hell are they trying to do?

125
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:52,485
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

126
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:53,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

127
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:54,828
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

128
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:56,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we also have a special guest tonight.

129
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:00,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Once in a while, we like to invite other people in the house, and we've been ignoring him for the past 10 minutes.

130
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:02,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Very sorry to Spike.

131
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:03,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to Spike.

132
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:06,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind being ignored, but thank you for having me tonight.

133
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:07,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a problem.

134
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,417
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to have you here.

135
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:12,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be afraid to just put that mic right there, right next to your mouth, because otherwise, they're cheap mics.

136
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,500
[SPEAKER_05]: They're RadioShack mics.

137
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,561
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't pick up otherwise, so...

138
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:16,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheap is the best.

139
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:16,704
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

140
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:18,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So, how are you doing?

141
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:19,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing fantastic.

142
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:21,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Trauma Center all week.

143
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:22,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

144
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:25,610
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's addicted me the way that I thought only World of Warcraft could.

145
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:30,354
[SPEAKER_05]: And, well, usually we kick off the show with How was your gaming week?

146
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:33,016
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Spike, since you're kicking us off, let's do it.

147
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:35,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Trauma Center, is it really as hard as everybody says it is?

148
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:36,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really played it.

149
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:37,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be honest.

150
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really played it.

151
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,621
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've heard it's insanely hard.

152
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:42,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried playing it on the subway and almost killed myself.

153
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:48,167
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I sat down to it, it sucked me in like a crazy, massively multiplayer online game.

154
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Very addictive, very innovative.

155
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly would like to see another version of it.

156
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:59,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to point out, for those asking in the chat room, this is not the same Spike on DDR Freak.

157
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:00,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks are wondering.

158
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:03,718
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my buddy Spike.

159
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you really have any credentials to be on this program?

160
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess not, but that's okay.

161
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:08,993
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a gamer.

162
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:10,275
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all you need, right, Spike?

163
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:12,677
[SPEAKER_05]: He's laughing.

164
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:13,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate you.

165
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:14,558
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's all right.

166
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:15,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody does.

167
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,120
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

168
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we love having you here.

169
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,142
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different, different, Spike.

170
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:21,865
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's exciting news, actually, about Trauma Center.

171
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:24,387
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the games that's being brought over to the revolution.

172
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:25,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Confirmed.

173
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:26,509
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you know this, Mr. Man?

174
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a news story about it.

175
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

176
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:29,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming we'll get into that later.

177
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:30,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly.

178
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else besides Trauma Center in your week, Spike?

179
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Not DDR Freak Spike, but Spike?

180
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,361
[SPEAKER_05]: R. Spike, OLR Spike.

181
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:42,922
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of World of Warcraft.

182
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:43,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

183
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,003
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty pathetic.

184
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:47,304
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of character are you in World of Warcraft?

185
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:50,245
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of character are you in World of Warcraft?

186
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:58,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I just started a Tauren hunter and it's quite exciting because it's my first horde character and

187
00:08:59,437 --> 00:09:01,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite difficult compared to an Alliance character.

188
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:02,599
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

189
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:08,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I would hate the Horde when I first started playing Horde, but I actually kind of enjoy Horde side, I think, a little more than Alliance side.

190
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Alliance side is a little, I don't know, it's too much like every other MMO I've played.

191
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:14,626
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately made an Undead.

192
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:18,489
[SPEAKER_00]: I made my elf, and then I made an Undead.

193
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:20,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had to have the zombie thing going on.

194
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:22,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Thriller?

195
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:22,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Thriller.

196
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:24,107
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.

197
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Romero Zombie.

198
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:26,488
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

199
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, thank you very much, Spike.

200
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:32,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, feel free to give your input on anything throughout the show and all that fun stuff.

201
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:37,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have anything to plug, any upcoming projects, anything you're doing, just feel free.

202
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:38,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it out there.

203
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear you're a very good DJ.

204
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:41,238
[SPEAKER_05]: You do DJ stuff, right?

205
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:41,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.

206
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:46,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like podcasting type of DJ stuff, but like spinning, mixing?

207
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to clubs.

208
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:51,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the iPod thing is a big deal, but I still say vinyl is the way to go.

209
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:52,465
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

210
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:54,523
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just a purist.

211
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:55,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing wrong with that.

212
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go over to DarkSakura.

213
00:09:58,605 --> 00:09:59,565
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

214
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:05,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my series of gaming weeks, I did play a lot of Animal Crossing and some Pupalo Cross.

215
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:09,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, I had to start over because I was on... No, actually I didn't.

216
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:17,094
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to start over on your PSP and then I realized that it was going to be on your memory card and I'm too lazy to move it.

217
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:18,415
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just watched Hellboy.

218
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:21,525
[SPEAKER_00]: and Kill Bill on the plane going to Alabama.

219
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:22,406
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

220
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:24,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody borrowed my PSP while I was gone.

221
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:24,687
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's okay.

222
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,548
[SPEAKER_05]: She had my permission.

223
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:26,209
[SPEAKER_00]: It got love.

224
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:26,809
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

225
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:28,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it wasn't getting any at this house.

226
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,672
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in a case and I cleaned the screen.

227
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:32,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, look, let me put it this way.

228
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:35,316
[SPEAKER_05]: The last time I played that was when Luminous was still a new game.

229
00:10:35,496 --> 00:10:35,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

230
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:36,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just put it that way.

231
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:37,418
[SPEAKER_05]: That PSP.

232
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:37,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

233
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And I checked out OLR PSP on it.

234
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,641
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

235
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:43,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, that PSP is not really doing it for me.

236
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:43,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

237
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:44,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, PSP fans.

238
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:48,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not feeling the love with the offerings that are out yet.

239
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,891
[SPEAKER_05]: But Power Stone is coming to the PSP.

240
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:51,431
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.

241
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:52,572
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so awesome.

242
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:53,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Power Stone.

243
00:10:53,373 --> 00:11:03,183
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of sexy shit coming out for the PSP, so I'm glad Jamie cleaned it so that it's ready to go for me when I get it back and can play the, you know, I want to play that Mega Man stuff and the...

244
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:05,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Katamari Namashi, PSP.

245
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:07,794
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a good year for PSP.

246
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:11,338
[SPEAKER_05]: So PSP fans, you can just stop writing those angry emails right now.

247
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:12,439
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fine.

248
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:15,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll rediscover my love for PSP.

249
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:16,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wait.

250
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:21,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've also, Dan's been playing Phoenix Wright like all the damn time.

251
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:27,232
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've gotten to see like the fourth trial, the whole thing, because he kept making me watch it.

252
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,252
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty cool, but I sort of don't need to play now because I know how it goes.

253
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:41,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Between him and Roz spoiling it for me, I'm eventually going to play it, but I can just watch everybody else play it.

254
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:49,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Dan finally beat Need for Speed Underground, so that was pretty cool.

255
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:51,683
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been just...

256
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:54,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch a lot of Simpsons

257
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:25,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the replacement came about, not that long after I said, I think it took about two business days and I had it back.

258
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:29,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So it came back pretty quick, but of course I wasn't here to enjoy it.

259
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:31,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, Extifer, my roommate, told me it was here.

260
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,445
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I got back from the trip, I played Xbox 360.

261
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:39,447
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a lot of what I've been doing this weekend.

262
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:44,151
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw Your Husband's High Score on Smash TV, because that's one of the games I checked out, Smash TV.

263
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:47,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing like hell a lot of the stuff on the Xbox Live Arcade.

264
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:50,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Crystal Quest, because I remember that game on the Mac from years ago.

265
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool reinterpretation.

266
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody said on our forums that the achievement points were really easy in that game, and I have to agree.

267
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,086
[SPEAKER_05]: You want like 50 easy achievement points?

268
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:01,546
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

269
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:03,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't able to get good achievement points on that.

270
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,190
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do, don't use a smart bomb and get all the way to level 30.

271
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:10,354
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like 30 points right there for getting that far.

272
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:10,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

273
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,621
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's that, and then what else did I play on there?

274
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:16,643
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of Geometry Wars still, although I haven't gotten much better at that.

275
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:20,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bought Full Auto, just because of all the good things I heard about it.

276
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:26,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Not from critics, because a lot of critics have bashed it, but from word of mouth, a lot of people have been saying good things about Full Auto.

277
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:26,669
[SPEAKER_05]: So I picked it up.

278
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say I'm enjoying it.

279
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:33,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't gotten to play a whole lot, but I like it so far.

280
00:13:33,373 --> 00:13:35,935
[SPEAKER_05]: It's racing with guns, which is never a bad thing.

281
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:37,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait till you get to the end of the game.

282
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:46,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably if you listened to last week's podcast, you would have heard me yelling and screaming about the game and saying, God damn it, I fucking hate this end part of the game.

283
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:48,846
[SPEAKER_03]: The rewind feature is awesome.

284
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:49,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.

285
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:52,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if I screw up, I can just rewind time.

286
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:53,510
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

287
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,851
[SPEAKER_05]: More games need that.

288
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:58,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Kart needs that, especially online, because I screw up too much when I play online.

289
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:02,366
[SPEAKER_05]: or when people disconnect, I'll just rewind so that they didn't actually disconnect.

290
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:09,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of DS, I also picked up, this is a game I was so looking forward to, very excited about, Super Princess Peach on the DS.

291
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:11,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

292
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:14,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'm really thrilled with this game.

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,280
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wasn't what I expected.

294
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe that's my own damn fault because I didn't really read up on this game.

295
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:22,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I just assumed, oh, it will be like Mario Brothers, but it will be Princess Peach.

296
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:28,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I heard that Nintendo is trying to get back to their roots, especially with the new Mario DS games coming out.

297
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:34,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I assumed that Princess Peach would be like, you know, it would be like, oh, it's like Mario 2, but on the DS.

298
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:36,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa, was I wrong.

299
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:36,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Because...

300
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:45,308
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of funny because the whole concept behind the game is that Princess Peach is totally emotionally unstable, like most women I know.

301
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:47,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

302
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,330
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be quiet, Mr. Rob.

303
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

304
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:57,234
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, the whole concept of the game is that Princess Peach is emotionally unstable, and you can set things on fire with her anger.

305
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:59,775
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make the grass grow with her tears.

306
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:05,077
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make her life regenerate with her calmness or acid trip.

307
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:06,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what mood that's supposed to be.

308
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:08,163
[SPEAKER_05]: The Power of Prozac

309
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:34,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Peach doesn't feel like the same character that she is in the other Mario games and in Mario Party.

310
00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:39,466
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realize maybe part of this is to obviously make Peach the hero for once.

311
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:46,732
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you've ever played Mario Party against me, you'll know that Peach is always the hero of Mario Party because I always play Peach and I always win.

312
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:51,235
[SPEAKER_00]: I seem to have a memory of beating you before, sir.

313
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:51,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

314
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:53,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Peach is always...

315
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:54,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I played full auto.

316
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:55,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I finished the game 100%.

317
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:58,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just getting the last few achievements online.

318
00:15:59,014 --> 00:15:59,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I've gotten...

319
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:29,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm up on to rank 3 now online, because for some reason it's not counting all the ranked races I'm doing.

320
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:38,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I raced about 6 different races today, and it only counted 2 of them, which ironically enough were the best ones I did, so that worked out in my favor.

321
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:43,665
[SPEAKER_03]: But still though, I spent all that time to play people and they freaking drop like mad.

322
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:44,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

323
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:46,766
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Mario Kart but worse.

324
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:48,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still really fun though.

325
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:50,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get to play in some of the races.

326
00:16:51,408 --> 00:17:02,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I found my strategy though is the same during the multiplayer games as in my single player games where I drop a lot of bombs behind me and just get ahead of the pack and I just take people out as I'm driving.

327
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:04,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And it worked really well.

328
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I got in the first place that way.

329
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,009
[SPEAKER_03]: But the game is really fun.

330
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:15,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Really frustrating in the gang war section of the game, but I finally got gold on those.

331
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And once I was done with that, I was like, finally.

332
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:19,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Really rewarding.

333
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:24,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I've been trying to get into some more of the Xbox Live Arcade games.

334
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:27,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Played a little bit more Hexic HD.

335
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:31,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to actually become good at that game, but I can't.

336
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:35,116
[SPEAKER_03]: And tried Gauntlet and suck at Gauntlet still.

337
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

338
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,338
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

339
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:04,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of gauntlets, since you brought up gauntlet in there, I'm going to go to our chat room now.

340
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:04,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally.

341
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:05,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, chat room.

342
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:06,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not ignoring you guys.

343
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:07,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're there.

344
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:09,644
[SPEAKER_05]: www.orangelantrader.com.

345
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:10,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on chat.

346
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:11,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not.

347
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:11,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't just.

348
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:12,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Lies.

349
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:13,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Spitting lies.

350
00:18:14,487 --> 00:18:15,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Emotionally unstable woman.

351
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:16,128
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

352
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,770
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not unstable.

353
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:21,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Who touched the fire heart?

354
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:22,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Who touched it?

355
00:18:23,939 --> 00:18:25,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just teasing.

356
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:26,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

357
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:28,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

358
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:29,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, question from chatroom.

359
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:32,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitstun says, does Gauntlet have online play?

360
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

361
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and that is pretty much what makes pretty much...

362
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:42,529
[SPEAKER_05]: It is what mucho makes these games worthwhile on Xbox Live.

363
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I would say, frickin' go get Midway Arcade Classics.

364
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:49,112
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got every single game they're offering on Live.

365
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:54,253
[SPEAKER_05]: But the online play is what makes these worth the five bucks a pop.

366
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:59,835
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sometimes hard to find an opponent, but it's fun.

367
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:06,057
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the only way that Gauntlet remains fun after the first few levels for me, honestly, is to have four people playing it.

368
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:06,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

369
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:12,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely, you know, if you're wanting to get back into Gauntlet, check it out on Xbox Live because you can do the co-op thing.

370
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,082
[SPEAKER_05]: So, pretty exciting.

371
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:20,286
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to participate, www.orangelonestradio.com Click on chat.

372
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:24,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, you guys are always free to disagree with us.

373
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:28,270
[SPEAKER_05]: DMN says, I disagree with your opinion on Peach Sky.

374
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:30,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's... And you know what?

375
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:31,352
[SPEAKER_05]: My opinion might change.

376
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:34,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I've changed my opinion on games when I go back and play them for a longer time.

377
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,335
[SPEAKER_05]: As I'm sure some of you guys have done as well.

378
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:42,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes, like a CD, a movie, you watch it, listen to it the first time, and you think, this sucks.

379
00:19:42,438 --> 00:19:43,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And you go back later, and it's actually really good.

380
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing happens with games all the time.

381
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I reserve the right to change my opinion.

382
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing is ever cemented.

383
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:50,463
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I don't know.

384
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:50,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't...

385
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:53,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't see my opinion changing on this, but we'll see.

386
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:53,726
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

387
00:19:56,168 --> 00:20:00,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say something about Katsukan, which is where I went part of my trip, where I was at.

388
00:20:01,354 --> 00:20:03,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a panel there on Bomani Games.

389
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:06,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I was placed Sunday at 11 a.m.

390
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:11,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I could count on my hands how many people showed up to my panel, and that made me kind of sad.

391
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:13,490
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

392
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:37,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well, maybe next time.

393
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:49,623
[SPEAKER_05]: We are thinking about going to other cons and stuff, so if you have suggestions, we can't go to everything, but if you, you know, especially California-based stuff, we can certainly try and make an attempt at going to, and I know we've got ideas of our own, so we'll see what happens.

394
00:20:50,403 --> 00:20:52,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Big thanks to those of you guys who did stop by and say hi at KatsuCon.

395
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:59,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, a big, huge thank you to the listener who hooked me up with a Wonderswan color.

396
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,242
[SPEAKER_05]: That was so awesome.

397
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:01,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I tell you about that?

398
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:02,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a Wonderswan color.

399
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:03,145
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really cool.

400
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:05,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And Final Fantasy IV.

401
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:05,887
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so badass.

402
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:06,988
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Wonderswan color.

403
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:08,169
[SPEAKER_05]: And you already know I love Final Fantasy IV.

404
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:09,009
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to tell you again.

405
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:11,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

406
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:11,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

407
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into this week's news.

408
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:16,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting off with Loki.

409
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:16,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki...

410
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:21,127
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got the hookup or something this week, don't you?

411
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:22,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's up?

412
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:23,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Destination PlayStation.

413
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:25,270
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a retail-only event.

414
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,171
[SPEAKER_03]: That means no press.

415
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:28,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But, being that I work in retail...

416
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:30,155
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get the hookup.

417
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:35,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually got the PowerPoint presentations of a few different companies that were going to be there showing off their games.

418
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got a bunch of different titles.

419
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:43,963
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned last week, we did have some stuff regarding the Activision.

420
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:49,666
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I have the Vividi Universal titles that are going to be coming out.

421
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:50,878
[SPEAKER_03]: This year!

422
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:54,160
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of this stuff hasn't been announced yet, so it's going to be kind of cool.

423
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Including some of the Revolution games that are going to be coming out at launch.

424
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:01,964
[SPEAKER_03]: But let me just run down the list here of some of the really cool stuff.

425
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:15,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you guys know, he's actually, and I know this is radio, so he's actually looking at a PowerPoint that I'm sure is not supposed to be looked at by us right now, but it shows, it's a freaking calendar that just shows, it looks very official, boys and girls, I...

426
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:17,193
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

427
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:18,154
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so cool.

428
00:22:18,394 --> 00:22:22,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, this is the exact PowerPoint that they're showing at Destination PlayStation, which is awesome.

429
00:22:23,117 --> 00:22:34,163
[SPEAKER_03]: But starting off here, well, upcoming this second quarter, we've got Over the Hedge and X-Men 3, which is no surprise, two games based on upcoming movies.

430
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:39,106
[SPEAKER_03]: In July through September, third quarter,

431
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:43,629
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the movies X-Pack, which is coming out for the PC and expansion to the movies.

432
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:44,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Now wait, I noticed something here.

433
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, take X3, for example.

434
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:54,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I see it's bolded, and then I see the legend at the bottom says, Bold, Xbox 360, PS3, and or Nintendo, I guess NR means Nintendo Revolution.

435
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:59,412
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it's bolded in April, May, June, is that like hinting, or is that just going to be Xbox 360?

436
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:02,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It means that there's probably an Xbox 360 version for X-Men 3.

437
00:23:02,553 --> 00:23:04,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I see, because I get, look at that goat.

438
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:05,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean we're going to have like a PS3?

439
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:06,714
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

440
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:07,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think so.

441
00:23:08,374 --> 00:23:16,118
[SPEAKER_03]: July, or quarter three, we've got, like I said, the movies X-Pac for the PC, Quake Enemy Territory for the PC, as well as a couple budget titles.

442
00:23:16,138 --> 00:23:20,121
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Kabbalah's Alaskan Adventures for both consoles and PC.

443
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:24,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see here, also for quarter four, of course, is going to be the biggest stuff.

444
00:23:24,843 --> 00:23:26,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see lots of bolded stuff here.

445
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:27,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of bold stuff.

446
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:30,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So this must mean the other consoles, they're expecting them to be out this time.

447
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:31,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's where we're going here.

448
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,228
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got actual launch stuff.

449
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:35,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam

450
00:23:53,275 --> 00:23:58,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Call of Duty 3 is going to be another title that's coming out on the PlayStation 3 and for the 360, which is going to be pretty cool.

451
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:00,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty, also, they're going to be getting a version for the PSP.

452
00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:24,307
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as Gun is coming to the PSP.

453
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:27,370
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the bargain titles here.

454
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,313
[SPEAKER_03]: The History Channel presents the Civil War, a first person shooter I might add.

455
00:24:45,061 --> 00:24:49,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know exactly how that would work, because I know it takes a long-ass time to reload.

456
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:51,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Civil War first-person shooter?

457
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:52,749
[SPEAKER_03]: This shit's fake.

458
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:53,810
[SPEAKER_03]: This has got to be fake.

459
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,550
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that is not fake.

460
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:55,572
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better than World War II.

461
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:56,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you a switch.

462
00:24:56,753 --> 00:24:58,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to come out last year.

463
00:24:58,475 --> 00:24:59,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the sell sheets for this.

464
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:04,561
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen, but it's a budget title.

465
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:06,455
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.

466
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:07,115
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really bad.

467
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:10,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Harley Davidson, they're also doing another bike game.

468
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

469
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,942
[SPEAKER_03]: They had American Choppers, the game.

470
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:17,065
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, this one really got me laughing.

471
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:18,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Pimp My Ride, the game.

472
00:25:18,806 --> 00:25:19,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Kill me.

473
00:25:20,328 --> 00:25:21,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, you know, I thought L.A.

474
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:24,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Rush was Pimp My Ride, the game, but whatever.

475
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,793
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out on consoles.

476
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And Kabbalah's African Safari.

477
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:30,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, sadly enough, people buy those Kabbalah's games a lot.

478
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:36,794
[SPEAKER_03]: and some other games I should mention for the DS Spider-Man Kids.

479
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell that is.

480
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:42,678
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of really bad games.

481
00:25:43,178 --> 00:25:46,920
[SPEAKER_03]: That's everything for Civil War First Pursuiter.

482
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,981
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of have my interest now.

483
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:53,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like one of those you-gotta-see-it-to-believe-it type things.

484
00:25:54,184 --> 00:25:57,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't be the only one who's interested in a very showgirls kind of way.

485
00:25:59,747 --> 00:26:04,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Now for Vividi Universal, we've got 50 Cent.

486
00:26:04,751 --> 00:26:07,093
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 Cent's coming out on the PSP in fourth quarter.

487
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:10,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a year later, the game's still going to suck.

488
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:16,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Crash Festival, a Crash Bandicoot game for the DS, will be coming out also in fourth quarter.

489
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:18,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder whatever happened to Crash Bandicoot.

490
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:19,743
[SPEAKER_05]: They still make games for that stuff.

491
00:26:19,763 --> 00:26:20,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

492
00:26:21,588 --> 00:26:26,550
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the last one I ever played of Crash Bandicoot was the little party game they had on the PlayStation.

493
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Crash Bash?

494
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Crash Bash.

495
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:30,231
[SPEAKER_05]: What a crap.

496
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:31,952
[SPEAKER_05]: What a crap that game was.

497
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:32,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

498
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:34,913
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like the worst knockoff game I'd ever seen in my life.

499
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:42,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a game coming out called Eragon, which is going to be based on a movie that's coming out around the same time, quarter four.

500
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:45,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on the 360 and all the console systems.

501
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:47,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's pretty sweet.

502
00:26:47,717 --> 00:26:49,938
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got John Malkovich in it.

503
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:50,998
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like he plays like a

504
00:26:51,963 --> 00:26:52,683
[SPEAKER_03]: A Troll or something.

505
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:53,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

506
00:26:53,664 --> 00:26:54,665
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat.

507
00:26:55,125 --> 00:27:02,209
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's definitely going to be a lot better than In the Name of the King and Uebo Crap Fest.

508
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:03,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

509
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, a bunch of other movie tie-ins here.

510
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:08,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Miami Vice, of course, with the movie that's coming out.

511
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:10,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Also a console game.

512
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:10,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

513
00:27:11,014 --> 00:27:12,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Scarface coming out in September.

514
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:20,739
[SPEAKER_03]: That one actually looks pretty sweet because it's kind of, you know, it's like Vice City but actually, you know, without ripping off Scarface.

515
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:21,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Spyro Deluxe

516
00:27:45,928 --> 00:27:47,548
[SPEAKER_03]: or Legend of Spyro A New Beginning.

517
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's coming out in all the systems in October, actually.

518
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:59,111
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I always thought Crash and Spyro ran away together to the land of oversaturation and made like a million babies or something.

519
00:28:00,552 --> 00:28:01,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

520
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:06,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's another crappy game here called Mach, which is for the PSP.

521
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:08,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like crap.

522
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:09,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you like airplane fighting.

523
00:28:09,794 --> 00:28:11,274
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like airplane combat games.

524
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, boom, shoot them up, top gun.

525
00:28:13,115 --> 00:28:13,515
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh...

526
00:28:14,304 --> 00:28:17,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I forgot, I had EA's lineup too.

527
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:17,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Just real quick, though.

528
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:19,946
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only a couple that are worth mentioning.

529
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,307
[SPEAKER_03]: They're anytime soon.

530
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Superman Returns, coming out in June.

531
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:25,268
[SPEAKER_03]: June 26th, currently.

532
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Will it be based on the Superman 64 engine?

533
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:29,110
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it will not be.

534
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you know what?

535
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I have seen the video for this.

536
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,592
[SPEAKER_03]: They released a trailer for it, and it actually looks really good.

537
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:38,253
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to have 80 square miles of metropolis you get to fly around in.

538
00:28:38,753 --> 00:29:07,718
[SPEAKER_03]: and with all the buildings and everything and um really cool and they've got Metallo in there giant you know robot you get to fight and stuff and I don't know and then Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth 2 um for Xbox 360 tentatively right now for June 13th speaking of the land of oversaturation now now sorry I've been gone for a couple weeks I'm a little feisty tonight that's all we got so far I'm still waiting to get back from uh

539
00:29:08,336 --> 00:29:13,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of people right now, Destination PlayStation was taking place this week and a lot of people are still busy.

540
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:16,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get some more info later on.

541
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:21,362
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, DarkTetsuya has an interesting point about the Civil War first person shooter.

542
00:29:21,922 --> 00:29:26,344
[SPEAKER_05]: If that is historically accurate, then you will be spending more time reloading than firing.

543
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:26,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

544
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:33,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember seeing this in history class to put the powder back in the gun forever and all that stuff?

545
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:37,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Make for some mean online play.

546
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:39,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about that.

547
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,861
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a 15 minute match, you can only fire 15 shots.

548
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:45,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Better make those count.

549
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:53,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, I noticed when I was gone, people got really freaked out about this Microsoft origami.

550
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:54,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, oh!

551
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:55,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

552
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:58,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft's entering the handheld market.

553
00:29:58,377 --> 00:29:59,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

554
00:29:59,118 --> 00:30:03,021
[SPEAKER_05]: The origami is their answer to the PSP and the DS, right?

555
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:04,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my thing, okay?

556
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:05,703
[SPEAKER_05]: About the origami.

557
00:30:05,743 --> 00:30:07,604
[SPEAKER_05]: The origami is a stupid name.

558
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:08,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

559
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:09,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it makes me want to fold it.

560
00:30:09,786 --> 00:30:10,526
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't do that.

561
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:12,428
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't fold a Microsoft equipment.

562
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:13,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing about the origami, though.

563
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:15,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of, like,

564
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:17,008
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

565
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:33,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't stick it in a pocket unless I'm like 5 billion pounds and have pants the size of, you know.

566
00:30:48,553 --> 00:30:49,795
[SPEAKER_03]: A parachute or something.

567
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:51,457
[SPEAKER_03]: The Microsoft doorstop.

568
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:52,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with Halo.

569
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:55,583
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, it doesn't play Halo.

570
00:30:55,643 --> 00:30:56,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is, kids.

571
00:30:56,785 --> 00:30:57,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

572
00:30:58,007 --> 00:31:03,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the word's coming out that it is not actually their answer to the PSP or DS.

573
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:04,496
[SPEAKER_05]: So sit down.

574
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:10,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what this is, is actually it is their first in a line of paperback-sized computers.

575
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:13,314
[SPEAKER_05]: So what the hell was the Halo thing?

576
00:31:13,674 --> 00:31:16,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It was running Halo on Windows XP, is what they say.

577
00:31:16,255 --> 00:31:17,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's like a portable computer.

578
00:31:18,636 --> 00:31:19,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Paperback size?

579
00:31:19,997 --> 00:31:23,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I know what the size of a paperback book is.

580
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,159
[SPEAKER_03]: If this thing is like the paperback size of a phone book.

581
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the paperback in question is War and Peace.

582
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:29,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently.

583
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:32,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

584
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:37,926
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bible.

585
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:41,469
[SPEAKER_05]: With the Book of Mormon as the AC adapter or something.

586
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:45,312
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's the size of the unabridged dictionary.

587
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:57,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, all kidding aside, Microsoft's going to have this tiny, and I use that term very loosely, tiny computer coming out soon called the Origami.

588
00:31:57,423 --> 00:31:57,803
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know...

589
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:15,691
[SPEAKER_05]: People are saying it's not a handheld, but correct me if I'm wrong, if the damn thing hooks up to all of Microsoft's other stuff, couldn't you theoretically get some perks as an origami owner, such as maybe Xbox 360 demos, movies on your origami?

590
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:18,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't that still be something that's an option?

591
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:20,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, of course, you earn the ridicule of all your friends.

592
00:32:21,132 --> 00:32:21,912
[SPEAKER_03]: This made me laugh.

593
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:28,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Game Informer is trying to guess what you could use the origami for, and one of the things they said is a secondary screen for your 360.

594
00:32:29,138 --> 00:32:37,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, I'm going to go out there and spend $500 on a crappy little screen that could possibly be used in a game as a status screen or something like a DS.

595
00:32:38,464 --> 00:32:38,785
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

596
00:32:39,205 --> 00:32:41,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what the origami can be used for.

597
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:42,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, shit, I got a crooked nail.

598
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,210
[SPEAKER_05]: You killed the penguin.

599
00:32:50,524 --> 00:32:53,527
[SPEAKER_05]: People out in the living room are probably going, what the hell are they doing on that show tonight?

600
00:32:53,547 --> 00:32:55,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?

601
00:32:55,629 --> 00:33:01,835
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone could be bludgeoned to death with an iPod, man, that origami is giving me some deadly stuff there.

602
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:10,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, since you pissed off enough Mac users, we'll get the hate mail from Microsoft fans this week.

603
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:11,365
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, turnabout's fair play.

604
00:33:12,762 --> 00:33:13,903
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, World of Warcraft

605
00:33:41,337 --> 00:33:45,140
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to, what's the other three languages they have out in Europe right now?

606
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:45,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

607
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:49,023
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we get the Spanish version!

608
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:51,785
[SPEAKER_00]: El Computer Es En Fuego.

609
00:33:54,562 --> 00:33:56,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Lucha Libre on Telemundo

610
00:34:11,574 --> 00:34:13,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, you also have a WoW story.

611
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:43,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is how you can become part of the beta for the World of Warcraft Burning Crusade.

612
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:45,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, that's not an STD.

613
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:48,215
[SPEAKER_03]: They have three different things that are going to be going on.

614
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,816
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is a race to level 50 contest.

615
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:53,757
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's basically just like it sounds.

616
00:34:53,817 --> 00:34:57,198
[SPEAKER_03]: You take a new character and see how quickly you can get to level 50.

617
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:05,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully the top 1,000 will secure the right to be able to be part of the beta.

618
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:09,518
[SPEAKER_03]: The second competition is called the Battle for Warsong Gulch.

619
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,360
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a level 19 capped battle.

620
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:23,723
[SPEAKER_03]: The top 500 players for that are going to be able to be part of the beta for that.

621
00:35:24,524 --> 00:35:28,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, the most level 25 characters contest.

622
00:35:28,746 --> 00:35:34,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like it sounds, the top 1,000 people who can get the most characters that are level 25 and above

623
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:36,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Get to also be part of the beta

624
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:06,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I just found a reason to take my vacation time.

625
00:36:06,452 --> 00:36:06,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy.

626
00:36:07,013 --> 00:36:07,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Nerd.

627
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:08,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

628
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have a WoW story.

629
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,887
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how the rumors are going around that World of Warcraft is going to come out on the Xbox 360?

630
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:15,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Not.

631
00:36:15,027 --> 00:36:15,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Not.

632
00:36:19,235 --> 00:36:37,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though Squeenix is bringing over Final Fantasy XI to the 360, MCV, the Interactive Entertainment Weekly, is saying that the Blizzard Chief Operating Officer, Paul Sam, said, "...we do not have any plans to take WoW to Xbox 360.

633
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:40,888
[SPEAKER_05]: WoW is built as a PC gaming experience.

634
00:36:41,488 --> 00:36:48,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Porting PC games to console often compromises games, and we would never allow the WoW gameplay experience to suffer."

635
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,435
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it doesn't sound like it's going to happen.

636
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:57,720
[SPEAKER_03]: To counter that, according to the VOIP blog, World of Warcraft is indeed going to debut on the 360.

637
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:08,328
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, of course, coming about a day after they announced that it wasn't, and apparently the whole thing is they're going to announce some sort of secret partnership at E3.

638
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:12,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, that sounds like a bunch of fan-based speculation to me.

639
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:17,556
[SPEAKER_05]: With all due respect to that blog in question, blog...

640
00:37:18,345 --> 00:37:20,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Operating Officer of Blizzard.

641
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:22,328
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say which one's more believable.

642
00:37:22,568 --> 00:37:26,552
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, it's not like these guys haven't lied before.

643
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:33,097
[SPEAKER_05]: To the blog's credit, they could totally make a 180 on this statement and we would just look like asses again.

644
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

645
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:37,642
[SPEAKER_05]: New story.

646
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:38,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

647
00:37:39,544 --> 00:37:41,625
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about Gauntlet on Xbox Live Arcade.

648
00:37:41,905 --> 00:37:43,006
[SPEAKER_05]: The fun ain't done yet, right?

649
00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:44,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course not.

650
00:37:44,307 --> 00:37:47,969
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be some more Midway games coming to the Xbox Live Arcade.

651
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:48,710
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my favorites.

652
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:49,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Paperboy.

653
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Paperboy is coming.

654
00:37:51,552 --> 00:37:52,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

655
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:53,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And Roopier Tapper.

656
00:37:53,913 --> 00:37:54,794
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be really good.

657
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I own it, that game.

658
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:56,415
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on.

659
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,502
[SPEAKER_05]: But Rupert Tapper's not really two-player.

660
00:37:58,522 --> 00:37:59,443
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not two-player co-op.

661
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:03,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think they're going to have to get creative with that one to make that a worthwhile purchase.

662
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:04,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with Paperboy.

663
00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:12,916
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't really, you know, the enticing thing about the Midway games is that they're co-op and stuff, but those games aren't really multiplayer at once.

664
00:38:13,097 --> 00:38:14,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Defender is also coming.

665
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other stuff that will be heading our way is going to be Cyberball.

666
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:23,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Some sort of robot football game.

667
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, of course, the best one.

668
00:38:27,398 --> 00:38:31,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Mortal Kombat 3, or Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, is going to be coming.

669
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:35,200
[SPEAKER_03]: To combat, of course, Street Fighter 2.

670
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:36,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Why Mortal Kombat 3?

671
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:39,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I would say is the worst one in the entire series.

672
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:42,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I even prefer Mortal Kombat 4 over Mortal Kombat 3.

673
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:44,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Mortal Kombat 2 is the top of the series.

674
00:38:44,483 --> 00:38:45,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, Mortal Kombat 2 is the top.

675
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:47,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's any dispute in that.

676
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:51,285
[SPEAKER_05]: But I even prefer, and I know people totally disagree, I prefer Mortal Kombat 4 to 3.

677
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:52,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not like 3 at all.

678
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:52,986
[SPEAKER_05]: It just...

679
00:38:54,463 --> 00:38:59,065
[SPEAKER_00]: The beta versions of Mortal Kombat 2 Mortal Kombat 2 is awesome Why 3?

680
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:00,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are they coming out with 3?

681
00:39:00,566 --> 00:39:00,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not 2?

682
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:14,451
[SPEAKER_05]: People want 2 I don't know Be glad you're getting any Mortal Kombat I'm not spending $5 on Mortal Kombat 3 Especially when I already have Arcade Legends 2 Who says it's going to be $5?

683
00:39:14,491 --> 00:39:21,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch when Street Fighter 2 comes out I bet you it'll probably be like $10 F that Pretty soon you'll be paying for $40 games online

684
00:39:26,716 --> 00:39:27,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

685
00:39:28,258 --> 00:39:35,064
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura has a story about parents and video games and all that fun stuff.

686
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:36,345
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?

687
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:39,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents and video games.

688
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:46,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, video games' worst enemy is lazy parents.

689
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:48,757
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times have I said this?

690
00:39:49,718 --> 00:39:50,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I'm kind of like...

691
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Even when I was looking over this week's story, I was kind of like, this is news.

692
00:39:54,132 --> 00:40:03,076
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's nice to see that the media is kind of acknowledging that it's not always doom and gloom, the gamer's fault.

693
00:40:04,377 --> 00:40:07,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody is equally to blame sometimes.

694
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:07,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

695
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's this...

696
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:28,147
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation going into actually and this is actually something else I was reading on a number of sites there's actually new legislation to have the game ratings redone which is actually pretty stupid a lot of people are protesting it

697
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:35,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it's okay if they want to do it like we've suggested on this program before, and I think it's the way they do it in the UK, if I'm not mistaken.

698
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:36,366
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm talking about in the UK.

699
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:37,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh.

700
00:40:37,587 --> 00:40:38,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, in the UK it's fine.

701
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:40,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't it mirror the movies in the UK?

702
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:46,314
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, but there's one of the Labour Party folks is lobbying to change it.

703
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:50,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you change it when I think that's the way that makes the most sense, is to mirror the movies?

704
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:51,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people understand movie ratings.

705
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:56,783
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't understand, for whatever reason, they don't understand game ratings, but they understand PG-13 ratings.

706
00:40:57,643 --> 00:41:00,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, R, might have titties, don't take the kids.

707
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:05,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now they're having this mom's army business over there.

708
00:41:05,691 --> 00:41:06,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom as in mother.

709
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:10,916
[SPEAKER_05]: With what little I know of British culture, I do know that one.

710
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:12,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just teasing.

711
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:13,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not everyone does.

712
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:22,266
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're saying that the games are responsible for all kinds of social problems like drug and alcohol abuse, gang membership, and...

713
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Gangsta Rap.

714
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm going to play some Katamari Damashio.

715
00:41:33,544 --> 00:41:49,052
[SPEAKER_00]: But seriously, there was, there's actually an interesting comment on here that's a political movement launched by the same people who show a story of a woman crippled by 40 to 60 orgasms a day.

716
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:51,953
[SPEAKER_00]: How can that be credible?

717
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:54,986
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of awesome.

718
00:41:55,306 --> 00:42:00,990
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like reading The Sun or something, you know, or like The Inquirer.

719
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:02,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well.

720
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:13,800
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're saying that video games which, to quote, glorify pimping, drug dealing, and street murders, but they don't make a logical connection to trying to control what their children are playing.

721
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:19,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they're blaming the games, not blaming themselves for taking responsibility for what their children are doing.

722
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:20,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me!

723
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:32,887
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing this show for four years, and didn't I say that from like, well, not quite day one, but sort of around, you know, the first year I started my whole campaign against parents doing their freaking job?

724
00:42:33,287 --> 00:42:38,451
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what makes this news, is that finally, you know, there's, you know, anyway.

725
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:39,552
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.

726
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:40,653
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is ridiculous.

727
00:42:40,913 --> 00:42:45,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I feel like writing them and going, why don't you just try parenting your children?

728
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:47,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

729
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:51,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, on the flip side, we have a good piece about parenting and stuff later.

730
00:42:52,084 --> 00:42:55,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So please, if you're going to send hate mail right now, wait, because we have another story coming up later.

731
00:42:55,945 --> 00:43:04,009
[SPEAKER_00]: I've fully gone on and said, for those of you parents who are taking an active part in your children, it's a partnership.

732
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:11,373
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a responsibility to put the information out there and market it correctly, but the parents have the responsibility to take that information and use it wisely.

733
00:43:11,653 --> 00:43:11,993
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

734
00:43:14,577 --> 00:43:16,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that may not be so wise.

735
00:43:16,918 --> 00:43:17,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I caught this.

736
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:20,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little piece on Kotaku this week.

737
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Little, little piece.

738
00:43:22,481 --> 00:43:24,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's about all the N-Gage deserves.

739
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:26,403
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I thought the N-Gage was dead and gone, but no.

740
00:43:27,903 --> 00:43:31,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Civilization just recently came out on the N-Gage this week.

741
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:34,887
[SPEAKER_05]: And I seem to remember playing this at E3 last year.

742
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:36,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I got so frustrated.

743
00:43:36,728 --> 00:43:39,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Civilization is probably my favorite computer game of all time.

744
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And granted, I think this one's based off of Civ 2, the Civ 2 engine.

745
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:45,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I got frustrated after like two minutes.

746
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:47,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't, I could not stand.

747
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:49,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what happened to my game?

748
00:43:49,898 --> 00:43:50,939
[SPEAKER_05]: What, why?

749
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:52,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, God, why?

750
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like crying in the middle of the engage booth.

751
00:43:54,521 --> 00:43:55,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to be removed.

752
00:43:56,223 --> 00:44:06,192
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, if you're a Civ fan and you happen to own an N-Gage, or you need a reason to, you know, keep your N-Gage, or need something on your... I guess, here it is, Civilization, finally out.

753
00:44:06,752 --> 00:44:12,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy, and then, you know, kick your N-Gage, because it's, you know, not that great.

754
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:14,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, Loki!

755
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

756
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:21,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting story, actually, coming out about the Sims.

757
00:44:23,504 --> 00:44:29,688
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically EA and Depeche Mode have collaborated on a signature song for Sims 2, open for business.

758
00:44:30,528 --> 00:44:46,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually funny because this song playing, or I guess the first ever Simlish language song, Suffer Well, a popular track by Depeche Mode, will be in the game.

759
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:49,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how...

760
00:44:50,307 --> 00:44:52,928
[SPEAKER_03]: How you can listen to Depeche Mode in that weird language.

761
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:53,688
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just weird.

762
00:44:55,389 --> 00:44:55,869
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unusual.

763
00:44:56,089 --> 00:44:56,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

764
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,390
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a weird pairing to me.

765
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Depeche Mode in The Sims.

766
00:45:00,151 --> 00:45:00,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

767
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,212
[SPEAKER_05]: It worked for the Black Eyed Peas.

768
00:45:03,633 --> 00:45:06,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Depeche Mode, Black Eyed Peas, not quite the same type of band.

769
00:45:07,874 --> 00:45:10,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have worked better if they had picked a good Depeche Mode song.

770
00:45:10,896 --> 00:45:11,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

771
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:14,600
[SPEAKER_02]: But there haven't been any good Depeche Mode songs in the past 10 years.

772
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

773
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:21,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my question is... The last album was really freaking good, okay?

774
00:45:22,283 --> 00:45:23,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Now my question is... Violator?

775
00:45:23,543 --> 00:45:24,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Violator.

776
00:45:25,544 --> 00:45:27,465
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit Rob with something.

777
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:39,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my question is, is this song for like, since this is basically the storefront Sims expansion, is this for the Hot Topic?

778
00:45:39,963 --> 00:45:43,764
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the type of story that's going to be in the game, you know, where you get to... I don't know.

779
00:45:44,604 --> 00:45:45,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I got nothing.

780
00:45:45,324 --> 00:45:45,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

781
00:45:45,804 --> 00:45:53,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I find it interesting because I remember the Black Eyed Peas did a Simlish song for the Herbs games, and I don't recall that having any great success.

782
00:45:54,387 --> 00:45:56,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious why they would try this sort of thing again.

783
00:45:57,907 --> 00:46:02,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Depeche Mode was like, Our last album sucks so bad!

784
00:46:02,368 --> 00:46:03,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, someone listen to it!

785
00:46:03,749 --> 00:46:05,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave, he's going to shove a mic up your butt.

786
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's... All right.

787
00:46:09,028 --> 00:46:13,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's let Jamie have a witty retort here at this time with her website of the week.

788
00:46:14,092 --> 00:46:15,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, we love Jamie's website of the week.

789
00:46:15,954 --> 00:46:17,195
[SPEAKER_00]: My website of the week.

790
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:17,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait.

791
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:18,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Theme music.

792
00:46:18,896 --> 00:46:19,316
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

793
00:46:19,557 --> 00:46:21,598
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to make a comment before you started that.

794
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:22,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

795
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:23,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

796
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,621
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just especially significant.

797
00:46:30,806 --> 00:46:36,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's website of the week is the website for Warp 11 because they rock.

798
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:37,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Warp11.com

799
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:07,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

800
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:14,152
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually, I think, a song that's just about various drugs in Star Trek.

801
00:47:15,853 --> 00:47:19,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, they did the best, my favorite of their songs, they did Montalban.

802
00:47:19,514 --> 00:47:28,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever seen that old Saturday Night Live sketch with William Shatner going to the Star Trek convention and he goes, Hey, you, in the back, have you ever gotten laid?

803
00:47:28,177 --> 00:47:29,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that?

804
00:47:30,277 --> 00:47:30,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Hilarious.

805
00:47:30,857 --> 00:47:31,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

806
00:47:31,498 --> 00:47:33,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude on the website.

807
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:35,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Trick fans get laid with each other.

808
00:47:36,423 --> 00:47:43,146
[SPEAKER_00]: This band is also really... I'm a closet Trekkie.

809
00:47:43,186 --> 00:47:43,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

810
00:47:44,766 --> 00:47:46,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I will make you feel better, okay?

811
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:47,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've been pretty harsh tonight.

812
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:51,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give you the greatest blackmail ammo of all time.

813
00:47:51,289 --> 00:47:51,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you ready?

814
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:56,471
[SPEAKER_05]: In high school, senior year, I was vice president of the Star Trek Club.

815
00:47:56,871 --> 00:47:57,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Trekkie!

816
00:47:57,352 --> 00:47:57,832
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

817
00:47:58,992 --> 00:47:59,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you feel better?

818
00:47:59,773 --> 00:48:00,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel somewhat better.

819
00:48:01,397 --> 00:48:23,163
[SPEAKER_00]: but um but no just like freaking go look at the on the link for music it has the lyrics to Montalban up there it's like the best lyrics ever and there's also um mp3 samples on the site which you know we should we'll play eventually I actually on my show I play a lot of warp 11 anyway because I love warp 11

820
00:48:24,242 --> 00:48:29,605
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that off of their most recent album which is called Boldly Go Down On Me.

821
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:33,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Our Cube is probably my favorite song on there.

822
00:48:33,907 --> 00:48:35,568
[SPEAKER_00]: That one and Captain Caught Me on the Holodeck.

823
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:41,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Alert is also a really good album just because of Seven of Mine.

824
00:48:42,931 --> 00:48:46,393
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a really, really cool band.

825
00:48:47,053 --> 00:48:49,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this and to kind of bring it back to gaming a little bit.

826
00:48:49,434 --> 00:48:50,375
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also in Trekkies too.

827
00:48:51,204 --> 00:49:10,932
[SPEAKER_05]: to bring it back to gaming a little bit I do think that Star Trek MMO is a pretty good idea I think that'll be great so we'll see when more details come out I think it'll be pretty cool one other thing I'd like to point out about the site everyone should go to the photos and look at the Halloween photos with them dressed as Star Wars characters

828
00:49:13,681 --> 00:49:16,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DarkSakura's website of the week, enjoy.

829
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:21,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, this article's kind of been floating around the internet for a couple weeks.

830
00:49:21,866 --> 00:49:25,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind, we haven't done a show in a couple weeks, so we have to catch up on a couple things that we missed.

831
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:28,171
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was run on MSNBC Newsweek.

832
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:33,814
[SPEAKER_05]: This is interesting, there's a game coming out, it's called Left Behind Eternal Forces.

833
00:49:34,315 --> 00:49:36,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Left Behind is this...

834
00:49:36,846 --> 00:49:43,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Book series of, I guess they're Christian-oriented books about what the rapture and the people to get left behind, right?

835
00:49:44,129 --> 00:49:53,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically what happens is that it's supposed to be taking place in Manhattan, but the level of violence is supposed to be reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto, according to this story.

836
00:49:53,752 --> 00:49:56,713
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about New Yorkers who are left behind after the rapture.

837
00:49:57,593 --> 00:50:01,414
[SPEAKER_05]: They scour the streets for converts, train...

838
00:50:03,115 --> 00:50:16,162
[SPEAKER_05]: People to be a workforce to feed, shelter, and join the resistance against the growing forces of the Antichrist is what this game is all about, which meets with a resounding okay?

839
00:50:16,502 --> 00:50:17,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that sounds like a good title.

840
00:50:18,937 --> 00:50:20,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's just kind of like, oh really?

841
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:23,701
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like GTA meets Shin Megami Tensai.

842
00:50:23,781 --> 00:50:24,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost interested.

843
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:29,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the part about getting the hooker in the car and then killing her?

844
00:50:29,605 --> 00:50:30,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, where's that?

845
00:50:30,785 --> 00:50:38,151
[SPEAKER_03]: If this game does not have a sex minigame that was removed from the game but still left in the programming, I will not buy it.

846
00:50:39,512 --> 00:50:41,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of hot coffee, it's hot mana.

847
00:50:43,134 --> 00:50:45,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully this game will be less boring than the movie.

848
00:50:46,471 --> 00:50:48,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I have watched the movie.

849
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:50,914
[SPEAKER_03]: And God, I want those two hours back.

850
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:57,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of stories that are a little bit old, but we want to bring them to your attention anyway.

851
00:50:57,658 --> 00:50:57,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

852
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, there is a little bit of news going around.

853
00:51:04,222 --> 00:51:05,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't even really call this news.

854
00:51:05,823 --> 00:51:07,924
[SPEAKER_03]: The EA Sports Games for the PSP.

855
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:10,686
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to play online, you have to do one of two things.

856
00:51:10,726 --> 00:51:14,949
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to either sign over your privacy to...

857
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:21,384
[SPEAKER_03]: EA, and I believe ESPN to have them send you spam or pay them $2.

858
00:51:23,766 --> 00:51:24,927
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah.

859
00:51:26,028 --> 00:51:31,452
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been going on and basically brought to attention again with the release of Fight Night Round 3.

860
00:51:32,213 --> 00:51:45,844
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is something that's going on since... So, what's to stop me from going to get a free Gmail account because I know thousands of people with thousands of invites to Gmail even though it's still in beta.

861
00:51:46,212 --> 00:51:53,014
[SPEAKER_05]: What's to stop me from getting a free Gmail account and having it be my spam dump ground and signing up with this address?

862
00:51:54,874 --> 00:51:56,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, it's all about the principle here.

863
00:51:57,735 --> 00:51:59,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, it'd be really easy to do that.

864
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure, probably lots of people have done that.

865
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:06,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure, even the people that have put the legitimate information haven't gotten anything sent to them.

866
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:10,100
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's about the principle.

867
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,440
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the principle of the thing.

868
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,901
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, $2 or my email address.

869
00:52:13,961 --> 00:52:16,062
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, sell your soul to the marketing.

870
00:52:16,442 --> 00:52:18,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Sell your soul to the band is essentially what they're saying.

871
00:52:18,883 --> 00:52:19,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Or buy it back for $2.

872
00:52:19,684 --> 00:52:23,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the whole thing it comes down to is this isn't something that's like on the box.

873
00:52:23,985 --> 00:52:31,828
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's kind of to hide that in there saying, oh yeah, by the way, if you want to play online, you got to pay us $2.

874
00:52:32,409 --> 00:52:35,010
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's kind of not good.

875
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:35,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Shady.

876
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:36,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Shady.

877
00:52:37,811 --> 00:52:38,171
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

878
00:52:38,561 --> 00:52:45,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like re-releasing games onto the 360 without really doing much other than enhancing the textures a little bit.

879
00:52:45,883 --> 00:52:52,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we see you with Burnout, and for that, EA's going to get left behind.

880
00:52:52,685 --> 00:52:58,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Battlefield 2, Gun, and half the 360 games out there.

881
00:53:01,307 --> 00:53:02,888
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, the bigger question is,

882
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you buying these sports games anyways?

883
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,400
[SPEAKER_03]: No one plays sports games out there.

884
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:11,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a huge... Don't you know, like, some of the most successful titles over here are sports games?

885
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,183
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't talk about them so much.

886
00:53:12,203 --> 00:53:13,383
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a huge audience as well.

887
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:17,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like, some of the other titles you mentioned were, like, NHL, you know, 2006.

888
00:53:17,305 --> 00:53:18,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, who plays hockey games?

889
00:53:18,986 --> 00:53:19,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really?

890
00:53:19,526 --> 00:53:24,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hockey... Hey, Blades of Steel was, like, one of my favorite NES titles ever.

891
00:53:24,928 --> 00:53:25,468
[SPEAKER_05]: So shut your mouth.

892
00:53:25,488 --> 00:53:26,389
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Nintendo.

893
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:32,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my favorite thing was, how the hell did they have a hockey game anyways when there wasn't a season in 2005?

894
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:37,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I still like Super Baseball 3000 for the Neo Geo.

895
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:40,976
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the best things about the Genesis was NHL, okay?

896
00:53:42,377 --> 00:53:42,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Pwned.

897
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:46,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry!

898
00:53:46,459 --> 00:53:48,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull the Canadian card on me, why don't ya?

899
00:53:50,687 --> 00:53:53,288
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, please take us to a more reasonable time.

900
00:53:53,548 --> 00:53:55,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I mention we're just a little off tonight?

901
00:53:57,149 --> 00:53:58,189
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always on.

902
00:53:58,289 --> 00:53:59,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so on.

903
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:03,851
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, then get us back on track with a reasonable article here.

904
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:05,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is something we brought up earlier, yes?

905
00:54:06,592 --> 00:54:15,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is about parenting and about video games, as in gamer parents, which I'm going to be one day.

906
00:54:16,835 --> 00:54:23,498
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in fact, I actually wrote a nice little rant not too long ago about gamer parents playing with their children.

907
00:54:23,998 --> 00:54:38,645
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lovely little bit of writing out about gamer parents and about how through them actually taking an active role in the games that their children play, they're taking responsibility.

908
00:54:39,085 --> 00:54:43,407
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bringing on a new generation of gamers who have that same healthy attitude, I think.

909
00:54:45,168 --> 00:54:45,548
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know,

910
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:54,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of leaving it just as a babysitting tool, it's to balance.

911
00:54:54,882 --> 00:55:03,625
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big theme in this is that parents are using this as a tool to help teach their children and not as a babysitting device.

912
00:55:04,472 --> 00:55:06,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of my fondest memories from being a child.

913
00:55:07,293 --> 00:55:10,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Understand that my mother is definitely not a gamer.

914
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,155
[SPEAKER_05]: She doesn't even really know how to turn a computer on.

915
00:55:13,215 --> 00:55:18,177
[SPEAKER_05]: If she needed something done on the computer, my dad or myself got asked to do it.

916
00:55:18,217 --> 00:55:22,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the best memories I have of childhood was when she would...

917
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:25,576
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom and I used to take turns playing Super Mario Bros.

918
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:54,013
[SPEAKER_00]: That was also how I developed my blindfold level 8-1 skill.

919
00:55:55,234 --> 00:55:55,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

920
00:55:56,075 --> 00:55:56,555
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hot.

921
00:55:57,496 --> 00:55:58,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do it anymore.

922
00:55:58,517 --> 00:56:00,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's been way too long since I've done it.

923
00:56:00,779 --> 00:56:05,763
[SPEAKER_00]: But level 8-1, there's like a definite pattern to the whole stage and it is possible to do it blindfolded.

924
00:56:05,903 --> 00:56:08,025
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a pattern really to the whole game, right?

925
00:56:08,305 --> 00:56:11,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not if you have, not for the Hammer Brother levels because they're all random.

926
00:56:11,648 --> 00:56:12,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's true.

927
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:15,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Their patterns are random, but you can do level 8-1 blindfolded.

928
00:56:15,351 --> 00:56:16,633
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the first level blindfolded too.

929
00:56:16,653 --> 00:56:17,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh.

930
00:56:17,577 --> 00:56:20,898
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, but anyway, that's how I, you know, I learned that by playing with my mom.

931
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:22,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.

932
00:56:23,399 --> 00:56:24,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's see.

933
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:25,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

934
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:26,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

935
00:56:27,421 --> 00:56:27,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

936
00:56:28,081 --> 00:56:29,702
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on over at Konami?

937
00:56:29,742 --> 00:56:30,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Our buddies at Konami.

938
00:56:31,403 --> 00:56:38,266
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had to laugh when I read this news about Konami getting in trouble with the Crime Life advertisement.

939
00:56:38,326 --> 00:56:41,107
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, the advertisement isn't really that bad anyways.

940
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:42,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just people overreacting again.

941
00:56:43,448 --> 00:56:45,929
[SPEAKER_03]: But, anyways, the whole, you know,

942
00:56:47,332 --> 00:56:47,592
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

943
00:57:03,459 --> 00:57:12,010
[SPEAKER_03]: The Advertising Standards Authority upheld the complaint against it and wanted them to pull it.

944
00:57:12,871 --> 00:57:19,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really stupid because when you look at it, most of the advertisements that we see nowadays are just

945
00:57:20,006 --> 00:57:20,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

946
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:25,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that they really take violence and nudity and stuff like that seriously over in the UK.

947
00:57:25,989 --> 00:57:32,032
[SPEAKER_03]: At least not as much as we, I mean, we're just like completely conservative about everything, you know, whereas they're more liberal about it.

948
00:57:32,172 --> 00:57:33,833
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say rabid, but, you know.

949
00:57:34,073 --> 00:57:36,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Shouldn't Konami just write off Crime Life at this point?

950
00:57:36,395 --> 00:57:36,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really?

951
00:57:37,255 --> 00:57:38,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a title they need to be backing?

952
00:57:40,313 --> 00:57:40,613
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

953
00:57:41,034 --> 00:57:43,975
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of those, like, let's pay the rent this month type titles.

954
00:57:44,056 --> 00:57:45,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

955
00:57:45,116 --> 00:57:47,538
[SPEAKER_03]: The game initially was going to come out at about $49.99.

956
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:49,979
[SPEAKER_03]: They dropped it to $20.

957
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:54,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the reviews on it just sucked.

958
00:57:54,382 --> 00:58:02,788
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a nice try, but, you know, just like Nintendo wrote off the Virtual Boy.

959
00:58:02,808 --> 00:58:04,969
[SPEAKER_03]: A travesty.

960
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,991
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got to take your mistakes and say, you know what?

961
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:09,092
[SPEAKER_03]: We messed up.

962
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:10,457
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

963
00:58:11,498 --> 00:58:13,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've been in a bit of a feisty mood tonight.

964
00:58:14,881 --> 00:58:20,266
[SPEAKER_05]: One reason for that is we're really excited about something as well that's going on here at Orange Lounge Radio.

965
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:26,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And to help us talk about what's going on here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight, we decided to invite on a very special guest.

966
00:58:27,392 --> 00:58:31,476
[SPEAKER_05]: We always talk about support independent podcasting, support podcasters.

967
00:58:31,516 --> 00:58:32,117
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to...

968
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:37,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Back up what other folks do out there in the independent podcast revolution.

969
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,923
[SPEAKER_05]: We would not exist without the support of other folks out there.

970
00:58:41,443 --> 00:58:49,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the folks that's always been very supportive of our show, and we just love him to death, is the one and only Bobby Blackwolf from the Bobby Blackwolf Show over at AllGames.com.

971
00:58:49,788 --> 00:58:51,169
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's actually on the line with us right now.

972
00:58:51,229 --> 00:58:51,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, you there?

973
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:52,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I am.

974
00:58:52,971 --> 00:58:53,911
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

975
00:58:54,191 --> 00:58:54,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

976
00:58:54,552 --> 00:58:55,192
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you, Bobby?

977
00:58:55,212 --> 00:58:56,013
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your show tonight?

978
00:58:56,053 --> 00:58:56,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Good one?

979
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:57,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it went pretty good.

980
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:07,945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting because Bobby and I, we tape almost the exact same time, but it's just because we've done it that way for a long time, so it just kind of works out that way, funny sometimes.

981
00:59:08,205 --> 00:59:14,048
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can download his show as a podcast just like you can download ours, so it allows you to stay in touch with both of them, so it's awesome.

982
00:59:14,629 --> 00:59:18,931
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so Bobby, tell us first off a little bit about allgames.com.

983
00:59:18,951 --> 00:59:20,312
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this website that you're a part of?

984
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:24,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, it's a sequel to Left Behind.

985
00:59:24,845 --> 00:59:25,446
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just kidding.

986
00:59:26,648 --> 00:59:30,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody else is feeling a little feisty tonight.

987
00:59:31,256 --> 00:59:31,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

988
00:59:33,038 --> 00:59:35,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Allgames.com was started by Scott Rubin about 10 years ago.

989
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,504
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people here may recognize the name Scott Rubin from G4TV.com.

990
00:59:40,564 --> 00:59:41,865
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the original male host.

991
00:59:42,786 --> 00:59:51,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Before then, he ran the Allgames Network, which started off doing radio, a weekly radio show in real audio back in 1996.

992
00:59:52,754 --> 01:00:00,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he joined up with Pseudo Online Interactive to do kind of an IPTV network, is what it would be called today, using real video.

993
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:04,682
[SPEAKER_01]: and he oversaw 15 hours worth of gaming content a week.

994
01:00:05,162 --> 01:00:07,143
[SPEAKER_01]: A daily live show and all that stuff.

995
01:00:07,443 --> 01:00:12,984
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hardcore because real audio and real video, like streaming and stuff, that stuff was a pain in the ass.

996
01:00:13,144 --> 01:00:15,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's what our college radio station used to use.

997
01:00:15,965 --> 01:00:16,905
[SPEAKER_05]: That stuff was a pain.

998
01:00:16,985 --> 01:00:19,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that takes a lot of dedication.

999
01:00:20,006 --> 01:00:22,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Apple made it easy for people to podcast in comparison.

1000
01:00:23,627 --> 01:00:23,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1001
01:00:24,347 --> 01:00:27,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the dot-com bust came out and...

1002
01:00:28,413 --> 01:00:31,515
[SPEAKER_01]: All Games Network died, pretty much, in the .com bust.

1003
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:35,217
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Comcast brought him over to help start G4.

1004
01:00:35,237 --> 01:00:42,141
[SPEAKER_01]: So he moved out to Los Angeles, started G4, thought that they were going to be taking all these risks with gaming television programming.

1005
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:45,183
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, they just didn't understand.

1006
01:00:45,903 --> 01:00:50,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And in about 2004, he said, okay, their vision is gone.

1007
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:52,247
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going in a completely different direction.

1008
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:53,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I want out.

1009
01:00:53,587 --> 01:00:54,388
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he got out.

1010
01:00:55,205 --> 01:00:56,465
[SPEAKER_01]: relaunched allgames.com.

1011
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:57,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he has a production company.

1012
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:02,707
[SPEAKER_01]: He's developing television, radio, and internet content all devoted to gaming.

1013
01:01:03,648 --> 01:01:05,308
[SPEAKER_01]: And All Games Radio is one of those parts.

1014
01:01:06,049 --> 01:01:06,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1015
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Now what's your involvement with all of this then?

1016
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:12,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well I've been a fan of Scott Rubin's work.

1017
01:01:12,991 --> 01:01:15,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been listening to his stuff and watching his stuff since 97.

1018
01:01:15,412 --> 01:01:17,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I went over, worked with G4.

1019
01:01:18,153 --> 01:01:22,594
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually a moderator on their forums back when G4 actually was good.

1020
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:26,289
[SPEAKER_01]: which they're not... Ancient history.

1021
01:01:28,832 --> 01:01:33,477
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when he relaunched AllGames.com, I really kind of was in the right place at the right time.

1022
01:01:33,517 --> 01:01:40,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd been around long enough, and he basically let me help him with his site, with his forums, and then he had a live 365 station.

1023
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:41,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, hey, let me do a show.

1024
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:48,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a show in 2004, and we had the MP3 archives of the show, which is what it was called.

1025
01:01:48,228 --> 01:01:50,129
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcasting was very new.

1026
01:01:50,969 --> 01:01:54,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we actually have All Games Radio as a 24-7 music station.

1027
01:01:54,692 --> 01:01:57,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I pretty much run it.

1028
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:08,000
[SPEAKER_01]: We play game music, or we play talk programming, either his show, which is every weeknight, live from the Arena Interactive Lounge in Santa Monica, or my show on Sunday nights.

1029
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:16,868
[SPEAKER_05]: This arena interactive lounge sounds pretty awesome because it sounds like a place where you can just kind of go and like just kind of like kick back, have a beer, play some games.

1030
01:02:16,908 --> 01:02:18,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's Scott over there doing a show.

1031
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:19,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds pretty awesome.

1032
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:20,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I guess you can't really have a beer.

1033
01:02:20,872 --> 01:02:21,773
[SPEAKER_05]: This is California, huh?

1034
01:02:22,033 --> 01:02:23,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, have a root beer.

1035
01:02:23,795 --> 01:02:25,016
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1036
01:02:25,957 --> 01:02:26,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what you do.

1037
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:28,319
[SPEAKER_01]: It's BYOB.

1038
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,321
[SPEAKER_01]: If you bring your own, you can have it there.

1039
01:02:31,542 --> 01:02:31,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1040
01:02:31,862 --> 01:02:32,823
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll store it for you.

1041
01:02:32,943 --> 01:02:33,303
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1042
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:40,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe during E3, me and Jamie and Loki will all come with some Guinness and game it up right.

1043
01:02:41,089 --> 01:02:43,491
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be quite expensive on my part.

1044
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:43,911
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1045
01:02:44,071 --> 01:02:46,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, so you have a show over on All Games.

1046
01:02:46,373 --> 01:02:47,394
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your show all about?

1047
01:02:47,414 --> 01:02:48,655
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the Bobby Blackwolf show about?

1048
01:02:49,596 --> 01:02:51,117
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a one-person show.

1049
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:59,986
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about news, we have a toll-free number that people can call in with Skype.

1050
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:03,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically just running down the news, and I do some interviews.

1051
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:07,033
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Tommy Tallarico on the show last week for about an hour and a half.

1052
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:09,255
[SPEAKER_01]: We even asked a question from you.

1053
01:03:09,575 --> 01:03:09,875
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1054
01:03:09,975 --> 01:03:11,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually listened to the show.

1055
01:03:11,576 --> 01:03:14,278
[SPEAKER_05]: This was weird for me because we didn't have Orange Lounge Radio last week.

1056
01:03:14,338 --> 01:03:16,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of like, hmm, what am I going to do tonight?

1057
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:18,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really listen to my own show because there is no show.

1058
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go listen to Bobby's show.

1059
01:03:19,441 --> 01:03:21,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I never get a chance to listen to Bobby's show live.

1060
01:03:21,522 --> 01:03:24,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see how it is live versus taped.

1061
01:03:24,483 --> 01:03:33,809
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had Tommy Tallarico on, and I thought that was kind of crazy because we've been known to give Tommy a little bit of a hard time here on this program.

1062
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1063
01:03:34,749 --> 01:03:35,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little bit.

1064
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:36,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was kind of funny.

1065
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:38,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know I had to ask a question.

1066
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:41,171
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, Loki, where do you think I went?

1067
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Of all the Tommy Tallarico things, what do you think I had to ask about?

1068
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:46,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember what else he's involved in.

1069
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:50,433
[SPEAKER_03]: He was involved in a lot of things, actually.

1070
01:03:50,613 --> 01:03:50,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1071
01:03:50,933 --> 01:03:52,294
[SPEAKER_03]: But the music stuff.

1072
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:52,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1073
01:03:52,634 --> 01:03:53,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games live, of course.

1074
01:03:54,274 --> 01:03:56,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I had to ask him any question about video games live, what do you think I brought up?

1075
01:03:58,829 --> 01:03:59,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know.

1076
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:00,890
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Pong.

1077
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:02,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to ask, why Pong?

1078
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:03,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Why Pong?

1079
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:09,996
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course he said, basically his ten minute answer or whatever it was, basically boiled down to, dude, it's eight seconds of Pong.

1080
01:04:11,058 --> 01:04:11,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1081
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:31,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, God damn it, that show sucked.

1082
01:04:31,572 --> 01:04:32,373
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not his fault.

1083
01:04:33,394 --> 01:04:34,295
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the writers.

1084
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:36,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what I learned about that show?

1085
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:37,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know if I should say.

1086
01:04:37,238 --> 01:04:38,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get back on topic here.

1087
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:39,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

1088
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:44,745
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have your program and you get some pretty cool interviews once in a while, yeah?

1089
01:04:45,526 --> 01:04:46,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, pretty much.

1090
01:04:46,406 --> 01:04:48,709
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so give us the details real quick.

1091
01:04:48,749 --> 01:04:50,150
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we tune into your show if we want to hear it?

1092
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:51,931
[SPEAKER_01]: AllGamesRadio.com is the URL for my show.

1093
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we have you on the show tonight?

1094
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:57,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there some type of ulterior motive that we have you on the program tonight?

1095
01:04:57,475 --> 01:04:57,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1096
01:04:57,696 --> 01:04:58,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it, Bobby.

1097
01:05:15,242 --> 01:05:29,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, essentially what we've done, I've been talking with Rob and, you know, to DarkSakura and Loki over there, and we have extended an official invitation to re-air this program you're listening on our stream on Monday nights.

1098
01:05:31,066 --> 01:05:35,467
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, essentially what will happen is it's going to air on Monday nights at 7 p.m.

1099
01:05:35,527 --> 01:05:36,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastern, 7 p.m.

1100
01:05:36,707 --> 01:05:43,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific, with Scott Rubin's All Games Interactive is going to run right up to it, and then people will get to listen to both Part A and Part B.

1101
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:45,816
[SPEAKER_01]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1102
01:06:13,234 --> 01:06:13,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

1103
01:06:13,775 --> 01:06:14,235
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

1104
01:06:14,295 --> 01:06:21,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to hear Part B before we push on the podcast stream, because sometimes we're lazy and we slack off here at OLR, but all games, they're on it.

1105
01:06:21,922 --> 01:06:25,605
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got our Part B. They're going to play it Monday nights, so you can hear that in advance.

1106
01:06:25,825 --> 01:06:35,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And more than anything, we're just kind of excited to be a part of this and kind of work together, because independent productions and podcasts and things shouldn't work against each other.

1107
01:06:35,634 --> 01:06:36,354
[SPEAKER_05]: They should work together.

1108
01:06:36,414 --> 01:06:39,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're very happy to be on board, Bobby, and thank you so much for thinking of us.

1109
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:40,318
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to...

1110
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:48,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at G4 volunteering when Tech TV occurred.

1111
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:50,801
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not changing anything about OLR.

1112
01:06:50,861 --> 01:06:52,742
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to take over your station.

1113
01:06:52,822 --> 01:06:55,483
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to change any content or anything.

1114
01:06:55,863 --> 01:06:58,904
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just re-airing the same show trying to expand it to a new audience.

1115
01:06:59,175 --> 01:06:59,976
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I love.

1116
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:05,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, what makes me so honored is because they're coming and saying, we like what you do as is.

1117
01:07:06,164 --> 01:07:08,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, wow, somebody likes us.

1118
01:07:09,388 --> 01:07:09,868
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's great.

1119
01:07:09,888 --> 01:07:10,910
[SPEAKER_05]: That gives me the warm fuzzies.

1120
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:11,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's nice.

1121
01:07:11,891 --> 01:07:13,673
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for giving us the warm fuzzies.

1122
01:07:13,813 --> 01:07:14,194
[SPEAKER_05]: We love it.

1123
01:07:15,756 --> 01:07:18,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other exciting programming coming as well to all games?

1124
01:07:18,962 --> 01:07:35,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the things that we're doing, we're going to be all at GDC in San Jose, and we are actually going to be broadcasting on All Games Radio on the Thursday night of GDC the Game Audio Network Guild Awards, which is going to be a two-hour award show with live music, live performances, and

1125
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Giving awards for music of the year, audio of the year, and all that.

1126
01:07:40,043 --> 01:07:42,745
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be backstage there doing some interviews then.

1127
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:49,091
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Friday night for my show, I'm going to be backstage at Video Games Live asking why Pong.

1128
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,835
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be airing those on my show that weekend.

1129
01:07:53,632 --> 01:07:55,353
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be so awesome.

1130
01:07:55,413 --> 01:07:58,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe we're like a part of this in a roundabout way.

1131
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,157
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a part of the same station, so that's awesome.

1132
01:08:00,457 --> 01:08:01,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be listening to that.

1133
01:08:01,938 --> 01:08:02,639
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be awesome.

1134
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,301
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is in store in the future of AllGames.com?

1135
01:08:06,341 --> 01:08:11,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not necessarily just programming, but what's in store for the website, the whole vision of AllGames?

1136
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:14,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to be adding some other podcasts.

1137
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,709
[SPEAKER_01]: We've approached other independent podcasters.

1138
01:08:16,749 --> 01:08:17,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all are just the first.

1139
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:21,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to be putting a lot more podcasts on.

1140
01:08:22,386 --> 01:08:24,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so people can find new podcasts.

1141
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:29,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott Rubin does a lot of television production.

1142
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:33,796
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a short film done by a man named Michael Hyland called As Real As Your Life.

1143
01:08:33,896 --> 01:08:37,720
[SPEAKER_01]: It was premiered at the TED conference during David Perry's.

1144
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,481
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be screened at GDC, I believe.

1145
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:41,343
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about video game addiction.

1146
01:08:41,363 --> 01:08:42,924
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take that to film festivals.

1147
01:08:43,925 --> 01:08:48,790
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some television programs, too, that we're pitching that we can't talk more about yet.

1148
01:08:49,346 --> 01:08:51,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1149
01:08:51,088 --> 01:08:53,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to give you the pitch for OLR TV later.

1150
01:08:53,731 --> 01:08:54,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1151
01:08:54,793 --> 01:08:55,033
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1152
01:08:56,314 --> 01:08:58,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, no, seriously, though, thank you so much, Bobby.

1153
01:08:58,897 --> 01:09:01,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And please pass along our thanks to Scott as well.

1154
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:07,287
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really excited to be on board and just kind of get our show out there and be a part of this growing network.

1155
01:09:07,327 --> 01:09:07,768
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

1156
01:09:08,489 --> 01:09:08,589
Yep.

1157
01:09:09,221 --> 01:09:16,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody listening live, I'm in your chat room, and if they want to ask questions and calm fears or something, they can feel free to see me in there.

1158
01:09:17,047 --> 01:09:19,208
[SPEAKER_05]: On this end, guys, nothing's changing.

1159
01:09:19,228 --> 01:09:21,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there are other changes coming to OLR, but it has nothing to do with this.

1160
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:23,832
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all us that we're changing.

1161
01:09:24,172 --> 01:09:25,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess I'll just go ahead and say it.

1162
01:09:25,593 --> 01:09:32,178
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be making our station – we're going to be putting a little more oomph in our station because we ran a poll on Orange Lounge Radio, and we found –

1163
01:09:32,538 --> 01:09:35,559
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, and maybe someday Spike can work with you too, come on your show.

1164
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:02,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for accepting.

1165
01:10:02,564 --> 01:10:03,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a problem.

1166
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:04,031
[SPEAKER_05]: You take care, Bobby.

1167
01:10:04,654 --> 01:10:04,935
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

1168
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:05,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

1169
01:10:06,792 --> 01:10:11,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf, that website again, www.allgames.com slash podcast.

1170
01:10:11,954 --> 01:10:16,296
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to hear Bobby's show, allgames.com, Orange Lounge Radio starts on Monday.

1171
01:10:16,336 --> 01:10:21,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of you guys might actually be hearing this show on allgames.com for the first time tomorrow.

1172
01:10:22,139 --> 01:10:24,400
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was actually yesterday when we taped, forget it.

1173
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:32,664
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki, take us out of this hour or hour and a half that we're turning into with a little story here about DDR and email and what the heck?

1174
01:10:34,878 --> 01:10:38,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yet another stupid idea brought to you by Microsoft.

1175
01:10:38,941 --> 01:10:44,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this one's actually called StepMail, and that's right, it uses a DDR pad to check your email.

1176
01:10:45,206 --> 01:10:59,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually part of this new interface called StepUI, and basically their whole spin on this is, you know what, you're not exercising enough while you're browsing on your PC, and this is a better way to do that.

1177
01:11:01,195 --> 01:11:03,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, folks, how long does it take to check email?

1178
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:03,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, two minutes?

1179
01:11:04,438 --> 01:11:11,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we really need to be walking around on a giant pad that really is obtrusive and just... No.

1180
01:11:12,646 --> 01:11:14,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is the dumbest idea ever.

1181
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:20,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, that's almost as dumb as, like, saying, okay, I'm going to control my car with this dance pad as well.

1182
01:11:21,594 --> 01:11:26,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we sure that something's just not being horribly, horribly misinterpreted or misreported here?

1183
01:11:28,069 --> 01:11:30,471
[SPEAKER_03]: This is straight on Microsoft's website, okay?

1184
01:11:30,711 --> 01:11:34,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want you to know that this isn't like some sort of thing that they're making up.

1185
01:11:34,954 --> 01:11:41,338
[SPEAKER_03]: This shows picture of some woman stepping on a dance pad, which, by the way, looks like a red octane pad.

1186
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:45,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yes, and it shows the interface right here.

1187
01:11:45,879 --> 01:11:50,080
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, up, down, close, open, folders, delete.

1188
01:11:50,241 --> 01:11:52,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how you have to jump to do different things.

1189
01:11:54,162 --> 01:11:54,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks so dumb.

1190
01:11:55,662 --> 01:11:57,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's completely retarded.

1191
01:11:57,503 --> 01:12:04,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they've got a photo viewing thing, which looks like someone crapped it out in about two seconds.

1192
01:12:04,165 --> 01:12:08,547
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what would be sweet is if the announcer from DDR Extreme would read your email.

1193
01:12:08,567 --> 01:12:09,447
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got mail!

1194
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:10,668
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got mail!

1195
01:12:10,748 --> 01:12:11,608
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your new record!

1196
01:12:12,148 --> 01:12:13,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever that guy says, you know?

1197
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:14,189
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

1198
01:12:14,809 --> 01:12:17,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Come get Viagra at our store for free!

1199
01:12:17,752 --> 01:12:24,998
[SPEAKER_00]: What they need to do is have a program that hooks up to your email and a little pedal that you put on the ground so that you're sitting down and you're doing like a recumbent bike.

1200
01:12:25,518 --> 01:12:28,320
[SPEAKER_00]: And the moment you stop pedaling, your email closes.

1201
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't they have these net bikes?

1202
01:12:29,621 --> 01:12:30,862
[SPEAKER_00]: They do at the gym!

1203
01:12:30,882 --> 01:12:33,044
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have something like that at home.

1204
01:12:33,064 --> 01:12:40,330
[SPEAKER_03]: The study shows, using this program, the average heart rate is increased almost 20% while using StepMail and 13% for StepPhoto.

1205
01:12:42,919 --> 01:12:45,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Really though, why would you be looking at photos?

1206
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:47,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, can you imagine?

1207
01:12:48,183 --> 01:12:49,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to look through my picture album.

1208
01:12:49,884 --> 01:12:51,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me set up this giant dance pad.

1209
01:12:51,966 --> 01:12:55,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And then someone walks in the room, what the hell are you doing, you complete retard?

1210
01:12:55,888 --> 01:12:57,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm checking my photos in email!

1211
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:59,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and you're lame.

1212
01:13:00,392 --> 01:13:01,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is, here it is, here it is.

1213
01:13:02,913 --> 01:13:03,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine this.

1214
01:13:04,174 --> 01:13:05,095
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have a party.

1215
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:06,296
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have an adult party.

1216
01:13:07,057 --> 01:13:14,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you could get X-rated pictures to look at on this thing and play Naked Twister on the DDR mat.

1217
01:13:14,663 --> 01:13:15,244
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

1218
01:13:15,664 --> 01:13:16,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's retarded.

1219
01:13:16,585 --> 01:13:19,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the only reason this thing's going to get used, ever.

1220
01:13:19,087 --> 01:13:20,328
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing will never get used.

1221
01:13:20,848 --> 01:13:24,391
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be some stupid study that Microsoft wastes their money on.

1222
01:13:25,152 --> 01:13:28,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Then later on next year, come tax time, they'll be like, you know what?

1223
01:13:28,835 --> 01:13:29,756
[SPEAKER_03]: We lost money on this.

1224
01:13:29,996 --> 01:13:31,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Tax write-off!

1225
01:13:31,277 --> 01:13:32,218
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1226
01:13:32,418 --> 01:13:33,959
[SPEAKER_02]: All this is is a tax write-off.

1227
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:37,262
[SPEAKER_02]: What applications do you think this will have on the origami?

1228
01:13:39,403 --> 01:13:43,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can tell you this much, that the dance pad is almost the size of the origami.

1229
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:47,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a break here.

1230
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:51,371
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio in a little bit.

1231
01:13:51,911 --> 01:13:56,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1232
01:13:57,294 --> 01:14:01,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
