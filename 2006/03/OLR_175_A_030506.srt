00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:38,560
it feels so good to be back you don't even know welcome back to orange lounge

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,760
radio episode number 175 for this March the 5th of 2006 our first show back

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,800
after a little bit of a vacation there dark soccer and I had plans that took us

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,520
out of town real life gets in the way of independent podcasting sometimes so we

10
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,180
took a little time off Loki lovely job filling in there in the past couple

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,740
weeks with little just just short shows just it's a little bit of crack just to

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,120
hold you over though so we appreciate that of course and just so you guys know

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,400
that wasn't the original plan the original plan is that dark Sakura myself

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,460
and Loki we're all gonna do one show but dark Sakura was having like mic issues

15
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,340
or something and I was broke and couldn't buy anyone cuz we're power

16
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:28,280
Cuz we don't get a paycheck. I made do with my headset mic on a pump. There you go. There you go, and I myself

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,200
Lots happened in the past two weeks a lot's happened for one Loki. I bought an iBook

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,040
Okay, I

19
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,320
Was just waiting for some witty retort. I bought an iBook and the plan was to do a podcast for my brand new iBook

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,280
I was gonna do that and that didn't work out too. Well, did it you know? No, no, it's not the iBooks fault

21
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,880
I love I love my iBook. I really do. I'm sorry Loki the whole Mac thing

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,200
I'm totally on Jamie's side now. I love the iBook. It's great. I mean, I'm when it comes to computers

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,640
I'm I still consider myself bi I I love PC and there's you know, some some sometimes you feel like a nut

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,160
Sometimes you don't okay. I some things I want a PC some days

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,420
I want a Mac, but I really have appreciated what both have to offer there. So

26
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,220
So I got an iBook and I wasn't able to do the podcasting on it and that was

27
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,860
mostly because you know you go out when you go travel for a long time you go out

28
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,220
with a certain plan and you don't always necessarily get everything done that you

29
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,340
originally intended to do like I just got too busy in other words I just got

30
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,220
too busy to take the time to set it all up. Didn't you try using like the mic that's

31
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,900
actually part of it? There's actually a mic that's built in but it wasn't it wasn't

32
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,860
good enough. Exactly. It sounded like I was talking out of a Dixie cup. I mean it would

33
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,540
work for skype or something but it would not work for trying to do a

34
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,900
professional sounding show as as we try to fake once in a while oh by the way

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,180
by the way hello you are listening to orange lounge radio I'm Rob Roberts also

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,280
my friend Julie

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,840
brought chocolate covered espresso beans to work in at eight fifteen

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,800
and then we went to do um... gaming that night

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,880
Tabletop gaming, you know where you roll dice and not you know, use your controller. Yeah

49
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,740
And nobody else showed up in a roll a d20. Hey, no, actually we used d6. Oh, sorry. No. No, we used e10s

50
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,740
It's Buffy. All right nerd

51
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,660
Anyway, I uh, I ate like 10 more

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,020
Okay, and I was bouncing yeah, I know caffeine thing going and so Friday I was like, you know what I'm no caffeine

53
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:06,420
I've been drinking kombucha tea sounds dirty it's it's made out of it's a

54
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,060
fermented tea made with mushrooms and sweet tea uh-huh and it tastes like

55
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,100
apple cider vinegar all right but it's been keeping me healthy and keeping the

56
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,860
withdrawal symptoms down and I've I've I had decaf coffee so for all those

57
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,780
people who have emailed concerned about your health these are the actions you're

58
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,300
taking to combat that I am so proud of myself I had a sinus infection last week

59
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,580
uh-huh and I did not okay shut up sorry I'm not laughing at you I'm just okay

60
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,260
I'm laughing for a rude reason but I mean it's just it's crazy I I did not go

61
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,100
to the doctor I did not let them put me on any drugs I drink hot tea all week

62
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,780
mm-hmm and as a result I am feeling fabulous tonight good because I am fully

63
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,980
from here on unless I break something not going to the doctor ever again for

64
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,660
an illness unless I have cancer or a brain tumor let's hope that doesn't

65
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,200
happen. Alright, we gotta keep it moving. We do have video games to talk about. In case

66
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,660
you haven't listened to Orange Lounge Radio before, we don't usually bitch so much about

67
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,400
our personal lives, but we've been gone for two weeks, so we have a lot to catch up on.

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,780
So we will get to games very shortly. Say hello, of course, to Loki. No Orange Lounge

69
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,020
will be complete without Loki. I do feel sick today. Do you? Well, here's the reason why

70
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:24,140
I feel sick. Basically, I went to the movies today and I saw Ultraviolet, but then I ate

71
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,820
a whole bag of popcorn. And then afterwards I went to Applebee's and I had fish and chips

72
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,680
with their honey pepper sauce. And then I was slamming down Pepsi's all day long and

73
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,540
playing Xbox Live. And to the point where I was playing Xbox Live and either with the

74
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,900
adrenaline of playing full auto and Pepsi's, you know, the caffeine, I was literally shaking

75
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,140
like I had the chills. And now my stomach feels like I'm, you know, I'm sick. But it's

76
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,380
probably just because of all that popcorn and I haven't eaten anything since lunch.

77
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,620
so uh...

78
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,780
but other than that i've been playing a lot of xbox live i swear to god sometimes

79
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,120
you and jamie are like yin and yang i mean she'll have this healthy story to

80
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,900
talk about in the mail

81
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,580
i went to applebee's and dined on chicken strips or whatever it was you had

82
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:10,220
it's just because i ate a bag of popcorn and and you know a bunch of

83
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,340
honey pepper sauce and that stuff

84
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,980
doesn't agree with my stuff

85
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,340
chakra chupacabra tea or whatever jamie has

86
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,140
chupacabra tea

87
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,820
whatever it is you have

88
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,460
loki has you know and of course my neck is all stiff and has been hurting for like two

89
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:33,860
days but other than that you know it's all good but lots of games and fun stuff and I

90
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,600
did podcasts earlier in the week and we restarted our grand theft auto stats so lots and lots

91
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,520
of fun stuff but yeah ultraviolet for those who are wondering if the movie's good or not

92
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,820
it's okay but it has really bad cg in it and halfway through the movie you're like what

93
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,740
the hell are they trying to do that's about it so yeah all right well we also

94
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,460
have a special guest tonight once in a while we like to invite other people in

95
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,380
the house we've been ignoring him for the past 10 minutes very sorry to spike

96
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,280
say hello to spike I don't mind being ignored but thank you for having me

97
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,460
tonight not a problem it's good to have you here don't be afraid to just put

98
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,000
that mic right there right next to your mouth because otherwise there's their

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
cheap mics their RadioShack mics they don't pick up otherwise so cheap is the

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,680
best. There you go. So how are you doing? Doing fantastic. I've been playing Trauma

101
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,480
Center all week. Really? And it's addicted me the way that I thought only

102
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,160
World of Warcraft could. And, well, usually that we kick off the show with

103
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,800
how is your gaming week, so Spike, since you're kicking us off, let's do it. Trauma

104
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,080
Center, is it really as hard as everybody says it is? I haven't really played it. I

105
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,220
have to be honest. I haven't really played it, but I've heard it's insanely hard. I tried

106
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,960
playing it on the subway and almost killed myself, but when I sat down to it,

107
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,880
it, sucked me in like a crazy, massively multiplayer online game. Very addictive, very innovative,

108
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,760
I certainly would like to see another version of it.

109
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,480
I just want to point out, for those asking in the chat room, this is not the same Spike

110
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:05,200
on DDR Freak, some folks are wondering, this is my buddy Spike, do you really have any

111
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,220
credentials to be on this program? I guess not, but that's okay, you're a gamer, that's

112
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,400
all you need, right Spike? He's laughing.

113
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I hate you.

114
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
No, that's alright.

115
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Everybody does.

116
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Alright.

117
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Well, no, we love having you here.

118
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
It's different, different Spike.

119
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,040
I know it's exciting news, actually, about Trauma Center.

120
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,400
That's one of the games that's being brought over to the revolution.

121
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Confirmed.

122
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,760
How do you know this, Mr. Man?

123
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,120
Because there's a news story about it.

124
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Oh, okay.

125
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm assuming we'll get into that later.

126
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Possibly.

127
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,860
Anything else besides Trauma Center in your week, Spike?

128
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,600
Not DDR Freak Spike, but R-Spike, O-L-R-Spike?

129
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,400
a lot of World of Warcraft, it's pretty pathetic

130
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,940
What kind of character are you in World of Warcraft?

131
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,880
What kind of character are you in World of Warcraft? I just started a Tauren War-

132
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,380
Hunter, and it's quite exciting because it's my first Horde character

133
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,600
and it's quite difficult compared to an Alliance character

134
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,920
You know what, I thought I would hate the Horde when I first started playing

135
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,360
Horde, but I actually kind of enjoy

136
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,200
Horde side, I think a little more than Alliance side. Alliance side is a little

137
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
I don't know. It's too much like every other MMO I've played in that sense.

138
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,200
I immediately made an undead. I made my elf, and then I made an undead.

139
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Because I had to have the zombie thing going on.

140
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Like Thriller?

141
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
No, no, no. Like Romero Zombie.

142
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Anyway, thank you very much, Spike.

143
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Feel free to give your input on anything throughout the show and all that fun stuff.

144
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,200
And if you have anything to plug, any upcoming projects, anything you're doing, just feel free. Get it out there.

145
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I hear you're a very good DJ. You do DJ stuff, right?

146
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Yes, I do.

147
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Not like podcasting type of DJ stuff, but like spinning?

148
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Like I go to clubs, you know. Right now, the iPod thing is a big deal, but I still say vinyl is the way to go.

149
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,200
There you go. You're just a purist. Nothing wrong with that.

150
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Alright, let's go over to Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week?

151
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Well, my series of gaming weeks, I did play a lot of Animal Crossing and some Popolo Cross.

152
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,120
um although I had to start over because I was on no I actually I didn't I was

153
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,360
going to start over on your PSP and then I realized that it was gonna be on your

154
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,400
memory card I'd too lazy to move it so I just watched tell boy and kill Bill on

155
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,760
the plane going to Alabama that's right somebody somebody borrowed my PSP while

156
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,560
I was gone but that's okay she had that's good I put it in a case and I

157
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,520
cleaned the screen cuz look let me put it this way the last time I played that

158
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,360
was when Luminous was still a new game okay let's just put it that way that PSP

159
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,440
oh no and I checked out OLR PSP on it that's it otherwise that PSP is not

160
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,000
really doing it for me sorry sorry PSP fans I'm just not feeling the love with

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,140
the offerings that are out yet but yet Power Stone is coming to the PS that is

162
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,040
true so awesome I love Power Stone there's a lot of sexy shit coming out for the

163
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,520
PSP so I'm glad Jamie cleaned it so that I'm ready it's ready to go for me when I

164
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,160
get it back and can play the you know I want to play that Mega Man stuff and the

165
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:10,040
um uh Katamari Damacy PSP it's gonna be a good year for PSP so PSP fans you can just stop writing

166
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,440
those angry emails right now it'll be fine I'll get along I'll rediscover my love for PSP just wait

167
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:23,000
well we've also Dan's been playing uh Phoenix right like all the damn time so I've gotten to

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,840
see like the fourth trial the whole thing because he kept making me watch it and it was pretty cool

169
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,400
but I sort of don't need to play now because I know how it goes between him

170
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,420
and Ross you know spoiling it for me I'm eventually gonna play it but you know I

171
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:44,020
sort of like I can just watch everybody else play it and I think Dan finally

172
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:52,680
beat Need for Speed underground so that was pretty cool and he's been just

173
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,600
watching a lot of Simpsons so we haven't had a lot of console stuff going on in

174
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,040
the house, although didn't you say you saw him with this astronomically high score for

175
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Smash TV?

176
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,940
Yes, and I'm glad, if I can go ahead, I'll get into my gaming week.

177
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,620
I'm sure a lot of folks, when we last left the Orange Lounge Radio crew before the big

178
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,160
vacation, I had my Xbox 360 that went bad.

179
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,520
I had to send it in for a replacement and I've gotten emails asking, did you get the

180
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
replacement?

181
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,760
Yes, the replacement came about, not that long after I said, I think it took about two

182
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,520
business days and I had it back.

183
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,200
So it came back pretty quick, but of course I wasn't here to enjoy it, it's just Xtifer,

184
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,820
my roommate, told me it was here.

185
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:38,880
So when I got back from the trip, I played Xbox 360, that's a lot of what I've been doing

186
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,200
this weekend, and I saw your husband's high score on Smash TV, because that's one of the

187
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,680
games I checked out, Smash TV.

188
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,280
I've been playing hell a lot of the stuff on the Xbox Live Arcade, Crystal Quest, because

189
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,740
I remember that game on the Mac from years ago.

190
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,920
Pretty cool reinterpretation.

191
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,640
Somebody said on our forums that the achievement points were really easy in that game, and

192
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
I have to agree.

193
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Really easy.

194
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,200
You want like 50 easy achievement points?

195
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
There you go.

196
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,840
I wasn't able to get good achievement points on that.

197
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,200
All you have to do, don't use the smart bomb and get all the way to level 30.

198
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,440
That's like 30 points right there for getting that far.

199
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,720
So there's that, and then what else did I play on there?

200
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,240
A little bit of Geometry Wars still, although I haven't gotten much better at that.

201
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,460
And I bought Full Auto, just because of all the good things I heard about it.

202
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,620
from critics, because a lot of critics have bashed it, but from word of mouth, a lot of

203
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,620
people have been saying good things about full auto. So I picked it up, I have to say

204
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:34,220
I'm enjoying it. I haven't gotten to play a whole lot, but I like it so far. It's racing

205
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,220
with guns, which is never a bad thing.

206
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,500
Wait until you get to the end of the game. Probably if you listened to last week's podcast,

207
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,760
you would have heard me yelling and screaming about the game and saying, God dammit, I fucking

208
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,320
hate this end part of the game. The rewind feature is awesome. I love that. Like, if

209
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,060
I screw up I can just rewind time it's awesome more games need to have Mario

210
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,900
Kart needs that especially online because I screw up too much when I play

211
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,600
online or when people disconnect I'll just rewind so that they didn't just

212
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,740
actually disconnect speaking of DS I also picked up this is a game I was so

213
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,680
looking forward to very excited about Super Princess Peach on the DS I don't

214
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,380
know I'm I don't know if I'm really thrilled with this game it just wasn't

215
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,300
what I expected and maybe that's my own damn fault I didn't really read up on

216
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,920
this game I just assumed oh it will be like Mario Brothers but it'll be

217
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,560
Princess Peach because I heard that like Nintendo is like trying to get back to

218
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,640
their roots especially with like the new Mario DS games coming out I assume that

219
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,760
Princess Peach would be like you know it would be like oh it's like Mario 2 but

220
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,740
on the DS and with Pete whoa was I wrong because this is good this is kind of

221
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,400
funny because the whole concept behind the game is that Princess Peach is

222
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,440
totally emotionally unstable like most women I know just just just kidding you

223
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,480
We need to be quiet, Mr. Ron.

224
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,800
I'm kidding, but seriously, the whole concept of the game is that Princess Peach is emotionally

225
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,080
unstable and you can set things on fire with her anger, you can make the grass grow with

226
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,280
her tears, you can make her life regenerate with her calmness or acid trip, I don't know

227
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,240
what mood that's supposed to be.

228
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
But it's very strange.

229
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,300
The power of Prozac.

230
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,100
The way this game controls is very strange.

231
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,040
So if you're thinking you're just getting Mario Bros. with Princess Peach, you're not.

232
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
You're not.

233
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,980
It's a little weird like it really put me off when I first started, but now that I'm getting a little more into it

234
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,180
Okay, I think I could play a little further in this game

235
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,640
I don't know if I'm gonna I don't know if it's gonna keep my attention to completion though, which is too bad

236
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:34,180
Peach doesn't feel like the same character that she is in the other Mario games and in like Mario Party

237
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,320
And I realized maybe part of this is to you know obviously make peach the hero for once

238
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,240
but if you've ever played Mario Party against me you'll know that peach is

239
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,560
always the hero of Mario Party because I always play peach and I always win so

240
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:56,200
I seem to have a memory of beating you before sir. Peach is always a hero in some other cases so

241
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,160
whatever anyway so super princess peach it's okay I check it out if the genre

242
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,240
interests you but I don't know as a peach fan the something about it's a

243
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,680
little off-putting I can't put my finger on it I'm sorry to say so that was my

244
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:18,000
gaming week Loki how about you I played full auto I finished the game 100% I'm

245
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,880
just giving the last few achievements online I've gotten up on to rank 3 now

246
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,860
online because for some reason it's not counting all the ranked races I'm doing

247
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,400
I raced about six different races today and only counted two of them which

248
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,360
Which ironically enough were the best ones I did, so that worked out in my favor.

249
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,860
But still though, I spent all that time to play people and they freaking drop like mad.

250
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,480
It's crazy, it's like Mario Kart but worse.

251
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,320
Still really fun though, and you get to play in some of the races.

252
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,480
I found my strategy though was the same during the multiplayer games as in my single player

253
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,860
games where I drop a lot of bombs behind me and just get ahead of the pack and I just

254
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,180
take people out as I'm driving.

255
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,180
And it worked really well.

256
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,180
in the first place that way.

257
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,220
But the game is really fun.

258
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,620
Really frustrating in the gang war section of the game, but I finally got gold on those

259
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,800
and once I was done with that I was like, finally, really rewarding.

260
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,980
Other than that, I've been trying to get into some more of the Xbox Live Arcade games, played

261
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:32,360
a little bit more, Hexic HD, trying to actually become good at that game, but I can't.

262
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:39,540
trade gauntlet and suck at gauntlet still and then I'm looking forward to burnout which is coming out this week and

263
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,300
Also goes to recon advanced warfighter. So two more the start off

264
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,120
I'm glad I finished full auto because you know, I have to start burnout, you know, I'm a burnout whore

265
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,840
So isn't burnout out this week. It comes out in the seventh. I think or not the seventh

266
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,720
7th or 8th, I can't remember. Okay, that's this week. It is this week. Yeah, very exciting

267
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,640
So all right, I'm speaking of gauntlet since you brought up gauntlet in there. I'm gonna go to our chat room now. Finally. Sorry chat room

268
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,640
I'm not ignoring you guys. I know you're there

269
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,200
www.orangelawntrader.com click on chat. I'm not don't don't you lies spreading lies?

270
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
emotionally unstable woman

271
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,160
Who touched the fire heart who touched it

272
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
All right moving on

273
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,160
Let's see Oh check question from chair room hit stun says does gauntlet have online play. Yes

274
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,060
Yes, and that is pretty much what makes pretty much much

275
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,660
It is what mucho makes these games worthwhile on Xbox Live. Otherwise, I would say

276
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,840
Frickin go get Midway arcade classics. It's got every single game

277
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,100
They're offering on live and if but but the online play is what makes these worth the five bucks a pop

278
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
It's sometimes hard to find an opponent

279
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,960
but it's fun you know and that's the only way that gauntlet remains fun after

280
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,640
the first few levels for me honestly is to have four people playing it so

281
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,180
definitely you know if you're you want to get it back in the gauntlet check it

282
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:16,320
out on xbox live because you can do the co-op thing so pretty exciting if you

283
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,760
guys want to participate www.orangelawnsradio.com click on chat and of course

284
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,160
You guys are always free to disagree with us DMN says I disagree with your opinion on peach sky

285
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,100
Well, that's you know, and you know what my opinion might change

286
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,540
I've changed my opinion on games when I go back and play them for a longer time as I'm sure some of you guys have

287
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,220
Done as well as that sometimes like it you could the CD a movie you watch it

288
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,980
Listen to it the first time and you think this sucks and go back later and it's actually really good

289
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,860
Same thing happen was games all the time. So, you know, I reserve the right to change my opinion

290
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,700
Nothing is ever cemented, but I don't know. I don't I can't see my opinion changing on this, but we'll see. We'll see

291
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:01,620
huh, I have to say something about katsu khan which is where I went part of my trip where I was at I did a

292
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,180
Panel there on Bamani games. I was placed Sunday at 11 a.m

293
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:11,620
I had a I could count on my hands how many people showed up to my panel and that made me kind of sad

294
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,140
Which is more listeners than we had the first week of this show

295
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,900
So that's okay, but and they were all fans of the podcast which was kind of cool

296
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,180
You know like meet some of our listeners pretty awesome. Yeah

297
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:27,700
But the problem was is that they put my panel right before the checkout time at the hotel

298
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,860
So everybody was trying to frantically check out of their rooms and figure out whether we're gonna put their luggage for the rest of the day

299
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,420
So nobody really came to my panel which made me a sad panda. Oh, well, maybe next night

300
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,820
We are thinking about going to other cons and stuff. So if you have suggestions

301
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,340
Um, we can't go to everything, but if you, you know, especially California based stuff,

302
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,140
we can certainly try and make an attempt at going to, and I know we've got ideas of our

303
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,940
own, so we'll see what happens.

304
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,980
Um, big thanks to those of you guys who did stop by and say hi at Katsucon.

305
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,360
Also a big, huge thank you to the listener who, um, hooked me up with a Wonderswan color.

306
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
That was so awesome.

307
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Did I tell you about that?

308
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
I got a Wonderswan color.

309
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
That's really cool.

310
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
And I love Final Fantasy IV.

311
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,140
So, that's so badass.

312
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
I love the Wonderswan color.

313
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,140
And you already know I love Final Fantasy IV.

314
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,140
I don't gotta tell you again.

315
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,140
So.

316
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:16,740
Alright anyway moving on let's get into this week's news starting off with Loki Loki

317
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,780
You got this you've got the hookup or something this week. Don't you look you what's up?

318
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,260
Destination PlayStation. This is a retail only event that means no press but being that I work in retail

319
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,100
We did get the hookup

320
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,420
I actually got the PowerPoint presentations of a few different companies that we're gonna be there

321
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,360
I'm showing off their games and we got a bunch of different titles as I mentioned last week

322
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:46,500
Um, we did have some stuff, uh, regarding the, uh, Activision, and now I have, um, the

323
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,860
Vivendi Universal titles that are going to be coming out this year, and a lot of this

324
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,820
stuff hasn't been announced yet, so it's going to be kind of cool, including, um, some of

325
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,740
the Revolution games that are going to be coming out at launch.

326
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,100
Um, but let me just run down the list here of some of the really cool stuff.

327
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,540
Just so you guys know, I, he's actually, and I know this is radio, so you can't, he's actually

328
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,200
looking at a PowerPoint that I'm sure is not supposed to be looked at by us right now,

329
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,260
but it shows.

330
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,480
It's a freaking calendar that just shows.

331
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,740
It looks very official, boys and girls.

332
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,740
This is great.

333
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,740
This is so cool.

334
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,220
Anyways, this is the exact PowerPoint that they're showing at Destination PlayStation,

335
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,220
which is awesome.

336
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:29,640
But starting off here, we're upcoming this second quarter, we've got Over the Hedge and

337
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,280
X-Men 3, which is no surprise, two games based on upcoming movies.

338
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,160
July or the July through September third quarter we've got the movies x-pack

339
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,460
which is coming out for the PC and expansion to the movies no way I notice

340
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,760
something here okay take x3 for example I see it's bolded and then I see the

341
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,840
legend at the bottom says bold xbox 360 ps3 and or Nintendo I guess an army

342
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,680
center revolution so when it's bolded in April May June is that like hinting is

343
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,440
that just gonna be it means that there's probably an xbox 360 version for x-men

344
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,200
I see because I get look at that goat does that mean we're gonna have like a

345
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No, no, I didn't think so

346
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,520
July or quarter three we've got um

347
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,120
Like I said the movies x-pack for PC quake enemy territory for the PC as well as a couple budget tiles

348
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,280
they have Kabbalah's Alaskan adventures for both consoles and PC and

349
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,400
Let's see here. Also for quarter four, of course is gonna be the biggest stuff

350
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,020
You've got I see lots of bolded stuff here. So that's the bold stuff

351
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,480
So this must mean the other consoles are they're expecting them to be well, here's where we're going here

352
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,600
we've got actual launch stuff. This is the new Tony Hawk game, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam,

353
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,400
which is going to be one of the launch titles for the Revolution and for the PS3. We've

354
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,120
got also Marvel Legends, which is going to be kind of a follow-up to the X-Men Legends

355
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,480
series. That's also going to be a launch title for the Revolution and for the PS3.

356
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,320
But when you say launch, couldn't that mean that maybe it doesn't come out like the same week?

357
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,200
it might come out around... It might not come out, it's not gonna come out, well like the

358
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,000
Revolution's slated for around November, so it probably will be a launch title for that.

359
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,220
The PS3, God knows, you know, when that's coming out, so hopefully. Call of Duty 3 is

360
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,680
gonna be another title that's coming out on the Playstation 3, and for the 360, which

361
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,000
is gonna be pretty cool. Call of Duty, also, they're gonna be getting a new version for

362
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,720
the PSP, as well as Gun is coming to the PSP. Chirp Chirp. Hey, Call of Duty is awesome,

363
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,760
okay? No, no, Call of Duty is fine, you just said

364
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,640
Gun and I just, you know. Oh yeah, Gun, yeah. Well, this is the best

365
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,360
one, this one I had to laugh at. I'm going to bargain beneath you.

366
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,340
Okay, these are the bargain titles here. The History Channel presents the Civil War first

367
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:47,240
person shooter, I might add. So, I don't know exactly how that would work,

368
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,480
I know it takes a long ass time to reload first person. Are you for this shit's fake that out of me

369
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,120
They know that it's better than we have to let me tell you switch. It was supposed to come out last year

370
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,660
I have the sell sheets for this. It looks like the

371
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,520
Biggest piece of crap I've ever seen but it's a budget title

372
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,040
It's it's weird. It's really bad Harley Davison. They're also doing another

373
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,840
Bike game. I mean, come on they had you know

374
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,660
American choppers the game so of course is

375
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:20,740
this one really got me laughing pimp my ride the game kill me which you know I

376
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,220
thought le rush was pimp my ride the game but whatever that's coming out in

377
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,380
consoles and kabbalahs african safari you know sadly enough people buy those

378
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:35,800
kabbalahs games a lot but yeah and some other games I should mention for the DS

379
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,420
spider-man kids I don't know what the hell that is and yeah it just a lot of

380
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:47,340
really bad games. Okay, so that's everything for, I don't know, Civil War First First Shooter.

381
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,140
You kind of have my interest now. I mean, it kind of sounds like one of those you gotta

382
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,180
see it to believe it type things. I can't be the only one who's interested in a very

383
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:05,660
showgirls kind of way. Now for Vividi Universal we've got 50 Cent. 50 Cent's coming out on

384
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,860
the PSP in fourth quarter. You know, because a year later and the game's still gonna suck.

385
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:16,140
Crash Festival, a Crash Bandicoot game for the DS, will be coming out also, 4th quarter.

386
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,420
I wondered what ever happened to Crash Bandicoot.

387
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,620
They still make games for that stuff.

388
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,700
You know the last one I ever played with Crash Bandicoot was the little party game they had

389
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,980
on the Playstation.

390
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,060
Like their answer to Mario Party.

391
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,060
Crash Bash?

392
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,060
Yeah, Crash Bash.

393
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,060
What a crap.

394
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,060
What a crap that game was.

395
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
I'm sorry.

396
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,180
That was like the worst knockoff game I'd ever seen in my life.

397
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,200
I got a game coming out called Aragon, which is going to be based on a movie that's coming

398
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:46,960
out around the same time, quarter four, also on the 360 and all the console systems.

399
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,720
Actually it's pretty sweet, they've got John Malkovich's in it, it looks like he plays

400
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,240
like a troll or something, I don't know, that's kind of neat.

401
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,400
But it's definitely going to be a lot better than In the Name of the King, an Ui Bo crap

402
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,360
fest.

403
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's see, of course a bunch of other movie tie-ins here, Miami Vice, of course with the

404
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,060
movie that's coming out you know also a console game moving on Scarface coming

405
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,220
out in September that one actually looks pretty sweet because it's kind of you

406
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:20,660
know my it's like Vice City but actually you know without ripping off Scarface

407
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,660
because it is Scarface so it's ripping off a ripoff of itself something like

408
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:31,740
that that's kind of neat okay flat out to one of my you know kind of favorite

409
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,660
games that came out a while ago where you get to eject the driver through the

410
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:42,040
Windshield that's coming out now in June so look for that and finally a new Spyro

411
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,160
game coming out around November here Spyro the or Legend of Spyro a new

412
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,000
beginning and that's coming out in all the systems in October actually. See I

413
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,220
always thought Crash and Spyro like ran away together to the land of

414
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:01,640
oversaturation and made like a million babies or something. Yeah I don't know

415
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,260
And then then there's another crappy game here called mock which is for the PSP and it looks like crap some

416
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,860
Air pollution like airplane if you like airplane combat game boom-boom shoot them up top gun

417
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,860
But uh, oh and I forgot I had EA's lineup to just real quick though

418
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
There's only a couple that are worth mentioning

419
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:28,080
There anytime soon Superman Returns coming out in June June 26 currently and Laura be based on the Superman 64 engine

420
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,100
No, it will not be. Actually, you know what? I have seen the video for this. They released

421
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,840
a trailer for it and it actually looks really good. It's going to have 80 square miles of

422
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,720
metropolis that you get to fly around in with all the buildings and everything. Really cool

423
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,240
and they've got Metallo in there, giant robot you get to fight and stuff. I don't know.

424
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,020
And then Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth 2 for Xbox 360, 10 of the league right

425
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,200
now for June 13th.

426
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,700
speaking of the land of oversaturation

427
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,200
now now

428
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,640
sorry i've been gone for a couple weeks i'm a little feisty tonight

429
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,320
that that's all we got so far i'm still waiting to get back from uh...

430
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,360
cuz a lot of people right now destination playstation you know was

431
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,780
taking place this week and a lot of people are still busy

432
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,720
i'll get some more info later on

433
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,480
you know dark tetsuya has an interesting point about the uh... civil war uh...

434
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,800
first-person shooter

435
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,680
if that is historically accurate then you will be spending more time reloading

436
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,480
than firing exactly like that

437
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,440
they'd like to do you remember like seeing this industry class like with

438
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,680
the power back in the gun to take forever

439
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,300
and all that stuff

440
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,340
make for some mean online play

441
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,360
you think about that you have a fifteen minute match you can only fire fifteen

442
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,440
shots

443
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,320
to make those count

444
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,780
moving on uh... line i'd notice i was gone

445
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,100
people got really freaked out about this Microsoft origami

446
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,300
like you know up here it is Microsoft sent entering the handheld market

447
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,180
here it is the origami is their answer to the PSP and the DS right

448
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,260
here here's my thing okay what about the origami the origami is a stupid name

449
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,220
you know I'm sorry

450
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,340
because it makes me want to fold it and you don't do that you don't fold

451
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,620
a Microsoft equipment here's the thing about the origami though it reminds me

452
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,260
of like

453
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,460
how cell phones are you know cell phones now

454
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,180
teeny tiny just like you know the gameboy micro teeny tiny you know the psp not so tiny but still

455
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:31,260
pretty tiny origami is like cell phones from the 80s where it's like you know some ginormous device

456
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,540
which i'd expect they should have called it the microsoft brick because that's what it looks like

457
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:42,220
it looks like a brick in the sense that i can possibly you know haul that with me you know i

458
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:47,300
I can't stick it in a pocket unless I'm like five billion pounds and have pants the size

459
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,900
of a parachute or something.

460
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,820
The Microsoft Doorstop, now with Halo.

461
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,020
By the way, it doesn't play Halo.

462
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,020
Here it is kids, here it is.

463
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:05,340
Now the word's coming out that it is not actually their answer to the PSP or DS, so sit down,

464
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:11,460
because what this is is actually it is their first in a line of paperback sized computers.

465
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,660
So what the hell was the Halo thing?

466
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,940
It was running Halo on Windows XP, is what they say, because it's like a portable computer.

467
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

468
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
Paperback size.

469
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,820
Okay, I know what the size of a paperback book is, okay, if this thing is like the paperback

470
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:30,340
size of like a phone book, I mean, apparently the paperback in question is War and Peace,

471
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,900
apparently.

472
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,380
I don't know.

473
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,260
I guess, but see- The Bible.

474
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,500
with like with with with the Book of Mormon as the AC adapter or something I

475
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,380
mean you know it's the size of the unabridged dictionary all right anyway

476
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:53,180
all kidding aside okay so Microsoft's gonna have this tiny and I use that term

477
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,020
very loosely tiny computer coming out soon called the origami but you know you

478
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:04,160
know I people are saying it's not a handheld but could correct me if I'm

479
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,600
wrong if the damn thing hooks up to all of Microsoft's other stuff, couldn't you theoretically

480
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,280
get some perks as an origami owner such as maybe Xbox 360 demos, movies on your origami?

481
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,520
Couldn't that still be something that's an option?

482
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,240
Oh, of course you earned the reticle of all your friends.

483
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
This made me laugh.

484
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,880
Okay, Game Informer is trying to guess what you could use the origami for and one of the

485
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,680
things they said is a secondary screen for your 360.

486
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,160
I'm like yeah, I'm gonna go out there and spend $500 on a crappy little screen

487
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,420
For that could possibly be used in the game is like a status screen or something like a DS

488
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,720
No, I'll tell you what the origami can be used for oh shit. I got a crooked nail

489
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
You killed the penguin

490
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,000
People out in the living room we're probably going what the hell are they doing on this show tonight alright anyway

491
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,780
What aren't we doing you know what if someone could be bludgeoned to death with an iPod man that that origami is

492
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Give me some deadly stuff there

493
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,200
Well you know since you pissed off enough Mac users

494
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,360
We've got a you know we'll get the hate mail for Microsoft fans this week. It's just you know turnabouts fairplay

495
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,360
Right you know that's the thing as seriously as like the size of like one of those old speaking all right

496
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,720
Let's move on moving on

497
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
dark Sakura

498
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,980
Something that you might be able to play on the Microsoft origami world of war crack

499
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:32,420
There's that there is that it actually are up to six million woohoo

500
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:40,700
But yeah as a result they're working on a Spanish version of World of Warcraft in

501
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,340
Addition to what's the other three languages they have out of in Europe right now. Yeah, so

502
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,220
We get the Spanish version

503
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:59,460
L computer es en fuego. Lucha libre on Telemundo. You know, when I play World of Warcraft on

504
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:05,940
my iBook, it does feel like, you know, it's en fuego. You know what, that's actually all

505
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:12,580
of the Spanish I know is el telefono es en fuego. And lucha libre on Telemundo. I just,

506
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,420
donde esta el bano. Because it's all about Mexican wrestling. Donde esta el bano, that's

507
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,420
That's all you need to know.

508
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
If you're gonna go to Mexico.

509
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,420
Where's the potty?

510
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,420
Yeah.

511
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Oh.

512
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,420
You got it!

513
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
See?

514
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,420
You know what?

515
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
You know more Spanish.

516
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,420
You're lying.

517
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
Okay, I know Latin, and I took French.

518
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
Just unstable tonight.

519
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,420
Totally unstable.

520
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
Shut up!

521
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,420
Okay, you know what?

522
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,420
Kisses.

523
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,420
All right.

524
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
Yeah, right.

525
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,420
You know what?

526
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
I'm sorry, I'm feisty tonight.

527
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,420
Maybe I'm the emotionally unstable one.

528
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,420
It's fine.

529
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,420
Loki, you also have a wow story.

530
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:43,380
Yes, this is how you can become a part of the beta for the World of Warcraft Burning

531
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,380
Crusade.

532
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,380
And no, that's not an STD.

533
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,220
They have three different things that are going to be going on.

534
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:53,900
The first is a race to level 50 contest, and that's basically just like it sounds.

535
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:59,280
You take a new character and see how quickly you can get to level 50, and hopefully the

536
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,020
top 1,000 will secure the right to be able to be part of the beta.

537
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:12,100
The second competition is called the Battle for Warsong Gulch, and it's basically a level

538
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:22,600
19 capped battle and yeah the top 500 players for that are going to be able to be part of

539
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:30,220
the beta for that and finally the most level 25 characters contest and just like it sounds

540
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:35,580
the top 1000 people who can get the most characters that are level 25 and above get to also be

541
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,300
part of the beta.

542
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,660
So in other words if you don't have a job and you have a lot of time to spare here's

543
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,460
something you can work towards to make your internet penis take your leave I

544
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,180
mean look at that though it's perfectly you know you have people that can level

545
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,700
their characters quickly now we can test a lot of stuff for this you know beta

546
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:59,140
and it makes sense you don't want people that can actually play the game they're

547
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:05,060
encouraging people to not have a life anyway whatever I just found a reason to

548
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,140
take my vacation time I'm happy nerd all right moving on I also have a wow story

549
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,560
those you got you know how the rumors are going around that the World of

550
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:20,580
Warcraft is going to come out on the Xbox 360 not not so even though Squeenix

551
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:26,780
is bringing over Final Fantasy 11 to the 360 MCV the Interactive Entertainment

552
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:33,700
Weekly is and saying that the Blizzard chief operating officer Paul Sam said we

553
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,820
do not have any plans to take Wow to Xbox 360 Wow is a is built as a PC

554
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,140
gaming experience, porting PC games to console often compromises games and we

555
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:50,660
would never allow the WoW gameplay experience to suffer so and doesn't

556
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:56,340
sound like it's gonna happen. To counter that, according to the VOIP blog World of Warcraft is

557
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,580
indeed going to debut on the 360 this is of course coming about a day after they

558
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,180
announced that it wasn't and apparently the whole thing is they're going to

559
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,380
announce some sort of secret partnership at E3 and of course that sounds like a

560
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:16,000
bunch of fan-based speculation to me with all due respect to that blog in

561
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,180
question hmm blog chief operating officer of blizzard it's hard to say

562
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,280
which one's more believable but you know it's not like these guys I'm gonna go

563
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,620
with blog it's not like these guys haven't lied before to the blog's credit

564
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:32,100
they could totally make a 180 on this statement and we would just look like

565
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:41,100
asses again moving on new story Loki we were talking about gauntlet on Xbox Live

566
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,180
Arcade the funny done yet right of course not there's gonna be some more

567
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,180
Midway games coming to the Xbox Live Arcade one of my favorites paper boy

568
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,820
paper boy is coming of course and root beer tapper that's gonna be really good

569
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,700
I own it that game it's on but we're tapping is not really to player it's not

570
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,580
two-player co-op, so I don't think they're going to have to get creative with that one

571
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,900
to make that a worthwhile purchase.

572
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,100
Same thing with Paperboy, they weren't really, you know, the enticing thing about the Midway

573
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:13,100
games is that they're co-op and stuff, but those games aren't really multiplayer at once.

574
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,760
Defender is also coming.

575
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,860
Some other stuff that will be heading our way is going to be Cyberball, some sort of

576
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,140
robot football game that was kind of crap.

577
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:31,100
And then finally of course the best one, Mortal Kombat 3, or Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is going

578
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,500
to be coming to combat, of course, Street Fighter 2.

579
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,420
Why Mortal Kombat 3, which I would say is the worst one in the entire series, sorry,

580
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,540
I even prefer Mortal Kombat 4 over Mortal Kombat 3.

581
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,420
Mortal Kombat 2 is the top of the series.

582
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,660
I know, Mortal Kombat 2 is the top, I don't think there's any dispute in that, but I even

583
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,820
prefer, and I know like people totally disagree, I prefer Mortal Kombat 4 to 3, I did not like

584
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,820
3 at all.

585
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,820
It just...

586
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,020
the beta versions of Mortal Kombat 2

587
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,940
Mortal Kombat 2 is awesome. Why three? Why are they coming out with three? Why not two?

588
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,060
People want two

589
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,380
I don't know. Be glad you're getting

590
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,180
any Mortal Kombat. No, I will not. I'm not spending five dollars on Mortal Kombat 3

591
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,780
especially especially when I already have

592
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,980
arcade legends. Who says it's going to be five dollars? Watch when Street Fighter 2 comes out

593
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,140
I bet you it'll probably be like ten bucks. F that

594
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,860
pretty soon you'll be paying like for forty dollar games online

595
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,300
moving on

596
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,540
Dark Sakura has a story

597
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,100
about parents and video games and all that fun stuff

598
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:40,180
what's up? parents and video games well

599
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,340
video games worst

600
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,620
enemy is lazy parents

601
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,460
how many times have I said this? I know I'm kinda like

602
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,980
even when I was like looking over this week's story I was kinda like this is news

603
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,500
but you know it's it's nice to see that the media is kind of you know

604
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,520
acknowledging that

605
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,980
it's not always you know doom and gloom

606
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,220
the gamers fault and the the you know it

607
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,420
everybody is equally to blame sometimes

608
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,660
I don't know well there's

609
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:16,140
this legislation going into actually

610
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,860
and this is actually something else I was a reading on a number of sites

611
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:25,280
there's actually new legislation to have the game ratings redone which is

612
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,640
actually pretty stupid a lot of people are protesting it well I think it's okay

613
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,180
if they want to do it like I like we've suggested on this program before and I

614
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:38,700
think is the way they do it in the UK in UK oh oh yeah in the UK it's fine

615
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,700
doesn't it mirror the movies it does but there's a change that one of the Labour

616
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,660
Party folks is trying is lobbying to to change it why would you change it when I

617
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,060
I think that's the way that makes the most sense is to mirror the movies

618
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,700
because people understand movie ratings they don't understand for whatever

619
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,940
reason they don't understand game ratings but they understand pg-13 okay

620
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,700
are might have titties don't take the kids well well now they're having this

621
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:09,220
mum's army business over there as mama's and mother I what with what little I

622
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:16,700
know of British culture I do know that one but they're saying that the games

623
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,540
responsible for all kinds of social problems like drug and alcohol abuse, gang

624
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:33,580
membership, and gangster rap. Dude, I'm gonna play some Katamari Dimashio. But

625
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:41,340
seriously, there was, you know, there's actually an interesting comment on here

626
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:45,820
that's a political movement launched by the same people who show a story of a

627
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:52,820
a woman crippled by 40 to 60 orgasms a day. How can that be credible? That's like...

628
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,140
It's kind of awesome. That's like reading the sun or something,

629
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,940
you know, or like the enquirer. Alright, well...

630
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,960
But they're saying that video games, which to quote glorify, pimping drug dealing and

631
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,980
street murders, but they don't make a logical connection to trying to control what their

632
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,460
children are playing basically they're blaming the games not blaming themselves

633
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:22,420
for taking responsibility for what their children are doing excuse me we've been

634
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,980
doing this show for four years and didn't I see that from like well not

635
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,660
quite day one but sort of around you know the first year I started my whole

636
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,300
campaign against parents doing their freaking job that's what makes this news

637
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:40,060
is that finally you know there's you know anyway it's ridiculous it really is

638
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,340
ridiculous and honestly I feel like writing them and going um why don't you

639
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,540
just try parenting your children moving on we do now on the flip side we have a

640
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:53,140
we have a good piece about parenting and stuff later so please you know if you're

641
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,740
gonna send hate mail right now wait because we have another story coming up

642
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,460
I've fully gone on and said for those for those of you parents who are taking

643
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,360
an active partner you know I it's a partnership it you know they have

644
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,860
responsibility to put the information out there and market it correctly but

645
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,100
the parents have the responsibility to take that information and use it wisely.

646
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:18,060
There you go. Something that may not be so wise I caught this like it's a little

647
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,820
it's a little little piece on Kotaku this week little piece and that's about

648
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,860
all the engage deserves in fact I thought the engage was dead and gone but

649
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:31,900
no civilization just recently came out on the engage like this week and I seem

650
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:37,460
to remember playing this at E3 last year I got so frustrated civilization is

651
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,960
probably my favorite computer game of all time and granted I think this one's

652
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,920
based off of Civ 2, the Civ 2 engine, I got frustrated after like two minutes I

653
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,200
couldn't I could not stand I was like what happened to my game what why why

654
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,360
god why I was like crying in the middle of the Engage booth I had to be removed

655
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,140
but anyway if you're a Civ fan and you happen to own an Engage or you need a

656
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,720
reason to you know keep your Engage or need something on you I guess here it is

657
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:11,280
civilization finally out enjoy and then you know kick your engage because it's

658
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:20,080
you know not that great moving on Loki yes interesting story actually coming

659
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:26,800
out about the Sims and basically EA and Depeche Mode have collaborated on a

660
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,720
signature song for Sims 2 open for business and it's actually funny because

661
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:42,280
Because this song playing, or I guess the first ever Simlish language song, Suffer Well,

662
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,280
a popular track by Depeche Mode, will be in the game.

663
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,160
And I don't know how you can listen to Depeche Mode in that weird language.

664
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,160
That's just weird.

665
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,160
That's unusual.

666
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,280
I don't know.

667
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,480
That's a weird pairing to me.

668
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,120
Depeche Mode in The Sims.

669
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,120
I don't know.

670
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:06,220
worked for the Black Eyed Peas but okay Depeche Mode Black Eyed Peas not quite the same

671
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:10,320
type of band it might have worked better if they picked a good Depeche Mode song

672
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,360
yeah I know but there haven't been any good Depeche Mode songs in the past 10

673
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:22,480
years now my question is the last album was really freaking good okay now my

674
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:37,600
My question is, is this song for like, since this is basically the storefront Sims expansion,

675
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,540
is this for like the Hot Topic type of story that's going to be in the game where you get

676
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,320
to, I don't know, I've got nothing.

677
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,000
I find it interesting because I remember the Black Eyed Peas did a Simlish song for the

678
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,220
the Herbs Games, and I don't recall that having any great success. I'm curious why they would

679
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,220
try this sort of thing again."

680
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,220
Because Depeche Mode is like,

681
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,220
Oh, last album sucks so bad! Please someone listen to it!

682
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,220
Alright,

683
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:12,220
let's let Jamie have a witty retort here at this time with

684
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,220
her website of the week! Yay, we love Jamie's website of the week!

685
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,220
My website of the week? Hey, I was trying to make

686
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:24,220
a comment before you started that. It's just especially significant.

687
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:36,380
today's website of the week is the website for warp 11 because they rock

688
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:43,620
if you go to warp 11.com and it's the numbers 11 not like spelled out this is

689
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:49,540
basically a Star Trek themed band I went to see this last night at the blue lamp

690
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:54,060
and downtown Sacramento and they're just so awesome because their songs are all

691
00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:02,060
about sex and Star Trek except for the wait a minute those are two things that

692
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:07,900
I never would have imagined ever went together and drugs Wow

693
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:14,060
there's actually I think a song that's just about various drugs in Star Trek

694
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:19,460
And, of course, they did the best, my favorite of their songs, they did Montalban.

695
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:23,700
Have you ever seen that old Saturday Night Live sketch with William Shatner going to

696
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,300
the Star Trek convention and he goes, Hey, you, in the back, have you ever gotten laid?

697
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,300
Remember that?

698
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,300
Hilarious.

699
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,300
Sorry.

700
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,300
Sorry.

701
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,700
I didn't mean to intrude on the website.

702
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,820
Check bands get laid with each other.

703
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,900
But this band is also really, I don't know.

704
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,900
I'm a closet Trekkie.

705
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,620
Well, here we go.

706
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,620
I will make you feel better.

707
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,620
Okay?

708
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,620
I'm going to, because I've been pretty harsh tonight.

709
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,220
I'm going to give you the greatest blackmail ammo of all time.

710
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,560
Are you ready?

711
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,660
In high school, senior year, I was vice president of the Star Trek club.

712
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,660
Checky!

713
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,660
There you go.

714
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,660
Do you feel better?

715
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,660
I feel somewhat better.

716
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,660
Alright.

717
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,940
But um, but no, just like freaking go look at the, on the link for music.

718
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,580
It has the lyrics to Montalban up there.

719
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,580
It's like the best lyrics ever.

720
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:18,140
there's also mp3 samples on the site which you know we should we'll play

721
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,940
eventually I actually on my show I play a lot of warp 11 anyway because I love

722
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:28,140
warp 11 and I think that off of their most recent album which is called a

723
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:34,160
boldly go down on me welcome to our cube is probably my favorite song that one

724
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,540
and captain caught me on the holodeck red alert is also a really good album

725
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:46,560
just because of seven of mine it's it's such a such a really really cool band I

726
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,860
will say this and to kind of bring it back to gaming a little bit also in

727
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,100
Trekkies too all right the movie right to bring it back to gaming a little bit

728
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:57,860
I do think that Star Trek MMO is a pretty good idea I think that'll I think

729
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,740
that'll be great so we'll see one more one more details come out I think it'll

730
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,760
be pretty cool one other thing I'd like though to point out about the site

731
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,280
people everyone should go to the photos look at the Halloween photos with them

732
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:15,900
dressed as Star Wars characters all right dark soccer's website of the week

733
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,780
enjoy moving on this is this this article has kind of been floating around

734
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,220
the internet for a couple weeks keep in mind we haven't done a show in a couple

735
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,500
weeks so we have to catch up on a couple things that we missed but this was run

736
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,660
on MSNBC newsweek this is interesting there's a game coming out it's called

737
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:39,100
Left Behind Eternal Forces. Left Behind is this book series of I guess they're

738
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,540
Christian oriented books about what the rapture and the people to get left

739
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:47,260
behind right. So basically what happens is that it's supposed to be taking place

740
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:51,480
in Manhattan but the level of violence is supposed to be reminiscent of Grand

741
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,360
Theft Auto according to this story. It's about New Yorkers who are left behind

742
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:04,960
behind after the rapture, they scour the streets for converts, train people to be a workforce

743
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,120
to feed, shelter, and join the resistance against the growing forces of the antichrist,

744
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,540
is what this game is all about.

745
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,560
Which meets with a resounding, okay?

746
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,720
Yeah, but it sounds like I had that thought up.

747
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,080
I don't know, it's just kind of like, oh really?

748
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:25,120
It sounds like GTA meets Shin Megami Tensei, I'm almost interested.

749
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,520
Here's the part about getting the hooker in the car and then killing her, I mean, where's

750
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,520
that?

751
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,680
If this game does not have a sex mini-game that was removed from the game but still left

752
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,640
in the programming, I will not buy it.

753
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,160
Instead of hot coffee, it's hot manna.

754
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,560
Hopefully this game will be less boring than the movie.

755
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:52,360
And yes, I have watched the movie, and god, I want those two hours back.

756
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:57,360
Speaking of stories that are a little bit old, but we want to bring them to your attention

757
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,360
anyway.

758
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,360
Loki?

759
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:05,840
Anyways, there is a little bit of news going around, I wouldn't really call this news.

760
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,740
The EA Sports Games for PSP, in order to play online, you have to do one of two things.

761
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:19,940
You have to either sign over your privacy to EA and I believe ESPN to have them send

762
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:28,040
you spam or pay them $2 and so yeah this has been going on basically brought to

763
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,600
attention again with the release of fight night round three but this is

764
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:38,960
something that's going on since you know so what's to stop me from going to get a

765
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,160
free gmail account because I know thousands of people with thousands of

766
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,320
invites to gmail even though it's still in beta what's to stop me from getting a

767
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:52,540
free gmail account and having it be my spam dump ground and signing up with

768
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:58,820
this address listen it's all about the principle here sure it'd be really easy

769
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:03,380
to do that and sure and probably lots of people have done that ensure even the

770
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,300
people that have put the legitimate information haven't gotten anything sent

771
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:11,380
to them but yeah it's about the principle it's a principle the thing

772
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,860
it's like you know two dollars or my email address it's like sell your soul

773
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:19,060
to the marketing, sell your soul to the band is essentially what they're saying or buy

774
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,060
it back for two dollars.

775
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:24,060
Well the whole thing it comes down to is this isn't something that's like on the box you

776
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:29,520
know and it's kind of to hide that in there saying oh yeah by the way if you want to play

777
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:37,860
online you got to pay us two bucks you know that's kind of not good, shady, shady.

778
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,940
You know what it's just like releasing, re-releasing games onto the 360 without really doing much

779
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,860
other than enhancing the textures a little bit. Yeah, we see you, you know, with Burnout

780
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:54,860
and, you know, for that, EA's gonna get left behind. Battlefield 2, Gun, all those, half

781
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:04,580
the 360 games out there. But really, the bigger question is, why are you buying these sports

782
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,760
games anyways? No one plays sports games out there. Because there's a huge, don't you know

783
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,740
like some of the most successful titles over here are sports games? We don't talk about

784
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,700
them so much. There were huge audiences. Well like some of the other titles they mentioned

785
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:21,100
were like NHL, you know, 2006. I'm like, who plays hockey games? I mean really. Hey,

786
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:27,020
Blades of Steel was like one of my favorite NES titles ever, so shut your mouth. Well

787
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:31,580
my favorite thing was how the hell did they have a hockey game anyways when there wasn't

788
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:38,800
a season in 2005. I still like Super Baseball 3000 for the Neo Geo. One of the best things

789
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:47,760
about the Genesis was NHL okay pwned oh I'm sorry pull the Canadian card on me

790
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:53,920
why don't you dark Sakura please take us to a more reasonable time did I mention

791
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,680
we're just a little off tonight we're just kind of something's off I'm always

792
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:03,160
on I'm so all right then get us back on track with a scary with a reasonable

793
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,880
article here oh this is something we brought up earlier yes well um this is

794
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:15,500
about parenting and about video games as in gamer parents which I'm going to be

795
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,760
one day you know in fact I actually wrote a nice little rant not too long

796
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,680
ago about you know gamer parents playing with their their children but there's a

797
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:30,260
lovely little bit of writing out about you know gamer parents and about how you

798
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:35,140
know through them actually taking an active role in you know the games that

799
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:40,140
their children play, you know, they're taking responsibility, they're bringing on a new

800
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:45,260
generation of gamers who have that same healthy attitude, I think.

801
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:53,820
And you know, instead of, you know, leaving it just as a babysitting tool, it's to balance,

802
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:59,980
you know, that's a big theme in this is that parents are using this as a tool to help teach

803
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,580
their children and not as a babysitting device.

804
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:09,620
Some of my fondest memories from being a child, understand that my mother is definitely not

805
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:13,860
a gamer, and she doesn't even really know how to turn a computer on, like if she needed

806
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:18,340
something done on the computer, my dad or myself got asked to do it.

807
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:24,340
Some of the best memories I have of childhood was when she would figure out how to play

808
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:28,020
the trivia games on the Commodore 64 and we'd play them together.

809
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:33,020
You know, it's like board game night, but in a different kind of way.

810
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,260
remember that like very vividly when she would like take the effort to try and

811
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:40,420
like why is Rob so into the computers what I've got the I just remember that

812
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:44,220
and that you know that's great you know I think it's this generation will

813
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:48,500
remember that too back when I had my Nintendo my mom and I used to take turns

814
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:53,260
playing Super Mario Brothers that was also how I developed my blindfold level

815
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:59,220
eight one skill Wow that's hot I can't do it anymore I mean it's been way too

816
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,660
too long since I've done it but level 8 1 there's like a definite pattern to the

817
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,800
whole stage and it is possible to do it blindfolded there's a pattern really to

818
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,500
the whole game right well not if you have not for the hammer brother levels

819
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,620
because they're all random oh that's true their patterns are random but you

820
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:17,640
can do level 8 1 blindfolded you can do the first level blindfolded too huh but

821
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,960
yeah but anyway that's how I you know I've learned that by playing with my mom

822
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:29,200
very cool all right um let's see moving on Loki yes what's going on over at

823
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,440
Konami, our buddies at Konami.

824
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,960
You know, I had to laugh when I read this news about Konami getting in trouble with

825
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:41,080
the crime life advertisement. First off, the advertisement isn't really that bad anyways,

826
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:47,720
it's just people overreacting again. But, anyways, the whole, you know, whole thing

827
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:55,320
about this was that it showed gangsters and, you know, they had guns and stuff, and it's

828
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:00,540
basically trying to promote violence on the streets or something like that.

829
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:09,880
So the ASA, the Advertising Standards Authority, they upheld the complaint against it and wanted

830
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,440
them to pull it.

831
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,480
And so, I don't know, I think it's over just, it's really stupid, because when you look

832
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,520
at it, most of the advertisements that we see nowadays are just nothing.

833
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,920
And I don't think that they really take violence and nudity and stuff like that seriously over

834
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,480
were in the UK, at least not as much as we, I mean, we're just like completely conservative

835
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,120
about everything, you know, whereas they're more liberal about it.

836
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,240
I was gonna say rabid, but, you know.

837
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,360
Shouldn't Konami just write off Crime Life at this point?

838
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,360
I mean, really?

839
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,440
Is this a title they need to be backing?

840
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,440
No.

841
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,960
Is one of those, like, let's pay the rent this month type titles?

842
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,840
Let me put it this way, the game initially was gonna come out at about $49.99, they dropped

843
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,600
it to $20, and then-

844
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,600
That tells you a lot right there.

845
00:57:52,600 --> 00:58:01,480
on it just sucked so it was a nice try but you know just just like Nintendo

846
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:06,640
wrote off the virtual boy I mean a travesty you just got to take your

847
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:12,480
mistakes and say you know what we messed up all right well we've been in a bit of

848
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,040
a feisty mood tonight you know one reason for that is we're really excited

849
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,520
about something as well that's going on here at Orange Lounge radio and to help

850
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,480
us talk about what's going on here at Orange Launch Radio tonight.

851
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,400
We decided to invite on a very special guest.

852
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,560
We always talk about support, independent podcasting, support podcasters.

853
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:37,680
We're here to back up what other folks do out there in the independent podcast revolution.

854
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,520
We would not exist without the support of other folks out there.

855
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,600
And one of the folks that's always been very supportive of our show and we just love him

856
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:49,680
to death is the one and only Bobby Blackwolf from the Bobby Blackwolf show over at AllGames.com

857
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,240
and he's actually on the line with us right now.

858
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,480
Bobby, you there?

859
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,120
Yeah, I am, how are you?

860
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,240
Good, how are you, Bobby?

861
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,080
How was your show tonight?

862
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,140
Good one?

863
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,360
Yeah, it went pretty good.

864
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,400
It's interesting because Bobby and I,

865
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,100
we tape like almost the exact same time,

866
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,560
but it's just because we've done it that way

867
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,380
for a long time, so it just kinda works out that way,

868
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,220
funny sometimes.

869
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,160
But you can download his show as a podcast,

870
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,320
just like you can download ours.

871
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,400
So it allows you to stay in touch with both of them,

872
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,600
so it's awesome. Yep.

873
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,600
All right, so Bobby, tell us first off a little bit

874
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,000
about allgames.com.

875
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,040
What is this website that you're a part of?

876
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,640
Okay, well, it's a sequel to Left Behind.

877
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,640
No, I'm just kidding.

878
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,360
Somebody else is feeling a little feisty tonight.

879
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,360
Sorry.

880
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,360
Yeah.

881
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,000
Allgames.com was started by Scott Rubin about 10 years ago.

882
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,560
A lot of people here may recognize the name Scott Rubin from G4TV.com.

883
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,100
He was the original male host.

884
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:48,840
Before then, he ran the All Games Network, which started off doing radio, a weekly radio

885
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,920
show in Real Audio back in 1996.

886
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:58,120
Then he joined up with Pseudo Online Interactive to do kind of an IPTV network, is what it

887
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:04,300
would be called today, using Real Video, and he oversaw 15 hours worth of gaming content

888
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,300
a week.

889
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,360
A daily live show and all that stuff.

890
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:11,560
That's hardcore because Real Audio and Real Video, like streaming and stuff, that stuff

891
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,880
was a pain in the ass.

892
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,040
I mean, that's what our college radio station used to use.

893
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,040
That stuff was a pain.

894
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,880
So I know that takes a lot of dedication.

895
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,440
Apple made it easy for people to podcast in comparison.

896
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:30,600
Unfortunately, the dot-com bust came out, and All Games Network died pretty much in

897
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,180
the dot-com bust.

898
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,280
And then Comcast brought him over to help start G4.

899
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,760
So he moved out to Los Angeles, started G4, thought that they were going to be taking

900
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:46,000
all these risks with gaming television programming, and unfortunately they just didn't understand.

901
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,680
And in about 2004, he said, okay, their vision is gone.

902
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,720
They're going in a completely different direction.

903
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,720
I want out.

904
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,560
And so he got out, relaunched AllGames.com.

905
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,920
Now he has a production company.

906
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,760
He's developing television, radio, and internet content, all devoted to gaming.

907
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,680
And AllGames Radio is one of those parts.

908
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,680
Awesome.

909
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,840
Now, what's your involvement with all of this then?

910
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,840
Okay.

911
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,900
Well, I've been a fan of Scott Rubin's work.

912
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,920
I've been listening to his stuff and watching his stuff since 97.

913
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,100
and I went over, worked with G4,

914
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,740
I was actually a moderator on their forums,

915
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:23,300
back when G4 actually was good,

916
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,580
which they're not anymore.

917
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,580
Ancient history.

918
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:31,760
And so, when he relaunched allgames.com,

919
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,580
I really kind of was in the right place, right time,

920
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:34,540
I'd been around long enough,

921
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:37,220
and he basically let me help him with his site,

922
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,380
with his forums, and then he had a live 365 station,

923
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,380
I'm like, hey, let me do a show.

924
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:47,740
And I did a show in 2004, and we had the MP3 archives of the show, which is what it was

925
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,740
called.

926
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,820
The podcasting was very new.

927
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:54,620
And now we actually have All Games Radio as a 24-7 music station.

928
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:56,300
I pretty much run it.

929
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:03,100
And we play game music, or we play talk programming, either his show, which is every weeknight,

930
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:08,940
live from the Arena Interactive Lounge in Santa Monica, or my show on Sunday nights.

931
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:12,500
arena interactive lounge sounds pretty awesome because it sounds like a place

932
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,900
where you can just kind of go and like just kind of like kick back have a beer

933
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,860
play some games here Scott over there doing a show sounds pretty awesome wait

934
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,780
I guess you can't really have a beer this is California huh okay have a have

935
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:29,540

936
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:33,060
you bring your own you can have it there okay and they'll store it for you there

937
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:37,420
you go maybe maybe during e3 me and me and Jamie and Lynn Loki will all come

938
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,100
with some Guinness and gamer gave it up right.

939
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,980
It'd be quite expensive on my part.

940
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:46,740
All right, well anyway, so you have a show over on All Games.

941
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,740
What's your show all about?

942
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,660
What's the Bobby Black Wolf show about?

943
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:53,680
It's a one-person show pretty much.

944
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,600
We talk about news, a lot of chatter, we have a toll-free number that you can call in with

945
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,840
Skype and basically just running down the news and I do some interviews.

946
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:08,020
We had Tommy Tallarico on the show last week for about an hour and a half.

947
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,440
We even asked a question from you.

948
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,640
I actually listened to the show.

949
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,320
This was weird for me because we didn't have Orange Lounge Radio last week.

950
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,080
I was kind of like, what am I going to do tonight?

951
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,240
I can't really listen to my own show because there is no show.

952
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,400
I'll go listen to Bobby's show.

953
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,520
I never get a chance to listen to Bobby's show live.

954
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,640
I want to see how it is live versus Tate.

955
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:31,280
He had Tommy Tallarico on and I thought that was kind of crazy because we've been known

956
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,980
to give Tommy a little bit of a hard time here on this program just just a

957
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,480
little bit so it was kind of funny so I you know I had to ask a question and you

958
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,920
know Loki where do you think I went of all the Tommy Tallarico things what do

959
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,200
you think I had to ask about remember what else he's involved in he was

960
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:52,760
involved in a lot of things actually right but the music stuff right video

961
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,920
games live of course so if I had to ask him any question about video games live

962
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,640
What do you think I brought up?

963
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,320
I don't even know.

964
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,000
It was Pong.

965
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,600
I had to ask, why Pong?

966
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,120
Why Pong?

967
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,520
And of course he said, basically his 10 minute answer,

968
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,880
whatever it was, basically boiled down to, dude,

969
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,960
it's eight seconds of Pong.

970
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,600
Basically.

971
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,440
And I understand.

972
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,640
I'm just giving him a hard time, and obviously he does a lot.

973
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,640
He obviously loves games and this industry a whole lot.

974
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,200
He really does.

975
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,880
To my defense, most of my angst at Tommy

976
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,760
was just mainly misdirected angst that should have been going towards G4.

977
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,640
I was like, God damn it, that show sucked.

978
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,480
It's not his fault.

979
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,480
It's the writers.

980
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,280
Do you know what I learned about that show?

981
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,680
I don't know if I should say that.

982
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,600
Let's get back on topic here.

983
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,600
Please.

984
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:45,200
So you have your program and you get some pretty cool interviews once in a while, yeah?

985
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,200
Yep.

986
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,200
Pretty much.

987
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,200
All right.

988
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,200
Give us the details real quick.

989
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,920
How can we tune into your show if we want to hear?

990
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:57,200
It's AllGamesRadio.com that launches the web player, or you can get us on iTunes to search

991
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,560
for Black Wolf.

992
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:02,960
BobbyBlackWolfShow.com is the URL for my show, and that has all the links and everything.

993
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,040
Why, Bobby, do we have you on the show tonight?

994
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:13,840
Is there some type of ulterior motive that we have you on the program tonight?

995
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,560
Go for it, Bobby.

996
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,560
Essentially what we've done...

997
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:21,560
talking with Rob and, you know, to

998
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,580
Dark Soccer and Loki over there. And we have extended an official invitation to

999
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,600
re-air this program you're listening on our stream on Monday nights.

1000
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:33,620
Essentially what will happen is

1001
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:37,640
it's going to air on Monday nights at 10 pm Eastern, 7 pm Pacific,

1002
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:41,660
with Scott Rubins All Games Interactive is going to run right up to it and then people

1003
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,680
will get to listen to both part A and part B of this show

1004
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,240
didn't get to listen on Sunday nights.

1005
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,000
Very cool, and we're very excited to be

1006
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,400
a part of this growing network.

1007
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,760
It's gonna be awesome.

1008
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:53,840
It's very, very cool.

1009
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,520
Thank you so much for thinking of us.

1010
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,200
We really appreciate that, once again,

1011
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,440
because I think you broke up right,

1012
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,940
just a little bit when you were saying the times there.

1013
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,960
It's gonna be at 10 o'clock Eastern time,

1014
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,420
7 p.m. Pacific time on Monday night.

1015
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:07,300
It's the same week show, so like,

1016
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,940
you'll hear tonight's show tomorrow.

1017
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,320
And yes, I believe, Bobby, this is all starting tomorrow.

1018
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,200
Yes?

1019
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,040
Yes, it is.

1020
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:14,860
There it is.

1021
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:19,220
want to hear Part B before we push on the podcast stream, because sometimes we're

1022
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:22,700
lazy and we slack off here at OLR, but all games, they're on it, they've got our Part

1023
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,580
B, they're going to play it Monday nights.

1024
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,580
So you can hear that in advance.

1025
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:32,980
More than anything, we're just kind of excited to be a part of this and kind of work together.

1026
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,740
Independent productions and podcasts and things shouldn't work against each other, they

1027
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:36,740
should work together.

1028
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:39,980
So we're very happy to be on board, Bobby, and thank you so much for thinking of us.

1029
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:46,060
I want to add in one thing just in case people are thinking this right because I did I was at G for

1030
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:52,680
Volunteering when tech TV occurred. We're not changing anything about olr. We don't want to take over your station

1031
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,340
We don't want to change any content or anything

1032
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:58,660
We're just re-airing the same show trying to expand it to a new audience

1033
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:05,080
That's what I love is that and honestly what makes me so like honored is because they they're coming and saying we like what you

1034
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,140
Do as is and I'm like wow

1035
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,140
Wow!

1036
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,140
Somebody likes us.

1037
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,140
No, it's great.

1038
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:11,140
That gives me the warm fuzzies.

1039
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:12,140
I know.

1040
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:13,140
It's nice.

1041
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:14,140
So thank you for giving us the warm fuzzies.

1042
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,780
We love it.

1043
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:19,300
Any other exciting programming coming as well to All Games?

1044
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:24,340
One of the things that we're doing, we're going to be all at GDC in San Jose and we

1045
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:29,560
are actually going to be broadcasting on All Games Radio on the Thursday night of GDC,

1046
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,500
the Game Audio Network Guild Awards, which is going to be a two-hour award show with

1047
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:39,260
live music, live performances, and giving awards for Music of the Year, Audio of the

1048
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:40,260
Year, and all that.

1049
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:44,500
We're going to be backstage there, doing some interviews then, and then Friday night, for

1050
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:50,700
my show, I'm going to be backstage at Video Games Live, asking why Pong, and we'll be

1051
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,780
airing those on my show that weekend.

1052
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,800
That's going to be so awesome.

1053
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,420
I can't believe we're a part of this in a roundabout way.

1054
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:00,820
We're a part of the same station, so that's awesome.

1055
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:01,980
I'm going to be listening to that.

1056
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,020
That's going to be awesome.

1057
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:07,340
What else is in store in the future of allgames.com?

1058
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:11,120
Not necessarily just programming, but what's in store for the website, the whole vision

1059
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,120
of all games?

1060
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,100
Well, we're going to be adding some other podcasts.

1061
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,540
We've approached other independent podcasters.

1062
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,060
You all are just the first.

1063
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:25,940
We're going to be putting a lot more podcasts on just so people can find new podcasts.

1064
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:29,460
Scott Rubin does a lot of television production.

1065
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:33,900
We've got a short film done by a man named Michael Hyland called As Real As Your Life.

1066
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:37,800
It was premiered at the TED conference during David Perry's.

1067
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,220
It's going to be screened at GDC, I believe.

1068
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,420
It's about video game addiction.

1069
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:47,060
We're going to take that to film festivals, and there's some television programs, too,

1070
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,140
that we're pitching that we can't talk more about yet.

1071
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,140
Awesome.

1072
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:53,620
And I have to give you the pitch for OLR TV later.

1073
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:54,620
Just remind me.

1074
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,620
Okay.

1075
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:56,620
All right.

1076
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,940
Anyway, no, seriously, though, thank you so much, Bobby.

1077
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:02,900
And please pass along our thanks to Scott as well, we're really excited to be on board

1078
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:09,280
and just kind of get our show out there and be a part of this growing network, it's awesome.

1079
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:12,580
And if anybody listening live, I'm in your chat room and if they want to ask questions

1080
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:17,040
and call them fears or something, they can feel free to see me in there.

1081
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,020
On this end, guys, nothing's changing.

1082
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:22,220
Well, there are other changes coming to OLR, but it has nothing to do with this, it's all

1083
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,180
us that we're changing.

1084
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:28,300
And I guess I'll just go ahead and say it, we're going to be making our station, we're

1085
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,100
We're gonna be putting a little more oomph in our station

1086
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,820
because we ran a poll on Orange Lounge Radio

1087
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,820
and we found you guys want a higher bit rate.

1088
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,540
You want crystal clear Bamani and video game music

1089
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,300
that plays on the stream and the shows.

1090
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,340
So we're gonna be up in the bit rate

1091
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,620
of Orange Lounge Radio later this month.

1092
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,560
So it'll be pretty cool.

1093
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,420
And I'm gonna start wearing pants.

1094
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,500
Thank you for that because we got cited

1095
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,120
by the California health code.

1096
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,020
But anyway, Bobby, thank you so much

1097
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,100
for being on the program tonight

1098
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,220
and best of luck with your show.

1099
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:53,540
And I look forward to working with you guys

1100
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,340
as I'm sure DarkSakura, Loki, and maybe someday

1101
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:00,780
Spike can work with you too, come on your show.

1102
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,180
Thank you guys for accepting.

1103
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,340
All right, not a problem.

1104
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:04,640
You take care, Bobby.

1105
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,140
You too.

1106
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,780
All right, bye-bye.

1107
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,700
Bobby Black Wolf, that website again,

1108
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:12,060
www.allgames.com slash podcast.

1109
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,700
If you want to hear Bobby's show, allgames.com,

1110
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,340
Orange Lounge Radio starts on Monday.

1111
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,800
And some of you guys might actually

1112
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,020
be hearing this show on allgames.com

1113
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,140
for the first time tomorrow.

1114
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,100
But it was actually yesterday when we taped.

1115
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:24,740
Forget it.

1116
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,740
All right, Loki, take us out of this hour

1117
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:31,020
with, or hour and a half that we're turning into with a little story here about DDR and

1118
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,700
email and what the heck?

1119
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:39,460
Yes, yet another stupid idea brought to you by Microsoft.

1120
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:45,000
This one's actually called StepMail and that's right, it uses a DDR pad to check your email

1121
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:52,920
and it's actually part of this new interface called StepUI and basically their whole spin

1122
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:58,580
on this is, you know what, you're not exercising enough while you're browsing on your PC and

1123
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:03,300
this is a better way to do that. Honestly, folks, how long does it take to check email?

1124
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:08,540
Like two minutes? Do we really need to be walking around on a giant pad that really

1125
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:15,960
is obtrusive and just, no. I think this is the dumbest idea ever. It's like, that's almost

1126
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:21,740
as dumb as saying, okay, I'm going to control my car with this dance pad as well. Are we

1127
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:26,840
Are we sure that something's just not being horribly, horribly misinterpreted or misreported

1128
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,140
here?

1129
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,640
This is straight on Microsoft's website, okay?

1130
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,080
I just want you to know that this isn't like some sort of thing that they're making up.

1131
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:40,520
This shows a picture of some woman stepping on a dance pad, which by the way looks like

1132
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:46,240
a red octane pad, and yes, and it shows the interface right here.

1133
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:50,140
Up, down, close, open, folders, delete.

1134
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:54,100
I like how you have to jump to do different things.

1135
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,140
It looks so dumb.

1136
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,980
It's completely retarded.

1137
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:02,600
And then they've got a photo viewing thing which looks like someone

1138
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,860
crapped it out in about two seconds. You know what would be sweet is if like the

1139
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:09,740
announcer from DDR Extreme would like read your email. You've got mail!

1140
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,020
You've got mail! It's your new record!

1141
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:17,720
Whatever that guy says, you know? You know what? Come get Viagra at our store for free!

1142
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,960
What they need to do is have a program that hooks up to your email and a little

1143
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,480
pedal that you put on the ground so that you're sitting down

1144
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,360
and you're doing like a recumbent bike.

1145
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,280
And the moment you stop pedaling,

1146
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:31,040
your email closes. Don't they have these net bikes at the gym? They do, at the gym.

1147
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:36,200
They should have something like that at home. Anyways, the study shows, you know, using this program the average

1148
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,640
heart rate is increased almost twenty percent while using step mail

1149
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,560
and thirteen percent for step photo.

1150
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,400
Really though, why would you be looking at photos and what I mean, can you imagine I

1151
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,680
Want to look through my picture album. Let me set up this giant dance pad and then someone walks around

1152
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:57,520
What the hell are you doing you complete retard? I'm checking my photos and email

1153
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,520
Yes, and you're lame here it is. Here it is. Here it is

1154
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,040
Imagine this you're gonna have a party. You're gonna have an adult party and so you could get

1155
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:14,040
X-rated pictures to look at on this thing and play naked twister on the DDR

1156
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:18,080
mat. What do you think? I think that's retarded. I think that's the only reason this thing's

1157
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:22,440
gonna get used ever. This thing will never get used. It will be some stupid study that

1158
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:28,040
Microsoft wastes their money on. Then later on next year, come tax time, they'll be like,

1159
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:32,880
you know what? We lost money on this. Tax write-off! That's right. That's all this is

1160
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,640
it attacks right off.

1161
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,720
What applications do you think this will have on the origami?

1162
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:45,280
Well, I can tell you this much that the dance pad is almost the size of the origami.

1163
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,080
And on that note, we're going to go ahead and take a break here.

1164
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,080
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio in a little bit.

1165
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:56,440
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1166
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,440
a week.

1167
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,680
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
