[SPEAKER_03]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,378 --> 00:00:19,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:21,903 --> 00:00:24,986
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here on this March the 12th of 2006 with episode number 176.

6
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:37,894
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a pretty exciting first half there, talking about all sorts of stuff, the new PSP, talking about patching on the Xbox 360, and we're going to kick off this segment with some more news going over to the Xbox 360.

7
00:00:37,974 --> 00:00:38,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

8
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:47,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're saying there's a story going out on most of the gaming sites out there about foil and how it ruined the 360.

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently on the graphics processor...

10
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:54,415
[SPEAKER_05]: HeatSync, there is a foil layer left on there.

11
00:00:55,076 --> 00:01:06,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the German sites out there on the Xbox scene forums, he actually opened up his 360 to show that the foil was still on there.

12
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:18,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And saying that the foil left on there on the heat transfer pad is basically acting like a skillet, I guess, instead of a heat sink.

13
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

14
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:31,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, that's kind of backing up the whole heat sink over the GPU overheating and that's what caused the Xbox 360s to stop working.

15
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:33,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know that one.

16
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think Microsoft is going to replace that one?

17
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:40,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's basically... No, the guy that cracked it open.

18
00:01:41,154 --> 00:01:41,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, no.

19
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:46,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, there's a follow-up by Microsoft and they've

20
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:57,914
[SPEAKER_05]: The video posted by the German blog GamesStore24.de shows the thermal interface pads that are installed per specification.

21
00:01:57,994 --> 00:02:07,181
[SPEAKER_05]: This foil eliminates the need of a protective liner, which simplifies the final assembly process and minimizes shipping concerns and contamination issues.

22
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,022
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I thought it enhanced it.

23
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought opening it up in it was full of cookies.

24
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:22,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that let the gnomes come out to play.

25
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:23,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop looking at my shirt!

26
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:26,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I love your underpants gnome shirt.

27
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:27,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

28
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:33,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the whole thing is, is it, you know, is the foil actually causing this thing to overheat?

29
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:34,452
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know.

30
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:35,813
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it comes down to.

31
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:40,035
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just another article out there because... It gives better heat spread so you can cook better.

32
00:02:41,116 --> 00:02:44,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I personally think that it doesn't because...

33
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:53,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess if you had something on, you know, most of the time like for CPUs and stuff when you're talking like an actual PC, you have thermal paste in between.

34
00:02:54,179 --> 00:03:02,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Some manufacturers will use foil instead because it also allows heat transfer from the CPU to the heatsink.

35
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:06,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if this foil got in the way of that, it possibly could, you know,

36
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:08,193
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

37
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:30,564
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

38
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

39
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:51,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's kind of take this with a grain of salt.

40
00:03:52,006 --> 00:04:02,434
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Chinese website MyDrivers has reported that a Taiwan manufacturer, Compec, has received the orders from Sony to start producing the PCB.

41
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:04,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, the HDI PCB.

42
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:05,997
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be the printed circuit board.

43
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:07,397
[SPEAKER_04]: for the PlayStation 3.

44
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:14,360
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no official announcement from Compaq, but the rumor says that this is going into production June or July of this year.

45
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:25,683
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are taking this with a grain of salt, just know that MyDrivers is a pretty reputable Chinese website, but don't take anybody's word for it until you hear it from Sony directly, I suppose.

46
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:32,065
[SPEAKER_04]: But the PlayStation 3 sounds like it may be on its way after all, at least the first few steps to getting that done.

47
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:35,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's go over to a Nintendo story.

48
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:35,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

49
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,351
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what's new on the Nintendo DS?

50
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:39,592
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of stuff.

51
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:43,394
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this particular, there's a new RPG on the way for the DS.

52
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:52,619
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Contact, and it's a game about hunting, cooking, fishing, training, collecting, and romance.

53
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa, hold on a second.

54
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:56,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Hunting, training, fishing, all that stuff.

55
00:04:56,842 --> 00:04:57,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Organtrail.

56
00:04:57,642 --> 00:04:58,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Organtrail with love.

57
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:08,914
[SPEAKER_02]: You play as someone named Terry.

58
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:12,876
[SPEAKER_02]: You meet a professor whose spaceship has crashed on a weirdo planet.

59
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:16,759
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to collect cells, which are the power source for the ship.

60
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,540
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all over the place, so you have to go find them.

61
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:23,943
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're going, you train animals, collect items, play a bunch of mini-games.

62
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:25,804
[SPEAKER_02]: There's real-time combat.

63
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:26,445
[SPEAKER_02]: There's...

64
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,761
[SPEAKER_02]: An online version, but they haven't said anything about how that's going to work.

65
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:36,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being produced by Goichi Suda, who is the director of Killer7.

66
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:43,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And the characters were designed by Atsuko Fukushima of Popolo Cross.

67
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:45,107
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me happy.

68
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:53,092
[SPEAKER_02]: There is actually an official site up for it too, and it's going to be published by Atlas in the US.

69
00:05:54,312 --> 00:06:09,596
[SPEAKER_02]: No UK release date stated as of yet, although they know that it's in development by Marvelous Interactive, and Rising Star tends to bring over their games in Europe, so there's hope for our European audience.

70
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:11,316
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

71
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:16,298
[SPEAKER_02]: The artwork, I have to say, though, after looking through the Japanese site, it is pretty awesome.

72
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to it.

73
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds cool.

74
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:25,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, we touched on some new stuff on Xbox Live during the first half of the show, but set the record straight for us.

75
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:26,982
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on on Xbox Live?

76
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:30,304
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple new things are coming out, actually.

77
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:37,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Ridge Racer 6 demo is now on Xbox Live so you can also check that out as well.

78
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:54,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a big fan of those type of games like The Outfit, but I'll probably check it out because, hey, it's free.

79
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:59,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And I heard our buddies over at All Games are really into it, and I was listening to their show, and they seem really into it.

80
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:03,301
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole thing reminds me of kind of like G.I.

81
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:07,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe, sort of the whole... Well, when you put it that way, it sounds kind of cool.

82
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:08,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now you know.

83
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:17,392
[SPEAKER_05]: The way The Outfit is, I mean, because it's kind of like this, you know, over-exaggerated, like, World War II action game where you can call in, like,

84
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:27,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that you kind of control a team of four.

85
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:29,163
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like games where I get to be the boss.

86
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,764
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, maybe I will have to check it out.

87
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:37,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though war games are usually not my type of thing, or battle, whatever the hell, I'll give it a fair shot.

88
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:42,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, I tried Battlefield 2, which is so not my kind of game, and I was very lost when I played it, but, you know...

89
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:43,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta try it.

90
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't knock it till you tried it, right?

91
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,682
[SPEAKER_06]: You left yourself way open for a joke and I chose not to speak it right there.

92
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:52,145
[SPEAKER_04]: What right do you have being on this show tonight?

93
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:53,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you even a gamer?

94
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:54,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.

95
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:55,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

96
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:57,288
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the last game you played?

97
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:58,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo 2, like I said.

98
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but new game.

99
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:01,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Burnout?

100
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:03,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, Burnout Legends.

101
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:03,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fine.

102
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:05,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just giving you a hard time.

103
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:06,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Bug's my buddy.

104
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:08,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I've known him forever.

105
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:08,456
[SPEAKER_04]: 17 years.

106
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to put up with your shit.

107
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:10,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, shut up.

108
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:10,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

109
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to put up with mine.

110
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:15,579
[SPEAKER_04]: So Loki, going back over to you, what do you got on Silent Hill?

111
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,922
[SPEAKER_05]: They're working on the Silent Hill 3 team.

112
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,425
[SPEAKER_05]: They're working on a new project for PlayStation 3.

113
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:24,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Duh.

114
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:28,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So like Silent Hill 5, most likely, or maybe something different?

115
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:29,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

116
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,590
[SPEAKER_04]: We just know they're working.

117
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,451
[SPEAKER_04]: They're hard at work again.

118
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:37,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that... And tomorrow the sun will come out!

119
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:50,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, how stupid of a story... It's the third release of Silent Hill 2 for the... They're making another in a really successful franchise that has a movie coming out that's probably going to be one of the first video game movies that's actually good.

120
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,239
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be Final Hill.

121
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:53,260
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making a sequel?

122
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, that's such a shocker!

123
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:57,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know what?

124
00:08:57,843 --> 00:08:58,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Bros.

125
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:01,065
[SPEAKER_05]: is going to be on The Revolution when that comes out too!

126
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:05,436
[SPEAKER_05]: In Halo 3, it's coming out on the Xbox 360.

127
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:06,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa, shocker.

128
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:08,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, seriously.

129
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,368
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, look, it was making the rounds on game sites, so we have to report it.

130
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:17,574
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, do you have something else then, Loki, that might be more worthy of our time?

131
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:19,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

132
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:22,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, yes.

133
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega is developing a PlayStation 3 launch title, and what would you think?

134
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

135
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:30,071
[SPEAKER_03]: The sun's going to set tomorrow, duh.

136
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:31,271
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

137
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:35,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but how many golf games does Sega make?

138
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:38,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

139
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:39,953
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't make mo-cap.

140
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:41,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And plus, you know what?

141
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care how long it's been.

142
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:45,854
[SPEAKER_04]: It is still weird to hear of Sega making games for other consoles.

143
00:09:45,974 --> 00:09:46,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care how long it's been.

144
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:47,294
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still weird.

145
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:55,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they're currently developing a golf game, and actually it's two golf games, I should say.

146
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:04,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't sound that exciting to me, but I don't know, maybe it's Sonic Golf or something.

147
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:10,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, just like everything attached to Sega is just always Sonic.

148
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Ooh La La's Sexy Golf would be awesome.

149
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:16,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Crazy Taxi Golf.

150
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:20,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make some crazy par!

151
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:25,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, DarkSakura is going to try and bring us back to Sanity World.

152
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:26,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, who am I kidding?

153
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:31,442
[SPEAKER_04]: It's her website of the week, and you know it's going to be just as crazy as the rest of what we've been talking about this evening?

154
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:36,585
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a serious and important, relevant site that affects everybody's life.

155
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:37,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, cue the theme music?

156
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:38,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

157
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's website of the week is www.cheese.com

158
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the number one resource about cheese.

159
00:10:52,549 --> 00:11:02,114
[SPEAKER_02]: To quote from the website, cheese is nutritious food made mostly from the milk of cows, but also other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, reindeer, camels, and yaks.

160
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:06,416
[SPEAKER_02]: About 4,000 years ago, people started to breed animals and process their milk.

161
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:08,257
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when cheese was born.

162
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:16,341
[SPEAKER_02]: You can search the database of 654 cheeses by name, country of origin, type of milk used to produce it, or by texture.

163
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:17,482
[SPEAKER_05]: What about head cheese?

164
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:24,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Headcheese is actually the brains of a cow.

165
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:26,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but does it have information about that?

166
00:11:26,994 --> 00:11:28,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's talking about dairy cheese.

167
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:30,315
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Flamanda Cheese then.

168
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:31,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh.

169
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:32,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Flamanda Cheese.

170
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:37,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I watch Red Dwarf.

171
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:38,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

172
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:48,559
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody found Orange Lounge Radio's on-topicness for this episode, could you please email us?

173
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:49,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we seem to have lost it.

174
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the cheeses listed on this site, we have... I believe it's behind the caffeine.

175
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:59,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Air Del Cheese, we have American Cheese, which is really crap.

176
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:05,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Atun Cheese, we have Babybel, which actually is one of my favorites.

177
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:06,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Basket Cheese!

178
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:08,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Carameldansen

179
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think I found the on-topic.

180
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:41,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

181
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:47,677
[SPEAKER_04]: This new game, Galactic Civilizations 2, it's actually a little bit different.

182
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:48,357
[SPEAKER_04]: It just came out.

183
00:12:48,857 --> 00:13:03,065
[SPEAKER_04]: A little different in the digital rights management of the way the game is set up because the license of the game allows you to install the game onto as many machines as you want to, that you own, as long as only one copy is being used at once.

184
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:11,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Their thought behind this, how many sales are lost because people want to have a game on their laptop and desktop, but they don't want to have to buy multiple CDs for that.

185
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:17,455
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, being a laptop and desktop owner, you know, I kind of like games like Warcraft that I can put on both of them, so that's kind of interesting.

186
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:25,143
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other side of that is this company called Starforce, which is an anti-piracy developer.

187
00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:27,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And they kind of struck a low blow.

188
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:44,661
[SPEAKER_04]: A story here on 1up.com that was run earlier this week saying that Starforce, what they did, they actually posted on their company message boards, again, Starforce makes the anti-piracy software, by an admin, and they put a link in the post to a torrent file for Galactic Civilizations 2.

189
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:48,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would an anti-piracy company be linking torrents?

190
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:54,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, saying in the post, right now, several thousands of people are downloading the pirated version only from that website.

191
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:55,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it good for the sales?

192
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Unlikely.

193
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:07,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, it was kind of like a bully tactic, in a way, because they're an anti-piracy company, and they're saying that, oh, this company didn't use our software, and here's their game being rampantly pirated, and how dare they sue them?

194
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:09,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what could happen.

195
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the post is gone now.

196
00:14:12,682 --> 00:14:22,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And Galactic Civilizations 2 did publish a response saying, Our primary weapon to fight piracy is through rewarding customers through convenient, frequent, free updates.

197
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:31,296
[SPEAKER_04]: If you make it easy for users to buy and make full use of your product or service legitimately, then we believe you'll gain more users from that convenience than you'll lose from piracy.

198
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:36,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting and rebellious stance from this company that I think is very customer-driven.

199
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say, kind of neat.

200
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:42,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Starforce needed any more negative publicity, seriously.

201
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:43,522
[SPEAKER_05]: What else have they done?

202
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:44,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not very familiar with that company.

203
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:45,802
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really bad.

204
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:58,685
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the techs that they use, I think they're one of the companies that had spyware thrown on your PC that basically monitors what you're running, that type of thing.

205
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:00,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure that was the same company.

206
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:02,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, so...

207
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:05,113
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on the naughty list this week.

208
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:12,096
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Galactic Civilizations 2 on the nice list for their outside-the-box thinking on their policy there.

209
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:14,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what else is being developed?

210
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:27,102
[SPEAKER_05]: This company called Bigfoot Networks has actually just gotten some money to develop what they're saying is going to be the end of all lag.

211
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:28,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Lag is gone.

212
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:30,744
[SPEAKER_05]: They're developing, I guess, hardware that's going to be

213
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:36,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Use it in conjunction with online games or God knows what, and it will end lag.

214
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:42,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, I don't know, it sounds interesting.

215
00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:44,635
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those I'll believe it when I see it type things.

216
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:45,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

217
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:53,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray for the idea that somebody's going to try and fix the lag problems, but can you really know?

218
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:53,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

219
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:56,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll believe it when I see it.

220
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:57,402
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, you know...

221
00:15:59,144 --> 00:15:59,384
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

222
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:27,228
[SPEAKER_04]: What?!

223
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Miss Thing.

224
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:38,677
[SPEAKER_04]: You have some updates, well, not updates, but an interesting story on some games that were never released, but maybe should have been?

225
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:43,441
[SPEAKER_02]: To quote this title, which I think is perfect, cut down in their prime.

226
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:44,682
[SPEAKER_02]: What website's this?

227
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:47,384
[SPEAKER_02]: The Best Games That Never Were, from GameCloud.

228
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:47,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

229
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:49,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

230
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:53,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's just a list of various games that have been cancelled.

231
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:59,978
[SPEAKER_02]: One was Babylon 5 Into the Fire, cancelled September 1998, which was basically a big space simulator.

232
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:07,941
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have used some filmed content from the TV actors, but it was just dragging along for the development, so they axed it.

233
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,801
[SPEAKER_02]: XCOM Genesis XCOM Alliance

234
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:40,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, another victim of Hasbro.

235
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:44,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Daikatana 2, 1999.

236
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Games that should have been cut.

237
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:49,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen, The Awakening, January 2000.

238
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a first-person shooter at Cave Dog.

239
00:17:55,785 --> 00:18:04,070
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an E3 demo at 1999, had a lot of interactive features, but they, well, had money issues and boop, down it went.

240
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So they focused on Total Annihilation and then closed down.

241
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:07,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

242
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:14,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultima Worlds Online canceled March 2001.

243
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:30,778
[SPEAKER_02]: It was by Origin and EA to create a sequel to the first Ultima to do sort of like a sci-fi fantasy thing, but they didn't want to pull people off of the original Ultima Online, so they

244
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:39,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, because then years later, of course, you have EverQuest 2 doing battle with EverQuest 1 in a way, because people who built up their characters on EverQuest 1 didn't want to leave.

245
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:43,626
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like they saw this with Ultima years ago.

246
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of interesting.

247
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:48,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Another game canceled was Simsville, September 2001.

248
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:55,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Maxis announced it in 2000 as a mix of The Sims and SimCity.

249
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:57,569
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

250
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:05,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have an old copy of SimCity 3000 that has a promo material for it.

251
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:09,969
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, wow, this looks like it'd be interesting, but I don't know how the hell they're going to pull it off.

252
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:12,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Bug, do you remember when we used to play SimAnt?

253
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:13,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

254
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:14,192
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was the shit.

255
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:15,052
[SPEAKER_04]: The bright yellow ant.

256
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:16,053
[SPEAKER_04]: The game was awesome.

257
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:20,516
[SPEAKER_02]: But pretty much instead of doing that, they did The Sims Online and then went on to Sims 2.

258
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Which probably was better, worked out better for them.

259
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we had TORN.

260
00:19:26,147 --> 00:19:27,748
[SPEAKER_02]: July 2001, it was cancelled.

261
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:33,270
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from Interplay's Black Isle Studios that would have used the Liftec engine.

262
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Hyped up.

263
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:36,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Cancelled down.

264
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:39,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Because especially Interplay hasn't done a game in two years.

265
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Duke Nukem Endangered Species.

266
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:44,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Cancelled 2001.

267
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:48,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically because they're working on Duke Nukem Forever.

268
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:52,818
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were... Which we're still waiting on!

269
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:53,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello!

270
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:53,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

271
00:19:55,788 --> 00:20:03,231
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a message by the 3D Realms CEO on the Planet Crap message board.

272
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:05,032
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best name ever, Planet Crap.

273
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:10,334
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a game we had to give our publisher in order to get a very sweet deal in another area.

274
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:12,976
[SPEAKER_02]: We've since talked them out of it.

275
00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:13,536
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the quote.

276
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:19,972
[SPEAKER_04]: To answer some questions from chat room, www.orangelondrader.com.

277
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:22,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Phoenix wants to know, why are we talking about games that were canceled in 2000-2001?

278
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:27,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the list is the best of all time, or best games that were never, I don't know.

279
00:20:27,274 --> 00:20:27,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's more.

280
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:28,254
[SPEAKER_04]: All time.

281
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us real quickly what's left.

282
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:33,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam & Max Freelance Police canceled March 2004.

283
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:34,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Trinity in 2003.

284
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:39,717
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sort of a response to Return to Castle Wolfenstein.

285
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:42,378
[SPEAKER_02]: SWAT Urban Justice canceled 2003.

286
00:20:42,918 --> 00:20:43,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Mythica, February 2004.

287
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:48,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimate X Odyssey 2004, Black 9 sometime in 2003.

288
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:52,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting feedback from our chat room.

289
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they were starting to shout out some other games that came to mind.

290
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:57,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryoma says the Zelda demo with Ganon.

291
00:20:58,146 --> 00:20:59,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess a while back there was that demo.

292
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:05,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it on GameCube, that first demo that they had?

293
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:08,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to remember which one he's referencing because there's a couple that come to mind there.

294
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:14,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Spirit Snare says they canceled Nintendo Puzzle Collection, Panel de Pon forever, but they released Pokemon Channel instead.

295
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:16,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

296
00:21:17,368 --> 00:21:28,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Ryoma and GK128 are joining in, and EarthBound64, but GK128 pointing out EarthBound64 was canned, but it came back on the GBA in Japan.

297
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:33,712
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, one that I can interject as well, remember the Final Fantasy VI in 3D demo?

298
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:37,653
[SPEAKER_04]: A very brief demo that was on Nintendo 64 or something, and drove the fanboys crazy.

299
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually still been trying to hunt that down.

300
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it ages ago.

301
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:41,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

302
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:44,475
[SPEAKER_02]: They're an emulation site.

303
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:48,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the guy who did, and this was another game I was actually interested in was Robotech Crystal Dreams.

304
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:58,063
[SPEAKER_02]: The developer of that game actually has the ROM for it up on his website and his 3D models available.

305
00:21:58,303 --> 00:22:00,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see if I can hunt that down for folks in the chat room.

306
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:01,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.

307
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:08,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, one thing that people have been waiting a little while to see a game made out of this is Family Guy.

308
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:15,264
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, High Voltage Software is going to be developing a Family Guy game for Take-Two Entertainment.

309
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:22,407
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be doing some video games there based on Family Guy, and I'm assuming that it's actually going to be multi-platform?

310
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:44,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I read somewhere near it's multi-platform so you're probably going to see I would say it's probably going to be a very similar deal to what you see with like the Simpsons games but hopefully better games than what we got with the Simpsons games because there were only a couple like Hit and Run was okay but you know most of the Simpsons games were kind of poopy the good old arcade game oh well yeah the arcade game it owns everything but you know

311
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:47,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally want to see another arcade game.

312
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this Family Guy jumping the shark, though?

313
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:22,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's, I wouldn't really want my, you know, I wouldn't really want to see a Family Guy game just because I'm afraid of what they'd do with it.

314
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:25,896
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's done right, then hell yeah.

315
00:23:26,016 --> 00:23:37,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryoma in our chat room at OrangeHuntTrader.com says, it's going to be Peter farting, Stewie cursing, Brian drinking, Chris whining, Meg also whining, Lois cleaning up after everyone's crap, and Quagmire being generally horny.

316
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:38,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll just be the show.

317
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,600
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be a Quagmire game.

318
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:43,282
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Quagmire!

319
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:45,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Xander C says, you know what they need to make a video game out of?

320
00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:46,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio.

321
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:52,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we have somebody a while back that was going to make a text adventure game based on Orange Lounge Radio or something?

322
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:53,910
[SPEAKER_04]: We need our own RPG.

323
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, we need to fire up RPG Creator and make something.

324
00:23:57,772 --> 00:23:59,013
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting.

325
00:23:59,113 --> 00:24:00,134
[SPEAKER_04]: It's harder than it sounds.

326
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:00,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

327
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what, guys?

328
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:05,818
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to do something like that and get our eternal worship, go for it.

329
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:07,740
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll put it on our MySpace or something.

330
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

331
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:12,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on to another story.

332
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:21,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go on over to Loki, who has another possible movie jump in the... Exactly.

333
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:28,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, Quentin Tarantino in video games, that's something you don't really hear that often.

334
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Please say Kill Bill the game.

335
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:30,797
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

336
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:31,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.

337
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:32,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill Bill the Game?

338
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:32,240
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

339
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:38,131
[SPEAKER_05]: The theme of this year's game is coming out are old, classic, violent movies made into games.

340
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:42,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you have The Godfather, Scarface, and now Reservoir Dogs.

341
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:43,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

342
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:44,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Reservoir Dogs the game.

343
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:46,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Reservoir Dogs the game.

344
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So lots of cursing, shooting, and black and white.

345
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:56,395
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be based on the movie and being developed by Blitz Games.

346
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:12,884
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be primarily a third-person shooter, but we'll incorporate some driving elements as well as the torture scene where Michael Madsen reprises his role of Mr. Blonde and cuts

347
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:18,538
[SPEAKER_04]: 3rd person shooter involving some driving Why does NARC come to mind for some crazy reason?

348
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,579
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what comes to mind for me?

349
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:29,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Enter the Matrix Oh, that's kind of weird Because it involves driving and shooting I don't like Enter the Matrix Again, is this jumping the shark?

350
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:34,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably It's just a trend, I mean, it's just like Scarface Into the shark

351
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:40,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like Jaws, speaking of jumping the shark, the Jaws game is coming out later this year.

352
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:44,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody was just telling me about that game the other night, that they're eagerly awaiting that game.

353
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaws jumped the shark when Jaws 2 came out.

354
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,377
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Jaws 3D?

355
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:53,841
[SPEAKER_05]: With Jaws, they actually have a dismemberment engine, and you can dismember people in 25 different places.

356
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:54,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you play as the shark?

357
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:55,882
[SPEAKER_05]: You play as the shark.

358
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:56,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, that's pretty cool.

359
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:57,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Where have you been?

360
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you.

361
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.

362
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, they showed it at E3.

363
00:26:03,486 --> 00:26:04,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have sworn we went and looked at it.

364
00:26:04,827 --> 00:26:07,929
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't go look at that because I was busy whoring myself out to Sega.

365
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:10,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Echo the Dolphin on rabies.

366
00:26:14,634 --> 00:26:15,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the line for the PS3.

367
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:16,936
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I was.

368
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:17,716
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, all right.

369
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:19,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

370
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:21,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys hear this?

371
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,582
[SPEAKER_04]: In China, they are rising up and starting a revolution.

372
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:35,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Unions have threatened to quit playing World of Warcraft because it has to do with unstable servers, and it's just going crazy.

373
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:39,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it's important to note that Blizzard really doesn't oversee the servers.

374
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:46,450
[SPEAKER_04]: In China, it's actually maintained by a company called The9, and they charge gamers by the hour to play World of Warcraft.

375
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost said World of Warcraft, sorry.

376
00:26:48,872 --> 00:26:49,773
[SPEAKER_04]: World of Warcraft.

377
00:26:50,553 --> 00:26:51,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the game, don't get me wrong.

378
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:52,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

379
00:26:53,323 --> 00:27:00,725
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nine is having a lot of problems solving technical issues related to the game, and they're not seeking Blizzard's help all the time there.

380
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:06,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamers are getting pissed off at severe time delays, long queue times, and frozen server.

381
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:15,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, WoW has about 530,000 players on it, and they're about ready to just rise up and quit playing the game.

382
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:16,210
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to vote with their wallets.

383
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

384
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:20,742
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what's going on in the UK?

385
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:21,523
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few things.

386
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:23,125
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a zombie MMO on its way by Thinking Man Studios.

387
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:46,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a survival horror MMORPG that lets you play either as a human or a flesh-eating zombie.

388
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:52,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It's titled Exanimus, which is Latin for without life for people who don't know that.

389
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:54,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a button for yelling brains?

390
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:59,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think a zombie would really have the mental capacity to be able to say brains.

391
00:27:59,598 --> 00:28:01,959
[SPEAKER_02]: They just go like that.

392
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:07,547
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be able to expect to see half-rotten corpses walking around tearing apart the bodies of the living for food.

393
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:32,338
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a website that's stating it will be competitively priced to other MMOs currently on the market.

394
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:40,142
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is only in development for the PC, but for a Max, Xbox 360, or PS3 version, they say you never know.

395
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:44,444
[SPEAKER_02]: With technology always changing, we are always interested in finding new outlets for people to play.

396
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:51,307
[SPEAKER_02]: No yet word of a release date, no screenshots out, but there is a site, and I'll be linking it to our chat room shortly.

397
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:55,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally want to play as a zombie so I can go around eating people.

398
00:28:57,676 --> 00:28:59,597
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, tearing off limbs, beating them with it.

399
00:28:59,617 --> 00:29:00,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Shaun of the Dead.

400
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:00,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

401
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:02,699
[SPEAKER_02]: We need Shaun of the Dead the game.

402
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,500
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually a brilliant idea.

403
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up, Sony is removing PSP posters.

404
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:20,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a particular poster that advises consumers to take a running jump from tram and train stations across the country after transport staff expressed safety concerns.

405
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:26,464
[SPEAKER_02]: The poster was part of a recent advertising campaign to promote the PSP in the UK.

406
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:29,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It featured a plain white background with red text that said, Take a running jump from here.

407
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:37,152
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been actually a bunch of other ones that are kind of teasing at the changes that are being made with the PSP.

408
00:29:37,212 --> 00:29:41,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the ones we mentioned a couple weeks ago about pictures and stuff?

409
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:43,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

410
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:43,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

411
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:46,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a little bit more on this.

412
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:56,317
[SPEAKER_02]: A rail worker saw the poster to Tram Platform at Metrolink's Manchester Piccadilly Station and decided there was a safety issue and tried to have it covered.

413
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:59,240
[SPEAKER_02]: They saw it, said it looked inappropriate.

414
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:09,088
[SPEAKER_02]: And to quote on here, the message goes completely against all of our safety messages, particularly because PlayStation is aimed at youngsters and we are constantly telling them not to trespass.

415
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:14,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sony has taken steps down to remove the posters from the tram stations.

416
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:19,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, guess what we've got?

417
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:24,078
[SPEAKER_02]: We have release dates, which would be nice if this Battle for Middle-Earth ad wouldn't cover half of them.

418
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, let's see.

419
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,343
[SPEAKER_02]: We have actually had releases.

420
00:30:33,104 --> 00:30:36,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we have passed the 10th, I'm going to go ahead and move on to the 14th.

421
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:40,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence on PS2 on the 14th.

422
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:46,973
[SPEAKER_02]: 17th, 24, The Game, Ankh, Atelier Iris, Eternal Mana, Burnout Revenge.

423
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:59,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Buzz, The Big Quiz, Driver Parallel Lines, Finding Nemo, JamesBun007 from Russia with Love, LA Rush, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe, Onimusha, Dawn of Dreams, Sonic Riders.

424
00:31:00,017 --> 00:31:01,318
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not getting Sonic Riders?

425
00:31:02,478 --> 00:31:02,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

426
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,820
[SPEAKER_02]: The Outfit, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, Worms.

427
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,001
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

428
00:31:10,581 --> 00:31:10,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

429
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:14,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, anything we should be looking forward to in the U.S.

430
00:31:14,426 --> 00:31:14,966
[SPEAKER_04]: to follow that up?

431
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:17,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's actually some pretty cool stuff coming out this week.

432
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:21,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Driver Parallel Lines coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

433
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:24,454
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to not suck, but we'll see.

434
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:28,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence, of course, really awesome.

435
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:35,284
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're into kids' games, I guess Ice Age 2 The Meltdown.

436
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, to match the movie.

437
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:39,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, the movie's coming out later this year.

438
00:31:40,744 --> 00:31:42,645
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I don't know.

439
00:31:44,106 --> 00:31:45,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much else coming out.

440
00:31:45,347 --> 00:31:46,667
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you heard about 24, The Game?

441
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:47,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of curious about this.

442
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:52,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I've fallen behind on watching the actual show, just because I really haven't watched a lot of TV recently.

443
00:31:53,972 --> 00:31:58,274
[SPEAKER_04]: The shows I used to watch all the time, I'll admit, I watch Survivor every week.

444
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:00,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been watching it, like, nothing.

445
00:32:00,616 --> 00:32:01,556
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really weird.

446
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:01,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

447
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:04,516
[SPEAKER_04]: But how's 24 the game supposed to be?

448
00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:05,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard anything about this?

449
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:06,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the reviews weren't that great.

450
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:07,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

451
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:08,649
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad.

452
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:16,699
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to seem really random, but of course we are an interactive show, and sometimes the chatroom is going to dictate the way we go on the show here.

453
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:26,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Phoenix in our chatroom at OrangeMonterey.com says, This kid at my school got caught wanking in the bathroom to porn on his PSP, in response to the PSP bit that DarkSakura had to say.

454
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:28,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But that made me think of this clip that's going around the internet this week.

455
00:32:28,842 --> 00:32:29,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you guys seen this?

456
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:38,584
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy that's playing World of Warcraft, and the friends sneak up on him, and he's wanking to the sexy night elf dancing, the female night elf.

457
00:32:38,604 --> 00:32:39,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you guys seen this on YouTube?

458
00:32:39,964 --> 00:32:40,204
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

459
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:42,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Where have you been posting?

460
00:33:08,564 --> 00:33:18,811
[SPEAKER_04]: worldofwank.com, Loki, you also have another worldly story for us.

461
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:22,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's interesting.

462
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:29,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, Nintendo is going to suit the Dutch.

463
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:31,913
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they do this time?

464
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's always picking on the Dutch, you know?

465
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:34,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm half Dutch.

466
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:37,335
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband's Dutch, and you know what his grandfather says?

467
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,296
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ain't Dutch, you ain't much.

468
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:43,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know I use a stage name on this show, but if you know my real last name, it's very Dutch.

469
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:46,560
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you can kind of tell.

470
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:58,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, long story short, they did a political ad for one of the politicians running, and of course, parodying Mario Brothers, so...

471
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:03,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, so why are they suing the political party over this?

472
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:04,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's a Dutch.

473
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, run this by me again.

474
00:34:07,102 --> 00:34:07,642
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

475
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:19,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Political party did an advertisement, I guess bashing one of their competitors or whatever, running, using like a Mario Brothers type of thing.

476
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:20,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

477
00:34:20,313 --> 00:34:20,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

478
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:22,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a clip or anything?

479
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:22,615
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

480
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:23,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Dutch.

481
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:24,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, damn.

482
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:31,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, I guess it's nice to know that there's many sue-happy companies in the gaming industry.

483
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:31,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

484
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:34,196
[SPEAKER_04]: What about parody and all that stuff?

485
00:34:34,256 --> 00:34:36,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't you... Well, I don't know.

486
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:37,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's an American thing.

487
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:40,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about Dutch law, but shouldn't there be room for fair parody and all that stuff?

488
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:43,263
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not when you're talking about Mario Brothers.

489
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:44,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess not.

490
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:44,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Sheesh.

491
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:45,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Parody and satire.

492
00:34:45,925 --> 00:34:46,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it.

493
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:48,868
[SPEAKER_04]: God of War 2 It's Coming Out

494
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's pretty much all we have to say about that at this time.

495
00:35:04,962 --> 00:35:09,925
[SPEAKER_04]: It is coming out and actually Game Informer magazine actually has some screens from it.

496
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:12,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, something to note, it is coming out for PlayStation 2.

497
00:35:14,227 --> 00:35:16,769
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not going to be for PS3.

498
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:22,552
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty awesome, except I haven't got my freaking Game Informer magazine issues in the last three months.

499
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn them.

500
00:35:24,393 --> 00:35:25,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, what happened?

501
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:27,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid people.

502
00:35:27,295 --> 00:35:29,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, they just don't freaking...

503
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:32,741
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, are you ready to get your hate on?

504
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:35,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, although this Dutch thing is really funny.

505
00:36:00,353 --> 00:36:10,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to say that my FU of the week goes towards, I would have to say the whole American work ethic.

506
00:36:11,297 --> 00:36:11,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

507
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:22,061
[SPEAKER_02]: As in, well, not necessarily the work ethic, but the attitude that corporations, different companies place on overworking employees, you know?

508
00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:29,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's in the Netherlands that the government has mandatory four weeks paid vacations.

509
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,122
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here, what are we given, what, 10 days?

510
00:36:32,682 --> 00:36:33,002
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 days?

511
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:34,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

512
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:35,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's including sick time.

513
00:36:36,884 --> 00:36:38,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet, they're just as productive as we are.

514
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:40,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

515
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:47,769
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, uh, you know, they wonder why we have the highest, uh, you know, amount of, uh, stress leave granted to employees.

516
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:49,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because they're burning us out!

517
00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:51,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So take a vacation.

518
00:36:53,192 --> 00:36:53,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

519
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:54,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

520
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:56,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's been my FU of the entire week.

521
00:36:56,974 --> 00:36:57,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki.

522
00:36:57,514 --> 00:36:57,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

523
00:36:59,012 --> 00:37:07,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, fuck you to the full auto multiplayer servers and for the people that constantly disconnect mid-race because they're losing and they suck.

524
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:14,307
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it really hard for me to get these last two achievements if people keep quitting the races and they're not counting.

525
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:16,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a 360, I'll help you with that.

526
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:22,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give an FU to movie prices, because that's really why I haven't been to the movies in forever.

527
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:34,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, I can pay $9.25 to go see a movie in the theater, or I can pay less than twice that to get a Netflix account and watch movies on my pretty HDTV.

528
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:37,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Bug, do you have any FUs?

529
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:44,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a few to not having a job still since May, but I do have an interview this week.

530
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:45,211
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to make your plea?

531
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:47,252
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of people listening to the show, maybe some in the Bay Area.

532
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:49,555
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your qualifications?

533
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:50,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Unix admin.

534
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:51,916
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

535
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:54,577
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to offer Bugged a job, send us an email.

536
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:57,778
[SPEAKER_04]: With real money, not... He's actually a really smart computer guy.

537
00:37:57,798 --> 00:38:01,280
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how everybody has that friend that they call when they need their computer fixed?

538
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,100
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Bugged.

539
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I call Bugged when Loki's not available.

540
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:07,162
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just... It really depends on what the issue is.

541
00:38:07,242 --> 00:38:08,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Bugged, I call for most of my issues.

542
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:11,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I had one more I forgot.

543
00:38:12,185 --> 00:38:16,389
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to my work for blocking all internet access except for a few select sites.

544
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:23,094
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is not really... I understand why they're doing it because there's a lot of people slacking off at work and going on MySpace and stuff like that.

545
00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:32,982
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem is it's also the sites I use for my information on games and stuff and to update our inter-office forms and stuff is being blocked.

546
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:36,305
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to constantly email them, like for example IGN.

547
00:38:37,116 --> 00:38:43,208
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't really understand how many subdomains there are to IGN until you actually have it blocked and try to have them unblock it.

548
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:46,956
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like 60 different domains on there and they have to unblock all of them.

549
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:52,712
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're arguably saying, oh, some of these are for ads, and we don't want to unlock two ads.

550
00:38:52,952 --> 00:38:54,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then I don't get pictures on that site.

551
00:38:54,554 --> 00:38:56,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And GameSpot, same thing.

552
00:38:56,516 --> 00:39:02,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have pictures on the site anymore, and all the site formatting is all messed up now because they blocked all this stuff.

553
00:39:02,282 --> 00:39:02,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't get the CSS.

554
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:09,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, the other thing, too, they blocked all search engines, so if you're looking for information that might not be on those sites, oh, you're screwed.

555
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,792
[SPEAKER_04]: How about instead of blocking the entire internet, they just block MySpace?

556
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:25,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe they should just block the sites that they don't want people to go to, which I've insisted they do in the first place, but the conspiracy theory around the office is they're doing it to make work uncomfortable so people will leave.

557
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, can you still play Solitaire on the computers?

558
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:29,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

559
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:32,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what did they fix there?

560
00:39:32,123 --> 00:39:33,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Just make sure you don't play when the governor comes through.

561
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:44,244
[SPEAKER_02]: What they did in my work is there's actually a corporate software that they can have go in with Internet Explorer that blocks certain sites registered as a certain type.

562
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:46,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, and that's what they did in this site.

563
00:39:46,106 --> 00:39:51,150
[SPEAKER_05]: But they blocked even stuff that was registered as movies slash TV, which is our business.

564
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

565
00:39:52,912 --> 00:40:01,339
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just gotten to a ridiculous level, and they've taken this whole back-asswards approach to try to solve the problem and...

566
00:40:02,408 --> 00:40:04,809
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how I know that we made it, though, in the business.

567
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:12,532
[SPEAKER_04]: OrangeLonsRadio.com finally got blocked by WebSense at one point for being like an internet fan club or something.

568
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:14,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I can still access it at work.

569
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:21,656
[SPEAKER_04]: But I couldn't access it at one of our vendor companies because I guess they have a high level of restriction on WebSense.

570
00:40:22,356 --> 00:40:23,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And we get picked up.

571
00:40:24,057 --> 00:40:24,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, huh?

572
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:25,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucky you.

573
00:40:25,578 --> 00:40:25,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

574
00:40:26,178 --> 00:40:26,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

575
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:28,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's excellent, though.

576
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:32,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to explain to my boss why certain things take longer than usual now.

577
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:34,593
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you have to do.

578
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:35,955
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to give justification.

579
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,236
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's all about.

580
00:40:37,336 --> 00:40:39,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Once management starts fussing, things will change.

581
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:44,003
[SPEAKER_02]: When it starts affecting how management looks, oh yeah, they'll make it change.

582
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:46,826
[SPEAKER_06]: When they can't hit their girly porn, they'll fix it.

583
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:51,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on and get back into some news here.

584
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:54,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, Konami, what are they up to?

585
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:57,160
[SPEAKER_05]: They're up to making some stuff.

586
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:02,522
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're jumping on the Nintendogs bandwagon, that's right.

587
00:41:02,722 --> 00:41:09,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami's making another dog simulator game, including a touch mode and stuff.

588
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:12,026
[SPEAKER_05]: The only difference is, it's for PC.

589
00:41:13,428 --> 00:41:24,778
[SPEAKER_05]: All the pictures of this game all look like the dog is taking a crap.

590
00:41:25,398 --> 00:41:26,719
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true!

591
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:27,580
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the game?

592
00:41:28,281 --> 00:41:28,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Pooping Dog?

593
00:41:29,782 --> 00:41:32,024
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Dog Station is what it is.

594
00:41:32,044 --> 00:41:35,367
[SPEAKER_05]: This looks like a great game for me to poop on.

595
00:41:35,407 --> 00:41:36,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't they make a cat game?

596
00:41:37,188 --> 00:41:41,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, it's like dog picture dog pooping.

597
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:44,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Dog picture dog pooping.

598
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:46,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's the way he's sitting.

599
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:46,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

600
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:48,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Dog poop is funny.

601
00:41:49,296 --> 00:41:57,781
[SPEAKER_05]: If I remember correctly, though, I believe Dog Station was an arcade game, I want to say, because I know that Dog Station is a franchise that they have out there right now.

602
00:41:58,722 --> 00:42:02,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not exactly sure what you do, but DarkTetsuya in chat agrees with you.

603
00:42:02,765 --> 00:42:04,446
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

604
00:42:05,186 --> 00:42:06,467
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be like Nintendogs at work.

605
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:09,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Next you're going to be getting Bunga Bunga, the home version.

606
00:42:09,548 --> 00:42:10,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Gross.

607
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,689
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know what that is, good.

608
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:14,029
[SPEAKER_04]: You're lucky.

609
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:15,890
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

610
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,390
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

611
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:20,871
[SPEAKER_04]: You have an interesting story about a game I've been looking forward to.

612
00:42:21,211 --> 00:42:26,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know much about it, but it still sounds fascinating to me, just the little I have heard about it.

613
00:42:26,513 --> 00:42:27,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you need it?

614
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:29,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I do.

615
00:42:29,734 --> 00:42:31,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we could all use a little bit of it.

616
00:42:31,614 --> 00:42:31,994
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?

617
00:42:32,294 --> 00:42:33,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Brain training.

618
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:34,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh-hoh.

619
00:42:36,196 --> 00:42:47,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, their, uh, brain training is, um, actually there was an announcement in the Mainichi Daily News, which I think is funny because Mainichi also means every day.

620
00:42:47,860 --> 00:43:00,485
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, um, it's, uh, basically, uh, to help your brain fire on all of the nerve structures and now doctors are recommending it to the elderly to help stimulate their brain.

621
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:09,849
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a memory loss clinic at Kyoto's Uchida Hospital for patients suffering dementia.

622
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:17,415
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a hold of the DSs and brain training and are using it to try to help

623
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:20,801
[SPEAKER_02]: People get brain function back.

624
00:43:21,382 --> 00:43:31,813
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a quote from a 67-year-old patient named Isamu Shishido who said that he hoped the game would help him stop forgetting things like names and phone numbers so his daughter will stop making fun of him.

625
00:43:32,674 --> 00:43:34,876
[SPEAKER_02]: To quote, I don't want to end up some crazy old man.

626
00:43:34,936 --> 00:43:36,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play a little every day before going to bed.

627
00:43:37,499 --> 00:43:38,159
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, is he a...

628
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:40,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Reasonable Stuff.

629
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:54,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo basically though is using this as an excuse to point out again that people of all ages like it's brain training software and that they're trying to use this strategy to try and appeal to existing games, you know,

630
00:43:55,982 --> 00:44:11,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamers who are out of it, non-gamers, trying to basically appeal to the whole broad market of gamers as this is something you can use to... I can't help but think myself, is this going to be the next game that really crosses that gap and gets everybody in on it, like Tetris?

631
00:44:12,135 --> 00:44:15,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the theory is it's actually a publicity stunt because Nintendo is housed in Kyoto.

632
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:18,240
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know...

633
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:39,890
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's going to pretty much help with, you know, because we're first marketing it to younger people and people of slow learning capacity, but if this is something that's going to also help keep the minds of older people sharp to hold off some of the effects of old age, then who are we to...

634
00:44:43,378 --> 00:44:45,079
[SPEAKER_02]: But who are we to tell them not to do it?

635
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:51,382
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's actually helping people, if it does good, they should go for it.

636
00:44:51,462 --> 00:44:56,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks in our chatroom might disagree with the brain training setting the stage to be a huge game.

637
00:44:56,826 --> 00:45:01,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Funnydale in our chatroom says, brain training, with that name alone, it's a sure bet that it'll fail in the USA.

638
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:08,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I think brain Olympics would have been it, but then you fight with the Olympic committee over something like that, but

639
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:19,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember a Fox special that was on, something like How Smart is America?

640
00:45:20,072 --> 00:45:21,413
[SPEAKER_04]: or the Great American Quiz.

641
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:23,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't this a couple years ago they had this show on?

642
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:25,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a big 20-question quiz show.

643
00:45:25,616 --> 00:45:28,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Just attach the name American Idol to brain training.

644
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:30,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Pop Idol.

645
00:45:38,423 --> 00:45:42,987
[SPEAKER_05]: and as opposites of that probably sounds, you know, American Idol does well in the ratings.

646
00:45:44,669 --> 00:45:45,009
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

647
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I vote for, like, Brain Food.

648
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:49,833
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

649
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:59,681
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of winding down here with Orange Lounge Radio this week, but first off, a chance for anybody to get out any stories they haven't done yet before we get into tonight's last story.

650
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:00,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one.

651
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:00,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

652
00:46:01,683 --> 00:46:05,306
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to become, well, actually, it should piss off a lot of people.

653
00:46:06,587 --> 00:46:21,414
[SPEAKER_05]: According to a post on Xbox.com, there is an internal Best Buy document, and we know how wonderful those are, stating that the new premium systems will now include a 100GB hard drive instead of the 20GB hard drive.

654
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:22,034
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

655
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:23,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoops.

656
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:24,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

657
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:26,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

658
00:46:26,356 --> 00:46:27,357
[SPEAKER_05]: You bastards.

659
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:32,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is supposed to coincide with the DirecTV downloadable...

660
00:46:33,863 --> 00:46:34,143
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

661
00:46:34,243 --> 00:46:34,583
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

662
00:47:03,178 --> 00:47:06,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, last story of the night, Loki, what's the exciting news this week?

663
00:47:07,681 --> 00:47:15,925
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a fan of really cheesy crap that's on TV, you might remember a show called Captain N. I remember how awful that show was.

664
00:47:16,425 --> 00:47:24,330
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, the NES era cartoon featuring Kevin Keen, normal teenager battling the evil mother brain in Videoland.

665
00:47:25,622 --> 00:47:26,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Freakazoid was far better.

666
00:47:55,879 --> 00:47:56,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, from the, yeah.

667
00:47:56,979 --> 00:47:58,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought the character models were pretty good.

668
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the deal?

669
00:48:00,261 --> 00:48:01,341
[SPEAKER_02]: It jumped the shark with the Game Boy.

670
00:48:01,641 --> 00:48:02,702
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the deal with Captain N?

671
00:48:02,742 --> 00:48:03,122
[SPEAKER_04]: DVD?

672
00:48:03,462 --> 00:48:04,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming to DVD?

673
00:48:04,262 --> 00:48:05,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Jesus, when?

674
00:48:05,703 --> 00:48:08,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have a when yet, but it is coming to DVD.

675
00:48:09,444 --> 00:48:12,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So to put next to your Zelda cartoons from the Super Mario Super Show.

676
00:48:13,566 --> 00:48:17,648
[SPEAKER_05]: This is also put out by the same people that did, I believe, what was it?

677
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:19,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember the show now.

678
00:48:20,049 --> 00:48:20,349
[SPEAKER_05]: It was...

679
00:48:22,824 --> 00:48:24,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Cops, the animated series.

680
00:48:24,265 --> 00:48:25,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I liked Cops.

681
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:32,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I might add got horrible reviews in the transfer, which sounds like real Ghostbusters versus Ghostbusters.

682
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:44,394
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole thing about Captain is that for anybody who ever paid attention to the actual storylines to the games, it was like a big old insult.

683
00:48:46,853 --> 00:48:48,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to clarify some things in the chat room there.

684
00:48:49,214 --> 00:48:53,735
[SPEAKER_04]: The statement there, coming from a couple people, I'll read Sephiroth 1215's line here.

685
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:56,575
[SPEAKER_04]: The HDDs aren't even 20 gigs, it was like 16.

686
00:48:56,935 --> 00:49:00,736
[SPEAKER_04]: This is because of the emulator that's pre-installed on the drive.

687
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:04,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, they forgot to mention that when they're selling you the 20 gig hard drive.

688
00:49:05,057 --> 00:49:08,398
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, there's already a big fat emulator on here that you can't really get rid of.

689
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:14,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, it's pre-loaded with a bunch of songs, too.

690
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:15,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I had to go through and delete all the songs.

691
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:20,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I actually loaded a custom soundtrack on my machine for when I'm playing, like, the little Bejeweleds and Zumas and stuff.

692
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:24,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I put a custom soundtrack on there, so I had to delete all the crap that was already on there.

693
00:49:25,276 --> 00:49:25,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Frustrating.

694
00:49:26,037 --> 00:49:30,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do not like... I thought the way the Xbox handled the memory management was way better than 360.

695
00:49:30,439 --> 00:49:34,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in 360, you have to dive into all the submenus to erase something.

696
00:49:34,161 --> 00:49:35,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just very frustrating.

697
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:37,863
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no global disk erase menu.

698
00:49:38,423 --> 00:49:38,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

699
00:49:39,198 --> 00:49:40,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you want to erase anything ever?

700
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:42,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

701
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:49,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, kids, it's about time to wrap up this edition of Orange Lounge Radio, but not before we go around and get everybody's final thought.

702
00:49:49,604 --> 00:49:50,885
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

703
00:49:52,506 --> 00:49:54,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, reject false icons.

704
00:49:54,087 --> 00:49:58,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, the redeeming quality of Captain N was the mother brain and the eggplant wizard.

705
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,451
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, the eggplant wizard did rock.

706
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:02,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Bugged, thank you for being here tonight.

707
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:03,313
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your final thought?

708
00:50:05,874 --> 00:50:06,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

709
00:50:07,215 --> 00:50:08,336
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki, your final thought.

710
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:10,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta play some more.

711
00:50:10,316 --> 00:50:11,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually gotta try Burnout online.

712
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:16,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear that's good, but I need to get my full auto stuff done first.

713
00:50:17,366 --> 00:50:21,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And my final thought is I'm about to be sucked back into Final Fantasy XI.

714
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:22,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Kill me dead!

715
00:50:22,974 --> 00:50:23,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Tick, tick, tick, tick.

716
00:50:23,976 --> 00:50:24,336
