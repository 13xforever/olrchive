Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,600
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We're here on this March the 12th of 2006 with episode number 176.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,880
We had a pretty exciting first half there, talking about all sorts of stuff, the new

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,000
PSP, talking about patching on the Xbox 360, and we're going to kick off this segment with

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,260
some more news.

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,720
Going over to the Xbox 360, Loki?

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,160
Yeah, they're saying there's a story going out on most of the gaming sites out there

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,920
about foil and how it ruined the 360.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,780
Apparently, on the graphics processor heatsink, there is a foil layer left on there, and one

13
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:05,000
German sites out there on the Xbox scene forums he actually opened up his 360 to

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
show that the foil was still on there and saying that the foil left on there

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,080
on the the heat transfer pad is basically acting like a skillet I guess

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,340
and instead of a heatsink so no basically that's kind of backing up the

17
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:29,260
whole you know heatsink over the GPU overheating and that's what caused the

18
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:35,180
Xbox 360 to stop working and yeah I know that one do you think Microsoft is gonna

19
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,620
replace that one well here's basically no the guy that cracked it open oh no no

20
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,620
that they basically there's a follow-up by Microsoft and they've come out with

21
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,480
this it's saying, the video posted by the German blog

22
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,860
gamesstore24.de shows the thermal interface pads that are installed per

23
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,440
specification. This foil eliminates the need

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,600
of a protective liner which simplifies the final assembly process and minimizes

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,640
shipping concerns and contamination

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,740
issues. Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean. Then of course they go on to say

27
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,400
that opening your case voids your

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,640
warranty yada yada yada. No, I thought it enhanced it.

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,080
I thought opening it up and it was full of cookies.

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,520
I thought that let the gnomes come out to play.

31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,280
Stop looking at my shirt!

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,040
I love your underpants gnome shirt.

33
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Thank you.

34
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Now the whole thing is, is it, you know, is the foil actually causing this thing to overheat?

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
We don't know.

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
That's what it comes down to.

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,280
It's just another article out there because...

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,760
It gives better heat spread so you can cook better.

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:48,280
Now, I personally think that it doesn't because I guess if you had something on, you know,

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,160
most of the time like for CPUs and stuff when you're talking like an actual PC, you have

41
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,520
thermal paste in between, some manufacturers will use foil instead because it also allows

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,800
heat transfer from the CPU to the heat sink.

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Well this foil got in the way of that, it possibly could, you know, inhibit the heat

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,780
transfer a little bit and that could cause overheating or you know the foil was meant

45
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,020
to be there who knows we don't know all we know is that something was overheating something

46
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,580
no worky something after the sky very angry when sky get broken xbox 360 and have to send

47
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,480
it back that's for sure if it's not this thing it's something else you know all we need to

48
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,100
know is that it it wasn't working and it's hopefully being fixed and they're hopefully

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,520
going to get the units out there so we can hopefully buy one all right we'll see we'll

50
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,540
Well hopefully Sony is learning from some of these bugs and it looks like they are on

51
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,280
the first steps to getting these machines, the PlayStation 3 is being made, maybe, I

52
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,880
mean it's kind of take this with a grain of salt, but the Chinese website MyDrivers

53
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,360
has reported that a Taiwan manufacturer Compec has received the orders from Sony to start

54
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:08,480
producing the PCI PCB, this would be the printed circuit board for the PlayStation 3.

55
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,420
There is no official announcement from Compaq, but the rumor says that this is going into

56
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,280
production June or July of this year.

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,560
If you are taking this with a grain of salt, just know that MyDrivers is a pretty reputable

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,400
Chinese website, but you know, don't take anybody's word for it until you hear it from

59
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,880
Sony directly, I suppose, with the PlayStation 3.

60
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,920
Sounds like it may be on its way after all, at least the first few steps to getting that

61
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,600
done.

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,320
And let's go over to a Nintendo story.

63
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Why not?

64
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,960
Sakura, what's new on the Nintendo DS?

65
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,200
A bunch of stuff.

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,280
But in this particular, there's a new RPG on the way for the DS.

67
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,300
It's called Contact, and it's a game

68
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,500
about hunting, cooking, fishing, training, collecting,

69
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,320
and romance.

70
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,480
Whoa, hold on a second.

71
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,560
Hunting, training, fishing, all that stuff.

72
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,880
That reminds me of Oregon Trail.

73
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,480
Oregon Trail with love.

74
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,120
With humping.

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
With making babies.

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,640
What?

77
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,080
I hope. You play as someone named Terry

78
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,980
you meet a professor whose spaceship has crashed on a weirdo planet

79
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,880
and you have to collect cells which are the power source for the ship and

80
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,000
they're all over the place you have to go find them.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,080
As you're going you train animals, collect items, play a bunch of mini games

82
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,560
there's real-time combat there's a an online version but they haven't said

83
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,820
anything about how that's gonna work

84
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:38,720
It's being produced by Goichi Suda who is the director of Killer7 and the characters

85
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,440
were designed by Atsuko Fukushima of Popola Cross.

86
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,000
That makes me happy.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,360
There is actually an official site up for it too and it's going to be published by Atlas

88
00:05:52,360 --> 00:06:01,560
in the U.S. No UK release date stated as of yet although they know that it's in development

89
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,120
by Marvelous Interactive and Rising Star

90
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,680
tends to bring over their games in Europe so there's hope for

91
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,560
our European audience. The artwork I have to say though after looking

92
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,400
through the Japanese site it is pretty awesome

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,640
I'm looking forward to it. Sounds cool. Loki!

94
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,280
We touched on some new stuff on Xbox Live

95
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,940
during the first half of the show but set the record straight for us what's

96
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,040
going on on Xbox Live?

97
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,480
A couple new things are coming out actually

98
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,960
first being the outfit the demos hit

99
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,280
Xbox Live you can do multiplayer on there

100
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,600
or split-screen multiplayer those are the only things available

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,060
for right now but definitely worth checking out and of course Ridge Racer 6

102
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,120
demo is now on Xbox Live so you can also check that out as well

103
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,800
not a big fan of those type of games like the outfit but I'll probably check

104
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,400
it out because hey it's free and I heard our buddies over at All Games are really

105
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,840
into it and I was listening to their show and they seem really into it

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,500
The whole thing reminds me of kind of like G.I. Joe, sort of the whole...

107
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
The whole...

108
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Well when you put it that way it sounds kind of cool.

109
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Now you know!

110
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,120
The way the outfit is, I mean, because it's kind of like this, you know, over-exaggerated

111
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,680
like World War II action game where you can call in reinforcements and weapons and stuff

112
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,760
like that and you have all these vehicles that you're riding around in.

113
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,540
It just seems very, I don't know, it seems pretty fun.

114
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,840
I heard that you kind of control a team of four, and I like games where I get to be the

115
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,600
boss so you know maybe I will have to check it out even though war games are

116
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,200
usually not my type of thing of the battle whatever the hell I I I'll give

117
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,620
it a fair shot hell I tried battlefield 2 which is so not my kind of game and I

118
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,740
was very lost when I played it but you know gotta try it get can't knock it

119
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,760
till you tried it right you left yourself way open for a joke shut up not

120
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,400
to shut it right there but why did why did what what right do you have being on

121
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,000
this show tonight are you even a gamer I am okay what was the last game you

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,240
played Diablo 2 like I said okay but but new game burnout oh yeah burnout legends

123
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,140
all right fine I'm just giving you a hard time bugs my buddy I've known him

124
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,740
forever 17 years I had to put up with your show I shut up all right put up

125
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,620
with mine so Loki I'm going back over to you what do you got on Silent Hill

126
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,460
they're working on the Silent Hill 3 team they're working on a new project

127
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:28,100
for PlayStation 3. Duh. So like Silent Hill 5 most likely? Or maybe something

128
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,460
different? Yeah. We just know they're working. They're hard at work again. Yeah.

129
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:39,460
And tomorrow the sun will come out! I mean seriously how stupid of a sort.

130
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,980
It's the third release of Silent Hill 2. They're making another in a really

131
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,380
successful franchise that has a movie coming out that's probably gonna be one

132
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,940
of the first video game movies is actually good.

133
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,940
It's going to be final hill.

134
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,260
No, they're making a sequel?

135
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,740
Oh my god, that's such a shocker.

136
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Did you know what?

137
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,020
Mario Brothers is going to be on the revolution when that comes out too.

138
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,700
In Halo 3 it's coming out on the Xbox 360.

139
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,460
Whoa, shocker.

140
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,620
Okay, seriously.

141
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,700
Alright look, it was making the rounds on game sites so we have to report it.

142
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,700
Alright, do you have something else then, Loki, that might be more worthy of our time?

143
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,700
Maybe?

144
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:26,820
No, actually, yeah, Sega is developing a Playstation 3 launch title, and what would you think?

145
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,820
And you know what?

146
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,780
The sun's gonna set tomorrow, duh!

147
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,780
No it's not.

148
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Yeah, but how many-

149
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,780
I plan on shooting it down out of the sky.

150
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,940
How many golf games does Sega make?

151
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,940
Oh!

152
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Oh, snap!

153
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,940
Oh my god, sorry.

154
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,940
They don't make mocap.

155
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,460
And plus it is- you know what, I don't care how long it's been, it is still weird to hear

156
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,420
of Sega making games for other consoles? I don't care how long it is, it's still weird.

157
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,380
Yes, they're currently developing a crazy money golf game, and actually it's two golf

158
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:02,980
games, I should say. Doesn't sound that exciting to me, but I don't know, maybe it's Sonic

159
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:12,420
Golf or something? I'm sorry, just like everything attached to Sega is just always Sonic? Yeah!

160
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,180
Maybe Ooh La La's Sexy Golf would be awesome.

161
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,740
Or Crazy Taxi Golf.

162
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,780
Let's make some crazy porn!

163
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:25,820
Alright, DarkSakura is going to try and bring us back to Sanity World.

164
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Oh, who am I kidding?

165
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,500
It's her website of the week and you know it's going to be just as crazy as the rest

166
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
of what we've been talking about this evening?

167
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,620
No, it's a serious and important, relevant site that affects everybody's life.

168
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,540
Alright, cue the theme music?

169
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,540
Yes.

170
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:52,600
Today's website of the week is www.cheese.com Yes, the number one resource about cheese.

171
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,180
To quote from the website, cheese is nutritious food made mostly from the milk of cows but

172
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,980
also other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, reindeer, camels, and yaks.

173
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,700
About 4,000 years ago, people started to breed animals and process their milk.

174
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,140
That's when cheese was born.

175
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,660
You can search the database of 654 cheeses by name, country of origin, type of milk used

176
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,180
to produce it, or by texture.

177
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,420
What about head cheese?

178
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,580
Head cheese is actually the brains of a cow.

179
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,980
I know, but does it have information about that?

180
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,500
I think it's talking about dairy cheese.

181
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,340
No from under cheese then.

182
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,280
From under cheese.

183
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:43,240
I want red dwarf.

184
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,000
If anybody found Orange Lounge Radio's on topic-ness for this episode, could you please

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
email us?

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,180
Because we seem to have lost it.

187
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,000
Some of the cheese is listed on this site.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,800
I believe it's behind the caffeine.

189
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,600
Airedale cheese.

190
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,440
We have American cheese, which is really crap.

191
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Atun cheese, we have Babyville, which actually is one of my favorites.

192
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,840
Basket cheese. We even have things on here like curworthy cheese and curd cheese.

193
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,640
I eat about two blocks of parmesan cheese a month.

194
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,240
You used to do that. How about eating your cheese?

195
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,360
That's a gamer snack, easy cheese. I personally love feta cheese

196
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,480
with sun-dried tomatoes on my pizza. What about Velveeta cheese?

197
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,240
Alright. You know what, that's called processed food cheese product.

198
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,440
All right, so this is your website of the week because it's just because it's cheese

199
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,240
caffeinated cheese. Oh, I think I found the on topic. Here we go.

200
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,520
This new game galactic civilizations to it's actually a little bit different. It just came out

201
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,840
a little different in the digital rights management of the way the game is set up because

202
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,360
the license of the game allows you to install the game onto as many machines as you want to

203
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,280
that you own as long as only one copy is being used at once.

204
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,860
Their thought behind this is how many sales are lost because people want to have a game

205
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,240
on their laptop and desktop, but they don't want to have to buy multiple CDs for that.

206
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,600
Being a laptop and desktop owner, I kind of like games like Warcraft that I can put on

207
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,520
both of them, so that's kind of interesting.

208
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,060
The other side of that is this company called Star Force, which is an anti-piracy developer.

209
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,960
They kind of struck a low blow, a story here on oneup.com that was run earlier this week

210
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,320
saying that Star Force, what they did, they actually posted on their company message boards,

211
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,700
again Star Force makes the anti-piracy software, by an admin and they put a link in the post

212
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,580
to a torrent file for Galactic Civilizations 2.

213
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,800
Why would an anti-piracy company be linking torrents?

214
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,780
Well saying in the post, right now several thousands of people are downloading the pirated

215
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,860
version only from that website.

216
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,140
Is it good for the sales?

217
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,140
Unlikely.

218
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,800
So in other words, it was kind of like a bully tactic in a way because they're an anti-piracy

219
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,160
company and they're saying that, oh, this company didn't use our software and here's

220
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
their game being rampantly pirated and how dare they...

221
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Would they sue them?

222
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,600
I don't know what could happen.

223
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,760
Of course, the post is gone now.

224
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,300
And Galactic Civilizations 2 did publish a response saying, our primary weapon to fight

225
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,440
piracy is through rewarding customers through convenient, frequent, free updates.

226
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,240
If you make it easy for users to buy and make full use of your product or service legitimately,

227
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,000
then we believe youíll gain more users from that convenience than youíll lose from piracy.

228
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,080
Very interesting and rebellious stance from this company that I think is very customer

229
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
driven.

230
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,080
I got to say, kind of neat.

231
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,000
Like Star Force needed any more negative publicity, seriously.

232
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What else have they done?

233
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Iím not very familiar with that company.

234
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,360
Theyíre really bad, as far as the techs that they use, I think theyíre one of the companies

235
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:58,320
that had spyware thrown on your PC that basically monitors what you're running, that type of

236
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
thing.

237
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,600
I'm pretty sure that was the same company.

238
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Interesting.

239
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,720
So, they're on the naughty list this week, and we've got Galactic Civilizations 2 on

240
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,800
the nice list for their outside the box thinking on their policy there.

241
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,760
Loki, what else is being developed?

242
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,680
company called Bigfoot Networks is actually just gotten some money to

243
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:28,300
develop what they're saying is going to be the end of all lag lag is gone

244
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,560
they're developing I guess hardware that's gonna be used in conjunction with

245
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,880
online games or god knows what and it will end lag and apparently I don't know

246
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,240
it sounds interesting it's one of those I'll believe it when I see it type

247
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,920
things I definitely hooray for the idea that somebody's gonna try and you know

248
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:56,040
fix the lag problems but can you really know I don't know I'll believe it when I

249
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,960
see it just like you know of course who knew that you could compress something

250
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,640
like the music into the size of an mp3 file until somebody actually did it

251
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,280
that's probably a horrible comparison but I'm just saying is that you know

252
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,920
sometimes things sound too good to be true and then they really do happen it's

253
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,200
It's basically this product that they're releasing called the NetBlazer card.

254
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,160
It's, I guess, going to go on your PC, so... interesting.

255
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,280
I don't know, it's... sounds cool.

256
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,000
I hope it works. Alright. Dark Sakura!

257
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,680
What? Whoa!

258
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,560
Sorry, Miss Thing. You have some updates, well not updates, but an interesting

259
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,800
story on some games that were never released but maybe should have been?

260
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,800
To quote this title, which I think is perfect, cut down in their prime.

261
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
What website is this?

262
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,800
The best games that never were, from a game cloud.

263
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Here's just a list of various games that have been cancelled.

264
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
One was Babylon 5 into the fire, cancelled September 1998,

265
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,800
which was basically a big space simulator.

266
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,800
It would have used some film content from the TV actors,

267
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,920
But it was just dragging along for the development so they axed it

268
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
There was xcom

269
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,240
Genesis it says I cancelled December

270
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,940
1999 I wonder whatever happened to xcom like I played like one or two of them and then it kind of disappeared

271
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,040
I was never like super into xcom like some of my friends were but you know

272
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
I kind of always wondered why there's a

273
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Franchise I'm kind of surprised you haven't seen tried to come back from the dead recently. We have house where to blame for that. Hmm

274
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:41,860
Next up, XCOM Alliance, cancelled sometime in 2001, again another victim of Hasbro.

275
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,540
Daikatana 2, 1999.

276
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,300
Games that should have been cut.

277
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,680
Amen, The Awakening, January 2000.

278
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,840
It was a first person shooter at Cave Dog.

279
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,060
There was an E3 demo at 1999, had a lot of interactive features, but they, well, had

280
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,500
many issues and boop, down it went.

281
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,680
So they focused on total annihilation and then closed down.

282
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:17,120
Ultima Worlds Online, I almost said offline, Ultima Worlds Online cancelled March 2001.

283
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,800
It was by Origin and EA to create a sequel to the first Ultima to do sort of like a sci-fi

284
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,800
fantasy thing but it just they didn't want to pull people off of the original

285
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,160
Ultima online so they... Interesting because then years later of course you

286
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,680
have EverQuest 2 doing battle with EverQuest 1 in a way because people who

287
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,760
built up their characters on EverQuest 1 didn't want to leave so it's kind of

288
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,440
like they saw this with Ultima years ago so it's kind of interesting. Another game

289
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:53,600
canceled with Simsville September 2001. Maxis announced it in 2000 as a mix of

290
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,100
of The Sims and SimCity, um...

291
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,680
but, um...

292
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,520
I actually have an old

293
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,800
copy of, like, SimCity 3000 that has a, like, promo material for it.

294
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,100
Huh. It was like, wow, this looks like it'd be interesting, but I don't know how the hell they're gonna pull it off.

295
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,020
Dude, Bug, do you remember when we used to play SimAnt?

296
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,400
Yes. That game was the shit. The bright yellow ant.

297
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,380
That game was awesome. But it pretty much, uh, instead of doing that, they did The Sims Online and then went on to Sims 2.

298
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,480
which probably was better or worked out better for him

299
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,080
then we had torn

300
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,840
july two thousand when it was canceled it was from interplays uh... black house

301
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,400
studios that would have used the uh...

302
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,280
lift tech engine

303
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,500
uh... hyped up

304
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,960
cancel down

305
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,200
uh... cuz especially interplay hasn't you know the game in two years

306
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,460
uh... duke nukem endangered species canceled two thousand one

307
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,540
uh...

308
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,960
basically cuz they're working on didn't come forever

309
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,420
Um, but they were still, it was, we're still waiting on hello.

310
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:01,860
Um, but there was, uh, a, uh, message by the, uh, 3d realms, uh, CEO on the

311
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,260
planet crap message boards.

312
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,040
That's the best name ever planet crap.

313
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,640
This was a game we had to give our publisher in order to get a

314
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,500
very sweet deal in another areas.

315
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,300
We've since talked to them.

316
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,780
We've since taught them out of it.

317
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:19,900
To answer some questions from chatroom, www.orangelanitrader.com.

318
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,740
Phoenix wants to know why are we talking about games that were cancelled in 2000-2001?

319
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,940
Because the list is the best of all time, or best games that were never, I don't know,

320
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,940
all time.

321
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
And there's more.

322
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,940
Give us real quickly what's left.

323
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:37,900
Sam & Max Freelance Police cancelled March 2004, Trinity in 2003, it was sort of a response

324
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,300
Sir, Return of Castle Wolfenstein,

325
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,840
SWAT Urban Justice, canceled 2003,

326
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,260
Mythica, February 2004,

327
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,360
Ultimate X Odyssey, 2004,

328
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,600
Black Nine, sometime in 2003.

329
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,440
Interesting feedback from our chat room.

330
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,660
I think they were starting to shout out

331
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,040
some other games that came to mind.

332
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,020
Ryoma says, the Zelda demo with Ganon.

333
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,760
It was, I guess, a while back there was that demo,

334
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,660
you know, the old, was it on GameCube?

335
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,680
That first demo that they had?

336
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,080
I'm trying to remember which one he's referencing

337
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,700
because there's a couple that come to mind there.

338
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,440
SpiritSnare says they canceled Nintendo puzzle collection,

339
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,820
Panel de Pon forever,

340
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,760
but they released Pokemon Channel instead.

341
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,340
Interesting.

342
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,620
Oh, and Ryoma and GK128 are joining in,

343
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,020
and Earthbound 64, but GK128 pointing out

344
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,740
Earthbound 64 was canned,

345
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,620
but it came back on the GBA in Japan.

346
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,400
And of course, one that I can interject as well,

347
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,020
remember the Final Fantasy VI in 3D demo?

348
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,540
A very brief demo that was on Nintendo 64 or something,

349
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,340
Iíve actually still been trying to hunt that down.

350
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:46,260
I saw it ages ago, an emulation site had that.

351
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,920
This was another game I was actually interested in, it was Robotech Crystal Dreams.

352
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:56,740
The developer of that game actually has the ROM for it up on his website and his 3D models

353
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,740
available.

354
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,100
Iíll see if I can hunt that down for folks in the chat room.

355
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,440
One thing that people have been waiting a little while to see a game made out of this

356
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,980
is Family Guy.

357
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,160
That's right, a high voltage software is going to be developing a Family Guy game for Take

358
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,060
Two Entertainment.

359
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,520
They're going to be doing some video games there based on Family Guy, and I'm assuming

360
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,920
that it's actually going to be multi-platform.

361
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,580
I think I read somewhere here it's multi-platform, so you're probably going to see, I would say

362
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,980
it's probably going to be a very similar deal to what you see with the Simpsons games, but

363
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,520
Hopefully better games than what we got with the Simpsons games because they're only a couple like hit and run was okay

364
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,580
But you know

365
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,460
Most of the Simpsons games were kind of poopy the good old arcade game. Oh, well, yeah the arcade game

366
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,640
It owns everything but you know, all right

367
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,540
So what do you think what what family guy game because I know you're a huge family guy fan Loki

368
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,060
What kind of game would you like to see them do besides do he takes over the universe personally?

369
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,980
I think it would be great any family guy game because family guy at least unlike the Simpsons

370
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,860
they're willing to be violent and you know push the boundaries so I think it

371
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,100
would be if you made like a I don't know I personally want to see another arcade

372
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:16,140
game is like is this family guy jumping the shark though I think it's I wouldn't

373
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,900
really want my you know I wouldn't really want to see a family guy game

374
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,780
just because I'm afraid of what they do with it but if it's done right then hell

375
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,740
yeah ryoma set in our chat room in orange on

376
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,820
It's going to be Peter Farting, Stewie Cursing, Brian Drinking, Chris Whining, Meg Also Whining,

377
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,400
Lois Cleaning Up After Everyone's Crap, and Quagmire Being Generally Horny.

378
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,680
So it'll just be the show.

379
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,580
There should be a Quagmire game.

380
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,220
And Xander C. says, you know what they need to make a video game out of?

381
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,220
Orange Lounge Radio.

382
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,320
Didn't we have somebody a while back that was going to make a text adventure game based

383
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,780
on Orange Lounge Radio or something?

384
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,540
We need our own RPG.

385
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,100
We need to fire up RPG Creator and make something, it'll be interesting.

386
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,100
It's harder than it sounds.

387
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
I know.

388
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,380
Hey, you know what guys, if you want to do something like that and get our eternal worship,

389
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,380
go for it.

390
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,820
We'll put it on our MySpace or something, who knows.

391
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:15,380
Alright, moving on to another story, let's go on over to Loki, who has another possible

392
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,660
movie jumping to the game world.

393
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:27,300
Well, you know, Quentin Tarantino in video games, that's something you don't really

394
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
hear that often.

395
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,980
Please say Kill Bill The Game.

396
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
No.

397
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
Damn.

398
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,980
Kill Bill The Game.

399
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,580
No, the theme of this year's games coming out are old, classic, violent movies made

400
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,580
into games.

401
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,100
Like you have The Godfather, Scarface, and now Reservoir Dogs.

402
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Yes.

403
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
Reservoir Dogs The Game.

404
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,540
Reservoir Dogs The Game.

405
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,060
So lots of cursing, shooting, and black and white.

406
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:56,860
It's going to be based on the movie and it's being developed by Blitz Games.

407
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,580
It's going to be primarily a third-person shooter, but we'll incorporate some driving

408
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:12,380
elements as well as the torture scene where Michael Madsen reprises his role of Mr. Blonde

409
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,680
in third-person shooter involving some driving.

410
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,480
Why does Nark come to mind for some crazy reason?

411
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
You know what comes to mind for me?

412
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,480
What?

413
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Enter the Matrix.

414
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,680
Oh, that's kind of weird.

415
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,800
Because it involves driving and shooting and general suckage.

416
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,600
I like to enter the Matrix.

417
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,880
Again, is this jumping the shark?

418
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,960
Probably.

419
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
It's just a trend.

420
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,600
I mean, it's just like Scarface.

421
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Into the shark.

422
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
So.

423
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
I would much...

424
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Just like Jaws!

425
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,640
Speaking of jumping the shark, the Jaws game is coming out later this year.

426
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,000
Somebody was just telling me about that game the other night, that they're eagerly awaiting

427
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
that game.

428
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Jaws jumped the shark when Jaws 2 came out.

429
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,040
have a jaws 3d with jaws they actually have like a dismemberment engine and

430
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,920
you can dismember people in 25 different places

431
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,120
did you play as the shark you play as the show now that's pretty cool have you

432
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,680
been

433
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,000
I I told you

434
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,880
school well no they showed it at e3 I could have sworn we went looked at I

435
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,840
didn't go look at that cuz I was busy

436
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,200
or in myself out to Sega I like echo the dolphin on rabies

437
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:17,200
I was in the line for the PS3, that's where I was.

438
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Alright, alright.

439
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,480
Moving on, did you guys hear this?

440
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,820
In China they are rising up and starting a revolution, in World of Warcraft that is.

441
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,360
Game unions have threatened to quit playing World of Warcraft because it has to do with

442
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,600
unstable servers and it's just going crazy.

443
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,240
Now it's important to note that Blizzard really doesn't oversee the servers.

444
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,460
In China, it's actually maintained by a company called The9, and they charge gamers by the

445
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,220
hour to play World of Warcraft.

446
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:58,960
The9 is having a lot of problems solving technical issues related to the game, and they're not

447
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,380
seeking Blizzard's help all the time there.

448
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:07,180
Gamers are getting pissed off at severe time delays, long queue times, and frozen server.

449
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:14,380
Right now, WoW has about 530,000 players on it, and they're about ready to just rise up

450
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,380
and quit playing the game.

451
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,900
They're going to vote with their wallets.

452
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:25,940
So just so you know, if you thought we had long queues on some of the servers here in

453
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,540
America, just remember, it could always be worse.

454
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,900
DarkSakura traveling around the world there, what's going on in the UK, your UK update?

455
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,840
a few things there is a zombie MMO on its way by thinking man studios cool

456
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,760
it's a survival horror MMORPG that lets you play either as a human or

457
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,660
flesh-eating zombie it's titled ex animus which is a Latin for without life

458
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,600
for people who don't know that is there a button for yelling brains I don't

459
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,420
think a zombie would really have the mental capacity to be able to say brains

460
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:05,060
they just go like that I just noticed last night that the zombies in Diablo 2

461
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:11,300
to say brains they do it was creepy well the only speaking zombies we have in like

462
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:17,420
the Resident Evil universe is just like a stars anyway back to the story and you

463
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,900
should be able to expect to see half rotten corpses walking around tearing

464
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,800
apart the bodies of the living for food and there is a website that's stating it

465
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,100
will be competitively priced to other MMOs currently on the market the game is

466
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:39,460
only in development for the PC but for a max xbox 360 or ps3 version they say you

467
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,740
never know with technology always changing we are always interested in

468
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:47,100
finding new outlets for people to play no yet word of a release date and the

469
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,020
screenshots out but there is a site and I'll be linking it to our chat room

470
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,820
shortly I personally want to play as a zombie so I can go around eating people

471
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,420
you know tearing off limbs beating them with one of the dead oh yeah we need

472
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:07,480
Sean of the Dead the game. That's actually a brilliant idea. Next up Sony is removing

473
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:14,120
PSP posters. It's a particular poster that advises consumers to take a running

474
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,280
jump from tram and train stations across the country after transport staff

475
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:24,040
expressed safety concerns. The poster was part of a recent advertising campaign to

476
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,560
promote the PSP in the UK. It featured a plain white background with red text that

477
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,180
said take a running jump from here there's been actually a bunch of other

478
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:37,320
ones are kind of teasing at the changes that are being made with the PSP like

479
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,080
you know kind of remember the ones we mentioned like well a couple weeks ago

480
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,680
about pictures and stuff interesting hmm well a little bit more on this a rail

481
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,060
worker saw the poster to Tran platform at Metro links Manchester Piccadilly

482
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:57,260
station and decided there was a safety issue and tried to have it covered they

483
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,260
saw it so it looks inappropriate and to quote on here the message goes

484
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,300
completely against all of our safety messages particularly because

485
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,460
PlayStation is aimed at youngsters and we are constantly telling them not to

486
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,940
trespass so Sony has taken steps down to remove the posters from the tram

487
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:21,140
stations lastly guess what we've got huh we have release dates which would be

488
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:28,060

Sweet.

497
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,360
Loki, anything we should be looking forward to in the US to follow that up?

498
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,740
Yeah, there's actually some pretty cool stuff coming out this week.

499
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:24,340
parallel lines coming out of Playstation 2 and Xbox. It's supposed to not suck, but we'll

500
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:31,340
see. Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence, of course, really awesome, and if you're into kids games,

501
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:38,140
I guess, Ice Age 2 the Meltdown. Oh, to match the movie, it's coming out. Well, yeah, the

502
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:45,140
movie's coming out later this year, but I don't know. Not too much else coming out.

503
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:50,420
What have you heard about 24 the game? I'm kind of curious about this even though I've fallen behind on watching the actual show just

504
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,740
Because I really haven't watched a lot of TV recently

505
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,940
I mean not even the shows I used to watch like all the time like even like I

506
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,740
I'll admit I watch survivor like every week. I haven't been watching it like nothing. It's it's really weird um

507
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:08,620
But how's 24 the game supposed to be have you heard anything about this? I know the reviews weren't that great really hmm. That's too bad

508
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,640
This is gonna seem really random

509
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,460
But of course we are an interactive show and sometimes the chat room is going to a dictate the way we go on the show

510
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,260
here a Phoenix in our chat room and orange on twitter.com says this kid at my school got caught wanking in the bathroom to porn on

511
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:27,640
His PSP in response to the PSP a bit that a dark soccer had to say but that made me think of this clip

512
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,840
That's going around the internet this week

513
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,000
have you guys seen this the guy that's playing World of Warcraft and the friends sneak up on him and he's he's he's

514
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,120
He's wanking to the sexy night elf dancing, the female night elf, have you guys seen this

515
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
on YouTube?

516
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
No.

517
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Oh god.

518
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
No.

519
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
Now I sound like I'm crazy.

520
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,800
But hopefully people in chatroom know what I'm talking about here.

521
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:51,160
But it's kind of like, it looks like it might be fake, I don't know, go to YouTube and search

522
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
for it.

523
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,760
I think it might be staged a little bit because it's almost a little too convenient that they

524
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,080
walked in on this guy who had his door open and stuff.

525
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,080
But nevertheless it sure seems to be making the rounds on the internet this week because

526
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,580
I saw it posted in like three different forums. So I don't know that comment made me think of that. Where have you been posting?

527
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
World of wank.com

528
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Loki yes

529
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,060
You also have another worldly story for us. Yes, it's

530
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Interesting basically

531
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,300
Nintendo is

532
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Nintendo is going to suit the Dutch

533
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,580
What do they do this time? Everyone's always picking on the Dutch, you know?

534
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,540
Hey, I'm half Dutch. My husband's Dutch, and you know what his

535
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:40,100
grandfather says? If you ain't Dutch, you ain't much.

536
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,700
Well I know I use a stage name on this show, but if you know my real last name, it's very

537
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:50,300
Dutch, so you know, you can kind of tell. Basically, long story short, they did a political

538
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:58,780
ad for when they're, um, one of the politicians running and of course, parodying Mario Brothers,

539
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,780
so.

540
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,100
Wait, so why are the Dutch getting, why are they suing the political party over this?

541
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
Because it's the Dutch.

542
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,500
Wait, wait, run this by me again, what happened?

543
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:14,380
Political party did an advertisement, um, I guess bashing one of their competitors or

544
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:19,380
whatever, um, running, using like a Mario Brothers type of thing.

545
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:24,280
Okay, I get it. Do we have a clip or anything? No, it's Dutch. Well, damn.

546
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,640
All right. Well, um, you know, I guess it's nice to know that there's many Su happy companies in the gaming industry. Who knows?

547
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,600
What about parody and all that stuff? Can't you?

548
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,400
Well, I don't know. I guess that's American thing. I don't know about Dutch law,

549
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,840
but shouldn't there be room for fair parody and all that stuff?

550
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,560
No, not when you're talking about Mario Brothers. I guess not, sheesh. Parody and satire. I found it.

551
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Oh, you found the clip?

552
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
It's on YouTube.

553
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,560
The World of Warcraft clip or the Dutch clip?

554
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,560
I don't want to watch it right now, but link our chatters.

555
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
I will link our chatters.

556
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Alright, let's go over to

557
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
God of War 2.

558
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
It's coming out.

559
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,560
That's pretty much all we have to say about that at this time.

560
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
It is coming out, and

561
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Game Informer Magazine actually has some

562
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
screens from it.

563
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Also, something to note, it is coming out for

564
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
PlayStation 2.

565
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,760
uh...

566
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,800
not going that's pretty awesome except i haven't got my freaking game former

567
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,400
magazine issues in the last three months

568
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,020
dammit him why would happen

569
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,940
stupid

570
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,240
people

571
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,700
uh... they just don't freaking uh...

572
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,600
they just don't love you and i love me

573
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,700
i guess so

574
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,700
all right well i'm sure that gets you in a pretty angry mood when we get angry we

575
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,480
have to get ranti so that means kids it's time for the f use of the week

576
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,160
Dark Sockra, are you ready to get your hate on?

577
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,920
Yeah, although this Dutch thing is really funny.

578
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:57,920
Good Dutch rolls.

579
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:06,280
I'd have to say that my a few of the week goes towards

580
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,520
I would have to say the whole

581
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,500
American work ethic.

582
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:22,500
As in, well not necessarily the work ethic, but the attitude that corporations, different companies place on overworking employees, you know?

583
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:29,500
I think it's in the Netherlands that the government has mandatory four weeks paid vacation.

584
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,500
We're here, what are we given, what, ten days, fifteen days, something like that?

585
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
And that's including sick time.

586
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Yet, they're just as productive as we are.

587
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:49,200
So yeah, that's uh, you know, they wonder why we have the highest, uh, you know, amount of, uh, stress leave granted to employees is because THEY'RE BURNING US OUT!

588
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,300
So take a vacation.

589
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,400
Alright, that it?

590
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah, that's been my F.U. of the entire week.

591
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,700
Alright, Loki!

592
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:07,500
Uh, fuck you to the full auto multiplayer servers and for the people that constantly disconnect mid-race because they're losing and they suck.

593
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,220
It makes it really hard for me to get these last two achievements if people keep quitting

594
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,260
the races and they're not counting.

595
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,200
Get me a 360, I'll help you with that.

596
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,660
I want to give an FU to movie prices, because that's really why I haven't been to the movies

597
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,660
in forever.

598
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:29,100
Let's see, I can pay $9.25 to go see a movie in the theater, or I can pay less than twice

599
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,180
that to get a Netflix account and watch movies on my pretty HDTV.

600
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,140
Bug, do you have any FUs?

601
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:44,140
Just a few that are not having a job, still, since May, but I do have an interview this

602
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,140
week.

603
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
You want to make your plea?

604
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,420
We have a lot of people listening to this show, maybe some in the Bay Area.

605
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,900
What are your qualifications?

606
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,900
Unix admin.

607
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,900
Alright.

608
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,740
If you want to offer Bug the job, send us an email.

609
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,740
With real money?

610
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,860
He's actually a really smart computer guy.

611
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,740
You know how everybody has that friend that they call when they need their computer fixed?

612
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,740
That's Bug.

613
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,700
I call Bug when Loki's not available.

614
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,880
It really depends on what the issue is, bugged I call for most of my issues.

615
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,420
Also I had one more I forgot, FU did my work for blocking all internet access except for

616
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,760
a few select sites and this is not really, I understand why they're doing it because

617
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,420
there's a lot of people slacking off at work and going on MySpace and stuff like that.

618
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,500
But the problem is also the sites I use for my information on games and stuff and to update

619
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,540
our interoffice forms and stuff is being blocked and I have to constantly email them like for

620
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:40,400
example, IGN. You don't really understand how many subdomains there are to IGN until

621
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,860
you actually have it blocked and try to have them unblock it. There's like 60 different

622
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,620
domains on there and they have to unblock all of them. And they're arguably saying,

623
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:53,340
oh, some of these are for ads and we don't want to unlock two ads. Well, then I don't

624
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:58,460
get pictures on that site and GameSpot, same thing. I don't have pictures on the site anymore

625
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,180
and all the site formatting is all messed up now because they blocked all this stuff.

626
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,900
And also the other thing too, they blocked all search engines, so if you're looking for

627
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,860
information that might not be on those sites, oh, you're screwed.

628
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,420
How about instead of blocking the entire internet, they just block MySpace?

629
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,020
Or maybe they should just block the sites that they don't want people to go to, which

630
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,740
I've insisted they do in the first place, but the conspiracy theory around the office

631
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:26,940
is they're doing it to make work uncomfortable so people will leave.

632
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,100
Now can you still play solitaire on the computers?

633
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,100
Yeah.

634
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,260
Well, what did they fix then?

635
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,740
make sure you don't play with the government when it comes through what

636
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,320
they did in my work is that there is actually a corporate software that they

637
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,540
can have go in with Internet Explorer that blocks certain sites registered as

638
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,940
a certain type exactly that's what they did in this site but they blocked even

639
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:51,740
stuff that was registered as movies slash TV which is our business I mean

640
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,660
come on but it's just gotten to ridiculous level they've taken they've

641
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:02,460
I've taken this whole back-asswards approach to try to solve the problem.

642
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,900
You know how I know that we made it, though, in the business?

643
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:11,540
OrangeLonsRadio.com finally got blocked by Websense at one point for being an internet

644
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,540
fan club or something.

645
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,940
I can still access it at work.

646
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,500
I know, but I couldn't access it at one of our vendor companies because I guess they

647
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,100
have a high level of restriction on Websense, and we get picked up.

648
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Interesting, huh?

649
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,100
Lucky you.

650
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:31,520
I know. Well it's excellent though. I can't wait to explain to my boss why certain things

651
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,580
take longer than usual now. You just have to give justification. That's what it's all

652
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:41,420
about. Once management starts fussing things will change. When it starts affecting how

653
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,380
management looks, oh yeah, they'll make a change. When they can't hit their girly porn,

654
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:53,380
they'll fix it. Alright, let's move on and get back into some news here. Loki, Konami

655
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:59,860
what are they up to they're up to making some stuff no they're they're get they're jumping

656
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:08,020
on the nintendo's bandwagon that's right konami's making another dog simulator game including a

657
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:15,700
touch mode and stuff the only difference is it's for pc okay well that's different that dog looks

658
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:22,220
like it's peeing that dog looks fat yes all the pictures of this game look like they all look

659
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:31,300
like the dog is taking a crap. It's true! What is the game? Pooping Dog? It's Dog Station

660
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,860
is what it is. This looks like a great game for me to poop on. Why can't I make a cat

661
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:44,980
game? So seriously, it's like dog picture dog pooping. Dog picture dog pooping. I guess

662
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:50,460
it's the way he's sitting. I don't know. Dog poop is funny. If I remember correctly though,

663
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,780
I believe Dog Station was an arcade game, I want to say, because I know that Dog Station

664
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,660
is a franchise that they have out there right now.

665
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,500
I'm not exactly sure what you do, but Dark Tetsuya in chat agrees with you.

666
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,900
But it's interesting.

667
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,860
So it'd be like Nintendogs at work.

668
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,540
Next you're going to be getting Boonga Boonga, the home version.

669
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,540
Gross.

670
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,660
If you don't know what that is, good.

671
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,660
You're lucky.

672
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Ah, Dark Sakura.

673
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,660
What?

674
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,460
You have an interesting story about a game I've been looking forward to. I don't know

675
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,220
much about it

676
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,460
but it still sounds fascinating to me, just the little I have heard about it.

677
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,340
Why do you need it?

678
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,140
I think I do. I think we could all use a little bit of it.

679
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,780
What is it? Brain training!

680
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,820
Brain training is,

681
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,060
actually there was an announcement in the

682
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:49,820
Mainichi daily news, which I think is funny because Mainichi also means every day. Anyway, um, it's

683
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,340
basically

684
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:58,660
To help your brain fire on all of the nerve structures and all doctors are recommending it to the elderly

685
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,820
to help stimulate their brain

686
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,000
There's a memory loss clinic at Kyoto's Uchida hospital

687
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,820
for patients suffering dementia

688
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:19,480
They got a hold of the DS's and brain training and are using it to try to help people get

689
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,560
brain function back.

690
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,560
There's a quote from a 67 year old patient named Isamu Shishido who said that he hoped

691
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,640
the game would help him stop forgetting things like names and phone numbers so his daughter

692
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,700
will stop making fun of him.

693
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,960
To quote, I don't want to end up some crazy old man, I want to play a little every day

694
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,500
before going to bed.

695
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,220
He said, this isn't even reasonable stuff, Nintendo basically though is using this as

696
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,940
an excuse to point out again that people of all ages like Spring Training Software and

697
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:56,100
that they're trying to use this strategy to try and appeal to existing games, you know,

698
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,700
gamers who are out of it, non-gamers, trying to basically appeal to the whole broad market

699
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,900
of gamers as this is something you can use to...

700
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,020
I can't help but think myself, is this going to be the next game that really crosses that

701
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,180
gap and gets everybody in on it, like Tetris?

702
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,620
Well the theory is it's actually a publicity stunt because Nintendo is housed in Kyoto.

703
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:26,440
But you know, if it's going to pretty much help with, you know, because we're first marketing

704
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:32,140
it to younger people and people of slow learning capacity, but if this is something that's

705
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:37,860
going to also help keep the minds of older people sharp to hold off some of the effects

706
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:45,620
of old age, then who are we to tell them not to do it?

707
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:51,540
If it's actually helping people, if it does good, they should go for it.

708
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,900
Some folks in our chat room might disagree with the brain training setting the stage

709
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,980
to be a huge game.

710
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,380
Funny Dale in our chat room says, brain training, with that name alone, it's a sure bet that

711
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,240
it'll fail in the USA I think it's good I think brain Olympics would have been a

712
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,360
but then you get you fight with the Olympic Committee over something like

713
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,040
that but because people love the only well actually I don't know the Olympics

714
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,680
are pretty poor rated this year on HBO how these have brain games I remember a

715
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,640
Fox special that was on something like how smart is America or the great

716
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,840
American quiz when this couple years ago they had this show on it was like a big

717
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,640
20 question quiz show no control was far better

718
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:33,240
whatever Colin Quinn just attach the name American Idol to brain training and

719
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:40,640
as much as pop star pop idol and as opposites that that probably sounds you

720
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:48,060
know American Idol does well in the ratings all right um let's go for like

721
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,980
brain food all right let's uh we're kind of winding down here with orange lounge

722
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,060
radio this week but first off a chance for anybody to get out any stories they

723
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:01,760
haven't done yet before we get into tonight's last story I got one okay this

724
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,320
is gonna become well actually it should piss off a lot of people according to a

725
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,420
post on xbox.com there is an internal Best Buy document and we know how

726
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:17,860
wonderful those are stating that the new premium systems will now include a

727
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,540
a hundred gigabyte hard drive instead of a twenty gigabyte hard drive.

728
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,540
What?

729
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,700
Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

730
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:31,100
Exactly, bastards. And this is supposed to coincide with the DirecTV

731
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,740
downloadable

732
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:38,620
thing that's supposed to be... Fucking bastards, I mean...

733
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:42,020
Because Final Fantasy XI, when that comes out, it's going to eat up all your hard drive

734
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:47,600
space. You're not going to have room for anything like... Look at it this way, with the

735
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,720
with the Xbox 360 being white, it'll really show where you scraped it right across your

736
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,600
ass because you hate it.

737
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:02,000
So, I'm taking it as a rumor for now, but I can see this happening.

738
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Alright, uh, last story of the night, Loki, what's the exciting news this week?

739
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,980
If you're a fan of really cheesy crap that's on TV, you might remember a show called Captain

740
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,580
N. I remember how awful that show was.

741
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:21,940
right the NES era cartoon featuring Kevin Kean normal teenager battling the

742
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:28,140
evil mother brain in video land it's coming in I remember how awful they

743
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:32,540
characterized everybody because it was like making me a mega high and made

744
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:38,660
Simon Belmont into this whole narcissistic glam boy I couldn't I can

745
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:43,780
see that though it was awful sorry but Simon Belmont looks like launch pad from

746
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:48,940
from DuckTales. Oh my god he does. The only good thing about that show is when they went

747
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:55,780
to the whole Zelda universe and they actually got the same voice actors for Link and Zelda.

748
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,580
Oh from the, yeah. And I thought the character models were pretty good. So what's the deal

749
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,140
we can down? It jumped the shark with the Game Boy. What's the deal with Captain N DVD?

750
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:09,900
Coming to DVD? Oh Jesus when? Don't have a when yet but it is coming to DVD. So to put

751
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,460
next to your Zelda cartoons from the Super Mario Super Show this is also put

752
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:19,500
out by the same people that did I believe what was it I remember the show

753
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:27,820
now it was cops the animated series I liked cops which I might add got horrible

754
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:33,180
reviews and the transfer sounds like was all those busters versus Ghostbusters

755
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:39,420
but the the whole thing about the captain is it for anybody who ever paid

756
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:46,460
attention to the actual storylines to the games. It was like a big ol' insult.

757
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:51,200
I just want to clarify some things in the chatroom there. The statement there coming

758
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,280
from a couple of people, I'll read Sephiroth1215's line here. The HDDs aren't even 20 gigs, it

759
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,140
was like 16. This is because of the emulator that's pre-installed on the drive.

760
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:05,060
Oh yeah, they forgot to mention that when they're selling you the 20 gig hard drive.

761
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:09,260
By the way, there's already a big fat emulator on here that you can't really get rid of.

762
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:15,260
And also, it's pre-loaded with a bunch of songs, too, like I had to go through and delete all the stuff,

763
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:20,260
because I actually loaded a custom soundtrack on my machine for when I'm playing the little Bejeweleds and Zumas and stuff.

764
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:24,260
I put a custom soundtrack on there, so I had to delete all the crap that was already on there.

765
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,260
Frustrating.

766
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:30,260
And I thought the way the Xbox handled the memory management was way better than 360,

767
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,260
because in 360 you have to dive into all the submenus to erase something, it's just very frustrating.

768
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:38,260
There's no global disk erase menu.

769
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,260
Why would you want to erase anything ever?

770
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,260
I don't know.

771
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,260
Well kids, it's about time to wrap up this edition of Orange Lounge Radio,

772
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,260
but not before we go around and get everybody's final thought.

773
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,260
DarkSakura, your final thought?

774
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,260
Number one, reject false icons.

775
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:58,260
Number two, the redeeming quality of Captain Inn was the Mother Brain and the Eggplant Wizard.

776
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,260
That's true, the Eggplant Wizard did rock.

777
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,260
Bug, thank you for being here tonight. What's your final thought?

778
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,260
I don't know.

779
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:11,020
alright Loki your final thought I gotta play some more I actually gotta try

780
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:16,020
burnout online I hear that's good but I need to get my full auto stuff done

781
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:21,380
first and my final thought is I'm about to be sucked back into Final Fantasy 11

782
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:27,220
