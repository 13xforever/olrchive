[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

15
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:19,734
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back with Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, the part of the show where we keep things going here that's too hot for the podcast.

16
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, all the personal stuff, stuff about our personal lives.

17
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:29,977
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, tonight's show is actually very long, though, so we don't have a whole lot of time, and we do want to do a cage match tonight.

18
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,351
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Which makes me very relieved.

20
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:06,818
[SPEAKER_09]: The first night there, we went to Waffle House, which Dan wasn't thrilled about.

21
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:08,880
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was like, Ash Browns!

22
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:10,863
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had Waffle House.

23
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:13,907
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the next day, we went to Cracker Barrel, which Dan liked.

24
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:17,932
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had fried okra and fried catfish and fried everything else.

25
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:32,326
[SPEAKER_09]: And we went to see my ex-roommates, my mama-san and my papa-san, who took care of me during a really difficult time.

26
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:39,650
[SPEAKER_09]: And we went to the Atlanta Bread Company for dinner that night, but we weren't before closing, so they weren't all that great.

27
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,552
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Steak and Shake, where their food is awful.

28
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:44,733
[SPEAKER_09]: They have chili on the spaghetti.

29
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:47,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you can get full-on marinara sauce and chili.

30
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:48,808
[SPEAKER_09]: on the spaghetti.

31
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:49,689
[SPEAKER_09]: It's horrible.

32
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:54,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Their fries are awful, but their milkshakes are the best ever.

33
00:05:54,831 --> 00:06:02,315
[SPEAKER_09]: They do this thing called the side-by-side, which I had a banana and dark chocolate milkshake and mixed them, and it was fabulous.

34
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:05,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not eat my Blue Bell ice cream, but I did have boiled peanuts.

35
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:12,800
[SPEAKER_09]: We also ate at a place called Cooper T's, and it's a very weird thing sharing beer with my brother

36
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:17,396
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to be 22 this month.

37
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:20,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday, Matt.

38
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:24,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I also found out my brother Phillip is on a naval boat.

39
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:25,558
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a Marine.

40
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:28,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Somewhere in Asia, somewhere.

41
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:39,021
[SPEAKER_09]: He's supposed to be going, I think, to Hokkaido, then down to Okinawa, then around the China coast, and then back home.

42
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:41,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Doing something or the other, I don't know.

43
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I just told him to bring me back stuff.

44
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:48,811
[SPEAKER_09]: and we also went to the Mobile Museum of Art, which was very nice.

45
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:53,934
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a lot of local art there too, as well as some very nice classics.

46
00:06:53,974 --> 00:06:55,995
[SPEAKER_09]: There was even a couple of Renoir there.

47
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:57,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Really nice stuff.

48
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:00,358
[SPEAKER_09]: We also...

49
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually born in Dothan.

50
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:15,465
[SPEAKER_09]: We went to go see my dad and my granny, and they conveniently forgot that I am on a low-carb eating plan and vegetarian, so they had steak and pecan pie.

51
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:18,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I ate some steak to make my daddy happy.

52
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:21,868
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty good, made me very ill, and pecan pie, which was very yummy.

53
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:29,132
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was very interesting meeting my dad's new fiancÃ©e, one of several.

54
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:31,013
[SPEAKER_09]: She was nice, though.

55
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:31,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I like her.

56
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:32,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'd be happy.

57
00:07:33,448 --> 00:07:34,009
[SPEAKER_09]: And we went back.

58
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I had my bowl of peanuts.

59
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,009
[SPEAKER_09]: We went and ate at Ruby Tuesday's.

60
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,431
[SPEAKER_09]: The next day, we go to Winslow's Oyster House.

61
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:43,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I eat fried oysters, and I'm happy.

62
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:45,552
[SPEAKER_09]: My uncle's there, gives us Mardi Gras stuff.

63
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:48,333
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we flew home that day.

64
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:51,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very horrible plane ride.

65
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:57,135
[SPEAKER_09]: I was up in the air for six hours, running into a headwind with massive turbulence.

66
00:07:57,395 --> 00:08:00,676
[SPEAKER_09]: It was to suck, but I did watch most of Hellboy.

67
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,431
[SPEAKER_09]: That movie's pretty cool.

68
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:08,977
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, Dan played lots of Phoenix Wright, and I played lots of Animal Crossing.

69
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I went on a trip.

70
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:12,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Virginia.

71
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:13,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have a nice fall?

72
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:14,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, shut up.

73
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:18,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a list of things I did for the first time that might make you a little bit proud.

74
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:21,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we're from the West Coast.

75
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:23,148
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have some of this stuff, so it's all new to us.

76
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:24,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I ate at a Sonic.

77
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:26,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never eaten at a Sonic before.

78
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:26,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.

79
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,030
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a wide selection of stuff.

80
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,850
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one in Yuba City.

81
00:08:29,251 --> 00:08:32,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I still have never eaten there, and that's 40 minutes away for those playing along at home.

82
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:37,194
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one that's going in by Arco.

83
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:39,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not bad, so, you know, check it out.

84
00:08:39,956 --> 00:08:40,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It's across from the Hooters.

85
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's the other thing.

86
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I ate at a Chick-fil-A for the first time.

87
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:45,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

88
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:56,883
[SPEAKER_09]: A.K.A.

89
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:57,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Carl's Jr.

90
00:08:58,904 --> 00:08:59,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Carl's Jr.

91
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:00,285
[SPEAKER_03]: is nasty.

92
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:01,165
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Carl's Jr.

93
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:02,086
[SPEAKER_03]: is way better than Hardee's.

94
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,727
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm saying it's Carl's Jr.

95
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:04,327
[SPEAKER_09]: but nasty.

96
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you guys on the East Coast, you have it.

97
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:07,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Carl's Jr.

98
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:07,989
[SPEAKER_03]: is way better.

99
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:09,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you go to Crystal?

100
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Three words, Western Bacon.

101
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,771
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they didn't have that there.

102
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:14,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least I didn't find it.

103
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:15,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, what else did I do in Virginia?

104
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to an aquarium there.

105
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:18,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just put it this way.

106
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:20,295
[SPEAKER_03]: The coolest thing at the aquarium was the birdcage.

107
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:22,434
[SPEAKER_03]: You go figure that one out.

108
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:24,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went to the beach.

109
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:26,197
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first time I'd really been to the East Coast Beach.

110
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:29,820
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I did it a second time because I went to Fire Island years ago.

111
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,822
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just a couple of years ago I went to Fire Island very randomly.

112
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:33,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your mind out of the gutter.

113
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,045
[SPEAKER_03]: We just walked around the beach, if you know what that is.

114
00:09:37,915 --> 00:09:41,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you know what that is, hats off to you.

115
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, let's see, what else did I do in Virginia?

116
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:45,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot.

117
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I camped out in the hotel most of the time.

118
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:48,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I ate and ate a lot of food.

119
00:09:48,185 --> 00:09:50,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I gained about five pounds on my trip, so I'm not proud of that.

120
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:52,769
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll be working it off pretty soon.

121
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:55,532
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it.

122
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:56,513
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I really want to share.

123
00:09:57,193 --> 00:09:57,714
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cold.

124
00:09:58,094 --> 00:09:58,454
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

125
00:09:58,494 --> 00:10:00,016
[SPEAKER_03]: For the first time in my life,

126
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,031
[SPEAKER_03]: We found a DJ.

127
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:30,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I quit Final Fantasy XI, and that was pretty tough.

128
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:32,939
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to the shell?

129
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:34,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you able to pass that off to somebody else?

130
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,400
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

131
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:44,026
[SPEAKER_03]: So they better be careful who they add, because they can't delete anybody, and they can't create new... They'll just create another shell, I don't care, whatever.

132
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:48,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then, I played a lot of Full Auto.

133
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:53,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play any Animal Crossing, and I'm tired of that game already.

134
00:10:54,534 --> 00:11:10,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I don't know, it's been pretty much just a lot of getting last minute wedding stuff done, starting to send out the invitations, and I was figuring out the last bit of stuff, got the cake flavors picked out.

135
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:18,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm supposed to be getting a bachelor party sometime in early April.

136
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:28,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly I'm just work stuff, trying to catch up, trying to win my VIP pass to E3.

137
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:33,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I am, seeing as I'm 30 accounts behind someone else.

138
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:38,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, well, I just haven't had good luck with my territory.

139
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,161
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rigged.

140
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is rigged.

141
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I am pretty certain that it is rigged.

142
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:49,933
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to beg them for a VIP pass anyways because I deserve it.

143
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:53,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the other guy doesn't know what the hell he would do with it.

144
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So I should be able to get one.

145
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:58,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, fuck.

146
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:00,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my managers are getting them and they don't play games.

147
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:01,936
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even know anything about games.

148
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:05,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully I'll be able to swing that.

149
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:06,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise we've got to get a media pass.

150
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:09,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition needs to be harder.

151
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:09,799
[SPEAKER_03]: But isn't it hot, though?

152
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:10,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

153
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:11,120
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's awesome.

154
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,642
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hot.

155
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,243
[SPEAKER_03]: That game is hot, but yeah.

156
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:31,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it had a harder difficulty in that.

157
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:37,616
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same as the old hard difficulty, just renamed Super Hard, and then there's a new Super Easy mode.

158
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:40,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why don't you play through it?

159
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:40,938
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of weird.

160
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:44,600
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to name them and do them according to the Doom model.

161
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Hurt Me Plenty, Nightmare, you know, and make them equally hard.

162
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:56,367
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I was so sad is when they announced that whole Rockstar Table Tennis thing, the whole tease of it was...

163
00:12:57,128 --> 00:13:02,510
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we've got news of a game that's coming to the 360 that you would never expect to hear.

164
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Duke Nukem Forever.

165
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:05,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Duke Nukem Forever.

166
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on!

167
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:07,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be Duke Nukem Forever!

168
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:08,672
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

169
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:11,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

170
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:12,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else?

171
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, my whole life is video games.

172
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:15,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sad.

173
00:13:15,823 --> 00:13:16,483
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's awesome.

174
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:17,324
[SPEAKER_03]: You're hardcore.

175
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:19,025
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you're the guest tonight.

176
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we know you're hardcore.

177
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:21,848
[SPEAKER_03]: We feel, we see it in your soul.

178
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:25,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, um... That's right, rock.

179
00:13:26,092 --> 00:13:28,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's get to the cage match.

180
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:28,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I don't know

181
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,681
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, the way the cage match works is that we're going to play three songs for you guys.

182
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:05,383
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys pick your favorite, and it goes into rotation all week long on Orange Moms Radio's video game and other music programs.

183
00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:11,065
[SPEAKER_03]: www.orangemomsradio.com, click on chat, be in the chat room, vote, play along.

184
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:12,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Three songs, here we go.

185
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:14,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's the first song we're going to hear tonight?

186
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:15,247
[SPEAKER_03]: You won your first.

187
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I honestly don't remember.

188
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:19,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a hint.

189
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:21,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Distorted reality with Super Crush.

190
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:28,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, this is a song that I found on Amazon because the original song I was looking for, I couldn't find a website that I could pirate it from.

191
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:31,089
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is, uh, yeah.

192
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:32,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what this sounds like.

193
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,772
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's another random song that I picked out of the middle of nowhere.

194
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:37,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Goody Goody Gumdrops.

195
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it worked last time.

196
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:41,075
[SPEAKER_03]: So, will the magic work again of randomness?

197
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number one from Loki tonight, distorted reality with Super Crush.

198
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:45,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

199
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:48,404
Thank you for watching!

200
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:57,494
Thank you for watching!

201
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:38,461
[SPEAKER_07]: When you search for truth you'll find Nothing but your empty mind I will die for you someday With the way I'm afraid

202
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:39,388
You bow, crow,

203
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:11,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, that was song number one tonight, Distorted Reality with Super Crush.

204
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:15,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what the folks in the studio thought of it, but remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you.

205
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:16,866
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

206
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:18,166
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cool.

207
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:24,229
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cool, just a little repetitive, but it gets a 7.5.

208
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:26,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Generic goth club song for me, 6.

209
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, gets an 8, because, yeah, I don't know why.

210
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:33,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I've first ever heard it, so, yeah.

211
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:34,013
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

212
00:19:34,577 --> 00:19:37,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to song number two tonight, which comes to us from DarkSakura.

213
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:38,478
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you pick for us tonight?

214
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:41,678
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the Afterbirth.

215
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:50,240
[SPEAKER_09]: However, last time, however, so many people said that it should have been my Gage Match song that I put it in the Gage Match today.

216
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,341
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's Compressor and Empty Frontalot.

217
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:55,241
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's the name of this song?

218
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:59,742
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Rappers We Crush.

219
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:00,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

220
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:03,843
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here it is, Rappers We Crush by Compressor featuring Empty Frontalot.

221
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:04,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

222
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,700
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm a freak.

223
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:04,151
The Wheel of the Lead Traveller visits your fear.

224
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:06,655
Red and yellow eyes, black gloves gripping the steer.

225
00:21:33,228 --> 00:21:34,293
Thanks for watching!

226
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:05,445
What did I do to deserve this?

227
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:06,365
What was my crime?

228
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:08,767
Was it because I sampled the Totem Hose in that one time?

229
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:29,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm reviewing my life, cowered under a grease trap The boot flap, steppin' ever closer with this click clap Now he's here, now he's crouching down, jaws creak, open hips start pouring out And just as my flesh is about to get devoured, I wake up screaming Wrapped in the sour sweat, stained sheets, takes a minute to get up Stumble to the table, read the paper, clear my head up

230
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:33,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Caption AM, take me by Jim Henson

231
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:22,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number two tonight, Compressor, featuring MC Frontalot with Rappers We Crush.

232
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:24,182
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about that song?

233
00:23:24,262 --> 00:23:27,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it great, or do you just want to crush it with your fists?

234
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:27,964
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

235
00:23:28,265 --> 00:23:28,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Nine.

236
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Any reason?

237
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:32,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually saying no in German.

238
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:33,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, gotcha.

239
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:36,269
[SPEAKER_09]: The number nine, too.

240
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:37,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

241
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:45,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to say, you know, I think I liked it better last time I heard it, but it's got clever lyrics, which I like about it, because they rap about, like, Muppets, and that's pretty hardcore.

242
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:49,453
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to give it... I definitely want to give it higher than the last one, but not by much.

243
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:49,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So seven.

244
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:50,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

245
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:52,956
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to get a six.

246
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:55,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care for MC Frontalot at all.

247
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:56,580
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

248
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into song number three tonight.

249
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:01,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number three is my pick, and I love this band.

250
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:05,167
[SPEAKER_03]: They were in Ultramix 3, and they have a remix album coming out soon.

251
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:08,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Azoic, and this song is called Going Under.

252
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:09,350
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a kinetic mix.

253
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:09,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

254
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:10,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

255
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:56,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number three tonight, the Ezoic going under Kinetic Mix.

256
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:59,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what the kids thought of that one.

257
00:27:59,203 --> 00:27:59,963
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

258
00:28:00,864 --> 00:28:03,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, better than your usual picks.

259
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:06,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, how sweet.

260
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:08,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously.

261
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it sounded less generic, so I guess an eight.

262
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,094
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

263
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:13,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, moving on.

264
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:16,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what'd you think of the Ezoic going under Kinetic Mix?

265
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:16,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of average.

266
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:17,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven.

267
00:28:17,677 --> 00:28:18,478
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

268
00:28:19,643 --> 00:28:23,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that mix, but I think I like the original one slightly better, so it gets an 8 from me.

269
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:26,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, place vote now.

270
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:28,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, three songs you can pick from tonight.

271
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:31,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Distorted Reality with Super Crush.

272
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:41,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And song number two you can vote for tonight, Compressor featuring MC Frontalot, Rappers We Crush.

273
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:53,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And song number three you can vote for tonight, The Ezoic with Going Under, The Kinetic Mix.

274
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:03,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Place a vote now.

275
00:29:03,726 --> 00:29:06,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

276
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:08,710
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have much time, so frickin' hurry up.

277
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Frickin' hurry with it.

278
00:29:11,012 --> 00:29:17,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now that we're in the afterbirth, now I suppose we can talk about the Oscars a little bit.

279
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:20,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Meek Latav, I see you lurking back there.

280
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Want to come on the show for a little bit?

281
00:29:23,243 --> 00:29:24,384
[SPEAKER_03]: You just want your iPod?

282
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:25,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I see how you are.

283
00:29:25,344 --> 00:29:27,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll make you work for it.

284
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:28,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Come here.

285
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:31,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the microphone?

286
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:32,506
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is on the ground there.

287
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you mad about the Oscars?

288
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:37,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I heard that Crash won and not Brokeback Mountain.

289
00:29:37,947 --> 00:29:45,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't be mad about the Oscars because they were obviously just the joke Oscars since that pimp song won Best Song.

290
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:45,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it really?

291
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:46,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

292
00:29:47,173 --> 00:29:48,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen Hustle and Flow, though?

293
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It is actually supposed to be pretty good.

294
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:55,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I don't watch those type of movies, but it is supposed to be...

295
00:29:56,016 --> 00:29:56,556
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

296
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:21,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I fell out of love with the Oscars years ago

297
00:30:34,256 --> 00:30:46,202
[SPEAKER_03]: and, please don't get me wrong, Crash was a really good movie, and Brokeback Mountain was a really good movie, but, you know what, there were thousands, you know, I'm sure there were lots of, maybe not thousands, but there were lots of good movies this year, and who's to say... Saw 2 should have won.

298
00:30:46,222 --> 00:30:47,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Saw 2 totally should have won.

299
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:48,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Saw 2 was amazing.

300
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:49,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.

301
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:50,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Who won the Razzies?

302
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:51,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, those... Was it crazy?

303
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:54,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are... It was, it was pretty... Saw 2.

304
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Saw 2 was pretty good, actually.

305
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,766
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't even look to see who won a Razzie.

306
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:58,347
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't even look to see... Yeah, he did.

307
00:30:58,527 --> 00:30:58,887
[SPEAKER_02]: He did.

308
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think he won it for Blood Rain.

309
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:01,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he did.

310
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:02,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

311
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:12,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I really didn't care about the Oscars this year because I figured Brokeback would probably lose even though it deserved to win out of what was there.

312
00:31:13,218 --> 00:31:14,399
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, whatever.

313
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:15,800
[SPEAKER_02]: The pimps won.

314
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,942
[SPEAKER_02]: The racists won.

315
00:31:18,822 --> 00:31:19,303
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

316
00:31:19,623 --> 00:31:20,944
[SPEAKER_02]: How was Jon Stewart as host?

317
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:24,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard he made an appearance or something

318
00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:44,622
[SPEAKER_02]: A commercial saying how this audio engineer doesn't deserve to win, but this audio engineer does.

319
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:46,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a political commercial.

320
00:31:47,144 --> 00:31:47,704
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty funny.

321
00:31:47,985 --> 00:31:51,827
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of the time, I actually didn't watch the Oscars.

322
00:31:52,168 --> 00:31:56,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I flipped to it to see a couple of the awards that I mostly watched.

323
00:31:56,511 --> 00:31:58,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't you guys watching a Law & Order marathon?

324
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:01,675
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was in the living room right now, I'd still be watching Law & Order.

325
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately for you guys, I don't think Uevo won.

326
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:08,245
[SPEAKER_03]: The winner for Worst Picture is Dirty Love.

327
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:16,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst Actor goes to Rob Schneider.

328
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst Actress would be Jenny McCarthy, also in Dirty Love.

329
00:32:20,652 --> 00:32:21,653
[SPEAKER_03]: She's awesome, though.

330
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:26,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst Supporting Actor, Hayden Christensen in Star Wars Episode III.

331
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:30,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst Supporting Actress, Paris Hilton in House of Wax.

332
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:32,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And they spell wax wrong, that's funny.

333
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:37,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Worst On-Screen Couple, Will Ferrell, Nicole Kidman in Bewitched.

334
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:41,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst Sequel or Remake, Son of the Mask.

335
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,954
[SPEAKER_03]: and Worst Website, the Razzie Awards.

336
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:45,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine that.

337
00:32:45,775 --> 00:32:47,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that crap website.

338
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:49,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it was made in Angel Fire.

339
00:32:52,864 --> 00:32:59,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, plug, I know you can't talk about anything that goes on at Konami because of NDAs and stuff, but plug your favorite board game.

340
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:00,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

341
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:04,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Apples to Apples is the best war game.

342
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:06,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It has actually taken over break time at work.

343
00:33:06,637 --> 00:33:08,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart is no longer the reigning champion.

344
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:11,740
[SPEAKER_02]: We play Apples to Apples because it's really, really fun.

345
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,340
[SPEAKER_02]: That was quite fun.

346
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Really quickly, what do you do in Apples to Apples?

347
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:16,002
[SPEAKER_02]: You judge people.

348
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:19,864
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much what you do.

349
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:29,029
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this judge and he puts down an adjective card and then everybody else looks at the cards in their hands and they're all nouns and then they place what they think

350
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:32,257
[SPEAKER_02]: The judge thinks would be the best match.

351
00:33:32,617 --> 00:33:37,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the judge picks up all the cards, looks at them, and then he awards a point to what he thinks is the best.

352
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:42,280
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main part of the game is saying why you don't think certain cards should win.

353
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're you, who likes to judge everybody.

354
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:46,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.

355
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:47,842
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's fun.

356
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:48,962
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

357
00:33:49,955 --> 00:33:52,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's announce the winner of tonight's cage match so we can wrap this show up here.

358
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:53,417
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys ready?

359
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:56,819
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very, very close cage match tonight, might I say.

360
00:33:56,879 --> 00:34:07,285
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the closer ones in years because one vote separated the winner from the runner-up and then one vote separated the runner-up from third place.

361
00:34:07,485 --> 00:34:09,427
[SPEAKER_03]: So all three songs were very neck and neck.

362
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:12,729
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, there can be only one.

363
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:14,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And tonight's winner is...

364
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I won stinking vote over Compressor.

365
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:30,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Two stinking votes over... Just like the Oscars, the one that's most fresh in the minds of the voters is the one that won.

366
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:34,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought all those votes, but I actually placed an ad in Variety this week.

367
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:37,493
[SPEAKER_03]: For your consideration, the Ezoic going under Kinetic.

368
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:41,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Best supporting song on an internet radio station.

369
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:42,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Lovely.

370
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,501
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to wrap up.

371
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:48,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm getting tired.

372
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:48,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm worn out.

373
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:50,473
[SPEAKER_09]: You haven't done chatroom FUs.

374
00:34:51,534 --> 00:34:52,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.

375
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:52,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

376
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:53,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I will solicit.

377
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:55,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I will allow chatroom FUs.

378
00:34:55,998 --> 00:34:57,059
[SPEAKER_09]: One each.

379
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:58,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one each.

380
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,981
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll take the first five.

381
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:00,561
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

382
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:02,283
[SPEAKER_03]: So hurry up.

383
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:06,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Send a private message to Sky with your chatroom FUs and we'll hook that up.

384
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:11,070
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we talk about in the meantime?

385
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,011
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is going on?

386
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:12,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

387
00:35:13,472 --> 00:35:14,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Taxes.

388
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:15,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting money.

389
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:18,906
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I managed to buy the iBook.

390
00:35:18,946 --> 00:35:21,608
[SPEAKER_03]: $1,200 from federal and $200 from state.

391
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:22,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

392
00:35:22,968 --> 00:35:25,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually started having them withhold a lot of money.

393
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:40,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I turned on the cabinet this weekend and then turned it back off because I got yelled at for turning on the cabinet while people were in the house and distracting the guests and not socializing with people.

394
00:35:41,877 --> 00:35:42,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

395
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:45,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I just sent Dan out to the garage to play the meme.

396
00:35:46,363 --> 00:35:47,888
[SPEAKER_09]: We have ours built out of a stand-up composition.

397
00:35:47,908 --> 00:35:48,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel so uncool.

398
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:51,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the only OLR host with no main cabinets.

399
00:35:52,455 --> 00:35:54,256
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

400
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:19,411
[SPEAKER_03]: That's stupid.

401
00:36:19,431 --> 00:36:20,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the little ones at Target, though?

402
00:36:20,993 --> 00:36:21,713
[SPEAKER_03]: The little baby ones?

403
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,614
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

404
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:23,454
[SPEAKER_03]: They're interesting.

405
00:36:23,574 --> 00:36:25,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're still a little pricey for me.

406
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'd have one, but, you know.

407
00:36:28,558 --> 00:36:32,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make more of my interfaces, but I just don't have them in the store.

408
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:47,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get into a new apartment or a new condo or whatever so that we have our own bedroom dedicated to the cabinet so I can dump them in the closet because, unfortunately, each interface is like six feet wide or, no, four feet wide and

409
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:49,380
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too big.

410
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,761
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I want?

411
00:36:51,601 --> 00:37:01,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we had Bobby on the show tonight from All Games, and he was talking about on another show about how he went to Media Play, because you know all the Media Play stores went under?

412
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:06,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And he freaking got one of those PlayStation 2 kiosks that you have in the store.

413
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:08,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he got one of those in his house.

414
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:09,253
[SPEAKER_09]: We have an Xbox One.

415
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:09,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

416
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:10,434
[SPEAKER_03]: God!

417
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:12,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are about two grand.

418
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:13,597
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty expensive.

419
00:37:13,877 --> 00:37:14,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, really?

420
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:18,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I've actually... I can tell you that's probably not what he paid for it.

421
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:25,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a thing for Microsoft because they were pimping out their... The kiosk before the 360 was coming out.

422
00:37:25,682 --> 00:37:28,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like five grand for those.

423
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:29,943
[SPEAKER_03]: They have really detailed ones.

424
00:37:30,223 --> 00:37:33,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob, he's going to link a picture right now so you guys can see it in his house.

425
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:35,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he said he was playing Guitar Hero on it or something.

426
00:37:35,465 --> 00:37:35,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

427
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:36,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's another thing.

428
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:40,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to set up Guitar Freaks on mine eventually.

429
00:37:40,803 --> 00:37:44,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that they've got actual DDR games running under MAME, that should be pretty cool.

430
00:37:46,546 --> 00:37:48,947
[SPEAKER_03]: What else was... There was something else I was going to try.

431
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:50,808
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.

432
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:54,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he went ahead and told us how much he paid.

433
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:55,330
[SPEAKER_03]: He paid $500 for it.

434
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty good.

435
00:37:56,511 --> 00:37:57,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's hardcore, though.

436
00:37:58,331 --> 00:38:01,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I could have spent that kind of money, but you go, boy.

437
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:01,993
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

438
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:02,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

439
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:02,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a picture.

440
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, I'm loading it up right there.

441
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:04,794
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

442
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:05,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and it's Guitar Hero.

443
00:38:06,195 --> 00:38:06,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on there.

444
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:07,176
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

445
00:38:07,196 --> 00:38:09,977
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got the little eye toy set up there on the top, a little cutout there.

446
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:11,501
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

447
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:14,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sitting in the apartment, just chilling.

448
00:38:16,942 --> 00:38:22,123
[SPEAKER_03]: You know you're into games when... Someday, my cabinet will be done.

449
00:38:22,823 --> 00:38:23,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Someday.

450
00:38:23,824 --> 00:38:24,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got all the parts.

451
00:38:25,364 --> 00:38:27,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need the time and the space to put it in.

452
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:31,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Someday, it will be mine.

453
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:34,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, it's been, like, what, in production for two years now?

454
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:34,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

455
00:38:34,886 --> 00:38:37,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the big... Since I lived with you in that apartment.

456
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:39,027
[SPEAKER_03]: A brief vacation, though, of course.

457
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:39,607
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

458
00:38:39,878 --> 00:38:41,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to chatroom FUs.

459
00:38:41,258 --> 00:38:42,919
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you ready for this, DarkSakura?

460
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:43,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

461
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see.

462
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:55,903
[SPEAKER_03]: MiniMe283 says, F you to the Oscars for not nominating Cinderella Man or Narnia enough.

463
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:58,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Narnia.

464
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:00,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was much better than I thought it would be.

465
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:01,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Cinderella Man I didn't see.

466
00:39:01,445 --> 00:39:02,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like Russell Crowe.

467
00:39:02,826 --> 00:39:06,087
[SPEAKER_03]: NintendoManiac64 said, F you to this bloody nose I got on the toilet.

468
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:08,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Better a bloody nose than a... Never mind.

469
00:39:09,168 --> 00:39:09,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

470
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:15,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninja Bunny with X's around it says, F you to SUVs because they hit my motorcycle.

471
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:22,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say F you to this SUV I saw today parked in between spaces at the restaurant.

472
00:39:22,538 --> 00:39:22,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.

473
00:39:23,419 --> 00:39:25,121
[SPEAKER_03]: What do those people think they are?

474
00:39:27,203 --> 00:39:30,246
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTeksuya says, F you to Uebol for finally getting the hint.

475
00:39:31,227 --> 00:39:33,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Popanda21 says, Speaking of dragons...

476
00:39:34,907 --> 00:39:39,970
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to not being able to download Kuro Kuro Rock or Sunday Bloody Sunday without it being messed up.

477
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:43,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid drama created by my bitches and hoes.

478
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:44,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta smack a bitch up.

479
00:39:44,954 --> 00:39:46,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And FU to school and college and friction.

480
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Burn on penises in the Oscars.

481
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:49,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Fiend.

482
00:39:50,197 --> 00:39:50,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my music?

483
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:53,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

484
00:39:53,819 --> 00:40:04,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku says, FU to giving an already intoxicated girl at a party in my apartment a shot of Rumpelmintz since that one got her passed out as well as feeling guilty about giving her the shot.

485
00:40:06,468 --> 00:40:08,289
[SPEAKER_03]: You college kids and your drunkenness.

486
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:13,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says, F you to bamaniiso.ws for banning me.

487
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:16,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to do my share and keep torrents up and I got capped for it.

488
00:40:16,353 --> 00:40:22,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I already got capped twice for sharing torrents for you guys, but y'all ain't paying my cable bills, so fuck you, you fucking pricks.

489
00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:25,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and FYI, your torrents will always be leaked out to other sites, so suck it.

490
00:40:26,238 --> 00:40:27,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you want to get back at him?

491
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:28,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Report him!

492
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn him in!

493
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:33,722
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100, ruin it for everybody.

494
00:40:33,742 --> 00:40:34,322
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100, Matt says...

495
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:45,095
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my anti-semitic neighbor who password locked out my network and changed it to secure your network you dumbass Jew and changed my router name to dumb faggot Jew.

496
00:40:45,596 --> 00:40:52,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It took me a long time to fix everything he messed up and get my internet working correctly all because he hates me and my family for being Jewish.

497
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:54,983
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like real... Can you believe that that exists?

498
00:40:55,003 --> 00:40:55,844
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not funny!

499
00:40:56,084 --> 00:40:57,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you believe that that exists in the world?

500
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:00,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Sick!

501
00:41:00,468 --> 00:41:01,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going home to rename my router.

502
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:07,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everyone is heavily armed or wearing armor so that they'll put up a fight, morons.

503
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,306
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's any chicks there, I wanna do them!

504
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,328
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other kind of old play.

505
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:50,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tomo-kun, last but not least, says fuck me for not paying attention, fuck Verizon, fuck the creepy guys at the arcade, picking up my 15-year-old friend.

506
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, she said she was 17 and a half.

507
00:41:57,405 --> 00:42:00,107
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio to Afterbirth.

508
00:42:01,345 --> 00:42:01,625
[SPEAKER_03]: AskANinja.com

509
00:42:17,011 --> 00:42:19,732
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we gotta have... If we ever become a TV show, that would be a great thing.

510
00:42:19,752 --> 00:42:21,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, they're bigger than we are already.

511
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:23,353
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been featured on iTunes, like, four weeks in a row.

512
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:24,453
[SPEAKER_03]: They were featured on the news!

513
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:31,175
[SPEAKER_03]: We were featured on iTunes once, and in a dark, black corner somewhere, and, you know, we were lucky to really even get that.

514
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:34,076
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, you know, it's just... You know what's funny?

515
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:37,197
[SPEAKER_03]: They featured a video game podcast, I think, like...

516
00:42:38,373 --> 00:42:41,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably four times since iTunes has gone up.

517
00:42:42,015 --> 00:42:45,816
[SPEAKER_03]: The only time we were ever mentioned on iTunes was under Interesting Indies, which is kind of cool.

518
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:46,737
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

519
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:49,358
[SPEAKER_03]: The Video Game Podcast, we've never been featured.

520
00:42:49,438 --> 00:42:50,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby's never been featured.

521
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if All Games Interactive was.

522
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:53,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe once.

523
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,821
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know who most of them are that get featured?

524
00:42:56,721 --> 00:43:03,324
[SPEAKER_03]: G4 Replays, the X-Play Podcast, probably Attack of the Show Podcast and all that.

525
00:43:04,512 --> 00:43:08,814
[SPEAKER_03]: You can turn on your TV and watch, which defeats the purpose of podcasting.

526
00:43:08,894 --> 00:43:18,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, you couldn't turn your TV on and watch it because they would be playing Star Trek Next Generation, The Man Show, Fastlane, and Banzai.

527
00:43:18,379 --> 00:43:22,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, because that show failed on two different networks.

528
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:26,623
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it, G4, the place where shows finally go to die?

529
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:31,205
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, let's breathe life into them once more and hope that it does well.

530
00:43:31,704 --> 00:43:33,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you miss G4 back when it only kinda sucked?

531
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:55,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I would have been so much nicer to G4 in the beginning.

532
00:43:56,264 --> 00:43:59,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have said, every show on there is awesome, I love it, I'm a big fan of everybody.

533
00:43:59,886 --> 00:44:01,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like the electric playground or filter.

534
00:44:01,948 --> 00:44:02,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

535
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:05,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I love Diane Miazoa, she's my hero.

536
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:10,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know... You know, even though I'm gay, she's still pretty hot.

537
00:44:10,516 --> 00:44:11,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I gotta admit.

538
00:44:11,636 --> 00:44:12,037
[SPEAKER_03]: She is!

539
00:44:12,537 --> 00:44:14,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen her in the Mario cosplay?

540
00:44:14,558 --> 00:44:16,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Is she the one that counts down things?

541
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:19,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she counts down things on her little show, but it got canned.

542
00:44:20,582 --> 00:44:25,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I wanna say she's on the, uh, I think I saw her on the Andy Grant... Was she on the Andy Grant show?

543
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Three Wishes?

544
00:44:26,785 --> 00:44:29,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but she's on Trains, Spaces, like, Kids or something.

545
00:44:31,888 --> 00:44:32,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyway.

546
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:35,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... That, that, that, that, that, that, that.

547
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:38,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Small corrections here.

548
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:45,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby, of course, says that All Games Interactive actually was featured on iTunes once, but it was under New and Notable.

549
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:52,813
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what makes this little partnership we have going on interesting, is that neither one of us are good enough to be featured as a video game podcast.

550
00:44:52,893 --> 00:44:55,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And I use good enough with loose quotes there, as you know.

551
00:44:56,246 --> 00:44:59,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Put Morgan Webb on your album art and shit, you'll be featured every week.

552
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:01,908
[SPEAKER_02]: She's really awesome, though, but has a small head.

553
00:45:01,988 --> 00:45:02,608
[SPEAKER_02]: She is.

554
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:07,610
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one thing I got out of E3 that year.

555
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Her head is really tiny.

556
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,230
[SPEAKER_02]: The show's over.

557
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:20,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got his autograph, like, at the Nintendo Power Fest in, like, 19- I still want to know what dumpster our sampler CD ended up in, Loki.

558
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:24,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

559
00:45:24,835 --> 00:45:25,375
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably, like,

560
00:45:26,944 --> 00:45:29,705
[SPEAKER_03]: G4 was also the channel that brought us video game vixens.

561
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:02,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, at least that has something to do with video games.

562
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:03,547
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.

563
00:46:03,888 --> 00:46:06,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're done with G4 bashing, honestly.

564
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,572
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so, you know, yesterday.

565
00:46:09,552 --> 00:46:12,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's get this show done with.

566
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:13,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's your fortune cookie message.

567
00:46:13,376 --> 00:46:15,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, final, final, final, final thoughts.

568
00:46:15,097 --> 00:46:15,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Mikotov.

569
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:19,241
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Power Ranger sucks, except for the Green Ranger.

570
00:46:20,702 --> 00:46:21,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't look at me like that.

571
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:24,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Spike, final, final, final, super duper last thought.

572
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:27,548
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have anything.

573
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Tommy Tallarico's just way too short.

574
00:46:34,317 --> 00:46:35,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Loki.

575
00:46:35,398 --> 00:46:45,065
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell was that really crappy show that was on that station that featured, like, the MMO skits and that guy named Dave who talked to a computer that didn't really exist?

576
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that, um, um... Portal!

577
00:46:47,707 --> 00:46:48,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddamn Portal suck!

578
00:46:48,968 --> 00:46:50,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind, I take it all back!

579
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Portal fucking suck!

580
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:51,711
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know what?

581
00:46:51,731 --> 00:46:52,071
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

582
00:46:52,451 --> 00:46:54,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather have that.

583
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:57,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather have that than what we have now.

584
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And I take back everything I said.

585
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:02,555
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, final thought.

586
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:05,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, hi.

587
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:13,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And my final super-duper last bit thought is, um... I broke the mic.

588
00:47:13,638 --> 00:47:14,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night, everybody.

589
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:15,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
