42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,500
I did?

46
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,500
You won that Evergreen song, I think, didn't you?

47
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,000
He did.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,500
I did?

49
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,000
I think he did.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,500
I did?

51
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes, you did.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,500
Yes!

53
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
DarkSocker and I both confirmed it, so you won last time.

54
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, I had another song, too.

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I didn't even remember.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, too bad for you.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Too bad.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So we'll get into K2i shortly, but first, real quickly, how was your two weeks?

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How was your day?

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
DarkSocker, how was the Alabama trip?

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
My family loves my husband, which makes me very relieved.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,840
We went, the first night there, we went to Waffle House, which Dan wasn't thrilled about,

63
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,840
but I was like, hash browns!

64
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
So I had Waffle House.

65
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,200
And then the next day, we went to Cracker Barrel, which Dan liked, and I had fried okra

66
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,560
and fried catfish and fried everything else.

67
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:31,320
And we went to see my ex-roommates, my mama-san and my papa-san, who took care of me during

68
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,140
really difficult time and we went to the Atlanta Bread Company for dinner that

69
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,320
night and but we weren't before closing so they weren't all that great and then

70
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,180
steak and shake where their food is awful that chili on the spaghetti yes

71
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,940
you can get full on marinara sauce and chili on the spaghetti it's horrible

72
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,020
their fries are awful but their milkshakes are the best ever they do

73
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,880
this thing called like the side-by-side which I had a banana and dark chocolate

74
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,920
milkshake and mixed them and it was fabulous. I did not eat my blue bell ice cream but I

75
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,640
did have boiled peanuts. We also ate at a place called Cooper T's and it's a very weird

76
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:17,640
thing sharing beer with my brother. He's going to be 22 this month. Happy birthday Matt.

77
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:27,520
My brother, I also found out my brother Phillip is on a naval boat. He's a marine. Somewhere

78
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,600
in Asia somewhere. He's supposed to be going, I think, to Hokkaido, then down to Okinawa,

79
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,200
then around the China coast, and then back home. Doing something or the other, I don't

80
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:48,000
know. I just told him to bring me back stuff. And we also went to the Mobile Museum of Art,

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,920
which is very nice. There was a lot of local art there too, as well as some very nice classics.

82
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,780
There was even a couple of Renoir there, really nice stuff.

83
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:06,680
We also went to Dothan on Monday, I was actually born in Dothan.

84
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,460
We went to go see my dad and my granny and they conveniently forgot that I am on a low

85
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,680
carb eating plan and vegetarian so they had steak and pecan pie.

86
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,800
I ate some steak to make my daddy happy, it was pretty good, made me very ill and pecan

87
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,780
pie which is very yummy and it was very interesting meeting my dad's new fiance

88
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,780
one of several she was nice though I like her maybe they'd be happy we went

89
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,180
back I have a little peanuts we went and ate at Ruby Tuesday's the next day we go

90
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,340
to the to Winston Winston's oyster house I fried oysters and I'm happy my uncle's

91
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,820
there gives us Mardi Gras stuff and then we flew home that day very very

92
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,100
horrible plane ride I was in the up in the air for six hours running into a

93
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:01,000
headwind with massive turbulence it was to suck but I did watch most of Hellboy

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,140
sweet and movie is pretty cool and of course Dan played lots of Phoenix Wright

95
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:13,100
and I played lots of Animal Crossing I went on a trip I went to Virginia did

96
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,660
you have a nice fall um shut up here's a list of things I did for the first time

97
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,180
that might make you a little bit proud.

98
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,500
Uh, I ate- remember, we're from the West Coast, we don't have some of this stuff, so it's

99
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
all new to us.

100
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,440
Uh, I ate at a Sonic, I've never eaten at a Sonic before, pretty good, they have a wide

101
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
selection of stuff.

102
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
There's one in Yuba City.

103
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,380
Yeah, but I still have never eaten there, and that's 40 minutes away for those playing

104
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,380
along now.

105
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,460
There's, uh, one that's going in by, uh, Arco.

106
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,980
It's not- it's not bad, so, you know, check it out.

107
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,980
It's across from the Hooters.

108
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,540
Okay, here's the other thing, I ate at a Chick-fil-A for the first time.

109
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,460
There's one in Roseville.

110
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,460
Is there now?

111
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,300
They were putting one in here. It's been there since August so much for this like East Coast thing

112
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,380
What else they do for the first time? Um, oh, I ate at a Hardee's for like the first time in years

113
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,980
Aka Carl's Jr. Yeah, let me let me tell no no no Carl's Jr. Nasty. No, Carl's Jr. Is way better than Hardee's

114
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,340
No, I'm saying it's Carl's Jr. But nasty. Yeah, you guys on the East Coast you have it

115
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:12,680
Sorry, Carl's Jr. Is way better. Did you go to crystal three words Western bacon? No, they didn't have that there or at least I didn't find it

116
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,580
Let's see. What else I do in Virginia. I went to an aquarium there

117
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,580
Let me just put it this way, the coolest thing at the aquarium was the bird cage.

118
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,580
You go figure that one out.

119
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,580
And I went to the beach. That was the first time I'd really been to the East Coast beach.

120
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,580
No, I did it the second time because I forgot. I went to Fire Island years ago.

121
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,580
No, just a couple years ago I went to Fire Island very randomly.

122
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,580
Get your mind out of the gutter. We just walked around the beach.

123
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,580
If you know what that is.

124
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,580
And if you know what that is, hats off to you.

125
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,580
And I guess, let's see, what else did I do in Virginia?

126
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,580
Not a lot. I camped out in the hotel most of the time.

127
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,580
I ate and ate a lot of food. I gained about five pounds on my trip, so I'm not proud of that.

128
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,580
But I'll be working it off pretty soon.

129
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,580
That's pretty much it. That's all I really want to share.

130
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:04,580
It was cold. You know what? For the first time in my life in Chesapeake, I saw snow falling from the sky for the first time.

131
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,580
I've never seen that ever in my life until I went to this place.

132
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,580
But it only snowed the one day, and apparently they never get snow.

133
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,120
they get snow like as often as we do here. But I saw it smoke and I had to scrape snow

134
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,860
off my car the first day and I was like, this is going to set the mood for my trip right

135
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,860
here.

136
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,080
Loki, how was your past couple of weeks?

137
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:30,120
We found a DJ for our wedding. He's crazy. I quit Final Fantasy XI and that was pretty

138
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
tough.

139
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
What happened to the shell? Are you able to pass that off to somebody else or?

140
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,720
No. So they better be careful who they add because they can't delete anybody and they

141
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,280
can't create new. They'll just create another show, I don't care, whatever. And then I played

142
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:54,760
a lot of Full Auto. I didn't play any Animal Crossing and I'm tired of that game already.

143
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:01,320
And I don't know, it's been pretty much just a lot of getting last minute wedding stuff

144
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:08,640
done, starting to send out the invitations, and I was figuring out the last bit of stuff,

145
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:17,320
got the cake-flavors picked out. And I'm supposed to be getting a bachelor party sometime in

146
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:25,400
early April. And yeah. So, mainly I'm just work stuff, you know, trying to catch up,

147
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:33,080
trying to win my VIP pass to E3. I don't know if I am, seeing as I'm 30 accounts behind

148
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,760
someone else because, well, I just haven't had good luck with my territory.

149
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
It's rigged.

150
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,280
Yes, it is rigged. I am pretty certain that it is rigged, but I'm going to beg them for

151
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:52,300
a VIP account, or a VIP pass anyways because I deserve it. Whereas the other guy doesn't

152
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,120
know what the hell he would do with it. So, I should be able to get one. I mean, fuck.

153
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,080
I mean, some of my managers are getting them and they don't play games. They don't even

154
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,620
know anything about games so hopefully I'll be able to swing that otherwise we

155
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,160
gotta get a media pass look on that I know I know and then yeah that's that's

156
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,440
it all right we're spike anything real quick you want to share about how your

157
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:24,120
week's been going devil may cry 3 special edition needs to be harder but

158
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,380
isn't it hot though oh yeah no it's all that's hot that game is hot but yeah I

159
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,380
I thought it had a harder difficulty in that.

160
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:38,380
It's the same as the old hard difficulty, just renamed Super Hard, and then there's a new Super Easy mode.

161
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,380
Well, why don't you play through it with the other character?

162
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:48,380
They need to name them and do them according to the Doom model. Hurt me plenty, nightmare, you know, and make them equally hard.

163
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:54,700
Know what I was so sad is when they announced that whole rockstar table tennis thing did the whole

164
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,940
Tease of it was no. We've got news of a game. That's coming to the 360 that you would never expect

165
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:08,620
The here and I was like Duke Nukem forever Duke Nukem forever come on. It's gonna be Duke Nukem forever no

166
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,980
All right

167
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,260
Anything else no really my whole life is video games. It's it's sad. That's all no. That's awesome. You're hardcore

168
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,260
That's why you're the guest tonight, because we know you're hardcore, we feel, we see it in your soul.

169
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,260
Alright, um, that's right, rock.

170
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,260
Anyway, let's get to the cage match, because we gotta start wrapping things up here.

171
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,260
Now, Loki, we determined that you actually won, but you put a new song in the directory and took out the old one,

172
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,260
so I think we're just going to do Clean Slate tonight.

173
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,260
Okay, I forgot I deleted it, yeah.

174
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,260
Let's just do Clean Slate tonight, because, you know, honestly, with us being gone for two weeks,

175
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,180
for two weeks i think pretty much it would have been on for a month anyway so

176
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,020
we're going to start a cage match with a clean slate tonight three brand new songs for you guys

177
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,540
uh so anyway the way the cage match works is that uh we're going to play three songs for you guys

Here's a hint distorted reality with super crush

183
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,440
Oh, yeah, this is a song that I found on Amazon because the original fun

184
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,520
I was looking for I couldn't find a website that could pirate it from so this is

185
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,580
Yeah, I don't even know what the sounds like so it's another random song that picked up in the middle of nowhere

186
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,960
Goody goody gumdrop. Hey what it worked last time, so will the magic work again of randomness?

187
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Song number one from Loki tonight, Distorted Reality with Super Crush. Enjoy.

188
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Supergrass, Supergrass, Supergrass

189
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:44,920
I'll erase all you hold dear Facing you I feel the sky behind me

190
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,600
You're in this bed of fear I'll erase all you hold dear

191
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,920
Facing you I feel the sky behind me You said goodbye

192
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,240
You will rest across this space As you face your disgrace

193
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:28,240
To the ground, to the ground, to the ground

194
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,240
I will lay my life worth two

195
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Throw out all the thoughts of you

196
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Where to be for days but still

197
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Fighting nothing can fulfill

198
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,240
Facing you I feel the sky

199
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Behind me you said goodbye

200
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,240
You will wrestle for this fate

201
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,240
As you say, you're just right

202
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,240
You can't call

203
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,240
To the crash

204
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:37,760
When you've been done for truth you'll find Nothing but your empty mind

205
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,260
I know it's time for you to stay With the way I felt great

206
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,760
I'll erase all you hold dear, saving you I feel the sky, behind me you said goodbye

207
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Underneath the rinses, tear and fear

208
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,760
I'll erase all you hold dear

209
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Facing you, I'll fill the sky

210
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Behind me, you said goodbye

211
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,760
To the rest of our mistakes

212
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,760
And if you say you're this great

213
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,160
Yo, that was song number one tonight. Distorted Reality was super crush. Let's see what the

214
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,640
folks in the studio thought of it. But remember, it's not up to us. It's up to you. Dark Sockra.

215
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,760
It was cool. It was cool, just a little repetitive, but it gets a 7.5.

216
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Uh, generic goth club song for me. 6. Loki. Gets an 8. Cause, yeah, I don't know why.

217
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,960
I don't know why I first ever heard it. So yeah. All right, let's move on to song number two tonight

218
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,560
Which comes to us from dark soccer. What'd you pick for us tonight? Um, I put it was the afterbirth

219
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,520
However, you know glass last time

220
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,140
However, so many people said that it should have been my cage match song that I put it in the cage match today

221
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,160
So it's compressor and the empty front a lot

222
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
What's the name of this song? It's rappers

223
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,080
Rappers We Crush by Compressor featuring MC Frontalot. Enjoy.

224
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,480
Like I ain't hung over with the paper Discover that the Germans are the next Grover

225
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,080
Cookie, Kermy, Piggy, and all the rest The rate a single domestically controlled

226
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,780
Muffet, let, let, is it a plot? Some kind of conspiracy, my coffee's cold

227
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,180
There's a bitter taste to my cinnamon roll I venture forth into the bright American day

228
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,380
My neighbor Mr. Hess says V gates and waves I hurry away, get my Chrysler over dismay

229
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,580
Somebody's replaced all on my backstreet moorings with crabs or tape

230
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,580
Alright, I'm freaked out, I hope it's a joke

231
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,880
I hear the ominous industrial beat of a two-stroke engine

232
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,380
What?

233
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,880
It bends on my letter, it's a bug on my right

234
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,380
What?

235
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,380
A state of six trombones encroaching behind

236
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,080
At the wheel of the lead trivia visit your fear

237
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,880
Red and yellow eyes, black gloves tripping the steer

238
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,180
And then it dawns upon me, what chance have I got?

239
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,380
It's compressor and he's chosen for crushing and see criminalize

240
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,280
We crush, fingers to dust

241
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,380
Compressor, digest, barcodes, it's without much

242
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,880
You try too much with rhymes

243
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Stolen from the Jackson Prize

244
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Erase your dreams at night

245
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,380
You cower farm called mastermind

246
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,880
But I don't want to be crushed

247
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
They're eating deer

248
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
Left for toad

249
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,880
Synthesize the mite

250
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,380
Tearing the rhymes right out of my throat

251
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,880
Leave my call at the light and run

252
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
I make for the park

253
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,380
Perceived by steel-toed deck

254
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,380
Boots throwing socks as they march

255
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
And I can hear the gnashing of the yellow teeth

256
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,880
You cannot hide, rapper geek

257
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
I'm dodging German shepherds

258
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,380
Playing Frisbee with the hippies

259
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,380
Making hairpin turns like horror movie heroines I'm slipping back on my feet

260
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,380
His breath on my neck, it smells of baked infants and fried cheese

261
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,380
Fun! You're sure to suffer crushing if you sit still

262
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,380
Pop the chain link to the abandoned beaner schnitzel

263
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,380
What did I do to deserve this? What was my crime?

264
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,380
Was it because I sampled the totem hosing that one time?

265
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,380
And I'm reviewing my life powered under a grease trap

266
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,380
The boot slap's stepping ever closer with it

267
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,380
Click clack, now he's here, now he's crouching down

268
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,380
Jaws peek open and start pouring out

269
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:33,980
And just as my flesh is about to get devoured, I wake up screaming, wrapped in the sour sweat, stained sheets, takes a minute to get that, stumble to the table, read the paper, clear my head up, still hurts, what'd I drink all back old soccer for? Business section, A.M., TV, bar, gym, Henson Court!

270
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,180
Bappas crush, bingas through dust

271
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:43,180
Compress that tight as fo' gold fans spin down to mush

272
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,180
You try to fudge with crimes

273
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,780
Stolen from the Jackson 5

274
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,180
Erase your tings at night

275
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,180
CALIFORN COMPRESSOR MIGHT!

276
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:23,180
Song number two tonight, Compressor featuring MC Frontalot with rappers we crush, what do

277
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,180
What do you think about that song? Is it great, or do you just want to crush it with your fists?

278
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,180
Dark Sakura.

279
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
Nein.

280
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
Any reason?

281
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,180
I was actually saying no in German.

282
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
Oh, gotcha.

283
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,180
The number 9, too.

284
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,180
Okay.

285
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,180
I would have to say, you know, I think I liked it better the last time I heard it, but it's got clever lyrics.

286
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,180
That's what I like about it, because they rap about Muppets, and that's pretty hardcore.

287
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,180
So I'm going to give it...

288
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,180
Well, I definitely want to give it a higher than the last one, but not by much, so 7.

289
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
Logie.

290
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,180
That's gonna get us sick. I don't care for MC Frontalot at all.

291
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,180
Alright, let's get into song number 3 tonight. Song number 3 is my pick, and I love this band.

292
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,180
They were in UltraMix 3, and they have a remix album coming out soon.

293
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,180
and this song is called Going Under. It's a kinetic mix. Enjoy.

294
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,180
And I think I'm getting ground

295
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,180
This whole thing pulls me so far alone

296
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,180
I realize that I am bound

297
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,180
Take control of my reason

298
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:07,180
I am going under, under Please tell, tell me just what's right

299
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:14,180
No, I'll be safe May inside me open the eyes

300
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:20,180
Please tell, tell me that's my friend

301
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,180
So what do you say?

302
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:28,180
May inside me open the light

303
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:33,180
So what, have I not been fed?

304
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:45,180
And I'm really trying to reveal My composure and my pride

305
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:58,180
The internet just seems gaping wounds Can we call the anguish inside?

306
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:13,180
Say wish and sigh, say wish and sigh, say wish and sigh

307
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,180
So how do we play?

308
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,180
Can't help the open door, right?

309
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,180
That's right

310
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,180
Can't help the open door

311
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,180
I'm awake

312
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,180
I am going under, under

313
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
Sweet time

314
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,180
Got me scared for a round

315
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,180
So, so, so we play

316
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:56,180
Song number three tonight, the Azzoic going under Kinetic Mix.

317
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Let's see what the kids thought of that one, Dark Sakura.

318
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,180
Um, better than the usual picks.

319
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,180
Aw, how sweet.

320
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,680
I mean, seriously, I mean, it's kind of less generic, so it gets an 8.

321
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Alright, uh, moving on.

322
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Logie, what do you think of the Azoic going under?

323
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
It's kind of average, 7.

324
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Alright, uh, I like that mix.

325
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,680
But I think I like the original one slightly better, so it gets an 8 from me.

326
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Alright, place vote now.

327
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,680

And song number three you can vote for tonight, The Ozoic with Going Under, the kinetic mix.

333
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,080
have much time so, frickin' hurry up, frickin' hurry with it.

334
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,920
Okay, now that we're in the afterbirth, now I suppose we can talk about the Oscars a little

335
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
bit.

336
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,320
Miek Latov, I see you lurking back there, wanna come on the show for a little bit?

337
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
You just want your iPod?

338
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,720
I see how you are.

339
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,840
well come yeah I'll make you work for it come here where's the microphone there

340
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,720
it is on the ground there now are you mad about the Oscars because I heard

341
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,400
that crash one and not Brokeback Mountain I can't be mad about the

342
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,080
Oscars because they were obviously just the joke Oscar since that pimp song won

343
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,080
best song did it really yeah so have you seen hustle and flow though it is

344
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,200
actually supposed to be pretty good granted I don't watch this type of

345
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,880
movies but it is supposed to be you know more than just an urban movie yeah but

346
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,480
the song is like it's hard being a pimp or something I thought the Oscars were a

347
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,520
little class have you been a pimp don't you know how hard to give him the Oscars

348
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,320
are Hollywood sucking its own dick like I know that people tell you you can't

349
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,880
suck your own dick but if you're in Hollywood you can because it's essentially

350
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,660
what the Oscars are and I think you know and I realize that the Oscars must be

351
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,080
like the gay Super Bowl but I fell out of love with the Oscars years ago

352
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:27,960
because you just start to realize it's all just one giant publicity stunt. Do you know why Crash

353
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,760
won best movie? Because they sent out over a hundred thousand screeners to people and you know

354
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,560
ran ads and stuff and please don't get me wrong Crash was a really good movie and Brokeback Mountain

355
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,720
was a really good movie but you know what there were thousands you know there I'm sure there were

356
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,040
lots of maybe not thousands but there were lots of good movies this year and who's to say Saw 2

357
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:53,040
should have won. Saw 2 totally should have won. Who won the Razzies? Was it crazy?

358
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:00,560
We didn't look to see who won a Razzie. Yeah he did. I think he won it for BloodRayne.

359
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,080
I'm sure he did. Go look it up. I really didn't care about the Oscars this year because I

360
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,860
figured Brokeback would probably lose even though it deserved to win out of what was

361
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:19,660
there. And so it's like, whatever, the pimps one, the racists one. It's fine.

362
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:25,600
How was Jon Stewart his host? Rather uncomfortable. He looked like he really

363
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,860
didn't belong, but Stephen Colbert, that's his name, right?

364
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:36,580
I heard he made an appearance or something. He did some sort of like PSA for, just a joke

365
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:42,940
PSA like you know a commercial saying how this audio engineer doesn't deserve

366
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,480
to win but this audio engineer does like you know like a political commercial is

367
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,460
it's pretty funny but most of the time I actually didn't watch the Oscars I flip

368
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:57,300
to it to see a couple of the awards that I mostly watch. Weren't you guys watching like a

369
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,140
Law & Order marathon? I am if I was in the living room right now I'd still be watching

370
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:06,140
Um, unfortunately for you guys, I don't think we've all won.

371
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
Oh, he didn't win?

372
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,140
Hallelujah.

373
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,140
The winner for worst, we want him to win a rather.

374
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,140
The winner for worst picture is Dirty Love.

375
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,140
Worst actor goes to Rob Schneider.

376
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
Ha ha.

377
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,140
Worst actress would be Jenny McCarthy, also in Dirty Love.

378
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,140
She's awesome though.

379
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Worst supporting actor, Hayden Christensen in Star Wars Episode III.

380
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:32,020
worst supporting actress Paris Hilton in House of Wax and they spell wax wrong

381
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:37,020
that's funny and then worst on-screen couple Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman in

382
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:44,420
Bewitched worst sequel or remake Son of the Mask and worst website the Razzie

383
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,940
Awards imagine that look at that crap website it looks like it was made in

384
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:57,040
Angelfire. Here, plug, I know you can't talk about anything that goes on at Konami because

385
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,320
of NDAs and stuff, but plug your favorite board game, which has nothing to do with your

386
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,680
game. Oh! Apples to Apples is the best board game. It has actually taken over break time

387
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,900
at work. Mario Kart is no longer the reigning champion. We play Apples to Apples because

388
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,360
it's really, really fun. That was quite fun. Really quickly, what do you do in Apples to

389
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:21,300
Um, you judge people, that's pretty much what you do, okay, no, like, there's this judge

390
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,220
and he puts down an adjective card, and then everybody else looks at the cards in their

391
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,640
hands and they're all nouns, and then they place what they think the judge thinks would

392
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,920
be the best match, and then the judge picks up all the cards, looks at them, and then

393
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,360
he awards a point to what he thinks is the best.

394
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,920
But the main part of the game is saying why you don't think certain cards should win,

395
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,160
if you're you yeah who likes to judge everybody pretty much that's why it's

396
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,280
fun all right let's announce the winner tonight's cage match so we can wrap this

397
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,540
show up here you guys ready this is a very very close cage match tonight might

398
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:02,280
I say one of the closer ones in years because one vote separated the winner

399
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,840
from the runner-up and then one vote separated the one runner-up from third

400
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,600
place so all three songs were very neck and neck but in the end there can be

401
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,400
only one

402
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:20,400
and tonight's winner is...

403
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,280
I won stinkin' vote

404
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,880
over compressor two stinkin' votes. Just like the Oscars, the one that's most

405
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,800
fresh in the minds of the voters

406
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,160
is the one that won. I bought all those votes but I actually placed an add in

407
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,280
variety this week

408
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,080
for your consideration the Azoic going under kinetic

409
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,360

410
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,460
on uh... internet radio station

411
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,700

412
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,200

uh...

420
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,460
what we're talking about the meantime what else is going on

421
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,440
i don't know

422
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,520
taxes

423
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,880
and get money

424
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,000
i'd that's how i'd

425
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,720
managed to buy the money twelve hundred from federal and two hundred from state

426
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,920
nice

427
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,000
actually started having them will hold a lot of money

428
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,920
i played

429
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,720
i turned on the cabinet

430
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,040
this weekend and then turned it back up because

431
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,880
i got yelled at for

432
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,120
turning on the cabinet while people were in the house and distracting

433
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,520
the guests and not socializing with people. I know, I know.

434
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,680
Did I just send Dan out to the garage to play the MAME? We have ours built out of a stand-up

435
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,680
play position. I feel so uncool, I'm the only OLR host with no

436
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,760
MAME cabinet. When I was, I was looking in that, you know, because on the airplane,

437
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,480
because I had a long flight this weekend,

438
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,800
I was looking at the Sky Mall thing, because you know they have the catalog. They have MAME cabinets on the Sky Mall?

439
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Yes, not MAME, but you know, arcade classics, that whole thing.

440
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,800
It was something like $3,600 I think they wanted for it.

441
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Good lord.

442
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,800
And basically take Midway arcade classics 1 and 2, and that's what you get in the pack.

443
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,800
So, you're basically paying $3,600 for a big hunk of plastic and a TV.

444
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
That's stupid.

445
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Have you seen the little ones at Target, though? Little baby ones?

446
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
No.

447
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,800
They're interesting. I mean, they're still a little pricey for me. I don't think I'd have one, but you know.

448
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,800
I want to make more of my interfaces, but I just don't have room to store them.

449
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,800
I need to get into a new apartment or a new condo or whatever,

450
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,800
so that we have our own bedroom dedicated to the cabinet,

451
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,800
so I can dump them in the closet because, unfortunately, each interface is like six feet wide,

452
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,800
or no, four feet wide. It's just too big.

453
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,800
You know what I want, and, you know, because we had Bobby on the show tonight from All Games,

454
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:05,800
And he was talking about on another show about how he went to media play, because you know all the media play stores went under, and he frickin' got one of those PlayStation 2 kiosks that you have in the store.

455
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Oh, really?

456
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Yeah, he got one of those in his house.

457
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,800
We have an Xbox One.

458
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Really? God, that's...

459
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Those are about two grand. They're pretty expensive.

460
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
Oh my God, really?

461
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Yeah, because I've actually...

462
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
I can tell you that's probably not what he paid for it.

463
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,140
I have a thing for Microsoft because they were pimping out there the kiosk before the

464
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:29,660
360 was coming out and they were like five grand for those. They have really detailed

465
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,660
ones.

466
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,980
Bob, he's going to link a picture right now so you guys can see it in his house. I think

467
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,980
he said he was playing Guitar Hero on it or something. I don't remember.

468
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,920
Oh, well, that's another thing. I've got to set up Guitar Freaks online eventually and

469
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,660
now that they've got actual DDR games running under MAME, that should be pretty cool. What

470
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:52,100
else was there something else I was gonna try that was pretty cool um he oh

471
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,060
he's he went ahead and told us how much he paid he paid 500 for it yeah that's

472
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,340
pretty good wow that's hardcore though I don't know if I could have spent that

473
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,020
kind of money but you go boy that's awesome here it is here's a picture

474
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,620
hold on loan it up right there there it is oh it is guitar hero right on that's

475
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,620
pretty cool he's got the little i-toys set up there on the top a little cutout

476
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:18,120
up there. That's awesome. Just sitting in the apartment, chilling. You know you're into

477
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:25,900
games when... Someday my cabinet will be done. Someday. I've got all the parts, I just need

478
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:32,340
the time and the space to put it in. Someday it will be mine. Seriously, it's been like

479
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,980
what, in production for two years now? Yeah. Well the big island preview in that apartment.

480
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,880

if you dark it so you says F you to a bowl for finally getting the hint

495
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:37,320
Popeanda21 says, speaking of dragons, F you to not being able to download Kuru Kuru Rock

496
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:42,920

hoes, gotta smack a bitch up, and F you to school and college and friction, burn on penises

498
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,320
and the oscars, fiend.

499
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
Where's my music?

500
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Thank you.

501
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,060
Legend of Zaku says, F you to giving an already intoxicated girl at a party in my apartment

502
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:03,380
a shot of Rumple Minz since that one got her passed out, as well as feeling guilty about

503
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,580
giving her the shot.

504
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,780
You college kids and your drunkenness.

505
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,620
Uh, Rama says, F you to Bamaniiso.ws for banning me.

506
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,500
I tried to do my share and keep Torrance up and I got capped for it.

507
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,420
I already got capped twice for sharing Torrance for you guys, but y'all ain't paying my cable

508
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,260
bill, so fuck you, you fucking prick.

509
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,940
Oh, and FYI, your Torrance will always be leaked out to other sites, so suck it.

510
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,740
Hey, you wanna get back at him?

511
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,740
Report him!

512
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,740
Turn him in!

513
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,740
SSJ100, ruin it for everybody.

514
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,740
SSJ100 Matt says,

515
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,740
F you to my anti-Semitic neighbor,

516
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,740
who password locked out my network

517
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,740
and changed it to,

518
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,740
secure your network you dumbass Jew,

519
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,740
and changed my router name to dumbfaggotJew.

520
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,740
It took me a long time to fix everything he messed up

521
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,740
and get my internet working correctly,

522
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,740
all because he hates me and my family for being Jewish.

523
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,740
That's like real...

524
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,740
Can you believe that that exists?

525
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,740
That's not funny!

526
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,740
Can you believe that that exists in the world?

527
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,240
Dick!

528
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,740
I'm going on to rename my router.

529
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,240
Just kidding.

530
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,240
Roz.

531
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
Goddamn you, Loki.

532
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,240
Roz says,

533
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,740
F you to co-moderators and annoying people in the roleplaying forum I go to.

534
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,240
One co-mod never shows up and the other one never has a clue of what's going on ever,

535
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,740
yet tries to get me to enforce really stupid rules.

536
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,740
Roleplayers who solely want to go around fighting people for absolutely no reason,

537
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,240
annoy the crap out of me too.

538
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:29,240
Not everyone is heavily armed or wearing armor so that they'll put up a fight, morons.

539
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,240
If there's any chicks there, I wanna do them!

540
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
That's the other kind of roleplay.

541
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
And Tomo-kun, last but not least.

542
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
Got any Mountain Dew?

543
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
That is fuck me for not paying attention.

544
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,240
Fuck Verizon, fuck the creepy guys at the arcade.

545
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Picking up my 15 year old friend.

546
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:57,240
old friend

547
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,420
that's it for another edition of orange lounge radio to afterbirth

548
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,480
we gotta go

549
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,540
we gotta

550
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,920
take little promo things for our our our big debut

551
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,460
set things on fire

552
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,260
no we're gonna set things on fire i was saying on the podcast last week about

553
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,940
or maybe not even on the podcast

554
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,100
askaninja.com

555
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,100
You know, if we ever become a TV show, that would be a great thing.

556
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,100
They're bigger than we are already. They've been featured on iTunes, like, four weeks in a row.

557
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,100
They were featured on the news!

558
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:31,100
We were featured on iTunes once, and in a dark, black corner somewhere, and we were lucky to really even get that.

559
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:41,100
But, you know, it's funny, they featured a video game podcast, I think, like, probably four times since iTunes has gone up.

560
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:46,100
The only time we were ever mentioned on iTunes was under Interesting Indies, which is kind of cool.

561
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:51,100
But you know what? The video game podcast, we've never been featured. Bobby's never been featured.

562
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:56,100
I don't know if All Games Interactive was. Maybe once. But you know who most of them are that get featured?

563
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:09,100
G4 replays, the X-Play podcast, probably Attack of the Show podcast and all that stuff that, you know, you can turn on your TV and watch, which defeats the purpose of podcasting.

564
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,360
know you couldn't turn on your heavy on and watch it because they would be playing Star

565
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:19,780
Trek Next Generation, The Man Show, Fast Lane, and oh, Bonsai. Oh, because that game failed

566
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,780
or that show failed on two different networks and then, what is it, G4 is the place where

567
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,040
shows finally go to die, you know, it's like, let's breathe life into it once more and hope

568
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,260
that, you know, it does well. Because it didn't do well in the last two demographics that

569
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:40,180
tried pushing it on. Don't you miss G4 back when it only kind of sucked? Like, it had

570
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:45,220
like maybe three shows that were watchable and now it has nothing except for hot Kevin

571
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:49,900
Pereira action. Had I known that it was going to go down this, you know, slippery slope

572
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,580
here, I would have, you know, maybe not judged G4TV.com so harshly. I was just so much nicer

573
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,940
to G4 in the beginning. I would have said every show on there is awesome. I love it.

574
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,400
I'm a big fan of everybody. Or like electric playground or filter. I know. Like, I love

575
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,400
I love Diane Miyazawa, she's my hero.

576
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
Like, you know...

577
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
You know, even though I'm gay, she's still pretty hot.

578
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
I mean, I gotta admit.

579
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
She is! Have you seen her in Mario cosplay?

580
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Is she the one that counts down things?

581
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
Yeah, she counts down things on her little show, but...

582
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,400
I don't remember which show.

583
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
I think, I want to say she's on the...

584
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
She's on Trainspaces, Kids or something like that.

585
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
What's she on the Amy Graham show? Three Wishes?

586
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,400
I don't know, but she's on Trainspaces, like, Kids or something.

587
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,400
Counting down wishes?

588
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:38,400
Alright, anyway, small corrections here.

589
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:46,400
Black Wolf says, or Bobby of course says that All Games Interactive actually was featured on iTunes once but it was under new and notable.

590
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,400
So that's what makes this little partnership we have going on interesting is that neither one of us are good enough to be featured as a video game podcast.

591
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,400
And I use good enough with loose quotes there.

592
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,400
Put Morgan Webb on your album art and shit, you'll be featured every week.

593
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,040
She's really awesome though, but has a small head.

594
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,040
She is.

595
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:09,400
That's the one thing I got out of E3 that year, because her head is really tiny.

596
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
The show's over.

597
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,640
I got his autograph, like, at the Nintendo Powerfest in, like, 19, whatever.

598
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:24,180
I still want to know what dumpster our sampler CD ended up in, Loki.

599
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,180
I don't know.

600
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,580
Probably, like, some intern, you know, angered them,

601
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,340
fucking threw it into his head like a ninja star, I don't know.

602
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:38,060
All right, I want to know what kind of dumpster that the katamari ball ended up in,

603
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,880
because seriously, you know, that thing...

604
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,660
We put our sampler on there. Didn't we put one of the ferrets on it too? Yeah, we did.

605
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,260
All right.

606
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,180
Uh, let's see, buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

607
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:56,380
Oh, don't forget, G4 was also the channel that brought us video game vixens.

608
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,680
Oh, I missed it.

609
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,820
Hey, at least I had something to do with video games.

610
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,820
Alright, we're done with G4 bashing, honestly.

611
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,460
That's so, you know, yesterday.

612
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,220
Anyway,

613
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,460
let's get this

614
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,700
show done with. Here's your fortune cookie message. Oh, final, final, final, final

615
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,420
thoughts. Mikl Tov.

616
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:20,660
The new Power Rangers sucks, except for the Green Ranger.

617
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,920
don't look at me like that

618
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,800
spike final final final super duper last thought

619
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,600
if you have anything

620
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,760
tommy talarico's just way too short

621
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,680
uh...

622
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,260
loki

623
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:39,000
what the hell was that really crappy show that was on that station with that

624
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,040
featured like the MMO skits

625
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,040
and that guy named dave who talked to a computer that didn't really exist

626
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,480
wasn't that uh...

627
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:46,980
Um...

628
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,320
Portal! God damn portal suck! Never mind, I take it all back!

629
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,140
Portal fucking suck!

630
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,280
No, you know what? You know what?

631
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,280
I would rather have that.

632
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,640
I would rather have that than what we have now.

633
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,780
And I take back everything I said.

634
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,600
Dark Sakura, final thought.

635
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,880
Um...

636
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,920
Hi.

637
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,000
And my final super duper last bit thought is, um...

638
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,600
I broke the mic.

639
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,880
Good night, everybody! Here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
